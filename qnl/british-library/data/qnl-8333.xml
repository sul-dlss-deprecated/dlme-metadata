I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's khureeta of 25th November 1874. I earnestly thank you for the determination which Your Excellency's Government pursues of affording me every opportunity of inaugurating a new system of reformed administration with success; and I am quite sensible of the kindness Your Excellency does me in appointing Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly, K.C.S .I., Your Lordship's Agent for Rajpootana to reside for a time at my Court. I well understand the grave importance of the khureeta which Sir Lewis Pelly has presented to me from Your Excellency. I already perceive the great advantage which will accrue to me from his advice and assistance. I thank Your Excellency for deputing him, and Your Excel lency may rely upon my carrying his advice into effect and in every way con forming to Your Excellency's wishes as expressed in the khureeta of 25th July last. I feel certain that Sir Lewis Pelly will very shortly be in a position to report to Your Excellency the satisfactory progress made in administrative affairs, and I beg that if, on receiving your Agent's reports, Your Excellency should find any thing to be amended, Vour Excellency will favour me with an intimation to such effect when I will immediately endeavour completely to meet Your Excellency's views. I beg to express the high consideration and esteem I entertain for Your Excellency, and to subscribe myself. Enclosure No 6. No. 433-1431, dated Baroda, 19th December 1874. From— Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly, K .C.S .I., Agent, Governor-General, and Special Commissioner, Baroda, * To—C. U. Aitchison , Esq., C.S.I., Secy, to the Govt, of India, Foreign Dept. A mong the instructions contained in paragraph 9 of your Office letter No 1586P., dated 25th July 1874, is the following :— ' He the Gaekwar should be advised ' * ' to prohibit the barbarous processes employed for realizing revenue, and to remove the c .use of such difficulty bya moderate and equitable land settlement and a faithful adherence to its terms in future, all future exactions of every sort or description being absolutely interdicted, and the continuance of such oppressive practices on the part o*f Durbar officials being strictly forbidden.' 2. On arrival at Baroda I found that proclamations forbidding the prac tices noticed had already been issued. I append copies for facility of reference, although they have already been included among the appendices of my No. 431-1428 of isth instant. 3. As regards the introduction of a moderate and equitable land settle ment, yad No. 2274, with enclosure, now appended, shows what has already been done by the Gaekwar officials, and what the views of the Durbar are on the subject. 4. The Cazee Shahaboodeen, who w r as for many years employed in our Revenue and other Departments, and who was subsequently entrusted with the Dewanship in Kutch, is at present the head of the Revenue Department in the Baroda territories. He is on all hands admitted to be a man of great natural ability and well qualified by training for the task he has undertaken. I have had many conversations with him on the revenue question; and shall shortly have the honor of submitting an English version of an elaborate report which the Cazee has just now concluded concerning the past, present, and future assessments. 5. The Cazee is hopeful and, indeed, confident that if he be not interfered with, he will be enabled to complete a satisfactory and equitable settlement. 6. Meantime, on my arrival here, I found this Residency invaded by numerous patels and their attornies, principally from the districts of Petlad and Xowsaree. For one or two days I listened to their complaints, and found them to be generally as follows :— ls^.—That the Gaekwar Government w T as pressing the cultivators for arrears of land revenue for a period of eight years ending with the close of the last revenue year. 2wd.—That the assessment during those years had been and still continued oppressively high. 7. On communicating with the Minister concerning these complaints, he informed me that the assessment was undoubtedly too high having due regard to present market prices; that the Revenue Department was revising 0 the settlement with all practicable speed; that for the current year it was proposed to take a liberal view of individual cases before exacting the fourth instalment of four annas in the rupee; and that the Ministry hoped before the close of the current year to be in a position to notify a reduced rough settlement for a short term of years, at the conclusion of which the available statistics might be expected to be sufficiently reliable to form the basis of a more scientific measure. 8. It appeared, however, that, for the present, the agricultural classes were, in many districts, in a state of (what the Minister termed) ' passive resistance' to the collection of the Government revenue. 9. 1 he Minister explained the causes of this unhappy condition of affairs to be— First. That the assessment was or had been unquestionably excessive. Second. That during the past year or so the agricultural classes had been led in part by our acts of minute and direct interference with the domestic jillairs of the Gaekwar State to look to our Government for support in their resistance to the Durbar, and had come to consider the British Residencv as a sort of Court of appeal. 10. After enquiring into this almost dead-lock in affairs, and after con- fronting the patels, &amp;c., with the Minister and the Head of the Revenue 23 Administration, the following seemed to me to be the most serious matters for consideration :— 1^.—That the origin of the present revenue difficulties was to be found among the consequences of the rebellion in the United States. The Baroda terri tories include a large portion of the richest soil in Guzerat; and during the rebellion the most remunerative crop on this soil was cotton. The price of cotton then rose from two or three pence up to two shillings per pound, and the breadth of land brought under cotton was widely extended, while the area under other crops was proportionately reduced. Hence prices and rents rose simultaneously. As a general result the cultivators were enabled to pay an extraordinarily high land assessment. Prices and rents being thus abnormally high, a revenue settlement for a period of ten years was introduced: while the purse of the State was recklessly opened to satisfy or increase miscellaneous stipends and other demands, which, under a normal condition of affairs, would probably have been refused. It does not appear that a balance sheet was prepared in those days. Presently, the price of cotton suddenly fell; but the land settlements and the increased stipends remained in force. Thus the agriculturalists became gradually unable to meet the Government demand on their land, and year by year fell into arrears of payment. I understand that down to the close of the past revenue year, Sumbut 1930, the arrears of land revenue within the Gaek- war territories have aggregated from seventy to eighty lakhs of rupees ; that the last instalment of the past year (1930) has remained almost wholly unrealized; and that the cultivators iiave persisted in a passive resistance to the payment of any instalment whatever during the current year 1931. Meantime the Sirdars, Silladars and others of the military classes and non-industrials, finding their allowances, &amp;c., clipped, resumed, or in arrears became discontented. 2nd. —I considered that, however advisable direct and minute intervention w T ith the domestic affairs of a Native Protected State may be, under abnormal circumstances of general misrule, it was apart from the ordinary policy of Government, and liable to impair the authority of the Native Government, that the residence of the representative of the paramount power should permanently become a tribunal for hearing individual and miscellaneous complaints of the discontented subjects of that State. 3rd.—It seemed to me that the financial condition of the Baroda State rendered it necessary that in order to an adjustment of their mutual misunder standings and grievances, both Prince and people should in some degree abate their demands and pretensions. 11. Accordingly, and after being requested to advice on the general embroglio I suggested that a proclamation should at once be issued promising liberal remissions in respect to arrears of revenue, and careful enquiry into present demands. 12. The Minister and the head of the Revenue Department concurred with me, and a Draft Proclamation was prepared and submitted to His High ness who approved its provisions, but subsequently suggested certain modifica tions in regard to arrears. These suggestions were referred to me for advice and were not adopted. 13. Eventually (that is to say last night) a Proclamation, of which English and Guzeratee versions are now enclosed, was issued to the several Revenue Divisions. 14. The principal features of this Proclamation are— 1st. —That it reduces the rate of assessment wherever reduction is found to be equitable, and promises to carry these reductions into effect not later than the date on which the last instalment falls due. 2 wg ?.—It promises a publication of assessments. '6rd. —It promises an absolute and total remission of arrears in respect to the five years intervening between the commencement of 1923 and the close of 1927.—It promises that in regard to arrears due for the years 1928-29-30 no demand shall he made against any cultivator unless after full enquiry made into the particulars of each case, and more particularly into the present condition of the cultivators concerned. 15. Some of the patels and their attornies continued their complaints at the Residency even after receiving the promise that the above liberal treatment would be accorded to them. But I explained to them that the promises having been made by the Gaekwar's Minister in my presence, I should now expect the cultivators to return to their villages and peaceably and loyally cultivate their lands. I am informed that the cultivators have followed this advice. But w^ant of confidence in the assurances of their Rulers is among the principal causes of the discontent which has widely spread in the Baroda territories, and nothing less than an undeviating adherence to promises which may now be made can restore confidence ; of this truth the Minister is fully aware. Translation of \ad No. 2274 of 1874. M y Dewan has submitted to me a summary of the conversation which took place between you and him concerning the prohibition of the barbarous processes employed for realizing the revenue, and the introduction of a moderate and equitable settlement. I have given my best attention to this subject, and have strictly prohibited the exercise of oppression in the collection of the Government revenue. I give myself the pleasure of enclosing copy of a cir cular which has been issued on the subject. As regards the revenue settlement what has already been done is as follows;— 1. The settlement of four mahals of the Northern Division as made by the Sir Sooba and sanctioned by me are being carried out. 2. Rao Sahib Laloobhai Karsandass, Sir-Kamdar, has been deputed to enquire into the jummabundee of the remaining four talookas of that division, and to submit his reports as soon as possible. 3. Rao Sahibs Keshao Rao and Chaganlal, Sir-Kamdars, have been deputed to the Southern Division with similar instructions. 4. Large reductions in Naosaree have been sanctioned and are now being carried out by the new Subha. I have now instructed the head of my Revenue Department, the Kazi Shahaboodeen, who is, I believe, well known to you to proceed to the Residency and explain to you, without reserve, all details under this head. I have also desired him to request the benefit of your advice with regard to the settlement he has already worked out. (Sd.) D adabiiai N owrojee, The Ith December 1874. Dewan. Translation of Circular issued on A shwan S hoodha 15th, Sumbut 1931. (A.ppended to yad No. 2274 of 1874.) I n orders dated Shrawan Shoodha 9th, No. 42, and Badrapad Shoodha 12th, No. 89, it is directed that measures should be taken in the matter of collecting land and other revenue to prevent ill treament on the part of Collecting officers of the persons by whom money is due, and that in default of payment by those from whom revenue on account of land, salami, cash imports, and other than land tax may be due, the same should be recovered in the manner below precribed. 1. Mohsul —Care should be taken that the Mohsul Horseman or foot does not act unauthorizedly towards the defaulter, and that he takes from the latter only the fixed rations for himself and for his horse (if a horseman), the Moh sul fee to be levied in addition to the 'rations should be fixed in reference to 4 Exd.-J. D. G.the account to be recovered and the ability of the defaulter to pay. The fee should be credited to Government. 2. If the defaulter be cultivator of Government land, his right of posses sion should be sold by auction. 3. Such property as is liable to be sold in satisfaction of a decree in a civil suit should be sold by auction to the extent of the account of the demand according to the provisions of the Civil Code. 4. The above three modes are prescribed, but if it appears to the Collect ing Officer that the defaulter is able to pay, and is only withholding payment with a fraudulent intention, the Collecting Officer is to have power to detain the defaulter in the Kutchery. In exercising this power care should be taken that the defaulter is not made to stand in the sun, beaten, made to hold his toes, and such other cruel and oppressive treatment or any other kind of torture is not employed. The talooka authorities should not have the power to detain a man in the Kutchery for more than ten days without the Sirsooba's orders. 5. Farmers shall have the power of sending Mohsuls according to clause 1, subject to appeal to the Wahiwutdar. But they shall have no powers to act upon clauses 2 and 3. Should a farmer find it necessary to put those clauses in force, he should apply to the Wahiwutdar, who, if he thinks it necessary to assist the farmer, should make a record to that effect, and act upon the clauses, 6. It has come to knowledge that Village Accountants sometimes behave in an oppressive way towards cultivators, strict supervision should be exer cised to prevent this. 7. Any one acting contrary to this order should be held strictly an swerable, and adequately punished. Such are the orders from the Huzoor. On this I have to write as follows:— 1. The first clause is about Mohsuls. The rations of the Mohsul Sowar or foot to be two seers and one adhole and not more on any account. The Mohsul fee should be fixed in reference to the amount to be recovered and the ability of the defaulter to pay. A Mohsul chit should be written and the reason for imposing the Mohsul should tie entered therein, a full copy of it being kept on record. No Mohsul should be sent without a chit. The Mohsul fee should be credited to Government. 2. Clauses 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 should be carefully acted upon. 3. According to clause 5 you should inform the farmers in your districts, and should a farmer or a defaulter apply to you, you should act according to the provisions of that clause. 4. You will explain these orders to the Karkoons and other servants under you and report at once any infraction of them. Act upon this. Dated Ash wan Shoodha 15 th, Sumbut 1931. PROCLAMATION. I t having been ascertained that owing to the fall in prices the rates of assessment press heavily on people, the Sirkar has resolved to relieve the ryots from this pressure by reducing the rates wherever reduction is found to be equitable. Accordingly, a complete enquiry is being instituted, and wherever it be found that reduction is necessary, such reduction will be carried into effect as early as possible, but not later than the date on which the last instalment falls due. All local revenue officers, patels, &amp;c., are hereby required to notify and explain to the cultivators the object of this Proclamation, and the patels are hereby warned that if after receipt of this Proclamation the instalments of the present assessment due before the reduction is made be not satisfied, payment will be enforced, and the responsibility of the patels in aiding the district revenue officers will be insisted on. 5 B6 In districts where Narwadari tenure prevails, a statement shewing the necessary alterations to be made in the Jummabundee will be prepared and explained within the period of one month fioni this dato k In the remaining districts, the assessment enquiry is being prosecuted and will be completed and made public as soon as practicable. As respects arrears of revenue, the Sirkar, having equitable regard to the fillen prices hereby notifies that an absolute and total remission of arrears is granted in respect to those from the year 1923 down to the conclusion of the vear 1927. In regard to the arrears due for the years 1928, 1829, and 1830, the Sirkar has resolved that no demand for arrears shall be made against any cultivator for arrears of revenue, unless after full enquiry made into the parti culars of each case, and more particularly into the present condition of the cultivators concerned.

I n continuation of the correspondence regarding the attitude of the military classes towards His Highness the Gaekwar, forwarded with this Department letter No. 6378, of 2nd ultimo, I anrtlirected to transmit to you, for submission to the Government of India, the accompanying copy of a letter from the Resident at Baroda, No. 397-1323, dated 25th idem, with its enclosures. No. 397-1323, dated Baroda, 25th November 1874. From —Col. R. Phayre, Resident at Baroda, To—C. Gonne, Esq., Secy, to the Govt, of Bombay. I n my letter No. 343-1168, dated 20th October 1874, I submitted to Government a copy of the Durbar yad No. 1867 of the 19th October 1874, and of my reply No. 1982, dated 20th idem. 2. I have now the honor to submit copy of a further communication Durbar yad No. 2079, dated 18th November 1874. frOIU the Durbar Oil tllC Same Subject, Residency yad No. 2217, dated 24th November 1874. anf | m y reply thereto. 3. It will be seen from the Durbar yad now forwarded that, although professing to accede to my request to advance to the military classes from tour to six months' pay on account of their arrears up to the end of last year (Sumbut 1930), the Durbar endeavour to entangle that simple and reasonable transaction witli the entirely separate subject of prospective arrangements from the year Sumbut 1931 inclusive, and it will be seen from my reply, now forwarded, that I have carefully avoided mixing up the emergent payment of 3^ years' arrears with the authoritative advice of Government tendered in my yad No. 1502 (C7.), dated 12th August 1874. 4. I respectfully submit that I cannot but regard the Durbar reply now forwarded, after a month's interval, as confirmatory of the general system of evasion to which I adverted in paragraphs 7 to 11 of my letter of the 20th October above quoted.o. So far as I am informed, the classes in question are most anxious to ieeeive bona fide advances on account of their arrears, and will sif?n properly worded receipts for such advances, but that they decline to mix up prospective anangements with their bond fide claims of past years. Translation of Durbar yad No. 2079, dated 18th November 1874. R esidency yad No. 1982, dated 20th October 1874, has been received, m ^ Inch Unstated for our consideration that as some time would elapse before each individual case would be decided, four to six months of the pay due should be paid to them m the interim, according to circumstances. With regard to this, we beg to state that according to your suggestion foui to six months pay is to be given to them on account of arrears, but we have prepared chittees up to the end' of Sumbut 1930, and our Dewan has arranged to pay them personally. And if any of the Commission case persons have been dismissed, they too will be paid something according to your sugges tion. But some have stated their unwillingness to accept auvrliin- unless their cases are settled, while others bring forward other new causes 'for not receiving the chittees. Those reasons are the following, viz., as it is our intention to reduce the jummabundee, and as for this and other reasons the revenues will be less, and as we have been advised to pay the officials'well, it will be necessarv to make a icduction in the expenditure; we have therefore warned every one that if necessary, the allowances, &amp;c, will be reduced; but that such reduction a \ ill at most be 2o per cent, and will be regulated according to iustice. On account of this they state that the Parekhs refuse to pay them in full, and request that the Parekhs may be directed to pay them in full; the Parekhs were accordingly directed to do so, and yet they finally state that unless it is decided that their allowances are not to be reduced, they will not receive the chittees; urging these objections no one comes for their chittees. You will easily see how improper this their reply is. No. 2217, dated 24th November 1874. From— Col . R. Phayre , Resident, Baroda, io—His Highness the Maharaja Gaekwar of Baroda. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Durbar yad No. 2079 dated 18th instant. A reference to my yad No. 1982, dated 20th October 1874, paragraph 2 will show that my advice to Your Highness was confined to advances on account o an ears of pay in order to relieve the immediate and emergent wants of the military classes in question. In the Durbar yad under reply reductions are alluded to which cannot c' the arrears of pay to which I referred, arrears up to the end of Sumbut 1930. Any reductions ailecting these classes which Your Highness mav have in contemplation for Sumbut 1931 and prospectively is a separate subject with which I cannot interfere except in accordance with the advice of Government communicated in the last two paragraphs of my yad No. 1502(07), dated 12th August 1874. / Enclosure No. 9.

No. 412-1362, dated Baroda, 3rd December 1874. jyom— C olonel R. P hayre , C.B., Resident, Baroda, To—C. G onne , Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I n submitting to Government the enclosed khureetas f from His Highness the Gaekwar dated 1st instant to the address of t In a separate packet. their Excellencies the Viceroy and Governor-Gene ral and the Governor of Bombay, I have the honor to offer the lollowing observations. 2. With reference to paragraph 4, I regret to state that His Highness the Gaekwar has not up to the present time carried out any of the settlements agreed upon between myself and His Highness' Minister, in consequence, it is represented, of the personal obstruction of His Highness the Maharaja. 3. With reference to His Highness' statement that in the majority ot cases I held extreme views, I can only state that the general tenor of those views is well known to Government, and that I have fnlly represented trom time to time the general principles on which all my negotiations were conducted. I would invite special attention to the accompaniment A of my letter 2\o. 343-1168 of the 20th October 1874, and to the proposals generally made by me for the settlement of Commission cases. Under these circumstances, it is for Government to decide whether the views expressed by me, which accord gener ally with the action taken by Government under similar circumstances, are extreme or not. At the same time I think it right to state that the views,which are adverted to by His Highness the Gaekwar as extreme views were expressed by me at Mr. Dadabhai's earnest request in a private and confidential way with a view to effecting an amicable settlement of the cases then under notice. The views thus expressed have never been officially promulgated and cannot compromise Government in any way. The course moreover pursued by me was in strict accordance with the instructions of Government communicated to me in clause 1. paragraph 6, of their confidential letter No. 22P., of 6th August 1874. 4. Paragraphs 6 to 20 inclusive of the khureeta under notice contain a statement of the general principles to which His Highness the Gaekwar would wish to appeal in carrying out the instructions of His Excellency the \iceroy and Governor-General with regard to the settlement of all Commission cases. It will be seen that the general purport of all the extracts which are quoted ia support of the principles therein laid down is to the effect— 1st. —That the will of the Ruler is supreme, and that all grants of what ever sort or description made by a Ruler are resumable at pleasure. 8 Exd.—J. T. F.2nd. That holders of alienations (jaghires, enams, wuttuns, nemnooks, &amp;c.) have no recognized rights whatever as against the Ruler of the State for the time being. 1 lla t adoptions, in all cases whatever, are subject to the will of the Ituler, irrespective of the custom of the country, the nature of the services, or the claims of the family. Irom these general principles the obvious inference is sought to be drawn that all the reductions, resumptions, and arbitrary and unjust acts of every description which have been so strongly animadverted upon by the Commission and by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General are in strict accordance with the custom of the country and of other Native States in India. 5. But it will be observed that whilst His Highness the Gaekwar has been thus advised by Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee to claim for himself the widest prero gatives of oriental sovereignty, and to appeal to them as the standard by which a settlement of the present cases should be negotiated, he ingeniously endea- vouis to di\ ert attention from the legitimate inference deducible from this posi tion by stating that he merely brings these principles to the notice of Govern ment, ' not with any desire to evade the advice of the British Government or to adhere strictly to them in dealing with the present cases, but with a view to appeal to His Excellency's sense of justice, whether as regards these complaints he should be asked to subject his acts to a standard which is so foreign to the traditions, usages, and sentiments of Native Governments. G. It will not fail to be noticed that the standard so earnestly deprecated by His Highness the Gaekwar in the passage above quoted is no other than that which is laid down in His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-GeneraFs khureeta of the 25th July last, and in my several yads embodying the autho ritative advice directed to be given in Government of India letter No. 1586P. of 25th July 1874. Under these circumstances it is difficult to see how the Gaekwar's present claim to be judged by an absolute Native standard, is con sistent with the reformed and more modern standard of the rights and respon sibilities of civilized Government, so cleariy enunciated in His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General's khureeta of 25th July last. 7. The clearest proof that the standard of Native rule to which His Highness the Gaekwar appeals is not a standard which can equitably or reason ably be accepted by Government in the settlement of pending cases, is shown by the fact that Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee, in the detailed proposals submitted with the khureeta under notice, has in fact adopted, to a considerable extent, in many instances, the very principles which I have myself advised, on the recom mendations of the Commission, and which he has, as above noticed, denounced as extreme. In fact, although I consider the proposals now made to be in many instances wholly inadequate to the serious nature of the claims adduced, yet it is to be observed that these proposals are considerably in advance of those expressed to me by His Highness' Minister at the commencement of negotia tions, and are altogether inconsistent with the theory that none of the com plainants have any rights whatever, except so far as the will of the Ruler may be pleased to recognize them. 8. With the object therefore of assisting my successor and enabling Government to form a fair opinion on the character of the proposals made, I proceed to notice seriatim the proposals submitted. 9. Paragraphs 1 to 31 of the statement accompanying the khureeta under notice contain the proposals of His Highness the Gaekwar relating to the settle ment of eleven cases relating to Sirdars and the Military classes. Before ad verting to the proposals submitted in these cases, it is material to notice that this settlement is confined to a very limited number only of the cases submitted to the Commission, the remainder apparently being dismissed as requiring no notice whatever by the Durbar on the ground that the Commission have stated that they did not feel called upon to record any opinion regarding them. 9 c10 10. It thus appears that His Highness the Gaekwar wishes to evade any settlement of the remaining cases under notice, although they are quite as emergent as any of those which are taken up by the Durbar, and although much correspondence has taken place regarding them during the last 18 months. In short, the proposal now submitted when regarded as the final settlement of • 40 Complainants were examined and the whole Sirdar's case* is so obviously inadequate others were in attendance. as to amount to a palpable evasion of the advice given by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General to effect an equitable settlement of all cases of this nature. 11. With reference to the eleven cases of Sirdars adverted to by the Durbar in the statement under notice, I have to remark that I am of opinion that the proposals made are as a whole wholly inadequate and bear no reason able relation to the specific claims and grievances of each petitioner. It will be remembered that in each instance the claims of petitioners relate to the following points:— 16^.—Arrears of pay and allowance for various periods averaging three and a half years. 2wc/.—Settlement of debts for subsistence for themselves and retainers contracted in consequence of such arrears and extending in many instances over a great number of years. 3rc?.—In cases of contemplated reduction, provision -for the future, either by pension or gratuity or compensation according to the nature and length of service of claimant, i.e., hereditary or otherwise. Mh. —Similar provision for armed dependants- and retainers of Sirdars thrown out of employment after various periods of service. bth. —Compensation for illegal seizure of horses and other private property of Sirdars. 12. The mere enumeration of these points will show that the proposals of the Durbar to dispose of the cases summarily by the grant of lump sums without reference to the bond fide details of each case, must involve the peti tioners and those dependant upon them in utter ruin, to the serious danger of the peace of the country. 13. The only other remark which I think it necessary to make applies to case No. u, appendix g.. baroda the cases of Madhow Rao Dliuudheyra, paragraph Commission's Report. 24 of the Statement, and Shah Mahomed Radhan Meeya, paragraph 25, the first having held a Paga for several generations ^ A .. „ in the British Continarent of 3,000 horse, and the Case No. 15, Appendix G. i i . , ^ ? i • mi i second having held a jaghire, enam village, and hereditary military service in the Hoozoorat of His Highness the Gaekwar. 14. In both of these cases the petitioners' main grievance is that they have been reduced to utter ruin through the refusal of the present Maharaja out of purely personal motives to confirm the right of adoption, and further that they have been deprived of private property to a considerable amount. In both instances the petitioners are the representatives of two of the oldest and most distinguished families in the Gaekwar State. 15. In the case of Dhundheyra two successive adoptions have, as admitted by the Durbar, already taken place, and in the present instance the customary recognition of the Maharaja, though alleged to have been at first accorded, has since been withdrawn merely for the purpose of enriching Nana Saheb Khanvelkur at the petitioners' expense. 16. In passing an opinion on the merits of this case, it will not fail to be remembered that hereditary service in the British Contingent gives the peti tioner strong claims to the support and protection of the British Government, and that the Maharaja should not be allowed to exercise an arbitrary and unjust interference with the hereditary service of an old and highly respectable family which can be shown to have rendered distinguished service to both the British and Baroda Governments during the last 80 years.17. In the case of Shalm Mahomed Radhan Meeya there are additional circumstances of aggravation. The recognition of petitioner was formally- made by the Maharaja and the jaghire was continued in his name for upwards of a year. The present assertion of the Durbar that the presentation of a poshack, which is the formal signal of recognition, was made merely as a mark of condolence is so utterly futile as not to be worthy of serious notice, and is moreover refuted by the evidence adduced before the Commission. The peti tioner is the legal heir and representative of his uncle, the late Radhan Meeya, who always treated him as his legal successor and was generally recognized as such. 18. Under the circumstances above disclosed, I earnestly commend to the favorable consideration of Government these two cases in particular, and trust that before any settlement is finally made the Government may be pleased to order a careful enquiry in each case and take the wdiole of the circumstances into consideration. 19. Paragraph 32 of the statement accompanying His Ilighness the Gaekwar's khureeta under notice relates to the case of Muggun Purshotum, m liich was entered as case No. 37, Schedule IT., Raroda Enquiry Commission Report. 20. With reference to the proposals of the Durbar in this very serious case, I have the honor to solicit attention to my final statement and to the opinion of the Commission recorded thereon, together with all the other evi dence relating to the case that will be found recorded in the Proceedings of the Raroda Commission. It will be observed that although the Commission decline to express any opinion regarding the exaction of the bond for 20 lakhs, the Durbar now propose that the complainant should be required to prove his asser tions, or in default forfeit the remaining 14 lakhs of rupees, less the value of the jewels, &amp;c., that are said to have been taken from the complainant. 21. Considering that the Maharaja has thus every motive to suppress the real facts of the case and to prevent the complainant from proving it, it will be utterly unreasonable to suppose that the complainant would stake everything on the result of such an enquiry. Under any circumstances, I would earnestly solicit that whatever enquiry may be instituted in this case should be so through the Residency. 22. The excessive spoliation to which this complainant has been subjected at the hands of the present Maharaja renders him deserving of special consider ation. 23. Paragraphs 36 to 46 inclusive of the statement under notice relate to the proposals for the different cases of members of the late Gaekwar Khun- derao's family. 24. AV ith reference to the proposals made, I have the honor respectfully to observe that they do not generally appear to bear any relation to the details of each case, and that without careful enquiry into the merits of each case separately and the circumstances of each petitioner, it would be impossible to effect anything like an equitable settlement of each case. 25. Paragraphs 47 to 63 relate to the different cases of the late Khunde Rao Gaekwar's followers and dependants. 26. These cases were considered by the Commission to be amongst the very worst of those presented to them for enquiry. Some of the proposals now made appear to be fairly liberal, but I would earnestly solicit before any final opinion is expressed by Government as to the character of the proposals made each case be separately considered on its own merits, and that the persons concerned or their Agents be permitted to make what representations they have to make before their cases are finally decided. I have already on numerous occasions brought to the noticp of Government that the ruin of this class was effected by the Maharaja mainly for the purpose of spoliation. It is notorious that all ot the persons concerned were possessed of very considerable property, 11far more considerable than would appear probable from their position in life. They were indeed the favorites of the late Gaekwar and appear to have enjoyed his favors with considerable profusion. 27. In the case of Moonshee Hubeeboolla there are special circumstances of aggravation, he is moreover one of the most important witnesses relating to the alleged poisoning of the late Minister JUiow Scindia. I would commend his and his brother's case for special consideration. 28. With reference to the cases of Luximeebaee, widow of Mulharba Shilka, and Bageerthibaee, widow of Gunnoo Wagh, paragraphs 56 and 57,1 have the honor to state that the husbands of both of these persons are alleged to have been poisoned in prison by the orders of His Highness the Maharaja. The pro posals now tardily made, though apparently liberal, are, I believe, wholly inade quate to the special circumstances of the case which are of an aggravated character. 29. With reference to the case of Parbutibaee, widow of the late Bhow Scindia, see paragraphs 58 to 60, I am respectfully of opinion that the proposal to compensate the two widows with a lump sum of Rupees 25,000 is, under the circumstances, wholly inadequate. The suspicious nature of their husbands' death in prison is well known to Government. The extensive spoliation of his enormous property, which is popularly valued at from 30 to 40 lakhs of rupees, but which the Durbar have valued at 5 lakhs only, is notorious. These facts, it is submitted, give the petitioners an exceptional claim to the protection of Government, and I would earnestly commend their case for favorable notice. 30. With reference to the proposals submitted regarding the remaining cases adverted to in the statement under notice, I do not think it necessary to offer any detailed comment, but I would observe that the statements made by the Durbar are in several instances wholly opposed to the statements of the petitioners concerned. I would therefore hope that before any opinion what ever is expressed by Government regarding the propriety of the proposals now made, a detailed enquiry should be instituted into the merits of each case and the petitioners be allowed to make whatever representations they may have to make. 31. In conclusion, I have the honor to invite attention to the fact that the proposals of the Durbar are limited to a certain number only of the cases that came before the Commission, and that it should not be left to the Durbar to decide in what cases they will give compensation and in what cases they will refuse to give it. It will be remembered that whatever settlements of Commis sion cases may now be effected under the authoritative advise of Government, will be regarded as precedents, not only at Baroda, but in other parts of India. Under these circumstances, I am respectfully of opinion that any opinion regarding the propriety of the settlements now proposed by the Durbar should be expressed with the greatest caution. Enclosure No. 11. Khureeta, dated Baroda Palace, 1st December 1874. From—His Highness Mulhar Rao Maharaja Gaekwar Sena Khaskhel Sumshere Bahadoor, To—His Excellency the Right Hon'ble Thomas George Baring, Baron North' brook, G.M.S.I., Viceroy and Governor-General of India. As promised in my khureeta of the 2nd November 1874 I have this day addressed the following khureeta to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay :— 1. With reference to the advice which the Resident, under instructions from Government, has conveyed to me about the Sirdars and military classes of this State (yad No. 1502C.-T.), the relatives and dependants of the late Maharaja (yad No. 1532C.-13), and the Bankers (yad No. ), it has become necessary for me to submit for Your Excellency's consideration the following representation :— 2. In pursuance of this advice I directed my Dewan to offer certain terms to the complainants. But from the sprit in which some of them received 12 . Exd.-J. T. F.my proposals, it soon became evident that they would not agree to anv reason- able settlement, unless I had the cordial co-operation of the Resident. ^ therefore desired the Dewan, as a most speedy and practicable method oi dealing with the matter, to ask the Resident to favour me with his views as to the settlement oi each case, in order that I might carry out at once such as 1 agreed with and submit the rest of the cases, if any, with our respective opinions for the consideration of Government. 4. 1 he Resident at first readily acceded to the suggestions, and ^ave his views on some cases. I at once carried out such as I agreed with. In other cases, and generally, I unfortunately found the Resident taking extreme views. 5. Finding that the chances of our agreement are not many, I have resolved to submit at once to Government the consideration of the principles necessary to be borne in mind and my proposals in each case with an endeavour as far as possible to please Government. I append therefore a statement of mv proposals. J (5. The settlement of these cases to be reasonable in itself and equitable for all parties requires to be made after a careful consideration of and proper allowance for such rights and prerogatives as have alwavs been possessed by Native Princes. I can assure Your Excellency that it is not my object to evade in any way the advice of Government, nor do I mean that I intend to insist on an entire continuance of the hitherto prevailing practices. 7. In order to arrive at a proper understanding of the extent and scope of the rights and prerogatives of Native Princes as they have always existed, I will now submit for lour Excellency's consideration the following:— 8. In his minute of 16th January 1823, Sir Thomas Munro says ' k In this country under the Native Governments all grants whatever are See Colonel Etheridge's Narrative resumable at pleasure. Official grants are perma- n^iVu mbtty Inara Coinrai!!!,ion ' nent while tli e office continues but not always in the same family; grants for religious and charitable purposes to individuals or bodies of men though often granted fo?- ever, or while the sun and moon endure, were frequently resumed at short intervals; giants of jaghiies oi inain lands, from favour or alFection, or as rewards for services, were scarcely ever perpetual. It was rare that anv term was specified and never one or more lives; but it made usually little difference whether the grant was for no particular period or perpetual. The altumgha or perpetual grant was as liable to resumption as any common grant containing no speci fication oi time; it was resumed because it was too large, or because the reign ing soverign disliked the adherents of his predecessor and wished to reward his own at their expense, and tor various other causes. There was no rule for the continuance of grants but his pleasure: they might be resumed in two or three years, or they might be continued during two or three or more lives; but when they escaped so long, it was never without a revision and renewal. I believe that the term of their lives is a longer period than grants for services were generally permitted by Native Princes to run.' He proceeded :— ' It appears from these facts that in the Carnatic altumgha grants (the highest sort of royal grants) so far from being irresumable, have not been so much respected as many of the ordinary jaghires. The Commissioner of Poona, in answer to a reference made to him on the subject, has stated that he has not been able to find a single altumgha in the Deccan, and has transmitted a list of five hundred and ninety jaghires resumed by the Peishwa's Government within the last fifty years. In the Nizam's dominions too the resumption of jaghires appears from the note of his Minister Chundoo Lall to have been regulated as in the Carnatic by the will of the Prince.' And added— ' There are no persons to whom jaghires have been continued without some change or modification. It can easily be shown that Princes resumed altum-14 oins -it nleasure It cannot be sliown that when they were disposed to resume the act o^ iesuinj)li()n ever was or could be prevented. It may be said that they were despots and acted nnjnstly. Had they seized private property they would have been regarded as unjust by the country; but no injustice was attached to the seizure of an altumgha** the people ^ nevv , of public revenue. The Princes were, it is true, despotic : but tlu y «e e hberal and oven profuse in their grants, and the grants themselves grew out ol their very despotism; for it was because tbey found no dilhculty in resuming t i.i icy made none in granting.' , n • i And in his first quoted minute be brought in a letter from AVal aja, the Nawab of the Carnatic, to the Government oi Madras,dated 18th Jctobci .(JO, on the subject of jaghire grants : «I am Prince of the Carnatic, and for these forty years I have granted, resumed, and altered jaghires in such manner as I have thought proper. 9. Captain Cowper in his Report on Adoptions under the Teishwas savs:— 'It appears equally certain that the Peishwa's Government not only pos- p n* Q.wion X S. No. sessed the power of resuming mams, but that the xxvin!'? 6 31. ' power was freely exercised, and it is further show 7 n that Inamdars were not exempted from the payment of cesses, but they contri buted largely in this respect. In short it is placed, I think, beyond a doubt that an inam, though granted as a free gift in perpetuity, was resumed or continued, and was taxed at pleasure. ' The power of resumption seems to have been arbitrarily exercised, but this is not surprising, for it could scarcely have been otherwise when the will of the sovereign had the force of law, and indeed teas the law. Whatever may have been the theory, in practice inams seem to have been interfered with in every possible way, and it will be seen that on an Inamdar's death even his son could not consider his holding secure without obtaining the special sanction ot Govern ment to the succession. It w T ill be observed also that political offences ^eie punished by resuming the inam of the offender, and that the punishment due to the actual delinquent was sometimes even inflicted on his relatives' 10. Captain Cowper bases these remarks on four statements containing a number of selected cases illustrative of the system which was in force during the last seventy years of the Peishwa's Government. 11. In his reports on the Deccan Surinjams the same authority says : ' Shortly after the conquest of the Deccan, several districts which had Bombay Selection, n . s.. No. xxxi., belonged to the Peishwa were ceded by the British Deccan Surinjams, page 30. Government to the Nizam With wIlOUl it tllCn rested to continue or not, at his pleasure, surunjams to a large amount which had been held in those districts prior to the cession. Generally speaking they were not continued.' 12. I w T ill now give a few quotations from Captain Cow 7 per's report as to the right of adoption, the more particularly as they contain the principles recognized and acted upon by the British Government. ' It has always been and still is a standing rule that an adoption not sanc tioned by Government gives the person adopting no Report on Adoption, page i. to perpetuate any alienation ot Government revenue.' ' It may I think be concluded from the above letters that as a general rule among the existing Governments oi India no idem, page 3. adoption is looked upon as valid unless previously sanctioned by the Sirkar.' 13. The Company's Government proclaimed in 1820 that:— ' Should any one make an adoption without permission the Sirkar will not recognize it, and the adopted son shall not be allowed to hold any bucks, &amp;c., under Government.'14. On the same subject Mr. Hart observed :— 4 ' The records of the Hindoo Government to which ours has succeeded, T) t in show that the sovereign carried his interference Report on Adoption, page 10. -Jh i • o i • i i i i wreli adoptions so lar as not o ily to witliliold his sanction from adoptions which he was not disposed to recognize, but to forbid the very ceremony and even to order the repudiation of a child unauthorizedlv adopted.' 15. The Chief Secretary to the Bombay Government wrote to Mr. Uart:— ' On reading over the memorandum His Lordship in Council can come to idem a 'e 9 7 no 0 ^ er opinion but that Government have a right to reserve in all cases the power of granting or refusing such assent ^o an adoption as will confer upon the adopted son a title against the State.' ' His Lordship in Council would refuse to perpetuate by adoption any secular, cash or grain allowance except when there are special reasons of a political nature as in some of the instances occurring in Guzerat.' 16. The Revenue Secretary in his letter wrote as follows:— ' It is I think clear that in reserving to themselves the power of granting v rj „„ or refusinsr such assent to adoption on the part of Idem, page 33. T ~ i i -i • T i ^ i • inamdars and others holding hens on the public revenue, as will confer on the adopted son a title against the State, Govern ment merely exercise a right which the Peishwas never for a moment relinquished.' Idem, page 40. 17. The Honb'le the Court of Directors |said:— 'We are decidedly of opinion that in no case should the alienation of an inam be recognized for any term exceeding that for which the present holder and his heirs may possess an interest, and that the eventual right of Govern ment to resume the revenue on th 5 extinction of the family of the original grantee should be carefully maintained.' 'This rule' the Court desired 'must be considered inviolable.' 18. As to how far holders of alienations contributed to the public re sources, the following is quoted by Captain Cowper from Mr. Chaplin :— ' These nuzzers formerly produced a very considerable revenue, the sum idem •i &lt;r e ii derived from them by the late Government during the last fifty-six years exceeded four crores and fifty-eight thousand rupees.' 19. Upon this Captain Cowper remarks :— ' And even this large amount which was that appearing in the public accounts, formed, Mr. Chaplin thought, but a small part of the total collections under this head.' 20. I may also draw Your Excellency's attention to the following trans lation of a communication in Persian (copy appended), dated 6th November 1849, and addressed by the Governor-General's Agent to the Native States of Central India:— ' Copy of roobkaree (proceedings) in the great office of the Residency before Sir Robert North Colly Hamilton Saheb, Bahadoor, Resident of Indore, written on the 6th Novem ber 1849. Seal of the Residency. Signed in English. True Copy. ' In all the States of this country, in matters specially of bucks of Jaghire- dars of the State, and in dealing with and acting upon, grants made by former Princes, disputes generally arise, a decision of which disputes is a delicate work involving much consideration and anxiety; and as it is considered in every 15respect better that the British Government should make public its opinion on the subject, the same opinion is (here) put in writing with all clearness, viz., that none of the Princes can alienate or grant lands for a period beyond his own lifetime, and that grants of land or fixed allowances in ca%h, made during the minority of a Prince, shall not be acted upon without fresh sanction and confirmation on the Prince attaining his majority. 3Iaafee jaghires and lands for the servants of the State are only 3 for the aid of the State, and therefore such grants made for periods beyond the lives of the grantees in return for their aid and services to the State,'thus limited, cannot be alienated from the State in perpetuity. Once in 1843 this subject came on for discussion before His Excellency the Governor- General, when it was written that a Prince grants jaghires from the State, where by the revenues of the State diminish while the fixed expenditure of the State continues, the burden on the State increases. Under these circumstances a deficiency in the amount required for the fixed and necessary expenses of the State occurs, and thus great injury arises in future to the Prince from such grants. The Governor-General, considering the importance of the subject, disapproves of the grants of such jaghires, and considers the discontinuance of the practice reasonable. It is therefore fit for every one to keep this rule in view. Although it is not supposed that all States are so insolvent as not to be able to make^grants of jaghires, it is possible that grants of jaghires will in future create great difficulties. ' O rdeeed —That a copy of this roobkaree be given to each Vakeel in attend ance at the Kesidency, and' that copies be sent to Political Agent, Bhopal, Malahur, Captain Wilkie, Agent, Bhopawur, Captain Keeves, Political Agent, Munmar, and Lieutenant Taylor, Deputy Political Agent, Mahur, with the object that the said officers give a copy to the Vakeel or Kamdar of each State with which they are connected.' 21. These are the principles and practices which have hitherto obtained in this as well as in all other Native States, not without recognition, as above shown, by the British Government. I bring them to Your Excellency's notice not with any desire to evade the advice of the British Government, or to adhere strictly to them in dealing with the present cases, but with a view to appeal to Your Excellency's sense of justice, whether as regards these complaints I should be asked to subject my acts to a standard which is so foreign to the tra ditions, usages, and sentiments of Native Governments. I am quite willing, I assure Your Excellency, to treat every case with consideration, and to do all I reasonably can to satisfy these complainants. How far I am earnest in this desire will appear to Your Excellency from the accompanying statement. I must, however, at the same time ask for the same equity and justice for mysell which 1 am advised to extend to others. 22. I trust Your Excellency will judge of the settlements I have proposed in the light of the considerations set forth in this khureeta, and will assist me in bringing this matter to a speedy conclusion. 23. I have addressed a similar khureeta (copy enclosed) to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and I beg that \our Excellency will forward it to His Lordship. With cordial esteem, &amp;c. 2. I beg to express the high consideration and esteem I entertain for Your Excellency, and to subscribe myself, &amp;g. Statement accompanying- His Highness the Gaekwar^s khureeta, dated the 1st December 1874, to the address of His Excellency the Governor in Council, Bombay. Sirdars and Silledars, T he Commission report says that there are seventeen cases of complaints against the proceedings of the Government since the accession of the present Chief, six of which do not appear to the Commissionto call for an opinion from it, 16 Exd.-J. D. G.The following proposals are made for the remaining eleven. Note. —There is a certain number of persons whom His Highness strongly desires not to be allowed to remain in Baroda. His Highness regards them as his personal enemies, and considers himself in danger from them. There is also the further risk of these men malacionsly complaining that His Highness molested them, though he might do nothing of the kind. It would be best for all parties that these persons lived out of Baroda:— No. 11. Abdool Rehman. This man is one of those who are personally disagreeable to His Highness. His pay from 1918=1862 only was Rupees 600 per annum, and he had an allow ance of Rupees 1,200 per annum for palkee granted to him by the late Prince in consideration of service performed and to be performed in future. 2. So far as his services as a Jemadar were concerned, he was purely a stipendiary servant, and was entitled to his pay only so long as he served. 'He was liable to be dismissed at any time. Though as a general rule no gratuity is granted to such servants on dismissal in Native States, His Highness'is will ing, in deference to the wishes of the British Government, to give him a gratuity of Rupees 2,000 (two thousand), which is equal to one-third of his pay, commuted into a lump-sum at ten years' purchase. 3. The allowance of Rupees 1,200 (twelve hundred) per annum granted by Sunnud was partly for past service, including a special service, and partly for future service. The future service has been dispensed with since 1927=1871. Independently of this being partly only a service grant, it has been distinctly admitted by the British Government as the universal practice and right of Native Princes to resume at will any grants, perpetual or temporary, made by their predecessors, and this practice and right have hitherto obtained in tins State. Still His Highness is willing to grant a lump-sum of Rupees 12,000 (twelve thousand), which is equal to ten years' purchase of his annuity. No. 12. Narayenrao, Shivrao, Govindrao, Hurpalay. 4. In this case of the Rupees 5,800 (five thousand and eight hundred) the pay of the complainants was as follows :— Narayenrao ... ... Rs. 1,142 per annum. Shivrao ... ... „ 747 „ Total ... Rs. 1,889 per annum. The remainder is for the pay of the sowars who have been drafted into the Contingent. Their pay was stopped in 1927 = 1871, and from that a sum of Rupees 600 (six hundred) per annum has been allowed for subsistence to their two aunts, who would otherwise have been destitute. 5. These men are also regarded by His Highness as his personal enemies. 6. They were like No. 11 stipendiary servants, and the remarks made in paragraph apply equally to their case. His Highness therefore proposes to give them a gratuity of Rupees 6,300 (six thousand and three hundred), which is equal to one-third of their pay, commuted into a lump-sum at ten years' purchase. His Highness does not propose to deduct the Rupees 600 allowance hitherto paid to the two aunts, though that allowance will be stopped hereafter. 7. As regards the complainants' horses and their furniture. His Highness will pay Rupees 1,000 (one thousand). No. 13. Ali Mamud Ray a Ali. 8. The charge of twenty-one men with an annual allowance of Rupees 1,935 has already been restored to the complainant, who has thus been provided for.&gt; 9. As for the Okhamandal Levy of two hundred men, this was the original establishment of the Mahal, and all that the complainant had to do with it to hold charge of it only from 1922=1866 to 1926=1870. No Government could admit such a claim as the complainant puts forward on this head Still His Highness offered him a place of Jemadar on Rupees 65 a month in the same Levy (his original pay in that Levy having been only Rupees 75), but he rejected this offer. His Highness, therefore, does not now think him deserving of any such consideration. &amp; ^ 10. For cases Nos. 14 to 17 see paragraphs 24 to 28. Nos. 18,19 and 20 have been settled with the assistance of the Resident. No 21. Samul Becker. 11. The allowance for the Paga was for service which has been dispensed with. Had Motilall (the last man in service) been alive, His Highness would have granted him a pension, but as he ceased to be a Government servant a year before his death, nothing now remains to be done. As for the private property in horses and equipments, the value thereof will be allowed for in the Jincf ment of accounts with the Eirm. 1 12 As for the inam village of Gadula, it is admitted by the oomnlainant himself to iiave heen held only 'annually,' and as such the grant was discon- tinuable and was discontinued. 13. The villages Dewalipoor and Futtehpoor were granted on service tenure. 1 hough the service has now been dispensed with, and though the com- plamant is not entitled as a matter of right to have the villages continued His Ihghness is willing to show him consideration. He will continue the revenue of the villages as based on the realizations of the current year during the lifetime of the complainant, who is a minor, only about five years old. His HHmess will lurther continue a moiety for one life more. 14. With regard to the allowances for palkee and runners, they were honorary stipends, granted in the words of the Commission, so Ion- as the grantees continued to serve the State as bankers; but as they are dead, and as also the connection ot the Firm with the State as bankers has ceased the allowances have ceased too. ^ asm, me fnVo l0 i ^ lth to the private property of the Firm, the Agents have not t ken charge of the same, though repeatedly asked to do so. or V 3 ' d t0 aid from the Durbar to the Firm in effectino- an adjustment of 'ts advances to the Sirdars and Silladar classes, it shall be &lt;?iven m accordance with the practice heretofore in force. _ 17.

Complainant is mistaken in stating that this allowance is continued to him. What is conti nued is the item of Rupees 13,288 per annum, which was granted by the late Maharaja as an equivalent for the two villages resumed by him. 20. The complainant having been allowed by His Highness to be adopted in preference to another member of the family of closer relationship at the earnest solicitations of the mother of the deceased, that lady consented to pav the nuzzerana. The terms of this arrangement were settled and carried out before the recognition of the adoption. His Highness, however, is willing to give back to the complainant his private property in Baroda and Sarsaoli, which he (complainant) has valued at Eupees 4,50,000. While making this concession, His Highness is ready, if the complainant so chooses, to give^ack all that he has received, and cancel the adoption so far as it affects all grants and honors held from the State. The village of Sarsaoli, moreover, was granted to the last holder in tail male in consideration of his relationship and for service (as killadar). No. 37. Babajee Kasirao Dhumsi. ■'I* examining the complainant s case, it was found that there was truth on his side. His Highness has, therefore, ordered that his claim be recognized. No. 38. Bhagwantrao, Gopalrao, Jadao. 22. 1 his case has been settled according to the Resident's advice. 23. 1 he six cases on which the Commission has given no opinion. No. 14. Gunpatrao or Bahoantrao bin Mahadhowrao Bhamdere. 24. Two successive adoptions have already taken place. His Highness has a right, as admitted by the British Government, to refuse to sanction any further adoption, and has, therefore, resumed the State grants. The complainant cannot be moreover adopted according to Hindoo law, because he is the brother of the deceased. The private property which is claimed by two or three parties is therefore under attachment, pending any of the' parties concerned making his or her claim good before a Court of Law. Should any of the three ladies (the mother and the other wife of the father of the deceased and the wife of the deceased) apply for maintenance till the dispute is settled, His Highness will make arrangements therefor from the private property. No. 15. Shah Mahamad. 25. In this case the customary poshak said to have been granted on the third day of Radhan Mia's death was given only as a mark of condolence {dukhota). The alleged adoption is in itself illegal, as no adoption is allowed bv Mahomedan law. But were it even allowable His Highness has a right to refuse to sanction it as regards property held from the State. 26. The other members of the family still hold and enjoy their State grants, and His Highness has already allowed Rupees 2;400 per annum- to Radhan Mias widow for her support for life, which he is willing to increase to Rupees 5,000 (five thousand) per annum. No. 16. Mahabula Khan. 27. 1 he deceased has left a son by a Loundee, who alleges that he had made mka with her. Neither the son nor the surviving widow has sought to establish 19heirship in the proper tribunal. Therefore, till either of the parties establish his or her claim, the widow will be granted a maintenance allowance of Rupees 600 per annum from the estate. Moreover, the widow, on whose behalf the complainant (her father) appeared before the Commission is dead. No. 17. Mahadowrao Jeysingrao Gaekicad. 28. In this case the Paga and other property were originally in the charge of the complainant's mother; but at the request of complainant the Paga was made over to him by His Highness. He, however, so mismanaged it that the Political Agent at Sadra complained about its inefficient state. The whole management was therefore taken out of his hands and transferred to his mother as before. As the State is interested in the efficiencv of the Paga service, it will continue it in the hands of the mother, unless he gives proper security for better management in future. As regards the other estate, there is a dispute between the mother and son, which is being enquired into. No. 24. Anandrao Govind Phanse. 29. The only complaint in this case is about the village of Deola, but this village, which was Dumala, and was held only as a part of his allowances, was taken away by the late Maharaja, and a cash allowance substituted instead to make up the total of his emoluments. There is, therefore, no grievance whatever. No. 35. } adowrao Tookajee Kadam. 80. This question, which is one of right between two private parties, viz,, the complainant and his paternal grandmother, will be shortly enquired into and settled. The nuzzerana of Rupees 35,000 will be returned. 31. lor the rest of the cases under the heading of Sirdars, the Commis sion observes 'that the cause ot grievances in the cases of eleven of the com plainants arose in the time of the late and previous Gaekwars, and that the C ommission does not feel called on to record any opinion in ten of the num ber. In one ot these cases, No. 8 on the list, the action complained of appears to be harsh and arbitrary, though quite in accordance with the then existing practice of the State.' No. 37. (Schedule II.) Mugon Furshotum (Hari Bhagti.) 32. The chithi for twenty lakhs of rupees was given up by His Highness or a much less consideration in the ornaments, garden, &amp;c., which are now c aimed, lie also saved the Firm from ruin by lending it a sum of 2^ lakhs of mpees, a part of which still remains to be recovered. i vv as taken by the late Maharaja for a debt of twenty lakhs ue jy t le rirm to the State. The complainant alleges that no such debt was ue, and that the chithi was taken forcibly by the late Maharaja. His High ness pioposes as a fair and satisfactory solution of the question, that it should e ascei ained whether the debt for which the chithi w r as given is really due. n f H &lt; P n&lt; l uli y C011 ttrms the complainant's statement. His Highness will return f* i ^ w . 0 ^ ems Rupees of 75,000 each) that he has received from um. u ] otherwise, the payment of the remaining fourteen lakhs, less the ya ue o t ie jewels and the garden, and the two items abovementioned, will be recovered. follow^' V ^ a ® cs an( ^ a Mowance claimed by the complainant are as ^ k !'' ^P a o e Goriad granted by Govindrao Gaekwar to Hari Bhagti as an hereditary mam. 20 Exd.—J M.Ind and 3rc?.—The villages of Samra and Samree granted by Sayajee Rao Gaekwar to Becher Samal, grandson of liar Bhagti, hereditarily on service tenure. kth.—The village of Simlaek granted by Sayajee Rao Gaekvvad to Becher Sanial on service tenure, not hereditarily. J bth .—An honorary allowance of Rupees 1,200 per annum granted by Khunde Rao GFaekwar to Mugon Purshotum (complainant), not hereditarily. 35. His Highness will dispose of the above as follows, bearing in mind that service has been dispensed with :— —The village of Goriad will be restored. 2nd and 'drd. —The revenues of the villages of Samra and Samree as based on the realizations of the current year will be continued to the complainant during his lifetime, and a moiety for one more life. 4/^ and bth. —The village of Simlackand the honorary allowance of Rupees 1,200 will be continued to the complainant for his lifetime. Khunde Rao's Family. No. 42. Anandrao Wishwasrao. ^6. This man complains that he has been deprived of his Paga with its allowances and of an inam \ illage. 37. The Paga was one entirely for service, and was withdrawn as service ceased to be taken from him. The Commission also observes that 4 ' it is not disposed to question the resumption of the Pagas of horse held by No. 2 {i.e., the complainant), and the mother of No. 6.' * * * 38. As to the inam village. His Highness will continue the revenue thereof as based on the realizations of the current year to the complainant during his lifetime. 39. The house property referred to by the complainant was bought with the money of the State. But if he produces the Deed of Sale held by him, as stated by the Resident, and if the deed be in his name, the house will be restored to him. 2.—Mu njoolabai. 40. His Highness has given this lady (his niece) no cause of complaint whatever. The only thing that was done was that she was removed from one house to another equally good, but neither of them belonging to her. Her own jewels worth about a lakh and a quarter of rupees she has taken with her to her house, for which there is a receipt in the Durbar. There are some things belonging to her mother which Jumnabai (her step-mother) had taken; and it is to be ascertained, Istly, from the list given to the Resident, which were Munjoolabai's mother's jewels; and Indly, whether Mu njoolabai has any right to them. Jumnabai as Ranee after Munjoolabai's mother's death claiming all for herself. When this is settled with the Resident action will be taken accordingly. 41. All Inamdars employ their own men for the protection of their inam. 3.— Kashee Rao Gunput Rao Raje Shirke. 42. He is a son-in-law of Khunde Rao Maharaja, and the husband of the No. 2. Because Khunde Rao chose to give him Rupees 12,000 per annum, it is not binding on the State to continue this allowance. Other son-in-law of Gun- put Rao Maharaja and Khunde Rao Maharaja are also getting Rupees 8,000, except one of Gunput Rao Maharaja who gets Rupees 9,000; and the allowance of this son-in-law (complainant) has been fixed at the same amount. The allowances of all, including villages, Tire Rupees 11,000, while that of the com plainant is Rupees 13,100. 43. His complaint about the howda is wrong. Rupees three thousand were given him to make a howda, which he has not made, but has used instead 21 f Exd,—J. M.22 a Sirkaree one, which he now elaims as his own. For the elephant he could not have received any money, because the elephant was not to be his property. 4.—China Saheb Luxumon Rao. 44 He is a distant relative, being the maternal uncle of Arababai (the first wife of the late Maharaja). He has no claims upon this State. .His High ness, however, will make him a gift of Rupees (2,500) two thousand and five hundred. , ~ r 5. Amrut Rao, natural son of the late Maharaja. 45. The Commission does not question the resumption of the Paga and jewels, and admits the justice of a reduction of his mother's allovyance. The other mistresses of Khunde 'Rao do not receive more. His mother is now dead, and the allowance will cease. His Highness, however, will allow the son Rupees ^2,400) two thousand and four hundred per annum during his lifetime. 46. The garden, Heerabaug, has always been Government property. Khunde Rao's followers. No. 45. Moonshee Habibulla. 47. He is one of those men who are personally most obnoxious to His Highness, and whom he would not wish to live in Baroda. 48. Taking all the circumstances of his case into consideration. His High ness will give him a lump sum of Rupees (40,000) forty thousand in cash and restore the village of Kadurpoora. 49. As to the village of Raneepoora, w^hich was granted by Khunde Rao only a few years ago, His Highness would have restored it to the complainant for life; but as he does not wish that this man should have any connection what ever with the State, he will give him a lump sum, equal to ten times the revenue of the village for the current year. No. 46. Chimnajee Luxumon Wagh. 50. This man is also one of those whom His Highness would not wish to live in Baroda. He claims the property to the value of Rupees 51,000. This is extremely improbable, as he was only a menial servant. His Highness, however, will give him a lump sum of Rupees 8,000 (eight thousand). No. 47. Golam Kader. 51. This man's case is similar to that of his brother, Habibulla (No. 45). The village of Kaderpoora will be restored; a lump sum of Rupees 30,000 (thirty thousand) will be given to him ; and a further sum equal to ten times the revenue of the village of Khanpoora for the current year will also be granted as in the case of Habibulla. No. 48. Yeshwant Rao Sakaram Manghikar. 52. His Highness will give this man Rupees 10,000 (ten thousand) in lump on condition that he lives out of Baroda. No. 49. Krishnajee Govindrao Jadow. o3. To this man also His Highness will give a lump sum of Rupees 7,000 (seven thousand). No. 50. Mahasook Nursidass. 54. His Highness will return to the complainant the fine of Rupees 15,000 as a favor.55. He may come and take charge of Jiis private property at any time, and also collect his outstandings. No. 51. Luxumibai, widow of Malharbhan Shalki. 56. The complainant's husband was guilty of a most serious offence. The value she puts on his property is extremely improbable. His Highness, however, will give her Rupees 20,000 (twenty thousand). No. 52. Bhagirtheebai, widow of Ganoo Wagh. 57. This case is nearly similar to the last. His Highness will give her Rupees 15,000 (fifteen thousand). No. 53. Parwuteebai, widow of the late Bhao Sindia. 58. As mentioned in the statement attached to case Noi 66, Schedule II., the amount of the whole property taken by the Durbar is under five lakhs of Rupees. His Highness will return this sum less the Durbars claims amounting to Rupees 1,43,879. The balance will be available for distribution- among the creditors of Bhao Sindia. 59. His Highness will also give to the widow a sum of Rupees 25,000 (twenty-five thousand) as a gift. 60. The widow has already received the money (amounting to about a lahh of* Rupees) deposited by Bhao Sindia in Gopal Rao Myrol's Firm. No. 54. Meroo Gudoo, Futesing Bhijee, and Jeysing Jora. 61. His Highness will give Rupees 200 (two hundred) to each of these men. They were mere runners before the carriage. No. 55. Gunput Rao Gangajee Goojur. 62. His Highness will give Rupees 200 (two hundred) to this man also. No. 56. 67 menial servants of Khunde Rao. 63. If those who complain having been deprived of their houses produce the title deeds which the Resident says are in their possession, and prove the properties to be their own, they will have the same or their money value returned to them. 64. His Highness will also give each of these men a gratuity of three months' pay. 65. No restriction now exists on any person leaving Baroda. No. 57. Choonilall Bapoobhai. 66 The revenue of the village, as based on the realization of the current vear will be continued to him pending enquiry into his title, on condition that he produces, before the Durbar, the documentary and other evidence m his possession in support of his claim. No. 58. Bapabhai Harivalub. 67 The village of Gamdi was granted by Sayajee Rao Gaekwar to Hari valub Ruttoniee hereditarily on service tenure. Service has been dispensed with. Hip Highness will, however, continue the revenue of the village as based 2324 on the realizations of the current $ear during the lifetime of the complainant and a moiety for one life more. Nothing is required to be done in the matter of the palkee allowance. No. 59. Mahadow Rao bin Godajee. 68. The complainant is a Patel; and the village of Maletha was granted to his father by Khunde Rao Maharaja only in 1917=1862 hereditarily onservico tenure. H&gt;'s Highness will continue the revenue of the village as based on the realizations of the current year during the lifetime of the complainant. Nothing is required to be done in the matter of the palkee allowance. No. 61. Lowjee Oomed (Gomasta of ChoonHall Dalcharam). 69. His Highness has allowed this man to collect his debts, remitted his fine, and cancelled the security-bond. No. 62. Choonilall Pitumber. 70. The village of Fazalpore was granted to the complainant's father bv ivhunde llao Maharaja in 1920=1864 hereditarily on service tenure. Service has been dispensed with. His Highness will, however, continue the revenue of the village as based on the realizations of the current year during the lifetime of the complainant. The palkee allowance was granted to his father, but not hereditarily. It was only an honorary grant to his father, and does not call lor restoration. Schedule III., No. 4. Amiha Ranchod. 71. This is a dispute about jewels between the complainant and his step- mother, and the action of the Durbar was taken consequent thereon. Amtha's Agent has already been informed accordingly. No. 5. Bnlwant Rao Gunesh. '2. In this case the intention of the late Maharaja was to make a grant o liupees 10,000 only, and he himself had resumed the surplus revenue. A sum ar grant was made at the same time to the chief Minister, Govind Rao Rore, and the same course was followed in his case also. His Highness will therefore continue a grant of Rupees (10,000) ten thousand. No.' 7. Bhanabkai Lalb/iai. 73. 1 he complainant has lately presented a petition to the Durbar, and his case is under investigation, but he often goes away and does not return for a ong time, and thus the delay is caused by himself only. No. 2 (see page 151 ^ seq.J Dowlut Chund Jahverechund. , Jfiohness still adheres to the promise made to, and approved of ^ e Commission, viz., either to pay for the jewels at a fair valuation or to re urn them, some reasonable consideration being allowed for interest. His ig mess is ready to send the jewels to the Bombay Government, or to submit them to a few respectable jewellers for valuation. No. 3. Mugonlall Ilukumchund. 75. His Highness is quite willing to adopt the suggestion ii;ade by the ommission, viz., to get such of the ornaments as are not broken up fairly \a uec, and to decide the value of the whole accordingly. Some consideration lor interest will also be shown.25 G Enclosure No. 12. No. 440-1472, dated Baroda, 27th December 1874.

On taking charge of this office, I found that the question of the Sir- dars, in ielation to the Gaekwar, had formed the subject of a leno-thened corre- spondenee, but that in this as in almost every other case on the^records of the esidency, no settlement or satisfactory arrangement had been arrived at. S - il1 ® 'jost recent letter on the file was one from Colonel Phayre to the Government ot Bombay, No. 411-1361 of the 2nd December, in which Colonel ia\ ie on being removed from office, submitted some statements of the Sirdar's Attormes, and concluded his transmitting letter with the following words:— Daring the past year I have so frequently pressed upon the notice of ^irther tcfit important nature of these cases that I refrain from alluding 4. This letter of Colonel Phayre's, with its accompaniment, has now been soiit t () me from the lohhcai Secretariat, Bombay, by transmitting letter No. von m 11 It I)e f n ; b Tv 1874 i . Iltimatin ^ that ' 'nder present circumstances vnn take such turther action in the matter of this representation as you (1) may think proper. . G- i be n ln your recolle ction that numerous complaints from the birdars, Silledars, &amp;c., were produced before the Commission of last vear and s t on ? e t 0 cases were 1 enquired, into, and that of these 40 the Commission accepted a few cases which had direct reference to the acts of the present Oaekwar; and it was for the disposal of these latter cases that on my arrival here, arrangements were made for enquiry being instituted at the Residency, as reported in my letter No. 431-1428 of 18th December 1874. 0. But I soon found that the debts, grievances, and complaints of the birdars, &amp;c., required a more extended investigation than that contemplated bv the Commission. Indeed, there appeared to be irritation almost approachin- exasperation on the part of the Sirdars towards the Gaekwar, and these anorv leelings appeared to me to have been increased by an injudicious or (to say the least of it) an inopportune act on the part of His Highness in according to the recently created Pntinidhi a cushion sent in the Durbar, thus siffnifVino- precedence over all the Sirdars. o j o 7. On the anniversary of the Gaekwar's birth-day, being 12th instant 1 observed that there was only one Sirdar present in the Durbar, and His Hin-h- ness aftei. wards explained that his Sirdars had been so accustomed to loolTto tne Residency that they had ceased to regard him: that they had refused to accept their last year's allowances; and that they now wished to contest his right to confer rank on his late Minister. . . 8 - A few da y s afterwards His Highness called on me to intimate that ins Sirdars had requested an interview with him, that he had accorded the same, and that during the interview disrespect had been shown especially on the part of Narayen Rao Raje Pandray, the head Mharatta Sirdar, who had ^one so far as to insinuate a threat to His Highness.q 1 hpowd His Highness to favour me with a memorandum of the inter- view, and a copy of it is uow enclosed. 10 On I lie following dav I asked the Minister for the precise meaning nf 11.P term used hv Pandray, and he informed me that its literal meaning was a ' third course,' hut that the intention was to convey a threat. 11 It seems that the Gaekwar at the interview desired his Sirdars to wait on me at the Residency and seek my advice, hut to this it appears Pandray raised some silly objections. However during the two following days, the Sirdars as a body sent their Attornies to me to request an interview. I named the following Tuesday, and an interview was arranged accordingly. 12 But on the morning of Ihe intervening Sunday the Gaekwar hurriedly called on me and intimated 'that Pandray had just met him on his drive and again insulted and threatened him, again objecting to go to the Residency. I explained to His Highness that while quite willing to give the benefit of my advice to the Sirdars, the Government of India would not tolerate on their part any disloyalty or breach of the general peace. I begged His Highness the Gaekwar to favour me with headings of what had passed between him and Pandray, and I now enclose a copy of His Highness' summary. 13.* His HHiness was much agitated, and expressed himself as having been in personal peril at the hands of Pandray. His Highness asked my advice and I sunested to him to inform Pandray that I expected the Sirdars accord- ino- to appointment; that if Pandray himself did not like to come he could stay away ; that I should inform His Highness of the results of the interview ; and that he could afterwards summon the Sirdars and explain his intentions. 14. On the Tuesday about 300 Sirdars and Silladars waited on me on the Residency grounds, and as they seemed to think that their dignity w r as concerned in coming armed, I permitted them to do so. Pandray was amongst them and appeared to me a diabolical Maratta. 15. I explained generally to the crowd my objects in meeting them, and then invited about 60 principal Sirdars to Durbar in the Residency where I explained to them the object of my mission to Baroda, and the utter confusion and mess into which that State had been brought by tolly, ignorance, partizan- ship, intrigue, and conceited pretensions. The Sirdars sat with me more than two hours, and were quite respectful and orderly. Enclosed is a clear, accurate, and sufficiently full memorandum of all that passed, drawn up by my native Assistant, Mr. Manibhai. I think the memorandum might be worth your reading, and from the subjoined quotation you will gather the mode of procedure which I suggested for the settlement of the debts, claims, and grievances of the Sirdars. ' That with respect to the case of the Sirdars two distinct questions had to be considered, viz:— ' 1^.—Their debts to Sowcars, and ' 2nd. —Their complaints against the Durbar. ' That as regards the first experience showed that by an amicable arrange ment with the Sowcars, the debts might be compromised and reduced, and the amount thus settled might be paid off by instalments extending over a series of years. Sir Lewis Pelly enquired of the Sirdars whether the Sowcars would be willing to agree to such an arrangement, and was assured that the Sirdars and Sowcars being mutually dependent upon one another, there would be no difficulty in arranging the matter in the way suggested. ' Sir Lewis Pelly then continued to say that as regards the Sirdars' com plaints against the Durbar, the best way of restoring a cordial understanding between them and His Highness, and redressing any just grounds of complaint that might exist, would be for the Sirdars as a body to select two respectable persons as mediators for them, the Durbar to select an equal number, and the four together should endeavour to establish harmony between the sovereign and his nobles. Sir Lewis Pelly expressed his willingness to offer his aid and advice in this matter whenever required. * * * * 2627 It was also explained that the object was to refer the matter to the medUaUon and arbitrament of a person or persons who enjoyed tin confidence o both parties ; that it instead of two members from each side, both concurred in selecting one particular individual that would be equally well.' 1(). On lollowing day the Gaekwar called on me, and I explained to His ilighness what had passed at the Durbar; His Highness assured me that the proci'cdings and suggestions had his entire approval, and that he would act accordin^lv. O J 17. Yesterday I read the memorandum to the Minister and afterwards ad dressed a note to him in view to obtaining an official assurance of the Gaekwar's views in the matter. Enclosed are copies of my note to the Minister and of his leply, intimating that 1 had correctly understood His Highness, i am informed Irom numerous quarters that since the interview the Sirdars have expressed themselves as being quite contented and re-assured. P . a S . ^ 28th December 1874.—The Sirdars have just now sent to me to sub mit that in an assembly of their pricipal men, they had resolved to take no steps w ithout consulting me, and to be entirely guided by my advice. No. 411-1861, dated Baroda, 2nd December 1874. 1 rom Colonel Phayre, C .B., Resident, Baroda, lo C. Gonne, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In loiwaiding, for the consideration and orders of Government, the accom- panying copy of a petition made this day before me by the representatives of the bndars, Silladars, &amp;c., of the liaroda State, I have the honor to express an opinion that the request herein made is a proper and indeed an absolutelv necessary one under the present eniergencv. Each case will have to be treated on its own merits, and involves an inves- igation of a searching and intricate nature. I have found the Sirdars them- sehes entire]} unable to state their own claims properly, and it has been only by much labour that I have been able to arrive at any satisfactory account of them. I nder these circumstances I am satisfied that unless some qualified British ofiicer is appointed to represent each case separately on its merits before the Special Commissioner, the rights of all petitioners of this class will be seriouslv piejudiced as it is obviously impossible for the Special Commissioner himself to spare suflicient time to go into the details of each separate case. . connection also with the same subject, I have the honor to invite the serious attention of Government to the fact that the Durbar only propose to eflect any specific settlement in eleven cases out of the w r hole number of forty enquired into by the Commission. It is obviously impossible that these proposals can be taken as an equitable solution of the difliculty involved in this important class of cases. Not only are the forty claimants before the Commission clamorous for a speedy settle ment of their claims, but numerous others, who w r ere present at the Commission but were hot examined, are awaiting an equitable settlement also. During the past year I have so frequently pressed upon the notice of Gov ernment the important nature of these cases that I refrain from alludinsr further to it. 3 T he undermentioned Kamdars on the part of the Sirdars, &amp;c., attended this day, 2 id December 1874, at the Hesidency, and begged permission to make the toil owing representations with which they have been entrusted bv their several Sirdars:— 1. Kamdar Gunput Rao Balajee on behalf of the Pandrey and Gorepurav Sirdars. * :2. Kamdar Kamrao Gopal and Moonshee Bulwunt Rao on behalf of Nawab Kumaloodeen Hoosein Ivban. S. Kamdar Bhiccajee Haree on behalf of Sirdar Dost Mohmed. I Kamdar Kamehundra Sudasheo Pomekur on behalf of Sirdar Meer Ibrahim Ali. In addition to the abovenamed Sirdars, these Kamdars state that they have been deputed by all the other Sirdars, Silladars and military classes of the Hoo- zoorat and Contingent to represent their cases as they at present stand. They represent as follows: That they have heard with much concern the contemplated removal of Colonel Phayre from the office of Resident. That through his mediation their grievances, claims, &amp;c., most of them of long standing, were first represented to Government and subsequently to the Baroda Enquiry Commission. That the enquiry into these claims, grievances, &amp;c., has been a work of creat intricacy and difficulty, and that unless each of these cases is adequately represented on its own merits, a satisfactory settlement cannot be expected for the following reasons :— Because His Highness the present Maharaja has from the first been not only unfriendly to their hereditary rights and interests, but has declared his intention of making reductions depriving them of those hereditary rights, wuttuns, &amp;c. Moreover, that this feeling has been heightened considerably since the sitting of the Baroda Commission. ^id. Because the pay and allowances of most of them have been in arrears for upwards of 3^ years, whereby in conjunction with other causes, they have been plunged in ruinons debts from which they are totally unable to extricate themselves. That an enquiry into their debts involves the investigation of trans actions extending over the last half a century and upwards, in all of which His Highness the Gaekwar has the utmost interest in suppressing the facts. 4^ That under present circumstances the acceptance of chittees as tendered by Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee, will afford no rel ef whatever, as the Parukhs refuse to make advances, being alarmed at the prospect of reductions. §th.—That the proposed reductions are not only contrary to the conditions of their service, which is hereditary, hut must involve them in utter ruin, quite independently of any present settlement of their cases which may be effected. 6^—That the reductions alleged by the Durbar to have been made on the score of economy, are not bond fide reductions at all, but merely consists in displacing old hereditary servants for new favorites. 7^,—That for the last year or two the Maharaja has taken every possible opportunity to degrade them on all public occasions. Under these circumstances, whatever may be the result of the arrangement now ordered by Government, we humbly solicit that a British officer may be appointed on our behalf to prosecute our individual claims and grievances before the Special Commissioner who has now been appointed by the Govern ment of India, with a view to their equitable and speedy settlement.

As His Highness has not been able to go to you, he has directed me to send you the enclosed translation of the notes taken of the conversation which took place at the interview. Dated Thursday Ma^sur Sood 9th 1931 = (17th December 1874-). Memorandum of the conversation that took place between His Highness the Maharaja Gaekwar and the Sirdars. His Highness asked the Sirdars ' what they had to say'? Thereupon, Yeshwant llao Haje Pandharay told his Karkoon to take out the yadi. The said yadi was taken by Ramrao, the Karkoon of the Nawab, and then Ramrao and other Karkoons came and sat in front of His Highness. Ham- rao took the yadi in his hand. In the meantime His Highness said that, ''if anv yadi was to be given, it should be sent to the Durbar, and that if the assemblage of Sirdars had to communicate anything they might do so by word of mouth, it was uot necessary for their Vakeels to say anything.' Upon this, the assemblage of Karkoons sat aside, and Naraenrao Kaje Pandharay said to His Highness that ' we have already once before represented, and we do now represent that our man pan (honors) should be continued to us as before.' His Highness said—' the same * man pan' is now continued as before. Tell me in what resptct it has been lessened ?' Narayenrao said—'invitations to attend two Kutcheries were received by us, but owing to the Gasha (square piece of embroidered cloth) of the Prati- nidhi, we did not come; we came to the Barsha (12th day) Kutcbery only.' His Highness then said—' the office of Pratinidhi being given to him, his (Pratinidhi's) Gasha must remain; the honor which he has received the Sahib has also given him; you are all aware that honor is given at Sattara to the Pra tinidhi.' Narayenrao Haje said—'In the time of the old Maharaja (Syaji Hao) \our Highness also sat without the Gasha.' His Highness said—' that was because he (the Maharaja Syaji Rao) w^as my father. He used to take us on the guddee also, and we sat below the guddee too. That therefore can't be properly taken into account. Formerly no one used to sit in front of you, but from the time of the old Maharaja (Syaji Rao) the son-in-law began to sit in front; and from the time of Khande Rao (Maharaja) the Senapati Nimbaji Rao began to sit in front, the Dewan used to sit on the opposite side, but from the time of Govind Rao Roday he sits in front of the Nawab. ' What is there in that ? Whatever honor we give it is but proper that you should give also. You are our brethern and by giving honor you honor yourselves.' Narayenrao Raje said—' pardon us for what has been said.' His Highness said—' you may came and say (whatever you like).' Then Narayenrao Raje said—'we hear many things, among which we hear also about 25 per cent.' His Highness said—' the whole Raj expense is Rupees 1,25,00,000. Therefore I reduce my own expenditure also, so you also should reduce your expenses, then all will be right. If not, it is not a mango tree that you may gather as you like. If revenue did not come whence am I to give ? At present the expenses have increased. Of this, how can the Sursoobha Department, Fouj-? dari, the Warisht Court, the Regiments be reduced as they are Departments of Administration. I desire to limit my expenses to whatever were those of the time of Syaji Maharaja. So all shoald limit their expenses according to that. ' I have suggested to Commissioner Sahih that he would give good advice to my Sirdars, and I would send them to him. lie has then agreed to that and said, ''send them from 2 to 3 o'clock to me, so has the conversation taken place. Then you should go to him.' The Narayen Ilao Raje said, ' Why should we go there ? Sirkar is our parents.' Thereupon His Highness said, ' You should go there. I am not re ducing your expenses only, I am reducing yours with that of all others.' Narayen Rao Raje said—' nothing less will he taken than the quarter pice (of bread) we are receiving, and if reduction is made some 'third' result will ensue (meaning a sort of increase). Then His Highness said—' Lhe expenses lay upon the whole Raj, so yours also will be reduced with that of others.'' Then Narayen Rao Raje and Eshwant Rao Raje said,—'TheDewan Sahib was saying that 25 per cent, will be reduced, and you say you would reduce the same as others; you are giving people lakhs of rupees and spend as you like, such being the case, is the expense increased on our account only ' ? Then His Highness said—' that time income was very large. Therefore it was so done. Now in come is reduced, so vours also will be reduced with that of others.' 7 » Naryen Rao Raji said—' Mohte Maharaja (Syaji Rao) was saying as long as the wire will remain in my wife's nose, I shall continue yours (allowance), such being the case you still say so. ' Therefore we should understand that we are dismissed.' Then His Highness said—'I have never uttered the word dismissed, and this will not be at my hands. ' For general expenses yours will have also to be reduced with others. As directed by saheb you should go from 2 to 3 o'clock. He has called you. I shall send the message as you may reply.' Esh want Rao Raje said,—' To-day my health is not good. We shall all consult to-day and go to-morrow.' His Highness said,—' It is very good to go there.' Then Narayen Rao Raje said to Yeshwant Rao Raje ' that it is not becom ing that we should go there.' Then His Highness said, ' He is superior, there fore you must go there.' Then Nawab Sahib said to His Highness to 'make a settlement about his jaghire.' His Highness replied that ' whatever is to be done will be done with sahib's advice. So you have to go there.' On Margrish Soodh 12th (Sunday)* His Highness had been to the Race ■ 20th December 1874 Course, when Naraycnji Eajay Pandhray came there and had the following conversation with His Highness :— His Highness asked the Pandhray why he had come there, and what he had to say. He replied that ' His Highness should call all the Sirdars and make an amicable settlement with them and not to allow them to go to the camp.' W r hereupon His Highness asked him, in what way the amicable set tlement should be made ? When the said Pandhray replied ' that His Highness should call them, and say that he would not make any reduction.' Upon this His Highness said that 'as there is a shortness in the income and increase in the expenditure, I have curtailed my own expenses; and so every ones (nemnook) ought to be curtailed. The said Pandhray Rajay thereupon said, we shall not take anything less; and upon our going to the sahib, we will clearly state to that effect; and by all of us going unitedly to the sahib, it would not look proper. Therefore it would be much better to arrive at a good understanding here. ' Whereupon His Highness asked what was to be done with the increased expenses ? You may, if you like, come to that Durbar, and see the increased expenses.' Thereupon the Pandhray replied, ' that they would not 3031 see the increased expenses ; nor was there any necessity of our doing so. We shall consider, if you wish, to submit to a reduction of one or two annas in our six monthly or yearly allowances; but we will not submit to the continued reduction of 25 per cent., nor is there any good in it, i.e., the result of all this will be unfavorable. MEMORANDUM. O n Tuesday, the 22nd December 1874, about 300 Sirdars, Sillidars, &amp;c., of the Baroda State attended at the Residency, by appointment, to have an inter view with Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly, K.C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General, and Special Commissioner, Baroda. They were headed by the Pandrays, the Ghorpady, the Nawab of Baroda, Meer Kumaloodeen, and Meer Ibrahim Ali, and were received at Durbar by Sir Lewis Pelly and the Assistant Resident, Mr. Richey. Sir Lewis Pelly addressed the Sirdars by saying that he had been deputed by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General on a special mission to Baroda, the affairs of which had for some time past attracted His Excellency's attention, that, as a rule, it was not the policy of the British Government to interfere in the internal affairs of Native Governments; but that, under excep tional circumstances, such as those of Baroda at the present time, intervention became a duty in the interests of the general poace and tranquillity of the country; that on his arrival at Baroda, he found the affairs in a very unsatisfac tory condition—discontent and disorder prevailed to a considerable extent, the wheels of Government were impeded, and the State laboured under financial difficulties, the expenditure far exceeding the income, a state of things under which no Government in the world could go on; that his instructions were to endeavour and see if a reconciliation could be effected between His Highness the Gaekwar and his Sirdars and other class of his subjects; the finances placed on a satisfactory footing, order restored, and a smooth working of the administration secured, that if this could be arranged, nothing would give him more satisfaction; but that if by opposition on the part of either His Highness the Maharaja, or his Sirdars and others, or both, such a course of action was found to be impracticable, it would be his painful duty to report the same to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, who would then take such steps as might be considered advisable. Sir Lewis Pelly expressed his hope, however, that honest and conciliatory action on the part of all concerned would avert the latter alternative; that he had offered his aid and advice to His Highness the Gaekwar, who had expressed his willingness to avail himself of it; and that he was therefore desirous of speaking to the Sirdars and hearing what they had to say ; that during his long course of service in different places, and as Agent to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General for States in Rajpootana, he had plenty of opportunities to be acquainted with persons of their rank and position, and that he could well appreciate their feelings; that with respect to the case of the Sirdars, two distinct questions had to be consi dered, viz.— 1st. —Their debts to Sowcars; and 2nd. —Their complaints against the Durbar. That as regards the first, experience showed that by an amicable arrangement with the Sowcars the debts might be compromised and reduced; and the amount thus settled might be paid off by instalments, extending over a series of years. Sir Lewis Pelly enquired of the Sirdars whether the Sowcars would be willing to agree to such an arrangement, and was assured that the Sirdars and Sowcars being mutu dly dependent upon one another, there would be no difficulty in arranging the matter in the way suggested. Sir Lewis Pelly then continued to say that as regards the Sirdars' com plaints against the Durbar, the best wav of restoring a cordial understandingi n:« TTJMinpss and redressing any iust '•rounds of complaint between them and U » ^ Sil . d . u . s as » , )() a v J ti0 » lwst two respectable that migbt cx !? ' u iem the Bur bar to select an equal number, and the persons as mec ia o\* ' ^ eS tabUsli harmony between the sovereign and four together shouM ende^vouiw ^^^ ^ to otfui , ^ J d aml his Nobles. ► n whpn( v Ve r required, and asked the Sirdars if they were advice in such a lao-le of settlement; adding that it would be prepeared to ^ ie „ meIlt to withhold their interyention in respect nooessary tor tne . diuimi vju necessary - to those who disagreed also explained that the object was to refer the matter to the media tion and arbitrament of a person or persons who enjoyed the confidence of both mrties ■ that if instead of two members from each side, both concurred in select- Fn^ one particular individual, that would do equally well. 0 Tlw. Smlars unanimously replied in the affirmative, and in doing so stated that they had been much gratified to learn that His Excellency the Viceroy nml Governor-General had been graciously pleased to depute to Baroda a Gentleman of Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly's position and reputation, and that they pi, inofipp would be done to them. They then adverted to their intimate connection with, and claims on, the State of Baroda, urging that their ancestors with the Gaekwar as their head, had won the country and established the W-u that their services on various important occasions were rewarded by or-mts of iaghires, inams, allowances, military service, &amp;c.; that these rights were hereditary, and inseparably connected with .the Gadee; in fact, that U kml - interests were identical with those of the State, though they owed allegiance and were subordinate to His Highness the Gaekwar as their recognized head; that their relations with the Gaekwar had always been sati ^Uctory, except for the last few years, when, in the time ot His late Highness Khunde Rao, the administration of the State, which till then had been in the hands ot the old and experienced servants of the State, was entrusted to new and inexperienced favorites; that these persons, with a view to benefit themselves at the expenst of the old and hereditary Sirdars, endeavoured to prejudice the mind ot the reisnin 0 ' Prince against them; and the unfortunate result had been that i a 'hires and inams were confiscated, their allowances stopped, even private pro perty of some of them carried away, and insults heaped upon them ; that the influence of the said evil advisers did not stop there, but also extended to o lei departments of the State, and ultimately culminated in the general migso\eru- ment, which called forth the intervention of the British Government As regards the debts, it was explained that they were first incurred at a time when the country was in a disturbed condition, and when conscquen \ their ancestors had, in order to retain their own prestige as militavv coinmaiK - ants, to engage the services of more men than their limited alun\ anees pei- raitted; that the debts so contracted, increased by interest, descended trom gene ration to generation, and were further augmented by the irreguuu m which their allowances were disbursed by the Durbar. The Sirdars then referred to the fact that His Highness the Gaekuai had lately given a seat of honour on a gold cushion to his late Minister an m w ) made Pritinidhi Nana Salieb Khanvelkur, and urged that this uivo \u an insult to their dignity as first class Sirdars of the State ; that even the heu appa rent to the Gadee occupied in the Durbar the same carpet as the Sinlai d am that the present action of the Maharaja was quite unwarranted by preen en Sir Lewis Pelly observed that questions like this would well come the arbitrators proposed to be appointed to bring about a cordial iinderstam mg between His Highness and the Sirdars, and added that he was well aware t hi the claims of the Sirdars who had assisted the Gaekwar in acquiring his vaj and performed other important services were deserving of great consideraumr, for instance, the Nawab of Baroda, whose family, as Sir Lewis Pelly persona y knew, was entitled to the greatest consideration, but that at the same time 32 Exd.—J. D. G.33 there were others who could be expected to submit to the necessities of the State and share its fortunes. The question of finance and the proposed reduction was then discussed- Sir Lewis Pelly observed that under present circumstances it was absolutely necessary that the expenses of the State should be curtailed, and a tinancial equilibrium restored. The Sirdars urged ihat such a course was no doubt desirable, but that the increase of expenditure that had been incurred ot late did not refer to the ordinary or legitimate expenses of the State, but to what they termed extraordinary, i.e., personal expenses of the reigning Prince; that their nemnooks, which were hereditary, had been fixed at a time when the revenue stood at about 65 lakhs, and that even with the proposed reduction in the rates of assessment, the present revenues would be more than what they formerly were; the Sirdars submitted that they were confident that by a proper management the expenditure could be brought within the income without effecting any reduction in their hereditary allowances, &amp;c. Sir Lewis Pelly said that if such a thing was practicable, he would give it his best attention, but he added that a regular military force had been orga nized during the last few years, and that anyhow reduction of expenditure was now an urgent necessity; that he was aware of the extraordinary personal expenses of the Maharaja, and that no doubt those would also have to be cur tailed. Sir Lewis Pelly here alluded to the recent case of the State of Kotah, the affairs of which had been thrown into disorder by internal disputes, &amp;c., that His Excellency the Viceroy had deputed him to restore order there; that he tried his best, but finding the task hopeless he reported accordingly to Government, and the result was known to all present; that no settlement was possible here, if the ryots pulled at one side, the Gaekwar at the other, and the Sirdars at the third; that a cordial understanding and mutual co-operation were essentially necessary to restore things to order. Sir Lewis Pelly advised the Sirdars to be quiet and respectful to their sovereign, and not allow themselves to be implicated in any act of distuibance or defiance of lawful authority; that if a breach of the peace occured, blame would attach to them if to any one; and His Excellency the Viceroy would hold them responsible; that it should be clearly understood that the British Government could not lend their aid in obtaining a just settlement ot their grievances, unless they remained loyal and faithful to theit sovei eign am strictly maintained a quiet and respectful behaviour. The Sirdfu-s repeatedly assured Sir L-wis Pelly that they would scrupu lously adhere to their loyal and quiet conduct as hitherto. The Sirdars then submitted that their allowances were in arrears for about three vears, and that since the receipt of His Excellency the Viceroy s orders on the Commission Report the Dewan, Mr. Dadabhai, had issued a circular proclaiming a reduction not exceeding 25 per cent, m their nemnooks; that this alarmed the Sowcars, who stopped making the customary advances to the Sirdars; that on the latter's representations, however, the Durbar promised to cancel the circular and notified their intention to the Bankers, and told them to continue to pay the Sirdars as before; but that no cancelling order having as yet been issued the Bankers refused to make any payment until that were done. Sir Lewis Pelly replied that he bad been iaformed by the Durbar that last year about 12 laklis of rupees were ready to be disbursed to the Sirdiirs, but that the latter refused to receive the money ; that he was unable to ta ke any action in a matter of this sort, which would properly come before the proposed Punchayet; that if he were to issue an order cancelling the ^ as the Sirdars seemed to expect, he would be taking the affairs ofthebtata under his direct management; that such a course materially impaued the authority of the Durbar, which he was most anxious to maintain, and that lie wished that all measures of reform and acts of authority should emanate Iromthe head of the State. He hoped, however, that when it was known that the Sirdars and His Highness were meditating an amicable arrangement the confi dence of the Bankers would be restored, and that there would be no difficulty about advances pending settlement. The Sirdars stated that in some cases cheques received by them from the Durbar had remained uncashed, payment having been refused by the State Banks. Sir Lewis Pelly desired them to bring some of these cheques to him when he would adopt measures to satisfy himself that no payment could be obtained. The Sirdars then alluded to the cases of Radhan Meeya, Dhundheray, Kudum, Hurplay, &amp;c., and requested that as the Durbar had entirely stopped their allowances, it might be arranged to give them an advance for mainten ance. Sir Lewis Pelly enquired whether their cases had been already disposed of or were pending. On the Sirdars stating that the latter was the case. Sir Lewis Pelly promised that, after reference to the records, he would see if such an arrangement could be made. Some of the Maratha Sirdars presented a petition to Sir Lewis Pelly about their caste differences with His Highness in the matter of dining with Rukhmajee, the father of Luxmee Baee, with whom His Highness had recently contracted a marriage; they were told that there being more important work . on hand, the matter must be postponed, and that in the meantime the Sirdars might dine with Bukhmajee or not as they pleased, the question being purely a social one. The Sirdars then thanked Sir Lewis Pelly for the trouble he had taken, and expressed themselves much gratified at the result of the interview. After a distribution of pan soparee the Durbar closed.

R everting to the subjects of the debts, claims, and grievances of the Sir dars and the Sillidars, you are aware that by His Highness' desire the principal Sirdars, &amp;c., waited on me at the Residency and discussed matters at consider able length. My suggestions were that the Durbar should appoint one or two trust worthy persons, and that in like manner the Sirdars should appoint one or two trustworthy persons to enquire into and adjust the debts, claims, and grievances of the classes. I added that in the event of a difference arising in any parti cular case as between the representatives of His Highness and of the Sirdars, a reference might be made to me and I should be happy to afford advice to the best of my abitity. . Subsequently I had a personal interview with His Highness on- the above su )jects, and I understood him entirely to approve and sanction the proposed mode of proceeding in respect to the settlement of these very troublesome, hazardous questions.

Sir L. P elly , K.C.S.I., Agent, Govr.-Genl. and Special Commr., Baroda, To—C. Gonne , Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 7655 of 17th instaDt, concerning the circumstances attending the alleged marriage of His Highness the Gaekwar with Luxmee Baee, and the birth of a son to His Highness; forwarding also a khureeta from the Viceroy to the address of the Gaekwar to be delivered to him. 2. It appeared to me that if I at the present moment carried into effect the instructions contained in paragraph 2 of the Government of India letter No. 2739P. of the 12th instant, I might tend to reagitate the public mind in the Gaekwar's territories in regard to the rights of the infant. For ' to cause such honors to be paid as are usual on the occasion of the birth of a son to the Gaekwar'.' might lead the nobles and other classes to the conclusion that the Government of India recognized the legitimacy of the infant, and that the infant would in all probability inherit the Gadee. And the entertain ment of this inference by those classes might, I think during the present crisis prove inconvenient. 3. Accordingly I submitted a telegram to the Foreign Secretary request ing permission to suspend action in the matter until His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council should receive my present report. My request was acceded to, and the khureeta remains with me. 4. In a matter of this kind and under the peculiar circumstances in which this State now finds itself, time is on our side, and I would deferentially sug gest that the khureeta be left undelivered for the present; and that when it shall - be delivered care be taken to avoid all risk of the community in general being led to attribute to the khureeta any tenor or intention other than the bald acknowledgment of the Gaekwar's khureeta announcing the birth of the infant.

Aitchison, Esq., C.S.1., Secy, to the Government of India, Foreign Dept. I have the honor to forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter No. 1-6, I have this day addressed to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, on the subject of appointing a Vakeel at the Gaekwar's Court. No. 1-5, dated Baroda, 1st January 1875. From— Col. Sir Lewis Pelly, K .C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General and Special Commissioner, Baroda, To—C. Gonne, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Dept. I n the very numerous 4 ' cases in which British Indian subjects are sub mitted to the jurisdiction of the Courts of His § Not less than ioo per annum. Highness the Gaekwar, it appears to me highly desirable that a competent Vakeel or Agent should be employed to watch the procedure, and when advisable to represent the British subject, as within my experience w T as the practice whenever our representative in the Persian Gulf surrendered a subject to the jurisdiction of the Eoreign Courts. 2. In the cases of otfences alleged to have been committed by British subjects, and in which they have been apprehended by the officers of the Gaekwar, it is the practice that the Durbar should send information of the arrest and nature of offence charged to the Resident; and after the conclusion of the proceedings it is the rule that execution of the sentence should be deferred until the record has been submitted to the Resident, and the sentence received his concurrence. The rigid fulfilment of this procedure has been, to a certain extent, evaded by the Gaekwar, but it is obvious that even if strictly adhered to it hardly offers sufficient guarantees for a prompt trial of the accused persons, and does not preclude the possibilities of rigorous or unfair treatment which it is impossible to ignore as likely to exist under the lax rdgime of a Native State. 3. In illustration of my remarks I would beg to invite attention to the orders conveyed in the Resolutions of Bombay Government, Nos. 2101, 1179, 4984 and 5528, of 22nd May 1871, 4th March 1874, 28th August 1874, and 24th September 1874, respectively. It will be seen that in three of the Reso lutions cited the Resident was directed to watch the proceedings of the Baroda Courts in criminal cases, and in the fourth that the Government appearing as a party in a civil case desired to be represented in His Highness' Court. I need hardly point out that for such purposes a competent and trained Vakeel is the proper person to represent either private or public interests. 4. I believe further that it would be of great service in removing causes of complaint in connexion with the administration of justice in His Highness' Courts, if a Vakeel representing British interests were accorded an official position in those Courts, whose duty it would be to watch the procedure, and 37 • Kwhen so ordered by the Resident to attend the trial in the cases of British subjects apprehended or surrendered for offences alleged to have been committed in the Gaekwar territory. 5. If the Vakeel so employed were allowed, as are the Government Officers and Pleaders in the Mofussil Courts, to take private practice where not incompatible with his official duties, it is, I think, probable that a low rate of remuneration would be sufficient to secure the services of a competent man of 'ood standing, on this point Government can doubtless obtain trustworthy in formation in the Judicial Department; the object of this letter is rather to bring the subject before Government as one which in my opinion calls for early consideration than to submit detailed proposals which may be matured without delay if the Government desire that the suggestion should be carried out.

T he Government of India having telegraphed to me to send certain documents of great importance (connected with the recent attempt to poison the late Resident) to Calcutta by special hand, it occurred to me that the safest and generally most complete manner of obeying this instruction would be to request the Commissioner of Police himself to take charge of the docu ments, and thus be on the spot to submit any further information which the Viceroy in Council may require. 2. Accordingly I have requested Mr. Souter to start hence to-morrow morning direct for Calcutta, where he will arrive on the night of Monday next. 3. I trust that His Excellency in Council will concur with me in con sidering that the course adopted is the most advisable, and that the absence of the Commissioner of Police from bis own duties for a few days longer may not prove inconvenient to His Excellency's Government.

The necessity for absolute secrecy and the urgency of the communication made the transmission of a copy imprac ticable.

I beg to express the high consideration and esteem I entertain for Your Excellency, and to subscribe myself. Enclosure No 6. No. 433-1431, dated Baroda, 19th December 1874. From— Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly, K.C.S.I., Agent, Governor-General, and Special Commissioner, Baroda, To— C. U. Aitchison, Esq., C .S.I., Secy, to the Govt, of India, Foreign Dept. A mong the instructions contained in paragraph 9 of your Office letter No 1586P., dated 25th July 1874, is the following ;— ' He the Gaekwar should be advised ' * ' to prohibit the barbarous processes employed for realizing revenue, and to remove the c iuse of such difficulty by 1 Aa moderate and equitable land settlement and a faithful adherenee to its terms in future, all future exactions of every sort or description being absolutely interdicted, and the continuance of such oppressive practices on the part of Durbar officials being strictly forbidden.' 2. On arrival at Baroda I found that proclamations forbidding the prac tices noticed had already been issued. I append copies for facility of reference, although they have already been included among the appendices of my No. 431-1428 of 18th instant. 3. As regards the introduction of a moderate and equitable land settle ment, yad No. 2274, with enclosure, now appended, shows what has already been done by the Gaekwar officials, and what the views of the Durbar are on the subject. 4. The Cazee Shahaboodeen, who was for many years employed in our Revenue and other Departments, and who was subsequently entrusted with the Dewanship in Kutch, is at present the head of the lie venue Department in the Baroda territories. He is on all hands admitted to be a man of great natural ability and well qualified by training for the task he has undertaken. I have had many conversations with him on the revenue question; and shall shortly have the honor of submitting an English version of an elaborate report which the Cazee has just now concluded concerning the past, present, and future assessments. 5. The Cazee is hopeful and, indeed, confident that if he be not interfered with, he will be enabled to complete a satisfactory and equitable settlement. G. Meantime, on my arrival here, I found this llesidency invaded by numerous patels and their attornies, principally from the districts of Petlad and Nowsaree. For one or two days I listened to their complaints, and found them to be generally as follows :— ls^.—That the Gaekwar Government was pressing the cultivators for arrears of land revenue for a period of eight years ending with the close of the last revenue year. 2ncl. —That the assessment during those years had been and still continued oppressively high. 7. On communicating with the Minister concerning these complaints, he informed me that the assessment was undoubtedly too high having due regard to present market prices; that the Ilevenue Department was revising the settlement witfi all practicable speed; that for the current year it was proposed to take a liberal view of individual eases before exacting the fourth instalment of four annas in the rupee; and that the Ministry hoped before the close of the current year to be in a position to notify a reduced rough settlement for a short term of years, at the conclusion of which the available statistics might be expected to be sufficiently reliable to form the basis of a more scientific measure. 8. It appeared, however, that, for the present, the agricultural classes were, in many districts, in a state of (what the Minister termed) ' passive resistance' to the collection of the Government revenue. 9. The Minister explained the causes of this unhappy condition of affairs to be— First. —That the assessment was or had been unquestionably excessive. Second. —That during the past year or so the agricultural classes had been led in part by our acts of minute and direct interference with the domestic affairs of the Gaekwar State to look to our Government for support in their resistance to the Durbar, and had come to consider the British Residency as a sort of Court of appeal. 10. After enquiring into this almost dead-lock in affairs, and after con fronting the patels, &amp;c., with the Minister and the Head of the Revenue3 Administration, the following seemed to me to be the most serious matters for consideration :— Ist. —That the origin of the present revenue difficulties was to be found among the consequences of the rebellion in the United States. The Baroda terri tories include a large portion of the richest soil in Guzerat; and during the rebellion the most remunerative crop on this soil was cotton. The price of cotton then rose from two or three pence up to two shillings per pound, and the breadth of land brought under cotton was widely extended, while the area under other crops was proportionately reduced. Hence prices and rents rose simultaneously. As a general result the cultivators were enabled to pay an extraordinarily high land assessment. Prices and rents being thus abnormally high, a revenue settlement for a period of ten years was introduced: while the purse of the State was recklessly opened to satisfy or increase miscellaneous stipends and other demands, which, under a normal condition of affairs, would probably have been refused. It does not appear that a balance sheet was prepared in those days. Presently, the price of cotton suddenly fell; but the land settlements and the increased stipends remained in force. Thus the agriculturalists became gradually unable to meet the Government demand on their land, and year by year fell into arrears of payment. I understand that down to the close of the past revenue year, Sumbut 1930, the arrears of land revenue within the Gaek- war territories have aggregated from seventy to eighty lakhs of rupees ; that the last instalment of the past year (1930) has remained almost wholly unrealized; and that the cultivators have persisted in a passive resistance to the payment of any instalment whatever during the current year 1931. Meantime the Sirdars, Silladars and others of the military classes and non-industrials, finding their allowances, &amp;c., clipped, resumed, or in arrears became discontented. 2nd. —I considered that, however advisable direct and minute intervention with the domestic affairs of a Native Protected State may be, under abnormal circumstances of general misrule, it was apart from the ordinary policy of Government, and liable to impair the authority of the Native Government, that the residence of the representative of the paramount power should permanently become a tribunal for hearing individual and miscellaneous complaints of the discontented subjects of that State. 3rd. —It seemed to me that the financial condition of the Baroda State rendered it necessary that in order to an adjustment of their mutual misunder standings and grievances, both Prince and people should in some degree abate their demands and pretensions. 11. Accordingly, and after being requested to advice on the general embroglio I suggested that a proclamation should at once be issued promising liberal remissions in respect to arrears of revenue, and careful enquiry into present demands. 12. The Minister and the head of the Revenue Department concurred with me, and a Draft Proclamation was prepared and submitted to His High ness who approved its provisions, but subsequently suggested certain modifica tions in regard to arrears. These suggestions were referred to me for advice and were not adopted. 18. Eventually (that is to say last night) a Proclamation, of which English and Guzeratee versions are now enclosed, was issued to the several Revenue Divisions. 14. The principal features of this Proclamation are— ls^.—That it reduces the rate of assessment wherever reduction is found to be equitable, and promises to carry these reductions into effect not later than the date on which the last instalment foils due. 2nd. —It promises a publication of assessments. 3rd. —It promises an absolute and total remission of arrears in respect to the five years intervening between the commencement of 1923 and the close of 1927.Wi.—It promises that in regard to arrears clue for the years 1928-29-30 no demand slmll be made against any enltivator unless after full enquiry made into the particulars ot each case, and more particularly into the present condition of the cultivators concerned. ^ ome () ^ patels and their attornies contiuned their complaints at the Residency even after receiving the promise that the above liberal treatment would be accorded to them. But I explained to them that the promises having )eon made In the(jaekwars 3liulster in my presence, I should now expect the cultn ators to return to their villages and peaceably and loyally cultivate their lands. I am informed that the cultivators have followed this advice. But want of confidence in the assurances of their Rulers is among the principal causes of the discontent which has widely spread in the Baroda territories, and nothing less than an undeviating adherence to promises which may now be made can restore confidence : of this truth the Minister is fully aware.* Translation of Yad No. 2274 of 1874. All Dow an has submitted to me a summary of the conversation which took place between you and him concerning the prohibition of the barbarous processes employed for realizing the revenue, and the introduction of a moderate and equitable settlement.

Translation of Circular issued on A shwan S hoodha 15th, Surabut 1931. (Appended to yad No. 2274 of 1874.) at «q 0 .y d . ers tlat ® d Slirawai1 Shoodha 9th, No. 42, and Badrapad Shoodha 12th, i o. 89, it is directed that measures should be taken in the matter of collectin'- and and other revenue to prevent ill treament on the part of Collecting officers of the persons by whom money is due, and that in default of payment hv those from whom revenue on account of land, salami, cash imports/and other precribed ue '^e same should be recovered in the manner below , \ Care should be taken that the Mohsul Horseman or foot does no act unauthonzedly towards the defaulter, and that he takes from the latter only the fixed rations for himself and for his horse (if a horseman), the Moh sul fee to be levied in addition to the Rations should be fixed in reference to 4 Exd.-J. D. g.V the account to be recovered and the ability of the defaulter to pay. The fee should be credited to Government. 2. If the defaulter be cultivator of Government land, his right of posses sion should be sold by auction. 3. Such property as is liable to be sold in satisfaction of a decree in a civil suit should be sold by auction to the extent of the account of the demand according to the provisions of the Civil Code. 4. The above three modes are prescribed, but if it appears to the Collect ing Officer that the defaulter is able to pay, and is only withholding payment with a fraudulent intention, the Collecting Officer is to have power to detain the defaulter in the Kutchery. In exercising this power care should be taken that the defaulter is not made to stand in the sun, beaten, made to hold his toes, and such other cruel and oppressive treatment or any other kind of torture is not employed. The talooka authorities should not have the power to detain a man in the Kutchery for more than ten days without the Sirsooba's orders. 5. Farmers shall have the power of sending Mohsuls according to clause 1, subject to appeal to the Wahiwutdar. But they shall have no powers to act upon clauses 2 and 3. Should a farmer find it necessary to put those clauses in force, he should apply to the Wahiwutdar, who, if he thinks it necessary to assist the farmer, should make a record to that effect, and act upon the clauses. 6. It has come to knowledge that Village Accountants sometimes behave in an oppressive way towards cultivators, strict supervision should be exer cised to prevent this. 7. Any one acting contrary to this order should be held strictly an swerable, and adequately punished. Such are the orders from the Huzoor. On this I have to write as follows :— 1. The first clause is about Mohsuls. The rations of the Mohsul Sowar or foot to be two seers and one adhole and not more on any account. The Mohsul fee should be fixed in reference to the amount to be recovered and the ability of the defaulter to pay. A Mohsul chit should be written and the reason for imposing the Mohsul should be entered therein, a full copy of it being kept on record. No Mohsul should be sent without a chit. The Mohsul fee should be credited to Government. 2. Clauses 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 should be carefully acted upon. 3. According to clause 5 you should inform the farmers in your districts, and should a farmer or a defaulter apply to you, you should act according to the provisions of that clause. 4. You will explain these orders to the Karkoons and other servants under you and report at once any infraction ot them. Act upon this. Dated Ashwan Shoodha 15th, Sumbut 1931. PROCLAMATION. I t having been ascertained that owing to the fall in prices the rates of assessment press heavily on people, the Sirkar has resolved to relieve the ryots from this pressure by reducing the rates wherever reduction is found to be equitable. Accordingly, a complete enquiry is being instituted, and wherever it be found that reduction is necessary, such reduction will be carried into effect as early as possible, but not later than the date on which the last instalment falls due. All local revenue officers, patels, &amp;c., are hereby required to notify and explain to the cultivators the object of this Proclamation, and the patels are hereby warned that if after receipt of this Proclamation the instalments of the present assessment due before the reduction is made be not satisfied, payment will be enforced, and the responsibility of the patels in aiding the district revenue officers will be insisted on. 5 B0 Iii districts where Narwndari tenure prevails, a statement shewing the necessary alterations to he made in the Jummahundee will be prepared and explained within the period of one month from this date. In the remaining districts, the assessment enquiry is being prosecuted and will be completed and made public as soon as practicable. As respects arrears of revenue, the Sirkar, having equitable regard to the fallen prices, hereby notifies that an nifesolute and total remission ol arrears is granted in respect to those from the year 1923 down to the conclusion ol the year 1927. In regard to the arrears due for the years 1928, 1829, and 1830, the Sirkar has resolved that no demand for arrears shall be made against any cultivator for arrears of revenue, unless after full enquiry made into the parti culars of each case, and more particularly into the present condition ot the cultivators concerned.

It will be seen from the Durbar yad now forwarded that, although professing to accede to my request to advance to the military classes from four to six months' pay on account of their arrears up to the end of last year (Sumbut 1930), the Durbar endeavour to entangle that simple and reasonable transaction with the entirely separate subject of prospective arrangements from the year Sumbut 1931 inclusive, and it will be seen from my reply, now forwarded, that I have carefully avoided mixing up the emergent payment of 3^ years' arrears with the authoritative advice of Government tendered in my yad No. 1502 (C7.), dated 12th August 1874. 4. I respectfully submit that I cannot but regard the Durbar reply now forwarded, after a month's interval, as confirmatory of the general system of evasion to which I adverted in paragraphs 7 to 11 of my letter of the 20th October above quoted.5. So far as I am informed, the classes in question are most anxious to receive bond fide advances on account of their arrears, and will sign properly worded receipts for such advances, but that they decline to mix up prospective arrangements with their bond fide claims of past years. Translation of Durbar yad No. 2079, dated 18th November 1874. R esidency yad No. 1982, dated 20th October 1874, has been received, in which it is stated for our consideration that as some time would elapse before each individual case would be decided, four to six months of the pay due should be paid to them in the interim, according to circumstances. Vs ith regard to this, we beg to state that according to your suggestion four to six months' pay is to be given to them on account of arrears, but we have prepared chittees up to the end of Sumbut 1930, and our Dewan has arranged to pay them personally. And if any of the Commission case persons have been dismissed, they too will be paid something according to your sugges tion. But some have stated their unwillingness to accept anything unless their cases are settled, while others bring forward other new causes for not receiving the chittees. Those reasons are the following, viz., as it is our intention to reduce the jummabundee, and as for this and other reasons the revenues will be less, and as we have been advised to pay the officials well, it will be necessary to make a reduction in the expenditure; we have therefore warned every one that if necessary, the allowances, &amp;c., will be reduced; but that such reduction will at most be 25 per cent, and will be regulated according to justice. On account of this they state that the Parekhs refuse to pay them in full, and request that the Parekhs may be directed to pay them in full; the Parekhs were accordingly directed to do so, and yet they finally state that unless it is decided that their allowances are not to be reduced, they will not receive the chittees; urging these objections no one comes for their chittees. You will easily see how improper this their reply is. No. 2217, dated 24th November 1874. From— Col . R. Phayre , Resident, Baroda, To—His Highness the Maharaja Gaekwar of Baroda. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Durbar yad No. 2079, dated 18th instant. A reference to my yad No. 1982, dated 20th October 1874, paragraph 2, will show that my advice to Your Highness was confined to advances on account of arrears of pay in order to relieve the immediate and emergent wants of the military classes in question. In the Durbar yad under reply reductions are alluded to which cannot affect the arrears of pay to which I referred, viz., arrears up to the end of Sumbut 1930. Any reductions affecting these classes which Your Highness may have in contemplation for Sumbut 1931 and prospectively is a separate subject with which I cannot interfere except in accordance with the advice of Government communicated in the last two paragraphs of my yad No. 1502(C7), dated 12th August 1874.

No. 412-1362, dated Baroda, 3rd December 1874. From— Colonel R. Phayke, C .B., Resident, Baroda, To—C. Gonne , Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I n submitting to Government the enclosed khureetas f from His Highness t In . separate packet. !, he . Gf ekv y ar dated 1st iustant to the address of their Excellencies the Viceroy and Governor-Gene ral and the Governor of Bombay, I have the honor to offer the following observations. 2. With reference to paragraph 4, I regret to state that His Highness the Gaekwar has not up to the present time carried out any of the settlements agreed upon between myself and His Highness' Minister, in consequence, it is represented, of the personal obstruction of His Highness the Maharaja. 3. A\ith reference to His Highness' statement that in the majority of cases I held extreme views, I can only state that the general tenor of those views is well known to Government, and that I have fully represented from time to time the general principles on which all my negotiations were conducted. I would invite special attention to the accompaniment A of my letter No. 343-1168 oi the 20th October 1874, and to the proposals generally made by me lor the settlement of Commission cases. Under these circumstances, it is for Government to decide whether the views expressed by me, which accord gener ally with the action taken by Government under similar circumstances, are extreme or not. At the same time I think it right to state that the views which are adverted to by His Highness the Gaekwar as extreme views were expressed by me at Mr. Hadabhai's earnest request in a private and confidential way with a view to t llecting an amicable settlement of the cases then under notice. The views thus expressed have never been officially promulgated and cannot compromise Government in any way. The course moreover pursued by me was in strict accordance with the instructions of Government communicated to me in clause 1, paragraph 6, of their confidential letter No. 22P., of 6th August 1874. 4. Paragraphs 6 to 20 inclusive of the khureeta under notice contain a statement oi the general principles to which His Highness the Gaekwar would wish to appeal in carrying out the instructions of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General with regard to the settlement of all Commission cases. It will be seen that the general purport of all the extracts which are quoted in support oi the principles therein laid down is to the effect— Isf. That the will of the Ruler is supreme, and that all grants of what ever sort or description made by a Ruler are resumable at pleasure. 8 Eid.—J. T. F.^u\ 2nd. —That holders of alienations (jaghires, enams, wuttans, nemnooks, &amp;c.) have no recognized rights whatever as against the Ruler of the State for the time being. 3rc?.—That adoptions, in all cases whatever, are subject to the will of the Ruler, irrespective of the custom of the country, the nature of the services, or the claims of the family. From these general principles the obvious inference is sought to be drawn that all the reductions, resumptions, and arbitrary and unjust acts of every description which have been so strongly animadverted upon by the Commission and by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General are in strict accordance with the custom of the country and of other Native States in India. 5. But it will be observed that whilst His Highness the Gaekwar has been thus advised by Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee to claim for himself the widest prero gatives of oriental sovereignty, and to appeal to them as the standard by which a settlement of the present cases should be negotiated, he ingeniously endea vours to divert attention from the legitimate inference deducible from this posi tion by stating that he merely brings these principles to the notice of Govern ment, ' not with any desire to evade the advice of the British Government or to adhere strictly to them in dealing with the present cases, but with a view to appeal to His Excellency's sense of justice, whether as regards these complaints he should be asked to subject his acts to a standard which is so foreign to the traditions, usages, and sentiments of Native Governments. 6. It will not fail to be noticed that the standard so earnestly deprecated by His Highness the Gaekwar in the passage above quoted is no other than that which is laid down in His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General's khureeta of the 25th July last, and in my several yads embodying the autho ritative advice directed to be given in Government of India letter No. 1586P. of 25th July 1874. Under these circumstances it is difficult to see how the Gaekwar's present claim to be judged by an absolute Native standard, is con sistent with the reformed and more modern standard of the rights and respon sibilities of civilized Government, so clearly enunciated in His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General's khureeta of 25th July last. 7. The clearest proof that the standard of Native rule to which His Highness the Gaekwar appeals is not a standard which can equitably or reason ably be accepted by Government in the settlement of pending cases, is shown by the fact that Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee, in the detailed proposals submitted with the khureeta under notice, has in fact adopted, to a considerable extent, in many instances, the very principles which I have myself advised, on the recom mendations of the Commission, and which he has, as above noticed, denounced as extreme. In fact, although I consider the proposals now made to be in many instances wholly inadequate to the serious nature of the claims adduced, yet it is to be observed that these proposals are considerably in advance of those expressed to me by His Highness' Minister at the commencement of negotia tions, and are altogether inconsistent with the theory that none of the com plainants have any rights whatever, except so £ar as the will of the Ruler may be pleased to recognize them. 8. With the object therefore of assisting my successor and enabling Government to form a fair opinion on the character of the proposals made, I proceed to notice seriatim the proposals submitted. 9. Paragraphs 1 to 31 of the statement accompanying the khureeta under notice contain the proposals of His Highness the Gaekwar relating to the settle ment of eleven cases relating to Sirdars and the Military classes. Before ad verting to the proposals submitted in these cases, it is material to notice that this settlement is confined to a very limited number only of the cases submitted to the Commission, the remainder apparently being dismissed as requiring no notice whatever by the Durbar on the ground that the Commission have stated that they did not feel called upon to record any opinion regarding them.in Tt thus aonears that His Highness the Gaekwar wishes to evade any l t the remaining eases under notice, although they are quite as settlement o f timsp which are taken up by the Durbar, and although emergent as an\ o , ^ _[ ace regarding them during the last 18 months. much correspondence has takenpi^ th - settlement of In short, the propo &lt; ^ w liole Sirdar's case* is so obviously inadequate ' ' as to amount to a palpable evasion of the advice bv ni s Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General to effect an equitable settlement of all cases of tins nature. , ■ . n With reference to the eleven cases of Sirdars adverted to by the Dnrbarin the statement under notice, I have to remark that I am of opinion tliat the proposals made are as a whole wholly inadequate and bear no reason- able relation to the specific claims and grievances of each petitioner It will be remembered that in each instance the claims of petitioners relate to the lollowingjwmts^—^ aml allowa noe for various periods averaging three and a half years. , , , • 2nd Settlement of debts for subsistence for themselves and retainers contracted in consequence of such arrears and extending in many instances over a great number oi ^cais. 3rd —In cases of contemplated reduction, provision for the future, either bv pension or gratuity or compensation according to the nature and length of service of claimant, i.e., hereditary or otherwise. 4^ Similar provision for armed dependants and retainers of Sirdars thrown out of employment after various periods of service. 5/^ Compensation for illegal seizure of horses and other private property of Sirdars. 12. The mere enumeration of these points will show that the proposals of the Durbar to dispose of the cases summarily by the grant of lump sums without reference to the bond fide details of each case, must involve the peti tioners and those dependant upon them in utter ruin, to the serious danger of the peace of the country. 13 The only other remark which I think it necessary to make applies to e„ e No'. 14. Appendix o, n.rod. the cases of Madhow Rao Dhnndheyra, paragraph Commission's Report. 24) of the Statement, and Shah Arahomed Ivadhan Meeva, paragraph 25, the first having held a Paga for several generations ^ in the British Contingent of 3,000 horse, and the Case No. 15, Appendix o. second having held a jaghire, enam village, and hereditary military service in the Hoozoorat of His Highness the Gaekwar. 14. In both of these cases the petitioners' main grievance is that they have been reduced to utter ruin through the refusal of the present Maharaja out of purely personal motives to confirm the right of adoption, and further that they have been deprived of private property to a considerable amount. In both instances the petitioners are the representatives of two of the oldest and most distinguished families in the Gaekwar State. 15. In the case of Dhundheyra two successive adoptions have, as admitted by the Durbar, already taken place, and in the present instance the customary recognition of the Maharaja, though alleged to have been at first accorded, has since been withdrawn merely for the purpose of enriching Nana Saheb Khanvelkur at the petitioners' expense. 16. In passing an opinion on the merits of this case, it will not fail to be remembered that hereditary service in the British Contingent gives the peti tioner strong claims to the support and protection of the British Government, and that the Maharaja should not be allowed to exercise an arbitrary and unjust interference with the hereditary service of an old and highly respectable family which can be 'shown to have rendered distinguished service to both the British and Baroda Governments during the last 80 years. 1011 17. In the case of Shalm Mahomed Radhan Meeya there are additional circumstances of aggravation. The recognition of petitioner was formally made by the Maharaja and the jaghire was continued in his name for upwards of a year. The present assertion of the Durbar that the presentation of a poshack, which is the formal signal of recognition, was made merely as a mark of condolence is so utterly futile as not to be worthy of serious notice, and is moreover refuted by the evidence adduced before the Commission. The peti tioner is the legal heir and representative of his uncle, the late Radhan Meeya, who always treated him as his legal successor and was generally recognized as such. 18. Under the circumstances above disclosed, I earnestly commend to the favorable consideration of Government these two cases in particular, and trust that before any settlement is finally made the Government may be pleased to order a careful enquiry in each case and take the whole of the circumstances into consideration. 19. Paragraph 32 of the statement accompanying His Highness the Gaekwar's khureeta under notice relates to the case of Muggun Purshotum, which was entered as case No. 37, Schedule II., Baroda Enquiry Commission Report. 20. With reference to the proposals of the Durbar in this very serious case, I have the honor to solicit attention to my final statement and to the opinion of the Commission recorded thereon, together with all the other evi dence relating to the case that will be found recorded in the Proceedings of the Baroda Commission. It will be observed that although the Commission decline to express any opinion regarding the exaction of the bond for 20 lakhs, the Durbar now propose that the complainant should be required to prove his asser tions, or in default forfeit the remaining 14 lakhs of rupees, less the value of the jewels, &amp;c., that are said to have been taken from the complainant. 21. Considering that the Maharaja has thus every motive to suppress the real facts of the case and to prevent the complainant from proving it, it will be utterly unreasonable to suppose that the complainant would stake everything on the result of such an enquiry. Under any circumstances, I would earnestly solicit that whatever enquiry may be instituted in this case should be so through the Residency. 22. The excessive spoliation to which this complainant has been subjected at the hands of the present Maharaja renders him deserving of special consider ation. 23. Paragraphs 36 to 46 inclusive of the statement under notice relate to the proposals for the different cases of members of the late Gaekwar Khun- derao's family. 24. With reference to the proposals made, I have the honor respectfully to observe that they do not generally appear to bear any relation to the details of each case, and that without careful enquiry into the merits of each case separately and the circumstances of each petitioner, it would be impossible to effect anything like an equitable settlement of each case. 25. Paragraphs 47 to 63 relate to the different cases of the late Khunde Rao Gaekwar's followers and dependants. 26. These cases were considered by the Commission to be amongst the very worst of those presented to them for enquiry. Some of the proposals now made appear to be fairly liberal, but I would earnestly solicit before any final opinion is expressed by Government as to the character of the proposals made each case be separately considered on its own merits, and that the persons concerned or their Agents be permitted to make what representations they have to make before their cases are finally decided. I have already on numerous occasions brought to the notice of Government that the ruin of this class was effected by the Maharaja mainly for the purpose of spoliation. It is notorious that all of the persons concerned were possessed of very considerable property,far more considerable than would appear probable from their position in life. They were indeed the favorites of the late Gaekwar and appear to have enjoyed his favors with considerable profusion. 27. In the case of Moonshee Hubeeboolla there are special circumstances of aggravation, he is moreover one of the most important witnesses relating to the alleged poisoning of the late Minister Bhow Scindia. I would commend his and his brother's case for special consideration. 28. With reference to the cases of Luximeebaee, widow of Mulharba Shilka, and Bageerthibaee, widow of Gunnoo Wagh, paragraphs 56 and 57,1 have the honor to state that the husbands of both of these persons are alleged to have been poisoned in prison by the orders of His Highness the Maharaja. The pro posals now tardily made, though apparently liberal, are, I believe, wholly inade quate to the special circumstances of the case which are of an aggravated character. 29. With reference to the case of Parbutibaee, widow of the late Bhow Scindia, see paragraphs 58 to 60, I am respectfully of opinion that the proposal to compensate the two widows with a lump sum of Rupees 25,000 is, under the circumstances, wholly inadequate. The suspicious nature of their husbands' death in prison is well known to Government. The extensive spoliation of his enormous property, which is popularly valued at from 30 to 40 lakhs of rupees, but which the Durbar have valued at 5 lakhs only, is notorious. These facts, it is submitted, give the petitioners an exceptional claim to the protection of Government, and I would earnestly commend their case for favorable notice. 30. With reference to the proposals submitted regarding the remaining cases adverted to in the statement under notice, I do not think it necessary to offer any detailed comment, but I would observe that the statements made by the Durbar are in several instances wholly opposed to the statements of the petitioners concerned. I would therefore hope that before any opinion what ever is expressed by Government regarding the propriety of tire proposals now made, a detailed enquiry should be instituted into the merits of each case and the petitioners be allowed to make whatever representations they may have to make. 31. In conclusion, I have the honor to invite attention to the fact that the proposals of the Durbar are limited to a certain number only of the cases that came before the Commission, and that it should not be left to the Durbar to decide in what cases they will give compensation and in what cases they will refuse to give it. It will be remembered that whatever settlements of Commis sion cases may now be effected under the authoritative advise of Government, will be regarded as precedents, not only at Baroda, but in other parts of India. Under these circumstances, I am respectfully of opinion that any opinion regarding the propriety of the settlements now proposed by the Durbar should be expressed with the greatest caution. Enclosure No. 11. Khureeta, dated Baroda Palace, Isfc December 1874. From—His Highness Mulhar Rao Maharaja Gaekwar Sena Khaskhel Sumshere Bahadoor, —His Excellency the Right Hon'ble Thomas George Baring , Baron North' brook, G.M.S.I., Viceroy and Governor-General of India. As promised in my khureeta of the 2nd November 1874 I have this day addressed the following khureeta to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay :— 1. With reference to the advice which the Resident, under instructions Irom Government, has conveyed to me about the Sirdars and military classes of this State (yad No. 1502C.-T.), the relatives and dependants of the late Maharaja (yad No. 1532G.-13), and the Bankers (yad No. • ), it has become necessary for me to submit for Your Excellency's consideration the following representation :— 2. In pursuance of this advice I directed my Dewan to offer certain terms to the complainants. But from the sprit in which some of them received 12 Exd.—J. T. F.13 » / \ r' my proposals, it soon became evident that they would not a^ree to any reason able settlement, unless T had the cordial co -operation of the Resident. 3. I therefore desired the Dewan, as a most speedy and practicable method of dealing with the matter, to ask the Resident to favour me with his views as to the settlement of each case, in order that I might carry out at once such as I agreed with and submit the rest of the cases, if any, with our respective opinions for the consideration of Government. 4. The Resident at first readily acceded to the suggestions, and gave his views on some cases. I at once carried out such as I agreed with. In other cases, and generally, I unfortunately found the Resident taking extreme views. 5. Finding that the chances of our agreement are not many, I have resolved to submit at once to Government the consideration of the principles necessary to be borne in mind and my proposals in each case with an endeavour as far as possible to please Government. I append therefore a statement of my proposals. 6. The settlement of these cases to be reasonable in itself and equitable for all parties requires to be made after a careful consideration of and proper allowance for such rights and prerogatives as have always been possessed by Native Princes. I can assure Your Excellency that it is not my object to evade in any way the advice of Government, nor do I mean that I intend to insist on an entire continuance of the hitherto prevailing practices. 7. In order to arrive at a proper understanding of the extent and scope of the rights and prerogatives of Native Princes as they have always existed, I will now submit for Your Excellency's consideration the following:— 8. In his minute of 16th January 1823, Sir Thomas Munro says : — ' In this country under the Native Governments all grants whatever are o ,11 i tui •!„' v resumable at pleasure. Official grants are perma- See Colonel Ethendgc s Narrative . ., t . i , , i of the Bombay Inam Commission, nent while the OITlCe COntlUUCS but UOt always lU pages i3-it. ^ ie Sfime family; grants for religious and charitable purposes to individuals or bodies of men though often granted Jor ever, or while the sun and moon endure, were frequently resumed at short intervals; grants of jaghires or inam lands, from favour or affection, or as rewards for services, were scarcely ever perpetual. It was rare that any term was specified and never one or more lives ; but it made usually little difference whether the '•rant was for no particular period or perpetual. The altumgha or perpetual grant was as liable to resumption as any common grant containing no speci fication of time; it was resumed because it was too large, or because the reign ing soverigu disliked the adherents of his predecessor and wished to reward his own at their expense, and for various other &lt; auses. There was no rule for the continuance of grants but his pleasure: they might be resumed in two or three years, or they might be continued during two or three or more lives; but when thev escaped so long, it was never without a revision and renewal. I believe that the term of their lives is a longer period than grants for services were generally permitted by Native Princes to run.' He proceeded :— ' It appears from these facts that in the Carnatic allumgha grants (the highest sort of royal grants) so far from being irresumable, have not been so much respected as many of the ordinary jaghires. The Commissioner of Poona, in answer to a reference made to him on the subject, has stated that he has not been able to find a single altiiTngha in the Deccan, and has transmitted a list of five hundred and ninety jaghires resumed by the Peishwa's Government within the last fifty years. In the Nizam's dominions too the resumption of jaghires appears from the note of his Minister Chundoo Lall to have been regulated as in the Carnatic by the will of the Prince.' And added— ' There are no persons to whom jaghires have been continued without some change or modification. It can easily be shown that Princes resumed altum-14 Tf nnnuni be shown that when they were disposed to resume ghas at pleasure, it or cou i ( i \ )0 prevented. It may be said that the act ot resiunptioi . tly ii ac i they seized private property they they were despots by the ( : olintry but no injustice was would been 11 -■ aliumaha as the people knew that it was a grant attached to the — it is true, despotic : hut they were liberal of public rev etiue. ^ an( j the grants themselves grew out oi their very despSHorH was I)ecause they found uo difficulty in resuming that they made none in granting. . 1 , n -tyr ^ . ,, . i-w nnofpri minute he brought in a. letter from A\ allaja, the Nawahtf 'fte Carnatl, to the Government of Madras, dated 18th October 1790, 011 ^''uu^Frince^oTtb^Carnatic, and for these forty years I have granted, resumed, and altered jaghires in such manner as 1 have thoug ,t l' 1 ''l'' 1 - 9. Captain Cowper in his Report on Adoptions under the Peishwas Sa&gt; S 'at appears equally certain that the Peishwas Government Bot only pos- 11 . ^ t sessedthe power of resuming mams, but that the xxvKrpti. 8616 ^' ^ ' power was freely exercised, and it is further shown that Inamdars were not exempted from the payment ot cesses, but they contri buted largely in this respect. In short it is placed, I think, beyond a doubt that an iuara, 'though granted as a free gift in perpetuity, was resumed or continued, and was taxed at pleasure. 'The power of resumption seems to have been arbitrarily exercised, but this is not surprising, for it could scarcely have been otherwise when the will ot the sovereign had the force of law, and indeed icas the law. Whatever may have been the theory, in practice inams seem to have been interfered with in every possible wav, and it will be seen that on an Inamdar's death even his son could not consider his holding secure without obtaining the special sanction ot Govern ment to the succession. It will be observed also that political offences were punished by resuming the inam of the offender, and that the punishment due to the actual delinquent was sometimes even inflicted on his relatives' 10. Captain Cowper bases these remarks on four statements containing a number of selected cases illustrative of the system which was in force during the last seventy years of the Peishwa's Government. 11. In his reports on the Deccan Surinjams the same authority says : ' Shortly after the conquest of the Deccan, several districts which had Bombay Selection, n . s.. No. xxxi., belonged to the Peishwa were ceded by the British Deccan Surinjams, page 30. Government to the N izam with wllOm it tlUMl rested to continue or not, at his pleasure, surunjams to a large amount which had been held in those districts prior to the cession. Generally speaking they were not continued.' 12. I will now give a few quotations from Captain Cowper's report as to the right of adoption, the more particularly as they contain the principles recognized and acted upon by the British Government. ' It has always been and still is a standing rule that an adoption not sanc- tioned by Government srives the person adopting no Report on Adopts, page i. ^ ^ alienation of Government revenue.' ' It may I think be concluded from the above letters that as a general Id em, page 3. • ru ^ e arnon g the existing Governments ol India no adoption is looked upon as valid unless previously sanctioned by the Sirkar.' 13. The Company's Government proclaimed in 1820 that:— ' Should any one make an adoption without permission the Sirkar will not recognize it, and the adopted son shall not be allowed to hold any bucks, &amp;c., under Government.'15 14. On the same subject Mr. Hart observed :— 44 The records of the Hindoo Government to which ours has succeeded, 1A show that the sovereign carried his interference Report on Adoption, page 10. -ii j ,• /. . i , i i i i • with adoptions so far as not o dy to withhold his sanction from adoptions which lie was not disposed to recognize, but to forbid the very ceremony and even to order the repudiation of a child unauthorizedly adopted.' 15. The Chief Secretary to the Bombay Government wrote to Mr. Hart:— ' On reading over the memorandum Ilis Lordship in Council can come to no other opinion but that Government have a Idem, page 27. • i - , • n i.i c x* right to reserve in all cases the power 01 granting or refusing such assent to an adoption as will confer upon the adopted son a title against the State.' ' His Lordship in Council would refuse to perpetuate by adoption any secular, cash or grain allowance except when there are special reasons of a political nature as in some of the instances occurring in Guzerat.' 16. The Revenue Secretary in his letter wrote as follows:— &lt;$ It is I think clear that in reserving to themselves the power of granting or refusing such assent to adoption on the part of Inamdars and others holding liens on the public revenue, as will confer on the adopted son a title against the State, Govern ment merely exercise a right which the Peishwas never for a moment relinquished.' idem, page 40. 17. The Honb'le the Court of Directors |said:— 'We are decidedly of opinion that in no case should the alienation of an inam be recognized for any term exceeding that for which the present holder and his heirs may possess an interest, and that the eventual right of Govern ment to resume the revenue on thi extinction of the family of the original grantee should be carefully maintained.' ' This rule ' the Court desired ' must be considered inviolable.' 18. As to how far holders of alienations contributed to the public re sources, the following is quoted by Captain Cowper from Mr. Chaplin :— ' These nuzzers formerly produced a very considerable revenue, the sum derived from them by the late Government during the last fifty-six years exceeded four crores and fifty-eight thousand rupees.' 19. Upon this Captain Cowper remarks :— ' And even this large amount which was that appearing in the public accounts, formed, Mr. Chaplin thought, but a small part of the total collections under this head.' 20. I may also draw Your Excellency's attention to the following trans lation of a communication in Persian (copy appended), dated 6th November 1849, and addressed by the Governor-General's Agent to the Native States of Central India:— ' Copy of roobkaree (proceedings) in the great office of the Residency before Sir Robert North Colly Hamilton Saheb, Bahadoor, Resident of Indore, written on the 6th Novem ber 1849. Seal of the Residency. Signed in English. True Copy. ' In all the States of this country, in matters specially of bucks of Jaghire- dars of the State, and in dealing with and acting upon, grants made by former Princes, disputes generally arise, a decision of which disputes is a delicate work involving much consideration and anxiety; and as it is considered in everyresnect better that the British Government should make public its opinion on the subiect, the same opinion is (here) put in writing with all clearness, that none of the Princes can alienate or grant lands for a period beyond his own lifetime, and that '-rants of laud or fixed allowances m cash, made during the minority f a Prince shall not be acted upon without fresh sanction and confirmation on the Vv\uro it tain in 0, his majority. Mmfee jaghires and lands for the servants of the State are onlv' for the aid of the State, and therefore such grants made for periods' beyond the lives of the grantees in return for their aid and services to the State, thus limited, cannot be alienated from the State in perpetuity. Once in 18i3 this subject came on for discussion before His Excellency the Governor- General, when it was written that a Prince grants jaghires from the State, where- bv the revenues of the State diminish while the fixed expenditure of the State continues the burden on the State increases. Under these circumstances a deficiencv in the amount required for the fixed and necessary expenses of the State occurs, and thus great injury arises in future to the Prince from such •••rants. The Governor-General, considering the importance of the subject, disapproves of the grants of such jaghires, and considers the discontinuance of the practice reasonable. It is therefore fit for every one to keep this rule in view. Although it is not supposed that all States are so insolvent as not to be able to make 0 grants of jaghires, it is possible that grants of jaghires will in future create great difficulties. ' O rdered That a copy of this roobkaree be given to each Vakeel in attend ance at the Eesidency, andf that copies be sent to Political Agent, Bhopal, Malahur, Captain AVilkie, Agent, Bhopawur, Captain lleeves, 1 olitical Agent, Munmar, and Lieutenant Taylor, Deputy Political Agent, Mahur, with the object that the said officers give a copy to the Vakeel or Kamdar of each State with which they are connected.' 21. These are the principles and practices which have hitherto obtained in this as well as in all other Native States, not without recognition, as above shown, by the British Government. I bring them to Your Excellency's notice not with any desire to evade the advice of the British Government, or to adhere strictly to them in dealing with the present cases, but w ith a view to appeal to Your Excellency's sense of justice, whether as regards these complaints I should be asked to subject my acts to a standard which is so foreign to the tra ditions, usages, and sentiments of Native Governments. I am quite willing, I assure Your Excellency, to treat every case with consideration, and to do all I reasonably can to satisfy these complainants. How far 1 am earnest in this desire will appear to Your Excellency from the accompanying statement. I must, however, at the same time ask for the same equity and justice lor myselt which 1 am advised to extend to others. 22. I trust Your Excellency will judge of the settlements I have proposed in the light of the considerations set forth in this khureeta, and w r ill assist me in bringing this matter to a speedy conclusion. 23. I have addressed a similar khureeta (copy enclosed) to His Excellency tlie Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and I beg that Your Excellency will forward it to His Lordship. With cordial esteem, &amp;c. 2. I beg to express the high consideration and esteem I entertain for Your Excellency, and to subscribe myself, &amp;c. Statement accompanying His Highness the Gaekwar's khureeta, dated the 1st December 1S74', to the address of His Excellency the Governor in Council, Bombay. Sirdars and Silledars. T he Commission report says that there are seventeen cases of complaints against the proceedings of the Government since the accession of the present Chief, six of which do not appear to the Commissionto call for an opinion from it # 1G Exd.-J. D. G.17 E (BM The following proposals are made for the remaining eleven. Note. —There is a certain number of persons whom His Highness strongly desires not to be allowed to remain in Baroda. His Highness regards them as bis personal enemies, and considers himself in danger from them. There is also the further risk of these men malaciously complaining that His Highness molested them, though he might do nothing of the kind. It would be best for all parties that these persons lived out of Baroda:— No. 11. Abdool Rehman. This man is one of those who are personally disagreeable to His Highness. His pay from 1918=1862 only was Rupees 600 per annum, and he had an allow ance of Rupees 1,200 per annum for palkee granted to him by the late Prince in consideration of service performed and to be performed in future. 2. So far as his services as a Jemadar were concerned, he was purely a stipendiary servant, and was entitled to his pay only so long as he served. He was liable to be dismissed at any time. Though as a general rule no gratuity is granted to such servants on dismissal in Native States, His Highness is will ing, in deference to the wishes of the British Government, to give him a gratuity of Rupees 2,000 (two thousand), which is equal to one-third of his pay, commuted into a lump-sum at ten years' purchase. + 3. The allowance of Rupees 1,200 (twelve hundred) per annum granted by Sunnud was partly for past service, including a special service, and partly for future service. The future service has been dispensed with since 1927=1871. Independently of this being partly only a service grant, it has been distinctly admitted by the British Government as the universal practice and right of Native Princes to resume at will any grants, perpetual or temporary, made by their predecessors, and this practice and right have hitherto obtained in this State. Still His Highness is willing to grant a lump-sum of Rupees 12,000 (twelve thousand), which is equal to ten years' purchase of his annuity. No. 12. Narayenrao, Shivrao, Govindrao, Hurpalay. 4. In this case of the Rupees 5,800 (five thousand and eight hundred) the pay of the complainants was as follows :— Narayenrao ... ... Rs. 1,142 per annum. Sbivrao ... ... „ 747 „ Total ... Rs. 1,889 per annum. The remainder is for the pay of the sowars who have been drafted into the Contingent. Their pay was stopped in 1927 = 1871, and from that a sum of Rupees 600 (six hundred) per annum has been allowed for subsistence to their two aunts, who would otherwise have been destitute. 5. These men are also regarded by His Highness as his personal enemies. 6. They were like No. 11 stipendiary servants, and the remarks made in paragraph a Pply equally to their case. His Highness therefore proposes to give them a gratuity of Rupees 6,300 (six thousand and three hundred), which is equal to one-third of their pay, commuted into a lump-sum at ten years' purchase. His Highness does not propose to deduct the Rupees 600 allowance hitherto paid to the two aunts, though that allowance will be stopped hereafter. 7. As regards the complainants' horses and their furniture. His Highness will pay Rupees 1,000 (one thousand). No. 13. Ali Mamud Ray a Ali. 8. The charge of twenty-one men with an annual allowance of Rupees 1,935 has already been restored to the complainant, who has thus been provided for.18 o \ f +1.0 nvinmmdal Levy of two hundred men, this was the original 9.

Nos. 18,1!) and 20 have been settled with the assistance of the Resident. No 21. Samul Becker. 11 The allowance for the Paga was for service which has been dispensed with Had Motilall (the last man in service) been alive, His Highness would have ^ranted him a pension, but as he ceased to be a Government servant a ) ear i f rlontli nothing now remains to be done. As for the private property in horses anTequTpmente, the value thereof will be allowed for in the adjust- ment of accounts with the i inn. 12 As for the inam village of Gadula, it is admitted by the complamant himself to have been held only 'annually,' and as such the grant was disco*- tinuable and was discontinued. 13 The villages Dewalipoor and Futtehpoor were granted on service tenure Though thl service has now been dispensed with and though the com plainant is not entitled as a matter of right to have the villages continued His Highness is willing to show him consideration, lie will continue the revenuc the'villages as based on the realizations of the current year during the hfetime of the complainant, who is a minor, only about five years old. His Highness will further continue a moiety for one life more. 14 With regard to the allowances for palkee and runners, they were honorary stipends, granted in the words of the Commission, so long as the grantees continued to serve the State as bankers; but as they are dead, ami as also the connection of the Firm with the State as bankers has ceased, the allowances have ceased too. 15. With regard to the private property of the Pirm, the Agents have not taken charge of the same, though repeatedly asked to do so. 16. With regard to aid from the Durbar to the Firm in efTeeting an Adjustment of its advances to the Sirdars and Silladar classes, it shall be given in accordance with the practice heretofore in force. 17. With regard to the item of Rupees 20,000 for Court foes. His Highness will allow the remission if the Firm proves it to have been granted by the late Maharaja. No. 30. Salim bin Mahamad bin llamid. 18. In this case the complainant w r as a servant of the State and liable to be dismissed at any time. The foot establishment with allowances of Rupees 10,000 annually has been re-granted to him; and His Highness sees no reason to restore the Paga which was taken from him all but in name by the late Maharaja so far back as 1917 =1861: His Highness, however, offered him an additional stipend of Rupees 600 (six hundred) a year, which he ho has rejected. His Highness, therefore, does not now think him deserving of any such consideration. No. 36. Anandfow Narayenrao Dahivdt. 19. The stipend of Rupees 12,000 per annum granted as a personal allowance to the complainant's adoptive father as son-in-law of a reigning Prince19 ceased on his death, just as those of his elder brother {i .e., the complainant's uncle) and other sons-in-law generally ceased on their demise. Complainant is mistaken in stating that this allowance is continued to him. hat is conti nued is the item of R/upees 13,288 per annum, which was granted by the late Maharaja as an equivalent for the two villages resumed by him. 20. The complainant having been allowed by His Highness to be adopted in preference to another member of the family of closer relationship at the earnest solicitations of the mother of the deceased, that lady consented to pay the nuzzerana. The terms of this arrangement were settled and carried out before the recognition of the adoption. His Highness, however, is willing to give back to the complainant his private property in Baroda and Sarsaoli, which he (complainant) has valued at Rupees 4,50,000. While making this concession. His Highness is ready, if the complainant so chooses, to give back all that he has received, and cancel the adoption so far as it affects all grants and honors held from the State. The village of Sarsaoli, moreover, was granted to the last holder in tail male in consideration of his relationship and for service (as killadar). No. 37. Babajee Kasirao Dhumsi. 21. On examining the complainant's case, it was found that there was truth on his side. His Highness has, therefore, ordered that his claim be recognized. No. 38. Bhagwantrao, Gopalrao, Jadao. 22. This case has been settled according to the Resident's advice. 23. The six cases on which the Commission has given no opinion. No. 14. Gunpatrao or Balwanlrao bin Mahadhowrao Dhamdere. 24. Two successive adoptions have already taken place. His Highness lias a right, as admitted by the British Government, to refuse to sanction any further adoption, and has,'therefore, resumed the State grants. The complainant cannot be moreover adopted according to Hindoo law, because he is the brother of the deceased. The private property which is claimed by two or three parties is therefore under attachment, pending any of the parties concerned making his or her claim good before a Court of Law. Should any of the three ladies (the mother and the other wife of the father of the deceased and the wife of the deceased) apply for maintenance till the dispute is settled. His Highness will make arrangements therefor from the private property. No. 15. Shah Mahamad. 25. In this case the customary poshak said to have been granted on the third day of Radhan Mia's death was given only as a mark of condolence \dukhota). The alleged adoption is in itself illegal, as no adoption is allowed by Mahomedan law. But were it even allowable His Highness has a light to refuse to sanction it as regards property held from the State. 26. The other members of the family still hold and enjoy their State grants, and His Highness has already allowed Rupees 2,400 per annum to Radhan Mia's widow for her support for life, which he is willing to increase to Rupees 5,000 (five thousand) per annum. No. 16. Mahabula Khan. 27. The deceased has left a son by a Loundee, who alleges that he had made nika with her. Neither the son nor the surviving widow has sought to establishheirship in the proper tribunal. Therefore, till either of the parties establish his or her claim, the widow will be granted a maintenance allowance ot llupees 600 per annum from the estate. Moreover, the widow, on whose behali the complainant (her father) appeared before the Commission is dead. No. 17. Mahadowrao Jeysingrao Gaekwad. 28. In this case the Paga and other property were originally in the charge of the complainant's mother; but at the request of complainant the Paga was made over to him by His Highness. He, however, so mismanaged it that the Political Agent at Sadra complained about its inefficient state. The whole management was therefore taken out of his hands and transferred to his mother as before. As the State is interested, in the efficiency of the Pao-a service, it will continue it in the hands ot the mothei, unless lie gi^es proper security for better management in future. As regards the other estate, there is a dispute between the mother and son, which is being enquired into. No. 24. Anandrao Govind Phanse. 29. The only complaint in this case is about the village of Deola, but this village, which was Dumala, and was held only as a part ot his allowances, was taken away by the late Maharaja, and a cash allowance substituted instead to make up the total of his emoluments. There is, therefore, no grievance whatever. No. 35. Yadowrao Tookajee Kadam. 30. This question, which is one of right between two private parties, viz., the complainant and his paternal grandmother, will be shortly enquired into and settled. The nuzzerana of Rupees 35,000 will be returned. 31. Por the rest of the cases under the heading of Sirdars, the Commis sion observes ' that the cause of grievances in the cases of eleven of the com plainants arose in the time of the late and previous Gaekwars, and that the Commission does not feel called on to record any opinion in ten of the num ber. In one of these cases, No. 8 on the list, the action complained ot appears to be harsh and arbitrary, though quite in accordance with the then existing practice of the State.' No. 37. (Schedule II.) Mugon Purshotum (Hari Bhagti.) 32. The chithi for twenty lakhs of rupees was given up by His Highness for a much less consideration in the ornaments, garden, &amp;c., which are now claimed. He also saved the Pirm from ruin by lending it a sum of lakhs of rupees, a part of which still remains to be recovered. 33. The chithi was taken by the late Maharaja for a debt of twenty lakhs due by the Pirm to the State. The complainant alleges that no such debt was due, and that the chithi was taken forcibly by the late Maharaja. His High ness proposes as a fair and satisfactory solution of the question, that it should be ascertained whether the debt for which the chithi was given is really due. If the enquiry confirms the complainant's statement. His Highness will return all (including the two items of Rupees of 75,000 each) that he has received from him. But if otherwise, the payment of the remaining fourteen lakhs, less the value of the jewels and the garden, and the two items abovementioned, will be recovered. 34. The villages and allowance claimed by the complainant are as follow :— \st. —The village of Goriad granted by Govindrao Gaekwar to Hari Bhagti as an hereditary inam. 20 Exd.—J M.'lud and 3rd. The villages of Samra and Samree granted by Sayajee Rao Gaekwar to Becher Samal, grandson of Har Bhagti, hereditarily on service tenure. 4M.—The village of Simlack granted by Sayajee Rao Gaekwad to Becher Samal on service tenure, not hereditarily. 5//?.—An honorary allowance of Rupees 1,200 per annum granted by Khunde Rao Gaekwar to Mugon Purshotum (complainant), not hereditarilv. 35. His Highness will dispose of the above as follows, bearing in mind that service has been dispensed with :— 1^.—The village of Goriad will be restored. 2nd and 3rd. —The revenues of the villages of Samra and Samree as based on the realizations of the current year will be continued to the complainant during his lifetime, and a moiety for one more life. Mh and bth. —The village of Simlack and the honorary allowance of Rupees 1,200 will be continued to the complainant for his lifetime. Khundb Hao's Family. No. 42. Anandrao Wishwasrao. *i6. This man complains that he has been deprived of his Paga with its allowances and of an inam v illage. 37. The Paga was one entirely for service, and was withdrawn as service ceased to be taken from him. The Commission also observes that ' it is not disposed to question the resumption of the Pagas of horse held by No. 2 {i.e., the complainant), and the mother of No. 6.' * * * 38. As to the inam village. His Highness will continue the revenue thereof as based on the realizations of the current year to the complainant during his lifetime. 39. The house property referred to by the complainant was bought with the money of the State. But if he produces the Deed of Sale held by him, as stated by the Resident, and if the deed be in his name, the house will be restored to him. 2.— Muujoolabai. 40. His Highness has given this lady (his niece) no cause of complaint whatever. The only thing that was done was that she was removed from one house to another equally good, but neither of them belonging to her. Her own jewels worth about a lakh and a quarter of rupees she has taken with her to her house, for which there is a receipt in the Durbar. There are some things belonging to her mother which Jumnabai (her step-mother) had taken; and it is to be ascertained, \stly, from the list given to the Resident, which were Munjoolabai's mother's jewels; and 2ndly, whether Munjoolabai has any right to them. Jumnabai as Ranee after Munjoolabai's mother's death claiming all for herself. When this is settled with the Resident action will be taken accordingly. 41. All Inamdars employ their own men for the protection of their inam. 3.— Kashee Rao Gunput Rao Raje Shirke. 42. He is a son-in-law of Khunde Rao Maharaja, and the husband of the No. 2. Because Khunde Rao chose to give him Rupees 12,000 per annum, it is not binding on the State to continue this allowance. Other son-in-law of Gun- put Rao Maharaja and Khunde Rao Maharaja are also getting Rupees 8,000, except one of Gunput Rao Maharaja who gets Rupees 9,000; and the allowance of this son-in-law (complainant) has been fixed at the same amount. The allowances of all, including villages, are Rupees 11,000, while that of the com plainant is Rupees 13,100. 43. His complaint about the howda is wrong. Rupees three thousand were given him to make a howda, which he has not made, but has used instead 21 F Exd.—J.

The palkee allowance was granted to his father, but not hereditarily. It was only an honorary grant to his father, and does not call for restoration. Schedule III., No. 4. Amiha lianchod. 71. This is a dispute about jewels between the complainant and his step mother, and the action of the Durbar was taken consequent thereon. Amtha's Agent has already been informed accordingly. No. 5.

A similar grant was made at the same time to the chief Minister, Govind Rao Rore, and the same course was followed in his case also. His Highness will therefore continue a grant of Rupees (10,000) ten thousand. No. 7. Bhanabhai Lalbhai. 73.

His Highness still adheres to the promise made to, and approved of by, the Commission, viz., either to pay for the jewels at a fair valuation or to return them, some reasonable consideration being allowed for interest.

From— C olonel S ir L ewis P elly , K.C.S .I., Agent, Governor-General, and Special Commissioner, Baroda, To—C. U. A ttchison , Esq., C.S.I., Secretary to the Govt of India, Foreign Dept. A mong the instructions contained in paragraph 9 of your Office letter No. 1586P. of the 25th of July 1874, was the following:— 'That with respect to the arbitrary reductions which have been made among the military classes, the Gaekwar should be advised, in consultation with the Resident, to frame some general rules for adoption in giving effect to such reductions in future which will ensure their being carried out with due consi deration to the claims of the parties concerned, and will prevent the scandal and risk that must attend the sudden deprivation without compensation or other provision of any sort of large numbers of old and hereditary military servants of the service on which they are wholly dependent for the means of subsistence.' 2. On taking charge of this office, I found that the question of the Sir dars, in relation to the Gaekwar, had formed the subject of a lengthened corre spondence, but that in this as in almost every other case on the records of the Residency, no settlement or satisfactory arrangement had been arrived at. 3. The most recent letter on the tile was one from Colonel Phayre to the Government of Bombay, No. 411-1361 of the 2nd December, in which Colonel Phayre on being removed from office, submitted some statements of the Sirdar's Attornies, and concluded his transmitting letter with the following words:— ' During the past year I have so frequently pressed upon the notice of Government the important nature of these cases that I refrain from alluding further to it.' 4. This letter of Colonel P hay re's, with its accompaniment, has now been sent to me from the Political Secretariat, Bombay, by transmitting letter No. 7548 of the 14th December 1874, intimating that ' under present circumstances you (I) will take such further action in the matter of this representation as you (I) may think proper.' 5. It will be in your recollection that numerous complaints from the Sirdars, Silledars, &amp;c., were produced before the Commission of last year, and that some 40 cases were enquired into, and that of these 40 the Commission accepted a few cases which had direct reference to the acts of the present Gaekwar; and it was for the disposal of these latter cases that on my arrival here, arrangements were made for enquiry being instituted at the Residency, as reported in my letter No. 431-1428 of 18th December 1874. 6. But I soon found that the debts, grievances, and complaints of the Sirdars, &amp;c., required a more extended investigation than that contemplated by the Commission. Indeed, there appeared to be irritation almost approaching exasperation on the part of the Sirdars towards the Gaekwar, and these angry feelings appeared to me to have been increased by an injudicious or (to say the least of it) an inopportune act on the part of His Highness in according to the recently created Pritinidhi a cushion sent in the Durbar, thus signifying precedence over all the Sirdars. 7. On the anniversary of the Gaekwar's birth-day, being 12th instant, I observed that there was only one Sirdar present in the Durbar, and His High ness afterwards explained that his Sirdars had been so accustomed to look to the Residency that they had ceased to regard him: that they had refused to accept their last year's allowances; and that they now wished to contest his right to confer rank on his late Minister. 8. A few days afterwards His Highness called on me to intimate that his Sirdars had requested an interview with him, that he had accorded the same, and that during the interview disrespect had been shown especially on the part of Narayen Rao Raje Pandray, the head Mharatta Sirdar, who had gone so far as to insinuate a threat to His Highness.9. I begged His Highness to favour me with a memorandum of the inter- view and a copy of ^ n0 J j askeJ the Min i s ter for the precise meaning of the ier^usld hf Pandrly, and he informed me that its literal meaning was a ' third course,' hut that the intention was to convey a tin. at lv T fhnf thft Gaekwar at the interview desired Ins Sirdars to 11. It seems that the c mv advice, but to this it appears Pandray wait on me at the Lcsu enc\ ver ^urinff the two following days, the Sr^rsTa^dv s^nftWr Attornies to me to request an interview. I named the folio win- Tuesday, and an interview was arranged accordingly. V&gt; But on the morning of the intervening Sunday the Gaekwar luin-iedly 15111 on Ultj uu in 0 porirlrnv had iust met him on his drive and called on n.e, and intimated . f^ob ecth'' to go to the llosi.k-ncy, I again insulted and tinea en^ ^.i'^ quite willing' to give the benefit of my explained Go ; ( . rom eiit of India would not tolerate on their adMce to the fen dais, thp p-pneral neace I be^sred His Highness the' GaekwarTo fLour me with headings of what had passed between him and randn.v. and 1 now enclose a copy of His Highness' summary. 13 His Highness was much agitated, and expressed himseli as ha\ing been in'personal peril at the hands of Pandray. His Highness asked my advice and I su^cstcd to him to inform Pandray that I expected the Sirdars accord- W to appointment; that if Pandray himself did not like to come he could stay Lw g av • that 1 should inform His Highness of the results of the interview ; and that ho could afterwards summon the Sirdars and explain his intentions. U On the Tuesday about 300 Sirdars and Silladars waited on me on the Residency grounds, and as they seemed to think that their dignity was concerned in coming armed, I permitted them to do so. Pandray was amongst them and appeared to me a diabolical ^Maratta. 15. I explained generally to the crowd my objects in meeting them, and then invited about 60 principal Sirdars to Durbar in the Residence ^here I explained to them the object of my mission to Baroda, and the utter contusion and mess into which that State had been brought by folly, ignorance, partizan- shin. intrigue, and conceited pretensions. The Sirdars sat with me more than two hours, and were quite respectful and orderly. Enclosed is a clear, accurate, and sufficientlv full memorandum of all that passed, drawn up by my native Assistant, Mr. Manibhai. I think the memorandum might be worth your reading, and from the subjoined quotation you will gather the mode ot procedure which I suggested for the settlement ot the debts, claims, and giievances ot the feirdais. ' That with respect to the case of the Sirdars two distinct questions had to be considered, viz:— ' 1st. —Their debts to Sowcars, and &lt;{ 2nd. —Their complaints against the Durbar. ' That as regards the first experience showed that by an amicable arrange ment with the Sowcars, the debts might be compromised and reduced, and the amount thus settled might be paid off by instalments extending over a series of years. Sir Lewis Pelly enquired of the Sirdars whether the Sowcars would be willing to agree to such an arrangement, and was assured that the Sirdars and Sowcars being mutually dependent upon one another, there would be no difficulty in arranging the matter in the way suggested. ' Sir Lewis Pelly then continued to say that as regards the Sirdars' com plaints against the Durbar, the best way of restoring a cordial understanding between them and His Highness, and redressing any just grounds of complaint that might exist, would be for the Sirdars as a body to select two respectable persons as mediators for them, the Durbar to select an equal number, and the four together should endeavour to establish harmony between the sovereign and his nobles. Sir Lewis Pelly expressed his willingness to otfer his aid and advice in this matter whenever required. * * * *27 ' It was also explained that the object was to refer the matter to the mediation and arbitrament of a person or persons who enjoyed th ^ confidence of both parties ; that if instead of two members from each side, both concurred in selecting one particular individual that would be equally well.' 16. On following day the Gaekwar called on me, and I explained to His Highness what had passed at the Durbar; His Highness assured me that the proceedings and suggestions had his entire approval, and that he would act accordingly. 17. Yesterday I read the memorandum to the Minister and afterwards ad dressed a note to him in view r to obtaining an official assurance of the Gaekwar s views in the matter. Enclosed are copies of my-note to the Minister and ot his reply, intimating that I had correctly understood His Highness, i am informed from numerous quarters that since the interview the Sirdars have expressed themselves as being quite contented and re-assured. P.S.—2Sth December 1874.—The Sirdars have just now sent to me to sub mit that in an assembly of their pricipal men, they had resolved to take no steps without consulting me, and to be entirely guided by my advice. No. 411-1361, dated Baroda, 2nd December 1874. From— Colonel Phayre, C.B., Resident, Baroda, To—C. Gonne, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I n forwarding, for the consideration and orders of Government, the accom panying copy of a petition made this day before me by the representatives o the Sirdars, Silladars, &amp;c., of the Baroda State, I have the honor to express an opinion that the request herein made is a proper and indeed an absolutely necessary one under the present emergency. Each case will have to be treated on its own merits, and involves an inves tigation of a searching and intricate nature. I have found the Sirdars them selves entirely unable to state their own claims properly, and it has been only by much labour 'that I have been able to arrive at any satisfactory account ot them. Under these circumstances I am satisfied that unless some qualified British officer is appointed to represent each case separately on its merits before the Special Commissioner, the rights of all petitioners of this class will be,seriousiy prejudiced as it is obviously impossible for the Special Commissioner himse to spare sufficient time to gd into the details of each separate case. In connection also with the same subject, I have the honor to mvite the serious attention of Government to the fact that the Durbar only propose o effect any specific settlement in eleven cases out of the wdiole number oi toi \ enquired into by the Commission. It is obviously impossible that these proposals can be taken as an equitable solution of the difficulty involved in this important class of cases, ^sot only are the forty claimants Wore the Commission clamorous for a speedy settle ment of their claims, but numerous others, who were present at the Commission but were hot examined, are awaiting an equitable settlement also. During the past year I have so frequently pressed upon the notice of Gov ernment the important nature of these cases that I refrain from alluding further to it. T he undermentioned Kamdars on the part of the Sirdars, &amp;c., attended this day, 2 2d December 1874, at the Residency, and begged permission to make the following representations with which they have been entrusted by their several Sirdars:— 1. Kamdar Gunput Bao Balajee on behalf of the Pandrey and Gorepuray Sirdars.9 Kamdar Eamrao Gopal and Moonshee Bulwuat Rao on behalf of Nawab Kumaloodeen Iloosein Kban. ^ \ ^e * ^ n f at i i 3. Kamdar Bbiccajee Hareeon behalf of Sirdar Dost Mohmed. 4 Kamdar Ramchundra Sudasheo Pomekur on behalf of Sirdar Meer Ibrahim Ali. In addition to the abovenamed Sirdars, these Kamdars state that they have hppn demited by all the other Sirdars, Silladars and military classes of the Hoo- zoorat and Contingent to represent their cases as they at present stand. They represent as follows: That they have heard with mnch concern the contemplated removal of Colonel Phayre from the office of Resident. That through his mediation their grievances claims, &amp;c., most of them of long standing, were first represented to Government and subsequently to the Baroda Enquiry Commission. That the enquiry into these claims, grievances, &amp;c., has been a work of oreat intricacy and difficulty, and that unless each of these cases is adequately represented on its own merits, a satisfactory settlement cannot be expected for the following reasons:— Because His Highness the present Maharaja has from the first been not onlv unfriendly to their hereditary rights and interests, but has declared his intention of making reductions depriving them of those hereditary rights, wuttuns, &amp;c. Moreover, that this feeling has been heightened considerably since the sitting of the Baroda Commission. 2^. Because the pay and allowances of most of them have been in arrears for upwards of 3J years, whereby in conjunction with other causes, they have been plunged in ruinons debts from which they are totally unable to extricate themselves. That an enquiry into their debts involves the investigation of trans actions extending over the last half a century and upwards, in all of which His Highness the Gaekwar has the utmost interest in suppressing the facts. 4^ j —That under present circumstances the acceptance of chittees as tendered by Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee, wdll afford no rel ef whatever, as the Parukhs refuse to make advances, being alarmed at the prospect of reductions. 5^—That the proposed reductions are not only contrary to the conditions of their service, which is hereditary, but must involve them in utter ruin, quite independently of any present settlement of their cases which may be effected. 6th. —That the reductions alleged by the Durbar to have been made on the score of economy, are not bond fide reductions at all, but merely consists in displacing old hereditary servants for new favorites. 7M.—That for the last year or two the Maharaja has taken every possible opportunity to degrade them on all public occasions. Under these circumstances, whatever may be the result of the arrangement now ordered by Government, we humbly solicit that a British officer may be appointed on our behalf to prosecute our individual claims and grievances before the Special Commissioner who has now been appointed by the Govern ment of India, with a view to their equitable and speedy settlement.

As His Highness has not been able to go to you, he has directed me to send you the enclosed translation of the notes taken of the conversation which took place at the interview. Dated Thursday Magsur Sood 9th 1931 = (17th December IS?^). Memorandum of the conversation that took place between His Highness the Maharaja Gaekvvar and the Sirdars. His Highness asked the Sirdars ' what they had to say'? Thereupon, Yeshwant llao Raje Pandharay told his Karkoon to take out the yadi. The said yadi was taken by Ramrao, the Karkoon of the Nawab, and then Ramrao and other Karkoons came and sat in front of His Highness. Ram rao took the yadi in his hand. In the meantime His Highness said that, 'if any yadi was to be given, it should be sent to the Durbar, and that if the assemblage of Sirdars had to communicate anything they might do so by word of mouth, it was not necessary for their Vakeels to say anything.' Upon this, the assemblage of Karkoons sat aside, and Naraenrao Raje Pandharay said to His Highness that ' we have already once before represented, and we do now represent that our man 'pan (honors) should be continued to us as before.' His Highness said—' the same ' man pan' is now continued as before. Tell me in what respect it has been lessened ?' Narayenrao said—'invitations to attend two Kutcheries were received by us, but owing to the Gasha (square piece of embroidered cloth) of the Prati- nidhi, we did not come; we came to the JBarsha (12th day) Kutchery only.' His Highness then said—' the office of Pratinidhi being given to him, his (Pratinidhi's) Gasha must remain; the honor which he has received the Sahib has also given him; you are all aware that honor is given at Sattara to the Pra tinidhi.' Narayenrao Raje said—' In the time of the old Maharaja (SyajiRao) Your Highness also sat without the Gasha.' His Highness said—' that was because he (the Maharaja Syaji Rao) was my father. He used to take us on the guddeo also, and we sat below the guddee too. That therefore can't be properly taken into account. Formerly no one used to sit in front of you, but from the time of the old Maharaja (Syaji Rao) the son-in-law began to sit in front; and from the time of Khande Rao (Maharaja) the Senapati Nimbaji Rao began to sit in front, the Dewan used to sit on the opposite side, but from the time of Govind Rao Roday he sits in front of the Nawab. ' What is there in that ? Whatever honor we give it is but proper that you should give also. You are our brethern and by giving honor you honor yourselves.' Narayenrao Raje said—' pardon us for w r hat has been said.' His Highness said—' you may came and say (whatever you like).' Then Narayenrao Raje said—' we hear many things, among which we hear also about 25 per cent.' His Highness said—' the whole Raj expense is Rupees 1,25,00,000. Therefore I reduce my own expenditure also, so you also should reduce your expenses, then all will be right. If not, it is not a mango tree that you may gather as you like. If revenue did not come whence am I to give ? At present the expenses have increased. Of this, how can the Sursoobha Department, Fouj- 29 n-i • xi tp- • i.f rnnvf flip Ee^iments be reduced as they are Departments dan, ie ^ desire to Umit my expenses to whatever were those of the It o' SSSir So &gt;11 .''1M «■»' ^ ' T li'ivc suggested to Commissioner Sahib that ho would give good advice to mv Sirdars and I would send them to him. He has then agreed to that and saicVsond them from 2 to 3 o'clock to me. so has the conversation taken place. Then you should go to him. , ,, c , ■ , The Narayen Kao Haje said, 'Why should we go there? Sirkar is our parents ' ' Thereupon His Highness said, ' You should go there. I am not re- duein' your expenses only, I am reducing yours with that of all others. Naraven Rao Raje said-' nothing less will be taken than the quarter pice (of hrnd^ we are receiving, and if reduction is made some ' third result will ensue (nieaning a sort of incase). Then His Highness said-' The expenses lay upon the whole Rai, so yours also will ho reduced with that of others. then Karaven Rao Raie and Eshwant Rao Raje said,-' The Hewan Sahil. was saying that 25 per cent.' will he reduced, and you say you would reduce the same as Others - von are giving people lakhs of rupees and spend as you like such being the case, is the expense increased on our account only ' V Then His Highness said—' that time income was very large. Therefore it was so done. Now in come is reduced, so vours also will be reduced with that ot others. Narven Rao Rail said—' Mohte Maharaja (Syaji Rao) was saying as long as the wire'will remain in my wife's nose, I shall continue yours (allowance , such being the case you still say so. ' Therefore we should understand that we are dismissed.' Then His Highness said-'I have never uttered the word dismissed, and this will not be at my hands. ' For general expenses yours will have also to be reduced with others. As directed 'by saheb you should go from 2 to 3 o'clock, lie has called you. I shall send the message as you may reply.' Eshwant Rao Raje said,—' To-day my health is not good. We shall all consult to-day and go to-morrow.' His Highness said,—' It is very good to go there.' Then Narayen Rao Raje said to Yeshwant Rao R-aje ' that it is not becom ing that we should go there.' Then His Highness said, ' He is superior, there fore you must go there.' Tlien Nawab Sahib said to His Highness to ' make a settlement about his jaghire.' His Highness replied that 'whatever is to be done will be done with sahib's advice. So you have to go there.' On Margrish Soodh 12th (Sunday)* His Highness had been to the Race Course, when Narayenji Rajay Pandhray came there and had the following conversation with His 20th December 1874. Highness His Highness asked the Pandhray why he had come there, and what he had to say. He replied that ' His Highness should call all the Sirdars and make an amicable settlement with them and not to allow them to go to the camp.' Whereupon His Highness asked him, in what way the amicable set tlement should be made ? When the said Pandhray replied ' that His Highness should call them, and say that he would not make any reduction.' 'Upon this His Highness said tiiat ' as there is a shortness in the income and increase in the expenditure, I have curtailed my own expenses; and so every ones (nemnook) ought to be curtailed. The said Pandhray Rajay thereupon said, we shall not take anything less; and upon our going to the sahib, we will clearly state to thit effect; and by all of us going unitedly to the sahib, it would not look proper. Therefore it would be much better to arrive at a good understanding here. ' Whereupon His Highness asked what w r as to be done with the increased expenses ? You may, if you like, come to that Durbar, and see the increased expenses.' Thereupon the Pandhray replied, ' that they would not 30Zu coSrfif you'^sl/ to 0r s uwT our doing so.

O n Tuesday, the 22nd December 1874, about 300 Sirdars, Sillidars &amp;c of and Special Commissioner, Baroda. They were headed by the Pandrays, the Ghorpady, the Nawab of Baroda [cer Kumaloodeen, and Mecr Ibrahim Ali, and were'received at Durbar bv Sir Lewis Pelly and the Assistant Resident, Mr. Richey.

Sir Lewis Pelly then continued to say that as regards the Sirdars' com plaints against the Durbar, the best wav of restoring a cordial understandino- '^1 0between them and His Highness, and redressing any just grounds of complaint that mio-ht exist, would be for the Sirdars as a body to select two respectable persons as mediators for them, the Durbar to select an equal number, and the four together should endeavour to establish harmony between the sovereign and his Nobles. Sir Lewis Pelly expressed his willingness to olfer Ids aid and advice in this matter whenever required, and asked the Sirdars if they were prepeared to agree to such a mode of settlement; adding that it would be necessary for the British Government to withhold their intervention in respect to those who disagreed. It was also explained that the object was to refer the matter to the media tion and arbitrament of a person or persons who enjoyed the confidence of both parties ; that if instead of two members from eacli side, both concurred in select ing one partieular individual, that would do equally well. The Sirdars unanimously replied in the affirmative, and in doing so stated that they had been much gratified to learn that His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General had been graciously pleased to depute to Baroda a gentleman of Colonel Sir Lewis Felly's position and reputation, and that they felt sure that justice would be done to them. They then adverted to their intimate connection with, and claims on, the State ol Baroda, urging that their ancestors, with the Gaekwar as their head, had won the country and established the Raj, that their services on various important occasions were rewarded by grants of jaghires, inams, allowances, military service, &amp;c.; that these rights were hereditary, and inseparably connected with the Gadee; in fact, that their interests were identical with those of the State, though they owed allegiance and were subordinate to His Highness the Gaekwar as their recognized head ; that their relations with the Gaekwar had always been satisfactory, except for the last few years, when, in the time of His late Highness Khunde Rao, the administration of the State, which till then had been in the hands of the old and experienced servants of the Stite, was entrusted to new and inexperienced favorites; that these persons, with a view to benefit themselves at the expense of the old and hereditary Sirdars, endeavoured to prejudice the mind of the reigning Prince against them; and the unfortunate result had been that their jaghires and inams were confiscated, their allowances stopped, even private pro perty of some of them carried away, and insults heaped upon them ; that the influence of the said evil advisers did not stop there, but also extended to other departments of the State, and ultimately culminated in the general migsovern- ment, which called forth the intervention of the British Government As regards the debts, it was explained that they were first incurred at a time when the country was in a disturbed condition, and when consequently their ancestors had, in order to retain their own prestige as military command ants, to engage the services of more men than their limited allowances per mitted; that the debts so contracted, increased by interest, descended from gene ration to generation, and were further augmented by the irregular way in which their allowances were disbursed by the Durbar. The Sirdars then referred to the fact that His Highness the Gaekwar had lately given a seat of honour on a gold cushion to his late Minister and newly- made Pritinidhi Nana Salieb Khanvelkur, and urged that this involved an insult to their dignity as first class Sirdars of the State ; that even the heir appa rent to the Gadee occupied in the Durbar the same carpet as the Sirdars, and that the present action of the Maharaja was quite unwarranted by precedent. Sir Lewis Pelly observed that questions like this would well come before the arbitrators proposed to be appointed to bring about a cordial understanding between His Highness and the Sirdars, and added that he was well aware that the claims of the Sirdars who had assisted the Gaekwar in acquiring his Raj and performed other important services were deserving of great consideration, for instance, the Nawab of Baroda, whose family, as Sir Lewis Pelly personally knew, was entitled to the greatest consideration, but that at the same time 32 Exd.—J.

Sir Lewis Pelly advised the Sirdars to be quiet and respectful to their sfn ercngn, and not allow themselves to be implicated in any act of disturbance defiance of lawful authority; that if a breach of the peace occured, blame ^ould attach to them if to any one; and His Excellencv the Viceroy, would hold them responsible; that it should be clearly understood that the British (jovernment could not lend their aid in obtaining a just settlement of their grievances, they remained loyal and faithful to their sovereign and strictly maintained a quiet and respectful behaviour. The Sirdars repeatedly assured Sir L^wis Pelly that thev would scrupu lously adhere to their loyal and quiet conduct as hitherto. ihe Sirdars then submitted that their allowances were in arrears for about three years, and that since the receipt of His Excellency the Viceroy's orders on the Commission Report the Dewan, Mr. Dadabhai' had issued a circular proclaiming a reduction not exceeding 25 per cent, in their nemnooks; that this alarmed the Sowcars, who stopped making the customary advances to the oirdars; that on the latter's representations, however, the Durbar promised to cancel the circular and notified their intention to the Bankers, and told them to continue to pay the Sirdars as before; but that no cancelling order having as yet been issued the Bankers refused to make any payment until that were done. Sir Lewis Pelly replied that he had been informed by the Durbar that last year about 12 lakhs of rupees were ready to be disbursed to the Sirdars, but that the latter refused to receive the money ; that he was unable to take anv action in a matter of this sort, which would properly come before the proposed Punchayet ; that if he were to issue an order cancelling the circular referred to as the Sirdars seemed to expect, he would be taking the affairs of the State under his direct management; that such a course materially impaired the authority of the Durbar, which he was most anxious to maintain, and that he wished that all measures of reform and acts of authority should emanate fromthe head of the State. He hoped, however, that when it was known that the Sirdars and His Highness were meditating an amicable arrangement the confi dence of the Bankers would be restored, and that there would be no difficulty about advances pending settlement. The Sndciis stated that in some cases cheques received by them from the Durbar had remained uncashed, payment having been refused by the State Banks. Sir Lewis Pelly desired them to'bring some of these cheques to him when he would adopt measures to satisfy himself that no payment could be obtained. The Sirdars then alluded to the cases of Radhan Meeya, Dhundheray, Kudum, Hurplay, &amp;c., and requested that as the Durbar had entirely stopped their allowances,' it might be arranged to give them an advance for mainten ance. Sir Lewis Pelly enquired whether their cases had been already disposed of or were pending. On the Sirdars stating that the latter was the case. Sir Lewis Pelly promised that, after reference to the records, he would see if such an arrangement could be made. Some of the Maratha Sirdars presented a petition to Sir Lewis Pelly about their caste differences with His Highness in the matter of dining with Rukhmajee, the father of Luxmee Baee, with whom His Highness had recently contracted a marriage; they were told that there being more important work on hand, the matter must be postponed, and that in the meantime the Sirdars might dine with Rukhmajee or not as they pleased, the question being purely a social one. The Sirdars then thanked Sir Lewis Pelly for the trouble he had taken, and expressed themselves much gratified at the result of the interview. After a distribution of pan soparee the Durbar closed.

Reverting to the subjects of the debts, claims, and grievances of the Sir dars and the Sillidars, you are aware that by His Highness' desire the principal Sirdars, &amp;c., waited on me at the Residency and discussed matters at consider able length. My suggestions were that the Durbar should appoint one or two trust worthy persons, and that in like manner the Sirdars should appoint one or two trustworthy persons to enquire into and adjust the debts, claims, and grievances ot the classes. I added that in the event of a difference arising in any parti cular case as between the representatives of His Highness and of the Sirdars, a reterence might be made to me and I should be happy to afford advice to the best of my abitity. Subsequently I had a personal interview with His Highness on the above subjects, and I understood him entirely to approve and sanction the proposed mode ol proceeding in respect to the settlement of these very troublesome, hazardous questions. Oblige me by communicating with His Highness in the above sense and by in oimmg me whether I have correctly understood His Highness' views. 34 (Sd.)

It appeared to me that il 1 at the present moment carried into effect the instructions contained in paragraph 2 of the Government of India Jpttpr No. 2739P. of the 12th instant, I might tend to reagitate the public mind in the Gaekwar's territories in regard to the rights of the infant. For ' to cause such honors to be paid as are usual on the occasion of the birth of a son to the Gaekwar' might lead the nobles and other classes to the conclusion that the Government of India recognized the legitimacy of the infant md that the infant would in all probability inherit the Gadee/ And the entertain ment of this inference by those classes might, I think during the present crisis prove inconvenient. o i 3.

I have the honor to forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter No. 1-5, I have this day addressed to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, on the subject of appointing a Vakeel at the Gaekwar's Court. No. 1-5, dated Baroda, 1st January 1875. From— Col. Sir Lewis Pelly, K.C.S.L, Agent to the Governor-General and Special Commissioner, Baroda, To C. Gonne, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Dept. I n the very numerous^ cases in which British Indian subjects are sub mitted to the jurisdiction of the Courts of His § Not less than ioo per i«num. Highness the Gaekwar, it appears to me highly desirable that a competent Vakeel or Agent should be employed to watch the procedure, and when advisable to represent the British subject, as within my experience was the practice whenever our representative in the Persian Gulf surrendered a subject to the jurisdiction of the Poreign Courts. 2. In the cases of offences alleged to have been committed by British subjects, and in which they have been apprehended by the officers of the Gaekwar, it is the practice that the Durbar should send information of the arrest and nature of offence charged to the Resident; and after the conclusion of the proceedings it is the rule that execution of the sentence should be deferred until the record has been submitted to the Resident, and the sentence received his concurrence. The rigid fulfilment of this procedure has been, to a certain extent, evaded by the Gaekwar, but it is obvious that even if strictly adhered to it hardly offers sufficient guarantees for a prompt trial of the accused persons, and does not preclude the possibilities of rigorous or unfair treatment which it is impossible to ignore as likely to exist under the lax regimt of a Native State. 3. In illustration of my remarks I would beg to invite attention to the orders conveyed in the Resolutions of Bombay Government, Nos. 2101, 1179, 4984 and 5528, of 22nd May 1871, 4th March 1874, 28th August 1874, and 24th September 1874, respectively. It will be seen that in three of the Reso lutions cited the Resident was directed to watch the proceedings of the Baroda Courts in criminal cases, and in the fourth that the Government appearing as a party in a civil case desired to be represented in His Highness' Court. I need hardly point out that for such purposes a competent and trained Vakeel is the proper person to represent either private or public interests. 4. I believe further that it would be of great service in removing causes of complaint in connexion with the administcation of justice in His Highness' Courts if a Vakeel representing British interests were accorded an official position in those Courts, whose duty it would be to watch the procedure, andwhen so ordered by the Resident to attend the trial in the cases of British subjects apprehended or surrendered for offences alleged to have been committed in the Gaekwar territory. 5. If the Vakeel so .employed were allowed, as are the Government Officers and Pleaders in the Mofussil Courts, to take private practice where not incompatible with his official duties, it is, I think, probable that a low rate of remuneration would be sufficient to secure the services of a competent man of good standing, on this point Government can doubtless obtain trustworthy in formation in the Judicial Department; the object of this letter is rather to bring the subject before Government as one which in my opinion calls for early consideration than to submit detailed proposals which may be matured without delay if the Government desire that the suggestion should be carried out.

T he Government of India having telegraphed to me to send certain documents of great importance (connected with the receut attempt to poison the late Resident) to Calcutta by special hand, it occurred to me that the safest and generally most complete manner of obeying this instruction would be to request the Commissioner of Police himself to take charge of the docu ments, and thus be on the spot to submit any further information which the Viceroy in Council may require. 2. Accordingly I have requested Mr. Souter to start hence to-morrow morning direct for Calcutta, where he will arrive on the night of Monday next. 3. I trust that His Excellency in Council will concur with me in con sidering that the course adopted is the most advisable, and that the absence of the Commissioner of Police from his own duties for a few days longer may not prove inconvenient to His Excellency's Government.

At the same time, with reference to paragraph 10 of the letter of the Government of India, No. 2563P., dated the 25th November 1874, I am directed by His Excellency the Governor in Council to bring to your notice that no duplicate of your communication to the Government of India with enclosures on this important subject has as yet been received by this Government, which thereby will be prevented from offering on it such observations as it might appear necessary to His Excellency to make.

The necessity for absolute secrecy and the urgency of the communication made the transmission of a copy imprac ticable. The greater part of the report was written by Sir Lewis Pelly with his own hand. His Excellency in Council is confident that the Government of Bombay will acknowledge the sufficiency of this explanation. 2.
