In this oonneotion it may be pointed out that the presence of huosian troops in the lorthern Province of Persia, whioh has reacted so advantageously on the entire Persian situation, has been diotated primarily by the necessity of guarding the flank of their forces in the Caucasus.

MQTK .- The above programme is on the whole being carried out as originally intended, but since Sir P* Sykes landed at Bunder Abbas on the 16th March. 1916. the following proposals have been made from time to time. - (1) That the training nucleus and a small escort should go off in support of Kawam, assioting the latter to roach Shlras, and leaving the recruits at Bunder Abbas. (This was rendered unnecessary by the Kawaa'e unaided successes). (2) That Shiraz and not Kerman should be tho main objective and orgroiisation point of tho foroe. (Sykee will probably go to Shlras ae soon ao he has sufficiently consolidated at Kerman)• (3) That some British officsrs should be sent via Isfahan to etart the foroo at Bhiras in anticipation of Syko*e arrival.

The pay of Majors has been raised from Krans 12C00 per annum to Krans 14,475 per annum or about Tomans 120 per mensem. 4. In future Captains will be divided into two classes for pay, the second class receiving the same pay as hitherto. (It has been found necessary to raise the pay of certain senior officers whom it is impossible to promote to Major, though they perform their duties well enough in the grade of Captain. 5. Gendarmes will be divided into three classes for pay. It is found that the attraction of higher pay both Induces good trained men to renew their contracts and in the end effects a saving by reducing the numbers in training at the regimental schools. 6. The pay of the proposed 'Corps Mobile' at Tehran is in general lower than that of the Road Gendarmerie, the conditions of service being less onerous. 7. The Budget contemplates the formation of Veterinary and Intendance Colleges at Tehran.

(This does not entail a budget increase as the salary of the present Persian bandmaster is sufficient for a European. 12, General Haalmarson, in his covering letter to the minister of the Interior, begs that effective measures may be taken to ensure that the sums necessary for the development and maintenance of the Gendarmerie may be regularly placed at hie disposal, the success of the whole scheme being absolutely dependent on the regular payment of monthly allotments.Budget. unit, the arrangement being the eame in each case %9 under :•» A. urdlnwy expenditure.

The report concerns British interests in Persia and the recent formation of the South Persia Military Police (abbreviated to SPMP in this file and later known as the South Persia Rifles).The report begins with a brief summary of the events leading up to the present situation, before summarising both the Russian and the British position in Persia. The report describes the circumstances in which the SPMP was formed, and then goes on to provide suggestions for how the force should be organised and distributed. Steel advises that the force embrace the whole of the so-called neutral sphere, and also suggests that it would be 'sheer folly to economize in the number of British officers employed.'The report is followed by two appendices. The first appendix, dated 19 June 1916 and also written by Steel, provides available information regarding the SPMP, including its objectives, details of its personnel, and its financial details (Steel anticipates that half of its expenses will be borne by the Government of India and the other half by the Imperial Government).The second appendix, dated 12 April 1914 and also attributed to Steel, is an abstract of the budget of the Government Gendarmerie, Persia, for 1914-1915. This appendix has two appendices of its own: the first is a summary of Gendarmerie forces as proposed in the preceding budget; the second appendix provides details of the pay of Persian ranks and of the initial cost and upkeep of horses, uniform, equipment and saddlery.A third appendix to the initial report is listed in the contents; however, this appendix has been transferred to another file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Richard Alexander Steel</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military operations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Armed forces</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000162#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
