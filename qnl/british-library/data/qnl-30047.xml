The School was only opened in November last to take the place of a small local school. It is run by the Muscat Government. There are two Indian and two or three local Baluchi teachers. The Headmaster, an Indian, was absent on leave. An attendance chart for the day of my visit is attached. The boys are all Baluchis. They are accommodated in one large room partitioned off into four compartments. Overcrowding is very bad especially in the infants’ class. English and Arabic are taught in the top two classes. There are 30 or 40 Boy Scouts who staged quite a good show in my honour. The same day I paid a very brief visit to the Agakhanis' school in their jamaat-khana. Education is up to the fifth class and English is taught. There are 43 boys and 47 girls in the School. The boys are sent to Karachi for their further education. (ltd.) W.R.H. 6/4/48.

BASHIR AHMEDFrom P.C.M.S Assistant Surfeon, Civil Hospital, Montgomery. No. A/32^ Dated gist Septeifcwri 1948 The Inspector General of Civil Hospitals, West Punjab, Lahore• Sir, With reference to your letter No.270-Res dated 16-1-47 and No.619 dated 1-2-47, I have the honour to submit the following for favour of your sympathetic consideration. I had applied for the post of a Medical Officer at Gwadur (Sultan of Muscat's territory) in accordance with the information contained in your letters under reference. In this connection I have been in correspondence with the Political Agent, Muscat for a long time. I could not re ceive any information about my selection due to the disturb ances in the Last Punjab, till I had come over to Pakistan and had offered my services for refugee work, as an Asaisfcwkt Surgeon in P.C.^.S.Class II, on pufcely temporary basis, in September 1947. I was then riven to understand that the Government had accorded sanction for this post from the date of employment upto the 31st October 1947 (vide Govt, letter No.6036-M-47/ 105 dated 26-8-47, issued under your office endorsement No. 5847-65 E II dated 11-9-47). Due to the unexpected influx of a large number of Refugees the services of medical men were further extended upto 31st. December,1947. On 21st December 1947 I received from the Political /the Agent, Museat,/information of my having been selected for the above post vide his letter ITo.C 590-8/95 dated 29-13-47. I applied for a passport and waited for my expected release and transfer of my accounts from the Banks of i-ast Punjab. Pending the final settlement of the Refugee Population the Govt, have been extending the services of medical men from time to time fixing various dates of termination of their services ( 31st March 1948, 30th June 1948 and finally 30th September 1948.). I have received my passport on 6-9-48 from the Deputy Commissioners office and the last of my Ba:ik Accounts was transfered to Pakistan on 11-9-48. The Refugees from the local Camps according to the programnie published in the papers will soon be moving to other provinces and it is expected that our services will therefore no more be needed. Although I have applied for permanent service/ to the Public Service Commission in August last, when I had lost hope of receiving my passport, I do not see much charce of a success there due to age limit and small number of vacancies xitYKxtnnt advertised by the Commission. I therefore request tne favour of your kindly considering my release from my present post , in order t© enable me to proceed to Gwadur at an early date. Hoping to be favoured with an early reply. I have the hoauur to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, No.A/83. Dated 21-9-48 Copy forwarded to the Political Agent &amp; H.MIS.
