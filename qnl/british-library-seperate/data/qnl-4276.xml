British residents were required to register their presence with the Political Agent, Bahrain on arrival and then annually. This was often done for British workers by their employer. The lists in the file were submitted to the Political Agent, Bahrain by The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited (BAPCO), Petroleum Concessions Limited (P.C.L.), Cable and Wireless Limited, The Eastern Bank Limited and others, 1935 to 1938. A few individual cases are also discussed in the correspondence, for example, a failure to register or ineligibility to register due to lack of a valid British passport. Among these individual case papers is an identity certificate containing a black and white passport size photograph and a revenue stamp in rupees (folio 38).The file also contains a few annual statistical returns. These were compiled by the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Residency Agent, Sharjah and then sent to the Political Resident, Bushire. The statistical returns provide the number of British subjects, British Indian subjects and British protected persons living in Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms and the numbers employed in oil, 1937 to 1938 (folios 160-164, 191-192, 221).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00007f#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00007f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00007f#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00007f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00007f#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
