Correspondence is chiefly between the British Legation at Tehran and the Foreign Office. The papers include: multiple copies (in English translation and French original, including two press cuttings from
                           Le Messager de Teheranand the
                           Journal de Tehran) of various laws and regulations regarding marriage and divorce in Persia, passed by the Persian Government. The new laws passed by the Persian majlis reflect the Government’s desire to increasingly regulate marriages between non-Persian men and Persian women; observations on the laws and regulations made by HM’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Tehran, Robert Henry Clive, Reginald Hervey Hoare, and Reader William Bullard. These observations refer to Christian marriages in Persia, the question of marriage between Muslims and non-Muslims, and the consular certification of marriages; instructions for HM’s Consular Officers in Persia on the registration and issue of certificates for marriages, in accordance with the Persian Government’s marriage regulations. The file includes a number of draft texts for certifications of ‘no impediment’.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Marriage certificate</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mixed marriages</topic></subject><subject><topic>Registration of marriage</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00000c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00000c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00000c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
