Each also has other unconvincing details not typical of the period. The head on the roundel wears a necklace of unknown type and appears to emerge from some sort of egg. The arch is much too small to be a true tomb arch of the type seen elsewhere in this exhibition. The unidentifiable figure in its center is overshadowed by a welter of unrelated animals and decorative motifs. The male figure, unlike a true funerary representation, turns away from the viewer. His garment has no historical parallels, and the object in his hand is unrecognizable.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2009-05-06", "date_added": "2009-05-06 09:48:15", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "68.153", "object_id": 94148}, {"accession_number": "60.212", "object_id": 78256}], "geographical_locations": [], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "72.9_PS1.jpg", "id": 34342, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/72.9_PS1.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/72.9_PS1.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 61, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 122, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 244, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 488, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 976, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/72.9_PS1.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Figure of a Man in High Relief</em>, 20th century.
