Akbar brandishes an elephant goad, or hook, similar to the example displayed in the case to your left.\r\n\r\nIndia’s majestic elephants, used in parades, hunting expeditions, and warfare, were frequently associated with royalty. In imperial Mughal biographies, royal historians often connected the emperor’s might to his ability to control and tame nature’s beasts. Akbar’s biographer Abu’l Fazl describes the emperor’s mastery of these powerful animals: “His Majesty mounts every kind of elephant, from the first to the last class, making them, notwithstanding their almost supernatural strength, obedient to his command.”\r\n", "CreditLine": "Gift of John and Berthe Ford, 2001", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/35955", "Keywords": "Islamic; Mughal; Illustration; Drawing; India; History", "Provenance": "John and Berthe Ford, Baltimore; given to Walters Art Museum, 2001.", "Dynasty": "Mughal Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Indian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.873.A_Fp_DD-tms.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.873.A_Fp_DD-tms.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.873.A_Fp_DD-tms.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.873.A_Fp_DD-tms.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.873.A_Fp_DD-tms.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1503689", "ExhibIDs": "2071", "Images": "CPS_W.873.A_Fp_DD-tms.jpg, CPS_W.873.B_Fp_DD-tms.jpg, CPS_W.873_Det_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
