He also told me that there was some hitch about the forces c.fthelmam entering the Wadi Ismail; either the Bani Ruwaha refused to allow the Bam Riyam to enter, or the Bani Riyam themselves refused to enter, the Wadi Samail.

The “Noor al Bahar” has now (noon) left for the Batina. I hear Isa-bm-Saleh has reached Izki, but with only a small following, as he said m the letter which I sent on to you. I told Saiyid Faisal that I had asked for Murphy “ ex abundante cauteia , so that he might look around and see what precautions it might be necessary to take in the event of strong measures being inevitable. His High ness approved and said that he saw no harm if one of the launches, in about ten days time, ran up the Batina coast and back, touching at the ports en route, to reassure our nationals. He explained that he had carefully abstained from asking assistance so far, as he was anxious that a small affair snould not grow into a big one, as it certainly would, if the English showed great activity. Tjns_ seemed an eminently sensible view. If any more news ot interest comes aloDg by Monday, I will try and write to you again on the subject, bo far the rising does not appear serious, though it is troublesome. Enclosure No. 2 . Dated Maskat, the 80th June 1913 (Confidential). From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have little to add to my letter of the 26th June, though, this morning, I auly conveyed to His Highness the message of your telegram No. 1153, dated ^otn June 1913. His Highness was rather busy, as the “Noor al Bahar ” Bad just come in with Saiyid Timur. The latter said that the Imam andIk Isa-Mn-Saleh are still in Izki and that 600 men from Jaalan hare reached B.dbid, under the command of Muhammad-bin-Nasir, a nephew of the old Amir, who died lately. Shaikh Hammad is there too f f Saiyid Nadir wanted these Jaalanies in Samail, but the Sultan wil no let them go there, as he fears that the Imam’s forces rmght wander round by the Wadi Aqq and he hopes that at Bidhid they will cover the coast roads and Hatrah and Maskat eifectively. * I have also had some letters read oyer to me from Saiyid ISadir and others. . — . , On the 22nd of Bajib (27th of June), Saiyid Nadir writes “ When Isa-bm- Saleh came to Izki, Abdullah-bin-Said Al khalih (Hinawiyah Shaikh of A llaiyah and of the Bani Buwaha) and the people of Waluba (also Hinawiyal,) consulted among themselves and the matter was difficult for them and they knew that if the (rebel) army reached (Samail), they might be fought against by the fort (in which is Saiyid Nadir) and they wanted to consult them (the Imam, Isa, &amp;c.) and see what their intention might be. then the Sultan (bin Mansur, Shaikh of the Al Wahiba) desired to go to them and asked leave ot us for this purpose and we gave him leave.” This man s father, Shaikh Said-bin-Khalfan Al Khaliii, chief adviser of the Imam Aazan, was killed by Saiyid Turki. A letter from Shaikk-bin-Salam of the Shaikhs or Samail, written on 21st Rajib to Shaikh Raskid-bin-Azayaz, sa\s And as for the Shaikh Khaliii and the Al Wahiba, they have advised the Imam to pass by Jay la and not to come by Al Alayah. Wadi Jayla is full of Rani Jabir of the Ghafiri ” The letter goes on to say that all these people, including the inhabitants of Samail, are all traitors. I have also seen a letter from Ali-bin-Abdullah-bimSaid al Khaliii ^ to Saiyid Nadir in which, after excusing himself for the surrender of Izki (which was mainly due to his Ali , s treachery), he says that he met Isa-bin-.j5aleh at Izki with 30 men and the latter was ready to mediate, but the Imam and Shaikh As Salimi refused to listen to any talk of peace and told him to desist from such efforts. x By the general attitude of those about me and Saiyid Faisal’s demeanour, I gather that reports from the front are reassuring and that at least there is no immediate danger of an attack on Matrah or Maskat or on the coast ports. By the way, my policeman tells me that Ali Khan lost a fine big consignment of rifles and ammunition which the Imam confiscated when Nizwa fell. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. Enclosure No. 3. No. 99, dated the 7th July 1913. From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I enclose herewith a heap of correspondence from the Imam and certain of his followers addressed to His Highness the Sultan, his sons and adherents. It is interesting merely as showing the character of the rising and the way the Imam is usurping authority. I have hardly time to comment on it and your ^ knowledge of Oman and its people will no doubt enable you to identify the writers as well, if not better than, I can. I will now proceed to give the narrative of the last three days as well as I can. The news of one day will, as is only natural, conflict with that of the next and the more recent is the more reliable. On the 4th of July, the French Consul came to see me after his cere monial visit to the American Consul. Though he put his visit down to a mere casual call, there was no doubt that he wanted to learn our attitude in the event of the Imam’s rebellion succeeding, and it was clear that he expected our intervention. He spoke long on the folly of these Arabs, asked what better kind of a ruler they could hope for, as he never took anything from them in the way of tribute, but, on the contrary,distributed money to them periodically and never oppressed them. He alluded to the bombardment of Zanzibar, at which he was present, and told how, up to the very evening of the bombardment, he could not get the Arabs to’realise that a bombardment would take place. He said that he had been told that the Imam had given out that he was going to Hombay and that to his inform ant he replied that it was probably true, but that it would be under a corporal’s escort with a fettered Imam. It was from the French Consul too that I learnt that the Imam had been collecting zikat and pulling up tobacco plants, &amp;c., which had made him unpopular. Talking this over with the Sultan later, I was informed that he had not heard much of this but, if it was true that the Imam had been collecting zikat, he was delighted to hear it. On the 5th of July, I went to the Sultan to gather news and he told me the following : — Hamad-bin-Abdullah, Shaikh As Sharkiyin, inhabitant of Fujairah, came to Sohar with 500 men and wanted to garrison Sohar. When it was suggested to him that he should go up to the front, he withdrew to his own countrv. » The reason that the Bani-bu-Ali cannot send more help to the Sultan is that they fear the intrigues of one Said. Said-bin-Saleh As Sanaidi of the Sinada section of the J3ani-bu-Ali is friendly to their rivals, the Bani-bu-Hassan. Timur arrived yesterday in the “ Noor al Bahar ” from Sohar, which is quiet. Hammad is still in Burka, Muhammad-bin-Nasir Al Alawi and Muhammad-bin-Badar-bin-Saif in Bidbid, and Nadir in Samail. It was on this day in the forenoon, when I was very busy, that I was surprised by a visit from Monsieur A. B. Menasche who came to see me as Agent for the Field Bifle Company, Messrs. Laubenburg, &amp; Co. I had been told that morning by His Highness that Menasche had made overtures of some kind to Saiyid Kasim with a view of ascertaining whether it would be possible to obtain permission to reship those goods for Europe. He said the same thing to me and I thought there was no point in bandying words with him as to his late apparently unscrupulous conduct. He also told me that his principals had informed him that they had learnt that certain concessions might be arranged for them and he would be glad to learn the nature of those concessions. I replied that I was not in a position to say exactly what the nature of those concessions might be off. hand, but that an indispensable preliminary would be submission to the warehouse, at least to the extent of formally claiming the arms. He said that it would be impossible for his principals to get rid of the arms by retail sale. I said that I thought he exaggerated the difficulty and that, if his principals submitted to the warehouse, I could probably arrange for a wholesale riddance of their stock. I then got rid of him, as I was thronged with work. On the 6th of July, while Captain Ballard, R. N., of the “ Philomel ” and I were inspecting the new coal jetty which I was taking over from the Public Works Department, we were rather surprised to see His Highness row up alone to the jetty to meet us there in a small bellum, rowed by three boatmen only. He came and gave me the news that resulted in my telegram No. 98 of 6tb July 1913, and I made it clear to him that he was r]efirj,tely our intervention and that I should ask for troops to be landed at Matrah. He fully concurred and, of his own accord, turned round to Captain Ballard, as he left, and said that he would be detained here at Maskat longer than he expected. His Highness seemed greatly cast down by the retreat of the Bani-bu-Ali. The Bani-bu-Ali were brought back by His Highness from Watiya, as my telegram No. 98 was being despatched. They are at present billeted in and around the mosque that Nasib built. I have warned their Shaikh, Muhammad-bin-Nasir Al Alawi, against looting, and he assured me that he would look after his men. I have so far received no serious complaints of their conduct, though, of course, their evil reputation is notorious and British subjects are depositing their valuables in the Consulate for safe custody. His Highness has, by beat of drum, warned all inhabitants of the suburbs that it is unsafe to stay outside the walls at night.4 Murphy has been studying the locality and the question of supplies. H e has been the round of the suburbs of Matrah, Darsait, W atiya, 11awi, &amp;c., under the charge of the Naib Wali of Matrah, whom he praises as one of the most intelligent and well-informed guides he has ever met. He has been extremely well received everywhere, has got all the information that he needed and far more than he expected. He tells me that he has made an exhaustive examination of Matrah itself and its capabilities. The Sultan placed his launch at his disposal one morning. On the 7th July, wdiile I was interviewing the Sultan, Hill, Ballard and Murphy made the round of Maskat and came to the conclusion that they could easily hold Maskat town itself from the walls with 100 men from the ships and four maxims. If troops are landed from Bushire or elsewhere, Murphy thinks that the strategical point is Bawi, which would enable us to screen both Maskat and Matrah and get our people out of the town’s confusion. This last is the latest news that I gleaned from His Highness this morning. Saiyid Hammad-bin-Paisal returned to Watiya at the Asr yesterday. ' At Bidbid, there is still a small garrison of 12 Hadhramies under the sons of Salinj- bin-Said, A1 Akbari. They really ought to be 30 men, but as usual the Akid draws the money for 30 and keeps up only a dozen. These men had a brush with the Bani Jabir, who, on hearing of the departure of the Bani-bu-Ali and the Shihuh, tried to take the fort, but were driven back with the supposed loss of four men. In the Wadi Aqq is a miscellaneous company of Suris, drawing pay for 70 men, hut probably only 40. At Samail, there have been a few casualties on the side of the enemy, especially at the house of Shaikh Rashid-bin-Azaiyaz and the bazaar, which Kadir has been cannonading. Possibly 12 men killed and wounded on the night of the Imam’s arrival. The “Noor al Bahar ” has gone to Sur to try and get more men. The Commander’s orders are if they cannot get them, the “ Noor al Bahar ” should bring away the garrison. His Highness explained to me that the object of this rather singular order was that the Suris are so afraid of the Bani-bu-Hassan that, if they heard that, otherwise, Sur would be denuded of its garrison, they would be induced to send along a sufficient contingent.

Then, let them go forth, before they see what they hate. And say “ Truth has come and falsehood has fled, for falsehood is a runaway. ” Then there is no protection against the Imam and no security without him and no staying away from him and no one can take refuge away from him nor turn him from his path nor oppose his orders.

And it is not long since we informed thee that all who are around thee are against thee and perhaps the truth of my saying has become clear to thee and also the disinterestedness of my advice. Then, if thy desire is safety in both worlds, enter into what the Muslims have entered, and, if thy desire is for this world’s goods only, then look out for thyself a way of escape before thou art surround ed, and I hope for a reply by him who brings this letter and I ask God that he may reveal to thee the right course.

McMahon, G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E,, C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In case there mav be any development of the movement, I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India, an extract from the last Maskat Diary dated 24 th May, dealing with an embryo rising against the Sultan on the part of certain disaffected tribes of the Wadi Maawal and the Nazwah district. Extract from Maskat Agency Diary No. 21-486 for the week ending 24 th May 1913 - Several reports have been received by His Highness the Sultan during the week from Rustaq, Nazvah and other places to the effect that what may prove to be a powerful rising is forming in those quarters under the ring-leadership of the Chief Abadhi Shaikh, Abdulla bin Hamed as Salimi, who, himself an old and almost blind man, wishes to proclaim a religious war against the Sultan with the object of setting up his son-in-law Salim bin Rashid as Imam of Oman, the cause being the supposed leaning of the Sultan to Foreign Governments and institutions. This faction comprises the tribes of Bani Riyam Ibriyin and the Bani Hina tribes of Jabal-Riyam and Wadi al-Maawal; the troubles originated at the village of Tanuf, near Nazwah, and it is supposed that the rebels might come down on Nazwah and Rustaq as both of these places are said to be insufficiently garrisoned by His Highness the Sultan’s askaris. His Highness the Sultan seems perturbed at these manifestations and is taking steps to strengthen his garrisons at Nazwah and Rustaq with men and provisions, but it is feared that he may be unable to do so, as it is believed that the communications are in the enemies’ hands. Letters received subsequently and transmitted by His Highness to the Political Agent show that the ring-leader is already calling himself the Imam of the Muslims and has been trying to persuade the Chiefs of the Bani Ruwaha and other smaller neighbouring tribes to join his cause.

Extract from Maskat News No. 22 -$i$ ) for the week ending gist May 19/j. Condition of Country. 204. With reference to Diary entry No. 190, His Highness’ Steam Yacht proceeded to Masna with Saiyid Nadir and Hamad on board returning on the 26th evening. It was said that they would collect men and proceed to Rustaq. 205. On the 27th some of His Highness’ tupchis left by overland for Bidbith where they will join Saiyid Nadir. The same day news reached Maskat that Bani Ibriyin, an influential tribe, had forsaken the Imam Salim bin Rashid A 1 Kharusi. 206. On the 2qth news reached Maskat that fighting had taken place at Nizwa between the forces of His Highness and those of the Imam. The number of casualties was 12 killed from His Highness’ forces. The report said that Wali Saif bin Hamed Saiyidi was wounded and the 2 forts were occupied by His Highness’ men and the Masjid by the Wali. 207. Letters received by His Highness on the 26th, 27th, 30th and 31st said that there was no news from Sharqiyah as to the people joining the rebels or to the contrary. Letter received on the 27th stated that an attack was imminent from those outside and the people of Nizwa were vigilant. Subsequent letters received stated that the people from the quarter of Al Muddah proved treacherous and allowed the enemy to enter their quarter but not without resistai ce from the Wali of Nizwa and the loyal portion of the people. Reports received on the morning of the 31st say that the injury received by the Wali is slight. That the strength of As-Salami and his Imam has not increased beyond that the Bani Riyam and Bani Hinna have entered the town of Nizwa and have gained possession of the quarters thereof by the treachery of the inhabitants. The 3 strong positions—the 2 forts and the Masjid and the Beyt Salit—are still fighting. 208. S. Y. “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” left for Masna on the evening of the 30th with provisions and arms and returned on the morning of the 31st. She is taking in coal. The * Nur ul-Bahr” left later for Sur, where it is reported that the family of the Amir of Ja’a-lan have come and His Highness fears that they must be contemplating an attack on the Bani Bu Hassan. All these disturbances are causing His Highness much anxiety. C30FD —44—19 6«i 3—GC BP Simla34. 0 s.D.Code tele ;r am. l T o: 352. Oated 9.7.13. To, P.R.i F.D.

I also append three letters, one from S’aud al Jabri and two from the rebel leaders, in reply to letters addressed to them by the Jennebeh Chiefs, exhorting them to return to their allegiance. The letters are interesting, in that they set forth the alleged causes that led to this revolt against His High ness’s authority. 3. A copy of this letter is being forwarded, with its enclosures, to the Hon’ble the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, for information. Sub-Enclosure No. 1. Translation. Letter from Shaikh S'aud bin Ali al Jabri to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, dated the 11th July 1913. After compliments.—'W q have formerly sent letters to you and hope they have arrived. Then we inform you about these rebels, Bani Riyam; we have approached them with reference to abstaining from fighting against the Fort and now the siege is slackening and the loop-holes are further away from the fort; and there are many wounded and dead among the enemy ; and none of the friends of Saiyid Nadir have been injured except that the gunner was slightly wounded at the beginning of the affair. And we have informed you about Isa going off to besiege Bidbid at the request of the Haddariyin; and they have not approached it but have alighted in the date trees of the Maha- | shilah. And to-day a messenger has arrived desiring the Bani Rawaha to send him 100 men. And the whole forces of the enemy are less than 2,000 men and they would not amount to that much, were it not for the people of Sayma and Muharram. And yesterday we addressed Himyar by the tongue of Muhammad and to-day we have met together and have addressed and have done our best to make him refrain. And he says—' I have given my promise and pledge and cannot break them, but it is better that the Shaikhs of the people of Sur should come and those of the Jaalanis who are with them and should address themselves to Isa and with them Shaikh Rashid; and that they should ask Isa to go between and that he should assist those who come. But the beginning of the questioning and of the conversation is with Isa-bin-Saleh, so that they may think that there is previous knowledge between us and them. And, if Shaikh Rashid and his party come, it is better that a peace be made for otherwise they are ready for battle and the enemies are not many, only two thousand. And now they are distributed between Bidbid and Samail and2 * i. b*- «»t v * 5 “ sxci S .K,';; ot r»e.), «. ; A aS:b..Ld ab«.t 3 o’clock in the a[,«a th^eWe are besfeged and no help is sent to them. And we anticipated all this trouble from the people of Samail and warned you about it; and now all the people of the Sifala are assisting the Imam in various ways and abuse your noor servant and letters constantly come to me; sometimes they ask for cartridges and sometimes they demand that I should go with them and some, times thev demand mv allegiance and sometimes they say that your messengers „ 0 through me to Saivid Nadir. They do not leave a single arrow unshot from their quiver, but by God’s grace nothing of all this enters my ears (*.«., I am not affected by them). And we hope from God that he turn their devices against them and, if they get the mastery, there are plenty of other places by sea and land for me to live in and the rest of the news by the tongue of your servant Ali bin Muhammad. p t £. y e s! and when the aforesaid arrive, let them bring with them special letters for the Bani Jabir and the Siyabiyin to come with all their Arabs. If you have got profit and peace, well; and if not, then you must fight. And the Bani Jabir and the people of Jayla and of Tau in spite of their past actions, perhaps they regret them ; but the people of Hil and Saija and remainder of their tribes are ready for war. And the better opinion is with you, but conversation and peace-making are of no use without strength and he who looks at the present only does not see anything except the present. And there should also be a letter for them all Ad Dabiyin and Ar Rahbiyan and the Bani Jabir and As Siyabiyan to assist the peace-makers warning them against assisting the Imam, and you know best and this is my opinion, and please tear this letter up after you have read it. Sub-Enciostjee No. 2. From—Shaikh Sahid-bin-Ali-bin-Jabar-bin-Muhammad-bin-Nasir-al Jabri, inhabitant of the village of Khobar in Wadi Samail of the people of Safala. (He is the most important of the Ghafari Shaikhs who live in the Wadi of Samail.) To—Shaikhs Muhammad-bln-Mobarak and Sa'id-bin-Salim and Abdullah-bin-Kbami« and Salim-bin-Ahdullah and Jum^a-bin-Nasir and Muhammad-bin-Khamis and Abdullab-bin-Mobarak, and the whole community of the Jannabah. After compliments .—Your honoured letter reached and your friend has understood its meaning from beginning to end. Know, O ! Shaikhs, if the opinions of the people of the Wadi Samail were with me, there would have been no affair of this kind but they have invented a new opinion of their own and our master Faisal knows the truth of the matter that I do not control their affairs and how should they see to the opinion of this poor one (himself) and they despise the generosity of the great one who has loaded them with generosity and benefited them and has kept away their enemies.^ Do not blame me for any trouble that comes from them. And the Shaikh Hamyar, we have informed him and asked of him that he should refrain from hostility and we were unable to prevail with him- He said‘‘that he had come to an agreement with the Imam and As Salimi t ie , J anna hah Shaikhs wanted to make peace, let them address Shaikh Isa first and he was mBidbid besieging the fort there and with him about 20 ° men And let Isa address the Imam and the Salimi. ” But I think that this sedition will not be allayed except by a similar opposition and, while we i 0thlng 1 wili be done - And the rebels are less than 2,000 men and none of the people of these parts fight on their side with (Sh f ikh Ar “ni), and Hamaid (^aikh ^ ^ U 'lt t Aqq) ‘ Anditis Sported to me that they have returned from Shaikh Isa irmn Bidbid to gather greater strength from /3 (mW f war ?ninw liter- ming . the he in ^hile id all w all your k for some, ngers from ^ I am ivices \J :es by your them their must ite of Saija ion is ength esent. biyan them , and ; abitant (He is atnail.) vliamil shamis ih. d has f the have on of hat I )f this 5 who kept j from [ him i him- Salimi Jhaikh about k that le we s thaa i with kk A n ; they i from tlieir tribesmen. And let Saiyid Faisal look to his affairs and ye also. And ood is in the womb of evil. And if these forts remain besieged and are not assisted, there is no doubt that they will fall into their hands. And if the King comes in his strength, facing them with strong troops, to the Wadi Samail, in my opinion, the people of the Wadi Samail will not combine ao-ainst him, hut some will be with him and some against. And when I saw the people of these parts treacherous, I informed His Highness about that and described it to him fully and advised him strongly to bring troops with speed, but the Saiyid thought better and thought is a dream and salaam.

After compliments .—Your esteemd letter to us reached and we understood it. And you are thanked (or it is kind of you). W’hat you mentioned we have known. And that you want us to desist from helping the Imam and all Islam. So, know, O ! tribe, that we have not the power to stand up for this except with this just Imam. And all the people of Oman have arisen for his help. And you stated that you arrived at Maskat in answer to invitation of the Sultan and that you do not find an excuse from Maskat (can not manage without it) because it is your oath or vow. Then, know, O! tribe, that we know him who compelled you. Eirst, in the case of the sixteen men whom he beheaded of your community to please the Christians. And four* men in the treasury of the Fort of Nizwah. This is what we know has been quartered on you. And as to ourselves, it is not hidden to you, that our enmity y (hostility) has been our aim for ten years, until God has facilitated it this year by the help of this Imam. And my advice to you is that you should follow the Eight and give up the Wrong. And as to what you mentioned that we have an excuse (alternative) from this Government then, know, O ! tribe, how can we excuse ourselves when we have made the bai’at of (sworn allegiance to) this just Imam. God save us from going astray to Falsehood ! To-day messengers arrived here from Sharqiyyah to the ellect that they all intend to fight against (attack) Ja’alan and that they want a commander from the Imam and they are ready. But I took pity on you and have delayed that until w-e acquaint you with it. So, if you accept my advice, manage your towns, you as w T ell as the people of Ja’alan. Otherwise, there is no way (blame) on those w'ho do good. And as for what you remarked regarding Maskat that it will come under the control of the Christians, then, if there were injury, you w'ould he nearest thereto and suffer most therefrom. And we are, by Grace of God, in freedom from that. Usual ending. Sub-Enclosure No. 4.

After compliments—Youv esteemed letter reached me and I understood its meaning, dnd you mentioned that the Sultan’s invitation came o you and you accepted it, intervening for peace and that you warn the peop e of Oman from fighting against the Christians and of what has betailen the Turks. And it is known that that is a fearful matter and it is what which has excited the people of Oman to rise up. And as for ) v t a ^ as befallen the Muslims at their hands in the inhabited directions (countries), tor the free, death is better than life in that condition.

But we do not remit in our endeavours. The Muslim slave of the Sultan is more beloved to us than a mushrik (politheist). And when your letter reached, I was not present in Samail, so that I might know what there took place, and I do not know what Shaikh Ilamyar answered you with, for he is the base (or foundation) of the government. (True) goodness is that which is evidenced by enemies. May God put us on the right road and He is enough for us and the best caretaker. Usual ending.

The utmost limit of Sarnail holding out is placed at one month &amp; all three are convinced that, if Samail St Bidbid fall,a for- midable rising will confront us .

While the many strong objections to such a committing move are fully recognised by me , this appears to me to be the only alternative to Mas at &amp; Muttra being occupied indefinitely and I there fore suggest it as , in the long run , saving time 1 expense &amp; affording the only possibility of reestablishing the status quo ante . I shall have no difficulty whatever in obtaining* the written request of H.H. .

With reference to Diary entry No. 208, the ' Nur-ul-Bahr ” returned on the 2nd with the Wali of Sur on board. This shows that Sur at least is quiet and causes His Highness no anxiety. 216. On the 3rd news reached Maskat that His Highness 1 man Ambar, who was proceeding to Nizwah with 15 others with 21 bags rice, 3,000 rounds ammu nition and $100 in cash, had oeen looted and murdered by the rebels and two others wounded. 217. On the 2nd the “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” left for Sib with the Wali of Sur and about 100 fighting men on board. From Sib they were to go to Bidbith. The 4 ‘ Nur-ul-Bahr ” returned to Maskat on the evening of the same day. 218. On the 4th His Highness received a letter from Rustaq written by his relation, Ahmed bin Ibrahim, to the effect that the Baiyt Salit and the Tower had fallen in the hands of the rebels. The letter also mentioned that the only 2 positions that remained to His Highness were the fort and the Masjid. 219. His Highness states that the next objective of the Imam and his following will be Rustaq. Ahmed bin Ibrahim is between the devil and the deep sea, as he cannot withstand the Imam and is afraid to ask help from his High ness as the result of a successful defence of Rustaq with the help of His High ness would be, he fears, that Rustaq would revert to the Sultan. 220. On the 5th news reached Maskat that the rebels had taken the Fort of Nizwah and thatlthe Wali, Saif bin Hamedh, had shot himself before the rebels entered the fort. He wrote a note to His Highness in which he stated that he died by his own hand. 221. On the night of the 4th His Highness, hearing that some sympathisers of the Imam who had come from Zanzibar were taking arms for the Imam by a sailing boat, despatched Saiyid Taimur in the steam cutter after them. Saiyid Taimur overtook the dhow and brought it to Maskat. Three men were imprisoned and the arms and money found with them taken charge of. 1 he arms were purchased from French merchants. 222. On the 5th His Highness beared that some fighting had taken place at Khaburah among the Hawasinah and 40 men had been killed. The Nur-ul- Bahr” was at once despatched to Khaburah at night returning to Maskat the following day.

Beyond that point, the advance would be up a valley , whose breadth is never less than $ a mile . While 2,000 is H.H,’s estimate of numbers of rebels, Sultan T s brother said that thet|* Fanaticism was aroused but that ten thousand would 'oe their utmost strength. This last is the highest estimate I have received . The rebels would have a fair supply ammunition &amp; would be well armed with large proportion of modern rifles . The siege of Samail shows poor fighting qualities &amp; so far the strategy of rel^els has displayed no enterprise .

Their view is that , if we decide to despatch troops , they must be sufficiently strong to be able unaided to relieve Samail or avenge Seyyid Nadir , Despatch of troops is , in my opinion , on whatever basis they work , what the situation calls for and , if the tele- gran which we await from Knox indicates no change in the situation , we should without put the work in hand . As Syud Nadir has held out so lopg , I firmly believe that , as soon as they hear that we have landed troops at Sib , the rebel rank &amp; file will melt away and that the relief of Nadir will be easy matter . If however before our men reach Sib , Samail falls , a fresh impetus will be given to the rebellion and the recapture of tne position will involve more difficulty .

I went as far as I could ven ture in informing H.H. J,hat, in running the grave risks he did with a following who had so recently and so often displayed their unwillingness to fight 2c their disaffection , he was treating Govt: unfairly .

So I hastened to make ready to come, but a letter came to me from the valiant Saiyid Hamad bin Eaisal, stating that he had reached Hamim village and calling me to go to him with all Arabs bearing arms in order to oppose the enemy from the East. So I hastened to respond to his invitation and to gather my people together and to induce them to comply as a duty which they owe to you. And I could not leave them to come to you as they would not assemble for anyone except myself. I warned them not to lose (your favour) bv any default of theirs at a time when armies are face to face, firing is going on and the flames of war are up on every side. And I thought it advisable to stay by them. And the country of your servants the Siyabiyin is guarded on all sides. And Nejd (a small tract in those parts) is empty; there are no Hinawiya there. We pray to God for good and for His Providence. And the cneraies , host is engaged in their own affairs {i.e , 9 are quarrelling among them selves). If you come by way of Nejd, no harm will come to you. Your own discretion or opinion is best and I, your servant, have nothing to say against what you think lit. Usual ending.

The messenger knows that they have started and we expect them to-night and, after consulting them, we shall go on to Jaylah. And we enclose their letter for your perusal and also the letter of Mohsin bin Zahran as Siyabi who has blackened his face, he and his tribesmen. On the arrival of our party at Bidbid, it was they who first began to fire (upon us). Be so good as to expedite the despatch of provisions and ammunition.

And what has happened to Saiyid Nadir has not sufficed them. So, now our intention is to oppose whoever opposes the truth, insha-Allah 1 And they are in your village (country). And you should not prevent us (from coming into your territory or village). So, raise your hands off all (those concerned) ie. (be neutral). And reply is requested.

After compliments .—Me understand that you have arrived in this Wadi (intending) to oppose the Imam of the truth. So, we chose to advise you to desist and return. And a wiseman will not prefer the first (this world) to the second (the hereafter). Truly the greatest loser (most unfortunate man) on the day of judgment is he who disposes of his religion (faith) for the world (by gain) of another man. This was said by Him (the Prophet). May peace and the blessings of God be upon him! And true faith consists in wishing the welfare of all. And let not false stories of those men who cannot hope for terms or immunity deceive you. And you are not greater in honour than Saiyid Nadir. They left or deserted him, so that he has suffered what has befallen (as is known).

And the reply comes to you with this messenger whom we now despatch. Please acknowledge by return. The news of Samail is as we have already informed you of. And we pray you to use extreme despatch in succouring Saiyid Nadir. We sent one to see the tunnel and he found that it was ready, wanting only a single day’s w r ork, not more. And how r wonderful is all this delay on Your Highness’s part while the tunnel is being worked up day and night. And this Government (the enemy) is not strong. If only 1,000 men were stationed in Safalah, they (the enemy) would not stand one hour! And the people of Safalah and the Bani Jabir wdll lean towards you as soon as you arrive. And now the most injurious thing of all is this tunnel which they did not find hard to work up in the least. And the fort is beleagured. And your servants have been continuously informing you of all this. Saiyid Nadir has had a showier of communications from the aggressors and has not answered them. But, our master ! w hat is needed, is someone on the opposite side (in face of the enemy). And the best thing would be for you to come forward immediately with succour. And Hamyar only watches when you should appear. The moment you reach Samail he would not stand an hour against right. But it all rests with you. Also trouble has arisen amongst Bani Brahim of Hel, and Muhammad bin Saiyid was struck with a sw r ord while standing in prayer and sustained three severe wounds. And the assailant was his relation Ali bin Muhajnmed bin Sait. And some shots w r ere exchanged between your servants Aulad Sarhan and Aulad Aziz and a truce has been arranged between them for seven days. We hope our own preceding letters and those from Saiyid Nadir have reached you by hand of Saiyid bin Saiyid. It is rumoured the tunnel has been completed and will he fired on the noon of the 13th (18th July) and God controls everything. Let this be known to you and we are awaiting your orders. Lsual ending.

After compliments.— In the happiest hour w 7 e received your honoured letter, dated the 10th instant, and your slave understood its meaning, especiallythe wall which you suggested should be built. Praise be to God for the unity of hearts! Since we heard about the tunnel, my comrades have resolved to build a wall from the place which you pointed out to us and Insha-Allah by your goodness, all will be well. And about what the Shaikhs have considered proper as to negotiations w'e have already written to you at length, all that is (known) here, in the previous letters and we think that would be sulficient.

He and his people are all well, by the grace of God. His reply will reach you. We thought it well to send your messenger back immediately. Then, as to the tunned, it is ready. We sent trustworthy men and they found it ready and gone into the fort about 5 Ha’a (yards). And gunpowder has reached them from Nizwah about half a Bahar (20 Maskat maunds) in weight. They intended to fire it, but we went to As Salimi and Hamyar and asked them for delay until we informed you. To-night 1 sent your servant Saif bin Sallam to Thani and Mohsin. They are going to-morrow to ask for 3 days’ delay. 0 ! our Master, we do not know why there is this delay on your part. If you do not take steps to relieve your son, Saiyid Nadir, he is hard-pressed and without relief from you, most serious consequences will follow. And there is no need to leave troops in Maskat. It is best that they come up here, though it be only 300 men. We do not tell you to do anything except to send reinforcements or relief, and nothing but the goodness of God can be any avail. Salaam. Written with salaams by Saif bin Sallam with his hand. J*' And as for Bani Jabir, do net suppose they are any good. Their condition or attitude is notorious.

Let any one who meets with this letter know that many people have cons tantly been asking the Imam of the Muslimin to abstain from fighting the Sultan Faisal bin Turki in Maskat and Matrah and they are flattering him (Faisal) in the hope that he w ill obtain what he demands, but he will not obtain abstention from the Imam except he grant conditions and among them are— (1) The agreement in the matter of arms between the Sultan and the Christians must be broken. (2) That the Wadi of Sam ail, Nakhal and Sur should belong to the Imam exclusively. (3) The reduction of customs duties in all the ports to the rates that were in force in the time of the Imam Azzan (May God pity him !). ( 4 ) And that the Sultan and his sons should promote good and prohibit evil to the best of their ability. Now if the Sultan grants these conditions in full, we hope from the Imam that he will desist from fighting. And his brother Nasir bin Rashid wrote it with his own hand. Enclosure No. Z 8 .

After compliments.—We proceeded to do what you had commanded us to do (with Saiyid Hamad) and met a messenger who arrived before we did (in M adi Samail) stating that the Saiyid (His Highness) has delayed the despatch of forces to Wadi Samail, and had sent his son with only 200 men. We also met the enemy coming down from Samail to Bidbid, and found that those (Snabis and Jabiris) who had promised to help us had abstained, thinking that you had not more than this force of 200 men. They said we cannot assume hostilities as we are afraid that you (His Highness) have no more forces. So, we went to Jaylah and decided that we had best remain there seeing that the enemy was perplexed on hearing of the approach of the force (ot Saiyid Hamad) and their force was much reduced. O ! our master! we request you to expedite attack and not to allow any further delay. By the ime we leac 1 Jaylah the people of Samail had secured good positions. So, if you desire^ to possess Wadi Samail, then make haste to come to Bidbid with the remaining force. Send for us and we will meet you at Bidbid.

The first results of these machinations were thedarmist ^ reached Maskat in the third week of May 19 r&gt; \ as “imam of the Salimi had set up bis son-in-law, bm Ba^id &amp;l Muslimin It was alleged subsequently tha t i) rea ts of being Kharusi, had to be appointed to this honourable position with2 wt i,»,i;,l nn t accept the post. This Imam malgre lui had commenced shot if i full of^ pious quotations from the Koran, to the principal pending e . - &gt; jj... s | ( i e , in these letters he called upon them to rise in Shaikhs, of t to eI1 j oin on a ll Muslimin the sacred duty of assist- fnfthe cause even though it were only by their prayers. and Rustaq were reported threatened. His Highness endeavoured tnn late to send reinforcements of arms and provisions to Is izwah and hki, hut the communications were in the hands of the rebels and the reinforcements neve re' their destinations. Tor instance on the 3rd of June, news reaehed Maskat that His Highness’ slave, Ambar, who was proceeding to Rizwah with 21 hags rice, 3,000 rounds ammunition and 100 dollars in cash was looted and murdered by the rebels and two more ol his party were wounded. 5 But before the news of this outrage reached us, Maskat was aware, on the 29th’of May, that the Imam’s forces were attacking Nizwah and, owinff to the treachery of the inhabitants of the quarter called al Muddab, had established themselves in the town and were pressing hard the two forts and the mosque and the Beyt Salit. On the 5th of June, the news of the fall of Nizwah reached Maskat. The Wali of Nizwah, Saiyid Saif bin Hamad, a member of the family of the Al bu Sa’id, committed suicide, fearing to fall into the hands of the rebels. It is stated that the Wali, some months ago, represented to His Highness the precarious nature of his position, but that the « Kh a tibs ”&gt; or secretaries, who surround the Sultan insinuated that the Wali was striving to establish his own independence and His Highness took no notice of the appeal for assistance, made to him by his servant and relative. The Wall of Nizwah had held his post for about sixteen years. He came into his position by treacherously assassinating, somewhere about the year 1899, one Hillal bin Zahir, a local Shaikh of the Bani Hina, who then held Nizwah fort on his own account, setting at naught the authority of the Sultan. This Hillal had originally been established there by Saiyid Turki, father of the present Sultan; and he held the fort for some 12 to 14 years. Saif bin Hamad bin Saif bin Amir, the Wali who committed suicide, was a member of the ruling family, Al Bu Sa’id, an&lt;! his father before him had held Nizwah fort, until he was turned out by the local Shaikh, Hillal bin Hamad of the Bani Hina, already alluded to. Harid bin Hammad, the brother of the Wali, has been imprisoned by the Imam at Nizwah. Ball of Izki and Awaibi. 6. On the night of the 4th June His Highness, now thoroughly awake to the dangers that threatened him, took active steps to reassert his authority and seized some sympathisers of the Imam, who had come from Zanzibar, had bought arms from the French merchants at Maskat and were escaping to the Batineh coast. His Highness confiscate! both their money and their arms to the value, it is said, of one lakh of dollars. Saiyids Nadir and Hamad, second and fourth sons of His Highness, were despatched, respectively, to Samail and Nakhal, the one to assist izki, twenty miles from Nizwah, and the other Awaibi, an outpost of Bustaq. Both were seriously handicapped by the treachery and supineness of the Ghafiri tribes, supposed to be loyal to His Highness the Sultan. Not the least serious effort was made to relieve Awaibi, which was, after a short resistance, surrendered by His Highness’s Hadhrami akid : the news of its surrender reached Maskat 24th of June. 'With regard to Izki, the position was little better ; the family of al Kbalili, of the Bani Buwaha, Abdullah bin Sa’id al Khalili and his son Ali, endeavour ed to^ persuade Saiyid Nadir to proceed to Izki and to take with him from 1 ort feamail the gun presented by the French Government to the Sultan of Maskat. ^ Saiyid Nadir was ordered by his father to do nothing of the kind, and the W ali of Sur, Saiyid Hamud bin Hamad, was sent up with Ali bin abdullah al Khalili to assist his younger brother, Saiyid Sa’ud bin'Hamad, Mali i v . Hamud reached Izki without opposition, but Ali bin Abdulla al Khalili peisuaded him to withdraw again to Samail and, in the meantim p » let in the Imam s forces, when Saiyid Hamud could no longer return to the assistance of oaiyid Sa’ud who, finding himself outnumbered and deserted y his troops, surrendered the fort. Saiyid Sa’ud bin Hamad is now a prisoner m the hands of the Imam. The news of the fall of Izki reached Maskat on the 20th of June.List of principal rebels. - appears that the fall of Izki was the signal for Shaikh Isa bin , ^* al xiarathi, the most active and enterprising of the Hinawiyah Shaikhs, ' hose name is already familiar from previous Omani risings, openly to espouse tie cause of the Imam, whom he joined at Izki. Up till then, he had been .yj. on t j ie fence. Hitherto, the Imam’s chief supporter from the tribes had been Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir an Nabhani, of Tanuf village, the Tamimah of the Bani lliyam (vide Persian Gulf Gazetteer, page 1591) and the four principal rebels from now onwards may be reckoned to be— Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, the Imam. Abdullah bin Hammad as Salimi, his principal spiritual adviser. Isa bin Saleh al Harathi of the Hinawiyah. Hamyar bin Nasir an Nabhani of the Ghafiri. Position on the 26 th June. 8. Thus, on the 26th of June, the position was as follows Nizwah Izki and Awaibi were in the hands of the rebels. &gt; Saiyid Nadir waS in Samail; Saiyid Hamad in NakUal; and Saiyid Taimur thehen- annarent, with a panv of the Ja’alan men, the Bant bu Ah from Sur, 'as steamin'” up to Sib’with the intention of proceeding to Bidbid, Ll s mde^ .land from Sib and 15J miles from Samail fort His Highness was much elated at the arrival of the Bani bu All, in whom he put great conadence He was certain that with their arrival, the rising would fall to pieces and e Ghafiri Shaikhs return to their allegiance. The Ban, bu AUvvere under the command of Muhammad bin Nasir, a nephew of the late A“ lr : Abdullah bin Salim al Alawi, who died early in this yeai. On the SOth^of June Saivid Taimuv returned and reported that the Bai established themselves at Bidbid and_ Saiyid Hamad ^ gon e there too. Prospects of an early quelling of the rising were in sight, and it was hoped Saiyid i\adir would be relieved at no distant date. 9. On the 2nd of July, Major Murphy, .of the arrived fi*om Bushire to study the situation with a ' ie ripf pnce nf Maskat meats, should the necessity arise, of landing troops or placed the and Matrak. He was introduced to His Highness the Naib Wali of Matrah at Major Murphy s disposal and ev«ry as p was given to that officer Jby the local authorities. Retreat or Sultan’s forces and arrival of British troops. 10. On the 6th of July, the hopes of Py^^pl' 8 were rndely ^pelled (1) by the fact of the Shihuh forces, assembled at Mkhal i ountable Awaibi, falling back on Sohar, and (2) by the unexpec^ j j hamlet of retreat of the Bani bu Ali from Bidbid to the defence Matrah. His Highness had them brought in anxiety of the of the town md thereby greatly added to ^ e ? ^ for loot i no « and general inhabitants, as the Bani biyA li bear an evil rep a stay, no niisbehaviour.

H. On the 9th of July, His Highness addressed the Political Agent i n writing [vid .6 accompaninent to Maskat endorsement No. 106, dated 9th July 1913) and asked that the Rajputs, who were expected that evening by th Q fast mail, should be landed for the defence of Maskat and Matrah. On* their arrival that evening, they were duly landed at Matrah for the night. His Highness visited Colonel Smith, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the next morning in company with the Political Agent, and the Rajputs left the same day and occupied Beyt al Palaj, a hamlet south-west of Matrah ; a picquet was posted on Ruwi village. Communication of the Political Agent to rebel Chieftains. 12. On the 11th of July, the Political Agent wrote to the four rebel Chieftains, already named above in paragraph 7, reminding them of, and repeating to them, the warning of 1895 that the British Government, in view of the important interests of British subjects in the two towns of Maskat and Matrah, would not tolerate an attack by the Chiefs of Oman on these two places. The letters were delivered by a messenger, kindly supplied by His Highness, to Shaikh Isa bin Saleh al Harathi at Bidbid. The Shaikh took the letters and returned the messenger without an answer. A reply was, however eventually received, on the 21st of July, through the post from the Imam Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi. This reply was dated the 14th July and the method of its delivery proves what was indeed fully suspected before that the Imam has many friends and sympathisers in Maskat itself; it is polite, says that the Sultan has long been deposed by the ’Ulamah, but has refused to abdicate; it warns the Political Agent^to desist from troubling, or interfering in, the affairs of the Muslimin. It forms the enclosure to Maskat letter No. 118, dated 21st July 1913, to the address of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 13. The Political Agent, in obedience to directions from the Political Resident, on the 10th of July, took his French colleague into his confidence, informed him ofthe landing of British troops for the defence of Maskat and Matiah at His Highness s request. The intimation was well received and no hint was offered of any objection to our action. 14 On the 13th July, the suggestion was put, forward bv the Political lnfantrv n of fieK 6 - ^ ^if 01 ^ 31 Resident battalions of Nat ve shouh i dl, rfi « e u Sth 7 lthtW0 sections ' oi a Mountain Battery Win! des P atc , hed to .

The Sultan asked the Political Agent to return that evening to Maskat, as the signs of open sympathy and friendship that existed between His Highness and the British representative were misunderstood and objected t 0 by 'his troops and the Omanis up country and militated against the Sultan’s chances of quelling the rising himself. 16. On the 21st of July, the famous mine, of which much had been heard in vernacular letters to His Highness during the preceding weeks, was fired with partial success at the north corner of Samail fort, but Saiyid Nadir, who had been pluckily holding out all this time and inflicting some loss on the rebels, had made his arrangements to meet this disaster and his position was little affected. The rebels at once began another mine under the principal eastern tower, but this was a more difficult undertaking and eventually failed, falling in and killing some of the workmen. 17. On the 21st July, in the evening, alarming news in writing was received from the Sultan and brought by Saiyid Taimur to the effect that an attack on Sib was impending that very night. The ^ Political Agent and the Senior Naval Officer at once proceeded to consult Saiyid Taimur, who was on the steam yacht “Nur ul Bahr”, anchored in Matrah bay and it was decided that the Political Agent, with Major Murphy, should at once proceed in H. M. S. “ Alert ”, which had arrived that day to Sib to the Sultan’s support and that the “ Pelorus ” and “ Philomel ” should follow, if the news telegraphed from Sib suggested such a course. It was decided that, in the event of urgent necessity, a Naval contingent should be landed to assist the Sultan in repelling the attack of the rebels and to ensure His Highness’s personal safety. 18. H. M. S. “ Alert ” reached Sib at daybreak on the 22nd and found all quiet there. ' His Highness had completely recovered his equanimity, was full of schemes for reasserting his authority, had already despatched his son Hamad with Mozaffar’s force on its way to Bidbid and went so far as to assure the Political Agent that, in eight days’ time^aiyid Taimur would open the gates of Samail fort and relieve his brother Nadir. After the evening interview of the 22nd, Saiyid Taimur, in a short hurried talk with the Political Agent, was certain that His Highness was over confident; he had no hopes of his own troops, still less of the Ghafiri inhabitants of as Safalah portion of the Samail valley, on whom, in spite of frequent indications of treachery and disaffection, His Highness continued to rely. 19. A third interview took place on the morning of the 23rd No satisfactory news had been received of Saiyid Hamad s advance, and baiyi Taimur had not yet started. At all three interviews, ic 0 9., went, as far as he could venture, in urging His Highness to treat the British optimism and returned to Maskat in H. M. S. “ Alert the same day.

Shaikh Rashid further pave instances of the bad faith of the Bam bu All and Jennebek, who had sent the rice, given them for their progress inland, to their homes at Sur and had also left behind the ammunitions, with which the Sultan provided them, at Maskat for taking to their homes at the first convenient opportunity and then, on their arrival at Sib, were demanding ^ extra supplies of both food and ammunition. A touch of pathos appears in a remark which Shaikh Rashid allowed to escape him, when he said that the Sultan, on learning the downfall of all the hopes that he had formed, asked his advisers whether they thought that, if he himself went up country, the tribes would still continue in their treachery. It is notorious that he and Saiyid Taimur are personally very unpopular and that the only one of the sons who would have had the slightest chance of stemming the rising flood of rebellion would have been Saiyid Nadir, who, it appeared at the time, could not, humanly speaking, be relieved. Terms offered by the Imam. 22. The letters brought by Shaikh Rashid contained one enclosure, which appears sufficiently important to quote in full. It sets forth the terras on which the Imam undertakes to refrain from attacking Maskat and Matrah. “In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate ! “Let anyone who meets with this letter know that many people have constantly been asking the Imam of the Muslimin to abstain from fighting the Sultan, Raisal bin Turki, in Maskat and Matrah and they are flattering°him (Faisal) in the hope that he will obtain what he demands; but he will not obtain abstention from the Imam except he grant conditions and among them are— “ (1) The agreement in the matter of arms between the Sultan and the Christians must be broken. “ v2) That the Wadi of Samail, Nakhal and Sur should belong to the Imam exclusively. ° ( 3 ,' The eduction of customs duties in all the ports to the rates that were in force in the time of the Imam Azzan.

He informed him7 confidentially that, although it seemed clear from telegraphic news that the Government of India were carefully considering the possibility of bein&lt;* appealed to for further assistance, it was quite impossible for them to proffer assistance unasked and that it was by no means sure what decision they would arrive at. His Highness asked for Ine more days to await the arrival of the Chiefs from Abu Dhabi and expressed^ disappointment at their delay and failure to keep their promises, though it is not easy to see what assistance they can render him. 25. Thus on the 27th of July, the outlook for His Highness seemed blank indeed. One would have imagined that it would have been only a question of time for him to find himself at the end of all these false hopes. His procrasti nation had apparently extinguished all hopes of a relief of Samail as the time for a rapid dash on the fort had passed. Its fall within the next fortnight was to be anticipated. The result would be to confine the Sultan’s authority, even if only temporarily, to the enclave of Matrah and Maskat, when it would become a question whether Hritish interests would not demand our interven tion for the restoration of order, whether that should be accomplished by (1) arriving at some understanding with the rebellious tribes, assuming a protectorate over Maskat and Matrah and the environs, together with police rights up the Batineh littoral, leaving our relations with Sur and its hinter land much as at present, or (2) compelling the rebels to submit to their lawful sovereign. 26. But the situation is kaleidoscopic. On the 28th July, in quick succession to a despairing appeal to Saiyid Hamad from Saiyid Nadir, came reassuring news in a letter from Saiyid Hamad to His Highness; they pointed to the practical withdrawal from Samail fort of the rebels, the fears of Shaikh Hamyar for bis own life, the return to their allegiance of the Bani Jabir and as Siyabiyin and finally to the prospect of an early advance and speedy victory. At the same time, Shaikh Isa bin Saleh wrote to Saiyid Taimur offering to negotiate with him. It is true that, up to the date of writing, 31st July, no news has been received of a realisation of these hopes, but neither have they been contradicted, nor has Samail fallen and the miraculous restoration of the Sultan’s authority is within the bounds of possibility. The date trade is at a standstill and this must be a matter of as grave concern to the up country rebels as to the British exporters on the coast and it is probably on this chiefly that we must rely for a return to peaceful conditions. No doubt also the plans of the rebels have been upset by the prompt landing of the force of Native Infantry which has diminished their hopes of dictating terms to the Sultan in his own capital. 27. This report is intended to bring the history of the rising up to date and to try and reconcile the contradictory rumours that have marked its pro gress. To attempt at present any forecast of what our future attitude should e with regard to the Sultan and his relations with the tribes of Oman would appear premature. S. G.

I feel bound to explain that the letter in question was drafted by myself and written by my dragoman at the earnest request of His Highness the Sultan, but, according to his verbal instructions, taken down carefully by me. His Highness explained that, unless the letter was written in this way, it would be entirely impossible for him to keep the matter secret as he wished it should be kept. With the instructions of your telegram No. 1323, dated 27th July 1913, before me, in which you quote verbatim Foreign Secret telegram No. 262 S., I was extremely reluctant to undertake this task but, in view of His Highness's present difficult position and the many disillusions as to the fidelity of his followers that he has recently experienced, I saw no other course open to me. I made it quite clear to His Highness that the terras of the reply of Government were quite unknown to me, and His Highness assured me that he understood the position perfectly. Translation of a letter from Saiyid Faisal bin Turki, Sultan of Maskat, to the Political Agent, After compliments. —To-day my son Hamad and Wall Mozaffar arrived and with them some of the Shaikhs of the Bani Jabir returning from the Wadi Jayla and, as for the Shaikhs, your honour has seen them and has realised that there is no reliance to be placed on them; And likewise your honour is aware that my son Nadir is besieged in the fort of Samail with a few members of my family and of my dependents and that they are all in great danger from the rebels; And then, if Samail and Bidbid fall—for this calamity is considered likely to happen—there remains no protection for the trade of your subjects, nay more, Maskat and Matrab will be in danger and never at rest; And all this sedition, as is plain from the notice which you have seen purporting to be from the pretended Imam, Salim bin Bashid al Kharusi, is owing to the establishment of the warehouse and to the rules which we have made on the advice of the glorious Imperial Government. Now rateres e persons have falsely represented this arrangement as a device on the pai ^ o you and me to forbid to the tribes of Oman modern weapons and ammumHon, so that we may press upon them, seeking to reduce them to slavery. ow, in these circumstances, I hope from my old and sincere friends, the British Gov ernment, help in this time of need and I ask from you the despatch of troops, ‘ according as the glorious Government shall see fit, for raising the siege p e for t of Samail or its recapture, should necessity call for it, so that the rising ^ay be quelled and peace be restored to my port and my conn ry an « i \ 1913, with enclosure, which I have addressed to the Political 2nd August Ay■*.£ . ^ lf Resident in the Persian Guit.

You should prove as God has said—“Those who, if we empowered them on earth, would observe prayers, give alms, promote good and prohibit evil. ,, God controls result of everything. Verily God does not spoil the reward of the good. Your goodness has not been in vain and God has granted you such happiness as you could not think of. So, congratulations to you on your victory.

The present rates are 7 # and he proposes to raise them to 28;4 which is the utmost that in his opinion the trade can bear . When Sheikh Harayar begins to howl , it is proposed to make him give assurances to hold izki and Fizwa against the Hinawiya and, on his proper su hales ion, to reduce the rates to tno old duty . His nig;mean says that he does not want the money but to reduce the Sheikh to submission . Unfortunately, it is rather a cane of Turkey and the power# .

Extract from Maskat News No. 29—720, for the week ending the 19th July 1913, Condition of country, 301. On the 14th, news reached Maskat that the enemy had strengthened their position at Bidbid. 302. The “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” left for Sohar to bring fighting men on the 14th and returned on the 16th with 250 men and the Wali of Sohar, Muzaffar. 303. On the 15th, about 100 more men of the Bani Bu Ali arrived from Sur and joined their comrades in Maskat. 304. On the 14th, there was a fight among the Bedouins of the Bani Bu Ali outside the gate. Stones and sticks were freely used with the result that there were several heads broken. The quarrel arose over some pilfering in the bazaar by the Bedouins whom their Shaikh wished to punish. Even the Shaikh himself was stoned. The offenders were at last secured and confined in the fort. 305. The “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” left for Sib on the 17th with Saiyid Earned on board. 306. His Highness the Sultan has been getting letters from Ghaferi Shaikhs urging him to make an advance against the enemy and assuring him of their help but imploring him not to delay. The M ali of boha.r— -vide entry 302, supra, is stationed at Watbaiya with his 250 men from various tribes. Saiyid Nadir’s position was said to be very precarious on the 17th. 207.

Saiyid Nadir, it is said, returned a reply saying he was prepared for the worst and that they could do what they pleased. A truce was, however, arranged by which hostilities were suspended for the time being. Saiyid Nadir, in a letter which he addressed to his father, asked for supply of stores, ammunition, spare springs for rifles, &amp;c., as his weapons were worn out. He advised his father to have no reliance in Bani Jabir as they had proved disloyal and faith less. 318.

I consider that ray time for action will arrive when British subjects complain and then that all that I need do is to satisfy myself that they are not being unduly hardly dealt with , But the Uirden of proving that their goods are innocent and that they are entitled to a refund of excess duty levied will rest on them . His Highness assures me that he is not out for money grubbing but merely v/fcshes to reassert his authority over his rebellious tribesmen and I conceive that, in giving hlra all reasonable assistance to that end , I am merely carrying out the policy of Government . as special tribes and villages show their submission in some r ally substantial fashion His Highness will at once reduce the duty to the old level.

This wou'd result in blockade being transferred from Persia to Batina Coast &amp; line of blockade would be shortened acc ordingly . Naval authorities have long desired this change and I strongly urge that they may be requested to take the necessary steps immediately . French vessels will not be searched but they are not likely now to engage in traffic .

Masqat position is therefore that no attacK need be anticipated as long as British troops defend the towns of Muttra and Masqat. In the meantime , however, hold of % rebels on tribal territory in Interior Is being strengthened ; Sultan's private lands are confiscated &amp; sold &amp; from numerous owners of d v te gardens who are unable to resist rebels they are collecting 'zlkat'. as soon therefore as our troops withdraw,we may expect renewed attempts on Masqat &amp; Muttra from rebels who will lie in a better position . To fight tliem an&lt;ff bring them bach to their senses , only two weapons remain to His Highness; (1) Supplies such as rice etc: should not be allowed to go in land, (2) On dates entering Muttra &amp; Masqat for export from rebel valleys heavy punitive duty should be levied. Troops are excellently placed to prevent all arrivals and dep- :tures by land as Regards Masqat &amp; Muttra. 3 regards sea, H.H. could by extension of 1898 proclamation 5dare Naval blockade of Bateneh coast, so &lt;^&gt; to cov a f tuffs of every Kind .

Dear Sir Percy, I have i^een trying ever since ten oc&amp;ock this morning to write to you hut it is half past twelve before I have heon ahle to get away . I saw His Highness this morning / as I thought he might he disturbed about the Reuters announce ment which readied us yesterday afternoon . I found that he had not even noticed it , if his own account is to be believed . I found that the translation which I gave him did not disturb him very much and he made no wry faces , when I translated faithfully that the 'Timas* said that if he could not suppress the imam , he would degenerate from Sultan to SheiKh of Masqat . I went on to asX about the town rumours , which my diary gives fehis week about NaKhl . He told me as follo-ws : The Sheikh of Kakhl is Hammad bln Thanalyan al Harxasi . The Fort of Nakhl v at the ill of the people of Nakhl,was in charge of Than! bin Harith al Jabari . When Nadir came out Ox semail, it was decided by the Sultan f s sons , who were then at Sib and greatly incensed against the Bani Jabir , that the Fort 01 hakhl should be handed over to Sheikh Hammad bin Thanaiyan . This has roused the hostility of the Ghafari tribes , and especially of the Bani Jabir , who are anxious that all the Ghafari should oe ih the same boat and not that Hammad bin Thanalyan s.ioald the honour and glory, if matters turned out well for the Sultan. I enclose a letter i^rom Sheikh Kaiamad bin Tnanalyan wi^L enclosure , a usual fire breathing letter f*om Hamyax bin rasir, Tamlmah of the Bani Riyam .

It was my belief , if we could have gone to Saraail, promptly in the first instance, we should in any case have saved the situation as regards the security of trade and Masqat &amp; should very likely have extinguished the rising.

After compliments .—It is stated to your honour that you may be acquaint ed with, and informed of, the fact that the entire Arab community of Oman, from Katar to Maskat, has agreed upon setting aside its former Sultan, Paisal- bin-Turki, and has installed a new Sultan for itself, and has secured from him bonds and pledges for the welfare of the country, peace for the people, and compliance with the Bright Code as enforced by the Unitarian Islamic teach ings. And as regards yourself, it is requested of your Government to desist from interfering in this important affair and to stick to the zone of separation in accordance with the known Law in relation to independent States and their autocratic Sultans, as France has done with us. And you will have loyalty on our part in the requirements of friendship and bonds of amity. And we think it impossible that the Great British Government should interpose between us and the reform of our country and be the sole cause leading to ruin and destruc tion and of creating ill-will against herself, for she is a wise Government and the only one which has always been trying to uphold the rights of mankind. And your Government should not suppose that the people of Oman are stupid and ignorant Bedouins knowing no law and understanding nothing. They are, on the other hand, an intelligent people who have gained experience of the world in every side, have tasted its sweets and bitters, known the causes of progress and civilization and understood the policies of powers as well as their tactics. And your Government should not think that this our rising is one for looting, extortion and murder, God fordid that it should be so ! On the /other hand, it is a rising the object of which is peace for the country and happi- ! 11688 f° r th 0 people. It is, therefore, requested and hoped of your Govern- ; .inent that her troops will be moved from Bait-al-Falaj and entirely removed early. If these were brought for the protection of your subjects, then we undertake the responsibility of protecting their lives and property. God willing ! And we do not think that your Government, which is well-known for her diplomacy and considerate treatment, will prefer one individual to two millions of A.rabs and will dash their freindship and love which is greater for her than for any other Government against the wall as useless. The Arab community thinks her above that and that she is far too noble to suffer such a thing from which your Government will reap nothing but loss of lives and the flowing of gutters of blood on the surface of the earth. And a reply is requested from you immediately. This is from the representative of all, Abdullah-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi. Written by his son Muhammad with his hand. Certified that this is from the Imam of the Muslims, Salim-bin- Bashid Al-Kharusi, with his own hand. Seal of the Imam. {Sub-Enclosure No. 3.)

After compliments .—I have received your two friendly letters on the subject of the peoples of Oman and they will in due course be submitted tomy Government and will no doubt receive their wise consideration. By this time, however, you have no doubt heard of the death of our friend, Saiyid Paisal-bin-Turki, who has now; appeared before a Higher Judge than your selves and us and all it would ill he seem any of us to presume to pronounce an opinion on the merits or demerits of his past life. You say with truth that the Great British Government loves justice and peace, and you may be sure that the great desire of that Government is that there should be concord and a good understanding between the Bulers and the subiects of Oman. It has been a source of gratification to me to note from friendly com munications which our friend Saiyid Taimur has shown me that the pillar of the Abadhi religion, Shaikh Abdulla-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi, has not ceased to offer him counsels of wisdom and humanity, and this encourages me in the hope that the clouds which have unfortunately arisen between the people and the ruler in the latter days of Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki may be dispelled and the tribes may at no distant date reach a good understanding with his successor. {j$ub-Enclosure No. 4.)

And you are aware that the community has deposed him a long time before his death and rose against him on various occasions the last being this present rising which we hope will be auspicious, and we pray to God that He may complete his blessing on us and consummate His li^ht for us. And we have previously sent you letters, dated the 30tti Shawwal, as we had not seen the new moon which we realized afterwards thus the date should be 1st Al-Qa’ada. The subject matter of those letters being that we have not arisen but to protest against the innovation brought about by the despotic Sultan in t le shading of blood and setting the tribes one against the other, the disregard of privileges and omission of prescribed penalties and the weakening of the Shara’ commands, and thereby disturbances arose among the people.

It is reported that a detachment of the rebels headed by Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir is attacking Nakhl, which, it is also rumoured, has been taken by the rebels. 394. Saiyids Taimur and Dhiyab are going to Barkah in the “Nur-ul-Bahrwith a party of the Bani Umar who arrived from Sohar. The idea is to reinforce the garrison at Barkah and perhaps make an advance on Nakhl. 395. With reference to Diary entry No. 387, Shaikh Rashid bin Uzaiyis returned from Halban, with the news that most of the Jabiri, Siyabi and Nadabi Shaikhs are now favourable to His Highness the Sultan as they fear an advance, into the interior, of the British troops in Bait-al-Falaj. 396. With reference to Diary entry No. 384, the Wali of Quryat has since reported to His Highness the Sultan that the Bani Battash have dispersed and gone back to their homes. 404.

Letters received during the week by His Highness the Sultan from the interior indicate that the rebellion is weakening. Shaikh Hamyar-bin- Nasir is said to be lukewarm, finding that supporting a rebel army is expen sive. There is also a general feeling among the people that they are more heavily taxed under the new regime and the rebel leaders cannot agree. 425 The Wali of Sur reports that the rebels are planning an advance on that port under Shaikh Isa-bimSalih Al-Harithi. The Wali of Sur seems alarmed and is strengthening the fort of Sur and the neighbouring towers and asking for fresh supplies of ammunition from Maskat. 426 It is further reported by the Wali of Sur that the Shaikhs of Sharqiyah are now inclining towards the Imam for whom they are trying to raise funds by disposing of Waqf properties at Bidiyah and elsewhere. It seems probable, however, that these reports are due to a desire to obtain more ammunition from the Sultan. &gt; 427. The Jannabah Shaikhs of Sur have written to His Highness assuring him of their loyal support and defence of Sur in case the rebels attac that port. * ***** 433.

Condition of country .— 408 With reference to the diary entry 394, Saiyids Taimur and Dhiyab returned in the “Nur-ul-Bahr” after sending Shaikh Rashid-bin-tTziyiz, with 40 men to Nakhl as a reinforcement. 409. The Bani Harras who constitute the garrison in the fort of Nakhl are said to have objected to this addition on the ground that it would provoke an attack by the rebels who had not till then made an appearance at Nakhl. 410. Jamadar Abdullah-bin-Isa, lately in charge of the fort of Samail, has been stationed in the fort of Barkah with 30 men. 411 It is reported that Shaikh Hamdan-bin-Sulaiman, uncle of Shaikh Hamvar-hin-Nasir-bin-Sulaiman, visited Wadi Samail where people welcomed him out of fear rather than affection or regard. 412. A band of 20, and according to another report 50, men of the Sivabi tribe raided Al-Mogabra near Watiyah and drove off 4 camels hJonoine to His Highness the Sultan. The keepers and others of His Highnes?s men oflered^no resistance and made a belated report to the troops at Bait-aKFalaj. .

The Imam and Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi have written to Saiyid Tairaur exhorting him to abide by and enforce the Shara orders and to administer justice in the country. These would appear to point to a weakening of the spirit of rebellion and a desire for reconciliation. 439. The Political Agent also received communications from the above persons asking that they may be let alone by Government to settle their dis putes with their ruler and that the troops may be recalled, as they, the leaders, undertake the responsibility of protecting British and other foreign subjects and their properties. 440. News has been received from Sohar that one of the Maghrabi Askaris forming the garrison there, whose pay was partly withheld, shot the Akid killing him immediately. A relation of the Akid who was there shot the murderer dead at the same time. ( 441. It is reported from Barkah that two State camels in charge of the Wali of Barkah have been stolen by some of the tribesmen of the neighbour hood. ******* 44,3.

A message of condolence from His Excellency the Viceroy to the family of the late Sultan was conveyed by the Political Resident to Saiyid Taimur and his brothers. A verbal message was sent later to Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Turki informing him that he had been included in the above message of condolence and that the Resident regretted that neither Saiyid Muhammad himself nor any of his children was present to hear it. The Resident was assured by those of the family present that they were ready to acknowledge Saiyid Taimur as their Sultan and head and that they were ready to give him full and loyal support. 452. On the 8th October 1913, Saiyid Taimur held a durbar which was attended by the local notables at which he announced his accession. No Foreign Government was there represented. The accession seems to be accepted by all present at Maskat without opposition of any kind except from His late Highness’s brother, but it seems not unlikely that he too will shortly submit to the inevitable. It is rumoured that the principal objection now remaining is the increase of the allowances he received from his late brother from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per month. Saiyid Taimur appears to think that $ 1,500 should suffice, but will probably accept his uncle’s figure in return for full support. 453. Saiyid Taimur appears to have grasped the reins of Government firmly and to be inclined to work through his brothers, Saiyid Nadir and Muhammad and his cousin Dhiyab-bin-Pahad-bin-Turki. Great reforms are promised, especially in the Customs; public smoking and drinking are to be prohibited and prostitutes are to leave the town, the local authorities at Matrah have received warnings against the taking of bribes and justice has been promised to high and low. Most of these reforms are in deference to the presumed wishes of the Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi, one of the moving spirits of the rebellion.? 11 No. 3230, dated Bushire, the 26th October (received 3 rd November) 1913.

On his accession, Saiyid Taimur-bin-Faisal wrote letters to all the Shaikhs and tribal headmen of Oman informing them of his assumption of the Sultanate of Maskat and Oman and giving assurances of a just and equit able rule and of his desire to reform the administration of the country at large. 456. He is receiving communications, in reply, generally containing expressions of sympathy and assurances of loyalty from mest of the Chiefs, notably Shaikh Isa-bin-Salih Al-Harithi, Hamad-bin-Hilal-bin-Hamad of the Ya’l-Saa’d, Saif-bin-Hilal, Hamad-bin-Ali, Muhammad-bin-Saif and Abdullah- bin-Said-bin-Khalfan of Wadi Samail; Hamad-bin-Said-bin-Hammad of the Bani Rawaha, Hamad-bin-Aamir Al-Hinai of Khoz; Said-bin-Abdullah, Muhammad-bin-Mubarak Al-Janebi and others of Sur and many others of less note. 457. Saiyid Taimur also received letters from Shaikh Mohsin-bin-Zahran As-Siyabi and Shaikh Saud-bin-Ali to the effect that the rebels are preparing to advance on Maskat, but that Shaikh Isa bin Salih Al-Harithi is well disposed. ^ towards Saiyid Taimur, whom the writers advise on that account to make terms with the Imam through the Harithi Shaikh. On the other hand, it is reported that the three chief rebel-leaders, the Imam As-Salimi and Hamyar are now openly at variance among themselves and cannot at all agree as to what they should do.Vwx/W o«ff 20.N0V.1913 No. 3293, dated Bush ire, the 2 nd (received 10 th) November 1913 (Confidential).

On the 22nd October, one Hamaid bin Sa’id Al-Falaiti of the people of Socotra paid a visit to the Political Agent. He is an annual visitor to Maskat, appears to be a man of some importance in his own country and is well-known to the Aden authorities. He invariably, during the tenure of office by the present Political Agent, has visited him 1 twice a year, once in the early spring on arrival at Maskat and once in the autumn at his departure. He apparently owns property in the interior and informed the Political Agent that he had been staying this year at the village of Wasil in the Wadi Ma’awal. He said that sedition had not reached that village and that, although the emissaries of the Imam had arrived there, the Shaikhs of his part of the country would not respond. 468. It then transpired that the main object of Hamaid’s visit was that after the coming Id he wanted to hire a boat from the Batinah Coast in which to return with his attendants and some merchandise, apparently dates, to his own country, and as he was assured in his own mind that the rebels would certainly attack Maskat and Matrah either just before or after the Id, he wanted to be furnished with a kind of pass or safe conduct to ensure him against interference from the British troops or man-of-war that might take measures against such rebel attack. The Political Agent said that, if Hamaid was quite certain that there would he an attack, it seemed probable that measures might be taken to prevent passage of goods and traffic by sea and land between the rebel country and the outside world, and the Political Agent would, in that case, be unable to grant a safe conduct that would do more than pass individuals. 469. Hamaid seemed to be sympathetic with the rebels and to imply that he could not understand how the ’English could possibly interfere with the Omanis in their free choice of their own Sultan. The Political Agent assured him that, if the rebels attacked or attempted to attack Maskat or Matrah, the British troops would assuredly resist tnem. Hamaid then said that he was certain from the temper of the country that, in that case, th(*ie would be bloodshed, and said that various tribesmen and Maskatis were persuadin' Saiyid Taimur falsely that there was peace when there was no peace, huf that the only people on whom the Saiyid could rely were the English. 470. As these views of a man who is, it is believed, a comparatively disinterested foreigner seem interesting, they were communicated by the Political Agent to Saiyid Taimur. The latter, however, told the Political Agent that he did not anticipate an attack. 471 Ali bin Abdullah Al-Khalili of the upper portion of the Samail valley is*on his way to visit Saiyid Taimur. With him are coming certain Shaikhs of the Bani Buwaha. 472 The Sultan’s yacht “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” went down to Sur on the lOth and returned on the 22nd. *Qihtan bin Ya’arab of the Al-bu-Sa’id went with her on Saiyid Taimur’s behalf in response to an urgent appeal for cartridges and2 assistance from the Wali of Sur. He found that Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir of the Bani Riyam had written to the Janebah Shaikhs telling tliem to send two of their number to him to arrange for his visit to tbe sons of the late Amir of Ja’alan. The Janebah Shaikhs, however, replied that they were obedient to Shaikh Taimur, and that if he tried to come with force, he would be opposed with force. 473. The “ Nur-ul-Bahr ^ found one Hamaid bin Salim bin A’amir, an influential headman of the Bani Bu-Hasan at Sur, and he asked for a passage ; to Maskat, as he wished to see Saiyid Taimur. He was allowed to come, but Saiyid Taimur now intends to dismiss him to his home, as other important Shaikhs of the Bani Bu-Hasan are on their way, and the Saiyid does not desire* too many Bedouins to assemble in Maskat. L ******* A' 480. The ** Al-Amran ” of Cairo in its issue of 4th October 1913 write 8 on the present situation of Oman, praising His late Highness Sir Saiyid Faisal bin Turki for his sincere desire for the welfare of his subjects and the cordial relations of the Sultanate with the British Government whieh ensure peace and prosperity to toe country. The writer concludes by hoping that the * present rebellion, which is based on the poisonous teachings of ignorant ALullaSjjwili soon be at an end, and that every Arab who has any voice in ' Oman will rise up to suppress this evil before retribution follows.it . - (Received on the 27th October 1913 with Political Secretary's letter No. 41, dated the lOfc'b October 1913.)

The Janebah Shaikhs of Sur have written to Saiyid Taimur to say that Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir Ai-Iliyam! visited the Bani Bu-Ali of Ja’alan and sent messengers to the Janebah to persuade them to join the rebel cause, but that they finally replied that their loyalty to Saiyid Taimur was unchanged. 497. Saiyid Taimur also forwarded to the Political Agent a letter dated 5th instant from the Chief of Ja’alan, Ali bin Abdulla bin Salim Al-Hamudah. It is to the effect that Itamyar visited them and declared his firm resolve to attack Maskat and desired that Bani Bu-Ali should remain neutral, but that they told him that they could try and get some concessions for him from the Saiyid, but on no account excuse themselves from helping the Saiyid, with their lives and property, if need be. 498. A simultaneous communication from the Wali of Sur informed Saiyid Taimur of the failure of Hamyar to get the Bani Bu-Ali and the Janebah to join the rebels and assures him of their steadfast loyalty to Saiyid Taimur, who, the Wali suggests, should visit Sur, though for one day only, to discuss the situation there and to reassure the Janebah and the Bani Bu-Ali. 499. Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid bin Khalifa of Abu Dhabi arrived with a following of 40 men by S. S. Banktira on the 3rd instant. He and Shaikhs Hilal bin Sa’id al-Hajri and Salim bin A’amir Al-Hasani have written jointly to Shaikh Isa bin Saleh Al-Harithi asking him to refrain from further trouble and to use his influence with As-Salimi with a view to the cessation of hostilities and arriving at a good understanding with Saiyid Taimur. It is said that these Hinawi Shaikhs have added a warning that if matters are not straightened soon all the Hinawi tribes will march out to fight against the Imam and his Ghafiri partisans. 500. Shaikh Ali bin Muhammad bin Salim Al-Qaravi of Murbat arrived on a visit to Saiyid Taimur and also paid a visit to the Political Agent.

                           Muscat News, and a considerable number of translated letters of notable local Omani shaikhs and members of al-Bu Sa‘id ruling family. The correspondence is mainly concerned with the rising of the Imam of Oman, Salim bin Rashid al-Kharusi against the Sultan of Oman, Fayṣal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idi in 1913, with the cause being the supposed leaning of the Sultan to foreign governments. The Political Agent, Muscat, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, as well as the Sultan of Oman, all raised concerns regarding the threat of attacks on Muscat and Mutrah by the 'rebels'. The Political Resident requested that the Sultan of Muscat issue a notification to the Omani shaikhs not to attack these towns. The Sultan then issued a warning similar to the one which was issued during the rising of the previous Imam in 1895.Among other issues discussed in the volume are:the present situation in various regions including Sama’il, Nizwa, and othersthe possible attacks by Shaikh ‘Isa bin Salih al-Harthi and his followers on British subjects in the areas under the Sultan’s controla report (ff 70-73) on the history of the rising of the Imam of Tanuf brought up to 31 July 1913the fall of Nizwa, Izki, Bidbid and Sama’il into the hands of the Imam of Omanthe British assistance to the Sultan by sending troops of 250 men to protect Muscat and Matrahnews of the Imam of Oman collecting zakat (alms) money and pulling tobacco plants from various regions in Omannews that the Imam had been discredited and his followers were quarrelling among themselvesthe death of the Sultan of Oman on 4 October 1913, and the succession of his son Taimur bin Fayṣal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idiAmong other correspondents in the volume are the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, the Imam of Oman, Salim bin Rashid al-Kharusi and the Sultan of Oman, Faisal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idi.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Ghāfirī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Hināwī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sama’il</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Izki</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nizwa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ibadism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Zakat</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Āl Bū Sa'īd dynasty, Imam of Muscat and Oman</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh 'Īsá bin Ṣāliḥ al-Ḥārithī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Maṭraḥ</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rebellions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000282#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
