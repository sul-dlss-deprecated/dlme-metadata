LONDON: PRINTED BY COX &amp; WYMAN, 74-5, GREAT QUEEN STREET, LINCOLN’S-INN FIELDS. 1856.PREFACE. The publication of the following Narrative has hitherto been delayed in consequence of charges preferred by Major-General Beatson against Major-General Shirley, arising out of events to which it relates; and of the anticipated Court of Inquiry subsequently ordered for their investi gation by II.R.II. the General Commanding-in- Chief, pending the result of which its publication would have been obviously improper. It. J. H. Vivian, Major-General.NARRATIVE, fyc. Though reluctant to make an official correspondence the subject of an appeal to public opinion, yet having found myself exposed to continued and most uncalled for attacks on the part of Major-General Beatson and his friends, I have thought it due to my own character to obtain the sanction of authority for the publication of certain documents in my possession; to explain which I have added a plain narrative of all the circumstances which eventually brought me into collision with General Beatson. I have thought this explanation the more necessary to prevent further misconception, as I observe that there is an intention to bring this question again before Parliament. It has been broadly charged against me that I had “fathered” false and malicious charges—anonymously brought to my knowledge — against Major-General Beatson; that I had ordered a secret inquiry into these allegations; and that—coveting an increase to my own force—I had generally acted unfairly towards General Beatson, with a view to deprive him of his independent command. I feel sure it will be apparent to any unpre judiced person who will take the trouble to peruse the subjoined Narrative, and its documentary proof, that theincorporation of the Irregular Cavalry with the Turkish Contingent w'as not only unsought for by me, but that the measure was contrary to my wishes; that I took no part whatever in the transactions which led to General Beatson’s being deprived by the War Minister of his independent command; that when placed under my au thority, I exercised towards General Beatson as much forbearance as was consistent with my duty to Govern ment ; and that when grave charges affecting his character as an Officer—as well as that of others attached to the Irregular Cavalry — had been duly, not anonymously, brought to my notice, I expressly placed it out of my power, so far as he was concerned, to exercise any in fluence, by directing that the result of the inquiry should be transmitted direct to Lord Panmure. My own views with reference to the Bashi Bazouks being placed under my command are stated in a letter to Lord Panmure, under date the 27th of September, 1855, a copy of which is appended {Appendix No. 1), and from which I will here introduce the following extract :—“ I regret “ most bitterly that now, at the eleventh hour, I am called “ to take those troops with me to Kertch. lour lordship “ must not suppose that in communicating my sentiments “I am making difficulties; I am simply representing u them, and Avill do my utmost to overcome them ; but u my firm conviction is, that unless in small bodies, when “ they may be easily coerced, they will be found rather to “ hamper an army than to afford it any assistance ; and I “ regret that circumstances should have rendered it neces- “ sary for her Majesty’s Government to attach them to “ my Contingent.” On the 25th August, 1855, it was notified to Major- General Bcatson that his force had been attached to the Turkish Contingent. The following is a transcript of thedespatch forwarded from the War Department on that day IVar Department, 25th August, 1855. Sir,—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of the 5th instant, and in reply to acquaint you that 1 have seen with much vexation and regret the disturbances which have occurred in the force under your command. It appears to me that Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, act ing on such information as he could procure at a distance from the scene of action, and under unusual and difficult circumstances, showed becoming zeal in sending regular forces and contingent instructions to you, with officers to aid you with their counsel and assistance, and a conditional recommendation to repair to the capital to confer per sonally wdth his lordship and the Seraskier. Although willing to make considerable allowances for imperfect discipline in a corps such as you are endea vouring to bring into subjection, it is impossible for me not to condemn in the strongest terms, the acts of violence and contempt of all control which have been exhibited by some portion of the men under vour very eyes. I am willing to admit, in part, the excuse that you have not been provided with a sufficiency of officers; but this has arisen from your own irregular proceedings in not sending proper returns of your force, by which I could be guided in my views as to the number of officers which should be attached to you. \our own fitness to command must consist much more in } om power over your men in the field, and capacity to lead them against an enemy, than in the judgment which your correspondence with her Majesty’s ambassador at4 Constantinople exhibits, or the temperance of the general orders to yonr force. In the conviction that these defects spring rather from momentary irritation, than from any determination to set authority at defiance, and considering the zeal which you have displayed in getting this force together, I have re solved not to accept the resignation of your command tendered by you to Lord Stratford de Itedcliffe, a course which at first appeared to her Majesty's Government as best calculated to give a chance of securing efficiency to the force. In ordei' to avoid any conflict between civil and military authority in future, I have resolved to place you and your corps under the superior Military Command of General Vivian, and shall therefore attach you to the Turkish Contingent. You will immediately and in future report yourself to that Officer, and send through him your military com munications.* You will also hold your force in immediate readiness to move so soon as you may receive orders to that effect from General Vivian. I have, &amp;c. [Signed) Panmure. Major-General Beatson. Major-General Beatson, then at the Dardanelles, must have been in possession of this dispatch on the 4th or 5 th September, 1855. Lord Panmure's dispatch of the same date addressed to myself, on the same subject, reached me at Buyukdere on the 5th September. On the follow * The italics are mine.ing day a copy of it was forwarded to Major-General Beatson by my Deputy Adjutant-General, and that Officer, by my desire, at the same time directed the Major- General to furnish certain returns of his force. Major-General Beatson neither placed himself in communication with me, nor did he forward his mili tary communications through me, as directed in Lord Panmure's dispatch; nor did he acknowledge the letter I had ordered to be addressed to him on the 6th Septem ber. An inference may hence be drawn of the spirit with which he received the orders of the War Minister. On the 10th September I directed my Military Secre- tary, with reference to the Deputy Adjutant-General’s letter of the 6th instant, to address Major-General Beatson, and to call on him as early as practicable for full information on points connected with his force. {Appendix, No. 2 A.) This letter was equally disregarded, though the infor mation called for was important to enable me to carry out the duties of my new command. On the Irregular Horse being attached to my force, I solicited from the Ambassador information as to the occurrences which had taken place at the Dardanelles [Appendix, No. 2 B); and in my Military Secretary’s letter of the 10th September, above adverted to, I directed Major-General Beatson to send me a summary of the leading facts which occurred at that place, with his opinion as to the measures necessary under the existing state of affairs. From the Major-General, as already observed, I obtained no acknowledgment. From the Lmbassy I received a precis of occurrences that had taken place from the 6th July to the 8th September, from which it appears, that on the 6th July a gross outrage took place. A prisoner was released byG mutinous Albanians belonging to the Irregulars. The mutineers proceeded to Major-General llcatson s quaitcrs, and demanded the arms of the released prisoner, which, after a parley had ensued, were delivered to them by the Major-General. The offenders then rode away and de serted. Serious outrages on the inhabitants were described by the Consuls, who reported that if regular troops were not sent, the country would be in the greatest peril. There was a lack of sufficient information from Major-General Bcatson, whose accounts always differed from those of other functionaries, on the culpability of his men. When the latter declared the country to be in peril, and adduced distinct instances in proof of their assertions, he had taken a different riew, declaicd c\eiy report to be an exaggeration, and attributed motives to those who did not agree with him in opinion. The Ambassador was of opinion that no sufficient measures were being taken for the protection of the country. Reports of the gravest consequence reached his Excel lency from the Turkish, Erench, and British functionaries at this time, and his Excellency felt called upon to interfere to prevent a recurrence of events so injurious to British interests, and to the cause in which, in conjunc tion with our Allies, we were then engaged. Such a state of affairs, with which I had obviously no concern whatever, may readily account for the dispatch from the War Department removing Major-General Beatson from independent command. It further appeared that on the 28th August a letter had been addressed to Mr. Consul Calvert by the I rench Consul, in which there is the following sentence : “ I “ cannot recognize in any manner an authority in “ Major-General Beatson, which he has most illegally7 “ arrogated to himself; namely, to exercise any police “ in the country, beyond the precincts of his own camp, “ on persons who are, or ought to be, strangers to “ him.” On the 9th September, Major-General Beatson ad dressed a letter to the War Minister stating that, if his lordship’s decision were not reversed, he had no course left but to tender his resignation. This letter, in direct contravention of the War Minister’s instructions,—“You “ will immediately and in future report yourself to that “ officer, and send through him your military communi- “ cations,”—w as addressed direct to his lordship; a copy being at the same time sent to me, together with a letter from the Major-General, in which he intimated his intention of publishing the whole of his correspondence with the War Department, should Lord Panmure not see fit to rescind the order placing him under superior military authority. At this time letters were transferred to me from the Embassy, addressed by Major-General Beatson direct to the Ambassador, commenting in very unbecoming terms on the Consul at the Dardanelles. In an official letter to Major-General Beatson on the 13th September, I recommended him to withdraw that portion of his official communication to myself, threatening publication of his correspondence ; and in a private letter, of the same date, I, in a friendly spirit, urged upon him this step, as well as the propriety of his being more circumspect in his official correspondence, that I might be spared the necessity of animadverting on his expres sions. My private letter was replied to by Major-General Bcatson in the same form; and he expressed his inten tion of withdrawing his letter. But my official despatch.8 like others, remained unacknowledged; and his official letter, of which he had forwarded a copy to the Ambas sador, was not withdrawn until after his recall from the Dardanelles. To this subject I shall hereafter return. On the morning of the 27th September I received an urgent despatch from the Embassy, of which the following is a copy :— • Sept. 26, 1855. Immediate. Embassy, Therapia. Sir, — I have the honour, by desire of the Ambassador, to inclose a very important communication from the Dardanelles, signed by the two civil functionaries of highest rank in that place, Mr. Consul Calvert and Mr. Consul Skene. His Excellency is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken to vest the supreme authority at the Dardanelles, as regards British command, in some officer who may be disposed to co-operate with the Pasha and Consuls for the maintenance of the peace. His Excellency requests that you will be pleased to take this matter into immediate consideration, and take such measures as may appear to you advisable. I have, &amp;c., {Signed) W. W. Mansfield, B. General. P.S. The steamer alluded to in the despatch of Mr. Skene is waiting your orders. It is requested by his Excellency that the inclosures may be returned. P.S. I believe the steamer is at Pera; but a reference to the Admiral may be necessary on your part.9 Inclosure in above letter, from Messrs. Calvert and Skene, the Consuls ; dated— Dardanelles, 25th Sept. 1855. My Lord,— A serious affray having taken place yester day between some troopers of the Irregular Cavalry and a Turkish guard in this town, in which one of each party was severely wounded, the Pasha considered it necessary .to intimate to Major-General Beatson that he would no longer delay to put in execution the measures which had been so often announced to him for preventing his troopers carrying arms in the town. This decision was fully justi fied by several instances of these troopers drawing their arms of late, though without producing similar conse quences. Major-General Beatson refused to take any steps in the matter. The Pasha then invited all the Consuls here to consider with him what was best to be done. The result was, that a letter was addressed by him, with their concurrence, to Major-General Beatson, con firming what had been previously communicated to him, and informing him, that if he did not take the steps in question, measures would be taken to oppose by force of arms the entrance of armed troopers into the town. It is therefore not at all unlikely that a violent collision may occur to-morrow, when these measures are to be carried into effect. A considerable degree of excitement exists amongst the troops on both sides, and also in the town. In this grave emergency we have thought it advisable to address your Excellency conjointly, though hurriedly, and by an express steamer, in the hope that some inter position of higher authorities may still prevent bloodshed. The officer commanding H.M.S. Oberon has been re quested to co-operate with the Turkish force for the protection of the town, in case of need.10 The master of the steamer Redpole, which will proceed immediately with this despatch to Therapia, has orders to wait your Lordship’s reply. [Signed] F. W. Calvert. J. H. Skene. To his Excellency Viscount Stratford de Hedcliefe, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. The Ambassador had previously, on more than one occasion, represented to me the unwillingness or inability of Major-General Beatson to exercise due control over his irregular levies. The despatches from the Consuls were in corroboration of the statement of occurrences, of which a precis had been furnished me by order of the Ambassador. Under these emergent circumstances I felt that I had no alternative but to act immediately upon the instructions received from his Excellency, to vest the supreme military authority at the Dardanelles in some officer who would co-operate with the civil functionaries in preserving peace, and preventing collision and blood shed. I therefore resolved on sending to the Dardanelles an officer qualified to succeed Major-General Beatson in the command of the Irregulars, with orders to assume command pending the acceptance of the Major-General’s resignation. Major-General Smith, H.M.’s service, on the staff of the Contingent Cavalry, was accordingly despatched on that duty; and Major-General Beatson was at the same time recalled to my head-quarters, to await the result of the communication w hich he had forwarded to the War Department resigning his command. With Major-General Smith I despatched a body of my own11 infantry to assist the regular troops under the command of the Turkish Pasha at the Dardanelles^ in case of necessity. My proceedings were approved of by her Majesty’s Ambassador, and by General Simpson, on my seeing him shortly afterwards in the Crimea. They were fully reported to the War Department, and met with Lord Panmure’s entire approval, which was communicated to me in a despatch from his Lordship, of which the following is a copy :— JVar Department, \3th Oct. 1855. Sir, — I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 152, of the 27th September, and to signify my entire approval of your conduct, at once decisive and soldier-like, in regard to the Irregular Cavalry. I have likewise to desire that you will inform Major- General Beatson that his services are hereafter dispensed with by her Majesty’s Government. P repeat my approval of the appointment of Major- General Smith as his successor, through whose judgment and discretion, aided by your counsel and support, I earnestly hope that this and other necessary changes will be effected without riot or disturbance; and I anxiously await your report of the result. [Signed) Panmure. To Lieut.-General Vivian. On the 1st of October I had an interview with Major- General Beatson off Buyukdere. The Major-General endeavoured to explain his reasons for not having, in12 * Major-General Beatson’s Pamphlet, page 93. conformity with the orders he had received, placed him self in official communication with me, or replied to my requisitions. The feeling by which Major-General Beatson was actuated at this interview shall be explained in his own words :— “Rumours of a Russian attack upon Kertch, where “part of the Turkish Contingent was stationed, induced “ me to adopt the most conciliatory tone. Lieutenant- “ General Vivian appeared to be sore upon the subject “ of my not having paid him due submission, and insisted “ upon the fact of his not being supplied with official “ documents.” * The explanation given me by Major-General Beatson was not satisfactory in itself, but I was willing to accept his assurance that he had not intentionally evaded my authority ; and as I had reported to Lord Panmure my belief that he had done so, I thought it right to furnish him with an extract of my dispatch. The following correspondence was the result:— Head-Quarters, Buyukdiri, Is# October, 1855. Sir,— By desire of Lieut.-General Vivian, I have the honour to forward for your information copy of an extract of a letter addressed by the Lieutenant-General to the Secretary of State for the War Department, on the 29th ultimo ; and I am directed at the same time to inform you, that anything you may wish to submit to Lord Panmure in explanation, or reply, will be for warded to the War Department, on your transmitting it to the Lieutenant-General. {Signed) James J. Graham, Colonel, Military Secretary. To Major-General Beatson, &amp;c. &amp;c.13 Extract from letter addressed to Lord Panmure by Lleut.- General Vivian, dated 2i)th September, 1855 :— I tliink it right to bring to your Lordship’s notice with reference to my letter of the 19th instant (140), that in reporting in that despatch to your Lordship that Major-General Beatson had stated his intention of withdrawing his letter, I acted on a private note from that officer. I think it necessary to annex an extract* from a note of mine, together with an extractf of Major-General Beatson's reply, bearing on that point. These notes were both written in an unofficial form, and were not intended for publication ; but the extracts contain nothing of a private nature, and its the Major-General has not answered my official despatch on the subject, I presume he can have no inten tion of doing so. I think it also proper to report to your Lordship that I have received no one official reply to any communication which T have found it necessary to address officially to Major-General Beatson since the force under his command was annexed to the Contingent by order of Government, communicated to me in your Lordship's despatch dated 25th August, copy of which I immediately transmitted to that officer. * Extract from note addressed to Major-General Beatson by Lieutenant- General Vivian on the 13th September:— “ In an official of to-day I have advised you to withdraw that portion of your letter where you threaten publication of the correspondence with the War Department and Lord de Redcliffe. You know that it is an unsanctioned course, and quite contrary to all military rule.” ■ f Extract of Major-General Beatson’s note in reply to the above-men tioned note from Lieutenant-General Vivian :— “ As the steamer is just going off, 1 have not time to answer your official letters, but of course I shall take your advice so kindly offered, aud withdraw the letter you recommend me to do.” C14 I was disposed to attribute the non-receipt of any of his replies to accidental circumstances, the more particularly as, in the extract from his note, he states : “ As the steamer is just “ going off, I have not time to reply to your official letter; ” but circumstances have since transpired which lead me to believe that his silence is intentional, as Colonel Crofton has infonned me that no announcement has been made to the Irregular Cavalry by Major-General Beatson of that force having been attached to the Contingent by your Lordship’s orders. I have also heard—on unofficial authority it is true, but which I fully credit—that Major-General Beatson informed Major Blakeley, of the Irregular Cavalry, on the 22nd instant, that he had received letters withdrawing the corps from under my command. I cannot believe it probable that your Lordship can have sanctioned or addressed to that officer any such communication, without having at the same time apprized me of the circum stance ; this, coupled with the fact that the whole of the official letters addressed to the Major-General by my orders, calling for returns, reports, and information connected with the Irregular Horse remain unanswered at this date, induce me to believe that Major-General Beatson ignores, or at least evades, my authority; and as I consider such conduct insubordinate and subversive of all discipline, rendering any officer capable of so conducting himself totally unfit for military command, I should, on satisfying myself of the truth of what I have here brought to notice, have suspended the Major-General from his command, pending your Lordship’s decision in regard to his disposal, irre spective of any of the circumstances reported in my despatch (No. 152) of the 27th instant. Buyukdiri, ls£ October, 1855. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 1st instant, forwarding an extract of your letter addressed to the Secretary of State for the 'War Depart ment on the 29th ultimo, and informing me that anything I15 5 ) might wish to submit to Lord Pamriure in explanation or reply would be forwarded by you to the War Department. I beg to state that with regard to not having withdrawn the letter with reference to a publication of my correspondence with the War Department and Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, that not having forwarded a copy of this letter to the Minister of War, and having in a private letter to yourself expressed my desire to withdraw it, I did not do so with that expedition which, under other circumstances, I should have used ; but I now take this opportunity of requesting that that letter may be withdrawn. As regards my not corresponding officially with you, and your being inclined to attribute it to intention on my part, I can only state that I trust the application of Major Dlakeley to be trans ferred to another division of the Turkish Contingent, together with my accompanying letter to you, requesting that this exchange might not be permitted to take place, may be con sidered as a sufficient proof that such was not my intention j and, with regard to the unofficial report you had received, that I had on the 22nd instant informed Major Blakeley that I had received letters withdrawing this force from under your com mand, to assure you that such a report is totally false; in con firmation of which fact I beg to quote an extract from my letter to the Minister at TV ar of the 8th September, stating that I was willing to march this force wherever you might direct. At the same time, I admit that the fact of the War Department having throughout addressed me, directly, as the commandant of an independent force, may have influenced me in neglecting the proper official channel. As respects the returns you called for, the necessary instruc tions to the officers whose department it concerned were issued, but the correctness required, coupled with the move of my head quarters to camp, has hitherto delayed its being complied with. In conclusion, I trust that these explanations are sufficient to remove the imputation conveyed of evading your orders; and believing that I have removed from your mind the impression of any wilful neglect of duty, I cannot too forcibly place before you the urgency of my returning to the Dardanelles at a moment when my absence may cause serious evils, by the desertion of16 the men, and consequently materially impede the designs origi nally confided to me by Government. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) W. F. Beatson, Major-General, Commanding Beatson’s Horse. To Lieut.-Genekal Vivian, Commanding Turkish Contingent. On board “ Telegraph ” Steamer, 2nd October, 1855. Sm,—In the hurry of departure from Buyukdiri I had only time to request Major-General Michel, my chief of staff, to ac knowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, received this morning, and to inform you that I could not authorize your return to the Dardanelles until I received instructions from superior authority. In further reference to your communication, I beg to state my impression, that if the Irregular Horse embodied by you will act under no other commander than yourself, they can scarcely be considered as likely to meet the original design of Govern ment ; and, if unwilling to follow such superior as her Majesty’s Government may decide on placing in authority over them, the sooner they are disbanded the better. Having submitted the whole correspondence connected with your recall from the Dardanelles to the Minister of War, and his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in the East, I do not feel warranted in altering the arrangement made until I receive the instructions of the one or the other of these authorities, I shall lose no time in submitting your letter of the 1st instant. In regard to the remark that you did not withdraw the letter, which you had previously announced to me your intention of withdrawing, because you had not forwarded a copy to the War Minister, I cannot admit the reason as warranting the omission ;17 first, because you must be aware that a communication forwarded officially to a public functionary, and recorded, can only be properly withdrawn by a document transmitted in the same public official form. Secondly, I cannot see the force of your excuse, since, although you state that you forwarded no copy of such letter to Lord Panmure, you made it public in another quarter, a copy having been transmitted by you to his Excellency the British Ambassador. On the subject of your not having replied to any of the official correspondence which I had directed my staff to address to you, giving me thereby the impression that you intended to evade my authority, I place my faith rather on your simple denial of the fact, than on the argument adduced to prove that you had no such intention. You were addressed so far back as the 6th ultimo ; and if so long a period as up to the present moment became necessary to prepare the documents and infor mation required, ordinary official courtesy would have demanded at least an acknowledgment of my orders, and a simple assurance that they were being attended to. I was anxious to believe your silence attributable to accidental circumstances, and your forwarding Major Blakeley’s letter re specting an exchange was calculated to confirm me in that belief ; but when I saw in that officer’s own writing, subse quently, that you had told him the Irregular Horse had been withdrawn from my command, and when I learned that the annexation of your force to the Contingent had never been pro mulgated by you in orders, I came to a different conclusion, and addressed to the War Minister the letter from which an extract has been furnished you. You now positively deny having made any such communica tion to Major Blakeley, and I am bound to accept your denial; but as the character of that officer is implicated, it will be neces sary to call on him for explanation. I have entered at some length into the grounds which led me to conceive you intended to evade my authority, and nothing that you have urged in the way of proof that you never enter tained such an intention, has in the smallest degree shaken the opinion I had formed on that point; but I willingly accept your , denial of any such motive, and in submitting your letter to18 superior authority, it shall be accompanied by a copy of this communication. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) Major-General Beatson, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. R. J. II. Vivian, Lieut.-General. This correspondence explains my views on the subject; but it must be observed, that in accepting Major-General Beatson s denial of an intention not to recognize my authority, I was in ignorance of the meeting at his quarters on the 30th September, 1855, and of the discussion that then took place. It will be difficult to reconcile Major-General Beatson’s denial with the admission made by his staff, that “ the conference that took place in your [Gen. Beatson’s] room, “and—any person present desirous of speaking the “ truth would bear witness to it— was, as to whether the “ authority produced by Major-General Smith was suffi- “ cient to warrant your resigning the command, at least until the state of affairs was made better known to those “ who appeared ignorant of it {or were wilfully blind), or until confirmed by the superior authority daily “ expected” * And I assert that the matter discussed round your “ bedside was this,—Did Major-General Smith bring an “ authority sufficient to warrant your resigning command “ on the spot, considering the dangers attending so sudden “ and violent a change.” f * Captain Berkeley’s Letter to Major-General Beatson, published in Morning Advertiser, 21st July, 1856. t Captain Burton’s Letter to Major-General Beatsou, published in Morning Advertiser, 21st July, 1856.19 The denial is still more at variance with the evidence given by the other officers on this point, which I shall have occasion to extract hereafter. To resume: After my interview with Major-General Beatson on 1st October, Major-General Smith's despatch of the 30th September reached me, detailing what had taken place at the Dardanelles on his arrival there. {Appendix, No. 3, A to D.) It will be seen by this report that Major-General Beatson declined to make over charge of the Irregular Horse to General Smith, on the ground that the Alba nians would desert in large numbers, or otherwise resist or resent his removal from the command. In this opinion the officers of the Cavalry were said to concur, though Major-General Smith himself doubted the fact. In a military point of view, resistance to a plain and speqjfic order from superior authority is scarcely in any case excusable. The reason given is an admission that the corps was in a disorganized state, and unfit for any military pur pose. But to justify such an extreme measure, it should at least be demonstrable that this opinion of the feeling of the men was well founded ; yet, up to the present moment, so far as I am aware, there never has been shown, nor has there appeared, the slightest ground to suppose that the Albanians would have refused to serve under any other commander. When the order was enforced, not a murmur was heard, and their conduct improved under General Smith. Major-General Beatson had received the first levies of his force in June; he was removed from his command in September; and it is not to be supposed that in so short a period any great attachment could have sprung up between him and his men. On the contrary, the events described in the precis of occurrences already quoted show that he had not acquired such authority or20 influence over his men as was necessary to prevent the irregularities described, or to render it probable that the memorials published in Major-General Beatson J s pam phlet originated spontaneously with his native officers and men. It is clear that on this, as on other occasions, General Beatson was misled by his own peculiar ideas; for he had declared that the Albanians would refuse to give up their arms when entering the town; and yet, on the first demonstration of force on the part of the Turkish autho rities, they quietly submitted to the regulation, and gave up their arms to the civil authorities. (Vide letters ap pended, from Mr. Consul Calvert and Mr. Consul Skene, Appendix No. 4, A, B.) So in like manner, in addressing the War Minister he expressed his conviction that the force would follow no other leader than himself; and in a short time after wards the whole body marched without hesitation over the Balcan to Shumla, under the orders of Major-General Smith. In December, 1855, the cavalry having been in the mean time removed from the Dardanelles to Shumla, and Major-General Smith having been obliged to leave in con sequence of ill-health, I found it necessary to send Major- General Shirley, commander of the cavalry attached to the Turkish Contingent, to make a thorough inspection and special report upon the Irregular Cavalry. The in structions, both official and confidential, that were given to Major-General Shirley are appended {Appendix No. 5, A, B.) ; but I extract a portion of my official instructions to Major-General Shirley, as it will show that I had no wish to lend myself to any party feeling that might exist in regard to the Bashi Bazouks; and that, insending this officer, my object was to ascertain the real state of that corps free from any prejudice :— “ The local civil authorities, I am led to believe, have “ shown some prejudice against the force, and you will no “ doubt find others, under the influence of party spirit “ and prejudice, seeking to bias your opinion. I therc- “ fore beg of you to enter on this duty with a determina- “ tion to form your own opinion; and, following out this “ determination, I feel confident your experience and j u&lt; l£ mcn t will enable you to render valuable service on “ this critical occasion.” On the 27th February, 1856, I received from Major- General Shirley a report of proceedings said to have occurred at the Dardanelles at the end of the month of September preceding. On receipt of this communication, I addressed the following letter to Brigadier Watt, then holding temporary command of the Irregular Cavalry at Shumla, embodying Major-General Shirley's report to me regarding these occurrences. Head-Quarters, Kertch, 5 th March, 1856. ^ iii j In consequence of the recent inspection of the Irregular Cavalry, circumstances have been reported to me as having taken place at the Dardanelles, involving a very serious charge against Major-General Beatson. I consider it quite necessary both for that officer’s character and the public interests, that the report which has reached me should be thoroughly investigated; it is as follows :— “ When General Smith arrived at the Dardanelles, u General Beatson assembled the commanding officers of “ regiments, and actually endeavoured to persuade them22 “ to make a mutiny in their regiments against General Smith and against the authority of General Vivian. “ Two of these commanding officers then left the room, “ saying they were soldiers, and would not listen to “ language which they thought most improper and muti- “ nous. These two were Lieutenant-Colonels O’Reillv “ and Shelley. General IBeatson subsequently had a sort of round “ ro ^in prepared by the chief interpreter, and sent round to the native officers and men, in the hope that they would “ sig 11 itj refusing to serve under any other general than “ himself. This attempt appears, however, to have sig- “ nally failed. “ Both of these mutinous attempts are said to have emanated from Mr. Burton, who, it also appears, kept “the order from Lord Panmure placing the Irregular Horse under General Vivian, for three whole weeks “ l°cked up and unknown to any one but General Beatson; “ an d order was not promulgated till after General “ Smith arrived at the Dardanelles. This is authentic, “ and can be fully proved and substantiated.” The Irregular Horse having been, at my request, re moved from under my command for the present, I shall confine myself to requesting you to take steps immediately to examine into these grave accusations against General Bcatson leaving to yourself to adopt such measures for carrying out the investigation as you may judge most advisable. A copy of this letter will be forwarded to Lord Pan mure, and you will transmit to his Lordship the result of the inquiry as soon as possible. I request you will at the same time furnish me with a copy of your report to the War Minister—the subject being one relating to the period during which the Irregu23 lars were under my command, and therefore one in which I am personally concerned. I have, &amp;c. {Signed) R. J. H. Vivian, Lieut.-General. Major-General Beatson and his advocates accuse me of having ordered a secret inquiry into his conduct during his absence. It will be observed that my directions to the officer in command on the spot, Brigadier M att, a friend of General Beatson, were simply to investigate the matter in such manner as in his own discretion he might deem fit. It is true that the statement of the inspecting officer referred more particularly to Major- General Beatson, who had quitted Turkey; but at the same time it raised a question as to the state of discipline existing amongst the officers of the Irregular Horse. As a general principle it is no doubt fair and desirable that an officer should be present when charges affecting his character are under investigation. Major-General Beatson had, however, embarked for England, and it was impossible that inquiry should, on that account, be postponed when the characters of other officers were involved, and the public interests liable to be placed in jeopardy. Had I abstained from taking any step, and any evil result had followed, it would have been difficult to satisfy the Government that I had pro perly discharged my duty ; and my right to address Major-General .Beatson officially, his resignation of her Majesty's service having been accepted, might have been questioned. Brigadier Watt did not think proper to carry out my instructions pending the return of Major-General Smith to resume command j and Major-General Smith had not24 returned to Shumla when I left Turkey, which the state of my health obliged me to do shortly after the date of my despatch to Brigadier Watt. On my way home I met Major-General Smith at Con stantinople proceeding to rejoin the Irregular Horse; and about a fortnight after meeting him I reached England. Soon after my arrival I met General Beatson,—and on alluding to the subject of the inquiry at Shumla, and finding he was in ignorance on the matter, I sought and obtained permission of the War Minister to communicate to him, in an unofficial shape, the information contained in my letter to Brigadier Watt. Captain Ramsay, my late Aide-de-Camp, accordingly sent to Major General Beatson an extract of my letter above mentioned—including the whole of it down to the vord substantiated/’ which contained all that it was important for General Beatson to know. General Beatson acknowledged the document with thanks at the time in a private note to myself; but a month afterwards, without anything having interme diately occurred to account for the change, he addressed a letter to me, declining my acquaintance. The docu ment itself has since been made the ground of a most unwarrantable attack on Captain Ramsay, who has been charged with intentional deception because he inad vertently signed it as “ a true copy,” instead of “ a true extract.” Hie extract not having been given officially, there was no occasion for its being signed at all; but it must be perfectly obvious that its being called a “ copy ” instead of an extract w r as a mere inadvertent clerical error. No one who is acquainted with Captain Ramsay would believe him capable of an unworthy intention ; and in this case no motive can even be shown for deception, as all25 that concerned General Beatson had been faithfully tran scribed. All the information available with regard to the allegations against Major-General Beatson having thus been communicated to him at my instance, as soon as was at liberty to make the communication, his complaint of secrecy on my part must be considered to be wholly unfounded. , I do not feel called upon to vindicate myself from the wholly unfounded aspersions contained in the puhhshe letters of Captains Burton and Berkeley, who have chosen to impute to me personal enmity and other unwort ly motives, that had not, and could not have had, existence in my mind. But the publication of their letters, an that of General Beatson, in the Morning Advertiser of the 21st July, 1856, has exposed some inconsistencies which, as affecting the value of their statements on other points, cannot be left unnoticed. Major-General Beatson, in his letter to the War Minister under date 4th June, states as follows “ Again, I am represented as having had a sort of round “ robin prepared for a mutinous purpose. The document “ referred to, if existing elsewhere than in the imagination “ of my accusers, must have been one of several petitions “ addressed to me from regiments under my command -respectfully deprecating their amalgamation with General « V i vi an’s Contingent; and they were [with one exception) - all in my hands long before General Smith’s arrival at my - he ad-quarters.” —(See the Morning Advertiser, July 21st, 1856.) Captain Burton, with reference to the same subject, says:— “ And, first, of withholding the order. Whilst I bad “ the honour to serve under you, you well know that 127 of the order of the War Minister, attaching the Bashi Bazouks to the Turkish Contingent. Yet it will be seen hereafter that this order, though not promulgated among the officers, was immediately made known to the native officers and men of the Irregular Cavalry. Because on the 14th of September,— fifteen days before the arrival of General Smith,—we find that they were combining to petition Government against the measure of embodying them with the Turkish Contingent, which they expressly declare they had been informed of the evening before. The words of one petition are :— “We learned yesterday evening, with inexpressible grief, “ that your Excellency has given up the command of the “ Irregular Cavalry, and that this command had been “ transferred to General Vivian, the officer commanding “ the contingent of regular troops at Constantinople.^— (See Major-General Beatson's Pamphlet.) And the words of another are :— “ Yesterday evening we have heard that your Excellency “ had given up the command of ‘ Beatson’s Horse/ and “ that this command had been transferred to General “ Vivian, Commander-in-Chief of regular troops at Con- “ stantinople. This report has grieved us all, and we hasten “ to address to you this petition, which we beg of you to “ forward to the Government of her Majesty, our august “ Queen.”—(See Major-General Beatson’s Pamphlet.) These petitions are stated to have been signed respec tively by seventeen, and by twenty native officers: the one being headed “ Petition from the 1st Regiment of “ Beatson’s Irregular Horse /’ the other, “ Petition of the “ 5th Regiment of Beatson’s Irregular Cavalryand both are addressed to “ His Excellency General Beatson, Com-28 “ mander of Irregular Cavalry, called ' Beatson^s Horse/ » —(See Major-General Beat son’s Pamphlet, where these petitions are inserted in full.) Ihe dates of these petitions, whether by accident or intention, are not inserted; but the omission has been supplied in the Morning Advertiser of the 21st July, 1856 —so far as regards one petition—that of the 5th regiment, which is there given in full (though apparently from the hand of a different translator), and bears date the 14th of September, 1855. Hence it appears that fifteen days before the arrival of Major-General Smith at the Dardanelles to assume the command, not only was it known to the native officers and men that the Irregular Cavalry had been attached to the Turkish Contingent, but they had also been made aware of Major-General Beatson’s consequent intention to relin quish the command, as communicated to the War Minister in the Major-Generals letter dated the 8th of September, It must also be observed that the nature of the order does not appear to have been fairly explained to the men. Irom the wording of their petitions, it is clear that they had been led to believe that the Government designed by a breach of faith, to alter the character of their service' and convert them into regular troops. Their com plaint is:— (&lt; “ We b °g t0 represent that we were recruited by Major '‘Rhodes, on the express understanding that we should be considered soldiers of the British Government, but „ ‘ 7 should i * 1 ' ,a J' s be considered Irregulars or Bashi „ aZ ° Uks; 7' that '' e should b e permitted to preserve ™r national costume, and be exempted from the drill r/ 7 r00ps - With l )erfect reliance on the word &lt;&gt; - tajor Rhodes, and considering it perfectly conform-29 “ able with the intentions of the British Government, we “ voluntarily enlisted for the purpose of fighting the enemy “ under your Excellency's command. But rumour informs “ us that your Excellency has given up the command, “ believing that we have shown the desire to be placed “ under the orders of General Vivian. Nothing is further “ from our thoughts; and if this General is forced upon “ us as chief, we shall continually live in dread of being “ made Regulars, and lose all hopes of obtaining the “ desired result. In thus declaring that we desire your “ Excellency as our commandant, we beg you to have the “ kindness to forward this our petition to the glorious “ British Government.' And the 5th regiment are made to say :— “ When we offered our services to the English Govern- “ ment through the channel of Colonel Brett, the officer “ commanding our regiment, he gave us to understand “ that we should be employed in the following manner : “ That we should remain Bashi Bazouks, preserving our “ national dress; that we should not become nizam, or “ regulars; that we should not undergo the drill of “ regulars; and that we should not be brigaded with “ regulars: but that all our chiefs should be English “ officers; that we should be in British pay; that we “ should bear the name of ‘ Beatson's Horse ;' and that “your Excellency should be our Commander-in-Chief. “ Under these conditions we enlisted for this service, “ because England is sacrificing its troops and money in “ the defence and for the protection of our Government. “We were certain that the words of Colonel Brett were “ those of the British Government; on the faith of this “conviction we entered the service. We now learn that “ the chief command is transferred to General Vivian, £30 “ and that we shall be under his orders with regular “ troops. This is contrary to what Colonel Brett told us. “ It is not credible that England should not keep its “ word; our corps dreads being incorporated with regu- “ lars, lest its present organization be interfered with. “ W e only flock to your standard to be under your com- “ mand, and to be honoured by the name of ‘ Beatson’s Horse/ We entreat your Excellency to forward our “ present petition to the British Government, and to sup- “ port our claim to be honoured by your command under “ the name of ‘ Beatson’s Horse/ ” The foregoing quotations show that the order attaching the Bashi Bazouks to the Turkish Contingent, and with a false idea of the intention of Government, had been communicated to the native officers and men on or before the 13th September. While, on the other hand, it is perfectly certain, from statements which have been fur nished by Lieutenant-Colonel O’Reilly and Major Shelley, and the admissions of Major-General Beatsonand his staff, that the order had not been officially communicated to the English officers when the meeting was held at Major- General Beatson’s quarters on the 30th September. The non-promulgation of the order to the English officers, to whom it was essential it should be known, while the native officers and men were informed of it,— although apprehensions were entertained that it would cause them to mutiny or desert,—must be regarded as strange and unaccountable. It also seems extraordinarv that a false idea of the meaning and intent of the order was allowed to rankle in the minds of the men, when it would have been perfectly easy to make them understand that the object of attaching them to the Contingent, under the order received, was not to alter the terms on which31 they had enlisted, or to change their organization as Bashi Bazouks; but simply to transfer them from the com mand of one British officer to that of another. There was ample time between the 14th September and the 30th to have removed from the minds of the men the erroneous notions with which they were impressed, from whatever source derived; and which, according to General Beatson and his officers, were likely to be productive of so much mischief. As regards the non-publication of the order, we have the fact admitted, and the reason given, by Major- General Beatson himself, in the following extract from his letter to Lord Panmure, published in the Morning Advertiser :— “ I am next charged (or Captain Burton acting under “ my instructions, is charged) with having c locked up for c&lt; ( three whole weeks &gt; your Lordship’s order attaching &lt;l my force to the Turkish Contingent. This tale is equally “fabulous with the rest. Every officer of the cavalry (&lt; under my command was acquainted with the existence “of that order; even Lieut.-Colonel O’Reilly does not “ venture on a denial of his knowledge that such an order “ had been received. The publication of that order was “ simply delayed by me, for local reasons, in the exercise “ of a discretion usually permitted to officers employed “on independent command. That such discretion ■was “ rightly exercised by me the event fully demonstrated; “ and my successor, General Smith, concurred in the “ measures adopted. What, then, becomes of the charge? “ There is positively nothing for me to refute.” It was represented by General Beatson and other officers of the force to Major-General Smith, that serious evil consequences would result from his immediate assumption32 of the command of the Irregulars. He had no means of determining the truth of these representations, and though he doubted their correctness, he deemed it the more prudent course to accede to an arrangement the responsibility of which Major-General 13 eat son, as his senior officer , had taken upon himself in manner follow ing “ M ith regard to that portion of the order which “ makes over to you the command of the Irregular “ Cavalry, I take upon myself the responsibility of direct- “ ing Brigadier-General Brett to assume temporary 11 command of this force, until fresh instructions shall “ have been received from General Vivian. The peculiar exigencies of the case justify me, I “ believe, in the step which, as your senior officer, I now “ take, feeling that the organization of this force, and the “ l ar gc sums expended on it by Government, would be perilled by any other proceeding.” — (See Appendix No. 3, C.) Under the circumstances represented to, and reported by, Major-General Smith, I approved of his proceedings; but six days afterwards,—namely, on the 8th October, consequent on further information, I directed General Michel, the chief of stall, to write to the Major-General to take immediate command of the Irregular Horse whenever he might deem it expedient. Major-General Smith had, however, anticipated my instructions, having assumed the immediate command on the morning of the day m which General MichePs dispatch reached him. Ihe Major-GeneraPs order, assuming command, was car ried out as a matter of course, without eliciting the slightest demonstration from the Bashi Bazouks; thus clearly showing that the feelings ascribed to them by33 Major-General Beatson and Lis staff-officers were purely imaginary. In reference to tlie circumstances which occurred at Major-General Beatson’s quarters on the 30th September, Captain Burton, in his letter to the Major-General, published in the Morning Advertiser, expresses himself in the following characteristic terms :— “My answer to Lieutenant-Colonel Eugene O’Reilly, « the sole evidence of the second attempt to mutiny ema- “ nating, it is said, from me, is simply this: He falsely “ states that he and Major Shelley ‘ left the room, saying “ f they were soldiers, and could not listen to language “ ‘ which they thought most improper and mutinous/ “ Neither you, nor Major Berkeley, nor I, are in the « habit of allowing such expressions to pass unchastised; “ and had words so pregnant with meaning been really “ used, could Major Shelley* in whose honour I have the “ fullest confidence, have failed to remember them ? “ Lieutenant-Colonel O’Reilly well understood that when “ saying, e Of course you know what to do? ’ I meant “ nothing beyond our asking Major-General Smith to “ withhold publication of the order placing him in com- “mand of Beatson’s Horse,—a proceeding which the “ Major-General thought proper to adopt. I distinctly “ deny ever questioning the fidelity of your regiments. “And, briefly to dispose of the mass of falsehoods and “ inconsistencies of 'which Lieutenant-Colonel Eugene “ O’Reilly has made himself the mouthpiece, I assert that * The statement of Major Shelley, in whose honour Captain Burton has the fullest confidence, as given to Major-General Shirley, will be found at page 38. The purport of it was, that though he could not recollect the exact words used, they were of so mutinous a character that he considered it his duty to leave General Beatson’s room. His words to General Shirley were _&lt;* / considered it direct mutiny.” — (See Major-General Shirley’s Letter, Appendix No. 6.)34 “ the matter discussed round your bedside was this,— “ r Did Major-General Smith bring an authority sufficient “ f to warrant your resigning command on the spot, con- “ ‘ sidering the dangers attending so sudden and violent a “ ‘ change ?’ I do not hesitate to own, that whilst you “ confined yourself to producing the orders of which “ Major-General Smith was the bearer, I at once ten- u dered my resignation. Brigadier-General Brett did the “ same. Colonel Crofton, your commandant of Artillery, ff wrote from Scutari on the 27th September, 1855, offering, “ in case of our amalgamation with the Turkish Contingent, “ to do the same. But I affirm, upon my honour, that “Major Berkeley and I did all in our power to prevent a “ mutiny.” Here then we have—Captain Burton’s distinct denial that he ever questioned the fidelity of the regiments; Captain Burton’s emphatic assertion that the com manding officers of regiments were assembled at General Beatson’s quarters for the express purpose of discussing whether General Smith brought with him an authority sufficient to warrant General Beatson’s resigning com mand on the spot, considering the dangers attending so sudden and violent a change; Captain Burton’s affirmation, upon his honour, that he and Major Berkeley did all in their power to prevent a mutiny; And Captain Burton’s unhesitating admission, that whilst General Beatson confined himself to producing the orders of which Major-General Smith was the bearer, he. Captain Burton, at once tendered his resignation ; that Brigadier-General Brett did the same; and that Colonel Crofton, General Beatson’s commandant of Artillery, had written from Scutari, on the 27th September, offering,35 in case of amalgamation with the Turkish Contingent, to do the same. In the face of the foregoing admissions, can any doubt exist as to what Captain Burton really meant when he said to Lieutenant-Colonel Eugene O’Reilly, after informing him that the presence of commanding officers was required at head-quarters, “ Of course you know what to do ?” It only remains to notice first, the coarse denial given by Captain Burton to Lieutenant-Colonel O’Reilly’s statement; and, secondly, Captain Burton’s assertion, in which he is supported by General Beatson and by Major Berkeley, that the whole of the officers were acquainted with the order of the War Minister attaching the Irregular Horse to the Turkish Contingent, and placing Major- General Beatson under my command. Here again I shall allow parties to speak for themselves. With his report to the War Department, Major-General Smith forwarded the following communications from Lieutenant-Colonel O’Reilly and Major Shelley, bearing on the inquiry he had been instructed to institute. From Lieutenant-Colonel O’Reilly, dated Shumla, March 28, 1856. Snt,—In obedience to your request to furnish you with a statement of what I can recollect of certain circum stances which occurred the day of your arrival at the Dardanelles, I present what follows, being, to the best of my belief, all of importance that occurred. Being in the camp of the 4th regiment, I was called aside by Captain Burton, at that time chief of the staff to Major-General Beatson. He told me that you had been sent to replace General Beatson, and that the piescnce of all officers commanding regiments was required at head36 quarters. I said that I would be down immediately. When riding away he said, “ Of course you know what to do Upon arriving at General Beatson’s house, I met Brigadier Brett in the ante-room. I asked him whether he had seen General Beatson. He said, “ Yes, poor fellow; they have sent General Smith to replace him. It is a great shame. I have given in my resignation.” He then went out of the house. When I entered General Beatson’s room, he called all the officers present round his bed. He said, “ that he had called us together to let us know that the Ambassador had caused General Vivian to send General Smith to replace him, which he conceived he had no right to do, as he was under the orders of no one hut Lord Panmure.” Captain Burton then read the letter, ordering General Beatson to give over the command to you. Captain Burton and Captain Berkeley both spoke for a long time, about intriguing on the part of the embassy to deprive General Beatson of his position, which had pro duced the illegal order from General Vivian which had just been read. I asked whether we had not some time previously been placed under General Vivian’s orders. General Beatson said that he had been ordered to correspond through the officer commanding the Contingent. Captain Burton said that that order had been virtually cancelled by Lord Panmure himself, who corresponded directly with General Beatson. He then produced an envelope addressed “ To the Officer commanding her Majesty’s Forces, Dardanelles,” and argued upon that, that General Beatson was recog nized as a Commander-in-Chief. I then insisted on seeing all the letters from Lord Panmure relating to the connection of the Irregular Horse and Contingent. While37 Captain Burton was looking for them, the officers present, with the exception of Major Copeley,* of the Osmanli Horse Artillery, and myself, entered into conversation at the other end of the room. Captain Burton having pro duced a letter, I called Major Shelley to hear it read. The letter placed us directly under the command of General Vivian, and made the Irregular Horse part of the Contingent. Captain Berkeley said that Lord Panmure had broken faith with us and the Bashi Bazouks; that we had joined, and they had enlisted into the force as Beatson’s Horse, and no one had a right to give the com mand to any one else. Captain Burton said, “ that it was our duty to inform General Smith that it was impos sible for him to take the command, at present; that we should wait upon him in a body, and tell him that we could not answer for the fidelity of our regiments; and that if he persisted in taking the command we should resign/’ I argued against the unsoldierly reasons which he was then giving for our required resignation; hut perceiving that General Beatson (who was suffering from a recent fall from his horse) did not appear to notice what was going on, nor say anything to terminate the discussion, Major Shelley and myself left the room. I have, &amp;c. {Signed) Eugene O’Reilly, Lieut.-Col., Osmanli Irregular Cavalry. Major-General Smith, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. * Sic — Query , Colclough. F38 From Major Shelley, dated— Shumla, 28/A March, 1856. My dear General, —To the best of my remembrance, shortly after your arrival at the Dardanelles, I found myself, M'ith the other commanding officers, at the quarters of General Beatson, when some conversation ensued, in the course of which a letter was produced, through which it appeared that the force was attached to the Turkish Contingent. Immediately upon hearing which, both Lieut.-Colonel O’Reilly and myself proceeded to report and place ourselves under your command. Beyond this, I really cannot make any distinct state ment. Believe me, &amp;c., {Signed) Edward Shelley. Major-General Smith, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Major Shelley’s letter being so brief, it becomes neces sary to append an extract from Colonel Shirley’s letter, addressed to the Minister at War, under date July 2nd, 1856 {Appendix No. 6) :— “ Major Shelley distinctly repeated to me in Pera, on “ the 13th of February last, that though he could not a recollect the exact words made use of, and which com- “ petted him to quit General Beatson’s room, yet that they “ were of so mutinous a character, that he considered it his c&lt; duty to leave. His words to me were, ‘ I considered it “ ‘ direct mutiny’ ” i The following are extracts (bearing upon the foregoing points) from Colonel Morgan’s evidence, as taken by39 Major-General Smith, under instructions from the War Department, 26th May, 1856 :— Question 7: Did General Beatson make any statement to the officers present; and if so, what Avas it ? Answer : General Beatson stated that he called us to consider whether we ivere attached to the Turkish Con tingent or not; and that, in consequence of letters being sent to him direct from the War-office, he considered we ivere not. Question 10: Were any statements made or any ques tions asked relative to the Irregular Horse being placed under General Vivian’s orders ; and if so, what were they ? Answer : I heard no statements made on this subject; but I recollect Major Colclough asking if the force were attached to the Turkish Contingent or not ; and I believe the answer he received Avas that the force ivas not attached to the Contingent: but who ansAvered the ques tion I do not knoAV. Question 11: Did you, Avith Colonel O’Reilly, hear any letter read ; and if so, what Avas the subject ? Answer: I heard a letter—I believe from General Vivian—read by Captain Burton, to the effect that the force was placed under his {General Vivian’s) orders. Question 12 : Did Captain Burton make the following statement, in your hearing, “ that it Avas our duty to inform General Smith that it Avas impossible for him to take the command at present; that avc should Avait upon him in a body, and tell him that avc could not ansAver for the fidelity of our regiments; and that if he persisted in taking the command, avc should resign ? ” AnsAver : I recollect hearing Captain Burton say some thing about not answering for the fidelity of the men ; but as I Avas standing near the window at the balcony, and40 talking to Major Shelley, I could not hear well what was said. I remember also that high words passed between Colonel O'Reilly and Captain Burton; but of which I do not recollect the purport. Extracts from Colonel Sankey’s evidence :— Question 2 : Do you remember being ordered to attend at General Beatson’s quarters on or about the day I arrived at the Dardanelles, and did you go there ? Answer : Yes, and I went there. Question 4: Did General Beatson make any statement to the officers present; and if so, what was it ? Answer: General Beatson stated that he had not con sidered himself as finally attached to the Turkish Contin gent, pending a reference to the War-office, since he had received despatches direct from Lord Panmure. Question 5 : Did Captain Burton read a letter; and if so, what were the contents ? Answer: The only letter I heard read by Captain Burton was one to the effect that the force was placed under the Turkish Contingent. Question 6: Did Captain Burton and Captain Berkeley make any statement relative to intrigue on the part of the Embassy to deprive General Beatson of his position? Answer : I do not remember anything about it. There was a good deal of conversation carried on; but I did not know the subject of it, as I was at the other end of the room. Question 7: Were any statements made, or any ques tions asked, relative to the Irregular Horse being placed under General Vivian’s orders; and if so, what were they ? Answer : I think that Colonel O'Reilly asked if any documents had arrived on that subject, on which Captain Burton produced the letter already alluded to.Question 8 : Did Captain Burton make the following statement in your hearing, “ that it was our duty to “ inform General Smith that it was impossible for him to &lt;( take the command at present; that we should wait upon “ him in a body, and tell him that we could not answer for “ the fidelity of our regiments ; and that if he persisted in “ taking the command, we should resign ? ” Answer : Yes, Captain Burton did make that statement. Question 9 : Is there any other information you think it desirable to give ? Answer : At the above interview, General Beatson stated, that as he was going to Buyukdere, and fearing that the men might make some demonstration through attachment to him, he desired Colonel Morgan and myself to remain as much in camp as possible, to prevent any such disturbance, and that in the mean time General Brett would command in camp. I have already stated the above circumstance to General Shirley at his inspec tion of the force last February. The following extract [Appendix No. 6), from Colonel Shirley’s letter before adverted to, has reference to the statement made by Colonel Sankey, on the occasion referred to by him in his last reply :— “ Lieutenant-Colonel Sankey informed me that he and “ several officers in the force told General Beatson they 11 were ready to resign their commissions, but that they “ could not act in a manner which they considei'ed would “ be unsoldier-like and improper; to which General “ Beatson replied, that he did not wish them to make so “ great a sacrifice, nor to injure their own prospects in “ order to prove their sympathy and adherence to his “ cause. I understood this conversation to have had “ reference to some wish expressed by General Beatson42 that the officers should decline to acknowledge the autho- “ rity of General Smith, or of General Vivian” The following is an extract from a letter from Captain Berkeley to Major-General Beatson, published in the Morning Advertiser :— ‘ I confess, with regard to the occasion of Major-General “ Smith coming down to assume the command, and the officers thereon being assembled in your room, I should be sorry, after a period of so many months, to make a positive statement of what each individual said and did ; “ the more s( b as Lieutenant-Colonel O’Reilly's remarkable “ recollection of what he himself and everybody else said, does not seem to have met with much success, or even cor roboration on the part of Major Shelley, who, evidently, “ does not place the same reliance on his own memory or “ ima gmation. In General Vivian’s letter of the 5th of March he states that Lieutenant-Colonel O’Reilly and f Ma j° r Shelley left the room, saying they were soldiers, “and could not listen to language which they thought ^ improper and mutinous. I do not see that this state- “ ment is made by either of these officers in their “respective letters; were it so, I should state in answer “that it is false. Lieutenant-Colonel O’Reilly falsely “states, that I said, 'No one had a right to give the “'command of the Irregular Horse to any one else/ “ though I most probably did say, as I thought, that under ^ existing circumstances Lieutenant-General Vivian had not that right, without further reference to the War “^ Department. The conference that took place in your “ room—and any person present, desirous of speaking the “ truth, would bear witness to it—ivas, as to whether the “ authority produced by Major-General Smith was suffi- “ cient to warrant your resigning the command, at least43 “ until the state of affairs was made better known to those “ who appeared ignorant of it (or were wilfully blind), or “ until confirmed by the superior authority daily expected.” One extract more shall complete my quotations. It is from the letter of Captain Burton, chief of the staff, addressed to Major-General Beatson, and by the Major- General, I presume, published in the Morning Advertiser :— “ It is strange that while Lieutenant-Colonel Eugene “ O’Reilly,—an individual still, I believe, holding local and “ temporary rank as an officer and gentleman in Turkey ,— “ furnishes minute details of occurrences, or (what comes “ to the same thing for the object in view) of what he “ imagines to have occurred. Major Shelley, when “ applied to, really cannot make any distinct statement.” Comment upon the above-recited proceedings of a body of officers, in the presence of their General, on receiving the commands of superior authority, and upon the fore going quotations and proofs which I have adduced, would be altogether superfluous. I have therefore confined myself to indicating by italics the more material points; and having thus stated my case, I have only to remark in conclusion, that my acquaintance with General Beatson was hut slight previous to our meeting at Constantinople when engaged in the discharge of our respective duties. Our intercourse at that time was of a friendly character, and so far from the circumstance which placed us at issue on a point of duty having caused any estrangement, I parted from General Beatson at Buyukdere, as I imagined, on friendly terms. From that hour to the period of General Shirley's report, nothing occurred to make any alteration in those feelings on my part towards General Beatson. It is impossible, therefore, to find any motive for the44 ungenerous line of conduct towards that officer which he and his friends have so sedulously ascribed to me. The reason for my not communicating with him on the sub ject of the inquiry, the conducting of which had been committed to other hands, has been stated; but so far from there being any desire on my part to keep General Beatson in ignorance on the subject, the fact of my having obtained for him all available information on meeting him in London, must be a convincing proof that I desired no secrecy. As additional evidence of this, I will here quote an extract of a letter addressed by me to the Secretary of State for War on the 21st July last, with reference to Mr. Frederick Peel's reply to the question of Colonel Dunne in the House of Commons a few days before, and immediately previous to the debate on the motion of Mr. Roebuck, regarding Major-General Beatson's case, on the 22nd of that month :— “ I would desire, in conclusion, to direct your Lord- “ ship’s attention to a leading article in the Morning “ Herald of the 19th instant, in order to satisfy your “ Lordship of the necessity of having the plain facts of the “ case submitted to Parliament, that the public may be “ disabused of impressions so injurious to my character. I “ earnestly hope, therefore, that, unless in your Lordship’s a judgment the publication would be detrimental to the “ public interests, the whole of the correspondence on the “ subject may be submitted to Parliament,” R. J. H. Vivian, Late Lieut.-General in command of Turkish Contingent.45 Since writing the foregoing, Major-General Smith has sent me the demi-official letter, which I wrote to him on the 2nd October, 1855, on board the Telegraph, approving his proceedings.* As explanatory of my views on the occasion, I will here insert the demi-official letter adverted to:— Tuesday, 2nd October, Telegraph Steamei'. My dear Smith, —I am on my way to Sebastopol by General Simpson’s order. Before starting this morning, I instructed General Michel to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ult., which I received late last night only. I directed him to inform you that I entirely approved of your proceedings, reported in the correspond ence f submitted with your letter under acknowledgment. I repeat to you that I quite approve of all you have done; you have acted with much judgment and decision, and though I address you in an unofficial form, you will con sider this communication perfectly public. I had no time to communicate my opinion to you at length, and, indeed, before doing so, I should desire to be furnished with the further information which I attend from you. Meanwhile, there are one or two points I would desire to draw your attention to. I hold it immaterial your taking direct command of the Irregulars, so long as all continues quiet, and the necessity is not forced on you, because you are virtually in command of the whole. This must, however, be dis tinctly understood by the whole of the European and * This, it will be observed, was the day following that of my interview with Major-General Beatson at Buyukderi. t Appendix, Nq. 3, A to D. O46 native officers; and at your proposed interview you will doubtless have set this matter clearly before them. I trust likewise that the conduct of the European officers will lead you at this interview, and subsequently, to feel assured that you may rely on their full support and co operation—that ready support which every British officer is bound to afford to his superior, and which every loyal officer and subject yields heartily to duly constituted authority. If any should fail in the most perfect obedi ence to your orders, or should fail readily to give you the support you are entitled to from each, I direct you to at once suspend such officer from his functions, and to remove him without delay, pending my orders, from the • head-quarters of your force, to such place as may seem to you expedient; and I further direct you to refuse to accept the resignation of such officer without my distinct approval being first communicated. Any officer wishing to retire from the service must apply through you in the usual manner, and, if his influence on the spot is likely to prove injurious to the public interests, direct him to proceed to such quarter as may seem to you advisable, there to await my decision. I have reason to believe that an attempt has been made to influence the Irregular troops against us, by pro pagating reports as to an intention on the part of the authorities to convert them into Regulars—a change which would be viewed by them with the greatest aversion. Let it be distinctly made known by the most public mode that you can adopt, that there is not the most remote intention of any such change; the constitution of the force is in no way to be altered. All that the men have to do, is to obey the properly constituted authorities; they cannot be permitted to select their own leaders. The British Government will make its own choice of itsservants, and the men in the pay of that Government must obey implicitly the commands of those appointed to lead them. They will be Avell paid, fed, and cared for; in return, they must obey orders of all kinds. Their pre judices and customs will not be interfered with, but they will not be permitted to break the laws of the country they reside in. Take the earliest opportunity of promul gating this. I am a bad sailor, and cannot write very clearly on board ship. Believe me, &amp;c. { Signed ) It. J. H. Vivian. Major-General Smith.* Vide page 8 of preceding Narrative. APPENDIX. No. 1. Head-Quarters, Buyukdery, 27th September, 1855. My Lord, —I have the honour to submit to your Lordship copies of a despatch * from Brigadier-General Mansfield on the subject of the Irregular Horse, with my reply to the British Ambassador. It has been unfortunate that the undecided state of affairs in regard to my own force should have rendered it impracticable for me to proceed to the Dardanelles to have satis fied myself of the real state of affairs there; but, expecting daily orders for the embarkation of my own force, it was impossible that I could leave my post. The opinion expressed by the British Minister left me no alternative but the one taken, and I trust that your Lordship will approve the course I have pursued. I should have considered it unsafe to have sent any officer to assume such a charge as that of the Irregular Horse, under the circumstances detailed by the two civil authorities at the Darda nelles, without placing some regular troops at his disposal. The officer superseding Major-General Beatson will have to carry out a measure which the latter officer has refused to en force ; consequently, it is not likely that he will be favourably received by these wild and undisciplined men. Major-General Smith is an officer unaccustomed to the com mand of irregular troops, but he is just, firm, and obedient to his superiors; and I trust much to his qualities in bringing this force, if it be indeed possible, to a state of order. It is a great mistake in having them collected in so large a50 body, and I regret most bitterly that now, at the eleventh hour, I am called upon to take those troops with me to Kertch. Your Lordship must not suppose that in communicating my sentiments I am making difficulties; I am simply representing them, and will do my utmost to overcome them ; but my firm conviction is, that unless in small bodies, when they may be easily coerced, they will be found rather to hamper an army than to afford it any assistance; and I regret that circumstances should have rendered it necessary for her Majesty’s Government to attach them to my Contingent. I conclude, from the terms in which General Beatson tendered his resignation, that it is unlikely you will comply with his request, and revoke your order placing his force under my command; in such case I beg you will confirm my order re calling him from the Dardanelles, and placing General Smith in command; or that you will communicate to me such instructions regarding his disposal, and the command of the Irregulars, as you may deem it expedient to furnish me with. {Signed) R.

J- H. Vivian, Lieut.-General. His Excellency Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. No. 3, A. Dardanelles, September 20th, 1855. Sir, —I have the honour to state that upon landing here about two p.m. yesterday, I delivered the letters with which I was intrusted to the British Consul and to the Ambassador’s delegate. I then waited upon General Beatson, whom I found suffering from an accident. I gave him the letter of which I was the bearer, and also communicated to him the order directing him to proceed to head-quarters, and directing me to assume the command of the Irregular Horse stationed here. I also ac quainted him with the nature of my instructions, and informed him, as directed, that the publication of the order superseding him in command was suspended, so as to afford him time to tender his resignation if he thought fit to do so. I understood him to say that he did not feel himself prepared to resign, as he had been in direct communication with the Minister of AVar, and wished to await the arrival of the next mail from England. I did not think the tenor of my instructions and the state of affairs warranted me in agreeing to this delay; and as I did not think the interview likely to prove satisfactory, or lead to any definite result, I addressed to General Beatson a letter, inclosing copy of the order, directing him to proceed to head-quarters, and placing me in command of the Irregular Horse. This letter produced the correspondence attached. General Beatson and other ofticers of the force have informed me that they apprehend that the men of the Irregular Horse will desert in large numbers, in the event of the order to supersede53 ii General Beatson and attach the force to the Contingent being immediately communicated to the men. I have some reason to believe them mistaken in this supposition, and to believe that if I could command the full assistance and co-operation of all the officers, European and native, belonging to the force, the irregu larities to any great extent might be avoided; however, I have not as yet had the opportunity to become sufficiently acquainted with the details to form a decided opinion on this point. At present, all appears to be going on quietly here; there has as yet been no collision between the irregulars and regular forces, and I have reason to hope that the measures which have been adopted by the Turkish authorities, and subsequently concurred in by the Consuls, will prevent anything of the kind. I have made arrangements for an interview with all the officers, European and native, of the Irregular Cavalry this evening, when I intend to take the opportunity of explaining, that in attaching them to the Contingent, and placing them under the command of Lieutenant-General Vivian, there is no intention, at present, to form them into regular troops, or (except in case of necessity) to alter the present constitution of the force. Brigadier-General Brett waited on me on the part of General Beatson, and, in presence of Mr. Skene, stated that he (General Beatson) was prepared to comply with the terms of my last letter, herewith attached. I have only to add that no exertion on my part shall be spared to prevent desertion or other irregularities, and that I shall furnish you with further particulars at the earliest opportunity.

The peculiar exigencies of the case justify me, I believe, in t io step winch, as your senior officer, I now take, feeling that the organ,mtion of tl.is force, and the large sums expended on it by Government, will be greatly perilled by any other pro- ceedmg. r At the same time this measure will in no way prevent your obtaining from the officers of this force any information you may require.

In answer to the remaining portion of the letter, I beg to state that, in the event of Brigadier-General Brett receiving written instructions to act under, my orders, as senior officer of the Contingent force stationed here, to which force the Irregular Cava ry has been recently attached, I shall leave the command lor the present with regard to all duties of detail in the Brigadier’s hands, and also withhold the publication of the order p acing mo in the immediate command of the Irregular Horse,50&gt; so as to admit of further instructions being communicated from head-quarters, unless some unforeseen contingency should force me to act otherwise. • . A . . Although for the present I withhold the publication o order placing me in command of the Irregular Horse I must beg that, in case I think it expedient to assemble the othcers for the purpose of stating to them, in the capacity of senior officer of the Contingent force stationed here, any matter which I may think important as tending to prevent desertion or for other pur poses, Brigadier Brett may be directed to facilitate my doing so. In conclusion, I beg to thank you for your compliance with my wish to be furnished with official documents, in order to carry out the instructions with which I have been furnished.

My Lord,— Referring to the joint report made to your Excellency on the 2oth instant by Ur. Skene and myself, I have now the honour to state that on the morning of the 26th, no satisfactory reply having been received by the Pasha from Major-General Beatson, the measures which had been previously concerted for preventing armed or mounted irregular troops from coming into town, were effectually carried out in the presence of a strong military force, ready to prevent any infringements of the Pasha’s orders to that effect; Lieutenant- Commander Freeland having likewise placed II.M.S. Oberon in position for acting in case of need. Finding, however, after the troops were actually under arms, that the Turkish authorities, alive as they were to the evident commotion which prevailed in the Irregular camp, were waver-57 ing ; feeling conlident, too, that everything depended upon their firmness and perseverance, and that an opposite course was far more likely to provoke a collision, I deemed it necessary to accompany the Pashas to the point outside the town where their principal force was stationed; and did not cease to urge upon them, in the strongest possible terms, the absolute necessity of abiding unflinchingly by their expressed determination. I remained there until the success of the measure was fully assured and evidenced by the entry into the town of large numbers of dismounted and unarmed Irregulars. The regular force outside the town was withdrawn the same evening; the preventive orders, however, have ever since been strictly maintained, much to the satisfaction of the inhabitants, who enjoy thereby a degree of tranquillity and feeling of security to which they have long been strangers. I do not enter into further details, as Mr. Skene reports more circumstantially to your Excellency upon the whole affair. I consider it matter of great satisfaction that a measure which General Aeill, Mr. Skene, and myself so strongly urged upon General Beatson in the first instance, and which he so strongly opposed as being both impolitic and impracticable, has been carried into effect with such striking facility; and I am happy to add, with the entire concurrence of the majority of the troopers themselves. It is only to be regretted that General Beatson and his officers should have been exposed to the morti fication of seeing a measure forced upon the troops under their command which it was quite in their power to have effected themselves, and thus have obviated the many disagreeable and discreditable circumstances which followed. F. 'W. Calvert. Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, G.C.B. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.Dardanelles, September 21th, 1855. My Lord,—I have the honour to report to your Excellency that the measures for the prevention of carrying arms in town, announced in my joint dispatch with her Majesty’s Consul, on the 25th instant, were carried out yesterday. The chil and military Pashas were on the ground at an early hour with 500 infantry, 250 cavalry, 250 artillery, and 8 field-pieces. They formed a line round the town with advanced picket, and II.M.S. Oberon moored on their left, with her guns run out so as to command the road. Great excitement was perceived in the camp, officers and orderlies galloping about for some time, and then two squadrons of the Irregular Cavalry formed, and effected a reconnaissance, as if they expected to be attacked, although Major-General Beatson was in possession of the Pasha’s declaration, that his motive was merely to prevent the irregular troopers from entering the town with their arms, the Major-General having refused to give that order. This demonstration, to prove that the Pasha was in earnest, had the effect of deterring any of the Irregular Cavalry from attempting to enter the town until a few hours later, when several armed troopers presented themselves before the picket. They were informed that if they wished to enter the town they must come without arms. Many more troopers followed in this manner, and there were soon at least 200 of them walking about the streets perfectly quiet. The Pashas had explained to them personally their intention, and in reply the troopers stated that they had no sort of objection to coming into the town unarmed, and that their General had told them the Pashas wished to dis arm them altogether, and bade them not give up their arms; but that they had objected to fighting against the regulars, in whose ranks they had brothers and cousins, and had added that, if the General wished them to do so, they would all leave him and return to their homes. Whether these statements of the troopers be correct or not— and, if they are correct, there can be but one opinion of Major- General Beatsou’s conduct—it is certain that the Pasha’s object59 was attained with perfect facility, and without the most distant appearance of that opposition which the previous correspondence of the Major-General led one to expect. Seeing this favourable result, the Pasha sent a Major, with an interpreter, to inform General Beatson, that if he might infer, from the arrival of so many troopers without arms, that the desired order had been given, he would at once withdraw his troops. General Beatson refused to receive the Turkish Major, and stated, through the medium of a staff officer, that he would not communicate to the Pasha the nature of any orders which he might have given. The staff officer then • inquired if it was the intention of the Pasha to fire on troopers of the Irregular Cavalry who might attempt to enter the town with their arms, and the Turkish Major answered in the affirmative. Next followed a scene entailing ridicule and disgrace on the Queen’s commission, which is borne by some of those who took a part in it. There is in the Irregular Cavalry a certain Lieutenant-Colonel Giraud, a native of Smyrna, and formerly connected with a boarding-house kept by his mother in that town. This person, who speaks Turkish, had been the bearer of General Beatson’s refusal to order his men not to carry their arms in the streets, and on that occasion a discussion took place on military customs between him and the Turkish authorities. Lieutenant- Colonel Giraud said to Colonel Muhieddin Bey, who had given his opinion, that he did not talk like a military man; and the Bey replied that he had been five-and-twenty years in the regular service, while the Lieutenant-Colonel was merely a tradesman. The latter left the room, and reported that the word tradesman had been applied to General Beatson, who imme diately called on the Pasha to place Muhieddin Bey under arrest. The Pasha answered that he himself, besides four other witnesses, could attest that the obnoxious expression was not meant for the General, and that he would, therefore, not put the Bey under arrest. After this correspondence—which partakes so much of the character of idle gossip that I should feel almost ashamed to insert it in a despatch, were it not in explanation of the subse quent incident—five officers of the Irregular Cavalry rode up to the lines of the regulars, and were received by the Military60 Pasha and Muhieddin Bsy. They wore Lienlon^t-Colonel Giraud a Smyrniots of antecedents already speeded Colonel F Jet a Sicilian, whose principal duties are sanUo ^e teach I, a li a „ to General Bcatsons children. Major K.rall, a i unLan, who was a guitar-master, and, I regret to say, two British officers, Major Berkeley and Captain Burton, who so far Lot the respect due to the British name and military character as to associate themselves with such foreign adventurers in this most questionable transaction. They first comp ained collectevdy 'f the insult offered to their general; Muhieddin Bey explained that no insult had been offered to him. They would not listen to' reason; each and all of them then challenged him to mee them in single combat, and commencing with L.eutenant-Colo e Giraud, flung their five gloves on the ground, mounted their charges, and rode off, leaving the Turkish officers in a state o amazement at this apparent aberration of intellect, a, y charitably concluded from what had passed. The gloves were picked up by a servant and shown to Mr. Calvert and myse , with a request that we should throw .some light on the matter. Wo tried to explain it, and recommended that no notice should be taken of it. . In the evening the Pasha addressed a letter to ajor- General Beatson, stating that the object he had in view being realized he would withdraw his troops, but keep them in rca i- ness to oppose any attempts to renew the practice of carrying arms in the town, which had produced so many deplorable con sequences. The troops then returned to their barracks, and the affair has thus passed off without accident or other evil than the painful result that a corps in her Majesty’s service has, through the unqualifiable conduct of its commanding officer, been sub jected to the indignity of coercion on the part of a foreign force.

Write as soon as you can, communicating your plans, and if you are to be detained, and wish to communicate with Skene or Brigadier Y att icgarding the wants (I mean the more immediate wants) of the Irregulars, to enable you to endeavour to have them met by the influence of the Ambassadors—address either party by tele graphic message, provided that you be not delayed unnecessarily awaiting their reply. (Signed) R. J. II. Vivian. No. 6. July 2nd, 1856, Naseby Lodge, Welford. ^ rR &gt; I have the honour to return you the inclosed copies of correspondence relative to certain imputations on the conduct of Major-General Beatson, whilst in the command of the Osmanli Irregular Cavalry, upon which I beg to offer the following observations, for the information of Lord Panmure; and in explanation of the time which has elapsed since I received the inclosed papers from you, I beg to assure you that severe illness for the last week has alone prevented me from transmitting them to you sooner. 1. I believe the statement made in General Vivian's letter of the 5th of March, 1856, to be perfectly correct; and of the six officers commanding regiments who were present on the occasion referred to in the letter, five were, I believe, Colonels Brett,G6 Sankey, Morgan, ami O’Reilly, and Major Shelley, the sixth having been either Colonel Brennan or Major Kinalley. 2 It is unquestionable that Lieutenant-Colonel O Reilly and Maior Shelley left the room on that occasion, and shortly after wards waited on Major-General Smith, placing themselves and the regiments which they commanded at his disposal, and in so doing making some allusion to the extraordinary occurrences which were going on elsewhere. M, Skene (the Cm Com missioner) was present with General Smith when this internet took place, and can vouch for the correctness of the statement. The very fact of these two officers waiting on Major-General Smith, and tendering the offer of their services, proves that there was, at the least, some hesitation on the part of others in acknowledging his authority. Major Shelley distinctly repeated to me in Pera, on the 13th of February last, that though he could not recollect the exact words made use of, and which com pelled him to quit General Beatson’s room, yet that they weic of so mutinous a character, that he considered it his duty to leave. His words to me were, “ I considered it direct mutiny. Lieutenant-Colonel Sankey informed me that he and severa officers in the force told General Beatson they were ready to resign their commissions, but that they could not act in a man ner °which they considered would be unsoldierlike and improper ; to which General Beatson replied, that he did not wish them to make so great a sacrifice, nor to injure their own prospects, in order to prove their sympathy and adherence to his cause, understood this conversation to have had reference to some wish expressed by General Beatson that the officers should decline to acknowledge the authority of General Smith, or of General Vivian. , 3. I still have reason to believe, in reference to “ the round “ robin,' that it was drawn up and prepared by Monsieur Giraud, the principal interpreter, and 1 doubt not that Mr. Skene is able to corroborate this statement. 4. As regards the statement “ that the order, placing t ie “ Irregular Horse under command of General \ ivian, was kept « f rom the knowledge of the force until Major-General Smith u arrived at the Dardanelles,” I think the written statement of Lieutenant-Colonel O’Reilly, and the question asked by him onPRINTED BY COX &amp; WYMAN. GKKAT QL'KKN STREET. ± x tegular force, exec ' 1 . was aware of the existence of any such order up „ that day; and it was only when a discussion was raised, as to the legality of the order received rom General \ man, that, at the request of some of the officers to know the facts of the case, and their true position with refer ence to General Vivian, the order from Lord Panmure, plaoine t ie Irregular Cavalry under his command, and which had been received at the Dardanelles some considerable time-previously was produced and read.
