From Lieut.-Col. E. C. Ross, H. B.

L. Durand, s Assistant Resident, on the islands of Bahrain and its antiquities, accom panied by illustrative drawings. 2. I am not aware that the remarkable ancient necropolis, observed and described by Captain Durand, has been previously noticed either in official reports or other writings, and the mounds have^een excavated. The subject may, therefore, be one of considerable interest to the scientific public, and access to Captain Durand's report would no doubt be appreciated. 3. I have indeed already received a telegram to the effect that the Trustees of the British Museum are much interested in Captain Durand's researches, and have authorized an expenditure of one hundred pounds on further excavations. 4. If the notes are printed by direction of the Government, I shall be much obliged for a dozen spare copies. NOTES ON THE ISLANDS OP BAHRAIN AND ANTIQUITIES, BY CAPTAIN E. L. DURAND, 1 st ASSISTANT RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULP. 1. pescriptive. These Islands, from which the Portuguese were expelled by a British fleet, aiding Shah Abbass in 1622 A.D., and whose advantages were tersely put to me by a Native the other day in the words 'the island is silver and the sea is pearl,' are situated in latitude 26° and longitude 50° 51', the position of the Portuguese fort on the larger island being given as bearing latitude 26° 13' SS' 7 N. longitude 50° 31/ 45' E. 2. They are surrounded by shoal water on every side, which greatly adds to the beauty of the place. 3. On looking out to sea on the morning of a clear sky and a fresh nor- wester, it would seem as if nature, at all times lavish of effect, had here, however, exhausted every tint of living green in her paint box; and then wearying of the effort, had splashed an angry streak of purple into the fore ground. 4. The water itself is so clear, that you can see far down into the coral broken depths, and possesses springs of fresh water that bubble up through- the brine, both near the entrance of the harbour, and at several other places round the line of the coast. 5. Local historians maintain that in the time of Merwan, a Chief called Ibn Hakim, came from Katif, wishing to marry a lovely daughter of the Bahrain Chief. Titles, or money must, however, have been wanting, as the story goes that his proposals were treated with contempt. On this he began warlike operations by depriving the thirsty Bahrainees of their accustomed drink. He seized three wells, one at Ali, one in the Bilad-i-Kadim, and one close to Bahrain called Daraz. When these were filled in, the guardian deity of the island was good enough to make them break out in the places still marked by the springs opposite to Muharrak. The invader was eventually defeated, and retired to the mainland. 6.

The trade operations of these islands might be greatly extended under a settled Government; if for instance the British Government held them, they would draw the trade of the whole Persian Gulf and be a trade centie, from which Persia and Arabia would be supplied and drained. 12. I sav boldly that there would be no merchants left in any of the ports subject to Native rule in the whole of the Gulf from Basrah to Maskat, except the agents necessary for clearing the customs and passing on consignments inland. 13. A glance at the map will show that, with no labour to speak ot, a most excellent harbour could be brought up to the very doors of the ware-houses, which might be built on land reclaimed from the sea. 14.

During the present full moon and low tides I have seen the land dry to where the coral reefs sink abruptly into deep water. 15. Interior of the Islands. —The interior of the islands of Bahrain, and of the large one in particular, presents some every marked features. .16. Beginning at the centre and looking outwards, takingone's stand on the Jebel Dukhan or hill of smoke, the whole lies below in full view. Firstly, the hill itself, which seems to be of limestone and stands up some 400 feet above the sea level, looks as if it were the old crater of a volcano (if this could be) with an encircling ring of cliffs facing inwards some three or four miles off. Keally, however, I fancy that it would be more correct to say that a space of land all round the Jebel and contained in the circle of cliffs are of limestone, and present no appearance of course of volcanic action having taken place! Prom the outer crest of this ring of cliffs the land slopes more or less eraduallv down to the sea on all sides. 0 17.

Porster mentions that the Arabs consider these as well as others on the mainland to have their source in an under-ground river still running from the Euphrates, as he puts it, this is most clearly the Flumen per quod Euphratem emergere putant, mentioned in this quarter by Pliny. (It is not an uncommon thing in Persia to see wells sunk apparently in hopeless ground, and to find that they tap a small stream running under-ground.) 20. The principal springs are the Gassari on the road from Manameh to the Bilad-i-Kadim, the Umm-i-Shaoom, a mile to the eastward of Manameh, the Abu Geidan, in the Bilad-i-Kadim, and the Adari, which last supplies many miles of date-groves through a canal of ancient workmanship (whose stone in some places falling in) with a perfect river of fast I had some pearl divers with me who . , it j . • j went down and walked about on the running water some 10 feet broad by two m depth, bottom, they then looked like pigmies spring itself is some 30 to 35 feet deep, and rises so strongly that a diver is forced upwards on nearing the bottom. I do not mean that you cannot reach it, but merely that the force of the water is felt against you. 21. The water where it rises in this deep spring, whose basin artificially banked is some 22 yards across by 40 long, is as clear as crystal with a slightly green tint and very beautiful. It holds a shoal or two of large fish and many water tortoises. It is not perfectly sweet, and this applioo to nearly all the wells, the drinking water forconnoisseurs being brought on camels from the wells of the .. . ^Umm Koefih and *Hanaini, said to be 20 fathoms so aparTon the^top^of't^ci^ie of deep, in the hills of Rifaa. The water is conducted diffs - from these various wells by ordinary unbanked channels, the larger of which have now come to look like natural streams. Wherfe it is necessary to raise it this is done from wells by the ordinary skin bucket let down over a pulley and walked up to the cistern level by cattle pull ing down an incline; from channels generally by leverage of a datef trunk lightly swung by ropes to a frame, and balanced at one end by a basket of earth into which it is inserted, so that little exertion is required to lift up the water. 22. The Jebel Dukhan, as I said above, seems to be of a sort of limestone. I found some fossil shells upon it. The surrounding cliffs were, where I saw them, I think of sandstone; but they are generally limestone, and this stone was enormously quarried from here, I take it, to build the dead-houses under the tumuli. 23. On nearing the coast, white dusty ground, the cerecloth of dead races and habita tions, intrudes everywhere as if to enforce atten- , ,, , tion : and mighty t I append a sketch of one group _ r\f of these, probably the largest on the mounds + bare OL island. vegetation tower above the palm groves. The map gives a very slight idea of this most noticeable feature. Mass upon mass, mound upon mound, they stretch on in endless chains all round the slope that falls from the cliffs to the sea, clinging more particularly perhaps to the higher ground, but found in separate clusters near the coast itselt. 24. The parent group is perhaps that at Ali, a modem village, but F b 1 large ones are to be found at many places, noticeably See Ma p. those in the Bilad-i-Kadim : The red ones on the left of the high road to Eifaa, and the chain of five or six large ones facing ic 3 t Something like this- ' \TTiiiorfn nf Sirfihe which are only some out of very many grtprare?lCrfor less worthy of Notice.

On this subject an Arab from the mainland assured me that in one place, where they now quarry salt, the remains of old buildings and pillars are often seen. 26. Trees and Plants. —Foremost amongst the trees is of course the date, and some of the date-gardens are extremely fine. Many however are going and gone to ruinjthe result of bad Government, and indeed in some places that were once flourishing gardens not a bearing tree remains. 27. The almond with its broad and coloured leaves grows well, and is seen to great effect amongst the palm. 28. The citron grows well in a garden now under Sheikh Ahmed. I saw many acres of these trees all bending with such masses of golden fruit that they Some 20 inches and more in cireum. seemed scarcely able to bear the weight. These ference. were interspersed amongst palms, peach, and almond trees, and themselvoe werpi covered with snRntpd blossom as well as fruit. 29.

Almond. citron. £ air uei the margin, but perhaps not quite Fig. Peach. Apricot. * a full OUC. 31. The castor oil plant, that hardy invader of every Eastern soil, floiirishes here as elsewhere. 32. Lucerne grass is very largely cultivated and (with dates) is about the only food supply grown or used for the animals of this island. Were the least atten tion given to this branch of agriculture, almost every known vegetable could be produced here, as the climate is good for at least six months out of the twelve, and water is abundant. 33. Animals. —The list of animals is not a large one. Camels, horses, cows, and donkeys (with the inevitable Eastern dog) are to be found in different parts of the island. All these feed principally upon lucerue, supplemented with dates. 34. The camels are mostly from Arabia, though they are now bred here in the marshes. A few good ones for riding purposes are owned by the Sheikhs. These feed even when going at a sharp trot giviog the unaccustomed rider aii odd feeling of helplessness, as the long neck disappears in front and the head becomes mixed up with the animal's legs; this feeling is soon replaced by one of implicit confidence when you get accustomed to the acrobatic performance, and find that no harm comes of it. 35. The horses, all rejoicing in some high-sounding tribal or family name appear to me, with the exception of some old brood mares, to have been crossed with an inferior breed. They stand, unused and unclothed and uncared for in = n Wi r mthe S T e I llace ' aild eat their dates and lucerne con- tenteclly. Breeding is earned on from the most unsound and helpless crirmlps some of whom can barely stand from disease, and as the colts get little or no ip 6 ' re t , of tlle breeding arrangements cannot be very satisfactory. . lie Sheikhs are of course the only owners, and consider tbpir .w hapen cripples to be of enormous value. It is not worth while to unLS™ them, as no one in his senses would think of buying one. undeceive poor man to^cln kelp^r ^ ^ bUt the ^ is ^ - - those 3 LnJd w'tte Shetths 8 and , f 7 cd ', but are fe, L and far bet ^ now, except I have seen in Persia anVl and a few big men. They are not so fine as those ^ ' a m ucb higher price is asked for them. The ordinary5 little dwarf grey donkey who picks up a subsistence as best as he can round the villages is plentiful, and used, generally raw with sores, to carry date branches, Wood, &amp;c., to market in the towns. 39. Wild Animals. —The wild animals are few. The gazelle, the hare, and the mangoose, are all that I know of. 40. The Arab gazelle in its perfect and slender beauty of proportion, differs as much from the Persian or Mesopotamian as a thoroughbred does from a cart-horse. 41. Tbe hares are about the size of a three-quarter grown English rabbit, very small and blood-looking, with prominent eyes. This casty look is noticeable in every Arabian animal, man included. The Arab horse is well known, but the Arab greyhound of which a really good specimen is seldom obtainable, is a most beautiful animal, so light and slender as to seem useless for work, but when going, appearing rather to fly than gallop. These hares are easily tamed ; I had two, rescued from a hawk and a greyhound respectively, which after four days became so tame that they played about the room, hopping up occasionally to see what I was doing, and only retiring behind a box on the arrival of a stranger. 42. The mangoose runs about in broad day everywhere. 43. There are several sorts of fish in the fresh water. One with peculiar marking drew my attention. I have never seen him noticed. The dorsal fin is the centre of 3 circular or oval bands of dark colour, which show very plainly against the silver sides of the fish and present an odd effect when he swims. The largest I saw was only probably a few ounces in weight. It would almost seem as if he had caught the 'colour of his coat from swimming constantly in these shallow crystal waters shaded by the long thin spikes of date palm, but perhaps this is too Darwinian, as, although fish do constantly take, and even change their colour from the sort of water they live in, they would scarcely take their marking in this manner. 44 Jintiquarian, —I have already given a slight sketch of the individuality of these islands, if I may use the term, in connection with the lie of the ground and the certainty that is forced upon even the most superficial observer that he is standing upon no common soil, but on that of a land which, although now desolate enough has probably teemed with life, and under whose dust in all probability lies the history of countless generations ot his fellows. 45 i have mentioned the tumuli, which cover the island on all sides, from the coast to the centre or the cliffs of the central basin, and the grey dust land, which crops out everywhere barren, between the date-groves, and tells i s own tale. 46. I will i ust take one glance at what is known of the earliest historic days of the race that peopled these islands, and then give a brief account of what three weeks of constant research have disclosed, leaving it for others, n ho know more about these matters than I do to judge whether my conclusions are right 47 S We know that probably amongst other matters, these islands have been ruled bv Phoenicians, Babylonians (?), Persians, Arabs, and Portuguese. With L former Herodotus savs that 'the Phoenicians first dwelt upon the legaic , m : gTa ted to the Mediterranean when, &amp;c.,' and again Erythrean fee , h. ^ „ o - „ that Xerxes paraded for the conquest of liter on in. us acc pf 3 f]^ Phoenicians of Sidon had won the Greece, after h ^yi rl ^ i l ^ f 10 ^ t monarc h's marble throne on Abydos, that regatta held at the foot ation dw elt anciently upon the Erythrean 'according to their own aoco , the Coast of Syria, where 5 Mr SawLm-. .. ....of these statements, lie says that the question commonly discussed has been whether the cities about the Persian Gulf are the mother c.t.es of those on the Mediterranean, or colonies from them. Seetzen and lletitn incline to the latter view, but in favor of the former ho notes ^ _ d't The double tradition, viz., that of Herodotus, of the Phoenicians, o Phoenicia Proper, and that of the inhabitants of Tyrus and Aradus recorded by Erastosthenes, who probably followed Androsthenes, the Iva\al Officer of Alexander. 4 (II) What may be called the argument for general probability. Both arguments would seem to be very strong ones, particularly that of the double tradition, for we know how jealously such race vouchers are handed down Irom father to'son amongst Eastern nations, and it seems more probable that the Phoenicians should have been influenced by the law of the Semitic drift to the westward than that they should have been fighting against the tide. Mr. Hawlinson, however, remarks that the temples seen by Androsthenes (at Bahrain) may have been built when the Phoenicians formed settlements in the time of their prosperity. A 48. Without offering an opinion that I am unqualified to give, I would draw attention to Mr. Rawlinson's more elaborate essay Essay ii, Vol. vii . the same subject, which, leaving the origin of the tradition of a Phoenician emigration still doubtful in so far as it might really have related to an early Hamitic movement, which he does not dispute, lays down that the Phoenician, like other Semitic races in these parts, did emigrate from Babylonia, the primitive seat and home of Semitism, but he apparently objects to Strabo's cradling them specially in Bahrain, and to the more elabo rately worked out story of Tro^us Pompeius, giving the reasons of their move ment and the road they took, nv 49. It will however scarcely be called in question that these islands of Bahrain were in old days inhabited by a Phoenician race, and that they had here temples to their gods actually seen by Androsthenes, when he led the naval expedition under orders from the Macedonian boy conqueror. 50. Interested in these matters as every one must be, whose good or evil for tunes lead them to these classic lands, I have taken every opportunity of going about the island, cross-examining the people, and looking for anythin 01 that might be old enough to bear upon such questions. 51. My first visit to the Sheikh resulted in an immediate call for horses and a ride out on Muharrak to the date-groves of Siniabi, where the Chief said they had lately come upon an old well. 52. The sand hills on this side of the island evidently cover old buildings,* and * i have since heard from Abdullah bin Rijjab, one ^ ie ' We ^ bad been found was either of a rich firm of brothers, engaged in the pearl trade, a Stone COnduit with CrOSS branollPS or H ip tliat when he was a boy he remembers seeing the fonnrllfinrxi r»f cnmo /-lUl 'U *1 i* officers of a French and an English frigate accompa- nClatlOnS 01 SOlBe Oul stone building, nied by a Persian (Ailchi) Ambassador digging and SOme six Or SOVCU feet below the SlirfflPP turning over stones in this very place.

These I did not copy. , ^ ^ after having visited 20 mosques at least, which produced nothing buta cup of coffee, a kallian, and innumerable complaints of the tyranny of the Sheikhs and their tribe, I was told of a stone that nobody could read. This therefore I went to see and found it em bedded in the ' holv of holies' %&gt; in the Madrasseh-i-Daood, in the Bilad-i-Kadim. In the margin is a life size transcript of the inscription. The stone 'f itself is of black basalt (?) shaped like the prow of a boat, or an animal's tongue, and has the dimensions noted in th6 margin. I had no difficulty in getting it, in spite of its holy situation, telling the Moollahs simply that it was a fire-wor shipper's stone, probably an idol, and so had no business where it was. To back my argument I gave a few rupees to repair the mosque and the loss was made up to them. Sheikh Ahmed sent a slave who dug it out and carried it home for me. I thought at first that it might be the prow or figure-head of some old ship, and I suppose this is possible. At any rate, however, we know- that the Phoenicians above all worshipped the Phallus, and that the goddess „ T ^ * cm „ Astarte, their particular favorite and the • In which capacity she appears on coins of Sidon, * n • i • i Gaza, and Aradus'standing on the prow of a boat. protCCtrCSS 01 mariners. Was Worshipped (Rawiinson.) them under the form of a conical stone. Whether under this form she was eveif let into the prows of their ships I cannot say ; as a figure-head I believe that her image was so used. This, however, is a mere speculation, the writing will probably tell its own tal^t 55. Here again is a puzzle to any but an adept. Some of the characters are v .

This again is a mere surmise. At any rate it is not of the real Phoenician type that CadmusJ taught the Greeks, t riin y- and from which their alphabet emanated, as the Phoenicians were supposed to have known this writing loOO yoais 13.G. 56. Mr. Rawlinson would, I think, make Cadmus merely a mythical per sonage, under the form of Kedem,§ the East seeking § He gives the Hebrew spelling. j] re b the West, or Europe, but still he admits the cumulative force of the argumentsf that he enumer- T Note i, Book II, Chapter 49. ates ^ as ver y towards the proof of a Phoenician settlement in Boeotia. w 2 feet and 2 inches long.57 Qoia' further than he does* Mr. Porster says 'that this name of Cadmus 0 can be traced through Kademah or Kadmas, ' hich « Parti, Section vi. latter form, he states, to be a truly Arabic idiomatic one. and quotes it, through Melo. through Eusebius, and Alexander Polyhistor who gives the twelve sons of Abraham (Ishmael) by Passing the allusion to Herodotus. ^. g ^ T gp^ ari wife, and again that the only 'direct notice of the Arabs as among the early peoplers of Europe to be found among the classic writers occurs in Strabo, ' who in his account of the peop mg o Euboea off the coast of Boeotia reckons as the first inhabitants a colony 01 Arabs, who had accompanied Cadmus into Greece.' This statement carries within itself marks of its authenticity, since all the circumstances 01 the case attest the correctness of Strabo's information, &amp;c., &amp;c. ^ lie then continues, that Cadmus is simply the Greek form of Kedemah, w r hich is rendered Kedinah in the LXX, and Cadmos by Josephius, and the Ishmaelite tribe of Kedemah, we have already seen, waS seated in the very locality assigned on independent grounds as the cradle of the Phoenician Cadmus, the namesake, and it may justly be inferred the youngest son of Ishmael. 58. He further goes on to clench his argument with an Arab tradition, also proving the national consanguinity between the Peleponesians and Boeotians and the Arabs (Zebeydi Ishmaelites). 59. To return, however, without being sure that Cyrus ruled these islands, we know that Darius did as they formed a part of his 14th satrapy, and were used by him as a penal settlement (the jockey King could scarcely have invent ed a better). - 60. The stone may therefore well belong to this period of Persian rule, or again it may simply have found its way dowai from Assyria. The latter being the most likely, for the cuneiform seems to me to differ from the Achsemenian that I have seen, and the more so that no signs are used under that form of writing. Of course an expert would settle the question at once.f 61. With regard to the tumuli, we are standing on surer ground and cannot .go far wrong. Whether some of these may not be the remains of the Phoenician temples noticed by Androsthenes it would be hard to say. Without doubt those nearest to the village of Ali have had buildings on the top of them formed of shaped blocks of sandstone. I cannot mention all the places on these islands which probably contain buried buildings, but content myself with drawing attention to one or two of the most prominent. 62. On leaving the town of Manameh, the western road passing through lines (^f date gardens, lands one in the Willayet-i-Kadim or Bilad-i-Kadim the ancient city, where, probably from time immemorial, building has been piled upon building; be this how it may, we go a little further and find ourselves near t Madresseh-i-Abu-Zeidan already the mosque of the minarets.f Here several mounds ^r k r; d r^ t k ' dm ' rt [ isin .s white and shrubless attract attention, but w , . xi -n , leaving these again and inclining to the north of to its rr g Portu g u ese fort on the sea-board still massive and imposin- no Lrn L ' lme f 0f h 'r h Sandl ' i118 ' cllaiued to g ethe '- ^4 tbo rthun sea, at the distance of a mile or so from the beach near the vilhcpc of Barboora and Slurebi.

One square cut hole, as if for the jamb of a large door, was obvious, as also two channels square cut on * i give here a very rough diagram the same face. I regret that I took at the time rom memory^ scant notice of this,* it is only deductively, after seeing other mounds and going over half the island, that I have teen led to attach importance to these particular mounds, and from the fact, firstly, of their size, and, secondly, of their position in line facing the se£, and from the further fact also that there are no mounds of lesser proportions near them. 63. Leaving these, however, and retracing our steps to the Bilad-i-Kadim, I would start again from thence. 64. Again, we pass through date groves, and find ourselves almost imme diately on a broad road entirely devoid oi a single blade of grass, and appearing to be raised an inch or two above the surrounding soil, which bears a few scattered shrubs. This, I am sure, for part of its length was at one time a made road, whether paved or not, probably not. [t seems to have been laid down with some sort of clay, as it becomes as hard as stone in the dry, and like ice in the wet weather. It has a pink tinge in places, and of course may be only earth impregnated with saltpetre which has gained its present apparent character of a once made road, by the constant passage of traffic; there is not, however, enough of this latter at the present day between ' Ali' and Manameh to beat out a sheep track. 65. This village of ' Ali,' where tie road lands us in a small tumbled-down village, inhabited by Shiahs, is built of and over old habitations, aad immediately outside' of it there is a most singular group of mounds, to which I would draw attention. Of these I append a rough clalk sketch. They number about 25 to 30, some larger, some smaller, but all being of a size to ensure notice. I had no'means of measuring them, but roughly the biggest are from 40 to 50 feet hio-h and from 40 to 50 yards through their broadest base; they are somewhat furrowed by the weather, not much so, retaining a strong family likeness to one another, particularly in the squareness of their tops, which are often indented; are bare and close together, which facts (in spite of the enormous blocks of'shaped sandstone cropping out near and on the top of some and the e-allerv in one of them, also near the summit) made me doubt the correctness of mv first coniecture that they must be temples, and which would have urged their classification as tombs. Still as they were the only distmctly shaped rnminds of their size that I had examined (at close quarters), whilst from immediately behind them stretched chain upon chain and group upon group oTTesser tumuli, which can be nothing tut graves I clung to the hope that thisTarse group might be something more. I had written some weeks ago in fn these « This large series of mounds packed together, and of regular shanes cannot be the ruins of houses, as asserted by the Arabs tombs rounded shap^, cannot tbe more probable, I think, from simply they mus^be,^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ f the ' ' j .

If these miles upon miles of crowded heaps are tombs, where did the inhabitants In e ? The first ans, ^ r ^ i jj' built hh®^ ho^e of the hrc^ches69. Secondly, and this I think a more probable answer to the question, or at any rate one worthy of consideratioi^ that these islands were the cemetery of Gerrha, which was the great Phoenician mart in these parts, and which is believed to have lain at the bottom of the long bay behind Bahrain. 70. Causes, such as their fertility, their temples (?), their abundance in most beautiful water, may have caused these islands to have been regarded as holy ground. } 71. Even at the present day the Bindoos look to be taken to the bosom of the Ganges, or the devout Mahomedan of these parts to be lain in the holy dust of Kerbela. May not some ancient tribe of Phoenicians on the mainland have looked to sleep their long sleep in the hallowed dust of these sacred islands ? This may seem a far-fetched idea, but the vastness of the series of mounds must be my excuse. I have not heard of sich another necropolis above ground in the world. 72. With regard to the distance as likely to negative this idea, compare the distances that the tribe of Royal Scytlians are said to have carried their Kings before they laid them finally to rest in their appointed places of sepulture on the Borysthenes in the land of the Gerrhi. 73. The Thracians or Goths buried under tumuli, the Scythians, Lydians, See chapter 7i, Book iv, Eawiin- an d Libyans also, and indeed the custom appears to LTon^e''IS. 1 ! tie ° oba **'' 1 T la \' e beei1 vei T generally adopted by the wandering Indo-European populations of the earth. 74. ith regard to the bones of animals found,* compare the Scythian » Eeiated below. customs.

The Chaldeans are, however, supposed to have had a Scvthic or luranian origin, and a large library and much study would be necessary before judging of the reliability of such derivations. 82. Is it possible that the forms of burial of different races were distinct enough to give some clue, and that further researches amongst the wilderness of tombs in good preservation here may throw some light into a dark paffe of history ? 83. I noticed above the Scythic customs of burial and transport of the dead to the land of the Gerrhi, to the point at which the Borysthenes becomes navigable. 84. Is it possible that there should be any ethnic affinity, to account for the likeness of names between Gerrhus and Gerrha, or is it one of those mere resemblances which are so common and unreliable ? 85. Granting however that Gerrha was near here, what more likely than that these islands might have been used in the manner suggested above ? 86. I have been told by Arabs that there are many large ruins on the main land, and one man in particular told me that they found traces of building, stone, and pillars at a place where salt is quarried. The bottom of the Gulf behind Bahrain has, I believe, never been carefully explored. 87. To return however to the mounds at Ali. On my first arrival I went over and round many of the bigger ones, and at last my perseverance was rewarded by finding an entrance into one of these (under a flat stone near the summit) through which, lying down, we were just able to creep, and on getting beyond the opening we found ourselves in a long passage or gallery, which was however blocked with fallen masonry a few yards in front of us. 88. The roof of this passage is formed by transvere blocks of flat stone, laid from wall to wall, about six feet in breadth, the width of the passage being somewhat less. 89. The walls, where still intact, were covered with a coarse grained hard plaster, and where broken showed their enormous thickness of large stones, welded together in the same rough plaster building. 90. Prom the general form of these greater mounds I should think they had been pillared circular edifices with slightly domed or flat roofs. I saw no trace of carving on any of the blocks of stone lying about on these mounds. All that were so exposed were of huge size, and I think most are of a species of hard sand-stone, of limestone at any rate; though every block bore evidence .of having been shaped, they were so worn by age, that no writing, however deep, could have remained. 91. No doubt as time wore on the inhabitants have made use of these mounds as quarries, which may partly account for the bare appearance of many of them) where no stone is left on the surface. The stones that were buried, t In regard to this see his KhSldTSte populations. He says ^rlfaphM^^^ 869 above.)however, may have fared better than their exposed comrades, and I have some hope of finding out more about these buildings before leaving the islands. 92. With regard to the positions of the mounds themselves, I could see no trace of any unity of design in the grouping, except perhaps in one place, where four corner mounds seem to be connected by a wall, and where in the centre of the so formed quadrangle appears a mound of indefinite shape, smaller but of course analogical to the rest. 93. If I have time, I shall devote a few days to further exploration and research. 94. I wrote the above some weeks ago, and have let it stand as it fairly describes the look of the mounds and the conclusions (wrong in part) that I drew at the time. 95. Since writ ing it I have opened a small mound to the westward of the f large group, and have begun upon a larger one. Of the latter I will give an account later on. This small one is one of many hundreds that lie grouped together. It appears to be simply a single tomb, though oddlv chambered. 3 8' T i » I K c 3'. - L £? 3'S' —* h ♦ I 96.

Hie walls of the tomb were of rough hewn stone and unmortared, so that dust had drifted into the chambers, sifting in between the stones and cover ing most part of the floor to a depth of several inches. 100. I opened from the eastward and came upon the central passage lying about east and west, a tact that I have since utilized in beginning my work on the larger mound. 101. On carrying away the earth we found no entrance, but made one by removing large blocks of stone, luckily in the very centre of the big passage. From here we had to step down about three feet six inches. 102. ^ On creeping in under the huge slab above us I was sickened by a smell, which I cannot describe, and being new to the trade of body-snatching was assailed by some qualms of conscience as to the propriety of my conduct. On reflection, however, I came to the conclusion that the golden rule of life was, &lt;c do unto others, &amp;c.' Applying this practically, and putting myself in the place of the defunct Phoenician, I thought that if I could think, under the circumstances, I should probably not mind being disturbed after being shut up for some thousands of years. So I went in bravely, ' ce n'est que le premier pas,' and since then I have become hardened and keep several of the gentle men's bones in a basket in my room. I was however disturbed, not to say distressed, at hearing them begin to rattle in the dark, but found on timid in spection that the noise proceeded from the intelligent researches of a very nice bull pup that I have. I remonstrated with him, as I thought that he might have drawn the line at such very innutritive substances, but the matter gave food for further reflection. I thought that such a subject might almost have supplied Montaigne with a text for one of his humorous philosophical essays, and that treated by Artemus Ward or Mark Twain, the Castor and Pollux of modern wit and humour, it might almost become ludicrous, ileverting, however, to my previous argument, I returned to bed. 103. However we went in, as I said, to the tomb, and found in the first compartment to the right (and north) the skull and bones of a man. Unfortu nately a slight shake was given to the basket after I had placed it carefully on one side, and the skull, though propped in dust, fell to pieces. Judging by the thigh bones the man could not have stood much, if at all, over five feet nine inches. 104. The skull seemed a very small one, specially low in the forehead, with a o-ood development of the orbital ridge, narrow and more developed in length than in breadth, but even here, a small skull. It lay between the thigh bones, one of which was broken, as I had to use some (very little) force to break the other for packing, and there were no stones fallen into this part of the grave it is odd This position of the skull, however, in conjunction with the lowness of Arccgst others H CT »dot„ s the chamber, and its want of depth, would seem to that this was a Libyian practice. show that the corpse was buried in a sitting posture. This I believe was a common practice with many tribes. 105 In the small compartment facing the first, we found the bones of some email animal, prohahly a gazelle or a sheep, and some remains of a rather delicate clav drinking vessel, whilst scattered here in the dust of the central passage a int of small shapeless pieces of oxidized metal, brass or copper, and some fragments of a vessel of coarse red earthenware. An intelligent Native remarked to me that these could no longer be made, as the colour of the earth phmo-ed he had found old bits before and always red, but now they can on y make' dirty white and light yellow. I suggested that age in the pots themselves mi^ht account for the change of colour, but he would not consent to the pro- position. 106. In foe western and corresponding side chambers, both partially block ed with one or two large stones, nothing was found, except dust and a few 13laminated bones. These came out of the south-western chamber, but with them there was no skull or recognizably human bones. 107 Here and there scattered amongst the dust throughout the tomb were nieces of'what appeared to me to have been once ivory or wood : these were found on sifting the baskets of dust which came out when the tomb was being laid bare to the stones of the foundation. 108. I have retained specimens of all these things by me, in case they should turn out to be of any interest. 109. The only thing that at all struck me after examination of the tomb was the scattering of the bones and the breakage of crockery. Could the animal or animals, whatever they were, have been inhumed alive when the burrow was closed up ? 110. April Qth, 1879.—I can now give some account of the mounds that I have been engaged upon since I wrote the above. larger 111. In the first place I chose the most perfect looking of the large tumuli, Its present height is about 45 feet, circumference 200 paces, and the circular mound around it 330 paces, 20 paces of level ground separate this latter circle from the base of the mound, a line of wall joins the outer circle to the base of the mound. I cannot from it explain the plan of the large mound near the top of which I found the gallery. The two must be essentially different. 112. After losing a day or two in making pickaxes* in the bazaar, which * There are only two agricultural tools known in tools Were necessary to Cut away the hard the island, the iron crow bar with one end chisel amalgam of earth and flint, which had be- shaped, and a single handed mud scraper. n i - iiij , &gt; , ^ come very firmly welded together, we began work, and began at the top and centre to see if by working there we could disclose anything. 113. The shape of the mound in its then state, I give roughly in the margin. 114. I made use of my detachment of the 21st Kative Infantry working them in relays of a few men for a few hours, keeping them out in camp and of mischief. A cheerier more willing lot of men, especially when sheep were forth coming I never saw. They worked and joked, and had not an hour's sickness amongst them during the whole time we were out.

Thinking and hoping that from its size, as well as misled by tlie other one, that I had slightly ^een into, the mound might cover the ruins of a small circular temple, ail{ i not those of a tomb, we began work at the top and centre cutting, down several yards deep steps.* 116. Finding how ever nothing but a ring of large stones, I left the top and began work again a few feet above the base, running a cut- _ _ „ into the mound and ^irjtaking care to retain the same line east and west guided by my previous experience of the lie of the smaller tomb, and also by having remarked a depression or shallow channel from the top to the bottom of the mound in this direction. Here on going in a few feet our pro gress was blocked by enormous stones which appeared, on removal, to form part of a cyclopeian circular containing wall. One of these blocks of lime stone, which we had to break up with the crow bars to remove, measured roughly over six feet long, by three feet six broad, by eighteen inches deep. 117. The height of this wall above the ground level of my tunnel was about seven or eight feet, which would make it at least 10 feet high from the level of the ground. The blocks used were of rough hewn limestone,f unequal in size and unmortared. 118. On breaking through the wall I almost at once found myself in a passage or gallery, about six feet broad, and gradually narrowing (as I found afterwards) to five feet three inches at the inner end. 119. The walls on either side were of rough, unmortared, and carelessly fitted limestones varying in size, and sloped pyramidally upwards from the encircling wall of blocks, and also slightly outwards from their base. 120. I picked my way along between these containing walls, removing the earth as I went, as also blowing down the mass of hard flint limestone, and con crete soil from above us, thus gradually filling up the passage behind us as we proceeded. 121 This increased the labor enormously, and was I believe unnecessary from the compactness of the mass, the relative small size of our gallery, and the outward slope of the walls, which gave a good sound thrust to the arch we left over us • hut not being an engineer I could not risk it, and once having blown in a portion of our roof, it was ipso facto necessary to continue to do so, as the earth was thoroughly loosened and weakened by the shock of this first explosion. The necessity however might have become more apparent when we came to the inner wall, for here gunpowder had to be used. 122 I append a sketch of this that may give some idea of the massive charac ter of the work, taken however after the picks had been well worked on it thiough S &amp;c We had not recognized at first that we were attacking a stent wall. 15 f Some of the outlying blocks on the other large mounds (already noticed) are of sandstone, and have been carefully shaped, perhaps the architects were equal to shaping sandstone, but not to shaping the harder limestone, or at any rate did not think that it was worth while to do so.123. This second barrier blocked the entrance to the tomb itself at a distance of thirty feet six inches from the first circular wall of h oc s. 124 On nearing this inner wall we found the passage on either side to be n ' foTwi nml where the well welded barrier forbade access, the wall rSeHide had two coats, one of rough and the other of smooth mortar. The latter underlying the former, which still here bore the marks of the plas terer's finger smears. The under-coat was of different material, and so smooth and hard that we had to use our picks to remove it. 125. The transverse wall of cemented blocks had been built in after the side-walls had been finished. We blew this out. 126 From the platform* on which these blocks were placed, a drop of three * Regularly built of big flat stones feet six inches brought us to the smooth and mortared cemented together. floor of the tomb; here we turned up, amongst the stones and rubble masonry, a large amount of charcoal in such big pieces, that I take it the roof must have been at one time supported by date tree trunks, which have become charcoal from age and pressure. Some pieces of a thinner character present the appearance of bamboo-matting charcoaled. I have kept specimens of these things. 127. The mortar itself used in laying the blocks had a layer of damp (?)t palm leaves laid as well above as below it in several places; for we found thin layers of charcoal, which could not well have been anything else in such positions. 128. On the right and left of the passage were two shelves on either side, the lowest of which at any rate was carefully lined with mortar, but held nothing but yellow dust, with which they were filled up. These were four feet long by seven inches of aperture, by eight in depth, and a height of six feet nine from the ground or platform. There is nothing to show to what use these can have been put. 129. On descending from the platform (the end of the passage) the walls carefully mortared still continued right and left for three feet two inches, and then turned at right angles forming small mortuary chambers of the same shape as those in the lesser tomb previously described. 130. No doubt, also, they have their counterparts at the other end of the central passage, and in one of these no doubt also are to be found the remains of e person entombed, as it was in the north eastern chamber of the small tomb that I found the skeleton as previously related.
