Merewether also comments on recent proposals around the future management of the Murree and Boogtee tribes as well as his recommendation that Government relations with these tribes should not be handled directly but should go through the Political Agent at Khelat. The letter also outlines Colonel Phayre's proposals for the enacting of suggestions from the Punjaub Government on the protection of the frontier, and Merewether's disagreement with these proposals, giving reasons, and his alternative plan for taking these suggestions forward by using the local tribes to provide defensive forces for the frontier, along with details of costings for such a plan.The letter concludes by noting that the current sum of 50,000 rupees per annum which the British Government pays to the Khan under the terms of their treaty does not actually re-imburse him for the duties lost from leveies on merchants passing through his territory and that a further sum of 44,000 rupees per annum should be granted to aid the Khan in acting on his engagements in regards to cattle-lifting and intertribal quarrels.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000008#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
