I raised the question of price and was told that for aircraft prepared to a standard suitable for use by the R.A.F. a figure of £2,000 wuld be asked.

A request has now been received from the Afghan Government for the supply of 12 Spitfire VIII's subject to trials in Kabul with one sample aircraft. This request has been the subject of a telegram from the Government of India to the India Office, and both the latter and the Foreign Office are most anxious-Jfnat the aircrait in question should be supplied to Afghanistan. 3. Instructions have already been issued by the air Pinistry to provide one sample aircraft for trials in Kabul. The Committee are invited (i) 1o note that in view of the representation made by o.i.e India Oil ice and the Foreign Office one sample Spitfire VIII is being sent to Afghanistan. (ii) To decide whether or not a total of 12 Spitfire VIII's are to be allocated to Afghanistan, and from what source. 5. A further request for the provision of 12 Avro XIX’s for the Afghan Government has been received through the Foreign Office. i.his question has already been discussed at a meeting between the Air Finistry, Ministry of Supply, Foreign Office and India Office on Tuesday 2nd June, and tne Committee is invited to consider any recommendations which may be put forward as a result of this meeting. 29th June, 19A6. f g o ~ Ha **** G. 121062.SECRET D.E.A.F.

( Note by Air Vico Marshal Fhitworth-Joncs. ) &lt; • In the diocusoions at the last liieoting ol tho Committee concerning preparation of aircraft in the Middle East, I intimated that, as a result of tho changing political situation in India and the need to divert -R.A.F, manpower to matters of higher priority, it scorned extremely unlikely that the 158 Spitfire VIII aircral’t notified to the Committee some months ago as being available for sales abroad, could now be prepared for that purpose. 2. The situation has now boon reviewed in detail and Air Headquarters, India has boon consulted. It has been ascertained that:- (a) the aircraft are now in a very poor state of repair as a result of being stored for months in the open'in a tropical climate, with a minimum of maintenance due to the acute manpower shortage, and the doubtful availability of Indian technical labour to assist in meeting British commitments. (b) all maintenance on aircraft for sales overseas has now- had to be abandoned. (c) the R.A.F. manpower rundown has of necessity been very rapid to accord with the Defence Committee's directions, (d) all available manpower must now be applied to most urgent current commitments and preparations for an emergency -which may arise at any time as a result of the present political situation. (e) ferry pilots arc not now available in India for the delivery of the aircraft to Turkey or elsewhere, nor is there labour or timber available for the stripping and and packing of the aircraft for sea transportation.wm wrnm 3 . In viov; of the abovo considerations the Corjirattoc are advised that it is no longer possible to rely on the Far nast Zone as a source of provision of aircraft for sales aoroaa. It is proposed therefore that Air Ministry shall now inforia A.H.Q, R.A.f/ India that they will no longer be required to make aircraA^ fit for sale to Foreign customers. A. It is suggested that the tentative commitment for 198 Spitfires to Turkey could be met by the oiler of 40 Spitiire /III s from the Middle East theatre and 158 Spitfire El’s from this country. D.G.O.
