PROOF. (Received 19th May, 1936.) My dear Parkinson, The Residency, Aden, 5th May, 1936. As it has been proposed that I should go to England this summer to discuss with the India Office and the Colonial Office details connected with the transfer of Aden, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were discussed at a meeting at the Foreign Office in 1933, and adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. I also enclose a copy of a Draft Estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending copies of my note and of the draft estimate to the India Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours, &amp;c., B. R. REILLY. Enclosure in No. Note on Fourteen Points connected with the Transfer of Aden from the Government of India to the Colonial Office discussed at the Foreign Office in 1933, AND ON CERTAIN OTHER POINTS CONNECTED WITH THE SAME QUESTION.

The printing of stamps for Aden will in future presumably be arranged by the Colonial Office, and the cost debited to Aden, and it will be of interest to know what the annual expenditure on this account is likely to be. With regard to telephones, it will be seen from the Government of India letter that I have quoted that approximately a sum of Rs. 1,63,200 was spent in 1932-33 by the Indian Posts and lelegraphs Department on the work of remodelling the system, including the capital expenditure on buildings. It must be decided whether this sum is to be paid to the Government of India by His Majesty's Government or by the new Aden Administration. It appears to me undesirable that the new Colony should commence its existence burdened by a debt of this nature, and I hope therefore that the payment can be made by His Majesty’s Government. In this connexion I wish to refer to Point 14 in the minutes of the meeting held at the Foreign Office in 1933, which recorded my suggestion that all Government buildings at Aden should be transferred free of cost by the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government (and by the latter to the new Aden Government). If this principle is accepted, the Government of India’s expenditure on telephone buildings should be excluded from the sum to be paid to them for the telephone system. A reduction should also be made on account of depreciation of the system during the years since it was installed. At present, both the Aden Post Office and the Aden Telephones are directly but separately under the control of the Postmaster-General, Bombay, who sends to Aden a Postmaster and an Officer in Charge of Telephones. Neither of these officials is in any way subordinate to the other; their work is conducted independently of each other in Aden, although they are both under the same control in India. After the transfer, it would probably be necessary that both Posts and Telephones should be placed under the combined control of an officer responsible to the new Government, and that there should therefore be an Officer in Charge of Aden Posts and Telephones. I suggest that this officer be obtained on deputation from the Government of India, unless the Colonial Office can supply him. A tentative provision for the cost of his appointment has been made in the Draft Estimates. An alternative that has been suggested to me is that the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department should continue to work the Aden Post Offices and Telephones for a few years after the transfer, as I understand was done in the case of the ‘Iraq Post Offices. If the administration of the Postal and Telephone Departments is taken over by the new Aden Government, it is probable that additional staff will be necessary in the Post Office for maintaining Exchange accounts, and in the Telephone Department for billing and accounting, work which at present is done in Bombay; and with the appointment of a Director of Posts and Telephones it will still be necessary to have two subordinate officers in separate charge of each of the Departments under the Director. The retention of control by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department would obviate the necessity for additional expenditure of this nature. I do not, however, know whether the Indian Department would be prepared to manage the Aden Post Offices and Telephones on behalf of the Aden Government, or, if so, on what terms they would be willing to do so. I suggest, however, that this possibility be examined by the Colonial Office, and that, if there is no objection to it in principle, it should be discussed with the Government of India. Point 3. Printing and Sale of Stamps .—I have referred to this question under Point 2. Indian postage rates are at present in force in Aden; that is to say, the minimum charge for ordinary letters is (1) One anna to any place in India, (2) 2| annas to the United Kingdom and all the British possessions participating in the British Imperial postage scheme and (3) 3£ annas to any other part of the world served by foreign post except Ceylon and Portuguese India. I consider that these Indian rates should be continued, at any rate for a time, if this is possible under Colonial administra tion. An exception may be the rate to India. If the Government of India decide to raise the postage from India to Aden from the first to the second category, it may be necessary for the Aden Government similarly to raise the rate from Aden to India. This change would be unpopular in Aden, especially with the Indian community, many of whom have a large business correspondence with India. It will be more satisfactory if the present postal rates between India and Aden could be preserved by special agreement, and I recommend that the possibility of making an arrangement to this effect be examined. Point 4. Mail Contract .—It was agreed at the meeting held in 1933 that the India Office should ascertain whether mail steamers must call at Aden under the terms of their contract with the Government of India, and it was proposed that the existing arrange ment should, if the Government of India agree, remain unchanged, at any rate for the (C21513) B*4 * 1 r i.u r^.^rnmpnt of India’s present mail contract. I do not balance of the period of the matter since the 1933 meeting, but I hope know what has been don ® w ' s p rop osed. Details should also be obtained regard- that an arrangement ean be P conveyance of mails to other ^ — o£ maik dropped at Aden for transhipment. Point 5 Currency --It was agreed at the 1933 meeting that Aden should continue Point o. Currency. f a a re ement of the Government of India, to use Indian currency and hat, subjecUo the^greeme ^ India ( do not knZ g Xtter an^ further action has been taken on this subject, but I recommend that the Government of India's consent be obtained to the arrangement propose . Point ti. Treasury and Finance.— 1 understand that it is th ? r i n niPQ for the budget to be brought forward annually by a Chief, or Colonial, Secretary This apStment does notCist in Aden at present, and will not exist unless the Administration ^reorganized on a Colonial model. I have therefore proposed he appointment of a Treasurer, and I understand that this suggestion was accepted at the 1933 meeting 0 At that meeting, Mr. Cowell said that he would enquire of the Personnel Division of die Colonial Office as to the probable rate of pay it would be necessary to offer If the transfer of Aden is to take place in the early part of next year, I consider that the selection of a Treasurer should be made as soon as possible, to enable him to take up his duties immediately on Aden becoming a Colony. I further suggest that th officer selected be sent to Aden on special duty some months pnoi to the transfer to study the financial position of the new Colony and to assist in the preparation of its first budget. With regard to the latter, I shall make some further remarks later in this note. I have suggested that the Treasurer should be in charge of the Income lax and Salt and Excise Departments as well as of the Treasury. This would place him in control of all the Government Revenue and Expenditure Departments of the Colony and might involve some rearrangement in the existing superior posts of these Departments. 1 he duties of Treasury Officer and of Collector of Salt and Excise are at present pei formed by the Extra Assistant Commissioner, an officer on Rs. 500-50-750 a month, who also performs magisterial and administrative duties. Both he and the Income lax Officer are now nearing their time of retirement. I suggest that the Extra Assistant Com missioner’s appointment be revised and re-named, and that it be filled by a junior Colonial Office official, whose duties will be mainly magisterial and who would, as far as possible, be relieved of some of the other work now performed by the Extra Assistant Commissioner. A whole-time Income Tax Officer, however, will still be necessary though he would work under the control of the Treasurer. These are points on which I shall be glad to have the advice of the new Treasurer, which is an additional reason for my request that he should be sent to Aden in advance of the transfer to look into the present system of working these Departments and to advise on any changes that might suitably be made in them. Point 7. Audit .—It has been proposed to place the Aden accounts under the Director of Colonial Audit, who would send an auditor once or twice a year, a contribu tion to his salary being made from Aden. It has been assumed that it will be unnecessary to appoint a special local auditor but that a local audit clerk would probably be necessary. The Examiner of Outside Audit of the Bombay Presidency, who paid a recent visit to Aden, advised that a local audit staff of one superintendent and two clerks should be maintained for internal audit. This would be an additional expense, but contributions to the cost could be expected from the Port Trust and Aden Settlement Fund. I suggest that the strength of the local subordinate audit establishment be decided after consultation with the new Treasurer. Point 8. New Laws and Enactments.—It has been agreed that all existing Indian Laws and Enactments, including the Indian Civil and Criminal Procedure, Codes, and procedure should remain in force. This will presumably be effected by means of an Order in Council as in the case of British Somaliland when it was separated from Indian control. With regard to new Laws, it has been proposed that the Governor should be given power, with the consent of the Crown, to enact them, the concurrent power of the Crown to legislate by Order in Council being retained.5 There will be an Executive Council, of which I suggest that the following should be ex officio members: — The Governor. The Air Officer Commanding. The Political Secretary. The Civil Secretary. The Chairman of the Aden Port Trust and Settlement. The Treasurer. If non-official members are appointed they should be representative of the different communities in Aden, and they would therefore probably have to be not less than five in number, which would allow for one European, one Indian, two Arabs (as representing the largest community) and one Jew. I do not suggest that this racial allocation should be laid down by regulation, but it would probably be followed in practice by the Governor in making his recommendations. If it is not considered advisable to add these non-official members to the Executive Council at present, they might be made members of an Advisory Council, which would also include the members of the Executive Council, and would be summoned at the Governor's discretion only to discuss matters on which he wished to obtain direct contact with local public opinion. With regard to the drafting of new Laws or Enactments, it has been proposed that the Governor should ask for the advice of the Colonial Office on drafts prepared with the assistance of the Judicial Assistant at Aden, and that in cases of real urgency or emergency he would have to do the best he could, leaving any errors to be remedied later. In this connexion, I may mention that the designation of Judicial Assistant has been changed in 1933 to District and Sessions Judge, but he still acts in an advisory capacity in legal matters to the Resident and Chief Commissioner, and it should be made clear in the terms of future appointments that he is to continue to exercise this function for the Governor in addition to his judicial duties. I suggest that “ Legal Adviser ' be added to the present official designation of this officer. Point 9. Local Bodies .—It has been agreed that the Aden Port Trust and the Aden Settlement should continue their separate existence and should not be merged in the new local Administration, and I consider that this is the best course. Point 10. Lighthouses .—At the meeting in London in 1933, the Colonial Office undertook to take up the question of future arrangements in connexion with lighthouses with the Board of Trade. I do not know the result of this consultation, but I adhere to the view that the two lighthouses on Perim Island should be taken over and maintained by the Board of Trade, possibly with a contribution from the Government of India, light dues from ships on their account being collected not at Perim or Aden, but at Suez, as I understand is already done for the upkeep of other lights maintained by the Board of Trade in the Red Sea. The two lighthouses at Aden are at present managed by the Aden Port Trust, the Government of India paying for half the up-keep of one of them. It is possible that the Port Trust would be willing to forgo this contribution from Government, and would undertake the entire upkeep of these two lights from its own funds. In that case no light dues of any kind would be collected from shipping at Aden or Perim, as the present collection of light dues at these places on behalf of the Government of India would presumably cease. This change would be welcome here, as being calculated to enhance the popularity of the Port. Point 11. Ecclesiastical .—There has been a considerable amount of correspondence on this subject, and I have recently advocated the appointment of Royal Air Force chaplains at Aden and its separation from the Diocese of Bombay. My reason for departing from the recommendation made in my letter of the 10th of August, 1933, that Aden should remain in the Diocese of Bombay, and continue to be served by chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Establishment, was that I was given to understand that it would be impossible to send these Indian Service chaplains to Aden after the transfer except on a voluntary basis, which, in my opinion, would be unworkable. I have, however, now heard from the Bishop of Bombay that he hopes to find a means of overcoming this difficulty. If so, I would gladly revert to my original view that the present ecclesiastical arrangements should continue. This opinion is, however, subject to one reservation. At present the normal establishment here is two chaplains, of whom one is paid wholly by the Government of India and the other is paid in the proportion of one-quarter by the Government of India and three-quarters by the Air Ministry. As at least three-quarters of the members of the Church of England in Aden belong to the Army and Royal Air Force, I consider that the Air Ministry ought to pay three- quarters of the total cost of the Ecclesiastical Establishment. I understand that they B*2 (C21513)— MB 6 are willing to do so for one chaplain but are not prepared to pay any part of the cost of a Hi', -nd. II ft. Ai, Ministry ... not PJ.p.tfti to nrodif, ft.i. vi.w the establishment will have to be reduced from two chaplains to one. In my opinion this would be an undesirable result, as I do not think that one chapiain is sufficient and the absence of a second chaplain leaves no provision tor sickness 01 ^mt , d absence If it is eventually decided to increase the permanent garrison of Aden I hope that the Air Ministry will modify their view and will agree to bear a proportionate share of the cost of two chaplains. At present the! Air Ministry pay an annual contnbut o o Rs.450 in respect of the maintenance of Churches and Rs.450 tor the maintenance of cemeteries. I recommend that these contributions should continue to be made. Point 12. Lunatic Asylum—li was agreed at the 1933 meeting that the best course would be, if the Government of India saw no objection, to permit the existing practice ot sending lunatics from Aden to India to continue, possibly for a srna agree paymen per head by the new Aden Administration. I do not know whether this matter has been taken up with the Government of India: if not, I suggest that this be done now. Point 13. Rate of Income Tax.—This has been dealt with under Point 1. The question whether officers serving under the Civil and Political Administration should pay British income tax depends on the decision with regard to the framing of the budget. If all officers are paid from the Aden budget, and a grant-in-aid received from His Majesty’s Government, the officers would be liable to Aden income tax and not to British income tax. At present the Government of India receive an agreed sum of £500 from His Majesty’s Government towards income tax on the salaries of Military and Air Force personnel and Political Officers, who are exempted from Indian income tax. A similar amount may be expected from His Majesty’s Government after the separation. Point 14. Transfer of Government Buildings .—At the 1933 meeting I suggested that the most satisfactory course would be that all Government buildings should be transferred free by the Government of India to His Majesty s Government who would, in their turn, transfer them to the new Aden Administration. Ihis piocedure would be in accordance with the course adopted with regard to military buildings at Aden owned by the Government of India when the military control of Aden was transferred to the Air Ministry. Similarly, when the Air Ministry found that some of these buildings were surplus to their requirements, they were returned free of cost to the Government of India, who, in their turn, transferred them free of cost to the Government of Bombay, who handed them over, also free of cost, to the, Aden Settlement. The above remarks refer to the fourteen points that were discussed at the meeting held in London in 1933. I propose now to comment on certain other points which, in my opinion, also require consideration. Point 15. Budget .—At present the finances of Aden and of the Aden Protectorate are entirely separate, the former being controlled by the Government of India and the latter by the Colonial Office. A budget for Aden is submitted annually to the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India, and all receipts and expenditure are credited and debited to the Government of India. Aden has no separate financial existence. Income tax due from several firms doing business in Aden is collected from their head offices in India and not from their branches in Aden. The accounts of the Post Office and Telephones and of the Mercantile Marine Department (including Lighthouses), which are directly administered by the Government of India and not through the Chief Commissioner, are dealt with in India and not in Aden, and do not appear in the Aden budget. The latter therefore in its present form is not an accurate presentation of Aden’s financial position as a whole. After the transfer there will have to be a comprehensive budget showing all Aden Government revenue and expenditure, and, as both Aden and the Aden Protectorate will then be under the control of the Colonial Office, the question arises whether the Aden and the Aden Protectorate budgets should be combined. This is a point on which I desire instructions. I suggest that theremight be one budget divided into two parts—Civil (for Aden) and Political (for the Protectorate). The finances of Aden and of the Aden Protectorate could thus be kept distinct for local purposes, but would be combined in the budget submitted for approval annually to the Colonial Office. A grant-in-aid from His Majesty's Government will be necessary and it should include, in addition to actual expenditure on the Protectorate, all contributions at present made by His Majesty’s Government towards civil services, lor example, Police, Civil Hospital, Residency and Treasury Establishments. It is hoped that the remaining expenditure on Aden can be met from local revenue, but this will depend largely on : — {a) the amount of income tax that will be realized from firms doing business in Aden which at present do not pay income tax here, {b) the future of the Aden salt industry, and (c) the future position of Aden with regard to trade with Abyssinia which may possibly be diverted from Aden as a result of future developments in that country. I am submitting, as an accompaniment to this note, a Draft Estimate for an Aden budget (as distinct from the Protectorate) based on the actuals of the last three years and on the assumption that existing expenditure on personnel and service will be maintained, but with the addition of the increased revenue that it is hoped to receive and of increased expenditure that appears to be unavoidable. These increases are calculated on estimates that can at present be only tentative. They will need further examination in the light of fuller information regarding future income tax receipts and the prospects of.the salt industry and of the Abyssinian trade, and in relation to whatever decisions are made by His Majesty’s Government regarding future administrative personnel and other details of administrative expenditure, such as Ecclesiastical Establishment and lighthouses. Point 16. Personnel .—In Mr. Cowell’s letter to the India Office dated 24th October, 1933*, an assurance was given on behalf of the Colonial Office that all Indian administra tive personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent, and that it was intended that when vacancies occurred, though there would be a gradual substitution of officers of the Colonial Service in the Aden Service, Indians and officers of the Indian Political Department would remain eligible for appointment to such posts. In a telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, No. 798, dated 25th March, 1933f, it was stated that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to retain a proportion of Indian Service administrative personnel in Aden Service for some years after the transfer takes place, and it was suggested that posts at present staffed from India might continue so to be filled for about five years from the date of separation in the first instance. If so, not only would officers who are serving in Aden at the time of the transfer be retained, but they would in the ordinary course be relieved by other Indian Service Officers for about five years. It is understood that they would be retained at Aden on Indian rates of pay and on Indian terms of service. Their leave rules would therefore differ from those of officers in Colonial Service. The latter will probably be given leave after 18 months of duty, but Indian Service officers usually do longer spells of continuous duty and then obtain longer periods of leave than is customary in Colonial Service. The question arises as to how leave vacancies in the case of these officers will be filled. In the case of Colonial Service officers now serving at Aden, there is an adequate reserve to enable leave to be taken without the necessity of obtaining other officers for replacement. This is not so in the case of Indian Service officers now in Aden. When one of them goes on leave it will therefore be necessary for the Government of India to replace him by another officer, either temporarily for the period of his leave or substantively. This may have already been arranged between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, but if not, I suggest that a clear understanding should now be reached on this point. Indian Service officers may remain at Aden either {a) on deputation, or (ft) by retiring from Indian Service and transferring to Colonial Service. With regard to {a), the conditions under which officers may serve on deputation are laid down in Part VII, Chapter XII read with Appendix 11 of the Government of India Fundamental Rules. Deputation must be on a voluntary basis and officers are entitled to a deputation allowance not exceeding 25 per cent. The Aden Administration would also have to pay contributions to the Government of India towards leave, passages and pensions of these officers. This must be taken into consideration in calculating the cost to the new Administration of retaining Indian Service officers at Aden. * No. 35 in Middle East No. 50. f Enclosure in No. 17960/33 [No. 22 ] : not printed. (C21513)With regard to (6), I do not think that to dect for transfer to Servic 'e (retired on premature pension), who was ]nd^”nt at Aden from 1927 to 1931, would be willing to return to Aden ~ ^ i • i j c 111 ri ctp* nn i was judicial Assistant ai /iucii - &gt; ble rate of p a y offered to ^ fr n „f pr as n strict and Sessions Judge on any reasunciuic x .

I attach statements (A and B) showing the present superior and subordinate staffs in the existing Government administrative departments m Aden. In addition to these there are the officers and subordinate staffs of the Aden Port Irust and Aden Settlement, which I assume will remain unchanged. At present the administrative machinery or Aden is entirely distinct from that of the Protectorate, the only connecting link between the two being the Resident and Chief Commissioner. , When both Aden and the Pro tectorate are under the same control by the Colonial Office, it may eventually be decided to modify this dual system by appointing a Chief Secretary and an Assistant Secretary and possibly some junior Political Officers whose work, like that of the Governor, will be concerned with both Aden and the Protectorate, or who wall be interchangeable between these two branches of the Aden Government. If so, I suggest that this change should be brought about gradually, and that there should be no immediate alteration in the existing system. At present the Resident and Chief Commissioner has on his immediate staff a Political Secretary responsible to him for Protectorate affairs and a Civil Secretary who deals, under the Chief Commissioner’s direction, with Aden affairs. There is no official corresponding to a Chief Secretary, but the Political Secretary is senior to the Civil Secretary, and it is established that he acts for the Resident and Chief Commissioner when the latter is absent. This arrangement is open to the objection that the Political Secretary who has at times to act as the head of the dual administration, is familiar with only one side of it. It has, however, the merit of enabling the Political and Civil Secretaries to devote their whole time and attention to their respective spheres, which differ very greatly from each other owing to the strong contrast between conditions in Aden and conditions in the Protectorate. Aden is a small and progressive urban area which includes an important fortress and naval and air force bases, an active commercial community of a variety of races, and a busy fuelling and trading port, and is directly administered under the laws and customs of British India. On the other hand, the Protectorate is not under any form of direct British administration: its more advanced parts are governed by Chiefs under the Moslem Sheria Law, and its backward districts are merely tribal areas, many of which are in a semi-anarchic condition. The officers who deal with Aden and those w r ho deal with the Protectorate have very divergent problems and there is a good deal to be said for letting them specialize in their own particular duties. After the transfer, officers belonging to the Government of India Services who remain in Aden will be on deputation, unless they transfer to Colonial Service, and it will not be possible to retain them here without their own consent and without that of their departmental superiors in India. I have consulted the principal officers now in Aden with regard to their wishes in the event of the transfer taking place early next year, and remarks on this subject are included in the attached statement A. I assume that the assurances given by the Colonial Office with regard to terms of service applies also to the Subordinate Services, and that their services under the Govern ment of India will count towards their pension. I should like to be in a position to give an immediate assurance to them to this effect. If this is done I am confident that the majority of the members of the present Subordinate Services in Aden will wish to continue to serve after the transfer. When the members of these Subordinate Services or others who transfer to the new Administration, retire, their pensions would be payable by the Government of India and the Aden Administration in proportion to their services under the respective Governments. Those Who do not wish to remain and who belong to Services in India will presumably be absorbed into India. Those who have been recruited specially for Aden will wish to know what will happen to them if they are not willing to serve under the Colonial Office that is to say. whether they will be re-employed in India o 7 be gt en pennons o proportionate pensions. These are points for the decision of the Government of India9 Point 17. The Governor’s Powers .—The financial and administrative powers of the Chief Commissioner are now defined by the Government of India, and there are special provisions dealing with his powers in relation to the Aden Port Trust, which is a statutory body constituted under the Aden Port Trust Act of 1888 (Bombay Act No. V of 1888). The general financial and administrative powers of the future Governor will doubtless be defined by His Majesty’s Government, and, in doing so, it should be decided to what extent he will exercise powers now reserved to the Government of India in respect of the Aden Port Trust and in respect of certain Acts and Regulations regarding which the powers of the Chief Commissioner are now limited. I attach a copy of the Government of India Notifications, Nos. 171-N dated 1st April, 1932, and 199-N dated 15th May, 1934, under which the powers of the Chief Commissioner in respect of laws and enactments are at present regulated. The Chief Commissioner’s financial powers are defined in Chapter V of Part II of the Government of India Book of Financial Powers. Point 18. Table of Precedence .—At present the precedence of senior officers serving in Aden is regulated by the Indian Warrant of Precedence. When Aden is separated from India their appointments will disappear in this Warrant, and their precedence must then be regulated by the Colonial Office Administration. Aden being a Naval, Military and Air Force centre, it is necessary to decide relative seniority of civil officials with Naval, Military and Air Force officers. At present the Political Secretary ranks below a Lieutenant-Colonel, the Civil Secretary and District Magistrate ranks with a Major, and the Chairman of the Aden Port Trust ranks between the two. In my opinion, the grading of all these three officers ought to be raised. The Political Secretary should rank with Lieutenant-Colonels, and the Chairman of the Aden Port Trust and Settlement (who holds a most responsible position) might well do the same. The Civil Secretary might also be put on the same grade as the Political Secretary. The District and Sessions Judge at present ranks above Lieutenant-Colonels, and I think that this should remain unchanged. I recommend that his designation under Colonial Administration be Chief Justice and Legal Adviser or Judge and Legal Adviser I recommend that the opportunity of a change in the Warrant of Precedence be taken to make the alterations that I have suggested. The Civil Administrative Medical Officer, the Port Officer, and the Commandant of Police at present rank in accordance with their seniority in their own Services, all three at present being graded with Lieutenant-Colonels. As long as these posts are filled by officers of the Indian Services this practice might continue; but in view of possible changes in future I suggest that the appointments of Civil Administrative Medical Officer and Port Officer be classed with Lieutenant-Colonels and that of the Commandant of Police between Lieutenant-Colonels and Majors. The officer in charge of the Aden Administration is now the Resident, Chief Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief, being Resident in respect of the Protectorate and Chief Commissioner in respect of Aden. I understand that it is the intention of His Majesty’s Government that he will in future be termed Governor and Commander- in-Chief, this designation being in respect of both Aden and the Protectorate. At present he ranks 13 in the Indian Warrant of Precedence and is entitled to a salute of 13 guns. After the transfer his appointment will disappear from the Indian Warrant and I presume that his salute will be increased to 17 guns in accordance with paragraph 52 of the King’s Regulations and Admiralty Instructions. Visits of British and Foreign warships are frequent at Aden and calls between the Resident and Commander-in-Chief and Naval Officers are regulated by paragraph 99 of the King’s Regulations and Admiralty Instructions. The practice in this respect will be altered if the Resident is given the status of the Governor. The Air Officer Commanding at Aden now ranks at 33 in the Indian Warrant: in future he will presumably rank in Aden immediately after the Governor. It will be necessary to give the Treasurer a position in the new Warrant and this will depend on the relative seniority that he should hold in respect of other civil officials and of Naval, Military and Air Force officers in Aden, and on the position that he will hold as a member of the Executive Council. At present the two Political Officers, the Frontier Officer, the Education Officer, the Civil Surgeon, the Assistant Commandant of Police and the Extra Assistant Com missioner have no positions in the Warrant, and it is for consideration whether any or all of these officers ought to be graded. Point 19. Perim and Kamaran .—Perim is British Indian territory and adminis tratively part of Aden, and it will therefore be included in the transfer. Kamaran is not British or British Indian territory but it is administered by a Civil Administrator controlled by the Government of India through the Chief Commission -r at Aden, and its staff is largely drawn from India. The question of its future control (C21513) '10 must now be decided. If His Majesty's Covern^ responsibility for this Island, the Ang o 1 ‘ arranged that staff should still be will be affected. If this change is made, it should be arrangea drawn from India as required. • cUnrHerp in houses in Aden and it has for Point HO. New Buildings. T ere 1 t r ,.ii t he superior staff. This deficiency some time been difficult to arrange or rcsi cn Colonial Service Officers in Aden has been aggravated by the increase m the houses are required for and will be still more felt when the Treasurer is appointed. New nou 4 the following officers: — S Se Commandant of Police (who at present has to live in a hotel) 3 The Frontier Officer (who at present rents a hou^ belcmging to the Settlement which is much needed to house the Municipal Engineer). (a\ The Second Political Officer (who at present has no house). In addition the house at present occupied by the District and Sessions judge is old and in verv bad repair, and should be reconstructed. Other buildings that are much needed (1) to house the Government Secondary School (thus relieving the present con- gestion in the main Government school buildings), (2) a substantial addition to the Residency. This is at present a single storey bungalow, rooms in which are large but too few in number. An addition of a second storey would add very greatly to the convenience and comfort and appearance of the official residence of the Governor, and will be of great assistance to him in his official entertainments and in accommodating distinguished visitors to Aden; (3) a further extension to the Residency Office (Secretariat) building. The addition recently made has relieved the congestion as far as officers are concerned, but not as regards the clerical staff. The Confidential Clerk works in a very small room, which is crowded with Confidential records, and his assistant has to work in the general office. Ihere is no visitor s room, and visitors have to wait on the verandah. Most of the Residency Office furniture is very old, and needs replacement; (4) an extension to the Court and Treasury building, in which the existing accommodation is very inadequate. The Civil Secretary and First Political Officer now live in privately owned rented houses. This is not a satisfactory arrangement as the landlords frequently fail to keep the houses in proper repair and as the officers concerned are liable to notices to quit. It would be preferable if these houses were owned by Government and I am in favour of their being purchased and put into proper condition. In my opinion the Governor should have an official motor launch. At present I have none, and distinguished visitors, of whom many pass through Aden, have to be brought ashore in a launch borrowed either from the Air Officer Commanding or from the Aden Port Trust or in the Police launch. I suggest for consideration that His Majesty’s Government should make a special grant on the occasion of the transfer to enable these requirements to be met, and so to assist Aden in making a creditable start under its new form of Administration. Point 21. Printing Press—The question of the establishment of a Government Printing Press at Aden may be considered. At present Government printing for Aden is done in the Government Presses in India, and in the local private Presses. It will be convenient if the new Aden Government has its own Printing Press, as the printing of confidential documents is often urgently required, and it is not desirable to entrust this to private Presses. Information is now being collected for an estimate of capital and recurring expenditure. The capital cost might perhaps be included in the special grant which it is suggested should be made by His Majesty’s Government on the occasion of the transfer. The recurring expenditure would not be excessive Point 22. General Provident Fund.—M present Government servants in Aden who belong to Indian Services, both Superior and Subordinate, are entitled to contribute to the General Provident Fund maintained by the Government of India for the benefit of their families. Government contribute nothing towards this Fund but they pay interest on it, the rate of which is determined by the Government of India from year to year and is generally between 4 and 5 per cent. I recommend that sums in this11 Fund standing to the credit cf Government servants in Aden, who are transferred (not lent on deputation) to the new Aden Administration should be handed over from the Indian Fund to a new General Provident Fund to be maintained on the same lines by the Aden Administration, to which Aden Government servants would continue to be able to contribute. This would mainly affect the Subordinate Services. Point 23. Savings Bank. —At present the Government of India have a Savings Bank administered by the Postal Department. Ihis Savings Bank is a great help to middle class people, including subordinate Government servants, who deposit their small savings there. As there are no other banking facilities for small depositors in Aden it is desirable that this Bank should be continued under the new Administration. I he Somaliland Government, it is believed, maintain a similar Bank. Point 24. Cash Certificates.—At present the Government of India issue Cash Certificates, which are in the form of a loan, cashable in five years. As this system is closely connected with the borrowing policy of the Government of India, such a system for a small Colony would not be practicable. I suggest, however, that it be arranged with the Government of India that facilities be given to existing holders of these certificates to cash them in Aden on maturity. Point 25. Postal Insurance.—At present the Government of India have a Life Insurance Fund administered through the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department for the benefit of all Government servants. It would not be possible for the new Govern ment to institute a similar Fund. It is, however, desirable that an arrangement be made for receiving premia from present policy holders at the Aden Treasury for remittance to the Government of India. Point 26. Judicial and Revenue Stamps. —Indian Court bee, Notarial and Revenue stamps are at present used in Aden. Presumably new stamps will be printed for Aden, and existing stocks will be returned to India when the new ones will be printed. Point 21. New Flag. —At present the “ Viceroy’s Union ” is tlown by the Chief Commissioner. I he use of this blag will be discontinued after the transfer, and a new flag should be authorized. B. R.

Draft Estimates for a future budget have been prepared, based on the figures of revenue and expenditure of the last three years, 1932-33 to 1934-35, and on anticipated revenue and expenditure after the transfer. ^ Leave and Pension Contributions for Gazetted Officers lent by the Government of India on deputation to the Aden Administration have been calculated at 40 per cent throughout in accordance U 4 th Fundamental Ruk 116, Government of India's decision (l)(ii), and in the case of subordinate Establishments at 12 £ per cent (or £th) Deputation allowances have been calculated at 20 oer cent of the pay of the officers concerned. ^ ( 1 ) General Administration.

The Civil Surgeon is ex officio in charge of the Department and receives a charge allowance of Rs. 100 /- per mensem. A sum of Rs. 1,000/- has been provided as supervision charges payable to the Bombay Government. This item will probably be eliminated on transfer. ( 8 ) Police. A contribution of £8,000/- received from His Majesty’s Government on account of Armed Police has been entered on the Revenue side. (9) Ecclesiastical Department. Proposals are under consideration. At present the Air Ministry pay |ths of the pay of one Chaplain, and a contribution of Rs.450/- for Maintenance of Churches, and Rs.450/- for Maintenance of Cemeteries. This amount has been entered on the Revenue side. ( 10 ) Education. On the Revenue side there may be a reduction of Rs.5,000/- if the present contribution from the Port Trust &gt; the suitability of which has been questioned by the Government of India, ceases. (11) Medical.—Civil Administrative Medical Officer. The Port Health Officer is in charge of the Department ex officio and receives no extra remuneration. (11) Medical.—European General Hospital. The Port Health Officer is also in charge of the European General Hospital. An approximate provision has been made for the Deputation allowance for S.M.S. Officers deputed from Bombay. Civil Hospital. An approximate provision has been made for the S.M.S. Officers deputed from Bombay for the Civil Hospital and other dispensaries. (17) Central Public Works {Civil Works) Department. The Port Trust carry out the work on behalf of Government who pay to them supervision charges at 24| per cent. The Chairman, Aden Port Trust, receives an allowance of Rs.100/- per mensem from the Port I rust fund for super vising the work and accounts. The Department is budgetted under a separate head and is not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. It is included under (73) Civil Works. (17) {a) Salt. No provision has been made for pay of officers, as the Department is in charge of the Extra Assistant Commissioner. It is budgetted under a separate head III—Salt, and is not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. The revenue on account of salt will depend on the future policy of the Government of India with regard to the admission of salt from Aden into India. There may be a considerable fall in revenue. (18) Ports and Pilotage. Is budgetted under a separate head 27—Ports and Pilotage, and not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. The Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department, is an Officer of the R.I.N. who receives his grade pay as Commander (Rs. 900/-) plus a staff allowance of Rs. 620/- (free water and quarters from the Port Trust). The pay and allowances are shared in moities by the Port Trust and Government. (19) Lighthouses and Light Ships. Is budgetted for under a separate head 21 —Lighthouses and Lightships, and not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. The Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department, is in charge of the Department. On the revenue side, the total revenue is for all light dues including India, and a proportionate share only has been taken into account in the Draft Estimate on the assumption that the Perim lights are to be maintained and supervised from Aden. I am, however, recommending that they be taken over by the Board of Trade, in which case both revenue and expenditure on their account would disappear from the Aden Estimates. (20) Income Tax Department. Is budgetted for under a separate head, Demand No. 17— Income Tax, and is not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. Income tax receipts vary, and the estimate should be taken with reserve, as much depends on the prosperity of the port and trade and also on the export of salt. The largest factor in income tax receipts is Salt Industry, which pays a large sum. An addition of Rs.2,47,000 has been made on the Revenue side on account of the anticipated yield of income tax from firms doing business in Aden which now pay their income tax in India and not at Aden. This estimate is based on the average of the figures given by the Government of India in 1933 for the years 1930-31 to 1932-33. The Income Tax Officer is due to retire. Leave and pension contributions. Deputation allowance and .Passage Contribution have been provisionally made—subject to new arrangements in con templation. (22) Postal Department. Recent figures for the staff and allowances have been given by the Postmaster. They do not however include supervision charges for inspection and directorate. Leave and Pension contributions and deputation allowances for Postal subordinates have been made. (23) Telephones. The figures of the Telephones are purely a guess and not an accurate estimate. (24) Indian Partnership Act. Administration of the Indian Partnership Act is a minor Department under (5) and it is budgetted for separately under Miscellaneous 69 and not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. General Remarks. Under Expenditure, provision has been made for the cost of additions to staff that will probably be unavoidable. The figures are only tentative and refer to a proposed Treasurer, local Audit Staff, Contribution to a Colonial Office Auditor, the future administration of Perim, Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Extra Postal and Telephone staff. Interest on Provident Fund. A tentative provision has been made in the Draft Estimates for this item which does not appear in the annual budget. In the Draft Estimates, the salaries of the Extra Assistant Commissioner (who performs, amongst other duties, those of Treasury Officer) and of the Income Tax Officer have been shown as they are at present. These posts may, however, be revised after the transfer, if a new' appointment of Treasurer is created.26 \ Draft Estimates based on the figures of Revenue and Expenditure of the AFTER THE Revenue Heads.

No&gt; THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (Finance^XIee to THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. i\ 7 ... i 4117 \ ROOF. (Copy received in Colonial Office 30th May, 1936.) Simla, 7th May, 19136; Subject:—Financial adjustments between India and His Majesty’s consequent on the separation of Aden from India. Sir, I am directed to forward for information a memorandum on the financial adiust- ments between India and His Majesty’s Government consequent on the impending separation of Aden from India and to enquire whether the Secretary of State accepts its I have, &amp;c., J. C. NIXON, Secretary to the Government of India. Enclosure in No. Memorandum relating to the Financial Adjustments on the Separation of Aden from India. By Section 288 of the Government of India Act Aden is to be separated from India. Q e +- firS L? a m° f j U ^ SeC u 10 u ^ 5 \° f that Section has much the same import as that of ection 44 8 (1) and (2) which applies to Burma. But whereas in the case of Burma there is Section 452 of the Act contemplating a financial adjustment between India and Burma to compensate for any possible unfairness on account of this inevitable division of propertv arid on account of other factors, there is no corresponding clause relating to Aden. However this omission can hardly affect the proposition that if a financial adjustment between India and His Majesty s Government consequent on the separation of Aden is equitable, it should be effected. P • 2 f Th ? r . ep ^ rt of j he indo-Burma Tribunal has now provided a model for the financial adjustments to be undertaken when a country is split up into two parts. But where one o the parts is so small relative to the other as is the case of Aden compared with India from^mha SUpererogatory to appl T a11 the niceties necessary in the separation of Burma 3 . When His Majesty’s Government took over the military control of Aden the concerned buildings were transferred free of cost. This was in consonance with the practice and conceptions of the Government of India at the time. It has been assumed in past correspondence regarding the separation of Aden that civil buildings would be similarly handed over to His Majesty’s Government free of cost. But if, in view of the new conceptions forced on them by the report of the Indo-Burma Tribunal, a financial adjustment ought to be forthcoming on account of such assets as buildings, then the as ri^T n H W ° Uld be j Ustified in g° in g back ^ their previous opinion so far as civil buildings are concerned. The report of the Tribunal on this point, however fhTn h° merel y mean that Aden should pay India for the buildings in Aden any more rW ^ Indla should pa y Aden for the buildings in India. The report lays c^own that buildings come into the picture as an asset when calculating the balance of labilities over assets Aden ought to assume responsibility for a small fraction of the 'r n ot m Aden? ° f ^ Men ^ t0 credlt the fact that there is not in Aden a corresponding fraction of the dead assets of the Government of • k 14 ™° uld ’ howeve r, suffice in the case of Aden if His Majesty's Government reimbursed the Government of India for— 1 {a) obligations of the nature of debt specifically referable to Aden at the date of separation, and (b) some portion of the pensionary liabilities arising out of Aden. Aden Transfer— (C. 21893 / 55 ). 12 and 24.2 5. The formerly Indian military land in Aden was made over to the War Office subject to the two following conditions: — {a) the lands were to revert to the Government of India in the event of their ceasing to be utilized for military purposes, and (6) the Government of India was to provide the War Office free of cost with any land in Aden which might subsequently be required by the War Office in connexion with the defence of Aden. These two conditions will naturally lapse upon the separation of Aden. 6. The following were the balances of civil debt and deposit heads in Aden on 31st March, 1935: — Credits. Rs. as. P- General Provident Fund ... 1,18,962 11 0 I.C.S. Provident Fund (Sterling Branch) 9,219 8 0 Cemetery Endowment Fund ... 7,585 8 8 Revenue deposits 17,518 9 11 Personal deposits: Rs. as.

Assuming that responsibility for all of these items is assumed by the Aden authorities, they involve together a net liability against Aden of about Rs.101 lakhs. The present currency chest of the Reserve Bank of India at Aden will be closed and its contents brought back to India. 7. The item of Rs.5 lakhs above is the outstanding balance of a loan of Rs.10 lakhs drawn in 1925-26 by the Aden Settlement Fund for an electric supply project. The loan is at present carrying a rate of interest of 6£ per cent. The local authority maintains an invested sinking fund for the eventual repayment of this debt. Its annual contribu tion to the fund is about Rs.45,000. In December, 1933, the balance in the sinking fund was just over Rs.50,000.3 8. In regard to the Posts and Telegraphs Department there are certain adjustments to be taken into account. The capital account of that Department corresponds to an identifiable item in the public debt of India. The figures for Aden on 31st March, 1935, were— Capital outlay (i.e., depreciated value of assets as on 1st April, 1925, plus cost value subsequently): — (1) Post Office buildings at Steamer Point, Aden and Khomaksar ... ... 155 (2) Aden telephone exchange ... ... ... 1-57 Rs.3-12 lakhs. Less depreciation ... ... T9 ,, Net 2-93 This sum would be due by Aden to India. (The figures exclude the value of land as this is not borne on the block.) 9. Other items under Posts and Telegraphs which would require adjustment, as they stood on 31st March, 1935, are— (a) Savings Bank Deposits. (The Government of India will be responsible for any Indian savings bank accounts dead before the date of separation) .... .... ... ... Rs.4-48 lakhs. (b) Provident Fund Deposits ... ... ... .... ... ,, T5 ,, (c) Cash in the hands of Postmasters ... ... ... ... ,, T9 ,, The first two items would stand to the debit of Aden and the last to its credit. That is, between them they constitute a liability of value Rs.4-44 lakhs. Any balance of unpaid foreign money orders outstanding on the date of separation would also have to be adjusted. The amount will be small. It was only about Rs.450 on 31st March, 1935. The clearance of certain suspense heads (which show a credit of about Rs.4,750 to Aden on 31st March, 1935) might also involve adjustable items. 10. For the following elements, presumably adjustments will have periodically to be done through an exchange account and in consequence they need not be considered as coming into the separation question— Payment of Indian Post Office Cash Certificates. Money orders with India. Receipts and payments on account of Indian Postal life insurants. 11. The pensionary liabilities of Aden fall into the following categories: — (а) pensions in issue on the date of separation for service wholly in Aden (i) payable in Aden, and (ii) payable in India or elsewhere; (б) pensions in issue outside Aden on the date of separation covering part-time service in Aden; (c) future pensions arising out of whole time service in Aden; (d) future pensions arising out of part time service (whether before or aftec separation) in Aden. Of these, in the civil class, Aden will continue to disburse (a) (i) amounting at present to about Rs. 17,000 a year. (There is one pensioner who never served Aden drawing a pension from the Aden Treasury. The commuted value of his pension on 31st March, 1935, was about Rs.3,650 and Aden would be due to obtain a credit for this sum.) Aden will naturally become responsible for (c). Aden should in future meet the part of (d) on the basis of length of service referable to service in Aden. There is no practical manner of apportioning (b) and Aden will have to be exonerated from bearing any share of that class. Class (a) covers mainly subordinate personnel. As regards (a) (ii), five pensioners of the Aden Police department have been identified who draw their pensions at Barabera in Somaliland. Their charge amounts to about Rs. 1,000 a year. After separation Aden will bear this debit direct. Five other persons drawing pensions in India for whole time service in Aden have been identified. The commuted value of the pensions drawn by these as on 31st March, 1935, is about Rs.56,000. This sum would be debitable to Aden in a financial settlement upon separation.•'-xcrr 4 12. As regards pensions arising out of the Posts and Telegraphs department in Aden, any which were sanctioned before 1st April, 1921, would appear among civil pensions. It is unlikely that any which matter exist now. For the rest, only four pensioners have so far been discovered. One person is drawing a pension of Rs.37-11 a month in Aden for whole time service in Aden. Aden after separation will be responsible for this. Another is drawing a pension in Aden of Rs. 115-2 a month although he did not spend his A whole service there. Aden would obtain a credit for the capitalized amount of his pension ascribable on a time basis to his service out of Aden. Two other pensioners have been found in India who spent their whole service in the Posts and Telegraphs Department in Aden. The capitalized value of their pensions on 31st March, 1935, was about Rs. 15,300 which would be a debit in a financial settlement to Aden. 13. If, particularly in the Posts and Telegraphs Department, personnel to serve in Aden cannot be obtained from the present services and in consequence the Government of India have to abolish some posts and pay compensation to individuals thereby, the compensation element would be due to be debited to the account of Aden. 14. The summary (in Rs. lakhs) of the items mentioned above is as follows: — Liabilities by Aden to India. Paragraph 6 101 „ 8 , 2-93 „ 11 ... ■56 „ 12 ... •15 • 4-65 Liabilities by India to Aden. Paragraph 9 4-44 „ 11 , 04 4-48 Net amount due to India Rs.-17 lakhs. 15. If the cash balance in the treasury is above the normal figure on the date of separation, the difference will be taken to the currency chest. Under the terms of the Aden Settlement Fund Loan, India can claim nothing from the sinking fund before the date of separation. The amount of actual cash adjustment as on the date of separation is not likely to be a figure out of order with the figure at the end of the last paragraph. In view of the fact that as an outcome of separation India will save (according to the 1935-36 budget figures) Rs.16 lakhs a year on the military budget alone, it is not worth while India’s demanding payment of such a relatively small sum as this. It will therefore not be necessary to recalculate the position as on the actual date of separation. But it will be well to render the account set out in this memorandum as a record of the sums involved, and so that His Majesty's Government and the Departments of the Government of India, and especially the Accounts Department, may understand the position. ’ ^ 16. It may then be laid down that all pensions in issue in Aden on the date of separation will be borne by Aden, while pensions payable in India which cover the whole time or part time service in Aden will be borne by India. Any pensions payable outside India or Aden for whole time service in Aden will be borne by Aden which will however be relieved from bearing any share of such pensions if they cover only part time service m Aden. Pensions sanctioned after separation will be allocated between Aden and India on the basis of length of service.78126/36 [No. 1]. TRANSFER OF ADEN. Proposals for Discussion with Sir Bernard Reilly. (Memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office, 20th May, 1936.) No. OOF. Estimates. It is proposed that there should be two budgets, (A) for the Colony, and (B) for Military and Political or Protectorate matters. (A) Colonial Estimates. —The Revenue would appear under the following main heads:— Income tax to be collected under an Ordinance to be passed in the Colony, the rates to be roughly equivalent to the Indian rates now in force in Aden. The contribution from the Imperial Government to include an amount in respect of the Armed Police (towards the cost of which the Treasury contributes £8,000 a year at present) and a part of the salaries and pension liability of the officers performing duties in the Protectorate. The Expenditure would include: — (1) Salaries and passages of the Resident, Political and Civil Secretaries, and Political Officers. (2) Civil Services—Treasury, Justice, Education, Medical, Post Office, Works, etc. (3) Police. (4) Non-effective charges (pensions, etc.). Municipal and Port affairs would remain under the same control as at present, pending further consideration. (B) Protectorate Estimates. —Revenue would consist, initially, wholly of a grant from Imperial Treasury. Expenditure would cover: (1) The Levies. (2) Political expenditure on subsidies, grants, etc., in the Protectorate. (3) Expenditure in Perim. Kamaran would be considered separately; presumably its budget would be self balancing. In any event the administration is maintained primarily in the Interests of India. With a view to the inauguration of the new system, it is desirable that a Treasurer or hinancial Secretary should be appointed to take up his duties immediately on the transfer; it would be preferable that he should actually arrive in Aden before that date, and Treasury should be asked to provide funds accordingly. He should, besides framing the Estimates and controlling the accounts, be the adviser to the Governor on all financial and monetary questions. It is for consideration whether it will be desirable also to appoint a Legal Adviser. (1) Income tax. (2) Salt duty. (3) Excise, stamps, fees, and dues. (4) Contribution from Imperial Government.

Personnel. It is contemplated that all officers at present serving in Aden should be offered appointment under the Colonial Government on the same terms as to salary, leave, passages, etc., as they at present enjoy. As to discipline, they would come under the Colonial Regulations. Those not wishing to accept appointment would either be transferred to service in India or retired on such pension from India as they have earned. Officers retained in the service of the Colony of Aden would preserve their pension rights from India, and (if pensionable) would ultimately receive pensions in respect of their service under the Colony at rates not less than they would have earned if Aden had remained a part of India. Pension in respect of service up to the date of transfer would ultimately be paid from Indian funds. Officers newly engaged by the Colonial Government, or promoted to higher posts, will come on such terms of service, including pension rights, as may be fixed by the Government of Aden with the approval of the Secretary of State. Subject to the concurrence of the India Office and the Treasury, it is suggested that the Resident should issue a notification to all officers on the above lines shortly before transfer takes place. Salaries, etc., will be provided in the annual estimates and will not require special legislation.

[Answered by No. 78097j36 [iVo. 3].] Dear Cowell, Whitehall, S.W.l, 20th January, 1936. I enclose a copy of the Government of India’s letter of 7th November which contains the Government of India’s proposals in connexion with the transfer of control of the postal and telephone administration at Aden to His Majesty’s Government on the separation of Aden from India. Before putting these proposals to the Colonial Office officially, we think it is desirable to obtain more precise information on various points raised by the Government of India, and we accordingly propose to reply to them as in the draft* enclosed. I am sending you a copy of the papers at this stage in case you find any further obscurities which could be usefully elucidated now. If any such points occur to you, we shall be only too glad to incorporate them in our draft. As you will see from paragraph 2 of their letter, the Government of India propose to address us separately in regard to the financial adjustments in connexion with the transfer of buildings, plant, etc., so these considerations need not detain us at the moment, though we have stated our provisional view in paragraph 3 of our draft reply. Yours, &amp;c., J. C. WALTON. Enclosure in No. The Government of India, Department of Industries and Labour, to the Secretary of State for India. New Delhi, 7th November, 1935. Subject:—Transfer of control of Postal and Telephone Administration to His Majesty's Government, on separation of Aden from India. Sir, I am directed to address you on the subject cited above. 2. According to clause 5 of Section 288 of the Government of India Act, 1935, the property of the Posts and Telegraphs Department in Aden, such as buildings, cables, wires, apparatus and plant, etc., will, from the date of separation, vest in His Majesty for the purposes of the Government of Aden (subject to any necessary financial adjust ment in regard to which the Secretary of State will be addressed separately in due course), and all contracts made by the Department for the conveyance of mails or other services will continue in force as if they had been made by the Government of Aden. The Government of India presume that from that date His Majesty’s Government will take over the control and management of the Postal and Telephone administration, including the Head Post Office at Aden Steamer Point and the Post Offices in Aden City and in the islands of Perim and Kamaran, and will make their own arrangements for the supply of postage stamps, forms, etc. 3. The staff employed at Aden is partly recruited in India and partly locally recruited. His Majesty’s Government will presumably take over all the staff locally recruited for service in Aden and for offices under the Aden Head Post Office, and will ensure to them their existing scales of pay and conditions of service in respect of leave, pension, etc. In the case of the staff recruited in India now working in Aden, I am to suggest that such staff should also be taken over by His Majesty’s Government if they are willing to serve in Aden after separation. Those who are unwilling so to serve will have to be compulsorily retired, except in so far as it is possible to provide appointments for them in India. I am to suggest that His Majesty’s Government should meet a proper portion of the charges involved in each compulsory retirement, i.e., pensions, gratuities, etc. The Government of India will endeavour to find appointments for as many as possible in India, but they suggest that the cost of the retransfer of staff to India should equitably be borne by His Majesty’s Government. A statement is enclosed giving particulars of the staff at present employed within the jurisdiction of the Chief Commissioner of Aden. The question of sharing ordinary pensionary charges will be covered by the reference regarding financial adjustment in paragraph 2. * Not printed. Aden Transfer—(C.21893/80). 24.2 4. The Indian inland rates of postage are at present charged on correspondence between India and Aden and vice versa. I am to say that on strictly economic grounds there would be reason for charging higher rates, but I am to suggest that in view of the long and close connexion of Aden with India it is desirable that these rates should, for the present, continue to be in force, and to ask if His Majesty s Government concur in this proposal. I have, &amp;c., D. G. Mitchell, Secretary to the Government of India. Statement showing the number of staff at present employed in Aden (including all places UNDER THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, ADEN).

WALTON (India Office). (Copy received in Colonial Office, 14th February, 1936.) Office of the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, My dear Walton, Camp Calcutta, 23rd January, 1936. Will you kindly refer to your demi-official letter, dated the 29th August, 1935*, to Mr. Acheson, Foreign Secretary. I have been asked to reply direct to you so far as the Posts and Telegraphs Department is concerned. The total receipts and expenditure of the Aden head post office and of the five sub-post offices under it during the years 1933-34 and 1934-35 are shown in detail in the accompanying statement. As noted therein the expenditure on staff is based on actual payments made after deducting the emergency cut in pay which was 5 per cent, of pay in the years 1933-34 and 1934-35. No allowance is made for leave and pension charges. As regards the telephone system in Aden, I would request a reference to Clow’s letter, dated the 9th January, 1936f , to the address of the Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office. The system is working at a profit and it has been proposed to give some relief to the subscribers by reducing the rate of rental for direct connexions. The existing contract for the conveyance of mails between England and India by the P. and O. S.N. Company’s ships is between His Imperial Majesty’s Government and the Company and not between the Government of India and the Company. The contract was executed in 1908 for a period of seven years subject to determination at or after the expiry of that period on giving twenty-four months’ notice. The contract has been allowed to continue in force and as at present arranged is not terminable before the 31st January, 1938. In accordance with the terms of the contract, the mail steamers between England and India must call at Aden on both the outward and inward journeys. The P. and O. mail boats plying between England and Australia also call at Aden in both directions. Yours, &amp;c., G. M. BENNETT. * P.F. No. 37889 C.R. [No. 29] : not printed.

Dear Walton, Downing Street, 11th April, 1936. I am sorry to find that no reply has been made to your letter of the 20th January*, about the postal and telephone administration at Aden. I have only one material comment to make on the enclosures to your letter. I see that it is suggested by the Government of India that members of the staff at Aden who are unwilling to serve after the transfer should be compulsorily retired, and that His Majesty’s Government should be called upon to bear a proportion of the charges for their pensions. I think that we should have to resist any such proposal. We shall be under an obligation to offer all such officers a continuance of their service under the same conditions, as nearly as may be, as they at present enjoy. If they do not wish to continue in service on those terms, we can accept no further responsibility for them, and it will be for the Government of India to calculate and pay their pensions. The question of the calculation of the pensions of those officers who accept transfer to, and ultimately retire from, our service will be one of those knotty problems which we shall have to discuss at the conferences which it is intended to arrange when Reilly is here in the*summer. Yours, &amp;c., H. R. COWELL. * No. 78097/36 [No. 1 ]. Aden Transfer—(C.21893/82). 24.78097/36 [No. 4]. PROOF. No. COLONIAL OFFICE to GENERAL POST OFFICE.

I am directed by Mr. Secretary Thomas to inform you that, in connexion with the forthcoming transfer of the administration of Aden, he has had under his consideration the question of the maintenance of mail communication with this country. 2. It is understood that the existing contract for the conveyance of mails between England and India is between His Majesty’s Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and provides for a call at Aden by the mail steamers on both outward and inward journeys. I am to enquire whether this is the case, and if so whether it may be anticipated that the call at Aden will be maintained after the separation of the administra tion of Aden from that of India.

Sir, • Whitehall, London, S.W.l, 5th May, 1936. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the Government of India’s letter of 7th November*, regarding certain proposals connected with the transfer of control of the postal and telephone administration to His Majesty s Govern ment on the separation of Aden from India. 2. Before seeking the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government in the Government of India’s proposals, the Marquess of Zetland would be glad to be supplied with information on the following points: — (1) What are the existing scales of pay and conditions of service in respect of leave, pension, etc., for members of the staff employed in the Postal and Telephone Services of Aden ? (2) In the case of members of the staff recruited in India who are unwilling to continue to serve at Aden after transfer and for whom it is impossible to find appointments in India, what pensionary concessions, if any, do the Government of India consider necessary or desirable ? His Lordship presumes that the “ proper proportion of such charges which it is suggested that His Majesty’s Government should bear would be the excess cost over the charge incurred in the event of normal retirement at the same date, but he would add for the Government of India’s information that it is understood demi-officially from the Colonial Office that His Majesty’s Government are likely to challenge the view that they are under any obligation to contribute towards the expense of pensioning this category of persons. (3) His Lordship observes that of the staff recruited locally in Aden, a certain number including nineteen clericals are apparently unwilling to continue to serve after transfer. His Lordship would be glad to know what are the intentions of the Government of India in regard to such persons. 3. I am to add that the clause in brackets in the second paragraph of your letter is not clearly understood. Under the provisions of Section 288(5) of the Government of India Act it has not been contemplated that any payment should be made by His Majesty’s Government for the property transferred at Aden. 4. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Chief Commissioner, Aden. I am, &amp;c., M. J. CLAUSON. * Enclosure l in No. 78097/3^?

No. 1. INDIA OFFICE to COLONIAL OFFICE. (Very Secret.) India Office, Whitehall, Sir, London, S.W.l, 2nd February, 1933. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that in connexion with the forthcoming constitutional legislation he has had under consideration the question of the future of Aden, and that he has thought it desirable to invite the views of the Government of India on the question of taking steps to separate the Settlement from India. 2. To enable them to consider the question further the Government of India are anxious for an indication of the views of His Majesty’s Government on the follow ing five points. They ask whether in the event of separation His Majesty’s Govern ment would be prepared to— (a) relieve India of the contribution at present paid towards the military and political administration; (b) maintain the policy of making Aden a free port; (c) assume liability for the difference between revenue and administrative charges without imposing additional taxation or reducing the standard of administration. The present difference, on the basis of figures for 1929-30 to 1931-32, averages about £2,000 per annum, but will probably be more than covered by additional income tax receipts from certain Aden firms which now pay all their income tax in India instead of Aden; (d) retain a proportion of Indian Service administrative personnel in Aden service for some years after transfer takes place; (e) agree to the retention of the right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court, if this is found to be administratively and legally possible. 3. The Secretary of State would suggest that the simplest course would be that the Government of India’s inquiries should be considered in the Standing Aden Com mittee at the earliest possible date, and if Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister agrees he would suggest that a meeting might be arranged, if possible, on Monday, 6th February. The Government of India are committed to consulting the Indian Legislature and the interests concerned before any action can be taken in regard to the future of Aden, and since it is important to reach a decision in time for its annoimcement, if necessary, as part of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government on Indian Constitutional ques tions which are to be laid before Parliament in the course of the spring, it is, as will be appreciated, of the first importance to clear the ground with the minimum of delay. 4. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Treasury, Air Ministry, Admiralty, and War Office. I am, &amp;c., J. C. WALTON.17960 33 [No. 18]. No. 2. ADEN STANDING COMMITTEE. Minutes of the Nineteenth Meeting held on the 10th Iebruary, 1933, at the Colonial Office. in respect of India. The whole question had been reopened by a letter* from the India Office (copies of which had been sent to the Departments represented on the Committee), in which they said that the Government of India had asked for the views of His Majesty’s Government on certain points in order that they might further con sider the question of the separation of the Aden settlement from India. The Govern ment of India had asked whether in the event of separation His Majesty s Government would be prepared to :— (a) relieve India of the contribution at present paid towards the military and political administration; (b) maintain the policy of making Aden a free port; (c) assume liability for the difference between revenue and administrative charges without imposing additional taxation or reducing the standard of administration; (d) retain a proportion of Indian Service administrative personnel in Aden service for some years after transfer takes place; (e) agree to the retention of the right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court, if this is found to be administratively and legally possible. Mr. Cowell said that he had discussed the whole question with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and that his views on the various points were as follows :— (a) This was a financial question which must be left to the Treasury. (b) In view T of the great importance at present attached to tariff considerations, the Secretary of State w T ould not be prepared to bind himself to maintain Aden as a free port indefinitely, although in all probability it would remain so in practice. (c) This is for the Treasury to decide, but if they are willing to meet the annual deficit in the administration of the settlement, the Colonial Office could undertake to maintain the existing standard of administration without in creasing the burden of taxation. Such an undertaking would, however, be expressly liable to reconsideration in the event of any fundamental change of circumstances. (d) This v r ould clearly be to our advantage, and w r e should probably undertake to retain for a fixed period of years the Indian Service personnel in all posts in Aden in w T hich they are at present employed. After which, the gradual substitution of Colonial Service officials in the Aden Service would be considered. Indians would, of course, remain eligible for appointment to such posts. (e) There would be no objection to this, which would probably be the most convenient arrangement. On the general question, the Secretary of State considered that it would be prefer able for Aden to be under one administration, but if it were decided that the Govern ment of India should make no further contribution to the militarv and political expenses, he would feel some doubt about approaching Parliament for the vote of such a considerable sum of money merely to alleviate administrative difficulties. He would require an assurance that there would be no interference on the part of the Government of India. Present : TfAxi • ti • VJT • llllVVAllfli Mr. G. E. Crombie Mr. E. A.

Mr. J. G. Laithwaite ii-lix. xx. -Lx-nxvu, vx. . Mr. S. I. James, Secretary. Mr. Cowell said that the meeting had been called to hold a preliminary dis cussion regarding the future of Aden in connexion wdth the forthcoming legislationMr. Cowell said that it had also been suggested that an assurance would be required from His Majesty’s Government that, if the Aden Settlement passed to their control, there would be no racial discrimination. There should be no difficulty about this. Mr. Laithwaite said the question of the transfer of Aden to His Majesty’s Government had been raised with the Government of India, partly as the result of informal discussion with members of the interested Departments here. The Secretary of State and the Government of India were as yet uncommitted on the subject, and it would be necessary for the latter to consult the Indian Legislature and the interests involved before a linal decision could be taken. The question was a controversial one in India, and any proposal for transfer would certainly be the subject of severe criticism in the Indian Legislature. There were two chief difficulties :— (1) The Bombay commercial interests in Aden were very apprehensive that if the Settlement passed from Indian control, their interests would not be properly looked after. Assurances on points (6) to (e) should go a long way to remove then- objections, but Mr. Laithwaite was inclined to think that some more detinite guarantee than that contemplated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies would be desirable as regards the maintenance of Aden as a free port. (2) The transfer would be unpopular in any circumstances. But its un popularity would be enormously aggravated if there were to be any; ques tions of coupling it with the retention of any Indian financial contribution. In the Secretary of State’s view it would be politically impossible to main tain any contribution in the event of transfer. A contribution could indeed be imposed and the money would be non-votable, but the item would be open for debate annually in the Indian legislature and the pressure for its abandonment would be exceedingly difficult to resist. With regard to the question of maintaining Aden as a free port, Mr. Cowell intimated that if there were a possibility of deadlock on this point, it would probably be possible to devise some formula to satisfy both sides. Mr. Laithwaite explained that the need for a decision was urgent, as it was desired to deal with the question in the White Paper which was to be issued at the end of March. Mr. Grieve emphasized the importance of reaching a decision now that the whole question of the future constitution of India was in the melting pot, and of not allowing the Aden question to go by default. He explained that, although it had been suggested that members of the Committee should be in a position to represent the views of their respective Ministers, it was quite impossible for him to refer the matter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer at this stage. He pointed out that this was a case in which the Chancellor must reserve his view until the various political and strategic considerations had been advanced by the Departments concerned. It was, he urged, for the other Departments to submit views to the Cabinet to which the Chancellor could speak. He could not, therefore, at this stage give any opinion as to what the Treasury attitude would be. It was suggested that India might pay a fixed sum (probably less than the present maximum of £150,000 per annum) for a definite period of, say, 10 years. Mr. Laithwaite, however, thought that there could be no question in any circum stances of an Indian contribution in the event of transfer, save possibly as part of a oeneral arrangement in which all portions of the Empire interested in the position of Aden would participate. Group Captain Peirse said that the Air Ministry had never been satisfied with the present arrangement, and recalled the difficulties which had arisen at the time of the operations against the Imam in 1928. The transfer of Aden to the Home Government might, of course, involve an extra burden on air votes of some £85,000 (at present contributed by India), but this was a matter for the Treasury. From the point of view of speed and efficiency of administration, the Air Ministry had always advocated the change. Lieutenant-Colonel Henderson said that, although there was only a relatively small military contingent in Aden, the War Office agreed with the Air Ministry as to the desirability of having Aden under one administration. Mr. Earl endorsed this view and said that, although the change would mean additional expenditure by the War Office of about £16,000, strategic interests must take precedence over financial ones.4 At this point there emerged an aspect of the question which was new to the majority of the members of the Committee. This was that, if under the new Constitu tion, Aden remained a part of India, the existing arrangements, failing special pro vision, might not be continued and military control of the Settlement might revert to the Government of India. Group Captain Peirse at once stated that this possibility entirely altered the situation, since the Air Ministry could not contemplate military control of Aden passing 0 from the Imperial Government. He, therefore, suggested that the India Office should restate the position likely to result from the constitutional changes in India. It was generally agreed that in the new circumstances an added importance was given to the need for arriving at a satisfactory settlement as to the future administra tion of Aden under the new Constitution. In reply to a question, Mr. Laithwaite explained that defence and external affairs would, under the new Constitution, be reserved to the Governor-General. Mr. Cowell said that the port of Aden was a vital link in Imperial communica tions, and he suggested that it might not suit Admiralty requirements if the defence of the port was taken out of the hands of His Majesty’s Government, since, in that case, the port would be in the same position as any other port in India. Commander Rivett-Carnac said that he had not come prepared to represent his Department’s views on the wider issue which had been now raised. Speaking personally, he thought the Admiralty would, in the new conditions adumbrated, oppose the resumption by India of responsibility for the defence of Aden. Aden was an essential fuelling port and base on the lines of communication to the Far East; and if India obtained a greater degree of self-government its retention under Imperial control as an additional base for the East Indies Squadron would acquire added importance. Group Captain Peirse said that the defence of the Protectorate would become more difficult still, if agreement had to be reached with the authorities in India on every step which had to be taken. The Air Ministry had never contemplated such an event, and the possibility of such conditions would clearly strengthen their view that it was desirable for Aden to become the entire responsibility of His Majesty’s Govern ment. Mr. Cowell said he imagined that we should be able to maintain our relations with the tribes of the Protectorate, provided that, as he supposed would be the case, we should be allowed to retain certain Political and Military Officers in Aden itself. At the same time, our interest in the Protectorate was only part of the defence scheme of the port of Aden. It seemed more than probable' that if the defence of Aden became the concern of the authorities in India, considerable friction, if not in efficiency, might result. After general discussion, it became clear that the crux of the problem was the defence of the port of Aden, and the question was whether the risks involved in the possible retransfer, now or at a later stage, of military control at Aden to the Indian Federation were such as could be faced. The following conclusion was eventuallv reached :— The India Office would prepare a memorandum for the Cabinet, setting out what the position was likely to be on the establishment of the Indian Federation as regards the exercise of military control at Aden, while the Admiraltv and Air Ministrv would submit a memorandum describing the strategic importance of the port, of Aden and marshalling the arguments against the transfer of its militarv and political control to the Government of India. ' ' Mr. Cowell said that it did not appear necessary for the Colonial Office to put up a separate memorandum, since the political relations with the Protectorate tribes was only a minor aspect of the matter and was in fact only part of the defence question. 17983/33 [No. 1]. ♦ No. 3.

I enclose a copy of an air mail letter from the Government of India, together with the enclosure in original. As you will see, it is proposed to replace the Aden5 4 - 4 '' Civil and Criminal Justice iVct, 1864 (and certain amending Acts), by a Regulation making provision for the administration of justice at Aden by Courts both Civil and Criminal. The change is, I understand, no more than a matter of procedure and raises no question of substance, and it is suggested solely consequent on the recent transfer of the administrative control of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Govern ment of India and the establishment of Aden as a Chief Commissioner’s province. I do not imagine that you will be very actively interested and write only to say that we propose, subject to any comments you may wish to make, to submit the Government of India’s recommendation for approval. If you feel doubt on any point perhaps you would let me know and we might discuss it. Yours, &amp;c., J. G. LA1THWAITE. Enclosure in No. 3. Government of India. Home Department.

As a result of transfer of control of Aden to Government of India, Chief Commissioner has suggested a draft Regulation to replace Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Act, 1864. Draft has been revised by Government of India and a copy of revised draft is enclosed. It is being forwarded to Chief Commissioner to be examined and if necessary further revised. Chief Commissioner and Government of Bombay consider, and we agree, that this is an urgent measure which should be promulgated as soon as possible. Meanwhile as you are aware question of separation of Aden from British India is under consideration. Bombay Government consider it desirable that draft should be issued before this separation takes effect. We agree and would be glad to know by telegram whether you see any objection to this course.

[Answered by No. 5.] Dear Laithwaite, Downing Street, S.W.l, 6th May, 193o Thank you for your letter of the 21st of April,* regarding the draft Regulation to replace the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Act, 1864, and certain amending Acts. The intention of Section 23 of the draft Regulations is not altogether clear to us, but we assume that the object is merely to assist the Somaliland Courts by enabling their decrees to be enforced against persons or property within the jurisdiction of the* No. 4. 6 Aden Courts. If this is correct, we have no objection to the Section. Apart from this, we have no comments to offer on the draft, which I return herewith. The point has, however, been raised whether, if we take over Aden, we should be free to make whatever provision seemed proper to the Secretary of State in regard to procedure prior to appeal to the Bombay Courts. Roberts Wray assumes that this would be so; but you suggested that there might be, for all you knew, some technical difficulty. Perhaps you would ask Chamier about this? Yours, &amp;c., H. R.

Many thanks for your letter of the 6th May,* about the draft Regulation to replace the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Act, 1864, &amp;c. The assumption in the second paragraph of your letter is correct. As regards the point in the last paragraph, I enclose a note by Sir Edward Chamier. We have not yet, as you know, considered in any detail the procedure to be adopted in connexion with the various details of the transfer of Aden. From what he says there seems, however, no reason to anticipate that any difficulty will arise over the matter in which you are interested. Yours, &amp;c., J. G. LAITHWAITE. Enclosure in No. 5. Note by Sir Edward Chamier. When the island of St. Helena was made over to the Home Government and again when the Straits Settlements were made over to the Home Government statutory provision was made for the future government of the territories and for legislation by Order in Council, see 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 85, Section 112, and 29 and 30 Viet, c. 115, Sections 1 and 2. Some such provision will be made in the case of Aden. I understand that in some way or other, it is intended to provide that the right of appeal to the Bombay High Court shall continue but I do not know whether this provision is to be made by the Statute itself or by Order in Council made under the Statute. In either case the Home Government will be able to make such provision as it thinks proper regarding procedure prior to appeal to the Bombay High Court. I see no reason for any difficulty about this.

The Residency, Aden, 18th April, 1933. Future of Aden. I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter addressed to me by Mr. 1 ramroze Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw, and of its accompaniment, a copy of a resolution passed at a meeting convened in connexion with the future of Aden. 2. Mr. Framroze Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw is the local head of the piincipal Indian (Parsee) firm in Aden. He has informed me that he has heard from a private source in India that the separation of Aden from India is contemplated, and that he therefore called this meeting in the hope of preventing it. I understand that it was attended by both Indians and Arabs. I told Mr. Framroze Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw that I was prepared to forward to Government any considered resolution passed by a representative meeting, and I accordingly do so, with my comments. 3. It will be seen that the sense of the meeting was opposed to a transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office on general grounds, and particularly on account of its- anticipated effect on the local salt industry, on post and telegraph charges, on the cost of administration, and on the method of government. 4 The future administration of Aden is an Imperial question of more than local concern, but I trust local interests will receive full consideration in any decision that is taken with regard to it. 5. The danger to the salt business of Aden if it loses the protection of the Indian salr tariff is obvious, and will be serious, especially in view of the severe competition of the recently established salt works at Ras Hafun in Italian bomahland. e pio Auction of salt is Aden’s only important industry, and a setback to it will affect very adversely not only the firms concerned but also Government revenue from income tax and royalties, and will cause a certain amount of local unemployment. It is there ore to be hoped that, whatever may be decided with regard to the future of Aden, means wili be devised to safeguard the prosperity of its salt business. fi. I trust that the meeting’s fears on other points will prove to be ill-founded, and that it will not be necessary to impose additional burdens on the community. 1 am of opinion that a change in the control of Aden need not, and ought not, mvol\y anv serious alterations in the existing system of administration, at any rate for several years; and that new taxation, new laws and a multiplication of new officials should be avoided An official assurance to this effect would go far to allay misgivings with regard to a possible change of control if His Majesty’s Government and the Govern ment of India decide on making one. I have, &amp;c., B. R. Reilly, Chief Commissioner. To the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. New r Delhi. ~ Aden, 17th April, 1933. Proposed Transfer of Aden to ( olonial Office. A LARGELY attended meeting of Arab and Indian citizens was held \esterday evening under my presidentship to consider this question, when those assem '^ cl unanimously gave' their verdict against the transfer and passed a resolution, a Sir,- mmm s of which I am forwarding you under instructions received. I am asked to request that you will be so good as to forward this resolution to proper quarters with such remarks in support thereof as you may deem necessary in the interests of those to whom this question most concerns, viz., the mercantile community of Aden compused of Indian and Arab traders and merchants. I understand that the Jews as a community entertain similar ideas as those expressed in the resolution, but were unable to attend the meeting on account of some ▼ festivities. I have, &amp;c., Framroze H. C. Dinshaw. The Chief Commissioner, Aden. Resolution. This meeting of Arab and Indian citizens of Aden view with alarm the contem plated transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office, which if carried into effect would not fulfil the pledges given by the Government of India through its accredited representa tives from time to time. The transfer would be highly detrimental to the residents of Aden, as they would be cut off from their Indian connexion which has proved so far beneficial. The Colonial Government, it is feared, will not be able or willing to look after their welfare as can be expected from India in which they are represented in the legislatures. The salt protection duty of the Government of India has materially helped the salt industry to this place and which will automatically cease to exist immediately her connexion with India is severed. The bulk of the business is in the hands of Indians, to whose wants the Colonial Office cannot show the same sympathy as can be expected from the present Government. Postage and telegraph rates will also go up automatically. Expenditure it is feared will be doubled or even trebled by high paid English officers being imported direct, as is at present being done in British Somaliland, and to meet which customs and other duties will be levied, to the detriment of the trade of this port, which is already dwindling. It is also feared that landlords will be materially affected by the change, as different laws and regulations foreign to the citizens will be applied to Aden. Further, this meeting strongly supports the various representations made by public bodies to the Government of India and the emphatic protests they had received from different quarters which now stand as good and strong as when they were made. The news has caused surprise to Arab and Indian merchants, who have played an important part towards the development of Aden ever since its conquest in 1839 and who have very large vested interests in Aden. This meeting also reminds the Government of India of the assurances they gave in the Council of State and pravs that the Governor-General will, in the interests of the Arab and Indian citizens of this port take up the same position his Government rightly took up a few years back when this question was raised, and the step fraught as it is with far-reaching consequences to the well-being of the inhabitants of this place will it is hoped not be allowed to be carried out without consulting the people most concerned and without giving the Indian Legislature an opportunity to examine it in all its bearings. This meeting requests that the Chief Commissioner of Aden will kindly impress upon the Imperial Government, as well as the Government of India, that the transfer will be hicffilv detrimental to the interests of Aden. Enclosure 2 in No. 6. (Confidential.) Sir, The Residency, Aden, 19th April, 1933. Future of Aden. I have the honour to forward a translation of a letter which has been addressed to me by a number of the leading Arab residents in Aden on the subject of the possible transfer of the administration of Aden from the Government of India to the Colonial Office. This expression of their views is a direct result of the meeting held a few days ago under the auspices of Mr. Framroze Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw, which was reported to you in my letter No. C/215 dated 18th April, 1933.9 * 2. In my opinion the letter represents the real opinion of intelligent members of the Arab community, which, as you are aware, forms the majority of the population of the Settlement of Aden. They regard with considerable apprehension the possibility of the inclusion of Aden in a self-governing Indian Federation, and the consequent prospect of an Indian domination over an Arab town. The Aden Arabs are extremely conservative, and they desire as little change as possible in the existing administration of the Settlement. This sentiment is expressed under the headings (1), (2), and (3) in their letter. Of these the first, namely, the continuance of Aden as a free port, is, in my opinion, vital to the prosperity of the place, which is based on its transit trade. 1 understand their heading (4) to refer to their desire that Government posts in Aden should, as far as possible, be filled by local recruitment. I have, &amp;c., B. R. Reilly, Chief Commissioner. The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. (Translation.) After Compliments, Aden, 18th April, 1933. There are reports and rumours of the intending transfer of Aden to the Colonial Government. The Indians have held a meeting to protest against this transfer. As tiie majority of the people of Aden are Arabs to whom this question is more important than to anv other community, we thought it better to express our opinion on it. We have no objection to the transfer of Aden to the Colonial Government if (1) the Port will remain free, i.e., no tariff will be imposed on exports and imports; (2) if taxes- in general will remain as they are if not reduced having regard to changed conditions; (3) if the laws and local rules will remain as they are unless it is considered necessary to alter some of them in the interest of the place; (4) the rights of the people remain as they are, if not improved upon; the people to have a prior right to Government posts and appointments, &amp;c. • - If this is not possible, Aden may form part of the “ Reserved Area,” i.e., under the Governor-General of India. We have confidence in our Governor, Colonel Reilly, as we consider him to be one of us. If he will remain for ever a Governor of Aden, we would accept any Government without reservations, but alas he will have to go one day from Aden. 32 signatories. To H.E.

I understand that he fears that local agitation against transfer will grow unless the proposed safeguards are made known at an early date. Inquiries as to future arrangements are also beginning to be made here, and if we are pressed in Parliament it may, before long, become difficult to withhold information of what is contemplated. It seems preferable that first announcement should be made in India. Though I realize that natural occasion for this would be debate in Legislative Assembly, I am impressed by desirability of an early statement with a view to indicating assurances which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give in event of separation, and thus forestalling propaganda based on ignorance of these assurances. Would it be possible to take the opportunity of representations submitted to Reilly to make announcement, which could indicate that10 full opportunity would b6 ^nvon for discussion in Lcgisl&amp;turc in due couisc, End that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give the assurances covered by my telegram of 25th March last, No. 798?

It was not possible during last session of the Assembly to allot special time for discussion of the question, and our expectation that it might be raised during debate on the White Paper was not fulfilled. Discussion must therefore be postponed until September session, but meanwhile we suggest it might be raised before Joint Select Committee in London. Indian “ participators ” are a very representative body and include several members of the Legislative Assembly, while, possibly for this purpose, members of the Legislatures sent for Reserve Bank and Railway Board discussions might be added. Select witnesses on behalf of Indian interests in Aden might also be called. We would suggest that in such discussions Government spokesmen should take the line that, for reasons explained in paragraph No. 3 of your telegram. 9th March, 630, His Majesty’s Government are considering the question of separating Aden from India on or before the date of federation, and are therefore anxious to elicit Indian opinion on the subject before making up their minds. The countervailing advantages and safeguards to accompany separation, as detailed in your telegram 798, should also be explained, in order that Indian opinion may appreciate that there are two sides of the question, even from the Indian point of view. 4. Our views on subsidiary question, as to when and how separation should be effected, cannot be formulated until discussions have taken place and main question is decided.

Following is proposed text of announcement:— Begins :—His Majesty’s Government have recently received representations from various communities amongst inhabitants of Aden, on the one hand pro testing against and on the other, advocating transfer of administration from control of Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. The matter is one which is now receiving consideration of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India in connexion with impending constitutional changes. It is clear that no decision can be reached until Indian Legislature and other interests have had an opportunity of stating their views and those views have been considered. It is proposed to initiate discussions on subjects both before Joint Select Committee and subsequently at (? next) session of Indian Legislative Chambers. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government think that it would be convenient that considerations which suggest desirability of a transfer of administration and conditions that would be entailed by such a transfer, should be made known, so that problem can be discussed with full knowledge of the facts. The reasons which suggest that Aden should not remain linked with India under the new Constitution are, that it is an area geographically remote from India; that it would not naturally fit into the new federation; that it is already to some extent under Imperial control, and that it is inseparable in practice from Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of India control. If* No. 8. in— T 12 it should be decided that the administration of Aden should be separated from that of India, His Majesty’s Government contemplate that the following .con ditions would be established: (1) India would be relieved of annual contribution approximately £160,000 sterling, or Rs.20 lakhs, at present payable towards military and political administration. , tj- u n + (2) The right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be maintained if this arrangement were found to be administratively and legally possjbh ^8 M - ty &gt; s Government would maintain existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in present economic situation should take place. The prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transhipment trade, so that abandonment of policy of airee port would obviously be against its financial interests. . . (4) His Majesty’s Government would do their utmost to maintain present standard of administration and would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became, in their opinion, absolutely necessary. (5) A proportion of Indian sendee administrative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place. (6) No racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty’s Government. 17960 33 [No. 28]. No. 9. INDIA OFFICE to COLONIAL OFFICE.

Colonel Reilly, the Chief Commissioner,, who is now on leave in this country, fears that, unless an announcement is shortly made, propaganda against transfer may make great headway at Aden, and may gain many adherents among the Arab population, as well as among Indians, as a result of ignorance of the conditions of transfer to which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree. 3. Subject to the views of Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare would propose to authorize an announcement in the terms set out in the Government of India’s telegram, No. 1289, subject to the alterations which he has suggested to them in the telegram of which copy is enclosed.

I feel it would be undesirable for His Majesty’s Govern ment to raise separation of Aden as an issue before the Committee. It may be raised by Indian delegates after announcement and Committee may discuss it. But it is probable that it would decline to hear special evidence on the subject. 2.

Following is text of announcement for issue in India and at Aden to newspapers of morning of Tuesday, 20th June :— Begins :—His Majesty’s Government have recently received representations from different communities among the inhabitants of Aden as well as from certain quarters in India expressing their various views in regard to the transfer of the administration of Aden from the control of the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. The matter is one which is now receiving the consideration of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India in connexion with the impending constitutional changes. Full opportunity will be given for dis cussion in the Indian Legislative Chambers at their next session and for all the interests concerned to state their views. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government think that it would be convenient that the considerations which suggest the. desirability of a transfer of the administration and the conditions that would be entailed by such a transfer should be made known, so that the problem can be discussed with a full knowledge of the facts. The reasons which suggest that Aden should not remain linked with India under the new Constitution are, that it is an area geographically remote from India: that it would not naturally fit into the new federation; that it is already to some extent under Imperial control, and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control. If it should be decided that the administration of Aden should be separated from that of India, His Majesty’s Government contemplate that the following conditions would be established :— (1) India would be relieved of the annual contribution, approximately £150,000 sterling, or Rs. 20 lakhs, at present payable towards the military and political administration. (2) The right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be maintained. (3) His Majesty’s Government would maintain the existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place. From their own point of view the abandonment of this policy would clearly in existing economic conditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade. (4) His Majesty’s Government would do their utmost to maintain the present standard of administration and would not impose any additional taxa tion unless such a course became, m their opinion, absolutely necessary. (5) A proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place. (6) No racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty’s Government.— Ends. 17960/33 [No. 36]. No. 13.

Since the interests of the large Arab community may be profoundly affected by the decision as to future arrangements which is shortly to be taken, it seems essential that an effective statement of Arab opinion as free as possible from misleading pro paganda should be forthcoming. His Majesty’s Government would suggest therefore that Chief Commissioner should take such steps as he deems most suitable to elicit genuine opinion of Arab community and their leaders, since Reilly fears that if left to themselves Arab population may be diffident about offering any opinion on the question of transfer. 3.

His Majesty’s Government have recently received representations from different communities among inhabitants of Aden as well as from certain quarters in India expressing their various views in regard to the transfer of the administration of Aden from the control of the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government.

The ACTING RESIDENT to the SECRETARY OF STATE. (Received 31st July, 1933.) (Secret.) (No. 171.) Sir, The Residency, Aden, 19th July, 1933. 1 have the honour to forward herewith, for your information, a copy of a despatch No. C/403, dated the 15th July, 1933, that I have addressed to the Govern ment of India on the subject of the proposed transfer of the Administration of Aden to the control of His Majesty’s Government. I have, &amp;c., R. S. CHAMPION, Acting Resident, &amp;c. Enclosure in No. 19. (Secret.) (No. C. 403.) Sir, The Residency, Aden, 15th July, 1933. I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 1489 of the 17th June, 1933, on the subject of the proposed transfer of the Administration of Aden to the control of His Majesty’s Government. 2. During the past week, a sufficient time having elapsed since the publication of the Announcement on the 20th June, 1933, I have invited the opinions of thirteen leading and influential Arabs on this matter, in a series of private and informal inter views. My informants were especially selected as representative of religious (Moslem), commercial (wholesale, retail, and transit trade), and real estate interests in Aden; and they are well qualified to voice the genuine opinion of all classes of the Arab community, owing both to their own comparatively enlightened understanding of the issues involved and to their influence over and acquaintance with the less intelligent attitude of the lower orders. 3. I he impression that I have received from these frank and friendly conversa tions is that the Arab community in Aden as a whole are satisfied and content under the existing political and administrative conditions, but that they view with grave mis giving the possibility of “ Indianization ” of the government of Aden consequent upon constitutional changes in India. Representing an overwhelming racial majority in territory that is geographically and historically an integral part of Arabia, they fear the subordination of Arab and Indian interests, and they forsee an increase in the commercial domination of Indian firms in Aden, if the Settlement is to remain under the control of an increasingly self-governing India.18 4. On the other hand, while they are acquiescent in the prospect of transfer and reliant on the honesty of the intentions and purposes of His Majesty sOovern- ment, they are characteristically apprehensive of change, and die not con ic tn 1 a that which is now contemplated will be to their social or material advantage. As one of my visitors expressed himself—“ We are warm in this tire, hhall we pet taps be burned in another? ” 5. The following particular points have emerged in the course ot my conversa- &lt;C tions in regard to the Announcement: , Condition 1 .— There is a “ bazaar rumour ” widely believed among uneducated Arabs, that the annual contribution of Rs.20 lakhs of which India would be ic icved, will be borne by Aden. Enlightened classes are not free from this suspicion, and it has been suggested to me that this misapprehension should be removed by the issue of a further and clearer Announcement in this regard. • Conditions 3 and 4.—While intelligent opinion understands that His Majesty s Government would be unable, at the present, or perhaps at any, juncture^ to bind themselves unconditionally to the maintenance of the existing fiscal policv m Aden, there is general disappointment that a more definite statement has not been made on these issues. Miscellaneous. —Religious circles profess to be preoccupied with the need for the administration of the Sher’ia Law in Aden according to the Shafe’i doctrine, which is followed by practically all the Arab Moslem community. It appears, how ever, that Arab opinion generally is satisfied with Indian Law in that respect which fellows the Hanafi doctrine; and I think that the contention of the ’Ulema represents a pious hope for the future, rather than an argument for or against transfer. 6. The publication of the Announcement has had the desired effect of crystalliz ing the issues at stake, and has tended to confine controversy to the conditions with which it dealt; and while it has not prevented the exchange of irresponsible rumours in the bazaars, there is no evidence that these rumours have their source in propaganda directed by (Indian commercial) circles which are still uncompromisingly hostile to transfer. 7. The sense of this appreciation has been generally confirmed by official and unofficial observers whom I have consulted in the matter, and whose activities bring them into close touch with the Arab community in Aden. The situation will continue to be closelv watched, and developments will be reported to you from time to time. 8. I have addressed copies of this despatch to the Secretaries of State for India and for the Colonies. I have, &amp;c., The Secretary to the Government of India. R. S. Champion. Foreign and Political Department. Simla. Chief Commissioner. 17960/33 '[No. 44]. No. 20. MR. J. G. LAITHWAITE (India Office) to MR. H. R. COWELL (Colonial Office). My dear Cowell, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l, 12th August, 1933. I enclose, in accordance with his request, copy of a letter from Reilly which is self-explanatory, and of the answer I have sent to him. If it was convenient for you, do you not think that it might be rather a good thing to have a talk on Tuesday afternoon, as suggested, in wffiich we could run rapidly through the points he has raised in his letter of 10th August? Yours, &amp;c., J. G. LAITHWAITE. Enclosure 1 in No. 20. Dear Laithwaite. Summerset, Lymington, Hants, 10th August, 1933. In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are :— 1. Income tax from firms doing business at Aden which at present is collected by the Government of India elsewhere than at Aden, e.g., Calcutta or Bombay. —There19 are many such cases, the most important probably being the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany, which does a very large business at Aden, but whose income tax is paid, not at Aden, but at Calcutta. In the event of separation it (and other firms in the same position) ought to pay in respect of its Aden business to the new Aden Government. 2. Post Office and Telephone receipts and expenditure. —These are now dealt with in India, and we do not know at Aden whether these services are run at a profit W or at a loss, I hope the former, in which case the profit should accrue to the new Aden Government. 3. Printing and sale of stamps. —If Aden becomes a Crown Colony it will pre sumably have its own stamps, and the cost of printing them and the proceeds from their sale will be items in the new Aden budget. 4. Mail contract .—The mail steamers between England and India must at present call at Aden under the terms of their contract with the Government of India. If Aden is separated from India an arrangement for its mail service will presumably be made by the Imperial Government. 5. Currency. —In view of the close business connexion between Aden and India it will be convenient if Aden continues to use Indian currency, and an agreement for the supply of currency can, I suppose, be made with the Government of India. 6. Treasury and Finance. —If Aden becomes a Crown Colony it will have its separate financial arrangements and separate budget, and this will probably necessitate the strengthening of its financial staff by the appointment of a Treasurer, who might also control the income tax and Salt and Excise Departments. This is a matter which will require careful consideration by the new administration. I should be strongly opposed to the appointment of any new officials who are not absolutely necessary, and the new organization ought to be carried out as economically as possible. 7. Audit. —Aden accounts are now' audited by the Accountant-General, Bombay; and new arrangements for audit will have to be made. This may involve the appoint ment of a local Auditor, or alternatively, the Home Treasury may be able to undertake the audit. Here again the need for economy as well as efficiency ought to be borne in mind. 8. Neiv Laws and Enactments. —In my opinion all existing (Indian) laws and enactments ought to remain in force, and the Indian Civil and Criminal Codes and Procedure ought to be retained. But it will be necessary from time to time to make new laws, enactments, and regulations and to modify old ones. Such changes will probably be infrequent, and I hope that it will not be necessary to appoint a new official for the purpose of drawing them up. But the method and machinery for doing so must be considered. 9. Local Bodies. —These are the Aden Port Trusts (constituted under a Govern ment of Bombay Act of 1888) and the Aden Settlement, which deals with municipal matters under the control of the Chief Commissioner. Each of these bodies has its own revenue and expenditure, and in my opinion they should continue their separate existence as at present, and should not be merged into the new local administration. 10. Lighthouses. —There are four in the territory to be included in the new Colony—two at Aden and two at Perim. The two at Aden are managed by the Aden Port Trust, but the Government of India pay for half the upkeep of one of them. The two at Perim are maintained by the Government of India, to whom lighthouse dues are paid. If Aden is separated from India the responsibility and expenditure of the Government of India will presumably be undertaken by the Imperial Government, perhaps with a contribution from the Government of India, as the lights are largely used by ships engaged in Indian trade. It would not be right to make Aden bear these charges unless it receives lighthouse dues sufficient to cover them, and the imposition of dues at Aden ought to be avoided as much as possible, as it tends to drive shipping away to the rival French and Italian ports in the neighbourhood. 11. Ecclesiastical. —Aden at present forms part of the diocese of Bombay, and is served by chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Establishment. I think this arrange ment ought to be allowed to continue, at any rate for a time. 12. Lunatic Asylum. —There is none at Aden, and lunatics are now sent to India. There are too few of them to justify the establishment of a local asylum, and it would be convenient if the Government of India would permit the existing practice to continue, in return, presumably, for a small agreed payment by the new Aden administration. 13. Rate of Income Tax. —I consider that the Indian rates of income tax ought to be continued, and that they ought to apply to officials employed at Aden as well as to the general public, these officials paying their tax to the Aden administration, and not to the British Treasury.20 If I had a typewriter with me I should send a copy of this letter to Cowell, as the Colonial Office will be concerned with some of the points I have mentioned as much as, or even more than, the India Office. If you are taking up these questions with the Colonial Office perhaps you will send him a copy. In that case 1 shall be very grateful if you can send a copy to me also for reference. I expect to be in London for a day or two this month, and for about a fortnight next month, and I return to Aden in October. I can call on you when I am in London ^ if you would like to discuss these matters with me. Yours, &amp;c., B. R. Reilly. Enclosure 2 in No. 20. Dear Reilly, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l, 12th August, 1933. Many thanks for your letter of 10th August and the very valuable list of points for consideration in connexion with the separation of Aden. 1 have had copies made, one of which I now enclose, and am sending one to Cowell, as you asked me to. I have also given one to Walton. We hope to see you at the Middle East Sub-Committee on Tuesday morning to discuss relations with the Imam. Would it be convenient for you to have a talk on the other points dealt with in your letter of 10th August on Tuesday afternoon with Cowell, Walton, and myself at any time that would suit you? If so, we might have a preliminary discussion then. Yours, &amp;c., J. G. Laithwaite. Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Reilly, C.I.E., O.B.E., Summerset, Lymington, Hants. 17960/33 [No. 45]. No. 21. MR, J. G. LAITHWAITE (India Office) to MR. H. R. COWELL (Colonial Office). [Answered by No. 24. ! My dear Cowell, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l, 14th August, 1933. As you will have seen from paragraph 5 of Champion’s despatch of 15th July, No. C. 403,* to the Government of India, the rumour appears to have gained ground in Aden that the annual contribution of Rs. 20 lakhs of which India would be relieved in the event of separation would in future be borne by Aden. We think it important to scotch this as soon as possible and suggest that, if you and the Treasure see no objection, Champion and the Government of India might be authorized to issue a dementi to the effect that the annual contribution of Rs. 20 lakhs of which India woulo be relieved would in future be borne by Imperial revenues, and that no additional charge would be imposed on the revenues of Aden. Will you be so kind as to let me knowlf you agree. I enclose copy of a letter I am sending to Grieve. Yours, &amp;c., J. G. LAITHWAITE. Enclosure in No. 21.

REILLY (Resident, Aden), MR. H. R. COWELL (Colonial Office), AND MR. J. C. WALTON AND MR. J. G. LAITHWAITE (India Office). (The references in the Note below are to the points raised in Colonel Reilly’s demi-official letter of 10th August, 1933.* Colonel Reilly’s demi-official letter of 10th August, 1933, was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. Point 1. Income-Tax arrangements in the Event of Separation. — Mr. Cowell said that Grown Colonies as a rule were responsible for, their own income-tax arrange ments and fixed their own rate of income-tax. There would probably be much to be said for fixing (under a special Aden Ordinance, to be made by the new Aden Crown Colony Government) the present Indian rate of income-tax as the rate in future to prevail in Aden. Colonel Reilly emphasized that if and so long as Aden was to continue to draw staff from India the question of income-tax would be one of real importance. So far as budgetting was concerned it would be important to reach an understanding well in advance of actual separation as to whether firms such as the Anglo-Petroleum Oil Company, the shipping companies and the salt interests, which did a large business in Aden, but whose income-tax was at present paid not at Aden but at Calcutta or elsewhere in India, should pay in respect of their Aden business to the new Aden Government. It was agreed that this point should be taken up. 2. Post Office and Telephone Receipts and Expenditure. —It was agreed that the Government of India should be asked to indicate, if possible, to what extent these services were at present run at a profit or at a loss, with a view to the necessary information being available in connexion with the framing of the Aden budget. 3. Printing and Sale of Stamps. — Mr. Cowell agreed that if and when Aden was established as a Crown Colony it would issue its own stamps and that the cost of their printing and the proceeds from their sale would be items in the new Aden budget. 4. Mail Contract. —It was agreed that the India Office should ascertain whether Colonel Reilly’s statement that under the terms of their contract with the Govern ment of India the mail steamers between England and India must at present call at Aden was correct. It was also generally agreed that the simplest course would be to allow existing arrangements, if the Government of India agree, to remain un changed, at any rate for the balance of the period of the Government of India’s present mail contract. 5. Currency. —It was agreed that, at any rate for the time being, much the best arrangement would be that, if no objection was seen by the Government of India, Aden should continue to use Indian currency, arrangements for the supply of the necessary currency being made with the Government of India. Mr. Cowell men tioned that in Mauritius for a very long period Indian currency had remained current, and that precedents were not lacking for action on the lines suggested. G. Treasury and Finance. —Mr. Cowell indicated that if Aden became a Crown Colony the colonial administration would be responsible for the annual prepara tion and submission of a budget. Colonel Reilly stated that the financial staff was not at the moment very strong and that what he had in mind was that on the separation of Aden a gazetted officer should be appointed as Treasurer. He should also be in charge of the Income-tax and Salt and Excise Departments. He was opposed to placing any heavier burden on the finances of the new 7 colony than could be avoided, but22 part., at any rate, of the expenses of the official in question might be met by the suppression of existing posts whose duties would in future be performed by mm. Thus, it might be possible to abolish the existing Income-tax officer. Mr. Oowell said that he saw no difficulty in providing an official of the necessary status from the Colonial Service. The type of man wanted would probably be a good Assistant Treasurer in a large colony who would in the ordinary course be able to hope for appointment as Treasurer in a large colony. He would inquire or the P' Personnel Division of the Colonial Office as to the probable rate of pay it would be necessarv to offer. Colonel Reilly emphasized that it was important to select for this post a man of experience and some strength of character, who could assist the Resident in rejecting doubtful demands from units of the Aden administration. 7. Audit. — Mr. Cowell stated that it would be possible, without any difficulty, to place the Aden accounts under the Director of Colonial Audit, who would send over once or twice a year an auditor, perhaps from Past Africa. (At piesent Somaliland and the Seychelles are run jointly for this purpose.) A contribution to his salary would probably have to be made from Aden. It would be unnecessary to appoint a special local auditor, though a local audit clerk would probably be necessary. 8. New Laws and Enactments. —There was general agreement as to the desir- abilitv of retaining in force all existing Indian laws and enactments, including the Indian Civil and Criminal Codes and Procedure. There was also general agreement as to the desirability of some elasticity. While changes would probably be infrequent it was important that it should be possible to make them if and when occasion aiosi without, e.g., the necessity of passing an Act of Parliament or the like. It was thought that the simplest course would be to provide in the initial Act of Parliament oi Order in Council that all laws, &amp;c., already in force in Aden should continue in force until otherwise provided : and to give the Governor power, with the consent of the Crown, to enact laws. The concurrent power of the Crown to legislate by Order in Council would be retained, in accordance with the usual practice in Crown Colonies. Mr. Cowell mentioned that in certain Colonies and Protectorates, e.g.. St. Helena, Gibraltar, and Somaliland, the Governor, who had no legislature, made his own laws, the simplest thing would be that if there was no urgency in regard to any law or enactment the Resident should ask the Colonial Office for advice on drafts prepared with the assistance of the Judicial Assistant at Aden. In cases of real urgency or emergency he would have to do the best he could, leaving any errors or loopholes to be remedied later. 9. Local Bodies. —It was agreed that the Aden Port Trust and the Aden Settle ment should continue their separate existence and should not be merged in the new local administration. 10. Lighthouses. —The Colonial Office undertook to take up the question of the future arrangements in connexion with lighthouses with the Board of Trade. The simplest arrangement would probably be that the Board of Trade should take them over, possibly with a contribution, as suggested by the Resident, from the Govern ment of India. The Resident emphasized that from the point of view of maintaining the attractiveness of Aden as a port, it was most important that the light dues should not at any rate be raised above the level at present charged by the Government of India. The result of any increase might well be to drive traffic to Jibouti or else where. 11. Ecclesiastical. —It was agreed that the possibility of allowing Aden to remain part of the Diocese of Bombay and to be served by Chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Department should be investigated by the India Office, if necessary with the Govern ment of India; and that unless any serious objection proved to exist, this would be the most satisfactory course. 12. Lunatic Asylum. —It was agreed that the best course would be, if the Government of India saw no objection, to permit the existing practice of sending lunatics from Aden to India to continue, possibly for a small agreed payment per head bv the new Aden administration. 13. Rate of Income-tax. —This was covered by the note under head (1) above. The Colonial Office indicated that if and when the salaries of officials at Aden were naid from revenue raised in Aden (including any general grant-in-aid from the Treasury) there would be no question of any application of British income-tax to officials. So long, however, as the Treasury provided anv individual salaries, those salaries would be liable to British income-tax. It would be desirable, therefore, to arrange the estimates initially so that the salaries of the Residents and all other officials were borne on Aden revenues.— * No. 21. f Enclosure in No. 23. 23 14. Colonel Reilly, in addition, raised the question of the future of the Government buildings, &amp;c., at Aden.

This is in reply to your letter of the 14th instant, on the subject of the proposed transfer of Aden to His Majesty’s Government. We agree that it is desirable to scotch the rumour which appears to be current in Aden that the annual contribution of Rs. 20 lakhs (£150,000) of which India would be relieved in the event of separation, would in future be borne by Aden. We have no objection, therefore, to your authorizing the Government of India to issue a state ment to the effect that the annual contribution of Rs. 20 lakhs would in future be borne by Imperial revenues, and that no additional charge on this account would be imposed on the revenues of Aden. As regards the possibility of increased taxation in Aden in future, the Secretary of State has, of course, stated in his announcement in the House of Commons on 19th ■Tune, 1933, that His Majesty’s Government would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became in their opinion absolutely necessary.

No. 26. MINUTES REGARDING THE APPOINTMENT OF A TREASURER. In connexion with the contemplated transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office we have discussed with the Resident the question of the appointment of a Treasurer. Under existing circumstances there is no Treasury officer of standing in Aden, since the accounts are kept in India and there are only sub-accountants in Aden. It will be necessary in the future to have a Treasury officer of experience who will be in a position to advise the Resident on financial questions. It is, of course, too early yet to consider details of the appointment, but for the purposes of estimating the cost of administration the Resident would be glad to know, roughly, what salary would be required to obtain an officer from elsewhere in our service for the appointment of Treasurer in Aden. According to the Colonial Office list the annual expenditure of the Settlement is in the neighbourhood of £90,000. H. R. COWELL, 16th May, 1933. The annual expenditure is, roughly, equivalent to that of St. Lucia, where, after some argument with the Treasury, the salary of Treasurer has been fixed at £500- £550. But the Windwards must be a much more attractive place to live in than is Aden, and I suppose very much less expensive. Much must depend upon the general conditions of the appointment, but I should say that a salary of not less than £700 would be necessary. The third man in the Cyprus Treasury, the Chief Accountant, H. C. Ley, is on £400-£600; the third man in Palestine on £550-£750; and the junior Assistant Treasurer on £300-£550. In Somaliland the Treasurer draws £800, and the Assistant Treasurer is on a scale rising to £700. In Seychelles the Treasurer’s salary is Rs. 7,450 + Rs. 1,000+ Rs. 500 for quarters. The expendituie of these Dependencies is much larger, but, particularly if, as it would seem from the attached particulars, salary is likely to be liable to United Kingdom income-tax, j: I don’t think we could find a man for less than £700 (without quarters). Possible candidates would be :— H. C. Ley, Chief Accountant, Treasury Department, Cyprus; K. C.

B. ACHESON, 28th August, 1933. I contemplate that the salary will be paid from Aden funds, and will not be liable to United Kingdom income-tax, but only to local income-tax at the rate now current in India. In the circumstances, could we provisionally suggest a salary of £600 to £700? I think so. Colonel Reilly informed. H. R, COWELL, 29th August, 1933. S. ROBINSON. 29th August, 1933. H. R.

Can you estimate and let me know what, if any, is the balance of revenue in respect of Aden over the cost of the civil administration? 3. A misleading impression might be caused by Sethna’s reported quotation of Bray’s remark on 29th January, 1929, if this was quoted out of its context and without regard to circumstances in which it was made. Obvious meaning of Bray’s statement was that total transfer, including civil administration, had been abandoned as a solution of old post-ivar controversy as to future of Aden because this had been settled by His Majesty’s Government’s decision of December, 1926, and transfer of civil administration had thus ceased in 1929 to be in question. Since 1929 the conditions of the problem of course have been entirely changed by the approaching constitutional changes in India Bray’s promise of prior consultation before transfer would have been meaningless if he had meant that all idea of transfer had been abandoned for ever. 17960/33 [No. 57].

Future of Aden was discussed in Council of State on 31st August, on resolution that communique of 20th June, be taken into consideration, moved by Sir Fazl-i-Husain, who stated that the official members would not take part in the debate and announced that, if a transfer (? was, omitted) effected, His Majesty’s Govern ment would meet contribution of Rs.20 lakhs hitherto borne by India. 2. Amendment was moved by Sir Phiroze Sethna to the effect that Council while no longer objecting to the transfer to Imperial control of political and military administration as at present exists, is definitely of opinion that civil administration should not be transferred to the Colonial Office but should remain with the Govern ment of India or be retransferred to Bombay. Part 2. Dealing with the communique, Sethna referred to the interview which the Aga Khan’s deputation had with you recently, and said difficulty of including Aden in future federation is not insurmountable, particularly if administration is retransferred to Bombay; against a saving of 20 lakhs India would lose about 10 lakhs revenue from salt, income-tax and super-tax; assurances regarding racial legislation and segregation valueless, and the position of Indians in Aden would become the same as in Kenya and other colonies. Continuing, he enumerated the following objections to separation :— (1) Sentimental connexion—prosperity due to Indian enterprise. (2) Somaliland ports were prosperous prior to the transfer from Bombay to the Colonial Office after which, higher taxation, due to the more costly administration, drove out the Indian traders and killed trade—same would happen to Aden. (3) Separation will lead to increase in the number of official appointments with consequent rise in taxation. (4) Indian trade with Aden will be lost owing to the inevitable departure of Indian merchants. Part 3. (5) Ruin of salt industry. Proceeding, said Aden Arabs, Jews, and Indians were opposed to separation, and concluded by expressing hope that the Government would respect the wishes of the' Legislature if against transfer.* No. 28. t No. 30. 27 3. Other speakers, who with one exception opposed separation, traversed the same ground, only additional points being:— (1) Indian merchants developed business in Aden in the belief that it would remain under India. (2) Aden and Bombay opinion opposed separation. (3) His Majesty’s Government should repay India’s expenditure, at least twenty ^ lakhs yearly for the last 95 years. (4) Aden people can voice grievances in the Indian Legislature without difficulty but could not do so easily in England. (5) Aden no more difficult to merge in the federation than the Andamans. 4. Sethna’s motion was adopted. Record of proceedings w r ill be sent to you soon as possible. Matter will be discussed Legislative Assembly, Friday, 8th September, and report of the proceedings will be telegraphed to you.

In connexion with the Aden transfer question I remember to have read in a Bombay paper a few months ago, what purports to be the views of the Government of India, from which it would appear that the dual control is intended to be retained even after the civil administration of this territory passes under the control of the Colonial Office. The High Court of Bombay under the Government’s scheme, as reported, will function as a superior court, as at present, to which appeals fiom Aden would lie, presumably because law and justice will continue to be a responsibility of the Indian Government to be administered through its officers in Aden. In other words there will be Colonial Government without Colonial courts which, if seriously intended to be put into practice, will be, perhaps, without a parallel in any other part of the Empire. • 2. It is quite possible that the views of Government have not been properly reported and as one interested in the future of Aden, I should be much obliged to be. told if the transfer is intended to be outright and from which date it is to take effect; whether the machinery of law will be Colonial or Indian, and what is more important, so far as this writer is concerned, whether legal practitioners from India will be allowed to appear before the newly-constituted courts or will be debarred as in British Somaliland.

WALTON (India Office) to MR. H. R. COWELL (Colonial Office). [Answered by No. 35.] Dear Cowell, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l, 10th October, 1933. I enclose a copy* of the debate in the Indian Council of State on 31st August on the question of the transfer of Aden. We are much disappointed with the result of this debate and the subsequent debate which took place in the Legislative Assembly on 18th September (the report of which will be sent to you in due course). We had hoped that the Government of India, with the announcement of 19th June as their brief, might be able to induce the Legislature at least to take a less one-sided view of the question. But the Government of India—in the debate in the Council of State, at any rate—appear to have adopted a purely laodicean attitude. The results of the debates, though they are not likely to affect the final decision, will make matters a bit more difficult. Our Secretary of State anticipates that the Indian delegates in the Joint Select Committee will raise the question some time during the autumn session of the Committee, and he is anxious to prepare a good case to meet them. We are preparing a brief for him. There are two points in the debate in the Council of State on which you will probably be able to assist us :— (1) On page 103 you will see that Sethna entirely distorted the meaning of assurance (6) in the announcement of 19th June. The meaning of that assurance was, of course, that a proportion of the administrative personnel at Aden would continue to belong to the Indian Service for some years. Sethna appears to have misunderstood it as meaning that only a proportion of the Indians at present serving among the administrative personnel would be retained for some years, and that the remainder would be “ sent away.’ You will remember that we had wind of a possible misapprehension of this sort, and discussed the matter with you some time ago. It may be desirable to make it clear that what is meant is this, while the higher political appointments (in which officers of the Indian Political Department, but not Indians, are concerned) would be staffed from the Colonial Service on the expiry of the terms of the present incumbents, there is no intention that transfer should make any difference to the conditions on which Indians are at present serving in other posts, and that the position of such Indians actually holding appointments at Aden will remain as at present. You will remember that the appointment of Muhammad asm Khan, the Registrar of the Resident’s Court, was a case in point. (2) On page 114 vou will see that Sir Muhammad Akbar Khan (the onl\ member of the Council of State who spoke in favour of the transfer) stated that he supported separation on the clear understanding that Indians . . “ should not be stopped from entering the Aden Protectorate as is the custom now.” In order to make this point clear, could the Secretary of State, if he wishes, say that transfer will make no difference in this respect to the present position (which is, I understand from Keilly, that Indians have the same freedom of movement to and from the Protectorate as other non-Arab inhabitants of the Settlement)?

As regards the two points in the debate which you mention, I have to reply as follows:— (1) Your announcement of the 19th June did not go as far as we were quite ready to go in regard to the retention of administrative personnel, as you will see on reference to the minutes of the Aden Committee of the 10th February.* We should be prepared to give an assurance that, in the event of the transfer of Aden, all Indian administrative personnel in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent, and that it was intended that when vacancies occurred, though there would be a gradual substitution of officers of the Colonial Service in the Aden Service, Indians and officers of the Indian Political Depart ment would remain eligible for appointment to such posts. The posts of Kesident and Political Secretary would be matters for special considera tion. In giving this assurance we are assuming that the Indian conditions of service contain provisions for the retrenchment of officers or the abolition of offices somewhat similar to the provisions in our service. It would be understood that all newcomers of the Aden Service would be appointed on definite terms, and would have no claim to Indian conditions of service unless these were specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment. (2) We can give an assurance that Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter the Aden Protectorate under precisely the same conditions as any other British subjects. 25th November. No. 0661.

As regards paragraph 4 of the Government of India’s telegram of 17th November, we should be glad to know what you think of Sir B. L. Mitter’s point. Though we take the view here that the Indian fear of racial discrimination is already really answered, as was pointed out in the Secretary of State’s memorandum, by the categorical assurance in the statement of 19th June, it may be that Sir B. Mitter feels that Indians may be apprehensive that the guarantee of no racial legislation may still leave some loophole for discrimination in practice, e.q., in regard to trade. We are aware that there would be no grounds for any such apprehension, but, in order to meet the point, it might be desirable, if you are able to agree, to inform the Government of India that there will be no racial discrimination, either in legislation or in adminis tration. lours, &amp;c., J.

Reference our telegram of the 3rd instant, 2400 (sic) Aden. 2. Having regard to the views expressed by all sections of Indian opinion in recent debates in the Assembly and Council of State, we strongly urge that wdien the future of Aden is considered, strength of genuine Indian sentiment in favour of retaining it as part of British India should be recognised. This sentiment can be met by maintaining broad features of the present arrangements under which the defence of Aden and relations with adjoining protectorate are a responsibility of His Majesty’s Government, while the civil administration alone is concern of the Government of India. We see no serious difficulty in carrying forward these arrangements into the new constitution. Civil administration would, as now, be entrusted to Chief Com missioner as officer subordinate to the federal Government, but subject to convention that the officer appointed by His Majesty’s Government to hold charge of the protec torate and political relations with the interior would automatically be appointed Chief Commissioner by the federal Government. We trust that His Majesty’s Government may see their way to accept the arrangement on these lines, which would leave them free to protect themselves in any way, both as regards the defence of Aden and its use as strategic point. So little is involved in the civil administration of the town of Aden, that it would seem politically most undesirable simply, for the purpose of effecting its transfer from the future federal Government, to embitter Indian feeling in a matter in which practical issues are of such minor importance. We would draw particular attention to this aspect of the case. It may perhaps be necessary at some future date for His Majesty’s Government to assume civil control of Aden, but to do so now would we feel be most unfortunate. We are at present preparing to hand over to India a large measure of control of her own affairs and, in so doing, are demonstrating our trust in her future willingness to maintain the Imperial connexion. If, at the same time, we take from her what small measure of control she still exercises over the one Imperial link with which she is directlv con nected, we shall incur ihe obvious criticism that our professions of trust are meaningless and that w T e do not believe either in her power or will to remain within the Empire, such action on our part will, we feel, engender widespread resentment in India and will undoubtedly be a most unfortunate precursor to the introduction of the new constitution. 3. His Excellency the Viceroy, who was absent in Assam when the above opinion was formulated, concurs in these views which represent those of the majority of his Council. 4. Should His Majesty’s Government approve of these proposals, we will con sider in detail the question of including Aden in our proposals for the Chief Com missioner’s provinces in the new Constitution.Secretary of State for India to Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. (Secret.) Telegram. and 30th October. 2658. Your telegram dated 12tli October 38 C. Aden. 2. I have given fullest and most sympathetic consideration to your views have closely studied debates in Legislative Assembly and Council of State. But while I fully appreciate your arguments, and recognise, too, that effect of debates must unfortunately be to crystallise opposition to transfer and afford a grievance, I remain of opinion that the only satisfactory solution of the Aden problem is that the Settle ment should be separated from India not later than the date of Federation. Importance must of course attach to expression of opinion by Legislature. But it is common ground between us that its resolutions have no binding force in this matter; and fact that their resolutions were adopted in absence of any guidance from Government or any elaboration of the strong case for a transfer and the substantial safeguards offered by His Majesty’s Government makes it necessary to some extent to discount opinion recorded. 3. To remove any possibility of misunderstanding 1 think it desirable to elaborate in greater detail than I have hitherto done arguments, which are in my view decisive, in favour of immediate transfer. They are substantially:— (a) Anomaly of including in new constitutional arrangements area already to some extent under Imperial control, inseparable in practice from Aden Protectorate for which India has ceased to be in any way responsible, geographically remote from India and predominantly Arab. Complete divorce between civil administration of Settlement on the one hand and political and military control of Settlement and Pro tectorate on the other would be impracticable. Existing condominium works efficiently only with some difficulty and in practice because in the last resort decision of all questions arising rests in His Majesty’s Government either directly or through Govern ment of India. This would no longer be to the same extent the case under the new constitution. For defence purposes distinction between Protectorate and Settlement will in any event be impossible and it is therefore essential that defence of the latter as well as of former should continue to be direct responsibility of His Majesty’s Government. But if Settlement became part of Indian Federation a continuance of the present svstem whereby defence rests in His Majesty s Government in respect of tlic Settlement as well as of the Protectorate would be constitutionally anomalous and might give rise to most serious difficulties. Anomaly would be difficult if not impossible to 'defend effectively against criticism in Legislature and might lead to not illogical demand for retransfer of military control of Protectorate to Government of India. You will appreciate too practical awkwardness of criticism in Legislatiue of action at Aden of forces in no way under their control, e.g., in quelling riot. (b) If dual control is not abolished now it will be much more difficult to abolish it later once Settlement has become incorporated in Federation. Issue is one which must in my view be faced now or not at all. While I appreciate force of your argument for postponing decision objections seem to me overwhelming. (c) Indian population represents onlv one-eighth of population of settlement, though its financial interests are of course very important. As you will have seen from Chief Commissioner’s despatch No. 0.403 of 15th July last Arab community while well satisfied with existing system are gravely apprehensive of possibility of Indiamsa- tion at Aden, and of subordination of Arab to Indian interests under reforms. More over effective representation of Arab community in Indian legislature would be extremely difficult nor would it be easy to feel entire confidence even making all allowance for good will and fairness of legislature, that Indian might not preponderate over Arab interests in case of conflict. It is essential to give great weight in reaching present decision to interests of Arab inhabitants. + t? + (d) Strategic position of Aden and its importance from this aspect to Eastern Emp re -enerallv and not merely to any single unit is strong argument for control bv Home' Government and decisive objection from Parliamentary standpoint to reten tion of existing condominium under new constitution. 7 Assurances already given bv His Majesty’s Government in mv view cover all reasonable apprehensions, and T am disappointed at failure of legislature to recog- n e heir onerous character and at attempts of various speakers to distort them. T V f AnnrchenGons expressed in debate I have now secured however specific additional ^assurance from Colonial Office that in event of transfer Indian British sub- iects would be allowed to enter Protectorate under precisely same conditions as any other British subjects.34 0. Colonial Office are further prepared to give assurance that all Indian administrative personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent. When vacancies occurred (though there would be gradual substitution of Colonial Service officers) Indians would remain eligible for appoint ment though on definite terms to be agreed in each case and on basis of Indian con- ditions of service only if these were specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment. 6. On two further points arising out of debate I should like to add (a) that parallel with Somaliland drawn by Sethna was quite misleading. Somaliland ports have gone down because of inability of local administration, owing to unruly character of inhabitants, to levy any direct taxation with the result that administration depends entirely on import duties. Position at Aden is exactly the reverse as Aden is a free port and cost of administration is met by direct taxation. (b) Prominence of Salt question is understandable. But this is essentially a matter for the Indian Legislature, having regard to the Fiscal Convention. In view of solicitude shown in debate for commercial and other interests of Indians at Aden, Legislature may possiblv be responsive to any appeal made by Sethna and his friends on behalf of Aden salt manufacturers when question arises. _ 7. I will endeavour to take an opportunity in immediate future either in the Joint Committee or in discussion with Sethna and his friends to explain reasons for transfer and comprehensive character of assurances, and so to redress balance and emphasise true position. Meanwhile I shall be glad if you will urgently consider matter further, and let me have your observations by telegraph as early as possible.

Your telegram of the 30th ultimo, 2658, Aden. 2. W T e have considered most carefully points of view expressed in this telegram. Some of us are not prepared, in'spite of your arguments, to resile from attitude already expressed in our telegram of the 12th ultimo, 38 C, which gives local argu ments in favour of the retention of Aden by India. These arguments are admittedly based on sentiment, but, as we have already said, Indian sentiment is likely to prove a most important factor in regulating the relations between the future Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. Those of us who hold this point of view are not prepared to admit that practical difficulties against the retention of Aden settlement by India are so great as to outweigh advantages which would result from its inclusion in the Federation. The difficulties attendant on such a concession to Indian sentiment seem small, while its effect, at a time goodwill of informed Indian opinion in regard to new constitution is of considerable value, would be great. 3. On the other hand, some of us have been considerably impressed by your arguments. In particular, His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, who was not present when the question was under consideration in October, desires us to place on record his emphatic agreement with your point of view. In his opinion position at present is entirely anomalous. Aden is of too great importance to the Empire to be placed under divided control. The protectorate and settlement must, from the defence point of view, be solely under the Government of India or under His Majesty’s Government, and he is of opinion that, particularly in view of the transfer already effected of the defence of the protectorate to His Majesty’s Government, the only logical and possible course is to transfer complete control of the settlement as well. 4. Sir B. L. Mitter, who was also not present last month, concurs in the view that divided control is impossible and that, provided Indian interests are fully safe guarded, advantage lies in the transfer of complete control to His Majesty’s Govern ment. He presses, however, for a definite statement by His Majestv’s Government granting full safeguards for Indians against discrimination of any sort vis-a-vis European or other traders in Aden. 5. In these circumstances, it appears to us that decision must finally vest (sic, ? rest) with His Majesty’s Government. We have endeavoured in this, and in our previous telegram, to set before you local point of view. This point of view is entitled to the fullest consideration, but we feel that it is for His Majesty’s Govern-35 * No. 36. f No. 37. men! to decide whether it is sufficient to outweigh the considerations of imperial interests, many of which are beyond our purview. 6. We feel, therefore, that it is unnecessary for us to enter into a detailed consideration of the points raised in your telegram under reference. In regard, however, to salt interests raised in paragraph No. 6 (b), we would point out that w r e see no reason to suppose that future Indian Legislatures will assume an attitude A different from that described in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Finance Department’s letter C.55 G.L.33, of the 13th February, 1933. 17960 33 [No. 75].

(3) That there shall be no racial distinctions in the view of the law. (4) That preference be given to Arabs for emplovment in Government service. (5) That matters of marriage and divorce be conducted by a Moslem Qadhi chosen by the leading men of the town, and that questions of inheritance and Waqfs be decided in accordance with the Islamic Sheri’a law. (6) That the rights and interests of the Arabs be maintained by appointing an adequate number of them in proportion to their numbers in the town as members of both the local Settlement and Port Trust Boards.(7) lhat an advisory council to the Governor be established, on which the number of members representing the Arabs should be in proportion to the number of Arabs in the town. The expression of views by this Council to the Governor on all matters relating to the town and its people would be of great importance as it would be the only medium for discussion and assist ance between the people and the Governor.

Few Buildings ♦ There is a shortage“Tn houses in Aden and it has for some time been difficult to arrange for residences for all the Superior staff* This deficiency has been aggravated by the increase in the number of Colonial Service Officers in Aden and will be still more felt when the Treasurer is appointed. Few houses are required for the following officerss- (1) The Treasurer. (2) The Commandant of Police (who at present has to live in a hotel). (3) The Frontier Officer (who at present rents a house belonging to the Settlement which is much needed to house the Municipal Engineer). (4) The Second Political Officer (who at present has no hous e). In addition the house at present occupied by the District and Sessions Judge is old and in | very bad repair, ani should be reconstructed. Other buildings that are much needed are:- (1) to house the Government Secondary School (thus relieving the present congestion in the main Government School buildings)• (2) a substantial addition to the Residency. This is at present a single storey bungalow, rooms in which are large but too few in number. An addition ta of a second storey would add very greatly to the convenience and comfort aid appearance of the official residence of the Governor, and will be of great assistance to him in his official entertainments and in accommodating distinguished visitors to Aden. (3) a further extension to the Residency Office (Secretariat) Building. The addition recently made has relieved the congestion as far as officers are concerned, but not as regards the clerical staff. The Confidential Clerk works in a very small room, which is crowded with Confidential records, and his assistant has to work in the general office. There is no Visitors Room, and visitors have to wait on the verandah. Most of the Residency Office furniture is very old,and needs replacement. (4) an extension to the Court and Treasury Building, in which the existing accommodation is very inadequate. _The Civil Secretary and First Political Officer now live in privately owned rented houses* This is not a satisfactory arrangement as the landlords frequently fail to keep the houses in proper repair and as the officers concernec are liable to notices to quit. It would be preferable if these houses were owned by Government and I am in favour of their being purchased and put into proper condition* In my opinion the Governor should have an official motor launch. At present I have none, and distinguished visitors, of whom many pass through Aden, have to be brought ashore in a launch borrowed either from the Air Gxficer Commanding or from the Aden Port Trust or in the Police launch. I suggest for consideration that His Majesty’s Government should make a special grant on the occasion of the transfer to enable these requirements to be met, and so to assist Aden in making a creditable start under its new form of Administration.« IHDIA PI- XC , , . !• Bth July, 1936.

A member of the Indian Civil Service may retire on an annuity of £1000 after 25 years' total service, of which 21 years must be 4 active service, and must retire after 35 years' service. In the and Inferior Services, retiring i pension is granted only after 30 years' service. Certain members of certain Services (at present the All-India Services, but the categories will be extended on the introduction of Provincial Autonomy) have the privilege ol retiring on proportionate pension whatever their length of service. In addition to these classes of pensions there are invalid pensions and pensions granted on abolition of office. If a Government servant is retained in the service of Government in India beyond the age for superannuation, his pension is withheld until he finally quits the Service. If he is re-employed on Government service in India after retirement, the turm- varies according to the class of pension he draws and the circumstances of the case. If he ^ is appointed after retirement from the Indian Service to a position in Colonial Service, there is, with one exception, no power in Indian regulations under which his pension^may ^ be reduced or withheld. The pension of an officer who retires on proportionate pension is however, if he obtains employment/ IW 1 2 . employment in another Government Department before or within 2 years after retirement, liable to suspension in whole or in part. It might be added that a Government servant would probably not be permitted to retire on retiring pension in order to draw such pension in addition to his pay from the Colonial Service. In such a case he would be transferred to the Colonial Service and,on eventual retirement therefrom, hie would be treated on the analogy of the IJui es made under the Superannuation Acts by the Treasury in 1911. Subject to what has been stated above with regard to withholding pension, an officer to whom the Premature Retirement Rules apply may be allowed to retire on proportionate pension even if he were taking up a Colonial appointment on retirement, but if he were in employment on foreign service terms at the time of his application, permission to retire would be refused. In such a case the officer would be required, if it were desired that he should remain in Colonial Service, to continue on foreign service terms78127/36. 1st July, 1936. My dear Clauson, You telephoned a day or two ago to give us some information^for which we had asked about the pensionable position of Indian officials who are entitled to pensions from India and who may be employed at Aden after the transfer. I understood the position to be that in the case of an Indian official who retired at the normal age of retirement and subsequently took employment under a Government other than the Government of India (for example, under the Aden Colonial Administration), there was no pov/er to stop his pension and that he would therefore continue to draw it while in his new employment. If, however, he remained in the service of the Government of India after he reached the normal pensionable age, he would not draw his pension while he remained in that employment, ENCLOSURE IN V.'Z' 2 9 16JULJ936 c _Jit:.* i, AND c-ORIi DcP I. INi/lA OFFICE M. J. CLAUSON, ESQ.; As regards officers who retired before the normal age of retirement on proportionate pension, the position, I understand, is that if they take employment with a Government other than the Government of India before the expiration of a period of two years from the date on which they commenced to draw the proportionate pension, the proportionate pension would not be payable v/hile they were so employed. If, however, they did not take up such new employment until after two years have expired, then they would be able to draw their pensions. Would you mind letting me have a line to confirm whether this describes the position correctly, in order that we can put the correspondence on record here for reference.

With reference to your endorsement No.7712, dated 24th October 1936, i have the honour to make the following observations, both general and personal. 2. Section 15(4) of the Aden Colony^ Order 1936 which was laid before Parliament in accordance with the Govern ment of India Act provides that the person holding the offices of District and Sessions Judge immediately before the appointed day shall, on that day,become Jydge of the Supreme Court,but shall hold'office subject to to the terms and conditions upon which he held office as District(3) District and Sessions Judge® xVnong the conditions to which the urder in council gives imperative effect are those con tained in section 3(2) and 25 of Regulation VI of 1933, by virtue of which the sole power of suspending or removing the Distrist Judge vests in the (iovemor u-eneral in Council,and overrides the purely prerogative powers of the Secretary of State and the general power given by section 23 and 24 of the Order to the (iovernor of Aden in respect of other servants ol the Crowji of Aden® The concurrence of the Governor General in Council in removing the first Chief Justice is thus necessary not only as a matter of administrative courtesy, but as a legal essential* 1 use the expression 'first Chief Justice”, because, for however brief a time,the District and Sessions Judge shall under section 15(4) of the Order become Judge of the Supreme Court® 3» If the substantive District and Sessions Judge is transferred before April 1st, th§ duty of appointing a District and Sessions Judge which is cast upon the (Jovernor General in Council by section 3(2) and 25 of Regulation VI of 1933, may be met by the temporary appointment of some other person, but not by action under section 22 and 34 of Regulation VI of 1933, which do not appear to contemplate a failure of appointment® In this connection if Mr. J.T.Lawrence, who i understand may become Chief Justice, is appointed as District and 3essions Judge, administrative formalities would arise regarding sanction to his employment by the liovernment of India since he retired on proportionate pension from the Indian Civil Service, and regarding his subsequent removal by the Governor General in Council from the office of District and Sessions Judge® 4* Regarding my personal views, not only are the general amenities . •amenities of Aden superior to those of the ordinary mofussil station in the Presidency of Bombay»but in particular the present extra pay of Rs*25U, and the r varied, but not exhausting work, together with the prospect of Foreign Service on increased pay and interesting work, offer advan tages which have a decided and natural attraction* 1 in formed dir Bernard Reilly that l did not wish to transfer to Colonial Service: 1 also said that the then speculative appointment of Cr• Lawrence as Chief Justice would be excell ent from the Colony’s point of view,because the Colony would obtain at comparatively small expense an experienced Judge, with the Special merit of Indian experience: for it would be one of his functions to advise the Governor end the advice of such a Chief Justice would prevent a tendency to ignore Indian precedents in following Colonial models* But I confess i did not expect so early a transfer in view of section 15 of the Order which appeared to contemplate the continuance of the District and Sessions Judge for some time at least in consistence with the general undertaking given in Parliament* 5* i arrived in Aden in February 1936 after passing the bar examination in England in the course of leave during the which l was able to keep fciix only/minimum number of six terms* Being anxious to complete the twelve terms necessary for call to the bar, i proposedto avail myself of a vaca tion during my period in Aden according to precedents set by certain of my predecessors, and to keep the Faster term in Mays the difficulties of keeping six terms during period of leave from India are obvious, while the formality of call to the bar has become all the more important since the removal of my service’s statutory right to representa tion in the High Courts of India* During the last vacation which was from April 20th to June 1st 1 was engaged in examining the workings of the Court as well as in a Settlement departmental inquiry owing to the Chairman's absence •••*•••»•••(5) absence© °# I have the hohour therefore to propose that the sub stantive appointment of Mr# Lawrence as Chief Justice may be postponed till the end of the vacation of 1937, and that I may be allowed to leave Aden during these six weeks and to hand over formal charge on or about 1st June 1937 on return to Aden en route to Bombay on transfer© If this request is granted, the cost will, i presume, be met not from the reven 1 ues of India, but from the revenues of Aden: this appears equit-able as my services will have been rendered to Aden,and the early appointment of Mr. Lawrence will result in a sav ing to Aden: the administrative difficulties created fey the proposal are, 1 respectfully submit, no greater than those created by the retention on deputation of the other Imperial Service officials now in Aden# 7. If my proposal is accepted 1 suggest that Mr. Lawrence who, l understand is now working at the Colonial Office in connection with the revision of enactments applicable to Aden, might be sent to Aden on special duty before assuming his substantive appointment to assist air Bernard Reilly in the multifarious details that the transfer of Aden even now involves© 3© I have the honour to request that copies of the above may be forwarded to the Government of India in whom my present appointment vests and to the Government of Bombay in whom my future appointment vests, and to hope that the Chief Commissioner will recommend my proposal© BGH©1nr7 ^ Of a letter wo*8377/3-l, dated the 3(Jth November lyoo, from the U-ovemment of Bombay* to the (iovernment of India, Home Department.

Section 15(4) of the Aden Colony Order 1936 which was laid before Parliament in accordance with the Cover ment of India Act provides that the person holding the offices of district and Cessions Judge immediately before the appointed day shall, on that day, become Judge of the yupr*^»e Court, but shall held office subject to the terms and condi tions upon which he held office as District end Sessions Judge. Among the conditions to which the Order in Council gives imperative effect are those contained in section 3(2) and 25 of Regulation 71 of 1933, by virtu^e of which the sol© power of suspending or removing the District Judge vests in the Governor Coneral in Council,and overrides the purely prerogative powers ©? the Secretary of State an ! the general power given by section 23 and 24 of the Order to the (Governor of Aden in respect of other servants of the Crown in Aden. The concurrence of the Governor General in Council in removing the first chief Justice ia thus necessary not only as a matter of administrative courtesy, but as a le^nl essential.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have had under consideration, in consultation with Sir Bernard Reilly, the interpretation which should he placed upon the pledge which was given in 1933 that when the control of the Aden Settlement passed from the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government, all Indian adminis/tnative personnel at Aden at the time of the transfer would he retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification hy mutual consent. 2. Sir Bernard Reilly informs me that the subordinate staffs at Aden have enquired whether this pledge applies to them in the same way as it applies to the administrative personnel, and that it is very desirable that a decision on the matter should be reached as soon as possible, as the staffs concerned desire to know what the position will be before they can decide whether they wish to remain in the service of the new Administration when the transfer of control takes place. 3. It was the intention of His Majesty’s Government that this assurance should apply to all members of the subordinate staffs at Aden. If members THE ACTING RESIDENT AT ADENmembers of these staffs elect to remain under the Colonial Government, their existing conditions of service will in all respects be preserved intact, subject only to modification by mutual consent; that is to say, each officer will be entitled to retain his existing scale of salary, pension rights and other terms of employment. He will, however, be regarded, as from the date of the transfer, as a member of His Majesty 1 s Colonial Service, and will be subject accordingly to the provisions of the Colonial Regulations in regard to discipline etc. 4. The staffs concerned need have no apprehension that they will suffer adversely as the result of the application to them of the Colonial Regulations, which have been drawn up with great care in order to safeguard adequately the position of Colonial civil servants. The sections of Colonial Regulations which are more particularly concerned with conduct and discipline are Nos. 50 - 80 in part I of the Regulations, and it is suggested that these sections should be brought to the attention of the staffs in question.

Repeated to chief Commissioner, Aden. Transfer of Aden. Point 16 of Note enclosed with Sir B. Reilly's demi official letter of 5th May. Personnel. His Majesty's Government would be glad to have it confirmed that the Government of India are prepared foi sometime to come (say about five years - though of course the period would vary in respect of individual posts and would be a matter for arrangement as time goes on) to make available officers on foreign service to fill as many as possible of the posts mentioned in statement A attached to Sir B. Reilly's note which are at present filled by Indian Service personnel, and as a corollary to supply leave substitutes from India as suggested. In the note and statement the word 'deputation” is used where of course 'foreign service' is appropriate. Assuming the Government of India are prepared to accept this principle (which seems to follow naturally on the pledge given by His Majesty's Government to employ a proportion of Indian Service personnel for some years after separation), the detailed arrangements in regard to individuals must be left for settlement between the Government of India and Sir B. Reilly. it is however desirable at this stage to raise the following general points: (1) Foreign Service terms do not include a 25^ addition to emoluments as specified by the Chief Commissioner. Prima iacie there is no reason why officers on Foreign Service/2. Service in Aden under the Colonial Office should receive larger emoluments than they received in precisely the same posts and under the same conditions before transfer under the Government of India. it may however be necessary to make some concession in view of the fact that Aden is not an attractive station. Colonial Office are content that this matter should be discussed by Government of India with Reilly, but it would be useful to them to have, meanwhile, a general indication of the Government of India's view. (2) Colonial Revenues will pay leave and leave passage contributions in respect of officers employed on Foreign Service besides the emoluments and passages (and allowances) to anu from India of leave substitutes, but not the emoluments of the substantive incumbents while on leave. (3) Although there would be advantages in the payment by the Government of the Colony of pension contributions m respect of officers on Foreign Service at Aden, it would probably be simpler, in view of the arrangement envisaged for the allocation bet./een Colonial and Indian Revenues of pensions of officers with service partly in india and partly in Aden that this latter arrangement, should apply throughout. (4) As it appears from Statement A that practically all the superior staff is ready to remain for a time at Aden, and as sir B. Reilly anticipates that the great majority of subordinate personnel will be ready to transfer to Colonial Service (provided an assurance about their future conditions of service is given), it is assumed that there is unlikely to be serious difficulty about reabsorbing into india such officers as do not wish to remain. Any individual/individual casos of difficulty may perhaps be left to bo settled as they arise. it is clear that His Majesty's Government are unlikely readily to abandon what is now their provisional attitude on the principle involved, viz; that if an oificer is offered the chance of continuing in Aden in his existing post and on his existing conditions of service and refuses, Colonial Ecvenues can hardly be expected to meet any special charges in respect of him, but they would no doubt be prepared to consider special cases on their merits (e.g. of Staff recruited in India not solely for Aden service). His Majesty’s Government are favourably considering Sir B* Reilly’s proposal that an assurance should be given forthwith in regard to the future of the subordinate personnel, and a decision may shortly be expected. The issue of the above has been authorised. ^ O s 7/*—I' 7 • f .j * 5158 ! 936 cS Record of a meeting held at the Colonial Office on Tuesday, the 23rd June, to consider personnel questions arising out of the transfer of the Aden Settlement to the Colonial Office. PRBSjJNT: - Cowell (in the Chair). Clauson R.S. Brovm ) India Office. Foyle Treasury. Jeffries ( Blaxter James ) Colonial Office Mr. Boyse Mr. Palmer Sir Bernard Reilly - British Resident at Aden. Mr. Cowell explained that it was the wish of the Colonial Office that as many of the Indian personnel as possible should remain at \den for a time in order to tide over the transfer period. Those Indian officials who were unwilling to transfer to the Colonial Service would either return to India or continue their service at Aden on ”foreign service”, the new Colonial Government paying a pension contribution in respect of their services. This arrangement would cease gradually and the posts would be filled by Colonial Service officers. It was necessary to consider the terms on which these arrangements could be*be carried through* Indian SGi*vice personnel remaining at .Aden v/ould retain their existing conditions of service, hut he thought that it was essential that officials serving at \den must come under Colonial regulations for purposes of discipline. It was proposed to introduce a pensions Law for the new Colony and this would need detailed consideration. Also he thought that, although not necessarily immediately, a Widows T and Orphans* pension Lav; should he passed. It would he desirable to have a 'Treasurer for the new Colony; he should he appointed and sent out some months before the transfer took place. Such an officer could probably he obtained from some other Colony. The India Office representatives remarked that officials of the Indian Services remaining at Aden after the transfer would remain on '’'foreign service**, not on deputation. In his memorandum of the 5th May, 1956, the Resident had used the latter terra. They stated that the India Office saw no objection in principle to this arrangement: indeed they presumed the Government of Inriia would welcome it since one of the assurances given by His Majesty’s Government was that Indian personnel would continue to be employed for a period. It was emphasised, however, that such officers could only be employed on foreign service on a voluntary basis and this raised the question whether a special allov/ance not exceeding per cent, to which Sir Bernard Reilly referred in his memorandum of the 5th Kay, 1956, was payable. Mr. Brown stated that according to the Fundamental Rules the amount to be paid by way of additional allowance to officials on foreign service was a matter of arrangement v/ith the employingemploying Government and that no fixed figure was observed. He doubted very much whether an allowance as large as 25 per cent, or even 20 per cent, as allowed for in the Resident’s draft budget, would be necessary. On the other hand, it was recognised that some additional allowance would be needed to act as an inducement to officers to continue their service in Aden. Some discussion took place regarding the proposal made in the Resident’s memorandum of the 5th Fay, 1956 (under point 16) that officers of the subordinate services at Aden should be given immediately an assurance that the Colonial Office pledge with regard to the terms of service of Indian personnel applied equally to the subordinate services as to the superior services. The pledge given by His Majesty’s Government is contained in Hr. Cowell’s letter to Mr. V/alton of the 24th October, 1955, on page 29 of Middle &gt;]ast Ho. 50 and reads as follows:- 'We should be prepared to give an assurance that in the event of the transfer of Aden all Indian • administrative personnel in Aden at the time of the trails!er would be retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent.” Cowell stated that it was intended that this assurance should apply equally to all Indian personnel at Aden: it would be unjust that the assurance should apply to the senior oificials if it was not equally applicable to the junioi officials. The position in regard to the pensions of these subordinate officials was raised and it was urged ^ t ohe pensions rights of these officials as at present existingexisting under the Indian regulations must be preserved to them after the transfer. Mr. Cowell said that the position would be that these subordinate officials who were recruited locally and whose appointments were solely .'den posts and not part of any Indian cadre would be offered transfer to the Colonial Service on the under standing that their existing terms of service would be preserved intact. If the Indian pension scales and regulations were not preserved for them also, we should be offering them texius less favourable than those on which they were originally engaged. If, however, any of these officials did not accept transfer on these conditions, then he thought that the Colonial CrOvexviTnont need be under no further obligation towards them. The question was raised whether the assurance with regard to the preserva tion of existing terms of serviOe would apply also to temporary employees. These employees. Sir Bernard fei.lly st ited, were subject to notice at any time and were not In any way on a permanent basis. While legally it would no doubt be possible to discharge such employees and offer them re-engagement on different conditions, it was recognised that this would be unreasonable and that the assurance with regard to the maintenance of existing conditions of service should apply to these employees also, subject, of course, to the understanding that if retrenchments or abolition of posts was necessary they could be discharged as at present. Mr. Foyle stated that before this definite assurance was given to the subordinate staffs he would like to refer the matter to the appropriate authority in the Treasury. He undertook to do this as soon as possible.As regards the method under which the existing pension rights of subordinate staff should be preserved, Mr, Cowell explained that a draft Pensions Ordinance had been tentatively prepared and it was suggested that the detailed clauses of this Ordinance should be discussed in a small committee at which representatives of the India office. Treasury and Colonial Office Personnel Division would be present. It was thought that it would be desirable that the India Office should be given an opportunity of examining the draft Ordinance before the discussions took place. iir. Jeffries then gave a short account of conditions in the Colonial Service. He explained that under new arrangements many branches of the Colonial ^ ice had been unified and that there was now a Colonial Administrative Service, a Colonial Legal Service, a Colonial Medical Service, etc. Members of these Services were interchangeable and could be transferred and promoted at will throughout the Colonial Empire. The staffs of these services were mainly European and the general conditions of service as regards pay, pasraages, - be 3 , were as far as possible designed in order to provide a suitable career for such officers. In addition to these Services, each Colony had its own locally recruited cadre of officials many of vdiom filled the more subordinate posts. It will be necessary to consider in connection with iden which posts are to be included in the Unified Services and which posts are to be regarded as staffed by locally recruited officers. It should not be difficult to decide which posts fell into the two categories. Mr. Cov/ellMr, Cowell observed that in due course a list would have to 'be prepared of posts which were to he * included in the Unified Services and theBS; posts would gradually he filled hy Colonial Service officers. The position of the four officers who work in the Protectorate was mentioned. If provision is to he made in the future as in the past for Protectorate services on the Colonial and Middle Sastem Services Vote, it might he possible to appoint these officers to the Aden Colony and second them for Protectorate work, the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote paying a pension contribution to the Colonial Administration, thus preserving their oension rights. They could he covered hy the new Aden Pensions Ordinance and would he included in the Colonial Administrative Service. No settlement was, however, reached pending a decision on the question of the form in which the budget is to he drawn up, Mr, Cowell raised the question of how long India would expect that certain posts in Aden would he filled by Indian officials on foreign service, pointing out that this arrangement naturally could not he continued indefinitely. A period of five years was mentioned as ?/hat would probably he a reasonable period, hut it was generally agreed that it would he a matter for arrangement as time went on. Sir Bernard Reilly referred to the list of officials in Statement ’A 1 in his memorandum of the 5th May, 1936, and explained that in some cases it would certainly he desirable for a time to fill the posts hy officials from India. Certain comparatively senior posts were at present filled hy Indians, for example.the Registrar of the Court, the Civil Surgeon and the Kxtra Assistant Commissioner* It was suggested that, if sir Bernard Hellly goes to Delhi this autumn as has 'been proposed, he should go through the list of officers in Statement , A f with tee authorities in India, and discuss with them the position of each of these officers* Sir Bernard Reilly referred to the observations which he had made under point 16 in Ms memorandum of the 5th Kay, 1966, regarding the filling of leave vacancies. In tne case of the Colonial Service officers at Aden there was a sufficient reserve to enable leave to he taken v/ithout the necessity of obtaining other officers for replacement. Iri the case » however, of officials from India who remain at Aden on foreign service the position will be different. These officers do longer swells of duty and obtain longer periods of leave than is customary in the Colonial Service. ',/hen these officers take their leave it will be necessary for them to be replaced as they may be absent for periods of as much as nine months or a year. The most convenient, and perhaps the only practicable, arrangement would be for them to be replaced by another officer sent from India. It was agreed that the Government of India’s views should be obtained on this question. It was pointed out that the officers sent as substitutes could only be obtained on a voluntary basis, but it seemed to follow from uirangement that Indian Service personnel should be retained at Aden for a period that the Government of India should see that substitutes were forthcoming to meet the situation during leave. Otherwise the system would breakd0TO * Mr. Brown stated that the Government of India would no doubt expect the Aden Administration to pay for the passage of the substitute as well as the leave and leave passage contribution in respect of the permanent Holders of the posts. The Aden Administration would pay the salary of the substitute but not the salary of the incumbent during his leave. The India Office undertook to take the question up with the Government of India. Some discussion took place regarding the comment made in the last sub-paragraph of point 16 in the Resident’s memorandum of the 6th May, 1936, where he raised the question whether personnel recruited solely for service in Aden would receive any compensation if they did not wish to continue their service under the new Government. Mr,. Cowell stated that if, as is contemplated, an assurance is given that these officers would be retained on the identical terms of service under which they at present work, and if they still refuse to continue their employment, then there seemed to be no case for any compensation to be paid by the Colony of Aden. Mr. Brown t i '.a t in cases of this sort the Government of India had usually given special pensions to such officers. He referred, for example, to those members of the Post Office staff who had been recruited in India. if they transfer i0 the new Colonial Administration they will cease to have the opportunities which were previously open to them of promotion in the Indian Poets and Telegraphs Department. Such officers might say that it is impossible to offer them the continuance of identical terns of service at Aden only, since by transferring to the Aden Government they are entering a small Service and have lees chance of advancement.advancement* Mr, Cowell agreed that there might he apecial cases where some compensation ought to he given hut he did not think that there was any case for offering any compensation in the case of officers recruited in Aden solely for service in Aden who were offered continuance under the new Government on the same terms as before hut who refused to continue. The appointment of a Treasurer ?/as then discussed. Gir Bernard Reilly referred to the proposals made under point 6 of his memorandum of the 5th Hay, 1956, where he had suggested that the Treasurer, if appointed, should he in charge of the Income Tax and Salt and Excise .Departments as well as the Treasury, Mr, Cowell expressed the view that it would he desirable that the man selected should he sent out in order to arrive in Aden some months before the transfer takes place. It was thought that the best method of meeting his salary until the date of transfer would he for him to he seconded from the Colony where he was previously serving and lor that Colony to pay his salary up to the date of the transfer (i.e. 1 April, 1957) and recover it subsequently from the new Aden Government, No accounting difficulties should arise through this arrangement, either in the lending Colony or at Aden, Mr c Jeffries enquired T/hether it was intended that the appointment should he styled ^Financial 3ecretax*y ,, or u Treasurer*. The new policy was to abolish the title of * Treasurer* and to replace it by that of “Financial Secretary*, the Financial Secretary being an official of the Secretariat. This applied, of course, mainly to the larger Colonies. It was generally agreed that it wouldbs very deslrabls to appoint an experienced official to tide the Oolony over the first two or three years. T he title suggested for this officer was 'Finance Officer'. at was arranged that Mr. Jeffries would consider likely candidates and discuss them with Sir Bernard Heilly, '' S re Sards the appointment of a Legal Adviser, it '-v'-w j.

This arrangement would cease gradually and the posts would be filled by Colonial Service officers. It was necessary to consider the terms on which these arrangements could be carried through.

On the other hand, it was recognized that some additional allowance would be needed to act as an inducement to officers to continue their service in Aden. Mr. Brown stated that the India ce would OH' prefer the arrangement whereby the new “Colonial Government would pay a pension contribution in respect of officers serving at Aden bn foreign service rather than the proposal made in the Government of India’s memorandum relating to the financial adjustments on the separation of'Aden from India, where it was proposed that Aden should meet a part of the pensions of such officers based on the length of service referable to service in Aden. Some discussion took place regarding the proposal made in the Resident’s memorandum of the 5th May, 1936 (under point 16) that officers of the subordinate services at Aden should be given immediately an assurance that the Colonial Office pledge with regard to the terms of service of Indian personnel applied equally to the subordinate services as to the superior services. The pledge given by His Majesty’s Government is contained in Mr. Cowell’s letter to Mr. Walton of the 24th October, 1933, on page 29 of Middle East No.50 and reads as follows:- 'We should be prepared to give an assurance that in the event of the transfer of Aden all Indian administrative personnel in Aden at the time of the transfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent.” Mr. CowellMr. Cowell stated that it was intended that this assurance should apply equally to all Indian personnel at Aden: it would be unjust that the assurance should apply to the senior officials if it was not equally applicable to the junior officials. The position in regard to the pensions of these subordinate officials was raised and it was urged that the pensions rights of these officials as at present existing under the Indian regulations must be preserved to them after the transfer. Mr. Cowell said that the position would be that these subordinate officials who were recruited locally and whose appointments were solely Aden posts and not part of any Indian cadre would be offered transfer to the Colonial Service on the understanding that their existing terms of service would be preserved intact. If the Indian pension scales and regulations were not preserved for them also, we should be offering them terms less favourable than those on which they were originally engaged. If, however, any of these officials did not accept transfer on these conditions, then he thought that the Colonial Government need be under no further obligation towards them. The question was raised whether the assurance with regard to the preservation of existing terms of service would apply also to temporary employees. These employees, Sir Bernard Reilly stated, were subject to notice at any time and were not in any way on a permanent basis. While legally it would no doubt be possible to discharge such employees and offer them re-engagement on different conditions, it was recognized that this would be unreasonable and that the assurance with regard to the maintenance of existing conditions of service should apply toapply to these employees also, subject, of course, to the understanding that if retrenchments or abolition of posts was necessary they could be discharged as at present.

He undertook to do this as soon as possible. As regards the method under which the existing pension rights of subordinate staff should be preserved, Mr. Cowell explained that a draft Pensions Ordinance had been tentatively prepared and it was suggested that the detailed clauses of this Ordinance should be discussed in a small committee at which representatives of the India Office, Treasury and Colonial Office Personnel Division would be present. It was thought that it would be desirable that the India Office should be given an opportunity of examining the draft Ordinance before the discussions took place. Mr. Jeffries then gave a short account of conditions in the Colonial Service. He explained that under new arrangements many branches of the Colonial Service had been unified and that there was now a Colonial Administrative Service, a Colonial Legal Service, a Colonial Medical Service, etc. Members of these Services were interchangeable and could be trans ferred and promoted at will throughout the Colonial Empire. The staffs of these Services were mainly European and the general conditions of service as regards pay, passages, etc., were as far as possible designed in order to provide a suitable career for such officers. In addition to these Services, each Colony had its own locallyr locally recruited cadre of officials many of whom filled the more subordinate posts. It will he necessary to consider in connection with Aden which posts are to be included in the Unified Services and which posts are to be regarded as staffed by locally recruited officers. It should not be difficult to decide which posts fell into the two categories. Hr. Cowell observed that in due course a list would have to be prepared of posts which were to be included in the Unified Services and these posts would gradually be filled by Colonial Service officers. The position of the four officers who work in the Protectorate was mentioned. If provision is to be made in the future as in the past for Protectorate services on the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote, it might be possible to appoint these officers to the Aden Colony and second them for Protectorate work, the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote paying a pension contribution to the Colonial Administra tion, thus preserving their pension rights. They could be covered by the new Aden Pensions Ordinance and would be included in the Colonial Administrative Service. No settlement was, however, reached pending a decision on the question of the form in which the budget is to be drawn up. Mr. Cowell raised the question of how long India would expect that certain posts in Aden would be filled by Indian officials on foreign service, pointing out that this arrangement naturally could not be continued indefinitely. A period of five years was mentioned as what would probably be a reasonable period, but it was generally agreed that it would be a matter forfor arrangement as time went on. Sir Bernard Reilly referred to the list of officials in Statement ’A* in his memorandum of the 5th May, 1936, and explained that in some cases it would certainly be desirable for a time to fill the posts by officials from India. Certain comparatively senior posts were at present filled by Indians, for example, the Registrar of the Court, the Civil Surgeon and the Extra Assistant Commissioner. It was suggested that, if Sir Bernard Reilly goes to Delhi this autumn as has been proposed, he should go through the list of officers in Statement ’A* with the authorities in India, and discuss with them the position of each of these officers. Sir Bernard Reilly referred to the observations which he had made under point 16 in his memorandum of the 5th i-ay, 1936, regarding the filling of leave vacancies. In the case of the Colonial Service officers at Aden there was a sufficient reserve to enable leave to be taken without the necessity of obtaining other officers for replacement. In the case, however, of officials from India who remain at Aden on foreign service the position will be different. These officers do longer spells of duty and obtain longer periods of leave than is customary in the Colonial Service. Y&lt;hen these officers take their leave it will be necessary for them to be replaced as they may be absent for periods of as much as nine months or a year. The most convenient, and perhaps the only practicable, arrangement would be for them to be replaced by another officer sent from India. It was agreed that the Government of India’s vie wsviews should be obtained on this question. It was pointed out that the officers sent as substitutes could only be obtained on a voluntary basis, but it seemed to follow from the arrangement that Indian Service personnel should be retained at Aden for a period that the Government of India should see that substitutes were forthcoming to meet the situation during leave. Otherwise the system would break down. Mr. Brown stated that the Government of India would no doubt expect the Aden Administration to pay for the passage of the substitute as well as the leave and passage contribution in respect of the permanent holders of the posts. The Aden Administration would pay the salary of the substitute but not the salary of the incumbent during his leave. The India Office undertook to take the question up with the Government of India. Some discussion took place regarding the comment made in the last sub-paragraph of point 16 in the Resident’s memorandum of the 5th May, 1936, where he raised the question whether personnel recruited solely for service in Aden would receive any compensa tion if they did not wish to continue their service under the new Government. Mr. Cowell stated that if, as is contemplated, an assurance is given that these officers would be retained on the identical terms of service under which they at present work, and if they still refuse to continue their employment, then there seemed to be no case for any compensation to be paid by the Colony of Aden. Mr. Brown said that in cases of this sort the Government of India had usually given special pensions to such officers. He referred, for example, to those members of the Post Office staff who had beenhad been recruited in India. If they transfer to the new Colonial Administration they will cease to have the opportunities which were previously open to them of promotion in the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department. Such officers might say that it is impossible to offer them the continuance of identical terms of service at Aden only, since by transferring to the Aden Government they are entering a small Service and have less chance of advancement. Mr. Cowell agreed that there might be special cases where some compensation ought to be given but he did not think that there was any case for offering any compensation in the case of officers recruited in Aden solely for service in Aden who were offered continuance under the new Government on the same terms as before but who refused to continue. The appointment of a Treasurer was then discussed. Sir Bernard Reilly referred to the proposals made under point 6 of his memorandum of the 5th May, 1936, where he had suggested that the Treasurer, if appointed, should be in charge of the Income Tax and Salt and Excise Departments as well as the Treasury. Mr. Cowell expressed the view that it would be desirable that the man selected should be sent out in order to arrive in Aden some months before the transfer takes place. It was thought that the best method of meeting his salary until the date of transfer would be for him to be seconded from the Colony where he was previously serving and for that Colony to pay his salary up to the date of the transfer (i.e. 1 April 1937 and recover it subsequently from the new Aden Government No accounting difficulties should arise through this arrangement, either in the lending Colony or at Aden. Mr. JeffriesMr. Jeffries enquired whether it was intended that the appointment should be styled ’’Financial Secretary” or ’’Treasurer”. The new policy was to abolish the title of 'Treasurer” and to replace it by that of ’’Financial Secretary”, the Financial Secretary being an official of the Secretariat. This applied, of course, mainly to the larger Colonies. It was generally agreed that it would be very desirable to appoint an experienced official to tide the Colony over the first two or three years. The title suggested for this officer was 'Finance Officer”. It was arranged that Mr. Jeffries would consider likely candidates and discuss them with Sir Bernard Reilly. As regards the appointment of a Legal Adviser, it was decided that as a first step this should be discussed with Sir Grattan Bushe.The Secretat*y, Stfi QiDByiirtinent. a* oMoitd • Certain matters in connection with the transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office are being discussed at a series of meetings at the Colonial Office which Sir Bernard Beilly, the Resident and Chief Commissioner, who is at present on leave, is attending* At a meeting on Tuesday next, 23rd June, at 11 a.m* a preliminary discussion is taking place on the question of personnel.

' r 3 6 ~- nt -• taonnel. m Mr. Cowell's letter to the India Office dated 24th October 1933 an assurance was given on behalf of the Colonial Office that all Indian administra tive personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the temns of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent, ani that it was intended that *en vacancies occurred, though there would be a gradual substitution of officers of the Colonial Service in the Aden Service, Indians ani officers of the Indian PoliUcal Department would remain eligible for appointment to such posts. in a telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, Ko.7S8 dated 25th March 1933, it was stated that His Majesty's Governnent would be prepared to retain a proportion of Indian Service administrative personnel in Aden Service for some years after the transfer takes place, and it was suggested that posts at present staffed from India ■night continue so to be filled for about five years from the date of separation in the first instance. If so , not only would Officers who are serving in Aden at the time of the transfer be retained, but 1hey wpuld in the ordinal course be relieved by other Indian Service Officers for about five years. It is understood that they would be retained at Aden tftv-15- on Indian rates of pay and on Indian terns of service. Their leave rules would therefore differ from those of officers in Colonial Service. The latter will probably be given leave after 18 months of duty, but Indian Service officers usually do longer spells of continuous duty and then obtain longer periods of leave than is customary in Colonial Service. The question arises as to how leave vacancies in the case of these officers will be filled. In the case of Colonial Service officers now serving at Aden there is an adequate reserve to enable leave to be taken without the necessity of obtaining other officers for r eplacement. This is not so in the case of Indian Service officers now in Aden. When one of them therefore goes on leave it will^be necessary for the Government of India to replace him by another officer, either temporarily for the period of his leave or substantively. This may have already been arranged between His Majesty^ Government and the Government of India, but if not, I suggest that a clear «*r understanding should now be reached on this point. Indian Service officers may remain at Aden either (a) on deputation, or (b) by retiring from Indian Service and transferring to Colonial Service. With regard to (a) the conditions under which officers may serve on deputation are laid down in Part VII, Chapter XII read with Appendix 11 of the Government of India Fundamental Rules. Deputation must be on a voluntary basis and officers are entitled to a deputation allowance not exceeding 25 per cent. The Aden Administration would also have to pay contributions to the Government of India towards leave, passages and pensions of these officers. This must be taken into consideration in calculating the cost to the new Administration of retaining Indian Service officers at Aden. With regard to (b) I do not think that officers belonging to Indian cadres are likely to elect for transfer-16- &lt;rn2j to Colonial Service. I have, however, been informed privately that Mr. J. T. Lawrence, M.A., Indian Civil Service (retired on premature pension), who was Judicial Assistant at Aden from 1927 to 1931, would be willing to return to Aden after its transfer as District and Sessions Judge on any reasonable rate of pay offered to him by the Colonial Office, provided that he will be permitted to continue to draw his Indian pension. The services of an officer such as Mr. Lawrence, who is familiar with Indian law and procedure, who has experience of Aden,and who is still young enough to work energetically in a hot climate, would be very valuable, and they could be obtained comparatively cheaply if his Colonial Service pay were additional to his pension. I hope that this method of recruiting officers for Aden, who are suitable in age and other respects^ may be approved by both His Majesty*s Government and the Goveranent of India. I may mention incidentally that this principle has been adopted in the case of the present Civil Administrator, Kamaran, who is a retrenched Indian Army Officer drawing his Indian Army pension in addition to a salary in Kamaran. I attach Statements (A and B) showing the present si£&gt;erior and subordinate staffs in the existing Government administrative departments in Aden. In addition to these there are the officers and subordinate staffs of the Aden Port Trust and Aden Settlement, which I assume will remain unchanged. At present the administrative machinery for Aden is entirely distinct from that of the Protectorate, the only connecting link between the two being the Resident and Chief Commissioner. When both Aden and the Protectorate are under the same control by the Colonial Office it may eventually be decided to modify this dual system by appointing a Chief Secretary and an Assistant Secretary and possibly some junior Political Officers whose work, like that of the Governor, will be concerned with both Aden and the Protectorate, or who‘17- will be interchangeable between these two branches of the Aden Government. If so, I suggest that this change should be brought about gradually, and that there should be no immediate alteration in the existing system. At present the Resident and Chief Commissioner has on his immediate staff a Political Secretary responsible to him for Protectorate affairs and a Civil Secretary who deals, under the Chief Commissioner*s direction, with Aden affairs. There is no official corresponding to a Chief Secretary, but the Political Secretary is senior to the Civil Secretary, and it is established that he acts for the Resident ard. Chief Commissioner when the latter is absent. This arrangement is open to the objection that the Political Secretary, who has at times to act as the head of the dual administration, is familiar with only one side of it. It has, however, the merit of enabling the Political and Civil Secretaries to devote their whole time and attention to their respective spheres, which differ very greatly from each other owing to the strong contrast between conditions in Aden and conditions in the Protectorate. Aden is a small and progressive urban area which includes an important fortress and naval and air force bases, an active commercial community of a variety of races and a busy fuelling and trading port, and is directly administered under the lav/s and customs of British India. On the other hand, the Protectorate is not under any form of direct British administrations its more advanced parts are governed by Chiefs under the Moslem Sheria Law, anil, its backward districts are merely tribal areas, many of which are in a semi-anarchic condition. The officers who deal with Aden and those who deal with the Protectorate have very divergent problems and there is a good deal to b e said for letting them specialise in their own particular duties. After the transfer officers belonging to the- 18 - Goveraraent of India Services who remain in Aden will be on deputation, unless they transfer to Colonial Service, and it will not be possible to retain them here without their own consent and without that of their departmental superiors in India, I have consulted the principal officers now in Aden with regard to their wishes in the event of the transfer taking place early next year, and remarks on this subject are included in the attached statement A. I assume that the assurances given by the Colonial Office with regard to terms of service applies also to the Subordinate Services, and that their services under the Government of India will count towards their pension. I should like to be in a position to give an immediate assurance to them to this effect. If this is done I am confident that the majority of the members of the present Subordinate Services in Aden will wish to continue to serve after the transfer. When the members of these Subordinate Services or others, who transfer to the new Administration, retire, their pensions would be payable by the Government of India and the Aden Administration in proportion to their services under the respective Governments. Those who do not wish to remain and who belong to Services in India will presumably be absorbed into India. Those who have been recruited specially for Aden will wish to know what will happen to them if they are not willing to serve under the Colonial Office, that is to say, whether they will be re-employed in India or be given pensions or proportionate pensions.

The question of the establishment of a Government Printing Press at Aden may be considered* At present Government printing for Aden is done in the Government Presses in India, and in the local private Presses. It will be convenient if the new Aden Government has its own Printing Press, as the printing of confidential documents is often urgently required, and it is not desirable to entrust this to private Presses. Information is now ^®iug collected for an estimate of capital and recurring expenditure. The capital cost might perhaps be included in the special grant which it is suggested should be made by Kis Majesty's Government on the occasion of the transfer. The recurring expenditure would not be excessive.V im* \y P.Z.9203/36 Extracts from letter to Mr . Claus on from Major W.R. Hay dated 21st December, 1936, D. 0 .

General Provident Fund . ^At present Government servants in Aden who belong to Indian Services, both Superior and Subordinate are entitled to contribute to the General Provident Fund maintained by the Government of India for the benefit of their families. Government contribute nothing towards this Fund, but they pay interest on it, the rate of which is determined by the Government of India from year to year and is generally between 4 and 5 per cent. I recommend that sums in this Fund standing to the credit of Government servants in Aden, who are transferred (not lent on deputation) to the new Aden Administration should be handed over from the Indian Fund to a new General Provident Fund to be maintained on the same lines by the Aden Administration, to which Aden Government servants would continue to be able to contribute. This would mainly affect the Subordinate Services.J 1 12 b Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, P. /..

Sir, With reference to your letter No. 4051/3A/37 of the 28th July I em directed by Mr. Neville Chamberlain to state that, since all United Kingdom extradition treaties apply, by virtue of provisions in the treaties themselves, to all British colonies, their application to Aden was automatic upon the change of its status to that of a Colony. Mr. Chamberlain therefore agrees that the position of the Colony of Aden is fully covered by the existing United Kingdom extradition treaties and the Orders in Council giving effect to those treaties. It is, in his view, unnecessary to take any steps of a general nature to bring the position to the notice of the foreign Governments concerned. 2. I am to add that it appears that the only extradition treaties which did not already apply to Aden, as part of India, before the 1st April, 1937, were those with the United States of America and Iraq. I am, etc., (Sd.) E.W. LIGHT. The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office.^ - Sir, 4061/3A/37 ^ith reference to your letter V 8453/3493/50 of the 13th arch and connected correspondence relative to the applicability to Aden of Treaties and Conventions with foreign countries* I am directed by Mr Secretary Omsby Gore to request you to inform Mr secretary Eden that he considers it desirable that early consideration should be given to the position of the Colony of Aden in regard to extradition Treaties and Conventions. As regards the Protectorate of /.den there would appear to be no machinery in existence by which such Treaties and Conventions could be rendered operative in the Protectors^ and no action seems to be called for at the moment to provide for their application to the Protectorate. 2m The various Extradition Treaties etc. corrprise (a) those concluded prior to the war between the United Kingdom and foreign countries which are applicable to the Colonies and foreign possessions of TEE UK MB SECRSTAKY OF STATE,of His Majesty* fb) those concluded after the wsr f the British r- territories covered 'by which include all parts of Hie Majesty's dominions otlier than the self* governing Dominions and India In respect of which there is provision for separate accession by His Majesty. Certain of those Treaties etc. were applied to India before the let April, 1957, tUe date on which the Settlement of Aden was separated from India and became the Colony of Aden. Others including the Treaty with the United States of America of the 22nd December, 1931, and the Treaty with Iraq of the 2nd May, 1932, had not at that date been applied to India. 3* I am to enquire what action Ur :den considers would be necessary via a vie the foreign countries concerned to ensure that the pre-war and post-war Extradition Treaties &amp;c. referred to in the preceding paragraph are recognised as applying to the new Colony of Aden. If and when it is established that they do In fact apply, it would appear that the necessary legal machinerymachinery to give effect to the application is already in existence 9 since where the jctradition Acts have been applied by Order-in-Council in respect of the United Kingdom in the case of a foreign country, they extend, unless otherwise provided in the Order, to every British possession (see sections 2 and 17 of the extradition Act, 1870). Consequently, unless otherwise provided therein, the existing Orders-in-council, including the Iraq (extradition) 0rder~in-Council, 1935, and the United States of America ( extradition) Jrder^iiwiouncil, 1935, which were made in respect of the pre-war and post-war ^tradition treaties in question, would cover the Colony of Aden, although its separate existence as such only dates fro*! the 1st April, 1937. I am. Sir, Your most obedient Servant,4051/3/37. CCi_GK JAi. O ~FjC Lo.jximq Street, H.V/.'J.

CLAUS Oh, ESQ,..D.C. No.P. 58/36-G(B) ^ Government of India, Reforms Office. AIR MAIL. New Delhi, the 9th March 1937. Subject:- Position of a separated Burma in relation to existing International Treaties and Conventions. My dear Monteath, Will you kindly refer to your demi-official letter No.P &amp; J.(B) 1851, dated the 28th September 1936, addressed to Spence of the Legislative Department of the Government of India. The Reforms Office, to whom your letter was transferred, have been acting as the co-ordinating body in the examination of the question by the Departments of the Government of India concerned. 2. Y/e have received from the Government of Burma copies of letters addressed liy that Government to the India Office containing their views on certain items in the lists appended to your letter No.P &amp; J(B) 1851, dated the 28th September 1936, to Seymour, and, subject to any further observations they may have to make and closer scrutiny by the authorities at Home, we are in agreement with the general principles stated in your letter. 3. As regards detailed examination of the relevant Agreements and Conventions, I am desired to say that in 1932 the Government of India considered the general question of applicability to Burma, in the event of its separation from India, of treaties to which India was a party. No attempt was then made to reach conclusions as to the actual legal or administrative necessity for the continuance of the various treaties. A list was, however, prepared and communicated to the Government of Burma, A copy of the correspondence that2 passed 'between the Government of India and the Government oi Burma on the subject is enclosed, for information. 4 . We have now examined the various statements prepared in the India Office, and have the following remarks to offer: Statement I. Items 9 and 22 , India’s ratification of the Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses, 1923, and of the Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1927, is awaiting the enactment of legislation to implement the obligations contracted under them. A Bill has been introduced in the Eogislative Assembly for the purpose; and it is likely that the necessary Act will be passed during the current session of the Indian legislature. Item 20. The Government of India have since agreed to the withdrawal of reservation in respect of all areas in Burma and Assam except the unadministered portions of the .Sadiya and Balip’ara Frontier Tracts. Item 21 . It is suggested that an attempt should first be made to secure Burma’s continued adhesion as a separate contracting party on the footing that the contribution made by India in 1934 covers separated Burma. If the attempt fails, the Government of Burma might then consider whether they would wish to accede to the Convention on payment. Item 26. It has been decided to exclude Burma figures from those to be collected by the Government of India with effect from the 1st April 1937, and from that date the statistical publications that are required to be supplied by India to the signatories of the Convention will relate to India excluding Burma.3. Statement 2. Items 1-3 9 5,10,23 ana 24 . All these Conventions, v/hich have been ratified hy India, and not merely those numbered 13 and 14, are applicable only to British India. I tem 22. The convention has not yet been ratified by India, as the intention is to ratify after the Indian Dock. Labourers Act has been brought into force. Statement 3. Item 1 . Burma has not been receiving copies of the publication from India. Statement 4. Item 4. The Indo-Brazilian Commercial Agreement of 1932 has since been denounced, and a fresh exchange of Notes effected providing on terms of reciprocity for the maintenance of the commercial relations in the same conditions as those laid down in the Agreement of 1932, until the new commercial agreement which is being negotiated comes into force. Item 13. As you are aware, the Indo-Japanese Convention and Protocol of 1934 have been denounced since you addressed us and the position now is that simultaneous but separate negotiations for fresh Conventions and Protocols between India and Japan and Burma and Japan, respectively, are in progress. It is observed that in order to regularise the position of Burma, it has been suggested in respect of certain Agreements that formal communications should be addressed to the parties concerned. It may be mentioned that in the case of some of the treaties, India has become a party by4 . exchange of Notes, is suggested that the same procedure may he followed in the case of Burma also. This is, however, ^ a point which the Foreign Office, whom the India Office propose to apnmach, will no doubt consider. Statement 5 . As regards the last five treaties mentioned in the statement it may he stated that the Government of India have already intimated to the India Office that they are willing to accede to all these treaties, vide letters from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political hepartment Nos.F.450-N/36, dated the 24th November 1936; and F.528-X/36, dated the 18th January 1937. Statement 7 . Item 2. India acceded to the Declaration in 1891 - yide the letter from His Majesty’s Representative at Paris to the Foreign Office, dated the 16th April 1891, and section 279(a)of, and Schedule IV to, the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1923. 5. The Government of India are not sure whether the principle enunciated in paragraph 2 (a) of your letter to Seymour, No.P &amp; J(B) 1851, dated the 28th September 1936, is quite correct in so far as the agreements entered into by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research Department, on behalf of the Government of India, with International and Imperial Institutes are concerned. Adhesion to these Institutes entails the payment of annual contributions by her towards the funds of the Institutes. It has already been decided that under the agreements entered into with those Institutes rights and liabilities will not pass automatically to Burma and that it is open to her to choose to participate in the International and Imperial Institutes. The lists5 . appended, to your letter to Seymour referred to above do not include these agreements referred to. As it is desirable to inform the Imperial and Int. rnational Institutes concerned of Burma’s wishes in the matter of her adhesion to them these agreements are included in Appendix I to this letter. 6 . In Appendix II to this letter we have mentioned what appear to us to be omissions in the statements prepared in the India Office, but are n&lt; t in a position to know howfhr these omissions may be inadvertent. -‘-ours sincerely, Sgd.

(18) Statutes of the International Meteorological Organisation . It has been held that the ’Statutes’ cannot be classed either as a ’treaty’ or ’convention’. The Statutes govern the International Meteorological Organisation of which the Director General of Observatories in India is a member; and it is desirable that the head of the Meteorological Service in Burma should also be a member c£ that organisation.

Booth-Gravely, Esq., C.I.E., I.G.S., Chief Secretary to the Government of Burma, (Home and Political Department). To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. Dated Rangoon, the 2nd September, 1932. Subject:- Treaties, etc., that will be binding upon the Government of Burma in the event of separation. Sir, I am directed to say that one of the questions to v/hich the Local Government has been giving preliminary consideration, in view of the possibility of Burma becoming politically separate from India in the near future, relates to the Treaties, Conventions, Agreements, etc. with v/hich the Government of Burma will be concerned in the event of separation. Such Treaties, etc. appear to fall into two categories. (a) Those contracted by the British Government which are at present binding upon Burma as part of the Indian Empire, with which the Government of India as the Central Government in India, and not the Local Government, are at present concerned, but v/ith v/hich the Government of Burma v/ill become concerned in the event of separation; and (b) those contracted by the Government of India, the rights and liabilities under which will presumably pass to the Government of Burma under the enactment effecting separation, if separation takes place. 2. For obvious reasons the Local Government has at present comparatively little experience of the Treaties,etc. falling in category (a) and its information regarding them is necessarily very incomplete. As regards Treaties, etc. falling in category (h), the Local Government probably has more information in so far as such Treaties, etc. relate to countries which border on Burma or with which Burma for one reason or another maintains a limited sphere of direct relations; but the Local Government’s information in respect of the latter category of Treaties, etc. also is probably very incomplete. 3. A search has been made in the volumes of Aitchison’s Treaties and in the records available in Rangoon in order to ascertain the Treaties, etc. belonging to both categories mentioned above with which the Government of Burma will in the event of separation be concerned. The result, so far as the Home and Political Department of the Local Government and the subjects dealt with by it are concerned, is shown in the appended lists, marked A and B. It is presumed that all Treaties, Conventions, Agreements, etc. falling in either of the categories referred to above are within the cognizance of the Government of India, and I am to say that the Local Government in this Department would be greatly obliged if it could be supplied with a complete list of all Treaties, etc. with which it will be concerned, in the event of separation, so far as the subjects dealt with in this Department are concerned. A list of these subjects is appended as statement C. I 4 .. I am to add that the Government of India will be addressed separately by the other Departments of the Local Government with regard to the Treaties, etc. relating to subjects dealt with in these Departments.

Such Treaties, etc. appear to fall into two categories:- (a) Those contracted by the British Government which are at present binding upon Burma as part of the Indian Empire, with which the Government of India as the Central Government in India, and not the local Government, are at present concerned, bux with which the Government of Burma will become concerned in the event of separation; and (b) those contracted by the Government of India, the rights and liabilities under which will presumably pass to the Government of Burma under the enactment effecting separation, if separation takes place.^n n 2 . &lt;fcffcS 2 .

Such Treaties, etc. appear to fall into two categories (a) Those contracted by the British Government which are at present binding upon Burma as part of the Indian Himpire, ’With which the Government of India as the Central Government in India, and not the Local Government, are at present concerned, but with which the Government of Burma will become concerned in the event of separation; and (b) those contracted by the Government of India, the rights and liabilities under which will presumably pass to the Government of Burma under the enactment effecting separation, if separation takes place2 . 2.

The departments of the Government of India concerned have drawn up lists of treaties, etc., of the nature in question; and copies of these departmental lists are enclosed. These will indicate the subjects on which present agreements exist which might require to be continued in some form on behalf of Burma in the event of its political separation. The actual legal or administrative necessity of such continuance has not, however, been examined here, and the lists can, as2 . indicated, be taken only as a guide to the subjects on which a separated Burma might wish or require to execute separate treaties. 5 . The list compiled by the Commerce Department relates to treaties, etc., from 1931 only. Information relating to treaties entered into before May 1931 is contained in a M List of Treaties of Commerce, etc., and of certain Multilateral Treaties, which are applicable to the Dominions, to Inoia, to British Colonies, Protectorates, or Mandated Territories’ 1 .

BY AIR MAIL. WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 28th September 1936. My dear Seymour, Y/e have recently had under examination the question or the position of separated Burma in relation to existing treaties ana conventions and I am desired to communicate to you for consideration the results of our preliminary investigation of this problem. 2. It is held here that the position of separated Burma, in relation to existing treaties, etc., is governed by the following two general principles: (a) Separated Burma will inherit without any exception all obligations under existing treaties, etc. which apply to her as a part of India, and should, equally, inherit the rights. (inheritance of the obligations will be aitomatic: inheritance of the rights may not follow without appropriate action). (b) Conversely, Burma, on ceasing to be part of India, will not be bound by any treaties, etc. to which India is not a party but to which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom has acceded on behalf of the ’Colonies and overseas territories of His Majesty other than Dominions and inaia”, e.g. the International Labour Convention, 1927 for Sickness Insurance, and the Trade Marks Convention, 1898, between the United Kingdom and Costa Rica. 3.The existing agreements which apply to Burma as a part of India are of two kinds:- (i) Agreements which apply to India as being part of the whole British Empire which is a contracting party; (ii) Agreements to which India is a separate contracting A.H.Seymour Esq., I.C.S., party./ Government of Burma, Reforms Office, Maymyo.party No action is considered to be necessary in respect of the agreements falling within the former category, for, in so far as they apply to Burma as a part of India because they apply to the whole Empire (not specifically to India), they will continue to apply to separated Burma as being, equally with India, part of the Empire. As regards the agreements falling within category (ii), however, we are provisionally advised that, in order to ensure international recognition of Burma’s rights (including the right of denunciation where it is provided) under these agreements, as well as the obligations, it will be necessary to notify to the other parties concerned separated Burma’s acceptance of existing obligations and her expectations in respect of existing rights. Some of the agreements in this category, however, may entail obligations which were properly undertaken by India and consequently had to be undertaken by Burma as part of India, but which the circumstances of separation renders it unsuitable for Burma to inherit. In this connection equally a notification would be necessary. 4. Similarly, it is tnought to be necessary to take action to ensure international recognition of the fact that L Burma, on ceasing to be part of India, will not be bound by those conventions and agreements to which India is not a party but to which H.M.G. in the United Kingdom has acceded on behalf of the ’’Colonies and overseas territories of His Majesty other than the Dominions and India”. On the other hand, it will be open to Burma to assume obligations binding upon the United Kingdom, but not at present upon India, and in some cases it may be for consideration whether as a matter of policy she should not do so. For example, it may be found possible for separated Burma, (though it is not possible for India/3 India and was therefore not possible for Burma when included in India) to accept the obligations of the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, and if so, it may be considered desirable that she should now do so particularly in view of the probability that she will participate in the affairs of the League of Nations and the International Labour Office through the medium of His Majesty^ Government in the United Kingdom which has ratified the Convention. 5. We think it necessary, therefore, that we should first of all examine all existing treaties and agreements in respect of which action^o regularise the position of separated Burma will be required, and decide to what extent it is proper on merits for Burma to continue to bear exactly the same obligations as she has at present as a part of India, and also whether there are obligations not at p? esent binding upon India which Burma might with advantage assume. 6* I enclose seven statements of treaties and conventions which we have compiled in this regard and I should be glad of your comments upon the tentative suggestions contained therein as to the action that is required. I am to explain that these suggestions should be taken not as giving even the provisional views of the Secretary of State, but simply as suggestions by the various Departments of this Office intended to serve as a basis for consideration. On receipt of the comments of the Government of Burma and of the Government of India, to whom a copy of this letter is being communicated, the matter will be further considered and the Foreign Office then informed of the action we require to be taken. I must also explain that it has not yet been possible to check the completeness of the statements and I should therefore be glad to be informed of any omissions that may be discovered.

This treaty secures certain rights for British Subjects and ships (which phrase includes Indian and BurmeseBr 0 subjects and ships whether or not the treaty applies to India and Burma). India signed separately but this appears to make no difference to the effect of the treaty. It probably matters very little whether any communication is made about this treaty or not but to do so might suggest that we have doubts as to what would be the position of Burmese subjects or ships if no action about them were taken, and this might have unfortunate reactions in respect of other treaties covering Indian and Burmese British subjects and ships. It might be best to take no action at all 0 India signed and ratified separately. It may be thought that a communication to the Governments concerned about regularising the position of Burma in relation to this treaty (which covers much more than commercial matters) might give a rather exaggerated idea of the status of separated Burma. It is not easy to conceive of a situation arising of which India (much less Burma) would be allowed to claim a right of separate denunciation of the treaty - which contains no provision for denunciation by any party,. It might be best to take no action. - ditto - Most of this treaty is thought to be out of date. Perhaps it should be dealt with like the preceding treaty, as otherwise we might get involved in difficulties if we had to explain why we wished to differentiate between them in the present connection. India signed separately. Presumably Burma® s continued adhesion as a separate party could be notified under Article 25 &gt; In that event points which would need to be settled are (1) declaration of class - see Article 23; and (2) resulting contribution. On the other hand, Burma could continue to adhere through the representation of the United Kingdom and avoid payment of a contribution. For example, Newfoundland has acceded under Article 26 and her interests are represented by His Majesty* s Government in the United Kingdom and she does not pay a contribution. India signed separately. Convention contains a Colonial Clause (Article 62)» Formal notification of Burma’s continued adhesion as a separate party might be made under that clause. - ditto - The same remarks apply (Article 21). \ % 1INDIA OFFICE;, WHITEHALL, S.,Wolo 9th December 1935, r' So&amp; 0.8398/35.

We have consulted Reilly and accept gratefully the provisional offer of the Government of India to grant Aden salt exemption from the Additional Duty at least until the Salt (Additional Import Daty) Act 1931 as amended comes to an end at the end of April 1938. This proposal is of course perfectly satisfactory from our point of view.

This is one of the matters that are at present under discussion between ourselves and the Colonial Office and Sir Bernard Reilly, Resident and chief Commissioner of Aden, who is at present on leave. The discussion of this particular matter took place on the 19th June and was attended by Mr. K. Anderson. On the day before the meeting a letter was received from the Government of India, Finance department, dated 11th June. This letter is attached. Copies of it were circulated informally at the meeting, which was informed that we were sending a letter to the Colonial Office. A draft letter is attached. Will Mr. Anderson kindly say whether he concurs in the portion about income tax. As regards salt, will the E.&amp; 0.Department say whether they have any observations to make on the Government of India's remarks or on the relevant paragraph in the draft letter to the Colonial Office. Presumably if the Government/♦ c 5+5 2 Government of India are ready to make this concession, so much the better. As regards the small points raised in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10, no action appears to be required in regard to paragraph 8. The point in paragraph 9 will presumably be one for the Governor to deal with at or after separation. as regards paragraph 10, perhaps the Secretary, E.&amp; 0.Department will suggest what action if any is required.? Secretary , Political Department : SALT. From the point of view of the United Kingdom there has always been some ground of principle against the continuance after Separation of the Indian preference in favour of the produce of the Indian and Italian salt works in Aden. Such a continuance would involve the grant to one unit of the Colonial Empire of a preference which is not extended to the United Kingdom, and although - there is no express provision in the Ottawa Agreement .

That expectation is not now to be realised and the duty is to continue (though at a lower rate) for another two years. It will thus extend, even if there is no unforeseen continuance of the duty, for more than a year after Separation, and the Jjp reference wtM survivewith it The Government of India ask for the views of H.M.G. on this question and i-t ue-omo that the Board of Trade have a reasonable claim to have their views considered. It would seem therefore that the letter to the Colonial Office should remind hat the preference extended to salt from Aden as a part of India has not continuance after Separation is a matter on which the Board of Trade may feel some interest, I do not see any special reason why the India Office should agitate themselves on the subject, but as regards the Board of Trade, see E.&amp; 0, 1944/36, For us the matter is^trifling and there is no reason to think that even when the duty disappears Aden salt will find any difficulty in holding its own in the Bengal market. been extended to the United *7 OPIUM.

But in the case of Aden there is this difference, that her future in respect of opium will be governed by the Colonial Office and not from here. It is accordingly a matter rather for the Colonial Office than for us to consider the proposals now made. They may find difficulty in agreeing to the continuance of the Indian supply, inasmuch as this involves a differentiation between Aden and other units of the Colonial Empire. It would seem that the first step should be to invite the views of the Colonial Office on the Government of Indian proposals in paragraph 10 of the letter of 11th June, sending them at the same time copy of the despatch of the 5th May, 1932 about the case of Burma.

My dear Baxter, Aden—Separation of—^Arrangements in connection with Central Revenue subjects. The Government of India have just heard for the first time (through an incidental reference in the Secretary of State’s telegram R.No.1677, dated the 30th of May 1936, relating to the India Burma Trade and Immi gration Agreements) that it is now contemplated that the date of the separation of Aden will be the 1st of April 1937. It seems therefore desirable that no time should be lost in beginning the consideration, frcm the adminis trative point of view, of the measures that will be neces sary to tie up the loose ends that would otherwise be left when the separation takes place. I am, of course, con cerning myself only with the subjects with which this branch of the Finance Department deals. 2. Income-tax . There is no provision relating to Aden in the Government of India Act, 1935, comparable to section 159 of that Act, so that no arrangements for double income-tax relief as between India and Aden after separation will be possible under Order in Council. If there is to be such a scheme, it will have to depend upon an agreement between the Government of India and whatever department of His Majesty’s Government takes over the administration of Aden; for brevity I shall venture- 2 - in this letter to use the expression 'Colonial Office' when I mean to refer to that department. Such an agreement, since it would not be enforced under the G-ovemment of India Act, would be entirely voluntary for the two adminis trations concerned and would be terminable at will. In India we could give effect to such an agreement by an order under section 60(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, comparable to the orders under which we allow double income-tax relief as between British India and Indian States. 3. I have not the material to estimate the revenue significance of this proposal. The average collections under 'taxes on income' in Aden in the two years ending 31st lySarch 1935 were about 4 lakhs; but much of this must have come from incomes that will not after separation become liable to double taxation. We could only get figures for the balance by making hypothetical assessments in British India under section 4(2), section 42, etc., of our Act. Then again, at least two of the salt concerns are at present assessed in Bombay and there are probably other business concerns in a like case. Here again, we could only get an idea of the revenue involved by making hypothetical assessments of so much of the profits as would have fallen liable to assessment in Aden also if that territory had been already separated. 4. We have already considered roughly the outlines of such an agreement which we should suggest if the 'Colonial Office' desired to enter into it. It seems to us that the problem of triple taxation as between the United Kingdom, Aden and India is likely, if it arises at all, to be of such negligible importance that it is desirable to leave it out of account; and our gsneral idea is that the lines of-3- As the arrangement should follow the Indo-Burma scheme, with the elimination of this particular complication. We should propose that, as with the India and Burma arrangement, relief should be shared in proportion to the rates of tax in the two countries, and that we should adhere to the rate' basis instead of the 'amount of tax' basis, which was adopted in the case of Ceylon. Will you please have the necessary enquiries instituted to see whether the 'Colonial Office' wishes to enter upon such an agreement before the actual date of separation, so that we can agree upon the terms of the respective notifications that are to be issued by the two administrations? 5. Another group of problems in connection with income-tax which will have to be considered in due course is the same as that which we referred to in our telegram No.1218 dated the 21st of May 1936 about the draft Order in Council fixing the initial rates of income-tax for Burma—in particular, the problem regarding the effect of deductions at source before separation under section 18 and the comparable problem arising out of the operation of section 14(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act. It would be best to leave the details of these in the case of Aden for settlement after we have got further with our discus sions with Burma. 6. Salt. So far as the duty on salt consumed in Aden is concerned, there seems to be no difficulty. That duty and the royalties on salt produced in Aden will, of / course, now go to the Aden Administration instead of going to Central revenues. Duty on salt from Aden imported into Britisn India will continue, as at present, to be collected in British India. One point which is deserving of special attention is the effect of the separation upon-4- the Salt (Mditional Import Duty) Act, 1931, as amended. This Act now extends till the end of April 1938; i.e., for 13 months after the projected date of separation. So far as the substantive taxing portion is concerned (sections 3 and 4), no change will arise apart from the omission, as otiose, of the words 'except Men and Perim' from sub-section (1) of section 3. What we have to consi der is whether the relief which sub-section (1) of section 5 grants in certain conditions to salt produced in India shall in future be extended to salt produced in India and Aden. Provisionally, the Government of India are inclined to the view that, so long as the present life of the Act endures, this change should be made. The reasons in favour of this course are as follows. When the Bill which became the Extending Act of the current year was before the Legis lature, I thinx that all parties, like ourselves, had a general idea that an extension up to the 30th of April 1938 was not likely to carry us over the date of separation. Nothing has been said about this in public; but, as I say, there was a vague impression that the separation of Men was likely to be postponed until somewhere about the date of the inauguration of the Federation. We can, therefore, regard ourselves as having a mandate from the Legislature to give the benefit of the provision mentioned to Aden throughout the life of the Act. There is also, of course, the consideration that three out of the four works are owned by Indian concerns. On the other side of the case, there are the following facts. The claim of the Indian concerns in Aden to consideration has been exaggerated, as we pointed out in paragraphs 2 to 6 of our letter in this department, No.C.55-Gl./33, dated the 13th of February 1933, and in the second paragraph of F.&amp; P. Department letterNo.F.143-N/35, dated the 11th of April 1935. There is further the consideration that after separation the Grovern- ment of India will cease to be the owners of these salt works, will not draw royalty from them and will not have the same power to control them that they have at present under the conditions of the leases. Whatever validity these latter considerations may have as against the main tenance of special treatment of the Aden salt works for a lengthy period, the Government of India are disposed to think that they should not outweigh the argument on the other side so far as the remaining period of 13 months is concerned; but before they reach a final decision they will be glad to have the views of His Majesty’s Government. 7. As already mentioned, this letter is meant to deal rather with administrative than legal considerations but I migjit point out that even if (as I personally believe) it would be outside the scope of an Order under section 293 or any other provision of the Government of India Act, 1935, to provide that section 5(1) of the Salt (.Additional Import Duty) Act, 1931, should be adapted so as to refer to salt produced in India or Aden, it will nevertheless be possible, if the Government of India decide in favour of such a course to give effect to the decision by the issue of a notifica tion under section 23 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878. 8. Customs. There can be no possible problem under this head because Aden has always been treated as a foreign port in the administration of the customs law in all other parts of British India and will merely continue to be so treated. All that will happen will be that the provision of the Sea Customs Act declaring Aden to be a foreigp port will have became otiose.- 6 - &lt;&amp; 9. S tamps and Excis e. These taxes are so local in character that there should be no problem arising out of separation. It will only be necessary to safeguard the validity of acts done before separation, e.g., the admissi bility of instruments relating to Men which were lawfully stamped elsewhere m in British India before separation. 10. Opium and Dangerous Dru^s . So far as revenue is concerned, the position is the same as with other excises. So far as the adherence to international agreements is con cerned, it is, of course, safe to assume that the 'Colonial Office' will naintain all the obligations that we have our selves accepted, and the only point to be mentioned is that we should be able to claim vis- a-vis the rest of the world that after separation we are entitled to continue to supply opium to Men, if Men desires to have it, on exactly the same footing as at present. The Secretary of State has already reached a similar decision as regards the continued supply of opium from India to Bunm after separation in the event of Burma’s requiring it (see paragraph 3 of Secretary of State’s Despatch, Public No.31, dated the 5th May,1932).

Introductory and General. 1. This Order may be cited as the India and Burma (Income Tax Relief) Order, 1936. 30 2. The Interpretation Act, 1889, applies for the interpretation of this Order as it applies for the interpretation of an Act of Parliament. 3. Any reference in this Order to, or to any provisions of, the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, shall be construed as a reference to 35 that Act or those provisions as for the time being in force in India, as for the time being in force in Burma or as for the time being in force both in India and in Burma, as the context and the 4327 4, 4,100, 50 6.365 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 circumstances may require, or, if that Act or those provisions have been repealed and re-enacted, either with or without modifications, to the re-enacting Act or provisions as in force as aforesaid. 4. In this Order, “income tax” or “tax,” in relation to India or Burma, means income tax payable in accordance with the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, and includes super tax so payable; and other expressions have, except where the context otherwise requires, the same meanings as in the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. 5. References in this Order to the rate of tax shall— (a) in relation to India or Burma, be construed as references to a rate determined by dividing the amount of income tax paid in India or Burma, as the case may be, for the year in question (before deduction of any relief granted under section forty-nine of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, or under this Order) by the amount of the income on which tax was charged ; (b) in relation to the United Kingdom, mean the appropriate rate of United Kingdom income tax for the year in question as defined for the purposes of section twenty- seven of the Finance Act, 1920. 6 . Any reference in this Order to the lower of two rates shall, where the rates are equal, be construed as a reference to either of those rates, and any reference in this Order to the two lowest of three rates shall, where the three rates are equal be construed as a reference to any two of them, and where two of the three rates are equal and the third is less, be construed as a reference to the lowest rate and one of the equal rates. 7. This Order shall have effect with respect to the financial year beginning on the date of the commencement of Part III of the India Act and every subsequent financial year : Provided that if, at any time after the expiration of three years from the commencement of Part III of the India Act, the Governor- General of India gives to the Governor of Burma, or the Governor of Burma gives to the Governor-General of India, notice of his desire that this Order shall cease to operate, the Order shall not have effect with respect to any financial year subsequent to the financial year next following that during which the notice is given. PART II. Relief in India. 1. If any person who has paid Indian income tax for any year on any part of his income proves to the satisfaction of the Income- tax Officer that he has paid for that year Burman income tax, or Burman income tax and United Kingdom income tax, in respect of that part of his income, he shall be entitled to a refund of Indian tax calculated on that part of his income at the appropriate rate of relief.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 3 In this paragraph “ appropriate rate of relief ” means— (a) in relation to income taxed in India and Burma and not in the United Kingdom, a rate bearing to the Indian rate of tax or the Burman rate of tax, whichever is the lower, the same proportion as the Indian rate of tax bears to the sum of the Indian rate of tax and the Burman rate of tax ; (b) in relation to income taxed in India, Burma and the United Kingdom, a rate bearing to the difference between the total rate at which he was entitled to, and obtained, relief in the United Kingdom under section twenty-seven of the Finance Act, 1920, in respect of that income, and the sum of the two lowest of the three rates of tax the same proportion as the Indian rate of tax bears to the sum of the Indian rate of tax and the Burraan rate of tax. 2.

In the provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (other than the provisions of section forty-nine thereof)— (a) any reference to that Act or to section forty-nine thereof shall be construed as including a reference to this Part of this Order ; (b) any reference to section twenty-seven of the Finance Act, 1920, shall be construed as including a reference to Part III of this Order ; (c) any reference to the United Kingdom in relation to relief under the said section twenty-seven, or in relation to refunds under the said section forty-nine, shall be construed as including a reference to Burma in relation to refunds under Part III of this Order or this Part of this Order, as the case may require.

In this paragraph “ appropriate rate of relief” means-- (a) in relation to income taxed in Burma and India and not in the United Kingdom, a rate bearing to the Burman rate of tax or the Indian rate of tax, Avhichever is the lower, the same proportion as the Burman rate of tax bears to the sum of the Burman rate of tax and the Indian rate of tax ; (b) in relation to income taxed in Burma, India and the United Kingdom, a rate bearing to the difference between the total rate at which he was entitled to, and obtained, relief in the United Kingdom under section twenty-seven of the Finance Act, 1920, in respect of that income, and the sum of the two lowest of the three rates of tax the same proportion as the Burman rate of tax bears to the sum of the Burman rate of tax and the Indian rate of tax. 2.

I have noted on the separate file. (2) Salt . I presume that you are obtaining the views of E. &amp; 0. Department. (3) Pensions . I think you are right in saying tha pensions must he added to the draft Budget, hut as far as I can make out, the addition should he about Rs.19,000 or so per annum. On the other hand, I do not understand what has happened to the partially offsetting item of receipts in aid of superannuation, estimated at Rs.11,000 in this year*s demands for grants. (Similarly I do not understand what has happened to the interest heads). (4) In general, I doubt if we can usefully criticise a document of this kind in great detail. Attention has already been drawn to the main problems arising. For the rest, the estimates appear to follow pretty closely the existing position so far as it is relevant. 4A THE RESIDENCY, Aden, 5th May 193 6. Dear Walton, Will you please refer to Laithwaite's letter to me 3?. Z. 7877/33 dated 4th December 1933 enclosing copies of my letter of the 10th August 1933 on points arising in connection with the transfer of Aden, and of the minutes of the meeting at the Foreign Office at which my letter was discussed? As it has been proposed that 1 should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were then discussed, ard adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. 1 also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.R.Reilly. J.C.Walton, Esq., C.B.,M.C.,M.A., India Office, London.Point 15. Budget, At present the finances of Aden and of the Aden Protectorate are entirely separate, the former being controlled by the Govermient of India and the latter by the Colonial Office. A budget for Aden is submitted annually to the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India and all receipts and expenditure are crecited and debited to the Government of India. Aden has no separate financial existence. Income Tax due from several firms doing business in Aden is collected from their Head Offices in India and not from their branches in Aden. The accounts of the Post Office and Telephones and of the Mercantile Marine Department (including Lighthouses), which-13- are directly administered by the Goverunent of India and not through the Chief Commissioner, are dealt with in India and not in Aden and do not appear in the Aden budget* The latter therefore in its present form is not an accurate presentation of Aden's financial position as a whole. After the transfer there will have to be a comprehensive budget showing all Aden Government revenue and expenditure, and, as both Aden and the Aden Protectorate will then be under the control of the Colonial Office the question arises whether the Aden and the Aden Protectorate budgets should be combined. This is a point on which I desire instructions. I suggest that there might be one budget divided into two parts — Civil (for Aden) and Political (for the Protectorate). The finances of Aden and of the Aden Protectorate could thus be kept distinct for local purposes, but would be combined in the budget submitted for approval annually to the Colonial Office* A grant-in-aid from His Majesty's Government will be necessary and it should include, in addition to actual expenditure on the Protectorate, all contributions at present made by His Majesty's Govenxnent towards civil services, for 'i example, Police, Civil Hospital, Residency and Treasury Establishments. It is hoped that the remaining expenditure on Aden can be met from local revenue, but this will depend (c) the future position of Aden with regard to trade with Abyssinia which may possibly be diverted from Aden as a result of future developments in that country. I am submitting, as an accompaniment to this note, a draft estimate for an Aden budget (as distinct from the Protecto rate) based on the actuals of the last three years and on the assumption that existing expenditure on personnel and services largely on (a) the amount of income tax that will be realised from finis doing business in Aden which at present do not pay income tax here, do (b) the future of the Aden Salt Industry, andwill be maintained, but with the addition of the increased revenue that it is hoped to receive and of increased expenditure that appears to be unavoidable. These increases are calculated on estimates that can at present be only tentative. They will need further examination in the light of fuller infoimation regarding future income tax receipts and the prospects of the Salt Industry and of the Abyssinian trade, and in relation to whatever decisions are made by His Majesty's Government Regarding future administrative personnel and other details of administrative expenditure, such as ecclesiastical establishment and lighthouses.Draft Estimates for a future Budget have 'been prepared based on the figures of revenue and expenditure of the last three years 1992-33 to 1934-35 and on anticipated revenue and expenditure after the transfer. Leave and Pension contributions for Gazetted Officers lent by the \jovemment of India on deputation to the Aden Administration have been calculated at 40jf throughout in accordance with Fundamental Rule 116, Government of India 9 s decision (l)(li), andin the case of subordinate Establishments &amp; 12$£ (or 1/6^ Deputation allowances have been calculated $ 20% of the pay of the officers concerned.
