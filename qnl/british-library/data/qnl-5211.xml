I understand that there are at least 100 cases in Bahrain many of whom are foreigners. The question of dealing with these persons is under consideration, it may be necessary to start a small leper settlement in some suitable place. Some of the lepers are Persians and I should be obliged if you would let me know whether it would be reasonable to repatriate such cases to the country of origin. If a leper settlement is started the people in it will have to be fed and housed by the Bahrain Government but the State does not feel any obligation to spend country to Bahrain.
