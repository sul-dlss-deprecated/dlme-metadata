One in July 192^ (see page 87 flagged 'R') and the other in January 1932 (see page 267 flag 'M M ). Both, His Excellency ShaiJch hamad and the adviser were informed of the P.R^s visit (see pp 95 and 96J. During the first occasion a tentative programme was telegraphed but it was obviously not fulfilled in toto as the P.R. left on Thursday (see p.107). On tne occasion of this visit, however, we telegraphed(see p.90) asking % if P.A. should visit in mufti as P.R^ visit was private. To this a reply was received that P.A. should xxsxt pay official call on S.N.O. As far as 1 remember when P.R. comes on mail steamers the P.A. always goes out in mufti. During the 2nd visit of the P.R. no visits were paid, and the P.A. went out to the kail in mufti. When the late Col. Sir Hugh Biscoe received the K.B.E. the agency gave a garden party in the Baladiyeh garden and speeches were made. 1 am sorry I have not been able to trace any correspondence regarding decorations to H.E.

I have succeeded my father, the late Shaikh Easa bin Al^, A1 Khalifa in the rilership of Bahrain. I am filled with vigour and energy and the desire to advance and elevate my country. \ The good wishes of His Excellency the Viceroy of India and the representatives of Great Britain have doubled my activity. Moreover the lyal- loyalty and support of my subjects have encouraged me to take more and more interest in their welfare, and also the welfare of my country. Your country, 0 my subjects, has reached its present stage of advancement by means of the zeal ability and sacrifices of your great ancestors. So also, you are to follow their ways, especially in the present circumstances, and to do your utmost for the welfare of your country and the Advancement of your nation. Your Government will support you in reaching that goal, for the Government encourages the industrious in office, and leads them along the path to happiness. Bahrain and the neighbouring sea-coast has every right to boast; for they embraced Islam without war/and yielded themselves to the right, contented with Islam. The first and largest tribute which was furnished to the Muslim Treasury during the development of Islam was that of Bahrain. Consequently the people of Bahrain have the right to boast -of their glorious history.. Bahrain has progressed under different Islamic powers, jthat is to say, under the first Four Khalifas, who succeeded the Prophet, the Ommayads, and latterly the Ahtasites. The Khalifah Omar bin Abdulaziz appreciated the services rendered by Bahrain to Islam during its development by providing the Muslim Treasury with the above-mentioned tribute. As a compensation, the Khalifah Omar bin Abdulaziz built in Bahrain the Mosque with the two minarets, which you see in the Suq el Khamis-----it is a noble end ancient monument. Bahrain remained under the rule of our Arab ancestors except for short intervals of time, during which it was under various Persian powers and the Portuguese. Our ancestors were in constant warfare with those powers until recently, when our grand-father Shaikh Ahmed bin Kuhummad Al Khalifa, known as ’’The Conqueror” recovered Bahrain from them in the year 1197 A.H. Subsequently Shaikh Nasr al Madhkoor with Ed-dhiriyabki, who was then residing in Bushire, and requested him to beg the Persian Government to supply him with arms and troops in the hope of re-capturing Bahrain from the Al Khalifah. v But the troops were badly defeated by the Al Khalifah in a battle known as 'Nasoor', which is mentioned in some of the poems of our Brother Shaikh Muhummad. Our Grandfather ruled Bahrain until he died, and his ■&gt;r\ tomb is in a spot nearby.V (&amp;) Bahrain Became secure under the rule of the Al Khalifah, our ancestors, end the Arabs enjoyed peace and security under our ' rule. v/ The Al Khalifah proved that they are 4 noble and gallant by sending the family of the above-mentioned Shaikh Nasr al Madhkoor to live with him at Bushire.^ The Al Khalifah were and are still treating the people, both natives and foreigners, with justice. ^Most of the foreigners who came to Bahrain were poor; end in a very short time they became wealthy. Shaikh Sulman bin Ahmed and his brother, Shaikh Abdullah bin Ahmed, succeeded their father, and ruled Bahrain. Then these two were succeeded by Shaikh Muhur..mad bin Khalifah and his brother, Shaikh Aly bin Khalifah. During the period of their rule, several wars took place, in which the Al .JChalifah shed their blood and sacrificed their wealth, their-triteles- their sons and their tribes to defend their native, country, Bahrain. These wars were fought sometimes against their neighbouring Rulers, and sometimes to ^subdue sedition, and in the last of these our Grandfather, Shaikh Aly bin Khalifah died in the defence of his country. ^ He was succeeded by our late Father, Shaikh Easa bin Aly Al Khalifah, wh^ ruled without prejudice, treating all people of different kinds alike. He confirmed our relations with Great Britain, as the result of which, mutual confidence prevailed until his death, which confidence I am eager to strengthen and maintain.GENTLEMEN: I seize this opportunity to commit to your charge the duty to he true and loyal in what you say and do, and to do your utmost to improve the condition of your country.

At the gate of the fort a small guard-of-honour was drawn up,which presented arms for the Hon ? ble the Political Resident. The ,. but Guard was not inspected k}c the Hon T ble the Political Resident asked various questions about the different men. 2. The IIon f ble the Political•‘ u esident accompanied by the Political Agent,the Adviser and Laji Salman looked at the various squads at drill,bayonet fighting,musketry drill and also saw some recruits learning to turn about. 3. The Party then proceeded inside the fort and saw the quarters,office and water supply. 4. At this point news was brought that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin isa al Khalifah had arrived (this was quite unexpected) and the Party went out to meet him at the door of the fort. His Excellency presented a third star(badge of rank) to Haji Salman. Although he has the badges of rank,de is not given a Military title. 4. A photograph was then taken of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and his party and the non T ble the Political Resident f s party. Cofiee and itr and aud were then served,after which the Hon ! ble the Political Resident returned to the Agency,prior to going to the Larbar at the Baladiyah. 5.

A number of speeches were read but the proceedings were not unduly prolonged as an intimation had been sent that the uon T ble the Political Resident was photograph was taken,which included Hrs.Loch and LIrs.helgrav 3. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad then asked whether he should come and see the Hon ! ble the Political Resident later or whether they should say good-bye then. The Hon T ble the Political ■ u esident said that he was sure it would be more convenient to say good-bye then and His Excellency followed the non T ble the Political Resident to the Agency.

He was met at the entrance of the school by some of the Shaikh T s men and joined the Shaikh in a small side room, when they proceeded to enter by the south door-way and walked up between the lines of guests,followed by the Political Agent and the Adviser. The Larbar went off in accordance with the Programme,though there was some difficulty in firing the salute for the Kharitah,as one of the gunners had been injured. 2. The Shaikh’s speech was made by Shaikh Muhammad bin isa al Khalifah. 3. it is a local custom that when a speech is made a copy of it is handed to the person to whom the speech is addressed, iruC % the Hon’ble the Political resident did not hand over his speech. A copy of the speech and translation was,however,sent privately to the Adviser for the information of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad. The Adviser asked verbally for this on the 12th February and 1 said that 1 would send one privately to him,but that,as a general rule,I thought that it was better not to communicate written copies of speeches ana that,therefore,I aid not want to create a precedent of handing speeches over in public. 4. Alter the Larbar a photograph was taken of those who were seated on the dais (photographs were taken at all the functions that were attenaea). 5. There was an immense crowd of people. All seemed cheerful. 6. It is an interesting point that when the saluting guns were iirst drawn up they were pointed to the cemetery,but were turned to another direction when the salutes were fired in case the firing should disturb the inhabitants of the cemetery.On the 8th February 1938 His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Xhalifah called on the Hon T ble the Political nesiaent informally at 09.80 hours at the Agency and the Resident paid a return call at about 10 t 15 hours at the Palace.

Naval Commander-in-Chief visit **) ■Bahrain****. 3. On the evening of the 8th February the Agency house party dined with Mr.and Mrs.Belgrave and a separate note is on the Etiquette File. 4. While returning from the visit to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad ; the Hon f ble the Political Resident and the Political Agent looked in at the school building,which was being decorated for the Darbar,in order to see what the room would be like on the next day. 5. When the translation of the Hon T ble the Political Resident T s speech had been finished,Mr.Jasim,who was to read it,made a trial reading in the verandah of the Agency house. 6.

There were five Officers from H.M.S ’’Triad”,five from H.M.S ’’Ormonde” and four Royal Air Force Officers,excluding the Senior Naval Oiticer and the Air Commodore. The Officers lunched in uniformi i r; i * » 2 . as it was convenient,but the non T ble the Political li esiaent and the Political Agent changed after lunch.

Champagne was served. 12. After dinner a dance was held from 21.00 hours to 24.00 hours. Most of the Officers of both Ships ana the Royal Air Porce attended. The date of the dance was changed?owing to the unexpectedly early departure of the Senior Naval Officer,from the evening of the 10th to the evening of the 9th February. 13. The Senior Naval Officer sailed in K.M.S ’’Triad” early on the morning of the 10th February. 14. On the morning of the 10th February at 10.00 hours Khan Sahib Haji Yusif bin Ahmad Kanoo came by appointment to see the Hon’ble the Political Resident, ne seemed to regard some of the points made in the speech as useful to the administration. He asked the Hon’ble the Political Resident to lunch or dine with him. The invitation had been previously refused and the hon’ble the Political Resident said that he was still unable to come this time on account of business,but would do so on the next occasion when he hoped to be less busy. 15.a 15. On the afternoon of Friday (10th February) the IIon f ble the Political Resident,the Political Agent and Mrs.Loch went to the Palace to see Arab dances and a horse display.

Your Excellency the Political Resident, and Gentle en: I have succeeded my father, the late Shaikh Isa bin Ali A1 Khalifah in the rulcrship of Bahrain, I am filled with vigour and energy and the desire to advance and elevate my country. The good wishes of His Excellency the Viceroy of India and the representatives of Great Britain have doubled my activity. Moreover the loyalty and support of my subjects have encouraged me to take more and more interest in their welfare, and also the welfare of my country. Your country, 0 my subjects, has reached its present stage of advancement by means of the zeal, ability and sacrifices of your great ancestors. So also, you are to follow their ways, especially in the present circumstances, and to do your utmost for the welfare of your country and and the advancement of your nation. Your Government will support you in reaching that goal, for the Government encourages the industrious in office, and leads them along the path to happiness. Bahrain and the neighbouring sea-coast has every right to boast; for they embraced Islam without war, and yielded themselves to the right, contented with Islam. The first and largest tribute which was furnished to the Muslim Treasury during the development of Islam was that of Bahrain. Consequently the people of Bahrain have the right to boast of their glorious history. Bahrain has progressed under different Islamic powers, that is to say, under the firet Four Khalifas, who succeeded the Prophet, the Onmayads, and latterly the Abbasites. The Khalifah Cmar bin Abdulaziz appreciated the services rendered by Bahrain to Islam during its developmoit.by providing the Kuslim Treasury with the above-mentioned tribute . As a compensation, the Khalii’an Omar bin Abdul Aziz built in Bahrain the laosque with two minarets, which you see in tne Suq al Khamis - it is a noble and ancient monument. Bahrain remaiaed under the rule oi‘ our Arab ancestors except for short intervals of time, during which it was under various Persian powers and the Portuguese. Our ancestors were in constant warfare with those powers unlii recently, when our grand-father Shaikh Ahmed bin Muhammad Ai Khalifah, known as ”The Conqueror' recovered Bahrain from them in the year 11^7 A.H. Subsequently Ahaikh hasir al Kadhkoor with Ed-dhiriyabki, *iio was then residing in Bushire, and requested him to beg the Persian Government to supply him with arms and troops in the hope 01 recapturing Bahrain from tne a1 Khalifah. But the troops were badly defeated by tne ^1 Khalifah in a battle Inpwa as ‘ ; kfasoor'', which is mentioned in some of the poems of our Brother shaikh Muhammad. Our Grandiather ruled Bahrain until he died, and his t mb is in a spot ne rby. Bahrain became secure under the rule of the Al Khali fail, our ancestors, and the Arabs enjoyed peace and security under our rule. The Al Khalifah proved that they are noble and gallant by sending the family of the above- mentioned Shaikh Nasir al X.dhkoor to live with him at Bushire. The AX Khalifan were 1 and are still treating the people, both natives and foreigners, with justice, Most of the foreigners whj came to Bahrain were poor; and in a very short time they became wealthy. Shaikh Sulman bin Ah. ed and hie brother, Shaixh Abdullah bm .hiued, succeeedl their father, andcf ruled Bahrain.
