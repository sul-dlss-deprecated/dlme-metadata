The report is divided into sections using headings, which cover the following locations: Tehran, Ispahan, Fars, Bushire, Kerman, Seistan and Khorassan.The report discusses the threat posed to Britain's position in Persia, mainly by Turkish troops, but also by tribal groups which are reportedly under the influence of German agitators.The report states that the Persian Government has acquiesced in the formation of a force [South Persia Rifles] commanded by Sir Percy Sykes, which will be incorporated into the Persian army and will amount to 11,000 men.The report concludes that the situation across Persia is 'in the highest degree unstable', with Turkish forces occupying 30,000 square miles of Persian territory.The report is followed by a cutting from the
                           Daily Telegraph, dated 21 February 1917, which reports on a House of Lords session from the previous day, in which Earl Curzon [George Nathaniel Curzon] is reported to have spoken about Sir Percy Sykes's mission, and to have described the improvement in the general situation in Persia as considerable.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Secretary to the Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military operations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Armed forces</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000157#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000157#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
