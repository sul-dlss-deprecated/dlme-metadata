The experience which we have had oi thia new poet haa ahown that under present day conditions at Bahrain it is absolutely essential to the efficient conduct not only of the olitical Agency there, but oi ailairs at ^atai and tbe rrucial Coast. In the last fivs yews the importance ox Bahrain, si&gt;d of the volume and variety of the work oi its .olitical Agent has increased out of sll knowledge. There are now multitudinous questions connsctsd with Oil - tne Bahrain . etroleum Company is now in full swing there, with the Civil Air RMta - Bahrain is an important station on tne Civil Air Route to India, with the Royal Air lorce - who have recently made a considerable puretoss of land there, with the Navy - who have done likewise, with :bn Saud - the thorny matter ol transit dues for example, with the prospects of British trade - Bahrain is the largest port in the (Jttlf with the exception of Bnsrah and Mohammerah, with eraie - the ill-trsaV-ent of Eahrainis in that country, and so forth. In addition to ti.ese special problems the olitical Hgent has to keep an eye on, tud advise the Keside^ on the activities of the Bahrain Qoyarnsanti Law and Order, police finatiCHf / Thft Hon^le Mr.HeAeP aMetcaliet foreign secretary to the ^verment^lndia,If -2- inance, «tc. f in a&amp;aitlon to carrying out his o«n judicial dutiea att District ana G«csicns Judge, and over-sttein^ th# routimi cf hia office. 3 # Kor is this all. ^atar is likewise wiUiin the political area ot the rolitical A^eut ana at ^atai vyil activities are now be£inxiin^; in earnest* rurUM»i f viuring tii« ysst year or so I have placed the Trucial Coast| suo^cct course tc ny general control| under the i-oli.Afcei^tf Bahrain t wno - especislly with the developfitent 01 the Civil arai Strategical ..Ir aoutes - is more favour ibljr placed than any other iolitical Officer ior visiting it. 4^ X need not labour the point, which is suificiently obvious, that it is quite impossible for the political Agent to carry out his manifold duties indicated above without an Assistant, and the latter even during the short time the post has been in existence has proved himself very useful. When the olitical Agent is in residence the Assistant rolitic&amp;x Agent takes much of the routine duties which need supervision off the i olitical Agent 's shoulders, thus allowing the latter time for that personal contact with Arab Rotables which is one of the main ways by which we can keep and extend our influence at Bahrain - as elsewhere on U* Arab coast. *hen the i olitical Agent is on to ir the Assistant i-olitical Agent holds the fort, or, alternatively, goes on to ir whils the Political Agent remains at Headquarters. Loch, for instance, nas „ust returned iron a most useful and extended tour of the Trucial Coast (in connection with air xaciiities at Yas anu bu Jhabi | and with Urn collection of information with regard to the Blue Line) which would have been quite impossible if worth had not been in Bahrain to carry on during his absence. « ,I 70 -3- Tiisre ic oiio w r w&lt;uy too iii wnich tiiti Afteifl'tant oliIleal vgent aerve# a ua^iui purpose.

The Persi^i* Gulf Cadrei however, being a smell one this is aiificult, aud sometines impossible to arrange, since it geiierHli&gt; ^ntaait asking Government to send a relief orficer Iroc. India. This relief is neither easy for the Govemiu^nt oi' India to arrange nor satisfactory froiii ii\y point oi' view. It involves tne detailing of an officer to proceed to the Gulx at its wor i season, and for such a comparatively short period that he is only t ust beginning to bee one acquainted with the soaewhat peculiar local conditions when it is time ior him to hand over again to the regular incumbent of the post on U*e latter'a return iroa leave.

As you know the present situation is that the Government of India sanction the extension of the post of Assistant Political Agent by instalments of six months. This is not very satisfactory, but 1 was told in Delhi ikzr last March^)the Government of Indis intend to hang the question of the Assistant Political Agent on to the general question of the incidence of the cost of Bahrain, for which they - the Government of India - now pay 10(#, instead of 50/b as they think they ought to. Personally I rather agree with them. 3, Prior, vide paragraph 8 of his letter No.K # 24, dated the 23rd August 1930, pointed out that the revenue from Court fee stamps and prssport fees was more than twice the cost of the whole of the Agency Clerical establishment. 4• If this is still the case it would presumably influence the Foreign and Political Department towards the Assistant political Agent question, and also generally towards the question of incidence. Please go into the matter against my arrival. What 1 would lil^e to see, if it could be prepared without much trouble, is a table drawn up for the last five years showing on the one sidd the total annual cost of the Agency (without details) and of the Post Office, and on the other, the revenue from (1) Post Office (2) \y&lt;~ &gt; - l(y VA — Court / Lieut,-Colonel Gordon Loch Political Agen Bahra rCourt fee stamps (3) visa fees.

Sd . (Illegi ble ) Under Secretary to the Government of India.I htve the honour to inform you th&amp;t shortly after $he outbreak of war I received a comiHuni cation from the Director of Civil Aviation, Government of India, asking for details of my flying experience and enquiring whether I was prepared to serve in the General Duties Branch of the Royal JLir Force. I gave the required information (I have been in possession of flying licences both in India and England) and informed the Director of Civil Aviation that I was certainly prepared to serve in the Royal Air Force but drew his attention to the circular issued by the Political Department on the subject of officers in civil employ joining His Majesty's forces. 2. Shortly afterwards I received a further communication containing conditions of service in the Royal Air Force and enclosing an application form ^nich was to be filled in when I was informed that my services were required# 3* In view of the wishes expressed in the Political Department's circular I made no move to obtain permission to Join up; but now that the war has spread to the Middle East and the military situation in France has become critical/-critical I feel that all men with any specialised training^ especially with a knowledge of flying, must be urgently required. I therefore request that this, my application for permission to join the Royal Air Force,may be forwarded through the Honourable the Political Resident to the Government of India for favourable consideration. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain#NO. C/493 - 3/8 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 16th June 1340. From H# Weightman. Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a letter dated the 14th June 1940 from Mr. Hallows, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, applying for permission to Join the Royal Air Force. 2» Mr. Hallows consulted me before submitting this application and I came to the conclusion that in view of his special qualifications as a pilot it would not be improper to forward it for consideration. I need not' add that I shall be most reluctant to lose Mr. Hallows, but in view of the war situation every qualified pilot must be of value. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Political Agent, Bahrain. ^ tConfidential The ReBidency, Bushire, the 19th June, 1940* D.O.No.428-S Dear Weightman, i enclose a copy of a demi-official letter i^o. 57/P, dated the 15th June 1940, from Metcalfe, which explains itself. 1 mentioned to him, when he was here, that i was proposing to Government that Howes should take over the post of Publicity Officer from him in the autumn and that he should then become ''Political Officer, Trucial Coast' 1 . To this Government have now agreed. 2. i would be glad of your views in the matter. Whatever 1 may have thought when the post of Publicity Officer was originally created, Rushbrook Williams convinced me that we were doing much less than was being done in other parts of the world. Also, the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, is the only officer that we have in the Gulf who can be treated as a reserve, and if Metcalfe goes Howes will have to do both Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and Publicity Officer, unless we can find some one to take over the .Publicity work, it would be difficult to recommend to Government that one of the very few partially trained officers we have should leave us now, as there would be no one even with those qualifications to take their place. X o ur s^si n c e r e ly, H.Weightman Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain.Confidential . The Agency, Bahrain, dated 15th June 1940# D.0.Ko.57/l&gt;. Dear Colonel Prior, iioon after the War began, a circular carae to officers of the Political Department aaying that His Excellency the Viceroy realised that military officers in political employ doubtless felt that they should be more directly connected with our war effort than they were in their normal civil posts. His Excellency sympathised with these feelings but said that at this stage it was necessary to conserve man power and not weaken the civil administration unnecessarily; any officer however who had special qualifications could apply for military service. 2. Having only what 1 thought to be the normal military and civil qualifications of a military political officer of my age, i did not auendL in my name, more especially as at that time Indian units had more officers than were strictly needed • 3. The situation has now however completely changed. Our position in the West is critical; the war is now very close to India and the East and the Indian Army is being greatly expanded. In fact, it is abundantly clear that nothing short of a 100% direct war effort will enable us to achieve a final and conclusive victory and it therefore seems essential that the services of every young Englishman with any form of military training and experience should be utilised to their fullest extent. 4. it is true that i am employed by the Ministry of Information on propaganda work but i think you will agree The Hon'ble Lt .Col.G .G.JPrior, CIS., / that Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.that the peculiar conditions prevailing in the Persian Gulf limit my activities to a very great extent, in fact, it is not too much to say that whatever the intensity of local propaganda, only good war news can really influence local opinion and over that i obviously have no control. Further, you yourself gave me to understand that the Post of Publicity Officer in the Persian Gulf is primarily a training post created in order to find employment for surplus officers and only secondarily what it purports to be. 5. Such an arrangement obviously had merits a few months ago, but now i submit, with all respect, that the present grave circumstances seem hardly a time when the energies of a trained officer should be diverted away from the spheres for which his previous experience has already fitted him, by employing him, and then not primarily, on duties which every where else are entrusted to men without military knowledge and who are, in fact, in most cases, professional Journalists (vide my report on Publicity Centres in the Middle alaEt). I therefore feel in duty bound to ask you to place this, my request for more direct and complete *Jar employment before the proper authorities, lours sincerely, sd. H .D • l^e t calf e •- 2 - release every one wno c;in, by any shift, be sp; r d. (l recog nise that this may come a iit^ie iii from me since I heve for months been more or less on the t;rcaisffr list and I do not deny that I should be -iuite glad to leave Bahrain b^ the t;.mc my thr3c years are up* Jut I am ready to stay indefinitely), 3* My first idea tnen is that, however reluctcntly, we should give up trying to train young officers in war-tiae. Secondly, much as I shall miss him, I think Hallows as an air pilot should be the first to go. To cope with nis routine duties we might be ablv* to get a good Ixtra Aasisti.nt Commis sioner from india and I w 11 do the rest. Thirdly \&gt;e should try to get an over-age Journalist of the type of Main (Baghdad) as Publicity Officer, t ius enabling Metcalfe to go. This still leaves you with Howes in reserve to cover any delay in obtain- '.ng a now Publicity Ofi'icer ana ready to complete your score of three Political Agents tven Ln the unlikely event of my removal. (The prospects of reci ss Io ^ k grim if these pro posals are aaoptea but tnat cannot be helped. We might yet Jlqu eze in two or tnree weeks apiece). 4» All this is very different from my ideas of c couple of months ago; but one's ideas mact change with such shattering events as rn^ve receutx./ ocourrea. I feel we must temporarily abandon the lon^ vie* :.nd consider only the n eds of the i mmedi a t e f utur e. Yours sincerely. ■■I (k.rfiemumitliAiy. ^|S No - C/293 of 1940. | {J.

Their policy regarding the release of Political Officers for military service is still the same as was announced in their circular letter (ITo.^.SS(60)»B/39) dated the 27th September 1939, and they say that while there is every sympathy with your proper desire to take a more active part in the war, it is considered that officers % of the Indian Political Service can best serve the lanpire at the present time by carrying on with their regular duties . ■ I hope you will agree in the end that this is the right reply, as I am sure it is, even though it may seem disappointing at the moment. Yours sincerely, sd. C.G.Prior. R.I •Hallows, fisquire. Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain. J /WjL lb i ' ■J'IaAhaw' —■ ■Telegram From To Dated 14th December 1940 Hallows reports that under Storm*s advice he should undergo operation for appendicitis in the near future. Holmes considers it advisable to have it done in India rather than here and in view of these circumstances I suggest a relief may kindly be arranged to replace Hallows. Hallows also requests grant of medical leave to proceed to India for this purpose. Probably two months will be required. Albanrv ' Confidential D«0 # No.C/969-«3/8 Dated the 15th December 1940. I am venturing to write to you on the subject of Hallows 1 successor as Assistant Political Agent here. As you Informed me when you were here, Hallows Is due in any case to leave in the Spring but yesterday he told me that on medical advice he would have to have an operation for appendicitis as soon as it can conveniently be arranged# I have confirmed this from Dr. Storm who says that although there is no immediate hurry yet it is advisable for the operation to be done fairly soon. Hallows is advised by Holmes that it would be better to have this done in India since the surgeons there are more practiced in this particular line. I have therefore wired you in this connection. By the time he has recovered it will of course be nearly Spring N here and there would presumably be no obj-ct in his coming back again for a few weeks. 2. T therefore venture to suggest that the question of his successor might be taken up now and a relief arranged as early as possible since it always takes a considerable time for the jovernment of India to arrange the necessary relief in India for the person who is coming here and there is also the question of joining tlm« f etc. 3. In connection with this relief I think it is most important that an officer of the right temperament and capability should bot sent to fill this post. One person I had in mind who would, 1 think, be a success is young Keen (Captain P«T. Keen) who was Secretary at Kabul and organised /- Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel C. Q. Prior, C .I .E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.organised our games, sports, etc,, excellently - he was popular with the Afghans and also a painstaking and careful office worker. He would I think soon learn Arabic• If we could get him I feel that the scheme I had In mind and about which I have written separately for acquiring a recreation ground and arranging fixtures would have a better chance of success.

Q 0 W i enclose a copy of a letter dated 12th lLay 16 til 1942 from His Excellency the viceroy to Sir Henry Craik on the subject of allowing members of the Secretary of State f s Services to take up military duty. Please bring the contents of the letter to the notice of L»ixon. E.B.Wakefield Esquire^ ICS., Political Agent, Bahrain .My dear Craik 9 Reo&lt;iT6d jll D»0» Koc The Vic«roy , B Eou, New Delhi Kpy 12th , 1942. 16th I have had muth in my mind for many mcnthe past th of membere of the S«oretary of Stat« v s Serrioes of mllitaz to be allowed to take up nilitary duty in one fona or anoti I have seen at vmrioue times the repreaantatlone which have u^c.. made on the subject by Service Associations. I have myself disoussed the gene ^ral. issue not only with individual members of the S e ririces t but with individual Oovernori as opportunity has offered. The decision is a difficult ons 9 for while on the one hand one has the utmost sympathy with the natural anxiety of members bf the Services to share dirsctly in the dangers and the work of the fighting services 9 the S e cretary of State and I, in settling the policy to be adopted, have to wtigh a wide variety of consideraticne of much importance. 2. I need not set out those considerations in detail here, for they will be familiar to youj and # as you know, I have had tbim constantly under review. The conclusion to which, with great reluctance, I have in the past been driven, has consistently been that I could not properly agree to the release for military duty members of t e All *Xndia Services. I knew that that conclusion would be disappointing in a high degree to those officers who have been anxious to make themselves available} and, in case there should be any change in the situation which would admit of its modification, I have hitherto postponed any foriaal communication to you regarding it. 3. I have recently again reviewed the situation in consultation with His EKcellency the Commander in Chief. We remain, however, satisfied that there can be no modification of the decision of principle previously taken. But X should like you to know that that decision is one that has not been taken without the most careful examinationj that it has the full support or. the Commander in Chi«f| and that it is due in no way to any lack of appreciation on the part of the Commander in Chief or of myse-i of those many spontaneous offers of service of which we are av .are and which we so deeply value. You will however agree that whatever doubt there may have been in the minds of individual officers in the past as to whether or not they oould oe spared from their civil duties for military service, circumstanoes have changed very greatly in the last few months. .e threac India is no longer remote. The dangers to which we are exposed are known to all. As events in Burma have shown cxearly the burden that will fall on the civil administration of tnis ^ country if threats of invasion should materialise Will be immensely enhanced. In the supply field the accentuation c. Indians war effort has made it necessary to demand still mo^e officers from the irovinces to help us to discharge oa\ aati p Centre• The Provinces closeit to the firing line 0 case had to appeal for the ittut loan of members of itate^ Services from other Provinces• I feel that with this change in the war situation there ought no longer to be any uncertainty in the minds either of members of the sivices or of the public, as to the decisive value of the public serYice ^ , which can be rendered by members of the All -India .erv ec &amp; their existing civil posts as compared even with^the vs~je o. the work which they might do as members of ths fightxiig services, and as to the essential necessity in the inheres India and of the effective prosecution of the war ci their/?M in.i in their ciTil employment. I had in the past turned over ill my mind the j/i oaee for a pereonal oommunioation to individual members of the 3«rTiceB through OovernorB, the Home Mtmber and yourself from myself* I do nut think uh £.t in the circumetancea of today there is any necessity for aEcr such communication. But should you see advantage in letting Members of the Political Service see my present letter to you t I should readily agree to your doing so on hearing from you. I would also propose to take an early opportunity to make it clear in public, probably by question ana answer in the Legislature, the policy and attitude of Government « te in this matter. 4, I think, however, you will agree with me that the fact we are unable to spare members of the Services ior military duty makes it all the more essential to make sure^ that every man in the higher Services is actually engaged on work which he can feel to be worth while. In that conntction you may care to consider the possibility of speeding up training of new recruits, to enable them to shoulder responsibility as soon as possible; while at the same time I think that every effort should be made to ensure that complete liaison between the local mi i ar^ an oivil authorities which is so important and so valuable when an emergency arises. 5.

I have the honour to refer to the Eonpurahle the Political HesidenVs demi-official letter No. 16/42/6 dated the 5th January, 1940, to Mr. Weightman (copy enclosed for ready reference) and to say that it appears that no action has 'been taken upon the orders conveyed therein. In at least one case recently which should obviously have heen conducted hy the Assistant Jolitical Agent, the onus was placed on the Indian Assistant with most unfortunate results. I am desired to say that it is considered essential that the Assistant Political Agent should handle a certain number of cases under the Indian Codes each month, and bir Geoffrey would he glad if you would arrange that appropriate ones are transferred from your file or that of the Indian Assistant to his. It would not dislocate work unduly in the Agency if the Assistant Political Agent heard such cases on at least four days per mensem and I would request that this may he done in future and the records of the cases produced for the Political Resident's inspection at his next visit. 2. Since it appears that these instructions have 'been lost sight of in the past I am to request that a copy of this letter shoulA he placed upon your handing over file.

Weightman, i!lSQ .uire, I • C. S ., Political Agent, lahrain. I was very disturbed to find on my last visit to Bahrain^that Hallows is doing no judicial work whatever. It is essential that he should take a number of civil cases, so that he will not forget his Civil Law altogether. Now that a Naval Reporting Officer has 'been posted to Bahrain, I imagine that the work must have 'been lightened in the Agency office, and I would 'be glad if you would arrange for Hallows to take some selected civil suits, and also a few interesting criminal cases, so that I can see specimens of his Judicial work at my next visit. 2. I am disappointed in the progress he has made in his Arabic, and presume,it is due to lack of leisure since good teachers are available in Bahrain. If he has some cases given him in which Arabs are involved, he wil] 'be killing two 'birds with one stone and improve his ixraMc while brushing up his knowledge of the Law. NS.CONFIDENTIAL D. O .NO.

Hickinbotham, O .B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir. I have the honour to refer to your letter No, 28^2-19/174-111 dated the 24th December 1944 and to state for the information of the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that the Assistant Political Agent is already spending at least one day a week in trying cases in the Joint Court the majority of which are of a civil nature. The work in the Joint Court gives him considerable opportunity to improve his knowledge of Arabic and refresh his legal memory. Thus the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, is, and has been since I arrived here in October 1943, carrying out the provisions of the Political Resident's demi-official letter of the 6th of January 1940. I have always made a point of utilising the services of the Assistant Political Agent to try difficult cases for which I considered the Indian Assistant not sufficiently experienced, and to try cases in which Kruopeans appeared as parties or as accused persons. 2. I shall find it extremely difficult to permit the Assistant Political Agent to devote more time to the hearing of cases nor have I the time or His Highness the inclination to hear cases now being heard by the Junior Joint Court in order to make the Assistant Political Agent available to under take more Agency Court work. I therefore suggest that the present procedure be allowed to continue. The records of the cases tried by the Assistant Political Agent will be produced as requested by you for the Political Resident's inspection on his next visit. I attach a list of cases tried Dy the Assistant Political Agent in 1944. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Sd. T. Hickinbotham, i— Political Agent, Bahrain.S.O.No.C /SO.

'v' Please refer to your telegram No.48 dated the 7th January. 2. I am expecting Bird to arrive here complete with wife and two children on the 24th and as it seems more than probable that we shall see nothing of Murphy until the beginning of March at the very earliest some considerable period of time must elapse before Bird can be relieved of his appointment as Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and take over from Tandy as Assistant Political Agent. This will mean that until Murphy does arrive Bird is in fact Political Officer, Trucial / Coast, and apparently being of the genus cuculus canorous has ♦ taken possession of Tandy's house who in his turn has been forced to take refuge in*the Agency. It would from my point of view be more satisfactory if Tandy performed the function of Political Officer Trucial Coast while Bird settled down . to the task of Assistant Political Agent.

I regret that I cannot agree with you that case No.46 of 1944 against C.C. Bhatia should 'obviously have been conducted by the Assistant Political Agent' . The case was one under Section 411 of the Indian Penal Code with an additional charge under one of the War Regulations issued by this Agency with regard, to hoarding. Many hundreds of Indian magistrates 'working in India are trying similar cases against their own countrymen and possibly their own acquaintances every day of the year. If the Indian Assistant Bahrain is not to try cases against Indians of the inferior social standing of persons of Bhatia's position his status will be lowered in the eyes of the general public. In the particular case you mention I sent for Dr.Siddiq some days before the case commenced in his court and asked him whether he had any personal objection to taking the case expressing my willingness to transfer the case to the courc of the Assistant Political Agent should his possible acquaintance with Bhatia make it embarrassing for him to conduct the proceed ings, Dr. Siddiq assured me that he had no personal friendship with the individual concerned and that he looked on the case as being one which it v/as his duty to try. When the proceedings were over and an appeal was lodged I felt it my duty on examining « the file to draw Dr. Siddiq^ attention to what I considered were legal imperfections in his conduct of the trial. No one likes to be taken to task however deserved it may be and I under stand that Rogers when acting for me later also found it /necessary R.G. Daubeny, Esq., O.B.E., Secretary to the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.s* 2. necessary to talk to him again about certain legal inaccu- % racies in the proceedings in his court* These strictures combined with the atmospheric conditions and Dr.Siddiq's wellknown highly nervous temperament may have been in part responsible for his unfortunate condition immediately prior to his proceeding on leave# However, if magistrates do fail to follow the provisions of law then they must be corrected even though a nervous breakdown is induced. Rogers is at present in Bushire and is well qualified to provide you with such additional information on this subject as you may require.

A My dear Colonel, As you are aware, the post of Assistant Political Agent here is a temporary one and is sanctioned for a year only each year. This has been going on since the post was S sanctioned eleven years ago# The position is unsatisfactory because (a) there is no question whatsoever but that a per manent post of Assistant Political Agent here is required, (b) the fact that the post is temporary makes it Impossible to make any permanent arrangements for the Assistant Political Agent, e.g., for •his 1 house which is one hired from the State and at the moment he is undergoing the greatest inconvenience because the State refuses to dig a well and he receives, in this weather, only the sparsest ration of water. If the house were a Government one, some permanent arrangement for supplying it with water would, one must hope, be made. 2. I am aware that a proposal to the Oove! , nment of / f India to make the post permanent, may, for all I know, be more appropriately made, not in isolation,, but in conjunction with other proposals regarding staff for the Gulf as a whole, or it may raise a question of general policy of which I am unaware. . I would enquire, therefore, whether you are willing to consider a proposal put up officially by me to make the post permanent. Yours sincerely, ,0 The Hon'ble Lleut-Col. A.C.

L&gt;ir T. Powle reverted several times to the question of permanency stressing that it was impossible for the political .xgent to carry out his duties v/ithout an assistant. In paragraph 1 of their letter ITo. F-545-1T/33, dated the iGth January, 1936 to the India Office the Government of India stated, however, that it was intended to keep the , ost temporary until such time as the question of the division of expenditure on the Political Agencies, Bahrain and lluscat, between His L'ajesty's Government and the Government of India, raised in the letter, was decided. Jhis latter question is still pending, and the appointment of assistant political iigen t, Bahrain, therefore continues to be temporary, sanction being accorded for its continuance for a year at a time. - 4. work in Bahrain has steadily increased since the temporary ^ost was first sanctioned over ten years ago. The expansion of the oil field and the development of the air route, to mention om^. two of many items, has proceeded apace, resulting in a large growth in the European and ^merican population, with the additional work and problems resulting therefrom, and ^uite apart from the great increase of work due to the war, it is inconceiveable that the Political x^gent can future without an assistant. In fact, if the post increases it. v/ill probably be necessary to appointment of a second assistant. I request therefore that the appointment of .vssist^nt Political Agent, Bahrain, may be made permanemt forthwith irrespective of a decision on the question of the division of expenditure on the Pol'itical agencies, Bahrain and Ku-scat, between His majesty's Government and the Government of India. carry on in v/ork -of the ask for the Sd/- Geoffrey Prior political .tesident, Persian Gulf. .t te sted bd/- J.
