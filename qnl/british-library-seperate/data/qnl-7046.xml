Most of the claims were made between 1942 and 1948. The claims are the result of loss of either lives or property of Iranians living in India or British-Indian subjects living or working in Iran. However, the majority of the papers relate to a particular episode of violence against the Iranian community in Bombay during 1946, and include two letters from the Iranian Consul General in India and the Iranian Ambassador to the UK.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Political violence</topic></subject><subject><topic>International politics</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Compensation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0001dc#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0001dc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
