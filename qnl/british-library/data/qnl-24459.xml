To The Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum. Reference your telegram Ho.180 dated the 4th May 1937. 2. According to a reliable information from Kalba, Shaikh Sa’id bin Hamad fell sick on Thrsday night the 29/30 April 1937 and suddenly got a boil on his neck which caused his death the next morning i.e. on 30th April. On seeing the condition of her father and that he was at the edge of death, 'Aishah, the elder daughter of Shaikh Sa f id bin Hamad, who was then with her father at Khaur Fakkan, left Khaur Fakkan with two slave women and proceeded by land a,, to ^alba. As soon as she reached Kalba she collected all the slaves and guards and posted them at the different towers and kept Barut(^/ as an Amir. As soon as the news reached her about the death of her father, after consultation with her family members and some of the notables, five persons were sent to call Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, the ex-Shaikh of Sharjah who was then at Has al Khaimah with his brother ’Abdullah. Shaikh Khalid is also the husband of ’Aishah bint Shaikh Sa’id bin Hamad. Shaikh Khalid sent his brother with ten of their followers to Kalba and asked him to go and see first if the people wanted them or not and then send him news to Ajman where he is residing. After 'Abdullah left^Shaikh Sultan bin ^alim heard about the death news and immediately sent his clerk and another person with him to Kalba, but as soon as they reached a village called Hail they were stopped from proceeding further. Shaikh Rashid bin Ahmad of Diba and elder brother of /of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad,on getting the news left Diba for Kalba, but as soon as he reached Khaur Fakkan he was asked by Salim bin 'Abdullah, the chief of the Haqbiyin if he was going to offer his condoloences and if so he had only one day to stay at Khaur Fakkan, but that if he KaaiKx went there for the Shaikhdom, he should return at once* Shaikh Rashid then excused himself by saying that his visit was for offering his condolence and nothing else and that he was returning to Diba, which he did* 3* I got the news about the death of the Shaikh of Kalba on the night of 3rd May 1937, but I did not inform the Shaikh of Sharjah lest he might create trouble before the information about the death reached you. He,however, heard through a sailing boat which came from Aas al Khaimah and inmediately sent a mpecial to the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah asking about the correctness of the information* The Shaikh of n as al Khaimah appears to have purposely kept the news from the Shaikh of Sharjah in order to get a first chance for the Shaikhdom of Kalba, the wife of the Shaikh of Kalba, Sa'id bin Hamad / being his sister* 4. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim arrived this evening from Has al Khaimah and I am sure that the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah will do their best to create trouble for any person who may try to become the Shaikh of Kalhh and their gathering at this time is no doubt after some purpose relating to Kalba* 5.

'V Memorandum Refersnee your telegram No.184 dated the 9th May 1937. 2 According to two letters received by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah (a; from Hamad bin Sa*id and (b; from Salim bin Abdullah and the rest of the people of Kalba, Khaur Fakkan, Za’ab and others, dated the 23rd Safar 1356Ci.e. 5.5.1937; respectively and also reports, the people of Kalba of their own will have elected Shaikh Hamad bin Sa'id as successor to his father. SfiKk The Policy adopted by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, who writes to them that he only wants to help the boy so that no outsider can encroach oil! the property of the late Shaikh Sa'id bin Hamad, might change things in future, namely, he might be able to convince the Naqbiyin that it would be in their interests to act as Amirs on^behalf and look after Khaur Fakkan and Kalba y and thus deceive them to admit his sovereignty over that country. He has been very polite in his letters to them and also lenient. Although the Naqbiyin wrote to Shaikh Sultan to exfetod his help to them against outsiders, the last letter dated the 24th Safar 1356U.e. 6.5.37; received by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, from Salim bin ’Abdullah,of which I enclose a true copy # shows clearly that they do not want any of the Qawasim Shaikhs bedides Hamad whom they support. The letter is ended by a warning to Shaikh Sultan bin Salim that he should prevent the rest of the Qawasim from encroaching against Ka^lt and at the same time says thathe should not also send any people on his behalf until matters are quiet. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim is trying his best to annext Kalba with has al Khaimah and is doing his utmost to convince the people of Kalba that it would be in their interests that he should be their protector. He says that because the Naqbiyin need his help and as the boy Hamad is a minor and has no one to look after his interests or the interests of his family, it is necessary that he should do so. The Shaikh of Sharjah says in his letter about the message conveyed to him that he should not interfere in the question of successor which should be left to Kalba people to decide^that Kalba is part of hid dominion and as the people want help owing to the pressure of the son of Ahmad, Khalid and * Abdullah, it is his duty to answer their call. In fact the Shaikh of Sharjah did not get a letter that they want him to go and help them but is relying on the letters which the Shaikh of has al Khaimah had received. The letter to the Shaikh of Sharjah says that Shaikh i=*a ! id died and that theyCpeople of Kalba; exepct his help. This is a matter of courtesy which they always say even to outsiders. I expect to get a report from halba any moment and v/ill report to you Jrhatever may happen. 4 • Shaikh Abdullah bin Ahmad v/ithdrew from Kalba and is now at Dhaid about 40 miles from Sharjah.with ~ ' e r Khajid.

Khalid also sent his brother ’Abdullah to Muhammad bin ’Ali in order to ask his help and it is said that Muhammad bin 'Ali was expected to come today to J-haid to meet Khalid. The attitude of Khalid and the tribes men is to cut the lines of commincations of the tribes of Kalba with the rest of the Trucial toast and thus bring pressure to bear on them to ask for Khalid to become Shaikh of Kalba. Khalid is reported to have sent a letter five days ago to the Shaikh of the Naqbiyin 1 asking about his attitude towards him and he replied that he could not give an answer before three dayswhen^he said ^he will be in position to give his definite reply after consulting his tribesmen* It is reported that Shaikh Khalid intends to leave for Kalba with his force in a day or two* Shaikh of Naqbiyin is in favour of Hamd bin Sa ! id but some of his people are reported to have said that under the present conditions it would be difficult for them to be governed by a child who himself needs to be looked after* In his letter to the Shaikh of the haqbiyin Shaikh Khalid assured the Naqbiyin that he would exetend the same help and give them the same treatment which they used to receive on the hand of the late Shaikh Sa ! id bin Hamad* 3* The Shaikh of Sharjah sent a letter last night which was despatched secretly from VAjman through the Shaikh. 5.

While at Um-al-Qaiwain this morning I received information that Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah had left for Kalba. I confirmed this later from Muhammad bin Sultan Shaikh of Naim who had just reached Sharjah from Dhaid. His information is reliable and he said Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah went to Dhaid to meet Khalid bin Ahmad who refused to see him as he said he was deceitful. Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah then left with twelve followers for Kalba. He has had no letter of invitation from Kalba and is ostensibly going to enquire who the people wish for a ruler. The Shaikh of the Bani Kitab Muhammad bin ’Ali and Khalid have sent the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah a declaration of open hostility. This occurred three days ago. • -POLITICAL-TELEGRAM From To No. T/58.

Before however I give him a direct order to evacuate Kalba I should have to be in a position to apply force should he not obey. This force could most conveniently take form of seizing his pearling dhows but I am reluctant to suggest this to His Majesty’s Government too often. But if he does something outrageous such as adding Kalba to his territory then I will take above course. 3. Another consideration is that if at the present juncture we either threaten or use force against him we may render much more difficult obtaining of oil concession from him. 4. All things considered therefore I propose to take no action for the moment. 3 5. Paragraph 3 of your telegram No.T/59 June 14th.

After arrival of Shaikh of Has al Khaimah at Kalba Bedouins who are allies of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad cut of* communication and prevented Kalba subjects from visiting other states. As soon as he reached Kalba Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah wrote a representation on which he obtained signature from Persian Residents and a few other people from Kalba to the effect that they wished Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah to take charge of state until boy Ahmad attained the age. These signatures included that of MQBIYIN, who is now reported to have gone to Khor Fakan but expecafced to return after 5 days. Shaikh of Khaur Kalba and ABU BASRA and BARUT who refused to sign are said to have gone to Muscat 10 days ago to protest against Shaikh’s action. Shaikh of -^as al Khaimah sent uncle of boy with one of his followers 3 days ago to get them back. The boy and his slaves remained at Kalba.

During his time in Bahrain Shaikh should be comfortably lodged and fed in a separate house with his personal attendant but allowed to receive no visitors and he should be informed of this. My staff’s house might be suitable. In case arrangements are not complete by the time b haikh arrives perhaps Senior Naval Officer would be good enough to keep him on board for short time. In order to ensure he does receive no visitors 2 Agency farashes should be detailed for this purpose though ostensibly looking after his personal comforts. Farashes should be instructed that should any visitors wish to see him before admitting them they should inform you. 4. Please write to the Ruler of Bahrain to the following effect on my behalf. That as he is aware that Shaikh of Kalba died recently and on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, whose custom it is not to interfere in internal affairs of Dhaikh, I adopted policy of allowing people of Kalba to choose their own Shaikh which is also according to immemorial custom of Arabs. Having heard certain shaikhs among them 3 ^£&amp;#$£- Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah werewere inclined to interfere in Kalba affairs I instructed Shaikh of Has al Khaimah through Political Agent to refrain from interference. Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah however disregarded these instructions and proceeded to Kalha with some followers to force people of Kalba to elect him as gardian of boy Ahmad, (late Shaikh 1 s son) that is to say practically to make himself Shaikh. This was an improper, rash and inadvisable act and people of Kalba quite rightly refused to accept him. Shaikh of Ras al Khairaah being then \jjb jld- in difficult^-ef* appealing to me for a sloop be sent to his aid. In spite of his ill advised conduct I agreed to assist him and through kindness of Senior Naval Officer a sloop was sent to Kalba and is bringing him to Bahrain to give a personal explanation of his conduct to Political Agent. In spite of my assisting the Shaikh^ he is however still under my displeasure and I do not wish him to receive any visitors. End of letter. 5. It is equally essential that Trucial Shaikhs as well as Bahrain should know exactly how situation stand. Unless you see any objection therefore please telegraph Residency Agent to issue a circular letter to Trucial Shaikhs from you or my behalf in the same sense , mutatis mutandis, as in paragraph 4 above. 6 . In your and Residency Agent ! s communications there need be no mention of facts we are going to release him after his explanations though naturally we will have to do this in due course. We need not however be in a particular hurry to do this and I suggest for instance that you delay giving him an interview (which can of course take place at ^Agency) by a couple of days. 7 .

Salim bin * Abdullah, chief of the haqbiying has been living in his village LULAIYAH near Khaur Fakkan end did not go to Kalba since the removal of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, being afraid lest he may be killed by the people of Kalba or Barut. He sent word to Barut that as he went and complained to the British Government without consulting him and has given acces and chance to the British Government over Kalba, he did not think that he was bound by any arrangement made by Barut. He also sent word that the slaves of Shaikh Sa’id should not visit Khaur Fakkan. Barut, however, wrote him letters to the ef ect that in the interest of the state they should all combine and that he Salim still retained the same position/had ht the time of the late Shaikh Sa*id. On the evening of 30th June the messenger of Barut was given replies for Barut but before leaving ? a si^ecial messenger by name Khalfan al Ghafeli who is one of Shaikh Sultan*s own men, arrived with special message to Salim, as a result of which Salim took away the replies and told the messenger of Barut to go away.

I quoted the case of the imm as an instance of this for I understand that a slave successfully controlled this tribe during the minority of Sagar bin Sultan and Muhammad bin Sultan the two Naim brothers who now exercise control over the trioe. Ihese two gentle.itn rewarded the slave for his care of the tribe during their minority by murdering him as soon as they were old enougn to do so. Thus although it would be a precedent for his Majesty’s Government to enter into relations wit., a man who was a slave, it is not precedent for a slave or an ex-slave to supervise a trioe. 3.

Mien he saw resistence and disobedience fr from them he asked the Honourable the Political He si dent to send a warship to him. A warship was sent to him and she brought him to Bahrain. I do not know Shaikh Sultan bin Salim‘s plea in this case. You mentioned to me that it is the policy of the High British Government not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Shaikhs.

Sir Rrenehard has asked me to follow this up with the following comments. 3. Without being mobbish and while Sir Trenchard has nothing against Rarut personally, he does feel that a slave as a regent, i.e. virtually Shaikh, would have certain objections. To take an analogy from India a slave occupies the same position on the Arab Coast as a menial would in an Indian state. Calls and recalls on the Resident, the Senior Naval Officer and the Poli tical Agent, when these officials visit Nalba, would be made by and returned on Barut in company with Hamad and this seems hardly correct. Further, all official correspondence would be with Barut and we have no pre cedents in this part of the world of His Majesty's Government having official dealings with a slave and he imagines that our recognition of a slave would appear somewhat oueer in the eyes of the Wrucial Shaikhs, 'further, though Barut has influence at present, he thinks the fact of his being a slave will gradually weaken his position as the boy Hamad grows older, but before he is actually old enough to become Shaikh. These are Sir Trenchard f s views, but naturally in any communication to the Fa lba peonle no mention would be made of the fact t. ^ickinbotham., I .A ., °lHical Agent, Bahrain, 8 ^ Harac h 1.mmm ■ 2 - that there is ary ohjectior to Barrt because of his status as a Slave. What we car say, ard what we have said before, is that he is rot a rotable - vide telegram No. 641, dated the 28th Jure, 1937. V 4. Sir Trerchard thirks the best way out of the diffi culty wot? Id be for a Courcil of Begercy to be formed composed of a few rotables represertirg the various parties ir Fslba, ir which Barut would rot figure. Barut ther would remair ir the backgrourd ard wield as much power as he liked from behird the scores. Ir his telegram No. 641 of the 28th Jure, 1937, Sir Trerchard suggested that a ^ Begert who was to be a local rotable, might be selected.

Residency Agent Sharjah reported August 28th that^ X according to rumour Khalid is at Fujarah with fifty men awaiting Naqbiyin deputation. It appears he hopes cO solve the Kalba problem by coming to an agreement with Barut whereby he obtains control as guardian while Barut retains the position he held under Shaikh Said. This is my interpretation of a mutilated telegram. 2. Residency Agent mentions rumours of a force of 200 commanded by the brother of Abdullah in Wadi A1 Qaur. I am enquiring who is referred to. 3. Unless Residency Agent is permitted to influence the situation by persuading the pe&amp;ple to accept Khalid while safeguarding the rights of the boy Hamad and the safety of Barut I do not feel that he can do any good at Kalba. 4.

T/P45 dated the 29th September 1937 and to enclose a copy of a note made by Khan Sahib Saiyid Abtfur Hezzaq on the 12th of March 1936 of a meetir^ which took place between the Honourable the Political liesident Sir Trenchard Fowls, K.C.I.E., and Shaikli Sultan bin Saqr, Shaikh of Sharjah, on beard H*M*S* Fowey on the 12th of March 1936. 2. The Shaikh of Sharjah had been requested by us to arrange for air facilities at Kalba and various letters had been addressed to him. It appears that he was unable to persuade the Shaikh of Kalba to listen to what should have been his orders, but was in practice his advice. The endeavour to approach Kalba through Sharjah was not continued after the interview between Sir Trenchard Fowle and. the Shaikh of Sharjah on the 12th of March 1936. It appears that from then onwards it was decided to deal with the Shaikh of Kalba either directly or through Ahmad bin Hasan of Rams. Ahmad bin Hasan was despatched to Kalba to use his influence to persuade the Shaikh to negotiate with the Political authorities. These negotiations of Ahmad bin Hasan were successful and as a result of a favourable/-- 2 - favourable reply from the Shaikh of Kalba I myself when acting as Political Agent in 1936 went to K.alba and opened direct negotiations• 3# Inuring the course of the negotiations His Majes ty^ Government appeared doubtful regarding the possible infringement of paragraph 2 of Lieutenant-Colonel Dick- sorts letter of July 22nd, 1932, to the Shaikh of Sharjah, and His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for India addressed a telegram Ho* 1853 to the Honourable the Political Resi dent. who was then at Kuwait, on the 19th of .Tune 1936* In his telegram No* T/66 of the 22nd Jtine Sir Trenchard Fowls replied to the Secretary of State for India and I invite your attention to paragraph 2 of this telegram* Sir Trenchard Fowle gave his views on the situation quite clearly when he said that he considered as a general prin ciple that the Shaikh who had ceased to exercise control or accept responsibility for an area under the de facto rule of another Shaikh forfeited any claims that he may once have had to the area in question* 4* With regard to the Shaikh of Sharjah’s probable reaction to the approval of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed as Regent of Kalba by His Majesty’s Government* The Shaikh of Sharjah* s reaction to the acceptance of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed as Regent of Kalba by His Majesty’s Government will be influenced firstly by financial considerations and secondly by family considerations. uith regard to the financial considerations which with the Shaikh of Sharjah rank first. I invite your attention to the Agreement which was concluded on the 24th of June 1927 between Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Chief of Sharjah, his brother Shaikh Muhammad bin 3aqr, and the notables/-&lt;%} •• 3- aotables of the town of oh©p f jah, and Shaikh Khalid bin AJ'unod, his brother Abdullah bin Aluned, Abciur Rahman bin Saif 9 Chief of Hemriyeh, and Hamad bin Ibrahim, Chief of Viwa al Qaiwain, and endorsed by the Residency Agent, Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif. You will see from paragraph 4 that Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr and his subjects are bound to pay at the beginning of each diving season an allowance of Hs* 15CC/~ to Shaikh Khalid. I have no doubt that the Shaikh of Sharjah will make every endeavour to come to some arrangement with shaikh Khalid with regard uo the dis continuation of the payment of this Siam of money and I feel that the Shaikh of Sharjah 1 s reaction to the appoint ment of Shaikh Khali &amp; as Regent will be very much influenced by Khalid 1 e personal attitude with regard to this annual subsidy. Personally I think that Shaikh Khalid will be prepared to forego the annual allowance if the Shaikh of Sharjah agrees to make no protest against the appointment of Shaikh Khalid as Regent* With regard to the second consideration! i.e* that of family. If the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah had succeeded in his endeavour to have himself appointed as Regent of Kalba the Shaikh of Sharjah would have been considerably alarmed and would have protested strongly. At the same time the Haim Shaikh Rashid of Ajman and the Shaikh of Umm al Qatwain would have viewed this extension of autho rity and territory by the Shaikh of .Ras al Kiiaimah with great concern and would, have intrigued as would Sharjah with the Beni Kitab and. other tribes to make the Shaikh of Has al Khaircah's position in Kalba intolerable. If the Shaikh of Sharjah had made any endeavour to consoli date his old territory and rejoin Kalba to Sharjah, then the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah would have been in opposition as/-as he himself has claims to Kalba. The only individual who was in any way suitable for the appointment and likely to be acceptable to both the Shaikhs was Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed who was in the unenviable position of being an ex-monarch without money* He is a Jawassim himself and therefore acceptable on tribal grounds: he is of good family and is intimately connected with both the Jawassim Shaikhs, i*e, of Sharjah and Has al Khai- mah. He was not on friendly terms v»lth the Shaikh of Has al hhairaah, nor was he on friendly terms with the Shaikh of Sharjah, and both the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah and the Shailch of Sharjah, if they cannot have Kalba for themselves, would prefer to see Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed as Hegent than any one else, as they know he is unlikely to ally himself with either of them* 5* The Shaikh of Sharjah is quite well aware that Kalba has passed outside his control and he has no wish at heart to regain control* He knows that he will have considerable trouble to contend with when and if he is called upon by us to fulfil the conditions of the Oil Ag- x'eement with Petroleum Concessions Limited which he has just concluded* He is not anxious to commit himself any further than is absolutely necessary and prefers to keep his money and. live quietly on the Coast to endeavouring to prevent the continual disintegration of his once large Sheikhdom. He may possibly make a formal protest but I think even this unlikely as I do not recollect any protest being made when ve originally in 1936 granted independence to Kalba by the first Treaty with Shaikh Said bin Hamad, the details of which must have been known to the Shaikh of Sharjah* X have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, I Captain Political Agent, Bahrain.H0.334-B/17. ■■BHHHHBBBHBraBHHK 2?7 Political Agencyf 1 Balirain, the 6th October 3037. f JPhe Residency Agent 9 Sharjah.
