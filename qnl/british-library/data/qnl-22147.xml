Sir H. Hay and Harrison discussed this question with Morray and Hitchcock of the British Council on July 18th- The India Office view is that this should properly be a British Council appointment, but the British Council feel that there is very little chance of their securing sanction for the upgrading of the post which Miould be necessary if they are to obtain a suitable man to fill it. In the circumstances, we thought that for the time being, i.e. for the next year or so, the best thing would be for the British Council to use the small amount of funds they have already ear marked for the Persian Gulf to finance periodic visits by one of their Representatives in the Middle East to the Gulf. The British Council said that they could probably arrange for Highwood to pay a visit from Cairo about next February to Bahrain and Kuwait. 3. i If you agree, I think we might proceed on these lines. The position can be reviewed again later in the light of any further developments. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Morray. Yours sincerely. 3d. E.P. DONALDSON. W.H.

J Dear kontagu-Po llock, Will you please refer to your ill 3591/1824/91 of 15th Fay. Considerable discussions have taken place with a view to making the post in Bahrain more attractive and thus extending the chances of getting a more suitable candidate, and finally we awaited the return from Bahrain of Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, I was able to discuss the question with him at some length last week, and it was decided that, in view of the financial restrictions now being imposed upon the Council and the difficulty of obtaining money from local or any other sources, the idea • of a full-time Director of Education should be dropped. Instead we are arranging that kr. R.V7, Highwood, Director of the British Institute in Cairo, vfoo is a competent Arabist with a wide knowledge of educational matters, should pay a visit of at least a month to Bahrain and the Gulf in November, and a further visit in about February. The question of a Public Relations Officer is one which I believe Colonel Hay will be taking up with the appropriate authori ties. I very much regret that this is as far as we are • able to go at the moment, but I had great hop^s that funds would be forthcoming from other sources than the British Council, but this appears at the present time to be an impo ssibility.

While I was in the United Kingdom I discussed with the British Council the question of the appointment of an Educational Adviser to this Residency. As the Bahrain Government have refused to assist financially and the British Council have only a very limited sum available for the Persian Gulf in their budget it was decided in principle that such money as is available should be devoted to the cost of a short visit by a senior member of the British Council's staff with the idea that if the Governments concerned agree he should discuss existing educational services with the local authorities concerned, have a look at their schools and make suggestions for their improvement and for the future development of education generally. 3. In pursuance of the above it is probable that Highwood, who for several years has dealt with educational matters at Cairo on behalf of the British Council, will visit Bahrain and if possible Kuwait in November. I should be grateful if you would kindly confirm that the Bahrain Govern ment will welcome such a visit and will co-operate with Highwood so far as is possible. They will not be called upon to bear any expense in connexion with the visit. 4. I had a talk with Highwood before I left London and he considers that one of the first essentials is to set up a teachers' training school in the Gulf so as to eliminate gradually the present Egyptian influence in educational matters. I think this X is a project in which the Bahrain Government might well sympathise and I should be interested to learn whether they have already any kind of establishment for the training of local teachers.

The 'appointitiens' which he referred to vas that of Ahmed OBiran as Director of Education. He wrote to Belgrave asking him to keep the confirmation of Ahmed Omran pend ing as the assistance which could be provided (from the British Council) for the Bahrain schools was 'under con sideration'.

Political Agency, Bahrain, October 11, 1949, Dear Gethin, You will have received a copy of British Kiddle East Office note to^ us No,31/3/696 Of Sep tember 27. 2. One obstacle to the greater employment of Palestinians in Bahrain is that they are often not repatriable and the local government will not admit persons they cannot get rid of when they want to. Before approaching the Bahrain Government about in creasing the numbers of its Palestinian teachers we ought to be able to give an assurance that they hold Jordan or other current passports. 3. I myself am entirely in favour of reducing the number of Egyptian teachers. Last year in Bahrain we had an example of one of the worst fruits of Egyptian influence in a political demonstration by schoolboys, I notice that although in the Bahrain Governments annual report the Adviser referred to this as an 'unfortunate incident' the Director of Education condoned it as being 'not surprising' al though 'a dangerous innovation'. 4. Worse in my view than the employment of Egyptian teachers is the use of Egyptian readers by which Egyptian propagandas anti-British sentiments are installed into the impressionable minds of young children. With the development of Qatar and the Trucial Coast and the open ing of schools there this lamentable yet remediable state of affairs will spread throughout the Gulf. Yours sincerely, J.A.F. Gethin, Esq., The Residency, Jufair. H.G. JakinsM inutes.

The Bahrain Gover^ nment have now 10 Palestinian teachers in all, two with their families and 8 without. They have reduced the number of their Egyptian tea chers from 22 to 18. 2* Ahmad Umran tells me that the 62 male and 27 female Egyptian teachers recruited by the Kuwait Government are all being given double basic pay and double dearness allowance and that the Kuwait Government's provision for education in their budget now amounts to 50 lakhs* They have got rid of their Palestinian and Lebanese teachers* During his visit to Egypt he attended some kind of cultural confe rence at which he was asked to talk about Bahrain* He spoke of the co-operation in Bahrain between the British and the local authc rities and was told that it was understood thai a very different state of affairs prevailed in Kuwait* There was no Kuwaiti present* 3. He told me that he has had to turn away about 360 boys from the !v uharraq school this term as there was no room for them* The Bahrain Government apparently have no plans for a new primary school at Muharraq or an extension of the present one though Ahmad Umrai talked vaguely about it being a possibility next year.
