Volume III comprises that portion of south-western Persia, which is bounded on the west by the Turco-Persian frontier: on the north and east by a line drawu through the towns of Khaniqln, Isfahan, Yazd, Kirman, and Bandar Abbas : and on the south by the Persian Gulf.A ABAD (1)— Lat. 29° 2' N. Long, 51° 16' E. Elev. A village in the Tangistan district of Ears, 10 miles north by west of Ahram. It contains 80 houses inhabited by Zanganeh, a Persian tribe from the interior. Pelly says they are called Abadehis. The inhabi tants grow wheat, barley, dates and melons ; they manufacture charcoal and collect firewood.— (Pelly ; Foreign Dept. Gazetteerj 1905.) J ABAD (2)— A tribe of Hindian district (q.v.). ’ABADAT— A division of the ’Anafijeh tribe (q.v.). ABADEH (1)—Lat. 31° 11' N. Long. 52° 41' 30' E. Elev, 6,100'. A walled town in Ears, 140 miles south-east of Isfahan, and 185 mile* from Shiraz, by post-road. It is the 8th caravan, and the 9th post-stage from Shiraz. It is the chief town of a district, with a Deputy Governor (Naib JHakim). Population 6,000. Telegraph house of Indo-European Telegraph Company, with clerk in charge, and telephone communication with Qumisheh and Deh Bid. Morier says the first appearance of Abadeh announces a large place, but on a nearer inspection the town exhibits only a great extent of ruined walls without inhabitants. The present population lives within a square en closure, one side of which is a strong fort, with high brick walls, two tiers of loopholes, and flanked by well-built towers. It is in form a parallelo gram, about 350 yards by 50 yards, with two gates connected by a wide street. Some of the houses are inside this fort, which, with the post-house and another walled inclosure, forms three sides of a square , the fourth being filled by the unwalled village. Some remarkably delicate and artistic Wood-carving, the art of the peasants, emanates from this neighbourhood. It takes the for m of boxes, photo-frames, and sherbet spoons chiefly. Supplies of all kinds procurable, the locality being particularly noted for fruits. Water excellent and plentiful from numerous water-courses. It has a very good climate, and a dry and bracing atmosphere. The winter is severe, but less so than at Deh Bid. _ . t , - j * This village is known as Abadeh-i-Iqlid to distinguish it from Abadeh- i-Tashk.— (Morier ; Ouseley ; Pelly ; Taylor ; Gibbon ; Trotter ; Odling ; Bailward ; Arbuthnot, 1905.) Abadeh (2)—Lat. 29° 49' 45' N. Long. 53° 39' E. Elev. A village in Ears, 54| miles north-east of Darab, on the north shore of Lake Nargis. It consists of a fort and a camp of about 200 tents.

The villagers own large flocks of sheep 112 IB A2 ABA—ABA and goats and numerous cattle and horses. This locality is very healthy, and there is an excellent camping-ground. Near here Lieutenart Stotheid’s party was attacked in 1893. Wells says that a road leads from heie through Qawam ’All (Khwaja Jamall) to Shahr-i-Babak. This village is known as Abadch-i-Tashk and produces wheat, barley, beans and opium in winter sowings ; green almonds, pomegianates and some giapes as summer sowings.— {Felly ; Ross ; Wells ; Stotherd, 1893).

Its length is about 40 miles, and its width varies from about 1| miles at the middle to 12 miles near its southern end. The centre is mostly desert, but the margins of the rivers, as far inland as the creeks extend, are cultivated and planted with dates : much land is now being reclaimed in the Ma’amareh neighbourhood near the south end. A submarine pro longation of the island into the Persian Gulf forms the great reef of Maraqqat ’Abbadan. The inhabitants are almost all Ka’b Arabs, belong ing in the northern part to the Dris, and in the southern part to the Nassar main division of that tribe. A considerable tract in the north eastern corner is known by the name of Maharzi. Its limits are Shakhab* ul-Haiak on the northern, and Huz ’Umar on the eastern shore of the island, and Muhammareh town is opposite the centre of its northern extremity. The shrine of Khidhar stands a little nearer to the north than to the south end of the island, about 2 miles from the Shatt-al-’Arab and 1 mile from the Bahmanshir : it is largely visited by the Shi’ahs of the surrounding districts. Muhammadan theologians are not agreed whether this mysterious personage Khidhar is a prophet or not. Some of them even deny his existence ; but there are, on the other hand, Sufi mystics who affirm that they have seen him. He is believed to have existed in the time of Abraham,, to have been a companion of Moses, and to be still alive in consequence of having drunk of the water of life. Seme Muhammadan commentators identify him with the prophet Elias, others with Saint George of England : one even makes him a general in the army of Alexander the Great. The south coast of the island appears to be fairly firm and well-marked, but there are no fixed villages on it. Total population is reported to be about 24,000. The two southern administrative divisions aie Maniuhi and Qasbat Nassar. In each of the villages bearing these names there is a representative of the Shaikh of MuLammareh. The part of the island north of Maniuhi A 24 ABB-ABB was formerly under the chief Shaikh of the Dris Ka’b, but it is now in charge of the Shaikh of the Ahl-ul-’Arlaz Muhaisin. The island is itself included in the Muhammareh district of Southern ’Arabistan. During the Persian campaign of 1856 the Persians erected five batteries on the north side of the island, some of which were intended to prevent the British passing up the Shatt-al-’Arab, or Bahmanshir to Muhammareh.— (Ross ; Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

Ab-ibashtabAd— A river which rises on the Kuh-i-Chal-i-Shutur (gw.) and flows past Deh- i-Kurd (gw.) into the Chehar Mahal district; leaves that district by the Tang-i-Darkash Yarkash (gw.) and joins the Ab-i-Kaj (see Volume II) ^ west of Du Pulan. It is one of the principal head-waters of the Karun river, and has its name from the village Bashtabad which lies on its banks.— (Schindler.) AB-I-BAZNUI, vide AB-I-DIZ. AB-I-BAZUFT, vide BAZUFT (AB-I-). AB-I-BEHISHTABAD— A considerable stream in Luristan draining the whole of the Chehar Mahal plateau. It has several sources, of which the Ab-i-Junaqan from thenorth-east, the Ab-i-Jehanbln from the north, and the Ab-i-Shalamzar from the south-east are the chief. All three unite before the stream enters the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash at the south-west extremity of the plateau. Passing through this ravine it falls 600 feet in 6 miles and emerges just above the village of Behishtabad. Two miles farther on it runs it into the river Karun after a course of some 75 miles (vide this Gazetteer— Karun River). AB-I-BURS— A nv er rising in the Bakhtiari mountains of Luristan and formed from the junction of the Khairsan and Ab-i-Garm rivers, south of Falard, which joins the Ab-i-Lurdigan and falls into the Karun river below Sar-i-Chah. At its junction it is almost equal in size to the Karun, being a broad, rapid stream, forcing its way through a succession of precipitous ravines, and being only fordable in one or two places with much difficulty during the autumn. It is crossed on the road between Qumisheh and Kaleh-i-Tul in the valley of Burs. Artillery and heavy baggage must be taken across on rafts (vide also this Gazetteer—Karun River).— (Layard.) iB-I-BURtJlRD, vide (AB-I-DIZ). AB-I-CHANAREH or AB-I-KARlND— A river of north-west Luristan. It rises near Karind, flows south-east through the Karind plain past Harunabad, and down a wide, fertile valley into the Harassan plain. In a course due south from Harassan, it forces its way through the lofty ridges of tfle Vardalan Kub, by an enormous rift, some miles long, called the Tang-i-Salim, emerges into the Charduvar valley, and from there turns south-east. In Charduvar, it receives tributaries from Zangawar and from the head of tire valley, and lower down joins the Saimarreh river. At the Tang-i-Salim, its point of passage through the Vardalan range, the bed is about 50 yards broad. When crossed in August, there was a good flow of water.— (Rawlinson; Maunsell, 1888.) AB-I-DALLlEH, vide DALLlEH (AB-I-). AB-I-DARREH-I-TAKHT— A stream which rises on the Kuh-i-Shuturan and, passing the village Dar- reh-i-Takht, flows into the Kamandab river, 53 miles south-east of Burujird. AB-I-DIZ or AB-I-DlZ (River)— A river of Luristan and ’Arabistan, rising in the mountains of Kuh-i- Garru, north-west of Burujird town. As to what is really the parent stream, there is some confusion, but Major lawyer’s explorations in 1890 proved' that there are two main streams, one flowing from near Burujird and draining Silakhur, the other draining upper Faridan and passing Baznui. Hence he calls them the Ab-i-Burujird and the Ab-i-BaznuI. The former appears to be regarded by the best authorities as the main stream, while the latter has become one of the main affluents of the Ab-i-Diz under the name of the Gand-Ab. Flowing south-east for some 16 miles from its source in the mountains, the Ab-i-Diz turns south-south-east through the fertile Silakhur valley8 ABI—ABI v which it irrigates, and passes at 20 miles the thriving town of Burujird, some 3 miles from its left bank. Blowing onwards in the same direction past many villages, the Ab-i-Diz receives the tribute of several small streams from either bank. At about 48 miles Chalan Chulan (Alan-Chulan) is reached. Here Colonel Bell in 1884 struck the Ab-i-Diz. He says the place is 16^ miles (presumably by road) from Burujird. The valley, he says, is from 5 to 10 miles broad, flat and swampy in places, the soil being clay and growing fine wheat and barley. The same authority gives inteT alia the following report :— “ A good mule road traverses the well-cultivated valley of the Ab-h Biz ; soil clay ; wheat growing 2 inches high ; 22nd April, barometer 24* 8' (5,350 feet). “ The general run of the valley here is 140° and 340°. Nearing the river the valley becomes very swampy, and for 1 mile horses and mules found the greatest difficulty in traversing it, sinking over their fetlocks into the sticky clay at each step. “ There is a ford over the river Diz, 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet deep ; current swift, 250 feet to 300 feet wide. There are here the remains of a masonry bridge, of which four arches only are now (1884) standing. Beyond the bridge the river valley is swampy ; barometer 25‘0' (4,870 feet). The river is generally fordable except after rain. “ The valley is bordered on either hand by hills, those to the east being less in height by 200 feet to 300 feet ; those to west are still snow-topped.” At 53 miles the Ab-i-Diz receives the water of a somewhat larger stream from the north-east, called by Strauss the “ Sira”. _ At 70 miles Bahrain is reached, and here a large tributary, the Kamand Ab, joins the Ab-i-Diz from the east. Thus reinforced the river turns south-south-west and enters the mountain range of Takht-i-Kalan Huh at the Tang-i-Bahrain, whence, says Colonel Bell, a Bakhtiari road vi&amp; Lanjaur leads by seven stages to Shushtar. From the Tang-i-Bahrain, the river forces its way through a succession of chasms and gorges, and the track along its bank is utterly im-_ practicable : indeed, this part of the range is so very precipitous that there is only one single pathway conducting across it from Dizful to Burujird ; it is followed by Iliats on foot : it is not to be traversed by a horseman, and is considered the most difficult of all the mountain pathways. It breaks into the Sahneh-i-Lur between the hill forts of Tanga van and Kaleh-i-Shahi. During its passage through the mountains the Ab-i-Diz receives many small streams from either side. It finally emerges from the mountains after a total course of some 120 miles at a point 47 miles north-north-east of Dizful in a straight line, where its volume is increased by the Ab-i-Zaz flowing into it from the east. Near the point where the Ab-i-Diz leaves the mountains, is the celebrated Diz-i-Shahi. From here its course is indefinite, but it probably forms an arch westward round the spurs of the Kuh-i-Malu and the Chal-i-Nark, and skirting the Dirakwand country. At approximately 140. miles it unites with the Gand-Ab—the Ab-i-Baznui of Major Sawyer—some 15 miles south-west of Pul-i-Kul, and 32 miles north-east of Dizful town. The Gand-Ab, the other parent branch of the Ab-i-Diz and by which name it is also called, is formed by two streams, rising one on either sideof Raleh-i-Surkh, a spur of the mountains on the west of Farldan, which unite after some 15 miles, and flow south-west apparently under the name of the Gokun river. After 20 miles the river, which throughout its length flows through very mountainous country, turns north-west to Baznui which is fcached at 60 miles* The Chal-i-Siah forces it to ttirti sharp, and it flows south-south-west for some 20 miles, receiving a tributary from the east rather more than half-way down this bend. Turning again north* west round Kuh Rita and then in a more westerly direction, its cotirse re sembles the coils of a Snake as it winds through the mountains towards Pul-i-Kul. At about 99 miles Pul-i-Shlrak is passed, and at 143 Pul-i-Kul is reached. Here the river is generally called the Ab-i-Diz and is about 100 yards broad and very rapid. It rushes through a gorge at the rate of about 10 miles an hour* There is a route from Pul-i-Kul to Dizful of eight stages. The path lies along the edge of the water on slippery slate-stoiie rock, sometimes scarcely broad enough for a man to get a foothold. The llldts say that they lose a considerable number of their animals yearly along this route when going to and from their summer quarters. There are two ruined bridges here about | mile apart. Soon after leaving Pul-i-Kul this branch of the river leaves the mountains, and after another 2 miles in a south-westerly direction, or a total course of some 160 miles, unites with the other parent stream of the Ab-i-Diz. The united stream continues south-west along the foot of the mountains for some 23 miles, when it turns south, with a slight bend to the west round Kaleh Shahid. The Ab-i-Diz now enters ’Arabistan, and after a course of some 180 miles from the birth of the chief parent stream above Burujird, reaches the populous town of Dizful, standing on the left bank of the river. The name Dizful from “ Diz-i-Pnl,” i.e., the “ Fort of the Bridge,” is derived from the splendid bridge, doubtless of Sassanian struc ture, which here spans the stream. Its lower part is of stone, and evidently of greater antiquity than the superstructure which is of brick. It is 430 yards in length and contains 24 arches of varying shape and span, but is in a dilapidated condition. Some of the arches have fallen in, and one arch built of brick by the townspeople, to replace one which collapsed about 1903, is of inferior workmanship. Communication, however, exists over the river by this bridge, which is described more fully in this Gazetteer tinder Dizftll town. At a little distance above the town a number of flour mills are worked by the current of the Diz river. The river here is swift, of no great depth, and is obstructed by rocks. For further details regard ing Dizful, vide this Gazetteer—Dizful town. Below Dizful the bed of the river is broad and shingly, and the stream flows in several arms. The adjacent country is depressed to its level, and small canals leave both banks as it flows for some 12 miles to the sou! h- w r est. At 191 miles the Bala Rud from the north joins the Ab-i-Diz, and soon afterwards the river turns south-south-east. At 198 miles the river becomes more united above Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah, and at 201 miles the ruins of Susa are passed standing some 6 miles west of the right bank. Opposite this point the left bank of the river is heavily irrigated. The direction of the river continues generally to the south-south-east to a point within 112 IB B10 ABI—ABI 8 miles of the bank of the river Karun below Wais ; but the course of this section is extraordinarily serpentine and at Um Kathir or Khaneh-i-Farhan, about 2 miles by land above the important point known as Kut Bandar, it is only about 16 miles from Shushtar. It is said to be so excessively tortuous that frequently in its windings it recoils upon itself within a few yards, and then suddenly diverges for some miles. In one instance a bank, *■ little more than 9 feet in breadth, separates the two reaches of the river, which, after a circuitous course of about 10 miles, returns to the same spot. This fact makes its length difficult to determine even approximately : the distance from Dizful to Band-i-Qir is only about 60 miles in a direct line, but on the basis of a rough survey of the portion between Band-i-Qir and Kut Bandar, we may estimate that the distance by river is between twice and three times as great. The Ab-i-Diz, then leaving Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah, is joined from the north at some 246 miles by the ’Aurub stream. This latter is a permanent stream which has its sources in a spring near Kaleh Qazh and joins the Diz river some miles below Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah. At about 260 miles the Kahunak or Shureh river also flows into the Ab-i-Diz from the left; at 269 miles, where Ilm Kathir is passed, the Sabz Ab adds its quota to the river ; and at Kut Bandar, which is reached after a course of some 275 miles, the Mukhaibat also pours its water-into that of the Ab-i-Diz. At this point a rocky ridge, not more than 100 feet high, is pierced by the river in its course : this ridge is named Umm-ul-’Ayai. As the river approaches the Karun, its banks contain some forest, and 13 miles from Band-i-Qir the Shavur river [vide this Gazetteer) joins it from the north-west. Finally, the Ab-i-Diz empties itself into the river Karun at Band-i-Qir, and loses its identity as a separate river after a total course of some 360 miles. The fall of the river appears to the eye to be more rapid than that of the Shatait or the Gargar. It cuts its way through the alluvial plain bet ween steep banks, rising 10 to 20 feet above flood-level, outside of which there is no marked valley or basin. The true banks are frequently several hundred yards apart at bends, and their re-entrant angles are occupied by low mud deposits covered with scrub jungle. From about 18 miles south of Dizful to within about the same distance of its junction with the Karun, the course of the Diz lies through a belt of brushwood, not usually more than 2 or 3 miles wide and in places less, with frequent breaks through which glimpses are caught of limitless plains. Trees from 30 to 40 feet in height are scattered through this jungle, yet there is no wood fit for anything but fuel; the principal trees and shrubs are the Gharab or Euphrates poplar, the Sarlm, the tamarisk, the blackberry, and the liquorice-bush or Sus. Fuel for the steamers on the Karun, for the towns of Shushtar and Nasiri and to a certain extent for Dizful town, is obtained from this tract. The climate of the Diz country is undoubtedly much more humid than that of ’Arabistan generally, and in spring there is abundant pasturage upon both sides of the river. Fuel and fodder are obtainable, and the Arabs in the neighbourhood own numbers of buffaloes, cattle and sheep. On the left bank above Kut Bandar there is much irrigated cultivation of wheat and barley. The settled villages of the upper Diz will be found in the article on Dizffll district; the last is Khaneh-i-Farhan, already mentioned, belowwhich the country is occupied by nomads of the ’Anafijeh and Al Kathir tribes. In a favourable state of the river there is no obstacle to navigation, ex cept a strong current, between Band-i-Qir and Kut Bandar, which lies 85 miles above it by water. At Kut Bandar the channel is interrupted by a reef of rock ; the reef is pierced, however, by an opening about 20 yards from the left bank, which in a good river carries from 4 | to 6 feet of water, but is somewhat difficult owing to the strong current. A little higher up there is a second reef, but the soundings in the passage through it are better. Above Kut Bandar, in consequence of a steeper incline of the bed, the current is more rapid ; the depth also is less, and the gravelly and, in places, rocky nature of the channel would make it dangerous to force a thin-bottomed vessel should it show signs of grounding. Kut Bandar may therefore be considered the prac tical limit of navigation for vessels of the type of the Shushan, which is a stern wheeler of 100 feet length over all, 23 feet beam, and 3 feet ordinary draught, and which last visited Kut Bandar in March 1905, It is stated, though, that during the spring rises of the river, navigation is possible for a large, light-draught steamer as far as Deh-i-Nau, about 100 miles by river and 20 miles by land from Dizful, but there is no surveyed route on record between these points. On March 1893 the Shushan ascended the Diz as far as Jisir, about 14 miles from Dizful in a direct line. The river, says Commander Plant, is from 100 to 250 yards wide. The current runs at 3 knots below, and 5 knots above, Kut Bandar. The following is Commander Plant’s report on the passage of the Diz from Band-i-Qir up to Jisir :— Derak Island. —Channels intricate, snags at top end of island. Saiyid Ahmad Tape — Channels intricate. Kut Bandar. —Rocks extend across river. G-ood channel on south side. Shingle bed from here up stream; no holding for anchors. Good, landing place for troops, covered by series of mounds. Kut Lawi or Kut Halawi. —Bend in river very sharp and small; current verv strong. High mounds to south-west, running north-west,, afford commanding position on right bank. Tigtaka Island and Kut Gastir. —Numerous snags in river and shallow water at both places. Um-u-Safr. —Shingle bank stretching across river. Channel very narrow, and water extremely powerful. Ab-u-Brais and Jisir. —Rapids extend across the river at these two places, and navigation very difficult and dangerous. At all seasons of the year the Diz is of a darker colour than either the Shatait or the Gargar : it assumes, when in flood, a deep red hue at Dizful, and one verging on chocolate at Band-i-Qir. The proportion of silt carried is about the same as in the river Karun. The river Diz is one of the high roads into the very heart of Persia, and the civilization of the country demands that it should be opened to traffic , the .country it traverses is healthy a,nd fertile ; friendly tribes inhabit it. All considerations point to it and the Karun as a means whereby our political and commercial interests may be increased. 112 IB B2The river Diz may perhaps be identifier) with the Coprates of the ancient geographers.— (Layard ; Selby ; Eawlinson ; Bell, 1884 ; Sawyer ; Curzon, 1889 ; Plant ; Burton, 1897; Persian Gulf Gazetteer, J908.)

At the ford the bottom is covered with boulders, and fording is difficult; water 2 feet 6 inches deep ; the bed is 60 feet deep ; banks steep, conglomerate. The Fani gorge, or Tang-i-Fani, is difficult; there is no passage through it. Lurs were seen passing over the Khiolah range by climbing up the ledges of rock to the west of gorge.

It is said to rise in a high range of mountains in Kuhgalu country, near Kuh Siah. It flows in a south-westerly direction, and takes its name from the ruined settlement upon its right bank a few miles above-its junction with the Ab-i-Shur. It has several tributaries, of which the chief are the Zuhreh and Kumbal. The water of the river is sweet and good—(Foreign Dept. Gazetteer, 1905.) AB-I-SHtTR, or SHtfLISTAN RIVER— A river in Ears, which rises in the mountains of the Mamassanl tribe, i and, joined with the Ab-i-Shirin, forms the Hindian river. The hills among which it rises were formerly, it is stated, inhabited by a tribe called Shul. The water of the Ab-i-Shur is bitter. It has several tributaries, one of which, the Shish Pir, which comes down_ from the m rth of Shiraz, is exceedingly bitter, strongly impregnating the Ab-i-Shur, and even affecting the Hindian river, but not in such a_degree as to make its water undrinkable. Even at the driest seasons, the Ab-i-Shur and the Ab-i-Shirin are both consi8 rable , streams, with a breadth at their junction of 25 yards, and a shih’gly bot tom.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

AB-I-TALKH— A considerable stream in the Ram Hormuz plain, south of Khuzistan. It runs from Chal-i-Ghul westwards. It is crossed by a ford, 4 miles south of Sarileh on the road from Behbehan to Shushtar, where it runs between high banks .—{De Bode.) AB-I-ZAL— A river in Luristan. Its source in the Kuh-i-Gurgi (?) is known as Gir- dab-i-Mir ’Abbas Khan. The general direction of the river is from north to south, and after a course of perhaps 50 miles, it falls into the Karkheh, 3 miles below the point where it is crossed on the road to Dizful. It is an im petuous mountain torrent, and is filled with immense masses of rock brought down by the strength of the current from the neighbouring mountains : and the force of the water is at the same time so excessive that accidents frequently occur in crossing. The water is salt from the bed of gypsum which it traverses : it is, however, of the most pellucid clearness, whence its name from the Arabic Zulal (pure). As this river is on the caravan road from Kburramabad to ’Arabistan it has many times been bridged over, but only the bridge built by Muzaffar-ul-Mulk now (1905) remains. Timur is said to have crossed by the bridge at this point, but the pathway along the bank of the river to it is, by report, impassable for artillery. There is a very difficult and dangerous ford, about 1^ miles below the bridge, and about 3| miles from the ruined fort of Kaleh-i-Raza. This river has in former days been confounded by geographers with tne river of Dizful, but Rawlinson points out that they are totally different streams, and, moreover, that the Ab-i-Zal is not now, nor ever was, called the Ab-i-Dizful. Rivadeneyra halted on its banks, 41 miles from Dizful on the road from Khurramabad at an elevation of 2,020 feet; and Schindler records seeing the remains of some one-arched bridges a little above the ford. Bell (1884) writes about the Ab-i-Zal which he crossed at 45 miles from Dizful :— . “ famp on the left bank of the river Zal. The Sagwand sub-division of the r Bajnan tribe of Lurs, Chief Haji ’All Khan, in all about 1,000 families, was encamped here. The Zal is here a rapid stream, 20 feet to 00 feet wide, flowing in a deep valley between perpendicular cliffs of conglomerate, 50 feet to 100 feet high ; it was unfordable : a day later, nearer its mouth, it was 2 feet deep and fordable. Its valley is 2 to 3 miles broad. To the north it is bounded by the Kuh-i-Kailun, a range of barren, contorted hills, in parts largely composed of decomposed gypsum , to the south lies the Kuh-i-Kabir, a range of barren, steep hills much cut up by deep crevices. A mile south of the camp the Ab-i-Zal falls into the Saimarreh river, by which name the Karkheh river is known down to this point. ^ There is a ravine of the same name as the river, of which it was a gully, some 30 ; deep, cut into the conglomerate by the river, which now runs at a 112 IB C18 ABI—ABR still lower level, having worked out a second course. {Report of a journey through the Bahhtidri Country to Shushtar. — Bell ; Rawlinson ; Schindler ; Rivadeneyra ; Rabino, 1905.) AB-I-ZARD— A river of Khuzistan, which rises in the mountains of Mangasht near the village Mai Agha, north of the Ram Hormuz plain. Passing through a diffi cult gorge, it traverses Abul-’Abbas and enters the small plain of Bagh-i- . Malik, and is here joined by a small stream, which rises near Kaleh-i-Tul. Leaving this plain, it forces its way through the precipitous range of lime stone and gypsum hills, and joins the Ab-i-A’la on the plain of Ram Hormuz near the village of Manjaniq. Its w?»ter is of the most exquisite transparency, and is celebrated for its purity throughout the country : near the point of its junction with the Ab-i-A’la are several bitumen springs. This river varies much in volume ; in April it is a rapid torrent, between 2 and 3 feet deep, and about 40 yards in breadth ; in the month of May it is said to be often impassable, but towards autumn it becomes again much diminished. It is 20 feet wide at Rud Zard, and turns several mills.—(Layard; Wells.) AB-I-ZAZ, vide AB-I-DIZ— ABKUZAT— A river of Khuzistan, crossed by the road from Badrai to Mandali.

It lies about 35 miles east of Abadeh, 34 miles from Yazd, and 164 miles from Shiraz, in the centre of an oasis surrounded by a waste. It is governed by a Khan. Water and supplies of every sort are procurable. Fuel is scarce. The plain of Abrquh lies, roughly speaking, from north-east to south west, and is bounded on both sides by mountains. It is 52 miles wide atits narrowest point. The plain is a dreary, sandy waste, with here and there patches of salt. The villages of Isfinabad, Mihrabad and Shiraz lie on its western border. Near Abrqfih and to the east of 9 it is a line of black, jagged hills, rising abruptly from the plain and crowned with ruins of some size, amongst which a dome, called Gumbad-i-’Ali, is particularly conspicuous. Abrquh was the place of assembly of the adherents of Lutf ’All Khan Zand before the last attack of that Chief on Shiraz in 1793.— (Felly; Malcolm ; Browne, 1888 ; Vaughan, 1891; Arbuthnot, 1905. ) ABTAF— Elev. 4,270'.

AFSHARS— A tribe of Persians who are spread over Kirman, Fars, Luristan, and Khu- zistan, and round the lake of Urumieh. No good account of them is available. They are said to be of Turkish origin and to speak a dialect of that language. Morier says their two principal branches 'are Shamlu and Karklu, and they number 20,000 families. They principally reside in towns and are to be found in great numbers at Ab-i-Vard, the birthplace of Nadir Shah, who was of the Karklu branch of this tribe, and at Kalat, the place so care fully peopled and strengthened by that conqueror. The Afshars are looked on with great suspicion by the present dynasty of Persia. They were one of the seven Turkish tribes to whom Shah Isma’il Safavi owed much of his success, and to whom, in consequence, he gave the name of Kizil Bash. Napier adds that Shah Isma’il Safavi, who brought the clan from Azarbaijan, whither they had emigrated in the track of Tartar traders from the banks of the Jaxartes, settled there in the open valley of the Qibqan, in which are the hamlets of Darband and Qibqan, the first village in the state of Darreh Gaz.Layard says the tribe of Gunduzlu of Khuz'stan is a branch of tlie Afshar tribe. They were found here by Nadir Shah and compelled by him to return to the north of Persia, but on his death they again went back to their former pastures. Before their deportment by INadir, the Afshars occupied the greater part of the province of Khuzistan to the foot of the great chain of mountains, and even the country now inhabited by the Ka’b Arabs, where Dauraq was their principal settlement. The Bakhtiari were confined to the mountains, and the Afshars were generally sufficiently powerful and united to oppose them with success if they ventured into the plain. The Gunduzlu now number 1,500 fighting-men, and acknowledge the supremacy of the Bakhtiari Chief. The Afshars are also found round lake Urumich and in the district of Sain Kaleh in the south-east of the province of Azarbarjan. In the latter the title was disputed by the Chardaurl tribe, with whom they are in conse quence in a constant state of feud. gheil, who commanded a regiment of Afshars of Urumieh, says they are the wildest and most turbulent lot in Persia, always quarrelling, robbing, and getting drunk. Nevertheless, they had fine physiques, and had the making of very excellent soldiers in them. They have the character in Persia of being officious and loquacious flatterers.

Long. 51° 17' 30' E. Elev. 360'. The chief place of the Tangistan Persian coast-district of Ears; it is situated 27 miles east-south-east of Bushire town and 17 miles north-north-west of Khurmuj, the capital of the adjoining district of Dashti. Ahram stands at a short distance from the right bank of the Ahram or Bahushi stream, a little below its exit from the hills, and is overlooked by the Kuh-i-Dukhtar mountain, a few miles to the north-east. From the Kuh-i-Dukhtar the Bahrami range stretches south-east to the Kuh-i-Khurmuj. The town, which is not now walled, lies near the mouth of a gorge lead ing into the hills, down which comes a broad, stony ndld ; it covers an area of nearly | a square mile and is enclosed by date groves on the north and south, and palms also partially mask its western face. On the south west side is a stone fort, the residence of the Khan of Tangistan, which has walls 40 feet high and round towers at the four corners. The town within is crowded with mud and stone houses and contains many mat huts, but a large proportion of the houses are ruinous and uninhabited. The inhabited houses number about 250. The inhabitants may number about 1, 500 souls and belong to the various tribes, which, under the name of Tangistanis, compose the population of the surrounding district. They depend on the cultivation of wheat, barley, dates and water-melons, which are irrigated by small streams and have no industrial or commercial resources. Communication with Bushire is, how ever, maintained by constant caravans. Animals are 20 horses, 5 mules, 40 camels, 200 donkeys, 70 cattle and 500 sheep and goats, and the date palms are estimated at 20,000. The grazing in the neighbourhood is excel lent. The water appears to be abundant but brackish. Stotherd says it is almost undrinkable, but adds that slightly better water can be obtained about 11 miles up the gorge mentioned above. Butcher, on the other hand, says that it is plentiful and good Near the town are some hot, sulphurous springs which are believed by the Persians to be a very efficacious cure for all diseases. The villagers used to manufacture gun-powder from sulphur procured from these springs. The water is so warm that it is with difficul ty one can bear one’s hand in it. Fuel is very scanty except from date- trees. The camping-ground here is good. St. John says that when the Ahram river is dry, or nearly so, from April to December, the pass, 2 males east of Ahram, is practicable for loaded mules, but rarely so during the winter. Monteith thinks it could be made passable for guns without much labour, but the Persians have never attempted to bring artillery by this route. The following routes branch off from Ahram, which itself is the second stage on the Bushire-Bandar ’Abbas route :— (1) To Kalimeh, 20 miles by the Tang-i-Bahush. (2) To Borazjun through Abad. (Native information.) (3) To Galuki, 3 miles to the south. (Native information.) (4) To Guainak, 17 miles. (Native information.)

A considerable village on the left bank of the Karim river, situated at the head of the rapids to which it gives its name, and at the western end of a rar ge of sand-stone hills which subside before reaching it, but re-appear at some distance on the opposite side of the river. It stands upon a somewhat hmh bank, 31 miles below Wais and 42 from Band-i-Qir. The country behind it is desert. At the north end of the village, on an elevated salient of the river bank, there was until recently a large, dilapidated, rectangular Persian fort, but it has now been pulled down for the sake of the materials : an Imdni- zddeh is still a feature of the place. In the stream, opposite the lower end of the village, are some mills which are removed in lime of flood ; and a little below these again is a bluff or rock, forming part of the bank’ and traversed by a gallery, which probably carried mill races in former times. Immediatejy below this rock is a garden on the bank belonging to fhe Mu’-in- ut-Tujjar. The houses number about 160, and, except a few which aro of stone, are built of sun-dried bricks. The population is about 8C0 souls ; most of them are Arabs of mixed tribes, but there are some Persians. The majority are engaged in agriculture, but about 60 mules are owned by them To Ahwaz belong 17 sailing boats of 10 to 15 tons burden, besides the river steamer Shushan of 30 tons’ capacity, and her barge of 50 tons There is also an iron barge belonging to the Mu’in-ut-Tujjar. The native boats, which can be, and are, towed up the rapids when necessary drop down the river without the help of sails from Shalilai on the Gargar to Ahwaz in 3 days, and from Ahwaz to Muhammareh in from 4 to 6 days. Some pilgrims to Karbala adopt this means of conveyance, especially thoseAHW-AHW 25= from Shushtar and the Bakhtiarl country and a few from Isfahan. There is a ferry at Ahwaz with twr* small boats. Ahwaz is situated in the southern ’Arabistan district of Ahwaz ; and its revenue is divided equally between the local headman and the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The rapids at Ahwaz are formed by 7 ledges of rock crossing the river in the direction north 85° west to south 85° east. These reefs are merely a prolongation of the Pusht-i-Kuh across the plain. The rapids are fully described in the article on the Karun river. The country on the town side of the Karun is a bare plain, with very slight patches of cultivation here and there, and on the south-east side of the town is a range of sand-stone hills, perfectly bare. A few hundred yards north of the town is a ridge, round which the river passes, rendering it a very strong position. On the occasion of the advance of a British de tachment up the Karun in pursuit of the Persian troops from Muhammareh in 1857 the Persians took up a position on this ridge, but finally did not defend it. xlhwaz occupies a portion of the site of the ancient city of Aginis, with the materials of which it is built. There was once a large and flourishing city here, as is testified by the numerous ruins in its vicinity. Of the ruins of the ancient city, the most noteworthy are an old bridge and the remains of a palace, on part of the side of which the present village has been erected. In the vicinity of the ancient city, and excavated on the west side where the face of the hill is abrupt, are numerous hollows, some in the form of sarddbs, and probably used by the former inhabitants as such, whilst others have exactly the shape and dimensions of a coffin. Under the name of Hormuz-Ardashir, Ahwaz was in former times the capital of ’Arabistan, but it suffered greatly during the rebellion of the Zanj in the 9th century A.D., and was for a time the residence of their leader. It was partially restored by the Buy ids in the 10th century, and the main town, situated on the east bank of the Karun, was then connected by a masonry bridge with a quarter which stood on an island in the river. [Curzon — Ainsworth—De Morgan—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) AHWAZ (District)— The largest but not the most important district of Southern ’Arabistan. Position and boundaries .—Ahwaz district reaches on the west almost to the Karkheh river, meeting there the district of Havizeh. On the south it is bounded by the districts of Muhammareh and Fallahleh, on the south east by the district of Jarrahi, on the east by the district of Ramuz, on the north-east by the Bakhtiari country, and on the north by the districts of Shushtar and Dizful. Natural features and general topography. —The great plain between the Karun river and the Ramuz district, which has no general name, though parts of it are distinguished and designated, lies entirely in the Ahwaz district, of which it forms about half. This plain is generally grassy, and in favourable years it is sprinkled with patches of wheat cultivation. After rain it becomes swampy, and in some seasons the mosquitoes are very troublesome. The Gupal stream enters the plain at its eastern end and forms a marsh at Shakheh towards its centre. The principal hills are those 112 IB B, ,20 AHW—AHW of Ahwaz and Bunneh. A considerable strip of country, parallel to the Kariln river on its east side, is drained by the Malih hollow, which begins near Ahwaz and ends near Gharaibeh in the Fallahieh district. A ridge of higher country divides the marshes, formed by the Malih in its lower course from the overflow southwards towards the Jarrahi of the surplus waters of the Gupal stream. The main feature, however, of the Ahwaz district is the Kariin river bisecting it. The part of the district to the west of the Karun is still, except for information from native sources, virtually a terra incognita. The following is a table of the principal natural features and localities, having names which occur in the district :— Name. Position. Nature. Remarks. Ahwaz (Kuh-t- oi Jab&amp;l-ul).

Villages and 'populations .—The fixed villages of the district are almost, without exception, situated on the Karun, the largest being Nasiri, Muzaffari, Ahwaz, Braicheh and Wais, and the settled population of the district, including, besides the Karun village, the large semi-permanent settlements of Banneh and Shakheh ; may be estimated at 13,000 souls. The sedentary population consists chiefly of Bavleh, Al Bu Kurd, Dizfulls, Shushtaris and Ma’awieh ; but among them are Hamaid, Zarqan, Hawa- shim and Muhaisin, and a very few Tkrish and Sabians. The Ka’b of Banneh and Skakheh are here reckoned among the fixed inhabitants of the district, and there is a proportion of miscellaneous Arabs and Persians. The mud brick used in domestic architecture is of the same pattern as in the Jarrahi district. The nomad population is very much larger, amounting to about 37,930 souls, and includes the bulk of the Bavleh and ’Anafljeh tribes. Besides these there are Faratiseh, Hamaid, Hardan, Hawashim, Jama’, Ka’b, Mara- wuneh, Muliaisin, Al Bu Rawaleh, Bait Sad, Salamat, Shawakir, BaniAHW—AHW 29 , \ Tamlm and Zarqan. Of these the Hamaid, Hardan and Salamat are chiefly found on the outskirts of the district. The following is a tabular account of the principal among the minor tribes which have their head-quarters in, or are peculiar to, this district. Name. Location. j Fighting strength. Remarks. Faratiseh Chai faqaisat 60, of whom 20 are mounted and 20 armed with rifles. The Faratiseh are politically allied to the Bavieh, but are said to be of Bant Lam stock and to have immigrated from the neighbourhood of 'Amareh on the Tigris. Hawashim Muwaiileh and Aminieh on the JSarun, and scattered. 150, of whom 130 have rifles but none are mounted. The Hawashim have 100 mules and donkeys, and pay in their revenue at Wais. The tribe are said to be related to the Kinaneh section of the Bani Lam. Jama' .. On the Gupal stream 150, of whom 60 are mounted and 60 have rifles. They are politically connected with the Bavieh, but pay revenue at Kut-ash- Shaikh to the Samsam-ud-Dauleh, 11- Khani of the Bakhtiari. They draw their fresh water at Hilweh. Their live stock are 100 camels, 200 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. Ma’awieh Braichsh on the Karun 200, of whom 60 have rifles and 30 are moun ted. At one time subordinate to the Bavieh but now recognised as a separate tribe. Harawuneh .. Right bank of the Karun between Aminieh and id'ami and to 20 miles inland. Their focus is at Luqbair. 200, all with rifles, of whom 60 are mounted. This tribe pay half of their revenue through the 'Anafijeh and the other half direct to the Shaikh of Muhammareh’s Deputy Governor at Nasiri. They own 100 camels, 400 cattle and 5,000 sheep and goats. Bawaieh (A1 Bu) Li aimi on the Karun and ifvhairabad on the Karkheh, the latter in the Dizful district. 200, of whom 50 are mounted and all are armed with rifles. The position of the A1 Bu Rawayeh in revenue matters is the same as that of the Marawuneh. Their livestock are 100 camels, 200 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. They bear an evil reputation as thieves and robbers. Shawakir Shavveh 50, of whom 10 are mounted and 20 have rifles. They are subjects of the Rhurafa of the Hawizeh District, but their revenue is paid through the Rhaikh of the Bavieh with whom they are politically allied. They have 20 camels, 60 cattle and 800 sheep and goats. Apart from the Hawashim and Ma’awieh, all of whom are settled, and from 20 families of the A1 Bu Rawaleh in the Dizful district, these minor tribes appear to be entirely nomadic, and to represent a Bedouin popu lation of about 2,250 souls. They all cultivate wheat and barley, and some of the Hawashim are weavers. Agriculture, trade, and communications .—These subjects are dealt with in the general article on Arabistan, but here it may be noted that there is an old, disused canal leaving the Karun at Ahwaz village, which runs southwards for 30 mil£s and is lost in the marshes on the right bank of the Jarrahi river west of Gharaibeh. On the western side of the Karun, a canal, it is said, formerly took off at Maqtu’ and ran to Hawizeh. The principal route is that from Ahwaz to Ramuz town, the length of which is 60 miles. It is joined by a route from Wais, at about 30 miles from Ahwaz, passes Shakheh at 26 miles, crosses the Gupal river at 32 miles and enters the district of Ramuz at 39 miles. Administration .—The district is subject to the Shaikh of Muhammareh who manages it through a Deputy Governor, with head-quarters at Nasirl,30 AH W—AIN at present a nephew, named Haji Shaikh Rahmah, The Deputy Governor only acts on orders from the Shaikh and has little real power outside the village in wdiich he resides. The Shaikh of Muhammareh is also represented in the district by various political agents; the principal of these at the pre sent time are Mulla Thani at Kut-un-Naddafieh Kabir, through whom the revenue of the Hamaid and the Faratiseh and that of a few of the ’Anafijeh is collected ; Mulla Abus Saiyid at Muzaffari, who is responsible for the A1 Bu Kurd community in that neighbourhood ; and Shaikh ’Anaieh at Umm-ut-Tamair, who is in charge of the right bank of the Karbn generally, and through whom part of the Hardan tribe pay their revenue. These agents usually deal with their master direct and not through his represen tative at Nasiri, but there is no fixed rule in the matter. The Shaikh of Muhammareh maintains police posts on the Karim in this district at Kbt- un-Naddafieh Saghir (10 rifles), at Milaihan (20 rifles, of whom 10 are mounted), and at Qajarleh (60 rifles, of whom 50 are mounted). For ad ministrative purposes the Ahwaz district is divided roughly into two tracts, that of Bavieh on the west and that of Karun upon the river. So much of the district as lies west of the Karun is claimed by the Nizam-us-Sultaneh as his property, and it is understood that the Shaikh of Muhammareh pays him 3,000 tumans a year on account of the tract, but does not admit the validity of the title. It has been suggested that Ah waz is derived from Ahwaz, the plural of the word Huz, common in Southern ’Arabistan in the sense of a cultivated area or estate. The conjecture is plausible and furnishes an explanation at the same time of the origin of the name Hawuzeh and possibly even of that of Khuzistan—the old name of ’Arabistan—which may have been originally Huzistan. Another derivation of Ahwaz is given in Curzon’s Persia, Vol ume II, 351 (footnote) : see also Le Strange, page 232. —{Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

Three villages close to one another in the Gurji sub-division of Faridan in the Isfahan province ; about 12 miles from Nimajird and about 80 miles from Isfahan on the Burujird road. The inhabitants, all Mussulmans, still speak Georgian. They live in a valley, about 1 mile broad, at an eleva tion of 8,440 feet for Akhureh-i-Bala and 8,140 feet for Akhureh-i-Pain. The valley is clear of snow for 7 months, but for 5 months, from November to March, the snow lies so deep that the villagers have to keep to their houses ; the flocks are housed in. underground chambers. Provisions for man and beast for the 5 months of winter are laid in during the open weather. In June the pasture is said to be abundant. These villages contain about 350 houses and 1,500 to 2,000 inhabitants. Provisions scarce ; sheep numerous ; corn scarce ; donkeys abound, every village having 50 or 60. The popular etymology of the name is Ab-Khuran, “ giving to drink, irri gating,” because the rivers, which rise in the mountains in the neighbour hood of Akhureh, water the country all around. A road leads from Akhureh to Dizful via Gartak, 6 stages.— (MacGregor — Bell — Schindler.) AKLIT, vide IQLID. ’ALA, vide JARRAHI (River). ALAF-DAN— Lat. 29° 1' N. Long. 50° 53' E. Elev.

Their belief would appear to be an exaggeration of Shi’ahism, of which the foundation is an excessive devotion to ’All and his descendants. The votaries of this creed are very numerous, though chiefly confined to the genuine Persian tribes of Lak descent. They are also found among the Guran Kurds, and around the higher parts of Zagros. Rawlinson considers them to _ be of Jewish origin, from their features having a decided Jewish cast. It is said that their religion enjoins that at certain periods they shall congregate at night in a particular spot. At these times the greatest license is said to prevail, and the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes to form part of the ceremonies prescribed by their singular creed. It is certain that a more than masonic secrecy is maintained among them in regard to the mystical rites and ceremonies connected with their religion, and that they are exceedingly jealous of curious enquiries on the subject. The ’AH Ilahi, says Jones, when journeying in Muhammadan cities, outwardly conform to the cere- monies of the established faith. They also adopt the deportment and dress of their Muhammadan nders* so as not to excite the prejudices of the fanatic people. This probably is not applicable to the sect in South Turkey, but in Persia. S-heil says that, though their tenets are perfectly well-known, not the slightest attempt is made to disturb their opinions, though they do not openly proclaim their dissent from the prevailing religion of the country. The ’AH Ilahi in their own villages do not deny themselves the use of wine and spirits, nor do they abstain from the prohibited food of the Quran ; on the contrary, they indulge freely both in swine’s flesh and intoxicating liquors,— [She'll — M^ciIcoItyi — J ones—Rctwlinson Chesney .) Saiad Rustam is the name of the present chief priest of the ’AH Ilahis, and he lives at Zardeh, the sacred place of the sect on Mount Dalahu. The ’AH Ilahis have no religious books, and rarely, if ever, pray. They do not keep Ramzan. ’AH is invoked by them under the name of Daud, accomt panied by a sacrifice of a sheep or some beast. _ The marriages of this sec- are supposed to require the sanction of the chief priest, but resort is not unfrequently had to Shi’ah Mullas. The dead are buried without prayer, but the head of the corpse faces the Kiblah gs amongst Musalmans. On the birth of a child the father and mother give it its name, but if the family is well-to-do, a Saiad is invited to a feast on the seventh day after its birth, and is called on to name it.^— {T.

Husainieh, a tract on the right bank of the Diz, 7 miles above 'Ajir-ub, ex tending from the Diz to the Shavur. 500, all with rifles, of whom 300 are mount ed. This section takes its name from one Mauleh who is a brother of Shaikh Haidar; the other name is generally pronounced Charim or Jarim. Livestock is 500 camels, 400 mules, a few buffaloes, 1,000 cattle and 20,000 sheep and goats. Ditto Ma’alleh Ditto 50, all with rifles, of whom 30 are mounted.

Besides the above, or, perhaps, included in them, is said to be a section, called A1 Bu Nassi, wholive atHaddamehon the Diz and have 300 rifles. The whole tribe may be estimated at 700 souls, of whom perhaps not more than 1,000 have a fixed residence. The senior member of the Ma’alleh section formerly commanded the obedience of the whole tribe; but at the present time, two rival Shaikhs divide the Kathir between them.46 ALK—ALK Shaikh Farhan Asad is followed by the Bait Karim sub-section ahd pari of the Dailam sub-section, and has his head-quarters atDehNau; the village of Kaleh Banut also belongs to his party.

The total annual revenue demanded from, the two is said to be 4 t 725 tumdn8. The relations of Shaikh Farhan Asad are with the Persian officials at Shushtar, and those of Shaikh Haidar with the authorities at Dizful, consequently the tribe may be regarded as divided between the two districts of Northern ’Arabistan.

Extent and 'physical characteristics. —The length of Angali is about 15 miles from north to south, but its breadth is only 5 to 10 miles. The whole is a plain and the southern part is a barren waste. The climate in winter is cold and in summer, from June to August, a very hot wind blows in the middle of the day. Population.—The people, numbering only some 2,700 souls, are a mixed race, the blood of BehbehanI Lurs probably predominating ; there is a small Arab infusion. The men of Angali are described as bold and hardy. They wear daggers and are well-armed with Martini rifles, nearly 400 of which are possessed in the district. All the people follow agricultural pursuits and their dwellings are huts of sun-dried bricks and mud* or of wood and matting. They are Shi’ahs by religion. Agriculture, trade and transport. —Wheat and barley are, with the ex ception of a few dates and melons, the only crops. Trade is small and of a commonplace character. It is calculated that the district possesses about 100 horses, 500 donkeys and 2,000 sheep. Communication with Bfishire is by boat from Shif. The local Hashim man of Angali is equal to 18 Tabriz mans of Biishire. Building materials, chiefly Zanzibar timber and Muhammareh matting, are imported through Bushire. Administration .—The villages of Angali are ruled by a hereditary Khan who is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, his family are said to have been originally Nuyi Lurs who immigrated from Behbehan 60 or 70 years ago, but they have absorbed some Arab blood. The present holder of the Khanship is Ahmad Khan, son of ’Abbas Quli Khan, son of Hasan Quli Khan ; he is about 33 years of ago, a man of good sense and pleasant man ners, and has one brother, Najaf Khan. The administration is of the same type as in the neighbouring districts ruled by Khans. The only tax is one of 65 brans per gdv of cultivation, being here a plot measuring 250 by 250 yards. The annual sum at present payable to the Persian Government as revenue is 1,500 tumdns, exclusive of the farm of the tolls at Shif.

Water is good and plentiful, from at least 24 wells, averaging in depth from 16 to 20 feet, from which water is drawn by bullocks, and from about 6 hauz. About 1| miles off are said to be about 5 water-mills, each of which grinds 100 mans of wheat daily. Wheat from Lar, Bastak and the surrounding country is brought here to be ground.The mills are worked by a warm sulphur spring, which used to be a popular Zoroastrian resort in ancient days, and is even now resorted to for the cure of various skin diseases. The river north of the town is said to rise near Ishkanan, reported to be 10 farsaJchs, two marches from here, and behind the west extremity of the Kuh-hGavbus. Thence the river flows alongside the road down a valley, disappearing underground about 6 miles west of Anveh, and re-appearing somewhere near the sulphur springs. Thence it flows on down a great plain past Tudiran, and rounding the northern slopes of the Khamir peak, empties itself into the sea near Khamir.

In conjunction with Southern Arabistan it is at least nominally one of the provinces of Persia with a Governor-General appointed from Tehran over it. Boundaries.—Northern ’Arabistan is contiguous on the south with Southern Arabistan The eastern boundary runs from 5 miles north of Band-i-Qir on the right bank of Ab-i-Gargar to Bulaiti, and thence crossing to the left bank, extends to a point some 7 miles to the east of Shushtar! The northern boundary runs_along the foot of the mountains, including with- the plains of Aqihand Ab-i-Bid across the Ab-i-Dizto Mazraeh-i-Salih- abad !0 miles north-west to DizfCil, and thence through Paj-i-Pul on the Karkheh to an undefined place near the Dawarij stream, on the undemarcat- ed Turko-Persmn frontier. This frontier bounds Northern ’Arabistan on tiiiG west. Geography.—The country is flat and alluvial and lies entirely outside the mountain system. It has, however, a few small ranges of hills across it. A range extending for about 60 miles in a north-westerly direction runs from the rig t t&gt; an k of the Karkbeh above Nahr Hashim to the left bank of the Dawa- ri]. Another range runs from the south-east corner of the plain of Aqili, along ■ ^ ngh y bank of tbe Karun and Ab-i-Shatait, to a point a few miles south- wes. of Shushtar On the left bank of the Karun a red sandstone range known as the Kuh-i-Fadalak (1,200 feet), runs facing the last from the point ]ust below the Shur-i-Labahn to within 2 miles of Shashtar. A short rocky 112 IB w60 ARA-ARA !, ridge finally crosses the Ab-i-Diz obliquely at Kut Bandar. The only permanent risers are the Ab-i-Gargar and Shatait, branches of the Karun ; t the Ab»i-Diz, with its tributaries ; and the Karkheh. Climate. Rainfall .—Rain may occur any time at intervals between the end of October and end of April, rarely in May, and never between that month and October. There is seldom continuous rain except from the end of Novem ber to end of January, when three days at a time may be expected qnce or twice every year. In February rain is scarce, in March and April heavy thunder showers •ccur, but of a local character. The desert near Muhammareh, being a sort of clay, becomes difficult to traverse after a day’s heavy rain. Farther up, where there is an admixture of sand, it soon dries. Winds .—During the summer the prevailing wind is north-west, dry and fairly cool in June, but later is a hot wind; and where it comes off a sandy desert, as is the case along the Karun after roughly the first 50 miles from Muhammarch, the dust carried by it is very trying to the exposed parts of the body. Heat .—Nights near Muhammareh are seldom oppressive near the Karun river, the water of which is fairly cool, being 8° less than that of the Shatt- al-’Arab. At Ahwaz the nights during the hot weather are, as a rule, cooler than at Muhammareh, and the climate there is dryer; but owing to there being no trees in the neighbourhood it is exposed to the full force of the hot winds during the day. After the beginningof September it is sometimes damp damp and the heat is no longer excessive. Cold .—There is usually frost in the mornings between 27th January and 4th February and in some years in December or early January. During wet weather fever and dysentery often attack natives.— (McDouall, 1907.) People .—The inhabitants of Northern ’ Arabistan are of a mixed type. The most important of the Arab tribes is the A1 Kathir, at present divided into two factions : one occupying both banks of the Ab-i-D'z above the country of the Anafijeh, and thence westwards as far as Ajairib ; while the other is located farther west towards the Karkheh. The powerful Bait-Sa’d also dwell upon both banks of the Ab-hDiz, while higher up the Karkheh in the neigh bourhood of Shush is found the Surkha tribe. To the west of the Karkheh and still within Persian territory are the numerous Bani Turuf. The Mian-ab, the country between the Ab-i-Shatait and Ab-i-Gargar also con tains some miscellaneous tribes of Arab extraction. The inhabitants of Dizful and Shushtar are of mixed and somewhat mysterious origin. They are considered to be of Assyrian descent with a large and now preponderat ing admixture of Persian blood. Other inhabitants of Northern ’Arabistan are Lurs and Bakhtiari. The former, who are wholly nomadic, come down from their native mountain fastnesses at certain seasons of the year. Of these the Sagwand at the present time (1906) are most in evid ence ; the other two remaining powerful divisions, the Bairanawand and Dirakwand being more or less at open warfare with the Persian Govern ment. The Bakhtiari may also be considered nomadic, for although KhanARA—ARA 61 own most of the land to the north between Shushtar and Dizfhl, they merely visit the district to collect their revenues and to administer their property. The Arab tribes are all nomadic, except those settled in the Mian-ab ; and they, as well as the nomads of other races, are avowedly predatory. The town population is quarrelsome, and disturbances are especially frequent in Shushtar. The language of the country is formed from the various dialects of Arabic and Luri, besides the yatois of Dizful and Shushtar. The weapons in use are rifles or carbines of Martini pattern, and long heavy sticks used alike by Arabs and Lurs who cannot afford to buy rifles. Rifles are still (1906) scarce among the Bakhtiari, and there are not many in the Mian-ab ; but the townspeople of Shushtar possess several hundreds. Swords and daggers are scarce. Population. —No attempt is made to estimate the number of the popula tion. Produce, trade and resources. —Northern ’Arabistan is divided into two revenue districts with head-quarters at Shushtar and Dizful ; the boundary between the two is a line passing between Pavindeh and Kunak in the north through a point east of Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah in the south. For details of products and trade, this Gazette r, Shushtar, Dizful and Muhammareh. The neighbourhood of Dizful being recognized as one of the chief centres of mule produce in Persia, its importance in this regard must not be over looked. Major Arbuthnot in his report on the “ Mule-producing districts of Persia II,'Dizful and Shushtar ” writes thus (1905) “ Mule breeding and supply, [a] Shushtar. —Theris no market for mules in the town of Shushtar itself, neither can it be said to be a ‘ district ’ from which such a supply is obtainable. There are a limited number of mules in use for cultivation and such purposes, while an equally limited number of small caravans reach there from Isfahan and Dizful. “(6) Bakhtidri llidts. —Coming to Shushtar from the east on the last few stages of the Bakhtiari route, the encampments of the llldts (tent- dwellers) of those tribes in their black goat-hair tents are met with, but amongst their grazing herds and young stock, a mule foal is a rara avis. To tap any supply such as they may and do possess to a limited extent, it would only be possible to reach them when they come up towards the Chehar Mahal in the summer months. I would fix a limit of purchase of animals from this source between 18 months and 3| years at 300 head. Very few, if any, animals over this age could be obtained from them. &lt;£ (c) Dizful.—D\ziu\ itself contains a certain number of working mules of 3| years and upwards for purposes of cultivation, as well as a very limited number for transport work. A further small supply is probably obtainable from the Arab tribes from the neighbourhood of Shush (Susa), to the west of the Ab-i-Diz, The head of these is the Shaikh Mushattat, while a Lur chief, named Karim Khan, who owns land near to them, would be of assistance to a purchasing officer. i “ But, speaking generally, there cannot be said to be any market to | working mules at Dizful, and any sudden demand from India for any number exceeding 200 could not be easily met. “ As the market for young stock, however, up to 21 years, Dizful probably holds a position of its own. The mule-breeders of Western Persia are the62 ARA—ARA Lurs, of whom there are several important tribes, notably the Sagwand Bair ana wand and Dirakwand, who in turn are broken up into numerous taifdis or divisions. It may be here noted that while all Bakhtiari are Lurs all Lurs are not Bkahtiari. ’ “ (d) bur llldts. (*') SaywanA—The Sagwand are the largest breeders among the Southern Lurs, and the dealings of a purchasing officer would be limited at present to them. The present head of this tribe is Fazil Khan who ,s represented in the neighbourhood of Dizful by his two nephews,’ Jihanjan Khan and Hasan Khan. These two chiefs, the former especially are intelligent men of some business capacity and seem anxious to assist an Englishman in any possible way. The Taifeh-i-Saadat (Saiyids), one of the divisions of the Sagwand, especially devote themselves to the breeding of mules, and are said to own young stock to a number of over 2,000 at the commencement of their selling season, viz., December. They come down into Dizful yearly from the mountains to dispose of their stock to buvers from all parts, notably the Bakhtiari, who find their market later on in the neighbourhood of Isfahan, while the Behbehanis purchase for the Shiraz market. “ {ii) Bairnawand and Dirakwand.—With. these tribes there is for the present difficulty in having any dealings ; nor is it prudent for a European to enter Lunstan from the south for the time being. This state of affidrs is not likely to improve in the near future, unless some energetic action is taken by the British Government in reference to the arrangements latelv entered into for the opening up a road from Dizful to Kirmanshah bv the new British Road Company. ^ Summary of mule supply .—I would summarize the capabilities of supply of all the districts dealt with in this report as follows Mules. District. 3£ years and upwards. 18 months to 2 -|- years. (a) Shashtar To be tapped'') from the Chehar / 25 Nil. (6) Bakhtiari Iliat .. .. ■&lt; Mahal during the f months June— l August.

That of a two-year’old mule is from hrdns 200 to krdns 250 less than the price asked at Isfahan for a working animal at four years of age of the same class. The average prices of a mule of 24 months would on this basis work out as follows :— Rs. Ordnance, about . • .. 225 Baggage .. 125 Transport „ '.. 90 “ The cost of transport per head from Dizful to Karachi would not exceed Rs. 75.” The currency, weights and measures are much the same as those of South ern ’Arabistan (q.v.)\ but the Shushtar man is 15’487 lbs., and that of Dizful 16’969 lbs., both avoirdupois. The unit of distance is the farsakh, among the Arabs often called a sd’at (hour), and is from 3^ to 4| English miles. Communications.—For details in regard to communications by water, vide this Gazetteer, Karun river, Ab-i-Shatait, Ab-i-Gargar, and Ab-I-Diz. Besides these the following are the principal land routes either within or passing through the province :— 1. Band-i-QIr to Shushtar, 2 stages, 32 miles (Persian telegraph line). 2. Band-i-QIr to Dizful via Kut Bandar, 3 stages, 57 miles. Both the above are continual ions of a land route from Muhammareh through Ahwaz and Wais, which follows the Persian telegraph line. 3. Shushtar to Dizful via Ab-i-Bid, 2 stages, 42 miles. 4. Shushtar to Dizful via Kuvnak, 2 stages, 36 miles (Persian tele graph line). 5. Dizful to Khurramabad, 14 stages, 157 miles. 6. Shushtar to Isfahan via Malamir, 16 stages, 308 miles. 7. Dizful to Muhammareh, by the right banks of the Ab-i-Diz and Karun, 10 stages, 216 miles. 8. Dizful to Hawizeh, along banks of the Ab-i-Diz and Karkheh, 6 stages, 108 miles. 9. Dizful to ’Amarah (left bank of Tigris in Turkish territory), 5 stages, 114 miles. 10. Dizful to Baghdad via Zorbatish and Mandali, 14 stages, 340 miles. The two last routes are extremely precarious. The Persian telegraph line connects Dizful with Shushtar and thence with Ahwaz and Muhammareh. From Ahwaz a line connects with Bushire via Ramuz, Behbehan and Borazjun. Administration .—The whole province of ’Arabistan, which includes the northern and southern divisions, is nominally under a Persian Governor- General appointed from Tehran. The seat of Government is also nominally Shushtar. But of late years the Governors-General have spent most of their time at Dizful more especially towards the end of their pro-Consulship, by which period they have made themselves personally so unpopular as to find a residence in the more turbulent town of Shushtar one of considerable personal danger. Their chief object is to obtain the good will of a few power ful individuals whose assistance will enable them to collect the revenue64 ARA—ARA and any further sums extorted upon which they can agree. The revenue consists, in the country, of taxes on produce, not on land ; and in the town ships on industries and shops. Taxes are imposed in each district in a lump sum which is apportioned locally. The Mustaufis, who are Accountant- Generals, as well as tax farmers, are liable to be changed every year. Other officials are a Director of Customs, a Post and Telegraph Master ; each of which exists both at Shushtar and Dizful. There is no system of Civil or Criminal Justice ; a travesty of it being administered in the towns by reli gious leaders, while in the local districts it is dispensed more equitably by the local chiefs. Outside the towns the principal factors in administration and politics are the A1 Kathir, the Sagwand and the Bakhtiari chiefs. The first two named administer the country to the south-west of Dizful, and to its west and north-west respectively ; while the Bakhtiari Khans tacitly assume the administration between the Karun and Ab-i-Diz up to the foot of the mountains on the north, on thein arrival in the neighbour hood in the early winter months. ’ARABISTAN (SOUTHERN)— Southern ’Arabistan is the alluvial district of Persia, situated at the head of the Persian Gulf and contiguous to the northern province of the same name. Together with Northern ’Ajabistan it constitutes what was once known as the province of Khuzistan. Boundaries .—On the north it adjoins the northern province, vide des cription of its boundaries. On the west the undemarcated frontier between Turkey and Persia continues an indefinite boundary on that side to a definite point on the left bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab, about 1 mile above the village of Hadd and opposite the Turkish island of Tawaileh. From this point to the Persian Gulf the boundary with Turkey, fixed by the Treaty of Erzeroum in 1847, is the Shatt-al-’Arab. The southern boundary is the coast of the Persian Gulf from the estuary of the Shatt-al-’Arab eastward to a point between Shah-Abul-Shah and Dilam. The eastern boundary is undefined, but may be taken to be an imaginary line running from the last named place to the intersection of Lat. 31° north with Long. 50° east; another imaginary line from this intersection to a point a few miles from and im mediately north of Band-i-Qir completes the perimeter of the province. Physical geography .—The whole of the country is a flat surface, being broken in one place only by a range of hills running west-north-westerly and east-south-easterly, which the Karun river pierces at right angles at Ahwaz. These hills are of red sandstone and rise to 200 feet ; the entire length of the range being about 30 miles. The level, open plains are mostly barren and thinly sprinkled with a desert scrub, though some portions of it are grassy and in spring bear patches of wheat and barley. On the east the Fallahieh and Ma’shur districts in winter become considerable salt swamps, while on the west the neighbourhood of Hawizeh is altogether a marsh. Date trees line the banks of the Shatt-al-’Arab, of the Upper Bahmanshir, and the Karun to 20 miles above Muhammareh ; elsewhere there are no trees but only belts of willows, tamarisk and other bushes fringing the banks of the rivers. The only navigable river is the Karun, for full description of which see this Gazetteer, The Jarrahi river enters the Persian Gulf at its extreme northerlypoint by the Khur Vasta. About 20 miles lower down the coast, the Hindian river with a south-south-westerly course flows into the Gulf also. The Karun and Jarrahi run ordinarily between steep banks of some height. Climate. —The temperature at Muhammareh ranges from 32° to 115° Fahr., the hottest month being July, and the coldest January. Rain falls at any time between the middle of October and the middle of May, the heaviest being in December ; the total amount, however, is very small. A dry north westerly wind in May foreshadows the Barih or north-wester, which lasts for 40 days. From the middle of October to the end of April the climate is comparatively cool and pleasant. The summer heat is intensely dry but not unhealthy for natives. People. —The population of Southern ’Arabistan has been roughly esti mated at 300,000 souls. With the exception of the town of Muhammareh, some of the larger villages, on the Hindian where there arc a number of Persians, and about the Jarrahi, where there arc many Lure, the people are all ’Arabs with a considerable infusion of Persian blood. The ’Arab tribes of Muhammareh and Fallahleh are semi-settled, while those to the west of Karun are wholly nomadic. The former are mainly agricultural, while the latter are chiefly pastoral. The vast majority are Shl’ah Muhammad ans. The principal tribes of Southern ’Arabistan are the Muhaisin and the Chaub, who have their centres at Muhammareh and Fallahleh respectively ; and the Bavleh, who occupy a large part of the country between the Karun and the Jarrahi. Important tribes upon the Karun are the Hamaid, wdio occupy Nadafia on the left bank, and both banks of the Haddam stream ; the Zargan, located at Kraneh on the left bank and a small tract on the Jarrahi; the Anafijeh, whose territory extends westwards from the right bank half-way between Band-i-Qlr and Aliwaz to the left bank of the Karkheh ; the Salamat in the neighbourhood of Wais ; and the Ban! lamlm, who extend from the right bank near Saba westwards to the Turkish frontier, south of Hawlzeh. There are several minor tribes of less importance, but who are still independent. The language of Southern ’Arabistan is a dialect of Arabic, with a certain proportion of Persian words. The fighting strength of the southern province was calculated in 1902 to be 54,500 men, an estimate founded on tribal books. They are principally armed with a rifle of Martini pattern, of which there are computed to be at least 15,000. Cartridges are refilled locally with native powder. Besides these rifles there are a certain number of fowling pieces. Products and trade .—The Muhammareh district produces dates; the Karun neighbourhood wheat and barley ; the Fallahleh district wheat, rice, dates and wool; the Jarrahi and Hindian districts rice, wheat and wool ; the Hawlzeh district rice, wool and ghi. As compared with the northern province the supply of livestock is very limited. A certain number of sheep and goats are grazed in the pastoral districts about Ramuz and Hawlzeh, while in the villages on the banks of the Karun a further limited number are found, as well as buffaloes in the lower country. Mules and camels are found at Nasirleh, though scarcely sufficient to meet the demand for transport up country; and neither are bred locally. The towns of Muhammareh and Nasirleh are the only considerable centres of trade, both internal and foreign. The imports of the province are cotton. 112 IB I66 ARA—ARA goods, twist, drugs, spices, tea, indigo, rice, and metal goods from India 5 cotton and metal goods from tire United Kingdom ; kerosine oil from Russia ; matches and iron from Sweden ; sugar from Belgium, France, Austria and Egypt. Exports are dates, wool, cotton and wheat to India and the United Kingdom. The grain traffic, which is much hampered by arbitrary embargo on export, is chiefly the produce of the northern province, the output of the southern district being very small in comparison to what it has been or could be made, with proper use of the Karun water for irrigation purposes. The currency is that of Persia, with the silver krdn as a basis, and nickel and copper coins of smaller values. The krdn has a fluctuating value be tween annas 4 and annas 4|, the coin chiefly in circulation being a piece of krdns 2. Besides the 1 and 2 krdn pieces there are a limited number of silver 5 krdn pieces in use. The nickel coins are pieces of the value of 1 and 2 shdhis, respectively • 20 shdhis going to 1 krdn. Copper pieces are called pul-i-sidh, which are subject to great fluctuations in value ; though the unit of these coins may be taken to be worth 2 shdhis. The tumdn is an imagi nary unit, though of the fixed value of krdns 10. Besides these the Turkish lira, a gold piece of a fluctuating value of about Rs. 14, and the Indian rupee have no difficulty in finding a market of exchange. The only fixed weight is the misqdl, which is used as a standard for comparing different weights; 100 misqdls are equal to 1 lb. avoirdupois. The commonest weight in use is the man, which is extremely variable. Those that come under notice in the province are— Man-i-Bazar (Muhammareh ) =148 lbs. avoirdupois. Man-i-Sif ( do. ) =160 lbs. do. Man-i-Basrah ( do. ) =168 lbs. do. Man-i-Shushtar (Nasirieh ) =15*487 lbs. do. Man-i-Isma'llieh ( do. ) =392 lbs. do. Man-i-Shdh ( do. ) =13*25 lbs. do. Man-i-Tabriz (Imperial Customs) =6*675 lbs. do. Besides these, Dizful, Fallahieh, Hawizeh and Ramuz each have their local man. Each man is uniformly divided into 8 charaks. Grain is nominally sold by the kharwdr, which contains 50 Shah or 100 Tabdz man. flhe unit of linear measure is the zar, which is as nearly as possible 41 inches. The unit of square measurement is the jarih, which has a superfi cial area of about 24 acres, though in practice it is somewhat variable. Climatic Conditions.—See ’Arabistan (Northern).

Twenty-six miles from Bafq is what is called its gate. It is the termination of the pass in the descent of the road from Shaitur. The gates consist of sheer walls of rock, 400 feet high and 200 yards apart, the passage being a quarter of a mile long.

The population is estimated at 2,000, but many have left and lead a nomad life, owing to oppression and excessive taxation. The houses here lose the typical Persian domed style ; they are all flat- roofed with thick rafters covered over with mud. The revenue of Baft was, in 1894, 790 tumdns, but the Governor takes 1,000. There are 2 car penters, 2 mechanics, 5 dyers and 4 felt-makers. The revenue of the district of Aqta’, with which Afshar is incorporated, ■ was 28,000 tumdns in 1903.

This tribe has about 1,000 excellent matchlock-men, and a small, but very efficient, body of horsemen.

BAHMANSHlR, or BAHR-UL-MASHlR — The name given to the channel, which leaves the left bank of the Karun, 2 miles above Muhammareh, and forms the eastern boundary of ’Abbadan island from that point to the sea. It should be, however, mentioned that the name Bahmanshir is locally applied to the last reach of the Karun, called, and perhaps wrongly, by Europeans “ Haffar ” {vide this Gazetteer— Karun and Haffar). The Bahmanshir has among the natives no general name but is described by various local terms in its different reaches, such as Shatt Shaikh and Shatt Tura, taken from the villages on its banks. The total length of the “ Bahmanshir ” as accepted by us, is 54 miles by its winding course and 40 in a straight line; its mouth in the Persian Gulf is about 10 miles east of the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab. There are two remarkable bends rather below the middle of its course. The breadth of the river varies from 300 yards in the upper reaches to 600 yards, and even l a mile, as it’approaches the sea. Towards the middle of the nineteenth century it carried about two-fifths of the water of the Karun, and its depth at low water was nowhere less than 9 feet ; but by 1890 the uppermost I 15 m iles of its course had become obstructed by banks which in places dried almost across the channel at low water, and the R.

The whole district is divided into three sections, both for geographical and revenue purposes— G‘) Chehar Mahal, the extensive plateau at its northern and north eastern. boundary; Elev. — {MacGregor.)BAK-MK 90 (m) Pusht-i-Kfih, the mountainous country between the Chehar Mahal and southern and western plains : (m) Those plain and other lands merging with the province of 'Arabistan. It is essentially a mountainous country, with its loftiest peaks rising Mountains. to a height of 14,000 feet. The general run of the many ranges, which conduce to make this country one of the most rugged tracts on the face of the globe, is by almost parallel lines from north-west to south-east. Taking these in order from the south they may be arranged.as follows:— {a) The Kuh-i-’Alwani, rising to 720 feet above sea-level, and bounding the plain of Ramuz on the north. (6) The range of gypsum hills running from the Tul Khiat, south-east of Shushtar, through Jam, and rising to 2,000 feet above sea- level. (c) The Kuh-i-Darband and Kuh-i-Asmari ranges, rising to 3,200 feet above sea-level. (d) The Kuh-i-Mangasht, rising to 12,000 feet above sea-level. (e) The Kuh-i-Garreh and the Kuh-i-Sabz, rising to 13,000 above sea- level. (/) The Kuh-i-Rang or Jaihun, the Saldarun and the Zirreh ranges, with their loftiest peaks ranging from 14,000 feet downwards. ((/) The Kuh-i-Gupganak, Chui, Jehanbin and Ahangari, varying between 12,000 and 14,000 feet above sea-level; (h) and, finally, forming the boundary on the north with the Isfahan plateau, the Kuh-i-Rukh and Kuh-i-Badkun, rising to 9,000 feet above sea-level. Besides these more important ranges there are numerous shorter ones, which serve the more to score the surface of this country, and distort from it any semblance of order and regularity. This general aspect of nature’s convulsions is modified by the notable Plateaux and pasture plateau of the Chehar Mahal; though this, from lands. all its physical aspects, may be said to be merely a more elevated portion of the great central plateau of Persia, on which Isfa han is situated. Still it is included in the Bakhtiari territory, which also extends, though under somewhat undefined and contentious conditions, over the adjoining broad valley or plateau-land of upper Linjan as far as the right bank of the Zindeh Rud. The Chehar Mahal, thus situated at the north eastern comer of the Bakhtiari country, is roughly 40 miles deep and 60 miles broad with an area of some 2,400 square miles, and a normal elevation above sea-level of 7,000 feet. Its boundary on the north is the range Kuh-i-Rukh, Badkun, while on the south it is shut in by the great Zirreh range ; on the east it fringes on the Qashqal country, while on the west it is enclosed by the tributaries of the Zindeh Rud and the Kuh-i- Rang. It is also cut up to some extent by some lofty and mgged mountain ridges, notably the Jehanbln range (13,000 feet) and the Kuh-i-Ahangan. The level and undulating portion is fine arable or pasture soil; though but little use is made of it except in the immediate neighbourhood of villages. It is well-watered by many streams, which are never dry and all of whichdrain through the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash into the tributary of the Karun, known as the Ab-i-Behishtabad. It is, however, absolutly destitute of any trees or shrubs, though it is said that oak trees once abounded on it. The pasture lands of any noticeable extent, beyond the Chehar Mahal, lie to the south-west on the lowest slopes of these great mountains. The richest portions are those from the plain of Tuleh westwards to Shushtar and southwards to Ramuz. The plain of Malamir, covering an extensive area of some 150 square miles, affords good grazing, though overrun to some extent by camel-thorn. Beyond these places specially alluded to, the numberless higher valleys as well as the slopes of the mountains are capable of sustaining the considerable flocks and herds of the tribesmen from early summer well on. into the autumn. Woodlands and vegetation, —In comparison with other parts of Persia this country may be said to be fairly well-timbered: but it is merely a com parative statement. While nature has evidently intended that it should abundantly supply its inhabitants with wood for fuel, which is a necessity in these lofty regions, the latter have done their best to diminish this kindly provision. It is, in fact, a question of comparativelv few years, beyond which the higher regions must perforce become untenable during the winter season ; at least in those parts in which the present habitations exist. As an example, the Chehar Mahal may be taken. This plateau is absolute ly bare of trees, beyond a few specimens of the oak to be found in the neigh bourhood of Deh-Kurd, while, on the authority of the Sardar (1905) HajI ’Ali Quli Khan, the whole district was at one time well-wooded. Evidence of this is adduced by the timber used in the building of the houses of Deh- Kurd, much of which is of oak and which further investigation has proved to have been grown in the immediate locality. The Sardar attributed the almost total disappearance of this tree to their system, not only of cutting down, but also of digging up, the roots for firewood. What has happened here is evidently likely to be realised in those parts which are still, though only lightly, wooded. The oak, of all trees, seems to grow most naturally, but is rarely seen of a height exceeding 40 feet. Other kinds are the ash, walnut, plane, elm, poplar, willow, ilex, beech, wild-rose, briar, hawthorn, maple, fig, vine, almond and hop. Of arborescent and herbaceous plants the variety is very extensive and their natural characteristics are those of a temperate climate. Of the Astragalus in particular there arc many species, of which the most interesting probably are the A. Anisacanthus (gaz) and A. Heratensis (gum tragacanth). The manna tree produces long, flat, horizontal branches, which get covered with the sugary excretion. When ripe, the natives place sheets of cloth on the ground underneath the small trees, which they beat with sticks and thus collect the gaz, or qianna, on the nloths below. The gum tragacanth is collected and placed in small leather bags, in which it is exported for sale to Isfahan and other places. Nature, as may be expected in a country of this physical formation, has been lavish in its water-supply, and that of Rivers. the finest quality in so far as the highlands are concerned. It is, however, a curious fact that in the lower and pasture lands the water is, for human purposes, more or less 112 1. B. N98 BAK—BAK i undrinkable ; and the brackish streams considerably outnumber the sweet waters. Commencing from the northern end of the country, in which as is natural, the moi.e important rivers have their birth, and taking them in this order from the map we find— (1) The Zindeh Bud. This river has several sources; the principal being those from the Zardeh Kuh and the Galgushak ; the Chash- meh-i-Jaihun or Kuh-i-Rang ; the Ab-i-Zarm and the Ab-i-Cha- man-dar. It runs north-east through the Tang-i-Gaz, dividing Faiidan, a district in the Isfahan province, from the Chebar Mahal : still flowing north-east it receives from the north-west a considerable stream in the Khursang, after a course of some 50 miles and near totheKuh-i-Mashzad. It then flows due east, till at 80 miles it alters its course almost due south and later south-east, and waters the broad valley of upper Linjan. The point where it bends north-east to leave the valley, after a course of some 160 miles, may be taken to be its limit on the border of the Bakhtiari territory; which has never extended beyond its right bank. (For description of the river’s farther course, vide Gazetteer of Persia, Vol. II.) During this 160 miles of its course, it is crossed by four bridges— {i) Wooden bridge, only erected in spring, a few miles above Darsu- vadjan in Faridan. (i ) Pul-i-Zaman Khan, a stone bridge at 110 miles. (Hi) Pul-i-Bagh Badran, a wooden bridge. (iv) Pul-i-Kaleh, at the village of Madraseh at 140 miles. A stone bridge of eight arches, broken in the middle and replaced by ricketty piles. The river has a sluggish stream for the greater part of the year, owing to the comparatively slight drop in elevation from its rise until it disappears in the salt marsh of Gav-Khaneh, some 60 miles south-west of Isfahan. It is fordable at most seasons and at most points in its course within this district. (2) The Ab-i-Behishtabad. This river, which is reckoned to be one of the chief sources of the Karun river, represents the whole drainage of the Chehar Mahal. The several streams flowing through the plateau unite near its south-west corner, and leave it through the defile of the Tang-i- Darkash Warkash. Near the south exit of this gorge is situated the village of Behishtabad, from which it takes its name ; and 2 miles below that village it runs into the Karun, after a course (of its longest feeder) of some 75 miles. [For full description see this Gazetteer, Behishtabad (Ab-i-).] (3) The Kilrun. This river, which is one of the most remarkable natural features of this region, has its origin at the north-west extremity of Bakhti ari land, and within a very short distance of at least one of the sources of the Zindeh Bud. In its strangely zigzag and impetuous course it either traverses, or is conterminous with, nearly every portion of this territory. (For full description see this Gazetteer, “Karun ”.) (4) The Ab-i-Bazuft or Rudbar. This river, the most important and vol uminous tributary of the Kerim, rises in close proximity to it. It runs into the Karun, 12 miles below the Pul-i-’Amarat near the hamlet of Charkeh,BAK-BAK 99 after a comparatively straight course north-west to south-east of some 70 miles as the bird flies, or 120 miles along its bends. [For full description see this Gazetteer, “Bazuft (Ab-i-)”.] (5) The Ab-i-Shallar or Shimbar. This stream rises in the mountains north-west of the Kuh-i-Safid in Luristan ; and, running an almost due south course, it flows into the Karun at about its 265th mile, and at the apex of its great stretch almost due north after leaving the Pul-i-Shalu. It carries a considerable quantity of water when in flood, being about 80 feet wide and 10 deep, at its junction with the Karun. [For full description see this Gazetteer, ‘‘Shallar (Ab-i-).”] (6) The Bulawas. A considerable stream which rises in the mountain of that name, a spur or offshoot of the great Mangasht range to the south-east of Kaleh-i-Tul. Two small streams run into it near ’Ala Khurshid and several others later during its course of some 60 miles. This is at first south-easterly, then easterly and later due southerly past Ramuz, until it finally empties itself into the Jarrahi. (7) The Shur-i-Labahri or Shurab. This river, the last of any size in this country, has its origin in the hills about Jaru and the plain of Tuleh (2,000 feet), all its feeders being of brackish water. This feature becomet more fully developed as the river pursues its course in a north-wess direction, the air in the vicinity becoming redolent of naphtha. It waters the fine pasture tablelands west and south-west of Shushtar, and eventually empties itself into the Karun River, about 8 miles north of that town (vide this Gazetteer, “Shurab”). Besides the above, there are innumerable streams and springs watering the many valleys and ravines of this fortunate country, of which mention may be made of one as typical of others. This is the Ab-i-Hillisat : this stream, which runs a tortuous course of something under 20 miles before losing itself in the Karun waters, bursts out of the foot of a great precipitious wall of the Kuh-i-Surkhun, immediately facing which the caravanserai of that name has been built. The water from this spring is of crystal pmity and gushes out with such force as to form a fair-sized stream before it has run a course of twenty yards. The climate of Bakhtiari land, owing to the great differences in elevation, varies exceedingly; and its inhabitants can accommodate themselves Climate almost according to their pleasure. That of the country north and north-east of the great Garreh mountain is the climate of a temperate zone during most months of the year, though the cold experienced in mid-winter is somewhat excessive. As a general statement it may be taken that for three months the thermometer regularly registers some degrees of frost by night, and falls below zero (Fahrenheit) on occasions : while the highest shade temperature in summer is 80° Fahrenheit. It is in these regions, in a mise en scene which unites all the elements of natural grandeur—snowy crags, rugged hills, moun tain meres, rushing torrents and profound ravines, that the tribesmen have their ydildq or summer quarters. South and west of this line, as far as the plain of Malamir, the climate is temperate for six months of the year, but almost unbearably hot during the summer months. Descending farther100 BAK—BAK 4 to the levels of the plains about Ramuz and Shhshtar, the winter and early spring provide a climate very similar to that of the Riviera. During these months the Khans and a large proportion of the tribesmen move their tents and herds down to these pasture-lands, their qishldq or winter quarters, to escape the rigours of the climate in the highlands. The Khans themselves, with a large following, make their first camp at Malamir and later move down to Ramuz and the plain of Ab-i-Bid, 18 miles north-west of Shushtar. The climate during the summer months in these localities is intolerably hot; the thermometer registering on occasions as much as 120° Fahrenheit and more in the shade. The heat and the multitude and variety of biting insects make travel ling and camp life painful in the summer in the lower part of the country. In general terms their language may be said to be Persian, but the Lurs, of whom the Bakhtiari are a sec tion, have a dialect of their own. This is a mixture of Persian and Arabic, which is easily conceivable, owing to the considerable intermarriage with Arab women. Rawlinson says that their language is from the old Farsi, which was coeval with, but distinct from, the Pehlevi tongue in the time of the Sassanian Kings. AH Bakhtiari are Lurs, but all Lurs are not Bakhtiari. Who the •pi,, , j tt- .l Lurs are and whence they came is one of the un- Ethnology nnd H,story. of ^ ^ ^ were described^by Rawlinson as “ an unknown and interesting people.” They appear to belong to the same ethnical group as the Kurds, their neigh bours to the north ; though they consider it an insult to be confounded with them, and call them “ Leks.” Most writers agree that they are of aboriginal, old Aryan, or Iranian stock, who preceded Arabs, Turks and Tartars in the land ; and that they have lived for centuries in their present habitat. The expression “ Lur ” is used by modern Persians as a synonym for a rude or depradatory person, while the word Faili ” means a rebel. From the earliest days we read of this mountain country as a wild and inac cessible region, inhabited by uncouth and formidable tribes. They set at nought the authority of the Mrdesand Persians : they defied Alexander and provoked Antiochus. The invading Arabs found them a hard nut to crack. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, however (1155 to 1424 A. D.), they were ruled over, from Isfahan to Shushtar, by a powerful Mussulman dy nasty, known as the Fasluiah, under the title of Atabegs. Various travel lers of olden days have referred to them. In the 17th century, Chardin speaks of them “ as having no settled abodes, but living in tents with their flocks and herds, of which they have an infinite number. They are govern ed by a Khan, who, chosen from among themselves, is set over them by the King oi Persia : to whom they pay both tribute and tithes.” In 1722, when the Afghans sacked Isfahan, we hear of the Bakhtiari opposing them with 12,000 horsemen, who were, however, easily defeated by the invaders. Shortly after, the Turkish Pasha of Mosul, thinking to take advantage of the prevailing disorder, invaded the Bakhtiari country : though successful in this, he was not able to remain in it. Nadir Shah made the same ex periment, but with no great success. He tried to transfer a portion of the tribe to Khorasan, but they fought their way back again. An experiment,however, made by him in enlisting large numbers of them in his army met with great success ; as they acquitted themselves with great bravery at Herat and Kandahar. At his death in 1749, a Bakhtiari chieftain, ’All Mardan Khan, became virtually the ruler of Persia ; though only for a short time, as he was assassinated in 1751. In the early years of the 19th century the Sardar Asad, of the Haft Lang division of the tribe, defied the Persian Government and raided up to the walls of Tehran ; but later had to take re fuge in the mountains near Deh-i-Diz, ultimately surrendering to Muham mad ’All Mirza, son of Path ’AH Shah, and making his peace with the Government. When the Haft and Chehar Lang divisions of this people originated it is Haft and Chehar Lang impossible to state authoritatively. A popular divisions. account is current among themselves that the whole tribe originally migrated from Syria under a single chieftain, one of whose descendants left upon his death two families of seven and four sons, respectively ; the struggle amongst the latter for the supremacy originated in a tribal division that has lasted ever since. Whatever is the true story, a bitter enmity has existed from early times between the two divisions. This has, happily, in the present day subsided, and, it is hoped, disappeared for good and all. The head-quarters of the Haft Lang or northern division is in the Chehar Mahal and adjoining valleys ; while Kaleh-i-Tul is the strong hold of the Chehar Lang or southern division. The latter were always the poorer and more nomadic of the two divisions ; and friction constantly arose from the overlapping of their pastures, and migration from the summer winter quarters of the former through the Chehar Lang country. The marriage of Khuda Karim Khan, the chief of the Chehar Lang, with the sister of the present (1905) Sardar Asad, Haji ’AH Quli Khan, of the Haft Lang, which took place a few years ago, is, for the present at least, the sign of their acceptance of the chieftainship of the combined clans by the southern division. The various ruling branches of the two divisions will be found set forth in the two appended statements of the 6 ans * genealogy of these Khans.104 BAK-BAK They may be described generally as men of considerable natural intelligence while most of them have aspirations towards a higher level of civilisation than they have hitherto attained. Several of them have travelled in Europe and India, besides having made the usual pilgrimage to Mecca ; and a few are able to converse either in French or English. Their hospi tality is unbounded ; and some of the leading Khans have built suites of rooms suitable for the reception of European visitors in their Kalehs, which are a feature of the principal villages throughout the country. The gov ernment of the country is invested in the Sardar or Ilkhani, assisted by the Ilbegi and other lesser authorities. The title of Sardar can only be be stowed by the Shah, and has apparently been withheld during some periods for no very clear reasons. That of Ilkhani, which should be synonymous with the title of Sardar, has sufficed when the more official designation has been withheld. A rather nominal division of these titles happens to obtain at the present time (1905) owing to the bestowal of the dignity of Sardar Asad on Haji Qull Khan : while Najaf_ Quli Khan, lately Ilbegi or Com- mander-in-Chief, has been appointed Ilkhani. The arrangement, however, is not a happy one and causes some friction. Besides these titles, the other appointments, which are made locally and are merely ratified by the Shah, are those of the Governors of the Chehar Mahal, Kaleh-i-Tul and Ramuz. The present (1905) yearly assessment paid by the Khans to the supreme Government at Tehran is 54,000 tumdns, made up as follows :— Chehar Mahal .. .. .. 24,000 tumdns. Pusht-i-Kuh .. .. .. 16,000 „ Property within the province of ’Arabistan 14,000 „ 54,000 tumdns. N.B. —One tumdn is Jcrdns 10 and at the present exchange Jcrdns 4 equal Re. 1. In regard to the last item, Bakhtiari territory was held to be confined to the left bank of the Karun in its large sweep noithwards from the Pul-i-Shalu or Gudar-Balutak ; but of late years the Khans have bought up land on its right bank adjoining the fertile plain of ’Aqili between Shushtar and Dizful, and thus made in this direction consider able encroachments on he Province of Northern ’Arabistan. Following the description of their chiefs, something should be said con- Tribesmea. cerning the people» Tents in 1905 : a rough census taken showed that there were about 36,000 tents or families of the Haft Lang ; while the Chehar Lang numbered about 11,000 tents. Of the latter figure 6,000 tents were said to be joined to the Haft Lang, e.g., to be directly under the authority of the Sardar, while 5,000 tents were affiliated to Burujird : but that, on an emergency, the whole could be counted upon to join the Haft Lang. Taking one tent to represent five persons adult and otherwise, the total population arrived at is 235,000 souls. The bulk of the tribesmen are very poor, and in their black tents will be found neither gold nor silver, but Life, religion and habits. vesse } g 0 f j ron an( j CO pp er . There is next to no education among them. The viTage Mulla acts as school-masterBAK-BAK 105 but h-s attainments and curriculum are equally limited. Out wardly and by descent the Ba'chtiaris are Muhammadans, but hold very little to any of the outward forms of that faith. They are, never theless, not without a crude and simple religion of their own ; and entertain distinct notions of the existence of God and a future life. Their character presents a strange combination of dignity and license—on the one hand they are modest, self-conta : ned in deportment, obedient and hospitable, loyal to family and tribal ties and generally free from any serious vices : on the other hand, they are savage when excited, particularly in the pursuit of their blood-feuds ; while, partaking in some degree in the characteristic of the Lur, they are adroit and incurable thieves. Their general bearing presehts a refreshing contrast to that of the urbane Persian. Smooth ras cality finds ho place here, but in their character and mien is the free breath of their native hills. Alike in costume and complexion, darkness is the pre vailing hue of the external man. Their hair is black, with its two long uncut tufts curled behind the ear ; black their bushy eyebrows and flashing eyes beneath; black the beard and moustache ; black the crowning kula ; black he coat of the male ; and blue-black the indigo-dyed cloak of the fe male. Those of the men who are robust and muscular in appearance have a very manly bearing : but, owing to exposure and privation, a large percen tage present the very opposite aspect. Fever, assisted by dirt and neglect, has ravaged their systems: and as a ru’e they are not long-lived. They wear loose trousers and a long full skirted coat, either a qabd or sirdarl. Round the waist a cartridge-belt that holds the ammunition for the rifle, usually of the description of a Martini carbine, which is strung over the shoulder,, while a dagger and pistol are carried in Ihe belt. The women are tall and dark, of shapely limbs and carriage when in good health : but they suffer, in this latter respect, more than the men. Absolutely neglected and despis ed by their male sex, they exist under the fihhiest conditioiis : old women before they are out of their teens and hags by the time the;y reach thirty yea^s of age. Left to themselves and their own rude treatment, or more properly, neglect, the simplest cases lead to loss of life or of limb. The people generally are most ignorant of the simplest rudiments of hygiene ; and their chiefs, until quite recently, have not been much concerned about it. The disease, which perhaps wreaks most havoc among them, is that of the eyes. Nearly every man, woman and child in Bakhtiari country is a sufferer in this respect. Dirt and neglect are undoubtedly the chief causes, assisted by the glare from the rocks or snow from which their head dress affords no protection. Besides this,- the commonest affliction, which results , in loss of sight in a large number of cases, the commonest ailments from which they suffer afe ague, pneumonia,- enteric and typhus. Pasture is their chief Occupation, their flocks and herds being the principal ^ T . T , sources of their wealth. They have engaged very r ufce an commerce. j n an y f 0 rm of commerce, beyond the sale of their sheep until the acquisition in late years of the valuable property on the banks of the Karun and in the plains about Bhushtar and Dizf ul. In these luxurious plains they have engaged in extensive cultivation of wheat, barley and tobacco; and as their annual assessment shows, they are taking a much 112 I. B. O100 'BAK—BAK extended interest in agriculture as affecting commerce. It is difficult to make any precise statement as to the numbers of their sheep, goats and Sheep and cattle. cattle ; but it is probable that of the two former, together, there is something little far short of half a million head—while their herds of cattle are numerous. In former days a considerable amount of horse-breeding was carried on ; and the Bakhtiari Horses. breed g ained a repute that has not yet perished. Those animals in evidence at the present day, however, are of a weedy type, and, though probably admirably adapted to the country, being nimble, surefooted and enduring, are not now found in sufficient numbers to be seriously considered. While very few mules are Mules. actually bred within the limits of Bakhtiari land, ^e numbers to be found there, for carrying acri- eu tura purposes besides young stock being grazed and trained with a view to ultimate sale are very considerable. Major Arbuthnot, in his report on ^subject (190a), estimates their numbers in the Chehar Mahal alone at . 3 2 ’ 00d ] I iead ‘ Tllos e travelling through neighbouring districts would be included amongst this number ; so that a fair estimate of the total number throughout the whole Bakhtiari territory, of one year and upwards in age would be 15,000 head. Of this number, 8,000 animals may be held to be fit for immediate transport purposes. The neighbouring province of Luristan, where these mules are almost entirely bred, is the chief source of the mule-supply of Persia. A few donkeys of a very fine breed and a very limited number of camels, merely brought into the country for Other animals. carrying purposes, complete the tale of livestock in these regions. Cod and Naptha.—It is asserted by the Khans themselves that their mountains contain coal m abundance, though nothing has been done by them to profit by this knowledge. In the same way it has been known for a long time that naptha or petroleum springs exist in many localities • but it is only quite lately (1005) that any steps have been taken to exploit them. This has been done by the D’Arcy Oil Syndicate, an Association who have already made borings near Qasr Shirin on the lurkish frontier, and who have concluded an arrangement with the Khans. By the terms of this the Syndicate are permitted to make borings and explorations for oil in the country owned by the Bakhtiari and to erect the necessary buildings, and the latter have agreed to protect the works and working parties, and to guard such roads as it might be necessary to construct, m return for an annual payment of £2,000; the Chiefs accent ing responsibility for robbery or for loss or damage to the works and buildings of the Syndicate. It is further stipulated that should oil be °? nd m sufficie nt quantities, and a pipe line be laid, the Syndicate will pay a further sum of £1,GOG per annum for the safeguarding of the pipe-line^- and that m the event of one or more companies being formed to work the oil, the Chiefs shall receive 3 per cent, of all the ordinary shares issued. This agreement is to be m force for five years, provided the Com pany are working during that time; and should'oil be found insufficient quantities and the Company proceed to refine oil and trade in it, the terms will be binding so long as the Concession continues in force.BAK-BAK 107 Communications—External .—The Bakhtiari country, as already des cribed, lies embedded between the provinces of Isfahan, Luristan, Bars and ’ Arabistan. On the north its boundary lies some 40 miles distant from Isfahan by the road ; the prolongation of which is generally known as the Lynch road. The first village of any importance reached in the Bakhtiari jurisdiction is that of Kaveh, Bukh, distant 5G miles from Isfahan. From the north-west, i.e., Luristan, the approaches are through an inhospitable country - and by lofty and difficult mountain passes. From the east, i.e., Bars, the approaches which pass through the ^ Qash- qal country are equally irhospitable, though physically less formidable. It is from the south that this country is most easily reached, and, more important still, from the sea‘—by the great, and only waterway of Persia, the Karun river. This liver, the origin of which has been biiefly noted on above, after a tortuous course through the wild gorges and defiles of the higher Bakhfiari mountains, at length emerges from the hills immediately to the north of Shushtar, in a due southerly direction, and pursues its sinuous course over the wide alluvial plain that stretches to the Shatt- al-’Arab and the Persian Gulf. On the way it receives at Band-i-Qir its main affluent the Ab-i-Diz *, while lower down its channel is inter rupted and its navigation impeded by the rapids at Ahwaz. At the river port of Muhammerah it flows into the estuary of the Shatt-aL ’Arab, by which, 50 miles lower down beyond Fao, the combined waters of the Tigris and Euphrates enter the Persian Gulf. The bar at the outlet of the Shatt-al-’Arab into the Persian Gulf only admits of steamers crossing it, with a draught not exceeding 16 feet; while the anchorage opposite Muhammareh shows from 25 to 30 feet of water. The distance by river from Muhammareh to the rapids immediately abo\ e Nasims 1^.0 miles. The opening up of this, the only, navigable stretch all the year round of the Karun river to foreign steamers in October 1888, though under some what vexatious conditions, was utilised by Messrs. ^ Lynch Bros., who at once put one of their Tigris river-steamers on to this run. They have maintained a fortnightly service ever since, though at a poor return for its upkeep. The draught of their steam-boats does not exceed 3 feet 6 inches to allow of their' passing over the shoals at all seasons of the year When, however, the river is high, e. (]., between December and May' a 6-foot draught would be found quite feasible with careful navi gation. Above the falls at Nasiri, from Ahwaz to Band-i-Qir (the latter at a distance of 46 miles, and situated at the confluence of the Ab-i-Diz with the two branches of the Karun waters), a light steamer of 2| feet draught is run all the year round by Messrs. Lynch Bros, on behalf of the Persian Government This is an arrangement, by which the force of an interdic tion against the use of the upper reaches of the river by foreign navigation is overcome. From Band-i-Qn onwards and up the Ab-i-Gargar (as the left or more easterly branch of the division of the Karun waters js named) nav igation is possible between December and May by this same light-draught steamer, as far as Shalalieh, about 8 miles south of Shushtar. All outside trade with the Bakhtiari, not to mention what is carried through to Isfahan and places beyond, as well as that directly northwards to Shushtar, Diz- O 2108 BAK—BAK ful and Lnristan, passes in the first instance up this waterway. In this aspect it is, therefore, intimately connected with the present and future, prosperity of the Bakhtiari country. Internal. —It is from Nasirl, where Messrs. Lynch Bros, have established themselves, that the caravan route, known as the Bakht’an or Lynch road, starts for Isfahan and cuts through the heart of the Bakhtiari country ; the south-west limits of which are entered about 20 miles to the north-east of Nasirl. This is not only the most important road through the country, but is the only one continuous from end to end of it. It had long been apparent that this road to Isfahan and Tehran, linked up by the Karun river with the head of the Persian Gulf, offered many advantages over the far longer caravan route from Bush ire through Shiraz. This idea took definite shape in 1897, when the Persian Government granted a concession to the Bakhtiari Khans for the improvement of the trade- route from Ahwaz to Isfahan. Messrs. Lynch Bros., the Karun merchants, financed the scheme and undertook the construction of the road, which involved the improvement of the existing track, the building of various caravanserais, and the coi struction of three bridges. Work on the road was commenced soon after, the bridging material being sent out from Europe. In the result, a fair mule track was constructed after immense labour and energy on the part of Mr. Taylor of that firm ; and two bridges out of three planned, and for which material was ready, were put up. The specifications of these bridges are as follows :—- • 1. Pul-i-Shalu or Gudar-i-Balutak, over the Karun river. Wire- rope suspension with piers of solid masonry and a lattice girder. Steel roadway and concrete flooring ; length 120 feat. Clear width of roadway, 10 feet. Adapted to bear an ordinary work ing load of 2£ cwt. per square foct, or a live road, uniformly distributed, of 80 tons. 2. Pul-i-’Amarat, over the Ab-i-Bazuft. A suspension bridge of the same pattern as No. 1. Length 70 feet. Clear width of roadway, 10 feet. Bearing power the same as No. 1. 3. To replace the old bridge at Du Pulan over the Karun river. A steel girder bridge. Length 51 feet. Clear width of roadway, 10 feet. Bearing power the same as No. L This bridge has not been laid, and the material is said to be lying in the caravanserai at Du Pulan. In describing this route as being for the most part “ only a fair track,’’ it must be borne in mind that the great difficulty that had to be con tended with is the run of the many ranges of mountains which it crosses. The direction of the road, generally north-east, necessitates its meeting the several ranges at right angles, with occasional alternatives of very lor g detours to escape them. The result has been that a painful and toilsome ascent is only rewarded by an almost equally steep descent on the fartherBAK-BAK 109 r-' r- - side, to bo followed at a short interval by another stiff climb. The Khans have an agreement with Messrs. Lynch Bros, in regard to the upkeep of this road by the payment of a fixed yearly sum cn their part of Irdns 30,000 ; while thev fa-m out the tolls and the caravanserais, the former alone of which tiny valued at krans 150,000. But misunderstandings have arisen (1905) with the result that the state of the track has become deplorably bad ; and large sums will be required to be expended on it to make it even as good as it was before. It remains to be seen wheth'r a careful and detailed survey of the c&lt; untry may not disclose some better line to escape these terrible gradients ; but, in any case, it will not be possible to avoid crossing most, if not all of the passes, over which the route now runs. These are in order from the south— (a) G&amp;rdan-i-Malvarl .. .. .. 6,500 feet. (b) Grardan-i-Gandum Khar .. .. 7,050 ,, (e) Gardan-i- Barreh Murdeh .. .. 7,850 „ ((d) Gardan-i-Zirreh .. .. .. 8,300 „ or (e) Tang-i-Darkash Warkash .. .. 8,000 ,, Tho second named presents some difficulty during or immediately after a fall of heavy snow ; but (c) and (d) are insuperable obstacles for six weeks and two-and-a-half months of the year, respectively, from the same cause. The last mentioned (e) is an alternative to the Zirreh pass, during the several months in which it is blocked for traffic. The total length of this road, from Nasirl to Isfahan, is about 300 miles. Speaking in general terms, this route is not practicable, or is at least a formidable undertaking be tween 1st January and the 15th March. Nevertheless, from the latest available returns of the traffic on the road, it seems to be in a fair way of proving a commercial success. These returns, giving the number of pack ages or half-loads which have reached and been despatched from Ahwaz, read as follows :— 1903. 1904. 1905. Reached. f Despatched Reached. Despatched. Reached.

Other roads.—Besides this , the only route that can be dignified by the name of ‘‘ road,” with its regular caravan stages, there are the innumerable mountain tracks connecting adjoining valleys. Of these, on the western side, there is a good bridle-path wdth fair gradients from Dizful, almost in a direct line to Ardal. This track skirts the right bank of the Karun river, passing through the Kaleh Dukhtar, north of the plain of ’Aqili and Shushtar : it continues thence by the Gardan-i-Nazirieh Cham into the Bazuft valley, which is again left by crossing the Gardan-i-Chari (9,300 feet), the highest point reached on this road. The track then drops down to the Karun river again and cresses one of its main sources by the stone bridge near Behishtabad. From here it climbs on to the plateau of Ardal, the total distance covered being about 120 miles. This route should not be selected without due consideration, as its westerly portion passes along the border of Luristan ; and that province generally is insecure for tra vellers. Bakhtiari land, on account of its position, is of considerable importance in regard to British interests. Political importance. Situared at the head of the only navigable waterway of the whole empire, and one that empties itself into a sea, in which British interests predominate and are peculiar—inhabited by a people of considerable war like instincts, in some contradistinction to their rulers in Tehran—and fur ther forming, in conjunction with Luristan, a natural barrier to encroach ments from the north—it is not unnatural to suppose that it may play an important role in the future, in what has been aptly termed ‘ ‘ the Mid dle Eastern question.” The inhabitants of Persia, generally, have lost for many ages past, it indeed such a thing ever existed, any feeling of patriot ism or sympathy with their rulers ; and the Bakhtiari are far from being an exception to this rule. Hitherto, treachery, followed by cruel pun ishments, as well as internecine quarrels fostered by the Persian Govern ment, have been the means by which the authority of the latter has been maintained. Such as it is, it exists merely with the idea of obtaining a certain sum of money yearly in taxation ; no single farthing of which is expended for any public purpose—local or otherwise. It is not, there fore, surprising that the Bakhtiari Khans would be inclined to welcome any change, even to the extent of a foreign Government, on which they could rely to free them from the intolerable burden and distrust, which general insecurity of person and property imposes on its sufferers : ^nd it is clear to them that they will have to make some choice in this regard within the no distant future. It is interesting, therefore, to note briefly on the military possibilities Military considerations. of their country. . , (a) Fighting material and efficiency estimates and opinions have been given on the fighting material and efficiency of the Bakhtiari. Taking the latest census of 57,000 tents as correct, it may be reckoned that the numbers of adults and youths capable of bearing arms should be about 60,000 , but allowing for a wastage of 10,000 on account of disease andBAK^—BAK 111 •otlier causes, the real fighting strength may be estimated at 50,000. These numbers, in Major Aibuthnot’s opinion (1905), would expand rapidly under improved conditions of sanitation and general prosperity. The numbers given as immediately available would probably provide some 20,000 to 25,000 men, already trained, in varying degrees, to the use or handling of fire-arms ; and whom the Khans could muster at s^ort notice— of these, perhaps, 10,000 would be mounted men. In regard to their arms, they possess possibly 5,000 rifles or carbines of Martini pattern, but for the most part cf inferior quality and quite unreliable beyond a point-blank range. Other guns of still more doubtful utility, to the number of perhaps 10,000, might be mustered among them. For operations against neighbouring tribesmen these weapons answer sufficiently well ; but would be useless against good modern fire-arms. In regard to the question of “ the efficiency ” of the tribesmen, they have none in the military sense of the expression : but, for purposes of guerilla warfare in defending th ir own mountain homes, as guides, mounted infantry, for raiding on the skirts of an army and as scouts, they would be invaluable to any European ally. The Khans are sufficiently intelligent to know that they have no chance of defending themselves against modern weapons, some of the latest types of which they possess for sporting and other purposes. This same intelligence would prevent them offering any useless resistance to any invasion of their country from the north : but as auxiliaries, they would combine and use all their efforts to defend their country against annexation, in the mere sense of absorption. (6) Supplies. —It has already been mentioned that the country has a Communications. bar ™ r of mountains on tie north, a (ford- ing fine., natural, defensive positions against an enemy advancing from that direction ; while the main caravan route runs straight up to them through the heart of the country. A brief notice as to how this latter should be utilised, in the event of such necessity arising, may not be out of place : this is taken from a note furnished by Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. Douglas, on this sublject :— The road from Nash I to Isfahan may be divided into four sections, viz : 1. Nasiri to ’Alwanieh. 2. ’Alwanieh to Malamir. 3. Malamir to the line, Ardal-Naghan. 4. Ardal-Naghan to Isfahan. Section I, Nasiri to ’Alwanieh, 41| miles.—The distance from Nasiri to ’Alwanieh is 42 miles by the road and is level plain the whole way, culti vated in parts. After leaving the river at Wais the only water that is obtainable is from wells, and is, as a rule, slightly brackish : wells can be dug almost anywhere. The best stages for troops would probablv be — 1- Wais r 16 miles 2. Mulla San! 3. ’Alwanieh .. ., .. .. ^ 13 ” No fuel is obtainable : there is good grazing during the winter and spring. With the exception of sheep and goats and some hhusa in the autumn, no supplies for troops could be obtained en route, and everything would have to be collected beforehand. Carts could move freely over this section in fine weather, but after rain the road from Wais for 10 miles onward becomes a112 BAK—BAK quagmire. A light railway could be run out to ’Alwanieh without much difficulty : not a single bridge would be required, though an embankment would be necessary over the portion (10 miles) alluded to above. ’Alwanieh would be suitable as a transport base, owing to the grazing available during the summer and spring. The space for a camp is unlimited every where in this section. Section II, ’Aludnieh to Malamir, 66 miles .—This section consists of low hills with undulating plains. With the exception of the one steep ascent between ’Alwanieh and Jam, there are no severe gradients, but the ground is in many places very broken and the road runs in parts among rocky hills, and is at present unsuited for anything except pack transport. The stages for troops would be — 1. Jaru .. .. • • • • • &gt; • * . * 18 mil S. 2.

J The best intermediate camping-ground (4) would be near the stream on the Kaleh-i-Tul pi in, about 4| miles north of the fort. There are a certain number of poor habitations at all these stages, but only supplies for a very small party are procurable. Water is generally abundant ; but at Jam the supply of sweet water is very limited, while at Tuleh the only sweet spring is so small that it may be left out of consideration. The water of the stream is, however, only very slightly brackish, and both here and at Jaru animals drink it readily. Except on the Kaleh-i-Tul plain, fuel is not to be found in any quantity, but it could everywhere be easily brought in from the higher ground in the neighbourhood. Ample camping-ground is available at all stages. A certain amount of grazing for transport animals is procurable everywhere during the spring. At other seasons of the yec.r fodder would have to be collected, though camels and donkeys could easily find some grazing. Section III, Mdldmir to the line Ardal-Ndghdn, 80 miles .—At Malamir the mountains are entered and the road crosses a series of bridges. There are several places on the road which are liable to be rendered difficult if not impassable by snow in winter. The troop stages would be—- 1. Bridge at Gudar-i-Balatak .. 2. Deh-i-Diz.. .. • • • • “ •' 3. Pul-i-’Amarat .. •• •• * 4 »* 4. Sarkhun .. 5. Du Pulan .. • * * • * * 6.

The southern slopes of the mountains, on which Ardal and Naghan lie, are covered with oak forest; the supply of fuel being practically unlimited. Small food-supplies could be obtained at the stages, at most of which there are no permanent habitations. There is no grazing at some seasons of the year. At every stage there is a caravanserai built in the form of a walled enclosure, which could be utilised as a supply depot or small fortified post. A brigade of infantry could find room to encamp at all stages, except at Gudar-i- Balutak, Pul-i- ’Amarat, and Sarkkun where the area is limited. ^ ^BAK—BAK 113 Section IV, Ardal Ndghdn to Isfahan, 92 mi7es.—Immediately to the north of Ardal and Naghun is the Gardan i-Zirreh (8,300 feet), the highest point on the whole route and blocked by snow in winter—always and for at least two months. It can be turned on the east via Chigha-Khur, which reaches an elevation of 8,000 feet, and on the west by the track through the road Tang-i-Darkash Warkash, which lies through a rocky gorge and is extremely difficult for pack animals. North of the pass is the fertile dis trict of Chehar Mahal, which lies at an elevation of from 6,500 to 7,000 feet, and thence the Gardan-i-Rukh (7,730 feet) leads to the rich valley o f upper Linjan. The stages would probably be- 1. Shalamzar 2. Shamsabad .. 3. Qehfarukh 4. Madraseh 5. Bagh-i-Wahah 6. Isfahan Water is everywhere good and abundant. 18 miles. 12 „ 10 „ 20 „ 14 „ 18 „ Camping-grounds are ample. Supplies for a small force could probably be collected in three or four days. Fuel could always be obtained near the villages. From the above it will be seen that no supplies for troops or fodder for animals in large quantities could, without previous arrangement, be obtained along the road. For full particulars of this route and probable supplies available, see Routes in Persia, Section I. Addendum. Tribal classification. —Various authorities have classified the different tribes or families of the two great divisions, the Haft and Chehar Lang, of the Bakhtiarl.

Abbott described it as a ruined village, outside which the inhabitants were living under kapahs. Durand, however, in 1878, said it was fairly prosperous, with a good spring close by, which supplies it with fair water.— (Abbott — St. John — Durand^) BALAGHl (TANG-I-)— Lat. 30° 10' N.

It is situated between miles 80 and 84, on the 4th stage from Shiraz, its north entrance being 1 mile south of the Takht-i-Madar-i-Sulaiman. This is the most picturesque portion of the road on that route. The gorge has a width of from 200 to 1,000 yards. At several points where the high and precipitous cliffs close on to the river (a tributary of the Pulvar), the road , has been galleried along the face of the rocks.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.)BAL—BAL 119 BAlA GIRlEH— A group of the Pish-Khh tribes of Luristan (q.v.). BALI RUD BILA RUD or BAL AD RUD— A stream, which rises near Qllab in the foot hills of Pusht-i-Kuh in Southern Luristan, and, passing 5 miles west of Dizful and 1 mile east of Bunvar, joins the river Diz on the left bank, 11 miles below Dizful. Its bed is coarse shingle. In mid-summer it is dry except for pools ; in autumn it becomes a flowing stream supplying many Sagwand camps ; after heavy rain it is apt to become impassable for one or two days, the river coming down in a torrent of tremendous force. On one occasion, when the Shah of Persia was crossing it with an army, 50 horsemen are said to have been swept away, and the force was delayed on its bank, for two days. There was formerly a brick bridge over this river on the road from Khu- zistan to Kirmanshah, but it is now destroyed. There are still traces of Alexander’s old road, a stone pavement and the ruins of a 5-arched bridge. Colonel Bell found the river, at 15 miles from Dizful, 100 yards wide with steep banks of conglomerate. He says that rapids and shallows are numerous in its course and that the bed consists of pebbles and large boulders. Stony undulations, affording excellent grazing, border the river. A route between Dizful and Kirmanshah crosses the Bala Rud between Salihabad and Husaini.— (Rawlinson — Schindler—Bell — Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BALAVAND— A tribe of the Kirmanshah district, who live at Hulilan, near the Ab-i- Simareh: their country is bounded on the east by the Pish-Kuh-i-Luristan, north by the Zagrus ofHurassu; and west by Bijavand.

This place is frequented by fishermen from ’Asalu, who take fish here in large seines and keep a few boats hauled on the point. The village of Bidkhun is about 2 miles north-east and f mile north from the point. It consists of 15 huts, mostly of Shi’ah immigrants from ’Asalh. On the shore of the bay opposite the village is a small anchorage protected from the west by a sandy point and reef. The village is nearly hidden in a grove of date and other trees, and there is a little stream of good water used for irrigation and to turn mills. The people grow tobacco as well as dates and cereals and own 10 fishing baqdrehs. _ The people of ’Asalu have a favourite fishing ground here.—(Constable—Stiffe— Persian Gulf Pilot—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

(Constable—Stifle—Persian Gulf Pilot.) BANDAR DlLAM— Lat. 30° 1' 50'. Long. 50° 12' 15*. Eliv. 15'. A small port on the coast of the Liravi district of Ears, but not forming part of it administratively ; it is situated about 85 miles north-north-west of Bfishire and a similar distance east-north-east of the bar of the 8hatt-al- ’Arab. The town stands upon a low coast extending north and south, and consisting of a strip of rocky land raised 10 to 15 feet above the sea- level, with swamps behind it which run inland for several miles. Half a mile to the south of the place is a little cultivation with some trees ; and to the eastward is a plain containing a few villages dependent on Bandar Dllam. A square fort stands in the middle of the town.and IJ miles to the north east is the fort of Tunub, again mentioned below, which protects the water- supply. The houses are of sun-dried brick and one-stoned. The population seems to be decreasing, as there are now about 100 unoccupied and ruinous houses. The town is only a small trading and fishing village though at one time it belonged to the Dutch, the remains of whose factory used to be pointed out not many years ago. The fort is square (Lat. of 112 I. B. Q122 BAN—BAN highest tower 30° 3' 14'; Long. 50° 9' 45'). Nine miles south-east—half- ■east of Bandar Dilam—is a small table hill of light colour with nernendicular sides (Lat. 29° 57' 9' 58' ; Long. 50° 17'36'). It is 165 feet high and visible for 14 miles. The coast here is merely a strip of land 10 or 15 feet above the sea, inland of which are swamps extending for miles The anchor age for vessels, about 31 miles off the shore, is sheltered from the shimdl and partially from the kaus ; the bottom is of soft mud and the depth of water 4 fathoms ; native craft lie close to the beach in a creek in a mud flat. Landing is difficult because of the mud, and cargoes are loaded and unloaded by means of donkeys. Population.—The population is from 1,000 to 2,000 souls of the BehbehanI tribe and is entirely Shi’ah ; all are Persian speaking, but about one-third of them can talk Arabic as well. Some are cultivators 4n the surrounding Liravi district ; others sailors or fishermen and the remainder merchants or shop-keepers. Resources and Supplies.—1U resources of the place are inconsiderable Drinking-water is scarce and indifferent; it is brought from Tunub, about 1 mile distant. About 20 horses, 40 mules, 200 donkeys and 500 sheep are owned by the inhabitants. There are 10 bums, 10 mdshuvehs and 20 small fishing boats. Bandar Dilam is the port of the wheat-growing districts of Zaidan and Behbehan, and to this circumstance it owes such trade as it eniovs Theover-sea trade is principally with Bushire, but also, to a limited extent, with Kuwait,^Bahrain, and Masqat.

The present Khans are named Abdul Husain and Abdur Riza. Another account says there are no Khans and that the place is administered by the Customs officials ; the last Khans, named Abdullah and Ja’far, resigned as thev were unable to meet their revenue obligations. The land-revenue of Bandar Dilam is trifling, but the receipts from sea-customs are considerable since the establishment of a post of the Imperial Customs. The Khan formerly farmed the sea-customs for 12,000 hrdns per annum ; since direct management was initiated, he has been receiving compensation at the rate of 5 000 hrdns annually, while the duties collected in 1905 are said to have amounted to 60,000 hrdns. The people of Bandar Dilam are fairly well armed with Martini rifles and revolvers.

Long 49° IP 28'. Elev. A village constituting, with seme square miles of the country round it, a small administrative district in Southern ’Arabistan. Tt is the port of the Jarrahi district and formerly served the Ramuz district also. Posit ion and Boundaries.—The, village of Ma’shur, generally called Bandar, is sit uated about a mile north of the inland termination of the Khur Ma’shur branch of the Khur Musa. According to a local tradition, the original village of Ma’shur was situated at a place called Tall Kafir an, which seems to be on the south-east bank of the Khur Ma’shur, about 3 miles from its head. 1 he limits of the tract dependent on the village are not clearly defined, but they may be taken to include the south-eastern bank of the Khur Ma sour, so far as it consists of terra firma, and the north-western bank down, probably, to the mouth of the Khur Dauracp On the side towards Buzleh the limit of the Ma’shur territory is said to be at a spot called ’Aquleh, about 8 miles from the village. Surroundings and Communications.—The ground to the south of the town, which is mostly impracticable even for men on foot, is included in the de^ sc dpi ion given of Khur Musa ; so also is the only route connecting the village with that inlet fit the point called Sif. A direct route connects Ma’shur with Bn/.Mi by way of ’Aquleh and of either Imamzadeh ’Abdul Hasan or Ramleh. Up to the. border of the Fadahieh district at ’Aquleh, the country is mostly a saline plain with patches of grass which support con siderable flocks of sheep. A route to Fallalifeh town, more northerly and less westerly in its initial stages than the last, strike^ the Jarrahi river at Tuwaiqich ; at 2 miles irc-m Ma’shur this route runs through ground which is intersected by ravines—the beginnings of the hollow which reaches, Khur Ma shur between Ma’shur village and 8if—and would be heavy going after rain ; beyond this point, patches of wheat become frequent, and grass and sprub increase as the Jarrahi is approached. Communications with Ramu^are b} r various paths joining the Fallahieh*Eamzu route, which runs along the bank of the Jarrahi l iver, at cliff L : eiit points. Character of the ; iffnjc.--Ma's! ur village stands upon a mound which has the appearance of being artificial, but in alJ probability consists merely of the accumulated debris of a long inhabited site, A ruined hurj dominates the place, and there are 3 mosques, of which the best was built in the present generation by one Haji Naslr, a merchant of the place. The houses are of the type usual in this part of Persia ; they are of mud with mud roofs and each of them encloses its own courtyard. Around the village, outside, are scattered the roofless mud walls of diminutive huts, which are occupied during the wheat harvest when the grain is heaped up outside the village. Sanitation is disregarded, and drinking water is largely drawn from a stag nant pool, the same as that in which clothes are washed. The atmosphere in summer is said to be very damp and the heat oppressive. Inhabitarts. —The population of Ma’shur village is about 1,500 souls; as a whole the people are healthy and well-favoured in appearance. Half of them are Bandaris or Bandarieh and are said to be connected with the BanI Turuf, but this point is very doubtful and the Bandaris themselves profess ignorance of their origin ; the remainder are described as Qanavatis frem Behbehan. The Bandaris are said to have been the founders of the place and the Qanavatis later immigrants. The entire community is bidingual, speaking both Persian and Arabic ; but anrug themselves the pec pie use a low form of Persian of the Lur type. Their dress is in the main ’Arab in pattern, but it is not free, especially in the case of women, from Persian modifications. Men wear the Arab Kafieh or kerchief, the ’Arab ’Aqul or head fillet and the ’Arab ’Aha or cloak ; underneath the last is a Zabun or long cotton coat reachino- to the heels. Women all wear the ’Aba, their coiffure is ’Arab and the Persian Burqa’ is not seen among them. On the other hand, trousers frequently form a part of their costume, shoes are worm—which are not found among ’Arab women of the lower classes—and as children, they frequently adopt the bandag - round the forehead which is not assumed by ’Arab women until after marriage, Until two generations ago the permanent inhabitants of Ma’shur were all Sunnis, at least so the people themselves aver; now they are all Shi’ahs. Ma’shur is at present the seat of a Mulla named Shaikh Husain, who has considerable local influence and receives Zaqat even from the villages on the Jarralff, His sentiments are believed to be anti-European. The people of Ma’shur are fairly well armed and possess in all about ICO rifles. Agriculture and Livestock. —There are traces of extensive irrigated culti vation to the north and west of Ma’shur village, but the fields have long ceased to ex ; st. The necessary supply of water is said to have been drawn from the Jarrahi by means of a dam at Haddaneh, There is now no irri gation on the north side of Ma’shur, nor is any met with on going westward till the Khatar canal of the S' atul tract is reached near Imamzadeh ’Abdul Hasan in the FalJahleh district. Cultivation is now restricted to 50 or 60 khlsh or ploughs of land in the neighbourhood of the village, on which precarious crops of wheat and barley are grown by rainfall alone. Water-supply and other resources. —Rain-water is collected on the east gide of the town by an embankment faced with brick, built about 10 years126 BAN—BAN ago by the merchant Haji Nasir, before mentioned ; on the open tank thus formed, the people of Ma’shur depend for all purposes during 8 months in the year, and during the remaining 4 months they drink from wells, of which there are many small ones in the town. Th're is also, to the west of the town, an underground cistern which holds excellent water and is also due to the liberality of Haji Nasir ; the entrance is kept locked dur ing the w ; nter. The fact that the livestock of Ma’shur is not sent else where in the hot weather seems to indicate that the water-supply is m no way deficient, but the well-water at least is brackish and unhealthy. Fodder is brought from the Jarrahi and Hindian districts, and fuel consisting of small bushes only, is mostly cut within a radius of 10 miles of the village on its east and west sides. The prices of ordinary supplies frequently range high in Ma’shur. In March 1006, the rate for wheat was 23 to 27 ftrdws, and for barley 14 hrdns per local Hashim man of 248 lbs. English. Fish and excellent prawns are caught at Zan&lt;d and the rate for the latter, at the time just mentioned, was 1 krdn per Bushire man of 7;| lbs. if dried, and 8 krdns if cleaned. Trade .—The rise of Nasiri on the Karun river has adversely affected Ma’shur, and has taken from it the greater part even of the Rarnuz export trade, of which it had formerly a monopoly. The staple export is wheat, but the quantity available varies greatly, as elsewhere in ’Arabistan, from season to season. There is also some exportation of barley. In a good year the amount of wheat passing through the port may amount to COO, and that of barley to 50, local kd^ehx. From 20,000 to 30,000 fleeces of wool, valued at from 15 to 26 tumdns the hundred, are exported in each year. Some beans, sesame, and oak-bark also are shipped from Ma’shur, but it is stated that gum arabic and linseed no longer follow this route as formerly. ^ Imports, which are mostly of Indian origin, are received through Kuwait, Bushire and Muhammareh. The chief articles imported are qand or loaf suuar, about 200 cases a year; shakkar or granulated sugar, about 300 bags per annum ; also piece-goods, tea and spices, dhe piece-goods are mostly from Muhammareb. The prices of imported goods depend on the prices at Bushire and are greater by the amount of freight and other transit charges and bv the commission of the local merchant, which is at the rate of 5 to 10 per cent. The price of qand is thus 8 to 10 tumdns for a case containing 32 to 36 cones. There are only 2 merchants of consideration at Ma’shur. Both are Beh- behanis by origin and both have now their head-quarters at Kuwait. There is no bazar at Ma’shur and all business is transacted in private houses. The weights in use at Ma’shur are the following 1 waqieh — 1 Bushire man or 13 =1 Khalafabad man or 32 „ =1 Hashim man or 100 Hashim mans = 1 Kareh or 24,800 „ ,, The waqieh is divided into rub’ or quarters, and nim or halves. The unit of linear measure is the zar’-i-shdh of the Persian coast. Port and dipping.—The creek has banks of shelving mud, and at low tide holds 3 feet of water with a width of 15 feet. On high tides it is some 7f lbs. English. 124 „ „ 24850 feet wide. The landing-place for goods is more than 2 miles from the village, and the path connecting the two'becomes difficult in bad weather. Only about 10 trading boats are owned at Ma’shur and 4 fishing boats of size : of the former class 5, belonging to one owner, are capable of making voyages to Kuwait and even to Masqat. Numerous vessels from other ports call at Ma’shur, and in a year of large wheat export as many as 000 visits may be paid by strange craft : these are mostly Mdshuwehs, Ghunchehs and Baqdrehs, but sometimes they are Mkms and occasionally Baghalehs. All vessels must sailor drift up Khur Musa to Ma’shur as, from the nature of the banks, there is no possibility of towing them. The journey from Ma’shur to Kuwait by sailing vessel ordinarily occupies about 24 hours, but in favourable circumstances it may be performed in half that time. About 24 hours is the time usually required to reach Fallahleh town from Ma’shur by water via Khur Ma’shur and Khur Dauraq. From the Ma’shur landing-place west to the Dauraq canal the sea is reported to be unapproachable, the shore along the north being low and swampy and flooded by tides far inland. Government .—Ma’shur is understood to be the joint property of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh and the Mashir-ud-Dauleh, having been obtained by the former from the Persian Government as a tiyul in 1895. It is farmed from the owners by the Shaikh of Muhammareh, but the terms of the lease are not at present ascertainable. The local authority until about 8 years ago was a certain Mir ’Abdullah, belonging to a tribe or family called Amareh of Khalafabad ; and to him belonged the ruined fort which is still visible at Ma’shur. In the time of Mir ’Abdullah the Shaikh of Muhammareh had not perhaps obtained the farm of the revenues of Ma’shur, for they were then .. paid into the treasury at Shushtar. Four or five years ago Mir ’Abdullah died, having been held in imprison ment for the last 3 or 4 years of his life by the Shaikh of Muhammareh, whose displeasure he had incurred. Since this event the influence of the Shaikh at Ma’shur has become supreme and undisputed, and he has been represented locally by a confidential agent named Shaikh Salaiyeh, who was at one time among his personal attendants, and whose position and powers as regards Ma’shur as well as the Hindlan district, also con trolled by him, appear to be indefinite. The Shaikh of Muhammareh is exceedingly feared at Ma’shur, but there, as elsewhere in Southern ’Arabistan, he seems to be regarded as a just man. The only agricultural tax is one on land actually cultivated at the rate of 110 krdns per khish, but the Shaikh also recovers one chcJidraik per man (or the monetary equivalent) on the flesh of every animal slaughtered for food ; and there is reason to believe, though every effort is made to conceal the fact, that he collects an excise of 2 tumdns on every hundred fleeces exported from Ma’shur. The customs of Ma’shur before their transfer to the Imperial Persian „ Customs Department were valued at 6,000 tumdns per annum ; no proper estimate of their yield under the new regime can be framed, but it is said to amount to 20,000 tumdns yearly. There is no telegraph office. A post office managed by the customs exists, however, and a weekly service to Muhammareh, Hindlan, and Bushire is maintained.— {Burton, 1903— Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)128 BAN—BAN BANDAR NASIRl or NASIRIEH—Lat. 3ri9' N. Long. 48°45 30° E. A small but flourishing town in Southern ’Arabistan, which has sprung up since the opening of the Karun river to steam navigation. It is situated on the left bank of the river Karun immediately below the Ahwaz rapids, and about 1 mile from Ahwaz town. It stands upon a slight elevation overlooking the river, and (1905) contains 118 houses of stone, brick, and mud, two caravanserai*, two public baths, two mosques,196 shops, of which 106 are occupied, and two coffee-shops. The importance of Bandar Nasiri which, after Muhammareh, is the chief place on the river Karun below its junction with the river Diz, depends partly on its being the chief place in the Ahwaz district and the seat of the Shaikh of Muhammareh’s Governor, but still more upon its favourable situation in regard to trade. The run of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s steamer on the Karun ends at Bandar Nasiri, and the cargoes for the Upper Karun are here discharged and conveyed by a tram-line, the property ofthe Mu’in-ut-Tujjar, to a point 1 mile above Ahwaz town, where they are re-shipped, mostly for Shushtar. * There is a weekly post from Bandar Nasirito Shushtar and Muhammareh, with both of which places, as also with Ramuz, the town has telegraphic connection. . . _t#t- j Bandar Nasiri is, moreover, the starting point of the Ahwaz-lsfahan road, which traverses the Bakhtiari country, and is the route followed by a steadily increasing caravan trade. The town is also a centre for local trade, and much grain for export changes hands in this place. The population of about 1,500 souls is mixed and consists of Shflshtaris, Dizfulis and Arabs. NIsiri-Ahwaz (tramway line) General description—The total length of the line is about 2,500 yards, gauge 3 feet. Starting at the wharf on the south of the Customs build ings used by the “ Nasrat,” for about 150 yards it lies along a narrow lane cutting the Mu’m-ut-Tujjar’s Bazar at right angles. Emerging, it turns off at an obtuse angle to the left. » From this point it proceeds along the front line of Nasiri houses, the ground on the left being open. Leaving Nasiri it proceeds over open country till Ahwaz is reached. Ahwaz lies on its left, i.e., western side. After the preliminary turn the course is straight till a point level with the middle of Ahwaz. Here it bends again slightly to the left, and there are two or three buildings here on its right or east side. About 100 yards short of the Shushan mooring place, where it termi nates, it crosses a small culvert and is further deflected to the left. The following are its chief features : At Nasiri, its terminus and the first 100 yards of its course are hemmed in by buildings and there is little free space. From here for about 600 yards it lies in an almost continuous cutting 2 to 4 feet deep, which becomes a flowing stream in heavy rain. Loading here could be carried on from either side of the line.112 LB. It then crosses a depression by a revetted embankment and two culverts about 8 or 9 feet high. After this cutting through a narrow ridge, it proceeds on a continuous earth embankment varying from 8 to 2 feet till the bend at Ahwaz is reached, only at one point striking the level of the soil. At various points the surrounding country is liable to be submerged by standing water after heavy rain. It then continues on the ground level till the last culvert is crossed when it is carried on an embankment to the bank just below the Shushan. Cargo has to be loaded and discharged on the right side, where ground is confined by a garden enclosure. There is a steep descent to the water s edge. The track—The rails are iron of r -^ ^ section, and are laid on small crooked wooden sleepers made of wood from the Diz Itiver. There is no ballasting and these sleepers are usually exposed, giving a very rough surface for the horses, which, however, with practice become very expert in keeping their feet. The rails have been laid too close, head to head, and with the expansion caused by heat in summer the)* sometimes buckle and become displaced. The line exhibits minor irregularities in level, straightness, and gauge. The general alignment is however level and no brakes are necessary. Rolling stock, etc—There are at present two old and two new trolleys, four more new trolleys are being put together at Muhammctieh. The trolleys have a carrying surface of about 6' 8' X i 7 9 7/ . Load, 4 to 2 tons per trolley in good weather. Each trolley drawn by one horse. At present there are six horses. Extension.— It is not stated in what direction extension would be con templated. The ground is generally well adapted. No difficulties would be met with up the river, till the Gargar is reached at Band-i-Qir. . , . , l ust beyond Ahwaz there is some elevated ground which would require negotiation, or the application of brakes which the present trolleys do not ^The line could be carried to Ramuzby the route via Raghaiweh followed by the oil carts, though the sand hills between Linhairi and Raghaiweh would probably give trouble. . . . +1, m- ^ Down the river there is no obstacle, as far as is known, until the Mand, 10 miles above Muhammareh is reached. In the lower section of this route continuous embankment would probably be necessary.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1 908 - Aonmer.) BANDAR RIG-Lat. 29° 24/ N. Long. 50° 41 7 E. Elev. The port and chief town of the Haiat Daud district of Ears ; it is situated on the coast 30 miles north-north-west of Bushire town and 156 miles due ea Banda^ Kg^tands upon a low, sandy coast which runs north and south ; there is a creek at the town fronted by two sandy islets or banks, inside which native boats lie aground at low water. On the north and south the130 BAN-BAN town is adjoined by cultivated lands belonging to adjacent villages, and on the east at about 2 miles distance is a chain of low sand-hills, which screen it from the view of the traveller as he approaches on that side. The only defensive work is the loopholed, semi-fortified residence of the Khan built of stones and mud. Bandar Rig possesses a few date trees, and there are two unimportant shrines. The general history of Bandar Rig is included in that of the Haiat Daud district. Here in 1754 the English East Company, whose trade in the Gulf had been seriously crippled by the troubles arising out of the Afghan in vasions, endeavoured to found a factory and sent out an agent. Owing to Dutch opposition and intrigues, the attempt was a failure, and a few years later Bushire was selected as a substitute. A little later in the same cen tury a famous Gulf pirate, an exceptional ruffian, of the name of Mir Mahanna, had his strong hold here. His fort was taken and razed to the ground by British troops. Bandar Rig is said to be very ancient. Population. —The inhabitants number about 2,500 souls ; they are a mongrel breed in whom Arab and Lur blood predominate. Persian, modi fied by the Lur dialect, is the language spoken. The people are cultivators, boatmen, sailors and traders ; they are reputed peaceable and not fana tical, but they are fairly well armed with Martini rifles, about 3 to every house. They are Shi’ah Muhammadans, but traditions survive of a time when some of them were Gabrs. Trade and Supples.—Bandar Rig is a fairly prosperous port, dealing principally with Bushire and Kuwait, and serving the considerable district of Haiat Daud, and a part of the district of Shabankareh. The bazar contains about 50 shops and trade has increased during the last few years ; the monthly imports are said now to average 100 packages or bags of sugar, 5 cases of tea, 50 bags of Indian rice, 100 cases of kerosine oil, and 50 bales of Manchester prints, all from Bushire. There is also a considerable im portation of camels from Kuwait. Exports are wheat, barley, gum, wool and cattle, all to Bushire except the wheat, of which the bulk is sent to Kuwait, Bahrain and Masqat. The Persian krdn is the basis of the currency, but rupees and dollars also circulate. The unit of weight is a Hashim man equal to 20 Tabriz man of Bushire, and consequently different to the Hashim man of that place, which is equivalent to 16 Tabriz man of the same town. The standard of length is a gaz of 8| inches. Resources and Communications. —Water is obtained from wells, and som3 wheat, barley and straw are locally procurable. About 50 horses, 100 camels and 150 donkeys, also 100 cattle and 600 sheep and goats are owned in the town, and there are 8 bums besides 10 mdshuvehs and 15 fishing boats. A Persian post office was opened here about 1901, and a telegraph office about 1904 ; but very little use is made of the latter, which is intermediate between Borazjun and Bandar Dilam on the Borazjun Ahwaz branch line. There is frequent communication with Bushire by sailing boat. There is a .route to Borazjun of 2 stages, 56 miles. The main route from Bushire to Muhammareh via Bandar Dilam passes Bandar Rig, Bushire being 3 stages of 74 miles, Bandar Dilam 3 stages, 60 miles, and Muhammareh 8 stages, 190 miles.&amp; BAN—BAN 131 Administration. —Bandar Rig is the residence of Haidar Khan, the heie- ditary local Government of the Haiat Baud district.

It was built on one of four ledges of sandstone, which cross the river at this point for the purpose of keeping up the water to fill the canals for irrigation purposes. At the west end of it is an opening of about 40 yards broad, and through this (with the'exception of the water which finds its way over the small p iaces where the dam is worn by time or broken away), the whole of the river, here about 200 yards broad, rushes with a tremendous fall and velocity. This dam stayed the further course of the Euphrates, one gamers of Colonel Chesney’s expedition in 1836, but m March 184^ Lieutenan Selby of the Indian Navy, in the Assyria, passed safely through and pro ceeded up the river to within a few miles of Shushtar.

Bell says the river here is from 200 to 300 feet wide, and from bank to bank 300 to 600 yards wide, with the banks 20 feet high. The land-revenue of the village was farmed for 1,500 Tcrdns in 1904. Band-i-QIr sends most of its produce to Bandar Naslrl and receives most of its imports from Shhshtar. It is surrounded by the ruins of the old city of Lashkar or ’Askar-i-Mukram. The name Band-i-Qir is derived from a dyke whose stones were fastened together by “ qlr ”, i.e., bitumen. This dyke is said to have been made by Darius.

The number of fighting men of the tribe in Arabistan is thus approxi mately 8,000 including those of the tribe in ’Iraq, the fighting strength of the whole tribe is probably about 15,000 men and their total number 45,000 souls. _ . . Mode of life and resources—The majority of all sections of the tribe are agricultural and live by growing cereals. The tribe has not, however, as a whole abandoned a nomadic life for no houses are found among them, but only hair tents, and they migrate towards the hills in the cold weather and are on the move from February to June. ^ Wheat, barley, oats, maize, mash and lentils are among their crops, but they have not much rice; their cultivation is shifting and desultory. The camels and horses of the Bani Lam are among the best m Iraq, iney have also buffaloes, cattle, sheep and donkeys. The horses possessed by the portion of the tribe which lives in ’Arabistan are estimated at 1,500 and their camels at 3,000. ? Political position and military importance.—The tribe are with a few exceptions Shi’ahs ; by some of them Persian is spoken as well as Arabic. Blood feuds are rigorously prosecuted. The tribe are blindly submissive to their Shaikhs both in peace and war, and they do not fail to combine against outsiders. Their present head is Ghadhban. In Persia the tribe give much trouble to the authorities and seldom pay any revenue. The tribe are noted for their predatory tendencies, but in reality they live for the greater par a peaceful and respectable life. In Persia it is the Khasra] that give the most trouble, and the Kinanah also are said to raid in the Dizful district. The Bani Lam are now well supplied with modern rifles, chiefly Martinis, and are considered to be good shots, especially from the saddle. It is estimated that on the Persianside about one-third of the dg^ngmen are mounted and two-thirds are armed with rifles—(Pemaw Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BAN!

Long. 47° 35' E. Elev. 2,950'. The name of a cultivated valley constituting the uppermost part of the Rudbar district of Luristan, and of a camp of the Lurs containing some 50 huts, situated above the valley. The camp lies 99 miles west of Khurram- abad on the road to Deh Bala. The valley lies along the right bank of the Saimarreh river just where it issues from the Saza-Bin gorge. There is a large area of richly cultivated and irrigated lands. Large flocks and herds are owned. The Saimarreh river is here fordable at some points. Banlshan lies within the territory of the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh.— (Burton.) BANI TAMlM (1)— A division of the Bani Hardan tribe BANI TAMlM (2) (Tribe)— A large and powerful Arab tribe in Southern ’Arabistan. They are tent- dwellers, and range the drier parts of the country between the rivers Karun, Shatt-al-’Arab and Tigris. Unlike most of the tribes of the province, in religion they are Sunni Muhammadans, and in their mode of life also they differ considerably from the other Arab tribes of ’Arabistan. They are said to be of Muntafik extraction. Their territory in Southern Arabistan includes the right bank of the river Karun between Milaihan and Sab eh, and they may be found anywhere to the west of that line up to the Turkish frontier. In summer the bulk of the tribe approach the Karun ; in the date seasonban-ban 139 they encamp on the left bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab between Nashveh and D’aiji, where many of them own date plantations ; in winter and spring they occupy the western end of their country, but a few of the ’Ayaisheh section sometimes encamp and cultivate in the cold weather at Maqtu, and others more regularly appear at Qajarieh. There is no estimate of their numbers by sections, but their strength is reckoned at 1,000 unmounted and 2,000 mounted men, part of the latter being camel-riders and their total number maybe about 10,000. They own some 2,500 camels, 1,400 horses and large numbers of donkeys, cattle and sheep. They also cultivate wheat and barley, and when in Southern ’Arabistan they pay revenue to the Shaikh of Muhammareh at the rate of 10 brans per cultivated Fadddn, as well as one-fourth of the actual gross produce. Their divisions are the Bani Malik, to whom belong the members of ruling family; the Bani Nahad ; Hamud ; Bani Sakain ; Ghizli ; Ghazaiwi ; Ghizzi; Baraji’eh ; Sulaiman ; ’Ayaisheh ; Halaf; ’Awainat; and Hamid. The correspondence of some of these names with those of sections of the Bani Saleh will be observed. The Bani Tamim are now all enrolled in the A1 Bu Kasib section of the Muhaisin. The ’Awainat and ’Ayaisheh sections have been so affiliated to the Muhaisin for some years.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BANI TURUF (Tribe)— A large and powerful tribe in the Hawizeh district of Southern ’Arabistan, numbering some 20,000 souls and occupying the whole of the country watered by the river Karkheli below Kut Nahr Hashim, including the marshes. The seat of the ruling family who belong to the A1 Bu ’Azar is at Khafaji’eh on the left bank of the main stream, several hours to the west of Kut N;;hr Hashim where there is a bazar of about 90 mud-built shops. The Bani Turuf are Shi’als and live in hats m:df of mats, reeds and grass. They subsist chiefly by agriculture, but are also stock-breeders ; rice is their staple crop ; some wheat and barley also are cultivated by them, and they are said to own 20,000 head of buffaloes and cattle but no sheep. They exp ort large quantities of rice and hides to ’Amareh ma Hawizeh and send glii by direct caravan to Muhammareh and Basrah. Piece-goods, sugar, coffee, etc., they obtain principally from ’Amareh ; but the tobacco comes from Shushtar. The Bani Turuf fall into two main divisions, the Bait Sa’id and the Bait Saiyah of which the sub-divisions are given below in tabular form. Altogether the Bani Turuf can muster about 5,650 fighting men, with nearly 4,000 rifles ; but only some 50 men altogether belonging to the families of the Shaikhs are mounted. McDouall (1905) says that they only muster 3,500 actually resident, but that with their kinsmen from Turkish terri tory their numbers increase to 7,000.

From the names of the sections, it may be conjectured that the Banf Turuf are largely composed of fragments detached from other tribes in &gt; Arabist an and Turkish ’Iraq ; but it should be added that the information obtained above of this tribe is not of a very clear or satisfactory kind. The Bani Turuf have from time to time resisted the authority of the Shaikh of Muhammareh in the Hawizeh district, but without much success. They are generally characterised as thieves and robbers. ban! YAKl— Lat. 30° 6' N. Long. 52° 46' 30' E. Elev. A village of 15 houses, 12 miles north of Fathabad on the Shiraz-Asupas road.

The approaches , to it are three in number, viz. :— Approaches. ls£.—The pass to the north (height 2,450 feet), beyond which roads bifurcate to Lar, Furg and Bandar Abbas. 2rwZ.—The two roads from Lingeh via Champeh and Juneh which unite at Utari caravanserai. 3rd. —The road from Ishkanan, 13 farsakhs distant. The first of these is 4J miles north-east of the town. At that point the valley, gradually ascending, grows narrower and narrower, until it ter minates abruptly at the summit of the pass in a precipitous fall of about 100 feet. Right and left rise lofty mountains untumable for miles. Down the face of this fall the road from Bastak descends steeply by a zig zag track, and then, still descending, goes along a narrow valley, which is looked into from the termination of the plain above and the heights on either side. An enemy assailing the position would have to advance on a narrow front for at least 1,200 yards, and finally under a fire to which, from its elevation, he would be unable to reply effectively, ascend the zigzag track, and carry the position. On this account, whenever Bastak has been invaded from the north, it has always been via Ishkanan, in which direction the ground is more open. The detour that has to be made is great, and ample time is consequently given to make preparations for resistance in that direction. From the south the best route would be via Kalas and on up the Bastak river. There is said to be a foot-path from Kalas to Bastak, and another one thence across the Kuh-i-Gavbus to Fathura. The inhabitants are Sunnis and are, generally speaking, a fine and hardy T , ,. , race of mountaineers, naturally war- Inhabitants. ... ... £ i - v like.

They are siinilar in construction to those seen in many parts of India, two pillars being built over the mouth, which support a cross-beam with pulleys, through which ropes run, which are attached to bullocks, who, walking down a steep incline, draw the water up in leather bags. There are probably as many small, round wells again. Most of them are revetted. There are at least 29 domed tanks (birJcehs) varying in diameter from 17 to 30 feet, and in depth from 15 to 25. The water is good. Firewood is obtained from the Gavbus range to the north-west of the town, where there is said to be a well-wooded plateau, which also affords excellent grazing. There is also good grazing near the town, and between it and Janeh. The district contains 15,000 inhabitants and is said to be able to Di?trict muster 3,000 fighting men—the town of Bastak alone supplying 800 of these. Wheat and barley form the bulk of the crops, the harvest for the former being in April. There are also large date plantations, which extend to the west of the town for a distance of 2| miles. Cattle, sheep and goats are scarce. The mdlidt is 40,000 rupees, and is paid to Ldv.—(Vaughan, April 1890.) BASTAK DISTRICT— A Persian district belonging to the Laristan division of the province of Fars; the town of Bastak, from which the district takes its name, is situated at least 40 (?) miles from the nearest point on the sea-coast, and not less than 60 (?) miles north-west of the town of Lingeh. Bastak has never theless an indirect connection with the Persian Gulf, and is held, in a sense, to extend to the shore of the Gulf on both sides of the Lingeh district. To the west of the Lingeh district the revenue of the villages of Charak and Tavaneh in Shib Kuh and part of Dunwan in Lingeh, for all of which the Shaikh of Charak is responsible, and similarly the revenue of the villages of Mughu and Haslneh in Shib Kuh and of part of Bust&amp;neh in Lingeh, collected by the Shaikh of Mughu, have now for some time been payable to the Governor of Bastak. To the east of the Lingeh district again, the town of Khamir, together with the coast from the border of the Lingeh dis trict at Pul-ghar to the frontier of the Khamir district at the mouth of the Rud-i-Kul, is recognised as belonging geographically to Bastak. This re cognition, however, is of no practical significance, for Khamir, the only place of importance, is actually subject, for administrative purposes, to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, while its revenues are farmed by the Mu’in ut-Tujjar of Tehran : the locus standi of the Governor of Bastak in relation to this part of his territories is consequently difficult to understand. The coast of the district from Pul Ghar to the mouth of the Rud-i-Kul is about 34 miles in extent; its average direction is from west-south-west to east-north-east, and it forms the north shore of Clarence Strait between T 2148 BAS—BAS Qishm Island and the main la nd ; it is a low coast, and the greater part of it has not as yet been satisfactorily examined. The village of Khamir, situated 14 or 15 miles west of the Kud-i-Kul, divides the coast into two portions, of which the western appears to be the exit of a great valley from the west, possibly of the long trough which lies behind the maritime range of the ShibKuh and Lingeh districts, and contains Galleh-Dar, Ishkanan and Tara- kimeh. Off this part of the coast line lie miles of swamp, from which most of the firewood used in the lower part of the Gulf is obtained ; the marshes are intersected by numerous creeks, difficult of passage except for ; small boats. , t. The maritime range which forms the northern boundary of the Lingeh district and which has already been described in the articles on that dis trict and on Shib Kuh, encloses this part of Bastak on the south ; and the district appears to be intersected by a higher range, similar in direction, which leaves the coast at Khamir village. This last range has two principal ; summits near Khamir; one, which is 9 miles north-east of the village and even nearer the coast, is 3,700 feet high and another, 12 miles north- . west of Khamir, is even loftier but is less bold in outline. From the higher peak a spur runs off south-eastwards in the direction of Khamir ; its foot hills contain deposits of sulphur.

A fertile valley in Luristan, south of the Kaleh Kuh range, and situated on the Kakulistan, or Baznui branch of the Ab-i-Diz. It is inhabited by the ZallakI section of the Bakhtiari tribe, and is a remarkably pretty and well cared for spot. A stone fort in the middle of an open space, 1 mile in extent along one of the bends of the rivers, and pushing its way up two well-wooded ravines lying close together, is surrounded by a number of flat terraces, each large enough to contain an tlldt family or small gtoup, and each separated by a screen of fruit and other trees, giving shelter from wind and sun. These rows and cross-rows of trees, in which fig, pome granate, walnut, and poplar are seen, all stand by small rivulets of their own, and give the whole valley a remarkably well cared for appearance. It is the chief and winter resident of the ZallakI tribe. From June to August it is, on account of its low altitude of only 5,000 feet, disagreeably warm to those to whom the height of T000 feet to 10.000 feet is accessible in a few hours’ ride, but it would be considered cool by all whose lot it is to summer in the plains of India. Show occasionally falls in the valley, but does not lie. and in the autumn, winter, and spring it is said to be a charming resi dence. That it must have been considered so from time immemorial is evidenced by many things, especially by the remains of What must have been an exceedingly fine piece of architectural workmanship in the form of a stone bridge, and*by the roads leading to it from all directions. The foun dations of the bridge are still standing in perfect condition. Built at a spot where the stream, 70 feet wide, rushes between good rock banks, these foundations are 72 feet apart, their river front is 30 feet, and their depth (built up against the rock) varies from 6 to 20 feet—constructed of stone and hard mortar faced by large stones cut exactly to the same size (about 16 ,, x20 // ), regularly fitted, and joining in a fashion which would be credit able to the best workmanship of the present day. On these two well- preserved foundationsj rising 20 feet above the low level of the fiverj now stand only the remains of what were once the buttresses of a centre arch of a 72-foot span, connected to the steep bank on either _ side by smaller arches of 20 to 30 feet span, traces of the bank ends being still visible. These remains, still 12 feet high, 25 feet wide, and 10 to 15 feet thick, built of stone and mortar, having lost the outer casing of cut stone, are now yearly becoming smaller, touched up by the weather, and encroached upon on one side by the wood and wicker work bridge now joining the two banks. Whatever form the original stone arch may have had,, it must have taken the road level at least 70 feet above the water, and made it an easy and comfortable approach. Whoever the original builders were, the remains shew they possessed a good knowledge of building, and that this passage must have been one of importance to them. Roads lead up the river-bed to it from Dizful to either bank, though now and then they have to ascend a high spur, where the river passes through a steeply cut defile. These roads continue on either bank above the bridge and lead to the Gokun valley, and the two passes leading into the Upper Bakhtiari QQ-^^ytry namely, the Bard-i-Afir Jamal and. tne Ual-i-Grav , but the mam road to the latter pass, after leaving the bridge, follows the watershed of a low range of hills, really a long spur from the Kuh-i-Rang, known as Chin-i-Kavar. -{Sawyer, 1890.| 112 1.

The most important of the tributaries of the Karun river into which it flows some 10 miles below the Pul-i-’Amarat. This river, which, at the point where they meet, has as great a volume as the Karun itself, rises in close proximity to the sources' of the latter. The various streams or springs, from which the Bazuft has its origin, are the Ab-i-Susan, Ab-i-Taraz-Mauri, the several Chashmeh-i-Liiki Khan! Khan-Kushteh, Haft Tanan and Gilishah : all of these flowing down the southern or western slopes of the watersheds of the mountains from which they take their name. These unite in a main stream, after courses varying from 20 to 40 miles, at a point about 5,500 feet above sea-level. After a run of a further 25 miles, during which many small streams join it, Kaleh Bazuft (5,300 feet), an old ruined fort on the right bank, is reached. The river is still fordable here. Passing then below the Gardan-i-Chari and joined by the waters of the Ab-i-Masi and Ab-i-Muvarz, it pursues its course past the overhanging Kuh i-Isbianeh, and receives several additional streams from the Gurab valley. At 70 miles it makes the only considerable bend of its whole course, to clear the elbow of the mighty Garreh range, again resuming its normal and almost straight course south-east, and running through the deep valley between that range and the abrupt slopes of the Kuh-i-Balut and Kuh-i-Malvarl. Below the latter it is crossed by the Pul-i-’Amarat (for description see this Gazetteer, Pul-i- ’Amarat), on the caravan road between Isfahan and Nasiri, at 120 miles from the former, and at 3,400 feet elevation. The bridge is a wire suspension bridge, built in 1900 by Messrs. Lynch Brothers for the Bakhtiari Khans. It is a neat structure, &lt;0 feet in length, supported by solid masonry piers and a lattice girder, with steel roadway and concrete flooring, 10 feet in width. It is laid about 160 feet above the level of the water ; and kept in good order by regularly applied coats of paint. The caravanserai at Shalil lies about U miles distant from the bridge and the left bank. Up to this point the valleys through wh ch the river has run are practically distitute of villages, though it is said to have contained some 360 in the olden days ^^e^ Afghan incursion. Just below the bridge it is joined by the Ab-i-k haul, a fair sized stream just fordable in parts. After a further course of some 12 miles, with a few hamlets on either bank, and a ford just above the village of Raval, it plunges into the Karun near the village of Charkak, elevation 3,050 feet.

It is bounded on the north by the mountains which separate ’Iraq-i-’AjamI fromthe southern provinces of Persia ; east by Shulistan ; south by the Persian Gulf; west by ’Arabistan. The soil, par ticularly in the plain, is a rich alluvial deposit, yielding in the neighbour hood of the town a return of twenty-four fold of corn. Near the Gulf, cotton and rice are the staple productions. Among the fruit-trees are the lemon, orange, pomegranate, and plum ; of these the last takes precedence. The whole district is watered by numerous streams, the principal being the ShamsI, ’Arab, Khanabad, and Marun.

Elev. 1,300'. A town in Ears and the capital of the administrative division of the same name. It is situated 128 miles west-north-west of Shiraz and 43 miles north-north-east of Bandar Dilam, in an extensive plain watered by the Kurdistan or Marun river, from the banks of which it lies 3 milesj south. The town is some 3| miles in circumference, and is surrounded by a mud wall flanked with circular towers and Town - ' bastions. The south-east corner is occupied by a castle called Kaleh Naranj. It is a place of no great strength, but has thick and lofty mud walls surrounded by a ditch. Its interior is small and confined and not capable of containing any number of troops. It is defended by 5 or 6 rusty cannons and might succesfully resist the attack of undisciplined troops. None of these defences are mentioned by U 2.156 BEH—BEH Gabriel, 1905. There are no pretentious houses, and the town is mostly in ruins and wears a dilapidated and poverty-stricken appearance. The streets are filthy with heaps of offal lying about, and there is no bazar worthy of the name. The local officials claim the population to number 30,000, but this is # clearly an over calculation. Probably opu a ion. 6,000 to 8,000 is a truer estimate. In the town there are two parties, the Behb eh Inis and the Qanawatis, in the proportion of £ of the former to § of the latter. The Qanawat tribe origin ally came from Kufa in the Turkish district. The Behbehanis are neither Per^ sians nor Arabs, but a kind of mixture of the two. The chief man among the Behbehanis is (1903) Muhamm?d Mu’m-ul-Islam, who was formerly «xaminer in Persian and Arabic at Bombay for 10 years. He has a cousin called Saiyid Muntazir w T ho has a trade connection with Bombay, and is said to be friendly to the English. Behbehan is an important town, however, being a concentrating and distributing centre for the caravan Trade and resources. trade of the surrounding district. Owing to the lack of a proper bazar supplies of grain are, as a rule, scanty in the town. The Behbehan plain provides grazing for some 3,000 sheep and cattle, and, except in years of drought, wheat is obtainable in the neighbourhood in large quantities. This is the principal article of export, Bhusa also is obtainable in practically unlimited quantities. The water* (supply under present conditions is meagre and bad, being supplied by a small drain which also forms the favourite washing-place of the population. Drinking water is stored in db-ambdrs, and is brought from a distance of 6 miles. There are three tanks here measuring 50' X 20' x 6' of covered masonry. Under a more energetic regime the town might be well supplied by qandts from the Marun river. Owing to the extensive caravan traffic, of which Behbehan is the centre, transport is generally available ; 2,500 good mules could probably be collected without much difficulty. Donkeys and cows 10,000, horses 500, sheep 8,000. There are 300 to 400 mules of all descriptions working on the Bandar Dllam road from here.

A Bakhtiari village, on the right bank of the stream of the same name situated on a small level plain at the south exit of the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash. A bridge of one pointed arch with a 30-foot span, made of stone and mortar, crosses the stream just above the village. It is sometimes made the intermediate stage between Kharaji (16 miles) and Du Pulan (8 miles) in preference to Ardal by caravans on the Isfahan-Nasiri road, when the route by the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash is utilised. Population 6t)0. Supplies fair. Water abundant and good.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.) BEHISHTABAD (AB-I-)— In the Bakhtiari country. This stream is considered to be one of the main sources of the Karim river. It represents the drainage of the whole of the Chehar-Mahal and has itself three principal sources. These are the Ab-i- Junaqan, the Ab-i-Jehan Bin and the Ab-i-Shalamzar. The first named rises in the mountains enclosing the western extremity of the Chehar-Mahal, and runs an east by south-easterly course of some 30 miles. The second has its origin in the range in continuation of the Kuh-i-Rukh, and waters many of the chief villages of the plateau, such as Zanian, Deh-i-Kurd, Shamsabad and Kharaji. It winds across the level plain until it enters the Tang-i-Kha- raji where it is crossed by a well-built brick bridge with a ten-foot roadway and a fifty-foot span, 2 miles before reaching the village of that name. A second similar bridge, somewhat narrower, crosses it at the south end of the village. To the last named place its course is south by south-east and thence south-west; its total run being about 50 miles before its junction with the third, the Ab-i-Shalamzar, some 8 miles south-west of Kharaji. It is crossed by a third well-built masonry bridge imediately before the junction. The third source rises in the eastern extremity of the Zirreh range, and not far from Cbigha Khur. It runs a north-westerly course of some 25 miles through the villages of Shalamzar—where it is bridged by a narrow brick Structure—and Dastaneh before mixing with the Ab-i-Jehan Bin. These two streams, after uniting, run a further course of 8 miles before reaching the Ab-i-Junaqan in the early portion of the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash. The Stream thus formed, and which is just barely fordable at this point, now cuts its way almost due south through this remarkable gorge (vide Gazet te er-Tang-i-Darkash Warkash), and becomes a rushing torrent by a fall of some 600 feet within the next 6 miles. It then issues from the gorge and passes under the bridge at Bffiishtabad. This structure is of stone and mortar, of one pointed arch with a 30-foot span. Its roadway is158 BEH—BIA not wide enough for any kind of cart, but the gorge is quite strong enough to permit of a wider superstructure of wood or other material. After a further course of 2 miles, or in its longest branch of some 70 miles in all— it runs into the Kuh-i-Rang source of the Karun river. —(Arbuthnot, 1905). BEHMAN YAJRl— Lat. 29° 48' N.

The. population is from 150 to 200.— (Vaughan, 1890.) BORAZJUN— Lat. 29° 16' N. Long. 51° 15' E. Elev. 250'. The principal place in the Dashtistan district of Ears, and the seat of the Khan who, under the Governor of Pars, rules the greater part of that district. Borazjun is situated about 28 miles north-east of Bushire town. General description. —Borazjun stands on the plain of Dashtistan, at an elevation of 250 feet above the sea and dominated by the lofty crests of the Gisakau Mountain, less than 10 miles to the eastward ; it is surrounded by date groves which are most extensive upon the west side. The ordinary houses are poor, but there is a fine stone-built serai with loopholed walls, commanding the town and capable of being utilised as a fort; it was in fact in 1906 occupied by a Persian military detachment, and high Persian officials passing through Borazjun treat it as a residence. The town is not a place of strength, being commanded by hills from the east, which would be the best direction from which to approach. The town contains several religious shrines of slight importance. Population. —The village sufieredterribly in a famine some years ago and 75 per cent, of the inhabitants are said to have fallen victims to it. Curzon in 1885 estimated the population at 6,000, and at the present time (1905) the town contains about 500 houses and the population may be 2,500 souls. The people are mostly cultivators, traders and muleteers. The only prominent tribes are the Pap aria, who have dominated the place since they expelled the original bag-owners less than a century ago ; the Qaidan, also comparatively recent immigrants from other places ; and some Saiyids. The remainder of the townspeople are a medley of immi grants from other places, such as Bushiris, Dashtis, Khistis and Kazarunis. The standard of civilization is higher at Borazj un than is usual in the coast districts about Bushire, but the inhabitants avoid needless display of well being and even allow their houses to remain unrepaired, lest the Persian Government should be tempted to quarter a high official permanently among them ; at the same time their attitude to the Government is said to be rather defiant. The opium habit is very prevalent. Trade, resources and supplies. —There are no local manufactures, but the bazar contains about 170 shops. Borazjun depends upon dates and agri culture and upon the transit through it of the Shiraz and upcountry trade. About 300 mules belonging to Borazjun are employed on the Shiraz route. Borazjun is the only trade centre in Dashtistan and its trade is consequent ly an epitome of the trade of the district. The exports all go to Bushire,. and comprise wheat, barley, beans, melons, tobacco, gum, wool, firewood, charcoal and lime ; the imports for the consumption of the town and dis trict are chiefly prints, rice, coffee, sugar, tea, opium and spices and are from Bushire. The water-supply is from deep wells and is reported to be good and abundant; but it has been said that though pleasant to theBOK -BOR 169 taste, It is apt to cause diarrhoea or colic to travellers. Excellent water can be procured from the hills a few miles to the east of Borazjun. The currency of the town is Persian, chiefly silver krans ; the man of Borazjun is equal to about 18 lbs. 11 oz. English, giving a Hashim man of 139 lbs. English. Administration .—Borazjun, though at present farmed with its depen dencies by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, belongs to the Government of Ears and is the seat of the Khan who administers the greater part of the Dashtistan district ; he is not himself a Papri but belongs to a tribe called Maiman. A Deputy-Governor also resides here on behalf of the Governor-General of Ears. Communications .— The ordinary route from Bushire to Shiraz passes by Borazjun, which by land is distant 43 miles from Biishire and 16 from DalikI, the next stage beyond it ; but the land journey from Bushire can be reduced to 28 miles by taking boat from Bushire to Shif. The approach to Borazjun from Khush Ab direction is thus described by Captain Wray ‘ ‘A thick date grove completely hides it from sight from the road. There is then an opening and then a date grove, then another opening and another date grove. The road goes between the left and centre groves, but in the right (east) grove there are wells of good water. General Sir James Outram in the war of 1857 advanced as far as this place, but found it unoccupied. The hills are not above 3 miles off, and they are stony, bare, crumpled, and furrowed in appearance.” The Indo-Europeait Telegraph Company’s line from Bushire to Shiraz passes through Borazjun, and is connected at this place with the Persian Government telegraph by Bandar Rig, Bandar Dilam, Behbehan and Ahwez to Shushtar and Dizful.

The village of Buldaji is watered by channels from this dam. There are also several small springs of drinking water. Around and in the broad valley is much corn land (reaped at the end of August); there are some willows, but no other trees. To the south are the ruins of a well-built Armenian village, whose inhabitants evacuated it in 1902 and moved into the neighbourhood of Gandaman. The village is well suited for defence.

The valley is highly cultivated, with abundant water from a good stream. Sup plies of all kinds are available. The village has a considerable bazar, be longing chiefly to Saiyids attached to Agha Najafi of Isfahan. The govern ment only is in the hands of the Bakhtiari to whom it has at times caused some trouble. The population is about 3 ; 000. Many of these are chdrvdddrs or mule owners, and it is claimed that they own some 2,000 mules between them.

BtlSHIRE PENINSULA— A torpedo-shaped promontory lying parallel to the coast of the Persian district of Tangistan at a distance of 4 or 5 miles ; the intervening space is occupied by a grass and reed grown swamp or mashllek, across which runs a caravan route to the mainland. Extent. —The peninsula measures exactly 12 miles from its north-west tip, on which stands Bushiretown, to Ras Halileh at the opposite end. The maximum breadth at about midway is about 3l£ miles. The peninsula is surrounded by the sea on north, west and south ; on the east it is bounded by the mashileh. Physical features, water and vegetation. —The site of Bushire town is rocky and slightly elevated above the sea, but immediately south of it a strip of very low ground runs across the peninsula from coast to coast : beyond this low strip the ground begins to rise again, and the remainder of the peninsula is a sort of turtle back, attaining a maximum elevation of 150 feet in the centre at Imamzadeh village. There is a stretch of low cliff along the coast at the south-west corner of Bushire town and again in the neighbourhood of Rishehr. . The low parts of the peninsula are sandy, the higher oj a firm, arable soil. Wells are numerous, but there is no really good drinking water in the penin sula ; the best is obtained from shallow wells near the beach at Bandar Halileh, and some of respectable quality at a spot called Naidi between 1 and 2 miles south of Bushire town. Here and there a little grass is to be found. An occasional her and tamarisk are the only natural growing trees; but the babul and cypress are found ; also a tree with yellow flowers. Climate. — See article on Bushire town. The heat on the high parts of th@ peninsula is less oppressive than in the town. Storms are frequent in December and are sometimes accompanied by thunder and hail. Population. —The inhabitants of the peninsula, exclusive of Bushire town., number about 8,500 souls and belong to mixed tribes. They possess about 300 rifles.180 BUS—BUB ) Agriculture. —A large proportion of the peninsula consists of arable land, which in part is cultivated by means of wells and in part by rainfall. The ordinary crops are wheat and barley, sown about December and reaped after 4 months. In places there are date groves, but not of thriving appearance. There are cpiantities of grapes, vines and many other fruits grown. Vegetables of all sorts are grown except potatoes. Communicatiorcs. —'The only road in the peninsula fit for vehicles is one 6 miles in length from Bushire to Sabzabad. Three cables of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, 2 from Jashk and 1 from Fao, are land ed a few hundred yards west of Rishehr fort, and conducted overland for about one mile north-east to the telegraph station. From the Rishehr office three land lines run across the peninsula to the coast and thence to Shiraz. A short line runs direct from the office to the British Resident’s house at Sabzabad, and another line accompanies the Shiraz line to the coast of the peninsula and then stikes north to Bushire town, where instruments in the British Residency and the Persian Telegraph Office are connected with it. Administration. —The present Katkhuda of Rishehr farms the land revenue of the peninsula for 500 to GOO tumdns a year. He maintained a body of 35 to 40 men armed with rifles who act as a sort of police in the villages. The Bushire peninsula is under the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports who has his head-quarters at Bushire town. The Russian Consulate-General and the German Consulate are situated on the west coast of the peninsula.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BUSHIRE TOWN— Lat. 28° 59' 1' N. {Stiffe) ; Long. 50° 49' 24 7 E. (St. John). This is the chief port of Persia ; it is also the principal town on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf, and the headquarters of the administrative division known as the Gulf Ports. Its position on the Persian coast is about 190 miles north by east of Manameh in Bahrain, 170 miles east by south of Kuwait and 150 miles east-south-east of the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab. Situation and Harbour. —The town occupies the extreme northern tip of a promontory, elsewhere described as the Bushire Peninsula. It is situated on a bay, the width of which is 5 miles north by west from the town, which may be regarded as its southern entrance point, to the nearest part of the Rudhilleh coast. The greater part of the bay is very shallow and a large part of it is occupied by mud flats. The innermost anchorage for vessels of moderate draft is at the head of a channel called Khur Daireh and is situated in the middle of the entrance of the bay. It lies nearly 3 miles north-north west of the town, and is sheltered on the north-west by a submerged sand bank called Baq’at-al-’Ali, while on the south-east it is adjoined by a long narrow wall of sand called Lakfeh only 1 to 3 feet below water. The hold ing ground in the Khur Daireh is good and the soundings 3 to 4 fathoms, but the approach in many places has only 15 to 17 feet of water and the anchorage is a rough one in a Shimdl. The outer anchorage is exposed both to the Shimdl and the Sharqi, and is in about 5 fathoms at about 5 miles from the town. A deep creek about 200 yards broad, called Khur Sultanl, runs past the east side of the town in a south-easterly direction towards the Mashideh ; it is unfortunately divided from the inner anchorage by a bank 1|- miles broad on which the soundings are only 5 to 6 feet. At Pudar, 1| miles above the town^ the creek, which has soundings of over 20 feet,BUS—BIB 181 forks ; one brancli continues south-east to the MashileJi, while the other, called Khur Shakari, bearing at first to the north-east, sweeps round in a great semicircle and eventually joins the bay at its northern end. On this creek, near the place where it opens again into the bay, is Shif, a landing-place for travellers in the interior. Between the curving creek and the open bay is a mass of mud flats and low islands. Site, buildings and topography. —Bushire is a compact town. The houses are of stone, and nearly all have an upper storey. There are only about 1,500 houses, but the population is dense and out of all proportion to the number of the dwellings. The ordinary building material is a friable conglomerate of sand and shells. The town is divided into four wards, or mahallehs, styled Behbehani, Deh- dashti, Khashhabi, and Kuti; besides there are two small quarters occupied by Jews. At the northern end of the town is an open space called Basldun, between which and the water’s edge is situated a block of buildings contain ing the Imperial Customs house and the Persian Post Office. The esplanade upon the seaward side runs at some height above the beach, a nd along it are some of the best edifices in Bushire. The furthest building to the south is the British Residency, and a little beyond it is an db-ambdr. Climate and sanitation. —The hottest month in Bushire is August and the coldest are January and February ; in summer the thermometer has been known to rise to llb’S 0 F. The worst period is between the 20th of July and the 15th of September, when the temperature seldom rises above 100° but the difference between the'wet and the dry bulb readings is sometimes only 2 degrees. The sanitary condition of Bushire is bad, for the soil is riddled with cess-pools which are seldom cleaned out ; yet the place is not unhealthy. Malarial fever is the most prevalent disease amongst the native population. Ophthalmia and other eye diseases are rife, caused by flies, dust, gla.re, and the insanitary habits of the people. Rainfall .—The average monthly rainfall for the five years ending 31st December 1906 was as follows : — J anuary .. 1’23 at average 6 days per month. February 0-73 „ „ 5 March .. 0-61 „ „ 5 April .. 0-45 „ „ 3 May .. Nil. June • • July • • August • * &gt;&gt; September .. ' * 55 October * * 55 November .. .. 1 ’72 at average 4 days per month. December .. .. 2*58 „ 5 It will be seen from the above that most of the rainfall takes place November, December, January and February, which may be said to consti tute the ramy season. These four months are intermittently stormy and cold on shore, the sea being rough. It seldom actually freezes, but the thermometer occasionally falls almost to freezing point. Fires are almost a necessity in December, January and February and welcome after sundown182 BUS-BUS I until the end of March. In March and April the rainfall is usually in the form of brief showers, the sky remaining otherwise clear. Prevailing winds. —The prevailing winds are the Shimdl or north-west, and Kaus, which blows from the south-east. The former prevails at sea for nearly nine months of the year, and blows very cold and boisterous in the winter months, a Shimdl or “ Nor’-wester ” lasting usually three days. The same wind blows almost incessantly during June and July, and though then less violent, relieves the temperature near the coast. At this season it is called locally the “ 40 days’ winds.” Population — The present population is about 15,000. It is com posed of extremely heterogenous elements, but it is predominately Persian, and Persian is almost the only language heard. The following are the most important of the classes represented at Bushire Persians. Other Orientals. Bushiris .. 5,000 Shambadis .. .. 1,000 Belibehanls.. .. 1,000 Kazaranis .. .. 1,000 Khanasiria .. .. 300 Shirazis .. 200 Tangaslrls .. 200 Duvvams .. .. 200 Dehdashtls .. 150 Dashtis 100 Jews .. •• •• 600 Armenians .. .. • • 35 Goanese .. .. . • 20 Baghdad Muhamma dans .. 20 Baghdad Christians .. .. 18 Europeans. British .. .. • • 24 Eurasians .. .. 10 French, Russians, Belgians, etc. 18 As a whole the population are physically well-developed and men tally quick and intelligent ; but their naturally well-bred manners conceal an unreliable and ungrateful disposition, and they are inclined to be uncivil to foreigners, though less than formerly. ^ -on Trade. Bushire is still the chief gateway of foreign trade in Southern Persia. Local trade is conducted in the bazars, which are situated on the east side of the town ; the principal of these is clean, roofed in and some 211 yards in length. In all there are about 600 shops. Standards of weight are the Bushire man of 7f lbs. English and a Hashim man consisting of 16 Bushire mans and equal to 12 4 lbs. English. Shipping. —The shipping of Bushire consists of 50 to 60 mdshuwahs of 10 to 15 tons manned by 6 to 7 men, each which runs only between the town and the harbour ; about 50 sambuqs, bums and large rmshuwahs of 30 to 40 tons which make voyages to all the principal Gulf Ports; 4 baghlahs of 50 to 60 tons ; and about 20 larger vessels which make long voyages. Besides these there are about 350 fishing-boats. Supplies. —The water of the town is bad. Every house almost has a well, but the liquid which it yields is bitter ; about 10 per cent, of the houses are provided with reservoirs. The better class obtain their drinking water from Bahmani, Andar Bandar, Dahmiru and Bujikdan or Gunjashkdan, places in the peninsula at a considerable distance from the town ; but even this water is slightly brackish and cannot be drunk with impunity by people who are not accustomed to it. Other supplies in the town depend chiefly on the state of the export and import trade at the moment. Communications .—The adjoining mainland can be preached by boat, dis embarkation taking place at Shif on the northern coast of the bay, whichis reached in about 8 hours ; or by carriage by following the eastern edges of the Bushire Peninsula for about 4 miles and then crossing the Mashileh at the same place as the telegraph line. The amount of transport ordinarily present at or near Bushire may be estimated at 250 to 300 mules when the Shif route is closed, but when it is open there are none. Administration. —The force at the disposal of the Governor of Bushire consists nominally of one battalion of regular infantry and 50 artillerymen, but in fact he has only 200 infantry and 20 gunners under his orders. The regular garrison seldom receive pay, and for the most part gain a live lihood by working as labourers in the town. The Governor’s power at sea is represented by the Persepolis gunboat of 600 tons and 450 horse-power ; her extreme speed is 6 knots and she carries 6 guns and 24 snider rifles. There are no regular tribunals. Civil disputes are ordinarily settled by the ecclesiastical authorities. The Imperial Persian Gulf Customs under Bel gian management have their principal office in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. The British Residency Surgeon is Port Health Officer, and the penalties for infraction of the quarantine regulations are enforced by the customs author ities. Foreign Representation. —Great Britain is represented by a Consul-Gen eral, who is also British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He has two assistants of the Indian Political Service. There is also a Vice-Consul belonging to the Levant Consular Service. A British Post Office is maintain ed in the Residency, the mails not passing through the Persian office. There are at Bushire 37 European British subjects as well as native subjects. Russia is the only other power represented by a Consul-General. Fiance, Germany^ the Netherlands and Turkey are each represented by a Vice-Consul.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BUSHKAN or BUSHUKUN— Lat. 28°48 / N. Long. 51°44' E. Elev. 1,990'. A village in Pars on the road from Bushire to Firuzabad and 60f miles (Stotherd) east of Bushire town. Other estimates give the distance from Bushire as 75 miles. The village is situated on the north-eastern slopes of the Kuh-i-Siah and is built in two parts, half being upon a small, isolated mound, about 390 yards to the south-west of the other portion and sur rounded by mud walls. The village contains a mud fort (probably the walled portion on the mound) and some 250 huts with a few date-trees about. In the second part of the village are about 100 houses with 1,000 sheep, 200 cows, 4 horses, 20 ponies and 300 donkeys. Barley • and bhusa are pro curable, as is also firewood from numerous bushes scattered over the valley. Plane trees are numerous, and fuel can also be obtained in abundance from the nomads in the neighbourhood. There is a good camping-ground, and the water is good, but the supply is limited. It is obtained from wells and springs.— {Jones — Pelly — Durand — Stotherd, 1893.) BUSHRABAD— A village in the Anar district (q.v.) of Kirman. Bt SHU’AIB (No. 1) (Laristan)—Lat. 26° 48'7' N.

It has 9 villages,184 BUS-BUS contains 425 men of the ’Abusemate tribe, and is subject to the Shaikh of Nakhiiu. The principal villages areGiruat the south-east end and Saza at the north-east, of whichthfrabove arc the latitude and longitude. The outer parts of the island are. rocky, and loose stones occur except at the west end, which contains good soil. The centre is a valley with good soil and cult’vated. The inhabitants are civil, but great cheats. Good water and some few supplies are procurable. There is a fine pearl * fishery round the island. It is separated from the main land by a channel of considerable width, particularly at its west end, from which runs a long ledge of rocks. It is said that rocks lie off its south-east end. The anchor age-of the east end is well sheltered from nor’-westers', and that at the north-east part from both nor’'-westers and sou’-westers ; but the ground is bad, and it will always be prudent to lay with a long scope of cable or t. “ The straits of Bii Sku’aib are formed by the islands of Bh Shu’aib and Shitvar and the main. They are nearly 9 miles wide at the west part, and 5^ between the spit off the north-west of Bu Shu’aib and Nakbilu, its narrowest parts ; they are 14 miles in length, and have soundings from 32 to 5 fathoms ; in mid-channel the soundings are from 32 to 16 fathoms. These soundings at the distance of 1 mile from the shore are quite regular, and in no part is there danger outside of 5 fathoms, that is outside the small bank that runs along the side of Bu Shu’aib. On the tail of the spit runniogoff north-east of Bu Shu’aib there are 4 fathoms of water and it shoals gradually, until 8 miles near the shore to two-thirds of a mile, when it shoals to 2 fathoms. No other danger exists in these fi\e channels.” —{ Bruchs — Taylor — Kinnein — Morier — Chesney^) BU SHU’AIB (No. 2)— Lat. 26° 42' N. Long. 53° 20' E.

It subtends the coast of the Shlbkuh district to which it is nearly parallel, from Shivuh in the west to Nakhiiu in the east, a mean dis tance of about 14 miles, but, at the east end, the coast line is within 5 miles. The length of the island is almost 15 miles and its breadth about 3 miles. It rises to a height of 120 feet on the centre and has a low plain 1 to 2 miles in extent at either end ; the greater part is almost devoid of vegetation. The anchorages off the coast are sheltered from one direction only. \A a ter is found in wells 2 to 3 fathoms deep and is of good quality. There are ten villages on the island which are as foliow-s : Dehriz, Dehkun , Halah, Kufali, Kuseh, Laz, Laza, Qurat, Has. In all there are about 300 houses on the island, and the total population is about 1,500 souls. The people are Arabs of various tribes who are Shafi Sunnis. In summer the population is increased by immigrants from the Persian coast. Some cultivation of wheat and barley is carried on, but the principal occupations are fishing and pearl-diving. There are two fairly large sambuqs and about 85 smaller boats. The island is subject to the Hamadi Shaikh of Mugam whose authority is represented by a Naib at Laz. ihe people have about 40 modern rifles.— [Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BUSINJAN— Lat. 30° 11' N.

About a mile to the east of the town the Gulshan Valley reaches the sea, forming a considerable creek, beyond which again is swampy land ; the creek is 300 yards wide, and impassable at high tide and after heavy rain. The village has several tow r ers and there are date-groves behind it, over which rises a fort on a hillock inland of the town, nearly 100 feet high : this fort is reckoned the strongest in all the Shlbkuh ports and enables the Charakis to hold their own against the Marzuql and Hamadi Shaikhs, their neighbours. The general appearance of the place is clean and attractive. Water is partly from tanks and part ly from wells, 15 feet deep. The anchorage is good in easterly winds, but some swell is experienced in a Shimal.

The A1 Ali are Sunnis. The people have some cultivation of dates and other crops, but the majority are mkhudas, sailors and pearl- divers, and a few are merchants. They own about 8 trading vessels (baghlahs, ghunchahs and tambuqs) which run as far as Basreh on the one side and Masqat on the other, occasionally even visiting India ; and they have also about a dozen regular pearl-boats which cross the Gulf, and rather more than a dozen smaller craft, which are used for fishing and for pearl-diving off the neighbouring island of Qais.

Here and there are small streams bursting through in cascades, hurrying on to augment the main stream below. The descent to Du Pulan for the first third is an easy gradient, the road wide, winding along the hillside with some few stones about ; the next third is bad, steep, narrow and stony, running down a gully between two spurs of the hill, the last third descending to the village is good, the gully opening out.

A kaleh in a plain of same name in the Bakhtiari country, surrounded by high mountains and lying about 18 miles from Ardal on the road to Isfahan via Buriijan. It consists of a mound rather difficult of approach on account of marshes. It is the summer quarter of the Bakhtiari and the seat of the Bakhtiari Ilkhani, being generally occupied by him during the summer months. From here the government of the tribes is conducted. The mound rises about 100 feet above the grassy and marshy plain forming the north end of the valley, and the fort on the top of it has an imposing appearance from a distance. The fort is on approach, however, found to be almost a ruin from want of repairs. It is a quadrangular building with a bastion tower at each corner (a fifth on the northern side to flank a breach in the wall), with a large command ing tower in the centre of the western face, but outside the keep of the whole fort. The site has had a kaleh on it from time immemorial. The present building was laid out and finished by the late Husain Quli Khan. The design of the whole edifice is on a grand scale, and the work was originally well erected by Persian workmen from Isfahan. The doors and windows were of the best make, the public rooms ornamented in the best Persian style, with a,n ayineh-kdri or “ mirror ” durbar room and large mirrors of European make. The ceilings too were well elaborated in wood carving of a particularly handsome grain. Only the traces of these once handsome decorations remain, although the fort is still a dwelling-place. It is 7 miles in length from east to west and 4 miles across at its greatest width. The valley is of great beauty. On the south it is bounded by the Kallar mountains, and on the north by the Zirreh mountain a small lake exists about 1| miles south of the fort, but in summer the water-supply is poor. It is surrounded by miles of green pasture, but there are no grain supplies (June). Grain is brought here from Shalamzar and other places. There are a few temporary shops on the mound. The best camping-ground for troops is at the foot of the hills, not in the plain. Burton, writing in August 1903, says:—The country is typical of Persian bleakness, the mountains being between 3,000 and 6,000 feet in h ight. Water is very scarce, and the mountains dry and lifeless, but covered with oak forest and grass. There are a number of streams from the moun tains and considerable cultivated land, but no trees. Pasture is doubtless now at its worst, and is found only near the edges of the swamps and streams. There are some clumps of apricot trees and a few apple trees. Few arms or horses were seen. Flocks of sheep and goats were numerous, and there were some cattle and donkeys. The people were mainly in rags and without arms. There was no evidence anywhere of the strong, well-armed or well mounted tribes that it was hoped to see.— {Sawyer, 1890— Ramsden, 1902— Burton, 1903— Arbuthnot, 1905— Lorimer, 1906.)CHIGINl— A tribe of tbe Tihran group of Luristan (q.v.).

In the plain south of DalakI is a bitumen pit, the substance of which is collected by the natives chiefly as an ingredient for a prescription which they apply to the sore backs of their camels, but also for the smear ing of boat and roof timbers. Some mills are erected near the banks of one of the streams. The marsh is covered by a dense jungle of reeds, which swarms with wild boar. The village is a wretched one, consisting only of a few mud huts, surrounded by the extensive date plantations for which it is famous, and which, contrasting with the hills of various and strange hues in the background, give it quite a picturesque appearance. It stands at the foot of a range of salt hills, which, rugged and sterile, rise to a consider able height behind it. These salt hills are remarkable in shape and colour, as is always the case with salt hills in Persia. They are angular and abrupt, curiously stratified, and coloured red or brown, green, light blue, grey and white. They are said to abound with wild goat and ibex. A small fort that once existed here is now in ruins, having been destroyed some time ago by the people of Borazjun. There is a clean mosque of white stucco, and a small bath at the extremity of the village. The Rudhilleh river is 1 mile distant. Dalaki is considered one of the hottest places in the country, and a missionary, the Revd. H. Martyn, who visited it in 1810, when the thermometer stood at 126°, described the place as one of Nature s ulcers. Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a medical report on the part of Persia ad jacent to the telegraph line, writes thus of the country between Dalaki and Bushire as regards its sanitary conditions :— “ The district is nowhere many feet above the sea, and for 4 farsaJchs reach ing to Chaghadak high spring tides sometimes overflow the plain. Dates, cereals, melons, etc., are extensively cultivated ; the country around Boraz jun is very fertile. From Bushire to Chaghadak no water is procurable ; beyond this it can be found every 1 or 2 farsakhs, though generally slightly brackish ; 1 farsakh before reaching Dalaki are numerous naphtha springs which impregnate the water. The drinking supply at Borazjun is from wells and is fairly good to the taste, but here, as well as along the road, it is apt to cause diarrhoea or colic to travellers. Excellent water can be procured from the hills a few miles to the east of Borazjun, and also from a spring 1 mile east of Dalaki. The climate is very hot, damp and sultry during the greater part of the year ; at times hot winds are prevalent. From April to September inclusive no travelling can be done during the heat of the day, and during June, July and August only at night. Near Bushire and, to a less extent, as far as Borazjun, from about 20th May to the end of June, during the shimal, sea breezes are felt towards evening, and these make the climate somewhat more endurable. “ Dalaki is one of the hottest places in Persia, and when the wind is from the direction of the naphtha and sulphur wells the air is most obnoxious. In the spring, midges and sand-flies abound, the former on the march and the latter, together with mosquitoes, during a halt make the traveller s life a burden. Dates and bread form the staple diet, supplemented by rice, ghi and eggs. In the spring and summer mast, dung-melons and cu cumbers are plentiful, and quantities are eaten. There is not a large con sumption of meat; the better classes occasionally eat mutton or fowl, and the 2 E 2220 DAL—DAL poorer, goat’s flesh. The diseases most common in the district are intermit tent fever, which in autumn is sometimes so severe that it causes many deaths—enlarged spleen, hepatitis, dyspepsia, infantile diarrhoea, and dis eases of the eye, especially opthalmia. Other diseases also met with are haemorrhoids, costiveness, dropsy, paralysis, especially hemiplegia, intestin al worm (Ascaris lumbricoides are the most common, but oxyuris vermicvlaris and Toenia solium &amp;\so occur), asthma, bronchitis of old people, eczemas, sy philis, diptheria, pertussis, measles, small-pox and probably typhoid fever. Cases of heat apoplexy occur during the summer, especially to travellers. “ Eye-diseases, usually commencing with ophthalmia, are the bane of this district; probably one person in every four las lost the use ofcneeye. Total blindness is by no means rare, and few have good vision in both eyes. Often when a child is attacked, no treatment is sought, no trouble is taken to keep the eyes clean, flies are allowed to settle on the eyes, per bops on ulcer is left on the cornea ; this process is repeated until perhaps the ir's is also affected or the whole body of the eye. It is no uncommon thing to see a person with extensive opacities of the cornea, and with the pupil closed or nearly so. Sometimes the eye is collapsed, and a history is told of acute in flammation evidently purpulent ophthalmia, where sloughing of the cornea and consequent blindness has occurred within 24 hours. On the whole I do not think this district is especially unhealthy, though the summer is very depressing and enervating, especially to Europeans.”— {Ousely — Malcolm — Clerk —Monteith—Morier —Taylor — Felly — J ones — Stack — -Ussher—Durand — Odling — Curzon—Routes in Persia, Section 1, Ed. 1898 —Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

It is crossed by the Dallch Pass the height of which is given variously as 6,020' and 5,350'. In April 1884 these hills were snow-topped. The range lies about west- north-west and east-south-east and is close to the Khiulch range more to the east. The ascent is not steep, but difficult on account of the high ledges of rock and boulders to be surmounted. It could readily be improved, and has been so for some way on each side of the top by the Nazim Khalwat. Just at the foot of the pass and on the south side of it, the Dam-i-Chul road branches off.

That he was not successsful in this nefarious plan is proved by the fact that the Damukh are still found in a group of settlements in the south east comer of the Dashtistan District, Chah Kutah being the largest.

DARAB District— A district of Ears about 145 miles south-east of Shiraz measured to its capital town Darab or Drabgird {q.v.). The district extends 50 miles east and west, and 27 miles north and south. The soil of the district is reputed to be of great fertility in many places, and, when rain falls in sufficient quantities, grain yields from 10 to 50 fold. The product of the district are wheat, barley, zurat, sufferd (a kind of millet), rice, tobacco, sesame seed and cotton. The district possesses numerous flocks and herds ; c f the former, which are usually black and brown, or red as in other parts of Ears, goats are more numerous than sheep. The climate of course, varies with the elevations, but for a general description of it, as also of the administration of the district, vide this G zett er, Darab town. The revenue of the district is £6,300 annually, divided amongst a fixed population of 2,500 families, probably 10,000 souls. The hills on the south side of the plain have no water, and are uninhabited. The following- is a list of the villages in the district :— 1. Bahaduran. 18. Hasanabad (1). 35. Mianshakh. 2.

A town in Ears, and the capital of the district of the same name, lying about 140 miles south-east of Shiraz, and 208 miles north-west of Bandar ’Abbas. South-south-east of the town lies the Kaleh-i-Darab (q.v.). The town has a fine situation on the banks of a river, in an extensive p ain interspersed with villages and cultivation, and is surrounded^by groves of lemon and orange trees. The mountains on the north of the Kuh-i-Ma dan {q.v ) form an amphitheatre, the deepest part of which is about 1 mile from the town, which extends towards the two horns of the crescent. Nume rous palm or date trees, planted wide apart, are scattered over the surrounding country. Town and 'population .—The town is not as well built as Fasa. The houses are mostly built of mud and stones ; ve y few kiln-burnt bricks are to be seen. The main street is long and straggling, and, owing to the numerous and apparently thriving gardens, the town appears to cover a lot of grou d. The town proper contains about 1,000 houses, of which the central bazaar accounts for something over 100 shops. The total population is about 6 ; 000 souls. Trade, supplies and resources.—The lemon and orange trees yield such an abundance of fruit that the juice is exported to every pa t of Persia. Tobacco is cultivated to a great extent, and is so excellent in quality that it is exported to Shiraz and even to India and Arabia. The people to have neglected the date palms which flourish here, and out of 100,000 which were formerly said to exist, only about 30,000 remain. As well as the date palm, apricot, peach, plum, almond and pistachio trees flourish here, and grape-vines grow on the hill sides. On the Kuh-i-Ma dan above, copper, silver and iron are all said to be found, but none is now work ed. Gach also can be obtained from the hills. Kiln-burnt bricks cost 15 lerans per 1,000; and sundried bricks 2 krdns per 1,000. The labourer’s hire is from 10 to 15 shdhis per diem (=4d. to 6d.). The vil agers own 400 donkeys and 4,000 sheep, and provisions of all kinds are abundant. Climate.—The climate is oppressively warm in the plain during the sum mer months. In winter s ow is rarely seen. On the whole the climate is so mild that lemons are found ripening on the trees all the year round. Administration .—Darab may be termed the family seat of the Qavvam-ul- Mulk who is hereditary Mayor of Shiraz. The exactions of this potentate caused serious riots in Shiraz in 1893. The mdlldt of the town is 24,000 tumdns annually. Date palms are taxed according to their bearing. Communications .—The following are the main routes radiating from Darab :— (1) To Shiraz 8 stages .. .. 145 miles. (2) To Jahrum 3 stages .. .. 75 miles. (3) To Lar 5 stages .. 86£ miles. (4) To Nirlz 4 stages .. .. 46| miles. (5) To Saidabad 5 stages .. .. 75J miles.

Elev. A large salt lake in Ears to the north of Lake Niriz, with which it is connected by two channels.

DARIA-I-NIRlZ or NlRIZ or NAIRlZ BAKHTIGAN— Lat 29 ° 30 ' N Long. 53° to 54°; Elev. 5,250'. A large lake in the province of Ears, its most westerly point when, ts waters are highest, being about 35 miles east of Shiraz. The length of it is about 60 miles, with a breadth of perhaps 3 to 5 mile. The water of this lake is almost entirely derived from the river Kur, betterknown as the Band Amir. In a dry summer season the water evaporates entirely and its bed may then be traversed on foot. The inhabitants take the opportunity of collecting the salt with which its bed is encrusted. The salt is esteemed remarkably fine and is in general use throughout Fars. The banks are often completi ly whitened by the presence of innumer able water birds, chiefly swans and flamingoes, which latter also may be seen w. ding far into the water in search of their prey. The oyster-catcher is seen abundantly, but is very timid. The water is extremely salt. The shores have no sandy beach, but soft, fine mud, which has an unpleasant sab'n' smell when stirred up, and no shells are to be seen in it. The inhabitants say that it contains no fish or any living animal, but it is not improbable that in the mud are found polypi and other living creatures, upon which the birds feed.— (Abbott.) Wells (30th April 1881) describes the lake from h s halting-place, Khan-i-Kat, as follows :— “We walked down to the lake for a bathe, but found it impossible to get into water above our knees,though we trudged away for at least quarter of a mile. Large flocks of flaming es were flying to and fro, and a large sort of black and white duck. The shore of the lake had an unpleasant, soapy, saline smell when the mud was stirred. In marching along the banks many fine streams of clear water are passed, but they are all brackish to within | a mile of Khir, when suddenly one comes on a sweet spring. At 15 miles from Khir the lake dies away into a sodaish, white ooze, and a good stream of fresh water flows in here.” Dobbs, who skirted the south shore of the lake in April 1903, had much the same experience when wading into the lake. He describes the lake as being studded with numerous wooded islets. As the summer advances the quantity of the water greatly decreases, as is apparent from the following description :— “ Judging from the appearance of the lake-bed in June, it is not a hollow of the ground, but simply one of the level plains, which in this part of the country occupy the intervening space between the ranges of hills ; and as it has a slightly lower elevation than the surrounding plains or valleys, the water draining into it cannot escape, but forms after the rains a very large shallow lake, the waters of which rapidly evaporate at the commencement of the hot season. The limits of the lake at the conclusion of the rainy season are shown by the line where a light, sandy loam, covered by a saline deposit, commences. In June the water has so far receded that only a narrow streak is visible in the far distance about the centre of the bed, while all the remaining surface is left exposed, covered with thi* deposit, which glitters in the sunshine like snow, and is so soft that a short way from the edge it is impossible to walk upon it. The slope of the ground towards the centre is so gradual as to be almost imperceptible. The natives say that a little water always remains about the middle of the bed, even after many months without rain, due to the streams which drain in and have no outlet; all the bays and inlets are, however, quite dried up, nothing being visible but a white expanse of salt. Lake Nargis in no way differs in the above respects from LakeNiriz. There was water %Y a228 DAE—DAR remaining in it only at its western end. I was prevented from ascertaining by personal inspection whether the second smaller channel between the lakes really exists, but from all accounts, when the tide is at its full height, the water entirely surrounds the end of the promontory shown in the maps, and makes an island of it for the time being. The whole of the promontory in question is barren, desolate and uninhabited. The long inlet by the villages of Tashk and Kushkah is totally dry by June; and, though at that time the exposed bed cannot be crossed, the inhabitants say that later on in the hot season it is quite possible to walk over, as the deposit gets firmer. The northern shore of the lakes is inhabited by the Lashani tribe. There are smaller tribes on the other shores of these lakes, but the country, as a whole, is too sterile to attract many settlers, and has moreover suffered severely for some years past from great swarms of locusts”.— (Wells — Dobbs.)230 DAR-DAR DARI 1-1-PARISHAN or FAMtR—LAT. 29° 30 / N.

It receives the drainage of the KazaiAn valley. Whether it has any outlet on the east is not known. It is a long narrow sheet of water stretching north-east and south-west. Its water is said to be salt, but this is not known for certain ; it is the resort of innumerable wild fowl, and excellent shooting is to be obtained in the dense fringe of reeds and swampy flats in which it terminates ; vide also Kutal-i-Dukhtar.

Supplies of all kinds are abundant, and water is plentiful and good.—-(GW, 1880.)DARKASH WARKASH, TANG-I- -Lat. 29° 32'5'. Long. 50 o 40'E. Elev. 8,300'. A gorge in the Bakhtiari country, through which the whole drainage of the Chehar Mahal carried off by the Ab-i-Behishtabad {vide this Gazet teer) from its south-western extremity. Its name may be translated into English as “ The Gorge of Ingress and Egress.” It is a remarkable defile, with a width hardly exceeding a J of a mile at its widest point, and narrowing down to half that distance at others. Its mountain walls rise precipitously to a height of from 1,000 to 4,000 feet on each side above the bed of the torrent, and throw into perpetual shade the sea-green riband below. The whole length of the defile, from its northern exit on the Chehar Mahal to its southern outlet on to the small plain near the village of Behishtabad is 7 miles. The track, which runsdhrough it may, at its best, be described as “ a difficult mule-track ’ ’ and in the winter months a dangerous one ; it is one of the alternative routes taken by the Bakhtiari caravan road between KharajI (4th stage), and Du Bulan (6th stage from Isfahan). Its passage through this gorge is marked by a combination practically of a defile and three passes. At its entrance from the Chehar Mahal the track runs alongside the stream for about 1 mile, when it crosses by a ford the Ab- i-Junaqan, which enters the gorge by another opening from the north, and just before its junction with the main stream. This ford is negotiable with some difficulty by laden animals when the waters are high in the spring. The track now ascends and crosses a pass of some 500 feet in height ; when it descends and follows the course of the river on its right bank and about 100 feet above it. An ascent of some 1,200 feet then takes place over a second pass, the gradients of which are very steep and the pathway very narrow in places. A less steep descent again brings the track nearer to the level of the river for about £ a mile ; when a final ascent of some 2,000 feet to the highest point in its course through the tang is reached at about 8,000 feet. The road then winds along the contour of the mountain for some distance, and eventually descends by a series of steep zigzags on to the plain of Behishtabad.— (Preeee, 1902— Arbuthnot, 1905.)

The name of the place means “ stone ” in Turkish, from the fact of there being lead mines there. There are so-called works there. The lead seams run parallel to the general strike of the hills. It is found both in the form of an oxide and associated with copper. It is reduced to a metallic state by pulverisation, washing, and heating in a blast furnace, all of which operations are performed in the most primitive manner. The refuse copper ore is thrown away, as the miners are not acquainted with the manner of reducing it to a metallic state. There are about 40 miners here. The yearly output is about 4,500 maunds, of which one-sixth is levied as a tax by the Ears Government.— {Lovett.) DASHT AB— Lat. Long. Elev.

DASHT ARZHI\ T or-I-ARJ AN— Lat. 29°40 / N. Long. 52° 3'E. Elev. 6,600' (Routes in Persia) 4,100— (Odling.) A plain in Ears, 47 miles west of Shiraz, across which lies the main road from Bushire. The various estimates of the size of the plain are bewildering, especially as it is completely mountain-locked and therefore incapable of elasticity. They vary from 16 miles by 10 as a maximum to a minimum of 5 miles by 2. Curzon gives the probable dimensions as 7 to 8 miles length by ^ 2 to 3 miles breadth, and this is probably nearly crrect In summer it is said to be very verdant and to afford good pasturage, the beau ty of the scene invoking a rhapsody from Malcolm. In winter, however, it is very bleak, and the cold is said to be intense. In the wet weather the holkw of the plain is filled by a lake mentioned as long ago as the tenth century by A1 Isbakri, which at other times becomes a swampy marsh. This is the source of one of the tributaries of the Shapur, afterwards the Rudhilleh river. The plain is bounded on the south by limestone rocks in irregular masses, divided by valleys, filled with dwarf oak and hawthorn; on the east and west are limest one cliffs, about 200 feet high; and on the north sandstone and gyp sum. The soil is a black alluvial deposit. The valley is remarkable for its ample supply of water, and for its being a favourite haunt of the nomads during the warm season. In spring there is a good deal of grass on this plain and fuel is always procurable. The climate, however, is said not to be good, fever being prevalent, and a serious cause of irritation existing in the very numerous and venomous serpents which are found here. The neighbourhood is said to abound in wild beasts; wild boars, hyaenas, wolves, antelope, ibex and mountain sheep are found in the surrounding hills. The maneless lion of Southern Persia was formerly found here, and Sir O. St. John was attacked on horseback in 1867 by a lioness. The lion, however, seems now to be extinct. The village of Dasht Arzhin is clustered against the base of the northern hills, and immediately outside of it are the compound and rest-house of the telegraph office of the Indo-European Telegraph, which is open for adminis trative purposes only. The village contains a tumble-down serai and 800 inhabitants. Plentiful water and fire-wood are obtainable here, but food 2 G 2236 DAS—DAS supplies are scarce, though the grazing is good. One mile from the village, on the road to the Kutal-i-PIr Zan, is a small, domed building, covering a Jcadamgdh said to bear the imprint of Ali’s horse-hoofs, and in connection with which the villagers relate the customary astounding miracle. Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a medical report on the part of Persia ad jacent to the telegraph line, writes regarding the district between Kazarun and Dasht Arzhin. “ There is a fair supply of drinking water on the road, which, after climbing the Kutal-i-Dukhtar, leads through the Oak Valley. Here, in early summer, is a large fly ; mosquitoes also are numerous. The former attacks horses producing large, brawny swellings, and quickly causing a loss of condition ; the latter effectually prevents the traveller from sleeping. “ The road now leads up the Kutal-i-Pir Zan (7,400 feet). Half-way up, at a caravanserai, is an abundant supply of excellent water. Descending (water generally abundant) the plain of Dasht Arzhin is reached (4,100 feet above sea-level). Nearly one-half of this plain is covered by a marshy lake which apparently has no outlet. The climate here varies greatly. The Oak Valley has a mild winter, but it is very hot in summer ; on the top of the Kutal-i-Pir Zan the winter is very severe, and the same may be said of Dasht Arzhin. Here in summer the sun is hot, but the nights are generally cool. About the Oak Valley and the Kutal-i-Pir Zan the population is very small. The diet is principally acorn bread. Intermittent fever, dyspepsia, and oph thalmia are prevalent. At Dasht Arzhin intermittent fever is always pre valent ; it causes many deaths to children : the greater part of the population have enlarged spleens and often enlarged livers ; the patient at the same time often either suffers from costiveness or severe diarrhoea. During 1883-84 smallpox was very prevalent; in the spring of the latter year scarcely a family escaped. Stone in the bladder also occurs; perhaps one or two cases are brought into Shiraz every year for operation.”— (Monteith—Ouseley — St. John- — Pelley — Jones — Stack-—Odling — Curzon, 1889. —Newcomen, 1905.) DASHTI —Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Shabankareh district of Ears, on the right bank of the Rudhilleh stream, 2 miles above Basri. It contains 100 houses inhabited by original Persians, and a small fort with four towers. The villagers own 20 horses, 100 donkeys and 1,000 sheep ; they grow wheat, barley and a few dates. Some wool also is exported.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) DASHTl (District) — ' A large and important district of the Persian Gulf littoral of Fars; inland it begins at ’Arab! 27 miles east-south-east of Bushire town, and on the coast at a point 40 miles south-south-east of the same place ; its termination is at the mouth of the Bardistan valley, 105 miles south-east of Bushire. Limits. —Dashti is bounded on the west by the sea and on the east, approximately, by the seaward face of the main maritime range ; some places connected with it lie in valleys within the range. On the north Dashti meets the district of Tangistan, its extreme inland village on this side being ’Arabia, as already mentioned, and the extreme coast village, Qalat. On the south Dashti meets the district of the Shibkuh Ports, of which the nearest to Dashti is Kangan.Physical characteristics .—The physical features of Dashti are few and simple. The principal one is of course the great maritime range, which runs south-eastwards and forms an almost continuous background to the district. Six miles to the north-east of Khurmuj it rises in a grand peak 6,430 feet high, which is generally known as Kuh-i-Khurmuj, but possesses also the more distinctive name of Kuh Bairami. Below Khurmuj town, for 15 or 20 miles, the main range is fronted, towards Dashti, by an outwork of low, sandstone hills called the Kuh-i-Khaki, terminated at its south-east end by a gap 4 or 5 miles wide, through which the Mund river issues from the highlands of Bars. South of the Mund gap the main range, at first under the name of Kuh-i-Namak, resumes its course, and finally impinges on the coast at Kang an a few miles beyond the end ol the district. Kuh Bairami is a huge mass of limestone, having a quaquaver- sal dip, and is sometimes crowned with snow for two or three days in winter. Kuh-i-Namak, 4,000 feet high, is of sandstone below, and towards the summit consists largely of salt, which is visible from afar as glistening streaks of white or grey. A minor but important feature is the sandstone coast range, reaching a height of over 2,500 feet, which bears the name of Kuh-i-Mand or Kuh-i- Kar and is described in the article on the Tangistan district, to which it partly belongs, and in this Gazetteer —vide Kuh-i-Mand. The trough contain ed between this subordinate range and the maiu range is the Khurmuj valley, extending from near Ahram to the Mund river, with a length of 30 and a breadth of several miles, a string of palm leaf villages extends along its western side, and there are a few also upon the east ; it drains by a longitudinal channel called Shur, which is 10 yards broad and contains above 2 feet of brackish water in places, to the Mund river at Chaghapur. Kiih-i-Namak is adjoined on its southern side by a range of which the highest point (3,270 feet) is Kuh-i-Dirang, not far from Kuh-i-Namak. This range runs first southwards for 16 miles and then eastwards for an equal distance : the result is the enclosing between it and the main range of a triangular plain, called Bu Saif, which has no open exit except at its south-eastern corner on the coast between Daiyir and Kangan. Kuh-i- Dirang is of sandstone, and is co-miected with Kuh-i-Namak by mounds of sandstone and gypsum intersected by ravines containing brackish water. Dashti thus consists of two plains or valleys which both drain south-east wards, and are separated from one another by the plain or serpentine valley of the Mund river, of which the average direction is at right angles to theirs. The coast of Dashti has not been thoroughly explored, and part of it is unapproachable by vessels owing to extensive shoals. Six miles off the mainland at about 27 miles south-south-east of Khur Ziarat, and approxi mately the same distance west of Daiyir, is a low islet, § a mile in diameter, called Nakhilu : it appears to be the meeting-place of several hydrogra phical features, and marks the point where the direction of the coast changes from south-south-east to full east. From Nakhilu a great shoal, called Ras-ul-Mutaf, runs for nearly 20 miles to the east-south-east with a deep channel inside, which is open to the east, but blind at the other end except for a boat passage round the north side of Nakhilu ; and between238 DAS—DAS this shoal and the mainland again is a second shoal with yet another deep channel inside. The inner channel appears to be called Khur Umm-ul- Karam from the name of a small island at the head of ifc : the outer is perhaps called Khan : both Umm-ul-Karam and Khan are excellent havens for native boats, and are used as such by the people of the nearest main land villages. On the north side of the Nakhllu boat passage, already mentioned, begins a narrow strip of sand called Jabrin, which runs north- north-west for six miles and then joins, or almost joins, the mainland. From Nakhilii northwards to Khur Ziarat the coast is a mass of swamps and small creeks, of which little is known. Climate .—The climate of Dashti is accounted good ; both on the coast and inland it is cooler in summer tha'n that of Bushire. Population .—The population of the district between the mountains and the sea, is probably not less then 20,000 souls. The following are the better known tribes of the district:— Name. Approxiate number of souls. Remarks. 'Amranis 600 This tribe is said to have immigrated from the neighbourhood of Suq-ush-Shuiukh in Turkish Tr q. Bahrainis Only a few Chiefly at Daiyir.

Very few Also said to have come from Behbeh^n Mirzaha Not numerous Said to be descended from a family of brothers whose mother was a Saiyid : hence their name 1 lullaha 550 Better educated than their neighbours, but depend on charity for their support. Ruuseh Sadat 1,500 600 The Khan appoints all his deputies from this tribe. Salih Ahmadis .. 150 The Khans of the dynasty preceding the present one were of this tribe. Most of these tribes are of Arab descent but, nearly all are now Shi ahs and speak Persian only. Besides the above there are a number of small and obscure tribes including the Dabashiha, Dehdarha, Kab- ganis, Khanasir, Muhallis, Qaidan, Shaikhani Shaikhha, Tangasir and ’Umruha ; and at some villages, especially on the coast, are found colonies of Arab immigrants from Shlbkuh and elsewhere, who are mostly bi-lingual and Sunnis. J The Dashtis differ from their northern neighbours, the Tangistanis, in being peacefully inclined, partially civilized and comparatively amenable to management. In the larger places their houses are often of stone and mud, but the ordinary villages consist merely of date-frond huts. Mostvillages are, however, defended by one or more bur] tufangcKs, or rifle towers of stone and mud. The greater part of the people are agriculturists or, on the coast, sailors and fishermen ; a few make a living by trade. They have a number of Martini rifles, but on the whole are not so heavily armed as the inhabitants of other districts of the Persian coast. The proportion is about 3 rifles to 5 houses on the coast, and 2 rifles to 3 houses inland. The Dashtis are a healthy, sturdy race, and nearly all labourers and boat- nien at Bushire town are of their number. Vide also Stotherd’s report given in the article on Pars. Agriculture and trade. —The chief crops are wheat, barley and dates ; the date plantations are everywhere watered from wells. There is not the same quantity or variety of fruit as in Tangistan. The water lift used is called charkheh-i-chdhdb, and is worked by a bullock which is made to walk down an inclined cutting in the ground. Cattle are fairly numerous and sheep and goats are kept in great numbers. Trade on a small scale is general, but there is nowhere any large bazaar or mercantile centre, unless the towns of Khurmuj and Daiyir may be so accounted. The exports of the district are cattle, gki, wheat, barley, dates, tobacco, onions, fire-wood, charcoal and earthenware, also some ’abas of local manufacture. Imports are cotton piece-goods, rice, coffee, sugar and tea. The ordinary currency consists of Persians krdns, but the Indian rupee circulates in some of the coast villages. The standards of weight are a local man of 5 lbs. 13 oz. and a Hashim man which is 16 local mans. The chief port is Daiyir. Conimvnications and transport. —The only known routes in the district are a section of the Bushire-Bandar ’Abbas route, which passes through Khurmuj town and leaves Dashti by the gorge of the Mund river ; and a route which runs from Khurmuj town by Kaki, Daiyir on the coast : neither apparently presents any difficulties. Donkeys and camels are available in considerable numbers. Administration. —The Dashti district belongs to Pars, but it is sometimes farmed from the Governor of Pars by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. It is administered by a hereditary Khan, of reputed Arab descent, who has his residence at Khurmuj and became master of the district, after numerous smaller Khans or Shaikhs had reduced themselves to impotence by their internecine feuds. The Khan pays 16,000 tumdns a year for the district of Dashti to the Governor of Pars or the Governor of the Gulf Ports, accord ing to circumstances. There is no organized police force, but the Khan’s personal retainers maintain order on the roads, and village affairs are regulated through the headmen. In the larger places there are some highly respected Mullas, whose decisions in civil disputes are accepted by the people. The land revenue is 50 krdns per gdu (250 x 250 yards), and there is also a date-tree tax of from half a krdn to 2 krdns per tree, besides a poll- tax of 5 to 20 krdns. The last two taxes are unpopular and, in conjunc tion with general misgovernment resulting from the incompetence and great age of the present Khan, have been responsible for much emi gration from the district in recent years. The present Khan is Jamal Khan, son of Haidar Khan, son of Haji Khan, son of Jamal Khan Haidar Khan, the father of the present Khan, died in June 1882 at Bushire, wheresiderable size, but the majority are stunted specimens. It must be of con siderable elevation, as Rich found the night air very cold there even in J uly.— {Rich — MacGregor — Stack.)

Wheat and barley are grown and date palms number 500.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) D ASHT-I-MUAK MI)K (?)— Lat. Long. Elev. A small valley in Ears, about 2 miles long by f mile brpad covered with almond, wild olive and mastich {pana) about half-way between Shiraz and Firuzabad. A solitary fort stands in the middle, recently built for a gar rison of ten tufangchis, who cultivate a little wheat and receive precarious pay. It is watered by a spring, which breaks out of a cleft in the rocks a little to the left of the road to Firuzabad, which passes through it. This stream makes its escape at the farthest end of the dell, and beyond the valley it falls into a ravine, under a huge, precipitous hill.— {Stack.) DASHT-I-NAU—Lat. 32° 5' N. Long. 50° 53' E. Elev. A village in Chehar Mahal district of Isfahan, 2 miles from the foot of the Kuh-i-Sukhteh. It is about 16 miles north-west of Chigha-Khur, situated on the bank of a river of the same name in the Khiar plain. This river originally comes from Gahrud, but receives great accessions from a swamp at the foot of the Kuh-i-Sukhteh, half-way between this village and Shalam zar, another village to the east, and on the left of the road from Chigha- khur. —{Stack.) DASHT-I-SIAH— Lat. Long. Elev. A plain in Ears, on the Firuzabad road to Shiraz from Bushire, and between the former and Farrashband. It is without villages, but the nomads resort to it in winter on account of its mild and agreeable climate, and the springs of good water which exist. Supplies of all kinds may be readily obtained from the nomads.— {Jones.) 112 LB. 2 H242 DAS—DAS DASHTISTAN (Distkict)— A district, natural and physical rather than administrative, of the Ears mainland of Persia, in the vicinity of Bushire : its principal place is Borazjun, situated exactly in the centre of the district and about 28 miles north-east of Bushire town. Limits .—The length of Dashtistan, from Bibara in the north to Chah Kutah in the south, is about 30 miles, and its breadth, which is greatest towards its southern end, averages 10 to 15 miles. On the south Dashti stan reaches to the coast opposite Bushire ; on the west it is enclosed by the districts of Angali and Zira, and on the north-west by the district of Muzara’i ; on the north-east and east it is bounded by hills of which the GIsehkan mountain forms part. Physical characteristics.—^^ whole of Dashtistan, as its name— £ the plain-land denotes, is a plain forming a slight declivity between the moun tains on the north-east and the sea coast on the south-west, a circumstance which determines the direction of the various streams and hollows by which it is crossed. The principal stream is that which passes Dalaki and, uniting with the Bud Shirin, forms the Bud Hilleh river. Of secondary importance is the Ahmadi water-course, which rises in a part of the hills called Bairami and reaches the sea a couple of miles to the east of Shif ; and the Chah Kutah salt stream which pursues a parallel and similar course, a few miles farther to the south-east. The part of the district adjoining the hills enjoys less of the sea breeze, and suffers from scorching winds in summer between the end of May and the beginning of October ; otherwise the climate resem bles that of Bushire, vide also this gazetteer—Bushire and Balaki ‘ ‘climate. ’ ’ Traces of sulphur, bitumen and petroleum occur at the north end of the district. Water nearly everywhere is obtained from wells varying between 30 and 50 feet in depth. These usually contain 4 to 10 feet of water and never dry up. Inhabitants.- Ihe population of the district is exceedingly composite, and amounts to some 15,000 souls j. a majority of the inhabitants appear to be descendants of immigrants from neighbouring Persian States, especially from Dashti and the direction of Shiraz. Deserving of special notice are the Persian tribes of Bag, who inhabit the villages of Jimeh, Khush Ab and Khfnhakan in the centre of the district; they were originally masters of Borazjun but were expelled by the Paparis about two generations ago, and have now sunk to the level of ordinary cultivators. The Papari and Qaidan tribes are noticed in the article on Borazjun, vide this Gazetteer. A few Zanganehs or Zanguis are found, especially at Chah Kutah. This is a Persian tribe of uncertain origin but reputed courage. There are also a number of Arab settlements in the district, of which the most important is a group in the south-east corner, Chah Kutah being the largest; this group is inhabited by Damukh who are a section of the Dawasir of Bahrain, and until recently were all Sunnis. _ Now about f of them are Shi’ahs. Other Arabs, said to be of Bahrain origin, are found north of Borazjun, and Arabs, e ieve o aye come nom the Hindian district occur at three or four scatter ed points. With the exception of the Damukh and a few of the other Arabs the whole population is Persian-speaking and Shi’ahs. Further details ofthe population of each village will be found in the separate descriptions of places given in this gazetteer. Except in Borazjun the dwellings of the inhabitants are nearly all huts. The inhabitants of Dashtistan were describ ed more than two decades ago as very vicious and very warlike. Aqriculture .—The chief staples of Dashtistan are wheat and barley, which are grown in summer, ar d dates. In summer water-melons, musk-melons, cucumbers, maize, cottton, castor-oil, beans, onions, garlic, and sesame are cultivated by irrigation from wells. Livestock is represented by an ordinary proportion of cattle, sheep and goats. The unit of land-measurement is the Gdu or that area of land which requires 6 Haslum man? of seed gram and can be ploughed by one yoke of animals (whether cattle, horses, mu eS or donkeys) in a single day ; it is said to be represented by a square of which th« side is 250 yards. In a good year the return to cultivation m Dashtistan is from 8 to 16-fold. Dashtistan agriculturally resembles Dashti, but it is considered the superior district. The cultivators of Dashtistan are many cf them embarrassed with debts originating in loans taken at exorbitant rates of interest ft r the purpose of buying seed-grain. ^ Trade. Eorazjun is the commercial centre of Dashtistan and the article on it may be consulted for an account of the trade of the district. The standard of weight is not uniform throughout the district, but varies from 10 1 3 20 Tabriz mans of Bushire, being 18 at the important centres of Boraziun and Ckah Ku ah. . ^ i v ^ i Communication s and transfort.—The district contains no natural obstacles. Within it lie the first three stages on the ordinary route from Bushire to Shiraz. The tram p ort resources of the district are estimated at 200 horses, some camels, 350 mu es and 2 ; 500 donkeya. Some quantity of wheat and barlev is purchasable locally, but not as a rule until the prospects of the con nig harvest are assured; until this occurs the stocks m hand are hoarded. Administration.—In the middle of the eighteenth century much of Dash ti an was under the power of Shaikh Nas who ruled in Bushire, and the history of the province seems to have followed more or less the fortunes of that town, vide this gazetteer—Bushire Town. _ In 1888 Dashtistan was placed by the Amin-us-Sultan, under Prince Nash, but later was given to the Governor of Shiraz, and administered by a sartlp acting as_ his deputy. At the pre-ent time (1905) the political organisation of Dashtistan is a patch- work of mare ellous complexity. The bulk of the district is under the Gover nor of Ears: but some of the southern villages, including the group for which the Shaikh of Chah Kutah is responsible, are subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The system of farming the revenues is responsible for further confusion, especially as a certain degree of executive power is always conferred on the ‘ farmer ’ along with the right to collect the taxes, and the more so in the present case that the farmer of the greater part of Dashtistan is the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who has leased it from the Governor of Ears. Nor is the administration of the Governor commonly direct, whether he be actual or titular. Half or more of the villages to the north of Borazjun are held in farm, or, as it is frequently said, as a tiyul or fief, by the Salar-i- ' Mu’azzam. Borazjun and its dependent villages, forming the greater part of the district, are ruled by the Papari Khan of Borazjun^who also collects the revenues, a privilege for which he pays 5,000 tumdns annually; he 1 HS244 DAS—DAS is properly answerable to the Governor of Ears to whose jurisdiction Boraz- jun has always nominally belonged, but n consequence of the farm in favour of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, to which we have alluded, the relations of the Shaikh are at present, it would seem, exclusively with the Bushire Government. The Shaikh of *Chah Kutah, who, in executive charge of that place and of several adjoining villages, is subject, both in theory and in practice, to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. With the exception of a deputy Governor and a telegraph official at Borazjun, who looks after the Persian Government’s telegraph to Bandar Rig and beyond, Dashtistan contains no salaried employes of the Persian Government. The lot of the subjects of the Khan of Borazjun is not a happy one; they are rack-rented and are obliged to yield their master military service whenever he may require it, supply ing their own arms and ammunition. The subjects of the Salar-i-Mu’azzam and of the Shaikh of Chah Kutah are probably little better off, and of late years there has been a good deal of emi gration from the district. The nominal land-revenue averages 50 to 60 krdns per Gdu, but the Khan of Borazjun, at least, endeavours to extort more. The total revenue of the Dashtistan district is said to amount to 10,000 krdns, Rs. 2,500. There is no sort of criminal justice, and civil justice is synonymous with the good offices of Mullas in arranging private disputes. Quarrels between villages are either adjusted by Saiyids or else fought out to the bitter end. The antecedents and position of the Khans of Borazjun and Chah Kutah are described in the articles on those places, and further information regard ing the style of Government and local politics will be found in the article on Bushire, vide this Gazetteer.

A valley in the Pusht-i-Kuh district of Luristan, 96 miles south-west of Kirmanshah town, on the road to Kut-ul-’Amareh. It is the summer resi dence of the Vali of Pusht-i-Ivuh, whose house, a fine brick building, built with corner bastions and loop-holed v.-alls, is the only permanent residence in the valley. The Lurs, retainers of the chief, camp in booths of branches scattered about the plain ; some 2,500 of these booths were observed. Near the house is a garden, 500 yards long by 250 broad, enclosed with a masonry wall 4 feet thick and 15 feet high, with corner flanking towers. It is well laid out with tanks and fountains down the centre, and rows of poplar and willow trees. Vineyards, groves of peaches, apricots, and vegetables grow on either side with some fine walnut trees. At the north side stands the Vali’s principal residence, a square, fortified building, built of brick ana stone, of 50 yards side. The outer walls are 30 feet high, 3 feet thick at the base, and have a small, circular tow T er at each corner. In the centre is a courtyard with a tank. Several suites of rooms open on to this court. Along the wall, on the flat roof, is a double tier of loopholes. The arrangement of these is peculiar ; they are simply slits with no splay at all, the upper tier cut at right angles to the wall, and meant for direct fire , the lower cut alternately slanting in different directions, and meant for oblique fire. The interior of the house is well furnished, and the water-supply, from a large spring at the foot of the hill, particularly good. There is a stable inside for 20 horses. The door of the house is in the south wall and opens into the garden, with a second gateway in the outer wall, defended overhead with a banquette and tier of loopholes. The house and garden had been recently built when visited, and its situation as a stronghold for a feudal chief, in this secluded valley, is w T ell chosen, the Daluva Pass is the only means of crossing the mountains to the north, and that is steep and difficult and might be held by a few resolute men against any number. The route to wards the Mesopotamia plain is also capable of easy deience. To the south east, towards the Kabir Kuh, lies an extremely wild impassable country, full of deep, wooded ravines and crags, while to the north-west towards Zarneh, are a succession of rugged, parallel ridges difficult to cross. The position segms at least secure against anything the Persian Government would care 112 1. B. 21 '250 DEH—DEH to attem^. The valley is igrriated from springs at the foot of the mountain, and grows abundant maize crops. Supplies of rice and wheat are usually brought up from the plains. Large numbers of mules are bred here by the Eaili Lurs.— (Maunsell, August 1888.) DEH BALA (2)— Lat. 31°30'N. Long. 54° 10 E. Elev. A valley, and a village of the same name, in the Yazd district. It lies at the foot of the highest peak of the Shir Kuh to the south-west of Yazd town. The valley is about 6 miles in length and 4 miles in breadth at its south-west or broadest end. It is triangle-shaped, the apex pointing to the north-east. It is a bright valley with terraced fields on either side of a full sparkling stream, and overshadowed with all manner of goodly fruit trees. There is abundant grazing in the valley and an ample supply of fresh water all the year round. Firewood is procurable from the surronding hills. The centre of the valley is full of villages which are surrouunded by gardens, fields and trees. The names of the villages com mencing from the lowest, are :— 1 Baghistun, 2 Tu Deh, 3 Bir Bagh-i-Shah, 4. Mazraeh’-i-Shah ’All, 6. Jumbarazun, 5. Gurukh, 7. Deh Bala. The valley has a permanent population of 2,000 inhabitants, which swell' to 5,000 during the summer months. The flocks and herds number 100 cows and 3,000 sheep ; and the transport animals comprise 250 mules and 300 donkeys. The valley is bounded on the north-west by the Shir Kuh, which rises abruptly for the last 700 or 800 feet in a sheer wall of rock. To the south east lies an impassable spur thrown out by the Kuh Tizarjun, and to the south-west is an impassable off shoot of the Shir Kuh. There is only one road through the valley. This enters the valley at Baghistan through a defile, 200 or 300 yards in breadth, which passes under lofty cliffs. The road leaves the valley by the Gudar-i-Nil Pass, with an elevation of 11,257 feet. This forms a strong position. There are about 50 yards of open ground on the pass, along which is a granite breastwork about 5 or 6 feet thick, through which the road runs. A clear view is obtained of the whole of the narrow valley ahead for 4 or 5 miles. On either side of the pass rise lofty inaccessible hills, rendering it quite unturnable. If the entrances to the pass were forced the defenders would be compelled to retire. There is a good position 1|- miles farther up the valley, where it again narrows ; and there is a precipitous rock, on which is a ruined fort, jutting out into the passable space and reducing it to a couple of dry water courses and a few yards of hilly ground. The valley altogether forms a strong, natural fortress, which contains its own supplies. A post of observation on the Shir Kuh, an outwork to command the track up to it, and men flanking the heights on either side of the lower entrance, would, if the north pass were properly held, render the valley quite impregnable. The mean height of the valley is about 8,000 feet, and any enterprising body of men holding it, might sally outoccasionally and take contributions from Taft, Tizarjbn, Nil, etc., and block tbe roads to Yazd from the south-west.— (MacGregor —— Vaughan, 1890.)

It is a Lur village belonging to the tdifeh Dushman Ziari, and is situated in a valley on the north slope of the Kuh-i-Anar. It contains 40 houses, with a little cultivation and numerous vineyards on the surround ing hills. The country is well wooded with bushes and small trees afford'ng a supply of firewood. The hills around have a reddish tinge. There is good camping-ground and supplies are procurable in small quantities. The water-supply is plentiful.

A village in the district of the same name, in Fars, some 130 miles north- north-west of Shiraz and the 5th caravan stage, and 6th post stage thence on the road to Isfahan. It is a small village of domed huts and a square wall ed garden of poplar trees, in which stands the telegraph station. It stands in a plain which is a favourite camping-ground for Arab and Qashqai nomads, and is surrounded by hills rising from 1,000 to 3,000 feet above the plain. The population numbers only 200. The village is well supplied with water, and, though treeless, is in summer green with crops and grass . A new and spacious caravanserai was completed in 1907. The supplies obtainable here are very limited. Water is good from a spring and small stream. The village is an important station of the Indo-European telegraph company, owing chiefly to the fact of the line being broken almost yearly by heavy snows, this stretch of line marking the highest altitude crossed by it (8,000 feet) between Bushire and Tehran. The company have built a good house with a rest-room for privileged travellers ; and there is an official always in charge. Telephone communication exists to Shiraz and Isfahan. The climate is excellent, though the cold in winter is great, and the place is said to become rather bleak and desolate. Mr. Odling, F.R.C.S., says that the place is in every way fitted for a sanatorium for those requiring a bracing atmosphere after long residence in hot climates, and for convalescents after illness. Were in not for the infectious disease the district might be regarded as remarkably healthy. Smallpox is very prevalent here and is often fatal. One hundred and fifty mans (1,950 lbs.) of grain are sown yearly, 60 tum- dns taxes ; 20 hous s, population 90. In summer large numbers of Arabs come and pitch their tents here and graze their cattle. It belongs to peasant proprietors ; gilims and carpets are woven here. Near the village are the remains of an old mound of the Ghabrs. anDEH—DEH 252 Monthly average of Thermometer Readings for the station of Deh Bid.—May 1881 to August 1882. Years. 1881. 1882. Months.

It is enclosed by a low stone wall on three sides and by a rocky hill on the fourth ; on the hill also are the ruins of stone buildings. All this stone work is rude to the last degree ; yet the people cherish the tradition of some king unknown, who made his pleasure place here. The pool abounds with fish. A branch of the Zindeh Rud has its rise here. It breaks away from the pool in a stream 5 yards broad by 3 feet deep, and joins the river at a short distance.

That of one ascended by Durand in 1878 is about 14,900 feet. Mists and rain upon the summit prevented the position of places below being fixed. Ascent was made with much difficulty, owing to the steep slopes of shingle which have to be surmounted. A camp should be made on the top, in order to explore properly. A great number of sweet and strong-smelling herbs are found on this mountain, the ascent of which is asserted, by the natives, to cause sleep ; hence many Rip Van Winkle stories of persons who have been thus overpowered. Cakes of dried buttermilk are eaten by the natives to counteract the effect of these plants. Snakes are found on the summit.

They are most notorious thieves, and are as barbarous and ignorant as any tribes in the mountains, and it is only through fear of thoir more powerful neighbours, the Bakhtiari, that they are kept in subjection. They muster a few good horsemen and are admirable match- lockmen. They cultivate corn, barley, and rice, and possess large flocks of sheep and goats. They are believed to have originally come from Isfahan, and can muster about 3,000 men.— (Layard.) DlNARWAND— A small subdivision of the Pusht-i-Kuh branch of the Fail! Lurs in Khuzistan.

DIZFUL (District)— One of the two districts into which Northern ’Arabistan {vide this Gazetteer) is divided : the other being Shushtar. The boundary between the two is a line passing between Pavindeh and Kahunak in the north through a point east of Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah in the south. It may also be noted that while the district stretches westward of the Karkheh to the Turkish frontier, the influence of the Persian Government never extends beyond that stream and not always so far. Produce and Trade .—The agricultural and mineral products are the same as in the Shushtar district, with the exception that indigo is grown in place of opium, and may be said to be the principal industry. A certain | number of fruits, such as pomegranates, limes, sweet limes, oranges, apricots and some grapes, are also produced in addition to the melons of the other district ; while bitumen and pitch are not found. The indigo, ' which appears to be exclusively cultivated for use in Persia and not exported to foreign countries, is of three qualities, varying in price from 30 to 60 krdns (Rs. 7-8 to Rs. 15) per Tabriz man, of 6f lbs. The crop is sown in the middle of March and cut 120 days later when about 5 feet high,and 40 days later it is again cut. The best sort of indigo is clear blue, but much of the crops is yellow. The average output is estimated at 3,000 Dizful mans, or about 50,000 lbs. It is said that both soil and climate are exceedingly favourable for its production, and did the people only under stand the preparation better, the produce might be considerably increased for export purposes. As it is, lime and other ingredients are used in its preparation, and the quality accordingly much deteriorated. Other crops of wheat and barley are sown in December and reaped in April ; cotton is also grown somewhat extensively, but the crop is often destroyed by locusts. Imports .—Dizful city is the only centre of trade. Its imported goods may be tabulated as follows :— Obtained from Description of articles. Abroad; through Muhammareh and the Karun. Arabs Bakhtiari Luristan and beyond Shushtar .. .. .. Isfahan Same as in Shushtar district. Wheat, barley, millet, reeds, ghl, curds, wool, sheep, mules and horses. Wool, gum tragacanth and other kinds, tobacco, ghl, curds, charcoal, lime, salt, almonds, dyeing materials, sheep, goats and a few rugs. Firewood, charcoal, ghl, gram, mules, wheat, and pens), barley when required, goats, dried fruits and pistachios, samovars, bran, trays, and leather. Earthenware, silver, soap and petroleum. Stamped cloths, dark cloths for women’s chaddars, katdn (flax cloth), givehs (cotton shoes), and waist cloths. Exports .—The exports, inland and abroad, the latter mostly received at and passed through Shushtar, are :— Exported to Description of articles. Foreign countries. Arabs Bakhtiari Shushtar Wool, linseed, gum, cotton, hides and reeds (for pens.) Same as in Shushtar district. Ditto ditto with addition of mules. Same as for foreign countries : with addition of mules. The neighbourhood of Dizful being recognized as one of the chief centres of mule produce in Persia, its importance in this regard is very great {vide this Gazetteer, “ ’Arabistan—Northern : Produce, Trade and Resources). Coinage and weights are the same as in Northern ’Arabistan ; except that the terms Hazdr or Real are used by preference to denote the Krdn ; and that the Dizful man is equal to 16-969 Iba. avoirdupois. _268 DIZ-DIZ Revenue .—The revenue demand for the whole Dizful district, including that portion gathered in the city, is 26,000 tumdns a year ; of which 4,000 tumdns are assessed on Shaikh Haidar’s section of the Al Kathlr. There is also an impost of 1,200 kharwdrs (each of 650 lbs.) of grain in kind, half in wheat and half in barley, to which Shaikh Haidar’s people do not contribute. N.B. —The tilmdn [krdns 10) varies in value from Rs. 2-8 to Rs. 3. Villages .—Almost all the villages in the Dizful district are constructed to resist sudden attack. They consist of a high enclosing wall, with usual ly only one entrance. Occasionally a two-storeyed building rises above the level of the outer wall and is loopholed. Most of the villages derive their water-supply from qandts or subterranean ducts similar to the Tcdrizes on the Afghan border.— {Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905— Arbuthnot, 1905.) DIZFUL (City)—Lat. 32° 21'; Long. 48° 21'; Elev. 660'. General description .—The city of Dizful in Northern ’Arabistan is situated on the left bank of the Ab-i-Diz, about 20 miles below where that river emerges into the plain after turning the corner round Kaleh Shahid. The site is elevated and somewhat uneven, falling away on the river face in conglo merate cliffs about 100 feet high, the foot of which is washed by the river when in flood. On the left bank these cliffs do not extend beyond the town in either direction, but they are found again on the right bank a short dis tance up stream. Arriving from the east, the town has an extended appear ance, being drawn out along the river bank to a length of about 1| miles, with a depth, inland, of about f of a mile. The houses are closely packed, mostly of two storeys, with flat roofs and many of them provided with sard-dbs. Many are of brick and well built. The streets are narrjw and crooked, with gutters neither paved nor cobbled running down the centre of them. These are used as common sewers and become, in wet weather, rivers of black and putrid filth. Raised side walks, about 18 inches wide, for foot passengers run along the edges, but are as often as not made use of as latrines. In many places on the west side of the town the houses are built on the face of the precipitous cliff, the foundations of the lowest being on a level with the water’s edge, or are built in tiers up from the river bed, which gives the town a very picturesque aspect from the right bank of the river. Several steep, narrow pathways lead from the streets down to the river. In the outskirts of the town the houses are mostly in ruins. Dizful contains 38 mosques and 24 shrines, some of which are Imdmzddehs (tombs of saints) and some Aadamga/is (sanctuaries). The shrines are said to be still used to some extent as places of Bast : the most important are the Imamzadeh of Baba Yusuf, in the south-east corner of the town, and i hat of Sultan Husain, on the left bank of the river above the town, in a suburb called Ruband. A canal called Qanat-i-Gavdul takes off from the left bank of the river between Ruband and the main town. Towards the southern extremity of the town, the river is spanned by an ! ancient bridge of the Sassanian period, 430 yards in length, and built on 24 pointed arches resting on piers. The latter are of large blocks of cut- stone ; the superstructure being of brick, with a road for the most partabout 16 feet wide and roughly cobbled. The parapets in some sections have disappeared. Several of the arches have been swept away within late years and have been replaced by narrower structures ; with the result that a part of the bridge towards the centre has a considerably narrower roadway than the original and the bridge presents an unsightly aspect from a distance. About 400 yards above the bridge a line of mills, 39 in number, run into the river at right angles from the left bank. They are built upon rocks assisted by artificial dams and are connected with each other in some instances by gangways ; and all are liable to be submerged in the spring floods. A permanent canal, known as the Nahr-i-Kilmikk, leaves the liver on the east side below the bridge. The only edifice on the right bank of the river is the palace of Kushk of the Persian Governor-General of ’Arabistan. It is of modern construction, and consists of a rectangular enclosure 500 feet by 300 feet, in which are several buildings. The high enclosing wall is of hiick and has no pretensions as a citadel. The ground about here affords the best camping-ground, of an area practically unlimited. Inhabitants. —The population of Dizful is some 45,000 souls and is in creasing. It has absorbed many heterogeneous elements, and some of the groups into which the inhabitants are formed, bear names or cherish tra ditions indicative of foreign origin. Such are the Jama’at-i-Giveh Kashan who claim to be of Lur extraction : the Afshars, descendants of Nadir Shah : and the Khavanin, who name Changiz Khan as their ancestor. Neverthe less, they have now become fused in one common community and homo geneity of language, customs and dress, and may be said to constitute a type of their own. No Lurs, Kurds or Arab's reside within the fown. The most prominent sections of the inhabitants are the Saiyids, numbering 6,000 and divided into many sub-secf ions : the Tujjar or merchants, who are 500 households : the Mashdikh, some 250 houses ; and the Khavanin, whose num ber of males is estimated to be some 100 houses. The lower orders belong to a poor type ; they are dirty, discontented, unhealthy and ill-favoured in appearance ; many of the better classes are respectable and well-mannered- The only religion is the Shi’ah faith in its standard form, and there are no Babis or ’AU Ildhis or avowed infidel’s. Although bigotted and fanatical in regard to their particular form of religion, they show no signs of hosti lity to strangers—in somewhat marked contradistinction to the attitude of the inhabitants of Shushtar. Trade and Industries. —The religious vocation is practised by a consider able number of persons : the shopkeepers number about 2,000; while the remainder are employed in local industries. The indigo of Dizful, though inferior to that imported from India, enjoys local favour and the annual average output is estimated at 3,000 Eizfuli mans. It is graded in three qualities and fetches 30 to 60 krdns per Dizfuli man. At the present time the indigo works are closed, and the traders have removed their plant on account of the excessive imposts placed by the Sardar-i-Mukarram, the new Governor of Northern ’Arabistan, upon the industry. Agricultural implements, stirrups, bits, horse-shoes, knives, tools, and some rifles are manufactured at Dizful from imported steel and iron : copper is converted into cooking pots; and brass and German silver are used for samovars, pipe270 DTZ—DIZ bowls and for inlaying iron. Floor cloths, 'abas, *elt kulaks (caps), cotton textiles, both plain and striped, for clothing, cotton webbing, woollen 'abas, riding and pack saddles, earthenware, and enamelled pottery, linseed oil, gunpowder, and bullets, lacquered and papier-mache ware, also native soap, are among other local manufactures. Besides those occupied in hand trades, such as stamping and dyeing of cloths, lime pounding, cotton ginning, mak ing cotton shoes, and pr sparing hides for tanning, there are those employed as builders, bricklayers, millers, basket-makers, bath-keepers and butchers. The curious profession of Sacjya deserves mention : he being one who keeps a large number of watch dogs for hire for the protection of flocks or culti vation. The 39 mills already mentioned grind flour and are worked by wood- n water-wheels : though only 12 of them can ply when the water is at its lowest. The charge for grinding is 7 sidh yul and a handful of flour for every Dizfuli man ground. The annual cash earnings of a mill vary from 20 to 50 tumdns, of which half goes to the owner and half to the Persian Government. The owners are people of the town and some of them are exempt from the Government demand. All foreign goods and most goods from a distance are imported from Shushtar or ’Ammareh by the large merchants, and as a rule are deposited by them in their private houses; for, except Messrs. Lynch Bros, and four of the principal merchants, the businessmen of Dizful have no ware houses other than their private residences. The smaller dealers and shop keepers purchase from the larger merchants, and even they do not, as a rule, keep their more valuable goods in their shops. Small shops are found scattered in various streets, but there is also a large bazar which consists of 3 or 4 lines of booths, each row 7 of stalls standing back-to-back with the next; it is always crowded with purchasers from town and country. Caravans from ’Arabistan for Khurramabad start from Dizful. Water and other supplies. —The water-supply is unlimited, and is used not only for domestic purposes, but is also taken off by qandts or subterrannean conduits on both banks above the town. A large supply of grain and meat is always available, and recently (1905) a Persian military force of over 2,000 men has been drawing its supplies from Dizful. Firewood is ob tained from the banks of the Ab-i-Diz below Kut ’ Abd-ush-Shah and from the neighbourhood of the Karkheh : while during floods the supply is in creased by inferior drift wood retrieved from the river. As one of the chief centres of the mule-supply of Persia, Dizful is of the greatest importance. It is estimated that 300 camels and 1,000 mules with professional drivers could, in ordinarily favourable circumstances, be obtained at Dizful on short notice. For Major Arbuthnot’s report (1905) on the subject, vide this Gazetteer—’Arabistan, Northern. The surrounding country is remarkable for its beautiful herbiage in spring time; and the weaving prairies flushed with red poppies, both between the rivers Diz and Karun, as well as west- west-wards towards Shush and the Karkheh, may be literally described as “ sight for the sore eyes ” of travellers arriving from the deserts of ’Arabistan or the barren mountains of Central Persia. Administration. —The business of Persian Government at Dizful is carried on by a Deputy Governor, who is usually also the telegraph master, with a staff of two mirzds or clerks and four farrdshes or orderlies. The real power,DIZ—DIZ 271 however, is in the hands of the religious leaders of the community, the most important of whom a ! ’e the Mujtahids, without whose countenance the civil authorities find it difficult to get their orders carried out. Thus Lur or Arab chiefs, who may have reason to distrust the intentions of the Persian Gover nor, will only obey his summons to appear if it is accompanied by a safe conduct from the chief of the Mujtahids. The most influential of these is Agha Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, Hujjat-ul-Islam (1905), aged 70 years. His son and grandson, aged 47 and 17 years, respectively, are Agha Shaikh Muhammad Bakir and Sadr-ud-Din. The next most important Mujtahid families are those of Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, aged 70 years, and Agha Shaikh Muhammad Riza, a nephew of the chief Mujtahid. The supreme power is in the hands of the chief Mujtahid, who has shewn himself friendly and polite in his dealings with the representative of the British Government. The Mujtahids are the dispensers of public charity ; and collect and distrb bute the zakdt, or alms, prescribed in the Koran, but some part at least of these does not reach those for whom it is intended. There are 27 schools in Dizful, in which reading, writing, and religious subjects are taught. Some are kept by mullds, while others are held in the houses of the Mujtahids; that of the chief Mujtahid being attended by 150 to 200 pupils. There is also at Dizful an official called the Imam Jum’eh, whose office is virtually hereditary and at present a sinecure; he is supposed to lead the Friday prayers in the principle mosque, but this function has fallen into abeyance. The appointment was originally ecclesiastical, but the recog nition of the Persian Government has rendered it semi-secular.

A village in Fars, 36 miles from Kangan on the road to Firuzabad, from which it is 60 miles distant. There is a small fort here, and the place has some date-groves. No supplies are procurable and the water from the stream is brackish ; sweet water is to be had from wells. {Jones.) DIZ-I-ARJANAK— Lat. 33° 8' N. Long. 49° 36' E. Elev. 7,100'. A mountain stronghold in the Bakhtiari country north of the Kaleh Kuh range, and owned by the ’Isawand section of the Bakhtiari tribe. The valley in which the celebrated stronghold is situated is a most remarkable canon cut 800 feet below the neighbouring heights, which themselves are but the level of the main valley. The cadon has perpendicular cliffs, 500 feet to 800 feet of conglomerate imbedded in clay almost as hard as stone, and about 1,200 yards apart. At the bottom is a torrent well lined with willows and occa sional grassy banks. The “ Liz ” is situated in the perpendicular rock behind272 DIZ—DIZ the hamlet, and consists of half a dozen scooped out shelves in the face of the cliff, the largest 12 feet deep (into the rock), 10 feet high, and 20 feet (along the face of the rock), the front being protected by breast-high, loopholed, rubble walls about 6 to 9 inches thick. These several cavities are accessible only by difficult tracks in the face of the rock, and always open to view. There is no inter-communication in the rock itseT or hidden f 'om view. One of the chief advantages of which it boasts, is a perennial spring situated in one of these natural or semi-artificial caves, but, like all the other places of refuge, all access to it is open to view. The several places are said to be able to hide 50 to 150 men, and the “ Biz ” is considered impregnable. A direct assault would perhaps be costly of life, unless the fire, often unseen, had first been thororghly subdued ; but it is needless to say that one mountain gun could from the opposite side clear out each of these caverns with one well-directed shell. The range is everything desired, and the places are most beautifully indicated by every upper portion beirg black ened by smoke. The stronghold is a shell trap and rat hole, nothing more nor less.— (Saivyer, 1890.) DIZ-I-SHlHl or KALEH-I-DIZ-Lat. Long. Elev. A stronghold in Southern Luristan situated near the Ab-i-Diz and about 18 miks north-east of the town, in the possession the Duraki division of the Ha r t Lang Bakhtiaris. It is remarkable plateau about 12 miles in circumference, crowning the summit of a lofty hill nowhere le s than 150 feet high, the sides of which are almost perpendicular and ony to be ascend ed by a steep and difficult pathway, which may easily be defended or perhaps totally destroyed. As water ir abundant on it, and flocks have been conveyed to the summit of the Diz, villages have been built on this tableland and form the ordinary place of residence of the Duraki tribe. The soil is rich and under cultivation, producing grain of various kinds, suffi cient to withstand a prolonged siege. McSwiney visited it in 1891, and describes it as a natural stronghold, being a plateau about 4 miles square on the summit of a hill with perpen dicular sides of 200 feet. The highest part of the hill is 2,560 feet above sea-level. As there are no higher hills nearer than a radius of from 8 to 10 miles, it cannot be commanded by artillery. From its summit, a clear view can be obtained of the town of Dizful, distant some 11 or 12 miles. The summit is only reached by a zigzag path partly cut in the face of the cliff, and partly built out on stakes driven in the'face of the hill with brushwood laid on them, which can be easily destroyed by being thrown down or set fire to, thus cutting off all access to the summit. Water is obtainable from several springs. Grazing is said to be good till the end of April. There is no fuel. Supplies in winter could be obtained in considerable quantities from the plain of Duma Kha,i\.—(Layard--McSwiney, 1890.) DIZ MALIKAN— Lat. Long. Elev* A fort in Luristan in the Bakhtiari mountains to the north of the Karun river, north-east of Shushtar, 56 miles. It is a mass of rock, about 3 miles in circumference, which rises out of the centre of a vast basin formed by lofty surrounding hills, and whose perpendicular sides overtop the neigh bouring mountains. From the bottom of these cliffs the detritus slopesrapidly to a considerable distance, and even the cliffs themselves cannot be approached if this slope be in any way defended. The cliffs are naturally inaccessible. The rock is a conglomerate in which a limestone, abound ing with small fossil shells and ammonites, is chiefly conspicuous. The summit has only one accessible point, and that can be defended without difficulty, even by one person, when the approaches are not destroyed. The ascent is made by a very long ladder and small steps, or rather holes, cut in the rock. W hen this ladder is removed, all communication with the summit is cut off. The Diz is divided into upper and lower. The ascent from the lower to the upper is equally precipitous and difficult. The lower Diz consists of a small platform on which there are three springs of water and a few huts. This is the usual residence of the chief. The upper Diz is without water, except that which may be collected in reser voirs during the winter rains. It contains a few acres of good arable land, which are frequently under cultivation. About 3,000 lbs. of seed may be raised without artificial irrigation. Sheep and goats have been conveyed to the summit, and beasts for the plough, when needed, are raised by ropes. It is not extraordinary that a natural-fort of such strength should have defied the regular troops of Persia for centuries. There is little doubt but the summit might be reached by shells and the crops easily destroyed. The approach, however, to the Diz from every quarter is exceedingly difficult, and the mountain passeshnight, if defended with skill and courage , be held against any number of men. The springs in it are not abundant, and are probably incapable of supplying any large body of men. Wheat and other necessaries are always kept in store, and several flocks find pasture on the summit: so precipitous are the cliffs that even the mountain goats cannot descend them. It belongs to the Baidarwand division of the Haft Lang Bakhtiari. It is also called Diz Azad Khan.— {Layard.\ DIZ MARDAN— Lat. Long. Elev. A hill fort in Ears, near Behbehan.

DU PULAN— Lat. 31° 53' N. Long. 50° 42'E. Elev. 4,850'. A village in the Bakhtiari country, the 6th stage from Isfahan (100 miles) on the Bakhtiari caravan road. It is situated on the left bank of the Ab-i- Sabz Kuh or Tang-i-Siah, about a quarter of a mile above its junction with the Karun river. It derives its name from the two bridges which here cross the Ab-i-Sabz Kuh and Karun rivers. The former river, which has a strong swift current, is crossed by a ricketty structure of piles and wicker work. The stream itself is fordable, just above its junction with the Karim, being there 30 yards broad and two feet deep (August) with easy banks and a firm, stony bottom. Farther up, it is only 6 or 7 yards broad, with a swiit current and unfordable. ThebridgeovertheKarun,closetothecdravaw- serm and about J mile distant from the village, consists of a single-pointed arch of burnt brick, with a span of 12 yards, a road-way 11 feet broad, and v alls 2 feet high. The arch is 6 feet thick at the crown, The approaches to it are difficult for any but pack animals and its camber is excessive. The bridge was built in 1900 by Isfandiar Khan, Sardar of the Bakhtiaris, and is in good repair. The river here flows 60 feet below, hrough almost perpendicular walls of rock, and is about 10 yards wide. In flood the water- level is about 20 feet hi her than this (August). Up stream are the remains of an old rubble bridge on the same level. Down stream are the remains of another built by the father of Isfandiar Khan in 1880. It fell in 1900. Additional suspension bridges could be made at any part for 200 yards down stream from the present bridge. The bridge is faced at 1,200 yards down stream by a good artillery position oii the same level, beyond the Ab-i-Sabz Kuh junction, and commanded from the road and ridge to the east at ranges up to 3,500 yards. There are artillery positions to either side of the bridge ; to the left, 30 to 40 feet above, and to the right, 40 to some hundreds of feet, both on rocky ground. The hills and gorge up stream are inaccessible. The village of Du Pulan belongs to the Cha’ab us-Saltaneh. The cdravdn- 8 rai is in good repair, but is kept in a filthy condition. Supplies are limited, but under ordinary circumstances sufficient for 50 men and 200DUP-DUR 277 animals for one day. Firewood in plenty is obtainable, and water is good and abundant. The village is deserted in summer, when supplies for men would probably be nil. The following statistics with regard to population, stock, etc., have been obtained:— House 1 . Population.

V PillFAI—FAI 283 has its own particular head, or Tush mat, who acknowledges no other autho rity than that 01 the fehah, when he is able to enforce it. It is owing to this circumstance, and to their residing in the vicinity of the large towns of JYirmanshah, Burujird, and Khurramabad, that the tribes of the Pish Kuh aie more under the control of the Government than those of the Pusht- i-Kuh ; while the latter recognise the authority of the Vail of Luristan, the former are placed under a local Governor sent either from Kirmanshah or Isfahan. The four tribes of the Pish Kuh are generally at war with each T-l ^ re notor ^ ous f° r their plundering propensities, particularly the Dilfan and the Silah Silah. The country they inhabit can seldom be traversed with safety either by single travellers or caravans. The tribes ° yl 6 ^ s ht-i-Kuh are under a Yah, whose ancestors were the chiefs of all the h am Lurs.^ Lur-i-Kuchak was formerly included in the Govern- ment of Kirmanshah, but it is now in that of Isfahan. The usual residence ^ e . ^ ove y n °r ot the Pish Kilh is either at Khurramabad or in the plain of Saimarreh. It is very difficult to form a correct estimate of the forces that can be raised from Lur-i-Kuchak. The Vail may probably be able to collect between 4,000 and 5,000 men, of whom 500 or 600 are horsemen. The gross amount of armed men that might be raised in Luristan may, perhaps, be between 4,000 and 5,000 horsemen and 20,000 matchlockmen. • The Faili pretend to_ have more respect for an oath and to be less blood thirsty than their neighbours, the Bakhtians, but there is really little difference in this respect. The Faili supply the towns of Kirmanshah, Hamadan, Burujird, and Khurramabad ^with charcoal. They also, particularly the Dilfan sections, possess a very fine breed of mules, which are much esteemed in Persia, being large, strong, capable of carrying great weights and enduring much fatigue.—(Zkw/ard.) The Yivativ ands and Muminawands supply at present a body of 350 infantry to the Crown. The Pish Kuh are assessed at 40,000 tumdns. The distribution of this sum of 40,000 tvmdns varies yearly, and it is impossible therefore to give the details. The ’Amaleh tribe, however, who are offsets of all the other tribes, and were employed by the former Valis as their immediate servants, are very lightly charged, the cultivation of the Crown lands being accounted in lieu of taxation. The Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh has the sole direction of his own revenues, and claims to account personally with the Kirmanshah Government for the assessment of his district. The Bajilan and Bairanawand tribes are refugees of th' last century, from the vicinity of Mosul. They are lightly taxed, having to furnish a body of 1,200 horse to the Crown. The Huliani tribes are now usually included in Kirmanshah. They furnish 500 infantry. The ’Amaleh are Deh-Nishins, who cultivate the Khaliseh or Crown lands at Khurramabad, Saimarreh, Tirhan and Kuh Dasht. They do not migrate at all. The total assessment of the Faili Lurs is given as 60,000 tumdns. 2N20 284 FAI—FAI The most recent account of the Failis is by Lieutenant-Colonel Bell in 1884, who, in addition to what has been ascertained by former authorities, reports as follows :— . , 7 7 _ •?- r Lur-i-Kuchah, occupied by the Faiii Lurs. The tribes occupying the Lur-i-Kuchak are generally known as the Faiii, and are sub-divided into the Pish-Kuh (north of the Kabir Kuh) and Pusht- i-Kuh (south of the Kabir Kuh). . . , M oo * -r The Pish-Kuh are divided into four principal tribes—33,000 families in all.— (Layard, 1846.) . ., ., Each tribe has its chief, who exercises unlimited authority over its mem bers ; under him are tushmdls, or chiefs of families, who are responsible for the collection of the revenue, and for the good order and allegiance of those placed under their care. The chief himself accounts with the ^ The members of a tribe hold their chief in great respect, and are, as a rule, observant of his wishes. _ _ •j -li He in turn considers their welfare, and. their tushmdls have considerable influence in the general government. The tribe must, when the occasion demands it, arm and follow their chief in his wars. . The inferior members of a tribe show their allegiance by kissing the hand of their chief. The chief will embrace men of influence. .... When a darbdr is held, men of a certain standing sit ; those of inferior quality stand round about ; all freely give their opinions and advice, but in a quiet, orderly and respectful manner, prefacing their remarks by “ May I be allowed to say,” etc. ^ . The district has no supreme chief, and is under a local governor who resides at Khurramabad, and is, at present, within the jurisdiction of the Government of Isfahan. r x-u r ir- - Widely speaking, they inhabit the hills to the south of the line Kirman- shah, Khurramabad, Tang-i-Bahrain to the Kabir Kuh, and have as east and west boundaries the rivers Dizful and Karkheh They graze their flocks on both banks of the latter river and on the plains bordering the foot of the Kabir Ki h. Through these hills runs the main commercial artery of the country, viz., the road Muhammareh, Dizful, Khurramabad, Burujird, Sultanabad, Kum, Tehran, and along their front, an important transverse line by the valleys of the Dizful (Burujird branch), Kamand-Ab, and Zmdeh Uud (Afhiis branch) connects Kirmanshah with Isfahan. The Pusht-i-Kuh tribo is under the chieftainship of the descendants of Hasan Khan, their last powerful Vail. They are at enmity amoI1 g st themselves, and intrigues to gain precedence have led to many blood-feuds. The government does not desire that there should be union amongst the tribes, nor does it exert itself to bring them into proper subjection, several of them are generally in open rebellion, and small parties of Lurs even cannot pass through their territory with impunity. # .. . Of the three sons of Hasan Khan mentioned by Layard as having divided the tribes amongst them on the death ^ iefs * of their father, Haji ’All Khan now enjoys the chief authority, principal adherents being the Sagwand subdivision of the Bajilan tribe ; the pretensions of Haidar Khan, the third son, to inherit the title of his father, were upheld by the Persian Governor of Luristan, whereupon the elder brothers, ’AH Khan and Ahmad Khan, took refuge with the Assyrian Arabs on the Turkish frontier.— (DeBode.) Eventually, two or three years back, such is the instability of all things Lur, Sartip Haidar Khan of the Bairanwand was put to death by the Gov ernor of the district, after having been invited to Khurramabad to receive favours of the Shah ; his sons follow in the wake of ’AH Khan, but are in no way attached to him, and consider that their misfortunes have been his opportunity. Of these young men the elder is by no means a prepossess ing youth ; the younger, quite a boy, has a face which attracts by reason of its look of quiet melancholy and resignation. They frequently visited Major Bell and related to him their misfortunes, under the idea that he was a Sartip in the service of the Shah, whose good offices at Tehran might have served to bring them again into favour. At the time when the party were treated with little consideration by Haji ’AH, they offered tent room and hospitality. The Agent of the Zill-us-Sultan with the tribe, not much liked by Haji ’AH, advocated their rights, so it is quite possible that a tarn of the wheel of fortune may yet bring these lads into prominence. Ahmad Khan, the second son, has a considerable following, and is at enmity with his brother for like reasons, and in rebellion against the government. The chief of the Lurs about Kirmansht his Husain Quli Khan, a lawless chief ; in fact, anarchy reigns at the present time throughout Lur-i-Kuchak. The following is an account given of the Lur-i-Kuchak by Mr. Schindler, 1877. Mr. Schindler was in the service of the Shah and had good oppor tunities of gaining information. He states that there are 36 villages in Luristan ; that the total assessment of the Pusht-i-Kuh and PIsh-Kuh is 64,000 tumdns, and the total number of families of the PIsh-Kuh is 39,550. He does not estimate the strength of the Pusht-i-Kuh. The boundaries of the PIsh-Kuh are the Silakhur valley, the Bakhtiari country, the Dizful river, the Karkheh river, the province of Kirmanshah and the districts of Kangavar and Nahivand. The PIsh-Kuh are divided according to their summer quarters as below :— ° Families.

Rawlinson’s estimate was (1836) 15,000 families and Layard’s (1846) the same. Schindbr gives no estimate of the Pusht-i-Kiih, and his enumeration ot tile 1 ish-Kuh would seem to be imperfect. There is no doubt, how ever, that internecine wars and famines, an extortionate government etc. have caused them to diminish in numbeis, and not to increase. ’ AH KMn estimated that the Lurs numbered in all about 150,000 men. His estimate is valueless. Assuming that the Lurs in Lur-i-Kuchak number 50,000 families, and allowing five souls per familv its population would number 250,000. This fairly coincides with the estimate given on page 39 in Bell’s work on South-West Persia.

To open the Karun to navigation, and the roads through Lunstan to commerce, is, to the mind of the Shah to give the foreigner a footing in Shushtar and Dizful, to enrich the Lurs and Arabs, and to strengthen a part of the country still unsubdued and occupied by alien races and but scantily by Persians.—— 288 FAI—FAI FAILlEH— Lat. 30° 28/ N.

The part of the town on the left bank is surrounded by a dilapidated stone wall, which encloses as well as houses a large amount of marsh. Therefore it is not surprising that this is con sidered the most unhealthy town of ’Arabistan. About 250 mud houses and 130 shops compose the town.

FALLAHIEH DISTRICT— The most central of the districts of Southern ’Arabistan, having on the south-west the district of Muhammareh and on the north the district of Ahwaz, on the north-east the Jarrahi district, on the south-east Ma’shur and on the south the Khur Musa and the open sea. Boundaries. —The border of the district begins on the sea at the mouth of Khur Silaik and follows that creek to Qubban. Then the boundary is the Salmanleh canal until some marshes near the Karun are reached ; it then runs more to the north than before and passes in succession by Maqtfl’ and ’ Ataishi to a locality named Khuwaiseh where there is some rising ground. The line then turns eastward*and goes by way of Qusaibeh, at the right bank of the Jarrahi river just below the village of Qarqar. Crossing the river it continues in a south-easterly and then in a southerly direction. It passes by ’Aquleh, a spot 8 miles west of Ma’shur, and finally reaches the Khur Musa near the point where that inlet breaks up into the two Khurs of Dauraq and Ma’shur. Physical geography, climate .—The Jarrahi, which runs through the middle of the district, is bordered by a belt of canal-irrigated cultivation. Outside this cultivation are at the eastern end of the district flat, alluvial plains, which are waterless except after rain. On the north of the Jarrahi, on the borders of the Ahwaz district, there are large swamps both to the east and the west of Gharaibeh. 112 LB. 2 04 FAL—FAL 290 In the damp parts the heat in summer is almost intolerable, and mosqui toes abound to an almost incredible extent.

One of the divisions of the Isfahan province, with an area of 1,000 square miles, situated at the back of the south-western ridge of the mountains of Khwansar, consisting of several plains with a mean elevation of 7,800', en closed by ranges of high mountains. Faridan is entered on the east by the Isfahan-Burujird road, about 74 miles from Isfahan, near Dumbnai at the northern end of the Qahlz plateau and on the slopes of the Kuh-i-Dalan, and extends to the north-west as far as or a little beyond Chehar Chashmeh, joining the Burbarud district of Burujird. To the west it extends to the northern slopes of the Zardeh Kuh range, where is situated the Parsisht plateau with the ruins of Parsisht (a former city ?), called Puasisht by some. On the north and east Faridan joins the Gulpaigan and Khwansar districts, on the south the Linjan district. In it rise the head-waters of one of the principal tributaries of the Zindeh Rud and those of the Karaj Rud, which flows to Gulpaigan. On its hills grows the manna-bearing tamarisk [Tamarix mannifera), which supplies the manna from which the best Isfahan “ Gaz ” is made. The tamarisk in Persian is gaz, its, manna is gaz Angahin i.e., tamarisk-honey, and the Isfahan gaz is made of manna, flour, almonds, etc. Faridan is peopled by Georgians and Armenians brought here by Abbas the Great in the 17th century and by Bakhtiari. The former, residing in the Gurji [i.e., Georgian) sub-district (principal place Akhureh-i-bala, with 350 families), and amounting to about 1,000 families, profess the Muhamma dan faith, but some of them still speak Georgian. The yearly taxes of the Gurji sub-district with 19 villages, amount to 18,334 Jcrdns. The Armenians of the Faridan, rather more numerous than the Georgians, occupy 9 villages (these are government property) altogether and 16 villages partly. They have about a dozen churches which form part of the Julfa (Isfahan) diocese. The 9 villages form a separate administrative sub-district, called Khaliseh Armina Nishin [i.e., state domains where Armenians reside), and are taxed in the government lists to the amount of 23,621|- Jcrdns per annum. The Bakhtiari of the district number about 1,200 families; altogether Faridan has a population of about 18,000 to 20,000 souls. The total amount of taxes exacted from the district294 FAR-FAR by the central government is 92,284 krdns — Rs. 36,914 ; the local Govern* ment probably takes double that amount. The Governor of Faridan gene rally resides at Daran, a little town with about 300 houses. The district is sub-divided into five sub-districts, the chief being Buin, Afhus, Akhureh and Mian-Dasht. The northern Chinarud ; only village standing, Kaj, all others ruined. The western, the Gurji with 20 villages ; the southern, Chadu- gan, with 50 villages ; chief place Chadugan ; other villages : Mashhad, Ahan- gazan, Sharshagun and Jammalu. The central, Varzak with 30 villages, principal being Daran, Ganj eh and Dumbanl. And the Tukhmanlu with 30 villages, principal ones being Tukhmanlu, Hindukush, Shahanaiat Zarneh, Sangbaran and Nimagird ; 131 villages altogether.— (Schindler .) FARRASHAH— Lat. Long. Elev. A village situated in a narrow valley between ’Aliabad and Taft, near the western road from Shiraz to Yazd, and 21 miles from the latter. The village is owned by Mu’in-ul-Mulk and is divided into three mahallehs (parishes). It contains 100 houses, population 500 ; 6,500 lbs. of grain are sown yearly and there are numerous gardens ; eight jaribs are watered by qmdts in 24 hours ; 140 tumdns paid yearly in taxes.— {Schindler.) FARRASHBAND— Lat. 28° 50' N. Long. 52° 7' E. Elev. 2,400'. A village in Ears, about 63 miles south-east of Kazarun, 84 miles east of Bushire, and 30 miles west of FIruzabad. It is a large village embosom ed in palm-groves and situated in the plain of the same name. This plain runs in a direction north-west and south-east, and is said to be about 30 mil* s in length, by 4 miles in breadth. It has a fort and 800 huts. Its soil is generally very free from stones, and its surface is extensively cultivated. It is a fine tract, but so ill-watered as to depend for moisture almost entirely on rain. This being uncertain, the produce of the field varies greatly; wheat and barley seem alone to be raised. The land is never manured or left fallow ', but when new plots are cultivated, the produce is said to be as high as 30-or 40-fold, though in ordinary cases on old ground it would only be 10-or 12-fold. There are about 5 or 6 villages in this plain, which on the south is bounded by Dashti and on the north-west by Kuh Marreh. It was formerly a well-inhabited tract, and furnished a consider able military contingent, but from various causes it has declined since the reign of Karim Khan, Zand. Considerable supplies are procurable here, as well as cattle for slaughter and burden ; the latter chiefly asses. Rice, fuel and ghi can be procured from the nomads in the vicinity. Jones says good water is procured from hill springs, but Abbott remarks on the want of water. There is good pasturage for cattle round here. A road branches off from this place to Shiraz via Girl, by which in the war of 1856 the Persians brought down 12-pounder guns. (Abbott—Felly— Jones.) # . Farrashband is one of the great grazing districts of Persia, and there art considerable herds of cattle, in which a trade has sprung up of late.— (Durand.) The town belongs to the Mashir, and was formerly a much more import ant place than it is at present. Tradition has it that it used to stretchalong the foot of the KQh-i-Nissar, which is south-west, for about 15 miles. There are some ruins which give some colour to this very doubtful state ment. —( Duran d.) FARS or PAKISTAN Province— A southern province of Persia and one which, both in name, history and population, has the best_right to be regarded as Persia Proper and as the central hearth-stone of Iran. Extent. —The boundaries of Pars are as hard to define accurately as its administrative arrangements. The province may be taken approximately as lying between 27° 20' and 31° 41' latitude, and 50° 10' and 55° 15' longi tude, and having the shape of a quadrilateral, each side of which is about 220 miles. The superficial area is said to be 44,335 geographical miles. Starting from a point a few miles north of Bandar Dilam on the coast of the Persian Gulf, the western boundary coincides first with the limits of the Hindian district of ’Arabistan. From about the junction of lati tude 31° with longitude 50° it turns north-east, separating the Qashqai country, which it includes, from the land of the Bakhtiari, and passing the northern point of Kuh-i-Dinar and including Basaki, meets the southern frontier of Iraq’Ajami on the Isfahan-Shiraz road a short distance south of Aminabad, and half-way between that village and Yazd-i-Khast. In denting to the north and then turning south-east the boundaries of Pars and Iraq ’ Ajami coincide, until Abrquh is passed and the province of Iraq Ajami gives way to that of Kirman, whose western boundary meets that of Pars, some miles west of Isfinabad in the Icavir or sand desert. The joint boundary now runs south-east to Abu Bakr, where the most northern point of the Laristan Province is met. Turning south-west to Niriz and then slightly eastward to Darab, the remainder of the east ern boundary of Pars is co-terminous with the western limit of Laristan ; the same district accompanies Pars on the south, as the southern boundary now runs west and slightly south to Jahrum, finally turning more south ward and meeting the coast of the Persian Gulf about Tahiri in the Shib Kuh District of the Persian Gulf Ports. The southern boundary thence forward is the Persian Gulf, which, turning the promontory formed by the Nakhilu shoal and Jabrin island, turns north-north-west past Bushire and Bandar Rig, and returns to its starting point north of Bandar Dilam. In the southern boundary, however, are included the two islands of Kharak and Khargu, which lie in the Persian Gulf off the coast of the Haiat- Daud District. Physical Geography.—Pax* may be divided, physically and climatically, into two divisions, the Garmsir and the Sardslr, or the lands of the warm climate and the cold climate. The former is the tract which extends from the sea coast to the latitude Garmsir. of K ^ zarGn &gt; an d runs parallel to the Persian Gulf from the banks of the Hindian river to the confines of Laristan. This includes the Dashtistdn, or plain land at the foot of the mountains. These lands are entirely dependent upon the periodical rains, and, when the latter prove abundant, yield a good por tion of dry grain; but when there is a failure in the rains, which296 FAB-FAR unfortunately happens too often, the produce is so deficient that a famine generally ensues. The greatest part of the Garmsir is divided between the district of Liravi, Haiat Baud, Rudhilleh, Angah, Shabankareh, Zireh, Muzaran, Dashtistan, Tangistan and Dashti, which are all described in detail in this Gazetteer. ^ , , The Sardslr includes most of the mountainous parts of bars, extend - ing from the latitude of Kazarun to that of s Sardslr. ^ town of Yazd-i-Khast. These mountains forma succession of parallel ridges, running from north-west to south east and intersected by plains. The plains seldom exceed 8 or 10 miles in breadth but vary in length from 15 to 150 miles. They are, in general, fertile afford abundance of pasturage, and are not so deficient in water as is commonly supposed ; and it is the want of population and the little encouragement given to industry which alone retard their improvement. A few of these plains, such as those of Shiraz, Kazarun and Marvdasht are however, tolerably well cultivated, but they are, for the most part, and narticularly to the north and west, destitute of inhabitants. Between Behbehan and Shiraz there are upwards of 60 miles of the most delightful vallevs covered with wood and verdure, but all is solitary not the face of a human being was anywhere to be seen. These valleys had been possessed bv an ancient tribe which, in consequence of their licentious conduct, had bL nearly extirpated by the orders of the prince, and the few that survived had taken refuge on the summits of the loftier and most inaccessible lunS.wJre they subsisted on a wretched kind of bread made from “corns, and, from thence sallying forth, infested the roads and rendered travelling extremely dangerous. , ,. The great range of mountains seen from the coast ,s a mere prolongation of the chain of Mount Zagros, not a separate range, but connected with that mountainous-tract which extends, in a continued succession of ridges torn the CaspainSea and the Caucasus, to the borders of the Py ™' De Morgan in his “ Mission Scientifique En Perse’ points out that these mountais wore once connected, where now are the straits of Hormuz, with t“e Ruys-ul-Jabal Mountains of Arabia, and that what we know now as islands Hormuz, Larak and Tavileh for example, are but the peaks of thiTsubmerged range which once formed the connecting link between the two countries. The same authority says, “The farther one gets from the sea°(Persian Gulf) the higher rise the mountains, and their peaks have the appearance of being placed one on top of the other ; and when the cold weather grips the Persian plateau, the back ground is covered with snow, what time the coast line is still being scorched by a blazing sun. The folds Ire regular and separated one from another by narrow and wild va e^s where running water is non-existent. The water found in the wells is generally brackish and of execrable quality. cm- -n, d n«cm g Regarding the country from Bushire to Jehrum, Stotberd (1893) ^Ale™! sandy strip of over 30 miles broad, studded with date planta- A level, s y p ^ ^ runs a i ong the coast near Bushire, only General character of country broken by one long ridge beginning near Gurak and following in direction the main mountain system, of which itFAR—FAR m »w as s of utile n to iki i* is an outlying part. The mountain ranges have a uniform direction of north-west to south-east. They are bare and rocky, and rise higher in successive ranges inland from the sea, the altitude of the intermediate valleys also increasing the farther they are from coast. The country is very sparsely populated, about 15 miles being the average distance between villages, while in some cases it is over 20. Numerous ruins show signs of a former prosperity; but at the present day there is very little that is not desert. There are no trees, and only a few scattered thorn bushes in places, and nothing much else in the way of vegetation, except that after the rains there is a crop of grass which is much scorched up by the middle of May, though still affording a certain amount of grazing. The most fertile part of this section is the plain of Firuzabad, .which is well-watered and fairly populous, though for the last five or six years suffering from swarms of locusts. Every village, however small, has a patch of cultivation around it, the intervening country being desert. It is almost superfluous to say that, except on the strip of plain near Military capabilities. the sea coast there is no ground in this district suitable tor the use of a cavalry force of a large size, even if supplies were procurable ; at the same time, as long distances have to be traversed, very effective work could be done by one or at the outside two regiments of cavalry with machine guns, employed on detached duties, or pushed forward in small bodies to seize and hold passes with dismounted fire. Even one regiment would be frequently delayed by the badness of the road in the passes, where there is scarcely room for single file and no ground for action to either hand. Small parties could obtain sufficient supplies, and water for horses is almost always available, in some places brackish, but it would suffice to get horses or transport animals along, though not good for keeping them in condition. The country also affords a certain amount of grazing, but the grass is much scorched up during the hot months. Limited supplies of barley and bhusd are procurable at most villages. A few good horses suitable for remounts can be had , but the main centres of horse-breeding are farther north in the higher and colder regions. Field artillery would be in constant difficulties owing to the badness of the road. Wherever the map shows the track crossing ranges of hills, it may be taken for granted that there is a rough, rocky defile to be traversed. If the guns were required to act about here, positions could be obtained covering the mouths of defiles, etc., but the higher ground is, as a rule, in accessible owing to the rocky and precipitous nature of the hill sides. There is no doubt that artillery would produce a great moral efiect on the natives of these parts. Infantry would find the marches very long, 16 miles about in this country being considered a short'.march (this is caused by the want of water); but it is the only arm that could act efficiently in ma ny of the places, the face of the country being so rugged and broken as to be possible only to a man on foot. Food-supplies cannot be counted on for anything over a brigade at Supplies. an T pl ac es except Fiiuzabad and Jehrcm. Supplies for a m ixed brigade could be collected for one or perhaps two days at most villages, always supposing the i 112 IB, 2P298 F AR—E AR inli^bitants to be friendly, as witbeut their co-operation foraging parties would have the greatest difficulty in obtaining anything; but, as above stated, both the ruler^ and penple oi, this district seem disposed, to. be friendly, and their assistance could be secured by presents to the Khans and judicious treatment, of the people, Ei el and water-supply are scanty and, bad in plapes (for particulars see road report), “ Very little .transport obtainable except asaes, of which there are apy number, small but hardy little beasts, i-ansport. ^ a y era g e j oa( ^ j[p r one 0 f them is less than half a mule-load- “ This distripf, in.no way differs from the average Persian country with General regard^ to its inability to support, a.large body of,troops, even when only marching straight through. For actual fighting aboyf here, small bodies of cavalry with machine guns, mounted infantry, mountain batteries, and pioneers would be the troops most suited to the nature of the ground. The road has a general direction east, and is a mere track, very rough in places, especial ly where it crosses.ridges, but could be vastly improved with very little labour. There are lateral communications on the north to Shiraz from Farrashband, Firuzabad and Jehrum.; but, on the, south side they are not gopd, there being onjy a few rough foot tracks. The nativ.es explain this by saying that thpy have no business to take, them down there, so why shonld they go,? though the,country.there-is, by no means more of a desert, and there are villages.and water. There are, however, roads to the south from Ahram via Khurmuj down the Tang-i-Zard Valley to Lavar from Firuz abad, and an old trade route from Jehrum to Tahir! on the Gulf. “European troops. would find the heat; very trying from Bhshire to Tang-i-Zard if it was necessary for them to do the march during the hot weather. Tang-i-Zard is the first place after leaving Bushire that would make a good halting-place and supply depot ; Firuzabad, five marches farther on, is the best place in the whole district for a depot, as consider able supplies could be collected about there, the climate and water are good, and several roads radiate from it, and there is also any amount of excellent camping-ground on the plain. Jehrum, though a much larger place, and strategically more important from the amount of country it commands and the number of main routes that converge there, does not enjoy so gppd a climate, being much hotter ; nor are the water and grass so abun dant and good, nor the country so fertile. “ Should it.be necessary to engage in actual fighting between Bushire apd Jehjmm, the operations would probably mainly consist in. the forcing or holding, as the case might be, of a series of passes over the succession of rqpuntain ridges .which form the chief characteristic of the country. In most .instance^ these .passes cannot be turned, owing to the rough precipi tous nature and length,of the,cjiains of hills .they traverse. “A body of troops moving through during the .hot-months would find the night and early morning up to 9 a.m. quite cool for marching. It would be rathpr a difficult matter, though, to find suitable halting-places along this route, if it were contemplated to march infantry in the early morning, halting them during the heat of the day and marching again inthe afternoon, as shade does not exist ih this part of Persia ; and there is seldom water obtainable half-way throtigh a march.” Of the country between Jehrum and Lake mrfz, the Same authority says :— “ Between Jehrum and Lake Niriz the general character of the country „ , , . , , differs slightly from that farther south, as the valleys separating the chains of hills are much broader and more level, being in fact small plains. About Fasa there is a large and fertile plain, well-inhabited and well-watered, the water-supply being so great that during the rains parts of the country there are too swampy to be passable. Just north of this is Lake Niriz, about which +here is a great deal of barren, mountainous country. Chief exports are opium and tobacco. There is an excellent road from Jehrum to Niriz via Fasa. This is Military c wb.lities. rather c i rc “ itou8 &gt; but to this circumstance it owes its easiness. It ascends the whole way with a gentle slope over a succession of plains, and is good throughout and passable for all arms. There are several more direct routes, but none of them to be recommended, unless time w» re so important as to justify leaving a good road for a bad one. The passes up to the lake, compared with those south of Jehrum, are very easy, and could aMo be turned if held too strongly to be forced. In other respects the country differs little from that about Fi uzabad; but it certainly affords greater facilities for troops to move and fight, as their dct'ion hefe would riot be so continually cramp ed by bad ground.” The hills in Fars ar£ situated rit different distances from the sea. At Bushire they are distant 24 iniles. Towards Bandar Rig the plain becomes contracted, and a few miles to the west of the village of Ganaveh, in the Haiat Baud District, a ;oW ridge suddenly projects out to the south and, touching the sea, separates that district from the district of Liravi. This projectirig point is known by the name of Kuh-i-Bang (q. v.). It is of no great height, and in breadth abou^ 7 or 8 miles. Beyond this hill lies the plain of Liravi. He e again the mountains are about 20 miles from the sea, at which distance the^ continue for 8 or 9 miles, when they again ap proach the south arid form a circle in the neighbourhood of Bandar Dilam. This low and advanced branch is known by the name of Zaidan, from a small town not far from Behbehan. On turning the southern point of the hills of Zaidan, they again abruptly retire to the north. At the port of Bandar Ma’shur in ’Arabistan they are 30 miles from the sea, and at Shushtar their most southern extiemity crosses the thirty-second degree of north latitude in the forty-ninth degree of east longitude. South of Bushiro, except for the valley and plain of the Mund river mouth, the hills lie right along the coast line ; the first range is the Kuh-i- Mand, and south-east of the Mund river, the range containing Kuh-i- Dirang. The face of the country on the south-eastern side of Fars towards Darab and Fasa, is somewhat different; here it is more open, the plains are of greater extent, the soil more sandy and water less p 1 entiful. Finally, on the eastern side almost from Darab to Abrquh, is found one of those kavirs * 2 F2300 FAR—FAR or sandy wastes, which, under the influence of a strong south-south-easterly wind, occasionally invade the neighbouring cultivated tracts with results similar to what occurred at the city of Rhages, south-east of Tehran, which is said to have been abandoned on this account. Fars contains the salt lakes of Niriz or Bakatigan and Mahar-Lu in the vicinity of Shiraz, and the Daria-i-Parishan near Kazarun which is also ; said to be salt. The main rivers are the Kara Aghach and its tributaries, which becomes the Mund river and pours into the Gulf at Khur Ziarat; the Band Amir with its two large tributaries, the Pulvar and the Kur, which empties its waters into the Daria-i-Niriz ; the Rudhilleh which flows into the Gulf near Khashm Ahmadi; and the upper branches of the Hindian river. Of antiquities, towards the north, Madar-i-Sulaiman marks the tomb of Cyrus ; to the west are the ruins of Kaleh Safid ; nearly in the centre are those of the ancient capital Persepolis ; and north-west of Kazarun the [ ruins of Shapur mark one of the spots where the first monarch of that name gratified his taste for building, on a scale more extensive even then that adopted by any other Sassanian ruler. History .—Ears or Farsistan is the same word as the Greek “ Persis ”, which, originally the title of the empire of Iran only, has begotten the name which Europeans have, from remote times, applied to the whole. In this province were Pasargadae, Persepolis and Istakhr, the capitals of the Sas sanian Kings, where they often resided though favouring a more western capital, and where they have left, in close proximity to the palaces and tombs of their predecessors, the sculptured records of their own majestic rule. Here a succession of ambitious soldiers of fortune, springing as a rule from a humble stock, found it possible, in the early disorganisation and ultimate atrophy of the unwieldy Empire of the Khalifs, to carve with their swords the scarcely-disguised reality of an independent Kingdom. The first of these was Ya’qub-bin-Lais of Sistan, the founder of the Sufari dynasty, in thejatter part of the ninth century. After the Sufari came the Dilami or Al-I-Bulah family, whose founder was a fisherman. Next came the Seljuk invasion. A Turkish General was appointed Governor in Fars, who managed affairs so skilfully that his family provided seven successive Viceroys between 1066 and 1149. Sunkur-ibn-Modud, a Tur koman chieftain, threw off the Seljuk yoke in that year and proclaimed his own independence. It was during the reign of Abu Bakr that Sa’di, the | poet, lived for 30 years at Shiraz, composed his “ Gulistan ” and “ Bostan ” and died. Next, Jangiz Khan, the Mongol, appeared on the scene and to him Abu Bakr was wise enough to prefer his allegiance. The Atabeg line terminated with the son of Hulaku Khan, and Fars remained a Mongol province until Mubariz-ud-Din Muhammad founded the Muzaffari dynasty. Injthe reign of the fifth prince of this family in 1387 Timur first came to Shiraz, in which town the poet Hafiz was then living. After the desola tion of Timur’s empire Fars fell successively into the hands of the Turko man Black Sheep and White Sheep dynasties ; from them it passed with the rest of Persia under the sway of Shah Isma’il, the founder of the Safavi royal line ; since which time it has remained an appanage of the Persian crown.

Population .—The population of Ears consists of t)ihdti or Deh-Nishin the settled inhabitants, and of Itiut oi Chadd^Niskin, the nomad inhabit ants. The former are sometimes supposed to be derived from the aboriginal race who were in the country before the Aryan invasion ; but they are now composed of many breeds, Irani, Arab, Turkish and even Circassian blood being found among them. The latter are also very mixed, being mainly of Irani, Arab, Turkish and, as is popularly supposed, of B&amp;ctrian extraction. The last named are BakhtiarL Among the chief tribes may be mentioned the Mamassani and Qashqai, both of which tribes are described, as far as information is available, in this gazetteer. The Arab Ilidts are for the most part wanderers in those parts of Fars which are as yet unexplored by Europeans. They are nomadic and dangerous in the extreme. Their summer quarters are in the hills of Bavanat and other places in the country between Shiraz and Yazd. They have a hereditary chief called the llhhdni to whom they all owe allegiance ; from Whom they receive the laws which rule their conduct ; and to whom they pay the revenue imposed upon them. They contribute a certain number of soldiers to the army of the Shah. The Turkish Ilia's, including the Qashqai, once a power in Fars, are now poor and broken, and too near to the central power in Shiraz to have much chance of regaining their former status and wealth. They have an IlJchdni appointed by the Shah. Robbery is the legitimate trade of every man in Ears, from Kdjdr Prince to Sur shepherds It is plied accord ing to the personal courage and offrcial opportunities of each individual man. A wholesome dread,, &lt;?i the Shahzadeh (the Prince-Governor) alonesaves the province from becoming a pandemonium; Of the inhabitants of the tract of country between Bushire and Jehrum, Stotherd (1893) re ported :— “ The inhabitants are civil and disposed to be friendly, and the khans and ndibs, as a rule, come to visit a European on arrival, and offer assistance etc. Generally two or three of the leading men of each village carry fairly good rifles. These are something of the Martini-Henry type, with a single barrel, lever and falling block, but short fore-end and very coarse sighting They are manufactured apparently expressly for Persia, as they are stamped with the “ Lion and Sun ” device, but bear no maker’s name, though them are a few rifles of much superior make bearing the name of Hollis, London Owners of these rifles are very proud of them, and invariably bring them up to show, asking questions as to their probable value. The usual price they said they paid, was about Rs. 200. This included 100 rounds of ammu nition, which' they carry stuck all.'round them in a belt. At least half [ the remainder of the men of a village possess long muzzle-loader guns of th&amp; Arab type, generally only single barrelled with percussion cap locks. They are as a rule good shots, as they are always shooting game, and so are well accustomed to the use of Their weapons .; but there is no organisa tion, among them for military purposes. The physique of the race seemed good, and they are ghle to traverse long distances on foot. The ohief diseases they suffer from are ophthalmia, fever, earache and rheumatism. They are not very hardworking, and never move far from their villages unless obliged to, spending their time cultivating a small piece of ground in the close vicinity of their huts. During the hot time of year, they shut them selves up in their housesMuring the heat of the day, though in some villages they move out to summer quarters in a camp formed of temporary huts of boughs and goat’s hair tents, generally close by their permanent village, which is for the time deserted. Of the part between Jehrum and Niriz the same authority reports :— “ The inhabitants are less inclined to be civil to Europeans, and are not under so good control as about Firuzabad. In some places there is no ndib or any appearance of authority, except that a revenue collector, I was informed, came once a year to collect dues. Ndibs . and Governors are appointed yearly, and take np appointments about this time* of year. There is now (June 1893) a great amount of highway robbery and violence going on about these parts. A certain amount of this is always carried on here ; but this year, owing to the distress caused by bad crops, locusts and the disturbed state of the head-quarters of Government at Shiraz, there is a great deal more than usual. ” Of the remainder of the population, which is extremely mixed especial ly towards the coast where they are now more generally known by the name of the district or locality to which they belong, such as Ehishtis, Dashtis, Kazarunis, Tangistanis, etc., a description of each will be found under the heads of the different districts in this Gazetteer. The inhabitants of each village also, wherever possible, have been mentioned in the article regard ing it. * Note by Sir Thomas Gordon. —Almost all changes are made at “Nauruz ”, New years’s day, 21st March.304 FAR—FAR Trade, supplies and resources.—The produce of Fars consists mainly of tobacco, fruits, opium, grain, oranges, limes, sulphur, lead, red and yellow ochre, cotton, horses, sheep, mules and donkeys. The manufactures are arms, cutlery, glass ware, ornamented pen-cases, silver and gold kalians, tobacco pipes, cotton cloths, cotton and woollen stockings and wine of two sorts. Nearly all of these are manufactured at Shiraz—vide this Gazetteer. Shiraz is the capital and emporium for the whole of the manufactures and resources of Fars, which are described in the article on that place, while a full account of the import and export trade of the province ^ill be found in the article- on Bushire town and harbour.

The climate of Fars varies according to the configuration of the province. In the high levels it is salubrious, and this region maybe said to commence about the latitude of Kazarun. The best idea of the climate of this part will be obtained from the article in this Gazetteer on Shiraz. Of the climate of the coast line and plain land writers have vied with one another in saying the worst things possible. Mr. Odling, M. R. C. S., has reported on that of the country lying adjacent to the telegraph line, and his remarks will befound in the articles on Bushire, Boraxjun, Dalald Kamarij and Kazarun. Of the district between Bushire and Jehrum, Stotherd (1893) writes:— “ It is very hot here from May to September and during the winter the cold cannot be excessive, as the date palm flourishes nearly everywhere in this region. The nights are cool; in fact there is a most remarkable difference in temperature between day and n : ght, the highest day temperature, I ob served, was 112° in the shade (this w T as near the coast), the nights temperature being 69°. The prevailing wind during May and June was north-west, warm and irregular in force. When it blows with any strength it raises dense clouds of dust. It always dropped about sunset, the peculiarity of it being that the farther inland we removed, the later in the day it seemed to get up. There are swarms of the common fly during the hot weather, which are rather troublesome, and in some places transport animals suffer from gadflies which are very large and venomous. Mosquitoes are not so numerous. Topography .—The principal modern places are :—on the north, Deh-BId, Abadeh; on the east, Darab, Fasa, Niriz ; on the south, Jehrum, Firuzabad ; on the west, Bushire, Borazjun, Kazarun and Behbehan ; and in the centre Shiraz. From the articles on these places, a better idea will be obtained of the details of the various parts of Fars than it is possible to convey in one single and comprehensive description of so large and widely varying an area. The sea ports comprise Bandar Dilam, Bandar Rig, Bushiie, Daiyir and Tahiri. Administration. —Fars, as mentioned before, is an appanage of the royal crown, and is generally ruled by a member of the royal family under the title of Governor-General of Fars. His jurisdiction does not, however, extend over Behbehan which has a Governor of its own, nor over some of the coast districts geographically included in Fars, which are administratively subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The prince-royal appointed to the pro vince is often little more than a nominal ruler, and does not always find it an easy matter to pay into the royal treasury the sum insisted on, or even vo luntarily offered in return for the appointment. The Governor-General resides at Shiraz (or Isfahan) and rules his province by farming out parts of it to various local rulers, who, in their turn, farm out their districts in y t smaller portions. Towards the south, especially, the jurisdiction of the Gov ernment of Fars is interspersed with that of the Government of the Gulf Ports and of Behbehan (which both have separate Governments) in a bewildering and apparently inconsequent manner. In many places also the authority of the Governor is encroached upon in a piece-meal fashion by leases of the land-revenue in favour of high Persian dignitaries, which carry with them the right to exercise certain executive powers ; and everywhere the jurisdiction of the Governor is honeycombed with minor and semi-independent jurisdic tions of local hereditary Khans and Shaikhs. In some parts it appears impossible to determine whether the representative of the central govern ment, or of the lessee of the revenue, or of the petty local chieftain actually predominates. Of the climate between Jehrum and Niriz Stotherd says ' The climate appears healthy, but hotter during the summer months than might be expected at an elevation of 5,000 feet. This is due doubtless to the absence of trees and vegetation and the paucity of water. The ther- 112 I.B.FAR-FAR 800 mometer in June was invariably over 90° in the shade during the day; the nights, though, were pleasantly cool. Fasa marks the limit of the temperate winter zone; north of this there are no date palms or vegetation that can survive a cold winter.” One of the most recent Governors was Shu’a-us-Saltaneh, a younger son of the Shah Muzuffar-ud-Din, who was given appointment in 1901. His harsh government and his propensity for cornering grain resulted in serious riots. He was re-appointed in 1904, but his rapacity and bad govern ment led to further serious disturbances and his removal after a second period of office which lasted 18 months. The present Governor is Zafar-us- Saltaneh, (1910). Communications . —The only communications are caravan-roads. The main routes of Fars centre at Bushire and Shiraz, as also does the telegraphic communication ; and full information on these points will be found in the articles on those towns in this Gazetteer.

Known formerly as “ Polior.” An island in the Persian Gulf, almost 20 miles south of the Shfbkuh Port of Mughu : in shape it is an ellipse, with its greater diameter of 4| miles from north to south and a lesser diameter of 3 miles. Except for a reef with h fe-fa detached rocks on the west side, the island has deep water all round it, and the coast consists of rocky cliffs, 30 or 40 feet high. The tides here are strong, and there is orie dangerous shoal between Farur and the mainland, apparently identical with the pearl bank known as Niveh Jazirat Farur. Otherwise the island is easy of approach. Farur is covered with dark, volcanic hills which, in one conical but table- topped peak, attain a height of 465 feet. Most of the island consists of bare rock and talus, but the ravines contain numerous trees, and one on the east side has w^ells and some date-palms. There is little bird-life, but there are a few gazelle. On the east side of the island is a small village of about 40 souls, of Sudan and of miscellaneous Arabs from the Persian side. They own a couple of fishing-boats, but most of their provisions are imported from Mughu. The people of Mughu send their cattle here to graze, and obtain some firewood from the place. Farur is under the Marzuql Shaikh of Mughu. The Persian Government have not as yet shown any interest in this island .—{Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) FAS A— Lat. 28° 59' 45' N. Long. 53° 42' E.

A town in Fars, situated in the centre of the plain of the same name, 91 miles east-south-east of Shiraz and 43 miles north-north-east of Jehrum.310 FAB-FAS It is a large village with a detached mud fort (not mentioned by Stotherd), some pleasant gardens, and two caravanserais. The town seeems (1884) to be in a flourishing condition. The houses are well built, and the streets are somewhat cleaner than the generality of Persian towns. p . . The inhabitants number about 4,000 souls and opu a ion. are c * y -j anc j obliging. Excellent supplies are obtainable here. There is a very good bazar thatched in with boughs, with Trade, supplies, and re- a stream of water running down the centre, sources. Fruit, vegetables and lucerne grass are especially good here, and all the ordinary supplies are obtainable from the sur rounding country and villages. The date-palm flourishes here, and the gardens about the town are filled with fruit trees of all descriptions. Water is obtained from springs and qandts. The principal trade is in opium and tobacco which are sent to Shiraz. The Fasa opium is perhaps the best produced in Persia. The opium trade varies ; some years as much as 5,000 mans (==7| lbs. per man) being exported, while in a bad year the total may only reach 3,000. There is a small manufacture of hukahs and earthenware, and large numbers of chaddars are made here. Other wise there are no special industries in the town; nearly the whole of c j imate the working population appears to be engaged in agriculture. The cold, having regard to the vege tation, cannot be excessive, though snow lies on Kuh Tudeh during the winter months. The summer heat is not excessive. Preece in 1884 says the town pays mdlidt of 180,000 Jcrdns annually. The town is under the QavVam-ul-Mnlk, who keeps a ndib here to govern it and administer the neighbouring small villages. A post office was Administration. started here, but, as no one used it, it was done away with.

There are no steep gradients or stones ; in fact the whole way is over a succession of plains descending with an almost imperceptible slope. Troops should move easily on this route. The only impediments to artillery are the irrigation channels which cross the road. These, as a rule, are only span ned by a bridge about one yard wide. Some places also in wet weather get very deep and sticky.— (Ouseley—Abbott — Jones — Preece, 1884— Stotherd, 1893.) FASA DISTRICT- Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Fars, south-south-east of Shiraz. It contains a plain of the same name ; and its capital town, also of the same name, is situated in the centre of the plain. It extends east and west about 45 miles, and varies in breadth between 9 and 15 miles. Preece gives the population of the district as from 35,000 to 40,000 souls. The district numbers some 33 villages and hamlets, and produces chiefly wheat and barley, the ordinary yield being from 5 to 12-fold. It also produces some Indian-corn, millet,FAS—FAT 311 i- sesame-seed, and tobacco ; also a small quantity of cotton and rice. The country comes under the denomination of garmslr. The following list of villages was given by Preece in 1884. At all these villages, he says, barley and wheat are sown in quantities of from 100 mans to 1,000 mans yearly, as are also great quantities of onium 1 A in -rr • ? A “ 1. 2 . Akbarabad.

In the centre of the plain stands the town of Fasa. The plain is completely surrounded by hills, and presents somewhat the appearance of an elongated diamond. It is probably about 20 miles long, east to west, and 12 miles broad, north to south. On it are numerous villages dotted about, and also a number of watch towers, but the latter are falling into ruins. Although the plain has been said to have a dreary and deserted appearance, Preece in 1884 said the soil was apparently alluvial and rich, being cultivated everywhere with barley, wheat and opium, and in some places with Indian-corn and Stotherd, who visited it in 1893, described it as fertile, well cultivated and dotted all over with numerous small villages and camps of llidts.—(Ouseley Abbott — Jones — Preece, 1884— Stotherd, 1893.)

A village in the Bastak district of Laristan, 15| miles from the town of Bastak, on the road to Lar. It is situated at the foot of the northern slopes of the Kuh-i-Gavbus, surrounded by date-groves and a considerable area of wheat cultivation, and contains some 60 houses. In the vicinity are numerous ancient Zoroastrian ruins. Water is plentiful from wells and springs, and there is also a hot water spring, of which the temperature is 103°. The camping-ground is spacious though stony, but supplies are scanty with the exception of firewood, which is said to be obtained in abundance from the Kuh-i-Gavbus.— (Vaughan, April 1890.) FEHLlAN (1) or PALIAN— Lat. 30° 17' N. Long. 51° 35' E. Elev. A town in the Shulistan district of Fars, some 72 miles north-west of Shiraz, and the principal village of the Talaspid plain. It is situated in the Shi’b Bavvan valley, at the northern base of the hills, some 2 miles west of the Behbehan-,Shiraz road at Gureh. In the winter months narcissus grows here in great abundance. 'DeBode describes it as a paltry little town of • at most sixty or seventy houses, but enclosed by walls now in ruins, which show that it was formerly not quite so insignificant. It is supplied with water by a canal cut through the hills from the snow-capped chain beyond Kaleh Safxd for a distance of 14 miles. It is surrounded by fine palm treesand has a fort m ruins on the summit of a small hill. As a precipice rises close behind the town, it is probable that the heat in summer must be in tolerable. Supplies of grain and cattle can be obtained here, and wood is procurable from the Bakhtiari tribes in the neighbourhood. The district of Fehlian, which formerly extended from Muninahl on the south to Basht on the north-west, and from Ardakan on the east to Khisht on the south-west, has been encroached upon by the Mamassanl, who by degrees have made themselves masters of all the arable land formerly poss essed by the inhabitants of Fehlian, who complain bitterly of the exactions to which they are subjected. The water of the Fehlian or Ab-i-Shur river being, as the name implies, brackish, can only be used for irrigating the helds. The soil here is very fertile and water abundant, but hands are want ing for the cultivation of the land. The fields artificially irrigated yield from 25 to 40-fold m the winter crops ; the proportion is lower in the lands called daim (debt) and ‘ lakhs ’ (deficiency), i.e., fields watered only by rain and dew, and not artificially irrigated. Rice, which is grown, yields less than that which is planted, the produce of the latter being to that of the former in good years 150-fold. Sesamum is also cultivated here and yields 100-fold. The duties paid by Fehlian to the government of the province of Fa: s do not exceed £.±§0.—(DeBode—Jones—McGowan , 1895-Hopkins, 1903.) FEHLIAN (2)— A division of the Mamassani tribe (q.v.)

It flows through the Talaspid plain, in which the village F hllan is situated. Rice-fields seem to absorb the whole of the water, and numerous irrigation channels are to be seen, notably the one leading to the head of this Sarab-i-Siah valley. Near the mountain. Kaleh Safid, the Fehlian is joined by the Shul stream from the north, the ma : n stream from the east being here called the Tang-i-Khast. It is 18 yards wide and 3 feet deep, flowing very rapidly, (vide Ab-i- Shur.) FEHRABARI or FARAKHURI— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Haiat Daud district of Ears, 15 miles north by cast of Ghanaveh. It contains 70 houses, inhabited by Lurs and o d Persian tribes ; some of the houses are said to date from pre-Muhammadan time. The village stands on a plain where wheat and barley are grown.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) FEHRAJ— Lat. SIMG'; Long. 54° 32\ Elev. A large village, 17 miles (Abbott says 30) from Yazd on the road to Bafq. It is beautifully shaded by mulberry trees, and its qandt brings cold snow water from Shir Kuh. It has a slender minaret of mud from which the towers of Yazd, 17 miles distant, can be seen.—. (Stack.) FIDAGH— Lat. Long. Elev.

Very good supplies are obtainable here, and the water-supply is abundant. The surrounding country is infested by gangs of robbers. Caravans usually hire escorts of 15 to 20 men armed with long guns when passing through this district.— (Stctherd, 1893.) FILAT— Lat. Long. Elev. A district occupied by the tribe of Mai Ahmadi Haft Lang Bakhtiari. It is passed through on the road from Qumisheh to Khuzistan. This is evidently the same as Falat and Falard.— (Layard.)

Wheat is largely cultivated.— (Sher Jang, 1902.) FlRtJZABAD (1)—Lat. 28 0 5rN. Long. 52° 33'E. Elev. A town in Fars, 72 miles south of Shiraz, and 119 miles from Bushire by road. It is the eighth stage on the Bushire-Jehrum road. Toim and inhabitants .—Though prosperous, Firuzabad is now less im portant than it was in the middle ages, and (1893) has a population of 2,000, or if outlying villages are included, of 3,000. The town is surrounded by a mud wall and ditch, and there are a few plantations of date trees round it. It contains some 600 houses ; on the outskirts of the town is a large walled house, the residence of the Ilkhani of the Qashqai tribe, who is the ex-officio governor of Firuzabad and Farrashband. The town though walled, is incapable of offering any resistance to an army, and iscommanded by a low range of hills on the east side. The inhabitants are for the most part engaged in fruit-farming and cultivation, but there are also a few carpet-makers. The people are civil and disposed to be friendly. Firuzabad is the best place along the route to Nlriz from Bushire vi&amp; Jehrum. Its chief importance from a military point of view is that it is admirably situated for a halting-place and a supply depot. Climate. This district enjoys a moderate climate and is generally healthy. The heat is never excessive. Colonel Taylor recommended it as being m every way eligible for a cantonment. Surrounding country.-—IY iq whole of the plain around the town is extreme ly fertile, and, for Persia, well inhabited. It bears the same name as the town and is elevated, well watered, and bears rich wheat and famous rice. It is one of the best corn-producing and grazing districts in Persia. For the most part it is i miles wide, but at the south-eastern extremity narrows to 5 miles. Here it only produces grass, and has a rocky mountain ridge on either hand, that on the north-east rising to 2,000 feet. It had 30 villages about 50 years ago, but the number is now reduced to thirteen. It is watered by the Firuzabad river which has its source in the Dasht-Muk, and enters and leaves^ the plain by great gorges in the mountains which bound it. The river is full of fish. Before arriving at Baba Najm it forces its way through three more of these gorges, the last of which has perpendi cular cliffs, 500 feet high; it then joins its waters with those of the Kara Aghach and flows into the Mund river, vide this Gazetteer —Firuzabad and Mund rivers. Trade, Resources, Transport and Supplies. —Supplies here are good and much above the average. Rice, gram and barley are exported into the surrounding country, and fruits and rosewater to Bushire. The total value of exports does not exceed Rs. 4,000 annually. There are about 50 horses and a few ponies in the town, and some thousands of donkeys could be collected, as large numbers are employed on the caravan routes. Mules are very rarely seen in these parts. There is excellent camping-ground for a very large force here, and an abundant supply of good water for both men and animals. Firewood in large quantities could be obtained from Maimand, where there is stated to be any amount of wood of all sorts. History. —Near the town, about 4 miles to the north-west, are some ruins known as old Firuzabad or Kaleh Firuzabad, evidently once a considerable town and surrounded by a ditch and embankment, the former 40 to 50 paces in width, forming a wide circle nearly a mile in diameter. The original town was built by the Achsemenian, and subsequently embellished by the Sassanian monarchs, and bore the name of Jur, Gur or Khur. The name “Firuzabad” or the “Abode of Victory” was subsequently given to it by the Asad-ud-Dauleh of the Buieh dynasty, in the tenth century. Here Ardashir Babakan built a palace and a great Atish-Gdh or fire temple. The remains now visible are briefly— (1) The Kaleh-i-Dukhtar^a ruined castle upon the heights command ing the Tang Ab, a defile to the north of the town. (2) Two Sassanian bas-reliefs sculped on the walls of the same defile.316 FIR—FIR (3) The ruins of a great vaulted building, generally recognized as the palace of Ardashir. (4) A ruined tower, pillar or obelisk of unhewn masonry, commonly identified with the Atish-Gdh of Ardashir, though Perrot attributes to it a secular or military origin. It is 12 feet square and 60 feet high, and forms a conspicuous landmark all over the plain. It retains traces of an outside winding ascent from terrace to terrace, like the Babylonian temples. (5) The remains of two tanks, also supposed to have belonged to the Gabrs, or fire-worshippers. These are now the only remains of the former race, about whom the present inhabitants se^m neither to know anything nor to care. Legend says that Alexander the Great built a dam at the gorge at the southern end of the plain, thus flooding the plain and destroying old Firuzabad. In a latter generation, Firuz Shah broke the dam, drained the plain, and founded the modern town on which he bestowed his own name. Administration .—Firuzabad is the official residence of the nominal II- khani of the Qishqai tribe of Fars, who is ex-officio governor of Firuzabad and Farrashband. With these distinctions the incumbent has to be content, the titular rank of Ilkhani being all that is left to him of tribal power. This is part of the policy of the government of the Shah, which, in order more effectually to control the nomad element, often summons them as hostages to the provincial capitals, or_to Tehran. In the meantime, the headship of the tribe is vested in the Tlbegi, a sort of second-in-com mand, who pays in to the provincial governor the revenue in the shape of a poll-tax upon their flocks and herds, which he collects from his fol lowers. The terms upon which land is held in this district are as follows:— Land which is the private property of the former is cultivated at his sole expense, the labourers receiving in lieu of wages one-fifth of the produce ; out of the remainder the former accounts to Government for one-third as tax. When the labourer furnishes seed, plough, and labour he receives one-third, Government one-third, and the land-owner one-third, of the produce. On the Crown lands the Government takes two parts of the produce, but furnishes seed and ploughs : the labourer gets the remainder. When the land belongs to the peasant, he cultivates it, giving one part of the produce to Government and keeping two parts for himself. Communications .—The following are the chief routes radiating from ’» Firuzabad: — (1) To Bushire, 8 stages, 119 miles. (2) To Shiraz, 4 stages, 17 miles. It was by these two routes that the Persians in 1857 brought their artillery down to Khushab. (3) To Jehrum, 4 stages, 72f miles. The most direct route to Jehrum leads south-east down a broad valley, over open country with long ridges of hills on either side* The going, is easy. (4) To Kazarfln via Farrashband and Jireh, 5 stages, 104 miles. {Kinneir — Felly — Abbott — Jones — Taylor — Stolze — Durand — Stack, 1881—-Cumw, 1889— Stotherd, 1893.) . -FlRtZlBlD (2)— Lat. 29 0 24' N.

The town is built in the form of a square with sides of about 400 yards, and is surrounded by a high mud wall, flanked at intervals of 1 5 yards by round mud towers, while a larger tower in the centre is used as a keep. There is, however, no ditch, and the defences are in a very dilapidated condition. Furg was formerly a place of some importance, but now, though the area within the walls is capable of containing over 1,000 people, the town has only from 100 to 150 inhabitants, while the total population of the Furg plain, exclusive of wandering Arabs, of whom many pitch their tents in the neighbourhood, does not exceed 500. The town is governed by a ndib, who is subordinate to the Governor of Lar. It contains but few shops, but among the residents are to be found two* or three small merchants, a butcher, a blacksmith, a tinsmith, and a couple of tailors. The people are armed with smooth-bore guns, some of European and others of native manufacture, amongst which are Tower muskets of 1859. Cheap English double-barrelled and single-barrelled guns are in use, but the ones preferred are either Tower muskets or guns of native manufacture, as they stand more rough usage. The people are fair marksmen, considering the roughness of their weapons, which carry about 200 yards with accuracy.

Excellent grazing for these is found in the surrounding hills which contain quantities of deer, hares, partridges and other game. Water is plentiful from wells, ^anats, and streams, and from the Furg river which rises to the west of the town. Two miles to the south-east is an ancient fort, now in ruins, called Kaleh Bahman. Its walls are of solid masonry, in parts 15 feet thick, and it con tains several wells, now dry. West of the town is another fort. These ruins and the remains of ancient aqueducts and villages testify to Furg’s previous prosperity, while the fertility of the soil gives promise of what it might once more become under a better Government.-—— Vaughan, 1888 .)

It lies on the south side of a valley near the foot of Kuh-i-Haft Chah. The town contains a fort, 200 stone houses and 700 inhabitants. Good and plentiful water is obtainable from wells, and a moderate amount of supplies are. available. There is good camping-ground here. The grazing is good, and the kandr bushes in the neighbourhood afford a small supply of fuel. Small quantities of wheat, barley, gram and tobacco are cultivated on the surrounding plain. Galleh Dar belongs to the Shlbkuh district of the Persian Gulf Ports. N.B .—It is doubtful whether this town is inside the boundary of Ears or not. From here the following roads branch off :— (1) To the sea-port Tahiri. General direction west £ north, distance 17 miles. (2) To the sea-port Lingeh. (3) To the Ird valley via the Galleh Dar valley, and the pass called Tang-i- Khur.(4) To Dad-ul-MTzan, distance 32 miles. This route is known as Bah-i- Malushtur.

The villages, in order from north to south, are distinguished as Shamali Miani and Qausi. The place is defended by half a dozen towers, and comprises altogether about 150 houses. The inhabitants are Lurs. A short way to the south of the villages is a creek called Khur Khalil deep enough to admit native boats of 25 tons burden ; but the anchorage for larger vessels is at some distance off-shore, there being only 3 fathoms at 1£ miles and the landing is bad at low-water. Dates, wheat and barley are the chief products ; there are about 40 horses, 30 mules and 200 donkeys, and the fowls are said to be remarkably fine. Water good from wells. Ganaveh is governed by Murad Khan, son of an uncle of the Khan of Haiat Daud who resides here. A customs official is stationed at this place to prevent the smuggling of rifles into the country, but as yet the trade has suffered little from his interference. Near Ganaveh are some of the extensive ruins for which the Haiat Daud district is celebrated, mark ing the site of the Jannabeh of the mediaeval Arab and Persian geographers .—{Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

A valley and mountain in the Bakhtiari country, the latter being a spur of the Kuh-i-Sard ilb. The Bakhtiari caravan road, on its 7th stage from Isfahan, traverses the former, and crosses the latter between miles 112 and 122. The valley is stony and watered by a good stream from a large spring, lined with willows, ganas and oaks. Many hundreds of sheep and goats are met with in summer in and around the valley. The slopes of the mountains are stony and covered with small oaks and other scrub, and are alive with grey partridges in the early spring. The crests of the hills rise about 200 feet above the valley and form something of a circle. The surface of the road over the pass is, on the whole, good. The lower part of the Tang-i- Gandum-Kar is a narrow gorge between perpendicular heights. The stream, which is here perennial, finds its way down the Tang-i-Hazar Jarib and emerges close above the Sarkhun caravanserai. Farther up the stream the gorge gives way to a wide, open basin. Up to the point where it reaches the hills which head the valley and basin, the ascent is gentle and the going good. It then becomes steep and stony and finally ascends up a steep hill in rivetted zigzags. The face of the hill is of loose stones and earth. The crest is the Gardan-i-Gandum-Kar. It presents no serious obstacle to pack transport. There is *a good camping-ground at Gandum-Kar, but no supplies at hand except fuel and water.— {Burton, 1904— Arbuthnot, 1905— Lorimer, 1906.)

Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from Mandali to Kirmanshah city. It crosses the Kaluja range. The ascent from the south is easy, the descent to the north very steep. It is turnable to the west by the Gardaneh Timanjik, distant 1| miles, and to the east by a pass,the Kamar Zard, distant Smiles, and leading into the Guar valley from Asmanabad. The gradient, etc., of the Gardaneh Amrula is fully described in Maunsell’s Reconnaissances in 1890 under the name of Kaluja pass. It is passable to laden mules, but not to field guns.— {Vaughan.) GARDANEH (Birkeh)— A place in the Lingeh district {q.v.). GARDANEH DARBADAM— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from Kirmanshah to Baghdad via Man dali and Harunabad, and 47 miles south-west of Kirmanshah city. It consists of an open watershed connecting two valleys, viz. , the Syehes and Pusht-i- Tangd-Jumark. A high range of hills is south of it and a lower one to the north. The approaches to it are very easy. The hills and slope s on either side of it are well-wooded, principally with dwarf oak. There is good grazing upon it and immmediately east of it is a small spring. It is a small camping-ground of the Kalhur Kurds. Its elevation is 5,920 feet.— {Vaughan.) GARDANEH DARREH DARIGH— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on a road between the Asmanabad and Ivan valleys. It passes through Bankur after leaving Asmanabad. The pass is about 9 miles in length, and out of this 7 miles are either over rocks or else along a roadway strewn with loose stones. Its summit is reached at the 6th mile from the northern side. The ascent from the north is not steep ; it runs over a series of rounded hills, each higher than the other, with the intervening ground nearly level. It runs through fores t throughout. The326 GAR—GAR summit of the pass is about 6,200 feet in height, the actual pass' being 100 yards broad, between low, rounded hills which are easily accessible. The descent on the southern side into Ivan is down a narrow valley with a dry watercourse : lower down there are high cliffs some distance apart on either side. The high ground above the cliffs being smooth, the rounded slope of the range easily accessible from the summit of the pass. The pass can be easily defended by a small force from any attempt to force it from the south. It could be defended by a large force from the north, but with cons derable difficulty, their line of retreat down the gorge, if the enemy gained the heights on either side, being cut off. The only water is at Chab Gam Gam, 2| miles north of the summit of the pass. It is turnable south-east and north-north-west by the Gardaneh Duruga, distant about 6 miles.—* (Vaughan.) GARDANEH DURUGA— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on one of the roads from Mandall to Kirmanshah city via Harunabad. It leads from Ivan on its southern side through Bankur into the Asmanabad valley, near the ruins of the old town. Its northern slope appears to be fairly easy, the southern one being said to be steeper. It runs through forest. It is passable to laden mules.— (Vaughan.) GARDANEH GHAZALAN— Lat. Long. Elev. ‘ A pass in Kirmanshah on one of the roads from Mandali to Kirmanshah city via Harunabad. It crosses the Kaluja range. It is reached on its southern side by a road running nearly east from the ruins of Asmanabad, in the valley of that name, into another small valley, crossing a low water shed en route. It then ascends the Kaluja range running amongst oak trees, and descends into the Guar valley. It is passable to laden mules, but not to field guns. It is turnable north-west by the Gardaneh Vur- maziar, distant 6 to 8 miles. Its elevation is somewhere about 600 feet.— (Vaughan.) GARDANEH GIL-I-SURKH— Lat. Long. Elev. 8,000'. A pass in Ears, 5 miles north-east of Khani Man. The ascent from the northern side runs up alongside a dry water-course, amongst big rocks, boulders and trees, and is impassable for guns. The top is open and level, and clothed in grass and trees. The descent on the southern side is at first alongside a ravine between two hills. The sides slope steeply and the road is impassable for guns. Then, crossing a low spur, the descent continues by a steep, zigzag road with a gradient of 15° down to the Khur valley, the total length of the descent being 2£ miles. Horse flies are very troublesome on this pass.— (Vaughan, 1^1.) GARDANEH-I-IMAMZADEH ISMA’IL— Lat. 30°23'N. Long 52° 37'E. Elev. 9,000'. A pass crossed by the road from Imamzadeh Isma’fl to Gjan, 5J miles west of the former. The gradient averages 1 in 8 with portions at 1 in 3, and the road, strewn with bordders and protruding masses of rock, is imprac ticable for artillery. The top of the pass is marked by a ruined tower.About 200 yards beyond the tower and west of the road is an ab-amldr. The tribesmen,, who use this road in the spring and autumn migrations, say the supply of water in this reservoir never fails.—(GVaAame, 1908.) GARDANEH-I-MAIDAN— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Ears on the road from Surian to Simakan, which is 20 miles south east of Deh Bid; the ascent from the north is in a south-east direction, gradu- ally getting steeper until near the summit, when it is easier : as far as this point the road is narrow, but not obstructed ; over the top itturrs south west with a slight descent over undulating ground, till it reaches the bed of a mountain stream. On the south side of the summit there is an under ground winter shelter.— {Blackman.) GAB.DANEH KAMAR ZARD— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on a road between Mandall and Kirmanshah city. It crosses the Kaluja range. The ascent from the Asmanabad valley on its south side is easy. The descent on the farther side, north into the Guar valley, is said to be, and is, probably, steep. The pass runs through oak trees. It is turnable to the north-west by the Gardaneh Amrula, dis tant about 4 miles, and to the south-west by the Gardaneh Vurmaziar. It is passable to laden mules, but not to field guns. Its elevation is about 6,000 feet.—( Vaughan.) GARDANEH MILA NEH— Lat Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from the Kifraur valley into that of Gilan. It is on the Kaluja range. It is about 4 miles in lergth, the summit being 2| miles from the northern entrance. Its elevation is 5,495 feet. The pass runs through forest. The road is steep and rocky and in most parts covered with loose stones. The summit is about 300 yards broad between the peaks on either side. The descent on the southern side is very steep, and after the foot of it is reached there are numerous low hills to descend. It is impassable to guns, being a difficult mountain track. There is no water on it, but room for troops to rest under the trees on its sum mit. It forms a better defensible position facing south than to the north. The southern faces of the hills on both sides terminate in high cliffs, while to the north the hills descend in a gradual slope. It is tumable south-east by the Gardaneh Timanjik, distant 14 miles, and north-west by the Tang-i- Shashra, distant about 17 miles.— (Vaughan.) GARDANEH RUNG— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from Deh Bala into the Ivan valley, and thence to Kirmanshah. The pass is 4| miles in length. The slopes on both sides of the summit are equally bad. The road crosses an immense ridge of upheaved crags which bar the exit of the Ivan valley to the south east. The height of the pass is 5 650 feet. The road up it on both sides runs up a steep zigzag amongst loose stones, rocks and boulders overhung by oak trees. Mule-loads have to be carefully arranged, as otherwise it is im possible for them in places to pass. The summit consists of a pathway just broad enough for laden animals to pass between large rocks, while farther back are perpendicular masses of rock. Facing south, the range, the Kuh-328 GAR-GAR i-Zavil, is topped with clifTs several hundred feet in height. Its lower slopes are in many places concealed from any position that might be taken up at or close to the crest. At the same time, owing to the great difficulty of the ascent, the narrowness of the line of advance, and the ease with which the summit of the pass could be completely blocked with stones in a very short time, and held by a few riflemen, it is the most likely point at which opposition from the surrounding tribes might be expected in an advance in either direction along this line ; the more so as it is turnable east only by rounding the Manisht Kuh in that direction, and advancing up the Asmanabad valley, a detour of over 20 miles . while to the west iu is not known to be turnable by any road nearer than Dubrideh, distant 30 miles, and involving a detour of many more(Faw^Aaw.) GARDANEH SHISH DAR— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from Kirmanshah city, via the Ivan and Chavar valleys, to Deh Bala. Its summit is miles west of Deh Bala. The ascent to it from Chavar is an easy one along which a carriage might be driven. The descent into the Deh Bala valley is slight, the road winding about amongst low hills. The country through which the road to it runs is well covered with fcrest. It is overlooked by a range to the south and commanded thence within 800 yards. To the north the ground is broken, being full of ravines and hills, one of which flanks the road during the last 14 miles of the approach to the summit from the Chavar valley. The country north of it between it and the Manisht Kuh is said to possess one footpath by which mountaineers can get from one valley into the other, but there is said to be no water 0 n it. The summit of the pass, whose elevation is 5,540 feet, consists of low. rounded hills, passable anywhere for several hundred yards. The pass could easily be turned by troops moving along the north slope of the range south of it.—(Vaughan.) GARDANEH TIMANJIK—La t . Long. Elev. A pass of Kirmanshah on the road from Gil an up the Chila valley, to the north-west end of the Guar valley and thence to Kirmanshah. It crosses the Kaluja range at the east foot of the Kachal Kuh, the Highest peak of the range. The ascent from the south is easy, but the descent into the Guar valley to the north is very steep. At the bottom^ of this descent is a ruined caravanserai on a road from Sar-i-Pul to Harunabad. The pass is turnable to the east by the Gardaneh Amrula, distant 14 miles, and to the west by the Gardaneh Mila Neh, distant about 15 miles. It is of the same height as the Gardaneh Amrula. The hill it crosses is well-wooded. The summit of Kachal Kuh, about 4 miles off, would form a good signalling station. This pass is said to be easier than the Gardaneh Amrula. It is passable to laden mules, but not to field guns. Its eleva tion is about 6,300 ie&amp;t—{Vaughan.) GARDANEH VURMAZIAR— Lat. Long. Elev.

Elev. 4,430/ A pass in Laristan, which crosses the Kuh ZalimI range 2£ miles north east of the village of Bahristan, and over which the road leads from Bush- ire to Bandar ’Abbas. It was traversed in 1888 by Butcher, who thus described it:— V Th ® mouth of the pass is about £ mile broad, but, as we ascend in a direction north by east, decreases to about 20 or 30 yards, the hills on either side sloping up very precipitously or in cliff-like sections. The defile slopes gently upwards and presents no difficulty, till at 2 miles furlongs it is barred by an abrupt rise of about 60 feet in 100 yards, giving a slope of about 30°. On surmounting this slope we find a small* level space, covered with good grass, from which we can see down the gorge for some distance. At this point the pass becomes more difficult and rugged, and continues for 6 furlongs to rise by alternate ascents and descents. At 2 miles 7 furlongs, looking southward down the pass 2 T 2332 GAR-GAR a portion of the valley and the range of Haft Chah are visible between the precipitous sides of the gorge. Two furlongs farther up, this vista is again afforded us. The pass now becomes very steep and difficult, be tween huge, jagged rocks so close together as hardly to afford room for loaded mules to pass. On nearing the summit we ascend over smooth, rocky strata, sloping gently upwards, and pass an uncovered and empty cistern close to the east side of the road. At 3 miles 3 furlongs is the sum mit. From this point also a portion of the valley to the south is visible between the walls of the gorge. To northward we have an uninterrupted view down the northern slope of the range Balimi, and across the valley lying at its foot. The pass, called “ Zarguzadun,” on the northern side of the range, winds for a short distance round the brink of a deep crevice or chasm, which splits this slope of the range almost from top to bottom. The path is both narrow and steep, at times just leaving suffi cient room for loaded mules to pass. At 4 miles 4 furlongs (1 hour 38 minutes occupied in the descent) we reach the foot of the pass called “Damimansur,’’ a green, grassy spot dotted with a few kdndr and other bushes, ground undulating with low hills round about. The pass over the range Zalina is practicable for infantry and mule batteries, but not for wheeled transport or field artillery. This pass might be turned by marching round the south-east extremity of the range Zalimi, which route, I believe, presents no difficulties. The range on either side of the pass is rocky and precipitous, and would be diffi cult for infantry to cross, at least for any considerable body. The road, after leaving Damimansur, trends east-north-east, and is fairly easy going.— (Butcher, 1888.) GARDAN-I-ZIRREH— Lat. Long. Elev. 8,686'. A pass over the Ziireh mountains between Ardal and Shalamzar, on the Shushtar-Isfahan road. The ascent from the north side is steep and rough—a rise of 2,000 feet. This kutal separates the Chehar Mahal from the Bakhtiari country proper. In one place, on the northern side, the path passes through narrow rocks, where loaded mules have to be got through care fully. There is a small lake near the southern end of the pass on the plain. The road is blocked for mules in winter. The descent to the south is not difficult and is only a drop of 600 feet. (Sawyer.)

It is inhabited by 400 Lakis, Ghalibis and Dallamis, who own about 100 sheep and goats and 300 buffaloes. There is irrigated cultivation here .—(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) GARGAR (River)— This channel, the uppermost part of which is artificial, issues from the left bank of the Karun just above Shushtar, and rejoins that river at Band-i- Qir. Its direction is thus almost exactly from north to south and its length in a straight line about 30 miles, but between its extreme points it forms a regular curve to eastwards, of which the maximum divergence from: the direct line is about 8 miles. The Gargar forms the eastern boundary of the Mian-Ab island. At its head are the remains of a massive barrage, formerly called the Band- i-Kaisari and later the Band-i-Shahzadeh, and now known as the Band-i-Nur- gan, built of hewn stone, with six narrow openings through which the water passes, leaving the crest dry and traversable except when the river is high and pours over it. Below this barrage the stream flows for J mile through a chan nel of 100 feet depth, artificially excavated in the sandstone rock : it then reaches a second dam called Pul-i-Bulaiti which carries the road from Shush tar to all places east of it. At the Pul-i-BulaitI the water is forced into tun nels in the precipitous rock, which conduct it through a number of flour-mills built in the honeycombed rock side of the channel a little farther down. Below this dam the rock of the banks yields to earth, but the sides continue to be nearly 100 feet in height till the end of Shushtar town is reached. Half a mile below the Pul-i-Bulaiti a natural ledge of rocks crosses the channel, with an opening in it only 20 yards wide but passable for native river-boats. The stream then splits into three or four small but navigable channels, and so continues to a point 5 miles lower down, where the river bed is again nearly traversed by another barrier, partly natural, partly artificial, by which the course of the stream is considerably deflected ' to the east and made to form an acute angle; this place is called Mahi-Bazan or Bazaniat, meaning in the Shushtari patois “a place where fish play ” from the numbers of fish which come there to spawn and are caught. On the right bank 7 or 8 miles below Shushtar is the important landing place of Shalaili, above which there is not, for prac tical purposes, any navigation, either native or European. FromMahi- bazan to a short distance above Band-i-Qir the Gargar meanders through low ground several hundred yards broad, enclosed upon either side by steep clay banks from 40 to 50 feet high, with which the river m its windings from time to time comes in contact. As Band-i-Qir is approached the high banks close in upon the river and show remains of brick buildings, vestiges of the ancient city of ’Askar Mukaram; parts of these are sunk as much as 10 and even 20 feet below the present surface of the ground.GAR-GAR 334 At Band-i-QIr the banks do not ordinarily rise more than 18 feet above the river in its lowest season ; and in the high season, during floods, they are frequently overflowed. The width of the Gargar varies from 50 to nearly 100 yards, and at Band-i-QIr it is about 60. The flood discharge of the Gargar is about 7,000 cubic feet a second, but in March 1905 the discharge at Band-i-Qir was only about 2,000. Owing to the height of the bank the river does not lend itself naturally to purposes of irrigation, but in some places there are small inundation canals watering low-lying lands. The silt of the Gargar at its maximum is only about one-eightieth of its volume. The navigation of the Gargar is difficult chiefly on account of the sinu osities and the narrowness, in places, of the channel, of which the breadth varies from 20 to 40 yards ; with a low river obstacles in the shape of stones, sand-spits and tree-stumps are super-added. The Shushan which runs from Ahwaz to Shalaili at all seasons of the year, is a stern-wheeler, 100 feet in length over all, with a beam of 23 feet, and draws 3 feet of water, when carrying 30 tons of cargo ; her barge, 65£ feet by 15£ feet, carrying 50 tons of cargo on a mean draught of 3 feet, can only be used in a good river. A longer vessel could not negotiate some of the turns, and an ordinary paddle-steamer would find some of the channels too narrow. The average depth of the Gargar in the low season is from 6 to 4J feet, but the channels are subject to perpetual alteration in consequence, chiefly, of sandbars, which are thrown across the river by small tributaries^during the last freshets of spring. These the reduced river of the summer season in unable to wash away, and they often give soundings of as little as 2£ feet of water. Among the larger tributaries are the Malih, 6 nales below Hilaleh, the Chal-un-Naft coming down, 2 miles below Kraidi, from the neighbourhood of the naphtha-springs in the Ramuz district; and the Haddam, 1 mile below Saiyid Hasan ; these are all upon the left bank and contain water only after rain. Tree-stumps and similar si.ags are common ia the middle reaches of the Gargar ; many of them are kncun and can be avoided, but new ones are frequently met with when the ri\ er falls. About 2 miles above Band-i-Qir thf r ver contains piles of old cuttle fish which make the^ passage dangerous in the low season, and also afford a point of formation for sand-banks. The times of the river’s rise and fall vary from year to year, and the difference between the summer and winter levels is also inconstant; but by the middle of June the water has ordinarily fallen to a low level, and continues decreasing until the first rains of winter fall at the end of October, or the beginning of November. The discoloration in flood time is of a light buff hue. The current varies from 5 to 2 knots, and is strongest in the upper reaches near Shushtar. Since 1892 the Shushan has plied regularly on the Gargar at all seasons, but when the river is low she frequently runs aground or strikes the banks, and sometimes sustains injury. The only fuel is wood, which all comes from the banks of the Diz, and of which 15 tons are used on the trip from Ahwaz to Shalaili and .back. Shalaili is the port for Shushtar from which it is distant some 7 miles by road. There is no landing stage at this place ; the steamer merely being moored up against the mud bank A fuel depot is maintained at Band-i-Qir.

Certain ofienders againstOAR—GAS 339 the laws are transported to the Garmsir, in particular between the Shiraz mountains and the Persian Gulf.” Bell writes (1884):— “ Inland from the low, sandy shore of the Persian Gulf, extends to the low hills of sandstone and conglomerate a vast level of variable width (average 35 miles), a barren mud flat for some miles, liable to be flooded by high tides and hi a vy rains, and beyond, a plain growing cereals of various kinds, melons, &amp;c. ; it is sparsely populated, its few villages being planted at considerable intervals apart; water is found 10 feet from the surface ; it is of good quality, except for some miles to the east of the Karun. Wells are numerous in and round about the villages not situated on streams. It is poorly irrigated. A few trees, chiefly the date palm, grow round about the villages only; firewood is scarce. Each village community owns from 50 to 60 donkeys, 300 to 500 sheep, and 5 or 6 cows. The climate of this plain may be assumed not to vary to any appro* ciable extent from that of Bushire. Its summer heat is tempered by no rain, and it well deserves the name of Garmsir, given to it by the Persians. The pasturage during the hot months of the year is burnt up, scant, and of a poor quality; the chief food of all cattle consists of chopped straw and barley, both plentiful. The only supplies procurable from the villages in limited quantities are fowls, sheep, milk, eggs, butter, raughan (ghl), barley, corn, and chopped straw. “ In general terms “ Garmsir ” applies in South-West Persia to the low lands or parts inhabited with comfort during the winter, as opposed to “ Sardsir,” the highlands or summer quarters of the Iliats.” GARRAWAND— A tribe of|the Tihran group of Luristan {q.v.).

GUNJANCHUM— A stream in the Pusht-i-Kuh district of Luristan which emerges from the Karrapi Kuh through a deep rift called the Tang-i-Dakhursa, follows the south-west side of the Gusdana plain, and flows past Hussaineh to the Turkish border. The track from Deh Bala to Kut-ul-’Amareh follows the bed of this stream, and crosses it twice before reaching Hussaineh ; it would therefore be impassable in flood time. The water of this stream is slightly brackish, but drinkable. The Gavi stream joins its left bank just inside Lur territory. — [Maunsell, 1888.) GftPAL— A brackish stream which traverses the great plain common to the Ramuz and Ahwaz districts of ’Arabistan, forming a somewhat serious obstacle on the road between Nasiri and Ramuz town. The Gupal consists at first of merely the surplus water of a canal which takes off from the right bank of the Ramuz river at a point about 5 miles east of Ramuz town. At about 4 miles north of the town the water of the canal is augmented by a brackish tributary, which has its rise in the gypsum hills bounding the Ramuz district on this side: the increased stream continues to flow north-westwards, keeping within a mile of the hills and parallel to them, until the mounds of Kut-ash- Shaikh are passed, lying about 2 miles to the southward. Three or four miles on the Gupal changes direction to the south-west, and so passes about 6 miles north of the village of MIrbacheh. Near this it receives on the left bank two tributaries, the fresh stream which has its course about a mile eastward of MIrbacheh, and the salt Muwailhah stream. About 9 miles after passing MIrbacheh a salt stream from the north called the Kindak falls into the Gupal on its right bank. Eventually, about 12 miles west of MIrbacheh the Gupal intersects the usual route between Nasiri and Ramuz ; there is some choice of crossing places. At this point in its course the water of the Gupal is salt even after rain. The banks, which are in most parts perpendicular and of clay, rise857 about 20 feet above the level of the bed, and the distance between them varies from 20 to 70 yards. In summer the Gupal is almost dry ; in winter it sometimes rises 20 or 30 feet and overflows its banks and at that season it may be found either fordable or unfordable. Quicksands occur. About 300 yards below that point the river bends to the west, and 8 miles farther on it is drawn off in a southerly direction in numerous small canals, some of which, being 3 feet deep, are difficult to cross. The Gupal now ceases to exist, and the surplus water which is not used for the cultiva tion spreads out to from the Shakheh marsh.—(Pem'an Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) GtfR— Lat. 28° 51' N. Long. 52° 33' E. Elev. The ancient name of Firuzabad {q.v.) also Ardashir Khuirih. It was one of the principal town of the Sassanians. Istakhri speaks of it as follows :— ‘ ‘ Gur is on of the foundations of Ardashir—hence the name Gur, or “foundation ”. It is reported that the place where it stands was filled with stagnant water and resembled a lake, and that Ardashir made a vow to build a town on the spot where he should conquer his enemies, and to construct on it a fire temple, and he was victorious at Gur. He contrived to remove the water of the place by making an opening for the water to flow away ; and he built on that spot “ Gfir.” (For further descriptions see Durand.) In short the town would seem to have been built by Ardashir Babakan, the founder of the Sassanian dynasty, on the site of an older town, Gur, and he then changed the name to Ardashir Khuvrih, or ‘ ‘ the glory of Ardashir.” In the 10th century it was taken by Azad-ud-Daulat, who was of the Dilamite dynasty, which held the mastery in Fars in the 10th and part of the 11th centuries. The name then became Firuzabad at the dictates of its new master.—(Hwrawd.) C (Pass, 8,650'. GURAB— Lat. Long. Elev. &lt; (.Valley, 6,000'. A pass and elevated valley in the Bakhtiari country almost due west of Ardal, and on the direct road between that place and Shushtar. The pass (8,650 feet) is one south of the Chari pass, and connects the valley of the Bazuft on the west with the valley of its own name on the east. The latter is perfectly flat, about 4 miles wide by 10 miles long, flanked by the Kuh-i-Isbanieh on the north, and has an elevation of 6,800 feet. A small stream, the Dinar Rud, flows through it with a south-easterly course, and later falls into the Karun river at 5,300 feet, just before that river enters the Tang-i-Ardal.— {Sawyer, 1890 — Arbuthnot, 1905.)

A village in the Tangistan district of Fars, two miles south of ’Al! Changi on the road between Bushire and Ahram, of which it is the inter mediate stage. It contains 50 houses mostly of Shi’ah Saiyids. They are358 GUR-GUR supposed to be of the line of ’ Abb&amp;s but their pedigree is doubtful, conse quently they are treated with little respect by their neighbours. Their claim to wear black turbans has, however, recently been admitted by the Sadr-ul-Islam of Bushire. They are renowned as cheats and swindlers. The dwellings are partly mud and stone and partly mat huts, and are clustered round a masonry building with an upper storey. Wheat, barley and dates are grown. The date palms number about 3,000. Livestock comprises 5 horses, 4 mules, 110 donkeys, 40 camels, 36* cattle and 1300 sheep and goats. In 1893 the population was estimated at 300, most of whom were engaged in date-farming. Supplies. —Dates, sheep, goats, bhiisa and grain. Good water is obtained from one well, while there are several others with good drinking water for animals. Firewood is rather scanty. Good camping-grounds are available. From here a road runs south-by west connecting the sea-coast villages of the district. The place was at one time called also Mir ’Abdullah. The Gurak ridge, which the road is shown on the map as crossing, and which it apparently does not, is important as offering a position facing south west to a force advancing on Bushire from the east or south-east. It com mands the lowlying sandy country towards Bushire, and has a mean elevation of 300 feet above the plain. The northern or right flank is the weakest, and is open to a turning movement under cover of date plantations. The same ridge would also afford a position facing north-east to a force covering Bushire against a force advancing from the east. Its extreme length would, however, necessitate a very strong body of troops to occupy it adequately. It would afford some good artillery positions covering the plain towards the main mountain ridges. The lower ground is also very suitable for the move ment of cavalry, an unusual thing in this part of Persia.— [Jones — Taylor — St. John — Pelley — Durand — Butcher, 1888—Stotherd' 1893—Foreign Depart ment Gazetteer, 1Q08.)* GURAVAN—Lat* .

HAFFAB (Canal)— An artificial canal, forming the short reach by which the river Karun, after the out-take of the Bahmanshlr, discharges its water into the Shatt- al-’Arab. Colonel Bell says that three-fourths of the water of the river Karun comes this way. The canal is between 2 and 3 miles long, 400 yards wide and has a depth of from 3 to 4 fathoms. The head of the canal where the Bahmanshlr. takes out of the Karun is GO miles above the bar outside the fthatt-al-’Arab, 40 miles above the entrance to that estuary at Fau, and 20 miles below the Turkish port of Basrah. When this canal was cut, no one knows. Mr. Watson, in his History of Persia, says it was cut by Alexander the Great in order to avoid the necessity of sailing down the Karun into the Persian Gulf, but there appears to be no ground for this hypothesis. Its construction was presumably intended to open commu nication from the Karun to the Shatt-al-’Arab, and thus promote trade between ’Arabistan and the then existing predecessors of the Turkish ports of Basrah and Baghdad. Some authorities on the other hand believe that the Shatt-al-’Arab once flowed into the Karun by this channel, instead of vice versa as at present, and that the united river then found the sea by the Bahmanshir channel: this, however, does not appear to be a likely hypothesis. On the north banks stands the town of Muhammareh (q.v.), on the southern side are the ruins of an old Persian fort where 60 years ago the Shaikh used to reside, and which, in co-operation with larger works on the northern banks, attempted to dispute the entrance of the river with the British in 1857, It was very speedily silenced and knocked to pieces by the British guns. In 1891 infantry and artillery barracks were built upon this site by the Persian Government, but these are now used as the doctor’s quarters and quarantine station respectively.— (Bell — Curzon, 1889—War Office, Military Pe'port, 1905—Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.)

The village contains some {Preece, 1893.) 2Z2364 HAF—HAI 2,000 inhabitants, with a considerable amount of cultivation surrounding it; supplies of all sorts besides some 800 mules. Water from a stream which runs into the Ab-i-Jehan-Bin near Takun.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.) HAI AT BAUD and RIG (District).— The most northern district, if we except the town of Bandar Dilam, belonging to the province of the Gulf Ports on the coast of Pars. Its capital is Bandar Rig, and the district is situated on the coast of the Persian Gulf between the Liravi district on the north and the Rudhilleh district on the south. Limits. —The Haiat Daud district is bounded on the west by the sea. The eastern boundary in the northern part meets the Kash Kuli branch of the Qashqal, some 15 miles north of a range of hills, called Kuh-i-Haiat Baud, , about 15 miles inland; and in the southern part the boundary is a salt stream called Rudkhaneh-i-Shur, which comes down from a hill called Bikar- zwa-Mishan dividing it from the Shabankareh district. The most northern village is Behmiari and on the south the district extends almost to the Rud hilleh stream ; its maximum length consequently is 40 miles ; but its extent upon the coast is less, as in the north it is overlapped upon the sea by the Liravi district which contains Kuh-i-Bang. The island of Kharak belongs to the Haiat Baud district. Physical Geography. —The whole district appears to be a plain ; it has good soil in certain localities and is intersected by water-courses, some of considerable size, which traverse it from the hills to the sea. Close to Ban dar Rig there is an outcrop of light grey sandstone. The chief features of the coast are a creek, called Khur Qusair, frequented by large boats, midway between Bandar Rig and the Rudhilleh stream; and Khur Khalil, a tidal inlet, 1 mile south of Ganaveh, which is used by the boat owners of that place. Population. —A list of the villages of Haiat Baud is subjoined under the heading of topography. The people are mostly Lurs whose ancestors immigrated from the Behbehan province, partially submerging an ancient Persian population whom local tradition represents as having continued to be Gabars or fire-worshippers till about five centuries ago. In some places there is an infusion of Arabic blood and the village of Gumarunis a settle ment of Saiyids. The total number of the inhabitants appears to be about 12,000 souls. The Persian language wdth Lurish modifications is practi cally universal, so also is the Sln’ah form of the Muhammadan religion. In land the people are cultivators, and upon the coast cultivators, sea-farcrs and fishermen. Outside of Bandar Rig huts are the only kind of dwellings. The generality of the inhabitants are peaceable and partially civilised, but they are well armed with Martinis and possess, it is said, on the average about one rifle to every house. From January to April the population is swollen by Dareh Shuri and Kashkuli Iliats, who camp in the vicinity of I Bandar Rig and make their purchases for the year in the town. Agriculture and Livestock. —Wheat and barley are the agricultural staples, ! • but dates also are cultivated. The banyan, fig and castor-oil plant flourish. There appear to be few cattle, but sheep are numerous and are estimated to amount to 10,000 in the whole district. Water is all from wells.Trade .—The subject of trade is disposed of in the article of Bandar Rig, through which all the external trade of the district passes. The internal trade is of no account. Transport and communications .—The district, it is believed, apart from the town of Bandar Rig, can furnish about 350 horses, 250 camels, 150 mules and 2,000 donkeys. There appear to be no serious obstacles to the move ment of transport. It is possible to march along the coast, and the inland route from Borazjun to Zaidan traverses the district via the villages of Char Rusta, Gah Safid, ’Abbasi, Mahmad Sadi and Bahmiari; there is also a route from Bandar Rig to Deh Kuhneh in the Shabankareh district. Haidar Khan Administration .—The district is governed by a hereditary Khan of Lur descent, who has his residence at Bandar Rig and is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. At present he pays 8,000 tumdns yearly for the farm of the district. Criminal justice is dispensed by this Khan and by one of his brothers who acts as his deputy at Char Rusta. Documents are attested and civil disputes are settled in every village by the local Kazi or Mu 11a, except matrimonial cases which it is usual to refer to the Kazi or Mulla of some neighbouring village. The general administration is conducted through the headmen of the villages, who in this district are termed Raids. There are no regular police, but the retainers of the Khan look to the safety of the roads. Land-revenue is collected at the rate of (50 or 70 brans peigdu of cultivation ; there are no other taxes. The only direct representatives of the Persian Government are a postmaster and a telegraph master at Bandar Rig, and Persian Custom officials at Bandar Rig and Ganaveh. Armed forces. The armed forces at the disposal of Haidar Khan are estimated at 1,500 to 2,000 tufangchis in normal times. In May 1909, Haidar Khan despatched some 400 armed men to Biisffire to assist the Daria Begi in, his expedition to Tangistan. Haidar Hhan can also dispose of the armed forces of Rud Hilleh, some 700 tufangchis, as well as 'ffie contingents of Ganaveh and Liravi, numbers unknown. H; id r Khan afforded courageous personal assistrnce to the British Resident, and H. M. S. Highflyer, in arresting pirates at Ganaveh in 1908. History .—The district abounds with ruins and traces of an extreme civilization which have not yet (1905) been investigated ; and there is much mention, in local traditions, of fire-worship surviving to a comparatively recent period. The bricks found at some of the old sites are said to resem ble those of Ctesiphon. A century ago, the town of Bandar Rig was in the possession of a family of the Zab tribe, who are now found chiefly in Trucial ’Oman ; another account says that the Mir tribe, under Mir Muhanna, were in possession of the town. According to this version the Mirs came from Hindiagan and drove the Persian officials from Bandar Rig, and, at a later date, the Dutch from their settlement on Kharak island. They are said to be the descendants of Mir Muhanna at Kuvait. The leader of the Zab is said to have been Mir Mahran, but he was killed in a practical expedition against Basrah ; the tribe consequently lost their hold on the place, and were succeeded by a family of Lurs whose founder had been a follower of Mir Muhanna. These maintained their position until about 1870 when the father of the present Khan of Bandar Rig, who was already Khan of the Haiat Daud district, succeeded in removing the Bandar Rig Khan of that366 HAI—HAI day, the grandson of the first Lur Khan, by treacherously throwing him down a well at Ar&amp;sh, which he then caused to be filled up. He then- incorporated the Khanate of the town with his own rural Khanate.

HAJAMAL or SHUR or DUNDIL (River)— A river in Laristan which rises in the hills north of Hormuz, and, passing under the west side of that village, flows in a generally south-easterly direction^ Its waters are salt and in the month of April are very scanty. The Lar Bandar Abbas road follows its course for many miles, lying sometimes on one bank and sometimes on the other, and occasionally as when it enters the Tang-i-Shu and the Tang-i-Dalan, lying in the bed of the river itself. The bed is for the most part shallow, with shelving banks, and a pebbly, sandy bottom. It varies in width from 100 to 200 yards except where it passes through the defiles above-mentioned, when the channel becomes much narrower, at one point in the Tang-i-Dalan not exceeding 30 yards. The road continues to follow the stream, which, below the Tang-i-Shuk, is called the 8hur, as far as Jihun, beyond which they separate—the road continuing on its old alignment towards Bandar ’Abbas, the river taking a sudden bend to the south. Its subsequent course is not accurately known, but it probably joins the Maharan, another salt water stream which flows into the sea at Khamlr, some miles above its mouth— (Butcher, April 1888.)

The mines here are very extensive and are situated about an hour’s walk from the seashore. The salt occurs in beds of about 4 feet thick with intervening layers of earthy materials. The beds are hard in consistency and have to be blasted with gunpowder, the masses being subsequently re duced to granules by wooden and iron mallets. Some of the specimens here are of a pale greenish colour from the earth of that tint ; this earth exists in isolated deposits and mounds varying from earthy softness to stony hardness, the green tint seeming to depend on manganese. The quarry ing expenses here seem about one dollar per buhd'i , cami 1-hire being 411 krdns, and boat-hire to Lingeh being 3 krdns, making a total cost of 2^ dollars per buhdr.

The ruins of an ancient Mussalman town in the island of Qais, Persian Gulf. They extend three-quarters of a mile along the shore, and consist now of mere mounds of stone and pavements of masonry ; a mosque, however, which was of well-cut stone, had one minaret standing till about 50 yards ago. The pillars of this mosque were octagonal in section, and the blocks of which they were composed were mortised together by central tenons. This city flourished in the twelfth century, and was the great depot of trade with India and China before Hormuz rose into importance. Several ruined water reservoirs of large size are to be found a quarter of a mile south of the ruins, two of which measured 150 by 40 feet and in 1857 were still 24 feet deep. Aqandt led from these to the town, nearly | a mile in length, cut in the solid rock and running at its deeper end 20 feet below the surface : it had about 10 shafts at intervals of 15 to 20 yards apart, and the bottoms of the shafts were accessible in four cases by a stairway of shallow steps cut in the rock. It contains no water now. The history of Al-Wassaf written in the 12th century may be consulted regarding this place and its trade. A curious legend, exactly resembling that of Whittington’s cat, is there related regarding an old woman of Qais. — {Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot—Pervian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) HARM— Lat.

HAWALAT— A division of the Hamaid tribe {q.v.), HAWIZEH— . The westernmost of the districts of Southern ’Arabistan. It surrounds Hawizeh town, which is about 65 miles north of Muhammareh, and equidistant from the Karun river at Nasiri and the Tigris at ’Azair. On its northern side it is bordered by two parallel hill ranges, called Miniur and Misdakh. The limits of the district are otherwise indefinite. The bulk of the district is be lieved to consist of water channels and marshes, interspersed with pasture grounds and surrounded by barren deserts. The population, those of Hawizeh town excepted, nearly all belong to nomad tribes, and almost all are Shi’ahs by religion. In summer the tribes encamp on the marshes, and in winter they roam the deserts with their flocks and herds. The people of Hawizeh town are the only actually fixed population in the district. The nomads appear to number 60,250 souls. The chief exports of the district are rice, fish and a certain amount of the plumage of birds. Since 1902 the Shaikh of Muhammareh has assumed responsibility for the revenue of the district, and Hawizeh has been included in the administrative division of Southern ’Arabistan.—(Pemaw Gidf Gazetteer, 1908.) HAWIZEH (Town) -Lat. 31° 24'N. Long. 48° 9'E. Elev. ! ' i A town in Southern ’Arabistan, situated about 40 miles west by north of Nasiri in the centre of the Hawizeh district, of which it is the capital. Formerly a large town, it was ruined by the bursting in 1837 of the dam at Nahr Hashim on the Karkheh river, which upset the whole irrigation system of the district, caused the main stream of the Karkheh to take a more northerly course, and reduced the town, which stood on the left bank of its former bed, to comparative insignificance. The greater part of the population was dispersed by this event and joined the wandering Arabs of the district ; the town still boasts of 1,000 houses, and the present population probably does not exceed 5,000 souls. The Kut quarter, the only part of it which now resembles a town, lies farthest to the south ; the others are Sakiyeh not so far to the south, Nais on the south-west and Ahl-i-Juruf on the north ; the three last are named from the tribes inhabiting them, of whom some details are given in the article on Hawizeh district. A large part of the population which is reckoned to the town is said to be massed on a canal called the Dahabiyeh on the west side of the settlement. The whole population is Shi’ah except 3 Arab shop-keepers from Najd aud 20 families of Sabians ; of the latter 12 are gold smiths and 2 iron-smiths but none are agriculturists. 112 I. B, 3 BS78 HAW-HAZ The water of Hawizeh town is now bad as well as scanty, but it remaina- the seat of the hereditary Vali, who governs it and its immediate neighbour hood under the Shaikh of Muhammareb. Hawizeh in the 14th century A.D. was one of the most flourishing places in ’Arabistan, and the centre oi a dis trict which produced corn, cotton and sugarcane. The Sabian community already existed at that time.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) HAZAR CHAM— Lat. Long. Elev. 6,750'.

The road from the Mama pass to Tumatuma runs through Hazir Mil.— (Burton.) HAZSHDANA (valley or plain)— A plain in Luristan south-west of Deh Bala, and between the outer or southern range of the Pusht-i-Kuh and the middle range. It is about 4 miles in breadth from north-east to south-west, and of a length not exactly known but considerably over 8 miles. Its elevation is from 1,500 to 1,800 feet : to the south-east it adjoins the Bahuravan plain, from which it is separated by some broken ground and a low spur of hills. The Imamzad- eh-Khaseh-’AH is situated on its southern border, and its blue dome is visible at a great distance. The plain forms a winter camping-ground of theFail! Luts. The hills on the south side of it are bare, while those on the north have a few small trees and a number of bushes. The centre of the plain is covered with low bushes and there is grazing on the other parts. There are always a few Lurs to be met with camped near the hills on its north side near springs, but water is scarce during the autumn. Loads run across it to Mandall, distant about 45 miles, and to Kut-sJ- Amareh, distant 98 miles.— (V.) HlADIR— A sub-division of the Ban! Saleh tribe {q. v.).

A village in the Bakhtiari country, situated in a valley of the same name, through which the Bakhtiari caravan road runs for a few miles on leaving the caravanserai at Sarkhun, on its 8th stage from Isfahan. The valley runs almost due north and south, the village being situated on the left bank of a stream of the same name. The valley is well cultivated with wheat and barley, but the village itself has a poor aspect and supplies are scarce at some seasons of the year. It belongs to peasant proprietors. 54,000 lbs. of grain and 13,000 lbs. of rice arc sown annually. The number of houses is estimated, in 1906, at 400, and of fighting-men at 500. The livestock comprises 40 horses, 30 mules, 5,000 donkeys, 500 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. 200.000 mans of wheat and barley are produced annually. 500 tumdns cash, 100 maws of rice and 30 of ghi are paidjn revenue annually. There is a tax of 10 Jcrdns on each mare, 5 krdns on each pair of oxen and ^ krdns on sheep.— (Preece, 1895—Arouthnoi, 1905- Report of a Journey through the Bakhtidri Country to Shiishtar—Lorimer, 1906.)

A stream in the Bakthiari country, which bursts out at the foot of a great, precipitous wall of the Kuh-i-Sarkhun, immediately facing the caravanserai of the same name, and, running an almost due southerly course, waters the Hilisat valley. Th ewater at its spring head, where it is crossed by a wooden bridge, is of crystal purity, and gushes out with such force as to form a fair siz ed stream before it has run a course of 20 yards. Its total length is about 20 miles, when it falls into the Karun river at about the 152nd mile of the latter’s course, and at 3,550 feet above sea-level.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.) HIMMATlBAD— Lat. Long.

W. tower of village fort) 26° 41' 9'; Long. 53° 37' 31. An island near the coast of the Shfbkuh district : its eastern extremity is about 4^ miles west-north-west of Chiru. Hindarabi is over 4 miles in length from east to west and nearly 3 miles in breadth : and separated from the mainland by a strait, 4 miles broad, the navigation of which is very dangerous. It is of a brown colour, and rises gradually from the side to a flat centre about 100 feet above sea-level. There is no natural vegetation except a certain amount of grass in spring. The island is fringed by a reef which impedes landing at low water, and is surrounded by pearl banks except at one place on the east side. About the middle of the north shore is situated the village of Hindarabi, in which are about 100 houses of ’Ubaidli Arabs, Sunnis ; it possesses wells of which the water is brackish in summer, a few banyan trees and some cultiva tion of wheat and barley ; the flocks and herds amount to about 50 cattle and 100 goats. There are about 400 date-palms, chiefly on the west side of the village. The people are mostly fishermen and pearl-divers owning 15 or 20 small craft, baqdrehs and shu'ais, which they use for fishing in winter and for pearling near the island in summer. Hindarabi island is subject to the’Ubaidli Shaikh of Chiru whose local representative is styled Naib. About a quarter of the fighting men are armed with modern rifles.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) The harbour is safe and commodious, and a vessel is well sheltered in it from a north-west wind. The water is deep close to the land, with 6£ fathoms and a soft mud bottom. The strait of Hindarabi is formed by the island and the mainland. It has regular somdings all over until you approach the reef of Ras-ul-Chiru, when it suddenly shoals from 17 to 10, 5 and 4 fathoms, under which depth a vessel should not go. There is no danger outside 5 fathoms towards the island, of 4 fathems ou the spit, the channel between these having from 22 to 27 fathoms. The narrowest pert is between the island a^d Chiru reef, being there only one mile wide. A course, one-third over from the island in passing Ras-ul-Chiru, will be found the best.—(Bmc&amp;s.) HINDIAN (Distkict)— The most eastern and one of the most extensive districts in Southern * Arab! stan. The name is locally pronounced Hindian. According to local tradition the Hindian district was once held by the Portuguese. Extent. —The Hindian district is enclosed on the south by the Persian Gulf on the west by a khait, or strip of slightly elevated, land, which runs more or less parallel to the Hindian river about midway between it and Bandar Ma’shur; on the north by a line traversing part of the Shah Nabi plain eastwards to some hills, along wdiich it continues to a point near Gargari, a distance in all of about 15 miles i on the east by a line winch cuts obliquely across the maritime range from Gargari to a point on the coastsappi HIN-HIN 381 between Shah Abul Shah and Bandar Dilam. This district has thus a length upon the coast of about 50 miles and a depth inland of about 30 miles. Physical characteristics .—Neglecting thehills which run from the north-east corner of the district to the neighbourhoid of the sea at Shah Abul Shah, and which encroach but little on the surface of the district, we may say that the Hindian district consists wholly of plains. The soil is saline in places, but generally it is good and firm ; and the prairies, grass- covered after rain, seem to offer every advantage for the breeding of cattle and horses. The chief feature of the district is the Hindian river,—for a description of which vide this Gazetteer. The sea is shallow upon the Hindian coast, and as a rule a depth of as much as 3 fathoms is not found within 4 miles of land. CZimcde.—The climate is described as salubrious and is not unhealthy. Hot dry winds from the north-west prevail in the summer, but in some years the temperature has ceased to be unpleasant as early as September. Popidation .—An idea of the composition of the population may be obtain ed from the list of villages on the banks of the river Hindian : vide this Gazetteer. The principal inhabited places are Hindian town and Deh Mulla. The only village on the coast is Shah Abul Shah—for a description of which vide this Gazetteer. The fixed inhabitants number some 14,000 souls and to these must be added a quota on account of nomad tribes, including Sharifat, who wander in the district. The settled population includes both Arab« and Persians ; some of the latter call themselves “ Koya.” The following table gives the principal tribes of the district, but few of whom are common to the other districts of Arabistan :— !

Agriculture.—Cultivation is confined to the vicinity of the river. From Deh Mulla downwards it is all Daimi, that is, dependent on rainfall : above it is Fdridb or irrigated. There appears to be no impediment to the con struction of canals on the lower course of the river, apart, from the poverty and indolence of the cultivating classes. The nature of the canals is noticed in the article on the Hindian river (q.v.). On the Lanjir canal rice is grown; elsewhere the chief cereals are wdieat and barley, the quantity of wheat standing to that of barley in the proportion of 4 to 1. Other common crops are beans, sesame and linseed (kitan buzurg), musk-nw-im from .ce 0 | They mtlie l^ii, IlOWD, : 1845 ine, iiak caled from % Ndir riiapa Fere the dis- they 'tom iMj&gt; j. « oi said 1 years escape totra- aera i K4 aaffit liriiit ,raki in iUt® ataent dollliIl■ F101 : ,e coi- loverty nals is ■ caul iy t tie I to L must 38^ melons and Water-melons. Owing to the uncertainty of the rainfall in rect nt years, cultivators in the Hindian district have adopted the practice of storing the grain of one season in large mud receptacles outside their houses, until the prospects of the next crop are assured. Each village possesses a due complement of donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats, besides a - few mares, and in the wet tract at the head of the district there are some herds of buffaloes. The cattle of tne district are humped. Grain is sold by weight. The unit of landmeasurement is the gdii or area that a pair of bullocks are supposed to plough in a day. Trade and Communications. —The only exports of value are grain and wool which leave the district in considerable quantities. Horse-breeding is on &lt; the decline, and the stamp of animal prcduc'd is not saleable in the Bombay c market., Tim imports consist of the ordinary necessities and simple luxuries which the district does not produce. There are no local manufactures. The Hindian village man is. equal to about 240 and the Deh Muila man to about 2471 lbs. English. Thg plains of the district present no obstacles to the movement of man or : beast, except such as arise from their being slippery after rain, and are waterless at other times. The most frequented routes starting from Hindian ; village are :— 1. To Bandar Dilam by Shah Abul Shah. An adjacent route is from Chehil Mani to Shah Abul Shah, 24 miles ; the track first crosses good graz ing land with numerous flocks of goats and sheep; at about 14 miles it tra verses a plain with sparse herbiage which is muddy in wet weather, and near Bandar Dilam it runs along some sand-dunes between mud-flats and the sea. 2. To Zaidan by Chehil Mani and the Karseh pass 9 farsakhs, about 31 miles. 3. To Zaidan by the river bank 16 farsakhs, about 56 miles. 4. To Jaizan in the Ramuz district by Deh Muila and Asiab 21 farsakhs, about 73 miles. There are also two routes from Hindian town to Behbehan town : one by Zaidan, from which the route lies for 25 or 30 miles northwards towards Behbehan ; the other Gargari to Cham Siah on the Marun river, and up that stream to Behbehan. A track to Bandar Ma’shur, moreover, leaves the right bank of the Hindian river at ’Abad Ilahi; and the rght bank of this river is a highway through out the length of the district. There is a small boat-ferry about 4 miles below Deh Mulla. Supplies and Transport. —No statistics are to hand as to the amount of grain or other supplies procurable in this district. Grain, however, is grown in every village, and a list of the villages of the district will be found in this Gazetteer, vide Hindian river. Each village is separately described in this Gazetteer. The villages muster among them (1905) a total of some 200 horses, 4,700 donkeys, 1,000 camels, 30 mules ; 4,800 cattle, and 24,000 sheep. Administration. —The Hindian district is subject tothe Shaikh of Muham- mareh, wdio has officials representing him at Hindian village and Deh Muila. The tenure on which he holds it has not been precisely ascertained. . - Tne revenue is ^fluctuating, and is assessed at so many tumdns per gdu of384 HIN-HIN actual cultivation. In 1905 the revenue of the Deh Mulla neighbourhood was farmed for 5,000 tfwmaws, and the revenue of the rest of the district for 18.000 turnons’, this was an advance on former years and has not been realiz ed without hardship and oppression. The Imperial Persian Customs have posts at Hindian town and at Tuwaisheh near the coast. In the 10th century the Hindian district contained the remains of afire- temple and some water wheels of ancient construction. The local tradition that the Portuguese once held the district receives some support from tlm fact that the name “ Purgal ” is still recognized, and that there are traces of buildings and several old iron guns of the usual Portu guese type at Deh Mulla. Deh Mulla may perhaps have been a Portuguese factory, the river being then navigable above Hindian town as it was to some extent, as late as 1836.— (Bailward — Gabriel—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) HINDIAN (Kiver) or ZAIDAN or AB ZUHREH— This river is formed by the junction in the plain of Zaidan at a point 22 miles north by west from Bandar Dilam on the coast, of two streams, the Khairabad or Ab-i-Shirin and the Shulistan or Ab Shur, both from the east ward. The more northern of the two streams, the Khairabad, is sweet; it is said to take its name from a ruined settlement upon its right bank a few miles above its junction, and to take its rise in a high range of mountains in the Kuhgalu Lur country. In its course the Khairabadjgathers to itself the water of several streams, of which the chief are the Zuhreh and the Kumbal. The Shulistan, which has bitter waters, is stated to have its origin in a mass of hills to the wes't of the Kazarun-Shiraz road which were former ly inhabited by a tribe called Shul, and have now been occupied for some centuries by the Mamassanis. The Shulistan, like the Khairabad river, has several tributaries, and one of these, the Shish Pir, which comes down from the north of Shiraz, is exceedingly bitter, strongly impregnating the Shulistan and even tainting the Hindian below the junction with the Khair abad, yet not in such degree as to make the water of the Hindian undrink able. Even at the driest season of the year the Khairabad and Shulistan are both considerable streams, with a breadth, at their junction, of 25 yards and having a shingly bottom. The upper course of the river formed by their union is generally known by the name of ^Zaidan not of Hindian, and may be taken as extending from Haidar Karar, a small Imamzadeh situated on the tongue of land between the Khairabad and the Shulistan, to the border of the Hindian district, where it issues from the hills ; in other words the length of this section is about 30 miles and its direction is from east-south-east to west-north-west. Here the Zaidan flows with a breadth of about 70 yards and a strong current of miles an hour through the Zaidan plain, a valley, 5 miles wide, governed from Behbehan, and enclosed between a northern and a southern range of hills : the former has an elevation of about 1,500 feet, and the latter, which is the subsidiary maritime range forming the island boundary of the Liravi district, of about 1,000. The caravan route from Bandar Dilam to Beh behan crosses the river near Cham Zaidan, where there are two or three fords : the bottom there is shingly and good, but the strength of the currentnecessitates care ic crossing with laden animals. The average depth here is from 3 to 4 feet, and the current running afc 34 to 4 miles an hour over a firm, shingly bottom. In February, however, Lieutenant-Colonel Bell found it hard to cross. He says : “At this season the river is both deep and rapid and it is necessary to pass up stream about 3 miles and to ford it to the south-west of the village Sardasht, where it flows in three channels; its right banks are low and pebbly; its bed is covered with boulders ; its width is from 600 to 800 yards ; the deepest channel is about 3 feet 6 inches deep ; it must be forded with care ; its right bank is fringed by a belt of low bushes ; its left bank is elevated 20 to 30 feet above the stream. There are a few huts and a little cultivation close at hand on the left bank near the ford.’ 5 The valley hereabouts is well cultivated, wheat being the staple product ; a considerable quantity of rice is also grown. Cham Zaidan is situated ^ mile north of the right bank of the river. The villages and other notable places in the Zaidan plain are given in the article ‘ ‘ Zaidan, 5 5 vide this Gazetteer. Cham Zaidan is at present (1905) the head-quarters of the representative of the Shaikh of Muhammareh in this district. The total population of the valley is 3,000 souls, distributed in small hamlets containing from 50 to 200 inhabitants each, the chief being Zaidan, Sardasht, and Askari, the latter being situated close to the confluence of the two streams form ing the Hindian river, and some 6 miles east of Zaidan. Opposite Lanjir, which is on the left bank of the river some 14 miles below Cham Zaidan, the river throws off an artificial canal, which, circling round to the west-north west and then to the west-south-west, passes the villages of Cham Char- ata, Upper Gargari, Lower Gargari, and Asib ; and reaches Suvaireh, there to be absorbed by numerous small distributaries, when on the point of rejoining the main stream. The Lower or Hindian course of the river begins between the village of Ghuleh and the Hindian village of Shirabad. It is doubtful whether Ghuleh belongs to Hindian or Behbehan. The stream now, turning the north end of Funnel Hill, emerges on the open plains of the Hindian district. From Shirabad it runs first for 5 miles west-north-west to Suvaireh ; it then turns, and its average direction from Suvaireh to Hindian village, a distance of 22 miles in a straight line, is due southwards. Passing Kut and Deh Mulla, 4 miles below which are a village and a small boat-ferry, the river continues southwards until Hindian town, which stands on both banks of the river, is reached. At Hindian town the river is unfordable, the breadth in February being about 8 yards. It can, though, be forded 9 miles above the town. From here its course becomes winding and, after all but reaching the sea at a place 10 miles south-south-west of Hindian village, it meanders due westwards for another 9 miles, keeping within 2 or 3 miles of the coast the whole way, and eventually attains the Persian Gulf at a point 16 miles south-west-west of Hindian village as the crow flies, but double that distance from it by water. At its embouchure the Hindian cuts its way through mud-flats, and its mouth is difficult to discover from seawards ^ owing to the flatness of the coast. The entrance has not been examined since 1836, 112 I B. 3 C386 HIN-HIN when' a bar of soft clay was in process of formation which it was feared might impede navigation ; but it is still navigable for native sea-going craft up Hindian village, but not farther. In 1836 vessels of 20 and 30 tons burden used to ascend as far as Kut though even at the time few boats proceeded above Hindian town. Boats can, and still do, ascend to the latter place. The navigation of the river was examined by Lieutenant Whitelocke of the Indian Navy in 1836, who, inter alia, reported as follows :— ‘ ‘ The entrance to this river is in latitude 30° 4' 30' north. It is difficult to find, as there are no landmarks to guide you ; you must be acquainted with the soundings to find the entrance. From Bushire b &gt;ats steer in awest- north-westerly direction carrying 5 or 6 fathoms from Ras Shut. Keeping in this depth of water, you will be about 5 or 6 miles from the coast. Off the Khur of Bahrakan, you will lessen your water to and 2 fathoms ; you steer then about south-south-west, and south, altering it as your depth of water will guide you. “ In this Khur you have from two fathoms to If, I* and 1 fathom high water. This Khur leads into the Khur of Hindian. The Khur of Hindian extends about here 1| or 2 miles from the river ; you will be steering, when you enter this Khur, east and east-north-east carrying from 1 to 1| fathoms. The hill called Kalat, the nearest range, bears about north-east by north. The distant hills behind Kalat, which are higher, and are called Zattam, bear from north | east to east by north. The banks of the river at the entrance are covered with bulrushes for about 2 or 3 miles ; no other vegetation. “ At a place called Nakhal Bagush, there are one or two date-groves. Two miles from ihis is another date-grove, but none afterwards until you reach Hindian town, nor any signs of vegetation with the exception of a few tamarisk trees. “ From the entrance you have 2f and 3 fathoms low water as far as Gaz’ Ali in September. The banks for some miles are low and covered with a layer of salt, but gradually rise in height, from a village called Annonat to the town of kut. I lie use and fall, as far as Gaz Ali, is 10 or 11 feet spring tides water is sweet and very clear ; the bottom hard mud. Thi « rive y is about 200 feet wide at the entrance ; at Gaz ’Ali not so wide, but at Hindian town only 180 feet, at Deh Mulla 150 feet, and at Kut not more than 100 feet. . In April, May, June, and July, when the water comes from the hills, it overflows the bank, 15 feet high. Jhere are plenty of fish in the ri\er, one kind in particular of about a foot in mngth, vhich sticks to the bottom of the boats, and causes them to ieak. Unless you are very careful in examining them well and often, it is probable that all your cargo and goods will be spoiled in one night. I had s-vora spoiled during a night, and found early in the morning the boat half fall of water. The boats that come up the river are from 20 to 30 tons. But they cannot go farther than Kut, as the water is low and there are several ' banks reaching across the river.”The^ average width of the river from Deh Mulla to its mouth is from 50 to 70 yards ; but at Kut it is said to be less than 35 ; the height of its banks diminishes from 25 feet at Kut to 20 at Deh Mulla, 14 at Hindian town, and 8 at Ga ’All. Above Suvaireh the Hindian is broken up into more than one channel, but from Suvaireh downwards it flows in a single bed, having high bank and a nearly constant^ width of about 60 yards. The bottom from the beginning of the district till 6 miles below Suvaireh is shingly, and thence to the sea it is of hard mud. The water of the Hindian is drinkable, as already observed, though impregnated with a salt or alkali brought down by the Shulistan, which gives it a bitter taste but does not prevent the lathering of soap ; It has, however, been reported as sweet and clear in September. In winter the river flows with a strong current throughout its course. The country on both sides of the river consists of featureless plains which the stream, except near the north end of the district, has not been utilised to irrigate. Here and there are patches of musk and water-melons in the actual bed, but the banks bear nothing except an occasional tamarisk until a fine grove of tall date-trees, called Nakhl Bagush, belonging to Tuwaisheh is reached near the river mouth. The banks for the last 2 or 3 miles before reaching the sea are covered with bulrushes. From Gargar to 6 miles below Suvaireh there is irrigation by means of 'jubs, or water-cuts, taking off from various natural branches of the river. . The following is a list of the villages on or near the river i n the Hindian district where supplies and livestock are procurable. Each is described separately under its own name in this Gazetteer. The villages are given in the order in which they occur descending the river Hindian from Gar°'ar downwards :— 29. GharabT Kuchik. 30. GharabI Buzurg. 31. Cham Sha’abana 32.

Formerly that part of the town only which is on the right bank of the river belonged to the Shaikh of the Ka’b Arabs, whilst that on the left bank was under the governor of Behbehan ; but now the town is, like the rest of the district, under the Shaikh of Muhammareh, and is controlled by his representative. The inhabitants consist of Qanawatls, Sharifat, Haiad, and Ka’b Arabs of the Sha’abanI section (here called Shabrunis), the last predominating. The people are cultivators of grain, boatmen and traders, and possess some 20 horses, 800 cattle and donkeys and 1,000 sheep and goats. A political agent on the part of the Shaikh of Muhammareh has his residence here ; and the town also contains a post of the Persian Imperial ! Customs, which is reported to produce 18,000 tumans a year. There is no telegraph, but communication is maintained with Behbehan and Bushire by the Persian Post Office. Ophthalmia is the prevailing disease. Bell says the water of the river is scarcely drinkable in February, being tainted in passing through the low hills south of Zaidan. In September it is reported sweet and clear. ( Petty — Bell — Gabriel—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) HINJlN or HINIJAN-Lat. 31° 58'N. Long. 51 0 37'E. ^ r 8605' Lawrence and Mayo.

MATS— The name given in Persia to designate those tribes who lead a wander ing life, and who subsist by their flocks, “ The Iliats are not originally Persians, but may be compared to foreign shoots grafted on the main stalk. The original Persian is to be found in the cities and in the old established towns and districts of the provinces. The accretion of new population flowed in both from the east and from the west. Until the conquest of Persia by the Saracens, her people might be said to be unmixed ; they, having conquered the country, spread themselves even to Balkh, Bukhara, and Marv, were incorporated with the Persian nation, and, it is said, first innoculated it with roving propensities. The next tribe of wanderers was brought from the east in 1234 with Jangiz Khan, which was followed by Timur, who crossed and re-crossed Persia so fre quently that many of his hordes were left in Turkey. Such, in general terms, may be called the origin of the Iliats, but each tribe has its own particularhistory, recording whence it came and by whom it was introduced into Persia. Many have become inhabitants of cities and villages ; there fore the tribes are classed into what are called Shafrr Nishin, or dwellers inILI-ILI 39T s &gt; * (Zqa^ citips, or Sahra Nishin, or dwellers in the field. A few only have adhered to their original modes of life, and abide all the year round in tents, in the winter keeping to the plains, and in the summer seeking the pasturage of the mountains. In their own estimation they look upon the Shahr Nishlns as degenerate, applauding the hardihood and simplicity of manners of those who have no other dwelling-place than the tent, and reviling those who recur to the luxuries of a house and the protection of a city. “ The principal tribes are as follows :— 1, Kajar 2, Afstar ; 3, ’ Arab ; 4, Lak ; 5, Faili; 6, Bavat; 7, Kurd ; 8, Kurd Bachah ; 9, Aimak ; 10, Hazareh ; 11, Baluch; 12, Bajilan ; 13, Khuda Bandehlu ; 14, Bakhtiari; 15, ShakhagI; 16, Shah-Sivan ; 17, Mamassani. It does not appear that any of the tribes have written records, and it must be confessed that the information here acquired concerning their numbers must be held as very uncertain. The traditions of the tribes are oral, and whenever they pretend to great anti quity, they immediately ascend to the fabulous ages of their historians, where all is darkness, and they do not possess any popular ballads, which can throw light upon their history. Each tribe has a patois of its own, bearing more or less affinity to the Persian, but whatever books they possess are in the Persian language. “ The different tribes are now so much spread throughout the provinces that they have almost lost that union which could render them formidable. It is evidently the policy of the Government to disperse them, and it does so, keeping their chiefs as hostages about the person of the king. Great efforts have been made to disperse the Arab tribes, but ineffectually; consequently, their chiefs are feared, and precautions taken to secure proper hostages for their good behaviour. “ 8uch of the tribes as have become inhabitants of cities are subject to the laws and regulations which rule the community they have adopted : general ly speaking, they are employed as servants, attached to their Khans, either in a military or domestic capacity. “The /SaAra AfsAins, although taxed in various ways and made to contri bute to the military exigencies of the state, are comparatively less molested than the other inhabitants. Their wealth consists principally in cattle, which yield them a considerable revenue, and which they prefer to that produced by the cultivation of the soil. They breed camels and horses for sale, and their sheep yield milk, which is made into raughan (liquid butter) and sold throughout the country. The peculiar privileges of the Iliats consist' in liberty to range over districts from which no one can dispossess them. They ascend in the summer to cold regions called ydildqs, where they find pasture, and in the winter keep to their qishldq tracts, which enjoy a warmer climate. These ydildqs and qishldqs are defined to each tribe by the Government, and whenever their limits are encroached upon by unprivileged tribes, violent strifes and battles ensue. “ The existence of these migratory tribes being advantageous to the Gov ernment, they are little oppressed. They are taxed at certain established rates upon each head of cattle, and are called upon to serve in the king’s armies. They pay at the rate of five piastres for each camel, one piastre for each cow, the same for mares, one ’abbdsi, or quarter-piastre, for a sheep. When they cultivate the ground, they are fined according to the rates398 ILI-ILI exacted from the other raiyats. Should they not be cultivators, each ten khdnehs (houses) provide one horseman, mounted and armed ; and each five, one footman, or tufangchl. These receive forage from the Shah. The horse man’s pay is about eight tumdns annually, for which he serves six months in the field; the other six he remains at home. He is paid twice in the year, half and half in advance, and during the time he is in actual service receives a daily allowance of one man of barley for his horse, and straw in proportion. The horsemen are obliged to attend the muster and the review,, which the king makes after the Nauruz, of all his troops, properly mounted and equipped, or they are severely punished. The tufangchl, or foot soldier, gets 7 tumdns per annum, and half the year remains at home. The wages are paid into the hands of the Khan of the tribe, who then delivers over the money to the subaltern officers, called Sultans and Bimldshls, who pay the soldiers. This promotes peculation ; the Khan subtracting his share, the Mlrzd or scribe his, and the subalterns theirs, while the poor soldier deems himself very lucky if he gets one-half of that which is his due. Agha Muham mad Shah, the eunuch king, used to pay the troops with his own hand. The great advantage of being military servants is protection to their families, the Governors of villages and other men in office not daring to molest them under such circumstances. “ The Tliats are not compelled to bestow their labour upon public works like the other ra’iyat ; they keep exclusively to their tents and tend their cattle. The taxes they pay are levied by their chiefs, who account with the government. Those who are inclined to elude taxation frequently do so by hi ding^their cattle in the mountains. “ In their different small communities, they are governed by Kish Safids (literally “white beards” ) or elders, who have no other emblem of power or superiority to show than a white beard. Old age is extremely respected by them and generally by all Persians, and is indulged with great liberties. A Kish Safid, a poor, miserable old man, will not fail, whenever his tribe is oppressed, to make a journey purposely to remonstrate with the governor of the province, and abuse him to his face ; and so careful are the Governors not to offend these influential persons that they bear their reproof with moderation, and are fain to be civil. Their disputes are decided by their Kish Safids; even the ordinances of their hakims', or governors, are referred to them. In all cases of marriage the elder is first consulted and his consent procured as a preliminary. The tribes seldom intermarry. The elders recommend families whose daughters may be selected for wives ; but, whenever one refuses to give their daughters in marriage to another, it is esteemed an affront and a motive for strife. “ The Persian Government is ever jealous of the migration of these tribes, and they cannot remove from one province to another without first having obtained the Shah’s permission. In times of trouble, such as the death of the king, frequently, if they be strong enough to encounter opposition, they pass from their old haunts to better places. “ We have said before that the possessions of the Illats consist of cattle. These are camels, horses, mares, cows, oxen, mules, asses, sheep, and goats, besides a fine race of dogs. Their pastures, although open to the Shah, the princes, and the other great men of the country, may also be said to betheir property, inasmuch as they have liberty to range over them, unless there has been issued a quruq, or prohibition. ‘ ‘ From the pastures which are appropriated to the use of the Shah and the princes, such as Sultanieh, Ujan, etc., they are totally excluded, unless they receive permission, for which they pay a certain quantity of the produce of their flocks. For instance, in 1815 the Shah did not go to Sultanieh, and he allowed the Iliats to feed their cattle there, provided they furnished him with 1,000 mans of raughan or preserved butter. ‘ ‘ Their property, if it may be so called, consists of tents, carpets, bedding, cooking utensils, large cauldrons in which they boil the raughan, or preserved butter, skins to shake the butter and sour milk in, and all the rude furniture of shepherds. Much of their furniture consists of camel pack, saddles, ornamented bridles form the chief camel, besides other ornaments in beads, etc. Among the Kurdish tribes the women ride in Jcajawahs, which are cage-like panniers placed on each side of the camel, each large enough to contain a woman. Then there are saddles for horses and paldns for mules, and a sort of padded cushion for the back of their tents. ‘ ‘ An Iliat of middling fortune possesses about a hundred sheep, three or four camels, three or four mares, ten asses, etc., which may yield him a revenue of 40 to 50 tumdns. A man who possesses a thousand sheep, thirty camels, twenty mares, etc., is reckoned a rich man. Each sheep may be valued at 2 piastres, a camel at 10, a mare at 8, and an ass at 3. Such a property would yield a revenue of 400 tumdns. This is derived from the wool and milk of sheep, the wool and hire of the camels, the colts from the mares and asses ; the female camel brings forth once every two years, the mare every year, and the sheep once a year. In some parts of Persia, particularly among the Kurds, who enjoy the finest pasturage, the ewes produce twice a year. There are a few rich Persians, whose possessions and modes of life assimilate to those of the patriarchs of old. Such was I’sa-Khan of Turbat, who was calculated to possess 160,000 sheep, 20,000 camels, 6,000 mares and other cattle in proportion. Ahmad Khan of Maragheh, was also an immensely rich farmer. The Vail of Sihneh and several others, might also be classed among those leading patriarchal lives. “ The patrimony of an Iliat is divided among his children, according to the Mussulman law: two-thirds to the sons, and one-third to the daughters, the latter taking the clothes and valuables belonging to the mother. “ The value of an Iliat tents is about 6 to 7 tumdns. It is made of goats’ hair, consisting of cloths about a foot and a quarter in width, woven by the woman. All the members of the family—men, women, and children— are usually employed spinning goats’ hair, which is either in actual use in the loom or laid by for sale. ‘ ‘ They weave the cloth in a portable loom, which they fix in the rudest manner possible, but which answers all the purposes for which it is intended. This cloth is of strong tecture, impervious to rain, and will last 20 years. The covering of one of the tents is generally about 40 feet in length and 20 in breadth, and is erected upon a range of poles, the back and sides being fitted up with reeds, made into walls, and is fastened to400 ILI—ILI K the ground with pegs. The tents are extremely rude, and do not show any appearance of attention to comfort. In Azarbaijan, and the more northern and consequently rainy countries, they have another sort of tent which has been borrowed from the Turkomans. This consists of ribs united, and, when open, is like a cage on which thick felts are thrown, and it is entered by a narrow door ; it is called aldchuq ; the goats’ hair tents are called ‘ kara chadar,’ or black tents. “ The encampments of the Iliats are generally of about twenty to thirty tents together, which they pitch mostly without any great attention to regularity. They are also to be seen in a circle, as well as in line, and appear conspicuous on a light soil owing to their black colour ; on a dark soil they are scarcely perceptible, particularly under the shadow of a moun tain. The tents are close to each other, but the different encampments may be a mile or two asunder, according to the convenience of grass and water. “ The Iliats feed principally on the produce of their flocks, and eat sour milk, cheese, dough or buttermilk, and much rauyhan or preserved butter. Their annual expenses are much less than those of the inhabitants of cities ; for, excepting their clothes, copper utensils, pack-saddles, and ornamental luxuries, they supply all their own necessities. Their simple manner of living (not to mention their being out of the way of extortion) may be cal culated at one hundred per cent, cheaper than in the town. They make their own tents or dwelling-places, weave their own carpets and hammocks or felts, cut their own wood and burn their own charcoal; they kill their own meat, make their cheese and butter, and their lives are far more free from disease and local complaints. Their dress does not differ from that of other Persians, except in its extreme meanness. A man rich in cattle will appear with a coat to his back that scarcely holds together, and in such indifierent dresses, but with no other covering over their heads than their tents, their women and children will brave all the rigour of winter. The favourite wife or child enjoys whatever luxury of dress belongs to the tribe, consisting of gold bracelets, necklaces, silver and gold ornaments for the hair ; frequently a handkerchief is edged with perforated silver coins, and bandeaus of the same are tied about the head and neck. It is not uncom mon to meet with ancient medals suspended about the neck and heads of the Iliat women and children. “ The time of the Iliat’s rest is the winter, when his flocks are not produc tive and require no other care than being led to pasture. The men then help the women to weave carpets and tent cloths, or spin goats hair. At the approach of spring all is then full of activity: the ewes bring forth, then the lambs are tented, then shearing comes on, the flocks require constant milk- ^ ing, and the numerous uses to which the milk is consigned, that is butter, dough, and raughan, require much work, which the men perform. The women, too, are very laborious ; they pitch and unpitch encampments when on a march, load and unload the beats of burden, attend the children and the young animals ; they sit down in companies to spin, and help to churn and make sour milk. The drudgery is for the women ; the business of pro tection, purchase, and sale, and all the greater interests of the community for the males.V ILI—ILl 401 show mote )rtoi flits 'own, tail 1 to ntion and dark oiin- my 'and sour utter, ities; ental ir of cal- lake ucks ikii fee tkat attle suck ieir Tke fete, i tie i, and ncoffi- ads of rodnc- a felp Attke len tlie t milk- k butter, i. Tbe ts when ten and ocburn off ununity ' The Iliats break up their winter encampments one month after _ e festival of the Nauruz—i.e., one month after the sun has entered the sign Aries—and travel by easy journeys of 2 to 3 miles each day to wha iey call the Sarhad, or the boundary between the cold and hot region . there they stay for about a month, and then travel on again to their xai aq 5 Where they encamp during the heat of summer and where they remain about seventy days ; they then return to the Sarhad, where they remain another month, and at length reach their old haunts m the qishlaq ^or the winter. Many direct their motions by the rising of the stars, and many y the appearance of the snowy mountains. They are unmolested m their passage, and perhaps may give a sheep or so to the lords of the vil ag &gt; which they travel. The ground upon which they encamp is improve y their presence, since it is strengthened by the manure they leave. “ Their mode of calculating property is by sheep ; they pay their shepherds in sheep. In their own dealings, in their purchase of oxen, etc they pay in sheep. A man killing one of their dogs is liable to be_ fined 4 sheep. Among the villages, too, in their smaller dealings, the Persian ra tyat deals with his neighbour, not in money, but in kind—corn, wool, straw, etc. Three months after the Nauruz, they separate the rams from the ewes and feed them till they are mast. At the beginning of the sign Mmn, or Libra, they turn them into the flock, by which the ewes bear at about the A auruz, and some of the Iliats celebrate this event by music, songs, and merry-ma_- ing. Shearing takes place twice in the year ; the firstfime after the auru &gt; about the 20th of May ; and the second at the Mizan. They give of their wool and other produce of their flocks, which is called by the general name of kashf , to the poor in alms. At the time of the new lambs they take po - tions of their milk, which they make into curds, cream, qaimak and fresh cheese, and send it to their friends as a complimentary gift, marking the return of the season. A shepherd has the care of three hundred sheep, and is raid in kind, both in wool and lambs. “ From what has been said, it is evident that the Ihats, as raw ma on for the formation of troops, must be of considerable consequence to the state of which they are the subjects. They are soldiers by nat ure as far as the mere habit of the man goes, but, it must be added, they are difficult of d s dnline owing to their clan-like propensities. Those on the frontier frequent- ly P give rise to feuds and war. One of the principal objects of the war cariied on g by the Persians against Russia was to induce the_ Ihats of B t b, Shaki etc. to return to their allegiance to the Shah.

It has at times been the policy of the Persian Government to split up unruly and dangerous tribes, and to Persian policy towards the Ulats. transport them to distant parts of the empire; thus the inhabitants of Diz-i-Kurd, Deh-i-Kurd, etc., are of Kurdish origin. Mr. Schindler considers that the proportion of souls per family among the nomads is smaller than that of residents in towns and villages. Of the Mussulman population 50’5 per cent, are females and 49‘5 per cent, males. The Lurs of Lur-i-Kuchak are under the jurisdiction of the Governor, resident at Khurramabad. The Lurs of Lur-i-Buzurg are under that of the Governor of ’Arabistan, resident at Burujird, and of that of Isfahan. The Kuhgalu and Mamassani are under the government of Behbehan (Shiraz). The Qashqai are under that of Pars (Shiraz). The most complete account of the Mamassani and Kuhgalu Lurs and of the Qashqai, as well as of the other Iliats of Pars, &amp;c. dwellers in Pars, will be found in the works of Dr. Andrea. All these tribes were reduced to order by Prince Farhad MIrza by a ruthless shedding of blood (since 1877).

JiHRllM or JEIIRUM Town—Lat. 28° 30' N. Long. 53° 27'E. Elev. 3,370'. A town in south-eastern Fars, 63 miles (75 by road) south-west of Darab; 90 miles south-east of Shiraz ; and 72f miles by road east-south-east of Firuzabad. It is the chief town of the Jehrum district. Town and inhabitants. —Jehrum is situated in an extensive plain of the same name under the northern slope of Ivuh-i-Bafreh, a rocky mountain extending east and west. The town is enclosed by walls of great length and in very dilapiated condition (1893), although they were of recent con- Btruction when Abbott visited the town. The w~alls are about 3 miles in circumference, but Abbott says there are more houses outside them than inside. Many of the houses possess turretted towers as places of defence. Wilson estimated the numbers of houses in 1907 at 1,000, with another 3,000 in the outskirts of the town. The number of date-plantations inside the town walls gives it a green appearance from the distance, and also makes the town appear larger than it really is. The town contains two large caravanserais, one inside and in the centre of the town, and one outside the town walls and—according to Abbott—4 smaller ones. Abbott estimated the population at 3,000 families ; Stotherd at 10,000 souls ; Wilson at 4,500 (1907). Among the inhabitants are numerous traders, who receive the tobacco brought here from the surrounding districts and distribute it over the country, far and near. Many of them are wealthy; they usually transact their business in their own houses without resorting to the caravanserais. The postmaster is a native of Tehran. Trade ; Resources ; Supplies ; and Transport—The land round Jehrum is principally irrigated with water drawn from Cultivation. wellg ^ bullocks. The plain is dotted every- Trad0- where with these wells, but running water is scarce in the extreme. Jehrum is the principal mart for tobacco, which isJAH—JAH 417 A la k ne »• t!-' tea nd ;v, e .n in- in iti« r4 ,(i lets, and iji to? a is rom erf jris Ik brought here from the surrounding districts and disposed of to the traders mentioned above. The following rough estimate of the produce of some of the neighbouring districts is given by Abbott:— District. Galbasi mans* Price. Lar Krdn 1-1-10 per man. C” 1-0-0 for Tugum.

In 1892, however, the tobacco export was said to be worth barely 50 tumdns. The other articles of native produce which enter into the trade of the place are dates and rice of Qir and Karzin. The former are worth at Jehrum 9-14 for 25 mans ; the rice, of which there may be 150,000 mans, sells at 1 for 2 mans. Some 30,000 to 40,000 tumdns' worth of English cotton imported from Tehran are disposed of annually at Jehrum. There are thirty dealers in these goods here; groceries, spices, and cotton manu factures are brought from India by Bandar ’Abbas, ’Asalu and Bushire. Grapes, dates (the Shdhdnl dates are renowned), water-melons, pomegra nates, figs, plums, apples, and fruits of the orange and lemon species grow h(re abundantly; the first-named are very excellent and sell at the ridiculously low price of one shahl (a half penny) for 720 misqals, ot about 7 lbs. A considerable quantity of raisins is exported to India. Barley and wheat are not produced in this district in sufficient quantity for consumption, in consequence of scarcity of water. There is a salt mine 34 m les distant to the west. Considerable supplies could be collected here. Cattle, sheep, tobacco, wheat, barley, maize, opium, goats, grain, bhusd dates and vegetables are to be obtained ; firewood is scarce in the immediate vicinity of the town, but is brought 6 miles from Kuh-i-Alburd. There is good camping-ground for a force of any size. The water here requires careful selection, for, though there Water. is a fair supply of good water, there are several wells in which the quality of the water is very bad. The excellent water-supply which is found on the road from Eiruzabad seems to suddenly stop short from Dagh, the last stage before Jehrum _ , onwards. For transport there are numbers of donkeys available here, but very few mules. Stotherd saw a f ew ponies of the right class employed in caravan work. It is very hot and dusty here during the summer months and Climate even in winter no snow remains on the hills around it. For further details of the ,climate of this part, vide this Gazetteer—Fars province, Jehrum to Niriz. 112 1. B 3 Q418 JAH-JAI There is no Persian garrison here. There is no Governor at T hrum ; it is under the Quvvam-ul-Mulk of Shiraz and is Administration. superintended by a Kad-khuda. There is a post office here and a postmaster. There are two posts weekly : one to places in the north and one to Communications. placeg ;n the south The principal routes from Jehrum are— (1) To Firuzabad, 4 stages, 72f miles. The road from Firuzabad presents no great difficulties ; it is passable for all arms, and is very good going through highly cultivated, thickly populated country. Only very moderate supplies can be depended on. The stages are long, but the water-supply good throughout, except in the last stage into J&lt; hrum. All the gradients, however, are so very slight that the road might easily be made a good one. (2) To Darab, 3 stages, 75 miles. (3) ” Niriz, 7 ” 101£ „ (4) ” Lar, 5 ” 93 „ (5) ” Shiraz 5 ” 81 ,, Roads diverge to Chah Talkh, Chah Tiz (for Surian), Firuzabad (2 roads), Fasa, Shiraz direct (2 parallel roads). Native information gives a route from here to Tahiri, 8 stages, 38 farsakhs or, say, 135 miles. This route is very little used in the present day. The importance of Tahiri lies in the fact that vessels can be brought quite close in shore instead of having to lie a long way out, as is generally the case at places on the Gulf; but Tahiri itself, being only a small and poor fishing village, can be depended on for very little of anything. It is doubtful if even donkeys could be procured for transport purposes. It is noteworthy that the only way of penetrating into the interior is by two passes ; so that if these were properly held by an enemy, a force landed here would be con fined to the narrow strip along the sea coast.— {Abbott — Stothcrd, 1893 ; Wilson, 1907.)

It is cultivated by some 300 families of Deh-Nishins of the Silah-Silah division of the Pish-Kuh, and also affords winter pasture to the great tribe of Hasanavand. Mr. Schindler states that in his opinion the site or the ancient city of Shapur Khast must be sought for on the Jaidar plain.

The Karun is here a stream of 100 yards width between cliff banks, 200 yards apart. It has a shelving shingle bed. The village contains 200 houses of Haft Lang Bakhtiari who possess about 100 rifles. It is owned by the Bakhtiari Khans, who seized it 20 years ago from a Kalantar of Shushtar. There is small mud fort and some date-trees. Water is obtained from the river. There is no irrigation. There is dry cultivation of wheat and barley. Livestock comprises horses, mules, donkeys, cattle and sheep. The annual Persian revenue assessment of Jallakan is 280 tiimans.—{Burton, 1903 ; Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) JAM- Lat. 27° 49' 37' ; Long. 52° 24' 10''; Elev. 2,689'. A town of Ears on the road from Bushire to Lar and 144| miles from the former place. It is situated about three miles from the south-east end of a grassy, fertile and well-cultivated valley, dotted with frequent hundr treesrunning south-east and north-west, length about 12 and breadth 8 miles. The portion to the north-west of Jam is a plateau, elevated from 100 to 200 feet above the rest of the valley. On. the south-west side is the rocky range of Kuchur, containing Kuh-i-Puzeh Padri; and on the north-east, near the foot of a rugged range of hills, flows the river Riz, or, as it is here called, Jam, in a few threads of water meandering over a very broad bed covered with small, white pebbles. The north-west end of the valley is bounded by low hills, and that to the south-east by a series of rugged ranees. The population is about 1,500. The majority of the houses are of stone and mud ; there are also numerous mat huts. The streets in many cases are too narrow for the passage of loaded mules. Rates, bailey, wheat and tobacco are plentiful. Butcher observed little fruit, but, to judge from the soil, the abundance of good water and the climate, there seems every reason to suppose that most kinds of fruit and vegetables would flourish here. Mutton and beef am procurable in moder ate quantities , and ae supply might, by breeding and importation, be increased ad libitum. Good and plentiful water is obtainable and the Mndr bushes furnish a considerable supply of fuel. There is very good grazing and cultivation here v The transport appear to be very limited. Four or five horses were noticed, but no mules, donkeys or bullocks. The headman of Jam said that, every harvest, he could send to the port of Tahiri 50,000 Hashimi mans = 65,000 Indian maunds (one Hashim man = 16 Bushire or Tabriz mans). The ground about Jam consists of limestone strata, with gravelly soil super-imposed. Underneath the limestone, at the depth of 12 feet, fresh water runs in subterraneous streams. This water is filled with innumerable very minute fish. The road from Bushire (near Bushire) to Jam is fairly good, and presents no difficulties for pack animals. The seaport for Jam is Tahiri, general direction south by east l east, distant 17 statute miles over hilly ground. The road to this port leads' by the south-west corner of the valley, between Kuh Puzeh Padri and the hills closing the south-east end of the valley. As seen from the summit of Puzeh Padri, a water-course, called Ghaba, flows on its south-west side, and thence south-east by south to the sea, which is plainly visible, between low hills progressively decreasing in height. In this quarter the’ hills are very low, and Butcher understands that by this opening proceeds the road to Tahiri. It has been used from the earliest times, and, although at present traversed only by pack animals, might, he believes, be readily adapted to wheel traffic. Jam can, if required, be easily and economically put in telegraph com munication with all the stations of the Persian Gulf section of the Indo- European Telegraph Department. This might be effected by tapping which ever of the two gulf cables lies nearest to the coast, by a branch cable lead ing in to Tahiri, and thence by land-line to Jam. The nearest main cable lies at a distance from Tahiri of 32 statute miles, and the latter port is, as mentioned above, 17 statute miles from Jam. Such lengths of cable and land-lino are insignificant, and would entail but little” extra expense. With a telegraph station thus joined up at Jam, the country422 JAM—JAN on either side, towards Bushire on the west and Bandar ’Abbas on the east, would be speedily opened out, and the way would be thus paved for a land-line from Bushire to Bandar ’Abbas and thence to Jashk. If this latter line were constructed, the Indian Telegraph system would be con nected through to Constantinople, and the European system, by a con tinuous land-line through Makran, Southern Persia and Turkey in Asia.

JARRAHl (District)— A district in Southern 'Arabistan, lying upon both sides of the JarraM river in the upper two-thirds of its course. Boundaries. —The north-easternmost corner of the district is at the tomb of Shah Nabi, at the foot of some hills to the east of the river Jarrahi; thence the boundary runs west through the southern extremity of Cham Mani village in the Ramuz district to a mound named Rumais, From Rumais it runs south to Qarqar village on the right bank of the river Jarrahi, crosses that river at Dub-ul-Mir on the left bank and continues south for 5 miles ; it then runs south-east to ’ Aquleh, about 8 miles west of Bandar Ma’shur, where it turns to the north-east : finally it passes through a large mound named Radhwan, 8 miles east of Khalafabad, and so returns, following a range of low hills to the point from which it started, Physical feature^. —With the exception of a few miles of broken ground and ravines in the extreme north-east of the district, it consists of open and generally level plains of alluvial soil. Parts of these are fertilized by rainfall, and there is some permanant cultivation along the banks of the Jarrahi. The only trees are a few date trees near villages and a little scrub along the river. People. —The population is sparse : in 1902 it numbered only 3,400 fighting men, and it has further declined since then in consequence of a succession of rainless years. It comprises representatives of the Al Bu Ghubaishu Khanafireh and ’Asa Kireh sections of the Ka’b tribe, of the Bani Khalid and Amur sections of the Bavieh, of the Ma’ammar section of the Zargan tribe and of the Muwayid section of the Hamaid, To these be addedthe Haiyadir tribe—who number 300 fighting men, own some horses, many &gt; donkeys, sheep and cattle, and are engaged in agriculture—also the Maq- atlf, a small section said to belong to the Bani Tamim, and the Rajaibat and Bani Rashid who are described as sections of the Sharifat, possibly identical with the Shurafa of the Hawizeh districts The Rajaibat and Bani Rashid till the ground, but they inhabit tents and possess some 200 camels besides horses, donkeys, sheep and cattle ; their fighting men, together number only about 50. The chief village of the district is Khalafabad and there are about 30other hamlets on the banks of the Jarrahi, some of which are described in the article on that river ; many of them, however, are only occupied in the seasons of sowing and reaping by cultivators from the Fallahieh district. Agriculture and Trade. —Canal irrigation is confined, in the Jarrahi dis trict, to a space of about three square miles in the neighbourhood of Cham- us-Sabi, and the crops, except on the banks of the river, depend entirely on rainfall. Wheat, barley and a little sesame are the staple products of cul tivation. Onions and inferior tobacco are grown in the gardens of villages. The exported produce of th? district finds its way chiefly to the towns of Bandar Ma’shur and Buzieh, from which it procures in return its require ments of piece-goods, spices, tea and sugar. Dates are brought fromhalla- hleh and rice from Ramuz. Communications. —The Jarrahi is naviga,ble by boats up to Khalafabad, and the country on both sides is free from obstacles to movement* Administration .—The Jarrahi district was once a part of the old Daiiraq principality which belonged to the Ka’b Shaikh. In 1865 the Persian Government separated it from Fallahieh and constituted it, together with the districts of Bandar Ma’shur and Hindian into a separate governorship : now it is a district by itself and is under the Shaikh of Muhammarreh who is locally represented by an agent at Khalafabad. Revenue is assessed at one-fourth of gross produce on canal irrigated lands at Cham-us-Sabi only, at one-fifth on river-bank lands, and elsewhere at a cash rate of 44 krans fer fadddn. The revenue was farmed 10 years ago to a Persian official, who paid 3,000 tumdns down and engaged to render a yearly tribute of 6,500 tumdns. Another account says that 14,000 tumdns are payable annually to the Persian Government, while 600 go to the Mustaufi .—(Foreign Department Gazetteer , 1905 ; Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) JARRAHI RIVER— This river is formed within the bounds of Ramuz district by the junction of the Ramuz river with theMarun. Passing a place called Cham ManT, 4 miles below the confluence, the river breaks through a belt of low hills and emerges near Cham-us-Sabi into the Jarrahi district. Thence it runs via Khalafabad to the village of Maqtu’, 11 miles north of Ma’shhr, where it changes direction and runs for about 10 miles west-north-west to Qar- qar, where it leaves the Jarrahi district and enters that of Fallahieh. It then flows practically west for'14 miles, and then turns south-west and runs for 5 miles to Khazineh, 2 miles north of Buzieh town, where it mostly is dissipated into canals* The remaining stream now becomes the Fallahieh- Marid canal. rH2423 JAR—JAR Above Cham-us-Sabi the river is broad and rapid with a breadth of about 80 yards, and the bank, which are of no great height, are covered with tamarisks. For some miles below Cham-us-Sabi the same characteris tics are preserved and the stream is divided by islands Below Khalafabad the Jarrahi runs with a slow current and is 60 to 70 yards broad. From this point onwards its breadth gradually diminishes to about 40 yards. The river is fordable in summer at numerous places, and some fords near Khalafabad are fordable for laden animals during the greater part of the year, except after recent rain. There is a ford, difficult in winter, one mile below Cham-us-SabT, and another unfordable in winter at Rahaneh,8 miles above Maksar. A ballam, which can be used as a ferry boat, is kept at Mak- sar, and there is another at Haddameh. Boats 40 feet long, with a beam of 6 to 8 feet and drawing 2 to 3 feet of water, can ascend the river as far as Khalafabad at all seasons.

A village in the Dizful district of Northern ’Arabistan, situated about 16 miles south-east of Dizful and 22 miles north-west of Shushtar. It is the ordinary halting place for travellers between these two towns. Kahunak stands on_the left bank of the stream of the same name, which is an affluent of the Ab-i-DIz. The bed of the Ab-i-Kahunak, at the’village, is usually a dry or nearly dry stretch of shingle about a mile across! After moderate rain, however, there is a good flow of water in several distinct channels, and heavy rain renders it impassable for short periods The village consists of about 100 mud houses. It is not surrounded by a wall as are most of the villages of the Dizful district. A caravanserai stands about 200 yards north of the village. It is a mud, walled enclosure but some of the interior buildings are of brick and there are a few small lodgings for better class travellers in a bdldkhdneh. This building, along with the right to maintain four shops in the village, is held on lease by a private individual, who pays 50 tumdns yearly to the owner of the caravan serai and 2 tumdns to the Kadkhuda of Kahunak. The only defences of the village are a small mud tower with a timber roof, just outside it on the Dizful side, and a couple of two-storeyed buildings in the town, which shew a few loopholes. 6446 KAH-KAI The inhabitants are Bakhtiaris and a few Dizfulis, and there is one shopkeeper from Shushtar. The fighting strength fluctuates. At best there are but 10 to 12 rifles, and in September 1904, when an attack by Dlrakwand Lur was expected, the place was almost deserted. Kahung.k belongs to the Bakhtiari Khans and to Agha ’AH Mustaufi of Dizful. Rice, Jcunjid, mash, wheat, barley, beans and cotton are cul tivated on the village lands which are irrigated from the Ab-i-Kahunak. A canal runs out of the stream a few hundred yards above the village and beyond Kahunak, reaches a group of hamlets called Gumar, which also it serves. There is a fair supply of water at all seasons of the year, but it is rather brackish. No transport is procurable at Kahunak except about 50 donkeys. Cattle number about 150 sheep and goats about 60. There are four shrines here—the imdmzddeh of Bibi-Qulkhan, close to the caravanserai, a Kadamgdh of Hazrat ’Abbas and another of the Imam- i-Riza, both on the south side of the village and close to it ; and lastly a Kaiamgdh, called Amir Vazir, | of a mile from the village in the direction of Shushtar. These shrines arc visited by the surrounding Arabs as well as by Dizffilis and Shushtaris. The revenue of Kahunak is paid into the Dizful treasury. With that of Gumar, it amounts to 1,000 tumdns per annum for crops, except rice, being assessed, it is said, at the rate of 2 tumdns per plough. Half pro duce fin kind is paid on account of rice cultivation. The annual cash assessment of Kahunak, separately, is now (1907) reported to be 318 tumdns. A flour mill, belonging to the village, which charges customers 1 hr an and 1 Dizfuli man of flour for every 12 Dizfuli man ground, is assessed to revenue at 500 tumdns &amp; year.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1068.)

These merge into one deep channel on passing through a low range of hills, which divides the plains of Kahunak and Ab-i-Bid. A few miles later, it flows past Kahunak, where the road from Shushtar to Dizfui crosses it by a brick bridge, and after a farther course of some 18 miles in a south-westerly direction it flows into the Ab-i-Diz, about 42 miles (by river) south of Dizful.— {Arbuthnot, 1905.)

The fort outside is fairly strong, but inside it is entirely ruined. Apparently it has few rooms fit to live in the half towards the gate ; the other half, which may be better, is occupied by the women. The fort appears to have been built by Muhammad Saqi Khan, Layard’s friend, and to have been restored several times since. There is a well inside the ramparts. It has now six flanking towers of plastered masonry and a square one in which is the gate. The mound on which it stands is 100 feet high, sloping to the south-west and falling steeply to the north-east, whence it can be approached to the foot of the walls, out of view and of fire, through gardens. It would be difficult to take without artillery. The bulk of the village lies to the south-west of the mound, but there are also habitations to the south, north-east, north-west and north. It is the seat of the chief representative of the Chehar Lang Bakhtiari, Khuda KariamKhan (1906), who is of local importance and friendly to the British. To the south-east of the fort and some 500 yards from it, is a garden with pomegranate and larger trees. The surrounding plain is barren and stony. Supplies are limited and water is said to be scarce, although it supports a considerable village and a certain amount of rice cultivation. Water is obtained from a narrow and sluggish stream, which is nearly dry for some months in the year. The number of houses in the village is estimated at 400 (1906) with 4,000 of a population.

N. Long. 51° 28' (approx.) E. Elev. A rocky hill and fortress in the Shhlistan district of Fars, some 70 miles north-west of Shiraz ; on the left bank of the Fehllan river. The hill gets its name from the white colour of its rocks, and from the fact of its being used as a stronghold in times of disturbances. It is an isolated precipitous hill, 4 to b miles in length, 2 miles in breadth, and has a broad base, perhaps 5-| miles in diameter. Near its summit it presents an abrupt rampart, and its crest is said to be accessible by three paths, only known to the Mamas- sanl, though other writers say that there is only one way to the top and that not an easy one. The sides are scarps of perpendicular rock. There is a road cut along the face of the rock, defended by two towers and a gate. At the summit of the rock, which is about 1,000 feet above the plain, is a fine, level plateau about three-fourths of a mile square, the soil fine and with numerous springs of water. It was taken both by Alexandar and Timhr. The only f ortincations are a line of huge stones ranged in regular order round the edges of the precipices. Each of these is wedged beneath by another of smaller dimensions ; when the s.maller one is removed, the large one is hurled in an instant from the top to the bottom, sweeping before it with irresistible force everything that tends to interrupt its course. The hill is a position of some importance as it commands the high road to Shiraz from ’Arabistan and Behbehan. The rock runs from north-west to south-east and is composed of limestone, on all sides very precipitous, but least so towards the west. There is abundance of oak and other trees on its summit, and plenty of water but no habitations. To the north runs the Talagun branch of the Tab river, nearly in a north-west direction. There are four principal entrances to the fort, which face to the north-east, south-east, west and south-west ; these are approached by very difficult and stony paths liable to have masses of rock thrown on them from above. Even in the present state of the neighbouring roads, guns might probably be brought with great labour near enough to the west entrance to cover an attacking party from a lower height close to it called the Shutur Khwab ; at all events a road could be constructed for that purpose, but the capture of the fort in this manner, which must be attended with considerable loss, seems a matter of doubtful importance provided it could be strictly blockaded ; as its surrender, if shut out from the surrounding country, must soon follow from want of supplies. The Fehlian river, on the bank of which it stands, is here 18 yards wide and 3 feet deep, running with a rapid current. Just by the hills it is joined by the Shul stream from the north, the main stream from the east being here called the Tang-i-Khast, from a narrow gorge through which it flows.— (Monteith — DeBode—Kinneir —Jones — Wells — Baring — MacGowan, 1895 Hopkins, 1903.)

They number 6,oGo tents or families and are partly nomad, partly seden - tary. Their garmsir or summer quarters are the mountains to the north west of the Pusht-i-Kuh; their sardsir or winter quarters are the plains of Zuhab and Qasr-i-Shlrin as far as the Turkish frontier. A section of this tribe, some 300 families, inhabit the Sakiz district of Kurdistan, the men are tall, manly, strong, and excellent marksmen, the women too are hand some. Sir H. Rawlinson fancied from the marked Jewish cast of counten ance that they might be descendants of the Samaritan captives who were placed in the Assyrian city of Kalhur Halah, identified with Sar-i-Pd-i- Zuhab, on the main road from Baghdad to Kirmanshah. They are variously reported to be ’AH Illahis and Shi’ahs. J The land occupied by the Kalhur is milMat (or “private property ”) i.e., the proprietary right is vested in a chief of the tribe, and not in the Shah or (except when they have bought their fields for money) in indivi dual members of the tribe. It rests with the chief to distribute the land for cultivation as he pleases. The usual arrangement in case of dbi land is for the raiijat to provide all the labour and seed ; after the corn crop has been threshed, he takes as his own share two-thirds of the gross produce, leaving the remaining third for the mcrtik (or “owner ”). ^ When the land is tlaim the cultivator takes three shares out of the four The cultivator also pays as mdVidt an annual sum in cash, which varies m amount according to his own supposed capabilities and the exiveneip* of rapacity of the malm. The relations of the chief with the Government are of a two-fold character • first, he is Sartip (or Colonel-in-chief) of the military contingent which the tribe has to furnish; secondly, he is Hakim (or Civil Governor) of the Kalhur country, and is responsible for the revenue (mdlldt) due from the landed possessions of the tribe. The appointment of Sartip is made bv the Shah, and that of Hakim by the. Governor of Kirmanshah, consequent ly the two appointments are not always united in the same individual The military force, which the Sartip of the Kalhur is properly bound to furnish for the service of the State, consists of a regiment of foot 800 strong and some cavalry, but in practice he only maintains 100 infantry and a personal cavalry escort some 200 strong. The ruling family of the Kalhurs belong to the ShahbazI clan. In 1892 the chief of the Kalhurs Riza Quh Khan * The chiefs, like all the Kurdish chiefs, are always ready to take remge m Turkish territory, and it is doubtful if the Persian Government could trust them in case of need.

The tribe leave their winter quarters about May, and move to the high ground. They commence to return in October, and by the end of that month ha e all left their summer quarters. They are civil and inoffensive to the accredited European traveller, but whether they are so to the Persian one is doubtful. A considerable number of horses and mules are reared by them, the chief being said to own 400 mares and 250 mules, while a vastly larger amount are dispersed amongst the various branches of the tribe. They own vast flocks of sheep and goats which, at the moderate allowance of 20 to each ten, number not less than 126,000. In their annual migrations donkeys, of which there are great numbers, not less than two or three per cent, are the chief means of transport.— (Shiel — Rawlinson—Curzon — Preece — Vaughan.)

No supplies are available here except dates. It must be considered an important and strategical point on the line of advance from Bushire to 8b,iraz. This would form a good spot for a depot in the event of a force advancing by this road from Bushire. The cavalry and heavier guns might be left here while the infantry were clearing the passes in advance. Forage during the spring is very abundant, all the hills being covered with excellent grass.

The village has about 500 inhabitants, and lies at the foot of the hills on the north-western side of the plain. Its grey houses are flat-roofed and built of stone. It has also a fort, a ruined serai, a telegraph rest-house and bald khdneh, a superior sort of ehdpdr khdneh. Very few supplies are pro curable, but forage is abundant, and fuel is obtainable from the nomads in the vicinity. The water is good and plentiful from a well at summir of pass. The Kutal-i-Kamarij is remarkable for the singular conformation of the long flat-topped hills at its foot, and the extreme badness of the road. Half-way up the road become so narrow that a laden mule strikes its load against the rocks on either hand. It is literally a staircase, ascending 1,200 feet, shut in by overhanging peaks on the left (going to Kazarun), and with a torrent-bed far below on the right.

The chief ford by which the road crosses is almost due south of the town, and runs straight across the river, which is 40 yards broad, with clear, cold water and a swift current. The ford is 2 to 3 feet deep over a bed of gravel and shingle. The forests to the south and south-west contain the bear, leopard, and wild boar. The names of the villages are given by Durand as under :— 1. ’Aliabad 2. Bigh-i-Nau. 3. Bilii. 4. Cham-i-Zaxm. 6. Kahmin. 6. Kaleh-i-Chugheh. 7. Kaleh-i-Chukan. 8. Kamln. 9. Khurreh Vakan. 10.

The valley in 1878 belonged to Haji Nasir- ullah Khan ; and Durand says that it appears he sold Khani Man, Bilu, Bakian and Palangi to the Mushir-uhMulk. Vaughan, however, says in 1891 that the villages numbered 19, apparently exclusive of Khani Man and the Governor of that town (and presumably of the whole district, for he administers Dilkhun) in that year was Haji Khuda Khan.

With the exception of its small dependency, Banak, Kangan is the northern most of the Shibkuh ports on the Persian coast, and the only one of them lying north of the region in which the main maritime range falls directly into the sea. These high hills first strike the coast about 5 miles west of Kangan. Kangan is situated at the eastern end of a large bay, open to the south but fairly wellsheltered from the Shamal, at the opposite end of which, 9 miles to the westward, stands the rival port of Daiyir. Kangan is about 20 miles north-west of the next considerable Shibkuh Port, that of Tahiri and is exactly opposite to Bahrain, from which it is distant about 140 miles. The place, at the present time (1906) partially abandoned, normally consists of some 300 Arabs of mixed tribes ; about two-thirds of the popu lation are Sunnis and the remainder Shi’ahs. The people are fishermen, pearl-divers and sailors owning eight large boats which run to Qatr, Bahrain, Qatif, Basrah and various Persian ports, also a dozen baqdreh of the kind called amileh which are used for fishing ; they also cultivate dates and grain ; there are about 2,000 palms. There is good water in 3 wells, 4 to 5 fathoms deep, and a hot spring resorted to on account of its curative proper ties ; and a fair anchorage, inferior, however, to that of Daiyir, in a Shimdl. A square fort stands in the middle of the town. The number of shops is about 20 ; imports are sugar, tea, rice, and piece-goods ; exports are wheat, barley, sheep, cattle, firewood, charcoal and onions.Kangan, once the site of a Portuguese factory, has always been a bone of contention between the Khan of Dashti and his neighbours in the south. It was fomerly in the possession of the Khan of Gavbandl, who about 1858 put the Katkhuda to death on suspicion of an intrigue to hand the place over to the Khan of Dashti. Thereupon the Khan of Dashti attacked and destroyed Kangan, ravaging the coast and destroying all the date- groves as far as Tahiii. The Persian Government twice appointed a commis sion to report on the occurrence, but on both occasions the Commissioner was bought over by the Khan of Dashti and no result followed. For at least 7 years Kangan remained a heap of ruins, to the material advantage of the neighbouring Dashti port of Daiyir. It is now governed on behalf of the Khan of Dashti who holds it in farm. A post of the Persian Imperial Customs was established here in 1904. Kangan is the port of JamandRiz in the interior, 10 to 20 miles distant northwards .—{Persian Gulf Gazet teer, 1908.)

KlRIAN (1)—Lat. 28° 3' N. Long. 53° 37' E. Elev. A village in the district of Bidshahr, Ears, the governor of which in 1882 was Lutf ’Ali Khan. The village, which once must have contained 2,000 inhabitants, had only three families at the time of Stack’s visit. It is on the road from Lar to Firuzabad . There is a mud fort close to the village, and two others in the plain about a mile to the east. One of the latter is the mud fort (KaLh-i-Gileh) built when Karim Khan was reigning in Shiraz (1780); it is a square earthwork with a side of 120 yards, and had a tower every 13 yards. The other is the “ Fort of the Eire Well,” so called from the discovery of naphtha in a well hard by ; it is a tower fort with a wall on a mound. Forts and well are in ruins now. Karian stands in the middle of three rocky hills, and these also are said to have been fortified. The tradition of the place is that Shah Karan was besieged here by 12,000 Mussalmans when the Arabs first invaded Persia. While they were at their prayers, he sallied out and slew them all without resistance. In the Mussalman camp were 40 virgins, 37 of whom, in answer to their prayer for deliverance, were swallowed up by the earth. The remaining three fled in various directions. The cave which sheltered one is called Ghar Bibi, or “Lady’s Cave” to this day. The second died of exhaustion at a spot where the shrine called Blbl- Darmandeh or •* Tired-out Lady” is, a famous place for childless wives. Hajat, who had conquered Kir, hearing of the catastrophe, came to avenge his brother, but could not take the fort until Shah Karan was betrayed by his wife, who was a second Delilah and who had fallen in love with Hajat. Hajat married and then killed her, as he had no wish to be betrayed. Being inform ed that the way to find Shah Karan’s treasure was to make blood flow down the hill-side, he proceeded to cut the throats of the inhabitants at the top of the hill, and an old woman, when her turn came, revealed the secret, by advising him to get the great store of wine from the vaults and pour that down the hill-side ; the last jar of wine hid the door of the treasure house. Karian was evidently once a flourishing and well-built place. Conical domes of db-ambdrs rise among the ruined houses, testifying to a large water-supply and a large population in former years. The neighbourhood is infestec|ing it up. It then flows through gardens above the town where numerous other springs increase it, volume, and down through the town on to the plain whose south-east border it skirts, until, in the latter part of its course it forces its way through the Zagros by a tremendous gorge in o the plain of Zangavar. Thence it takes the name of Ab-i-Shirvan as it passes in a south-soulh-east direction through the valley of Rudbar, being increased by the Zangavar, Ab-i-Shirvan, and two other streams, all of which come from the west. It flows south-east and joins the Kara Su and Karkheh in Zangavar ; the united stream is called the Kavkheh.—^RawUnson—St. John—Vaughan.) 'I 5,500b (Gerard.) KARIND (2)—Lat. 34 16' 59'; Long; 46° 14' Elev. &gt; 5,350' {Rozario.) ) 5,250' A town in Kirmanshah, 56 miles west of the town of that name and some 170 miles .from Baghdad, on the road between the two places. It is described by Fraser as grotesquely, rather than picturesquely, placed at the mouth of a gorge between two precipitous hills. The houses, though small, are neat and built in terraces on the slope of the gorge, with the naked' and scarped rock rising abruptly above them. Rich gardens extend up the defile and along the base of the mountain, which produce a variety of fruits (including the celebrated stoneless grape known as that of Karind) which ripen during the end of July and August. The willow and. the lofty poplar attain^a considerable size on the margin of a mountain stream that bisects the village, and is afterwards turned off into smaller channels for the supply of the gardens in the plain. Several copious springs issuing from the plain, which is here about 3 miles broad, add their water to numer ous mountain streams and form the sources of the Ab-i-Karind, the north west tributary of the Karkheh river. The temperature is very mild; when Jones visited it !n August the maximum point of the thermometer wns only 85°. A mild east wind prevails throughout the nights, and is followed by a refreshing west wind that lasts during the day. Karind has long been celebrated in Persia for the excellence of its steel work ; the inhabitants however mainly live by agriculture ; a few carpets are made. The gunsmiths at Karind are reputed to be the best workmen in Western Persia. They turn out exceedingly good Martini rifles at about tumdns 20 (Rs. 45) a-piece and will copy anything. There are four gun smiths in the town, and the average ou put of rifles amounts to about 100 per annum. Cartridge cases, however, cannot be made,; they are obtained from Europe or old ones are recapped and filled, home-made powder benm used, which is described as being better than the usual Persian powder. The population may be 3,000 mainly belonging to the ’All Illahi sect; 32 families of Jews. There are several mills in the town, each being able to grind 6,500 lbs. of wheat in 24 hours, and a Persian Government Telegraph Office. The fine caravanserai built by Shah ’Abbas is now in ruin. Supplies : cattle and plough oxen, 3,000 sheep, 500 goats, firewood.

KlB KUNAN or KANUN— A project for diverting a portion of the head-waters of the Kanin river to increase those of the Zindeh Bud. Its original initiation is ascribed to Shah Tahm Asp in the sixteenth century, who began to excavate a tunnel, but is said to have been repelled by the noxious vapours. ’Abbas the Great commenced a cutting on an enormous scale, but was vanquished by the snows and the cold in winter. ’Abbas II tried the experiment of damming the river and mining the rock under the direction of M. Genest, a French engineer. Both schemes were failures, and there the matter has rested till the present time. The main sources of the Zindeh Bud are in the Shur Ab valley. Separating the bed of the Karun from the Shur Ab valley is a long, narrow col called Gal Gushak, a spur of the Kuh-i-Bang. At this point, where the real Karun is augmented by the Sar-i-Chashmeh spring and the head-waters from the Kuh-i-Bang, this work, known as the Kar-Kunan, was commenced. The idea has been described as a grand conception worthy of a mighty monarch ; in reality it is an illustration of the parable of the man who royal ly neglected first to count the cost. Though many thousands of workmen have been working for years, at the most advantageous appraising, but one-twentieth of the necessary work can as yet have been accomplished. And if the same cheap manual labour were to be employed to finish this “ mighty conception,” probably one-fiftieth of the cost only has as yet been defrayed. The levels are favourable, and in European hands the task could be accomplished without difficulty, probably by tunnelling. But as to the expected practical effect of such a contemplated diversion, it is well possible for divided opinions to exist. The Karun can spare the amount of water without hurting an inhabitant on its banks, for it may be safely assumed that such a diversion, if ever accomplished, would not lower the water level at Shushtar by the thousandth part of an inch. On the other hand, it is open to doubt whether, i left to itself in the dry bed of the Zindeh Bud, a drop of the acquired inflow would ever reach Isfahan. — (Sawyer, 1890 — Curzon, 1892.)KARKHEH- One of the most important of the rivers of Western Persia. Its sources and its upper courses, before it takes the name of Karkheh, are described under the various headings Gamasil, Kara Su and Saimarreh in this Gazet teer. From the junction of the Ab-i-Zal with the last named, at a point some 30 miles north-north-west of Dizful, these streams continue their joint course as the Karkheh. This course is almost due south from the po.nt of junction, the river thence skirting the south-eastern slopes of the Kabir Kuh, and winding through the hummocky hills which divide the great mountain ranges of La listen from the plains of ’Arabistan. At 20 miles it receives a brackish affluent on its right bank called the Siagu, and some 8 mi'es lower down and on the same bank, another nameless brackish stream. Twelve miles farther on, or at 40 miles of its course, it enters the plains of ’Arabistan, about 15 miles to the west of the Ab-i Diz. Near its exit from the hills, where it is still a rapid mountain stream of whitish water, it was formerly spanned by a bridge, the remains of which bear the name of Pa i-Pul. Immediately below Pa-i-Pul the river is ford able in summer, but not without difficulty, the fords both he e and a Aivan- i-Karkheh and Susa being shifting and dangerous ; on the left bank name less mounds marking the site of a town, and remains of large canals, adjoin this ford. About 4 miles south-west of Pa-i-Pul, to the right of the river and half a mile from it, are the Sassanian ruins of Aivan-i-Kasra or Asiran- i-Karkheh. At Aivan-i-Karkheh the river flows in several arms divided by low islands. Being little below the level of the adjacen country, it is immediately available for irrigation, and a number of cana 1 s diverge; from its left bank and water the lands of the Sagwand Lurs, and of the tribe; of Karim Khan, west of Dizful. Below Aivan-i-Kasra, 60years ago, the banks were thickly wooded, and the river then appeared to be navigable for vessels of light draught. Leav ing Shush, the ruins of Susa, at 56 miles and some distance from its left bank, and in some places approaching, it is said, within a short distance of the Diz river, the Karkheh pursues its course with numberless windings in a general south-south-east or south by east direc ion o a place at 120 miles and abou 25 miles west of Band-i Qir, where it swings suddenly to-, the south-west and so runs for about 20 miles, passing in this stage between the hil s which form the north-eastern boundary of the Hawizeh district; and the low range which form their prolongation and crosses the Karuna river at Ahwaz. This bend of the Karkheh to the south-westwards appears-? to be a recent feature ; there is reason to think th t the river fell into the Karun a few miles below Ahwaz,. and it is believed that at the present day this condition of affairs could be restored by artificial means. At the end of this reach,, or at say 150 miles.the Karkheh reaches Nahr Hashim in the Hawizeh district, the site formerly of a massive dam by which the whole irrigation of the district was regulated. When this dam was in existence the farther course of the river lay first southwards and then through Hawizeh town ; but since the. dam gave way in 1837, the main stream of the river has taken a north-westerly course from Nahr Hashim, and its waters, dis sipated in streams and marshes, have submerged and ruined the district. At the western extremity of the district the river gradually re-assembles 112 IB. 3 P482 EAR—KAR its waters, and, finally under the name of the Shwaiband augmented by the overflow of some of the Tigris marshes, it enters the Shatt-al-’Arab about 4 miles below Qurneh.

It rises from the western spurs of the Kuh-i-Rang or Jaihun in the heart of the Bakhtiaii . V-&gt;country, about 100 miles due west of Isfahan. Its course is south-easterly for 75 miles. Within the first 20 miles of its course it skirts the flat col of Galgushak, which is a divide between this river and the Zindeh Rud. It is at this spot, which is known as the Kar-Kunan (q.v.) or-- 44 The Workers,” that the earlier Safavi Kings designed to divert the waters of the Karim into the Zindeh Rud, by tunnelling through this col. This project was initiated by Shah Tahm Asp ; and later carried on by ’Abbas the Great, who abandoned the idea of a tunnel for a cutting through the mountains. Both these and other attempts, however, met with failure : though it is evident that modern engineering would accomplish it without difficulty by dams and tunnels. It is further unlikely, looking to the volume of the water in the Karun, and the numerous tributaries by which it is subsequently fed, that the river level would be lowered one inch thereby at Shushtar. Leaving the Galgushak the stream, a few miles farther on, enters the Dirigan valley, in which it is in creased by the waters of the two remarkable springs of Marbarreh and Kulung- chl The former appears, from the foot of the Zardeh Kuh on the right, as a river some 20 feet wide and 3 to 4 feet deep. This stream runs a course of 12 miles before joining the Karun. Continuing, the river enters the Binisgun valley at 40 miles ; and shortly after cuts its way for 3 or 4 miles between the Kuh-i-Kaisari (10,500 feet), on the right and the Kuh-i-Luisi (11,000 feet), on the left, whose respective peaks are not 2 miles apart. This gorge, known as the Tang-i-Kaisari, presents in many parts a sheer wall of 4,000 to 5,000 feet in height. Emerging into the valley below, it receives the waters of two streams, called theDuab, from the right and rising from the Kuh-i-Chari. Two miles below this point it is crossed by a temporary wooden bridge, of a span of 50 feet and a narrow footway 6 feet in breadth, called the Pul-i-’AH-Kuh; although the village of the same name is some 3*| miles farther down stream. Again at Rustami, 6 miles below, it is crossed by a temporary wooden structure, near the remains of a large and ancient stone bridge, and just below which it is fed by the fine spring of 44 Sard Ab.” This spring gushes out of the rocks \ mile away and pours as a foaming torrent straight into the Karun. Five miles lowet it is crossed by a stone and mortar bridge at the village of Kaj (6,010 feet). This is a structure of one pointed arch built of stone and mortar. Four miles beyond, and after a course of some 75 miles, it meets the Ab-i- Behishtabad. This considerable stream, which represents the drainage of the whole of the Chehar Mahali plateau, has several sources. Its three principal sources are the Ab-i-Junaqan, the Ab-i-Jehan-bin and the Ab-i- Shalamzar. All three unite before the stream enters the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash, at the south-west extremity of that plateau. In forcing its way through this remarkable ravine it falls 600 f 3et in a course of 6 miles ; and passes under the bridge at its exit from the gorge just above the village of Behistabad. This structure is also of one pointed arch with a 30-foot span and is of stone and mortar. Two miles farther down it runs into the Karun, of which it is considered to be one of its main sources, both having run an almost equal of course about 75 miles to this point. The united waters now form a river which represents the drainage of 8,000 square miles of country, and which is unfordable at any point beyond this. The river now takes a general southerly course and shortly rushes 3 P 2m KAR—KAR through another deep rift, some 10 miles long, with almost perpendicular walls from 1,000 to 1,500 feet high. About 3 miles above Davazdeh Imam, 0 which is 500 feet above it on the right bank, it is crossed by a well built stone and mortar bridge (5,480 feet) of two arches. For these few miles it runs through a valley with some pasturage, but onl&gt; to tear its way again through a tremendous rift, known as the Tang-i-Ardal. The whole scenery about here is one mass of stupendous surface convulsions. The river zigzags with several acute bends through perpendicular and overhanging scarped walls of rock some 2,000 feet high. With a final bend at right angles, it points due east for a few miles and reaches the hamlet of Du Pulan (5,000 feet), after a total run of 105 miles. It passes out of the narrow, deep and gloomy gorge, under a brick bridge of a single arch, 12 yards span and with bad approaches, and is joined a few hundred yards below this bridge by another considerable affluent. This is the Ab-i-Sabz Kuh, which also rushes down past Naghan, through a great rift of the Tang-i-Siah. This stream is bridged bj' a pile and wicker structure opposite the village of Du Pulan and shortly before it reaches the Karim. The river now assumes a southerly course for a few miles, but later changing to south-west, it strikes through between the Kuh-hSard Ab on the right and the Kuh-i-Sabz Kuh on the left. At 115 miles the walls of the latter overhang it precipitously, and later, the Kuh-i-Buz Man closing in on the right bank, the river enters a defile known as the Tang-i-Agha. Continuing its course between these cliff walls, it makes another acute bend at 135 miles in a west by south-west direction; and passes th^ hamlets of Sunak on the right at 142 miles and Baghak (3,600 feet), at 145 miles on the left. A small stream runs into it near the latter village. At 152 miles it receives the Ab-i-Hilisat from the north-west and 1 mile lower down the Ab-i-Rig from the south-west. Bending now slightly north of west it winds its way through deep valleys, until at 166 miles it receives one of its largest tributaries in the Ab-i-Bazuft, a little below the hamlet of Charka. The Kuh-i-Mazarlm here checks its course and makes it rat her conform to that of its latest feed* r ; the direction now becoming almost due south to 170 miles. From here the river makes a bend again to north of west to 175 miles, where a small stream joins it from the Kuh-i-Shapir on the right. Then flowing south-west past Sir-i-Chal on the left bank, it re ceives a consideable addition from the Ab-i-Lurdigan, at 181 miles, from the south-east. This stream is joined by the Ab-i-Burs shortly before it runs into the Karim, and together they form a good-sized river. At this point the river makes a bend again to a little north of west and with many windings reaches the village of Shapir at 188 miles. Continuing now due north-west, and flanked by the mighty Mangasht range on the left and the lesser ranges of the Kuh-i-Sawla, Qalandaran and Bamstan on the right, it posses two ferries ; the first established a little below the Deh-i-Darkashi at 205 miles and the second 1^ miles lower down. At 209 miles a stream draining the Diz valley, the Ab-i-Kukat, flows into it from the right. From this point the river makes some sharp zigzags to clear the spurs of the Zir-i-Kuh or Pa Kuh on the left; and at 215 miles flows under the Pul-i-Gudar-i-Balutak (2,900 feet) at a bend which here makes its course north-east. For a specification of this bridge, the materials for which Messrs. Lynch Brothers brought out from Europe for the Bakhtiaricaravan route, vide this Gazetteer—Shalu (Pul-i-). After a short stretch, the river makes a bend due north and then gradually changes its direction to ?.orth-west. It winds through deep gorges and ravines between the great Kuh-i-Safid on the right and Kuh-i-Razandan on the left. At 228 miles.it passes the site of an old log br dge, while a few miles farther on it passes through a deep rift below the Kuh-i-Safid. At 23h miles the river may be said to pass beyond any accurate descrip tive knowledge. We know that it flows north-west behind the Kuh-i- Gugird and the Kuh-i-Rashid, bounding the plain of Malamlr on the no th and continuing its direction north by north-west to about 265 miles, and to v ithin a few miles west of the sources of the Ab-i-Bazuft, It is near this that a considerable stream, the Ab-i-Shallar or Shimbar, some 80 feet wide and 10 feet deep in flood time, flows into it. From this point it makes a bend to the south-west, and, after a stretch of some 25 miles in this direction, makes another bend north-west to a point about 15 miles due north of Shushtar. It once again comes within descriptive possibilities, when emerging from the Tang-i-Kaleh-i-Dukhtaran, north east of the plain of Ab-i-Bid. The total length of its course to this point may be taken to be approximately 375 miles. The defile through which the river now passes is some 3 miles long. On the heights above the left bank are the extensive ruins of old forts, known as the Kaleh-i-Dukhtaran. Tradition differs as to the story of these interesting ruins. One explanation given is as follows :—In order to carry out the colossal engineering works on the river which are in evidence at Shushtar, it was necessary to import large armies of workmen from distant places. Having done so it struck the astute originators of these great schemes that their enormous cost might be reduced, as far as the payment for the labour was concerned, to the bare cost of subsistence of the workmen by the provision, not only of all foodstuffs, but also of a liberal supply of the gentler sex for their enjoyment in their periods of leisure. The arrange ment was so contrived that the great portion of the money paid in wages found its way back to the source from which it issued, by the exaction of exerbitant charges on the provisions suppl ed and a heavy toll on the earnings of the ladies. Another version is that when the Lurs descended into the plains to rape the neighbourhood, they carried away their prizes to these strongholds. Not far below its exit from the hills at Kaleh-i-Dukhtaran the Karun passes the village of Gutvand on its right bank. Here there s upon that side a fertile, alluvial plain, sloping down slightly from the west, and opposite to it the fertile plain of ’Aqlli, round which the river flows in a remarkable curve. This plain, which contains ten prosperous villages, is the most luxuriant and valuable land on the banks of the Karun. Every inch of it is under wheat, barley, tobacco, cotton and other cultivation. The plain of ’Aqili, as well as aportion of the plain of Ab-i-Bid on the right bank, is the property of the Shahab-us-Salt meh Ilbegi of the Bakhtiari (1905) . The remainder of the plain of Ab-i-Bid, also very fertile and valuable land, is the property of the Salar Arfa’Bakhtiari Khan. Farther to the west and south-west almost as far as Dizful, extend the properties of the Ilkhani and others of486 KAR-KAR the Bakhtiari Khans. Completing its bend in a north-east direction, the river buckles round the elbow of a range of hills on the right bank and then makes an acute bend almost due south. It shortly after receives the brackish waters of the Shur-Labahri, one of its largest tributaries, which flows into it from the left along the foot of the ridge known as the Kuh- i-Fidalak (1,200 feet). This range on the left and the lower hills on the right bank form a defile through which the river passes, until it emerges into the plain about 3 miles above Shushtar. Some 2J miles beyond this barrier and about 600 yards above Shushtar it divides into two streams, the left branch being called the Ab-i-Gargar. The branch to the right retains its name as the Karun and on the north side of the town forms a broadsheet of water, and then, turning to the south and passing an ancient dam and bridge once known as the Band-i-Kaisar, but now called the Pul-i-Dizful (400 feet), changes its name to the Ab-i- Shatait. The Ab-i-Gargar and Ab-i-Shatait are separately described in this Gazetteer : as also the island enclosed between them, which is called the Mian-Ab. At a point 30 miles south in a direct line from Shushtar, or at 453 miles of the river’s course (reckoning by the Ab-i-Gargar), the two branches re unite with the village of Band-i-QIr situated at the angle of their conflu ence. At the point of junction the Ab-i-Diz {q.v.) from the west also adds its waters to the Karun. There is a ferry established on the Ab-i-Gargar just opposite the village of Band-i-QIr. From here on to Wais on the left bank, at 465 miles, the river is almost straight with a due southerly course. From Wais to Ahwaz (496 miles), on the left bank, its general direction is south-west by south, the river making a number of bends and nearly doubl ing the distance between these places, as compared to that by the land route which is only 14 miles. Immediately above Ahwaz, where it is now about 600 yards wide, the river is divided into two streams by the small island of Umm-an-Nakhl. On re-uniting, it breaks through a ridge of sandstone hills, which here traverses the river’s course at right angles, and in doing so forms a series of rapids. These rapids obstruct some If miles of the river’s course and terminate at the lower end of another small island called Umm-us-Saba’. Just below them the settlement of Bandar Nasiri Nasirleh has sprung up. From Nasirieh the general direction of the river is south by south-west. It makes a series of extraordinary bends as far as the tomb of ’All bin al Husain, which is some 40 miles in a straight line from Nasirieh, though ap proximately at 575 miles of the river’s course. From this point onwards its bends become less frequent and pronounced, eventually reaching the Shatt- al- Arab at a point situated 25 to 30 miles in a direct line to the south-west of ’Ali bin al Husain. At 593 miles it throws off the Salmanieh or Salmaneh canal, now almost dry, from its left bank ; and at 3 miles farther down, op posite the island of Dair, there is another outlet from the left bank, called the Marid-ul-A’ma, which runs inland for about a mile and forms the mouth of the Fallahieh-Marid canal, which is supplied with water by the Jarrahi river. On the south-west bank of this creek, at f of a mile from the entrance, are some heaps marking the site of the old village of Marid. A dry hollow,containing bushes at the end towards the Karun, connects the Marid-ul- A’ma with the Qanaqeh branch of Khur Musa : at one time, no doubt, the Karun discharged a part of its waters by this route to the sea. On the right bank, opposite to the Marid creek, is the site of the old Ka’b settle ment of Sableh. At 607 miles the Bahmanshir channel leaves the Karun on the left bank and follows an independent course to the Persian Gulf. This channel was the main coruse of the Karun in former times {vide this Gazetteer, Bahman shir). Its present detouchment into the Shatt-al-’Arab, 2 miles farther down at 610 miles, is called the Haffar, or canal. It was originally a small canal cut for irr gation purposes, but the river, finding this course more appropri ate, wore down the dam which regulated its out-take of water and eventually burst through in full force, thus forming a new and more important chan nel for its final exit into the estuary. Navigability and character of banks .—From Band-i-Qir to Ahwaz the normal width of Ihe river is about 300 yards and ordinarily offers no ob stacles to navigation, but sand banks and heaps of stones occur, and the depth of the water is sometimes insufficient. The banks vary in height from 10 feet to 30 feet, the land above them being gravelly plains ; towards Ahwaz they are of marl, the brushwood which once clothed them having mostly disappeared. The rapids of Ahwaz, though passable by toAving, are a serious obstacle even to native boats, especially with a very high or very low river. The steamers Assyria and Shushan, however, ascended the rapids by steam successfully in 1842 and 1890 respectively. Bulk is commonly broken at this point, goods being conveyed by a horse tramway from Nasiri to a point a J of a mile north of Ahwaz for re-shipment. The k ngth of the rapids is about 2,000 yards ; they are reckoned to be 5 in number and the real obstacle to navigation is the second one from the top. At this place a reef runs out from the left bank, leaving between its point and the right bank a channel only 100 yards wide, through which the water rushes with a all of 1 in 50 ; this channel is, moreover, broken up by rocky islets into 2 or 3 passages, of which the one adjoining the right bank is the easiest of ascent, but has a width of only 50 yards. Both the reef and the islets carry masonry remains, those of a great irrigation barrage which raised the surface of the water to the level of the surrounding country. This barrage was called Shadurwan and existed in the 10th century A. D. Above the rapids the river is 400 yards broad, between them in places as much as 700 and below them only 200 to 300. Between these points the total loss of level is 1 foot with a high river and 7 or 8 feet with a low one. From Nasirleh to Muham- mareh, a distance of about 120 miles by the river, the Karun has a normal breadth of a £ of a mile and flows through uncultivated plains. The banks are generally low in this part of its course. In winter they are occupied by Arab encampments around which some slight and shifting cultivation is carried on, but in summer, with the exception of the permanant habitations mentioned below, they are deserted. The current varies from 4 to 5 knots in the flood season to 2 knots between August and November; and the difference between low and high river is ordinarily only about 12 to 14 feet. The Karun, however, is liable to more violent and irregular changes of level than the great river of Mesopotamia, and there is a difference of 24 feet488 KAR-KAR between the highest recorded (February 1903) and the lowest (October 1901). When the river is full it carries a brown silt and m its tovyer course runs level with the banks. It is at its lowest from the middle of October to the end of November, while the highest floods occur in March and April. In most parts and at ordinary seasons there is little difficulty for the safe navigation of a vessel of 5 or even 6 feet draught, but in the 20 miles immediately below Ahwaz which is the worst reach for steamers, those of only 3J feet draught sometimes have difficulty in navigating it, when the water is low. There are ferries for crossing the river at Wais, Kut ’Abdullah and Ghazzavieh ; but no bridges below those at Shushtar. The sea tides are felt as far up as Isma’ilieh and lower down cause a rise and fall of 4 to 5 feet; but no salt water ever reaches the Karun. The average slope of the river below the Ahwaz rapids is about 5 nches in the mile. ° The minimum discharge has been calculated at 10,000 cubic feet a second and the flood discharge at 120,000 to 140,000. Date groves begin on the right bank at Qisbeh, 8 miles above Muham- mareh, while both banks for the last few miles carry fine plantations. -Duck, teal, snipe, pelicans and gulls are seen on the river, while the country on its banks holds francolin, hare, wild-boar, and, it is said, some lynx and lion. Sharks travel up stream, when the water is low, to Ahwaz and even Shushtar. j r. t^- - The difference in temperature between the Shatt-al- Arab and the Karun is very remarkable. Lieutenant Selby found the former in the month of August to be 96°, while the latter, not 200 yards distant, was under 80° Districts and villages—Above Band-i-Qir the course of the Karun lies in the Shushtar district ; the river then enters the Ahwaz district which it tiavases. The next and last district on the Karun is that of Muhammareh, which b -gins on the right bank immediately above Sab’eh, and on the left bank just above the ruined tombs at ’A'i bin al Husain.

The name is attributed to the existence formerly of a custom-house at this place. The Shaikh of Muhammareh has an office here to inspect boats pro ceeding up the Karan. It is included in the tract properly called Half r, which extends from Qis- beh to within about a mile of the north-eastern corner of ’Ab'^adan island. According to one account this place was the earliest settlement of the Mu- haisin tribe. about here seems to in clude Umm-ut-Talul, Khum! eh and Nahr Slab. Practically a suburb of Muhammareh. See article Muhammareh town. Hlzan comprises, besides H o z-ul- Mai a keh and Jabirieh, a village called Muhammarat-ul-’Atiqeh, which consists of 15 mud houses of Hasawi market gardeners, and is situated between the end of the Ma’milri canal from the Shatt-al-Arab and the end of another called Nahr Sadeh, which runs out of the Karun beween Muhammareh town and the British Consulate.Steamers and native craft. —It is over sixty years since the immense latent value oi the Karun trade route, as an avenue of expeditious approach to the great cities and centres of grain cultivation in the west of Persia, and as an opening, more especially for British and Anglo-Indian commerce, was first brought prominently before the notice of the British by the united labours and writings of Sir H. Bayard and Lieutenant Selby. But it was not until October 1888, that, by a decree of the Shah, the Karun river as far as Nasiileh was, subject to certain somewhat vexatious conditions, opened 10 mercantile marine of the world. Immediately this' per mission was obtained, Messrs. Lynch Brothers, of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, detached one of their steamers from the latter river for the Karun service ; and have continued to ran a boat at intervals cf a fortnight between Muhammareh and Nasirieh ever since. The beat first employed was the Blosse Lynch, a fine paddle steamer : but she was found to be both too long for the abrupt bends and zigzags cf the river, and of too deep a draught to pass over the shoals in low water. Accordingly she was rep 1 aced by the Shushan, a smaller stem- wheel boat; and subsequently in 1890 by the Malamir, a paddle-wheeler, a good deal larger than the Shushan and somewhat smaller than the Blosse Lynch. ^ The Shushan was then taken up in the spring flood time above the rapids and berthed just above Ahwaz. By a free gift of this boat to the Shah’s Government, Messrs. Lynch Brothers were enabled to override the difficulty of the embargo against the navigation of the waters of the upper Karun by fordgn steamers ; and they run the vessel on behalf of the Persian Government ad the year round as far as Shalaili, a point about 8 miles below Shushtar on the Ab-i-Gargar. The draught cf this steamer is no more than 2 feet 6 inches; and even so, she experiences considerable diffi culty in navigating the Gargar in the dry season. A considerable number of native craft, mostly of the type locally known as mahaihlas, and varying from 5 to 70 tons in burden, ply for trade on the river. They are wedge-shape with a raking prow, flat bottoms and a raised open door for the accommodation cf the crew. The mast, placed somewhat forward, has a list ft rwar'ds and carries one expansive lateen sail. W hen the wind is unfavourable they require to be towed on the journey up stream. This is an extreme ly laborious process, especially when the current of the river runs strong, as the banks in most of its reaches are quite unsuitable for this work. A boat, 90 feet long 20 feet wide, carries 70 tons and draws 7 feet 3 inches. Besides these larger crafts a small boat, ballam, worked by paddles, as well as by towing, is much in evidence, especially in the neighbourhood of Muhammareh. They run from 16 to 20 feet in length and from 3 to 4 feet m breadth. A somewhat heavier and deeper type of the same craft is used for the ferries at the different places, where they exist. At the ferries m the higher stretches of the river, above Shushtar, boats are not used owing to the rush of water. In their place Jcililcs, or rafts on air bladders, are found safer : these rafts will bear some dozen human beings, besides a fair quantity of baggage. The Mu’in-ut-Tuj jar’s steamer, the Nasrat, has recently (1907) arrived on the lower river ; it has been secretly helped by the Haji Rais, and has taken away, up to the present, the bulk of the passenger traffic from the Malamir.498 KAR—KAR There has been plenty of cargo for both boats. The iVasraf appears to be tolerably well run and is on the whole giving satisfaction to the people of the place. Particulars of the Nasrat are as follows :— Stern wheeler.

She moors at a wharf a little below the custom house, at the end of the tram-line. Trade .—The trade of the Karun river is dependent in great degree on the success of the harvest in the North ’Arabistan; as well as the action of the Persian Government in regard to the embargo on the exportation of wheat. Its imposition appears to be exercised with no regard to the prosperity of the inhabitants, but rather to the advantage of the local Government and officials. A good harvest with no embargo on the exportation of grain, although the duty imposed is heavy, causes increased prosperity to the in habitants, and permits of larger dealings in imported goods. Since 1903 the wheat crops have been poor, and trade has merely held its own for the three succeeding years. British piece-goods, which are a great feature among the imports at Muhammareh, have at present no fear from any foreign competition. Of £95,729 total imports into Muhammareh and Karun ports in the year 1904, £85,651 were from the United Kingdom, India and Aden : the country following next being France, with goods valued at £10,294. The exports from the same ports showed a decrease of £10,288 to the United Kingdom, India and Aden, and a net decrease to all countries on average years of £1,681. The freight to London in 1904 ran from Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 per ton, while the freight on goods by river steamer from Muhammareh to Nasirieh was Rs. 10 (Jcrans 40) per ton. Trade on the upper Karun from Ahwaz to Shushtar was interrupted during 1904, owing to the insecurity of the country on the river banks. The caravan trade route from Ahwaz to Isfahan attracted an increasing amount of merchandise during that year. Mule hire between these places for freight averaged krdns 2 • 85, about 12 annas per Shah maund of 13^1bs. On the other hand, the trade route from Dizful to Khurramabad, and thence on to Burujird, has been closed for seve ral years past owing to its insecurity. This road, even in its unimproved state, in better than any other caravan route to the plateau of Persia from the south or south-west. Irrigation and other works .—The great dyke at Ahwaz, the massive remains of which are still existent, is commonly attributed to the Sassanian monarchs. It was designed to hold up the waters of the Karun, which were then diffused by means of ditches and canals through the surrounding country, at that time and for long after renowned for its rich plantations of sugarcane. The ruins of the dams, upon which it is likely that, as at Shushtar, there may have been superimposed a bridge, survive in the shape of big masses of masonry, still held together by an indestructible cement* There yet remains sufficient of these works to show the effect they must have had on the prosperity of the country, as compared to the present day ; when it can only be described as a howling wilderness. Various schemes have been set in motion to revive these irrigation works : the last so late as the year 1905, when a Dutch Engineer, M. van Rogen, was deputed by the Persian Government with this object. Major Morton, R.E., was deputed by the Indian Government to examine and report upon this scheme, which he did, condemning it unreservedly on the grounds of its cost and the impossibility of its ever becoming a paying concern. No further really serious plans have been devised, nor have matters definitely shaped themselves in any way. The same comment applies in regard to schemes put forward for the im provement of the navigation of the river. As noted above, it is at Nasirleh that the principal obstacle is encountered, and it is necessary to break bulk between that place and Ah waz, 2 miles above. Alight horse tramway at present assists in the transfer of cargo between these two points, which can not be other than a most laborious process. To overcome this difficulty the best suggestion is that made in Captain Wells’ report, who visited the spot in 1881 and carefully examined the obstruction, as well as the river above it. In his opinion, to merely open a passage through the rapids, which could be easily effected by blasting, would do more harm than good, owing to the difference in level between the upper and lower Karun. This fall is estimated to be between 8 and 10 feet. His suggestion is that locks should be built, two of which would be required to control the waters properly. It would not be necessary to excavate more than 25 feet at any pait, to obtain a canal even 8 feet deep : and as this canal would run for the most part of its required length (2,350 yards) through the sandstone, the walls of this formation would be of the greatest benefit to the work and materially lower the cost of the undertaking. The political value of this work, as well as the clearing away of the obstacles which are met with in the Ab-i-Gargar and Ab-i-Shatait, and which prevent them from being made full use of, would be very great. It signifies the possibility of bringing troops within 200 miles of some of the most important towns in Persia. From a commercial point of view it would appear to be the only method of successful competition with Russian trade from the north.— {Kinneir — Chesney — Layard—Selby — Raw- linson — Champain — Wells—Ross — Robertson — Thomson — Sawyer — Curzon — Persian Gulf Gazetteer—Arbuthnot, 1905 — Lorimer.)

Livestock are : 75 camels, 80 cattle, 500 sheep and goats.— {Sher Jang, 1902.) KASHGAN RUD— A river in Luristan—formed by what remains of the Alishtar rivers, after they have supplied all the water needed for cultivation, joining at the southern end of Alishtar the river Kaka Riza, the united waters then tak ing the name of the Kashgan Rud. It is stated to rise in two branches on the Kuh-i-Chehil—Na Balighan, some distance north of Khurramabad and in the plain of Kuh Dasht. It runs through the difficult defile of Tang-i- Gav Shumar, the general direction being south through the town of Madian Rud to Pul-i-Dukhtar. Where crossed on the Khurramabad—Deh Bala road 26 miles from the former place (elev. 3,350 feet), it flows south-east through a broad valley, wooded and grassy. The banks are lined with grassy plateaux, the bed broad, of sand and stones, and wooded with tamarisk. The hills, well wooded and grassy, rise gently to the north-east, more abrupt ly above the right bank of the stream. The river has a stream of whitish water with a strong current : the banks are shelving of pebbles and sand ; the bottom is of loose, round stones affording an insecure foothold. The width of water is 40 yards with a maximum depth of 2 feet 6 inches. It is joined by the united streams of Khurramabad, Karun and Tain or Tian. This latter river, according to General Schindler, is formed by the junction of the Rizan and Kipkan rivers in the Chimishk gorge, between Shah-in-shah and Chimishk. Rabino gives the name of this river as Chulv-i-Hul, and says that it is formed by two streams, one from the mahal of Rikan, running west to east and the other running west of Kaleh Chimishk, the two uniting at 100 paces from K leh Chimishk.After receiving the tribute of these confluents, the Kashgan runs south west through the plain of Jaidar and over a number of precipices, form ing a succession of magnificent cataracts as it struggles through the outer rampart of the Zagros into the valley of the Karkheh, some thousand feet below the hills about 1 mile above Pul-i-Govmlshan, after a course of some 100 miles. Just below the gorge, through which it enters the plain of Jaidar, the river spreads out and divides itself into two arms, thus admitting of being forded except during a few months in the spring, when its waters are unusually swollen by the melting of the snows. When Rawlinson visited it in February, the stream, though very rapid, was not more than 3 feet deep. Rawlinson also says that it is crossed 7 miles from the village of Rabat (14 miles from Khurramabad on the road thence to Kirnianshah) at a point where it divides into a number of narrow branches, by Ilidt bridges of woven boughs. Higher up on the direct road from Khurramabad to Kirmanshah, says the same authority, it is crossed by the Pul-i-Taskan, a magnificent Sassanian bridge now in ruins. The Kashgan is also called the Madian Rud ; and it is probable that one or the other name applies to certain distinct parts of its course, which are at present not clearly definable.— {Rawlinson—Burton, September 1897 Rabino, 1905.)

A town and plain in Ears, 70 miles west of Shiraz and 95 miles north of Bushire. “ Routes in Persia,” Section I, Ed. 1898, gives the distance from Bushire by road as 108 miles and from Shiraz as 70 miles. It issituated in a valley, 30 miles long and 7 or 8 broad, bounded on the south east by a lake and fertilised by a number of rivulets of excellent water. On the south side is a very high, precipitous range of red limestone moun tains called the Kuh-i-Mahar. The drainage of the valley flows into the salt lake mentioned above. The town is divided into the upper and lower, and covers a considerable space. The buildings are of stone and mortar, and have an appearance of solidity and neatness which is wanting in mud habitations ; they are also frequently stuccoed. Many of them are forti fied, possessing parapets and loop-holes for musketeers. Excepting in size, the place hardly deserves the name of a town, as it is, more properly speaking, a conjunction of two large villages, and possesses only about a hundred miserable-looking shops. The situation is on the north-west side of a well-cultivated vale on a slight rise. Palms, walnut and orange and lemon trees are nearly the only verdure it possesses. There is nothing of interest t.o be seen in the place, except the antiquities which are to be found on the green hills behind the town. They consist of some traces of an old fort, and an empty cistern which supplied the fort with water. The town suffered severely in the famine of 1879-80. The qandt, on which the water-supply depends, dried up ; many people died and many more had to leave and seek work and food in Bushire and Shiraz. There is an office of the Indo-European Telegraph Company here open for international traffic, as well as a telegraph office of the Persian administration. Population .—The population is variously stated at 4,000 souls and 1,500 to 2,000 families. Stack in 1881 estimated the number of inhabitants of Kazarun at 8,000 ; in 1889 Curzon estimated the population at between 2.000 and 2,500 ; Newcomen in 1905 said the population was 5,000 to 6.000 ; and Gibbon in 1908 said there were 1,200 houses. The total popu lation of the valley is about 20,000 souls. They own 2,000 Martinis* They are quick-tempered and are always fighting each othe 1- . Supplies and Resources .—Excellent opium is produced in the villages around, obtained from the white poppy. The price is about Rs. 7 per lb, The people are proud of their orange garden, but the oranges are either sour or bitter. Great encouragement has recently been given to the cul tivation of the poppy here. The output of the year 1879-80 was estipaated at 1,500 SJidhi mans, or 100 cases. Provisions are abundant here, except in the spring of the year, and the valley abounds in forage and is said to be very healthy, except in the autumn months. Water is supplied principally from water-courses (gnmate). It is noteworthy that Kazarun is the home of most of the muleteers of the Southern Persia telegraph station, and of many muleteers engaged on the Bushire-Shiraz road. Newcomen (1905) reports that fuel is scarce, though other writers have said that charcoal and firewoood can be procured. Warm felts, coarse carpets, hair ropes for draught cattle, pack-saddles for ditto, and an easy shoe for hill-marching form the manufactures of the place. Blacksmiths, farriers, leather-dessers and tent-makers are to be found here and in the vicinity. Timber, called safiddr, which is a white poplar, and also plane and walnut trees, are pro curable. Saltpetre is found in the neighbourhood, and powder might be made here with little labour. Snow is collected in the mountains to the004 KAZ-KAZ north-east of the town, and is brought down for summer use. Numbers of mules and many good horses could be procured from the nomad tribes in the neighbourhood. Kazarun is also famous for a kind of rough shoe of cotton and hide which MacGregor recommended for use in the Indian Army. The district of Kazarun pays a revenue of 25,000 tumans. The place is recommended as a suitable site for the depot of a force advancing against Shiraz fropr the sea-coast. Camel-grazing scarce. Plenty of fruit obtainable. 3.000 men would find enough food. Climate and Diseases .—The climate is warmer than that of Shiraz, but not oppressively so, and the inhabitants boast that it is so fine that fruits of cold and hot climates {sardsn and garmsir) flourish side by side. In the summer months the best accommodation for troop? up to two battalions, would be the Bagh-i-Nazar, J m ; le south-west of the telegraph office. Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a medical report on the part of Persia adjacent to the telegraph line, writes thus of the country between Kunar Takhteh and Kazarun :— “ Kazarun is the principal town of this district. The water-supply is excellent, being brought from the neighbouring hills by an aqueduct. On reaching the plain of Kamarij you at once feel that you are breathing a more bracing atmosphere. This district, which extends to the foot of Kutal-i-Dukhtar, is midway in temperature, produce, and climate between the sea-coast and the table-lands of Persia ; here palms and oranges grow aide by side, and vines are cultivated on the slopes of the neighbouring mountains. “ The climate is less enervating and drier, though in the spring and early summer heavy dews fall : the summer is, however, very trying to Europeans, especially during July and August when hot winds blow every afternoon. For two months during the winter there is occasionally a slight frost at night, and the rainfall there is greater than in most parts of Persia. “ In the Kazarun district the principal diseases are intermittent fever, enlarged spleen, hepatitis, dyspepsia, costiveness, pertussis, small-pox, paralysis, gonorrhoea, syphilis, periostitis, disease of joints, together with thickening of neighbouring bones, necrosis, diseases of the eye, especially ophthalmia and opacities of cornea, cataract, and strumous diseases of children, and a few cases of stone in the bladder. Here one sees fewer blind people, and these are more often the result of small-pox. Until 1876 diphtheria was, I believe, unknown in Persia ; early in that year a severe epidemic broke out in Kazarun causing many deaths ; shortly afterwards it reached Shiraz and quickly travelled north. In July of that year I saw several cases in Tehran ; since that time I have not heard of any cases at Kazarun. A severe epidemic of small-pox occurred in Kazarun in 1883 and was fatal to children, of whom about 200 died. Probably it is never altogether absent.”Monthly average thermometer readings for the station of Kcizarun May 1661 to April 1883. 1881. 1882. 1883. Months.

Administration and cultivation. Colonel Ross in the Persian Gulf Admi nistration Report gives the following memorandum on cultivation in Kaza- run :— “ Cultivation in Kazarun is undertaken as follow's Shitvi or autumn sowings. “ ] anc i [ n Kazarun is private property. If the cultivation be under taken bv the landowner himself, he has to provide seed for an area of one ta y gau* of cultivation, viz., 1,000 lbs. wheat and 1,000 lbs. barley, and pay about 14 krdns for the labour of ploughing and sowing. He pays in kind, 11 per cent, of the vield of his harvest to Government and 20 per cent, to the reapers, who have to undertake all duties appertaining to the collection of the harvest and the carriage into the stores of the landlord. The landowner also pays 2 to 4 per cent, for threshing or treading the corn. “ Other than a landowner undertaking a cultivation has to pay to the landowner 9 per cent, in kind from the outturn of his harvest as rent for one gdu of ground, and 14 per cent, to Government as tax. His other expenses are the same as above. “ The agriculturists of Kazarun are of two classes, viz., the ra iyat-i- vddishdh and the non-raliyat, the former being always looked down upon by all classes and subjected by Government to more oppression than the others. The ra'iyat cultivator thus not only pays more taxes to Govern ment, but has to pay his taxes in cash, instead of in kind, and at 30 per cent. 1121. B. 3 S606 KAZ—KAZ above market-value. He is also obliged to give a certain quantity of straw to Government officials whenever required. « a ra’lyat, when a landowner and cultivating his own grounds, has to pay I51 p e r cent.’ on his harvest in cash at the above enhanced valuation. “ A poor rcTiyat pays about 60 brans annually in cash to Government. There is another class of ra^iyats^ who are obliged to buy at 30 per cent, above market-value a certain portion of the produce received by Govern ment as taxes. A wealthy ra’iyat is entirely at the mercy of the authorities, a sum of about 1,000 brans being annually levied from him. “ The value of one gdu of land is from 100 brans to 600 brans according to the locality. “To start a cultivation an expense of about 15 tumdns is necessary, viz :— One ox valuing .. Seeds „ •• Labour about Straw and cotton seeds Sundries 50 brans. 60 14 „ 16 „ 10 “ One donkey is also maintained by a ra’iyat when undertaking 4 or more gdus of cultivation. “ About 2,000 lbs. of grain are sufficient for cultivating one gdu of ground at Kazarun. « i n the case of saifi cultivation, no distinction is made by Government between a ra’iyat and non-ru iyat. ®‘ Saifi, or spring, sowings are always undertaken by proprietors of water and agriculturists conjointly, the proprietor providing the water and the ground, and the agriculturists finding the seed, labour, implements, etc. “ Should the water-owner, however, not be a landowner as well, any other landowner would be but too glad to permit his lands to be used for saifi cultivation gratis, inasmuch as the soil becomes enriched by manuring ■which the saifi cultivation necessitates. « time taken up for saifi sowings is about 7 months, the following being cultivated : tobacco, water-melon, musk-melon, vegetables, cotton, sesame seeds, lentils, etc., rice, gram. “ A tax of 20 per cent, ad valorem on the outturn is levied by Govern ment, three-fifths of which is payable by the proprietor of the water and two-fifths by the cultivator, and the balance is equally divided between the proprietor and cultivator. “ £i ce an d gram, however, form an exception, and are cultivated under the following conditions :— * ! • . ji qhe agriculturist recoups himself for the quantity of seed supplied by him after harvest. He then goes equal shares with the water-owner, who alone pays Government taxes as follows : if a ra’iyat, he pays three-fifths of his shares to Government; if a non-ra’iyat, he pays only half, the agri culturist paying no tax on his share. . “ In all cases the Government share of the produce is to be carried to Government stores at the cultivator’s expense.' The approximate value of the produce on the spot is— Wheat at 40 to 60 cents per Kazarun maund. Barley at 25 to 30 ,, 9&gt; 99 Gram at 50 to 80 „ „ 99 99 Sesame at 70 to 100 „ „ 99 99 Maithi at 15 to 20 „ „ 99 99 Dhall at 15 to 200 „ „ 99 99 Cotton at 2| to 3 krdns „ 99 99 Rice at 50 to cents „ 99 99 “ The expenses of a ra’lyat cultivator in Kazarun, supposed to have one wife and two children, are 10 tumans per annum. “ The yield of wheat and barley is from ten to twelve-fold in a good year, and three to four in a bad one. “ Rice in a bad year yields twenty-fold and in a very good year sixty fold ; cotton five-fold in a bad year and ten-fold in a good year. “ Irrigation in Kazarun is generally conducted by means of qanats, and the water thereof should in all cases be allowed free passage across grounds, even though not belonging to the proprietor of the qandts. “ SI oul 1 the propriety r of a qandt not wi£h to undertake any saifl cultiva tion, he would still be made liable by Government to such taxes as may be due by the cultivation. “ The land in Kazarun is sown every alternate year. The portions remaining fallow are ploughed. “ No taxes whatever are levied by Government on gardens at Kazarun. “ In the cultivation of the poppy at Kazarun, the proprietor provides the land, seed and expenses of sowing ; the cultivation is then made over to the ra’lyat, who undertakes all the labour necessary for the tending of the crop till the season of collection, when the proprietor pays for the labour of incision, say one krdn per man per day. The outturn is then equally divided between the landowner and ra’lyats. No taxes are levied by Gov ernment on the cultivation of opium at Kazarun.” (Kinneir — Monteith — Clerk — Abbott — St. John — Felly — Jones — Foss — Odling — Curzon, 1889 — Neivcomen, 1905 — Gibbon, 1908.)

Its principal source is said to be a large spring gushing out of the side of the moutain : also that from the opposite side of the mountain a similar spring flows north of the Gamasib valley; on the mountain ridge is a deep hole or fissure down which the late Shah Nasr-ud-Din is said to have ordered a load of bhusa to be cast, with the result that half emerged from either spring. (The above legend may be taken for what it is worth.) It is recruited by many springs and streams in the Alishtar plain, and crosses the Khurramabad road in three branches which unite to the south of the road ; it flows through the wooded gorge of Jirian, where it is swelled also by the Kakuria river. Where crossed by the Khurramabad road, the principal channel is 25 yards by 2 feet greatest depth. The bottom and banks are pebbly and firm ; the latter require ramping for the passage of artillery. The other branches are of inferior size, being mere streams. The river is said to flow ultimately into the Kashgan, west of the Chagani plain. The Khaman is the Ab-i-Alishtar mentioned by Rawlinson.— {Burton, 1897.) KHAMlR— Lat. 26° 56'40'; Long. 55° 40'20'; Elev. A large village situated on the coast of the Bastak district of Persia, about 12 miles west-north-west of Laft on Qishm island; the mountains called Kuh-i-Khamir run east and west immediately on the north side. Khamir is approached within half a mile by a creek, leading out of the Masakeh branch of Clarence Strait, which is navigable for native boats of 20 to 30 tons’ burden. Sweet water is contained in 17 large reservoirs and brackish water in a dozen wells. Hills called Kuh-i-Dumdumdeh, one mile to the north-west, yield lime ; and 3 miles to westward, in a spur of the higher mountains which is called Kuh Ma’dan, are deposits of sulphur in con junction with gypsum and a hot, sulphurous spring. The spring is called Ab Bad and rises in a masonry tank. On the east side of the place are date-plantations, and in this direction, at 3 miles from the village, is a well in excellent repair, which was built by Saiyid Sultan of Masqat during an ’Omani occupation. This rampart512 KHA—KHA is known as Sidar. The only other defence is a fort with a high square tower, also in perfect preservation, and built in the same time and circumstances. There are 2 or 3 shrines of merely local importance, and a fine mosque in which free instruction is given to the young. Khamir contains about 350 houses, and the total population may be 1,800 souls. The people are mostly Sunnis and belong to various Arab tribes : they are chiefly engaged in navigation, fishing, date-growing, wood cutting and lime-burning, and own about 50 camels, 20 donkeys and 200 cattle, sheep and goats. Their diet is of fish, dates and coarse barley bread, the commonest and most esteemed fish being a large sort of mullet. The shipping of Khamir consists of 4 ghunchehs and 22 baqdrehs, some of which run as far as Basrah and even to Indian ports. Exports are fish, lime in large quantities, mill-stones and a little sulphur, but the trade in sulphur has ceased to be remunerative under the expensive method employed , firewood is also sent to the towns of Trucial ’Oman and to Bahrain. Khamir belongs properly to the Bastak district, but it is under the poli tical supervision^ of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and the local admin istration is carried on by a Kalantar appointed the Mu’in-ut-Tujjar of Tehran, wdio is revenue-lessee of Khamir and its dependencies.

The latter river is some 5 miles dis- 3 T 2616 KHA-KHA tant, and is crossed by a stone bridge. 2,000 mules would find bhusa and barley here daily. 500 mules on an average are said to hah here every day. Firewood is plentiful and the water of the stream is excellent. There are two caravanserais here ; one in a white quadrilateral built about 1860 by the Mushir-ul-Mulk, Yazir of Fars. Felly thinks this the most suitable spot between Bushire and Shiraz for the cantonment of European troops, as it is some 100 feet higher than Shiraz and the situation is open and well- watered. The small plain on which it is situated is mostly cultivated and enclosed on every side by low hills. From 5,000 to 8,000 men might easily ' encamp on the plain and along the banks of the river, the bed of which is broad and full of jungle. Taylor mentions that in May there was ice at this place.

A large village in the Chehar Mahal district of the Bakhtiari country, situ ated on the right bank of the Jehan-bin river and at the south-east end of the Jehan-bin mountain. It is the fourth stage from Isfahan (71 miles) on the Bakhtiari caravan road. It is a prosperous village of about 150 houses with considerable cultivation surrounding it, and a population of some 700 souls. It is the residence of Nazir Khan, the Saram-ul-Mulk, joint governor of the Chehar Mahal. The river, a sluggish and muddy stream, lined with widows, is crossed at the southern extremity of the village by a bridge of brick on stone buttresses. The dimensions of the bridge are: 10 pointed arches of 7J- foot span each, roadway 11| feet broad between low parapets, length of the bridge 50 yards, with made approaches on either side for 120 vards. The bridge is strongly built, but the approaches are in bad repair. It can be crossed by carriages. There are weeks in winter of flood, 12 feet above the lowest autumn level. The river is then a deep and dangerous torrent and the bridge unapproachable. The river valley is of deep alluvial soil and well cultivated. There is one mill. The banks of the river near the village are thickly lined with willows and some poplars. The stream is deep and muddy and fordable only just below the bridge. The banks are deep cut and unsound. There are large flocks of sheep and cattle. Wheat, barley and much poppy are culti vated, and the opium manufactured is valued at a higher rate than that ofIsfahan. Supplies of all kinds are obtainable in plenty and water from the river is abundant. The village belongs to the Cha’b-us-Saltaneh. 48,000 lbs. of grain are sown yearly. Taxes 9,000 krdns. From Kharaji it is possible to drive to Junaqan, Shalarmzar, Chigha- khur, Gishnagan and Isfahan. —(Burton, 1903.—Report of a Journey through the Bahhtidrl country to Shushtar —Arbuthnot, 1905 — Lorimer, 1906.) KHARAJI (TANG-I-)— Elev. 6,500/ A defile in the Chehar Mahal district of the Bakhtiari country, between the Jehan-bin (on the west) and Ahangari mountains (on the east). It com mences 1 mile south of Shamsabad and extends as far as Kharaji, 4 miles, where it opens out on reaching the valley, striking westwards towards Junaqan.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.) KHARAK* (Island)—Lat. 29° 15'2' ; Long. 50' 18'50' ; Elev. (highrst point) 284'. A considerable island in the Persian Gulf ; its south-eastern point is 34 miles west-north-west of Bushire town, and 2J miles north of it begins the smaller island of Khargu. Kharak is over 4 miles in length from north to south, and its average breadth is about 2 miles. The greater part of the island consists of almost barren, table-topped hills, highest in the middle and at the south end where they exceed 250 feet; northwards they decrease in elevation and terminate in cliffs only 20 to 30 feet high. The hills generally consist of a bed of some soft stone overlain by a thin stratum of nearly horizontal calcareous breccia; this upper stratum, whjre the supporting ma f er:al h's been eroded by weather, has collapsed m slabs and masses which convey a singular impression of ruin and desolation. The rocky portion rises abruptly from the sea, and its summit is a table-land which has, on the greater part of its surface, a thin, loamy soil cultivated in the rainy season. The sides of the ridges presented to the sea are broken in upon by several deep and broad fissures, extending in upon the table-land upwards of 300 to 400 yards, in whose hollows masses of stone are deposited as if they had fallen there on the formation of the rents. The rock is composed of coralline sandstone and limestone, also plentifully mixed with fossil tulipora with an appearance of horizontal stratificates, but most commonly present only in huge, tabular masses superimposed in a loose, sandy basis, abounding with particles of limestone disintegrated and mica, and occasional ly assuming a stratified formation with the state of different colours. Lime stone with an earthy appearance, resembling chalk, and detached pieces of gypsum now and then occur, but no other geognostic formations are found. In the limestone numerous oyster, cockle, lamprey and a variety of smaller shells are obtained—fossils co-eval with the island’s formation, which is aqueous; and has by some convulsion of nature been raised from the bottom of the sea, at a period later than the primary formation of the con tinent. The table-land of the island is occasionally intersected by low ravines, and towards its north boundary it becomes irregular and sloping, smaller mounds leading gradually down to the sandy plain. The soil formed by the i * ' *• - j -* Lorimer spells it Kharag. • - *518 KHA-KHA disintegrated rock and the sand is tolerable, and might be cultivated if the slope was sufficiently extensive and regular. As it is, many of the ravines are gardens in which are fruit trees and vegetables, while the clefts of the rock are planted and enclosed by circular stone walls, which cause many portions of the rock to look as if covered with ruins. The only low ground is a plain, about 1 square mile in extent,, which forms a protuberance on the north-east side of the island, carrying at its extremity the only village on the island and the remains of a Dutch fort. The low part of the island possesses a sandy soil, mixed with particles of disintegrated rock, and capable, when irrigated, of producing crops. About 100 acres are thus employed by the inhabitants, and during the cold season upwards of 500 are cultivated ; when the rains fall, the soil, though meagre, is capable of great improvement. The beach is of small breadth and rises somewhat abruptly from th^ sea, whose bottom is covered with coral rocks. Its sand is^ firm and inter mixed with calcareous particles, formed by constant attrition into a variety of shapes, and dead shells without pebbles either calcareous or quaitzy. The botanical productions of Kharak are the date tree, banyan (Ficus Indica), willow (Acacia Arabica), /memobush, cotton olant, tamarisk, y^asor, etc., some of the common fruits of Persia, and occasionally on the rock a few aromatic shrubs. _ The island is surrounded by a reef about | a mile broad : the best anchorages and landings are off the village, but they are expesed, and the holding -ground is rocky and indifisrent. In the interior of the island are some caves which are possibly pre historic places of sepulture. They were originally divided into recesses by three partitions of living rock, which were grooved for the reception of four tiers of shelves, but they are now used as cattle pens, and the old work is much defaced. A Muhammadan shrine of Mir Muhammad, also in the interior, appears to have been in existence for more than 600 years and is still a place of pilgrimage. Climate.—i'he climate of Kharak has always been deemed very salu brious. It is like that of Bahrain, but is cooler in summer. The atmos phere is less moist than that of Bushire. The maximum range of the thermometer in the hot season is seldom above 95° in tents and by the u^e of tatties it can be kept down to 75°. Population, supplies and resources .— The village consists of 120 houses and the inhabitants are degenerate Arabs, talking a mixture of Persian and Arabic, who describe themselves as originally from the island of Qais, from Kalch GulabI and from Hajari: they are all Sunni Muhammadans ex cept those from Kaleh GulabI, who are Shi’ahs and compose about |th of the population. In character the Kharakis are quiet and unwarlike, but they possess a few Martini rifles. The people are mostly pearl-divers and pilots,, but a little agriculture is carried on. There are 1,500 date trees and some wheat and barley are grown. Irrigation is partly from springs, of which there are four large and three small, and some oldqandt.s exist; there are also wells of good water close to the beach, and on these the drinking supply prin cipally depends. The inhabitants possess 50 donkeys, 50 cattle and about 500 sheep and some goats. Provisions, however, are mostly imported from Bushire. Turtles have been caught on the beach, and fish areKHAr—KHA 519 tb bes Ub sesses when F the when mint, } sea, inter- variety laitzy, [Fim mm, rock a best ndtb ily pie- recesses )tion oi the old ad, also 10 years y sain- atmos- by the uses and an and )f Qais, dans ex- thofthe but they d pilots, ndsome ch there Iso wells dyprin- d about mported fish are plentiful. Tliere are a few wild gazelle in the hills of the island. The wood on the island is sufficient to afford a supply of fuel which is therefore imported. Pearl banks occur between Kharak and Khargu, and also on the west side of Kharak to a considerable distance from the shor 3. The earnings of the people as pilots are considerable ; they are employ ed by steamers from the United Kingdom proceeding to Basrah, and Rs. 140 is paid as pilotage for the voyage and return voyage. The people of Kharak also go to the Arabian coast for pearl-diving and since 1901 pearling operations have been prosecuted with success on the reef of the island itself. The number of divers on the Kharak reef con tinued increasing until 1903, in which year Kharak pearls to the value of Rs. 12,500 were sold to Bahrain merchants. In 1904, however, the value of the take declined to half of what it was in the previous year. The Kharak pearls are said to excel those from the banks about Bahrain in colour and lustre. Hiitory .—The island of Kharak was occupied about 1748 by a detach ment of Dutch from Batavia under Baron Kniphausen. They came in two ships, and found no difficulty in taking possession of the island, where they instantly erected a small fortification ; in consequence the island rose rapidly in importance. The, local position was peculiarly favourable tocomro 3rce, and it possessed great ad vantages in the abundance and excellence of its fresh water and the salubrity of its climate. Its population, which amounted formerly to a hundred poor fishermen and pilots, increased within the 11 years that the Dutch held it to upwards of 12,000 souls. On the death of Baron Kniphausen his successor’s measures were not equally good and the place declined, till the Dutch, being surprised by the pirate Mir Mahanna, were driven out of the island in 1765. It is related that the stratagem by which it fell on this occasion was the employment by the corsairs of a ship containing poultry, whose cackling aroused no alarm in the minds of the garrison, who were always dependent on supplies from outside. In 1767 it appears to have been in the possession of the Ka’b Chief, Shaikh Sulaiman, and was unsuccessfully attack ed by a British naval expedition of 4 vessels seeking to take vengeance on the Shaikh for the seizure of some British vessels trading in the Gulf. The island has twice nominally passed into the hands of the French ; once it was ceded by Karim Khan Zand, but the suppression of the French East India Company followed and the treaty lapsed. Again during the short burst of Napoleonic ascendency in 1807-08 it was surrendered, or about to be surrendered, to the French ; but with the expulsion of the French Embassy from Persia in 1809 this second cession shared the fate of its predecessors. Sir John Malcolm was then instructed to occupy the island in defence of British interests in the Gulf, but this design was not executed. On the advance of Muhammad Shah against Herat in 1837 an Anglo- Indian force was despatched to the Persian Gulf and Kharak was occupied. The detachment first sent to Kharak consisted of 500 men of the 15th, 21st and 24th Bombay Native Infantry and 30 native artillerymen with one officer and two 6-pounder guns, and arrived in June 1838. Afterwards four companies of the Bombay European regiment, two 6-pounders, an 8-inch520 KHA—KHA mortar, and 24 European artillerymen arrived on _22nd September to reinforce them. The Persians retired from Herat* after igominious failure in September 1838; but owing to the shifty character of their diplomacy the island was not evacuated until March 1842. In defiance of the agreement of January 1853, a Persian army again marched against Herat in March 1856 ; war was declared between Great Britain and Persia and troops were landed again upon Kh&amp;rak in December 1856. ^ Military operations ensued at Borazjun and Muhammareh ; but hostilities ceased with the treaty of Paris, March 1857, and Kharak was evacuated, and has since remained in Persian hands. .. __ 1 Administration. —The island is subject to the Khan of the Haiat Baud district, who is represented on the spot by his kaid or deputy, at present (1905) his own cousin Mirza Husain Khan. Taxation appears to be heavy. It is reported that a poll-tax of 2 tumdns yearly is levied by the Khan on every male adult, besides which he takes the greater part of the pilotage fees and £th of the pearls obtained by divers. The Persian Imperial Customs have recently emulated his example in making the most of the island by posting an official of the department on it. No import duties are at present collected, but exports are taxed in the same manner as else where.

The produce of the country not required for home consumption is either consumed by passing caravans or is exported to Kazarun or Bushire. The imports are piece-goods, sugar and coffee for home use. The revenue, amounting to 7,000 fumcms, is levied in the lump. The safety of the road traffic is provided for by the chief of the district, who maintains 50 irregular footmen for that purpose. The chief is respon sible for all goods lost or plundered from caravans within his district, and charges a sort of transit due of 25 cents per Tcrdn on every load of piece-goods, and 12£ cents on every load of miscellaneous merchandise. Colonel Belly is of opinion that English troops could not summer intents or huts at Khisht without suffering. He passed two days in the serai during July and two days in the early part of September; during both periods a fiercely hot wind blew all day. In July the thermometer was at 96° in the early morning and about 110° in the heat of the day.

The principal town of the Dashti district on the Persian coast of Ears ; it is situated at an elevation of 465 feet, nearly 20 miles from the sea, at the foot of the great maritime range, and is distant 40 miles south east from Bushire .own and 17 miles south-south-east of Ahram, he capital of he adjoining Tangistan district. The present town is adjoined by traces of an older one, which was destroyed by the Persian Governor of Shiraz at vKe beginning of the 19th century. The place, which has doubled in size during the last 40 years consists of about 350 houses, of which one-third are mat huts and the remainder of mud and tone. The population numbers about 1,800 souls. On the outskirts of the town is a substantial stone fo.t, the residence of the Khan of Dashti, which int ernally, in 1865, was comfortable and elegantly furnished. There are water-mills driven by a small stream from the high hills behind the town, and water for irrigation is brought from the same qua. ter in open chan nels. The water is good and grazing excellent. Barley and wheat are plenti ful, mutton and beef are procurable, though not in large quantities. Routes from Bushire town, Kaki and the sea-coast meet at Khu muj. Six miles north east of the town is the lo ty peak Kuh-i-Khurmuj winch forms a good landmark.

One of the five towns forming the town of Mahriz {q. v.).—{Vaughan, 1890.) KHUR MUSA (2)— A remarkable inlet of the sea, which leaves the Persian Gulf at its northern extremity to the east of the Shatt-al-’Arab, and affords easy access to Buzieh and Ma’shur, the port respectively of the Fallahleh and Jarrah districts of Southern ’Arabistan. Course and main features. —The channel of the Khur Musa begins in the sea at a distance from the land, and the position of the entrance may be taken as approximately 29° 55' north and 49° 3' east, or about 30 miles east of the bar of the Shatt-al-’Arab. For the first 31 miles within the entrance the Khur Musa is nearly straight and runs north-north-west; in the course of the next 5 miles, the channel gradually bends round to the east; and for the remaining 7 miles, to a point where it divides into branches running to Buzieh and Ma’shur, its direction is slightly to the north of east. Near the entrance the banks of the channel are not visible on either side, being covered even at low water, but on the east side from 5 miles within the entrance up to 23 miles, there are patches o x sand and mud which are dry at low wateu, On the opposite side from 14 miles and upwards banks of mud with rocky patches are exposed at half tide. Navigation. —The entrance of Khur Musa is crossed by a bar which car ries only 3 fathoms at low spring tides, but is practicable for large vessels at high water, the spring rise being 10 feet. The bottom is of mud and could be easily dredged if necessary. Inside the bar the depth steadily increases, and at a little over 11 miles there is no bottom at 9 fathoms, a condition which is maintained the whole way to the head of the main Khur. The whole of the Khur Musa proper is navigable for large vessels, and a branch of it called the Khur Qanaqeh, which branches off west at 29 miles, is navigable for a distance of 7 miles. The only difficulty arises from the invisibility of the edges of the channel except at low water. Naval advantages. —The principal anchorages are completely protected from all winds, and could be easily defended against attack from the open sea. Fresh water could be easily brought from the Jarrahi river which is not far distant, and the climate is probably less trying than in some other parts of the Persian GuP. On the other side it is not certain that the navigable portions of the channel could be made approachable, without great expense, from the landward side ; the chief natural anchorage might require adaptation in order to form good harbours ; and the bar at the entrance would require dredging to admit ships in all states of the tide. — {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) 3X2khu-khu 532 Long.

The capital town of Luristan and the seat of the Governor of Luristan. It is situated on the Kashgan river at the foot of a rocky hill crowned by a fort. The site of this town has been occupied from very ancient times. Chaldeam cylinders, medals, etc., are found constantly. South of the town is a fine plain with several important villages, near which are several artificial mounds which would probably repay excavation. DeMorgan thinks these mounds probably represent the Khaidalu of the Assyrian texts, where the Elamite King took refuge after the capture of Madaktu. Khurramabad now lies on the right bank of the river, but the old town is situated on the left. The most notable ruins of old Khurramabad are a 60- W high circular, brick tower, with a Cufic inscription round the top, the foundations of the walls of the building (probably a rmsjid) in which the tower stood, part of a large aqueduct with a high stone wall, and many walls of smaller buidings. A bridge, of which ten arches are still standing, led Bomewhat south of present town from the right bank of the river to the old town on the left. It was part of the old road, called the Jaidar road, lead- ins to the Karkheh valley. The bridge leading to the present town is a mod ern construction built by ’All Mardan Khan, Governor of Luristan about the beginning of the 9th century. It is of masonry and solidly constructed^ with pointed arches, a roadway of 18 feet broad and a total length of 300 vards The Ever is crossed by another bridge of two arches, 1^ miles from the town. On the road side, there is a curious, nearly square monolith, about 9 feet high by 74 feet by 6 feet, completely covered with Cufic inscriptions. It is said to rest on a truncated pyramid, 8 feet high. The natives, of course, savit covers a valuable treasure. The Muzaffar-ul-Mulk has caused a large portion of the Cufic inscription to be obliterated on one of the faces, and has replaced it by an inscription in naksh setting forth how he, under the Zill-us-Sultan, was Governor of Luristan. The Cufic inscription on the south face does not seem to have been ever translated. When the Arabs overran Persia, Khurramabad became a point of great strategical importance. It was from here that their religious propaganda spread over Luristan. They constructed two roads through the town, the first leading north to Burfijird and south to Dizful, ®® co . n ^ to , Hu ^ and thence to Kirmanshah. From somewhere about 1100 A.U. to low A.D. it was the capital of the powerful Atabegs of Luristan, who govern ed this part of Persia.Khurramabad is situated on the road between Tehran and Dizful, in a narrow valley through which flows the Kashgan river. A range of rocky hills, stretching across the plain in the usual direction of north-west and south-east, has been suddenly broken off for the spac? of about f of a mile to admit the passage of the Kashgan river, leaving in the centre of the open space a solitary rock nearly 1,000 yards in circumference. The rock is very steep and near its summit is a copious spring. On the summit the Arabs built a fort, which was utilised and enlarged by the Persians. Up to a few years ago it was kept in repair, but it is now in ruins. There is a summer house belonging to the Governor at the foot of the walls, and a large reservoir and a garden of some extent. The modern town lies below the fort on its south-west side. It is badly built, the houses being mostly of mud, with flat roofs, and the bazar is insignificant and ill- supplied. It is divided into 4 parishes, has 4 masjids and two caravan serais inside the town and 5 masjids outside. When Muzaffar-ul-Mulk was Governor of Luristan as representative of the Zill-us-Sultan, he partially dismantled the fort, and used the bricks and stone pillars in building a large caravanserai on the other side of the river. Although the chief town of Luristan, Khurramabad has practically no industries. This is chiefly owing to the unsettled state of the country. It is the chief market to which the Lurs bring their wool, which they exchange for cartridges, etc. The only artisans seen are Persians from Malair, who are engaged in making and repairing rifles and in manufacturing the necessary articles of daily life. The surrounding plain is capable of giving great returns if properly cultivated, but the Lurs cultivate scarcely enough to provide for their own needs. As often as not, the grain which feeds them comes from the Persian plateau. Rice in small quantities, wheat and barley are cultivated round Khurramabad, and close to the town on the river banks are many rich gardens. From June to September, fruits and vegetables of all kinds and of excellent quality are in great abundance and scarcely fetch a price. The river, a broad shallow stream, passes along to the south, east of the town and is fordable everywhere. At times, it carries a large volume of water. The people are slothful and somewhat malgnant looking. Each seems to view his neighbour askance, as if half expecting to get a knife or a shot in his back as he passes. In winter the cold is severe, with a considerable fall of snow, but the transition to summer is very rapid. From the end of March the country begins to be covered with flowers and verdure. The summer is torrid, and during the months of June, July, August and September the inhabitants move to the hills. In October the rain is heavy. The altitude of Khurram abad has been given variously as 3,875 feet, 4,050 feet, 4,500 feet and 4,700. The town is said to contain some 2,000 houses, and estimates of the population range from 2,000 to 700 souls. There is a Persian telegraph station here. The town and fort are commanded from high ground to the eastward within easy rifle range. The place is of no military strength. The camping-ground, suitable for a brigade, lies to the west of the town.534 KHU-KHU The Khurramabad district seems formerly to have been called Samha. Regarding Samha, the Akrad Nameh says that Atabeg Shujab-ud-Din sent his°sons, Badr and Haidar, from Manrud to Samha to fight the Jangardi tribe. The sons went there and beseiged Diz-i-Siah. The citadel of Khurramabad is even now occasionally called Diz-i-Siah.—— Chesncy Kinneir — Robinson — Jones — Schindler — DeMorgan, 1891, Report of a Journey through the Bakhtidri Country to Shushtar.)

KHUZISTAN— Lat. 30° to 32° 30'; Long. 48° to 51° ; Elev. A province of Persia, situated in i1 s extreme south-west corner. It is bounded north and east by Luristan and the Bakhtiari mountains, south by the province of Ears and the Persian Gulf, and west by the Shatt-al-’Arab and the Pashalik of Baghdad. Layard gives the following boundaries of Khuzistan :— “ The following are at present generally considered as its proper bound aries To the north and east the mountains of the great chain on which the first snow usually falls ; to the west the river Karkheh, although the pastures on its western bank are inhabited by tribes under the Vali (Gov ernor) of Hawizeh, and are usually considered as Persian ground; to the south the Jarrahi or Kurdistan river, and a line drawn across the desert from the Karun to the Karkhch, a l!ew miles above the junction of each of the rivers with the Shatt-al-’Arab, or Euphrates ; to the east the Kurdistan. Within this province, therefore, are included the towns of Shushtar, Dizful and Hawizeh, the plain of Bam Hormuz, the Bakhtiari, part of the Faili and part of the Ka’ab Arabs : the latter tribes, however, have hitherto been assessed by the Governor of Fars. Behbehan, although in our maps included in the province of Khuzistan, is properly in that of Fars. “ Khuzistan has a length of about 200 miles from Kaleh-i-Rizeh to the I Jairahi river, a breadth of 130 miles from Muhammareh to the northern mountains, and an area of 25,677 square miles. “ It is divided politically and administra ively into two districts, viz., i that of the Shaikh of the Ka’ab Arabs and the Government of Shushtar. Its southern portion is composed of low-lying plains indented by numerous hhurs, or inlets, and often inundated by the rivers which run through it in such profusion. The northern part consists of fine, open plains, bound ed in their highest parts by the mountains.“ To the south and west of the province are homes of the wandering tribes of Arabs under their different Shaikhs, and on the north and east are tribes of Lurs and Persians. “ To the north-east of Khuzistan is the lofty chain of the mountains of the Bakhtiari—a continuation of the main Kurdistan range. Their summit are frequently within the range of perpetual snow, but they are interspersed with fertile valleys, which are well-watered and possess a generous soil. These mountains are the summer residences (ydlldq) of the Lur tribes. To the south of them are found highly fertile valleys and spacious plains, on which are the winter encampments of the same tribes. Beyond these, again, there occurs a range of hills, varying from 5,000 to 2,000 feet in height, running parallel with the great chain, and consisting of sandstone and a very friable limestone, much intermixed with gypsum ; and to the west of these are vast plains stretching in one almost uninterrupted flat to the Tigris, the Shatt-al-’Arab, and the sea.” The only hills in Khuzistan are the above-mentioned hills, which Layard mentions as a parallel and separate range to the main range. This, pre sumably, must be a mistake, and it seems more probable that the low hills are merely the ends of spurs from the main range, which spread out into an appearance of distinctness from their parent. Khuzistan is abundantly supplied with rivers, being in this respect differ ent from the rest of Persia. Of these the most important are the Karun, Dizful, Karkheh, and the Jarrahi. The climate of the upper part of Khuzistan, about Shushtar and Dizful, is very healthy. Of mineral products, near Mai Baud are found white naphtha and bitumen, and limestone abounds in all the low hills. The population of Khuzistan is mostly composed of wandering tribes : these are the Faili, Bakhtiari, the Kuhgalu Mamassani to the north, and in the south the Arab tribes of Anafijeh, A1 Kathir, the Ka’b, and Bam Lam. « In addition to the care of cattle, which is the prevailing occupation, agriculture is - carefully attended to, and the quantity of tobacco, rice and other grain (especially barh y) produced along the banks of the river is con siderable. Some cotton is likewise grown, and in the district of Ahwaz sugar was abundant at no very distant period. On the lower parts of the Karun and Karkheh, as well as in the Ka’ab country, dates are sufficiently abundant to be an article of commerce. In addition to the bitumen and naphtha of Band-i-Qir, Darreh-i-Naft, etc., tents, red cloth, coarse woollens, and some cottons are manufactured, the last chiefly at Dizful, where dyeing is extensively practised. Large •flocks of sheep, with a portion of goats, camels, horses and mules, are to be seen on all the rich pasture-grounds of Susiana. Occasionally permanent walled villages are met with, but the greatest part of the inhabitants live in tents, which are of a largo size, being sup ported by a number of poles in parallel rows, lessening in height from the ridge towards the sides, which are very low. This kind of tent is more commodious than that which is in use in other parts of Persia or in Arabia. 3YZ640 KHU-KHU In the latter country, more frequent changes of residence render one of a higher and smaller construction necessary. The principal towns of Khuzistan are Shushtar, Dizful, Ram Hormuz, Fallahieh. The communications of Khuzistan to the foot of the mountains are ex tremely open and easy, by means of the numerous rivers which intersect it, especially the Karun. The Ka’ab country is difficult by reason of its flooded state in winter and the almost total absence of water in summer. From Shushtar there is a route to Isfahan and Shiraz by Behbehan, and to Baghdad through the country of the Bani Lam Arabs. From Dizful there are routes to Khurramabad and Burujird, and thence to Kirmanshah and Hamadan. ? Khuzistan is under the administration of the Governor of Arabistan, who is usually a member of the Royal family. The holder of the office in 1879 was Prince Hamza Mirza, better known by his title of Hashmat- ud-Dauleh. His nominal residence is Khurramabad in Luristan. The collection of revenue is the only function of Government which the Prince Governor performs, all other matters being left to the discretion of chiefs or Governors of the six districts into which Khuzistan is divided. The revenue is of two kinds :— divan, which goes to Tehran and pishkash, which the Prince governor takes for himself. The six districts, their present chiefs, estimated population, and the revenue of both kinds which they paid in 1879 is as follows :— District. Present chiefs or governors. Estimated population.

The frontier village above Dilam is Shaikh ’Abu-Shaikh or Shah-’Abu-Shah. The Government of Behbehan adjoins that of the Ka’b ’Arabs to the south and west, and is under that of Ears, the head-quarters of which are at Shiraz. The minor settlements to the southward of the Hindian to Bushire embrace a series of petty tribes, both Persian and ’Arab, living in their own circles of villages, and interfered with by the Central Persian Government very much in proportion to their several means of resistance. They are subordinate to the Government of Bushire. Of the settlements, fths are probably Persian, |th ’Arab. As a general rule, the ’Arab circles of villages are farmed and administered by their own Shaikhs, who arrange their own civil disputes, and pay a lump sum as revenue per annum. They are coming every year more and more under the local officers of the Shah. The Persian circle of villages or a Persian port comes directly under the local officers of the Shah.

It is about 10 miles in length from north-west to south-east and about 4 in breadth. Its elevation is from about 4,200 to 3,600 feet. The valley itself is bare of trees, though large quantities grow on the range bounding it to the south, a continuation of the Kuh Kalich. The Kuh Kal Kush to the north of it is practically bare, a stream flows down the centre of the valley which is well-watered by numerous springs, and the grazing, though no doubt excellent in the spring and early summer, is now (September) dried up, except in a few places. The place is inhabited by the Manish Kalhur Kurds under ’Aziz Khan, an old man, his elder son being Mahdi Khan. They number 200 tents with 100 horses, 200 cows and 3,000 sheep. There are also about 300 donkeys. These people do not migrate, but live during the winter inside rough stone walls built against the southern face of the Kuh Kal Kush, and in them they pitch their tents. The place appears to be self-sustaining to a great extent, as there are considerable crops of wheat and barley ; tobacco, also, and pumpkins are grown, and there are several water-mills. The valley must have been in ancient days a place of considerable importance, judging by the numerous ruins of forts and towns that remain : they are now, however, but little else than mounds of stones. They are said to have been the work of the Zoroastrians popu-larly known in Persia as the “ Gabrs This valley leads into the Guar valley by a road 8 miles in length up a narrow valley much blocked up with low hills, but containing a good supply of water and well-wooded.

KUIIGALU— A division of the Lur tribe, inhabiting the province of Kuhgalh. They adjoin the Bakhtiaris on the north, the Qashqals on the Shiraz side, the Mamassani on the east, and the Arabs on the west and north-west. The country occupied by them lies between the districts of the Mamassani, Diz Kurd, and Sarhadd-i-Shish Nahieh on the east and those of Bamuz and Fallahleh on the west, and between the Bakhtiari district on the north and the Persian Gulf and the districts of Dashtistan and Mahur Milati on the south. The Kuhgalu consider themselves as distinct from the Bakhtiaris ; their dialect, however, differs but little from that of the Bakhtiari, and their manners, customs, character and religion are the same. The Kuhgalu are under the Governor of Behbehan, and each division has its own Chiefs, who is responsible for the annual tribute. So long as this is paid, and the tribes do not harass their Persian neighbours or engage in serious hostilities among themselves, their internal government is not greatly interfered with. Their summer and winter quarters are little more than a transition from the summit to the foot of the mountains. The Kuhgalu are divided into two main divisions, those of Pusht-i-Kuh or the mountainous region of the north-east, and those of Zir-i-Kuh which consists of the 3 districts of Behbehan, Zaidan and Liravi. The tribes are550 KUH—KUH said to number 15,000 families and to be able to raise 10,000 fighting-men Chick, 1909, says that it is estimated that the Kuhgalu number more than 100,000.

The Bakhtiari caravan road runs along a northern spur of the range, on its 9th stage from Isfahan, between miles 146 and 150. ^ The pass of the same name is crossed by the Isfahan- Arabistan trade road, immediately above and to the west of the Pul-i* Amarat bridge over662 KUH—KUH th« Bazuft river. It seems to be known as the Gardaneh-i-MarvSrid also. The ascent from the bridge is a steep and stony zig-zag. It must always be severe from its length, but the state of repair makes a great difference. In 1906 it had been cleared and improved. The bottom portion is in rocky soil and hence the track is narrow and rough. The immediate ascent from the bridge is a steep rock surface. Half a mile below the pass on the Pul-i-’Amarat side is the Chashmeh- i-Marvarid, a spring of scanty water, and the Kaleh-i-Marvarid is passed almost immediately afterwards. The Kaleh has now onlv some walls left standing. It was built of rubble and gach. To the south-west of the pass, the road crosses connecting ridges to the Manak ride, above Deh Diz. To the north of the pass, the mountain falls steeply to the ravine running down to the Bazuft river. The hills around are well wooded. There is no water except at the Marvarid spring. The ascent from the Pul-i-’Amarat to the top of the pass is about 2,000 feet and the descent 1,&lt;50 feet by an easy gradient and a good, broad road, the last few hundred feet being steep. Height of the pass 5,800 feet. ■ {Burton, 1903 Report of a Journey through the Balchtlari Country to Shush- tar—Morton, 1905—Arhuthnot, 1905—Lorimer, 1906.) KUHIMEH— Lat. Long, Elev.

A mountain forming the south-eastern extremity of the Kuchur range on the south-west side of the Riz river valley. This mountain is perhaps identifiable with Siri ’Aianat, whose altitude above the sea by Admiralty chart is 4,660 feet. Mr. Butcher’s observations, by boiling point thermo meter and four-inch aneroid corrected for index error, etc., give the altitude above sea 4 ; 216 feet and above Jam, 1,527 feet. This mountain bears from Jam 2254°, distant three and a half nyles. Near its northern foot are the remains of two large bands, also a plantation of date trees with the ruins of several old houses. From this point the ascent of Kuh-i-Puzeh Padri, which occupies 1 hour 45 minutes, is usually made. The base of the hill is composed of solid limestone rock, from a cleft in which a stream of pure fresh water issues and runs into an artificial cistern. The bands mentioned above were probably intended to store this water, as also the surface drainage. The north-east side of the mountain although very steep, forms ledges and slopes, which might be utilised for building. Paths also might readily be made. On the side of the hill are passed, in the ascent, the ruins of small stone houses said, by the natives, to have been inhabited by white men, presumably the Portuguese. The mountain, which is rocky and stony, is generally bare and devoid of trees, shrubs or grass. The summit forms a level area of considerable extent, length roughly 400 and breadth 200 yards. , From this point precipices drop, on the south-west and south-east sides, to the depth of 350 to 450 feet, and a fine panorama is afiorded of the sea coast to the south-east and of the surrounding mountain system. The ascent from the north-east side, although very rugged and precipitous and diffi cult, would be practicable for mule batteries.— {Butcher, 1888.) KtJH-I-QATRU or KUH-I-SURKH— Lat. Long. Elev.

The highest peak is 12,800 feet and is probably the highest of the Zardeh Kuh group. The Kuh-i-Rang is the centre of this range, and the central sponge from which all the rivers in these parts have their sources. It consists of large, rounded spurs trending the usual course north-west to south-east, with gentle slopes and far-reaching limbs to the south-east, and with abrupt, rocky and deeply gutted ravines to the north-west. At a distance of a few miles these are cross-cut by the water system, of which the Gukun river, run ning north-east to south-west, is a part, at an all itude of 6,000 feet and below the Zardeh Kuh peaks. The Zardeh Kuh peaks are five in number, united together by round-topped watersheds, affording an abundance of water (snow), fuel and fodder, with a magnificent view in every direction.— {Sawyer, 1890.)KUH-KUH 565 KCH-I-RANG (BAR €HASMEH-I-)—w’de BAR CHASMEH-I-KtH-I-RAG.

It forms the boundary between the Isfahan and Chehar Mahal districts. The ascent to the Gardan-i-Rukh is steep and strewn with stones and boulders, ruling gradients ^ toy 1 ^. The last ascent consists of steep zig-zags. The descent is more gentle than the ascent, but the boulders blocking it are of larger size, some over 6 feet high.

A range of hills in the Sarvistan district of Ears. On the north-west side, where the *Sarvistan-Fasa road ascends it, are two towers, one on the side of , the hill, the other on the top of a spur. The whole of this piece of country resembles that on the top of the gach hills between Kamarij and Kazarun. The road runs almost along the north-west side of the Kuh-i-Shh, and the ground between it and the hill is completely seamed with water-courses and gullies, and has a very scored appearance.— (Preece, 1884.) RUHISTAN (1)— The name of the mountainous tract lying to the west and south-west of Yazd town. Roughly speaking it extends from Nadushan in the north-west to Kalvand in the south. It consists of several ranges running from north-west to south-east, and connected by high ground with an average elevation of 5,500 feet. The highest peaks of the range are the Shir Kuh, 13,740 feet, the Kuh-Tizarjan 13,986 feet, and the Kuh Ardarushk about ' 14,500 feet. These hills as a rule rise gradually from the Yazd side, and fall abruptly on the other side to the level of the plateau. Kuhistan is divided into three parts :— (1) Pish Kuh. (2) Mian Kuh. (3) Pusht-i-Kuh. (1) Pish Kuh comprises Taft, Khunsar, Fakhrabad, and other adjacent villages and towns ; (2) Mian Kuh, all the central towns such as Deh Bala, Tizarjan and Masheh ; while (3) Pusht-i-Kuh comprises the remainder of the elevated region to the west. The richest, most populous, and most productive region is that of Mian Kuh, which is also the most elevated, Deh Bala being 7,992 feet, and Masheh, 8,291 feet above sea-level. Kuhistan contains many rich and fertile valleys, we’l watered by copious streams which are always running. The principal of these are the ’Aliabad valley, which extends as far as Taft, the Deh Bala, Tizarjan and Mashed valleys. These are all densely populated and contain numerous gardens and plantations of trees. Habitations .—The people live in flat-roofed houses built of mud, like those in the plains, but the walls and roofs generally have large projecting i caves to protect them from the heavy rainfall. Most of the towns are L built on the banks of streams. The gardens are frequently unwalled, the terraces, which hill cultivation necessitates, being considered in many cases a sufficient boundary. Population .—The total population numbers about 27,000. The strict seclusion usually practised by Mussalmans as regards the privacy of their houses and wives is not carried out, and the people appear to be a quiet and simple lot, devoid of latent fanaticism. In Taft, Parsis and Muhammadans live pe ceably side by side. A large proportion of the population are Babis, or else openly sympathise with them. The greater part of the inhabitants of Masheh belong to this sect. Climate .—The winter, as might be expected in these elevated regions, is very severe, and the inhabitants of the valleys are frequently cut off from all communication with the outside world for days together. The first fallsof snow usually take place about the end of November, and the thaw usually set in February. The higher hills are snow clad until March or April, while the crevasses and ravines of the loftier peaks contain snow and ice all the year round, and supply the city with large quantities during the summer months. During the month of June, the hot weather sets in at Yazd. At this season a large number of the inhabitants leave the city and come up to Kuhistan, where they have gardens and summer houses. Towards the end of September, when the weather becomes cooler, they return to the city. Produce and supplies, etc.—KW the suppl es of Yazd, such as sheep, fruit, vegetables, firewood and grass come from these hills; and also the chief water-supply is led from here by qandts. The following are among the products of Kuhistan :— Fruits. Mulberries, white and black, apples, cherries, melons, plums, walnuts, filberts, apricots, greengages, peaches, quinces and grapes. Vegetables.^ Potatoes, cabbages, spinach, lettuces, cucumbers, beetroot, radishes, onions and celery. Besides fruit trees there are an abundance of others, chief amongst ufhich are the poplar and the willow. On the hills every sort of shrub is found ; while the asafoetida plant provides a lucrative employment to the inhabitants, who collect the juice which is exported in great quantities to Bombay. Many of the villages and towns contain numerous silk-worms, and in others such as »Sanij, one cannot walk a few paces without stumbling over a beehive ; for in this country, with the usual disregard for the safety and convenience of the general public, the hives are all placed on the ground. Minerals. There are no mines working in the hills, but there are some caves near Taft which are partially artificial, and there are traces of copper ore in places. In thePalangan hills near NarakI, there are marble rocks and traces of iron ore in places. Antimony is found in the Kuh Ardarushk, pieces having been picked up on the surface by shepherds; crystals are found in the hills west of Masheh, and there are some celebrated marble mines at Turum Pusht. Game. The wild sheep, ibex, antelope, leopard, hyaena, wolf, jackal, fox, grey partridge, qua 1, pigeon, and sandgrouse abound, and the imperial sandgrouse and hare are found on the plateau. Game however is very wild being much shot at. .—-There are large streams flowing down from the Deh Bala. Tizar- jan, Bavanat and Masheh valleys, but such is the dryness of the soil that they totally disappear on the plain west of Sar-i-Yazd. There is sufficient water flowing from the eastern slopes of Kuhistan to form a rapid river, ^0 yards broad and 3 feet deep. The streams flowing from the western slopes of the hills are smaller, but contain an ample supply of water . and the soil also on the plateau to the west appears to contain more water, as springs appear oozing out of the ground in all directions, and wells reach water at a few feet below the surface. The stream at Kal Bal Biz above Mehriz contains numerous fish, as also do some of those near the city, where the fish run to 2 lbs. in weight. Topography —-The chief and largest towns in Kflhistan are Taft, Nasirabad Ahabad, Nil, Sanlj, Deh Bala, Tizarjan, Gasheh and Masbeh.—( Vaughan. 1890.)568 KUH-KUH KtfHISTAN (2) — A district in Kirman, containing about 100 hamlets, lying north-east of Zarand.— (Sykes, 1894.)

A lofty range in the Pusht-i-Kuh district of Luristan. To the south-west of the Band-i-Nua (the ancient Zagros) is a long ridge commencing near Qasr-inShirm and running south-east, called in succession the Sumbuluh Kuh, the Kalajeh Kuh, and Vardalan Kuh ; these are all the same range and form the backbone of the mountains. This range is steep and impass able for the greater part of its length, and at its south-east extremity merges in the mountainous country of Pish Kuh, at the head-waters of the Kashgan river. It is crossed on the track between Kirmanshah and Deh Bala by the Vardalan Pass, at an elevation of 6,000 feet between 50 and 60 miles from Kirmanshah. On approaching the range from the Elev. Isfahan, to the right of the road Elev.Kirmanshah direction, a series of high, parallel ranges, running north-west and south-east, are met with. The rock is hard, grey limestone, the strata well marked and occasionally standing out perfectly vertical. Although stony, the soil is rich, with some fine trees, tSO to 50 feet high and 3 to 4 feet in diameter, usually in the most inaccessible places. Most have been used for firewood. The principal trees are bal'd oaks, pistachio, hawthorn, and numerous shrubs and undergrowth. In spring time the grass is rich and very abundant. The passage of the Vardiilan range is difficult, but passable for mules and carefully-led horses. Near Chardavar, the valley on the Deh Bala side into which the track emerges, the southern slope is an almost perpendicular sheet of rock extending for a considerable distance. The ridges are very stenp with razor-edge summits, and the road might be aptly compared to the track of an ant crawling along the teeth of a large saw.— (Maunsell, 18S8.) K0H-I-YAFTEH— Lat. Long.

Supplies in abundance are said to be procurable from the neighbouring villages, but are scanty in Kunar Takhteh itself. The water in the wells at this place is plentiful but brackish ; good water, however, is procurable from a spring 2 miles distant. On the other hand, Noel says the water, August 1908, is liable to run short in which case water is to be obtained from an ambdr at the top of the Malu. Draught cattle are pro curable in the neighbourhood. There is an old caravanserai here with an arched gateway leading into a yard, round which are rooms for travellers and behind them stalls, and there is also a small suite of rooms over the gateway. In the centre yard is an elevated platform, the roof of a sub terranean chamber called “ Zir-Zamini ”, to which travellers retire during the great heat of summer. There is a telegraph station here. The name of the village signifies “ jujube bed ” from the bush which flourishes in the neighbourhood. Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a medical report on the part of Persia adjacent to the telegraph line, writes thus of the country between Dal- aki and Kunar Takhteh :— “ The climate is less damp and slightly less hot and enervating than that of the district between DalakI and Bushire. During July and August hot winds are prevalent. Good drinking water is procurable from the hills a few miles distant. The food of the people is essentially the same as about DalakI (q. v.) as also are the diseases to which they are liable. Ophthalmia, especially prurient ophthalmia, is perhaps less common ; it certainly is of a milder type and causes less mischief.” Monthly average thermometer readings for Kundr Takhteh.—January 1882 to June 1883.

Most of the water in the Band Amir river is exhausted before it reaches lake Niriz on account of the numerous irrigation channels in this district, which is one of the most fertile in the country, producing abundance of rice, barley, wheat, tobacco and some cotton. The cultivation of rice in this plain is inconceivably great, and it is admitted to be by far the richest and cheapest in the Persian Empire. The greatest part of the wine, known by the name of Shiraz wine, is made here. It extends east and west from Pul-i-Talkh to Band Amir, about 40 miles, and north and south about 15 miles.-—!#.

A pass in Ears, over a low range of hills between Kazarun and the plain of Abdhi. The ascent commences 9 miles from Kazarun, and is about one in 8 or 10. The road is excellent. At the foot of the mountain there is a causeway across a creek of the salt lake, called the Darla-i-Parlshan [q.v.), which is said to be deep but narrow. The road has been carried by stone steps directly up the face of the mountain, with a very few abrupt zigzags, and nothing can be more unpromising for baggage and artillery than the ap pearance of this passage. The road was first made by the mother of Imam Qull Khan, Viceroy of Ears, under Shah ’Abbas, when it was called Kutal- i-Ushanak. At the end of the eighteenth century it was reconstructed by a merchant, Haji Muhammad Husain of Bus hire. Abo at 1820 it was put in repair by Kalb ’AH Khan, Governor of Kazarun, and impressed Rich so much that he called it the Simplon of Persia.” It was again repaired in ^ 1834 by the mother of Timur Mirza, and about 1870 by the Mushir-ul-Mulk, Vazir of Ears, sin.ce when it d* es not seem to have been attended to, and Newcomen says that now (1905) it is in a worse condition than ever. It is almost impossible for a horse or mule to go up or down this pass without falling. It appears to have been carried up the steepest face of the rock. Clark, writing in 1857, says the road leads down the precipitous sides of a lofty mountain; the roadway for the most part be mg perfectly smooth, quicklime having been used in filling up and level ling the way after the stones had been laid down. The filling material between the stones has long since disappeared, leaving holes, and the road jiow consists of great, irregular blocks of stone, worn smooth and slippery by the hoofs of countless mules. A strong stone parapet, also finished with brick and lime, is continued for about 2 miles, the length of the roadway; now it is a very low breast wall which guards the road in places only. So perpendicular is the mountain that a stone might be thrown from the sum mit to any part of this way. Monteith mentions having searched for a more practicable route, and having come to the conclusion that if another cause way or bridge were thrown across the creek, a tolerably easy road might be made about £ a mile to the east of the present one, and then the hill up582 KUT—KUT which the present road is carried would only require to he occupied by the flanking party in place of the high rocks to the west; on the east the hills are not so rocky and are much easier of access. The ascent of this pass from the east is not more than a mile, after which a much easier descent leads to the valley of ’Abdul. DeBode says the following circuit may be made on the road from Bushire to Shiraz to avoid the descent of this pass, which is terrible for a train of artillery. On descending Pir Zan turn to the right through the valley of Dasht-i-Bir of ’Abdul, cross the plain of Chenar - Shahijan which communicates with it, and thence pass into that of Shahpur which forms part of the vale of Kazarun. This circuitous road has the shape of a ho seshoe, and presents no obstacles for 1 he trans't of baggage, but it is 45 miles in length, while the other is only about 15 or 16 miles. Clerk also thinks that the road, instead of scaling the highest and most precipitous mountain of the range, might have avoided this pass by going a little more to the south, and Taylor mentions a road that goes from Kazarun by the Tang-i-Turkan, and striking north-west passes the village of Nadun, about half-way. This road is longer, 48 miles, the one by the pass being 32 only. MacGregor says this pass rises about 500 feet (Stack, 1,000 fee') in 2 miles, and is all built up with retaining walls. The gradients are not, as a rule, severe for hills, but the roadway is simply execrable, the lime of the original paving having broken away. Nevertheless a determined leader could get guns up, and without very much labour the road might be much improved. The heights above afford an exceedingly strong position, as stated above ; but the hills to the right and left are certainly practicable for light infantry, and the pass could be turned. This pass is one of the difficulties of the Bushire-Shiraz trade route. Curzon corroborates the execrable state of the road, which he says has been artificially paved with huge boulders which now stand up like isolated reefs in the sea. He says the descent is 700 feet in the perpendicular, and another 700 feet before the Kazarun plain is reached.— {TMvenot—Rich—Monteith — Deode — Taylor— Clerk— Hardy—MacGregor—Curzon, 1889—Newcomen, 1905.)

KUTAL-I-KAMARIJ —Lat. Long. Elev. 3,100'. - A pass in Pars, 80 miles on the road from Bushire to Shiraz. It is described as very steep, and obstructed by fragments of rock fallen from the moun tain’s side, about which the road winds, sometimes .through chasms so narrow as scarcely to admit a loaded mule, and at many turns impending over torrents and abysses, where one false step must precipitate the traveller into destruction. The path is so narrow that only in a few places can twoKUT-KUT 583 j mules pass one another No one, however, has attempted to pave this pass, and though steep and difficult to a degree, it is possible to get a foothold. In places the road h°,S been revet' ed. The pass stands 1.400 feet above the iffian below. The ascent from the south of 4 miles takes nearly 5 hours by a narrow, precipitous road, supported by a wall on the lower side, and altogether so difficult that, if adequately defended, it could scarcely be forced by an army till turned by another road ; but guns have been carried across it. There are excellent positions for signalling all up the pass, vide Kamarij. k It was on the worst part of this ascent, known as the Kamar, or ledge of Asad Khan, that the Afghan chief of that name found himself in 1752 en trapped between the followers of Rustam Sultan, chief of Khisht, hidden in the crags above, and the soldiery of Karim Khan Zand in the valley below, and realized to his cost the small chance of escape from such a man-trap. The descent is one mile long and drops from 3,100 feet to 1,400 feet.—- {Ouseley -Monteith — Chesney — MacGregor — Curzon—Routes in Persia, Section I, Ed. 1898.) KUTAL-I-MALU— La.t. Long. Elev. 1,800'. A pass in Ears, 66 miles on the road from Bushire to Kazarun. From the right bank of the river Dalaki, about 7 miles from the village of that name, the ascent commences, and at first is easy for 2 miles : thence for 2 miles it is difficult and steep, the road zigzagging shortly up over slippery masses of rock and stone, the last part being exceedingly rugged and difficult. The height is estimated at 1,500 feet of steep climbing. A causeway built in zigzags up the kutal is not used, as its surface is slippery. Mules avoid this attractive but deadly dangerous sangband, and have worn in the rock a number of branching paths up and down the mountain side. These now unite, now divide, but allow of more than one animal going up and down at the ame time. Though bad, this pass cannot compare for vileness with the Kutal-i-Pir Zan, Kutal-i-Dukhtar or Kutal-i-Kamanj. It is quite impass able for guns, or any horses except those used to climbing. In forcing this pass, it would be necessary to occupy the rocky heights on both sides. For about l mile the road is tolerably good, and Monteith thinks that by throwing a bridge of date trees across, and passing over from the right to the left side of the defile, a much easier path might be opened. Stack des cribes this pass as a rocky staircase, 1,000 feet high, with its landing in the plain of Khisht, 1,800 feet above the sea. Part of the road is paved with stones, but the rest is the work of nature except the last half mile or so. On the other hand, MacGregor says that, of this pass, the road could all be made practicable for field artillery. The elevated ridge of rock to the left affords a very strong position, and it would be absolutely necessary to take s it before attempting the pass in the face of an enemy. Curzon reiterates the impossibility of field guns ascending the kutal, but points out that an easy though longer road can be found by following the banks of the river Shapur and skirting the hills on the west. The name of Kutal-i-Malu, which means the U cursed pass” and was probably given to it by reason of the epithets of the ascending travellers, is not always used ; several other names being bestowed according to the fancy of the people. {Clerk Monteith — MacGregor — Curzon—Routes in Persia, Section I, Ed. 1898.) Y584 KUT-KUT KUTAL-I-MUSHGCN— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Ears crossed on the road from Shiraz to Kazarun between Musghun and Garreh.* On the Shiraz side the pass itself is steep, but the road is fairly good and lies nearly throughout on very soft lime. On the Kazarun side the road is more stony perhaps than before, and the descent is sharp and unpleasant.— [Durand.) KUTAL-I-PlR ZAN— Lat. Long. Elev. 7,500b A pass in Ears, between ’Abdui and Dasht-i-Arjin,' 49 miles from Shiraz by road calculated from Mian Kutal. The name, which means “ Pass of the Old Woman,” is apparently given to it on account of its being so peculiarly uninviting, in which quality it resembles the old women of Persia. It is the longest of all the passes on the Bushire and Shiraz road, but is much more practicable than any of the others. Monteith thinks it would not be necessary to dismount artillery, though the guns would require the assistance of sol diers to drag them up the steep south ascent, a distance of nearly 3 miles. The chief difficulty of the pass is caused by the large, loose stones and, if less steep, it is, if possible, rougher than the Kutal-i-Dukhtar. Newcomen describes the north side of the pass as more like an avalanche track than a road, and adds that the south side is worse still. About half-way up the pass is the serai of Mian Kutal, where travellers can stop. Stack in 1882 found this caravanserai clean and in good order. Coming from Bushire it is 2 miles from the commencement of the pass, and there is camping space for 500 men. At Mian Kutal the water was good and a plentiful supply could be obtained from a stream there, but no other supplies are procurable [vide this Gazetteer—Mian Kutal). Newcomen, however, in 1905 reported the water of Mian Kutal to be bad and scarce. Curzon says that this pass could be avoided by striking the hills 2 miles to the east, where they dip into the Dasht Arjin. There is also a longer route from Bushire to Shiraz via Eiruzabad, which avoids the bad passes, but it is some 210 miles in length. It was by this latter route that the Persians brought their guns in 1857. The pass is covered with snow in winter, but traffic does not appear to be impeded thereby although the snow no doubt adds to the already existing difficulty ex,perienced over this pass.— [Ouseley—Monteith — Petty — Sutherland — St. John — MacGregor — Curzon, 1889 — Newcomen, 1905 — Mark' ham — Ussher.)

This feature becomes more strongly developed as the river pursues its course in a north-west direction, and the air in its vicinity, even, becomes redolent of naphtha. Its deep, sluggish pools are swarming with fish, which run up to 14 inches in length. It is nearly always fordable unless swollen by rain, when it becomes a.n impetuous and dangerous torrent. It waters the fine pasture table-lands, extending from the plain of Tuleh to the banks of the Karun river. In its final stretch it runs through a gorge on the north side of the Kuh-i-Fidalak and empties itself into the Karun, about 8 miles north of Shushtar. The river is known by many different names, besides the two given above, such as ’ Ab-i-Shur, Darreh, Murdeh-i-Fil, Zan-i-Murdeh.~,(Za//ard[— not, 1905.) LAB-I-RUDKHANEH (?)— Lat, Long.

The capital of the district of Lar, 153 miles from Shiraz, and 127 from Bandar ’Abbas, situated at the west end of a valley running east and west ^ and nestling at the foot of low, limestone hills, which block the west extre mity of the valley ; it is not visible from any great distance on the roads leading thereto. It is an unwalled city, covering about \ square mile, dominated by two eteep, limestone hills, about 400 feet above the level of the city. The north hill is known as Kadamgah, and contains one or two huts and the ruins of an old fort, said to have been utilized as a prison for Balhch jnaiauders in past times. . - r\590 LAR—LAR There are traces of old building, and the remains of a large cistern, dug in the solid limestone rock, said to have been made by a colony of Gabrs who lived on the hill in past times. The northern slope of the hill was descended by a large ditch with bastions, the remains of which are still visible. This hill is crowned by the ruins of an old mud fort, now entirely dilapi dated, and commanded from the top of the northern hill, which is about 1,200 yards distant. On the hillside below the fort stands a small square, stone building with a dome, said to be the dome of Nadir Shah’s mother ; near this are two Persian baths excavated in the rock, and well sunk about 200 feet through the limestone. Lar has a population which it is difficult to estimate, but which would seem to be about 8,000. It has no local manufactures of any importance, the size of the city being due to its importance as a centre of trade, and ,a halting-place of large caravans. The bazar, which is in good repair, is very ancient, and is built in the same manner as that of Shiraz, being cross-shaped, the 4 arms, each 60 yards long and 14 feet broad, radiating from a central tank, which has a domed roof about 30 feet high, now (1907) the only portion remaining of the original roof. All the arms are covered with vaulted roofing about 30 feet high. On each side of each arm is a row of shops, on a plinth raised some 4 feet above the roadway. Each shop has a depth of about 6 feet, a small room behind serving as a store room. Round the central dome runs a legible inscription. Close to the west and east arms of the bazar are two very large roofed cisterns, some 35 feet deep, containing a large supply of good water. There are two mosques in the city, each with a large blue dome 60 feet high, visible from a considerable distance. There are 6 broken-down muzzle-loading guns close to the Sarbdz- Khdneh —deserted barracks on the north-east side of the town. The present (1907) Governor, HajI Azuk ’All Khan, has been Governor for 8 years, and has a personal force of some 203 tufangchis, who receive pay from him, and not from Imperial funds. They are armed with Mar tinis, of the usual cheap kind found in Persia ; the Governor also possesses some Mauser lifles, but these were not seen. The roads leading to Lar are not entirely free from robbers ; depreda tions take place occasionally, though the danger from this source is usually much exaggerated by mule-drivers and others. The brother of the present Khan was killed by robbers on the Lingeh road some years ago. The transit road to Shiraz, from Lingeh and Bandar ’Abbas is, however, of considerable dimensions. There are no Hindu merchants here, but about 30 families of Persian Jews. The houses of the town are usually commodious and well-built, with a central courty ar d. There are numerous cisterns, in which rain-water is collected, and a number of large wells about 70 feet deep, which give brackish water. There is also a large qandt, giving a large supply of water for cultivation a 11 ^ for the baths, drinking troughs for the cattle, etc. Sup plies of grain, fooT-stuffs of the country, and fodder, are very abundant, as Lar serves as a di s t r ik u ti n g as well as a collecting centre for these articles^592 LAR—LAR 4 LARDIGAN (?)— Lat.

Gulf 0 PP°site to the Pirate Coast, and comprised roughly between Lat. 26° 30' and 28° 25' and Long. 52° 30'and 56°. It has Ears to the north-west and north, Kirman to the north-east, and the district of Shamil on the east, while on the south lies the Gulf.’ The actual boundary line on the land side is, like that of most of the provinces of Persia, vague and ill-defined, but it may be said to start on the west, at the little sea village of Parak, which lies to the east of Tahiri, and from there to take a semi-circular sweep in a north-easterly direction to Bld- shahr, passing just to the south of that village ; from t here it runs north east to a point about midway between Furg and Rustaq, and then taking a curve to the south continues to Kahku and Guhreh, from the latter of which villages it runs vid Latidan to the sea near Khamir. The above may be taken as approximately the geographical limits of the province, but, for administrative purposes, the entire coast-line, with the exception of the Shlbkuh ports (q. v. ) and the country extending back from it for a distance of some 20 miles inland on an average, for ms part of the territory administered by the Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports, whose jurisdiction extends along the coast from Bandar Dllam on the north-west to Jashk on the south-east. The surface of the country is diversified with plains and mountains, the general trend of the latter being from north-north-west to south-south east, but the ranges in this province are not on the whole so extensive as in other parts of Southern Persia, nor do they attain the same elevation, seldom indeed exceeding 6,000 feet. Mountains rise along the whole extent of the coast, giving it a bold appearance, while many of the peaks serve as important landmarks to navigators of the Gulf. A great water-parting begins in the hills north of Lar, and extends up to Hajiabad in the Darab district of Fars, the rivers east of this flowing in the direction of Bandar ’Abbas, while those to the west of it drain into the sea between Charak and Bushire. The rivers are unimportant, the largest being, perhaps, the Shur, which flows into the Clarence Straits near Khamir, but this, like many of the smaller streams, is salt, and therefore not of much value for purposes of irrigation. The climate is trying to Europeans. In the belt which lies between Climate s ^ lores Gkdf and the higher ranges inland the heat in summer is very great, and is increased by the sandy and barren plains with which this track abounds. During the first two months of summer a strong north-westerly wind prevails over the whole of the district, which at times blows with such force that it brings with it clouds of a highly impalpable sand from theLAR-LAR 59 S 2. Lar 3. Bastak 4. Hormuz 5. Furg 6. Tarum opposite coast of Arabia, a distance of more than 2°. In the autumn the heat is more oppressive than in summer, but in winter and spring the climate is pleasant. It is never very cold and snow seldom falls. The rains, which are not heavy, fall in the winter or early spring and are almost always accompanied by a south-easterly wind, which, though often very violent, hardly ever continues for more than three or four days at a time. Laristan was conquered by a Turkish Chief about 800 years ago and remained an independent kingdom until the last H.story and Administration. ^ S0V ereigns was dethroned and put to death by Shah ’Abbas the Great. It is now subject to the Governor-General of Ears, appointed by the Shah, and having his head-quarters at Lar. The province is divided into the following districts :— 1. Gallehdar, chief town Gatlehdar. Lar. Bastak. Hormuz. Furg. formerly Tarum, now Kahku. In addition to these the coast district mentioned above as being now under the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, together with the islands adjacent to it, belong geographically to Laristan. This coast district includes the Shlbkuh ports {q.v,), as well as the district of Lingeh, which for generations was governed by an hereditary Shaikh whose tribe—a branch of the Kuwasim Juwasim Arabs—had come across from the opposite coast, until in 1889 the Persians seized the then ruler by a cou'p de main, and hav ing deported him to Tehran installed in his place a Deputy of the Governor of Bushire. In 1898 his son, Shaikh Muhammad bin Khalifeh, descended from the hills with a large following and seized the town. He was attacked by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, supported by the Persian gunboat Per- sepolis, and driven out after a feeble resistance, in which the losses on both sides amounted to about 40 killed and wounded. A party of blue jackets was landed by H.M. S. Sphinx for the protection of British subjects. On the adjacent island of Qais we had a military station during the pirate wars of the last century. On the north-east corner of Qishm island, which is separated from the mainland by the Clarence Straits, an important military and naval station was established by us in 1820, but this, as well as a station tried at the neighbouring islet of Hangam, being found unhealthy, a move was made to Basidu at the extreme north-west corner of the island. This became the head-quarters of the Indian Naval squadron, and a detachment of Indian troops was regularly maintained there until 1879, when it was removed to Task, where it remained until 1887. Basidu is still a British possession, but now consists of only a small coal depot. The province is but sparsely populated. According to Vaughan the Bastak district alone contains 15,000 inhabitants, Ethnography. and assuming that the other five districts have on the average a similar number, the total population of Laristan would amount to about 90,000. Such a calculation is, however, highly hypo- 112 LB. 4F,Tribe. Section. Sub-section. Families. Summer quarters. Winter quarters. ( GarmI \ .... 900 Lang-i- Khushk. Lor and Guium.

Laristan is one of the poorest and least productive of the Persian pro\inces, „ ranking in this respect probably only second to the Bashakard district. This is due in part to the lawlessness which prevails, but still more to the character of the country itself. Much of it is an arid desert, diversified by rocky hills and valleys of sand and salt. The inhabitants depend for their water- supply to a large extent upon cisterns and reservoirs, built with great labour to collect the scanty rainfall, and upon wells. Irrigation on anything approaching an extensive scale is impossible under these conditions. By far the most important product is the date tree, which flourishes throughout almost the entire province. Some wheat and barley is also cultivated, especially in the Lar and Bastak districts, while minor products include indigo, gum ammoniac, galbanum and sagapenum. Good graz ing is found in many parts of the province, which supports immense flocks of sheep and goats, besides smaller numbers of cattle, camels and donkeys. The swamps opposite Qishm island can provide large quantities of fuel— a scarce commodity in this, as in other, provinces of Persia, and a consider able supply is also said to be obtainable from the Kuh-i-Gavbus range near Bastak. Minerals are not known to exist in any quantity in Laristan, but sulphur and ironstone, with traces of ancient mine workings, are found in the moun tains to the north-east of the village of Hormuz (q.v.), while many tons of salt are annually exported from Qishm, where there is a cliff, 200 feet to 300 feet high, of pure rock salt. The latter is found in combination with iron ochre, which is also exported in considerable quantities. A coarse naphtha is also produced at some springs on the south coast of Qishm opposite Hangam island. Industries can hardly be said to exist, with the exception perhaps of ship-building, which is carried on to a limited extent at Lingeh. This port also sends its quota of boats to the Bahrain pearl fisheries, which are open to the whole maritime population of the Gulf. The principal harbours and anchorages of Laristan, beginning at the east, are :—Qishm, Jazirat, Hangam, Basidu, Harbours.

The chief sea-port of Laristan is Lingeh, the value of the exports and imports at this port amounting in 1904 to £248,956 and £307,690, respec tively, but the greater part of the goods represented by these figures is consigned from or to places beyond the limits of the province, or is tran shipped here to other ports. Much of the sea-borne trade of the province is, however, carried on through Bandar ’Abbas, owing to the superiority of the roads from that port to the interior. The three main lines of communication from the coast to the north are ^ from Lingeh to Yazd via Lar and Darab ; Communications. . t- i .l i i irom Lingeh to Y azd via 4 urg ; and from Mughu bay to Shiraz via Lar ; but there is no great caravan tsaffic over any of these routes. The principal road running east and west is that from Bandar ’Abbas to Bushire, which passes through the centre of the province. Further particulars will be found in Routes in Persia—Vol. III.

There are about 300 families in this tribe, and their Kalantar lives as a rule at Abadeh, which may be considered their chief village or camp. They are celebrated for their predatory habits, but they generally prefer to plunder at a considerable distance from their tents, to which they then retire with their booty. In June 1893 a party of them plundered a large cafavan of camels close under the walls of Yazd, and successfully retreated. They have decided military qualifications, which might be turned to good use. Several of them accompanied Stotherd as escort, and workedin a most business-like manner, their scouting being admirable. Stotherd is of opinion that a useful squadron of irregular horse of about 100 picked men could be raised from them, and that they could be induced to enlist on any side likely to afford them any gain, even against the Persian Government, the authority of which, as it is, has very little hold on them — {Stotherd, 1893.)

LINGEH or LINJEH (District)— A district of the Persian coast, the southernmost within the Persian Gulf, interposed between the Shibkuh district on the west and the Khamir portion of the Bastak district on the east.On the east and south the Lingeh district is bounded by the sea ; on Limita the west by a line which runs inland in a northerly direction from the coast between Ruvvan and Mughu. The northern border is constituted by the great maritime range, described in the article on the Shibkuh district, which, after passing behind Lingeh, terminates in the sea a few miles north of the ^astern end of Qishm Island. Lingeh district has thus a length from west to east of about 40 miles, and its maximum breadth between the mountains and the sea, a little to the west of Lingeh town, is about 25 miles. The island of Siri is attached for administrative purposes to the Lingeh district. The bulk of the district is a plain, slightly elevated about sea-level, of which the centre is occupied by a great salt-marsh called Muhrakun, 20 miles long from west to east and 10 miles in breadth. The plain has, as it were, a raised rim along the sea coast; this rim falls somewhat steeply to the marsh, but on the outer side it declines to the seashore as a barren, sloping glacis. The ordinary height of this barrier between coast and interior is only 200 to 400 feet, but 10 miles north-east of Lingeh town, andinJabal Bustaneh, 10 miles west of the same place, it rises in hills having the respectable elevation of 1,017 and 1,800 feet respectively. With the exception of the highest part of the former, which is of light colour and jagged outline, these two hills present a generally dark and vol canic appearance. The rainfall in the Lingeh district is slight and the climate is cooler, healthier, and pleasanter than that of Bandar ’Abbas. The people of the district are principally Persians and of various tribes, Population. ai _ ld trace their origin to Lar, Galleh- dar and other places in the interior; Arab tribes, however, occur such as the A1 ’ Ali and Marzuqi Who are noticed in the article on the Shibkuh district. Outside the towns of Lingeh and Rung and Ruvvan, which are the principal places in the district and are separately described, the population is almost entirely Sunnis of the Shah’I school. The total population of the Lingeh district, including Lingeh town and Siri island, is probably about 20,000 souls. On the coast pearl-diving, sea-fishing and the carrying trade are the chief occupations, except in Lingeh town where the inhabitants depend mainly on foreign trade. Away from the sea the population is agricultural and pastoral. Dates are the chief crop, and the palms in the Lingeh district are estimated at about 180,000. ~ ' Trade is concentrated in Lingeh town, vide the article in which it is Agriculture and trade and shipping, described This district possesses about 14d vessels of sea-going types and about 222 of smaller size, of the former 57 are pearl boats which cross the Gulf in the season to work on the Arabian side. Supplies, except at the larger places, are not abundant. Water is obtained Supplies and transport. from reservoirs and wdla J the latter , , ^ . are ordinarily from 5 to 8 fathoms m depth. The transport animals of the district may be estimated at not less than 500 camels and 400 donkeys.600 LIN—LIN Lingeh town is connected with Mughh by a coast route passable for all arms, and with Bastak (and so with Routes ' Lar) by aroute which up to the border of the Lingeh district is described as passable for all arms, although its course lies across the salt marsh. The Muhrakun salt marsh, which lies on the latter route, is traversable by animals in summer, but in winter must be either ridden or crossed in boats. There is also a coast route to Khamii, but its character beyond Kung is uncertain and at Pulghar, between 25 and 30 miles from Lingeh town, it certainly becomes impassable at high tide in consequence of the sea rising against the side of the hill. The Lingeh district is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports who A . . . J ,. has his head-quarters at Bushire town : Administration. i • i t , his local representative is a Deputy Governor, very frequently changed, who is responsible for the payment at Bushire of about 150,000 krdns annually as revenue. This revenue is assessed throughout the district upon date-groves and other cultivation— on the coast upon the boats also ; and in Lingeh town warehouses and other places of business are taxed, and men and animals entering the place are laid under contribution by means of tolls. The general administration and collection of land-revenue are conducted by the Deputy-Governor through the Kalantar or headman of Lingeh town and the Katkhudas of villages. Criminal justice there is none, and the only form of civil justice is that dispensed by the ecclesiastical authorities. The power of the Deputy Governor is supported by a military detach ment of 14 infantry and of 6 artillerymen only, with 2 old muzzle-loading smooth-bore guns ; but there are about 200 armed citizens of Lingeh town, who can be called together for the defence of the place in an emergency. The Imperial Persian Customs have an important station in charge of a European at Lingeh, and others of less importance at Bustaneh, Kung, Band Mu’allim and Birkeh Siflin. Their annual receipts are distinct from the general revenue of 130,000 krdns, for which the sub-governor is liable, and amount to about 500,000 brans. Name. Position. Houses and inhabi tants.

Elev. A considerable and impo tant, but at the presen moment declining, town on the Persian coast, the capital of the dis. rict of the same name. It is situated about 96 miles west-soutlnwest of Bandar Abbas, 88 miles north- north-west of Sharjah and a little over 300 miles soul h-east of Bu.hire tdwh ; the British station of Basldti on Qishm island lies about 25 miles ■to the east-north-east of it. Lingeh is a well-built town, better built than Bandar ’Abbas. The town extends about a mile along the shore ; behind it are some date-plantations, and to the north-east is a detached grove about half-way on the road to Kung. The surroundings are extraordinarily arid, and the back ground consists of an absolute desert rising gradually behind the town to a watershed, of which the somewhat prominent hills form the eastern and western extremities. There is an eastern suburb on the sea-face called606 LIN—LIN Gharieh and one of the western quarters of the town is called Lihgieh. On6 of the chief features of the place is a number of birJcehs, or domed cisterns, which are scattered through the environs; these are circular reservoirs, 20 or 30 feet deep, for the storage of *the water which in rainy weather comes down from the desert behind. There is a small dock, suitable for native craft, but it can only be entered at high tide. The dock c n berth some half dozen dhows. The anchorage is in 5 fathoms of water with good holding ground at f mile off-shore; it is exposed to southerly and south-easterly winds which sometimes make communication with the shore impossible, the waves lashing full on the piers and the spray driving inland over the town. At a short distance to the west of the anchorage there is a small pearl-bank 200 yards off shore, in 12 to 20 feet of water. The population at present amounts to 12,000 souls and is of a highly composite character. The basis is Arab and is supposed to consist chi'fly of immigrants from. Trucial ’Oman, but Bahrain has contributed a quota of A1 Bu Samait, ’Utub and Dawasir, and there are also immigrants from Kangan. The remainder are mostly Persians from the neighbourhoods of Bastak and Lar. The medley is completed by a considerable Negro admixture. The majority of the inhabitants are Sunnis or Vahhabls : less than J are ShTahs. The following table will give an idea of the com position of the town :— Arabs 4 . .. .. .. .. •• 5,000souls. Persians Africans Khwajas Hindus Europeans 5,000 1,500 24 16 3 Though'the town is large, its defensive strength is small. Only about one per cent, of the fighting men are credited with the possession of arms, and most of these, it is to be feared, are in undesirable hands. As a rule arms are not produced except on the incitement of Mullas, and then not without the existence of personal interests to be served or the issue of injunctions by the Governor. Lingeh was until recently a trade-emporium serving a large and impor tant area. As a general centre for the collection and export of pearls it rivalled even Bahrain. As a point for the distribution of foreign goods, not only the adjacent districts of Persia but also the ports of Trucial’Oman and Qatr, and even, to some extent, those of the Batinah coast of ’Oman and of Bahrain were numbered among its clients. But the rigorous regime of the reformed Persian Customs has set a term., at least for the present, to its prosperity; and the towns of Trucial ’Oman, formerly among its leading constituents, are now turning to Dibai, which the establishment of direct steam-com munication with India and the absence of official harassments have at length enabled to compete with Lingeh upon favourable terms. It is estimated that goods imported direct at Dibai can be sold there 10 per cent, cheaper than similar goods imported through Lingeh. To save themselves from utter ruin most of the leading merchants of Lingeh have established agencies in Trucial ’Oman, by means of which they hope to retain a part of their former business.LIN—LIN 607 *1 * icl It seems probable that unless the Persian Government take steps to remove the causes of this decline, Lingeh will shortly be reduced to the posi tion of a merely local port. The tract of which the trade is naturally depend ent on Lingeh, lies to the north-west of it, including Bastak and Lar and not extending beyond Jehrum, a distance of little over 150 miles. The actual number of shops in Lingeh is 445 and of other business premises 28 ; about 250 of the shops sell cloth and 250 provisions. Exports from Lingeh by sea consist of carpets, rose-buds, flax-seed, tobacco, gum-tragacanth, gum-arabic, asafoetida and a little dried fruit from Jehrum, Ishkanan, Taraikmeh and Gallehdar : they are shipped chiefly to Indian and Turkish ports, but some of the asafoetida, gum-tragacanth and gum-arabic goes direct to the United Kingdom. Mother-of-pearl shells are despatched to London and Hamburg as well as to India. Imports, except a certain quantity of piece-goods which is received direct from England and Germany, are all from India ; the principal are rice, wheat, barley, ghi, sugar, loaf-sugar, sugar-candy, spices, linen, silk and cloth of all sorts. The carrying trade of Lingeh, in the past considerable, is not unlikely to fall off in the future in sympathy with the general export and import business. At the present time 2 sailing barques, 19 baghlahs and 14 ghunchaks and sambuqs belong to the port, besides 22 light 3rs ; the last are sambuqs, baqdreqs and jolly-boats. This local shipping affords employment to about 740 persons. Th 3 principal resource of Lingeh, apart from commerce and navigation, is the pearl-fishery : there are about 30 pearl-boats of size (sambuqs, bafils Occupations other than and baqdrehs). The sea-fisheries are of some trade. value and employ 10 baqdrehs, 17 shu’ais, and 20 bans and varjis. Date-culture is of some importance, but other cultivation is insignificant, in consequecne of the paucity of the means of irrigation. There are some mechanics and artisans and Lingch is said to be the best place in the Gulf to have ironwork made or necessary repairs to ships executed, though the workmanship is rude. The standard of weight is a local man, equal to 9 lbs. English, and the standard of length a zar’ of 38 English inches. The currency is that of Persia, but the Indian rupee, Maria Theresa dollar, Turkish lira, and English sovereign also circulate. Land communications and land transport are dealt with in the article on Lingeh district, and the nature of the sea-communications may Communications, trans- be gauged by the remarks on shipping above, port and supplies. The water of Lingeh is generally abundant, and cattle poultry, vegetables, rice, flour and firewood are available in some quantity. The water from wells is brackish, and for drinking purposes the water from birkehs is almost exclusively used. The birkehs appear to have a capacity of 6,000 gallons each, but at times are nearly empty. Lingeh, as one of the Gulf Ports, is subject to the Governor of that . . . . division, but is administered by a local Deputy Governor. The nature of his administration is described in the article on Lingeh district. The Imperial Persian Customs608 LIN—LIR have a post here, and there is a small Persian garrison, as already mentioned in the article on Lingeh district; besides these about 200 armed citizens can be mustered by order ot the Deputy Governor, for the defence of the town.— (Craufurd, 1910.) A British Vice-Consul was appointed to Lingeh in 1910. The Consulate is a Persian house on the outskirts of the town, and is practically inde fensible against any organized attack.— (Lorimer, 1906.) LINJAN— One of the nine buluks of the province of Isfahan ; it extends on both sides of the Zindeh Rud as far as the frontier of Chehar Mahal, 50 miles west of Isfahan. It is 7 miles long and 40 miles in width, and is well- watered by the river or canals from it. It is divided into upper and lower Linjan by the Gav PIseh pass. There are computed to be 300 to 400 vil lages in the district, which, for Persia, is fairly populous. Villages situated on the rivers are called Cham. The district is fertile, growing melons celebrated throughout P.ersia ; it supplies the whole of Central Persia with rice. It is sub-divided into the following 5 parishes, Linjalanj, Gargan, Ushturjan, Ashian and Ai Dughmish.— {Schindler.) LlltAVl (District)— The only coast district of the Behbehan province of Pars. It sepa rates the ’ Arabistan district of Hindian from the Gulf Ports district of Haiat Daud. Limdts. —Liravi extends along the Persian Gulf from a point about 7 miles north of Bandar Dilam to Sabz Pushan 31 miles south-south-east of that place, and is bounded inland by a low, maritime range which, at the northern end of the district, is about 6, and at the south end about 18 miles from the sea : this range rises, behind Bandar Dilam, to a height of about 1,000 feet. Physical characteristics.' —The principal points on the coast are Ras-ut- Tanb or Tanub, 8 miles south of Bandar Dilam, a low, sandy point; Khur Lailatain, a small creek 1 mile south-east of Ras-ut-Tanb ; Khur &gt;Sini, an other small creek with deep water inside, Smiles south-south-east of Khur Lailatain finally Sabz Pushan, a slightly projecting, rocky point which has a small water-course on the south of it, and is itself 18 miles south-south-east of Khur Sini. The most striking object in the interior of the district is Jabal Bang, or Kuh-i-Bang, an isolated group of hills rising to a point 1,000 feet high, at a distance of 24 miles south-south-east from Bandar Dilam and 3 miles from the coast; these hills stretch for 12 miles paiallel to the coast, are precipitous on the seaward side and contain salt and gypsum. Apart from Jabal Bang and the hills which form the inland boundary, the whole district is low and consists of plains, sometimes grassy, with occasional exposures of light-grey sandstone. The heat of summer is, it is said, not excessive ; and the winter resembles that of Bushire. Water everywhere is from wells. The Liravi coast south of Bas-ut-Tanb can ordinarily be approached to within 1 mile by vessels of moderate size. Population. —The fixed inhabitants of Liravi are of mixed Lur and Arab blood, and do not fall under any well-known tribal denominations. Their number is probably about 6,000 souls, inclusive of the inhabitants of BandarLIR-LU 609 Dilam (q.v.) and its dependent villages. The people are all Shi’ahs unless, as is reported, there are a few Babls at Shahr Viran. They are quiet and free from fanaticism and engaged for the most part in agriculture or sea-faring occupations. Martini rifles are numerous, there being, it is said, three rifles on the average to every two houses. Dwellings outside of Bandar Dilam are nearly all huts. During the six winter months the district is visited by th3 Daren Shull and Kashkull, llidt nomadic hill tribes whose summer quarters are in the mountainous locality Blbi Hakimeh, 30. or 40 miles inland from the coast. „ Agriculture and. Trade. —Wheat, barley, dates and tobacco are the chief' products, and of the first two a certain surplus is ordinarily available for export. Cattle, sheep and goats are fairly numerous. The exports and imports are those described in the article on Bandar Dilam. There iss no internal trade. Currency, weights and measures are the same as those, of Bandar Dilam, except the gaz or yard which is 2 inches, less, thanj that of Bushire. Transport and Communications .—Blravi is believed to possess about 200 horses, 100 camels and 2,000 donkeys. The best known route is one which: traverses the districts longitudinally from Shahr Viran to Kunarku, at some distance from tho coast; the marching by this is easy and there are numerous convenient halting-places. Administration.-r-The district is ruled by a Khan named Hji Hasan, who has. his residence at the village of Chah Tahl and is subordinate to the Governor of Behbehan. He is said to have obtained recognition by the disbursement to Persian officials of part of. the wealth which he accu mulated 30 or 40 years ago when he was a robber in the hills, plunderincr caravans between Bandar Dilam and Behbehan and raiding the settled vil lages of Liravi. There are no Persian officials in his territory and he manages the villages through their Kadkhudds or headmen. The Khan, is now about 85, years of age and has seven sons, one of whom resides at Hisar as his father’s deputy. Land-revenue appears to be collected only on actual cultivation at the rate of 20 to 60 Jcrdns per gdv (the amount of land that a yoke of oxen can plough in a day ).—Persian Gulf' Gazetteer, 1908 — Chick, 1909.)

LUR-I-BUZURG— see LURISTAN. LUR-I-KUCHAK —see LURISTAN. LURISTAN— Forming one of its western boundaries with Turkish Arabia, it shares with Ardalan the distinction of being the most mountainous province of Persia. Locally, the term Luristan, has not the wide significance attached to it by some geographers ; and its use is restricted to indicate the territory nominally under the administration of-the Governor of Luristan. But as * * t «such a description would place the region of Pusht-i-Kfth outside of its limits, for the sake of convenience, as well as the close ties which knit that district to the Pish Kuh&gt; it is preferable to consider the two regions as a whole*. Boundaries. —In this sense therefore its boundaries may be read as fol lows :—On the north it marches with the province of Kirmanshah from a point some 35 miles south of Khaniqin, more or less identical with the 34° of latitude, until it makes a bend south-eastwards to Hulllan and crosses the Kara Su river. Thence it strikes north-eastwards along the left bank of that river until its junction with the Gam Aslab, and works up the left bank of the latter stream, until it strikes the rugged mountain range which divides the district of Khava from the valley of Nihavand and later that of Silakhur. On the east its boundary is the latter valley, the district of Faridan and the Bakhtifrl country. On the south it is again the Bakh- tiari country, the Ab-i-D:z, and the plains of Northern ’ Arabistan. Finally, on the west its boundary from Mazra’-i-Salihabad, 10 miles north west of Dizful, is conterminous with the undemarcated Turco-Persian frontier ; which may be said to run along the foot of the Hamrin moun tains, flanking the plain on which are found the tents of the Bani Lam, and beyond the great waterway of the Tigris, as far as Mandall, and thence northward to meet the 34° of latitude once more. Physical Geography.—By this definition of its boundaries, it is observed that the territory ruled over by the Bakhtiari Khan is cons dered outside the limits of this province : and warrants the discarding of such distinctions as Lur-i-Buzurg (Bakhtiari) and Lur-i-Kuchak (Luri'stan), which still, however, have their local significance. Luristan, as above defined, is divided into two districts. That portion to the south and west of the lofty range of the Kabir Kuh is known as Pusht-i-Kuh : while the regions to the north and east of this range, which, as far as it is affected by the jurisdiction of the Persian Governor may be taken to represent Luristan proper, is known as Pish Kuh. Mountains and valleys. —Both districts are a mass of, for the most part, lofty and rugged mountain ranges running in parallel lines in a south-east erly direction : with a superficial area of some 19,500 square miles. The ancient title of Zagros was, it would seem, applicable to at least the whole of this mountainous tract, rather than to any particular one of its ranges : and may even have included the length and breadth of the mountainous country between Urumieh and ’Arabistan. The mountain ranges of this province, the highest peaks of which are perpetually snowclad, reach ing to an elevation of some 15,000 feet above sea-level, are interspersed with fertile valleys, which are well watered’and possess a generous soil. In them considerable crops of wheat and barley are raised, and they afford excellent pasture lands for sheep and cattle. Pasture lands and plains. —To the south-west, on the lower slopes of the mountains, are found the principal grazing-grounds merging with the plains of Northern ’Arabistan to the west of the Ab-i-Diz ; while the only plains of any extent within the true boundaries of Luristan are those of Sllakhffr, Alishtar and Khurramabad. The first named, which is a broad valley rather than a plain, extends from the town of Burujird in a south-easterly 4 H 2612 LUR—LUR direction for some 35 miles and has a breadth varying from 5 to 10 miles : that of Alishtar has a length arid depth of some 12 miles : while the plain of Khurramabad is some 16 miles in length, with a depth of about 8 miles. Woodlands and vp gelation.—poking comparatively, the province of Luristan is extremely well-wooded, more particularly on the east, in the country of the tribes of the Bala Girieh. Oak trees, and in certain tracts its evergreen species, abound ; these, as well as other species, grow to a good size on the eastern border, and become more stunted and dwarfed towards the west. Other kinds of trees are the ash, plane, elm, poplar, willow, beech and the walnut, found in profusion to the north and north-east; as well as all kinds of fruit trees, such as apple, peach, apricot, cherry, the pome* granate and the vine. But timber is little respected by the Burs, who cut it down remorselessly and without any regard for the future. One of the principal sources of livelihood of the nomad tribesmen is from the burning of charcoal for which they require the wood, as well as for fuel. Their woodlands also furnish them with considerable quantities of the Astralcujus species, from which they obtain a large amount of the valuable gum-traga* canth. Rivers .—Through the deep valley s formed by the often precipitous cliffs of the great mountain masses of limestone, and frequently cutting through them at right angles, numerous rivers and streams force their way. The only two of any real importance are the Karkheh and the Ab-i-Diz ; as they absorb most of the larger streams, which otherwise might claim some distinctive description of their own. The Karkheh has its earliest origin in the waters of the Kara Su and the Gam Aslab, both of which streams rise without the limits of Lurist an itself. It chief tributaries, in order from the north, are the Ab-i-Dinavar to the Gam Aslab before its junction with the Kara Su ; and afterwards the Sar-i-Ab NIaz, the Ab-i-Chanareh, the Kashgar or MudianRud, andthe Ab-i-Zal. For a considerable part of its course, and up to the point of its junction with the Ab-i-Zal, it is known as the Saimcrreh river, and only after that point does it become the Kar kheh. For a full description of &gt; his river, vide this Gazetteer. The earliest source of the Ab-i-Diz is not far removed from the Gam Asiab branch of the Karkheh ; this is the Ab-i-Darreh, which rises in the neighbourhood of Nihavand. Its principal tributaries are the Kamand Ab in the Sllakbur •valley, the Qir Ab or Bala Bud, andthe Ab-i-Sabz. By the time it reaches Dizftil it has become a fine river, with a breadth in flood'time of a quarter of mile, and st ill carrying a fair volume of water in the dry season. But neither the DA nor the Karkheh is navigable by the smallest boats, at any part within the limits of Luristan. For a full description of the Ab-i- Diz, vide this Gazetteer. Tows and villages .—Khurramabad is the only place within the true limits of Luristan which has any pretensions to be called a town : and it is the residence of the Governor of Luristan. It has a fixed population of some thing under 10,0C0 souls. The town is situated in almost the centre of the Pi h Kuk district, and commands the passes by which the principal. tribes of Luristar ere oblig(d to cross when moving between their summer and winter quarters. The two important passes are the Tang-i-Zagheh (to tie east) and the Tang-i-Robat (to the north) ; and were not the town *situated as it is, it would be very difficult to retain any control on these tribes. In order to protect the town and surrounding villages, the Persian Grovernment establishes a military camp every year at the foot of these passes at the time of the passage of the tribes. For a full description of Khurramabad. vide this Gazetteer. Burujird, which is situated at the head of the Silakhur valley, and is the chief town of the district of the same name, supplies Luristan with the greater portion of its dry goods, such as cotton and woollen materials, glassware, lamps, cutlery, footwear, leather, etc.; and should not be left entirely out of notice in a description of this province. And, in the same connection, mention must be made of Dizful ; which would doubtless supply the wants of the province to a much greater extent and on far better terms than does Burujird at the present time, but for the unfortunate state of the country towards its southern limits, which precludes the entry of any caravans from that direction. In regard to the villages of Luristan, beyond the few hamlets in the im mediate neighbourhood of Khurramabad and those mentioned in the detailed notices of the various tribes below, they are hardly worthy of con sideration. There is practically no settled population in Luristan: nearly the whole of it living in their black goat’s-hair tents, with which they wander unceasingly oVer their recognised tribal grazing-grounds. Climate .—The climate of Luristan, owing to the great differences in elevation, varies considerably; and, as in the adjoining Bakhtiari country, its inhabitants can accommodate themselves almost according to their inclination. During most months of the year the climate is one generally of a temperate zone, tempered by a somewhat excessive cold in the higher altitudes in midwinter and severe heat in the lower valleys in mid-summer. But the latter are practically deserted at this peried ; while the greater number of the lliats (nomads) abandon in the winter time the higher ground (their yailaqs or summer quarters), for the plains of Silakhur or Dizful, which constitute their qishldq or winter quarters. Language.—In general terms the language of Luristan may be said to be Persian, tempered by the Lur, dialect. This is a mixture of Persian and Arabic, the result of the close connection with the many Arab tribes that overlap or encroach upon this region. The most notable divergences from modern Persian are found in the Laki dialects spoken by some of the Dilfan tribes. Kawlinson says that the language of the Lurs is from the old Farsi, which was coeval with, but distinct from, the Pehlvi tongue in the time of the Sassanian kings. Ethnology and History .—Who are the Lurs and whence they came is one of the unsolved riddles of history. They appear to belong to the same ethnical group as the Kurds, their neighbours to the north : though they consider it an insult to be confounded with them, and call them Leks. Most writers agree that they are of aboriginal, old Aryan, or Iranian stock, who preceded Arabs, Turks and Tartars^ in the land : and that they have lived for centuries in their present habitat. The expression Lur is used614 LUR—LUR 4 by modem Persians as a synonym for a rude or depredatory person, while the word ‘ Fail! ’ means a rebel. The Lurs maj be conveniently classified under four heads, thus (1) Faili Lurs, indicating the servants or followers of the Vali of Pusht-i- Kuh, the first of whom rebelled against his master, as noted below* (ii) The Lurs of Pish Kuh. (iii) The Bakhtiari, vide this Gazetteer. (iv) Other sections of Lurs, who have wandered farther afield, such as the Mamassani and Kuhgalu tribes. Between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries the province of Luristatl was ruled by a race of independent princes, who were called Atabegs, The last prince of this race was Shah Vardi Khan, who rebelled against Shah ’Abbas, early in the seventeenth century: and, on the arrival of the latter at Khurramabad to punish him, fled to the Pusht-i-Kuh. Later, when Shah ’Abbas pushed forward to Saimarreh, Shah Vardi Khan retreated to Jangileh, the qishlaq ot the present Vali, and there later lost his life after much fighting. On his return to Khurramabad, Shah ’Abbas appointed one Husain Khan, a servant of the dead Vali and a traitor to him, as VaH of Pusht-i-Kuh ; but retained the Pish Kuh district under the direct management of a Persian Governor, with the seat of government at Khur* ramabad. This arrangement has obtained ever since with a varying degree of authority as far as the latter is concerned. This division of the country was the occasion for the importation into the province of a foreign tribe of some distinction. This was the Silsileh or Saisalih (Saiyid Salih). On his appointment as Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, Husain Khan pointed out to his royal benefactor that, owing to the many enemies against whom he would have to contend, it would be impossible for him to preserve order without the assistance of foreign mercenaries. To aid him, there* fore, the Silsileh tribe was drafted from the Mahi Dasht district of the Kirmanshah province into Luristan, and it was arranged that they, in con* junction with the Dilfan tribe, should supply Husain Khan yearly with one hundred horsemen. Up to the end of the reign of Nadir Shah, these two tribes remained the dependents of the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh ; but, with the upheaval which followed on the death of that monarch, they appropriated those lands on which they were located and became semi-independent like their neighbours, or at least only responsible thereafter to the authority of the Persian Governor. Tribal Divisions : Pish Kuh .—The district of Pish Kuh, or the province of Luristan proper, is divided up into four principal tribes, with numerous 8ub-divisionS‘. They are the Silsileh, the Dilfan, the Bala Girieh and the Tihran. These divisions have no single chief like the Bakhtiari; and more often than not they are engaged in hostilities against one another. They are notorious for their plundering propensities, particularly the Silsileh and the Dilfan. Silsileh .—The habitat of this tribe is to the north of Khurramabad. They are of Arab origin and the circumstances under which they became incorporated with the Lurs are explained above. They occupy the plain of iUishtar, whose ancient name was Alishakar, and the adjoining country. The plain itself is highly cultivated and productive of rice and opium in 4 4 4■ 1 r LUR-LUR 615 'onsiderable quantities ; it has a superficial area of some 150 square miles. The Silsileh have three important sub-divisions: the Hasan wand, the Yusufwand and the Quliwand, with a fourth, since become merged into the two former, known as the Amirwand. The Hasanwand are settled to the east of the Alishtar plain; and their lands are irrigated by the waters of the Sar-i-Ab-i-Khaman, and Sar-i-Ab-i-Narm or Zag, and Sar-i-Ab-i-’Amarat. The two first named streams also water the country of the Bairanawand later on in their courses. Some families of the Hasanwand are located within 12 miles of Khurramabad mar Saileh Burjeh and Sar-i-Ab-i-Talkh ; and even come into the town itself in the winter months. Various estimates are given of their numbers, as of their fighting strength, which may be taken to be some 4,200 tents of about 6,000 souls, with perhaps 3,000 men capable of bearing arms. They are divided into three sections or families, each under a chief as follows :— Family— Malik Ju Sultan Fabhajan. ’AlI Khan. Khuda Yak. Malik ’Ali Khan. Haji Khairullah. ’Abdul ’AH. Musa Khan. Mara Kh5n. Husain Khan. I ' I I Sarhang Mhsa Khan. Daud Khan. SamahdT Khan. Mihr ’AH Khan. Khaz Khanum. (Married to Fazil Khan Sagwand.) For their qishldq, or winter quarters, vide tabulated statement below. The Yusufwand occupy the centre of the Alishtar plain between the Hasanwand and Qulivand ; their lands which are the most luxuriant in this district, being irrigated by the Sar-i-Ab-i-Khaman, the Sar-i-Ab-i- Chanareh, the Sar-i-Ab-i-Varmazmar and the Sar-i-Ab-i-Mumin. Formerly there were many fruit gardens on the banks of these streams, but these are now mostly out of cultivation. Most of the trees in the locality are walnut. This tribe formerly were reckoned at 2,000 tents, but many of them have emigrated to the Alvand of Hamadan and to the villages of Malair, north of Burujird, and their numbers are now computed to be some 1,500 tents or 5,000 souls. Their principal chief (1905) is Riza Khan. Yor the qishldq of this tribe, vide tabulated statement below. The Quliwand occupy the country contiguous to the Alishtar plain on three sides, the north, west and south ; their lands being irrigated by the Sar-i-Ab-i-Sakki Samarieh, the Sar-i-Ab-i-Kalamkabad, the Sar-i-Ab-i- Mibu, the Tamartuz-i-Zindeh Rud. The Quliwand are sub-divided into three i616 LtIR—LUR considerable branches, called the Murshid, the Falak-ud-Din and the Karim ’AH. The Murshid are located in the country south of the Alishtar plain ; the Falak-ud-Din inhabit Khava and the higher regions north of the Alishtar plain ; while the Karim ’AH are located on the mountain slopes between the two. For some years past they have lived a quiet and comparatively sedentary life in the villages and gardens which they have built and have laid out ; sel dom troubling themselves to move to their qishldqs or winter quarters. These are in the Samarreh valley which is between 80 and 100 miles distant to the south-west, and to reach which they have to traverse the territory of the Tihran. The Quliwand are credited with a total of some 3,700 tents or 15,000 souls amongst their several branches. They are also accounted to be the fools of Luristan and many amusing stories are told of their simplicity and stupidity. Their principal chiefs are Husain Quli Khan, Mai Khan, Manushi Khan and Jani Khan. Dilfdn .—Like the Silsileh, the Dilfan are of Arab origin. They are the descendants of the Abu Dalf, who, being near neighbours, encroached by degrees into Persian territory and became merged into its people, and they have now become the most powerful confederacy in Luristan. Their habita tions march with and overlap the lands of the Silsileh to an extent not easily determinable, though they may be generally described as lying within the Khava district. This district has a pleasanter and more temperate climate than that of Alishtar, and is watered by many good streams and springs. Thus the Sar-i-Ab-i-NIaz, which later waters the fields of the Falak-ud- Din, flows through the Tang-i-Badavaz by a westerly course. It is joined before entering this gorge by the Tirud, a stream coming from the direction of Harsin ; their joint waters later flowing into the Samarreh near Zardalal. Every spring in Khava has a plantation of willows about it. There are three important tribes among the Dilfan ; the Kakawand, the Itiawand, and the Mumianwand, which are in turn sub-divided into many branches. The general character of these tribes is nomadic, but their territory is m n e or less continuous, so that their migrations are a different affair to those of a tribe like the Sagwand. They are at present united under the strong and capable rule of the Fath-i-Sultan, Nazar ’AH Khan, of the Amrai tribe. The following family tree may be of interest in this connection :—• Nrsns. Barkhuda Khan. Habibullah Khan. Fathullah Khan. Nazir ’AH Khan, Ja’afar Quli Khan, Qasirn. Bahar Khan. Fath-us-Sultan 1 Sartip. {Died.) A aon.LUR—LUR 617 The Fath-us-Sultan fought for six or seven years for the supremacy with Qasim Khan, the struggle only being terminated by the death of the latter, and the acceptance of the supremacy of the Fath-us-Sultan by his dead rival relatives. Various and widely different estimates (1904) have been made of the fighting strength of this tribe, and it has been put as high as 18,000 to 28,000 men , while it is also stated on equally good authority to be 1,500 sowars and 1,500 tufangchis. It may be taken that the first estimate is excessive, and the more probably correct numbers are 2 000 tents or 10,000 souls. The Kalcawand occupy the mountain ranges flanking the valley of Niha- vand, while their lands run westward and norhwards towards Harsin and Sehura and southwards with certain interruptions as far as Hulilan, on the Kara Su river, where they have their qishldqs. They obtain their livelihood from cultivation and their considerable flocks. Their number have been estimated at 2,000 tents, or 10,000 souls in all. They are sub-divided into a number of small divisions ; the principal of which are the Tajinawand or Aulad Taj, Muzaffarwand, Barikwand, Aulad’All Mikailwand, Valadhand, Ghaib Ghulam, Ghaibghum or Aulad Ghaib, Zaid, Bahram and Khiwand! But the tribe generally is Becoming gradually dispersed, many families goings to Khazal of Nihavand and to Kirmanshah. The Itiawand are the neighbours of the Kakawand still farther to the south- east, and inhabit the localities known as Duliskan, Kangavari and Sarkashti; the last-named being a spur of the Safid Kuh. Owing to, the high elevation upon which their habitations are fixed, they enjoy a most temperate climate, m midsummer, as well as all the fruits of such a climate, and which are, further, of excellent quality. Their lands are also well-wooded and afford luxuriant pasturage for their flocks. Their qishldq, or winter quarters, near Hulilan, run into what is now reckoned to be within the jurisdiotion of the province of Kirmanshah. The estimated number of this tribe was 4,000 tents, but of these only some 1,500 remain at the present day, the re mainder having become merged with inhabitants of Kirmanshah or migrated to Kangavar or Khazal. The Itiawand are sub-divided into numerous branches, formerly reckoned at 18 ; but of these there only remain at the present _time (1905) the Aulad Qubad, the Dastnawand, the Aulad Salih, the Aulad Murad, the Taliwand and the Khalawand. The most important by far of these divisions is the Aulad Qubad, who number some 4,000 souls and furnish a company for the Amrai regiment. The. Mumdwand inhabit the lands between and to the east of the Itiawand and Kakawand, extending as far east as the Silakhur valley. Their country consists of lofty mountains with elevated valleys, well watered by many streams from which they reap a plentiful harvest of wheat and barley. The mountain slopes are well-wooded and from these they obtain consider able quantities of charcoal besides collecting gum-tragacanth, for which they find a ready sale. In their ydildqs ot winter quarters in the neighbour hood of the Madian Riid, distant some 55 miles to the south, they aiso grow a certain amount of opium. Their numbers are estimated at some 3,700 tents or about 15,000 souls. They are sub-divided into two branches, known as the K ait id K ur AH and the Mirabegi. The prefix Kaitul signifies in the Lu’ dialect a servant. Half their tribe enjoys this privilege, namely, 1121. Ik ’ , r618 LUR—LUR tnat of being considered servants of the Khans, which exempts them from paying taxes other than those presumably drawn by the Khans themselves. The Kaitul Nfir’Ali have their tents in the high mountains south of Nihawand and bordering on that valley, while the Mirabegi are farther east towards the Silakhur plain. For the qishldq of this tribe see the tabulated statement below. Other divisions of the Dilfan, which are not shown in the state ment, are the Razawand and Bijinawand. These tribes are mentioned by Layard and Rawlinson as having their tents respectively in Khava and Harassan : but they have either ceased to exist or have dwindled in import ance to an extent to make them hardly worthy of mention in the present day. The Ainehwand are mentioned by Genera,! Schindler, as being a branch of the Dilfan and as consisting of some 80 families inhabiting the TakhVi-Pari. Bald Girleh .—This confederation, consisting of at least eight important tribes, which are in turn split up into many sub-divisions, inhabit the track known as Bala Girdnud, to the east of Khurramabad, stretching from the Silakhur valley as far as the southern limits of the province to the north of Dizful. Numerically the strongest of the four.principal divisions of the Lurs, if united in common cause, they would undoubtedly ob tain a supremacy over the rest without much difficulty. But their general policy is not of a very advanced type, and its striking features are a more or less unremitting feud on the part of some of its branches with the Persian Government, general acts of hostility against each other, and strained re lations with the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh. They are united under no one ruling chief, neither have their own particular chiefs effective control over the tribesmen in some of its branches. The principal tribes of the Bala Girieh are the Kaid Rahmat, the Dalwand, the Bairanawand, the Sagwand, the TulabI, the Papi,the Judakf, the Dirakwand ; while other independent but smaller branches are the Gurz Gurzi, the Gallandar, the Rumiani and the Ruh Ruk. The Raid Rahmat inhabit a tract to the south and east of Burujird, stretching across the Silakhur valley and including spurs of the Shahr- ab and Gurin mountains ; their limit on the east being the Sazar which forms in part the boundary of the Bakhtiari country. They have rich lands which are well cultivated and watered by the Ab-i-Huru, a tribu tary of the-Kashgan river, which separates their country to the south from the Dalwand. They own many flourishing villages, so that a great part of their population may be counted as Deli Nishins, or those who do not migrate to winter quarters. Besides cultivation, they rely on the collection of gum-tragacanth and charcoal burning as sources of liveli hood. They were formerly estimated at 1,500 families which in later years have become much dispersed amongst the villages of Silakhur, so that now their numbers are not reckoned at over 300 families of some 1,000 souls. For their ydildqs, vide tabulated statement below. The Dalwand occupy Zagheh, about 25 miles due east of Khurramabad, and its neighbourhood : their northern limits being conterminous with the southern boundaries of the Kaid Rahmat. They own good lands Vfith ample water on which they have every kind of cultivation except413 . um-Lim 619 rice. Apart from the produce of their fields, they derive a good income from the sale of gum-tragacanth and charcoal. They are in great part Beh Nishins who do not migrate to winter quarters. The village of Zagheh is on the main caravan route and is of some size and importance. This tribe is reckoned at 1,000 families with a total of 5,000 souls. For their qishldqs vide tabulated statement below. The Bairanaivand inhabit the country to the west of the two last-named tribes, between them and the plain of Alishtar. The superficial area of their ydildq, or summer quarters, is reckoned at some thing over 2,000 square miles. They own rich lands and many good villages besides being well armed. They are numerically the strongest tribe of Luristan : their numbers being estimated at some 7,000 families or 25,000 souls. While many families have joined them from other tribes, they have in turn lost others who have settled in Burujird or Silakhur. They have the reputation of being amongst the most turbulent and unruly of the tribes of Luristan. The tribe generally has a very bad name and their chiefs are spoken of as uncivilised even in Luristan. In the time of Nadir Shah they were removed en bloc to Shiraz : but escaped and returned to Luristan. The qishldq of this tribe is at Kilab or in the Pusht-i-Kuh dis trict : the latter, which are on the borders of the Turkish frontier, they only visit after obtaining assurances of safety from the intervening tribes men. The Bairanawand are divided into fifteen sub-divisions, vide tab ulated satement below. The two principal chiefs of the tribe are Ma Rahim Khan and Quli Khan, between whom enmity exists. The former is on good terms with the Fath-us-Sultan (head of the Dilfan) who has endeavoured to reconcile the two. The Sagwand occupy the country to the south-east of and in the near neighbourhood of Khurramabad, and contiguous to the lands of the Dal- wand to the north. Their most important and productive tract is ’Arabistan. The climate of this region is temperate, except for a few months in the winter. In the spring they pour into the plains of Dizful advancing as far south as Shush. In doing this they usually give a wide berth to the Dirakwand ; in whom they have but scant trust. If the Governor at Khur ramabad is hostile, they not infrequently remain in the low hill country of eastern Pusht-I-Kuh for the summer. Besides cultivated lands they own large herds and flocks. The Sagwand are of Arab extraction and came into Luris tan some 150 years ago. Karim Khan Zand endeavoured to transfer them to Shiraz, but after a short stay in that place they escaped and returned to Luristan. The tribe itself at that time was insignificant and was without lands : but in course of time they murdered the chiefs of the Said, Makan ’AH and Tulabi tribes and annexed their properties. Thus the land taxes they now pay are those of the tribes they overpowered. They have been joined by many families from the PapI, Lurl, Mumianwand, Quliwand, Hasanwand and Tihran tribes and now number 3,000 families or about 10,000 souls. They are sub-divided into many branches, vide tabulated statement below. A small and distinct branch, known as Gallehdar is permanently settled on the plains to the west of the Ab-i-Diz. Their fighting strength is reckoned to be greater than that of any other Lur tribe620 LUR—LUR and is said to be 20,000 sowars, of whom half are armed with rifles. Their Khans and chiefs are influential. In this connection the following table will be of interest :— Rahim Khan. ’AH Khan. (Married sister of Muzaffar-ul-Mulk.) ’Aziz Ullah. {Died.) Gidan Khan. {Died.) (Married daughter of Kurd Sardar, follower of Vail of Pusht-i-Kiih.) Salar. {Died.) Agha Riza. Married— (1) Bairanaw and wife. (2) Sag wand Karim Khan or (Khazal Khan ?) Fazal Khan. (Married daughter of Samahdi Khan, Hasan and.) ’All Murad Khan. Jamshid Khan, by No. 1. Hasan Gidau Khan. Husain Khan. Khanjan Khan (No issue.) Two sons (young). Daughter betrothed to son of Saiyid Muhammad Husain, Chief Mujtahid of Dizful. Mehr ’Ali Khan. I Daughter. (Married to son of Muzaf far-ul-Mulk.) The two important sub-divisions of the Sagwand were formerly the Rahim Khan and ’AH Khan, but these divisions are now beginning to lose their application. Over one section of the former Fazil Khan, when present, presides : and in his absence the leadership devolves on his nephews Hasan Gidau and Khanjan Khan. Over the second section Agha Riza presides, with whom is associated Karim or Khazal Khan. This section is certainly inferior to, and possibly half that of, the other. The ’Ali Khan are comparatively few in numbers, and since the overthrow of their leader Mihr ’Ali Khan by Hasan and Khanjan Khans their followers have joined Rahim Khan. i'he Tnlabl occupy the villages to the south of and in the plain on Khurramabad. They are chiefly located on a mountain called Samakh, which is close to the Chigini and near the Ab-i-Kashgan. It is abundantly covered with sumach trees and is the haunt of much horned game, especially the621 n LUR—LUR maral deer. This tribe is reckoned at some 300 families, or 1,000 souls in all : and they supply 100 men for the Amrai regiment. The Pdpi occupy lands bordering on those of the Sagwand to the south east of Khurramabad, as far as the Sazar river. They have very little land undec cultivation and subsist chiefly by their flocks and herds. Within their limits is a notable imdmzddeh, that of Shahzadeh Imam, son of Imam Musa Kazim and brother of Imam Riza, to which the Lurs pay great respect and which makes them the recipients of many gifts and endowments. About 200 families are attached to this imdmzddeh with the privilege of r immunity from all taxation and freedom from oppression. They formerly numbered some 4,000 families, most of which, with their lands, had accrued to them by their overthrow of the Rashml tribe, but in course of years they have become scattered and the present estimate given is 800 families, or about 3 000 souls. The Judaki occupy the country to the south of Khurramabad and of the road to Dizful, commencing from the Shurab, 12 miles south of Khurramabad, as far as the Ka Gilan Pass, a distance of some 55 miles. Although their lands are situated in the garmsirs, the climate is still pleasant in the hot months owing to the considerable forests which cover it. They cultivate a sufficiency of ground for their wants, though the poorer members of the tribe live on acorn bread. They are practically little more than a section of Dirakwand, the northerly part of whose land they occupy in a somewhat uncertain tenure. No love is lost between them and the Dirakwand and they would gladly sever the connection were they ever strong enough to avert their neighbours’ resentment. They were formerly reckoned at 2,000 families, but they have diminished of late years and are now said to have 800 families, or a total of 3,500 souls. Their, chiefs, Path Ullah Khan and ’Abbas Khan appear to be on good terms with Hasan and Khanjan Khan of the Sagwand. The Dirakwand are located to the south-east of the Judaki, their limits on the north being the plain of Khurramabad, about 20 miles south of the town; on the east the Papi tribe interposes between them and the Ab-i-Piz ; on the south they are conterminous with the hills between Kaleh Qasim and the Pul-i-Zal, and on the west they are bounded by the Judaki. They inhabit a mountainous tract difficult of access, the principal mountains or peaks in it being those of Takmani, Chuani, Kulrud, Kurreh Khapusht, Kuzkaveh, Gurgi, Mangareh and Gialan. The mountains of Kuzkaveh form the spot from which legend says Faraidun and the blacksmith Khava started on the expedition against Zuhak. The Vali, ’AH Mardan Khan, had some buildings and also a windmill erected on the summit of the mountains. At Gurgi and Mangareh there are many gardens with tanks of various strange shapes. On the mountains of Gurgi there are remains of domes built of stone and plaster, which denote that the district was once inhabited. In the valleys between the lofty mountains are found strips of good, cultivable soil, on which they are able to grow sufficient grass for their requirements, supplemented by acorns out of which bread is commonly made in many parts of Persia. Many of these valleys afford good pasture grounds and are watered by run ning streams of excellent water. The climate of this region is very healthy and its inhabitants live to a great age. The Dirakwand have the worst622 LUB-LUR reputation of any tribe in Luristan for turbulence, unruliness, and general depredations on caravans and travellers, as well as on their neighbours. Their ravages have extended on occasions across the plains to the west of Dizful and have reached even beyond the Karkheh. They have many times in their history been the recipients of condign punishment for their mis deeds, notably when, after attacking the camp of Timur, he caused Luristan to be devastated and a portion of the tribe to be massacred, and again quite lately, in 1902, when for raiding Kahunak and Julvand they drew down upon them the wrath of the Bakhtiari Khans, who claim to have taught them a severe lesson. This tribe, like many others in Luristan, claims to be of Arab extraction from the Koreish, and their Khans all have the title of Mir, as do those of the Sa’adat BanI ’Abbas. They were in former times probably altogether domiciled in the Pusht-i-Kuh ; since, before the appoint ment of Husain Khan, the ancestor of the present Vali, that chief was always chosen from this tribe. The Dirakwand are now divided into two chief branches—the Baharwand and the Qalawand—and these in turn are sub-divided into numerous clans, vide tabulated statement below. Besides the divisions included under those two heads two others should be mentioned which formerly were of some importance. The first, the Rashan, still belong to the Dirakwand, but have become merged in the Bahar wand and lost their identity; one branch of them live in Khurramabad and are well known as giveh (shoemakers). The second, the Zainawand, separated from the Baharvand some twenty years ago, and have become associated rather with the Sagwand and Bairanwand. Their numbers are said to vary between 300 and 500 tents : and their chiefs are the sons of Mir Karuni. The numbers of the true Dirakwand are reckoned at 1,000 families or some 5,000 souls; but these figures are increased by a strong foreign element of refugees from other tribes, chiefly the Bairanawand and Hasanwand, which would account for a latter day estimate of 4,000 fighting men. The following is a table of the ruling chiefs of this tribe :— Mia Tamar. {Died.) MirSamahad Mir’Abbas (Chief Mirza. Mir Qasim. Mir’All. (Died.) (Saiyid Muham- of Baharwand). mad) Khan. Mir Luft ’AH Mir Darvish, set. 20. set. 20. (Chief of Qalawand). Under existing circumstances their chiefs have no effective control over the tribesmen, whose independence and love of plunder often override the friendly agreements which they have made with the chiefs of other tribes. The Gurz Gurzi are an essentially nomad tribe, owning no lands of their own, but settled mostly amongst the Bairanawand, the Sagwand, the Dal- wand and Kaid Rahmat. Others of the tribe have wandered farther afield into the neighbourhoods of Silakhur and Razan, where they are occupied in agriculture. They originally belonged to the Pusht-i-Kuh, but weremade ovef as servants to one of his followers by the Vali, and were thus transplanted into their present haunts. They are said to number in all some 100 fam lies. The Gallehddr is a small tribe owning certain lands of its own in the neigh bourhood of Ma’dan-i-Namak to the east of Khurramabad ; some of the tribe live, all the year round, in Khurramabad itself, while others of them follow the Bair an;, wand and Sagwand to the garmsirs. The late Muhammad ’AH Mirza, Daulat Shah, appointed this tribe to be servants of the late Haji Mulla Nur ’AH, a Mujtahid from Mazandaran, and exempted the tribesmen from taxation. The tribe now belongs to Haji Agha, grandson of the above-mentioned Mujtahid. Their numbers are reckoned at 80 families or 400 souls. The Rumiarii occupy lands, some 20 miles north of Khurramabad, bet ween those of the Bairan wand and Hasanwand. These are situated in a well-watered, mountainous district known as Rabileh, much of which is forest land and contains many fruit gardens. In the winter they move down to within a few miles of Khurramabad. They supply a contingent of 100 men for the Amrai regiment. They are reckoned at 300 families or a total of 1,000 souls. The Ruh Ruk have their tents some 10 to 12 miles to the east of Khurram abad, between the Bairanawand and Sagwand. They own no lands of their own in their summer quarters, but work for hire in the fields of Ma’dan- i-Namak as well as in the mines. In their winter quarters, near the Chigini TahmaspKhaneh river, they own some property at a place called Dalbar. This is a finely wooded district, and the lands near the river abound with francolm. Their numbers are said to be 100 families or some 500 souls. Tihran The last of the four great divisions of the Burs, known as the Imran, inhabit the country to the west of Klyirramabad and southwards as far as the Saimarreh valley. Much of the land within the limits of these tribes is crown property, which they cultivate to their own advantage after paying moto fixed on them. They are very product ive and are well-watered by the baimarreh river and its numerous tributaries. Saimarreh is an import- AAA 1 !? an ? formerly P aid a mmdt t0 the Persian Government all told of 000 000 lbs. of grain yearly. It is the winter quarters of most of the tribes of Lunstan, with a sedentary population formerly of some 300 or 400 families possessing influential Kaldntdrs. But since the sale of this tract by the Government to Husain Quli Khan, Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, who collect ed his mahat m cash, the district has been deserted by the sedentary a mi ies. The Tihran have their qdildq and Tcishldk mostly contiguous ; a f e alIled h. v marriage and other reciprocal arrangements with the BT an - hhey are, both numerically and in other respects, inferior to the o er three branches of the Lurs. They are divided' up into a number of email clans none of which have the individual importance of some of the divisions of the other branches. Those that have any claim to special no ice are e .higim, the Amrai and the Suri; while the remainder will be found noted in the tabulated statement below. They have no supreme chief . SultanknheDdnr ' le8S *“y of the Fath-us-624 lur—LUR * The Chigini are located in the country to the north-west of and up to with in 12 miles of Khurramabad, extending as far west as the Kashgan river. They own excellent lands which are well watered by several good streams, such as the Naikash and the Sar-i-Ab-i-Darreh and numerous other smaller ones. Included in their lands are the following properties :—Milleh Shaban, Naikash, Darreh, Kuh Safid, Gakleh, Sulmishgar, Haian, Mamulan, Ganda- beh, Nasardaleh and Yalisian. Some of the valleys are well wooded, though speaking generally the forests are thinner here than in other parts of Luris- tan. Their mountain slopes contain game of all kinds in abundance. Most of the above description applies to the lands of the Tahmasp Khani who are the more important of two branches into wnich this tribe is divided. The other branch is the Khatim Khani, situated to the north of the Tahmasp Khani, but whose lands are contiguous. Notwithstanding the favourable description which is given to their country, the Chigini are described by one traveller at least as “ a miserable tribe, destitute of pluck and spirit and only successful as night thieves Their numbers are somewhat vaguely estimated, but it may be taken that they have some 400 families, or 2,000 souls in all. The Amrai inhabit the country about Rumishkhan, which is about 45 miles to the west and slightly south of Khurramabad. Their district is on the slopes of the Tarkhan range which affords a very pleasant climate, especially in winter and spring, while the summer is very hot. Besides the cultivated lands which they hold in this part, they further till the lands en the banks of the Saimarreh, near Rama wand, which form their qishldq. They are reckoned at some 200 families, or 1,000 souls in all. For remarks on the Amrai regiment see below. The Surl occupy lands adjacent to those of the Amrai on the slopes of the Tarkha and the Siab range ; while their qishldq are also in the vicinity of Ramavand on the Saimarreh river. This tribe is sub-divided into three divisions known as the Suri Kuhdashti, the Suri Kuraliwand, and theSuri Kushmawand. Their numbers are estimated at some 220 families, or 1,200 souls. Among the remaining numerous branches or divisions of the Tihran, who are all located to the west of Khurramabad, with the Kara Sh river for their western and the Saimarreh river for their southern limit, may be cited as follows the Sharawand, the Sa’adat Khiatt Gharibi the Bazwand, RamianI, the Rama wand, the Adinehwand, the Kushki, the Beg Muhammad Khani, the Mahmud Khani, the Garrawand, the Zaruti, and the Rika. These are all small clans with families running from 20 to 150 in number, and are variously noted in the tabulated statement below. Besides those noted therein, three other small and comparatively un important tribes require special mention owing to their having migrated somewhat far afield. The Chavari are located on the southern slopes of the Kuh-i-Gurrin brt~ ween the Falak-ud-Din and the Mum anwand. They have built themselves villages on their lands, which are highly cultivate'd and productive. Although the winter is very severe and fuel is very restricted in this region, this tribe does not migrate to the warmer climes of the south. They are div ided into two branches, the Safid and the Kilas ; and they are said to be ’All Ilahis* Their numbers are estimated at 300 families, or some 1,000 souls ; and they supply a company for the Amrdl regiment.LUR— LUR* 625 The Bavall are another branch of the Tihran who have also Become some what estranged from the parent tribe by change of locality. They are found to the south of the Alishtar plain between Mumianwand and the Quliwand. They pay mdlldt to the chief of the Tihran, and consequently are included amongst that tribe. They own well-watered lands, which are also well- wooded and productive of all sorts of fruit, besides gum-tragacanth and gaz, or manna from the tamarisk shrub, and cereals. Their cultivation is limited! Owing to the inaccessibility and wildness of their country, they have a bad reputation as robbers, though not wanting in personal bravery^ They enjoy an excellent climate, and it is said that amongst them are found centenarians still capable of doing work. Their numbers are estimated at some 200 families or 800 souls. The Sin’jdbl are a small and, in later days, a much reduced, branch of the Tihran, who have wandered far afield and are found to the north of the Alishtar plain, between the Mumianwand and Itiawand, though they migrate to qishldqs at Kuh-i-Dasht and Tihran. The chiefs of this tribe are Saiyids and in former days were important personages, having followers in places as far discant as Tabriz. But of later years they have become poor and dispersed and are now said to number not more than 70 or 80 families. Pusht-i-Kuh. The tribes of this district of Luristan are entirely nomadic m character, and as mentioned above they are distinguished from the Lurs of Pish Kuh by the prefix “ Bail! ”. They occupy a remote and almost inacces sible country, a succession of arduous mountain ranges extending from the Saimarreh river to the Turkish frontier. It is not, therefore, surprising that their chieftain occupies a position almost independent of the Central Government. The present Vali is a direct descendant of Husain Khan, the first \ ali of Pusht-i-Kuh. His summer quarters are at Deh-i-Bala, a secluded valley, very difficult of access at the foot of a lofty mountain known, as the Manisht Kuh. If the Vali and his people move from their quarters, ^ it is in the direction of Turkey rather than of Persia that they shift their tents. Their chief is at Husainieh, at the foot of the Pusht-i-Kuh and just within the Turkish border ; it is with Baghdad and Kut-al-’Amarah that the Vali trades : it is upon Turkish territory that he maxes his raids, constant disputes arising about the occupation by the Lurs of Ottoman soil; and his sworn and inveterate enemies are the Ban I Lam, who are Turkish subjects. He is probably the best living re presentative of the old border chieftain, and is said to be able to call out 30,000 fighting men. The present Vali is Riza Quli Khan, the former Saham-us-Saltaneh. His family tree reads as follows :— Husain Qulx Khan .—{Died 1900.) I ’ j | Ghulam Riza Khan, Vali. Ali Riz5 Kh6n. No issue. Aman Ullah Khan. Saham-us -Saltaneh. 1121. B. Ghulam Shah Khan.

To this, it may be added, too much reliance should not be given, as recent lists received have been so difficult to reconcile with the obsolete statements of Layard and Rawlmson, as to make them to be at least of doubtful accuracy. In addition to those given therein, a note may be hare made of a tribe of a somewhat doubt u connection and domicile, as to whether belonging to Lunstan or Persian ’Arabistan. This tribe is „ . . ^ n -rz-y, The ’ Amaleh-i- Karim Khan. —A small isolated clan of Pusht-i-Run origin, occupying a few walled villages about 6 or 7 miles to the west of Dizful. They are often raided by the Chigini and others,^but, though only credited with being able to muster some 80 to 100 sonars they are still able to hold their own. Their claims to consideration, as also indeed the explanation of their continued existence, is the relationship which binds them to the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh and secures to them m some measure his protection. The following table will explain this point; great weight being attached to the marriage of Karim Khan’s daughter Gurgi Khan, brother oi Haidar Khan, father of late Vain Karim Khan, Hash- mat-ud-Dauleh. ’Aziz Khan— (died) ’Abd-ur-Itiza Khan, cet. 25- ’AH Mardan Khan.

The Persian Administration and the CAfe/s.— Reference nas already been made to the fact that the administration of Pish Kuh, or Lnristan proper was taken out of the hands oftheVali by Shah’Abbas m the ear y p of the seventeenth century ; and it has so remained ew since, emg no directly administered by a Deputy Governor, with residence at Kh’arram- abad, under the orders of the Governor-General of Kirmanshah and further, in the detailed notes above on each of the more important tribes the chi tainship of each has been more or less thoroughly discussed. It remains,therefore, to notice generally the relations of the different chiefs with the Persian Governor and with each other, as well as the extent of their authority within their own tribe. The tribes of Luristan, and even the sub-divisions of them are, from a very practical point of view, autonomous States ; with the peculiarity that several of them have no strong territorial connection and move about the country, if not absolutely at will.* at any rate by sufficiently devious courses and without restrictions as to seasons. There are, however, always offensive and defensive federacies existing among them. The Persian Governor elects to favour or to attach himself to one of these, securing thereby the services of certain chiefs and their aid in col lecting a portion, at least, of the revenue: the chiefs, on their part, finding some advantage in being reckoned among the friends of the Government, and attaching some small value to the occasional gifts and the complimentary titles which the Governor is able to bestow on them. The chiefs of different tribes are constantly meeting in conference or communicating with each other by letters, to settle the mutual relaf ions obtaining between their res pective tribes ; and each acts in the character of a sovereign. There are no bonds of union or common action between them, except such as are created by the temporary pacts and agreements of their chiefs made under pressure of the dangers and requirements of the hour. The chief places his superior mental equipment at the service of the tribe. He schemes against the enemies of th e tribe and forms alliances against them, with regard to its safety and the chief necessity of its existence, e.g., grazing. The tribesmen on their part hand over all questions of internal discipline to their chiefs and back his arrangements by force of arms. The chiefs collectively are styled either Khavdnln (plural of Khan) or Hazarat (plural ofHuzur); while in the singular the term Rais ot Bvzurg is m use. The Lur word Rafis sometimes heard; while the prefix Mir or Mia indi cates a connection with a chief’s family. Below the chiefs come the heads of a family or village called Kadkhudd. Upon these men, under the authority of their chiefs, devolves the duty of collecting the taxes, both local and imperial, and they are further responsible to their chiefs for the good order and loyalty of those under them. They may resort to any means they think proper in raising the tribute, and may imprison or maltreat those under them : but they are accountable for its collection as well as for the services in war time to the chief of their people. The chief himself accounts with the Government and is left to raise the tribute through his Kadkhndds. There are, however, notable exceptions, which are more or less recurring, of a disregard of these obligations; such as in the cases of several of the Bala Girleh tribes. The most pro minent offenders of this section of late yearsf, and at the present time, are the Dirakwand, who appear to have broken away altogether from their allegiance to the central authority; and who have distinguished themselves by the committal of many outrages on travellers, even of high position. The most recent case is that of Colonel Douglas, Military Attache at Tehran, who, wdien, travelling in November 1904 with Captain Lorimer, the British Vice-Consul at Ahwaz under the direct escort of the Dirakwand chiexs, had their camp rushed and their tents looted. Both officers were badly wounded in the melee which ensued ; and in this condition, and stripped of all theu628 LUR-LUR effects, they were turned adrift to find their way back as best they could to Khurramabad. The powerlessness of the Persian Government against these lawless tribes is well-instanced by the fact that no efificient steps, beyond a parade of a dummy army, were undertaken for their punishment. It may be assumed, therefore, that the authority of the Persian Governor outside the narrowest limits is merely nominal, and entirely dependent on the good will of the chiefs. The only attempt at any local military force was centred in what is called the Amrai regiihent. In earlier times the Tihran and Dilfan tribes each supplied a regiment, but some 40 or 50 years ago they were amalgamated and the Amrai regiment was formed composed as follows :— 400 men from the Tihran tribe. 300 men from the Dilfan tribe. 100 men from the Tulabi tr.be. This regiment served in Luristan and once went to Tehran ; but in the present day it exists merely in name. When the regiment was mobilized its command was vested in the Governor of Tihran. Life Habits and Religion of the Tribesmen .—Frcm the several allusions made to their life and habits in the detailed description of the more impor tant tribes, it may have been gathered that the life of the tribesmen is one of general insecurity and anxiety. That they would be happy, if it were otherwise, is questionable, but the effect on their temperament is distinctly apparent. The chiefs in particular have an anxious and worn appearance, and are constantly busied with the maturing of agreements, the pursuit of intrigues and the excitement of hostilities, which are necessary for the maintenance of the independence, not to say existence, of their tribes. The tribesmen themselves, while absolved from the burden of the arrangement of these schemes, are the means by which they are carried into effect ; and their life is, therefore, in the case of some of the tribes, a constant re petition of forays and raids, thieving and broken bonds. No better general description of a Lur can be given than that he is an adroit and incurable thief. Another unpleasant characteristic of the Lur is the utter absence of cleanliness. This is one of the chief complaints of the Persian officials who have to dwell amongst them. For instance, it is said that in the whole district of Alishtar there is only one hammdm ; and that one is built by a chief for his own private use. A fat or stout man or woman is rarely seen, while their figures are wiry and well knit to endure fatigue. The prevailing diseases appear to be indigestion, rheumatism, malaria, liver and spleen, due to scanty clothing, sleeping on the ground and exposure. The women wear loose, shapeless dresses, affording no warmth, with little or no underclothing. The clothing of the children is of like character, affording no protection against the cold to the chief internal organ. Most of the offices of labour are performed by the women : they tend the flocks, till the fields, store the grain, and tread out that which is required for use. The men content themselves with sow ing and reaping, cutting wood for charcoal, and defending their property against the attacks of others. The religion of the Lurs is that which is common to most parts of Persia, namely, Shi’ah Muhammadanism; the sect known as 'Ali Illahi is confinedto certain branches of the Dilfan, though it numbers followers in places as far distant as Hamadan, as well as in Kirmaushah. With the exception of the chiefs, however, and their relations, the tribesmen pay very little heed to religious observances ; but the chiefs (even the Dlrakwand) always carry rosaries and say their prayers at the stated times. The Koran is in daily use for completing agreements and alliances : and its tenets and teachings are kept sufficiently in evidence at the rauzeJi Jchdnehs, which are a feature among religious ceremonies throughout Persia generally. Tn regard to ‘All Illdhi-ism it can only be said that its existence is kept very quiet, and in towns, like Hamadan, this is especially the case : and it is further very doubtful whether they keep up any of the extravagances attributed to them by old travellers. Produce and Commerce.—Like their neighbours, the Bakhtiarl, it may be said of the Lurs that their chief occupation is pasture : though they are cultivators to a far greater degree than the other. It is impossible to give a useful computation of the numbers of their flocks and herds at the present time ; but as a general statement they may be taken to be very extensive. Although the mountainous nature of the country precludes any extensive tracts being brought under cultivation, except in a very limited number of localities, the soil of most of the intervening valleys is extremely fertile, and productive of more than a sufficiency of grain for the wants of its in habitants. Any excess cultivation has been discouraged of late years owing to the unsettled state of the country, and the insecurity of the roads by which such excess would be exported. Other produce of the country is gum-tragacanth (Astralgus Jierahensis), of which considerable quantities are collected, more particularly in the Khava District, and which is a very valuable source of income. Of a similar nature, but of comparatively small importance, is the collection of manna, or gaz {Astralgus miacanthus). Lastly, the making of charcoal and the production of butter, cheese and ghi complete the tale of local industry. But probably one, if not the chief, of the sources of the wealth of this ^ Iuleg region is their mule production. Luris- tan is undoubtedly the great mule- producing district of Persia, and in this connection Major Arbuthnot in his somewhat exhaustive reports (1905) writes : “ The mule-breeders of West ern Persia are the Lurs, of whom there are several important tribes, notably the Sagwand, the Bairanawand and Dirakwand, who in turn are broken up into numerous tdifehs, or divisions “ Liir llldts. — (a) Sagwand. The Sagwand are the largest breeders among the southern Lurs, and the dealings of a purchasing officer would be limited at present to them. The present head of this tribe is Fuzil Khan, who is represented in the neighbourhood of Dizful by his two nephews, Khanjan Khan and Hasan Khan. These two chiefs, the former especially, are in telligent men of some business capacity, and seem anxious to assist an Eng lishman in any possible way. The Taifeh-i-S^’adat (Saiyids), one of the divisions of the Sagwand, especially devote themselves to the breeding of mules, and are said to own young stock to a number of over 2,000 at the commencement of their selling season, viz.. December. They come do wn into Dizful yearly from the mountains to dispose of their stock to buyer J630 LUR—LUR from all parts, notably the Bakhtlari, who find their market later on in the neighbourhood of Isfahan, while the Behbehanls purchase for the Shiraz market. “ (b) Bairdnawand and DiraJcwand. —With these tribes there is for the present difficulty in having any dealings : nor is it prudent for a European to enter Luristan from the south for the time being. This state of affairs is not likely to improve in the near future, unless some energetic action is taken by the British Government, in reference to the arrangements lately entered into for the opening up of a road from Dizful to Kirmanshah by the new British Road Company.’’ (For further details, vide this Gazetteer, ’Arabistan—Northern.) Naphtha. —While the streams in all the highlands of Persia are of sweet and pure water, the sandstone and gypsum ridges, which intervene between the alluvial plains on the west and the mountain ranges leading on to the elevated plateau land, produce streams, with few exceptions, of a brack ish or sulphurous nature ; and in these streams are found pools of naphtha or petroleum. There are indications of this in the Beawut and Tumtumeh districts. Between Kaleh Qasim and the Diz river, there is a short, isolated ridge, with broken ground intervening between it and the main ridge. The latter tract is known as Qir Ab, and has an outcrop of naphtha and bitumen which is reputed to be large. It is evident that the naphtha belt runs the whole way along the foot of the western ranges of Persia, extending from at least as far north as Qasr-i-Shirin to a point east of Ahwaz. Nothing has been done within the limits of this province to exploit this possible source of wealth ; and it must await its turn with the other possibilities connected with the recrudescence of the prosperity of Persia. Communications. —No communications other than by road exist through Luristan : the rivers such as the Ab-i-Diz and the Karkheh partaking too much of the character of torrents, at least within the limits of the province, to be of any utility as a means of communication. The u°e of the term “ road ” is also merely used in its general sense, as they may be said not ,to ex’st and should rightly be called “ tracks.” Even as such they are mostly execrable, as in other parts of Persia. The principal “tracks, ” therefore, are— 1. Dizful to Deh Bala (Pusht-i-Kuh), 14 stages, 184 miles. 2. Dizful to Zurbatiyeh, 14 stages, 162 miles. (Most of the route tra versed by this road is in Turkish territory). 3. (a) Dizful to Burujird, via Juqar and Khurramabad, 18 stages, 220 miles. (6) Dizful to Burujird, w'dPul-i-Tang and Khurramabad, 16 stages, 231 miles. 4. Dizful to Pul-i-Kul, 8 stages, 78 miles. 5. Ab-i-Zal to Chimishk, 4 stages, 24 miles. 6. Khurramabad to Kirmanshah, via Harsin, 7 stages, 110 miles. 7. Khurramabad to Deh Bala (Pusht-i-Kuh ) via Pul-i-Madian Rud, 12 stages, 130 miles. 8. Deh Bala to Sar-i-Pul Zuhab, 8 stages, 77 miles.The English Road Company has obtained a concession for the construc tion of a road through from Dizful to Tehran ; and work upon it had reached as far as Sultanabad (’Iraq) in 1905. The improvement of the existing track from that place southwards, with the development of the Karun river, would afford an efficient outlet for the trade to the north ; but for the present (1905) it is entirely closed owing to the depredations of the tribes, nor is there any early prospect of the restoration of order. * i ) ) 1 t e I! i, I i \Tabulated statement shewing the various groups, with the tribes and sub-divisions of each, of the Lurs of the Pish Kuh and Pusht=i-Kuh.l^cLyctr-a, IS 43 J3&amp;LL, ’ this article i s noted.) ^orbaier, 7005 and r bat/mot, 1905 i Oy w/iom LUR-LUV 641 &lt;52) Lt}RT— Lat.

The building, which undoubtedly was his resting-place, is also claimed to have been that of Solomon’s mother, as well as that of Cyrus the younger (by Xenophon). It is situated at a short distance to the north-east of the village, and is built on a platform with seven successive tiers about 45 feet square at the base.

Feeling that he ought to make one great and last struggle for the throne of Persia, Lutf 5 AH, with a few hundred men, surprised Agha Muhammad’s army, 30,000 strong, and succeeded in putting a number to flight, and throwing all into great confusion, though he had eventually to fly to prevent himself being taken prisoner. It is the 3rd stage on the Shiraz-Isfahan road via Asupas and is practically ruined, containing only 15 inhabited houses. The village has several depend encies, the chief being Bid-i-Gul, Gurmakan, and Gubdan. There is a ruined serai.

They then returned to their own country by Sist an and Kirman to Shiraz, and settled in the district of Falard, driving out the original possessors. The country occupied by them being within Ears, they pay tribute to the governor, but the tribe itself being included within the division of the Bakhtiari, they also pay the capitation tax,—the former amounts to 400 tumdns, the latter to 300. They consist of about 1,000 families.— (Layard.) MALlKEH— Lat. Long. Elev. A village of 20 houses of K’ab of the Dris division, situated on the left bank of the Bahmanshir about a mile above Shakhat HajI Is-haq on the opposite side.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) MALAMlR— Lat. 31° 51* N.; Long. 49° 58* E. ; Elev. 2,950*. An extensive plain in the heart of the Bakhtiari country. It is a remarkable feature in so rugged a country in that it is perfectly flat. It is oval in shape, being about 15 miles by 8, and surrounded on all sides by mountains rising to a normal height of 1,500 feet above the plain. Those on the west side are low and those to the north and east lofty and falling, as a rule, precipitouslyMAL-MAt 649 to the plain. A spur of limestone hills, called the Kuh-i-Eshgal, an offshoot from the great Mangasht range, runs into the plain from the east and so forms a secondary plain of considerable extent. The valley is covered with rushes and grass and is stony and bare of trees. It is little cultivated owing to its being irregularly irrigated by a few springs, which rise at the foot of the hills and drain away from the plain along its edges. Besides these, a sluggish stream of brackish water converts the northern por tion of the plain into an extensive marsh, and often, after the winter rains, inundates the whole of it. The drainage of the southern exit is through the gorge of Halalgan. That of the north is mainly retained, forming the lake above mentioned. Cultivation is scanty and only in the immediate vicinity of the several hamlets which are situated near the foot of the hills. It is principally used as grazing-ground. In this respect it is much spoilt by the great amount of camel-thorn, and nettles which overgrow it, but in the northern half, where exposed to inundation, it grows grass to some height. The centre pf the valley rises to a low mound, on which is the haleh of the Khans. Burton, in 1903, describes the lattpr as the ruins of a fort, of round stones strongly cemented, the whole almost covered with earth and debris, but showing the walls and arches of the lower rooms. In 1905 it was in process of rebuilding. Surrounding the haleh, is the village sometimes known as Ijasa, but more commonly as Malamir. South of the mound, the valley becomes less level, and is traversed by spurs and a well-defined ravine running south-east towards the Halaigan gorge. A sluggish stream runs from the south-west side of the valley to the central mound. About 1 mile due south stands the, caravanserai, which marks the 11th stage from Isfahan (191 miles) on the Bakhtiari caravan road. The serai was built in 1903 by Isfandiar Khan of burnt brick, 70 yards square, with walls 10 feet high and a well in the centre, the water of which is 20 feet from the surface. In the vicinity of the mound is a Lur grave yard with the usual .stone lions in some number. West of the mound is a square fort with four flanking tow T ers, only the towers being in good repair, while about | a mile north can be seen the traces of a fort’s circumference, with ea rth ramparts and a comer of a central bastion, and ruins of buildings of round stones and mortar in the centre. The plain of Malamir has been identified as Apirti and was inhabited by the Apharsites mentioned b}^ Ezra. Apirti was a province of Elam, wdiose inhabitants formed part of the colonists placed in Samaria by Assur Bani Ra to fill the places of the Captive Jews. Towards the eastern end are mounds covering the remains of the Sassanian city of Idej. In a narrow valley, known as the Tang-i-Nashafil leading from the plain near its southern extremity through which the caravan route runs, are found some interesting; antiquities. These are hidden away high up in a cave with a cliff, known as Shikaft-i-Sulaiman, on the left side of the road leading to Kaleh-i-Tul. The cave contains a number of sculptures and basreliefs either of Susian or Achsemenian origin, dating back to 800 or 900 B. C. There are remains of cuneiform inscriptions on the panels. In 1330 A.D. Ibn Batutah, the Moorish traveller, visited Malamir and describes it as being the city of Sultan Atabeg Afraslab. It waa .then apparently in a good state.. 112 LB,650 MAL-MAL It is supposed to have even a greater antiquity than the Sassanian Epoch. The village of Malamir contains 150 houses with a population of some 600 souls. 32,500 lbs. of grain are sown annually as well as 1,300 lbs of rice. The taxes amount to 2,000 Irdns per annum, 5 Irdns per head of families. The Samsam-us-Saltaneh has lately opened a good qandt ; under the usual circumstances, supplies are available for 100 men and 500 animals for one day. The water has to be brought from springs from l\ to 2 miles ' distant. The water of the stream is brackish but not badly so. It is said to contain leeches. The caravanserai supplies approximately 6,000 mans of barley per annum. The retail selling price per Shahi man_oi 13 lbs in October and November 1906 was barley—1 krdn, bhusd 20 krdns. Temperature, 5th August, in a room of the serai and out of doors, 88°—100°. The popultion of the Malamir valley is nomadic. Lur camps are pitched there throughout the winter, the tribes beginning to arrive in the middle of September. Except for the village of Malamir itself, such l few built habitations as there are, are vacated in summer. Two roads lead from Malamir to Kaleh-i-Tul, the first via Tang-i-Nashalll (16 miles), the second via Halalgan, 2 or 3 miles longer and more to the west. The first is not always considered safe, in which case caravans follow the second.— (Layard — Burton, Vm—Report of a Journey through the Bakhtidri Country to Shushtar — Arbuthnot, 1905— Lorimer, 1906.)

MlrzS Mansam Khan. Non-nomad. iMAM-MAM «5$ It would appear that formerly there Was a fifth nomad division, e.g.&gt; Mahmud Salih (or Muhammad Salihi), presumably the Allam Salih of Baring and the Muhammad Salihi mentioned by DeBode as a Sub-division of Rus tam, which about 1885 broke away and joined the Qashqais. The tribe is celebrated as one of the most lawless of Persia. They claim descent from Rustam, having emigrated, they say, from Sistan. They have always given a great deal of trouble, and after the death of Path ’All Shah, the communi cation between Bushire and Shiraz was almost cut off by one of their chiefs, Yali Khan Bakish. They were, however, reduced by a detachment of regular troops from Azarbaijan. It is said that on this occasion their women, 100 in number, rather than fall into the hands of these troops, threw themselves over the precipice with their children, and were dashed to pieces. There is a permanent feud between the Mamassanis and the Qashqais. The tribal chiefs Dushman Ziari, Bakish and Bavi, being related by inter-mar riage, feuds between these divisions are not frequent; but there is considerable enmity and constant petty warfare between these three divisions and the Rustam. Their principal stronghold in former years was that of Kaleh Safid in the Bavi division, a considerable Diz, or hill fort, situated about 1,500 feet above the plain and said to have been 4 miles in circumference. They were formerly inclined to be friendly to the British, and were accustomed to look to them for protection against the Persian Government. They are a fine race with features of the ancient Iranian type. They are considered to be Lurs t and speak the Lur dialect with local modifications. The Mamassani do not owe allegiance or pay tribute to the Governor-General of Pars. About 1902, the major part, being a fief of the crown, was sold to a rich merchant of Bushire, ihi Mu’m-ut-Tujjar. This transaction was arranged by the Atabeg-i-A’zam the then Vazir. The farmdn of the Mu’ln-ut-Tujjar gives him rights of “ haute et hasse justice over the lands and tribes pur chased by him ; and over which the Governor-General of Pars has no right of jurisdiction or taxation.— (DeBode — Baring — Bell — Grahame, 1905— Ar- buthnot, 1905.) Vaughan says that the Mamassani Lurs are said to be divided into four principal divisions, as follows - Tribe or Taifeh. Chef. Number of families. Quarters. 1. Bakish .. 5,000 .. 2. Javidi .* • • • • 4,000 • • •• 3. Dushman Ziari .. Murad Quli Khan .. 5,000 Country between Behbehan, Kazarun, Ardakan and Shul. Kaleh Safid to Basht, Da Gumbazan, Bandar Rig and up to the Bakhtiari country. 4. Rustam .. Ja’afar Quli Khan .. 7,000 .. .... Schindler however says that the total population of the Mamassani tribe is only 5,000 families.654 MAM—MAM The Mamassaui Luts pay 12 ; 000 tumdns mdlldt to the Governor of Shiraz, and 20,000 tumdns besides. These tribes, judging from the retinue of their Khans (whom one would naturally suppose to be the best ' equipped), are principally armed with smooth-bore muzzle-loaders and a few with Martini carbines, chiefly of the sporting pattern. They are all marked “ Allport London.” They also possess some smooth-bore, double-barrelled, muzzle-loading guns, pistols and knives ; they seem a simple, ignorant, primi tive lot of people, with a very high opinion of themselves and their fighting powers, and are said to be devoted to their chiefs. They would probably be troublesome to the unaccredited traveller. The Dushman Ziari are said to be the most war-like of the tribe.— (Vaughan, 1890.)

Stack saw this river about 100 yards above its junction with the Karun, and at this point it flows with a smooth , silent stream, very swift, hip-deep, and very cold and clear ; the breadth is about 30 yards. The bank is clothed with willows, and immediately above them rises a steep slope of 100 feet covered with quarried stones and splinters. At the junction of the rivers stand the remains of the dam which was to throw the Karun water into the cleft; the Persian monarchs were hewing for it through Kar Kunan. Ihere is an island midway between the two streams and this ; and at the mouth of the ravine down which the Karun flows, are the ruins of two piers, built of unhewn stone, ^ 112 I. B. 4 G958 MAR—MAR compacted some 30 feet thick, and 8 feet to 10 feet in height The dam does not seem to have ever been completed. The meeting of the waters looks well when viewed from the stone-strewn slope. So deep and narrow is the channel that even the summits of the Zard Kuh are lost to sight, and the spectator finds himself alone with three river vistas -up the Marbara on his right, up the Karun in the direction he faces, and down the combined stream on his left. The dark, high sides of the river channels contrast strongly with the bright blue-green of the waters, and the deep blue of the sky. The swiftness and silence of the current enhance the strange effect. The combined stream rushes along unfordable, but the Marbara can be crossed 50 yards above the point of junction. It is unfordable in the after noon, when it has received its day’s contingent of melted snow. It is called the Marbara because its waters are so cold that a snake dies if plunged in them.— (Stack .) MlRBARA (2) ob CHANl MARBARA— Lat. Long. Elev. 5,195'. A large spring in the Pusht-i-Kuh division of Luristan, 12^ miles from Deh Bala, on the road to Kut-ul-’Amareh.

It unites with the river Bulawas in the Ramuz district, 10 or 11 miles below Ramuz town, and the two together then form the river Jarrahi. Sultanabad and Jaizan in the Ramuz district lie respect ively 13 and 28 miles up from its junction with the Bulawas. The valley of the Marun in the Ramuz district is 1 to 2 miles wide, flat and enclosed by cliffs, 50 to 100 feet high. The stream is 50 to 100 yards broad, 3 to 6 feet deep, and has a strong current. The banks are bordered with thick willow jungle. About 5 miles above Sultanabad the Marun receives on its right bank a tributary of fresh water called Mamuhieh, 10 yards wide and 3 feet deep, fringed with willows and oleanders. On the north side of the Marun in places are grassy plains with thorn trees. The river has also been called the Rud-i-Marun or Rumarun. Colonel Bell, on his route from Isfahan to Behbehan, reached the banks of the Rumarun river (Kurdistan river) on the 12th June, 1884 ; barometer 27*OS' (1,400 feet); thermometer 102°. The artificial horizon became too hot to be lifted after it had been for 7 minutes exposed to the sun at 3 p.m. The river is from 60 to 80 yards wide, with a bouldery bottom and swift cur rent ; its banks are here low and well-wooded. There is good pasture on the hill-sides in the vicinity, i.e., a dried up grass, 6 inches to 9 inches high. At 3-30 a.m., barometer 28*1* ; thermometer 70°. Wells writes about this river :— ‘ ‘ December 8th. —Last night our tent was pitched near the village of Kuriseh of about 15 inhabitants. A white frost and cold fog cover the land this morning. A stream from the direction of the north has first to be crossed, and 3 miles from camp the river Jarrahi {i.e., the Marun river at this point) itself forms a formidable obstacle. From bank to bank it is 70 yards wide, and in flood would be at least 6 feet deep. It is a rapid stream, and even now, when only 45 yards wide, is only fordable by strong men, being up to the horses’ girths. In spring it would be a nasty flood to pass. Fine cover of tamarisk and oleander marks its course, whilst beyond, palm groves, villages, and cultivated ground present an unwonted scene of prosperity and security for this part of Persia. Wild cabbage is the ordinary \ weed of the plain — {Bell — Wells — Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) 4 02660 MAR—MAR MARUZEH— Lat. 31° 2' N. Long. 55° 57 r E. A village fort in Kirman, Persia, 140 miles south-east of Yazd, on the road to Kirman, from which it is 85 miles distant in a north-westerly- direction.— (Abbott.) MARYAK— Lat. Long. Elev. A hill in Ears, beautifully wooded, and covered with vegetation to the sum mit, near the road between Masarm and Jireh.— (Durand.) MARVDASHT— Elev. A district of Ears and a plain about 22 miles north of Shiraz crossed on the road to Isfahan. The plain is a flat expanse about 15 miles in width from north to south, while its south-easterly extension is said to stretch for 40 miles. It is bounded on the east by the district of Arsinjan, on the north by Kamin and Main, on the west by Ramjird and on the south by the district of Shiraz and Kurbal. Qandts and irrigation channels dug from the Band Amir river intersect it in every direction, and have always rendereed it a fertile spot. Nothing, however, illustrates more pertinently the de cline of modern Persia than the fact that, though this plain in Le Brun’s day, not two centuries ago, contained 880 villages, this total has so dwindled that Curzon numbers them at 50 and other writers as low as 17. So inade quate is the control of the water-supply that the plain often lies half under water, and is converted into stagnant pools and swamps. The soil of the plain is alluvial. It is chiefly composed of marl and is in general less stony than that of Shiraz. In many parts, and particularly to the south-west it is a decided clay. It is higher than Shiraz and possesses every requisite except good government to become populous. The productions of the district from the winter sowings are wheat, barley, bran and a little opium ; from the summer sowings, rice, grain, til, castor and cotton. Sesame and melons are also cultivated in April, the plain is green and fertile. Numbers of Illdts feed their flocks on the wide expanse of the plain, and. if not kept in order, are apt to turn their hands to robbery.

Where Masha ends, Gusheh (q.v.) begins, and a little farther down the valley is Durra {q.v.). The cultivation extends down the valley for I 3 miles and at its widest is 1 mile in width. The valley is highly cultivat ed, chiefly with fruit and vegetables, and is crowded with trees. The road down the valley is a fair track and passable for laden mules, though steep and winding in places. It passes down through a succession of culti vated terraces and crosses, by rough wooden bridges, rushing torrents of water. The whole valley is delightfully cool and forms a charming summer resort. Two-thirds of the inhabitants of the valley are Babis. They are a mild and peaceably disposed people. The live-stock of the valley comprises 100 cows, 2,500 sheep, 1,000 goats, 400 donkeys and a few mules. The valley, like that of Deh Bala, is very strong position, and the three I passes—one north, one south and one north-east—could easily be held * against vastly larger numbers. The elevation of the upper end is 8,291 feet. —{Vaughan, 1890.) MASHAL— Lat. Long. Elev. A village near the river Shatait {q.v.). MASHGAKl— Lat. Long. Elev. 2,300'.

It forms the 4th caravan and post stage of the road. The village itself is built on the mound in a luxuriant plain, with a plantation of chlndr trees and watered by a fine stream. It contains houses of a superior type and gardens, and has a good caravanserai and a post house. The inhabitants number 2,000. The district is said to have been in the hands of a family of Arabian origin for over 700 years. The Khan lives in a picturesque kaleh overlooking the village, but commanded at close range by hills to the north. The water here is good, but supplies are scanty and fuel is scarce. The well cultivated valley in which the village lies is a favourite camping-ground of the Turk and Arab Qashqai llldts, whose black, goat’s-hair tents cover it at certain seasons of the year. The climateMAS—MAS 863 here is more bracing than that of Shiraz. In the hot season, it is very hot in the middle of the day, but even at this time the nights are cool. In winter the cold is severe, snow often lying on the ground for months to gether. Intermittent fever oceursonly occasionally. The most common diseases are diarrhoea, dyspepsia and ophthalmia. There are lead mines in the neighbourhood. Wilson who visited the place in 1907 describes it as a collection of villages as under, owned by Sani’-ud-Dauleh, situated in abroad, fertile valley, about 50 miles north-west of Shiraz.

It consists of some 200 houses, with an estimated population of 1,000 persons, which are built round the ruins of a mud fort standing on a mound. There is a considerable amount of cultivation in the neighbour hood. Ordinary supplies are procurable in abundance, as well as excel lent drinking water from a spring. A mile short of the town are extensive ruins of the ancient city, once held by the Azrakites, with an interesting octagonal-domed shrine, called Pir-i-Jasus.

The hills enclose it on west, north and east; on the south it lies open to the flat districts of Dashtistan and Zira. Mszara’i is itself a plain and suffers ex tremes of heat in summer. The inhabitants are Persian-speaking Shi’aha of mixed tribes, numbering about 3,000 souls ; they cultivate wheat, barley and dates, and export some wool and dates and a considerable quantity of gum, collected in the hills, to Bushire. The imports and the details of trade generally do not differ from those of the other small districts near Bushire. The local Hashim man is equal to 20 Tabriz mans of Bushire. MazaraT possesses about 700 donkeys, besides a few mules and horses. The Salar-i-Mu’azzam manages the affairs of the districts through an agent.

The inhabitants are’Anafijeh Arabs towards the southern end, and elsewhere Bakhtiari, Lurs, and mixed Persian and Arab tribes peculiar to the Mianab. In spring the island is covered with vegetation, the grass sometimes reaching to a horse’s belly ; but in winter there is no verdure except in the neighbour hood of the villages, where the people cultivate the ground with wooden- shared ploughs drawn by horses, mules, buffaloes and even donkeys. The northern end of the island was once highly cultivated and irrigated by the Minau canal from Shushtar town, and about J of it at the northern end is still so served. The area of the Mianab is only about 270 square miles, and the whole of it could be watered from the existing canal if it were improved and worked. Within a radius of 3 miles of Shushtar there are many hundr and date trees; farther south the only trees are date trees belonging to villages. The game of the Mianab comprises mallard, teal, snipe, plover, and francolin, sand-grouse and pigeons ; there are also jackals and pigs, and there were formerly lions. Three tracks lead from Band-i-Qir to Shushtar. The westernmost, 32 miles in length, runs to an encampment of the Bani Hasan about 12 miles from Band-i-Qir, where it strikes the left bank of the Shatait; after con tinuing along the Shatait for 3 or 4 miles, it leaves it at a second Arab village and makes direct for Shushtar. The middle track, running through ’Arab Hasan land, is shorter but becomes impassable after rain. The easterly track strikes the right bank of the Gargar at Daulatabad, 11 miles from Band-i-Qir, and follows it more or less closely for 21 miles to Shushtar.

In summer however, the volume is not great. The serai is a good one, situated in a commanding position on a natural terrace, some 200 to 300 yards square. Behind the serai are the ruins of an old one the roofs oi which are more or072 MIA—MIH less intact.* Pelly thinks Mian Kutal is the first point on the road from Bushire, where the climate can be considered such as would suit the European constitution during the hot season. There is no village near this, nor are any supplies obtainable except a little straw, but the carfivanserai would accommodate 500 men, and there is camping-ground for 500 or more on the plateau.

It is a noble bay, secure against the prevailing winds of the Gulf. It is formed by Cape Bustaneh to the eastward, and Cape Certes (?), which in Heather’s chart is improperly called Bestian, to the westward ; the ex tremes, which lie north-west by west and south-east by east of each other, are about 10 miles asunder. The bay is of a good depth, and is capable of holding the largest fleets ; the ground is tough clay, from which you with difficulty heave up the anchors : the soundings without the bay are irregular ; and, between Mughfl and Farur is a rocky shoal, on which is less than three fathoms. This shoal lies nearer to the main than to Farur, and is an objection against run ning from the bay in the night, but in the day-time the marks are so good that you may easily avoid it. By keeping a remarkable round and lofty hill, named Charak hill, north west, a ship will be led into Mughu Bay. The Chiffonne’s marks for anchorage in Mughu Bay are as follows Against a north-west wind.—Extremes of the land west by north to south-east; the town of Mughu north by east, off shore 2 miles, in 5£ fathoms, tough clay ; the points which form the bay south-east by east quarter east to west by north. Against a south-east wind.—Farur south quarter west to south by west, half west, off shore three-quarters of a mile, in 6£ fathoms, tough clay.678 MUG—MUH The shoal between Fa^ur island and Mughfl Bay.—The marks of this shoal, as taken by Mr. Smart, Master of His Majesty’s Ship Caroline, in January 1810, are by compass the island of Farur south-half west, to south by west-half-west; extremes of the Persian land north-west by west to east-north-east ; the eastern fall of Charak hill, in one with the two points of the eastern boundary of Mugha Bay, which in the charts is improperly called Cape Bestian, north-north-west a;nd north-west by north. These bearings were taken from a boat. The shoal is composed of coarse sand and shells. MUGHU— Lat. (at thickest round tower) 26° 35 / 50' N. Long. 54° SO'dO' E. ' The last, on the south-east, of the Shlbkuh Ports of the Persian Coast; it lies about 17 miles south-east of Charak and 23 miles west by north of Lingeh town. Inland of Mughh are date plantations ; on the coast to the east of it low sand-hills extend for about two miles and the nearest slopes of Kuh Namaki are about 1 mile to the westward. Water is from a dozen wells, sunk about 15 feet in a clay soil, and is sweet. There are several towers for defence and in 1899 a fort was built to ward off the attacks of the people of Charak. There are 150 houses, some unoccupied ; and the inhabitants are mostly Marazig, or Marzugi Arabs, who are Wahhabies. Grazing near village, good. No shops, but 5 business warehouses. Wheat, barley and dates are export ed. A few of the inhabitants are traders, the remainder are sailors, pearl divers and cultivators. To Mughu belong 8 sambuqs trading to the Coast of Arabia, 8 sambuqs which cross the Gulf to the Arabian Pearl banks, and 4 ’amilals and 12 shu'ais which are used both for fishing and for pearl* diving on the Persian side at Bustaneh and Farur Island. The inhabitants are well-provided with rifles and many habitually carry arms. The Shaikh of Mughu pays 1,000 tumdns yearly to the Governor of Bastak. The Imperial Persian Customs have a post here.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer — Lorimer.) ~- MUGUVT— A division of the Chehar Lang Bakhtiari. They number a thousand families, but were formerly a very large section and one of the original tribes of the Chehar Lang. For their divisions see Bakhtiari.— (Layard.) MUHAISIN— A powerful Arab tribe of Southern ’Arabistan and Turkish Arabia, of which the ruling Shaikh of Muhammareh is the head. The tribal head quarters are in Persian territory, but less than half of the tribe are Persian subjects ; the majority inhabit the right bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab and are under Turkish jurisdiction. Those belonging to Persia are found in the northern part of ’Abbadan island, occupy the whole of the Shatt-al-’Arab district of Southern ’Arabistan to the north of the Karun, and extend up both banks of the Karun into the Ahwaz district. All are cultivators of dates, and some in addition grow wheat and barley upon both banks of the Karun from Muran downwards; they own many sheep and goats, some cattle, and a few buffaloes. The custom of the Muhaisin is to leave the 1 Muhammareh neighbourhood for their grain lands on the Karun in Novem-MUH-MUH 679 ber; in February, after sowing these, they return to Muhammareh to fertilise their dates ; in May they revisit the Karun to reap their wheat and barley ; in June or July they re-appear about Muhammareh in expectation of the date-harvest which begins at the middle of ^July. The Muhaisin in Persian territory number about 6,000 fighting men, of whom about two- thirds are armed with rifles and 1,000 are mounted on horses. The particulars of the Muhaisin tribe in Persia are given in the following table. 5 Section. Al Bii Kasib Mutur Hilalat Al Bii Farhan , Ahl-ul-’Arldh . Bait Glianim . Bagh aniyeh . Al Bu Ma’arrif.

These individuals, according to tradition, belong to a tribe of the Muhammareh district which was compelled to emigrate by the encroachments of the Ka’b and settled on the Tigris under the name of A1 Husain Pasha. Muhaisin and Kasib with some followers, having purchased land in the neighbourhood of the modern Muhammareh from the Ka’b, eventually returned to settle near the original seat of the tribe, and the headship of the tribe which they founded remained in the family of Kasib. Haji Yusuf-bin-Mardau, a descendant of Kasib, ultimately became Gov ernor of Muhammareh on behalf of the Ka’b Shaikh and his son Haji Jabir was Shaikh of Muhammareh when it was occupied by British troops in 1857 : his usual residence before that date had been at Daiji in Turkish territory. After the peace between Britain and Persia, Haji Jabir was made independent of the Ka’b Shaikh by a Persian prince, the Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh who governed the province ; and after the Ka’b Shaikh had been captured and sent to Tehran, the Fallahiyeh district was added to Haji Jabir’s dominions. Constant fighting ensued between the Muhaisin and the Ka’b, in which the Dris section of the Ka’b inhabiting ’Abbadan island sided with the Muhaisin. In 1860 Zia-ul-Mulk, the Persian Governor of ’ Arabistan, countenanced the Ka’b party, and the result was the seizure and temporary removal of Haji Jabir to Tehran ; two years later, however, having been released, he was reinstated with the title of Nusrat-ul-Mulk by Prince Farhad Mirza, the new Persian Governor. From this time onwards the Ka b Shaikhs have never been entirely free of Muhaisin control. Haji Jabir died in 1881 : his successes were largely due to the fighting qualities of his son ’Isa, who pre-deceased him. Haji Jabir was succeeded byhis sonMizalwho, by playing off one pretender to the Shaikhship of Fallahieh against another, and by putting in first one rival and then another as Shaikh, succeeded in becoming paramount chief of the Muhaisin and Ka’b tribes. The hereditary Yali of Hawizeh, who formerly ruled the whole country between the Karun and the Tigris rivers, also iell under the power of Mizal; his authority, exercised subject to control from Muhammareh, is now hardly felt outside the town of Hawizeh. Mizal received from the Persian Government the title of Mu’izz-ul-Seltanah. He fell a victim in 1897 to a conspiracy organised by his cousin Salman-bm- Mansur, to which most of the tribal Shaikhs were privy. Khaz’al, the youngest and only surviving son of Haji Jabir, succeeded his brother. The title of Mu’izz-ul-Saltaneh was continued in his favour, and to it was subMUH-MUH 681 sequently added the military title of Sardar Ara’. By him the two hereditary Shaikhs of Fallahieh were deported and detained near Muhham- mareh, and the k allahieh district has ever since then been under his direct administration through local headmen. He is now recognized by the Persian Government as ruler of all Southern ’Arabistan. The heir- apparent to the Shaikhship of Muhammareh is Chasib, the eldest son of Khaz’al by an Arab wife, who has already been invested by the Persian Gov. ernment with the old title of Nasrat-ul-Mulk. Shaikh Khaz’al married in 1902 a grand-niece of the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, the present (1905) Grand Vazir of Persia.— (Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) MUHAMMADABAD (1)—Lat. 30° 52' N. Long. 55° 23' E.

The capita] and only important town of Southern ’Arabistan, and it may also be described as the sole seaport and entrepot of foreign trade in all ’Arabistan Muhammareh stands on the right or north bank of the Haffar canal (q.v.), a continuation of the Karun river. The houses begin some miles above the confluence of the Haffar and the Shaft-al-’Arab, and the front age of‘the town extends upwards from this point. The town stands on alluvial soil, and the bank of the canal, which would otherwise be subject to erosion, is protected within the limits of the town by revetments of date- logs laid horizontally, and forming quays and wharves. Muhammareh is shut in upon its upper side by the date plantations of Nahr Slyab; on its lower side by those of Hizan. These groves, however, are only a J of a mile deep, and behind the town is an open, treeless desert stretching way into the interior, no high ground being within sight of Muhammareh. This country is bound ed on the east by the river Karun, on the west by the Shatt-al-’Arab, and the south by the Haffar canal. The town, which is constantly increas ing in size, consists at present (1905) x)f about 800 houses—some of brick, some of mud. and some merely huts. Upon the river there are some fine modern buildings; among them the most conspicuous is the palatial man sion of HajI Muhammad ’AH, Rais-ut-Tujjar, who is also the Chief Secretary of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. There are also six mosques, three public baths, and a good brick bazar. The last has a domed roof throughout and was built by the present Shaikh, who is less afraid than were his immediate predecessors of exciting the cupidity of the Persian Government. The state of the town, in spite of these and other improvements, continuesMUH—MUH 683 to be highly hsaintary : the only kind of drain seen is a channel cut down the middle of each street, generally choked up except after rain, and the town has been described as “rioting in smells.” In the town, towards its eastern end, are the residence of the Persian Kdrguzdr, the telegraph ofiice, and a battery of five miscellaneous brass field-pieces overlooking the river. The village of Kut-ush Shaikh, on ’Abbadan island, opposite to the town, is practically a suburb. Outlying appurtenances of Muham- mareh are the Customs House—originally built as a Governor’s palace— at the mouth of the Karun upon its right bank, the quarantine station and the doctor’s quarters, which are a little farther from its mouth upon the left bank, and w&lt; re corstructed in the first instance for art'lkry and infantry barracks respectively. The British Consulate stands on the right bank of the Haffar between the town and the Customs House, and the British cemetery is some distance inland from the Consulate, at the point where the date-groves of Hizan give place to open country. There are only two or three registered British subjects resident in Muhammareh ; but in the date-season Indian boats con taining British subjects visit the town, and numerous Indian pilgrims, Borahs and others, pass through the place on their way to the Shi’ah shrines. Muhammareh was brought into telegraphic communication with the capital of Persia in 1879, and is now connected by telegraph with Bandar Nasiri, and by telephone with the Shaikh’s head-quarters at Failieh; one or two of the offices in the town, belonging to the Shaikh or to the Persian Government, are also connected by telephone. The water at Muhammareh is, of course, plentiful and very good from the rivers, but is not to be obtained from wells, as the water found in them is salt and brackish. A well was dug by our Sappers in 1856 at about a mile inland, and no water was procured till the well had attained a depth of 23 feet, when a very little was found, and that was undrinkable and brackish. Water is also to be obtained from the vauious cuts and ndlds, but doubts are entertained as to its wholesomeness, owing to its flowing through the date-groves, where vegetable matter grows thickly on the banks. The water from the Bahmanshvr, or Haffar, should be always procured, if possible, for drinking, being supposed to be much more wholesome than that of the Shatt-al-’Arab ; while the creek or irrigation water should be avoided, being impregnated with the foul vegetable matter through which it passes. History .—On or near the site of the modern Muhammareh, Alexander the Great founded one of his numerous Alexandrias. This city having been destroyed by flood, it was rebuilt by Antiochus and called Antichia. Again washed away, it was again rebuilt and called Charax ; and having been captured by an Arab chief named Spasines, received his name—Spansin Charax. Ardashlr Babakan, when rebuilding the town about 235 A. D., changed its name from Kerkh Misan (Charax of Mesene) to Astarabad. In the old days, some six centuries ago, when Ahwaz, Shushtar, and Diz- ful were large cities, and the centres of popular districts and an extensive commerce, Muhammareh was a port of some renown. In 1812 it was rebuilt by a Shaikh of the Muhaisin tribe to resist the encroachments of 4 R684 MUH-MUH Turkey. In 1820 it was for a short time the head-quarters of the British Residency, which was moved thither from Basrah in consequence of the disturbances between the Turks and the Arabs at the latter place, and the prevalence of piracy on the river above. Soon after this Shaikh Thamir opened Muhammareh as a free port, thereby bringing down upon himself the vengeance of the Vali of Baghdad, who found the trade of Basrah suffered severely from the competition of such a rival. The town was plundered by the Turks in 1837, and during the course of the subsequent troubles the Persians were first admitted into the town by the Muhaisin in 1841. Their subsequent right of possession was strongly disputed by the Turks, but by the treaty of Erzerum (1847), owing mostly to the support of England and Russia, Muhammareh was left, and has ever remained, in Persian hands. Much bad feeling has been induced between the Persians and Turks in these parts, on this account, for the latter have shown themselves jealous of the intrusion of any other Power upon the Shatt-al-’Arab, and still more so of the rising fortunes of Muhammareh town. At a latter date Muhammareh cut a somewhat inglorious figure in the Anglo-Persian War of 1857, when it was hastily fortified by the Per sians and was incontinently shelled from the river by 6 British men-of-war. The Persians, whose army consisted of 13,000 men under Prince Khanlar, had erected 4 batteries on the mainland, and 5 on the opposite side of the river on ’Abbadan island, with casemated batteries exceedingly well placed. The north fort on the point west of Muhammareh was one of the best, and this was the one with which our men-of-war were principally engaged. It consisted (as did all the others) of a well con structed parapet, made of layers of date leaves and clay, well rammed and bound together. This battery had nine embrasures; the others had from five to three each. These embrasures were constructed, at their mouths, of date-tree trunks, fastened together. Most of the batteries were open at the gorge, the ground in the interior being covered with pits dug as shell traps. With the exception of these, there are no other defences near Muhammareh. The British force was composed of 5,000 men with 12 guns, 4 armed steamers, and two sloops o r war. At daybreak on ; 26th March 1857 the British guns opened fire upon the Persian batteries, which were silenced in less than an hour. The troopships then advanced, passed the batteries amid musketry fire, and landed the troops under Sir H. Havelock. These drove the Persians out of the batteries (where al ,&gt;ne any of the enemy showed fight), and advanced through the palm-grove to wards the camp where the main Persian army was entrenched. The latter fled precipitately, abandoning their tents, stores, ammunition, and 16 guns. For this the Persian officers were afterwards publicly disgraced by order of the Shah, being dragged along the ranks by rings through their noses, beaten, and cast into prison. Their leader, Khanlar Mirza, however, having made a present of £8,000 to the Prime Minister, received a sword and a robe of honour. The camp of the second division of the British-Peus’an Expeditionary Force was pitched in 1857 on the open ground, at a distance of about 1.300 \aids south of the Iiaffar, facing the north, the prevailing winds being east and west. * «MUH—MUH 685 In 1870 the Shah ordered the construction of fortifications round the town, and a mud wail, 12 feet in height and 2 feet in thickness, was built, but soon succumbed to the action of the wind and rain. The only sort of defence which Muhammareh now possesses (1905), be sides the miserable b ittery already mentioned of 5 miscellaneous brass field- pieces, overlooking the river towards the eastern end of the town, is a ruinous mud wall upon the landward side, which was built by the Persians in 1858 and suffered severely in the floods of 1896 : it runs at an unnecessary distance from the town, and its perimeter is so great in proportion to any force which the Persian Government could place at Muhammareh, as to render it value less even should it be repaired. The only representatives of the Persian army at Muhammareh are two artillery officers, with a dozen privates under them, who are in charge of the guns and of an arsenal that exists, at least in name. A British Vice-Consul was appointed to Muhammareh in the autumn of 1890, and the status of the eppointment raised to that of Consul in 1904- Inhabitants .—The inhabitants of Muhammareh are chiefly local Arabs belonging to the Hilalat, Bait Kan’an and Mutur divisions of the Muhaisin tribe ; but there are also numerous Arabs descended from Bahraini refugees, some natives of Dizful and Shushtar, a few merchants from other parts of Persia, about 40 families of Sabians, and a handful of Jews and oriental Christians. The total population is computed at 6,000. Selby found the Arabs of Muhammareh to be more active and less bigoted than the Turks. Accommodation for travellers is afforded by seven Husainiehs. These are buildings primarily set apart for the readings and lamentations which are obligatory on Shi’ahs at the Muharram, and as refuges for destitute strangers and pilgrims, but also serving as inns ; in one of them superior rooms can be had on payment. There are some Khans in Muhammareh, but these, instead of being hostelries, as in Turkish Arabia, are merely places of business, or warehouses where merchants store their goods. Trade and Industries .—Of the varied dngredi'ents that form the population of Muhammareh, the Bahrainis are mostly small shop-keepers and mechanics ; the Sabians are silver-smiths ; the Jews deal in Manchester goods ; and the Christians are clerks or lightermen. There are also two or three gunsmiths who repair rifles and revolvers. Muhammareh can now boast of five large bazars containing over 300 shops and of a grain-market, and large stocks of rice and dates are generally available. But more important than the local trade or industries of Muham mareh are its foreign commerce and its functions as a port. Of the foreign trade nominally belonging to Muhammareh, by far the greater part really depends on places upon the Karun and up-country The town is accessible to ocean-going steamers ; but, owing to the narrowness of the Karun and the consequent difficulty of swinging, they discharge their cargoes without leaving the Shatt-al-’Arab, opposite the village of Ma’muri. Cargoes, etc., are transhipped at Muhammareh to the river steamer of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and conveyed thus to Bandar Nasiri. The steamers of the British India Company call weekly at Muhammareh from Bombay,686 MUH—MUH and those of the Bombay and Persia Company occasionally, and in 1903 the town was visited, in addition to those, by 35 British and 4 Russian steamers from Europe. In 1904, 10 s^amers with cargo direct from Europe called, and of these 5 took car fe t&gt; ' i,, Europe. The total number of English boats which entered by sea in 1904 was 87, of which 63 cleared ; and of other nationalities 3 entered and 1 cleared. One river-steamer runs fortnightly to Bandar Nasirl (Ahwaz) in connection with the Ahwaz- Shushtar steamer. The freight from Muhammareh to Bandar Nasiri is 40 krdns (Rs. 10) per ton. The freight to London is from £1 to £1-7-0 per ton. The rate of exchange varies from about 56 krdns to 59 krdns to £1, or an average value of id. per krdn.

He exercises control over the once powerful tribe of Ka’b Arabs [vide this Gazetteer), whose head quarters are at Fallahieh. His position was, however, considerably weak ened when, in 1902, the control of the customs of the port was transferred to that of the now Belgian administrators, in exchange for a subsidy. The administrative arrangements and political interests of Muhammareh, being part of those of Southern ’Arabistan of which it is the capital, are described in the article on that province {vide this Gazetteer—’Arabistan, Southern). The town is nominally governed by a deputy of the Shaikh called the Naib-ul-Hukumeh, but in reality the Rais-ut-Tuj jar wields688 MUH—MUH greater powers ; all commercial cases are settled by him. Among private citizensthree Bahraini and two Shushtari Mujtahids are prominent. Climate. —Regarding the climate of Muhammareh writers have given widely varying descriptions. General Williams, in his report to Govern ment, dated 23rd October 1856, says :—“ The climate of Muhammareh from June to October is very deadly to Europeans, but during the remainder of the year it is well adapted to the operations of war.” Sir Henry Raw- linson agrees in this estimate, sayi/ g the climate “ is so pestilential, that the mortality among those who are obliged from any cause to reside in it during the hot season amounts to about 50 per cent. The cause of this unhealthiness is the marsh malaria produced by the decomposition of vege table matters under a burning sun, added to the great humidity of the atmosphere in the immediate vicinity of the sea.” Captain Holland remarks on the salubrity of Muhammareh as follows :— “ Accounts seem so contradictory as to the salubrity or otherwise of the climate during the hot season, that it would be impossible to form an opinion without personal experience. During the period the army have been encamped here, viz. , the month of April 1857, it was very healthy, the sick of the force averaging only from 2 to 3 per cent. The thermometer during the heat of the day ranged from 75° to 93°. The soil seems to retain moisture from the continued decomposition of both animal and vegetable matter, as in the Indus and Nile, and in ail deltas formed by deposits from rivers. The miasma arising from such a soil in the hot season alone would be sufficient cause for fever. All accounts seem to coincide as regards the salubrity of the place during the cold season, viz. , from the beginning of October to the end of March.” Captain Selby, however, entertains a different opinion from the rest of our authorities regarding the salubrity of this place. “ Besides, ” he says, “ the advantages which Muhammareh, considered either as a military post or commercial city, possesses, its great salubrity is of vast importance in a country so low and flat as the delta of the Euphrates ; and I am enabled, from a personal knowledge of it for some years, to bear witness to its superior ity in this respect over any other part of the adjacent country; so much so that when, during the hot months, duty called me from Baghdad to the town of the Basrah or its vicinity, I invariably remained at or near Mu hammareh ; to which, in a great measure, I attribute the entire absence of that deadly fever which commit-, ed such havoc in the second expedition, under Captain Lynch, at its outset, and which can only be ascribed to its having been compelled to remain so long at Basrah. I may further adduce as a proof that, during the fifteen months I commanded the steamers Euph rates and Assyria, I only lost two men—one from an accident, the other in consequence of a chronic disease of seven years’ standing.” Curzon mentions a report that 40 per cent, of the then 2,000 inhabitants were swept away by cholera in 1889 ; and in June and July 1901 this disease was epidemic in Muhammareh, so much so that many of the merchants left the town, and business was at a standstill; the disease spread through the province, which was not clear of it until the end of Novemb r. The insanitary state of the town no doubt accounts for much sickness which is attributed to “ climate.”MUH—MUH 689 Resources and Su VV Kes.-Vor water see 6 ^”[ Muhammar f h stocks of rice and dates are generally available m the ^ ot town.

Communications. —Three main routes ieave Muhamrmreh ^ (1) Muhammareh-Ahwaz-Isfahan through the Bakhtian h , ’ 24 stages. There is a saving of time in this route compared with that from Bushire. Should sufficient caravans pass to keep the snow beaten do , there is no reason why this road should be closed in winter as it no w is. (2) Muhammareh-Dizful-Khurramabad, 330 miles, 25 stages. T be pcft runs by this route, but it is often unsafe for merchandise on account of the lawlessness of the tribes between Dmful and Khurramabad. In 1904 the post courier was frequently stopped and relieved of ? a ^ °f hlS mer Shuslitar-Dizful road is also sometimes unsafe, especially m the months, when the Bakhtiari are in the mountains.

MUND or HAND or KAKA AGHACH (River)— The upper course of this river in Fars is s_omewhat imperfectly known. It is called, by Ross, in its upper part, Kara Aghaeh and is said to rise near Kudian, north-west of Shiraz, it is supposed at a place called Bun Rud. It thus would have a course of at least 300 miles. Nothing definite, however, was known about it for a long time, except at the points where all travellers from Bushire to Shiraz cross it at Khan-i-Zinian, and at Kavar on the Shiraz-Firuzabad road where it seems to have the name of the Kahwah river ; also near Mubarakabad, where it was crossed by Abbott going from Darab to Kazarun. Below this point and its outlet, the. sea, nothing was known of the river until the discovery of a map executed by Haji Mirza Saiyid Hasan, physician to the Governor of Behbehan, who had some know ledge of surveying, and who compiled the map during 12 years’ travel in Fars. The name Kara Aghach has two significations ; “ black wood”, which is a literal translation of the Turkish word : but, besides this, it is the Turkish name for the elm tree. No district of precisely this name having been known by geographers hitherto, the derivation of the name, as applied to the river, has been in doubt; but in the HajI’s lAap referred t^, there is a Sahra (pZam)-i-Kara Aghach, south-east of Karzin. At Khan-i-Zinian,'where the river is 6,100 feet above the sea-level, it is a clear mountain stream crossed by a stone bridge. From here the river flows south-east between the Kuh-i-Sabz Pushan on the east, and the Kuh-i-Karach, Kuh-i-Mureh, and the mountain of Kuh Dalu on the west. As it enters the Kavar plain by a defile, a stone dam has from time im memorial diverted some of its waters to supply the canal which irrigates the plain. This dam is necessary as the level of the water is considerably below that of the adjoining plain. The Shiraz-Firuzabad road crosses the river near here by an imposing bridge of several arches, the causeway of which, although less than 20 years old, was reported in 1889 as already in ruins. The river probably continues east-south-east along the north flank of the Kuh-i-Safid to the village of Asmangird where it turns south, and forming a loop, doubles almost on its track, under the southern side of the same mountain to Badagan. Here it turns south again and shortly afterwards receives one of its principal tributaries, a stream which, rising north-east of Jehrum, flows in a westerly direction and joins the Kara Aghach between Tadavan and Mubarakabad. Near Mubarakabad the river is a strong, turbid stream, 60 yards wide, and flows between high banks. It is crossed by a very curious two-storey ed bridge, the roadway being in the second storey. The centre of the bridge, which is called the Pul-i-’Arus or “Bride’s Bridge ” stands 40 feet above the stream, but the flood mark is halfway up the piers. The Kara Aghach is probably the river which Abbott crossed 344 miles from Mubarakabad on the road to Firuzabad. Abbott found this river “flowing north and south for a short space, about 100 yards in breadth, and in parts nearly up to the •694 MUN—MUN horses* girths”. After forming a loop to the south-east round the hills,the Kara Aghach turns west about Kirda, and flows along the southern limit of the Qashqal country ; but nothing is known of this part of its route until it reaches the vicinity of a place called Pas-i-Rudak in longitude 52° 15'. At this point it is joined by the Firuzabad river, which, rising north of the town of the same name, has a southerly course and flows west to Baba Naim to join the main stream. A little east of Pas-i-Rudak another tributary from the south-east also reinforces the Kara Aghach. This stream rises east of, and flows past, ’Ala-Marvdasht on the Bushire-Lar road. Butcher who saw it in March and April, miles out of ’ Alamarvdasht, gives it the same name as that village, and says that the breadth of the bed of the river was 92 yards'; of the water itself, which is brackish, 13 yards ; depth 6 inches ; while the banks, which are of limey clay are about 30 to 40 feet in ^ Near Baghan on the Bushire-Lar road the Kara Aghach is joined by the river Riz {q.v.), and a little farther on by another tributary from the north. It is from this point apparently that the river assumes the name of Mund. 64 miles from Shumbeh towards Baghan the Bushire-Lar road crosses the river, which here runs under steep banks,15 feet high on the north- side. The current (March and April 1888) is very rapid, the flow being from eastward. At 120 yards from the north bank the actual water channel, which has a breadth of 60 yhrds, commences. The southern bank slopes gently up for 100 yards from the water to a low range of hills. The ford, during the same months, was 4 feet deep; but a very short distance lower down the water deepens rapidly, and man and horse would be carried away if they tried to cross. Natives say that an ancient bridge once spanned the river here, and remains of masonry near the ford add weight to their statement. The general direction of the river now is north-west, running west of, and nearly parallel to, the road until it finally emerges from the hills in the district of Dashti, about 7 miles north of the town of KazI, turning as it does so the north-western corner of Kuh-i- Namak. From this place it runs due west for 7 miles to the village of Chaghapur, where it receives on its right bank the whole drainage oftheKhurmuj valley. From Chagha- pur it runs south for 17 miles skirting the inland flank of the Kuh-i- Mand, then swings round the southern extremity of this range and runs west for another 15 miles to its estuary, the Khur Ziarat, which is 65 miles south-east of the town of Bushire. At the point where the track between Kkurmuj and Kaki crosses it the stream is 120 yards wide, and in winter is not as a rule traversable except on a craft; at times, however, even in that season, it is not more than 3| feet deep. Forty years ago (1865) it could be ascended by native craft of 40 or 50 tons burden almost as far as Kaki, and after rain it discharges a large volume of water into the sea. The water is slightly brackish even in the cold weather, and in summer it is unfit for human use unless in an emergency. Khur Ziarat, which forms the river’s mouth, is a small creek with low banks which can be entered by boats at high water, but the entrance is ex posed. For a short distance to the north of it, and for some 20 miles to * f southward, the coast of the main land is swampy.This river, the Kara Aghach in its upper reaches, and the Mund in the lower part of its course, was known to the ancients as the Sitakus or Sition- agus ;the earliest mention of it is made by Arrian (in his “Indica”, chapter 38), who quotes from Alexander’s admiral, Nearchos, who made the voyage from the Indus to the Euphrates. Next comes Ptolemy (second century A.D.), whose knowledge of the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf was evidently based on log-books from the time of the Ptolemean dynasty in Egypt and the first Roman Emperors. The Arabic Geographers knew the river well, and described its course with great accuracy, as it exemplified by Ishta- khri’s “ Kitab-ul-Mamalik Wal-Masalik.” It was Colonel Ross, however, who, in his report on the administration of the Persian Gulf Residency for 1877-1878, placed beyond ail doubt the identity’ of the Kara Aghach with the Mund river.— (Ross — Stack — Abbott — Butcher, 1888 — Curzon, 1889 —Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.)

There is a small fort, and 200 yards to the north are a few Mar trees, while 600 yards to the south, on the road, is a built-over well of fresh water In the hot weather Arabs under Shaikh Farhan Asad of the Kathir come here for pasturage, and k shallow wells in a dry watercourse beside the village. PERSEPOLIS or TAKHT-I-JAMSHlD —Lat. 29° 58' N. Long. 52° 54 E. Elev. 5,500'. _ Situated on the plain of Marvdasht, some 40 miles north-east of Shiraz and not far from where the river Pulvar flows into the Kur. structure is a large terrace with its east side resting on the Kuh-.-Kahma^ The other three sides are formed by a retaining wall varying m height from 14 to 41 feet; and on the west side a magnificent double stair leads the top. On this terrace stand and lie the ruins of a number of colossal buddmg? all constructed of calcareous limestone, resembling mar e, ® ... - neighbouring mountain. These ruins, for which the name Chehi can be traced back to the 13th century, are now known as the Takht-i-Jam- shid. That they represent the Istakhr or Persepolis, captured and part ially destroyed by Alexander the Great, is beyond dispute. It has bee ascertained from the inscriptions that some of the edifices a* 6 th e “ Darius I, Xerxes and Artaxerxes III. The ruins on the platform consist of-(l) The porch of Xerxes; (2) Hall of Xerxes; (3) Palace of Dams &lt; 4 ) Palaoe of Artaxerxes III; (5) Palace of Xerxes ; (6) South-east edifice, (7) Hall of 100 columns. Behind the Takht-i-Jamshid are three tombs hewn out of the rock in the hillside, the fapades bmg «chly ornamented with reliefs. They are probably those of Artaxerxes II, B. G. 361 , ArtaxerxesIll B. C. 338 and I&gt;arms III, B. C. 330. Beneath the ruins are a large number of underground passages, which, it is conjectured, were oiigimlly used as water-channels. About 2 miles distant from the Takht-i-Jarnshid, near the nerth- eastern extremity of the plain and close to the post-house of Puzeh-i-Takht- i-Jamshid, in a small natural recess in the base of the cliff, are situated the sculptures of the Naksh-i-R ijab. They were mutilated by order of the Shah Safi I to discourage European visitors. The tablets consists of (1) and (2) Ormuz and Ardeshir; (3) Shapur and body-guard. On the opposite side of the Pulvar and at the western extremity of the Husain Kuh rises a perpendicular wall of rock, called by the Persirns the Aaksh-i-Rustam. The sculptures can be seen from the post-hous' of Puzeh, which is about miles distant. There are seven bas-reliefs at the san a A Verahan and queen; (2) and (3) Equestrian combats, \r Vt Sha P ur and Valerian, 260 A. D. ; (5) Equestrian combat; (6) Verahan H and his courtiers ; (7) Orm U z and Ardeshir Hewn out of the rock of the cliff are four tombs. From the inscription it is known that the second from the east is that of the Great Darius, B. C. 485. The others are probably thetombsof Xerxes, B. C. 465. Artaxerxes I, B. C. 424, and anus II, B. C. 405. Opposite the third and fourth tombs, on a slight elevation, rises a square building called at various times the Naqqareh aneh and the Kaa beh-i-Zardusht. Its origin is problematical. I he surviving ruins of Istakhr, in which were the bazars, etc., fall into two groups those on the banks of the Pulvar, a little before it em e ges into the plain of Marvdasht between Persepolis and the Naksh-i-Rustam, and those of the hill fortress on the central, pointed hill of the Seh Gumbadan, situated some 7-8 miles north-west of the Takht-i-Jamshid, on the adjoining p ain^ o Ivhafrak. The former consist of a great gateway, and the remains of a fire temple at Hajiabad. which was used in later times as a mosque ; the latter of the ruins of the citadel, a gateway, and three re servoirs. n the 10th century Istakhr had become an utterly insignificant place, and during the following centuries it gradually declined until, as a city, it ceased to exist. One mile north of Hajiabad the cliff is pierced by several natural ca_verns. In the entrance of one of these, known as the Tang-i-Shah-Sar- van, are five tablets, two of which bear inscriptions, containing the cele- braced bi-hngual epigraph of Shapur I. —( Curzon — Arbuthnot, 19v5.)

A bridge over the Karkheh river in Luristan! The name signifies the “ Bridge of the Chasm,” and it is a most remarkable spot; the broad stream of the Karkheh, in general about 80 or 100 yards wide here, for the space of 300 paces, forces its way through a narrow chasm, which a bold cragsman may spring across with ease. Indeed, Rawlinson mentions having seen a Kurd do so, though it was rather nervous to look at him, for the crags are very slippery, and had he missed his footing, he must have been dashed to pieces. The cleft is now about 159 feet in depth; the sides are honeycombed in the most fantastic manner, as though the chasm had been gradually worn down in the rock by the action of the water, and the river boils and foams below, in its narrow bed, as we might fancy Styx or Phlegethon did. A little arch has been thrown across the cleft, which forms the great thoroughfare ; for the Lur nomads in their passage between their summer pastures near Khurramabad and the warm places beyond the Karkheh, where they encamp in the winter. It is believed to have been by this bridge that Anti- gonous passed the Karkheh in his memorable retreat from Badaca across the mountains into Media.

It rises to the north-west of Deh Bid, and flows with many remarkable changes of direction in a course728 PUL—PITS' - generally south and south-west. The caravan route from Shiraz to Isfahan crosses it by a broad masonry bridge of 5 arches, near the old serai of Khan-i-Kargian between D h Bid and Mashad-i-Murghab. The river on its way waters the plains of Murghab, Marvdasht and Haji- abad. Turning south-south-west the river and road coincide through the Tang-i-Bulakai (q.v.),. It is crossed again by the road between Quvvamabad and Savand, 64 miles from Shiraz. An old masonry bridge, which formerly spanned the river here, is now in ruins ; and a ford, barely passable by infan try replaces it; Newcomen reports the river as running strong and reaching to his saddle flaps when he crossed. The Pulvar finally falls into the Band Amir at Pul-i-Khan, about 30 miles north of Shiraz. In the valley of the Pulvar, between 80 and 90 miles north of Shiraz, are extensive ruins reputed to be those of the ancient city of Pasargadae and, on an adjoining plain, the tomb of Cyrus.— (Curzon, 1889 — Newcomen, 1905 — Arbuihnot, 1905.) PURDGHAR vide PULGHAR. PUSHT-I-KUH (1)— A division of the tribe of Fail! Lurs, who inhabit the district of Lur-i- Kuchak in the north of Luristan. They are said to number 15,000 families. While the Pish Kuh have been brought under the Government of Isfahan, the Pusht-i-Kuh are still nomi nally under the Vali. They are less united than the Bakhtiari, but similar in race and religion. They are said to be able to muster 5,000 horse and 20,000 foot. The Pusht-i-Kuh tribes are divided as follows :— Families.

Local conditions of the Pusht-i-Kuh region. ^ Charduvar, situated in the valley at the foot of the Vardalan Pass, con sists of a few huts, where N, i Khuda dwells, on whom devolves the duty of dispensing hosp'tality to the Khans’ visitors. This valley although fertile and watered by small streams is but little cultivated and at first sight would seem to be uninhabited 5 only by the gorges are scattered small groups of the various Luristan tribes, who live here from springs until autumn and then migrate for the winter to the lowlands to the south-west, on the Turkish frontier. The steep slopes of the lofty ridges of this region are covered with thin oak forest. In the valleys there is no vegetation. The rivers are all ford able, with stony beds. The roads are awful, in fact they are not roads but paths, difficult both for pack animals and pedestrians. The Vardalan Pass is impracticable for wheeled traffic or field artillery. From Charduyur a track ascends a fairly considerable ridge; at a distance of one geographical mile from the ddf|| of Nianun it descends into the valley. Passing the defile it ascends the slopes of the Manisht Mountain,729 PUS-PUZ - the summit of which towers above some 2,000—3,000 feet, and eventually again descends into the valley, where a building has been constructed ^in, the form of a caravanserai named Kakh or more generally Deh Bala. The Khan spends the winter here in tents, the locality being known as Emele (?). From here an easy road or rather pathway leads to Khur- ramabad and meets a road from Khurramabad to Dizful, whence an enemy could execute a flank movement and attack with the co-operation of the Lurs of Pusht-i-Kuh, operating on the flank of an army moving south c along the main line of communication. Hence this region acquires a certam importance. The locality generally is practicable for operations of a detachment of infantry, cavalry and mountain artillery with pack transport. Supplies and forage are obtainable locally, but not -n any great quantity. From an adjacent peak a general view of the Pusht-i-Kuh region is obtained. Lower down to the south-west, there is an important pass the Ban-i- Sir’, over which runs the road from Deh Bala to the lowlands cn the Turkish frontier. Both in character and mode of life the inhabitants resemble the other tribes of Lunstan. PUSHT-I-KUH (2)— One of the two main divisions of the Kuhgalu Lurs.

An island in the Persian Gulf; still of considerable and in former times of great importance ; it is situated 11 miles off the coast of the Shlbkuh dis trict, slightly nearer to Chira than to Charak, being divided from the main land by a fine channel from 20 to 30 fathoms deep. Qais, in its conform ation resembles an oval, and slightly convex, stud : it measures about 10 miles in length from west to east by 4| in breadth and rises from the coast to a plateau in the interior which is 120 feet above sea-level. The shores of the island are low and the beach sandy with rocky points ; eastwards and westwards Qais ends in very low cliffs. The island is encompassed by a reef which is nowhere more than a mile broad and has deep water immediately outside it. The general colour of the island is alight brown and is bare of vegetation, except a few scattered date-groves and some stunted herbs. The water-level is high, and near the beach, in he locality called Sar Masheh, sweet water can be obtained by digging to a depth of between 1 and 4 feet. 4Z2732 ' QAI—QAI The island contains the following villages :— Houses Remarks.

They possess only a score of modern rifles among them. Some cultivation of dates, wheat and barley is carried on by means of irrigation from wells ; onions, cucumbers, water-melons and musk-melons are also grown; but the principal resources are fishing and pearling. In summer the population is consider ably increased by an influx from the Arabian and Persian coasts generally. There are 26 large pearl-boats which go to the pearl-banks on the Arabian side in the season, and 67 small baqdrehs and shu’ais which are used for fishing in winter, and in summer for pearling off the coast of the island itself ; there is also some general trade. To the island belong 3 trading baghlahs which make voyages to Basrah, Bahrain, India and even Yaman. The bazar at Masheh contains about 50 shops and 9 commercial ware houses. About 20 Hindus, British subjects, are settled here as shop-keeper^ and pearl merchants, while about 10 more sojourn temporarily in the island during the pearl season. Pearl-boats working in the vicinity call at Masheh twice or thrice during the diving-season, to dispose of their takings and replenish their stock of provision and water. Qais island was till lately understood to belong to the Shaikh of Charak, who is locally represented by an agent or deputy, at the present time, his nephew. The residence of the deputy is a fort built about 1900 A. D. at Sar Masheh. The com- parativi wealth of the Shaikh of Charak is attributed to his possession of Qais. Towards the end of 1906, however, it became known that the Quvvam-ul-Mulk of Shiraz and his family claim absolute ownership over the island. From the antiquarian standpoint Qais is interesting on account of its ruins, probably those of the ancient Muhammadan town of Harireh, which lines the northern coast for about half a mile midway between the villages of Deh and Safil. These ruins are of less extent than the supposed ruins of Siraf at Tahiri, and consist now merely of mounds of stone and fragments of masonry. A mosque, however, which was of well-cut stone, had one minaret standing until about 50 years ago ; the pillars of this mosque were octagonal in section, and the blocks of which they were composed were mortised together by central tenons. There are remains of several large, oblong water-reservoirs formerly vaulted over, two of which measured 150 feet by 40 feet and in 1857 were still 24 feet deep. Near these began a fine qandt nearly half a mile in length, cut in the solid rock and running at its deeper end 20 feet beneath the surface : it had about 40 shafts at intervals of 15 to 20 yards apart, and the bottom of the shaft was acces sible in four instances by a stairway of shallow steps cut in the rock. Qais suffered severely from the depredations of Arab pirates at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and a British military station for a time existed here .—(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) b q QAlZ—vide QEHlZ.

They are of Turk origin, and tradition has it that they are the descendants of a race transplanted by the Mongol Halaku Khan fromKashgar. In manners, customs and features, they resemble the Bakhti- ari and Kuhgalu Lurs. Of migratory habits, they are scattered pretty well over the whole of Ears, winter in the garmslr or warm region of the coast fringe known as Dashtistan, and in Luristan on a line stretching from Behbehan on the north-west, to Bandar Abbas on the south-east. AH the pastures on this line do not, of course, belong to them and are shared with others, but no confusion results, as the boundaries of each section or tribe are well defined and known by long accepted custom and recognized landmarks. Their summer resorts are the highlands between Isfahan and Shiraz. The move up from the winter lowlands occurs ten days after Nauruz (21st March), and down from the highlands at the end of October. From their proximity to Shiraz and Isfahan, the Qashqai are more Numbers and administra- under Persian domination than other nomad )in - tribe and are more heavily taxed. Before the years of famine and scarcity, 1869-71, the Qashqai were said to number 50,000 tents, but at this time they suffered heavily, and the dis persion in search of food for families and flocks, in many cases a permanent migration, greatly reduced their numbers. General Gordon in 1892 esti mated them at 10,000 tents only. Their reduction in number tells in favour of the remaining families, as not only do they own extensive lands, arable and pasture, but they also have many rent-paying tenants. Their yearly tribute was assessed in 1892 at 30,000 tumdns. The Qash qai are under the control of an Ilkhani or chief, with an Ilbegi, or second- in-command. Muhammad QulI_Khan who died in 1885, is referred to by the Qash qai as the “Great Ilkhani, ” and under him the Qashqai were a powerful and united tribe. _On his death, much of his power, according to Colonel Bell, passed to the Ilbegi Darab Khan, who is mentioned as the virtual head of the tribe. At the time of General Gordon’s visit, however, the balance of power had apparently again inclined to the Ilkhani, Haji Nasrullah Khan, who succeeded his cousin, the son of the Great Ilkhani, in 1891. Haji Nasrullah Khan, described at that time as a pleasant mannered and capable man of about 50, owed his firm hold over the Qashqai to a great extent to the fact that he had married the sister of bis predecessor, thus uniting the considerable possessions of the two branches of the family in his own person. The present Ilkhan.I is Sculat-ud-Daulsh, who, says Chick, has about 2,000,000 men under his command, and is treated like a king in his tribe. Chick says that he is really a greater chieftain thsn the Bakhtiari Khans! In 1910 the Persian Government sent Soulat-ud-Daulah a 7-centimetre gun from Shiraz, but its weight would prevent its being used for anything except an attack on Shiraz. Although their chief wealth lies in the possession of flocks, the Qashqai are Resources. of agricultural as well as of pastoral habits. , , , . „ , The y 80w wheat and barley on the summer lands, nee in the low country. They allow the summer lands to lie fallow for one year. In the spring they plough and break up the fallow land, which they again run over with the plough in autumn, and then put in the seed just before the first fall of snow and their migration south.736 QAS—QAS Immediately on arrival at their winter quarters they lay down rice in cer- • tain places, which they gather before they leave. On their return to the high lands, they find their winter crops well above ground, and, as the weather warms, they attend to the irrigation of these. They reap in July and August. In the highlands, in the vicinity of Main fine walnut trees occur, and excel lent vineyards, carefully tended by Persian (Tajik) peasants, who pay rent to the Qashqai, are a noticeable feature of the Asupas valley. Raisins are largely made and the grapes are also exported. c The breed of horses, though strong and serviceable, shews no remarkable ' Horses quality. They average 14 hands 1 inchin height and are active, hardy, enduring, and surefooted. - The colts are sold when about 3 years old, the fillies only being kept. Bell places the price of a good horse at from 200 to 400 rupees. Valuable horses are only breed by the Ilkhani and his well protected relations; for . with others, immediately a very good colt is heard of, it is demanded by, . or for, some one in authority, and a colt or filly is not infrequently fired for some fictitious unsoundness in order to prevent its being claimed. The numbers owned by the tribe were in 1892 estimated at between 6.000 and 7,000, mostly mares. • Mules and donkeys are also owned and used for transport in the periodic Cattle ard sheep migrations. Camels arc not owned in large quantities. The fine breed of Qashqai cattle - are proverbial, and a hardy breed, owned by the Tajiks, generally black in colour, is used both for the plough and transport. Very large flocks of sheep and goats are owned. The former are of remarkable size, some times weighing as much as 140 lbs. The goats are chiefly black and red in colour. The wool of the sheep and goats is all required for the use of the tribe, who work it up into articles of clothing, camp equipage, horse cover ings, and carpets. The men are of medium height, light, active, and hardy. They are war- Fighting qualities and like in their traditions and tastes, good riders strength. and accustomed to firearms. The tribe could furnish good infantry also, men inured to hard work over rough country, and requiring but little transport for their few simple wants. General Gordon describes the horsemen encountered by him in 1892 as “ tough and rough irregulars mounted cn email, wiry horses.” Nasrullah Khan informed him ^ that he could furnish 5,000 horsemen with 1,000 Martinis among them, and . that in the next two years he counted on being able to arm the whole 5.000 with Martinis ; but subsequent enquiry and observation went to show that this statement was largely exaggerated, and that the Ilkhani could in reality count on from 1,000 to 2,000 horsemen with about 200 Martini rifles only. j738 QAS-QAT QASIMABAD (1)—Lat.

A village in the province of Ears. It is the 4th caravan and post stage from Shiraz (66 miles) on the post-road to Isfahan (260 miles). It is situ ated towards the western extremity of the valley of the same name. The village consists of some 100 inhabited houses, enclosed by lofty brick walls, 500 yards square, with towers at each corner. Its only entrance is by a gate way facing south and immediately opposite to the garden residence of the Quvvam. The latter is the hereditary title of the descendant of Haji Quv- vam, who was minister at Shiraz in the early part of the 19th century. Close to the village is the post-house, while about 200 yards farther to the west is a new and spacious caravanserai. The inhabitants numbering about 400 are truculent and uncivil. Water is supplied by qanats, which are inclined to be muddy and polluted in the immediate vicinity of the village. Precee states that 210,000 lb grain is sown yearly, and that there are 54 pairs of oxen for tillage.— (Trotter — Curzon—Preece &gt; 1892—-Newcomen, 1905 — Arbuthnot — Gibbon, 1908.) QUVVAMABAD— Lat.

The district consists of a plain about 80 miles long and 20 miles broad, lies roughly east and west, and receives on the north the drainage of the Kuh-i-Badaman mountains and on the south that of the ranges situated to the north of Pariz and Saidabad. The plain is a bare expanse of hard clay, and rises gradually from the east from about 4,700 to 5,500 feet. There are about 90 villages in the district with an aggregate population of about 60,000. Some 3,000 Jeharwars of cotton are produced, which (after deducting about 500 kharwdrs for home consumption) is p ’ exported to Russia via Shahrud, and to India via Bandar Abbas, in the proportion of about 9 to 1. Almost all transport is done by camels and donkeys, the former doing the journey from Rafsinjan to Bandar Abbas in 40 days, the latter in 25 days. The cost of carriage from Rafsinjan to Shahrud is 13 to 20 tumdns per kharwdr, as compared with 6| to 12 tumdns from Rafsinjan to Bandar Abbas. This difference in the cost of carriage is due, apart from the greater length of the Shahrud journey, to the fact that camels going to Shahrud have mostly to return empty, whilst those going to Bandar Abbas can always find loads to bring back. The cotton is short stapled. Attempts have been made to introduce a long-stapled cotton, but these (up to 1905) have met with no success, owing, it is thought, to the summer being too short. A considerable quantity of wool is produced by the nomad tribes, but is all used locally in the manufacture of carpets. The other chief products are :— Gum Tragacanth. —100,000 maunds produced. All sent to Londofi. Price, first quality, krdns 8 to 10 per maund. Opium. —500 to 600 maunds. All used locally. Price 12 tumdns per maund. Asafoetida .—About 100,000 maunds produced.

Leather. —There is a certain amount of inferior leather made locally. All sheepskins are retained mostly for turning into pushfins, etc. Goat-skins to the number of between 5,000 to 6,000 are sent down to Bandar Abbas, whence they find their way to the Arab coast. Imports. The chief imports of Rafsinjan are Cotton fabrics and prints. —The imports of grey goods and shirtings—• average, as far as could be ascertained, 20,000 pieces. Tea. —Almost entirely Lamsars. 15,000 to 20,000 lbs. annually. Sugar. —Loaf, some 50,000 J batmans yearly, at 4£ to 5J krdns per batman. Crystal, about 40,000 batmans yearly, at 3| to 4 krdns per batman. Kerosine oil .—500 to 600 cases, at 35 krdns per case. Candles. —About the same amount, at 35 krdns per box of 30 lb. Silks (Persian), glassware (Austrian), china (Persian and English), enamelled ware (Russian), spices (Indian), iron, copper and tin sheets (English), cutlery (English and Belgian), umbrellas (Indian), and cheap, flash ornaments (mostly Austrian and German) are imported also in quantity to fill the stalls of a fairly large bazar. Some 15 miles north of Bahramabad there is an opening into an under ground river, the Chah-i-Daiia, the waters of which, if tapped, would be available to largely increase the area under cultivation. A customs house has been established for the prevention of ‘ gun- running. ” The district is not without interest from an antiquarian point of view, as iron spear-heads, a foot long with a broad point, are often picked up. Twenty-eight degrees (Fahr.) of frost were registered about Christmas 1905. —( Stack—Preece , 1892—Sykes, 1903—Newcomen, 1905.) RAHAlMANlYEH— Lat. Long. Elev.

Pelly says a road here branches off towards Kanzak and leads up to the Gisehkan: and also that there is a path from here by Bagh-i-Dard to the Gisehkan pass over the mountain of the same name.

The plain of the same name is to the west of Persepolis.— {Wilson, 1907.) RAMLEH— Lat. Long. Elev. A place marked by sand-hills on the Ram Hormuz plain, Khuzistan, to the left of the road from Shakheh to the village of Ram Hormuz. It was for merly the residence of the Shaikh of Ram Hormuz.—(Raring.) RAMUZ— Lat. SUREN. Long. Elev. Also called Ram Hormuz and Suq Ram Hormuz, is the chief town of the district of the same name. It stands 2 or 3 miles from the right bank of the Ramuz river about 12 miles above its junction with the Kurdistan river, and is situated about 48 miles due east of, and 60 miles by road from, Ahwaz. The hills of the Bakhtiari country begin about 2 or 3 miles north of the place. Ramuz is a thriving place, its position, at a point where several rivers meet and at the foot of a gorge leading through the mountains to Shiraz, making it naturally a place of importance. It consists of about 600 houses ; most of these are of mud, but a few are of brick and plaster, the latter being the property of the Bakhtiari Khans who reside at Ramuz in winter. The population is about 3,000 souls, and consists entirely of a class of mixedorigin who are described as Ahl-i-Ramuz. There are about 100 indifferently supplied shops, partly collected in a vaulted hazar^ 100 yards in length, and partly scattered through the town. There are also two water-mills. Wood, fuel and charcoal are cheap. The plain to the south-east is cultivated and irrigated. Two miles to the south is a fine house of the Sipahdars built in 1900. Several good gardens already exist on the south side of the town and others are being laid out on the north side. The trees are dates, oranges, pomegrantes, figs, lemons and vines. Irrigation is from a canal which takes out of the Ramuz river near its exit from the hills, and about 5 miles east of the town. The water is fresh and good, and is used for drinking. There are also wells, said to be about 50 feet deep, but they are little used. Ramuz town is the chief centre of trade in the district and here the produce of the adjacent hills finds a market. Messrs. Lynch Bros, have an agency at Ramuz in charge of a native. There is a Persian Government Telegraph to Nasiri on the one side and to Behbehan on the other. There is no post office. The town appears to have covered at one time an area much greater than that which it occupies to-day. It possesses two shrines; one, the Haft Tanan, in the north-east corner of the town among some date palms ; the other the ’Alamdar, with a tapering dome, in the outskirts, north of the centre of the town. The bulk of the exports from Ramuz are corn, rice, etc. Messrs. Lynch Bros, sell only iron and sugar. Merchants bring tea, English cloth, etc., from Shushtar and Wais. Ramuz in the 10th century A.D., was a prosperous place, famous for its raw silk. There were excellent markets and a fine Jama’ mosque built by the Buyids. It possessed also a celebrated library. The name Ram Hormuz, received from King Hormuz, grand-son of Ardashir Babakan, was already in the 14th century A.D. generally shortened to Ramuz *. (Fars-nameh —Burton. 1903 —Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) RAMUZ or RAM HORMUZ (District.) The easternmost district of ’ Arabistan ; it is attached for fiscal purposes to the northern division of that province, and may therefore be reckoned, though administered separately from the rest, to belongto Northern’Arab istan. Boundaries. The Ramuz district is bounded along its north-eastern side, beginning at some naphtha springs, known as Naft-i-Safid, at its northern corner, by the Kuh-i-Gach range, which reaches to the Ramuz river ; its south eastern corner is on the Marun river, above Jaizan, which is included in the district. From Jaizan the boundary runs at a short distance from the left bank of the Martin to a point Cham ManI’ on the Jarrahi, 3 miles below the confluence of the Ramuz and Martin rivers. From Cham Mani’ thence it is continued to the low, mud and rock hills through which the Jarrahi reaks above Cham Sabi, crosses that river and, following the same hills, arrives at a point on the Ramuz-Nasiri route on the eastern verge of the Bu’- ainsh plain, and about 9 miles east of the village of Mirbacheh. The *Vide Le Strange.RAM—RAM 751 remainder of he boundary ia a line connecting Bu’airish with the naphtha springs mentioned above this line crosses the Ghpal stream about four miles above the barrage on the same. Physical Characteristics —district is a fertile plain, about one-half of which is said to be watered by various streams and springs. The most important of the streams are the Ramuz river (or upper course^of the Jarrahi) between its exit from the hills and its junction with the Marun, and a short section of the Jarrahi proper between that junction and its exit from the dis trict, also the Marun river, which is the principal feature of the south-eastern portion of the district. The Gupal stream, which traverses a part of the dis trict north of the Ramuz-Nasiri mad, the Jarrahi and Marun rivers are de scribed under separate articles. It remains to mention the Zarnini andMuw- wailheh streams which are features of some importance in the neighbourhood of Mirbacheh. The Zarnini or Zarini is crossed about 4 miles from Ramuz on the way to Mirbacheh. At that point it is (in winter) a swiftly flowing stream of fresh water, 1 to 2 yards broad and 2 to 3 feet deep, with per pendicular banks 4 to 5 feet high except at the crossing place, and its course east to west-south-west. The subsequent course of the Zamini is uncertain ; a good deal of it is probably expended in irrigation, but it has been identified conjecturally with the fresh water stream of the same size, which passes a mile to the east of Mirbacheh village flowing in a north westerly direction ; possibly, however, it goes southward to the Jarrahi river. The Muwailheh is a salt stream, crossed about 2 miles west of Mirbacheh on the way toNasiri. At that place it is running to the north west, its bed is 200 to 300 yards across, and on the left bank, which is scarped, there are stony hillocks rising as much as 80 feet above the level of the water. The stream here resembles a canal and hugs the left bank of its channel; its average breadth is 10 yards, but even in winter a place was observed where its breadth was only 4 yards, and its depth, nevertheless, did not exceed 1£ feet. About 5 miles from the crossing place the Muwailheh falls into the Gupal. Besides these two streams in the neighbourhood of Mirbacheh, springs of fresh water are said to exist 10 or 12 miles to the south or south-east of that village. People. The inhabitants of the Ramuz district are chiefly Ahl-i-Ramuz a local breed, of mixed Arab, Lur, Behbehani and Qana \ ati blood, who are related to the surrounding population much as Dizfulis and Shushtaris are to the tribes in the districts of Dizful and Shushtar. The Lurs, who are the next most numerous, are chiefly Chehar Lang Bakhtiari, including Shir »Alis and Galavaris, or Kuhgalu of the Bagdali, Bahmai, Bair Ahmadi, Agha Jari and Taibi section. The balance of the population are Arabs or Saiyids. The Arabs belong chiefly to the Hamid, A1 Khamls and Ban! Lam tribes, and are mostly settled or semi-settled cultivators. It is cal culated that among the Lurs, one half of the fighting men are armed with rifles and one-fifth mounted. Ramuz town is the principal place in the district; a conspectus of the vil lages is given at the end of this article. The total population of the district is probably about 12,000 souls, and inclusive of the Al Khaims, only a few of whom, though the tribe is now semi-settled, appear in the table of villages t below. r752 RAM—RAM Agriculture. Rice, sesame, cotton,wheat,barley,beans,linseedandto- bacco are ^dueed^iidtbe fruits grown include dates, oranges, sweet and bitter limes, pomegranates, plums, grapes, apples, figs, quinces, citrons apricots, pears and almonds ; the fruits, except grapes, are mostly of re- ^t introduction. The district, under its present judicious managers, the Rakhtian Khans, promises to improve in every mspect and is attracting settlers from every direction, especially from the Jarrahi region and farther ^ ^ IG J 1,,S driven by Water P° wer in the district. Ihe ordinary unit of land measurement in the district is the khlsh or area which requires 5 Ramuz mans of wheat or 3 of barley to sow it ’ As the thickness of the sowing varies with the nature of the soil, the khish can not be expressed in terms of acreage.

Exportation takes place direct to Mas in and Muhammareh, but nearly all imports—mz niece- goods, metals, sugar, tea, coffee, spices, crockery and candles—are received through Nasm ; the more highly taxed of these commodities, however as also prohibited articles such as fire arms and ammunition, are brought by muleteers from ports such as Fallahieh, Ma’shur.Hindian and Dihfm JflO^En^r 8mUggMfr0 “ abr0ad ' ^ Kfimua » ^ Administration.—The district is subject to the rule of the Bakhtiari Khans, who also enjoy its revenues subject to a yearly payment of 15 000 into the Persian treasury at Shushtar.

Between the Ras-ul-Mutaf and the mainland is another deep shoal with yet another channel inside. The inner channel is called Khur Umm-ul-Karam from the name of a small island at its head ; the outer is perhaps called Khan.

ShaikhRIS-RIZ 760; Husain, a Bahraini, who was chief Mullaof Bushire 40 or 50 years ago, used to live here in the summer, as did also his two immediate successors, Shaikh Khalaf and Shaikh ’Abdul ’All. On the coast, J of a mile west of the village, are the ruins of the old fort, called by the natives Kaleh-i-Behman Shah. It is of Portuguese origin, having been built by them in the 16th century when they established a trading station here. They were expelled by the Persians after the capture of Hormuz in 1622. The fort was repaired in 1856 and occupied by Persian troops, who made a gallant but ineffectual resistance against the British, the latter losing four officers in the attack. It is in the form of a square with sides 300 yards long, and the ramparts still rise about 80 feet about sea- level. The site belongs to the Persian Government, and is surrounded by a ditch 70 to 100 feet wide, which is cultivated by forced labour, under the orders of the Governor of the Gulf Ports.— [Curzon, 1889 —Persian Gazetteer, 1908.)

The pass „ has an evil reputation during the summer months, whin, in the absence of the Bakhtiari Khans, marauding Arabs find it a convenient spot at which to loot caravans.— {Arbuthnot, 1905.) RlZ (1)—Lat. 28° 3' N. Long. 52° 6' E. Elev. 1.493'. A village in the Dashti district of Ears, 119 miles south-east from Bushire and the eighth stage on the road thence to Bandar Abbas. It contains a small mud and stone fort, and about 150 houses of mud, stone or mats. The inhabitants muster 500, of whom 100 are fit for service; they cultivate wheat and barley and own extensive date-groves, besides some small floeks of sheep and goats. The country is irrigated by streams and affords good grazing. The village, which is situated in a grassy valley, about 3 miles broad, stands on the river Riz, which furnishes it with a plentiful supply of good water. On the south side of the valley is the rocky Kuh Bahram Shah which presents, for the most part, a cliff-like section with a lower range of gravelly hills, 500 feet high, at its foot. One mile north of the village aie some low, rounded, sandstone hills. A good road from Riz enters the hills east-north-east, and leads via Kuh Baraftab to Pas-i-Rudak, 15 miles distant^ Another road enters the hills slightly east of south-east by east and leads to Dad-ul-Mizan, 18 miles distant. The sea port of Daiyir lies about 23 miles south-south-west over hilly country.— {Ross — Butcher, 1888.) RIZ (2) (River)— This river appears to commence under the name of Riz from a very shallow and pebble-covered basin about 500 yards broad, to the north east of Kuh Puzeh Padri near Jam. Its course is nearly identical with the BandarRIZ-RIZ 761 Abbas—Bushire road between Jam and Bagban, a distance by road of some 45 miles. The south bank of the river touches the road some 6 miles from. Jam, and here forms a cliff from 50 to 100 feet in height. It receives many rivulets on its course, but all are of inconsiderable depth. A little more than 10 miles from Jam the river is crossed by the main road, and here, in March and April 1888, had only a depth of 6 inches and a breadtli of 25 feet. The basin is very shallow and wide, and the southern side is' covered with a dense jungle of tamarisk. Farther on at 15 miles from Jam the west bank is perpendicular and some 20 feet high. The main road cross es here, as it does again 2| miles farther. At both these crossings, in the months mentioned, the river bed was dry ;it has at the last named crossing a breadth of 50 to 60 yards, and the west bank has increased in height to between 30 and 40 feet. Outside Riz village the road again crosses the river by a ford, the depth of water being 6 inches, breadth 20 feet, and general direction east to west. Just beyond Riz, the river is 2 to 3 feet deep and flow ing from south to north. The road again crosses here by a ford. The bed of the river, being gravelly and stony, is always firm,and the depth, which is usually only a few inches, is stated to never exceed 3 feet. At 2£ miles from Baghan the road again crosses the river by a ford, the banks here being shelv ing. Finally Baghan is reached, standing on a narrow spit of land of which; the west face is washed by the river Riz. The cliff here is 36 feet high,, and the river, which runs north-west, is about 20 yards broad and of its normal depth. Thy river here is sometimes called the Baghan. The river is forded once more, for the last time, some H miles beyond Baghan and short ly after runs into the Mund river, and loses its identity as a separate stream.— (Ross — Botcher, 1888.)

Between this and the next stage to the west, Kabutar Khan, there is a tract of country which is liable to inundation. This is shown on the survey of India maps as a swamp, but it was quite dry when Wood passed in the month of October, and he gathered from the inhabitants that it was only after very exceptionally heavy rain that any water col lected here. The plain is perfectly flat and stretches from hill to hill some 8 miles, and acts as a sort of basin : it is not a marsh. The Central Persian Telegraph line skirts its southern edge, When under water, the going is very sticky and trying. There is no necessity to pass through this ground, which is known as the Daqq-i-Kabutar Khan, as, by hugging the hills on the north and passing through Bakilabad and Qasimabad, firm and secure ground would be traversed. The village, which has a good caravanserai and a large and well-built db-dmbar, consists of about 300 houses, with a population of 700, and belongs to Saiyids. Extensive cultivation surrounds it, and it is watered by 4 qandts, the water of which is slightly brackish. Near the serai there is a hauz with excellent water. The crops consist of 30,000 mans of wheat and barley, 5,000 mans of millet, 3,oOO mans bhusd, 2,500 mans of cotton, and 2,500 maps of beetroot. Wood scarce.

At the exit are a spring and stream of good water, and a garden belonging to the village.— {Abbott — Stotherd, 1893.) RtjDBlR {l)—Vide BAZUFT (AB-I-). RUDBAR (2)— Lat. 33° 23' N. Long. 49° E. Elev. 2,750'. A village of Luristan containing about 80 houses, on the right bank of the Karkheh river (here also called the Saimarreh or Ab-i-Shirvan, about | mile below the ford by which the Khurramabad-Deh Bala road crosses the river. Forage and fuel are abundant, some supplies are obtain able from the village, and ample camp room in the vicinity. Rawlinson 5 D 2764 RUD—RUD states that the name of Rudbar is also applied to the riverain district in this locality ; and indeed is very generally used for districts lying along the banks of rivers.— (Rawlinson — Burton, September 1897.) RtfDBAR (3)—(Valley)— A valley of the Saimarreh river which traverses it between the Saza-bln and Birinjan gorges. On the north-east and south-west run the Lura and Chamal-Gir mountains respectively. It is grassy and wooded throughout, the northern slopes of the mountains holding thick oak forest. On the right bank of the river are a number of Lur camps, and there is a considerable amount of cultivated and irrigated lands. The valley is traversed through out by the road from Deh Bala to Khurramabad, and from above the village of Rudbar, over the Chamal-Gir mountain, diverges the road to Badrai and the lower Saimarreh.— {Burton.) RGD HILLEH (District)— A small district of Ears subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports ; it is wedged in between the district of Haiat Baud on the north, the sea on the west and south, and the districts of Angali and Shabankareh on the east. Limits and physical characteristics. —The Rud Hilleh district comprises only the banks of the river of the same name for a distance of 15 miles inland, together with the uncultivated mud-flats which extend from the river to the north shore of the Bushire harbour : including the latter it measures about 15 miles in each direction. The coast of the district oppo site Bushire town is swampy, but at its extreme southern point, called Tehima, there is a rocky patch ; throughout its length the coast is only a few feet above high water level. The district is flat and its only impor tant feature is the Rud Hilleh stream. The winter is said to be colder than in Bushire, while in summer the day-breezes are less scorching than those of Angali and Shabankareh and the nights are fairly cool. Population .—The inhabitants of the district number somewhat over 4,000 souls. The majority are Arabs who speak both Persian and Arabic and are Sunnis by religion. Some of them claim to be the descendants of Ka’b immigrants from the Fallahieh district in Southern ’ Arabistan, and the remainder represent themselves as Bani Hajir and Bani Tamim from the mainland of Arabia; both classes say their ancestors came to the country two centuries ago and that they were refugees from Turkish oppression. The Bani Tamim claim to have been the earlier settlers. The villages consist of huts and are generally defended by small towers. Agriculture. —Wheat and barley are the ordinary staples ; musk and water-melons also grow and there are dates, but not many. There are some cattle and perhaps 1,000 sheep. Trade .—Trade is insignificant. Exports are a little wool and some wheat, barley and melons, which go to Bushire, Muhammareh, Kuwait, Bahrain and Lingeh. Imports are piece-goods, rice, tea, coffee and sugar from Bushire. The Persian Icrdn is the medium of exchange ; the local Hashim man is equal to 20 Tabriz mans of Bushire, and the local Gaz to 40£ inches.1^-1 RUD-RUD 765 * Communications and transport .—The Rtid Hilleh river is a considerable obstacle to movement, especially in summer. There is a ferry over it at Mahmadi, and a fort at ’Askau, where it is crossed by a land route from Bushire to Muhammareh. A ferry is also reported at Mahrizi. The district can produce about 250 horses, 1,300 donkeys, and, according to the statement of the Khan, 200 mules. The inhabitants own about 50 boats and maintain communication with Kuwait and even Basrah. Colonel Belly says :—“This district rears a good half-bred descrip tion of horse, half Persian, half Arab, they pass currently under the general name of the Arab Ka’b horse. The principal defects of this half-breed &amp;re found in a small arm and a falling-off in the hind quarter. They are better roadsters than the pure Arab, but they lack his quietness, intelli gence, and endurance. By re-crossing the Rud Hilleh Ka’b with a pure Arab, it is found that a good-looking, serviceable horse, of large bone and height, is obtained, but he is never as serviceable as the pure Arab.” Administration. district is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. About 60 years ago it came under the Khan of Angali, with whom it remained until its transfer, 6 years ago, to the Khan of Haiat Baud who manages'it through a brother of his own stationed at Mahmadi. Justice is dispensed as in the Khan’s own district of Haiat Baud {q.v.). The taxes are 60 krdns on every 6 Hashim mans of seed sown or area of 13 acres cultivated ; also £ of the produce of the date palms or, in a bad year, 2 or 3 krdns in cash on account of each tree. The district is at present farmed for an annual sum of 3,560 tumdns. The feud resulting from the transfer of this district from the Khan of Angali to the Khan of Haiat Baud is noticed in the article on Bushire, vide this Gazetteer. An official of the Persian Imperial Customs at Mahmadi is the only direct agent of the Per sian Government in the district. Armed forces .—Rud Hilleh can muster some 700 tufangchis. Topography .—The following is a list of the villages of the Rudhilleh district. They are each described separately in this Gazetteer. 1. ’Askari. 9. Khashm Haj Haji. 2. Cham Khalifeh. 10.

(Felly—Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905— Chick, 1909.) RUB HILLEH— A stream in Ears, also called Shatt Bani Lamini, which rises in the vicinity of Kaleh Safid, and traverses Shapur. In the plains it is fordable only at times near the village of Kaleh Sirhan. It is there a sluggish stream, 100 yards wide, 3' 6' deep, with a firm, sandy bottom, flowing between banks 12 feet high.— (Bell.)766 RUD—RUD R0DIIN or TANG-L-R0DIIN— Lat. 30° 2' N. Long. 52° 3' E. Elev. 5,400'. A village in Ears, some 45 miles north-north-west of Shiraz and 18 miles south of Bakum. It is a small village, and is situated in a narrow valley- carved out of the plateau by the Shish Pir of Fehlian river, about \ mile in width and overlooked by high hills. The village lies at the junction of the Shish Pir river with another considerable stream, both of which are un- fordable in many places. Near the town, Hopkins reported the river [ as running in a sandy bed with a width of 40 yards, a depth of 18 inches, and a swift current. He also says that it flows parallel to the Pul-i-Duzakh stream. There is a tufangchl tower situated above and on the eas$ of the village. It is built of masonry, and, before the days of long range fire arms, was a hard place to take. It is however looked into and command ed by hills on both sides. Rudian is a picturesque-looking and pleasant spot with a large number of fine walnut trees and grassy banks. The air is cool. Firewood here is plentiful and there is a small camping-ground. Near the village is cultivation, extending to some 10 or 12 square miles.— {Jones — Wells —Vaughan, 1891— McGowan, 1895— Hopkins, 1903.) RtJD-I-KHARA— A tributary of the H ilil Rud in Kirman, which is crossed by the road from Baft to Saidabad, 12 miles west of the former place.— {Sykes, 1900.)

RUD-I-MARUNl— A ndld in Kirman, up which the road from Saidabad to Baft runs for some distance, 29 miles from th3 former place.— {Sykes, 1900.) RUD-I-NAKSH-I-RUSTAM— A river on the borders of Fars and Laristan, flowing eastwards. It is cross ed on the road between Lar and Darab, at 14 miles south of Darab by an arch ed masonry causeway, and at 11 miles south of Darab by a ford, near the village of Bizdan. There is also an ill-constructed bridge of nine arches near this point. The ford, normally about a foot deep, is about 30 yards broad ; the stream being 15 feet wide. In flood time both the causeway and roadway of bridge are under water.— {Vaughan, 1890.) RtJD-I-SHUR (River)— A salt stream which rises in the coast range of Fars, where it is called Taiseh, to the north-east of Bandar Rig ; it passes a little to the east of the village of Char and to the west of that of Anjireh, and either falls into the Rud Hilleh stream near Makabari or else, turning eastwards at Puzagh, which is on its right bank, throws itself into the head of the Rig inlet. DeBode and Wells both state that the river discharges into the Gulf of Bandar Rig, but, as their account of the upper part of the river is inac. curate, too much reliance cannot be placed on the statement. Throughoutthe greater part its length this water-course forms the boundary between the Gulf Ports district of Haiat Daud and the Ears district of Shabankareh. Its bed, where it is crossed by the route between Deh Kuhneh and Chah- ruschi, is about 150 yards wide, and in May is almost dry.— (DeBode —• Wells—Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) RUD-I-ZARD (1)— A river in Khuzistan ; it waters that part of the town of Ramuz adjacent to the mountains lying to its south-east by irrigation canals. Two miles south of Ramuz, as the Mahur road leaves Kuhneh, the plain becomes more open and grassy, and covered with flocks and herds and Arab and Lur camps. Here the Rud-i-Zard, a rapid stream, flows over the plain in several branches, and 12 miles south of Ramuz effects a junction with the Jarrahi river which then, skirting through tangled ravines, the western spurs of a rocky range of hills, emerges some 20 miles south of Ramuz into the alluvial plains which stretch to the Karun and the sea. The watershed of a stony slope, running west from these hills on the right bank of the river, forms at this point, 12 miles south-south-west of Ram Hormuz, the boundary between the Bakhtiaris and the territory of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. It is also 1 called the Alai. It is crossed three times on the road from Kaleh-i-Tul to Sar Asiab.— {Baring — Burton.) RtJD-I-ZARD (2)—Lat. Long. Elev. A hamlet of 10 huts on the right bank of the Ab-i-Zard and is 1 mile to south of and 3 miles to west of the point where the ’Arabistan-Isfahan road touches that river ; it stands on the edge of a stony plateau of small extent, adjacent on a few patches of wheat.

It lies on the 3rd stage from Isfahan (43 miles) on the Bakhtiari caravan road. The pass consists of dip in a lower ridge which is in prolongation of a higher and rocky mountain to the south-east, and in this direction it cannot be turned nearer than the Anjireh pass, 9 miles distant. The ridge to the north west is accessible for mules. The ascent from the north is tedious and continuous for 2 miles, followed by a steep ziz-zag climb for 1 mile. This with a little improvement would be quite passable by guns. At present, artillery could be driven double-harnessed to a point a mile below the pass. The descent to the south-west is easy. Guns coming from the direction of Qehfarukh could be driven to within f a mile o? the top. The village of Qehfarukh is reached 10 miles from the summit. A track also branches at 1 mile from the summit on the north side of the pass due west to Deh Kurd (13 miles). On the summit is a stone hut occupied by 3 Bakhtiari, who act as guards and supervisors of the road. There is no fuel in the vicinity.

SA’ATABAD— See SA’ADATABAD. SAB’EH— vide KARUN. SABI—imfe SASIANS. SABIANS or SUBBA or SABI— A remarkable people dispersed in small communities over parts of Turkish Arabia and Persian ’Arabistan, but united everywhere by the possession of a common religion. In dress and appearance they are indistinguishable from their Arab neighbours, with whom they possibly share a common des cent, though their speech is different and their Arabic broken. Their present 6 E 2773 SAB-SAB head-quarters (1905) are at Suq-ush-Shuiukli on the Euphrates where they number 700 souls : they are also found at ’Amarab (1,000 souls), Nasiriyeh (300), Kaleh Salih and Shatrat-ul-Muntafik in Turkish Arabia. In’Arabis- tan they are found at Muhammareh (40 families); at Hawizeh, which 60 years ago was one of their important places, and at Aminieh on the Karun river (10 or 12 families). There are none now at Ahwaz, Dizful or Shushtar. Their religious head, known as the Qari, resides at Suq-ush-Shuiukh. The Sabians display a special aptitude for working in gold and silver, and this probably is the trade followed by the majority ; in Turkish Arabia, how ever, many of them are canoe builders and carpenters : few or none are agriculturists. The numbers of the Sabians have greatly declined in recent years, and are still dwindling. The exact nature of their religion and its affinities with Star-worship, Judaism, Christianity, and Muhammadanism have not been ascertained accurately. The use also of the term ^ Sabian ” by different authorities at various times has not been consistent, and it is doubtful wheather the modern Subba are identical with the Sabiyana of the Quran. The modern Sabians possess scriptures of their own and a book of ritual ; baptism is one of their principal rites, and water enters into all their impor tant ceremonies ; they respect Yahia, or John the Baptist, as a prophet, regarding him as a re-incarnation of Seth, but they consider both Moses and Christ to have been false teachers ; their paradise is located in the North Star. They are an uncircumcised race and not monogamous. In ’Arabistan they claim a Syrian origin, and say that their ancestors once owned most of Shushtar.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

It is separated from the mainland by a channel, through which even small vessels cannot pass except at high water. It has a length of 5 miles and its greatest breadth is 2| miles : its upper end being about 4 miles below the junction of the Karun with the Shatt- al-’Arab. The island is very fertile and the whole is being gradually brought under cultivation : on the southern side, called Bahrieh, there are several small villages. The ground appears to be rising, and already there are date plantations and wheat-fields on the higher grounds, while rice is still grown on the lower. In 1836 the main channel of the Shatt-al-’Arab ran between Haji Salbuq and ’Abbadan island ; what now remains of it is a boat passage, nearly closed at its upper end by a shoal, but having a width elsewhere of 400 to 700 yards and a depth in the fair way of 9 to 16 feet .—[Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908).

SARAB-I-SIAH (1) River—Lat. Long. Elev. A sluggish, muddy river draining the eastern arm of the Chal-i-Mureh plain in the Shulistan district of Ears. It falls into the main stream (probably the Zuhreh), 2 miles from the Ganjagan ridge. The water is good. On its banks is the Tul-i-Surneh (q.v.) near to which the river is forded, apparently with a certain amount of difficulty at all times. It flows in a stream 20 yards broad and 4 feet deep in a wide bed, the banks of which are covered 'with thick jungle. In winter it must be quite impassable. The river was evi dently formerly led round the east side of the Tul-i-Surnehmotffid as well as on the west side, thus securing for the mound a wet ditch. Now, however, there is water on the west side only.— (Wells — McGowan, 1895—Hopkins, 1803.) SARAB-I-SIAH (2) Valley — Lat. Long. Elev. A valley of Ears, entered on the road from F. hlian to Basht north-west of Shiraz. It lies between two parallel chains of hills. At first it is well- cultivated, but farther on is covered with high grass, and becomes a mere swamp abounding with game. Many springs have burst forth from the ground and the rocks. There are roads on either side of the valley along the base of the hills. The Shish Pir waters are said to flow to the Sarab-i-Shh of Shulistan through Rudbal, so that the stream flowing through the valley is also known as the Sarab- i-Siah. Baring speaks of a spring called the Sarab-i-Si ,h, from which a stream flows met with after crossing the Chal-i-Mur h. The Sarab-i-Siah ford is easy, just above where a remarkable mound, evidently artificial, is now crowned by a ruined mosque. The mound is circular in shape, has 40 feet of steep scarp, and 70 feet diameter. The Sarab-i-Siah evidently was formerly led round the east side of the mound, as well as the west, and a wet ditch was thus secured, but now there is only water on the west. The river is said to rise at one burst from a huge spring half-way up the valley, which has been likened to an arm of the sea.—(DeBode—Durand—Baring- Wells — Jones.) SARAB NAUKASH— Lat. Long.

The district contains the following villages in addition to Gulkhungan : — Borazjun Hasanabad. Bid-i-Nau. Hafr (same as Gulkhungan). Bibulan. Khvansar. One of the sources of the Karlin river, in the Bakhtiari mountains. It is a magnificent spring welling out of the foot of the Zardeh Kuh, yet bearing the name of the rival range.

SHABANKAREH (District)— An inland district of the Ears Province, separated from the sea by the Gulf Ports District of Haiat Daud, and meeting on the south the Gulf Ports districts of Dashtistan, Angall and Rud HiHeh Limits. —Shabankareh is bounded on the west by the Rild Shflr, which divides it from Haiat Daud; on the north and east by the outer range of798 8HA—8HA the Persian hills, in this neighbourhood called Taviseh ; and on the south by the Rud Hilleh river. Its length from north-west to south-east is thus about 20 miles and its breadth 12 miles. Physical characteristics .—Except for the seaward slopes of the Taviseh hills, which are included in the district, Shabankareh appears to consist entirely of flat, open country. It is crossed by various water-courses from the hills, but there are none of importance between the Rud Shur on the east, and the Rud Shur or Rudkhaneh-i-Shur on the west. Water is generally obtained from wells, but the villages on the Rud Hilleh river procure their supply from that stream. In summer, hot winds blow for three months from June to August, but the temperature falls considerably at night. Inhabitants. —Thel inhabitants mostly belong to Persian-speaking tribes who have been settled here from time immemorialbut there are a few villages of immigrants from neighbouring Persian districts, and of Arab settlers. Most of the people belong to small or obscure tribes ; the inhabitants of Deh Kuhneh, the principal village of the district, are described as Haijab and Khajahvan. With few exceptions the people profess the faith of the Shi’ahsect of the Muhammadan religion. They are neither fanatical nor turbulent, but they are well-armed, and Martini rifles are said to be as numerous as' households. The dwellings in most places are huts, but about £ are houses of sun-dried brick. A list of the principal villages is given below under the head of topography ; a description of each is given separately in this Gazetteer. Most of the villages of the district have one or two small towers for purposes of defence. The total population of the district amounts to about 10,000 souls. Agriculture. —Wheat and barley are the staples of cultivation, but there are date-plantations in some of the villages, and in particular places tobacco and water-melons are grown. Cotton has recently been intro duced on a small scale. Livestock includes a fair number of cattle and several thousands of sheep and goats. Trade. —There is a small export of wheat, barley, tobacco, straw and wool, and a corresponding importation of piece-goods, rice, tea, coffee, sugar and spices. Business is chiefly with Bushire, the more northern villages dealing with that place through the port of Bandar Rig, and the more southern through Shif. The standard of length is a gaz, about 2 inches longer than the English yard, and of weight a Hashim man, which varies from 18 to 24 Tabriz mans of Bushire. Persian krdns make up the bulk of the currency. Communications and transport. —Deh Kuhneh, the principal place in Shabankareh lies upon the route from Borazjun to Bandar Dilam or Zaidan, and from Deh Kuhneh there is a track to the sea at Bandar Rig. Shif, on the coast opposite Bushire town, is easily accessible across country from the southern villages of Shabankareh, the distance being about 15 miles The transport resources are roughly estimated at 200 horses, 100 mules and 3,000 donkeys. In most villages where there are horses, mules also are found to about ^ the number of horses. There are some camels. Administration. Shabankareh is ruled by a hereditary Khan who is sub ject to the Governor of Ears ; the present incumbent is Isma’il Khan, son of Sahrab Khan, son of Rustam Khan, son of Muhammad Amir Khan : the family are said to have come from Fasa near Shiraz in the Firuzabad districtSHA—SHA 799 and to have been first placed in charge of Shabankareh in the reign of Karim Khan Zand. Isina il Khan is about 55 years of age ; his nearest heirs are two sons Muhammad AH Khan and Lutf ’AH Khan, besides whom he has two brothers, Rustam Khan and Ahmad Khan. The Khan at present pays 5,500 tumdns a year for the farm of the district; he manages it through the Kad- khudas or headmen of the villages. There are no arrangements for the administration of justice, and private retaliation of injuries is the rule,though to a certain extent disputes are adjusted by the Khan, by village-headmen and local Kazis and Mullas. Land-revenue is collected at the rate of 60 krdns per 6 Hashim man of seed sown ; this works out at about 5 Jcrans per acre. There is also a cash tax on dates, equal to J of the value of the pro duce, and an annual poll-tax of one Jcrdn per man is collected in addition. There is no official directly representing the Persian Government in the district. Supplementary information regarding the method of Government and local factions is given in the article on Bushire, vide this Gazetteer.

There is an imdmzddeh with a few kiindr trees. Near here are traces of ancient habitations, supposed to mark the site of the Sassanian university town of Jund-i-Shapur. Schindler, however, argues that the latter place must have been some what south-west of Shahabad on account of the scanty water-supply, and Jund-i-Shapur must have had water for its extensive date gardens. There are no date gardens at Shahabad. The ruins near Shahabad have, however, been identified with Shahr-i-Diagonus.—Decode— Schindler— Baring—Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.)

High tides still reach the village on its western side, and it has a small coasting trade. The inhabi tants are often at feud with the people of Bandar Dilam. There is a white-domed tomb which gives its name to the place.

SILllIPUR (river) better SHAPIJR. 1 A river in Ears which rises to the north-west of Shiraz, and flows in a direc tion rather west of south past Shahpur. Here the river, says Vaughan, ia fordable, in the month of June, in many places. The current is swift and the water fresh and clear. The number of fish lying in the water is astonishing, the river being packed with them. The people have no nets and no lines or hooks, and can only take them by shooting them. It is cool in the vicinity of the river, but mosquitoes are troublesome at night. Another parent branch leaves the Daria-i-Parishan in a north-westerly direction, being crossed near the lake by the Pul-i-Abglneh. It flows round the north of Shahpur and joins the other stream west of that place. Near Shahpur the river rushes through a gorge called the Tang-i- Chakan, which is cut right through the cliff and is only slightly over a hundred yards in width. As the river approaches Kunar Takhteh it turns to the west, and, finding its way through the hills near Buraki, turns again south-south-east until joined by the DalakI river in the Dash- tistan. Thence the course of the united river, now generally known as the Rud Hilleh or Rud-i-Shahpur, is south-east until it falls into the sea north of Bushire. The place of the same name consists of numerous camps of Lurs, who live in booths formed of pieces of wood and bushes. There are about 100 families in the place.

It contains 200 houses and a large fort-like enclosure with corner towers. The population is said to number about 500. A small stream known as the Ab-i-Shalamzar, flows westwards past the southern end of the village joining the Ab-i-Jehan-bin some 8 miles lower down. The bridge at Shalamzar was said in 1906 to have a very bad surface of boulders, but in October of that year the stream was only 18' deep; it has a sand bottom and level banks. The valley and mountain around are bare of trees. Wheat and barley are grown in considerable quantities in the valley and the adjacent slopes, and arc exported to Isfahan for sale.

The caravanserai stands 400 feet above the Ab-i-Bazuft. It is built of rubble masonry and there are about 40 square yards of rooms, walls and stables, 15 feet high, roofed with heavy chindr beams. On the hillsides are limestone rocks which are burnt for lime at the caravan- serai. The accommodation in the serai is very restricted, but there are seve ral good camping-grounds between it and the bridge at Pul-i-’Amarat, the ■ nearest being a narrow strip on the left bank of the stream from the serai to 400 yards and upwards. There is no source of supplies immediately at hand, the result being that this caravanserai is usually very badly pro- 1 vided. Supplies come from the Bazuft valley. The retail selling price per Shahl man of 13 lbs. in October and November, 1906, was—for barley P50 krdns—bhusd 50 krdns —rnd bread 2-50 krdns.

SHALlL, AB-I— A small stream in the Bakhtiari country, rising from the southern spurs of the Garreh mountain. In a course of some 10 miles at most, it first flow’s in a southerly direction, but makes a sharp bend almost due west at a point about 2 miles before it reaches the caravanserai, to which it has given its name, and about 4 miles before it is lost in the waters of the Ab- -Bazuft, at the Pul-i-’Amarat. There is a small village of the same name near its source and a few habitations at its bend to the west.— (Arbuthnot, 1905).SHALLlR-I-AB or AB-I-SHIMBAR— A considerable stream rising in tbe mountains of Luristan to the north west of the Kuh-i-Safid. It flows through the valley of the same name into the Karun river about its 265th mile, and at the apex of the great stretch to the north-west made by that river after passing the Pul-i-Shalu or Gudar-i-Balutak. The Shallar, when in flood, brings down a considerable . f volume of water, being about 80 feet wide and 10 feet deep at its junction with the Karun river.— (Sawyer—Arbuthnot, 1905.) SHALU or GUDAR-I-BALUTAK, PUL-I- Lat. SUlT'-N. Long. 50° 12' E. Elev. 2,750k A bridge over the Karun river, at about the 215th mile of its course, in the Bakhtiari country. The caravanserai, which overlooks it on the right bank of the river, is the 10th stage on the Bakhtiari caravan road from Isfahan (167 miles.) The specifications of the bridge, which was one of two laid on this route by Messrs. Lynch Brothers in 1898-1900 for the Bakhtiari Khans, is as follows:—Wire rope suspension, with piers of solid masonry and a lattice girder. Steel roadway and concrete flooring; length 120 feet. Clear width of roadway, 10 feet. Adapted to bear an ordinary working load of 2| cwt. per square foot, or a live load uniformly distributed of 80 tons. It is laid about 80 reet above the level of the river at a point where its banks rise as perpendicular cliffs on both sides to that height. Before the bridge was built the ford here was known at the Gudar-i-Balutak ( ‘ ‘ the ford where the oak-trees abound ”). The river running between these high cliffs has a current sometimes in the early spring of 13 feet a second, and is liable to sudden rises of many feet with in a few^hours. The caravanserai was built at the same time as the bridge and has a fair amount of accommodation, but is kept in the most unsanitary and filthy condition. There is no village or other buildings in the neighbour hood. A few hundred yards to the east an elevated plateau, about ten acres in extent, is suitable for a camping-ground, when not under cultivation- otherwise the best ground is to be found 1| miles to the east of the bridge on the river-bank. Supplies sufficient for 50 men and 200 animals for one day in usual circumstances. Water in abundance can be obtained from the river.

The ruins of an ancient city situated at the north-western extremity of the plain of Kazarun, from which it is distant 15 miles, one-third of this distance lying along the caravan road to the south, which can accordingly be rejoined after a deviation to Shapur to view the ruins and inscriptions of the ancient capital of King Shahpur. The halting-place consists of several camps of Lurs, situated at the point where the Shapur river issues from the hills on to the plain of Kazarun. The habitations consist of pieces of wood and bushes, and there are about 100 families in the place, belonging to the Taiteh Diishman Ziari of the Mammasanis. Firewood is very plentiful here. On a low hill commanding the entrance to the Tang-i-Chakan, through which the river flows, stand the ruins of an old fort. In coming from the south, Kamarij is the best place from which to make the excursion. To see the ruins of Shapur. Following the telegraph poles along the Kamarij road for a little over 5 miles, and then striking across the plain in the direction of the north-westerly cliff wall, the track becomes involved in a wilderness of tumuli, consisting of loose stones and broken down struc tures, filling a circuit of several miles, at the base of the mountains. These mounds rise to a height of 50 to GO feet above the surrounding plain. These are the ruins of the city of Shapur. Through the northern cliff cuts the gorge of the Shahpur river, known as the Tang-i-Chakan, its sides being a sheer rock face, in many parts of several hundred feet high. In the wilderness of ruins that marks the site of the ancient city, few remains are now capable of identification. The only ruin of any moment is that of a building 50 feet square, one wall of which is still standing, though half buried in the soil. In the very jaws of the gorge, on a spur of the south east cliff, are the remains of an old castle. There is no doubt that this, which is called the Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, is the remains of the ancient citadel.SHA-SHA . 815 id to wit, hits, ttm, W. fthe ance ined oient ^ imps hills wood othe here, :ough make g the iinin edin strac- These These festhe being a the s are ;ofa half ruth- this, adeh In the gorge on both sides are cut bas-reliefs in the rock, two on the left, and four on the right bank of the river.

SHARlFAT (Tribe)— An Arab tribe, represented in Southern ’Arabistan in the Jarrahi district by two sections, theRajaibat and the Bani Rashid, who inhabit the left bank of the Jarrahi near Khalafabad. In former days the tribe was very power ful, and, according to Felly and Layard, inhabited the vicinity of the Hindian river, and the Zadan hills, and had Deh Mulla and Hindian as their prin cipal towns. The tribe, says Layard, used to consider itself more under the protection of the Ka’b Shaikh than under his absolute authority. It numbered a fighting strength of about 2,000 foot and 700 horsemen, and frequently opposed the Ka’b Shaikh, sometimes siding with the Persian against him. Felly called them a section of the Ka’b tribe and gave the number of their adult males as 10,000. Ross gives them as a principal Ka’b tribe numbering about 900 males, living in huts near Hawlzeh and tributary to FallaMeh. Whatever amount of accuracy there may be in these varying accounts, the fact remains that the tribe has diminished greatly both in power and numbers in ’Arabistan, and, as regards that pro vince, is now only found near Khalafabad as stated above. The Rajaibat section has 20 fighting-men and 30 horses, while the Bani Rashid number 30 fighting-men, and possess 35 horses. Each section possesses also about 100 camels, besides some donkeys, cattle and sheep. The Sharifat are also found on the Turkish side of the Shatt-al-’Arab in the neighbourhood of Abul-Khasib.— {Layard — Petty — Ross—Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) SHARUKHlYEH— A canal in the Fallahieh district of Southern ’Arabistan, on the left bank of the river Jarrahi, with which it is connected. It is also called Qahan and Shakhat-us-Saiyid Fakhar.

SHASHI— A hamlet in the Bastak district of Laristan, about 36 miles from Bandar Abbas, and 5 miles south of the road from that town to Lar.

Elev. ; A village on the west shore of ’Abbadan island about 3 miles below Bawair- deh. It consists of 30 mud huts of Mutur (Muhaisin).—(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) JSHATAIT (AB-I-)— The right branch of the Karun river after its bifurcation above Shushtar, and until it reunites at Band-i-Qir with that portion of its waters which runs through the alternative channel of the Gargar. The course of the Shatait is much more crooked than that of the Gargar and the stream is much wider, attaining a maximum breadth of 250 yards at a point about 16 miles above Band-i-Qir, where a rocky spur comes down to the stream on its left side. The steep banks are covered wiih scrub. At its junction with the Gargar and Diz the Shatait is 150 yards wide. Its colour when in flood is a greyish-green, and it is slower to show discolouration than either the Gargar or Diz. It carries less silt than the Gargar, the Diz, or the Lower Karun. When steam navigation was introduced on the Karun, the Shushan, still in use, a stern-wheeler 100 feet long with a beam of 23 and an ordinary draft of 3 feet, ran for more than a year upon the Shatait, instead of upon the Gargar as at present, it being at that time believed that in the low season the channel of the Gargar might become impassable. It was found that the river could not be navigated with safety by a vessel of the Shushan , s dimensions above Chehar Dingeh, a point 10 miles distant by land from Shushtar town, on account of the intricacy and number of the channels ar d of the shingly nature of the bed, which prevented the use of anchors from get ting off when aground. Below Chehar Dingeh, which from the end of 1890 to the beginning of 1892 was the Shushan's regular terminus, the only serious obstacle was a double reef of rocks with a narrow channel through which the water raced violently : the difficulty of the reef was at times increased by the formation of sandbanks below it. It was found that, owing to want of water, the passage of the reef was uncertain in August and September, dangerous in October, and impossible in November ; but the level of the river did not vary regularly with the season. Once the Shushan crossed the reef wdien there was only 2| feet of water on it : in this case she was slacked over with lines, sheering about very much in the strong water, and took the ground twice in the operation. Native craft prefer the Gargar to the Shatait. At Shushtar town a canal called the Minau, described in the article on Shushtar town, has its head. About 50.0 yards below the Icaleh the Shatait is crossed by a gigantic dam, supporting a bridge which is known as the Pul-i-Shahi or Dizful. The bridge “winds 'rregularly, and when complete had 41 arches and was 570 yards long, with a cobble-paved road-way, 21 feet wide. At the present time (1905) 28 arches are still standing on the left bank and 8 upon the right, but these are divided by a breach about 170 feet long through which the main stream of the river passes, the weir at this point having given way as well as the bridge. The materials and construction of the weir are superior to those of the bridge. The stream in the spring floods has a current running up to 6 feet a second, and is dangerous to animals which have to cross it by swimming. The Shatait is not applied to irrigation except on a petty scale near villages. The principal tribe in the neighbourhood of the Shatait are the ’Anafijeh who live upon its lower reaches. 112 I.

SHAUR (River),— vide SHAVUR (River). SHAVER (or SHAUR) (River), originally SHAPER (River)— A river of ’Arabistan, which rises from springs in the plain between the rivers Karkheh and Diz at Aivan-i-Kasra or Asiran-i-Karkheh. He Morgan is of opinion that it was originally a canal, and that its waters are now derived from the Karkheh river by a subterranean channel, his opinion being fortified by the fact of the river passing through a range, or ridge, of low hills by a manifestly artificial cutting on its course to the river Diz. Some 12 miles below its source, flowing nearly south and parallel to the river Karkheh, from which it is never many miles distant, it washes the western foot of the ruins of Shush or Susa. At this point it is 1|- mile east of the river Karkheh and 6| miles west of the Ab-i-Diz. Continuin 3 5L2gSHA-SHA 820 southward Kut-ul-Mihdi is passed , on the left bank at 20 miles. Here the Shavur bends south-south-east towards the Diz river, passing Khair- abad at 55 miles and Deh-i-Saiyid Musa at 60 miles, both on the right bank. Thenceforward the river curves more and more to the east towards the river Diz, and begins to leave the river Karkheh which soon afterwards bends south-west towards Hawizeh. Passing within 2_ miles of Deh-i-Pir Muhammad on the right bank at about 64 miles, the Shavur joins the river Diz by two branches above Band-i-Qir after a course of about 75 miles by water, or of 60 miles neglecting bends. These two branches separate at Plawizch and enter the larger river 38 and 26 miles respectively by water above Band-i-Qir. The former of these branches is named the Snarish and the latter the Kharur ; both contain water at all seasons of the year, but the Kharur is the more important. Originally the Shavur flowed into the river Karun from the north-west a little below Wais_and,-at a later period, near Ahwaz. After deserting this bed it adopted a more southerly channel, joining the main river near Ahwaz. Later again it struck northwards, and at the time of Bayard’s and Selby’s explorations in 1842 was found entering the Ab-i-Diz at a point 12 miles above Band-i-Qir. This channel appears to have been more or less maintained until the present day (1905). The history of this river, whose various channels can be distinctly traced, is typical of all the rivers of this district, including the Karun itself. The Shavur is of canal-like appearance, its course is winding, and its width of 25 to 30 yards is fairly uniformly maintained. At least in some of the upper reaches, the banks are high (6 to J 2 feet above the water) and the river in some places is unfordable ; but taking it throughout its length, the stream is sluggish, its banks and bed soft and of alluvial soil, and it can be forded at frequent intervals, the fords being generally girth- deep. The banks are lined almost throughout with low tamarisk jungle and, in its higher reaches, with thorn trees, and abound with wild boar, hysenas and small game. The lands upon the Shavur, especially those of the ’Ajairib tract, are fertile, and the banks are clothed in spring with luxuriant herbage. Throughout its course a number of canals diverge from the river, some of ancient and some of modern construction, and the river is largely drawn on for irrigation, at the low season its waters being practically exhausted for this purpose. The principal canals which leave the Shavur on its left bank are, in descending order, the following.—the Khairabad, the Taraifi, the Qumat. the Ishareh (near Jajls on the Diz) and the Hawasiyeh ; of these the Taraifi and Hawasiyeh benefit the ’Anafijeh tribe, and the remainder water the lands of the Bait Sa’ad. In some places it forms marshes, which are tenanted by pastoral Arabs and cultivated with rice. There are several Arab settlements upon it, of which the most important appear to be Qumat and Khairabad, both now in the possession of Shaikh Haidar of the A1 Kathir tribe. Qumat was called after one Saiyid Qumat, who is now re presented by his grandson, Saiyid Taghir Qumati, but the name of the settlement, which consists of four camps, is said to have been changed, and Qumat is probably the present Kut-ul-Mahdi. The ’ Anafijeh for merly occupied both banks of the Shavur, as the Bait Sa’ad and A1 Kathir still do, and until 1905 the Bani Lam extended up to its right bank below Khairabad. In Bayard’s day the Shavur at Qumat divided in winter intoSHA-SHI 821 two branches, of which'the northern retained the name of Shavur, the other being called the Kharur.— (Layard—Curzon, 1889 — Burton, 1897— Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) shawardIeh— A section of the Ka’b tribe {q.v.).

(DeBode.) SHIBKCH DISTRICT— A peculiar and important section of the Persian coast, extending from the boundary of the Dashti district on the north to that of Lingeh on the south : its direction is approximately from west-north-west by north to east-south east by south. The north-westernmost of the Shibkuh Ports is Banak, 3 miles north west of Kangan, and the south-westernmost is Limits. Mughu; the distance between is 180 miles. Along its south-western side the tract connected with the ports is bordered by the Persian Gulf; the inland boundary is the crest of the main maritime range, which at Kangan is about 6 miles from the sea and at Mughu slightly over 20, the difference being due, not to any change in the direction of the range, which is nearly straight, but to a gradual though irregular trend of the coast line away from the hills. The name “ Shibkuh ” means “ below the hills.” The islands of Shaikh Shu’aib, Hindarabi, Qais and Farur are attached for administrative purposes to the Shibkuh district. The disposition of the ranges composing this hilly, littoral tract has been made clear by recent surveys ; previously it was Physical geograp y. not we p understood. The dominant feature of the whole district is the great maritime range of Southern Persia, which, forming a tangent to the sea near Kangan runs thence south-south- eastwards without interruption and almost without change of direction, until it falls into the sea on the coast between Lingeh and Khamir at a point im mediately north of Basidu: the distance from Kangan to this place is about 210 miles. The range throughout is composed of masses of limestones which have a quaquaversal dip, and rise in places to as much as 5,000 teet above sea level. The principal summits are Kuh Marakishti (in the Admi ralty chart called Jabal Slrl, ’Ayanat or Barn Hill) 4 miles inland from Mian- lu, height 4,660 feet; Sir-i-Yafal (in the Admiralty chart called Siri Yafal or ’Asalu Notch) 6 miles inland from Nakhl Taqi and 4,870 feet high ; and Jabal Taranjeh 20 miles inland from Gurzeh, elevation 5,150 feet. We may here notice that a great trough, co-extensive with the portion of the mari time range just described, adjoins the range on its inland side, and is divided into two parts by a watershed which is behind Tahiri on the coast. Portions of this great valley are still unsurveyed, but the part of it to the north-west of the watershed seems to drain to the upper course of the Mund river, while the major or south-western part apparently runs straight in the opposite direction to Clarence Strait, the channel between Qishm island and the main. The valley contains 3 places of some importance, whose trade with the outer world is conducted through Shibkuh Ports ; they are Gallehdar, 8 miles from the sea at a point rather nearer to ’Asalu than to Tahiri ;Tarakameh, 20 miles inland from Shiyu; and Ishkani, 22 miles from the coast at Maqam. It remains to describe the sub-features of the Shlbkuh tract between the main range and the Persian Gulf. From Kangan as far as ’Asalu, a little over 40 miles, the main range immediately adjoins the coast and presents to it a face apparently precipitous, on which, however, the fires of charcoal burners are seen to twinkle at night. Immediately below ’Asalu is Naband bay, and from there to another but less pronounced bay at Maqam—a distance of about 60 miles—the coast lies parallel to the foot of the main range at about 20 miles from it, the intervening space being occu pied by the Gabandi valley which rises immediately inland of Shiyu, and, skirting the foot of the main range, reaches the sea at the foot of Naband bay. The Gabandi valley is separated from the coast by a sandstone rido-e, called Shahin Kuh, which is nowhere more than a mile or two from the shore, and in the neighbourhood of Shiyu attains its maximum height of 1,100 feet. This ridge continues along the coast till Maqam, when, the littoral making a fresh echelon seawards, it is left at some distance inland, and almost immediately terminates about 16 miles due east of Maqam. Between Shiyu and Maqam, rather nearer to the latter, is a gap in the sand stone ridge through which a small valley called Darveh Asuh comes down to the sea in a direction perpendicular to the coast : this valley has two branches in the interior which unite at about 10 miles from the sea, one of them coming from the west from a point near the head of the Gabandi valley and the other from the east, from the watershed on the other side of which a valley called Hamiru has its origin. The Hamlru valley from its source at first runs eastwards, then bends southwards round the end of the sandstone ridge to the east of Maqam and finally goes westwards reaching the sea at Maqam in an opening between two parallel ranges similar to that of the Gabandi valley at Naband. The southern range inthiscaseis another ridge of sandstone which extends from Ras Na band for 50 miles to Chatak, where it ends, closely adjoining the shore throughout its length ; between Chliu and Charak it has an elevation of 2,000°to 3,000 feet. The greater part of the interval to the north of this ridge between it and the great maritime range is occupied by the turn of the Hamlru valley already described, and by a tributary which it receives from the east, but the remainder consists of the basin of the Gulshan valley, which has its mouth on the coast less than a mile to the east of Charak. Beyond Charak a gap about 5 miles in width occurs in the coast ridge, and a plain extends from the edge of the sea to the main range, here 15 miles inland, broken only by some dark-coloured, detached hills between 1,000 and 2,000 feet high. Between the gap and Mughu, the last of the Shlbkuh ports in this direction, the detached hill Kuh NamakI (in the Admiralty chart called Jabal Yarld) rises close to the sea to an elevation of 1,200 feet. The strata of the sandstone ridges which skirt the sea below Ras Naband dip toward the coast, and it appears not improbable that the ridges them selves have been formed by the gradual elevation of the greater inner lime stone range through a bed of superincumbent, light-coloured sandstone.824 SHI—SHI It ia worthy of remark that, while the limestone range gives birth to many fresh springs and streams and is clad, though sparsely, with almond, dwarf- oak, hawthorn, rose and terebinth, the sandstone ridges produce hardly a shrub or a grass, and the streams that spring from them are generally brackish. The actual coast of the Shibkuh ports district possesses no remarkable feature, unless we reckon the islands of Shaikh Shu’aib, Hindarabi, Qais, Farur and Nabiu Farur. Dangers of navigation, apart from these con spicuous islands, are few ; and north of Shiyu the tide-stream is either faint or imperceptible. The number of houses in the Shibkuh district—the valleys of Gabandi, Darveh Asuh and Gulshan in the interior being excluded—appears to be about 3,500; but at the present time (1905), in consequence of recent emigrations, there is at most places a considerable proportion of unoccupied houses and the actual total population cannot be estimated at more than 13,000 souls; Persians of unmixed descent are few in the district, and such as are found are mostly settlers from Lar and other Persian districts ; the bulk of the people are of mingled Persian and Arab blood, and the tribes to which they belong are of no consequence. The following Arab tribes are, however, deserving of notice :— Name. Estimated num’ er of souls in the Shib kuh District. Where found. Remarks. ’All (Al) ..

A route presenting no special difficulties follows the sea-coast from Kangan to Naband bay, from the foot of which it runs up the Gabandi valley, traverses the upper basins of the Asuh and Gulshan valleys, and passes across the swampy plain of the Lingeh district to Lingeh town* ; there is a land route along the coast from Charak via Mughu to Lingeh town ; one from Charak inland to Bastak and so to Lar, and a third, crossing the last, from Mughu to Lar.f The coast route is fit for all arms.

In 1906, the local authority was changed, and the groups transfer red from the ju risdiction of Pars to that of the Gulf Ports, The vil lages formerly under the Nasirj Shaikh are not even now assessed to revenue.828 SHI—SHI Groups of vil lages and total annual revenue.

From this table it will be apparent that the Shibkuh district is for the most part subject to the Governor-Gen- Admimstiation. era j ^ pars. The third of ’Aselu and Naband group villages constitutes a curious exception, and its transference to the jurisdiction of the Gulf ports, represented locally by the Tamlmi Shaikh Saghar bin Mubarak, is not yet an accomplished fact, though it has been ordered by the Persian Government; the hereditary Harami Shaikh of ’Asalu is still resolutely resisting the change. The prime movers in the innovation were the Customs Department, who have more influence with the Governor of the Gulf ports than with the Governor-General of Pars, and are consequently desirous that the principal Shibkuh ports should be brought under the authority of the former. The two groups of villages to the north of ’Asalu are, it will be seen, managed by the Khan of Dashti whose here ditary dominions they adjoin. The remainder of the coast with its islands is parcelled out among various Arab Shaikhs, namely the Nasuri Shaikh of Gabandl, the Hamadi Shaikh nf Maqam, the ’Ubaidli Shaikh of Chiru, the AT Ali Shaikh of Charak, and the Marzuqi Shaikh of Mughu. Hither to the Persian Government have exercised little authority over the semi independent chiefs, but, should their experiment at ’Asalu prove successful, it is not improbable that, impelled by the Customs Depart ment, they may proceed to destroy the power of the remaining hereditary Shaikhs in the southern part of the district. Up to the present time the local influence of the Shaikhs has generally been sufficient to deter out siders from attempting to farm the revenues of their villages, which the Persian Government would otherwise have no hesitation in handing over to the highest bidders. The Shaikhs exercise considerable powers in their own districts, they settle all civil matters except such as are of a semi-religious character (e.g., matrimonial cases) according to their own ideas of what is right and proper; they dispose of all criminal cases, inflicting at their discretion imprisonment and the bastinado, but not the penalty of death ; and without their per mission no stranger dare engage in pearl-fishing in their territorial waters. The executive and administrative powers of a revenue farmer, as forSHI—8HI 829 instance of tlie Khan of Dashtl in this district, are similar to those of the local hereditary authorities, and would clash with the latter if introduced into the same pla^e. At present the southern Shlbkuh Shaikhs are the revenue farmers of their own districts.

A low rocky point on the coast of the Angali district of Fars, 5 miles north east ^ of Bushire town. There are no inhabitants, but the point forms the landing-place on the mainland at the north-east end of Bushire harbour for all goods and travellers going up country. Goods landed from boats are either dropped by mules at Shif or lie exposed at the edge of the sea ; those passing between Bushire and the interior are transferred from boat to car avan or vice versa at this spot. The route via Shif to Borazjun is 10 miles shorter than the overland route via Ahmadi. Shif is visible from the high part of the Bushire peninsula ; at the former there is nothing but a sand spit on which stands a ruined serai, which affords shelter for two road guards, who run a qahveh Jchdneh or coffee shop. There is no water at the place for man or beast; mules coming down from the interior, after dropping their loads, are hurried back 20 miles or so to water at Khushab Naukar or other villages on the higher plain, yet the post at Shif is farmed out by the Persian authorities to the Tufangchi Bashi or chief of the road guards who is reported to have paid 5,000 tumdns in 1903 for the place. The road guards do not elect to live at this desolate spot for charity’s sakesand the Tufangchi Bash! recovers more than he paid on the post by blackmail and road-cess levied on chdrvdddrs and travellers. {Felly Staeh — Curzon, 1889 —Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905 — Newcomen, 1904. ^ SHIJAIRAT— A division of the Bani Hardan tribe (q. v.).

It is situated on the right bank of a stream in a fertile and well-watered plain about 7 miles wide, surrounded by mountains. Rich gardens and vineyards exist in its vicinity. The stream, which sometimes has a certain volume of water from December to April, is usually dry for the rest of the year, the water being used for irrigation purposes. It empties itself into the salt lake,the upper margin of which is perhaps 12 miles from Shiraz in a south-easterly direc tion. Five miles south of Shiraz, the valley is separated from an extensive marsh by a low range of hills. Troops. —Approximately 600 infantry, 6 camel guns, 6 muzzle-loading brass guns and a brass band. Discipline, equipment, physique, and effi ciency alike on the lowest conceivable level. The city, quarters and population. —The city is irregularly circular in shape, flanked by semi-circular towers, rising some feet above the parapet which is bounded by a dry ditch. Both towers and wall are in bad repair : the latter, in some instances, having fallen and filled up the ditch, so that it 1 is quite easy to ride through the gaps. The southern wall is in tolerablerepair. The circumference of the wall is about 4 miles, but in more recent and peaceful times the suburbs have become enlarged, so that the original outline is no longer clearly traceable. Shiraz, like all other Persian towns, has a certain number of deserted houses, which are allowed to fall into ruins, though it compares favourably with most of them in this respect. More than half of the enclosed area of the city is taken up with hazars, maiddns, the Governor’s place, gardens, stables and other public buildings, leaving the remaining space for occupa tion by the inhabitants. The city has six gates, viz., 1, Isfahan ; 2, Bagh-i-Shah ; 3, Kazarun; 4, Shah Da’i; 5, Qassab Khaneh; 6, Sa’id : and is divided into 11 quarters. A writer in the Farsnameh-i-Nasirl, published in 1895, quoting a census stated to have been taken in 1883, gives the total population of Shiraz, at the latter date, as males 25,284 and females 28,323 ; total 53,607. From the same census he furnishes the following details :— f ’ Quarter. j Houses. Males. Females. 1. Jshak Beg 687 2,720 2,710 2. Bazar-i-Murgh 318 1,510 1,638 3. Mala Kift 1,036 3,870 4,497 4.

Jews’ quarter 222 930 1,040 6,327 : 25,340 28,732 Reliable statistics in regard to the Moslem quarters, of later date, are not forthcoming ; but a census of the Jews’ quarter, taken in 1905, gives correct ed statistics as follows : houses 296 ; population, male and female, 6,829. Assuming that the whole population has been increasing, even slowly, during the past twelve years, it is estimated that, allowing for an extraordinary mortality of 5,000 during the cholera epidemic of 1904, the numbers at the present time (1905) cannot be less than 60,000 persons of all classes. In former days the first five quarters of the city, as above, and forming its east ern portion, were known as Haidar Khaneh, from the devotion of their in habitants to Sultan Haidar, ancestor and spiritual head of the Safavi dy nasty ; the remaining five, or western quarter were called the Ni’mat Khaneh from Shah Ni’mat Ullah, founder of the Darvish order, bearing his name. These distinctions, often leading to conflicts of a sanguinary nature between the two factions, have almost disappeared in the last sixty or seventy years. The Shirazi is of a less mixed Iranian type than is encountered elsewhere, as is evident from the darker complexions and clear-cut features, the brown840 SHI—SHI hair and blue or grey eyes of the northern provinces being rarely met with. The cheerful temperament attributed by early travellers to the inhabitants has been somewhat exaggerated. They are easily excited and sometimes prone to outbursts of intolerance. The Babi movement started in Shi az and has always claimed a large number of disciples, while the population includes a certain proportion of Armenians. TheMullasof Shiraz bear an unenviable reputation for intolerance and fanaticism, and may be regarded as the greatest obstacles to education and civilisation. Public buildings and objects of interest in the neighbourhood.—There are in Shiraz fifty considerable mosques, besides many others of inferior note to a total number of fifty—eleven colleges, fourteen bazars, thirteen caravan serais, and fifty-six baths. Of all the mosques, the Masjid-i-’Ali, built in the Khalifat of the house of ’Abbas, is the most ancient. The Masjid-i- Nau, the largest mosque, not only in Shiraz, but also throughout Persia, was originally the palace of AtabakShah, who, in a dangerous illness of his son, consulted the Mullas, and was answered (as the only means of the recovery of his child) that “ he must devote to the Almighty that which of all his worldly goods he valued most.” He accordingly converted his palace into a mosque, and the Muhammadans add that his son was in consequence restored to health. Stack calls this also the mcst anc’ent of all the mosques. The Masjid-i-Jama’ is likewise claimed to be the oldest of the mosques of Shiraz; its construction being ascribed to Amr Bin Lais Saffar, about A.D. 894. There are six others of a date previous to that of Karim Khan Zand. Of the more modern mosques of Shiraz the Masjid-i-\ akil, the only one built by the last named Prince, is the most beautiful. Karim Khan began to build ^college, but never finished it; there were already six, one of the earliest of which (that founded by Imam Quli Khan) is still the most popular. Another was added by Hashim, father of Haji Ibrahim, the Vazir of Path ’AH Shah, and the Pish Namaz and Mujtahid (Chief Priest of the city) built another. .. The principal cdrai'dnserais, in which the better class of mer chants and Sardfs have their offices, either open off the Bazar-i-Vakil or are situated in close proximity to it. Of the former may be mentioned the Caravanse^ai-i-Gumruk, Raugani (chiefly inhabited by Zardashti merchants), Fil and Quvvam ; among the latter the best known are those of Mushir-ul-Mulk (or Gulshan) and of Agha Jan. In former times, there existed the caravanserai of Qaisarieh Khan, built by Imam Quli Khan, of which the name only now exists; the ground on which it stood, is now used for the tanning of lambskins. Other caravanserais were the Dabbaghan, or that of the dressers of sheep- si, ins ; the Rangrizan or that of the dyers ; and the Hinduan, where the Hindus resided. The very names of these have faded out of memory. Karim Khan enriched this capital with three public baths, two within and one without the town. Four have since been raised, but there were already before his reign nineteen similar foundations, while many later ones have been built. There are several mausoleums* in Shiraz; the most distin guished of those without the walls being those of Hafiz and Sa’adi ; there * The three most beautiful tombs are (as regards these domes) Shah Chiragh con spicuous by its blue dome, Saiyid Nur Muhammad, and Saiyid Alleh-ud-Din Husain.— (Durand,)sm-sm 841 is also beyond the city the dargah of Mir ’AH, son of Mirza Hamzeh, and grandson of the Imam Musa. While the houses of Shiraz are, in general srna , and the streets narrow and filthy, the great bazar, built by Karim Khan, and commonly called the Bazar-i-Vakil, situated at the north-east comer of the city, forms a distinguished exception to this general description. It is built in the shape of a cross and is about 500 yards in length 120 yards in breadth, made of yellow burnt brick with a vaulted roof, 22 feet high, and a central dome at the inter section of its arms. It has numerous skylights, which, with its doors and windows, always admit sufficient light and air, whilst the sun and ram are completely excluded. This bazar is allotted to the different raders of the city, all of whom have their assigned quarters, which they possess under strict regulations, and it is well supplied with goods imported nf°wnr I ^ ia ’ ^ ns ^ nt 1 lno P le and Russia. The shops display good specimens km gold and silver, as well as of copper and brass work, cotton-goods, tobacco, spices and dried fruits, and European tinned and other goods. Local provisions of excellent quality of butchers’ meat (mutton), bread, vegetables and fruit—the last of most luscious appearance and quality—are ound in abundance. The Ark, or citadel, in which the Governor-General of Pars resides is a rectangular building about 80 yards square, with large pen spaces on ree sides. The palace within is far from being an elegant structure ; the pillars of the Divan Khaneh, its greatest ornament, having been removed by Agha Muhammad Khan to adorn his palace at Tehran requent earthquake shocks have caused much damage to several of the principal buildings. The parishes of Shiraz have been celebrated by many different persons, and notably by Hafiz (the Anacreon of the East) who was a native of this city and is buried in a small garden, about half a mile north-west of the town. The tomb of the poet was erected by Kar- mi Khan, and is a plain block of white marble in the form of a coffin on which are inscribed two of his poems and the date of his death. His works are not, as has been stated, chained to his tomb ; but a splendid copy of them is always kept in an adjoining house. The simple dignity of the great poet s resting-place has, however, been sadly marred by the erec tion over it in 1701, by Prince Shu’a-us-Saltaneh, Governor-General of Pars ot a tawdry painted, iron structure surmounted by tin flags. Not far from t e fomb of Hafiz is the garden of Jehan Numa, known in the time of Karim as the Vakil s garden. It was formerly reputed to be the most beautiful m the neighbourhood of Shiraz, but is now almost entirely shorn of its former charms. Other gardens are the Bagh-i-Takht, the property of the hu a-us-Saltaneh; the Bagh-i-Nau, the property of the Imperial Bank o Persia and the residence of their European officials ; the Bagh-i-Iran Dilkusha and Gulshan. The last, the property of the Quvvam-ul-Mulk’s younger son, Nasr-ud-Dauleh, is now the finest garden of Shiraz. In a gorge behind the garden of Dilkusha, and about a mile and a half north of e town, m a little walled garden, is the resting-place of the immortal Sa’adi. At one end of the garden is a building containing some small rooms in the centre and an arched divan on either side, in one of which with plain white washed, unpretentious walls, behind a tall brass lattice or screen, reposes the 1121. B - - *843 SHI—SHI sarcophagus of the poet. This is an oblong chest of stone, open at the top, and covered with inscriptions in Arabic. Stack considers the most remark able relics of antiquity near Shiraz to be three wells on a rocky hill, 2 miles north-east of the city, the origin of which is unknown. They are probably older than the Muhammadan conquest. The hill is about 500 feet high, and very steep, seemingly composed of sandstone and limestone. Two of the deepest of these wells are on the side facing the city, the mouth of the larger being about 7 feet by 5, and its depth nearly 500 feet. The shaft evidently sinks through the whole depth of the hill, and is hewn in the solid limestone and smoothly cut; the side being perfectly plumb. The third well at the back of the hill has seats, or ledges, cut in the rock above it. Remains of old fortifications encompass the summit of the hill, while from the topmost peak the whole plain of Shiraz can be seen, as well as the salt lake of Meharlu, 20 miles to the east. The city itself is a compact area in the landscape, overhung with smoke, and adorned by three blue domes. Most historians have agreed that the city of Shiraz was founded in or about the year A. D. 694 by Muhammad, son of Yusuf Zaki: but Curzon dissents from this History and Administration. version and ascribes its more probable and original foundation to the Ache- menian or Sassanian kings. The city was much improved and beautified by the Dilami rulers, of whom the Samsam-ud-Dauleh, son of the famous Asad-ud-Dauleh, was the first to surround it with a wall 12 miles in circuit. The various dynasties of the Atabaks, who governed Ears with Shiraz as their capital, still further, adorned it. The city con tinued during the 15th century to grow in prosperity till, with the disap pearance of local dynasties and the centralisation of Persia that followed on the accession of the Safavi line, it lost much of its importance. With various vicissitudes, the decline of Shiraz continued till 1751, when Karim Khan Zand, ruling on behalf of a Safavi puppet, rebuilt the walls of stone which had disappeared, and further adorned the city with many beautiful buildings. With the fall of Lutf ’Ali Khan and the triumph of the Kajars, the stone walls were levelled to the ground and replaced by the present mean erections of mud, and Shiraz was degraded from the rank and appearance of a capital to that of a provincial town. Its govern ment, however, remained an appanage of royalty, and has usually been held by a member of the ruling family. Path ’All Shah was Governor- General of Ears in his uncle’s lifetime, and, when Shah himself, deputed more than one of his sons to the post. In the reign of the late Shah, Nasr-ud-Din, the office was filled by several of his relatives. The most conspicuous of these was an uncle, Farhad Mirza, who earned a widespread reputation for bad government and pitiless severity. Ears was one of the many governments united in the person of the Zill-us-Sultan in the early eighties. A succession of weak but rapacious governors has resulted in later years in riots in Shiraz itself, and in the unsettled condition of the whole province of Ears. The Quvvam-ul-Mulk, the hereditary mayor or Beglar-begi of Shiraz, was largely responsible for the most serious disturbances, brought about by a system of raising money which not infrequently commends itself to Persian Governors, but less so to the people. It consists in buying up all the available grain and reselling it at greatly enhanced prices. This proceed ing caused a riot in 1886 which was suppressed by force by the Quyvnia#SHI—SHI 84:3 fir? In doing so lie incidentally shot down some of the populace in the mosque of Shah Chiragh. This act of sacrilege caused him to be held in the greatest detestation by the people. In 189^occurred the tobacco riots in which the leader was a fanatical Mulla Haji Saiyid ’AH Akbar. Seized and banished for his share in the disturbances, he was never theless permitted to return in the ensuing year, when he was greeted with frantic enthusiasm by the populace and henceforward became a power in Shiraz. In 1892, on the assumption of the Governorship by the Rukn-ud-Dauleh, a brother of Nasr-ud-din Shah, the Quvvam was degraded, imprisoned, and forced to leave the city, but, on the Rukn-ud-Dauleh himself falling into disgrace with the central authority, he re-entered the city with the incoming Governor in 1893 and returned to his old tactics of “cornering” the grain. The Quvvam-ul-Mulk, in addition to his office in Shiraz, is also the Ilkhani of the ’Arab and Bahar tribes, and by quarter ing a number of these in the city, and dispossessing the towns people from their dwellings to accommodate them, as well as by degrading the copper coinage in value, he still further increased his unpopularity. A riot of a serious nature in which Saiyid ’Ali Akbar was a conspicuous leader was the result, and in the suppression of it the most lamentable weakness and incapacity was displayed both by the provincial Governor and by the Shah himself. The disturbance was only quelled by the Quvvam being again forced to leave the city, and by the demands of the populace being grant ed. Although the riot was in no sense directed against the English, the lives of the Indo-European Telegraph staff and of the British Agent in Shiraz, an Indian by name Nawab Haidar ’Ali Khan, were for some days in jeopardy. One of the most recent Governors, the Shu’a-us-Sal- taneh, a younger son of the present Muzuffar-ud-Din Shah, who succeeded to the Governorship in 1901, incurred considerable odium by his harsh government and by again “cornering” grain ; and a somewhat serious riot resulted, during which the Persian telegraph offices were wrecked. Dur ing the disturbances the Quvvam-ul-Mulk was appointed Acting Governor, but he did little to satisfy the people, and the prince was eventually rein stated. This Prince is reported to have greatly broken the power of the Mullas during his tour of office. This same Prince' was re-appointed Governor-General of Ears in 1904 ; but his rapacity and bad government led to further serious disturbances, and his removal after a second period of some 18 months of office. British and other Foreign officials .—The British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who is directly under the Indian Foreign Department, also holds the office of Consul-General of Fars under the Foreign Office in London,, Whilst his residence for the most of the year is at Bushire, he usually spends some of the summer months at Shiraz. His residence here is in a fine, extensive garden, about half a mile outside and to the north-west of the city, immediately adjoining the Bagh-i-Shaikh, in which are located the office and houses of the staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, who have a qualified doctor. In July 1903, a British Consul was appointed with a permanent residence at Shiraz ; while a few months later the British Agent referred to above was retired. Other Foreign Powers directly repre sented here are Russia and France. In the case of the former country, the 5 0 2844 SHI—SHI arrangement approximates with that made by Great Britain ; their repre sentative being Consul-General for the Province of Pars, with residence for most months of the year at Bushire. The Russian Consulate is also situated to the north-west of the city, but on its immediate outskirts. A French Consular Agent has been appointed for the first time and as lately as 1905. The Indo-European Telegraph Company have one of their most important branches located, as mentioned above, in the Bagh-i-Shaikh. The admin istration of the line, from Shiraz southwards to Bushire and northwards as far as Abadeh, is invested in the Superintendent in charge. Telephone communication is kept up southwards with Dasht-i-Arjan and northwards with Sivand. The Imperial Bank of Persia also has one of its chief branches established here, in charge of a manager with several European assistants. This Bank was established in 1889 under a British Royal Charter, a concession for its formation having been granted by the Shah to Baron Julius de Ruyter. It is for all practical purposes the State Bank of Persia and enjoys the monopoly of issuing a paper currency. The notes thus issued are only guaranteed negotiable with the branch of issue: but to a reasonable amount, by arrangement, they are practically negotiable at all branches. The offices are located in the western portion of the city; while the residences of its European officials are in the Bagh-i-Nau, situated in the fine avenue leading through the suburb of Deh-i-Buzurg, about half-way between the archway through the Quran Hivdeh Man and the Isfahan gate of the city. The plain of Shiraz, dotted with gardens and small villages, well-watered . ,,, .... and highly cultivated, is girt about with barren mountains, snow-capped during the winter months; but with the exception of the Kuh-i-BarfI to the west, seldom retaining any vestige of snow after May. The climate is, on the whole, dry, though heavy dew falls in the spring, and during the cold weather there is a moderate rainfall. The winter, lasting from the beginning of December to the middle of February, is usually not severe, though it generally freezes at night, with occasional heavy falls of snow. On the plain this seldom remains for more than a few days at a time, though the surrounding mountains are snow-capped for some months. The weather in spring is very genial and pleasant, but the sun begins to be hot in the middle of the day in April. July and August are the hottest months, but fortunately the nights are comparatively cool, especially in the open. All travelling from May to September is usually done in the early morning or evening, and this holds good throughout the interior of Persia. The direct rays of the sun are felt through the day rarifying the atmosphere out of all proportion to the general temperature. The temperature seldom remains at a high degree for more than three or four days at a time ; but a south-west wind during the summer months is often unpleasantly warm and relaxing. In spite of the praises lavished on the climate by former travellers, there seems little doubt that it is often trying to Europeans, and there is a consensus of opinion amongsc residents that the climate is less good than at first sight appears ; though excellent in winter and spring, it is spoilt in the summer and autumn by the pre valence of malarial fever. There was a severe cholera epidemic in 1904.General Climatic Conditions. Rain may be expected between 21st November and 15th April; occa-^ sional showers from the latter date to 31st May. Rain rarely falls more than three days in succession. Snoiv may be expected at anytime between 15th December and 1st April, rarely later than date. On the Shiraz plain it seldom lies for more than a day, but on the passes between Shiraz and Kazarun (Kutal-i-Dukhtar, Kutal-i-Pir Zan, etc.) it may lie from three to eight days or even longer. A like remark applies to the higher portion of the road from Shiraz to Yazd-i-Khast (Isfahan). Cold .—During the cold season, which may be taken to extend from 1st January to the middle or even end of March, the nights are often intensely cold. Thus on 28th January IDOSat 7-30 A. M., the thermometer stood at 17° Fahr. and on January 10th, 1907, at 5-30 a. M.,at 18° Fahr. Such excessive cold, however, would appear to be rare from the fact that orange and lemon trees grow unprotected in and round Shiraz. Heat begins about the end of June or beginning of July lasting till about the 26th of August, when (to judge from the experience of three summers) there would appear to be always a marked fall in the temperature. Hot days occur after this date, but a succession of hot days is rare. (This fact is known to and noted by the Persians, who ascribe this change to the rising of “ Satareh-i-Khunuk”—cool star.) Even during the hottest weather the nights are generally cool. Occasionally when the warm wind blows from the south or south-west the nights are unpleasantly warm. It is both possible and beneficial to sleep in the open air from May to October or even later. No shelter is required. Up to the end of September there is practically no dew and only occasionally after that date. There is sometimes a recrudescence of heat in October. Wind .—The prevailing wind would appear to be from south-west—often in summer hot and enervating. No facilities for gauging winds. Marching seasons .—The best are from 1st April to middle or end of May, and from 21st September to 15th November or even later in the year. There is an utter absence of sanitation or any organised system of drain age, each house having its own badly constructed cesspool, cleared out at the will of the individual, thus rendering the whole sub-soil saturated with refuse matter. The water itself is good, but, owing to a bad system of transporta tion into the town by means of qandts, which are in some sections open, it is easily infected and during an epidemic practically out of control within the city walls. Considering the unsanitary condition of the town with its badly planned and crowded houses, dirty, narrow streets, uncontrolled water- supply and absence of any system of drainage, Shiraz is singularly free from epidemics of specific diseases ; and the reason why the more or less periodic (usually annual) epidemics of diphtheria, small-pox, enteric, chicken- pox and measles do not cause a larger mortality is inconceivable. These epidemics usually occur either in spring or autum, with dysentery some what severe during the height of the summer. Epidemics of cholera occur at intervals of a decade or more; the disease being imported either from the Gulf or from the western frontier. The last epidemic of 1904 was, in comparison with that of former years, very severe, the846 SHI—SHI mortality being probably not less than 5,000. The specific infectious diseases—typhus; rubella ; intermittent, scarlet, dengue and yellow fever ; beri beri; plague ; hydrophobia ; and actinous cases—are practical ly unknown, at least during the five years ending 1905. Cases of anthrax, tetanus and leprosy are occasionally, though rarely, seen. The only striking points about the health conditions of Shiraz are the marked number of cases of diseases of the cornea and conjunctive, dyspepsia, ascites and ven ereal diseases. Communications .—The following table gives the main routes from Shiraz to other localities, which must be carried out entirely by mule caravan except that to Isfahan, which may be accomplished by chapar and carriage.

Pos*—Isfahan by bi-weekly waggon ; Bushire and J hrum weekly Con sular Courier, Isfahan and Bushire occasionally. Chdpdr service to Isfahan is practically replaced by post waggons, 2 only sufficient; horses are kept to allow thq latter to be served with fresh horses. Of these routes, the most important from a commercial point of view, and the most frequented, is that from Bushire through Shiraz to Isfahan' Ihs direction Bushire-Shiraz involves the passage of six difficult passes, tiH highest of which rises to / ,000 feet, and is passable only for mule traffic. In the spring months good grazing and the caravans then move by short stages to allow the animals time to feed. The average time occupied in the transport of merchandise between Bushire and Shiraz is from 12 to 15 ? days, and double that period in the grazing season. More rapid transport can be obtained at higher rates. The security of travellers and merchandise by this route is not properly safeguarded. The European is comparatively safe, but native travellers are blackmailed by the road guards and robberiesSHI-SHI 847 are often committed. The road via, Firdzabad is easier, but is not fre quented on account of the disturbed state of Tangistan. The Section— Shirdz-Isfahdn —is of an easier character and camels share the work of transports with the mules. The post-office mails and passengers are now carried between Surmaq and Isfahan (1 mile) by wagon or carriage, and as far as Surmaq ( miles) by chdpdr. Through freight is sometimes engaged from Shiraz to Tehran, in which case caravans diverge to the right from the trunk road at Surmaq, and, following nearly parallel tracks, pass to the east of Isfahan near Sazi and so strike the Natanz-Kashan road. It is stated by chdrvdddrs that this road is easier for animals and forage is cheaper. Since the end of March 1906, the post office mails have been carried between Shiraz and Isfahan by wagon, passengers being taken by carriage. Transport rates.—Mule hire from Bushire to Shiraz during the year 1904 fluctuated between 80 and 90 krdns per khamdr, or 100 Tabriz maunds of 6| lbs. each, or from £4-10-0 to £5 per ton. Camel hire varied between 90 and 100 krdns per 100 Tabriz maunds, or from £5 to £5-10-0 per ton. There being a greater demand for carriage from the south to the north than from the north to the south, the rates of hire southward as a rule rarely exceed half those demanded for the north ward journey. Travellers engaging a caravan and travelling by the accept ed stages without halts pay about double the rates here laid down for mer chandise. Agriculture .—The vicinity of Shiraz has been mentioned as exceedingly fertile. Cereals, vines, melons, vegetables of all kinds, opium, cotton and tobacco are extensively cultivated. Fir, cypress and orange trees also thrive, though the last named are not found farther north. The vineyards have been much extended of late years, and particular attention is paid to cultivation of the Khullar grape as making the best wine. This grape takes its name from Khullar, a village lying a short distance from Shiraz. Sir Thomas Gordon in his remarks on Shiraz writes that the climate is here so temperate and equable as to bring together the fruits and birds of the east and west, north and south. For here the Indian ‘ bulbul ’ and ‘hoopoe’ meet the European nightingale, the magpie, and the cuckoo, and the fruits range from apples to dates. Locusts cause much damage to crops in certain years, and the failure of the grain harvest is the not infrequent consequence. In 1893, two-thirds of the opium and the greater part of the cotton crop were destroyed by these pests, while the wheat crop in the neighbourhood of Shiraz also suffered considerably. In the ensuing year, it was calculated that taking a circle of 60 miles round Shiraz as the district from which in normal years the town derives its supply of wheat, it might fairly be assumed that out of the crop of 20,000,000 maunds (of 6|lbs) five-sixths were eaten by locusts. Industries .—The chief local manufactures carried on in Shiraz are— Gilims, or rough carpets without pile. These are made of wool or goats’ hair. Some are exported to Aden and Jiddah, but the majority are for local ! use. The finer kind of carpets of wool or of camels’ hair, known as Shiraz, 1 are made chiefly by the llidts, by whom they are brought into Shiraz for848 SHI—SHI sale. These carpets have a good reputation both in regard to their texture and their patterns. Saddle-bags are also made of the same material as carpets and gillms, and are exported in fair quantity. Namad, or felt, is used for rugs, coats for men and clothing for horses. Tents and curtains —Made of a rough cotton cloth called “Karbas,” similar to the Indian dungaree. The tents are in great local demand, but are also exported to ’Arabistan. The curtains are used for screening the sides of houses from the sun and, in winter, to promote warmth. “ Karbds ” the cloth above-mentioned. “ Nassdji ” are native coloured cloths, used as sheets, towels, etc. “ Tirimeh ” shawls, an imitation of the Cashmere shawl, but of an inferior class and only used locally. Inlaid work, an industry for which Shiraz has long been famous. All sorts of articles, such as picture-frames, boxes, etc., are made for export, but as the demand increases, the workmanship deteriorates, and the very fine work of the past is almost a lost art. Wages have not increased in proportion to the cost of living. Silver work is a speciality, and the productions much sought after by Europeans. Qalidns, the hukah of Persia, some of which are very beautifully worked in the precious metals. The bowls are generally formed of a cocoanut, the more costly description mounted with silver and gold. The prices vary from Is. to £-30. Bough brown 'payer made from rags of an inferior kind. Country soap made from fat, ashes, and lime. It is used for washing clothes and in the public baths. Soap is not an article in great demand in Persia. Small arms. —Guns, pistols, and even revolvers are made by hand. The action of the Martini-Henry has been copied and really good weapons are turned out, the best being valued at £25. Shot guns and match locks are the most usually made and are sold to villagers and tribesmen, but the makers are unable to compete with the imported article and the trade is de teriorating. Gunsmiths in Persia are quite capable of replacing a broken gunstock. Swords, daggers and cutlery .—The manufactures of Shiraz were once famous and there is even now a demand for their wares in Turkish Arabia and Turkey. This industry has much declined since the introduction of firearms, but there is still a fairly large local demand. As cutlers, the Shirazis are expert workmen, but they find it hard to compete with machine-made goods. Combs made of ebony, sandalwood, etc., find a considerable local demand and are largely exported to India and Jiddah. Matting of a better quality for prayer and sleeping mats, and also a common quality of reed mats. Papier Mdche. —This was once a considerable industry and included the making and painting of fancy articles such as pen-cases. It has now de clined and inferior articles only are manufactured. Silk. —Formerly an extensive industry, which has now been lost sight of owing to the disease among the silkworms.^ass-irare.—Imported goods have stunted and almost ruined this manu facture. It is now restricted to the making of bottles for the export of wine, rosewater, and lime-juice. Earthenware. —This manufacture gives employment to a large number of people. It includes the making of kiln-baked jars for wine and vinegar making, sun-dried jars for storing grain, lamps and .pottery for various household purposes, and bricks both plain and ornamental. Lime .—Of fair quality for local requirements, and a good quality of cement is made. Tanning skins .—Provides employment to a number of people. Print making .—Though insignificant as compared with the same industry in Isfahan, it is not inconsiderable. Starch-making .—Starch made from wheat is largely used in the manu' facture of sweet-meats. An inferior quality is made for sizing cloth. Henna .—Is in great demand as a dye and there is scarcely a street with out its henna shop. Hats .—Both of felt and Astrakhan are largely manufactured. The lat ter are chiefly used by the towns people, the better classes using real lamb skin and the poorer, imitation Astrakhan. A large trade in felt hats is done with the tribesmen. Oil. —Is made from linseed and sesame. The latter is used for food as well as for burning. Foot-wear, in the shape of maliki, a shoe of which the upper part is woven of cotton, and the soles made of rags beaten into hard rolls, and strung together on several strips of leather laid lengthwise, is a speciality of Shiraz manufacture. They are exported to all parts of Persia as well as supplying a large local demand. Wine and Arrack. —The wine of Shiraz is freely made and sold publicly by Jews and Armenians. Tavernier in 1666 gave the annual produce of Shiraz as 4,125 tons of 300 pints each. It is of two kinds, red and white. The former has the appearance of and tastes like dark sherry, and the latter like a moist, thin Chablis. It is ridiculously cheap, being sold at about 6d. a bottle. It is kept in large jars and sold in glass bottles of various sizes, hold ing from a quart to two or three gallons. The manufacture of these bottle s gives employment to a large number of people. Vinegar. —Made from the juice of the grape with a quantity of salt added. Salt. —Obtained from the mountains and the salt lake : very cheap. Dairy produce. —Also forms an industry, especially the making pf * raughan ’ or clarified butter. Trade and Commerce.' —The trade of Shiraz (1904) may be valued at 6 million tumdns (krdns 60,000,000) or at the prevailing rate of exchange £1,000,000 sterling, e.g., the capital employed therein. The principal products of the province are opium, cotton, carpets and saddle-bags, gum tragacanth, gum arabic, gum ganjideh (used for adulterating opium), almonds, sweet and bitter, apricot kernels, cow and other skins, sheep, goat and lamb skins, goats’ hair and wool, tobacco, rosewater, raisins, wine, sheeps’ entrails, hoofs, horns, etc. 112 I.

Nearly all the piece-goods are of British make with a percentage of German and French : though recently (1904) there have been very heavy deliveries of Russian goods on the market. The distribution of trade is made in the following manner :—Substantial middlemen, styled bunakddrs, buy the bale, or other largish though limited quantity from the importing firms, and sell by the roll to smaller men, who again retail by measure, goods passing through four and sometimes five hands from factory to consumer.

The clipping season is on just before the nomad tribes move fromSHI—SHI 851 the ydlldq or warm country, where they spend the winter, to the sardslr or upland region, and the clip is collected either by nomad chiefs or by traders, and sent down to Bushire. All export business is done from the ports. The wool produced in the interior is all used for carpets and blan kets. There is a large export trade in carpets with Egypt, Jiddah and Baghdad. The value of this trade in 1904 is stated to have been tumdns 500,000' (£83,330). Kirman carpets are sold in grades at a certain price per carpet zar\ Qashqal and Arab carpets produced in Ears are, however, sold by the piece and not by measure. Woollen goods are imported in limited quantity by the European firms here, from whom the few shop keepers, who handle this class of merchandise in the bazars, are replen ished. The retail dealers are known as Simsdzes or Simsdrs. Cotton.—The trade in raw cotton is now almost entirely with Russia. It has been seriously checked by the Russo-Japanese war, but, even so, Persian growers and dealers find the Russian market offers them better prices than does Bombay. Some cotton is still, however, sent to Bombay, where it is used for mixing with better qualities. The cotton passes in purchase from producers to middlemen and thence to shippers. Some 4,000 bales of cotton are used locally in the manufacture of a coarse cloth of narrow width, resembling the Indian garrah and known as karbds. The prices in 1904 of the raw cotton ranged from3f krdns to 6J krdns per Tabrizi man of 6| lbs. Cotton fabrics. —Till very Acently the British manufactures and shippers had the market entirely in their own hands, and Russian stuff was rarely seen on the market. Now, however, Russia has begun sending her fabrics, and especially her prints, down south, and the bazars are full of Russian pro duce. The rush is an artificial one entirely, and every sale entails heavy loss to the Russian manufacturer and Government. The average loss by the varying exchange is great, and to this must be added drawbacks and other accommodations and assisted freights. The Russian prints are copies of English designs, lacking somewhat in finish, but the cloth, though narrow of width, is universally described as good, though more coarse than English, unloaded and dyed in fast colours. Since Russia began to work in Shiraz it is said British imports have fallen off by about 4,000 bales per annum. Madder. —No madder is produced in the vicinity of Shiraz, but about 1,000 cwts. of root are handled on the Shiraz market. Shiraz imports this from Isfahan, Yazd and Abrquh. About 300 cwts. are exported again, going mostly to Bombay. The rest is used in Ears. Price per (650 lbs.) tumdns 8| to 9|. O'pium. —Three thousand chests (of 27 tumdn Tabrizi) are exported to Hong-Kong and to England, and 500 chests used locally. The heavy ex* port duty placed on opium, lately increased from 5 to 14 per cent, ad valorem, and the fact that it used to be very largely adulterated with gum ganjideh (CrF) hit the export opium trade very hard. There are many grades of opium. Prices range at present according to quality from 20 tumdns to 34 tumdns per Shiraz man of 7'25 lbs. Gum, tragacanth. —Shiraz is the great collecting, sorting and distributing centre for the gum, some of the stuff, about 30,000 mans Tabrizi, coming from as far away as Rafsinjan and Hamadan. Some of the best and purest gum, though this is not equal to the best that finds the sea at AhwSz, is produced 6 P 2852 SHI—SHI near Bajgah, not far from the town. The United Kingdom and India take about half of what Persia produces, and Russia about a quarter. The gum is sorted into five main classes. In sorting, the waste averages 4 per cent. The following are approximate quantities and average prices :— Ganjideh. —This is tasteless and odourless gum, which looks not unlike gum arabic. A few years ago the gum was almost valueless. Then its use as an adulterant for opium was discovered. The price went up at once, till the gum was fetching 50 to 80 krdns per man Tabrizi, and ‘ ‘ opium ” was being exported to China that was over 90 per cent, ganjideh, until the fraud was discovered. Opium is still adulterated with ganjideh, but t mostly for the home market, and, though enquiries have been made from China, where men would not mind getting hold of such an excellent adulter ant, ganjideh quotations have now dropped to 10 krdns and 4 krdns. . Gum ar ahic (ooz oo and zedoo) 50,000 to 70,000 maws Tabriz! come into the market, and the quantity exported is a little less than § of the price according to quality 1| to 2|- krdns. * Almonds. Shelled, 202,500 mans Tabrizi, exported. Price 9 krdns to 12 mms per man. Unshelled, about the same amount, price 2 krdns 5 shais to 2 krdns 15 shais per man. Raisins. Maviz or black, 15,000 mans Tabrizi, price 1 krdn 12 shais to 1 kran 18 shais per man. Kishmish. (Sultanas), 12,000 mans Tabrizi, price 2 krdns to 2 krdns 10 shais per man.

SHIR KUH— Lat. Long. Elev. 13,740 , . A peak of a range of mountains to the south-west of Yazd. Smith thinks it probable that this range is a continuation of the Quhrud range of ’Iraq. The Shir Kuh bounds the valley of Deh Bala on the north-west side. The last 700 or 800 feet of the mountain rise abruptly in a sheer wall of rock. Vide also this Gazetteer—Deh Bala.— {Smith — Vaughan, 1890.) SHlRVAN— Lat. Long. Elev. 3,300'. A richly cultivated valley in Luristan west of the Lura Kuh range, 105 miles west of Khurramabad on the road to Deh. Water and forage are abundant, and wood from the valleys of the Malagaun range to the south west. Supplies are obtainable. Camp room is found on spurs in the vicinity. There is a village in the valley and some ruins near to it. {Burton, Se ft ember 1897.) SHISH BULUKl— A clan of Qashqai Iliats in north-western Ears. They inhabit a tract stretching from the district of Dashti to Farrashband and on to Asupas near Kushk-i-Zard. They number approximately 3,000 families. They have herds and about 300 mules.— {Ross.) SHISH DEH— Lat. 28° 55' N. Long. 54° 2' E. Elev. 4,670'. A village in the Fasa district of Ears, lying rather north of east from Fasa town and 25 miles from that town on the road to Darab. It lies in a plain of the same name, and contains 200 houses. The inhabitants number 700, and are of a somewhat forbidding caste of countenance and inclined to be rude and uncivil. They own 60 oxen, 1,500 sheep, and 50 donkeys, but no mules. 6,000 mans of barley and wheat and 80 mans of poppy seed are sown here annually. The plain is shut in by high hills and mountains. It extends from the west to east and south-east and is of inconsiderable breadth. The plain has numerous water-courses some dry, some with running water, and a number of wells about the Kaleh Kara Bulagh portions. The soil is exceptionally good and rich, nearly approaching that of the black earth zone of southern Russia.—(A66o«—Preece, 1884.) SHISH PlR (River)— A river in Ears which rises between Dilkhan and Ardakan, west of the Gar- daneh Yuzgird, at an elevation of 7,800 feet. The river issues in a stream 20 feet broad and 2 feet in depth, from underneath a rock in the hills. The water is intensely cold and flows rapidly down the valley in a south westerly direction. It is crossed 8| miles from Ardakan on the road to Uakum by a small bridge, with 2 main arches and 4 smaller ones. The para pet is of stone and is one foot high ; the roadway is 8 feet, and is paved and clear. At this point the river comes from a cleft in the hills to the c ast In January it is easily fordable on both sides of the bridge. One mile fromSHI—SHI 861 here it is joined by the Ardakan stream. At 16| miles south of Bakum the river is crossed by the road from that village to Rudian. It is here a fine, clear stream, 50 feet broad and 18 inches deep, and very swift. From here it runs between precipitous clifis and disappears, emerging again at Rudian. At Rudian it is crossed by a wooden bridge made of trunks of trees and mud and stones. The bridge is very shaky and is quite impassable for guns. It is joined here by another considerable stream, both of the rivers being unfordable in most places. The river then flows west towards Kaleh Safid which is perched on a cliff on its left bank. The river is bright, deep and clear, with bright green water. It is said that Shiraz was in former days supplied with water from the Shish Pir valley.—(Dwrawd— Vaughan, 1890.) • SHIT ALl YEH— A canal in the Fallahleh district of Southern’Arabistan on the right bank of the Jarrahi river, with which it is connected. It irrigates 3 fadddns of country cultivated by Ka’b ’Arabs, chiefly Muqaddam, who grow wheat and barley.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) SHITVAR— Lat. (west end) 26° 47' 19' N. ; Long. 53° 16' 54'E. Elev. An islet, 1 mile long and | mile broad, off the coast of Lar, Persian Gulf, close to the east end of Bu Shu’aib. It is sandy and has no trees. Between this island and Bu Shu’aib is a channel less than a mile broad, which is not less than 3 fathoms, and between it and the mainland there is a channel, 5 miles broad, with rocky bottom and irregular sound- ings, which is dangerous. The channel between Bu Shu’aib and Shitvar is not considered safe, unless to persons acquainted with it, as the reef does not always show, and the soundings have little or no change until you are upon it. Shitvar is politically dependent on Maqam, but it is unin habited and visited only by the inhabitants of Bu Shu’aib for fishing, and for pearling on some banks which adjoin it.— {Taylor — Bruchs — * Persian Gulf Pilot, 1906, — Lorimer, 1906.) SHIYIRAVAN (River)— SHIYAKHIN— A section of the Ka’b tribe {q. v.). SHI YU— Lat. 27° 4' 22' N. Long. 52° 8' 50' E.. One of the Shibkuh ports of the Persian coast; it is situated about 39 miles east-south-east of Naband and 773 miles west-north-west of Oharak. Half a mile south-east of the village is a peaked hill about 250 feet high, and a hill about 120 feet in height, behind the village, carries a tower; there is also a fort in the place itself. A large, flat, black rock, projecting into the sea in front of the village, forms a small boat-harbour and is the best landing-place. The anchorage at Shiyu is said to be tolerably well sheltered, close in, from the shamdl; but there must be a considerable swell. A moderate amount of good water is contained in wells close to the beach. Shiyu consists of about 150 stone houses and huts, partly of Arabs and partly of Persians from Lar, etc., the people are mostly Sunnis and are engaged in trade, navigation and pearl-diving, but have also cultivation and date gardens.SHT-SHtT m 4 s . ^ ' » _ * Shiyu is the port of the Gabandi district, and carries on a considerable trade with the ports of the Persian Gulf generally, and also with ’Oman. Here are owned 15 trading-vessels, 9 sailing-boats used for pearl-fishing on the west side of the Gulf, and 24 small baqarehs which are used for fishing and pearling upon the coast under the Gabandi Shaikh. Shiyu is subject to the Gabandi Shaikh, and the annual revenue of the place, amounting to 70,000 Jcrdns, which till lately was payable to the Khans of Lar, is now payable to the Governor of Bastak * not half the nominal revenue of the _ place, however, is realized, and coercive measures are avoided on account of the expense they would entail. Shiyu has recently received a considerable accession to its population through immigration from Kangan and Tahiri. The immigrants were sympathisers with Sulaiman, the Nasuri Shaikh of Tahiri, whom the Khan of Dashti expelled by force of arms in 1904 A. D., in consequence of a quarrel fomented, it is said, by the Salar-i-Mu’azzam during his Governorship of the Gulf ports.— (Lorimer, 1906.) ) SHU’AIBlYEH— Lat. Long. Elev. A village on the east shore of ’Abbadan island. It contains 20 mud huts, and is inhabited by Dris.— [Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) SHUHAN— Lat. Long. Elev. A small village in northen ’Arabistan, about 8 miles south-west of Dizffil and to the west of the Diz river. It contains some 45 mud huts besides a small fort, and is inhabited by Dizful cultivators. The water-supply is from the Karkheh river.— [Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) SHUHUR— Lat. Long. Elev. An Arab village, a short distance from Dizfui, on the way thence to Shush and Daniel’s tomb. Surrounding country entirely grown with rice. * Wells speaks of the Shavur stream on which the village is situated. Though only 10 yards wide, it is not fordable for 16 miles below this except at a place named Amat-uz-Zaman.— [Baring — Wells.) SHURRAB^-Lat. Long. Elev. 1,020'. A camping-ground in the Western Bakhtiari country, usually made the 1st stage from Shushtar (32 miles) on that branch of the Bakhtiari caravan route. The spot may be recognised as being to the left of the road just after a steep ascent from a small amphitheatre, through which flows the Shur-i-Labahri. Below the camping-ground to the north is a small stream, the water of which is just drinkable, though with a taste of naphtha. No habitations beyond lliat encampments in the neighbourhood, which should be avoided.— [Arbuthnot, 1905.) SHUL (1)— Lat. 29°-59'N. Long. 52° 8'E. Elev. 6,730'. A village in Ears, of some 37 miles north-north-west of Shiraz on the road to Behbehan. It contains 10 large stone houses and two towers, and has two good springs of water. A road guard belonging to the Governor of Shiraz is said to be stationed here. Supplies are said to be procurable, and there are vineyards in the vicinity .r— [Felly — Jones — Hopkins, 1903.) _8irCL (2 )—Lat. 29° 55' N. Long. 52° 15' E. Elev.

SHUL (3)— Lat. 30° N. Long. 51° 37' E. Elev. The river Shul is said to come down the Tang-i-Khast from the Tangi-i- Rudian, where it is called the Ab-i-Rudlan ; the stream is artificial, having been cut for the benefit of the rice-fields ; the main river, running to Nurabad and thence to Kazarun, being in fact no other than the Shahpur, marked on the map as running into the sea north of Bushire. The trade to Shiraz from Pul-i-Murd to Tang-i-Rudian and Shiraz goes for some distance along the bank of the Shul.— {Baring — Wells.) SHUL (4)—Lat. Long. Elev.

Wheat and barley are cultivated, and about 500 Hashim mans of gum, collected in the hills, are exported annually. Ancient foundations are traceable here.— {Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) SHtL (8)—Lat. Long. Elev. A large village in the Liravi district of Ears, 6 to 7 miles north-north-west of Behman Yari. A sheet of water, said to be fresh, is visible about 4 miles south-west of the village. Inhabitants call themselves Lurs. Good water from a well.— {Bailward, 1905.) SHULGISTAN— Lat. 31° 23' 5'N.; Long. 52° 8'E.; Elev. 6,600'. .— {St. John.) A village in the province of Ears, 207 miles from Shiraz, on the post road to Isfahan, from which it is distant 119 miles: the 9th caravan, and 10th864 SHU—SHU post stage from Shiraz. It is a compact village, surrounded by stone walls with towers, and massive gates. It possesses a spacious caravanserai and chd'pdrkhdneh, outside these walls. Supplies limited, but sheep in good numbers, probably 1,000 ; water from qandts good, but polluted near the village. Population 60,000. Houses 60.—(Ussher—Ouseley— Morier—Taylor —Clerk—Arbuthnot, 1905 — Wilson, 1907.) SHULISTAN— Lat. Long. Elev. A district of Ears towards Khuzistan.— {Durand.) SHULISTAN (River) or AB-I-SHUR— The more southerly of the two parent streams forming the Hindian river {q.v.) in the plain of Zaidan. It is said to have its origin in a mass of hills to the west of the Kazarun-Shiraz road in the Mamassani country. It has several tributaries the principal one being the Shish Pir, which comes from the north of Shiraz. The waters of this stream are exceed- ! in g!y bitter, strongly impregnating the Shulistan and even tainting the Hindian.— {Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) SHUL PASAGUN-Lat. Long. Elev. A village of 40 houses in the Mazara’i district of' Ears, 6 miles west of Mazara i village. Wheat and barley are grown, and there are 100 donkeys, 50 cattle, and 600 sheep and goats.— [Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) SHUMBEH— Lat. 28° 23' N. Long. 51° 49' E. Elev. 410'. ' A village in the Dashti district of Ears, 33 miles south-east of Khurmuj, and the sixth stage from Bushire on the road thence to Bandar ’Abbas. Shumbeh consists of about 200 mat huts and a large stone and mortar building, the residence of the Khan. On the low range of hills, about half- a-mile, to the east of the village are rivulets of good water, and also three water-mills, two of which are in working order, and the ruins of a town and ancient forts. Between this low range and the village a broad, shallow water-course, called Daria-i-Marsain, with a bed of about 120 to 150 yards broad and dry in April, flows to south by west into the river Mund. Bet ween this water-course and the hills to the east lie large plantations of date- trees. The inhabitants number about 500, including 100 men fit for ser vice, and cultivate wheat, barley and dates. The supplies obtainable are in proportion to the population of the village ; there is good grazing, and the brushwood bordering the Mund river affords a plentiful supply of fuel. There is a good camping-ground here. A road, by native information, branches off from here to Pas-i-Rudak, running through the hills but not presenting any great difficulty. The general direction is east by south. —{Pelly—Ross—Butcher, 1888.) SHUMEHABAD— ^ One of a group of four villages in Kirman, 9 miles west of Bahrain' a bad, on the road to Shiraz. — {Preece, 1892.) SHUR (River) (1) — A river in Laristan, which is crossed by the road from Bandar Abbas ° ar, | miles from the former place. Its bed, which at this point is of consi era e width, is composed partly of a limy, yellowish clay covered5 R with an effloresence of salt, and partly of firm sand, the former predomi nating on the right bank, the latter on the left. At the crossing the water, which is salt, is some 60 yards in breadth and about 3 feet in depth. The river empties itself into the Clarence Straits which lie between the island of Qishm and the mainland, and from a few miles north of Latidan down to its mouth it flows nearly due south. Above this point its course is not known with any certainty. The survey map shows it as rising to the east of Lar and following a semi-circular course through un explored country down to Latidan, while according to Curzon’s . map it rises near Furg and, after flowing east-south-east for some 45 miles, turns nearly due south, which direction it maintains until it reaches the sea. Opposite to Latidan the river is spanned by two bridges, said to have been built by Haji Khulassia, an Isfahan Khan, some 150 or 200 years ago. One of these was described by Butcher at the time of his visit in 1888 as a substantial stone erection with 33 piers and semi-circular arches, but both are now (1905) in bad repair and useless. Half a mile higher up the river is cxosstdibyzioidi.—[Butcher, 1888—Curzon—Shakesyear, 1905.) SHUR (River) (2)— A salt water stream in Laristan, which flows south-east, and is crossed by the road from Furg to Lingeh, 6|- miles south of the former town. Its bed is gravelly and full of boulders, and, where crossed by the road, the stream is about 30 miles wide with a depth of 3 feet in the centre and a rapid current. Half a mile above this point it is joined by the Furg stream, which comes down from the north, past the town of the same name . The waters of the latter stream are fresh and full of fish, and it is easily fordable anywhere.—(FawgrThm, January 1888.) N OTE This and Shur (River) (1) are meant to be descriptive of the same stream. SHURAB {l)—Vide LABEHRl (SHUR-I-). SHURAB (2)— A small brackish stream in Luristan. It flows through the country of the Judald division of the Bala Girieh tribe from east to west, and through a defile of the same name which has an elevation of 5,550 feet. — {Schindler — Rabino, 1905.) SHURAB (3)— A village at the western extremity of the Chehar Mahal district, and immediately north of the Zardeh Kuh range.—(Stack.) SHURAB or AB-I-SHUR (4:)—Vide LABEHRl (SHUR-I-). SHURAB (5)— Elev. 7,750'. A valley in the north-v/estern Bakhtiari country, through which runs one of the sources of the Zindeh Rud. A salt spring is also found in the centre of the valley. (Sawyer, 1890.) SHURISH AB—Lat. Lokg. Elev. A river frequently forded on the road from Malamlr to Khuzistan to Baitavand, about 15 miles south-east of Shushtar.—(DeRode.)866 SHU—SHU SHtRISHJAN, SHIRISHGAN, etc.— A village in the Chehar Mahal district, on the slopes in the Kfih-i-Chal Shutur and the head-waters of the Ab-i-Behishtabad.—(ScMmfter.) SHUR, RUDKHANEH-I— A river of Kirman, in the plain of Jarufti, flowing from north-west to S ° Whe^ crossed at Latidan it was some 2 feet 6 inches deep and 80 feet broad, flowing slowly towards the sea. Its course as shown on the map appears to be incorrect. No gap through which it could pierce Kuh-i- Nimak was visible from Latidan, and it is probable that it pierces the hills by a tang between Kuh-i-Nimak and Kuh-i-Ginau. ‘ The river is impassable during the rainy season, and requires bridg ing for artillery. The ford is uncertain and treacherous, with a soft and shifting bottom.—( Wilson and Cruickshank, 1907.) SHURU—Lat. Long. Elev. A hamlet on the south-east border of Yazd and west of Kuh Banan in that district. It is a few miles south-east of Deh ’AH and struggles to maintain itself on the edge of a white patch of Kavlr. — (Stack.) SHUSH— Lat. 32° 15' N. Long. 48° 19' E. Elev. 600'. The site and ruins of the ancient Susa, in Northern ’Arabistan, situated on the left bank of the Shavur stream, 15 miles south-west of Dizful. The original city covered the whole between the Shavur and Karkheh rivers, some 1| miles, and extended even beyond the latter. The mounds on the left bank of the Shavur cover a space of over 6 miles in circumference and are in three concentric tiers. The uppermost tier or citadel, still known as the Kaleh Shush, is 120 feet high with a perimeter of 1,100 yards at the base and 850 yards at the summit. The second tier, representing the old palace, is some 70 feet high with a perimeter of some 2| miles. The French Government have obtained a concession from the Shah for the ex cavation of antiquities throughout his dominions ; and a party under M. de Morgan have been occupied in this work here since 1898. They have built themselves a spacious kaleh in which they live for some seven months of the year : while the treasures which they have unearthed, and which in part are of extreme value, are despatched to the Louvre to enrich the incom parable treasures already collected in it. Close to the river’s edge is the reputed tomb of Daniel the custody of which is in the hands of a Saiyid. The shrine itself is admittedly empty, the legend running that the coffin, which was of glass and contained the body as well as the records of the pro phet, is buried beneath the waters of the river which were diverted for the purpose and then brought back into its present and original course. The shrine is the resort not only 0 f Jewish, but of Mussalman, pilgrims from Shushtar and Dizful, who alike hold it in great veneration.— (Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905- — Arhuthnot, 1905.) SHUSHTAR (City)—Lat. 23° 3' 0'. N. Long. 48° 53' 0' E. Elev. 400 /: . General description. The official capital of Northern ’Arabistan is situated at the northern extremity of the Mianab in the angle formed by thedivision of the Karun into its branches of the Shatait and Gargar. The city stands on somewhat elevated ground, in part the ordinary alluvia soil of the country, and in part the ruins and rubbish heaps of ages : though overhanging the Shatait, where its course bends due south, the ground runs up to a sandstone cliff 100 feet high, on which stands the citadel. Except at this point, the left bank of the Shatait near the town is low and usually has a long, shelving beach of shingle. The Gargar, on the other hand, runs between steep banks some 20 to 30 feet above the water’s level. Besides the engineering works on these two branches of the Kaiun— vide articles on each in this Gazetteer—mention must be made of the Minau canal which traverses part of the town and waters a considerable portion of the Mlanab. This channel leaves the Shatait by a tunnel through the citadel rock, and, running for some distance underground, emerges near the head of the Pul-i-Qaisiri, or Pul-i-Dizful : thence it passes through a deep cutting to the south of the town and under the Pul-i-Lashkar into the open countrv. The discharge of this canal, measured in March when running 5 feet below its maximum level, was 970 cubic feet per second. Its width was 60 feet, depth 6 feet, and surface velocity 5 feet per second. There were formerly three exits from the town. The first to the west over the Pul-i-Dizful is interrupted owing to the bridge being broken down in the middle, and its place has been taken by a ferry : the second is by the Pul-i-Lashkar into the Mianab : the third over the dam by the Pul-i- Bulaiti to the east and connecting with a village of the same name, which is virtually a suburb of the city. The houses of Shushtar, though of some height and architectural pre tensions, are mostly old and in bad repair, while some parts of the town are in ruins and deserted. The majority of the houses are provided with subterranean chambers, lighted by vertical shafts, called shavvadans or sarddbs, which run down to a depth of some 60 feet and are designed to mitigate the heat of summer (reaching to 120° Fahr. on occasions) and with flat, parapetted roofs about 30 feet from the ground. _ The sanitary condition of the town, chiefly due to the public streets being made the re ceptacle of domestic sewage, is indescribably foul : but as the ground has a natural fall matters are improved by rain, instead of becoming aggra vated as at Dizful. The daily bazar is carried on on a narrow, open space, on which sheds or lean-tos against ruined walls have been erected. The permanent shops are mostly located in the street leading through the centre of the town on to the Pul-i-Bulaitl. The chief architectural features of the town are a large Jama’ mosque standing on an eminence near its southern end a lofty, leaning minaret, about 20 other mosques, some with blue tiled domes, and some 15 imdmzddehs and kadamgdhs. A camping- ground of some 6 acres is available, when not under cultivation, on the south side of the arsenal. For any larger ground it would be necessary to go across the river Shatait on to its right bank. Inhabitants .—The present population of Shushtar is about 20,000 souls, but the place seems to be declining. The- great bulk of the inhabitants are of an indigenous type, commonly supposed to be Assyrian, but of mixed breed : and they are generally called Shushtarls. They speak a Persian 5 ft 2868 SHU—SHU patois resembling, but distinguishable from, that of the Dizfulis. They are Shi’ah Muhammadans : their most prominent sections being the Saiyids, the Khawanin, and the Mashaikh, numbering respectively, 1,000, 500 and 500 persons. The town itself contains no Arabs and but a few Bakhtiari. The opinions expressed by travellers on the Shushtaris temperament, disposition and morals are various and very conflicting. Bayard’s was that they were bigots in religion, while he describes their women as noted more for their beauty than their morals. Other travel lers have described them as tolerant and on the whole moral. A latter day opinion on them • is that, in comparison to the more northern Persians of Isfahan and Tehran, they are more narrow-minded and less adapted to European manners and intercourse generally. In this respect they have exhibited on several occasions acts of fanaticism towards Europeans from which the latter have been free in other localities. The town is divided into four chief mahallehs, each under the direction of a Rais. These mahallehs are constantly fighting with each other, and with the no uncommon result of the city becoming as it were in a stage of siege, the shops all being shut, and no intercourse possible between the rival factions for weeks at a time. Trade and Industries. —A number of local industries are carried on in Shushtar. Among manufactured articles are coarse woollen carpets called gilims or hardmis : woollen cloths for ’ahds (cloaks): light cotton stuffs for clothing ; turbans and waist-cloths ; coarse canvas : givehs (cotton shoes) : coats, hats and rugs of felt: iron, copper, brass utensils, and Ger man silverware : silverwork : glazed earthernware (kashi) : pack and riding saddles and mule gear. Other occupations are brick and lime making, manufacture of opium, tanning of leather and dyeing of cloth. Such of the inhabitants as are not engaged in these manufactures and other occupations live for the most part by wholesale or retail trade, by agri- ture or by religion ; the residence are builders, carpenters, muleteers and raftsmen. Shushtar is the river port of Dizful, through which all its im ports and exports pass : all Dizful merchants therefore have agents or cor respondence at Shushtar. The principal merchants in either place are Messrs. Lynch Brothers, whose representative here was formerly an Eng lishman, but latterly, and in 1905, an Armenian. Trade methods are similar to those at Dizful. The Shushtar munis equal to 15-487 lbs. avoir dupois. Water and other supplies.—The water-supply is naturally unlimited. Supplies, except fuel which comes from ’Aqili and the jungles on the Diz, are drawn chiefly from the Mianab. Food-stuffs and forage cannot be called abundant, but in good years there are considerable stocks of both in the town. There are ii'0 flour-mills in working order on the Gargar, but there is only sufficient water to run 10 of them in the dry season. About 800 mules are said to be owned by Shushtaris, the greater number of which are always absent, grazing or on caravan. In this respect Major G. H. Arbuthnot in his report (1905) on the mule-producing district^ of Persia—II—Shushtar and Dizful {vide also this Gazetteer—Northern ’Arabistan) writes :— “ There is no market for mules in the town of Shushtar itself, neither can it be said to be a ‘ district ’ from which such a supply is obtainable. There are a limited number of mules in use for agricultural and such pur poses, while an equally limited number, locally owned, are engaged in the carrying trade with Dizful and Isfahan.” Administration .—Shushtar, though inferior to Dizful in size and prosperity, is the head-quarters of the Persian Administration in Northern ’Arabistan. This distinction it no doubt owes to its strategic importance with regard both to its situation geographically and its accessibility from the Karun river [vide this Gazetteer—Gargar (Ab-i-)]. The citadel or kaleh, formerly known as the Kaieh-i-Salasal, but now generally styled simply Kaleh-i-Hukumatl, is situated on the rocky bluff where the Shatait branches off and contains the palace of the Governor-General; while on the lower ground to its west stands the arsenal, with a considerable open space between it and the town. The kaleh, which is constructed in several tiers, might well have withstood a siege in former days, but is now commanded at short range by part of the town, and at longer ranges from the hills on the west bank of the Shatait. A small garrison is in evidence when the Governor-General is in residence ; but is withdrawn to Dizful or elsewhere when he leaves the place. There are at Shushtar a Persian Post office, telegraph olfice and customs house. The revenue levied is a part of that levied on the district though col lected separately. This, assessed in lump sums upon the different trade guilds, is collected by the head of each guild, and paid by him to the Mustaufi. The following are some of the principal heads under which reve nue is collected :— Baqqdls, or general dealers Bazzdzes, or cloth merchants ’Attars, or grocers and druggists Hardmbdfs, or carpet-weavers Coppersmiths „. Millers Per annum. Tumdns. 300 200 120 150 140 .. from 600 to 800 The ferry on the Rhatait (a monopoly held by the Governor-General)— 600 tumdns per annum. The revenue of the flour mills is collected by a curious double method. The mill-owner first takes for himself one cTieJidrak for every man ground, and the Government farrash at the same time takes 2 siah piil in cash from the owner of the flour for every man ; afterwards the money received from the persons patronising a particular mill having been totalled at the end of every week, the owner of the mill is required to deliver to Government one man of flour for every krdn which has been collected by the Government of his customers. The administration of public charity and of education is in the hands of Mujtahids, who, before the advent of the present strong Governor in 1905,870 SHU-SHU \ virtually ruled the town as regards internal matters, though the more im portant of the Khawanin had a voice in public matters. The chief Mujta- hid of Shushtar (in 1905) is Haji Saiyid Abdul Samad, who is a large l_and- owner and professes friendship for the British. Of bis two sons, Haji Agha Muhammad Ja’afar and Haji Ahmad, the former is middle aged and has a considerable part in the management of his father’s affairs, and, though he does not seek intercourse with Europeans, is civil to those whom he meets. The second Mujtahid family in importance is that of which Shaikh Muham mad ’Ali was the head until his death in 1904 : and of the three sons surviv ing him the most influential is Muhammad Javad. There is an Imam Jumeh at Shushtar as at Dizful. Shushtar is not now a natural political centre, and if the Persian Governor and Mujtahids were to be withdrawn it would probably fall into obscurity. Climate — Communications .— Vide this Gazetteer— ’Arabistan (Northern), Shatait (Ab-i-) and Gargar (Ab-i-).— (Layard and Selby, 1847 — Raivlinson — Baring—Wells — Arbuthnot, 1905—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) SHUSHTAR (District)— One of the two districts into which Northern ’Arabistan {vide this Gazet teer) is divided ; the other being Dizful. The boundary between the two is a line passing between Pavindeh and Kahunak in the north through a point east of Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah in the south. Produce and trade. —The winter crops are wheat, barley, poppies, and vegetables : while the summer crops are rice, linseed, gram, millet, maize, cotton and other vegetables, including melons, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Other products are wool, ghi, sheep-skins, hides, and reeds (for pens). Petroleum or nayhiha is found at Darreh-i-Nafth, about 20 miles south-east of Shushtar city, and bitumen on the Ab-i-Diz. Shushtar was considered by Sir H. Rawlinson to be one of the best supplied districts in Asia, and, admitting this to be a somewhat exaggerated estimate it may still be said of it that it compares favourably with the best. Thus the rice or barley after the harvest runs at about kran 1 per Shushtar maund or roughly about 60 lbs. for the rupee. A sheep weighing 30 lbs. is obtainable from Rs. 2-8 to Rs. 3. The plains about Shushtar become covered with grass from early February increasing until May, after which it disappears as rapidly as it has sprung up, and the whole country once more becomes a parched and barren desert. Opium is largely grown and its cultivation is yearly in creasing and superseding, in value at least, that of cereals. The production of, and trade in, the latter, e.g., barley and wheat, is much interfered with by the senseless imposition of an embargo placed upon its exportation at the will of the Governor-General, which is said to be exercised entirely, or usually, to his personal gain or advantage. As a general statement it may be said that all attempts in trading on any large scale are checked by the chilling influence of Persian rule. With proper encouragement the listrict, might hold its own commercially and agriculturally with less avoured centres now far ahead of it in prosperity. N. B —The value of the tumdn (krdns 10) fluctuates between Rs. 2 8 and Rs. 3.SHU—SHU 871 Imports .—Shushtar city is the sole trade-centre.

Finally rifles, gunpowder and lead. Bakhtiari Same as above, substituting felt kulihs (hats) for chafiyehs and larger supply of barley and wheat. Dizful • Dates, pottery and petroleum. The revenue of the Shushtar district is assessed at 20,000 tumdns a year (between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 60,000), but rather less than half can be counted on being collected.

Cliffs | mile apart rise above the pass to the height of 1,500 feet, the base sloping down to the bed of the pass which is 50 yards wide, and traversed by a dry, bouldery ndld. One and a half miles after entering the pass from the Tarkhan plain, a large rock pool forms the source of an abundant stream of clear water, which now flows through the pass, and thence through a gorge to the Saimarreh river.— {Burton, Sep tember 1897.)

There is also a creek called Khur Sill] or Sila'ch, which opens into the Persian Gulf be tween the Khur Musi, and the mouth of the “ Bahmanshir ” ; it is said to carry water from the Karan, but its con ection with the “ Bahmanshir,” of which it may be a branch, has not been investigated {1905). — {Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) SILAIK (Upper)—Lat. 30° 24' N. Long. 48° 15' E. Elev. A village opposite Shanneh andShinaineh on ’Abbadan island, situated on the left bank of the Bahmanshir.

The Isfahan Shushtar road skirts its north-eastern edge as it descends from the Zirreh pass to Na-SIL-SIN 875 ghan. Near the point where the roads from the Ardal, Naghan and the Zirreh pass meet is an empty caravanserai. There are two lakes in the plain, the overflow from which waters the Naghan plain. It lies from north-west to south-east and is 4| miles in length from the pass dividing it from Chigha-Khur to the lower end of the lake. The Silligun lake occupies the centre of the valley. A wall of stones and mortar in bad repair crosses the mouth of the valley thus raising the water level. On either side is corn land. Great numbers of animals are pastured here. Towards the upper end of the valley, corn was still standing in August and reaping and ploughing was going on.— (Sawyer, 1890 — Burton, 1903 — ArhutJinot, 1905 — Lorimer, 1906.)

There are three roads hence to Ardal— (Mackenzie — Schindler — Satvyer, 1890.) SIRGIZ— Lat. Long. Elev. A hamlet in the Bastak district of Laristan, about 41 miles from Bandar ’Abbas and 3 miles south of the road from that place to Lar. It consists of only fou^ huts, a date garden and a few wells.— (Shakes- pear, 1905.) SlRl (Island) — Lat. (south-east point) 25° 56' N. Long. 54° 38' 40'E. An island in the middle of the Persian Gulf, 40 miles south by west of Bustaneh which is the nearest point upon the Persian coast. In shape the island is a truncated wedge, 3| miles in length from east to west, 2f miles broad at the eastern end, and 1 mile at its western extremity ; it is low, sandy, and bare of natural vegetation, with many small detached hills of dark colour, none of which exceed 50 feet in height. The island is sur rounded by a reef extending two-thirds of a mile from shore. On all sides the sea is deep at more than £ mile off shore, and on the east and south east deep water comes close in ; the anchorage are all indifferent; the best is to the southward. There are two permanent villages on the island : Bilad Zara’ieh and Bilad Ghavavis. The former is situated towards the north-east corner of the island, and consists of 12 mud huts tenanted by Abu Dastur Arabs; the Abu Dastur are one of the divisions of the Arabs of the Persian coast, who are known under the general name of Al Paris ; in religion, those of Sir! are Sunnis of the Hambali School. The village possesses a date-grove of about 550 trees, and the inhabitants cultivate a little wheat and barley and some melons and onions for their consumption. Irrigation is from a group of 12 wells called Tui Na’amih, about 6 fathoms deep, which provide a fair supply of good water; but it seems that at some previous time water was more plentiful than it is now, and the cultivation of the village more exten sive. Livestock at Bilad Zara’ieh are 20 donkeys, 12 well bullocks, 12 milch- cows and 400 sheep and goats. There are no boats. Bilad Ghavavis isSm-BIR 677 situated on the south-eastern coast of Sir!, opposite the anchorage marked in the Admiralty chart. It is occupied by forty families of Sudan and 30 of Huwalah all originally from the coast of Trucial ’Oman; they are Hambali Sunnis, and, as the name of the village implies, they subsist chiefly by pearl diving. At this village there are no animals and no cultivation, but the people own 15 sambuqs for pearling on the Arabian banks, and 30 small baqdrehs which are used for pearl-diving and fishing round the island. Their drinking water is from a single well called Bfl Sfir, about 600 yards north-west of the village, which yields ar abundant supply, but it is inferior in quality to the water of Tui Na’amieh. There has been a Persian flagstaff on Siri since 1887, and since 1899 it has been located at Bilad Ghavavis. In 1904 two Tufangchis of the Imperial Persian Customs were stationed at Bilad Ghavavis, where they are now in charge of the Persian flag and collect duty on all import reaching the island not covered by exemption passes from Lingeh. From 1887 until recently, tithes used to be collected on Siri after each t harvest by an emissary of the Deputy Governor of Lingeh, and the island is apparently regarded by the Persian Government as belonging to their Lingeh district; but the title of Persia to Siri is not admitted by the British Government, and the Shaikh of Sharjeh has certain hereditary claims to the island.— (Bruchs—Lorimer 1906). SlRIMEH— Lat. Long. Elev. Name of a small cluster of round (i.e., not palm) trees on the low shore about 9 miles north-west by north from Ras Bahrakun, coast of Khuzistan, serving as a mask for the entrance of the Tab river, which lies between these trees and the point; the entrance, which is very shallow, has not been surveyed on a large scale ; the boats navigating the river are only of 20 or 30 tons.— (Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot.) SIR-I-YAFAL— Lat. 27° 33' 37' N. Long. 52° 37' 40' E. Elev. 4,870'. A well-known landmark on the coast of Lar, consisting of a mountain 4,870 feet high, with a great step or fall on the summit except from tho westward, where it appears like a sharp notch ; it is visible over 70 miles seawards. It is distant 5 miles from the coast above ’Asalu, and bears north by east from Ras Naband. It is called ’Asalil Notch by English sailors.— (Constable — Stifle—Persian Gulf Pilot.) SIRlZ— vide SARlZ. SIR JAN— * A district in the Kirman province, situated about 100 miles south-west of the city of that name. It is about 80 miles long from north to south and 70 miles wide from east to west, and consists of a most fertile plain containing some 60 prosperous permanent villages. (The officials give the number of villages in the buluk as 350, but this number includes every small group of tents.) Sa’dabad (formerly called Sir jam) is the principal village of the district, and was at one time the chief town of the province, until Ibn Ilias, finding it too close to the frontier of Fars for convenience and security, moved the capital to Kirman. The famous Kaleh-i-Sang, also reputed an ancient capital, is situated in the district. Sirjan contains 1,830878 SIR-SIR families of nomads (for list of whom see Kirman) The district lies on the most westerly of the four main caravan routes which radiate from Bandar ’Abbas to the interior. This route, which is, generally, speaking a winter route bifurcates within the limits of the district, the main branch running to Yazd, and striking the Kirman-Yazd road to the west of Rafsinjan, while a less important track turns to Kirman. The district has a Customs post in charge of the Postmaster, to prevent gun-running. The revenue was 33,000 tumdns in 1903. Newcomen gives the following details of the produce, trade, etc., of Sir j an in 1905 :— Cotton. —Sirjan district produces some 2,000 maunds (Indian) a year. All Produce and export. consumed locally, either in the manufac ture of a coarse, thin cloth of which about 100,000 zar are used a year, or for the wool for carpets. There are no pros pects of increasing the cultivation of cotton, as the water-supply is limited and food-crops have to be raised. The staple, too, is short—too short, probably, for use in Indian mills. Wool. The entire produce of the district, which is very small, is used in the manufacture of carpets, and there is none available for export. Leather. There is no trade in this commodity, nor in hides. What few hides are available are tanned locally and used by the Khans. The tan ning is done with the bark of the wild almond and the leaves of the wild pistachio tree. The leather produced is of a very pale almond colour, and inferior in quality. It seems to meet the local requirements however. The shoes worn here are made, both uppers and soles, of cotton. Fabrics, cotton. Cotton materials are in universal use. The dye most in use is indigo, of a poor quality. Fabrics, woollen. Hardly any woollen clothes are worn. The blankets, such as they are, are locally woven out of camel’s hair. Sugar. There is a very considerable demand for import trade in this, especially Marseilles loaf and crystal sugar from Mauritius and Russia. his latter, however, is in great disrepute, as its sweetening properties are small compared with other sugars. If India could supply a suitable ar ic e at a low price, a good trade might be done by bartering sugar for almonds, pistachios, gum, and carpets. Yea. Indian tea seems hardly to be known. Some 6,000 lbs. per annum of tea are used, entirely Java. The imports of the district mostly come frrm Bombay via Bandar Imports.

In 1904 friction occurred between the Khan and Sulaiman, the local Nasurl Shaikh ; the result was the flight of the Shaikh, and the emigration of many of the inhabitants and their families, to Shiyu and Chiru. There is here a post of the Persian Imperial Customs. The hills inland of Tahiri, at a d'’stance of from 3 to 6 miles from the place, are said to be occupied by a Baluchi tribe, who possess a quantity of livestock, chiefly sheep and goats, also a few date-palms; they cultivate wheat, barley and maize. The only claim of Tahiri to distinction is the possession of prehistoric remains and early Muhammadan ruins. The sides of the ravines which come down from the hills to the north-west of the ^ binge are pierced with numerous chambers, most of which are inaccessible, except by ladders ; and in one place the hillside over a space of half a mile square has been worked into tiers of remarkable troughs. This portion is inter sected by a ravine, to which a flight of broad shallow steps, cut .in the rough conglomerate rock, descends on either side. Here and there pillars of nature rock have been left standing, and the largest of these has been hollowed out to form a chamber. There are many wells in the hillside, one of which is 204 feet deep and contains 36 feet of good water ; some of these wells are circular, some oblong, and the diameter is usually 2 or 3 feet; those furthest up the hill are the deepest. These remains are apparently pre- Islamic ; the chambers appear to have been sepulchral, and some of them in 1857 still contained crumbling human bones. On the coast plain immediately west of Tahiri are the ruins of an early Muhammadan town, perhaps Siraf, extending for a mile or more along the coast, and for some distance up the slope of the foothills. These are now mere heaps of rough masonry, but foundations of houses, wells and the remains of water-cisterns of the pattern still common on this coast—oblong excavations lined with gypsum-cement and vaulted over—are still traceable. The whole extent of the ruins is strewn with broken pottery including many fragments of Chinese porcelain. The only building in a state of moderate preservation is a mosque of well-cut stone and elegant design •with pointed doors and windows. One traveller believes it to have been originally a Christian building, subsequently adapted to Muhammadan uses ; some of the decorative carving appears from his account to have been of a floral character. There are many ornamental monolithic tomb stones bearing cufic inscriptions : one of these, now in the British Museum, bears a date equivalent to 991 A.

The flanking spurs are about 1,000 feet above the road and fully command the entrances and approaches.— (Sawyer, 1890.) TANG-I-GHAZI— Lat. Long. Elev. 7,100'. A gorge between the Kuh-i-Khisti and Kuh-i-Chuhl through which the Zindeh Rud forces its way northwards, not far from its sources. The vil lage of Sudaigan lies on the north side of the Tang on the river Duna; a fine grassy plateau lies on the south side. There is good pasture in the valley, and, where growing, the cereals are good.— (Bell, 1884.) TANG-I-GIACH (? GACH)— Lat. Long. Elev.

A name of a pass in Luristan on the road from Kirmanshali to Kutml-’Ama- rah from which latter place it is distant 73 miles. It is about 5 miles in length, and its southern exit is about 5 | miles north of the Perso-Turkish Frontier. The Gunjancham river flows down it and is crossed several times. At about i mile from the south entrance to the pass the road descends and crosses the river, on the further (right) bank of which is Kaleh Sangar, an enclosure surrounded by a wall of large stones built to defend the pass , about 1 mile further up where the pass narrows is Hasaniyeh, the winter residence of the Vail of Pusht-i-Kuh, consisting of two small forts. The road then continues up. the river-bed for about If miles, and finally leaves it. The hills on either side of it are of no great height, being nowhere above six or seven hundred feet above the river-bed, and usually considerably lower : they are accessible to infantry in many places and also to mountain guns. The road up the pass varies according to the season of the year and the height of the river, the routes being m places as much as 500 yards apart. Elevation at Hasaniyeh 1,000 feet.— {B.)&gt; TANG-I-HAZAR-YAK (TANG HAZAR CIR)— Lat. Long. Elev.

A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from Kirmanshah city to Baghdad via Mandali. Its elevation is about 5,300 feet. A small stream flows through it from the valley to its north, to the Guar valley south of it. It is about 200 yards in width at the narrowest point to the north, where there are traces of an ancient wall. The ground descends gently through it in a southerly direction for f of a mile, shortly before which the width of the defile reaches 400 yards ; the pass then terminates in the Guar valley. The hills on both sides are well-wooded, that on the west being the highest, and its topmost peak the most difficult of access. It is possibly turnable from the west within 2 or 3 miles. It is passable to field guns.—( Vaughan.) TANG-I-KA’B— Lat. Long. Elev.

A break in Luristan in the Kheolah (Glalan) range of hills, which is pierced by the Lailum stream, 70 miles from Dizful on the road to Khurramabad Ibis stream is an affluent of the Ab-i-Saimarreh, which, traversing the valley between the Kuh-i-Kabir and Kheolah hills, falls into the Karkheh The hills forming the Saimarreh valley, the Kabir and Kheolah ranges, are here 2 miles apart; the former, in one long incline sloping upwards to the south, are much cut up by ravines and marked by striee ; the latter rise in almost perpendicular slopes ; the tops of the former are still white with snow in places.This fine gently sloping valley, covering 1,000 yards by 1,000 yards, is surrounded by low undulations, and is easy of defence, except from the north, where the Kheolah range is steep and accessible only with difficulty by means of the steep ledges of rock, formed by denudation; pasture good. The Lailum stream, here shallow and 20 feet broad, flows in a bed of conglomerate 30 feet deep. By a narrow gorge it here forces its way through the Kheolah range ; it is possible to get to the northern side of the range by passing through the gorge. The rocks here are full of nummulites. The river is forded with difficulty after rain. Thermometer, 10th April 1884, 80° at 3 p.m. The passage of the Lailum is difficult owing to large boulders covering its bed.— (Bell.)

Entering the pass from the south, or Bushireside, the road runs up a ravine for about 2 | furlongs, when it crosses a narrow rocky torrent-bed with a stream of water 3 feet deep flowing in a westerly direction. It then passes up a dry torrent-bed between two hills of gravelly limestone, after which the ascent continues over rocky ground and is fairly easy. The descent down the northern side which is called the Gardan-i- Khudu, is rather steep, and in parts rugged and narrow. Precipitous, and frequently perpendicular, rocks rise on either side of the road, which, though practicable enough for infantry or pack transport, would be very difficult, if not impassable, to field artillery.— (Butcher, April 1888.)

Two villages situated on the Zabari plain, Kirmanshah, at the south-west entrance to the pass of Tang-i-Shuvan. The road from Harunabad to Kirmanshah passes between the villages which stand about J mile apart. Below is a small area of walled vineyards fringed with poplars, and some orchards. A fair stream issues from the pass and there are also a number of springs. The plain is cultivated and contains good grazing : many thousands of goats and sheep pasturing on it in summer. The mountain range of Kurkur, which bounds the plain immediately behind Tang-i-Shuvan, contains much oak scrub, the remnants of former forest. The village to the south of the road is the property of the Yakil-ud-Dauleh, Hajl-’Abd- ur-Rahlm of Kirmanshah, and contains 50 houses ; that to the north, of 40 houses, is partly owned by him. The inhabitants are Kalhur Kurds : they own large numbers of sheep and goats and some herds of cattle, also a fair area of cultivated land.— (Burton.) TANG-I-SHUVlN (Pass of)-Lat. Long. Elev. 5,550'. Immediately to the north-east of the villages of Tang-i-Shuvan, an outlying parallel spur of the Kurkur range, which here bounds^ the Zabari plair, is pierced by a narrow gorge ; the road from Harunabad to Kirmanshah passes through it, at 12f miles from the former place. ^ The bed of the pass is 50 yards wide, and through it flows the stream draining the valley to the north-east. The stony hills rise steeply to either hand, to points J mile apart and 500 feet above the stream. The road through the pass is good : the gradient easy and the length traversed 300 yards. In the valley beyond the north-east exit is room for camping; wood, water and good grazing ; a footpath to the Mahi Dasht plain cosses the Kurkur main ridge; to the south-east runs the path, practicable for laden animals, which crosses the same ridge as the Mil path to the Mahi Hasht plain. The Tang-i-Shuvan path cannot be turned in the immediate vicinity, but the Kurkur range is crossed a few miles to the north and south by various passes practicable for laden animals, notably the ’Aliavar, 4 miles south east, which is the road by which the Persian artillery marches to the main road (Kirmanshah-Baghdad) at Harunabad.— (Burton.) ¥ TANG-I-SIAH m—L at.

TANGISTlN District— This district of the Persian coast of Ears is somewhat irregular in shape. Its maximum length from north to south is about 40 miles, and the northern half has a breadth inland of about 20 miles ; but the southern half is merely a narrow strip upon the coast. Limits .—The northern boundary is a line running east and west, a few miles south of the important village of Chah Kutah, so as to divide Tangis- tan from Dashtistan. The western boundary is the Mashileh of Bushire, and, further south, the coast of the Persian Gulf. The perimeter of the dis trict is completed by a line which, commencing at the north-east corner, follows the crest of the main maritime range until it has passed several miles beyond Ahram, and then crosses to the summit of a subsidiary maritime range, much nearer to the sea, along which it continues southward for about 90 miles, finally running down to the coast a little beyond the village of Karri. . .. Physical characteristics.-—The great maritime range where it adjoins ian- gistan is of no great elevation, the highest point being Kuh-i-Dukhtar, 3,938 feet, a few miles to the north-east of the Tangistan capital of Ahram. A spring of extremely hot water is said to issue from the western face of Kuh- i-Dukhtar and to be adjoined by deposits of sulphur. An important fea ture of the district proper is the Ahram stream, which has its exit from the hills on the south side of Kuh-i-Dukhtar, and, leaving the town of Ahram on its right bank, runs north-west and joins the Chah Kutah stream of the Dashtistan district a few miles above the point where the latter empties itself into the swamps near Bushire town. A short way below Ahram town this stream has a channel of 100 yards, the right bank being 20 feet hign, of a tenacious white clay, while the left bank is lower and more shelving, but the breadth of the actual stream is ordinarily about 30 feet, and its depth 1 foot only : it is believed, however, to be liable to sudden floods after rain in the hills. The surface of the Tangistan district would be flat and open throughout, as it is in its northern part, were it not for the accident of a con siderable sandstone range, which, running parallel to the sea at the distance of a mile or two inland, divides the southern portion of the district into an inland valley and a littoral tract. These three features, the inland valley, the coastal range, and the maritime strip, are all prolonged southwards into the Dashti district. The inland valley is cultivated under the hills, and a chain of small villages depending on cultivation extends down each side of it. The coastal range has a length of over 50 miles, and belongs as much 6 Y 2908 TAN—TAN aS A d0 ? S *? ™ ^ most general name appears to be that of Kuh-.-Mund, derived from the Mund river on which its southern xhemity abuts, but it is also called Kuh-i-Kar. The most northern point of Kuhn-Mund, called Ching Kauntar, is only 467 feet high, but at the middle of !ts length behind the coast line village of Bu’l-Khair the range attains a height of 2,682 feet and is here called Bu Raiyal. It is croS oitwo places by passes leading from the coast to the Tangistan and Khur- mu] valley. Where the district is flat the surface is generally an alluvial clay, often covered with good natural grazing, and sometimes cultivated wdh cereals. Travelling is rendered difficult by mud in wet weather. The water of the Ahram stream is almost undrinkable, and the district water-supply depends everywhere upon wells. The climate and seasons of Tangistan resemble those of Dashti. The Tang'stan coast posses ses no remarkable features : off the coast the tidal stream is so weak as to be often imperceptible. ♦ « aa uu lonr^r-m ? 6 P0p ! ll£ ‘: ti ? n o£ Tan gi st5 n may be roughly estimated at 10,000 souls.

The town of Ahram is described as a comparatively recent acquisition of the Khan’s family, so also Khavlz on the Ahram river within the mountains, Abad and Samal in the district of Dashtistan ; these were all formerly in the hands of the Mashaikh-ul- Mazkur, whose power fell into decay some years ago. In Ta,ngistan there is no pretence of government, and even the rudiment ary civil justice, which in other districts is dispensed by the religious author ities, does not exist a deficiency which is attributed 10 the back ward con dition of the people and their intractable character. The Khan, however, by leasing the villages of the district to their head- men, manages to realize a considerable revenue. The incidence of the land- tax is nominally 20 to 60 krdns per harvest on the gdu of cultivation ; on each date-tree an annual impost of 33 cents is levied ; and a poll-tax also is payable by each male adult at the rate of 20 to 40 krdns. The rule'of t le present Khan is considered oppressive and of late there has been much emigration from his territory. The family of the Khan is of Arab, origin, belonging to a tribe called Fulad, but is now completely Persianised. The following is a table of the Khan’s immediate ancestors :— AHMAD SHAH KHAN.

A path leads up the hill-side to the village of Pushkar, perched upon an elevated ledge amidst a few palm trees ; the road leads down the valley, and is difficult and stony, and in parts steep ; in many places huge boulders narrow it to a mere track. It is elevated about 100 feet above the bed of the river. 1 o?f r ° 1 ^ et ? r 2// ^’ 330 feet ^ ’ tem P eratur e 88 ° at 7-15 a.m., on 13th June 1884.

TANG-I-TURKAN— Lat. Long. Elev. A defile in Pars, on the road between Kamarij and Kazarun, 85 miles west- south-west of Shiraz. It commences 5 miles from Kamarij. The ordinary road descends the defile in the bed of a torrent, and for the distance of 3 miles is stony and narrow, and quite impracticable for guns or wheeled car riage. Rocky and precipitous heights command the road throughout rising abruptly on both sides and continuing so till the road debouches into the plain of Kamarij ; but this road seems never to be taken by beasts of burden. There is another road over the mountains of Kuh-i-Mahas, direct to Kazarun, which is said to be practicable for horses though steep in some places. The mountains here are more accessible, and therefore offer less impediment to a force occupying the right and left of the pass ; and the road down the ravine could easily be made practicable for artillery. It was near there that Captain Napier’s caravan was attacked and plundered by Mamassani robbers in 1874.— (Ouseley Monteith ■ Curzon.) TANG-I-VAN— Lat. Long. Elev.

A pass in the north-east corner of Laristan, near the borders of Ears and Kirman, through which runs the main caravan track from Bandar ’Abbas to Yazd, about 86 miles from the former place. It is a much frequented pass, and thus described by Galindo, who traversed it in November 1888, entering it from the north or Sa’adatabad side “At 9f miles (from Sa’adatabad) the track descends into the bed of the stream, which is here very narrow and difficult, among slippery boulders and masses of rock. This is the commencement of the Tang-i-Zagh, The Raven s Defile. ” It is of course utterly impassable for anything on wheels, is difficult and bad even for pack animals, and serious operations would have to be undertaken to make even a decent path of it. __ _ Having passed this narrow portion, the track continues in the river-bed, but encounters no other serious obstacles for some distance. The stream is generally enclosed between perpendicular walls of conglomerate rock, some 200 to 300 feet|high. The general appearance of the scene reminded me somewhat of some of the narrowest portions of the Bolan pass. At 11 miles a narrow rift opens in the bank to right, down which comes a branch water-course, and the track turns up this. The left branch looks tempting, as a bit of open ground is visible beyond, but it leads into utterly impassable difficulties, as I found on exploring it, and had to retrace my912 TAN—TAN zf^r? bra r h - which is - completely blocked by roc^d’b^llt t„ avo^ic^m'XaT t*’' ' Zdifi^bta m et g k b .ra„ V rL“ ^ r ° Ck3 ' ™ ^va„ce“ towering up to a height of 500 or 600 feet above thZZZTbed rZZZT rock - look deep in it, but when if is swollen by h^vTraTn “l h To It '*', 7 u-’ At about 14 miles the actual “ tang ” may be said to be passed The ravine opens out to a width of 70 or 80 vaJs +h a j i r ssca - ^ iie and insignificant ; in fact this is n^ri y tlA“nhe^ ^ are approaching the watershed.

A village in the province of Fars on the post road between Isfahan and Shiraz, 90 miles from the former and 140 miles from the latter place. It is the 10 th caravan and the 11 th post stage from Shiraz. The frontier bet ween Isfahan and Shiraz is about 11 miles north of the village. Yazd-i-Khast stands upon an isolated block of conglomerate 70 feet high and 300 to 400 yards long in a ndld 100 feet deep and 300 yards broad running from south-west to north-east. The village contains about 180 houses (of which 80 are occupied), with a population of about 600. The village has, so to speak, overflowed its limits, and there is now a small hamlet outside, close to the south-west end of the rock, which accounts for an additional 300 inhabitants. The village is connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge, 15 feet long by 6 feet broad, removable at pleasure. This bridge is on the south-west end and leads to a single doorway in the rock. There is one very deep well in the village, but the water is not good. At the base of the cliffs are a number of caves hidden in the rock, which serve as pens for sheep and cattle, and as stables for horses. A swift stream runs down the centre of the ndld south of the village and its water is milky almost to opaqueness. It is crossed by a strong stone bridge with several arches of different sizes in good repair. The stream itself is fordable. On the south bank stands a caravanserai in a dilapi dated condition ; it is said to be the work of Shah ’Abbas. On the north bank, nearly opposite the caravanserai, stands the chd'pdrkhdneh. Wheat and barley are cultivated on either side of the stream for some distance. The village is commanded from the cliffs on either side. The Isfahan- Shiraz road descends into this ravine and leaves it again, but the slopes do not present a serious obstacles to traffic. Water is obtained from the two qandts; 6,500 lbs. of grain are sown yearly; taxes 1,30 tumdns. — (Curzon — Preece — Arbuthnot, 1905 — Wilson, 1907 — Cobban, 1907.) YAZD-I-KHAST (2)—Lat. 29° 32' N.

Baron De Bode, however, says it is a Kurdish tribe, brought here from Kirmanshah by Nadir Shah at the time when he transplanted the Bakhtiari to the Turkoman fron tier. The colony of Zanganeh, originally consisted of 2,000 families, which, from various causes, are now reduced to 400.— (Layard — De Bode.) [N.B .—Possibly there are two tribes of this name. Regarding the Zanganeh of Kirmanshah, Mr. T. C. Plowden says :—“ About 300 families of this tribe occupy por tions of the great Mahi Dasht plain, other families are settled at Til'n Dasht and at Harasa, some 25 miles to the west of Kirmanshah (town). Some 200 families are settled in the plains at the foot of the Parau hills to the north of Kirmanshah and other small detachment at Chehar (?) to the east of Kirmanshah towards Haisin. There are 2,000 families in all. The present (1881) head of the Zanganeh tribe is Muhammad Riza Khan, Zah'r-ul-Mulk, whose grandfather, Mustafa Qull Khan, was once Governor of Kirm~nsh h. Zah r-ul-Mulk appears to be a stupid, good-natured man and is said to be liked by his people over whom he exercises a mild rule. As Sart'p of the Zanganeh and Nanakull tribes, he maintains for the service of the State one regiment of infantry and 150 cavalry. I saw the infantry under canvas outside the walls of Kirmanshah. They had just been mobilised, and were under orders for the frontier. The men were miserably dressed, and could not for a moment compare with the Turkish infantry at Baghdad. They were armed with German muskets. “ The Zanganeh country is ‘ milkiat’ ; it yields nothing to the State, for the land revenue from it is absorbed in paying the expenses of the foot and horse levies under Zahlr-ul-Mulk’s command. Ros i speaks of the L r tribe of Zanganehs localised from Naksh-i-Timur to B d-i-Kata, as approximating 400 families, keeping about 100 mules, but no herds.— (Layard — Ross — Plowden.) 1 ZANGAR, KUH-I— Lat.
