September 24th, 1913 I am directed hy Secretary Sir E.

I am to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that Sir E.

I am Sir Your most obedient humble Servant -he Under Secretary of State India Office.Ill ^V2- From Viceroy, 9th August 1913. Foreign Secret. Turkish negotiations. Please see Cox’s letter No. 2,102, dated 10th July, copy of which has been sent you direct. Paragraph 7. We agree with Cox as to importance of convincing Sheikh that the British Commissioner will be in sympathy with him, and doubtless His Majesty’s Government will bear this point in mind when putting names forward for selection for the appointment. It does hot, however, seem possible to accept Sheikh s stipulation that in questions on which lie and the Commissioner differ action should be postponed pending a reference to the British Government. He will always have the support of our British OHicer in reasonable demands and il will always be open to Sheikh to invite our good offices should such a situation arise, but such action must, it would appear, be taken independently of the Commissioner who is an officer in the employment of the 1 urkish Government. Paragraph 9. Koweit. We consider that it will be best to make no further communication to Sheikh on the subject of the succession nor is it in our opinion desirable, until the Sheikh presses it strongly, to raise question of recognising Sheikh Jabr during his father’s lifetime. We propose to inform Cox accordingly. * As to customs question, Article 8 of Convention, we agree with Cox that the Sheikh should be informed that it is premature to raise question now and that in the event of the railway coming to Koweit he can reply upon us to protect his interests. Paragraph 11. The terms of Convention as regards admission of Turkish agent do not, in our opinion, relieve Sheikh of his obligations to consult us before admitting other foreigners. We propose to instruct Cox to inform Sheikh that in event of Wonckhaus or other foreigners wishing to open agencies in Koweit he should refer to British Government before committing himself.zdo No of 1913 British Residency and Consulate-General Sir In amplification of my telegram No.1223 dated 9th July 1913, I have the honour to forward, for the in formation of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, a copy of the marginally cited communication No.2102 dated 10th July 1913.} which I have addressed to the Government of India, reporting my proceedings at Mohammerah in seeking compliance on the part of the Shaikhs of huwait and Mohammerah with our recommendatione for their acceptance of the terms and results of the Anglo-Turkish Convention, now on the point of completion.

In discuissing thi© problacs he again raised th® question of th® rid-ohanmel lino, arguing that trot*- th® point where th® K&amp;run, a Persian river. Join© th® fhatt-al-Arab, it surely was only fair tliat Persia should share the poesesslon of the river. But a© haji Rale was not present on thi© occasion and we had already been talking for over S hours and the Shaikh wa© get ting tired, we were unable to dispose of th© question of the CovRslsslon at thle sitting and therefore adjourned, leaving the translation with the Mmikh for further study and dlccue- eion with ^aji Rais, and with the intention of finishing with it at th® • haikh 9 0 return visit to me. Kean while, and indeed all along, the latter ©xproeoed hie fira intention, after talking thing a out, to eonply with our final advice in the matter. 5. Defer® parting company I asked him to arrange with hi© gu®at, .shaikh bharak, for m® to vi©it him the following fore noon, and told shaikh Khexal briefly what I had to aay to th© former. **© hi?a»®lf took a oenalbl® view of th© question of th© location of a urkiah A^«tit, recognising itc one convenient aspectasp act, 1.9. as an Indio* tier, of Shaikh ^obarak's autononous 1 P® olti °n&gt; «''' h» proRlsod to snda&amp;vour to Influenoo hie frland j i' the right Olrootlon. &lt;J.

The chalteh feared the | contingency of tho Brltloh OOBsaleeloner, perfeape a stranger to hiKoolf, being over-influenoed by his Turkish role end perhaps led to act against Uohacrerah interests arbitrarily j without oonsuiting its Ruler, we endeavoured to persuade him that hie apprehensions on this point wore premature and that the British Commissioner would surely receive all such pre liminary instructions from the British hovemr ent as might be necessary to ensure Loharraomh interests being really pro tected. Eventually we arranged In concert the draft of a appeal to the Hague, had been a necessary step in order to This point having been finally disposed of, tho Oonmlesloner was then gone Into. We found that the right of t S' &lt;r letter(37 letter of acceptance for the :3ml)ch to send n«, and thin he Snoloaure 1. | did In due eourao. I attach a tranelatlon thereof and trust that the shaikh's acooiapanylng stipulation will not he considered inconvenient or unroaednahle* After settling the terms of this draft we adjourned to other mattore of business. 1 need not dilate upon the extrecse Importance of letting the Shaikh feel that the Drillah Oomnlseioner will really be In sympathy with him and aee that his Interests are fully pro tested. % this end 1 would urge Government to be pleased to consider the expediency of putting forward for eoleotlon as British Consul sol oner the names of officers conversant with the politics end if possible the languages of the Shatt-al- Arab region, os being likely to have a better chance of est ablishing confidence and sympathetic relations with the shaikh.

A translation of the Articles of the convention dealing with Kuwait including the extradition elauoe, as framed in the secretary of State's telegram of l?th Juno - alternative (11), was read to him. Ho demurred sorevhat at the exclnlon of Utan Kaar and 0afwan but had apparently resigned Mmeelf to their loss and as regards the rest of the boundary he acquies ced in it practically without renark. In tho remainder of the Kuwait articles there were throe points on which he had something to say. (1). the clause In article (S), providing for the location of a rurkloh Agent at Kuwait. f / (ii). the use of the word 'Khalaf' { &lt; _&gt;U ,r ) •miocosoor* and not 'solad* ( ^Jjjl ) m SO no, in article % (in).8 - r S'- &lt; (rT) (1U). tlio ciauoa providing for the eetebllahmont of uio- torau Offloan In article a* It v»a •;&gt; I ten (l) with which the dlscunslon which fol lowed wee B#inljr concerned, hut it will be nore convenient to dispose of (11) and (111) flret. 9.

We now cornu to his rain objection, the clause requiring hie to receive a Uriel oh 'Coasdsoaire* or Agent in ^wait.

''1th the firet two natters I have dealt sufficiently in ■ the foregoing paragraphs. As regards the third, his future attitude towards foreigners, shaikh hobarsi Incidentally re- | forrod to the question of the overtures wade to hia In the tsact I by Messrs PonoMmue &amp; Co., ami enquired whether his obligation to admit a lurklah /sgent involved any obligation or pemleeion to admit other foreigners. I replied that our advice to hlw to keep heesrs v»onokliaus and otdiere at a safe distance had re- feronoe partly to the Indefinite nature of his status vis a vie the htrks; a fact which waa likely to afford such persons op portunity for Intrigue. X continued that wy parsonal view was that the regulation and establishment of his status by the pre sent convention somewhat altered the position, but I explained that the terns of the convention only provided for and referred to the admission of a iurkish Agent, and did not affect his existing understanding with us as yagavla others; so that X considered that it was still obligatory fer him to consult us before admitting other foreigners. I concluded, however, that I would, if he desired, nake a freoh roforcno* to Sovornrent with regard to the case of fesore tonckhaus and ascertain their views. Jiobaraic agreed that that was the beet eoursse to(Ztf) (il pursue, and I truat that I shall rooelve Instructions on the point* 12 * 'Ihough there la no doubt that by the achievement of the Convention with Turkey, Shaikh Hobarak # e position, provi ded that he hae our staunch support in repelling the slighteet oncroachraent by the Turk a on the terms of it, is greatly im proved, yet there can equally be no doubt that in virtue of our engagements with Kuwait, more especially Articles 5 , 9, 10 and 12 of the Shwaikh Agreement, we bear a very oerious and lively responsibility towards the Shaikh; and I therefore venture very respectfully to draw pointed attention to those Articles now, and to expreso the earnest hope that we shall demonstrate to the Shaikh and to the Porte,froa the moment the Convention comes into operation, our fixed intention to protect i^iaikh Hobarak 1 ® interests to the utmost* « IS* Before concluding thia somewhat lengthy report, I should like to avail iwyeelf of the opportunity* now that those portions of the Convention affecting the -haikhs of Kuwait and ^hamerah are practically completed, of rooording ny acknowledgments for the loyal co-operation which X have received throughout from Captain Shakespear and Uajor Haworth, the Political Officers accredited to those potentates, at ray recent Interviews and in the spade work done on the spot in connection with the details.

At my interview with four Honour and our friend Sardar Arfa (Sheikh of Mohammorah) today, I told Your Honour of my having learnt from Captain Shakespear of your being somewhat disturbed by the condition in the Convention dealing with the location of a Turkish representative at Kuwait. I in formed Government of the anxiety which you felt on the sub ject and today I have informed you verbally of the terns of their response. I also explained to you my personal view that the mere existence of the necessity of appointing a Turkish Agent would be rather a useful indication of the ad ministrative autonomy of your Government. As you requested I now write to you the purport of the communication which I was instructed to make to you, so that you may have it by you. In it Government intimate that in their opinion the points which you have conceded in the course of this agree ment - which was on a give and take basis - you must regard as the price paid in exchange for the great advantages which you derive from it. Among them the confirmation of your in dependence on the basis of this Convention, and the formal recognition of your extensive claims. Further, it is not hidden from Your Honour that the Sublime Porte undertakes not to interfere in the question of succession or In the in ternal or external affairs of your administration* and you are also aware that there will always be an Agent of the British Government accredited to you at Kuwait; again, it is established in your mind that you have the formal assurance of the British Government to support you in your affairs, bo £ f s~ longI4-5 long as you faithfully obsarva your engagements to us as you have in the past* and Having regard to all these considerations^after these explicit explanations, the British Government is confident that Tour Honour will realise that the matter of the appoint ment of a Turkish Agent at Kuwait is one of the nature of a formality and that there is no cause for you to be alarmed and disturbed thereby* In conclusion I am directed to assure you that there is no divergence between your interests and those of the British Government, and that if they had seen in this detail anything harmful or dangerous for Your ^nour, they would not have approved of it or recommended it for your acceptance* Cox*KHCLOSURE 3 r^nelation of lotter from Sir Uobarak bin Subah# K*C.®*E.

I am highly obliged for your compliance with the views of the British Government. Your Honour drew attention (in the same communication) to certain items contained in the Treaties and engagements existing between the British Government and yourself. Your friend has not got the text of them here in L 0 hammerah, ex cept the translation of the agreement executed between your self and Colonel Meade, Resident in the Persian Gulf, on 23rd January 1899. The purport of that instrument is that Your Honour would not receive an agent from any foreign Government without previous reference to and the concurrence of the British Government. In the course of the present negotia tion it was necessary for the British Government to acquiesce in the appointment of an Agent of the Turkish Government at Kuwait as the price of the recognition of the administrative autonomy of your Government and in return for the other ad vantages accruing to Your Excellency, as set forth in the document in question. Secondly, with reference to the use of the word Stic— cessor' (Khalaf) instead of the word ,, sons ,, (aolad) / therein. There was no motive behind this, ior you are aware thc^t as stipulated in the Convention, the Turkish Government speci fically refrains from concerning itself with this question, and agrees not to interfere in connection therewith.

I visited the Shaikh on the day following the receipt of your instruc tions and was careful to dwell upon the efforts which His Majesty’s Govern ment had made to secure above all things the autonomy of Kuwait, an acknowledgment of our special relations with its Ruler, the recognition as far as possible of the boundaries claimed by the Shaikh and his more practical interests such as a definite pronouncement regarding his authority over adjacent islands and the nearer Bedouin tribes, the prohibition of any interference by the Porte in Kuwait’s domestic or foreign questions, the exclusion of Turkish troops from Kuwait territory and the admission of the Shaikh’s right to the undisturbed enjoyment of his properties on the Shatt-el-Arab. However, as no negotiations could be conducted without a certain amount of give and take, it hadl)een found necessary apparently, in order to obtain these solid advan tages, to give way on some points of detail to avoid wounding Turkish susceptibilities and it was therefore probable that the Turkish posts at Safwan and TJmr Kasr would continue, whilst the recognition of Turkish suzerainty would be likely to entail a demand by the Porte for the residence of a Turkish representative in Kuwait. The Shaikh heard me patiently enough, occasion ally interjecting a shrewd question as to exactly what might be involved by an acceptance of Turkish suzerainty. In reply, I gave the analogy of Egypt, where the Khedive, though nominally a Turkish Viceroy and a subject of the Sultan, enjoyed British protection and was for all practical purposes quite independent of the Porte, who had no word in his internal administration, the collection of revenue, and the like. 3. The Shaikh rather resented the continuance of the posts at Safwan and TJmr Kasr, but when I explained that we were endeavouring to secure the recognition of his boundary as touching these places and that the permanent location of half-a-dozen Turkish soldiers in a mud fort at these points really made no practical difference, he seemed inclined to agree. His attitude, however, was quite different when I intimated that recognition of Turkish suzerainty might entail the reception of a Turkish Agent in Kuwait, as such was actually the case in Egypt. The Shaikh was so surprised at the possibility that he asked me to repeat and explain the matter to him more tnan once, and when I had done so, he became most vehement in his opposition to the idea. He begged me to telegraph at once intimating his refusal to accept any Turkish official under any guise whatever in Kuwait. He used all the arguments which I had anticipated in my letter No. 8 C. of the 30th April 1913, and finally said that the presence of one such official, for he knew2 from bitter experience what Turkish officials were, would destroy whatever good the proposed Agreement might hold, would weaken bis authority locally and in the adjacent desert, wouldlead to constant strife and the formation of parties among his people, whilst the Turkish Agency would become a focus for domestic and foreign intrigue which would probably involve the British Government itself at no distant date in difficulties at present not to be foreseen. Having done my best to reassure the Shaikh I left and despatched my first telegram to Fao. 4. On the following day the Shaikh came to see me with particular reference to our conversation described above. I was surprised as he was not very well at the time and even if in good health he seldom returns an informal visit on the following day. He had evidently been considering what 1 had told him and had realised that, though his refusal to accept a Turkish official in Kuwait might be sincere enough and couched in the most emphatic terms, he would be unable to persist in that refusal should the British Gov ernment have accepted the principle of representation and should the Porte demand its fulfilment. On this occasion the Shaikh first reiterated his previous arguments, every whit as vehemently, then he pointed out that Colonel Meade’s Agreement of January 1899 was framed with the sole purpose of preventing what we now suggested as likely to come about, viz.) the advent of foreign officials in Kuwait. Further, we had expressly named the Turkish Government, as one it was particularly desirable to exclude from Kuwait, in the lease agreement for Bandar Shweikh, concluded in October 1907. Besides at our suggestion he had repeatedly rejected German over tures though in doing so he was forfeiting the increase in his Customs revenue which a German firm established in Kuwait would undoubtedly have contributed. He urged that he had faithfully observed his part of a bargain, which was now 14 years old, and had agreed willingly to it, because he realised its advantages to himself as well to us and all he desired w r as that the exclusion of foreigners might continue as heretofore. The Shaikh then enquired what had been decided witli regard to tne Baghdad Kail way, in reply to which I gave him the gist of what had appeared in the news tele grams, observing that I had no official confirmation. The Shaikh evidently had at the back of his mind that his interests had been used by us in some bargain with the Turks, for he asked whether the settlement with the Porte only concerned Kuwait and himself or other Gulf questions and the Baghdad Railway. I replied that I fancied probably an agreement had been reached on all questions, for that was indicated by the news telegrams, though what I had received from the Residency related only to Kuwait. He was exceedingly perturbed by the idea of having to accept a Turkish official and reverted to the subject again and again saying there was no need to agree to that item, as the Turks were a beaten and weak nation now, apart from the fact that they never have had a representative in the place; the only occasion on which they attempted to force one upon him, a quarantine official some years before the establishment of the British Political Agency, he had turned the man out summarily. He went on to point out that from what I had told him, he failed to see why any concession need have been made to the Porte, he was content to remain as he w^as, his authority in the desert could not be disputed by the Turks, he was not and never had been subject to them, his position as “ Ruler of Kuwait and Chief of its tribes ” w as not disputed, and if the Turks liked to address him as “ Kaimakam ” or by any other title, that did not alter the fact as he never so subscribed himself. He had the very strongest objections to the residence of a Turkish official in Kuwait, and he begged me to telegraph again, placing a special boat at my disposal for the despatch of the telegram. 5. I have given the conversations in some detail in order that the Shaikh’s attitude may be fully understood. To me his attitude is no surprise, and whenever the opportunity has occurred, I have endeavoured to present the local view, for it seemed important, seeing that these negotiations have been conducted without the Shaikh having been given any idea as to their course, that we should avoid concessions of a nature likely or calculated to disturb ourown relations with the Shaikh and thereby affect our interests here detriment- allv In my letter No. 8 C. of the 30th April 1913, I attempted to forecast u,e' mann“ in which the Draft Agreement of the 26th March was likely to be received and in the light of the Shaikh’s ob J e ^ 10 f { a \ “^^o th^ when for the first time he has been given some idea of the terms or me proposed agreement, I would invite a reference to the last three paragraphs of that letter. j. • i 6 Though I fear it is probably too late now to hope for any materia alteration ^whatever may l'e the terms of the final draft of the Agreement I feel comnelled to record my conviction as to the probable effect of any agiee- ment'which does not con.ainmost of the emendations I have already ventured T submit, and more especially which does not provide for the exclusion of Turkish officials from Kuwait. , * a i There has been a growing tendency for some years on the part of Arabs to u Vova th-it the Christian Powers are determined to reduce Islamic nations tfiZotence and ihe tendency has received no small impetus from the two wars m which Turkey has recently been engaged. The idea is reflected m Egyptian Press, it is encouraged in the Ottoman Press, andis^ot abs^f ,om thrs“as a noryTwa^ed generally into an accusation definitely anti- Britisli though indications iu that direction have not been wa- ng, in Nowait the Shaikh more than any one else has combatted ant,-Bn n ^ons of this kind and has'alwavs held up the British Government as the o., one which „nbl he trusted to keep its word, deal even-handed ustice, not to discriminate r e tween he rel5i„us P beliefs of its subjects and not to oppress the weak. Nevertheless the%ower wMch cheap ri Q v 0 e W that aUAmb' ITA ifgospel iscmu^erable, and I venture to think mu^h under-rated by us, ^ho are in the habit of estimating at its true value what is nurveved by various organs, and the effect is undoubtedly noticeable in Kuwait to-day At the same time there is not one Kuwaiti in a thousand in Kuwa t to aay. a Tar kish rather than a British subject if he were who would piefer to be aJUir had su(fic i en tly intimate dealings wiUi 1’urks aTtheir officials to thank God that the* own Ruler is f 'f • rlAnpnflpnt and under the protection of the British Government, I havefad af^uch elpreld to mo time and again, the moral being pointed frpnuentlv by a grateful reference to our action in past times in landing frequently oy a ^ f f Kuwait an( i i n the summary dismissal ^Turkish ra^^)f-war get^^fae^^a^KuwaiTi^on^he i “ i p»i.» p f |° r th orSha^kh e Mubarak, and that all things considered the position is about death ot Shaikh MuDarax a = it would continue and confirm fraedoTfror Turkish' interference and the attentions of VCa 1 T w“lye may not appear germane to the Anglo-Turkish a * f it rmv serve to show the general attitude of the people and the Ruler 'who' are Ummost nearly affected by that Agreement The Agreement Power, ^^feaseven lfind it d ffi^t to avo ^ suze , aint hitherto Agreement contains cla ^ e3 Ti W “Xialin Kuwait, hitherto strenuouslyBritish Government to make this agreement concerning us, so seriously to our detriment, and that too when Turkey is of no account in the world ? ” The answer locally is obvious, viz., that Kuwait has been made use of by the British Government to obtain something else, a recognition of other claims elsewhere, a concession in regard to the Baghdad Railway, and the like. When it is remembered further that the Ruler of Kuwait has not been con sulted during the negotiations, has not been informed as to their course, and is to be presented with a fait accompli of some such description, I submit it is not unreasonable to expect the deepest disappointment and resentment at our action. How that resentment will affect our future relations I am loathe to contemplate, but I feel sure that its effect will not be merely local—it will affect us along the whole Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf by shaking the confidence which our support has hitherto inspired. No amount of explanation will ever remove the impression that we have used Kuwait as a pawn to secure other advantages for ourselves, more especially if some such advantages later ' 3ome manifest, as, for instance, a settlement in our favour of the Baghdad Railway question. 8. It may be said J have exaggerated the probable disappointment, and overrated its pos^' 1 ’ . It may be so but with over four years* ex perience of V 1 ' * r and its people, with whom the discussion of high politics on f lines supplied by the vernacular press occupies almost tb , I feel it to be my duty even at this late hour to endea^ do 8 reconsideration of what appears to be almost a com- jn that document seems calculated to destroy with a stroke a which we have been at no small expenditure of energy pie' of anu uey u» consolidate in Kuwait, particularly, during the last ten years or more.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100027915586.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/262/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100027915586.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/262/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1247/1912 Pt 2 'Anglo-Turkish Agreement.
