Awongst other things he asked to bring to the Political Residen t’s notice that the British Agent at Gwadur for some time past has been issuing to Persian subjects coming chiefly from Persian -Baluchistan Indian visas on passports not endorsed by the Persian Authorities. It is further alleged that the British Agent has also issued Certificates of Identity for the journey to India to certain Baluchi-Persi an subjects rho have professed British nationality, although obviously unable to establish any proofs of their claims. Colonel Rowle desires me to request you to enquire into these allegations an d if found to be correct to issue orders to the British Agent to di s^ continue these practices.
