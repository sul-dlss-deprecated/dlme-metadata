In sunk relief, head of king (or queen) facing right, preserved from top of head to just under the eye. Elaborate headdress with diadem under uraeus. Sculptured portions unpolished. Undecorated surface highly polished.\r\nCondition: Preserved portion in good condition. No inscription. Use of object not clear. Width seems preserved intact suggesting an inlay (?). Possibly a model but use of granite makes this unlikely. Headdress probably archaistic after late XVIIIth dynasty style.", "medium": "Basalt", "dimensions": "2 11/16 \u00d7 5 1/2 \u00d7 2 in.
