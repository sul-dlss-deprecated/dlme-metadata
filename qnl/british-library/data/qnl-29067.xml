Monsieur 1© ’'inistre T have the honour to inform Your Excellency that I have received a comminication from the Ministry of Justice draving my attention to a criminal case i hich has arisen at Changvad Ubol and in vhich an Indian British subject named A’&lt;a Pasa is being prosecuted on a charge of assault committed on an Annamite French subject named Ngian-Vanchao. As the accused is a British subject, the case \ ould, in the ordinary course, have to be tried by the Siamese Competent Court. But the injured man to whose detriment the offence was committed being a French subject under the Jurisdiction Protocol annexed to the Treaty bet^ een France and Siam the case would have to come under the juris diction of the International Court. The question therefore arises in which of these Courts the case should be tried. The Ministry of Justice is of the opinion that in all cases where the jurisdictional right under the Treaties of the plaintiff or aggrieved party is in conflict with that of the defendant or accused, the right of the latter alone should be considered in deciding the jurisdiction of the Court over the case and the procedure to be followed and in this particular case, I am informed, Judge Buszard has informally obtained the concurrence of your legation to have the case tried in the Siamese Competent Court, and so far as the French Legation is concerned no objection was raised to this procedure. 4 . His Excellency Monsieur Cecil F.J. Dormer. His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary* Bangkok* AsAs this solution seems to be quite satisfactory to all concerned the 'finistry of Justice proposes that it be adopted as a rule in the future. Accordingly, it is proposed that in all under the Treat 3 the parties concerned are subject to the Jurisdiction of different Courts the Jurisdictional right of the defendant or accused alone shall be l\ considered in deciding the Jurisdiction of the Court over the case as well as the procedure to be followed, without regard to the right of other parties concerned. I shall be much obliged to be informed if there is any objection on the part of your Legation to the above rule being adopted. I avail myself of this opportunity, Monsieur le Ministre, to renew to Your Kxcellency the assurance of my highest consideration. (Sgd) Phya Srivisar.

The ooservations ox His Majesty^ Minister at bangle ok have now been received, and I am to invite Lord Birkenhead’s attention to certain alterations which have oeen insei'ted in consequence thereof:- (a.) In article 2 oi the new Order, which amends certain articles of the Principal Order, the words 'civil matter or civil or criminal cases' replace 'civil or criminal cases' in article 5 of the original draft. This amendment follows more closely the wording oi the Principal Order. (b) Article 9 of the Principalgirder has been repealed ana replaced oy a red^fft of article 22 of the 1906 Order in Council. T^.s has oeen done in order to provide the alternative of trial by jury to urial oy assessors, and it has therefore become necessary to re-enact article 24 of the 1906 Order, xhis appears in the draft now submitted for Loi’d Birkenhead’s consideration as article 3. (c) The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. i l 6 \ vJ* (c) Article 10 is a new article providing for trial of certain evoked civil cases in the Straits Settlements. Power to do this is derived from section 9 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 18S0. His Majesty’s Minister at Bangkok has reported, in response to a telegraphic enquiry, that he is in favour of this addition to the draft Order in Council. 3. Sir Austen Chamberlain will be glad to learn whether Lord Birkenhead concurs in the wording of the revised draft Order in Council.

I am to explain tnat the protocol grants for the first time the right, of evoking criminal cases in which a British subject is defendant or accused from the Siamese Courts. In view of previous experience, it is unlikely that auch, if any, use will be made of this right, but it is necessary to provide for its exercise, and articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the draft Order in Council have been inserted accordingly. In the event of its being necessary to evoke an important criminal case, it would probably not be convenient for it to be tried in Siam, and provision has therefore oeen made in article 4 for such cases being sent for trial to the Straits Settlements. Similarly, there are at present no facilities for the imprisonment in Siam of British subjects who may be convicted in evoxed cases, and it has therefore oeen provided in aruicle o or tne draft Order that such persons may be sent for imprisonment to Singapore, naagoon or Calcutta. 3 .
