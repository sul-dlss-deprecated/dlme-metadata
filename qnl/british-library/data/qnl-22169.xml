No.C/220 The 28th of February, 1946 My dear Belgrave 7/ith reference to our recent conversations I am writing to request you to ask the State medical authorities to put forward proposals for the improve ment of Public Health facilities. They might attack the problem from two angles - one purely State and the other in co-operation with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. I am writing to the Chief Local Representa tive and am asking him if he will ask one of the Company doctors to confer with Snow on the subject. 2. A further matter which calls for improvement is that the State finds it difficult to keep its medical staff due to the insufficiency of the salaries paid. This has resulted in the curtailment of medical facili ties. I should be grateful for your suggestions to remedy this. Yours sincerely C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, BAHRAIN NS.No.C/222. rhe 28th February, 1946. Dear Russell Brown, Reference our recent conversation about health and health services in Bahrain. * 2. The Bahrain Government are review ing the question of the public health ser vices, and I should be grateful if you would ask one of your doctors to co-ope rate with Dr. Snow in this review. Yours sincerely, &lt;1 Russell M. Brown, Esq., The Bahrain petroleum Co., Ltd., Bahrain.f r GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. d.q.i Advisarate, 25, 1946. I Qnclose two copios of a note from Snow on Public Health Schemes for the future. We had a long discussion on this subject before he wrote the note and I am in agreement with the suggestions which are contained in it. 2. The anti-malaria committee to which he refers was set up some years ago under the presidency of Shaikh Muhammed bin Isa. It was rather a cumber sole Dody and although useful in the beginning when it was difficult for the Government to obtain access to houses and gardens for the purpose of anti-malaria measures it is not now retired as the public are accustomed to the visits of the anti-malaria squads and there is rarely any difficulty in obtaining access to premises. 5. The question of quarantine works in with passport regulations'hnd can, I think, be made fairly effective. At present smallpox is the only notificable disease but labour. The Manama town water scheme should do much to improve the situation in Manama as when there is a plentiful supply of piped water and public water supplies the Government will be able to prohibit house wells in the town. undoubtedly there are still many hidden cases. Vacci- • . nation is no longer unpopular and people of all classes submit to it. 4. Our anti-maiaria work has been rather restricted lately owing to lack of transport and shortage of Confidential. TD A I-T A T T 'R ’ ^ ^ K F PT • 2 /—5. The V.D. position is really grave and I have been approached by various Arabs on the subject ashing that the Government should 'do something' to reduce its prevalence. Some years ago I discussed this matter with the Manama Municipal Council and they approved of the suggestion that prostitutes should be registered on the condition that no record of the discussion should be made in the Municipal recordsl When this matter was examined more thoroughly it was found that the then existing medical staff was insufficient to cope with such a large matter as regular medical inspections of prostitutes. 6. I am doubtful about a public sewage scheme but the firm which instals the water scheme may be able to make useful suggestions about this. I rather think that a primitive method, such as that which exists now is safer than an elaborate system which would probably be misused. Filling in of land lying inside the sea roads in Manama and Muharraq has been hold up owing to the exorbitant cost of stone and labour during the war years. 7. One of the main difficulties over controlling the markets is that they are privately owned by His Highness and his brothers and uncles. My efforts to acquire them have not been successful. If they were Municipal markets they could be more properly controlled. 8. Regarding vital statistics, I have discussed this with Municipal authorities and they have agreed to a recording of deaths but they were averse to a recording of births which they still regard a measure that would be offensive to local susceptibilities. In these matters it is very desirable to obtain the approval of the local Municipal Councils, who are supposed to represent thepeople, these and similar measures should first be tried out in Manama where the townsfolk are more intelligent and less conservative than the people in the villages and the smaller towns, The new Municipal system by which the town of Manama is to be divided into wards will make recording of statistics more easy than before as instead of there being members n~ representing different religious and nationalities the members will represent different areas of the town ana arrangements can be made for them to undertake some of the responsibility for reporting deaths etc. 9. I should like, with Snow, to discuss this whole question when you are free to do so. Lieut. Colonel A.C. Galloway, O.B.jS., E. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.

It is based on the formation of a new body called The Public Health and Welfare Committee,and the automatic dissolution of the anti-mal- -arial committees. This new committee is designed to be small,composed only of key people vitally concerned,to meet once a month,and to dis- —cuss each question to a solution.• Their findings should be submitted to HoB*M*s Political Agent and The Adviser to the Bahmaln Government with recommendation for action by the local authority concerned. The proposed Committee is the following :- The Secretary - Manama Baladiya. The Secretary - Muharraq Baladiya. The S«M.O. The Q.M.C. The L.M.O. A doctor from Bapco. A social worker. It is further recommended that the following members be co-opted when certain subjects relating tojtheir work arise:- The Commandant of Police for Antl-V.D.,Sanitation, Vital Statistics. and The State Engineer for Town Water and Sewage schemes The Food Controller for Nutrition and food protectionGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.

My dear Belgrave, Thank you for your Demi-Official letter No.644-10 of the 25th March, 1946. I don’t think that it is neces sary for us to have a discussion. I give you my views in brief below on Dr. Snow's minute and hope you and he will be able to take the first steps towards putting something into practice to improve conditions in Bahrain affecting general health. 2. My views are:- (a) Committee . . I see no objection to the Committee and only hope it is progressive. (b) Quarantine . Arrangements on this score seem to me to be satisfactory and I think energies should be directed in other channels at present. (c) Anti-Malaria Work. I agree to the pushing ahead of this as suggested. (d) Anti-Venereal Disease . The figures which have come to ray notice are quite shocking. The State should, in my opinion, take urgent steps to prevent the further spread of this disease, and its cure. (e) sanitation . I don’t see how legal action can be taken to punish promiscuous squatting before a sufficiency in latrine accommodation has been provided. I agree with Dr. Snow that some new design is required and think that the rusty old tin sheds on the water front which have been steadily deteriorating for years are an eyesore^ wu6 up and a disgrace to the State. (f) Flies . Not much, I imagine, can be attempted on that score until some of Dr. Snow's suggestions regarding rubbish disposal, cleaning, latrines, etc., have been carried out. I don’t follow your remark about His Highness and members of his family owning the markets. I think you mean that they are re-actionary in regard to cleaning and that the position is difficult since they own the markets. To me it is incredible that the Ruler should adopt an obstructive attitude and I suggest you tackle him on the subject. (g) Anti-Trachoma . No comments. /(h) Maternity C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN. The 16th of April, 1946.(h) Maternity, infant Vvelfare &amp; Schools . I think these matters should be leit until the main problems under (c), (d), (e), (f), (j) and (m) have been attacked. (i) Nutrition &amp; Food Protection . As for (h). (j) Village Dispensaries . I am not clear as to the present poslcion regarding these dis pensaries, but understand that some are closed for want of staff. I agree that efficient dispensaries should be maintained in the main . villages. (k) Tuberculosis . As for (h). . (l) Lunatics . ' As for (h). (m) Lepers . I wonder how many of these poor creatures there are on the Islands. I should most certainly and definitely say that they should be segregated and at once. (n) Orphanage &amp; Poor Hel1ef . As for (h). You x have just collected some Rs.6,000/- for the Orphanage. (°) Annual Vital 3oatistics .

Memorandum: - I forward herewith a copy of the minutes of the last meeting of the Bahrain Public Health Com mittee which dealt with maternity, infant welfare and schools. 2. The question of local midwives has always been a difficult one, many Arabs prefer local, untrained, midwives but the majority of these resort to methods which contribute to infant mortalityssuch as the salt treatment. Many of the local midwives are old women who will never adopt modern methods but we may have some success with the younger women. 3. The new womens hospital which is shortly to be opened in Muharraq provides more in-case accommodation for women than the present building, when the new hospital is in use there should be considerably more maternity cases treated in hospital than there are now Bahrain Receigt No...Date Confidential.

At present at least 500 are born in the Hospitals of Manama and the maternity dispensary of Muharraq. The Muharraq resident dispensary is being moved to bigger premises where 14 maternity cases can be looked after instead of 8 as heretofore. t Infant mortality rate was considered high, to be combated by more post-natal measures* Maternal mortality is not known, but is low in the hospitals.

(This based on a series of receptacles which would be emptied and cleaned once a week. ) The Committee were well aware of the difficulties of drainage for inland latrines, but consider it to be a vital necessity for the town. On the erection of these latrines, public squatting would then be rigorously prevented and made illegal.

The wells referred to in para E are surface wells which exist in almost every house in Manama and in many houses in Muharraq, they are about 6-10 feet deep and have always been a source of mosquitoe breeding. Since anti-malaria meas\juy3s have been taken these wells are regularly suppliecfrish or are oiled to prevent breeding. h S.Z. ___7 \ u GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. 1 . 2 . 3. 4. / 6 - MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. PROCEEDINGS OF THE BAHRAIN PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE COIviMI TTEE . JANUARY 20TH 1947 . SUBJECT 5 . ANTI - MaLaRIA. The Bahrain Government existing scheme was approved as adequately satisfactory. Its success rests largely on intensive prophylactic work in the gardens over a wide area, thereby preventing the Mosquito from entering Manama« The Manama Water Supply Scheme is now launched, and will eventually substantially reduce the necessity for house wells of which 2000 exist, and which are under weekly inspection and treatment to prevent breeding. The present R.A.F. control system was questioned. Their expert has been consulted and he is reviewing the fa * situation as to how^their control should now extend over Muharraq island. The Bapco work has been very greatly intensified, and now an American expert is in charge and is operating over a wide area embracing Sitra, the Sanad belt, The Rifa’as, Karazakan and Zillag. A wider use of D.D.T. spraying is under review. Bapco experimented in November with wholesale spraying of all villages as above mentioned with immediate results in destroying domestic adult mosquitoes. Breeding prevent— -ion must however go hand in hand with this work. Malaria for 1365 was the lowest on record, with a sub- -stantial reduction of on all previous years. Date • 7 . Secretary.

The findings of The Public Health and Welfare Committee, after two meetings discussing this subject, were:- 1. Most members were agsinst the use of any form of control, 2. Voluntery supervision and registration of prostitutes to be encouraged instead. 3. Two public health indian doctors, one male one female, unanimously recommended to carry this out. Duties would also include house visiting and inspections. In addition these officers would be used for ante-natal, maternity, and school work. Recommended they should be carefully picked and highly paid. V e D. patients should be made to pay for treatment accord ing to their circumstances. 5. Prevention of V.D. Lectures to be taught in the schools to higher classes. 6. Deportation not recommended unless prostitutes have specifically entered Bahrain for this purpose. CCfcMSNT. While I personally think it a pity that a certain amount of control should not be exercised, yet most people thought that it would antagonise patients and the exercising of this control would be difficult to maintain and liable to be abused. The Mission also would not co-operate if control was enforced. R. H 0 B. Snow. Secretary, Public Health the Welfare Committee♦ QOViiRmiNT OF BAHRAIN Copy Medical Departmen t.
