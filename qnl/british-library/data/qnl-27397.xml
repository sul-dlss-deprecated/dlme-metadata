From The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, To His Britannic Majesty^ Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Iran, Tehran. Dated New Delhi, the 3rd January 1941. Issue of permits to British Indians by His Majesty's Consular Officers in Khuzistan. • • Sir, I am directed to refer to your despatch No. 85/(40/18/40), dated the 3rd July 1940 and to say that in the circumstances the Govt, of India agree to the discontinuance of the practice of obtaining repatriation deposits from British Indian subjects at Ahwaz and Khorramshahr. 2. The Govt, of India do not at present propose to replace the system of 'no objection' control by any other arrangement. A copy of a letter to the acxKangExxKfc Passport Issuing Authorities in India No .F.611-G/40, datec/bhe 3rd January 1941, is enclosed for information. I have, etc., 3d/- R.K.M.Saker. for Secy, to the Govt, of India.— _( . , h) “ 2 *- F.633-0/39, dated the 20th i) P ril 1939, and to state that ohc Government of India have had under consideration, in consultation with His Majesty s Minister in Tehran, the necessity for continuing the existing system whereby permits axe issued j0 British Indians by His Majesty's Consul at *hwaz ana His Majesty's Ticc^onsul at Khorrcmshrhr stating tnat there is no objection to the holders' return to Irax. It is considered undesirable to discontinue the practice, as such permits act as a check on the number of Indians proceeding to Khorramshahr and also enable His Majesty's Consular Officers to keep in touch with them after their arrival. Moreover,the fact that a deposit of Rials 300 is taken from e ch person before he is granted pCmit ’ 18 p - guarantee that, should he become destitute, sufficient money will be available for his repatriation to Indie?.,. 2 ” J In VltW ’ howovcr &gt; of the objection of the Iranian authorities to the issue of such permits, it has been decided to modify the present procedure on the following lines. In future each applicant will receive from His Majesty's Consul concerned, instead of a permit, a receipt showing that the deposit of Rials 300 has been made. The receipt will bear a serial number and either the letter 'A' to indicate the ^hwaz series, or the letter 'K' for the Khorromshahr series. Tins receipt will constitute sufficient evidence that there is no objection to the individual concerned returning to Ir.n and on its authority a passport may be issued in India, endorsed simply 'Deposit No », thc Heading 'Observations'-„ This will enable His Majesty's Consul.x Officers m Iron to keep control over the Indians going to their districts,, 0 * 1 ™ tc °4 d fr* the case of Indians who arc not/not employees of the hnglo-Ircxdai Oil Comprjiy, it hr.s been the practice of His Majesty T s Gonsul.er Officers in Khuzistrn to place a gratis endorsement on their passports reading ’’Good for journey to India end return”* The object of these endorsements is ahe same en that of the permits, namely to indicate that as far as His Majesty’s Consulates are concerned, there is no objection to the return of the individuals concerned. Ms this endorsement is also likely to be objected to by the Iranian authorities, it has been decided to alter the wording of the endorsement to read ’’Seen valid for the journey to India.
