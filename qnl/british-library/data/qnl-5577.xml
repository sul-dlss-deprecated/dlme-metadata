Z.5705/32. 2• Prom the Resident's despatch of 11th October (?•Z.6745/32) now submitted, it will be seen that he is in negotiation with the Sheikh of Kalba. The Resiaent also discusses the important question of the tactics to be adopted with Arab Sheikhs in circunstances such as the present. His despatch speaks for itself. On this point the Government of India have accepted his view (see their telegram of 1st November) and it is submitted that the Secretary of State may do likewise and that he may take the opportunity to impress again on the Air Ministry the importance of giving as long notice as possible in cases in which negotiation with the local Arab rulers in the Gulf is necessary.

He directs me to take this opportunity to emphasise again the great Importance of giving the longest notice possible in cases in which negotiations have to be undertaken in connection with the air route with the Arab Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf, so as to admit of the preliminary soundings consequent on which alone it seems probable that as a rule really satisfactory results may be looked for. 3/ 4000 7.323.

The Hon*Isle Lieut• ••Colone 1 T«C«W« yowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The foreign Secretary to the aovemnent of India, New Delhi. nfr (jround at Aalda . 8ir # I have the honour to refer to correspondenoe ending with India Office telegram Mo, 2538 of 1st October)l932 9 and to report that 1 have taken action with the object of obtain ing from the Shaikh of Kalba the required emergency landing ground in his territory. i8. I reoeired a telegram from the Air Officer Com manding in Iraq, Baghdad, that Captain Mackay, the Hoyal Engineer Officer in charge of the building of the Hest House at Shargah, had heard that the shaikh of Kalba was now in clined to adopt a more conciliatory attitude with regard to granting the air facilities retired from him* It would have been 4pen to me to send the Political Agent # Muscat, onee more to Kalba to negotiate with the bhaikh, but before I did so I wished—if possible—to make sure that he would not receive a second rebuff, on general grounds it is by no means good for our prestige in the (mlf that officers should proceed on officiaJ^issions to Arab shaikhs, with requests for air—or other—facilities, only to have their requests refused, while on particular grounds such a contre temps onlyjT ^&amp; &lt;S) only serves to render further negotiations more difficult* The Shaikh in question gets wind in the head from ths fact that he has been able to M turn do«n M a British officer 9 and having done so not unnaturally his attitude hardens. He finds it difficult to retreat fron the position he has taken up, and will only do so—unless under threat of compulsion —under cover of exorbitant demands• Unfortunately two oases of such rebuffs to officers have occurred in the last two months: to the Political Agent, Bahrain, at ^atar 9 and to the Political Agent, Muscat, at iialba. 3. In order to avoid, if it is practicable, such incidents in the future I propose, when air—or other- facilities are required from dhaikhs, to adopt a procedure used with some success in areas outside the Gulf where I have served: to find out beforehand by means of unofficial —or demi-official — 'representatives - ishat reception the Shaikh concerned is likely to give to the proposal* An Arab Shaikh is more likely to reveal—in the first instance at all events— the tortuous workings of his Arabian mind to a fellow Arab than to a British officer* Once tteve pre liminary soundings have been taken, and I am more or less au fait with what is the shaikh^ attitude on the subject, as well as that of his relatives and tribesmen, the questionjsf sending a Political officer to open official negotiations can be considered* These methods may seem protracted but with the Arab often •♦the longest way roand is the shortest way home**, and it is obvious that when an officer finally visits a Shaikh, after this preliminary reconnaissnoe has been made, he does so with the decided advantage of knowing pre viously how the land lies* I would have liked to aaopt these methods in the case of ^atar and before the Political Agent*s first visit to Kalba, but time did not permit, and of course if on any firttwe occasion long notice ie not poseibls and/ y - 3 - &amp; di no preliminary soundlnga oan be taJce n, a Political officer will have to be sent in a hurry tojapen negotiatione and take the risk of a rebuff* 4« In the present instance after receiTing the information from the Air officer Commanding in Iraq noted aboTe 9 and oonfimation from the Secretary of State for India that Kalba was still required as an emergency landing ground, I instructed the He si den cy Agent f ahargah, to ask the Shaikh of that place, whom I believe to have some in fluence with the Shaikh of itelba, to send a trustworthy representative to the latter with a view to sounding him on the subject. The »«present at ire duly started overland for Kalba but unfortunately could not get through owing to some Bedouin inter-tribal fighting, and had to return to Shargah. The Senior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, has very kindly arranged that he should be taken t^y a sleep to Kalba in a few days. I would have preferred the representative to have proceeded by himself under no official auspices whatever, but it is certainly much better that he should reach £alba somehow than not at all. On the receipt of the representative^ report I will consider the natter of sending the Political Agent, Muscat# once again to Kalba. I am sending copies of this despatch to the India Office, the Air officer Commanding in Iraq, and the Senior liaval Officer, &gt;^eraian Gulf Diwlsfcon, 1 have the honour to be.
