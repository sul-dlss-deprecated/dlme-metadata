Muscat, 1st June 1955. From, Major C.E. U.Bremner, M.C., Political Agent A Consul, Muscat. To, The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject :** Appointment of Assistant Engineer, . Persian Gulf Sv.h-Division. Sir, I have the honour to address you on the above subject. 2. I understand that the present incumbent of the post is shortly due to retire and I therefore submit for the consideration of the Hon’ble the Political Resident the name of B. Pardhan Singh, 7/ho is at present Supervisor, P. &amp;.D., at Muscat, as a possible successor. 3. This individual joined his present post in September 1934, since when he has been responsible for the construction of the Servants Quarters and Garages, the Power House and the completion of the Agency Main Entrance, at Muscat, apart many minor alterations and repairs. 4. In all these ?/orks, which have been excellently carried out, he has shc’^n considerable ability, intelligence and initiative,, and by the improvision of many labour saving devices he has not only effected considerable economy but has been able to employ material at his disposal in such a manner, as to render the actual construction of the building far superior (but at the same cost) to that contemplated in the original designs. The result of his initiative tuid s^ill were favourably commented on by the Deputy Cnief Engineer, when the latter recently passed through Muscat.2 . 5. The Reverend Dyketra of the American Mission, hinself a qualified and skilled ifri^ineer, has from time to time watched B. Pardhan Singh’s work and he has been consulted privately from time to time by the Supervisor on technical matters. As a result of his observations Ml. Dykstra is of the opinion that B. P- rdhan Singh shows technical skill and ability fur above the average of his grade. 6. He is an excellent draughtsman and quick and accurate in that sphere. As a Supervisor he supervises zealously and knowing Arabic fluently he can deal with local labour efficiently and does so without nagging and unduly distressing them. 7. As regards his integrity, this can be gauged to a certain extent by results such as repairs and alterations. Unlike works carried out by his predecessor, all such works executed by Pardhan Singh have stood the tent of several b or the and it ^ould appear therefrom that he lias used for the purpose intended the money and materials provided by Government, 8. I can hold no brief regarding his integrity in so far as labour is concerned and he probably follows the custom of most brethren of his Department and 'makes his little bit'. 9. All that I can state is that he is zealous and skilful in hie ‘ork, competent and full of initiative, a good daughtsman, and that the w^rks carried out under hie supervision are excellent. In the course of many years of close contact with all grades of the P.ThD. he strikes me as being far above the average of his grade. My observation in his case merely extends over 8 months so his present zeal and good work may perhaps only be for the purpose of creating an impression. 10. None the less he Hpr won golden opinions in the past and a Simple of recommendatory letters held by him are enclosed for perusal. He also holds the Certificate of a qualified4 quaiifiad Overseer from Roorkee College of Kncineering I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient eervnnt.
