GEOGRAPHY PHYSICAL AND POLITICAL (1) Position and Frontiers Persia , which has an area of about 628,000 square miles, lies between 25° and 40° north latitude and between 44° and 63° 30' east longitude, and measures 1,385 miles in length and 863 miles in breadth. The northern (Russo-Persian) frontier was deter mined by the Treaty of 1828 and the Conventions of 1881 and 1893. The section Ararat-Astara, a dis tance of about 180 miles, runs from the lesser Ararat down the Aras (Araxes) to Hasan Khalu, and thence south and south-east in a zigzag line to the Caspian at Astara # The Caspian shore then forms the frontier as far as Hasan Kuli Bay, whence the eastern section of the northern boundary (about 1,300 miles) runs up the Atrak to Chat; thence the line goes eastwards, crossing the Chandir at Chagan Kale v to Firuzeh, then south-east by Lutfabad to the Tejend at Sarakhs. The eastern section of the Russo-Persian frontier then continues southwards up the Tejend to Zulfikar, where the Perso-Afghan frontier begins. The eastern boundary then follows the Hari Rud to Kuhsan, south of which the line as far as Sistan was indi cated but not exactly defined in a settlement made by General Maclean in 1891. The southern part of the Perso-Afghan frontier was fixed by Sir Frederick Goldsmid's commission in 1872, and was once more delimited, after an alteration in the course of the Helmand, by Sir Henry McMahon in 1902-05, as crossing the northern part of the Hamun-i-Helmand, and thence going up the Helmand to Band-i-Sistan and south-west to Kuh-i-Malik Siah, where Persia, Afghanistan, and British Baluchistan meet. From this point for about 160 miles south-east to Gurani [285—98] B2 GEOGRAPHY [No. 80 near the Hamun-i-Mashkel the boundary is not fixed by local landmarks- South and east to Kuhak the line was marked out by Col. Sir T. H. Holdich's commis sion in 1896; and south-westwards to Gwattar Bay it was delimited by Sir F. Goldsmid in 1871. The southern frontier is formed by the sea. The western (Turco-Persian) frontier was delimited by a mixed Persian, Turkish, British, and Russian commission in 1914. It runs along the mountain ridges for about 750 miles south from Ararat to the Diala at a point about 155 miles north-east of Baghdad; thence it goes across the Baghdad-Kirman- shab route to Mandali, skirts the Pusht-i-Kuh hills, descends the dry Shatt el-Ama (Karka, Kharkeh) to the marshes west of Hawizeh, crosses south to the parallel of 31° north latitude, which it strikes in about 47° 42' east longitude, follows the parallel east to about 48° 1' east, and then turns due south to the Shatt el-Arab, which it finally descends to^the Persian Gulf. By the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, the British sphere of influence was defined as being south east of a line through Birjand, Kirman, and Bandar Abbas; the Russian sphere was north of a line drawn from Zulfikar to Yezd, Isfahan and Kasr-i-Shirin on the west. The intervening zone, including the oil- bearing south-west, was declared neutral. This agreement is now (1919) in abeyance. (2) Surface, Coasts, and Rivers Surface The whole of Persia consists, with the exception of some narrow strips of coast and a few valleys running up from the sea, of a tableland, rising in the north west to a height of more than 4,000 ft. and sloping towards the south-east to a minimum height of over 1,000 ft. From this plateau rise three systems of con tinuous mountain chains, radiating south-east from Ararat.Persia i SURFACE 3 Of these the Northern system is formed by the Kara Dagh (11,050 ft.) and Savatan Dagh (15,800 ft.), the Talish Mountains (8,038 ft.), and the Elburz range (highest point Demavend, a volcanic cone covered with perpetual snow, 18,549 ft.), continuing to the Aleh Dagh and associated ranges on the north-east, which reach a height of 11,000 ft. north of Nishapur. The chief pass through this chain is formed by the vallev of the Safed Rud. The Central system, from Sakand Dagh (11,630 ft.), south of Tabriz, runs south-east through the hill country of Khamseh to the mountains of Kuhrud (south of Kashan), reaching a height of 11,000 ft., then rising to the mountains of Kirman (14,500 ft.), and the ranges running into Baluchistan, with the volcanic Kuh-i-Taftan or Chehiltan (12,463 ft.) on the eastern frontier. The whole of the eastern border of Persia from this region northwards to Nishapur is fringed with ridges which collectively form a water shed between the deserts of eastern Persia and the watered basins of Baluchistan, Sistan, and Afghani stan. The Southern system runs from Ararat southwards along the Turkish frontier, then widening and trend ing south-east to the Alvend (12,300 ft.) and Zagros ranges. This broad belt of parallel ridges continues south-east into the Bakhtiari country, where it has summits attaining a height of 13,000 ft., into south east Arabistan by the Kuh-i-Dina (14,900 ft.), and into Pars, where the altitude diminishes, although the width of the belt of parallel chains increases, until it reaches the Straits of Hormuz. Here its northern ranges turn north-east to join the Kirman mountains, the southern ranges reappearing to the east of the straits as the coast-hills of Baluchistan. Coasts The coast of the Caspian (85 ft. below the level of the Black Sea) is a narrow shelf, at places only 5 miles [285—98] B 2wm^'mmmmrnrnssm 4 GEOGRAPHY tNo.so wide but opening to breadths of 30 miles at the delta of the Safed Rud and 20 miles at Amul. From Astara- bad the mountains strike east and the coast-line runs north, leaving a wide plain between them and the River Atrak. The ports on this coast are Astara, Enzeli, Meshed-i-Sar, and Bandar-i-Gaz. „ 1 At the head of the Persian Gulf is a triangle ot low ground, 130 bv 180 miles in extent, including the marshes of Hawizeh. To the south-east the shore is broken by the headland of Jebel Bang (1,000 ft-)j the low ground then widens again to about 50 miles inland from Bushire. For about 450 miles south-east of this the hills again encroach on the shore, and off the coast submerged ridges form islands, of which the largest is Kishm. At the head of the bay of Hormuz the hills again retreat to about 30 miles from the sea, and then close in for 100 miles to Jask, whence the Makran coast forms a low littoral, averaging 10 to 15 miles in brea.dth, as far as Gwattar. The chief ports on the southern coast of Persia are Bushire, Lingeh, Bandar Abbas, and Mohamnlera on the Shatt el- Arab. Rivers About three-fifths of Persia drain into various landlocked basins: (1) that of the shallow salt lake of Urumieh or Urmia (4,230 ft.) in the north-west; (2) the west central provinces, draining into the salt lake of Daria-i-Nimak (2,400 ft.); (3) the great salt desert of Khorasan or Dasht-i-Kavir (2,400 ft.); (4) the salt desert of Bijistan (2,000 ft.); (5) the great sandy desert of Dasht-i-Lut, containing the salt marsh of Namaksar (about 1,000 ft.); (6) the basin of Kirman, which includes the marsh of Shurab at Baft (2,900 ft.); (7) the basin of Bampur with the sweet water marsh of Jaz Morian (or Milan-i-Jihun) Hamun (about 1,100 ft.); and (8) the basin of Yezd and Nain, which contains a small salt desert (2,900 ft.). West of these are (9) the long upland valley of Isfahan; (10) the basin of the Niriz lake (5,100 ft.) fed by the Kur (Bandamir); and (11) the small basin of ShirazPersia] RIVERS 5 with its salt lake, the Daria-i-Meharlu (5,100 ft.). On the eastern border, but only partly in Persia, lies another series of landlocked basins, of which the greatest are that of the Tejend, with-the Kashaf Rud and the Jam as its tributaries within Persia, and that of Sistan, with its marshy lake, the Hamun-i-Hel- mand. The remaining two-fifths of Persia drain into the sea by rivers taking remarkably devious courses through close-s^t parallel valleys and transverse gorges opening the mountain ridges. Into the Caspian flow the Aras (Araxes); the Safed Rud, draining a complex group of valleys in the north-east; the Harhaz, flow ing from the Elburz mountains; and the Gurgan and the Atrak on the north-east. Into the head of the Persian Gulf flow the Diala, the Karka, and the Balmanshir channel of the Karun, Persia's largest river, navigable for light-draught steamers nearly to Shustar, except where it is interrupted by rapids at Ahwaz. Upon the northern shore of the Persian Gulf are many minor rivers, of which the Hindian is acces sible to small native boats, and the Mund (Mand) drains a great tract of hilly country south of Shiraz. (3) Climate Persia has many differing climatic regimes, in accordance with the strong contrasts presented by the country itself, which range from lofty mountain-lands where the snow lies long to sultry coasts and arid deserts. In the mountainous north-west there is a fair rainfall (Urumieh, 4,560 ft., 21-51 in.) and a moderate temperature (Tabriz, 4,650 ft., Jan. mean 17° F., July 79°; maximum 99°, minimum 18°). Over the centrar tableland little rain falls; Teheran (3,865 ft.) has 9 86 in., nearly all of which falls in winter, but Isfahan (5,300 ft.) has only 5 44 in., and the whole of the east of Persia receives hardly more than 6 in. of rain in the year. The temperature varies with the altitude; it is cold in winter but rises high under the6 GEOGRAPHY [No. 80 summer sun; Teheran has a January mean of 38° F., July 84° (maximum 111°, minimum 3°); Shiraz (5,200 ft.) has a January mean of 48° F., July 85° (maximum 113°, minimum 21°). On the coasts the rainfall also diminishes from west to east. Resht, on the Caspian, has 56 45 in., while Astarabad has only 16-28 in. Bushire, on the Persian Gulf, has 13-36 in., and an average temperature for July and August of 90° F., rising sometimes to 109° F., with damp heat; while Jask, on the Gulf of Oman, has only 3-24 in. of rain. The temperature of the Caspian coast at Meshed-i-Sar varies from a minimum of 15° F. in winter to 91° F. in summer; its mean for January is 32° F., and for July, 78° F. The prevailing winds are north-west (dry) and south-east (damp). On the Caspian, at Resht, a dry, hot, south-east wind, like the Alpine f 'ohn, blows in winter from,the snowy Elburz mountains. On the Persian Gulf, cold winds prevail in winter, and strong north-westerly winds in spring. At Yezd and in the deserts, sandstorms are frequent. In Sistan the ' 120 days' wind ' blows continuously during the summer, and blizzards occur in winter. (4) Sanitary Conditions The climate of the tablelands is not unhealthy, though its extremes of heat and cold are trying; dust- storms and sun-glare contribute to eye diseases in all parts of the country. The water supply is nearly always polluted; public baths are much used, but in a contaminated state; and the widespread use of drugs and opium, together with a want of care in diet and habits, undermines the strength of the people. Mosquitoes, flies, sand-flies, rats, and other vermin carry infection everywhere, and there is a cholera epidemic about every twelve years. There is, however, a quarantine against plague in Sistan and in the Persian Gulf ports. All the ordinary infectious ailments are common, and in the coast-lands malariaPersia] SANITARY CONDITIONS 7 is prevalent. The capricious and damp climate of the northern coast and the moist heat of the southern are dangerous, especially to Europeans and in summer. Ihe north-western and western central provinces, though cold and often wet in winter, are not unhealthy; nor is Sistan, in spite of its frequent and violent winds. (5) Race and Language The races of Persia may be classed as {a) aboriginal, and {h) immigrant. {a) The Persians proper, forming seven-tenths of the population, are descendants (not unmixed) of the original Caucasian stock of the country, and speak a modern form of the ancient Indo-Germanic Persian language. The Kurds, pastoral and semi-nomad peoples of the north-west, survive there in 12 leading tribes, and in northern Khorasan there are about 50,000 Kurds. Others are now found in Sistan. The Kurds speak various old Persian dialects. Of a kindred race are the Leks (or Laks) of the central provinces. Kurds and Leks together were reckoned in 1881 at about 675,000. The Lurs, original inhabitants of the south-west, and related to the Kurds, though hostile to them, speak a similar dialect. Their chief tribes (from west to east) are the Faili, the Bakhtiari, the Kuhgilu, and the Mamassani. Some are house-dwellers, but others are nomads. They were reckoned in 1881 at about 234,000. {h) Of immigrant races the most important are the Turks, who form about a fifth of the population; they are found in all parts of Persia as nomads, and as cattle-breeders and cultivators, also in the towns under chiefs appointed by the Shah. Though they have inter mingled to a certain extent with their neighbours, they are still distinguishable by their broader faces and sturdier build. They speak dialects of Turkish. Their chief tribes are: (1) The Kizil Bash ('red heads '), of which the main branches are the Afshars.8 GEOGRAPHY [No. 80 who inhabit the north-west, north, and central provinces, most of whom are settled, although some are still nomadic; the Qajars of the Elburz mountains, from whom comes the family of the Shah; the Baiats, who date back to the time of Jenghiz Khan; and the Shamlus from Syria. With the last came the Kara- gaztus of Hamadan, wiio are not reckoned among the Kizil Bash. (2) The Shahsavans or ' shah-lovers,' so called from their former support of the Shah against the Kizil Bash; they inhabit the north-wesl and west central provinces. (3) The Kashkais, agricultural and nomad, resembling the Bakhtiaris and inhabiting the same district. (4) The Guklans, cultivators of the Gurgan valley; and (5) the Yamuts, recent immi grants from Turkestan into the Atrak valley. (6) The Karais of eastern central Khorasan. (7) The Kara- kuin Lus, near Baft and in the north-west; and (8) the Kara Papak of Kirmanshah. Arah tribes occupy the southern part of Arabistan and the coast of the Persian Gulf. In the hills of Fars and Luristan they are mixed with Turks, and are known as the Khamseh. Various tribes of Arabs now haunt the hills and deserts between Khorasan and Kirman; they speak Persian and Arabic. In 1912 their number was given as about 300,000. The Baluchis of the south-east and of Sistan and Khorasan are considered by some authorities to be of Arab or Syrian descent, with a language containing Persian words; others have taken them to be of Rajput origin, and their language as an old Persian dialect. Gypsies are scattered all over Persia, numbering, it is said, about 100,000 (1912); they speak a language known as Gurbati. The Hazaras of the eastern border, though Mongol in origin, speak a dialect of Persian. Various minor mixed tribes also inhabit the extreme east of Persia. The ' Nestorians ' of the north-west, to the number of about 44,000, call themselves Syrians, being of Syrian descent, and speaking an ancient Syriac dialect.Persia] RACE AND LANGUAGE 9 Armenians, originally from the mountains on the north-western border, were brought into Persia in 1604, and planted in colonies at Julfa, near Isfahan, and elsewhere. They number about 50,000, of whom three-fifths live in Azarbaijan and the rest in Hamadan, Teheran, Julfa, &amp;c. They speak Armenian mixed with Turkish. Jews, to the number of 36,000, are found in nearly all the towns. Negroes, the descendants of slaves, are seen throughout Persia; and a colony of Hindus from Sind is settled in Kirman. About 1,200 Europeans reside in Persia, including about 600 British subjects (exclusive of British Indians). (6) Population Distribution No census has been taken, but the population was estimated in 1910 at about 10,300,000, and it is improbable that this number has been much, if at all, exceeded. The density of the population would con sequently average about 16 inhabitants to the square mile for the whole country; but very large areas of desert and mountain are occupied only by nomads, who number about 2,650,000 as against 5,100,000 inhabi tants of villages and 2,550,000 in about 100 towns. Another estimate puts the numbers as low as 9^ millions, and the urban population at about a million, but all figures are largely conjectural. T owns The principal towns with their estimated populations are as follows: Teheran, about 280,000; Tabriz, over 200,000; Isfahan and Kirmanshah, 80,000 each; Kirman, 50,000 to 75,000; Meshed, 70,000 to 80,000; Shiraz, Yezd, and Khoi, about 60,000 each; Hamadan and Barfurush, 50,000 each; Dizful, 45,000; Resht and Kazvin, about 40,000 each; Amul, 40,000 in winter and10 GEOGKAPHY [No. 80 20,000 in summer; Urumieh (Urmia), 30,000 to 40,000; Sinneh (Selma or Senna), 32,000; Kashan, 20,000 to 30,000; Semnan (Samnan) and Birjand, 25,000 each; Zinjan, 24,000; Burujird, 22,000; Knm, Gulpaigan, and Shustar, 20,000 each. Bushire is said to have from ]2,000 to 20,000 inhabitants. These figures, however, are merely round numbers, and estimates vary greatly. The general average increase from 1881-1910 is put at about 0'75 per cent, per annum. In the absence of statistics it may be said that General Sir A. Houtum Schindler, C.I.E., formerly a general in the Persian army, found the births to be reckoned by medical men at 25 to 40 per 1,000, and the deaths (in times when there were no epidemics) at 19 or 20 per 1,000; the excess of females over males he believed to be less than 2 per cent. Between 1880 and 1890 many Persians emigrated; subsequently a small immigration set in. Internally, there is the annual movement, in more thinly populated districts, of nomads travelling between their summer pastures and their winter retreats. Movement ♦ D r iPersia] II.

Preliminary Considerations It is necessary to preface the following brief sketch of Persian history with certain general considerations regarding this country and its people. First, it must be noticed that of the empires of the ancient world few have enjoyed so continuous a history for so long a period, or have recovered from so many vicissitudes, which might well have proved fatal, as Persia. She rose to greatness in the sixth century B.C. under Cyrus, Darius and the other Achsemenian14 HISTORY [No. 80 kings. Overthrown by Alexander of Macedon in the fourth century b.c., she remained for 550 years subject to Greeks and Parthians. In the third century a.d. another great race of Kings, the Sasanians, arose in Persia (the modern province of Fars), restored the Ach;emeiiian empire almost in its full extent (includ ing Babylonia), broke the power of the raiding Arabs, and held their own against the Romans. Overthrown by the Arab champions of Islam in the middle of the seventh century a.d ., the Persians began to recover their influence a century later; and the brilliant courts of the 'Abbasid Caliphs Haraun al-Raslnd and his son al-Ma'mun were largely dominated by Persian in fluences. From this time onwards, now under Persian, now under Persianized Turkish dynasties, Persia con tinued to play an important political role in history, and in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, under the truly national and popular Safawi dynasty, her alliance was eagerly sought against the then formid able power of the Ottoman Turks by most of the great States of Europe. In the first half of the nineteenth century she yet remained a power to be reckoned with; and even now it is far from impossible that her friend ship would be of value to any European Power which knew how to win it and how to make wise use of ft. Secondly, stress must be laid on the invariability of the national character, with its strongly-marked idiosyncrasies. To this a remarkable testimony is borne by Rawlinson in his translation of Herodotus, in the Introduction to which he says: ' This portraiture of the principal nations with which he is concerned, the Persians, the Athenians and the Spartans, is most graphic and striking. Brave, lively, spirited, capable of sharp sayings and repartees, but vain, weak, impul sive, and hopelessly servile towards their lords, the ancient Persians stand out in his pages as completely depicted by a few masterly strokes as their modern descendants have been by the many touches of a Chardin or a Morier. . . They possess in the pages of Herodotus an individuality which is a guarantee ofPersia] PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS 15 truth, and which serves very remarkably to connect them with that peculiar Oriental people the 'Frenchmen of the East/ as they have been called, at present in habiting their country .... This curious continuity of character very strongly confirms the truthfulness of our author, who is thus shown, even in what might seem to be the mere ornamental portion of his work, to have confined himself to a representation of actual realities.' What applies to the national type holds good also of the language. What is commonly called ' Modern Persian' 1 {i.e., post-Islamic Persian) has hardly changed in the last thousand years, and the Shah ndma, or ' Epic of the Kings, 15 composed by Eirdawsi 900 years ago, is at least as easily understood by a modern Persian as is Shakespeare by a modern Englishman, while the affinity of the present speech of Persia with that of the old rock-inscriptions of Cyrus and Darius is not only indisputable but obvious. Thirdly, the intellectual, literary and artistic talents of the Persians are conspicuous alike in the realms of religion, philosophy, science, belles lettres, archi tecture, ceramics, miniature-painting, calligraphy and the manufacture of carpets, shawls and the like. One of the great religions of the ancient world, Zoroastrianism, arose in Persia; so did Manichse- anism, which developed a wonderful art and literature of its own, recently laid bare in Chinese Turkestan, and of which the Albigenses sounded the last echo in the West; so did the early communistic-socialistic doctrines of Mazdak; not to mention the Siifi, Isma'ili, and other post-Islamic movements which profoundly affected the whole Muhammadan world. How much the Persians contributed to the brilliant so-called Arabian civilisation of the 'Abbasid court at Baghdad is often overlooked, because the vehicle employed was the Arabic and not the Persian language, so that people often think of scholars like Sibawayhi the grammarian, Tabari the historian. Binim the archaeologist, and Avicenna (Ibn Sina) the philosopher16 HISTORY [No. 80 and physician (to mention but a few typical names), as Arabs, though they were all Persians who wrote in Arabic, the learned language of their day and country, just as mediaeval French and -English scholars wrote in Latin. The Persians, therefore, have a great past, of which they are rightly proud; they are among the most talented peoples of Asia; and they might again, under more favourable auspices than they have lately enjoyed, develop a new and beautiful civilisation.

(2) From the .Gveek to the Arab Invasion (b.c . 330— a.d . 650) b.c . 330— a.d . 226.—After Persia had suffered the dommion of foreigners, first of the Greeks and then of the Parthians, for five centuries and a half an other great national movement, headed and directed by Ardashfr (Artashatr, Artaxerxes), son of Papak drove out the Parthians, restored the power to the Per sians, re-established the Zoroastrian religion, and made supreme for four centuries and a half the Sasa- man dynasty, who regarded themselves as the legiti mate successors of the Achaemenians, and whose aim it was to restore the Persian Empire as it had been in their time. [285—981 c18 HISTORY [No. 80 226-650.—Period of the Sasanian, or second great Persian dynasty, which waged successful war with the Romans, .defeated the Emperors Valerian and Julian, and carried the western frontier of the Persian Empire into the middle of Asia Minor, to Amid and Orhai. Its culminating point was the long reign of Khusraw Amisharwan (Nushirwan), known as 'the Just,' who reigned 47 years (531-578), during which period Yemen was conquered by the Persians and the Prophet Muhammad was born. Soon after his death signs of disintegration began to appear in the Sasanian Empire, which finally succumbed to the at tacks of the Arabs, invincible in their new-found faith of Islam, about the middle of the seventh centurv of the Christian era. With t^e fall of the Sasanian ^Empire fell the religion of Zoroaster, which is represented at the present day by a small remnant (some 9,000 souls) in Persia and by the Parsee community in India. (3) From the Aral) to the Monqol or Tartar Invasion (650-1258) 650-750.^—For a century after the Arab conquest, Persia was governed as a province of the Caliphate; and such in theory she remained until the overthrow of Baghdad and the extinction of the Caliphate by the Mongols in the middle of the thirteenth century. But with the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, and the transference of the metropolis of Islam from Damascus to Baghdad by the 'Abbasid Caliphs, about a.d . 750, the period of Arab ascendancy came to an end; and Persian influence began strongly to assert itself—espe cially during the Caliphate of Haraun al-Rashid's son al-Ma'mun ( a.d . 813-833), who was the son of a Per sian mother, the husband of a Persian wife, and who owed his triumph over his half-brother al-Amm chieflv to his Persian supporters. . 750-1258. During these five centuries Persia con tinued nominally a province of the Abbasid Caliphate,Persia] a.d. 650-1258 19 but from about the middle of the ninth century of our era there arose in succession a series of inaigenous dynasties, yielding a mere lip-service to the Caliph of Baghdad, whose position gradually became more titular than real, and who often wielded little more political power -than does the Pope in Europe at the present day. Finally, in the first half of the thirteenth century, the storm of the Tartar or Mongol invasion burst upon the lands of Islam, as well as upon southern Russia and Poland. In 1258 the invaders sacked Baghdad, massacred great numbers of the inhabitants, put to death the last 'Abbasid Caliph al-Musta'sim, and practically extinguished the Caliphate, though it was nominally continued in Egypt by a succession of scions of the House of 'Abbas, until finally, in 1517, the Ottoman Sultan Selim 'the Grim ' conquered Egypt, took from the last of these 'Abbasids the sacred in signia, and is supposed to have assumed the position and title of Caliph, to which the Ottoman Sultans have- since laid claim. (4) From the Mongol Invasion to Nadir Shah (1258-1736) 1258-1736.—From the Mongol invasion may be said to date the modern political divisions of Western Asia; and to it was directly due the rise of the Ottoman Empire, first in Asia Minor, and later in Europe and North Africa. The Mongols settled in Persia adopted Islam about 1300, and, thus cut off from their original home and stock, were gradually absorbed by the Persians. Within the next half century their power entirely de cayed, and several minor dynasties supplanted them, until a second great Turco-Tartar invasion, under Timiir (commonly known in the west as ' Tamerlane,' a corruption of Timur-i-Lang, or ' Limping Timur '), devastated Western Asia (including not only Persia and Asia Minor, but Syria, the Holy Land, Georgia, and [285—98] C 220 HISTORY [No. 80 Armenia) in the latter part of the fourteenth century. The vast Empire conquered by Timiir rapidly dwindled after his death until it was confined to Herat and tlie extreme north-east of Persia, the remainder of which fell under the dominion of two Turcoman dynasties known as the 'Black' and the 'White Sheep.' Babar, the fifth descendant of Tfmur, being driven out of his own land by the Uzbegs, succeeded in sub jugating first Afghanistan and then a great part of India, 1 where he founded the so-called 'Moghul'' dvnasty, which reached its culminating point in the glorious reign of Akbar (1556-1605), the contemporary of Queen Elizabeth, the Ottoman Sultan Sulayman 'the Magnificent,'' and Shah 'Abbas 'the Great' of Persia. The most glorious dynasty of modern Persia was that of the Safawi's, which was founded by Shah Isma'll in 1502, reached its culminating point in the long reign of his great-grandson 'Abbas I, called ' the Great ' (1587-1629), and was finally over thrown by the Afghans in 1722. Shah Isma'll and his successors were enthusiastic adherents of the Shi'a sect of Islam, which they made the State religion of Persia, a position it has ever since held. This brought them into violent collision with their Sunm neighbours, especially the Ottoman Turks, with whom they were constantly at war, with various fortune. In 1508 Shah Isma'fl succeeded in wresting Baghdad from the Turks, thus recovering at once the site of the old Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon, and those regions which, on account of their connection with 'AH and the Imams, are most holy in the eyes of the Shf'a; but six years later (1514) he suffered a decisive defeat at the hands of Sultan Selfm 'the Grim,' at Chal- diran. The religious antipathy which arose at this time between Persia and Furkey had very important political results, and invested Persia with a new and The decisive battle of Panipat, which gave Bdbar Delhi and Agra, was fought on April 20, 1520.Persia] A.D . 1258-1736 21 great consequence in European eyes. 1 The efficiency of the Persian army in the reign of Shah 'Abbas ' the Great' owed much to his English adviser, Sir Anthony Shirley. The collapse of the Safawi power before the Afghan invaders in 1722 was as rapid as its rise, but the Afghan dominion endured only some seven years, and, after seven years more of anarchy, Nadir, another great conqueror, proclaimed himself Shah of Persia. (5) From Nadir Shah to the accession of Ndsiru'd- Din Shah (1736-1848) In the course of eleven years (1736-1747) Nadir Shah not only possessed himself of the whole of Persia in its fullest extent, but added thereto Afghanistan and a considerable part of India, so that ' for a time the Persian empire extended from the Indus to the Cau casus.' 2 On his assassination, in 1747, another period of anarchy ensued, in which three rival houses, the Zand, the Qajar, and the Bakhtiari, contended for the supreme power. For nearly fifty years (1750- 1794) the Zand dynasty had the upper hand; and the first of these rulers, Karim Khan, who had his capital at Shiraz, where he reigned for nearly thirty years (1750-1779), though refusing to take the title of King (Shah), is generally held to have been the best, most enlightened, and most humane ruler that Persia has had in modern times. His successor, however, proved unequal to the task of government; and in 1795 the rival Qajars, represented by the hideous and cruel eunuch, Agha Muhammad Khan, finally crushed their rivals, and the family became, as they still remain, the 1 So much so that De Busbecq, the Emperor Ferdinand's Ambassador at the Court of Sulayman the Magnificent, wrote: ' Tis only the Persian stands between us and ruin.

The present King of Persia, Sultan Ahmad Shah, is the seventh in succession of this dynasty, whose reigns were as follows:-— (i) Aghd Muhammad Klid7i (1779-1797).—One of his chief exploits was the invasion of Georgia (which had transferred its allegiance from Persia to Russia in 1783) and the occupation of Tiflis in 1795; and it was only in the following year that he consented to be formally crowned at Teheran, which thenceforth became the capital. He was assassinated a year later. (ii) Fath- Ali Shah (1797-1834) succeeded^his uncle, and was crowned on July 29, 1797, at Teheran. The chief events of his reign were two unsuccessful wars with Russia, which resulted respectively in the Treaties of Gulistan (October 12, 1813) and Turkmanchay (February 21, 1828); and a war with the Ottoman Turks, in which the Persians obtained several notable victories over their enemies, and which resulted in the Treaty of Erzerum (July 28, 1823). British diplomacy was very active in Persia during this period, being chiefly engaged at first in endeavouring to counteract French influence and to thwart the am bitious schemes of Napoleon 1. A British mission headed by Captain Malcolm, the first English diplo matist who had been employed in Persia since the reign of Charles II, landed at Bushire in February 1800, proceeded to Teheran, and concluded a political and a commercial treaty, by which England under took, in return for certain privileges, to aid the Persians with money and munitions in the event of their being attacked either by the French or the Afghans. In May, 1806, a French representative, M. Jaubert, ailived at leheran, and was shortly afterwards followed by General Gardanne and seventy French officers, who set themselves to drill the Persian troops on the European model. To counteract French in fluence Geneial (afterwards Sir John) Malcolm was sent from India to the Persian Gulf, while an inde-© Persia] A.D. 1/36—1848 23 pendent mission, headed by Sir Harford Jones Brydges, proceeded direct to Teheran from London. 1 A lament able rivalry and jealousy existed between these two missions, of which the latter achieved the more notable results, which included the expulsion of General Gardanne and the promise of an annual sub sidy to the Shah to aid him in waging war against Russia. In 1810, a second mission, headed by General Malcolm, came to Persia from India, as a sequel to which a Persian mission under Hajji Mirza Abu'l Hasan Khan was despatched to London. In October 1812, the Persian army, commanded by the Crown Prince 'Abbas Mirza, suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the Russians on the Araxes; and a year later this war was brought to an end by the above-mentioned Treaty of Gulistan, by which Persia ceded to Russia Georgia, Derbend, Baku, Shirwan, Shaki, Ganja (Elisavetopol), Kara Dagh, Mughan, part of Talish, and whatever rights she may have possessed in Mingrelia and other parts of the Caucasus, besides renouncing all naval rights on the Caspian Sea. Russia, on the other hand, bound her self to secure the succession of the Crown Prince 'Abbas Mirza; a provision which, by giving Russia a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of Persia, was probably more disastrous than the exten sive surrender of territory above mentioned. In 1814, Mr. Morier, author of the celebrated Adventures of Hajji Baha of Ispahan, who had replaced Sir Gore Ouseley as British Minister at Teheran, in conjunction with Mr. Henry Ellis, who had been especially sent from England, concluded a revised tireaty, whereby Persia undertook to oppose the passage through her territories of any foreign army directed against India, while England promised a yearly subsidy of £200,000 to Persia in case of her being attacked by any European Power which might refuse the mediatory offices of Great Britain, pro- 1 See R. G. Watson's History of Persia, pp. 159-161.24 HISTORY [No. 80 vided Persia were not the aggressor. About the same time a splendidly equipped Russian mission, under .General Alexander Yermoloff, visited the Shah's capital, and sought to obtain his consent to the four following' important proposals: (1) that he should form an offensive alliance with Russia against Turkey; (2) that he should suffer a Russian army to pass through the provinces of Astarabad and Khorasan to attack the Khanate of Khiva; (3) that Russia should be allowed to maintain a commercial resident at Resht in Gilan, on the Caspian shore; (4) that Russia should supply officers to drill and train the Persian troops. To all these proposals (the second of which at least was incompatible with his undertakings to England) the Shah returned a firm refusal. Into the next war with Russia, in 1826, 'the Shah was practically forced by his people, headed by the Mullds, or so-called clergy, who were exasperated by the overbearing attitude assumed by the Russian representatives, and also by the accounts which reached them of the ill-treatment of Muhammadans in the Caucasus. In spite of some initial successes, the Persians were unable to hold their own against the increasing armies sent against them by Russia; in the autumn of 1827 the fall of Erivan was succeeded by that of Tabriz; and the ensuing negotiations, pro tracted from the middle of November, 1827 until February, 1B28, ended in the Treaty of Turkmanchay, which would have been even more unfavourable to Persia than 'w as actually the case but for the efforts of the British Envoy, Sir John Macdonald, and his col league, Mr. (afterwards Sir John) McNeill, in her favour. The British Government contributed 200,000 tumans towards the large indemnity exacted by Russia trom Persia, on condition that Russia should forth with evacuate Azarbaijan, and that Persia should agree to the revision of the clauses in a former treaty relating to financial support from England in case ofPersia] A.D. 1736—1848 25 her being involved in war with Russia. The pro visions of the important Treaty of Turkmanchay, which, in Mr. R. G. Watson's words, ' now form the basis of the intercourse between Persia and the nations of Europe,' are summarised by him in his excellent History of Persia. A year after the conclusion of this treaty there happened an event which, but for Russia's pre occupation with her war against Turkey, would have afforded her a better excuse than she had often had for adopting strong measures against Persia, to wit, the murder of the Russian envoy, M. Grebaiodoff, and some thirty-five members of his suite by a Persian mob (February 1829), in consequence of his seizure from the house of a Persian nobleman of two Armenian women who had embraced Islam. As it was, not only were the apologies of the special Persian envoy, Khus- raw Mirza, accepted, but the Tsar even remitted the amount of 500,000 tumans (£250,000) from the in demnity claimed under the Treaty of Turkmanchay, and immediately sent a new Minister, Prince Dolgo- rouky, to Persia. During the next three years the Crown Prince, 'Abbas Mirza, pacified Khorasan, broke the power of the Turcoman marauders, and captured Sarakhs. He was contemplating the subjugation of Herat and part of Afghanistan when death overtook him at the holy city of Meshed on October 21, 1833, at the comparatively early age of 46. 'He had,' says Watson, 1 'amongst one hundred and fifty-nine children, been ever the favourite of his father, and though he was fickle and easily worked upon and passionate, he was, notwithstanding, the noblest of the Qajar race.' The Shah was heart-broken at his death, not only because of the love he bore him, but because his astrologer had predicted that he would only survive his son by about a year; which prediction was in fact fulfilled, for Path-'All Shah expired on 1 R.

Fath-'AH was sixty-eight years ot age, and had ruled over Persia for thirty-seven years, it was during his reign that the missionary Henry Martyn visited Persia, and translated into Persian the New Testament and Psalms. 1 x , (iii) Muhammad Shah (1835-1848).— Immediately after bis father's death the new Shah's supremacy was threatened by two of his uncles, the Zillu's-bultan, and the Farman-farma (commander-m-chiet), who was Governor of Shiraz; but the moral support of Sn John Campbell and the military aid of Sir Henry Lindsay Bethune secured his accession at the cost of a triflinc effusion of blood. He was crowned at Teheran on January 31, 1835, and his rebellious uncles were captured and imprisoned at Ardabil. Soon after this the Russians demanded the establishment of a Russian Consulate at Resht, while Mr. Ellis was sent from England to endeavour to conclude a commercial treaty with Persia. Both Powers, however, were, for the time being, baulked of their aspirations. The Afghan question chiefly dominated the next fiYe years (1836-1841) of Muhammad Shah's reign. British policy in this respect had undergone a great change since'1800, 2 when a subsidy was promised to Persia to enable her to fight the Afghans, who were then regarded as a menace to India. Now the Shah, acting under considerable provocation, resolved to attack Herat, which he intended to add to his dominions. In this enterprise he was not only en couraged, but materially aided, by the Russians, especi ally by their asrents. Count Simonich and General Samson. The Shah, after one false start, appeared before Herat in November 1837, whither the British Envoy, Mr. John McNeill, followed him in the spring of 1838. Herat was gallantly defended by its inhabitants, 1 This version, which was unsatisfactory, has been superseded by that of Dr. Bruce, of Isfahan. 2 See above, p. 22.l\ te CrowD Pi years off seven years, I ssidary Her nto Persian t —Immediatel supremacy i aiJu's-Sultii i-chief), wfe upport of Sii f Sir Hem the cost of 2 ' at Teheran mcles were after this a Russian sent from cial treaty or tk time 1 the next lah's reign. ;one a great promised to lS) who were w the resolved t. add to to act only®- ;sians ,espe&amp; and Geneis irt, appear sr the Bnti ithesprin? 1 ts inhabit , been supers* p ersia] a.d. 1736-1848 27 aided by Lieutenant Eldred Pottinger; and Mr. John McNeill, being unable to turn the Shah from his pur pose, left him, and set out for Erzerum. Two months later (August 11. 1838), Colonel Stoddart arrived at Herat with an ultimatum from Great Britain, and the Shah yielded and raised the siege, which had already cost him dear. Three years elapsed, however, before the British Minister, Mr. John McNeill, returned to the Persian capital, after the Persian Government had at length accepted the nine demands put forward by Great Britain, which included the signature of a com mercial treaty. The rebellion of the Isma'i'li sect (the representatives of the celebrated Assassins of Alamut) in 1842 deserves notice, because it led to the establishment of their chieP, Agha Khan (father of the present Agha Khan), in India. The years 1842-43 saw the recurrence of very strained relations between Persia and Turkey, but in spite of the wanton massacre by the Turks of some 15,000 of the Persian Sln'ite inhabitants of Karbala, war was averted by the joint efforts of England and Russia, who, in this instance, showed a rare co-opera tion in benevolence. The rise of the Babi sect in 1844, which led to very serious disturbances in the next reign, and later to many interesting and important de velopments, was the principal internal event worthy of note. Muhammad Shah, who had all his life been a victim to gout, died on September 4, 1848. The formal interdiction of torture and of the importation of slaves from Africa were the most important of the few advances marked by his reign.

His long reign may conveniently be divided into three unequal periods, the tirst ot ten years (1848-58), the second of y ears (1858-89), and the third of seven years (1889-Jb). First Period (1848-58).—This troubled period in cluded the revolt in Khorasan in 1849; the Babi insur rections at Yezd, Zinjan, and Naynz, and the conse quent execution of the Bab at Tabriz in 1850; the ta and destruction of Mirza Taql Khan, the Amir-i- Kahir (who was by general consent the greatest, most clear-sighted, and most patriotic Persian statesman ot modern times), in January 1852; the attempt on the Shah's life by three Babis and the horrible persecution of the Babis resulting therefrom in August to September 1852; the intrigues by which Russia sought to involve Persia in the Crimean War ; the quarrel with the British Minister, the Hon. Charles Murray, which resulted in the rupture of diplomatic relations with Great Britain in 1855; the renewed Persian attack on Herat and the consequent Anglo-Persian War in 1856-7, resulting in the Treaty of Peace, signed at Paris on March 4, 1857; and the dismissal of Mirza Agha Khan, the Sadr-i-A 'zam, or Prime Minister, who had been the cause of much trouble, in 1858. Of these events the rise, growth, and struggles of the Babi sect were of the greatest significance and interest from the historical and philosophical point of view. Here, however, the struggle for influence between Eng land and Russia chiefly demands attention. In the autumn of 1853 a special Russian Envoy came to Teheran and had a private interview with the young Shah, from which even the Persian Prime Minister was excluded. The Russian Envoy's object was to persuade the Shah to join Russia in an attack on Turkey, in return for which she was to receive substantial advan tages, both financial and territorial. The Shah, dazzled by these proposals, was inclined to agree, and even made preparations for the invasion of Turkey, butPersia] THE LATER QAJARS 29 finally the Sadr-i-A'zam (Prime Minister) ^dissuaded^, him, and urged the opposite course ofjii^lliatice-witli England, France, and Turkey. Princis Dolgorouky was dismissed in consequence of his failuie; arfd Persia was, for the time being, saved from bei^g involved in war. The Anglo-Persian War, which laib^^only some four months (December 1856 to AprU^LlSS?), was caused by another effort on the part of Persia to take possession of Herat, which she captured on Nbv^mber 1, 1856. The British operations in Persia included the occupation of the island of Karak, and of Rishahr, Bushire, Mohammera, and Ahwaz. A battle was fought at Khushab (near Borasjun in Ears) in which the Persians lost 700 killed, and the British 16 killed and 62 wounded. A remarkable occurrence was the suicide, within the space of three days (March 14 to 17, 1857), of the British military and naval commanders at Bushire—General Stalker and Commodore Ettersey. Already, however, before the developments of the Mohammera offensive, a treaty of peace had been signed at Paris on March 4, 1857, on terms by no means harsh to Persia. Second Period (1858-89).—Eor more than thirty years after this Persia enjoyed a period of comparative peace and prosperity; and in the latter part of this period, at any rate, the degree of public security was very high, and the roads in most parts of the country siDgularly safe. The Shah was despotic, and, despite his European tours, reactionary in his aims and ideas; but his natural cruelty was kept in,check by his desire to stand well in European public opinion, and he was very sensitive to criticism in the European press, causing all references to himself to be translated for his benefit. The establishment of the Ddru'l-Funun (a college on more or less modern lines for young Per sians of good family) brought to Teheran a number of European instructors of various nationalities, as did sundry experiments in the organization of the Persian army. In these latter Austrians and Poles pre dominated until about 1882, when the formation of the30 HISTORY [No. 80 notorious Cossack Brigade gave Russia a predomi- nanCe ' . i • n u During this period the Bushire-Karachi cables, the Jask-Guadar, Bushire-Baghdad, and Russia-Teheran telegraph lines were laid i 1 two steamers were procured —though not used—to form the nucleus of a small Persian naval flotilla in the Persian Gulf; and a small local railway was opened at Teheran. Third Period (1889-96).—This final period was characterised by a series of disastrous concessions which greatly crippled and weakened Persia, and directly conduced to the assassination of the Shah. The first of these dealt with mines and banking, and was granted to Baron Julius de Renter in January 1889. This was immediately followed by the railway con cession to Russia, the Lottery Concession (the with drawal of which without compensation was very damaging to Persian credit on the Stock Exchange), the establishment of the (British) Imperial Bank of Persia, and last, but not least, the Tobacco Conces sion, 2 granted on March 8, 1890, to a British syndicate. 'De concession en concession,' wrote Dr. Feuvrier in his illuminating work, Trois Ans a la Cour de Perse, &lt;£ la Perse sera bientot tout entiere entre les mains des etrangers.' Few people have rendered a more ready and patient loyalty to their Kings than the Persians, but even their patience has its limits, and when they saw the national resources thus recklessly pledged to foreigners for comparatively trivial sums of ready money, they gave free expression to their resent ment. The Mullds guided and expressed the popular anger, and forbade the consumption of tobacco until the obnoxious concession was rescinded; and formidable riots occurred in various towns, especially at Teheran and Tabriz. Finally, in January 1892, the Shah gave way, and the concession was withdrawn; but heavy compensation (£500,000) was demanded and obtained by the concessionnaires, and this sum was borrowed at 1 See p. 73. 2 See p. 35.Persia] THE LATER QAJARS 31 6 per cent, interest from the Imperial Bank of Persia. Thus, for the first time, Persia found herself bur dened with the national debt to which so many of her later troubles were due. The assassination of Nasiru'd-Din Shah four years later (May 1, 1896) was another outcome of the same ill-advised concession. Amid these misguided actions, however, one conces sion, issued in 1895, was of great value—the grant to the French Government of the right of exploring ancient sites. This resulted, in 1897, in the mission under M. J. de Morgan, who had already made in vestigations in Persia in 1889-91. M. and Mme. Dieu- lafoy also made important excavations at Susa. 1 During this period Persia had yielded up territory. The district of Firuzeh and lands in its neighbourhood, on the borders of Russian Turkestan, were ceded to Russia. (v) Muzaffaru'd-Din Shah (1896-1907) was a more amiable but weaker ruler than his father. Of feeble health and vacillating character, averse to the shedding of blood and the refusal of favours, he suffered extra vagance to prevail, power to pass into the hands of his Ministers and nobles, and disorder and discontent to increase, together with the opportunities for their expression. The depreciation in the value of the copper coinage and the high price of meat were prac tical subjects of discontent. The successful opposi tion to the Tobacco Concession had revealed to the hitherto despised proletariat their power; and the Russian revolution which followed the war with Japan had also its reaction in Persia. The oppression and arbitrary exactions of Prince 'Aynu'd-Dawla ulti mately led to what is known as the ' First Bast ' of 1 The results of this mission and M. de Morgan's previous work were published in five handsome volumes, profusely illustrated, by Leroux, of Paris (1897-1904). Of these, the first and second deal with Geography, the third with Geology, the fourth with Archaeo logy, and the fifth with Linguistics. M. Marcel Dieulafoy's L'Acropole de Susa was published in 1890.32 HISTORY [No. 80 December 1905, a sort of general strike of the clergy, merchants and tradesmen, which was only terminated by the Shah promising certain constitutional reforms, including the establishment of a ' House of Justice {'Addlat-khdna). Thereupon matters resumed their normal course, but, as the Shah, in spite of reminders and petitions, took no steps to fulfil his promises, a more formidable protest of the same character took place in the summer of 1906, when, with the consent of the British Charge d'Affaires (Mr. Grant Duff), some twelve or fifteen thousand Persians of all classes took refuge in the grounds of the British Legation and refused to come out until the Shah gave adequate guar antees that he would not only fulfil his previous pro mises, but would grant a Constitution and a National Assembly (Majlis-i-MilU) on lines especially deter mined. The elections were speedily carried out, and the first Majlis met on October 7, 1906. Its first business was the drafting of the Constitution and Fundamental Law, which, after several attempted evasions, were signed by the Crown Prince, Muhammad 'All, on December 30, 1906, and by the dying Muzaf- faru'd-Dm Shah on January 1, 1907. (vi) Muhammad 'Ali Shah (1907-1909) was an Oriental despot of the worst type, greedy of power, cruel, and totally indifferent to the welfare of his country and people. His brief reign, crowded with events of the utmost moment to Persia, falls naturally into two periods, his struggle with the new Constitu tion and Parliament, culminating in the coup d'etat of June 23, 1908; and the last year of his reign, known to the Persians as 'the Lesser' Autocracy' (Istihddd-i- Saghir). His two and a half years' reign included three summers, each of which marked an epoch in the history of Persia. On August 31, 1907, the Anglo- Russian Agreement was signed; and, by a strange coin-, cidence, the Aminu's-Sultdn (or Atdhak-i-A'zam), who was so largely responsible for the granting of con cessions and the increasing of Russian influence, wasPersia] THE LATER Q A JARS 33 assassinated on the same day, as he was leaving the Majlis. On June 23, 1908, the Shah, aided by Colonel Liakhoff and his Cossacks, bombarded the Majlis, killed or imprisoned a number of Deputies, abolished the Constitution, and re-established a despotic form of government. Finally a year later (July 1909) the combined forces of the Nationalists and the Bakhtiaris, one advancing eastwards from Resht and the other northwards from Isfahan, captured Teheran, after desultory fighting lasting several days (July 6-14). Two days later Muhammad 'All abdicated. The triumph of the Constitutionalists was complete; their behaviour in the hour of victory was universally admitted to be admirable; and the price paid was small, the casualties during the five days' fighting in Teheran not exceeding five hundred. (vii) Sultan Ahmad Shah (who succeeded his father on July 18, 1909, and is still reigning) was a mere boy of twelve or thereabouts when he was acclaimed King of^ Persia. The aged 'Azudu'l-Mulk, head of the Qajar tribe, acted as Regent until his death, aged Muzaf- 64 ' 0 , n September 22, 1910. He was succeeded by Mirza Abu'l-Qasim, Ndsiru'l-Mulk, who returned to Persia from Europe on February 8, 1911, and held the posi tion of Regent until the young Shah attained the age at which he was deemed competent to rule in person. Pending the convocation of the new (second) Majlis, which was formally opened on November 15, 1909, the affairs of the State were conducted by a National Council. The actual coronation of the young Shah took place on July 21, 1914, only a few days before the outbreak of the European War.' Even then he was only seventeen years of age, and it does not appear that either before or after his coronation his personality greatly influenced the course of events, which was mainly determined on the one hand by the varying resultant of ostensibly similar but essentially divergent Anglo-Russian aims, and, on the other, by the resist ance of the Persian National or Constitutional Party (which predominated in the second Majlis) to any [285—98] d34 HISTORY [No. 80 attempt to weaken or destroy Persian autonomy and independence. This resistance was finally overcome by the violent measures adopted by Russia at the end of 1911, beginning with the first ultimatum of November 5 and the second ultimatum of November 23, and culminating in the forcible closure of the Majlis on December 24, the executions and ' punitive measures ' ruthlessly carried out at Tabriz and else where in north-west Persia by the Russians and their chosen myrmidon Samad Khan Shujd'u d-Dawla, and the bombardment of the Holy Shrine at Meshed on March 29, 1912. (B) The Constitutional or National Movement (1906 onwards) Although, as already mentioned, Persia was formally granted a Constitution by the dying Muzaffaru'd-Dm Shah on New Year's Day, 1907, the movement which finally extorted from him this concession began some fifteen or sixteen years earlier. In 1888 there were no visible signs of such a tendency, even amongst the more thoughtful classes, whose intellectual interests appeared then, as in previous ages, to be chiefly concentrated on religious, philosophical and literary questions. Few peoples have shown themselves throughout their history more tolerant of autocratic rule, more sceptical as regards political progress, or more loyal to such Kings as embodied the national sen timents and aspirations (Shdh-parast, 'King-adorers,' as they phrase it) than the Persians. Their persis tent, strenuous, and, finally, successful demands for a Constitution, which first attracted general attention in Europe about the end of 1905 or beginning of 1906, came as a complete surprise even to those who had been familiar A\ith the country and people a few years earlier; and only a few of tlie more observant Europeans resident m the Persian capital at first realised' the importance and significance of the new movement. To this movement several causes had conduced, but t e principal one was probably the increasing alarmPersia] NATIONAL MOVEMENT 35 and indignation aroused by the reckless granting of concessions of the most far-reaching character to foreigners, which began in 1889 in the later days of Nasiru'd-Dm Shah, and was continued and increased by his son and successor Muzaffaru'd-Dm. The Persians were accustomed to be fleeced by their rulers; and, so long as those rulers fairly maintained the prestige of Persia abroad and avoided interfering with certain cherished ideas and customs at home, the accustomed burden was on the whole patiently borne. Now, however, they saw the nation's resources pledged wholesale to foreigners in return for relatively insigni ficant sums of ready money, which were forthwith squandered by the King and his courtiers in unprofit able tours through Europe, while Persia, whose alliance had been eagerly sought by powerful European States even a century ago, was constantly reminded of her waning prestige in ways most galling to the national pride. Of these concessions the most notable wa^ the above- mentioned Tobacco Concession. Neither the Shah nor the concessionnaires had reckoned with the determined opposition of the Persian people, which manifested itself partly by actual disturbances, but more quietly and powerfully by a complete boycott of the use of tobacco until the concession (thus rendered worthless) was withdrawn, after a year's struggle, on the first day of 1892. In this struggle the Mullds took a very pro minent part as leaders of the popular protest—a part which they played with even greater success fifteen years later in the Constitutional Movement. That the assassination of Nasiru'd-Dm Shah on May 1, 1896, was one, though not the most important, of the con sequences of the Tobacco Concession clearly appears from the cross-examination of the assassin, Mirza Rizd of Kirman. 1 Another more serious consequence was the genesis of the Persian National Debt, which has so terribly impeded Persia in the struggle to preserve her 1 A complete translation of this curious document will be found on pp. 63-92 of E. G. Browne's Persian Revolution. [285—98] ]) 236 HISTORY [No. 80 independence. The Persian Government was obliged to pay half a million pounds sterling as compensation to the Tobacco Company; and this sum they had to borrow at 6 per cent,, from the Imperial Bank of Persia. Later, in 1900, when Muzaffaru'd-Dm Shah wanted to borrow two^ and a half millions of pounds for the expenses of his projected European tour, he was obliged to have recourse to Russia, from whom two years later he borrowed another million. Naturally, in each case, he had to give fresh mortgages to^ his formid able creditor on the resources of his country, whose financial position in the ten years 1892-1902 had changed enormously for the worse. Had the revolu tion of 1905-6 come fourteen or fifteen years earlier, the results, in all human probability, would have been very different. Into the details of this revolution it is neither pos sible nor necessary to enter here, but what is important to notice is that the partial success of January 1906 would hardly have led to the complete triumph of August 1906, but for the benevolent intervention of the British Legation. The first important act of the new Majlis, which was opened on October 7, 1906, was to inhibit the pro posed Anglo-Russian loan of £400,000, which was then under discussion; and it then proceeded to draft the Electoral Law and the Eundamental Law, which, after much procrastination, were ultimately signed by the Crown Prince on December 30, 1906, and by the Shah on January 1, 1917. Five days later Muzaffaru'd-Dm &lt; a i' and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad A i, who soon showed himself in his true colours as an unsci upulous i eactionary, to whom the welfare of his country and people was a matter of complete indiffer ence. His brief reign was one prolonged struggle with his people, to crush whom he was ever ready to invoke e ie p o e then reactionary and anti-democratic overnmen of Russia, and their still more reactionarv local agents. In spite of this, the Majlis, notwith standing its inexperience and the difficulties withPersia] NATIONAL MOVEMENT 37 which it had to contend, soon showed that it was a power to be reckoned with, and succeeded in compelling the resignation of M. Naus, the unpopular Belgian chief of the Customs. The general tone of the popular party was confident and buoyant until, in the late summer of 1907, coniidence was changed to consterna tion by the news of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of August 31. Anglo-Russian antagonism had for the best part of a century been the dominant factor in Persian (and indeed in Asiatic) politics; and so early as 1812 British officers had fought on the .side of Persia against Russian troops. 1 The Persians, therefore, had come to reckon on English sympathy and support against their much-feared northern neighbour; they had had many proofs in the past of England's goodwill; they did not suspect her of any aggressive designs similar to those entertained by Russia, and they had a high esteem for the English character. England, therefore, had generally enjoyed a greater popularity than any other European power in Persia; and this popularity reached its zenith in 1906 in consequence of the effective support given to the popular movement by the British Legation. Much alarm was, however, caused by the Anglo- Russian Agreement; and the late Sir Cecil Spring- Rice, who was at that time British Minister at Teheran, deemed it expedient to send a reassuring Memorandum to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which re pudiated in the most explicit manner any aggressive designs or desire to interfere in Persian affairs, guaranteed the 'independence and integrity' of Persia, and concluded by declaring that England and Russia not only do not seek a pretext for intervention, but their aim in these friendly negotiations is not to permit one another to intervene in Persia on the pretext of safeguarding their own interests. 1 Captain Christie was one of the victims of the disastrous battle of Uslanduz on Oct. 31 of that year.38 HISTORY [No. 80 The text of this document was at once published (September 14, 1907) in the Persian Press, but it was not published in England until January 1909. 1 Its importance lies in the fact that it represents the most magnanimous interpretation of the much discussed ' spirit ' of the Anglo-Russian Agreement. 2 Quite different was the view of the Agreement taken by the Russian Government, which from the first seems to have had in view an effective partition of Persia. How far Colonel Liakhoff, the commanding officer of the Cossack Brigade (a force consisting of Persians officered by Russians), acted under instruc tions from his Government, or of the Viceroy of the Caucasus, when he bombarded the Majlis on June 23, 1908, and re-established the Shah's autocratic rule, cannot easily be verified; but it is certain that the Russian Legation at least in no way disapproved of his action. A year later, on July 13, 1909, when he entirely failed to make good his boasts as to his ability to hold in check the Nationalist forces advancing from the west and south upon Teheran, to whom he was finally obliged to surrender, he was speedily recalled to Russia. 3 As the result of this triumph of the Nationalist armies, Muhammad 'All Shah was compelled to abdicate in favour of his twelve-year-old son Sultan Ahmad (the present Shah); the constitution was restored; and the second Majlis, or Parliament, elected as. speedily as possible, assembled on November 15, 1909. The victorious Nationalists behaved with a self-control and moderation which won warm praises even from those who had not hitherto regarded them with much sympathy or favour; the Russians sent (September 24) a new and more sympathetic Minister, M. Poklevski Koziell, to replace 'the much-mistrusted 1 In ^ Brief Narrative of Recent Events in Persia by E G Browne, pp. 28-30. &gt; j ■ • ^ ful1 translation of the Memorandum (which was originally written m 1 ersian) will be found in the Appendix, p. 127 He left Teheran on Aug. 4, 1909NATIONAL MOVEMENT 39 M. de Hartwig, and announced the withdrawal of 1,000 soldiers from Tabriz (October 16) and the reduc tion of the Kazvin garrison, which had been raised in July to 2,300 men, to 50 men (November 1); in short, at no period did the omens for Persia appear more favourable. Unfortunately clouds soon began to appear on the horizon. The question of the ex-Shah's pension involved the expenditure of much time and argument, and was not finally settled until September 7, 1909, when the Persian Government finally consented to pay him 100,000 tumans (£16,666) a year; while the representatives of -Russia and Great Britain on their part gave the following guarantee regarding the restraint of the ex-Shah from further intrigues 1 :— Art. 11. —The two representatives undertake to give His Majesty Muhammad Ali Mirza 2 strict injunctions to abstain in future from all political agitation against Persia, and the Im perial Russian Government promise on their side to take all effective steps in order to prevent any such agitation on his part. If His Majesty Muhammad Ali Mirza leaves Eussia, and if it is proved to the satisfaction of the two Legations that in any country other than Russia he has carried on political agitation against Persia, the Persian Government shall have the right to cease payment of his pension. Rather more than a year later (on October 29, 1910) the Persian Government informed the two Legations that they had evidence that the ex-Shah was intriguing with the Turcomans with a view to an invasion of Persia, and that, therefore, in accordance with the Article cited above, they proposed to stop his pension. This proposal was, however, not accepted, and two months later the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs (the Nawwab Mirza Husayn-quli Khan), under Russian pressure, was obliged to resign. No sooner was the ex-Shah's pension paid than it transpired 1 See Blue Book [Cd. 5120], pp. 130-131, Article ii. of the Protocol (Inclosure in No. 232). 2 Referred to above as Muhammad 'AH Shdh. After his abdi cation he naturally lost the title of 8hdh (King), and resumed that of Mirzd (Prince).40 HISTORY [No. 80 that ho had left Odessa for Vienna, whence he subsequently visited Brussels, Berlin, Rome, Milan, Nice and Paris. In July 1911, having passed through Russia with some of his followers in disguise and under a false name, carrying with him arms and ammunition labelled ''Mineral Waters,'' he crossed the Caspian Sea in a Russian ship, entered Persian territory, assembled his supporters, and sent an army, commanded by Arshadu d-Uawla, to move on Teheran. It was, however, successively defeated on August 12, 22 and 31, 1911, at Firuzkuh, Sawad-Kuh and Demavend, by the Constitutional forces under Yeprem Khan the Armenian; and Arshadu-d-Dawla was taken prisoner and shot (September 5—6, 1911). Thence forth the ex-Shah, whose restoration the British Government absolutely declined to consider, ceased to reckon as a factor in Persian affairs. It would be tedious to describe in detail the numerous difficulties raised by the Russian Govern ment to embarrass the Persians; but especial reference may be made to the cases of Rahim Khan (October 19. 1909—January 24, 1910), who raided Ardabil, and^ being finally defeated, escaped into Russian territory; of Darab Mirza, a Persian prince w T ho held a com mission in a Russian Cossack regiment, and who made an unprovoked and also unsuccessful attack upon Zmjan (May-June 1910); and of Rashidu'l-Mulk, a notorious reactionary, who was forcibly released from the prison in Tabriz, where he was confined on a charge of treason, by the Russian Consul-General on July 28, 1911. The case of Ralum Khan offers a certain interest, because the Persian Government, when asking for his extradition from Russia, whither he had fled on his defeat, appealed (but without success) to Article xiv of 7- Tm'kmanchay (concluded in 1828). Difficulties of another class wherewith the Persian fin 0 nn^p men Tl 1 Wa M Were with iinance. The National Debt, which came into existence m 1892.- had grown steadily since da£ 1 See above, pp. 31, 35.8 Persia] NATIONAL MOVEMENT 41 * and, though still relatively small, had involved the mortgaging to Russia and England of several important sources of revenue, such as the Customs; tliis in turn had to a certain extent introduced foreign (notably Belgian) control. Measures were taken by the new Persian Government to diminish expenditure, increase revenue, and put the finances of the country on a sounder basis; and to raise such loans as were meanwhile urgently required without further pledging Persia's natural resources to foreign Powers, or giving fresh opportunities for external political intervention. Various attempts were made in this direction by way of internal loans (May, 1910), external loans from private firms or syndicates (May- October, 1910), and the pledging of the Crown jewels, valued, it was said, at £750,000 (March-October, 1910). All of these plans, however, were brought to naught, chiefly by Russia's action, which aimed throughout at compelling Persia to borrow money only from her and from Great Britain, and only at the price of fresh concessions incompatible with Persian independence. 1 The most urgent need of the Persian Government was now, as recognised by their most enlightened statesmen, for disinterested foreign advisers and officers to help them in organising their finance and the new Treasury gendarmerie, essential for collecting the revenues and maintaining order; and in January, 1911, after several vain applications to other Powers, America consented to supply the former and Sweden the latter. Mr, W. Morgan Shuster and the other financial advisers lent by the United States landed in Persia on May 11, 1911, and at once set to work with energy on their task. After a brief examination of the state of affairs Mr. Shuster informed the Persian Government that he could do little for them unless he 1 Thus the Anglo-Russian Loan of £400,000, proposed on Feb ruary 10, 1010, was rejected on this ground on April 10 of the same year.42 HISTORY [No. 80 were invested with extraordinary powers, which he specified; and these were unhesitatingly and unani mously accorded to him by the Majlis on June 13, 1911. On July 9, 1911, he ottered the command of the new Treasury gendarmerie to Captain C. B. Stokes, whose appointment as Military Attache to the British Lega tion was on the point of expiring. Russia objected to this and to two other appointments made at the same time, and, through the Novoe Vremya 1 and other reactionary newspapers, expressed surprise at 'the apparent helplessness '' of the British Foreign Office •to deal with ' Stokes and Co.' as it wished, while the Times 2 took the view that ' neither the British nor the Indian Government has any power to prevent Captain Stokes accepting the appointment.' However, on August 21, 1911, the British Foreign Office informed the Persian Legation that Captain Stokes's resigna tion from the Indian Army would not be accepted, and that consequently he would be precluded from accept ing the post offered him. The exertions of the Russian Government to get rid of Mr. Shuster and his colleagues were now redoubled, and finally, on October 9, 1911, an attempt was made by the Russian Consul Pokhitanoff to provoke an ' incident ' in connection with the confiscation of some property of Prince Shu a'u's-Saltana, w^ho had joined the ex-Shah in his abortive attempt to regain the throne. Into the details of the events that followed it is unnecessary to enter here. 3 Suffice it to say that on October 17, 1911, the Russian Government definitely refused to allow Captain Stokes's appointment, and that on November 11, 1911, he was ordered by the 1 Of July 31 and Aug. 7-12, 1911. a Of Aug. 4, 1911. ^un tS T ?

This second ultimatum the Majlis rejected on the following day. The bazaars were closed, and great excitement prevailed in Teheran, the people crying 'Death or independence!' {Mary yd Istiqldll). So far as the people of Tabriz and Resht were concerned, it was death, for, though the Persian Government, realising its impotence, submitted to the Russian demands on December 23, 1911, fierce fighting had already broken out in both these towns between the Russian troops and the Persian volunteers. All re sistance, however, was overcome in a week or ten days; and in both places, but especially in Tabriz, terrible reprisals were carried out by the Russians. On New Year's Day, 1912, they publicly hanged eight leading citizens of Tabriz, including the chief ecclesiastical authority of the city, Thiqatu'l-Islam, the day of the execution corresponding to the 'Ashiira, or lOth of Muharram, the most solemn religious anniversary of the Persians. This execution was followed by others, the houses of the victims as well as several public buildings being blown up with dynamite; and the Russians then installed as a Governor the notorious •reactionary Samad Khan Shuja/u'd-Dawla, 1 who for several months maintained a reign of terror characterised by the most shocking barbarities.

Thus ended, for the time being, the Persian Con stitutional or National movement. The European War only brought fresh misfortunes; and almost the whole of Western Persia became the battlefield of Russian and Turkish troops, revolted gendarmerie, and insur gent tribes. Towns were besieged, bombarded, or burned, crops destroyed, food commandeered, and many people slain, while commerce was ruined and famine threatened the land. Since the outbreak of war it has been very difficult to obtain full and accurate informa tion as to the state of affairs in Persia, but certain salient phenomena connected therewith may be men tioned. (C) Persia immediately before and during the European War (1) From 1912 to August 1914 It would hardly be possible to imagine a more miser able plight than that in which Persia has found her self during the last seven years (1912-1918), a period divided into two unequal parts by the outbreak of the European War, from which, though a neutral, she suf fered almost as much as Belgium, Russia, as has been pointed out, not only seized every pretext for political, military, commercial and economic intervention, but was constantly creating fresh pretexts. Great Britain, on the other hand, was anxious to avoid new and incalculable commitments, and contented herself for t e most part with encouraging, and to a large extent nnancmg, the newly-formed gendarmerie officered by Swedes, and endeavouring to secure the bestowal of e c lei governments in the south on governors accounted strong and reputed Anglophile. Unfortunateiy not only the majority'of the chief ci les o eisia, but the capital, Teheran, whence allPersia] PERSIA, 1912-1914 45 initiative had been wont to emanate, lay in the northern, or so-called ''Russian,' sphere; and the paralysis of the Central Government inevitably led to increasing disorder in the southern provinces, until a state little short of anarchy was widely prevalent. Moreover, the British representatives at Teheran became associated in the Persian mind with the distrust felt towards Russia. It was owing to this fact that, on the outbreak of war, German propaganda found so much more favourable a soil in Persia than in Afghan istan, which had been treated in the Convention with much greater consideration (see p. 126). Whatever may be thought of the capacity of the Persians for self-government, it is quite certain that in the actual circumstances effective government of any sort had been rendered impossible. The Shah was a mere boy, whose coronation, at the early age of seven teen, only took place a few days before the outbreak of war (July 21, 1914). The Regent, M irzd Ahu'l-Qdsim, Ndsiru'l-Mulk, was absent from Persia from June 1912 to September 1913, and left the country again a few weeks after the coronation. The National Assembly was in suspense from December 1911 until December 1914, when the third Majlis was opened and the Shah in his speech from the throne declared the neutrality of Persia. There were constant changes of Cabinets, for no Cabinet could exist without Russia's approval, and no Cabinet approved by Russia could command the confidence or support of the Persians. Besides all this, the Treasury was empty; no loan could be contracted except from Russia or with Russia's sanction; and to each of the doles so obtained some disastrous or humiliating condition was attached'—now a fresh increase in the hated Cos sack Brigade, now a new railway or mineral conces sion, now the disarmament of the remaining National Volunteers (MujdMdin). Russian troops continued to occupy Tabriz, Kazvin, Resht, Meshed, and other cities in the north, while the rich and extensive pro vince of Azarbaijan, autocratically governed by a46 HISTORY [No. 80 Russian nominee, the infamous Samad Khan ShujaVd- Dawla, was practically outside Persian jurisdiction, so that even the Belgian Treasury officials were not allowed by the Russians, who had originally introduced them into Persia, to collect the taxes. The ex-Shah con tinued to move freely about Europe and to threaten fresh raids, 3 while serious raids were actually made by his madcap brother, Salaru'd-Dawla. 2 Sa'du'd-Dawla, one of the worst types of Persian statesmen, corrupt, reactionary, and unpatriotic, was invited by Russia (Great Britain acquiescing) to return to Persia at the end of October 1912, with a view to his being made Prime Minister or even Regent; but such was his un popularity with his countrymen that he could not even form a Cabinet (November 26, 1912), and was finally abandoned by Russia and Great Britain (January 1913). In January 1914 Russia encouraged the immi gration into Northern Persia of large numbers of her subjects from Transcaspia, and about the same time endeavoured to put a stop to the transmission of non- Russian goods by parcel post into Persia, but in this matter yielded to the protests of British and other merchants. In pursuance of a railway concession obtained in lebruary 1913 she also began to construct a hue from her frontier at Julfa, on the Araxes, to labriz, which was finally completed in June 1916. On several occasions she showed an unmistakable ten dency to extend her activities beyond her own sphere, and to resent any similar action on the part of Great Britain. 3 That Russia would have welcomed a complete partition of Persia, including the ' neutral sphere, is not to be doubted; and by May 1914 a section of English opinion, supported by the ' Times ' demanded the revision of the Agreement. 1 Such a raid was seriously expected so lately as April 1914 m*~'vttasr -r south-west Persia in May-June IS)!.? er8 ' m 0,1 OOIlceS810n 100 Persia] PERSIA, 1912-1914 47 Great Britain, on the other hand, showed, until 1916, a marked disinclination to take any action in Southern Persia, especially in the 'neutral sphere,' where the disorder was greatest; and the small bodies of Indian troops sent to Isfahan (in 1912) and Shiraz were soon withdrawn. While Russia was con tinually pressing for an increase of the notorious ' Cossack Brigade,' consisting of Persian troops officered by Russians, and endeavouring to make it the only military force in Northern Persia, England favoured the formation of a Treasury gendarmerie, like that conceived by Mr. Morgan Shuster in 1911, officered by Swedes. A training school for this force was established in Shiraz in April 1912, and another at Teheran two months later. This force, always cramped by the Russians, and financed (so far as it was financed at all) by doles from the British Govern ment, had a somewhat varied career. It had some successes, but sulfered several severe reverses— e.g., in August 1912, on the Shiraz-Bushire road, at the hands of Salaru'd-Dawla and his tribesmen, and in Novem ber 1913, at Kazarun, when the commanding officer was killed. At the latter place the reinforcements which subsequently arrived and recaptured the place appear to have behaved disgracefully, and indulged in looting without restraint. The Swedish officers seem to have done their best, but they lacked tact and exas perated the people; while their followers revived some of the most barbarous methods of the old regime, such as walling-up highway robbers alive in mortar, methods which had been obsolete in Persia for more than half a century. In April 1914 Colonel Hjal- marson left the country, and when the war broke out most of the regular Swedish officers had left Persia. 1 Those who remained developed strong pro-German or anti-Russian sentiments, and willingly co-operated with the German agents who penetrated into Persia. 1 All those who were on the active list were finally recalled by the Swedish Government in January 1915.48 HISTORY [No, 80 Other important matters which fell within this period, but which are necessarily omitted here, from considerations of space, are the visit of M. Sazonoff the Kussian Minister for Foreign Affairs, to England (beptember SO—October 2, 1912), partly, at any rate m connection with the Persian Question; the mooting ot the irans-Persian Railway scheme (1912); and the Anglo-Persian Oil enterprise (summer of 1914), owing to which the south-west portion of the 'neutral spliere began to suggest new problems to the British Government.

Towards the end of this month Kum and Hamadan were attacked by the Germans and Turks, and the British and Russian Consuls were obliged to flee to Teheran; but in December the tide turned, and the Russians successively occupied Hamadan, Kum, and Kashan. Towards the end of February 1916 the Russians occupied Kirmanshah, and two weeks later Karind, close to the Turco-Persian frontier. On March 11 the Turks and Germans evacuated Isfahan, which was occupied by the Russians on the 20th. On April 19 Schiinemann and other leading supporters of German aims were captured. In May the Russians occupied Kasr-i-Shirin, and defeated a force of 200 Bakhtiaris near Dizful. In June Brigadier-General Sir Percy Molesworth Sykes and his column of Anglo-Indian troops entered Kirman, and proceeded to form the 'South Persian Rifles ' to take the place of the dis banded and derelict Swedish gendarmerie. In June Major O'Connor, the British Consul at Shiraz, who had been carried ofl in the previous November and held in captivity by Tangistani tribesmen, instigated bv Germans (desiring to retaliate for the arrest of Herr Wassmuss, their Consul at Bushire and one of their most active and resourceful agents), was released in exchange for certain Tan^istani chiefs captured by the British. At the time of his capture numerous letters and confidential papers in the Consulate were seized and passed into German hands; and a selection of them was published at Berlin in facsimile, with translations and notes and an introduction, under the title of Englische Dokumente zur Erdrosselung Persiens (Berlin; Verlag 'der neue Orient,' 1917)/ In August 1916 the Turks reoccupied Hamadan, but were repulsed at Sultanabad in November. In March 1917 Kirmanshah was again occupied by the Russians, who a few davs later drove the Turks out of Bisutun and Kasr-i-Shirin, and on April 12 effected [285-98] E50 HISTORY [No. 80 a junction with the British forces at Kizil Ribat. But now the ferment of the Kussian Revolution had begun to work, and by August the Russian troops in Persia were reported to have 'lost all discipline.' By the Ireaty of Brest-Litovsk (Article 10) it was agreed that Persia should be evacuated alike by Russian and turkish troops; and early in 1918 the Russian forces commanded by General Baratoff had degenerated into a rapidly disintegrating horde of disbanded and de moralised soldiers, who, plundering as they went, and finally selhng their arms and accoutrements for food made their way homewards in irregular bands, many PYcZnt th perlshed on , wa y- The west of Persia, nwil, 5 1)r ° v | n 5 e of Khuzistan, was by this time com- pletely devastated and stricken by famine for flip Russians had pulled down all the vniagS fey passed cat^eTlLt wer^fff^T 16 Turks had driven off a11 the cattle that were left.

Many of the old Democratic Party who threw in their lot with her, however misguided they may have been, undoubtedly believed that the only hope for Persia lay in the destruction of Russian power, and were, in fact, not so much pro-German as anti-Russian. This belief was certainly strengthened by the an nouncement made to the Duma by M. Trepoff on December 5, 1916, as to the Allies' promises to Russia. (D) Relations of Persia with other States In 1908 the Persian Government authorised the Mu'tamanu , l-Mulk to publish a very useful Recueil des Traites de V Empire persan avec les Pays Strangers, containing the texts of 63 treaties and agreements concluded with 23 foreign States. The text is in every case given in Persian and another language (English, French, Russian or Turkish). Many of the treaties are, of course, of very little importance, being con cluded with remote countries {e.g., the Argentine, Brazil, Chili, Mexico and Uruguay, all in the years 1902-3), and being of a quite vague and general charac ter {Traites de Commerce, Arbitrage et Navigation), while less than one-third are antecedent to the year 1862. Abrogated treaties are not included, so that, for example, the important Treaty of Gulistan, con cluded between Persia and Russia on October 12, 1813, is omitted because it is explicitly abrogated by Article ii of the Treaty of Turkinanchay, signed on February 21, 1828. With only three foreign States are more than two treaties or conventions given, these being, as would naturally be expected, England (12), Russia (14), and Turkey (14). The three most ancient are with Turkey (1639, 1716 and 1823), the next two with Russia (1828, 1844), and the sixth with Spain (1842). Next in order of antiquity come France (1855), America (1856), and England, Austria-Hungary, Bel gium, Denmark, Holland, Norway and Sweden (all in 1857). Of the seven last mentioned the Treaty of [285—98] E 2w a 52 HISTORY [Nc. 80 1 eace between Great Britain and Persia signed in ans on March 4, 1857, with ratifications exchanged at Baghdad on May 2, 1857, is the only important one; but the Persian plenipotentiary, Mirza Farrukh Khan Ammu 1 Mulk, 1 profited by his sojourn in Paris to conclude the other six treaties of that year, all of which were signed m the French capital between May and November except the treaty with Belgium, which was signed at Brussels.

There is an additional clause dealing further with frontiers, certain religious ques tions, pilgrims, and the extradition of fugitives from justice. The friendlier tone of this treaty is explained by Nadir Shah's policy of minimizing, if not abolish ing, the sectarian differences which during the previous period had done so much to exacerbate the feelings of Persians and Turks against one another. The third Turco-Persian treaty, known as the ' Second Treaty of Erzerum,' concluded in Jumada a.h . 1238 (July 1823) between Path-'All Shah and Sultan Mahmiid II, comprises a preamble dealing with frontiers, pilgrims, merchants, extradition, and Em bassies; and seven clauses relating to various matters similar to those mentioned above. The fourth Turco-Persian treaty, known as the 'Second Treaty of Erzerum,' concluded in Jumada ii, a.h . 1263 (May-June 1817), between Muhammad Shah Qajar and Sultan 'Abdul'l-Majid, comprises nine clauses, dealing with terms of peace, restoration of the status quo ante, frontier delimitation, tariffs, pilgrims, consuls, border tribes, etc. The Persian plenipoten tiary, the celebrated and'unfortunate Mirza Taqi Khan Amir-i-Kabir, was described by the Hon. Robert Curzon as ' beyond all comparison the most interesting per sonage amongst the Commissioners of Turkey, Persia, Russia, and Great Britain who were then assembled at Erzerum.' Besides the four treaties above mentioned there are some dozen conventions dealing with special matters, such as posts and telegraphs, and varying in dates from 1863 to 1902. These are of minor importance, and require no further notice here.Persia] RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA 55 assassinated, and in 1800 Georgia and Ganja were formally and finally annexed by Russia. Two Russo-Persian wars ensued, the first ending in the disastrous Treaty of Gulistan (October 12, 1813), and the second in the equally disastrous Treaty of Turkmanchay (February 21, 1828). By the former Persia surrendered to Russia Georgia, Derbend, Baku, Shirwan, Shaki, Ganja, Kara Dagh, Mughan and part of Talisli; any rights she may have possessed over Mingrelia and other parts of the Caucasus; and the right of maintaining a navy on the Caspian Sea. 1 The Treaty of Turkmanchay, which explicitly superseded that of Gulistan, fixed the present Russo-Persian frontier; and, in Mr. Watson's words, 'its provisions now form the basis of the intercourse between Persia and the nations of Europe.' The com plete text, French and Persian, of the three Treaties (Peace, Commerce, and the supplementary Proces- verbal) simultaneously concluded and collectively known as the Treaty of Turkmanchay, will be found in extenso on pp. 116-142 of the Mu'tamanuT-Mulk's Recueil des Traites, etc., and a good summary of the most important provisions is given by R. G. Watson (loc. cit.). The Treaty of Peace comp'rises 16 articles, the most important of which were those dealing with the cession of the Khanates of Erivan and Nakhchu- wan, with the merchant shipping of the countries on the Caspian, and with the position of the Crown Prince 'Abbas Mirza. The Treaty of Turkmanchay finally fixed the Russo- Persian frontier west of the Caspian, and put an end to all Persian influence north of the Araxes and on the Caspian. It also gave to Russia the right to nominate consuls or consular agents ' par tout ou le bien du commerce I'exigera,' and to bestow on them the protection, honour, and privileges suitable to their public character. None of them, however, was to have a suite of more than ten persons. The Commercial 1 K. Gr.

Apart from so-called 'pacific penetration,' it may be said that the Russo-Persian frontier west of the Caspian was finally determined in 1828, and east of the Caspian in 1881 and 1893. (3) Great Britain The Treaty of Peace which concluded the Anglo- Persian War was signed at Paris on March 4, 1857, and ratified at Baghdad on May 2, 1857, and it com prised 14 articles. Its most important stipulations were those whereby Persia renounced all claims to sovereignty over Herat or any part of Afghanistan (Art. 5-8) and tendered an apology to the British Minister at Teheran (Art. 10). Provision is made (Art. 9) for the appointment of four classes of Consular officers', without limitation of number or specification of place of residence. There is an article (13) provid ing for the suppression of the slave-trade in the Persian Gulf, and another (12) whereby the British Government renounces the right of protecting Persian subjects not employed in the British Legation or Consulate, 'provided that no such right is accorded to or exercised by any other Foreign Power; but in this, as in all other respects, the British Government requires, and the Persian Government engages, that the same privileges and immunities shall in» Persia be conferred upon and shall be enjoyed by the British Government, its servants and its subjects, -und that the same respect and consideration shall be shown for them and shall be enjoyed by them as are conferred and enjoyed by and shown to the most favoured Foreign Government, its servants and its subjects.' Besides this treaty there are several important telegraphic conventions, the first (1868) providing for the construction of a land line between Guadar, in British Baluchistan, and some point on the Persian coast between Bandar Abbas and Jask; the second (1873) ' for continuing the system of telegraphic com-58 HISTORY mimication between Europe and India through Persia \ i- an -^ lls ^i re )&gt; the third and fourth (1887) extending the operation of the first and second until January 31 1905; the fifth and sixth (1892) further seventhHfl Qfrn ^ eri0&lt; ^ UIlti ^ J anu ^ 1, y 1, 1925; and the seventh (1901) providing for the construction of a Baluchistan 116 6611 Teheran and frontier of Mention should also be made of two other conven- slavi ? ne ^ 882 ) for th€ suppression of the traffic in slaves (supplementing and cancelling Article 13 of the Doua^' nQn^ 0f ^ and a 'Convention nnd on h t if f ?&gt; lgned Sir Arthur Hardinge, fh P S.I ® r? the „ Perslal1 Government by M.

[No. 80Persia] III. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS (1) Religious Ihe great majority of the Persians belong to the Shi a sect of Islam, and to that branch of it known as the Ithnd-ashariyya, who recognise twelve Imams or spiritual successors of the Prophet Muhammad. The once important SaViyya, who recognise only seven Imams, are represented now only by a few Isma'ilis, whose allegiance is given to the Agha Khan of Bombay. The word tihia in Arabic means ' Party,' and in this connection specifically the Party of 'All, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. Ihey reject the first three of the four Caliphs (Khalifa), recognised by the Sunnis (Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and TJthman), whom they regard as usurpers, and used till lately to curse, though this practice has latterly fallen into desuetude; and, as they repudiate the whole theory of the Caliphate from the time of the Prophet s death onwards, the question of who, if anyone, is entitled at the present day to be regarded as Caliph has no interest for them. Their hatred for 'Umar (whose assassination at the hands of a Persian captive they used annually to cele brate much as Guy Fawkes' Day is celebrated in England) is probably really due to the fact that he was responsible for the conquest of Persia by the Arabs, and the overthrow of the Sasanian dynasty about the middle of the seventh century of our era; while their love for the Imams is at least in part due to the belief (prevalent for at least the last thousand years) that Al-Husayn, the third Imam and grandson of the Prophet, married a daughter of Yazdigird, the last Sasanian King, and that consequently his son,Persia] RELIGIOUS 61 Cyprus respectively. Baha'u'llah died in May 1890, and was succeeded by his son, 'Abbas Effendi 'Abdu'l- Baha,who now holds the allegiance of the great majority of the Babis, or Baha'fs as they now prefer to call them selves. Subh-i-Azal, who lived a very secluded life and had but a small following, died on April 29, 1912, and it ^ is not clear who, if anyone, has succeeded him. Ihe Baha'is, on the other hand, have carried on an active and successful propaganda not only in Persia but in Europe, and especially in the United States of America, and constitute a considerable power. Their numbers, though greatly exaggerated by their partisans, are, nevertheless, considerable in Persia, and they belong in large proportion to the better educated and more prosperous classes, especially Sayyids (see p. 65), merchants, and employees of the Post Office and Telegraphs. lo return to the orthodox Shi'a. To superficial observers the difference between them and the Sunnfs appears to hinge merely on the rival claims to supremacy of persons who have been dead for nearly thirteen hundred years; but, in reality, there is a vital difference of principle; the Shf'a representing the Persian doctrine of Divine Right, the Sunnis the more democratic idea of the Arabs. To compare these two great divisions of Islam to Roman Catholics and Protestants in Christendom is in some respects mis leading, for if, on the one hand, the doctrine of the Imamate presents analogies to that of the Papacy, in other respects the Shi'a doctrine, with its greater emphasis of Free Will, and its assertion of Ijtihdd, or the progressive discovery of great religious truths, is the more liberal and progressive. In some respects the Shi'a are more liberal than the Sunnis, in others less; thus they do not hesitate to give and return the same salutation to non-Muslims as to fellow-believers; while, on the other hand, they tend to regard unbelievers as definitely unclean (najis) to a much greater degree than do the Sunnis. Moreover, the Persian 'ulamd, or doctors of theology, do in practice resemble a clergy62 PRESENT CONDITIONS or priesthood in a much greater degree than the corresponding class amongst the Sunm's, and may, per haps, have inherited some of the characteristics and peculiarities of the old Magian or Zoroastrian heir- archy. The Shfa doctrine, though always prevalent in Persia, only became the State religion about a.d. 1500, when the Safawi dynasty rose to power. The well- known Persian geographical work entitled Nuzhatu'l- Qulub, written in the fourteenth century, mentions, as a rule, in the case of each important town in Persia the prevalent belief of the inhabitants; and in most cases this is one of the four orthodox Sunnf schools (commonly Shati'i or Hanafi), though the Shfa also were numerous. But Shah Isma'fl, the founder of the Safawi dynasty, resolved to make the Shi'a doctrine not only prevalent but practically universal in Persia, and, by dint of persecution, succeeded in his endeavour. His object, as already pointed out, 1 was largely political, for he aimed at giving to Persia unity, coherence, and a strong motive for resistance to the militant Turkey of Sultan Selim 'the Grim.' His work has stood the test of four centuries, and at the present day there are hardly any Sunnfs to be found m Persia, save in parts of Kurdistan in the west and in the town of Lar in the south. In consequence of this policy, Persia has, during this period, formed a barrier between the Sunnis of Turkey to the west and those of Turkistan, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan to the east; and Shah Isma'il and his successors have done more than anyone else to defeat the Pan-Islamic idea. In recent years, however, and especially since the Persian Revolution of 1905-6 and the Turkish Revolution of 1909, this antagonism has been consider- ably mitigated ; and a good deal of sympathy has arisen between the 'Young Turks' and the 'Young Persians, though it is doubtful how far it has sur- vi\ed actual contact. But it is easy to exaggerate the 1 See above, p. 20.Persia] religious 63 effect of religion on politics, even in the East; and, as m the recent European War there have been Protestants and Catholics allied on either side against fellow-believers on the other side, so the relations of Persians and lurks have been, are, and will be, regu lated rather by political than by religious considera tions. Due regard must also be paid to the unifying elfect of the Islamic ideal, which is social as well as religious, and which must always stand for a certain identity of outlook, so that it is quite usual to find, even in irreligious or sceptical Muslims, a very real attachment to Islam as a political and social system, and a very definite dislike of Western institutions and ideas. Besides the prevailing Shi'a Muhammadans, the Babis or Baha'is, the Isma'ilfs, and the Sufi's or mystics, the strange sect of the 'AlMlahis may be mentioned. The non-Muslim subjects of Persia are (1) a considerable number of Jews, especially in the Hamadan region; (2) Armenian and Nestorian Christians, the former chiefly at Isfahan, the latter in Azarbaijan; (3) a remnant of the ancient Zoro- astrians (called by the Muslims by the contemptuous name of gahr or ' guebre '), mostly at Yezd and Kirman, whose total number in Persia falls short of ten thousand. (2) Political 1 No political parties, in our sense of the term, can be said to have existed before 1906 or 1907, but after the Revolution and the establishment of a Majlis, or National Assembly, three main parties gradually emerged: to wit, the Reactionary or Autocratic (Mustahidd), the Moderate {rtiddli), and the Demo cratic (Dimukrdt) or Revolutionary {Inqildhi). Of the first, which bated the Constitution and Parlia ment desired no reform, and supported the old auto- 1 See Supplement to the Fundamental Laws of the Persian Empire, Appendix IV, p. 130.64 PRESENT CONDITIONS [No.so cracy, men like Prince 'Aynu'd-Dawla, a tyrant but, according to his lights, a patriot, were the best, and corrupt, unpatriotic time-servers like Sa'du'd-Dawla the worst representatives. This party included many princes, nobles, and old-fashioned governors, a con siderable section of the so-called clergy, and the numerous dependents of the Shah and hangers-on at ■the Court; and, for obvious reasons, was to a large extent pro-Russian. The Moderates, who may be des cribed as Progressive Conservatives, were well repre sented by the Nasiru'l-Mulk, the ex-Regent, who was a graduate of Balliol College, Oxford. The most able and upright of the Democrats were the Nawwab Husayn- quli Khan, who had been educated in England and France, had held important positions at the courts of Nasiru'd-Dm Shah and Muzalfaru'd-Dm Shah, and at the Persian Legation in London, and was Minister for Foreign Affairs under the second Majlis until driven from office by the Russians at the end of 1910; and Sayyid Taqf-zada, a young man of the people from Tabriz, whose courage, ability, and honesty won him a great reputation. The Democrats, who hated, and were hated by, the Russians, at first looked to England for help and sym pathy, but from 1910 onwards became alienated from her, regarding her policy in Persia as entirely sub ordinated to Russia. After the violent acts of aggression committed by Russia at the end of 1911 and beginning of 1912, they were so exasperated that they Were ready to welcome any nation, people, government, or party antagonistic to that country: and hence, after the outbreak of the war, many of them readily succumbed to the effective and easy propaganda of the Germans and Turks—a great misfortune, since they included many of the most enlightened and patriotic Persians, whose natural sympathies might have been with England. A profound distrust and dislike of Russia rather than any g^reat affection for Turkey and Germany was, in fact, the determining factor in their later attitude. It is noteworthy that the Democratic36 Persia] POLITICAL 65 Party included a considerable number of the leading doctors of divinity, or Mullds ('clergy'), whose natural Conservatism was overweighed by their attachment to the ideas of Persian independence and the common interests of Islam. (3) Social In spite of the autocratic power still enjoyed in large measure by the Persian governors, nobles and landed gentry, there is more democratic instinct in the country than is commonly supposed. This arises partly from the frequency with which men of humble origin rise to the highest positions in the State; partly from the fact that under the old regime the Shah was supreme and his subjects were little more than his servants and chattels; but still more from that brotherhood of Islam which confers even on the negro slave a much higher degree of equality with . his master than the freed negro in the United States enjoys in relation to his white fellow-citizen. It is as though the greatness of God and of His terrestrial vicegerent dwarfed all lesser inequalities to insignificance. The chief classes are (1) the courtiers, great nobles, large land-owners, and provincial governors, generally regarded by the clerical and mercantile classes as ' tvrants ' {ahl-i-zulm ) ; (2) the religious leaders (Mullds, Sayyids, and directors of the numerous orders of dervishes or religious mendicants); (3) the mer chants, who are often both intelligent and enterprising; (4) the artisans and shopkeepers; and (5) the labourers and peasants. A considerable proportion of the inhabitants of Persia belong to various nomad tribes of Persian,Turkish, and, in the south and south-west, Arab origin. Of these the most important are the Bakh- tiaris, Lurs and Kurds in the west, the Qashqa'is in Pars, and the Arab tribes of Khuzistan and the Persian Gulf region. These have their own chiefs and organization, and lead a migratory, pastoral, and often militant and predatory life. The strength of Persia [285—98] ■ ^ . F66 PRESENT CONDITIONS lno.SO lies chiefly in her enterprising mercantile class, her ingenious and industrious artisans, and her hardy and laborious peasants; and it is unfortunate that so many European travellers and residents form their ideas of the nation chiefly from the two least satis factory classes, the official and the parasitic. (4) Educational The old-fashioned Persian colleges (madrasas) were pious foundations of a religious character in which, at a very small charge, instruction was given in the Qur'dn, theology, Arabic grammar and philology, reading, writing and Persian literature. The Ddru L- Funun, or Polytechnic, at Teheran was founded early in the reign of Nasiru'd-Din Shah, and was conducted on more or less modern lines with a staff which included numerous European instructors of various nationalities. Recent years have seen the foundation of numerous other colleges also on more or less modern lines. The children of the rich were generally taught by private tutors. The proportion of literates is fairly high; and a knowledge of and taste for the Persian classics (notably Eirdawsi, Sa'di and Hafiz) are widely spread, and give a singular correctness and wealth of expression even to the humblest, so that there is hardly a muleteer who does not beguile the tedium of the long marches by reciting verses from the classical poets. Learning is in general highly esteemed and much sought after, though the field of study is still mediaeval in character and limited in extent; con siderable progress has, however, been made in recent years.27 Persia] IY. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (A) MEANS OF COMMUNICATION (1) Internal Until the problem of transport lias been solved material progress in Persia is almost impossible. Except for a railway from Julfa, on the Russian fron tier, to Tabriz, which was opened in 1916, and for a certain amount of motor traffic between Teheran and Resht, there is an entire absence of modern means of communication within the country. None of the ports on the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf is suitable for important traffic; the only waterway is the Karun, navigable from Mohammera almost as far as Shustar (190 miles), although the stream is interrupted by rapids at Ahwaz; and although the country abounds in mule tracks, and wheeled traffic is possible at certain seasons of the year over considerable parts of the caravan routes, the metalled roads in the whole of Persia do not exceed a total of 1,000 miles. Indeed, made roads are not always viewed with favour, because they imply tolls; and as there is at present little wheeled transport, the bulk of trade is carried by caravans of pack animals, which can travel on a track where tolls are not charged almost as quickly as on a made road. (a) Roads, Caravan Routes, and Tracks The chief main roads suitable for wheels, and on which carriages and postal fourgons travel without difficulty, are the following:— (1) From Enzeli on the Caspian Sea via Resht and Kazvin to Teheran. The length of this road is approx- mately 234 miles. It was built in two sections, that from Kazvin to Teheran being constructed by the Persian Government in 1878-9, and that from Kazvin to the coast by a Russian company. In 1896 the portion of the road constructed by the Persian Government was handed [285—98] F 2ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ^o.so over to the Russian company, who repaired and re constructed it, and the whole road was opened for traffic in August, 1899. The share capital of the Russian company is 1,700,000 rubles and there are also 1,500,000 rubles in debentures, the latter being _held by the Russian Government, who also guaranteed 5 per cent, dividend on the shares. The income or the com pany is derived from tolls levied on vehicles and animals using the road; and in order to avoid payment of these tolls a considerable amount of export trade from Teheran is sent down to the coast via Amul to Meshed- i-Sar, a shorter road upon which no tolls are levied. (2) From Teheran via Kum to Sultanabad. This road was also built in two sections, that from Teheran to Kum, at a cost o-f about £12,000, by the Persian Government, who subsequently sold it to the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the section from Kum to Sultana bad by the Persian Road and Transport Company, to which company the concession was transferred by the Imperial Bank of Persia. (3) From Teheran via Semnan and Shahrud to Meshed, a distance of 566 miles. (4) From Teheran via Kum, Kashan and Isfahan to Shiraz, a distance of 594 miles. Though this road has not yet been properly constructed, it is practicable for carriages throughout. (5) From Kazvin to Hamadan. This road has been built with Russian money and it was intended to extend it to Kirmanshah. (6) From Askabad (on the Russian Trans-Caspian Railway) via Kuchan to Meshed. This road was con structed by Russians from Askabad over the mountains to Kuchan, between which point and Meshed it is of Persian construction. It carries a constant and fairly heavy traffic of carriages and pack animals. (7) From Tabriz to Julfa on the Caucasian frontier, a distance of 78 miles. This road was also built by the Russian company referred to above and was constructed in such a manner as to be easily convertible into a rail road afterwards, the railway material for the purposePersia] ROADS AND TRACKS 69 being stored iat Erivan; the bridges were made strong enough to carry locomotives and tunnels even were made. For some time there was a motor service running on the road, but since the completion of the railway this has been discontinued. From Mar and on this road a road goes west to Khoi, north of Lake Urumieh, and thence south to the town of Urumieh (Urmia) on the west side of the lake. This also is suitable for wheeled traffic, but is not made up like the section from Jul'fa to Tabriz. In addition to those above mentioned, there are various roads on which wheeled traffic is possible either throughout or in parts, e.g., the road from Kashan to Yezd and Kirman. This, though not a built road, is usually lit for carts throughout. The remaining roads are either caravan routes or mere mule tracks which have existed from time im memorial, and have been to some extent improved for commercial purposes by a slight expenditure of labour. The only made caravan road is that from Ahwaz to Isfahan, commonly known as the Lynch Road. In 1898 Messrs. Lynch Bros, took over a concession, in cluding the right of levying tolls, granted to a Persian subject for this road, which was opened for traffic in 1900. The Bakhtiari Khans, through whose country it runs, have an interest in the profits earned by the road in return for policing it. As a consequence traffic was never interrupted on this road as on others until 1911, and much of the import trade to Isfahan was thus diverted from Bushire to Mohammera. From what has been said above two facts stand out, firstly that communications in Persia are bad, and secondly that of such communications as exist all, except the road from Isfahan to Shiraz, are within what was until recently known as the Russian sphere of influence, and that a large proportion of them are the outcome of Russian effort and have been con structed with Russian money. Ihese roads have, with out question, proved an important factor in what may be termed the Russian commercial penetration of70 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS Persia. The only British concern working to a similar end is the Persian Road and Transport Company, founded by Messrs. Lynch Bros, in 1902 to take over from the Imperial Bank of Persia a concession, which the bank had obtained in 1889, for the construction of roads from Teheran vid Kum to Isfahan, and from Kum to Ahwaz. The only portion constructed by the Bank was that from Teheran to Kum. Since the con cession was taken over by the company, the section from Kum to Sultanabad has been constructed and a new concession obtained to make further roads from the latter point to Hamadan and Kirmanshah. Latterly, owing to the disturbed state of the country, especially in Luristan, work has not progressed. The concessions were originally granted upon condition that the roads should be completed by 1912, but it is understood that the construction period has been ex tended. The importance of the concessions lies in the fact that the only routes from the mouth of the Shatt el- Arab to Teheran will thus be placed to a large extent under British control. (b) Rivers I he only navigable river in Persia is the Karun, which rises in the highlands of Luristan, enters the plains at bhustar, and flows by the Haffar channel into the Shatt el-Arab at Mohammera, and by the less important Balmanshir channel into the sea, 12 miles west of the entrance of the Shatt el-Arab. From its mouth to Bandar Naziri, a distance of 110 miles, the river is navigable at any time by river steamers diawing not more than 2 ft,, and by vessels up to 5 ft. draught during the high-water season. The channel is very narrow in places and sandbanks extend from the points of most of the bends, sometimes even half way across the river. The river is lowest from August to the end of October, and is tidal for 30 miles above Mohammera. Between Bandar Naziri and Ahwaz, a distance of about one mile, the river is unnavigablePersia] RIVERS 71 owing to a series of heavy rapids, and a tramway has been laid for the transport of goods to vessels above the rapids. Above Ahwaz the river is navigable by shallow-draught steamers almost as far as Shustar. In 1913 there were engaged in the trade on the river one British-owned steamer and two barges (owned by Messrs. Lynch Bros.), one Persian steamer and one barge, and one German steamer and two barges, the German steamer having been put on for the first time in that year. The Karun was opened to the mercantile marine of the world in 1889, and a great development of trade with Persia was anticipated. Owing, however, to defective port facilities at Mohammera, the want of good communications between Ahwaz and the interior, and the difficulties of river navigation already alluded to, these anticipations have not been realised. The possibilities of the improvement of the river for navigation have recently been considered by Sir George Buchanan, K.C.I.E., and he has expressed the opinion that, except at prohibitive cost, it is not capable of material improvement as a waterway, and that in the low-water season the water could be much more profit ably used for irrigation purposes. To meet the loss to trade which the abandonment of the navigation of the river would involve, a railway to Ahwaz has been sug gested, and, as a part of his scheme for making Basra the distributing centre for the whole of the Persian Gulf, Sir George Buchanan advocates giving up the use of Mohammera as a port and the laying of the pro posed railway from Basra direct to Ahwaz, a distance of about 75 miles through flat country, such railway to be run in connexion with a proposed motor service between Ahwaz and Isfahan. (c) Railways If we except a small line which runs from Teheran to the Shrine of Shah Abdul Azim, a distance of about 6 miles, the only railways in Persia to-day are (1)72 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No.so the Kussian line from Julfa, on the Caucasian frontier, to Tabriz, a distance of about 83 miles, with a branch line from Sufian to a point on the north-eastern end of Lake Urumieh, and (2) the extension into Persia of the Indian line from Quetta, the terminus of which, when war broke out, was Nushki, and which is now open for traffic to Mirjawa, just on the Persian side of the frontier. The latter line has been extended for purely strategic reasons and, though it may in time become part of an important scheme of commercial railways in Persia, its commercial importance is at present small. The Russian railway comes under a different category. Its object was largely commercial. The concession for it was granted to a Russian com pany in February 1913, and the line was opened for traffic in 1916, the speed with which it was con structed being due to the fact, already mentioned, that the road from Julfa to Tabriz, which was constructed by the same Russian company, and had been open for traffic for some years, was built with a view to its being subsequently converted into a permanent way for a railway. The chief terms of the concession under which the railway was constructed are the following: (1) Ihe concession is for 75 years, subject to an option to the Persian Government to purchase at the end of 35 years. (2) The concessionnaire has the right to work all petroleum and coal mines within 40 miles of the line on each side. (3) The Persian Government participates equally with the company in the profits of the railway in each } e ar after 7 per cent, on the invested capital has been paid tor that year, and to the extent of 15 per cent, in the net profits derived from mines on State lands situated within the area affected. (4) The company has the preference to construct a i ail way irom Tabriz to Kazvin on equal terms with those which any other company may offer in the future.Persia] RAILWAYS 73 A two years' option was also granted in 1913 to the Persian Railway Syndicate (a syndicate of English capitalists) for the construction of a line from Moham- mera or its neighbourhood to Khoramabad on con ditions to be arranged, this option being intended to counterbalance the railway concession granted to the Russian company. Beyond preliminary surveys, how ever, nothing has yet been done towards the construction of this line. (d) Posts, Telegraphs, and Telephones The posts and telegraphs are under the control of a Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, but the statistics of the traffic are unreliable. The first regular postal service was established by an Austrian official in Persian employ and opened in January 1877. Under it mails are regularly conveyed to and from the principal cities in Persia. Before the war there was also a regular service (twice weekly) to and from Europe via Russia, and a weekly service to and from India via Bushire. Persia has four systems of telegraphs, which, accord ing to a return made in 1909 (the latest available), consist altogether of 6,590 miles of line with 10,908 miles of wire and 129 stations. These systems are classed as follows: (1) Those worked by an English staff forming the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Persia. This is a British Government Department, established in virtue of a number of conventions made from 1863 to 1901, between the British and Persian Governments, the last of which provided for the construction and working by the British Government of a 3-wire line from Ardistan via Yezd, Kirman and Bam to Kuh-i- Malik Siah, where connection is obtained with the Indian telegraph system. Telegraphic communication with India was established by this route in 1904. The line, which was constructed under the supervision and at the expense of the British Government, is known as the Central Persian Telegraph; its headquarters74 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [N o.8o are at Teheran, and the Persian Government has the right to use it for the purpose of local administration. The department also owns lines connecting Teheran and Bushire via Kashan, Ardistan, and Isfahan. (2) That of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, Limited. This company, which is quite distinct from the Government department above mentioned, holds concessions which are to remain in force until 1945 for a line of 415 miles in length with 3 wires and 6 stations between 1 eheran and Julfa, to which point the company's line is carried from London across Europe via Kertch. (3) Persian Government lines maintained and worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. At present this system consists only of the line from 1 eheran to Meshed, a distance of 368 miles, with 10 stations and a single wire except between Teheran and ohahrud. where the line is double. (4) Lines belonging to the Persian Government and worked by a Persian staff. There are 26 of these lines, each of winch consists of a single wire; the total length of the various lines is 3,732 miles and there are 88 stations. The first three classes of lines are efficiently run and satisfactory; the fourth is not. i e A xce P tio11 of a private line which has been ai y e , Anglo-Persian Oil Company for business purposes, the telephone is as yet unknown in Persia. (1a) Projected Improvements I f Persia had been left to herself, probably little would have been attempted in the direction of improv- mg the means of communication in the country, and of tn a ff eei l C } 0ne 80 ^ ar i s i n the main the outcome trJ^ ™ y t ?

Indeed, the 01 r eat Britain certainly, and probably ofPersia] IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS 75 Russia also, in Persia in recent years has been politioal rather than commercial, a fact which will be understood when it is realised that the value of the total trade of Persia (exports and imports combined) amounted annually to less than £20,000,000 sterling. (a) Railways From 1865 onwards many railway concessions have been granted in Persia, and as many unsuccessful attempts have been made to develop them. The most famous is that granted in 1872 to Baron de Renter for the construction of a railway from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf with a seven years' monopoly of the right of building other railways. This con cession was revoked owing to the hostility of the Russians. Various other attempts followed with no better success until in 1885 a Frenchman, named Boitel, obtained a group of railway concessions of which the chief was for a line from Resht to Teheran and thence to Bushire. The only line which he succeeded in building was the short one from Teheran to the Shrine of Shah Abdul Azim. In 1889 the Russian Government obtained the re fusal of all railway concessions for five years. This was subsequently extended to 10 years, then for a further 10 years, and finally expired in 1910, at which date, Russia having made no use of her privilege, Persia was still without any concrete schemes for railway iconstruction. The difficulties in the way of the construction of railways are political rather than engineering, though serious problems of the latter class undoubtedly exist. There is also the question of finding the necessary capital. Persia cannot produce it, and both British and Russian financiers require some guarantee, which, so far as the British Government is concerned, has in the past always been refused. The following are the most important of the schemes which have been put forward, the first mentioned alone having so far materialised in any form:76 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 80 (1) Julfa-Tabriz-Teheran, The railway already constructed to Tabriz is in fact (though not in theory) part of this scheme. This line will only benefit Russian commerce, and, when conditions become normal again, will without doubt divert a large portion of the traffic which has in the past entered and left the country via Khoi, Bayazid and Trebizond. (2) Baku-Resht-Teheran. This line would place the Persian capital in direct railway communication with Moscow, and would thus tend to bring Persia even more within the orbit of Russian trade than it is at present. The engineering difficulties in the way of its construction are, however, considerable. ^ (3) Baghdad - Khanikin - Kirmanshah - Hamadan - Teheran. This is the oldest and most discussed pro ject in Persia. Except for two stretches 'between Khanikin and Kirmanshah, one of about 6 and the other of about 8 miles in length, the line should not prove very difficult to construct, while commercially it would have a good prospect of success, as it would provide much-needed markets for the corn produced in Kirmanshah, the centre of the richest grain country of Persia. Since the Baghdad Railway Convention was drawn up the scheme has been less in favour in Russian circles than it was previously. (4) Julfa or Baku to Teheran, thence to Isfahan, Yezd and Kirman, and thence either to join the Indian Railway system or to a seaport on the Persian Gulf. In 1913 and 1914 negotiations for the construction of a Trans-Persian railway took place between the Russian and British Governments, and Russian bankers came to London to endeavour to arrange the financial side of the scheme. Agreement between the Russian and British Governments as to the direction the line should take had not been reached when the war broke out. The political aspect of the matter entirely dominated the negotiations. (5) Mohammera - Dizful - Khoramabad-Burujird- Hamadan. The section to Dizful would not be difficult to construct; an estimate of the cost of a metrePROJECTED RAILWAYS 77 gauge line is about £3,000 per mile, or £500,000 for the whole course from Moliammera to Dizful. The northern section (from Dizful onwards), though it has not yet been surveyed, is sure to prove much more ex pensive, and the Lur tribes, which inhabit part of the country to be traversed, are likely to be a source of trouble. Owing to the attitude of the tribes the pre liminary work of surveying had to be abandoned, and the two years' option for the construction of the line, which was granted bv the Persian Government to the Persian Railway Syndicate in 1913, was extended for a period of 18 months after the state of the country should permit of its resumption. The prospects of the commercial as distinct from the strategic value of the line as far as Dizful largely depend upon the development of irrigation on the River Karun (see above, p. 71). If carried through to Hamadan, the line would intercept all the trade which at present comes through Baghdad from east of Hamadan. The work ing of the line would be inexpensive as fuel would be easily obtained from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which would, moreover, be an important customer. (6) Bandar Abbas -Minab-Rigan-Kirman. This is said to be the easiest alignment for a railway from the Persian Gulf to the main plateau of Persia. It was surveyed in 1905, and the cost of construction from Bandar Abbas to Rigan, a distance of 278 miles, and of the necessary rolling stock was estimated at about £2,500,000. As a purely commercial^ enterprise the line could not be made to pay. Strategically some sue railway would probably have been a necessity but tor the European War. - (7) Bushire-Shiraz. Owing to the engineering difficulties involved, amy railway between these two points is out of the question as a commercial proposi tion until Persia is economically much more developed than she is at present. The above -mentioned schemes represent the views which were held before the Great War by those com petent to form an opinion upon the best location oi78 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS railways in Persia. The results of the war have altered the position in certain important particulars. As has been indicated, there had been for a number of years prior to 1907 serious commercial competition between Great Britain and Russia in Persia. ■ It formed the subject of an important chapter in Lord Curzon's book on the country, published in 1892, and the attempts on the part of Russia to extend her in fluence became more marked as time went on. Ulti mately in 1907 an Agreement 1 was come to by Great Britain and Russia to respect the integrity and in dependence of Persia, to preserve order, assist the peaceful development of the country and to remove possible causes of friction by dividing it into a Russian sphere of influence in the north, a British sphere in the south, and a neutral zone between the two. The southern limit of the Russian sphere of influence was a line from Kasr-i-Shirin, on the western frontier, through Yezd and Khakh to the eastern frontier close to the boundary between Russia and Afghanistan; the northern limit of the British sphere was a line from Bandar Abbas, through Kirman, Birjand and Gazik, to the Afghan frontier. the outbreak of war were, therefore, automatically con fined to the south, and all discussions of the possible British railway projects in Persia between 1907 and location of commercial railways in which Great Britain was likely to be interested have been based upon the Persian Gulf. The situation created by the war in Mesopotamia, the denunciation by Persia 2 of -the Anglo-Russian agreement, and the dissolution of the Russian Empire have, however, profoundly affected the situation. It now seems certain that Baghdad will become the chief railway centre of this part of Asia. The railway has been pushed north from Baghdad along the valley of ^ -n beyond Tekrit, and before long the town will be connected by rail with Basra. Already a metre % 1 See Appendix, p. 123. ^ See footnote&gt; p 125Persia] PROJECTED RAILWAYS 79 gauge railway has been opened to Khanikin on the Persian frontier, and another line to Altun Keupri has been surveyed, which latter line, it is suggested, should be prolonged to Tabriz through the Wasna Pass. Moreover, the old scheme of a trunk line from the Mediterranean to Baghdad, following the course of the Euphrates, which was many years ago discussed, considered and abandoned by British capitalists, has again become a practical proposition. It appears pro bable, therefore, that the first Persian railway in which British money is invested will be based upon Baghdad and will make for Hamadan and Teheran. Putting political considerations on one side, the further north that Great Britain can establish a strong commercial policy in Persia the better it will be. The north of Persia is more developed than the south, the bulk of the export trade, following the old caravan routes and attracted by Russian tariffs, flows in a northerly direction, and in the north will be Great Britain's best chance of developing an export trade from Persia, as well as an import trade, instead of concentrating upon the latter alone as has been her policy in the past. A point of the first importance in the settlement of any railway policy in Persia is the question of railway gauges. The three great world gauges approach each other on the borders of Persia, viz., the Indian (5 ft. 6 in.), the Russian (5 ft.), and the European or standard gauge (4 ft. 8^ in.), and no railway policy should be adopted in Persia which does not attempt to solve the difficulties which are involved in the competing claims of the different systems. From a Persian point of view, it is clear that it is eminently desirable that one system should as far as possible be made general throughout the country, and it rests with the engineers to say which gauge is practicable. There is no doubt that Persian requirements would be best met either by standard gauge main lines giving /80 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ino.so access, without break of gauge, both to the Mediter ranean and to the Persian Gulf, and affording a good through -route from Europe to India, or by lines of metre gauge to the exclusion of all three competing gauges. The adoption of the metre gauge would, how ever, be a serious impediment to any through route to India, and, if it is proposed to favour or tolerate an effective overland route to India via Constantinople, British interests will be best served by the adoption of the standard gauge, the exact point of junction with the Indian gauge system being left for future determination. This policy would justify the extra expense of con structing a 4 ft. 8| in. gauge railway through the diffi cult section between Kasr-i-Shirin and Kirmanshah, and the completion of this railway to Hamadan would render unnecessary for many years the direct outlet from the centre of Persia to the Persian Gulf. This decision would remove the only argument for the re tention of the metre gauge in Mesopotamia and would facilitate communication in the future between Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and, ultimately, India. The adoption of the European standard gauge would also favour the Constantinople route to India, passing through British control at Baghdad, as against the Black Sea or Russian route. There would be no objection to narrow gauge feeder lines in Persia, provided that they were not constructed on any of the routes selected for future main lines and that the gauge were sufficiently small (not wider than 2 ft. 6 in.) to avoid the risk of two competitive main lines being established, as is the case in India. (b) Roads The construction of railways in Persia represents the best possible means of developing the commercial resources of the country, but doubts have been expressed as to whether in the near future there will be money available for schemes which, though ultimately of im portance, would involve deferred returns in addition to© Persia! 1) ROJECTED ROADS 81 requiring persistent attention and protection. As an alternative to railways, motor roads have been suggested, particularly upon trade routes such as those of Ahwaz- Isfahan and Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan, upon the latter of which the physical obstacles to the construction of a railway appear to be insuperable. That some alterna tive to animal transport is necessary to trade in South Persia is generally admitted: animal transport is becoming more and more difficult to find, and the rates for it have in recent years risen by leaps and bounds. (2) External (a) Ports (i) Ports on the Persian Gulf and Shatt el-Arab — There are three ports on the Persian Gulf, viz., Bandar Abbas, Lingeh, and Bushire, and one—Mohammera— at the mouth of the River Karun on the Shatt el-Arab. None of these is equipped with means for handling cargo: indeed, according to modern standards, they would be more properly termed landing-places. Bandar Ahhas, situated on the northern apex of the Straits of Hormuz, is one of the strongholds of British trade, and has been called the ' trade gate of South-East Persia.' The population of the town was estimated in 1915 at approximately 8,000. The inhabi tants are a hybrid race of mixed Persians, Baluchis, Arabs, and negroes. Except for the main bazaar there are no streets, and there is no wheeled traffic. The town is connected by submarine cable with Bushire and Karachi, but there is no land-line to the interior. The town has no industries. The chief products of the dis trict are dates and henna. Bandar Abbas is important as the entrepot for goods destined for the south-eastern part of Persia, the chief towns of which are Yezd and Kirman; goods consigned for Meshed and north-eastern Persia are also usually landed there. The chief imports are cotton piece-goods, yarn and twist, tea, and dyes; the exports are carpets, wool, and local products, such as almonds, raisins, dates, opium, and gum. The trade [285—98] GECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No.so of the port, as given in the British Consular Reports, has in recent years been as follows;— — 1895 1900 1905 f 1909-10 1913-14 Exports to all destina tions Imports from all sources .. £ 325,000 477,000 £ 103,000 339,000 £ 152,000 384,000 £ 202,000 340,000 £ 266,700 459,000 The harbour is well protected, but the beach is very shelving, and the anchorage (in 4r| fathoms) is about 3 miles off shore. There is a masonry pier 100 yds. long and 10 yds. wide, at which all goods are landed from boats and lighters, but, except for three hours before and three hours after high tide, it is high and dry. In calm weather as many as four lighters can discharge at one time, but in bad weather landing operations are difficult if not impossible. In order to enable the pier to be used both at low and high tides by ordinary country boats, which require a depth of nine feet when fully loaded, the pier should be extended for at least another 210 yds. The Customs administration is very defective, and is the object of many complaints. Goods frequently suffer considerable damage before they are despatched upon the caravan journey up-country, in the course of which further damage awaits them unless they are very securely packed. The following steamship lines made Bandar Abbas a port of call before the war:— British India Steam Navigation Co.: weekly on both outward and homeward journeys. Bombay-Persia Steam Navigation Co.: fortnightly on the outward journey. Hamburg-America Line: monthly on the outward journey. Arab Steamship Co., Ltd.: monthly on both outward and homeward journeys.Persia] PORTS 83 Bucknall Steamship Co., Ltd.: from 10 to 12 times a year on the outward journey. Anglo-Algerian Steamship Co.: from 10 to 12 times a year on the outward journey. West Hartlepool Steamship Co.: at irregular intervals. Russian Steam Navigation Co.: at irregular intervals. Ling eh, about 110 miles west of Bandar Abbas, sup plies Lar, Jahrum, and Bastak, and the surrounding districts inland, and by sea the Arab coast ports, to which goods are shipped by sailing boat or by steamer when available. In consequence of the high Persian Customs tariff, large quantities of goods brought to Lingeh for trans-shipment to the Arab coast are eventually smuggled back to Lingeh and other places on the Persian side. The town contains many well-built houses, extending in a narrow strip along the coast. Its population is estimated at 8,000 in summer and 12,000 in winter, after the return of the pearling fleet, pearl-fishing being the chief industry of the inhabitants. The prin cipal exports are carpets, cattle, drugs, pearls, gums, rosebuds for attar, fish, cotton, and fruits. The imports consist of cotton goods, twist, fruits, grain, metal goods, and sugar. The trade of the port since 1895 has been as follows:— — 1895 1900 1905 1910-11 1913-14 Exports to all destina tions Imports from all pources .. f 511,000 463,000 £ •170,000 501,000 £ 67,000 103,000 £ 194,000 132,000 £ 126,000 180,000 The marked difference in the volume of trade of the port in recent years is attributable to the effect of the revised Customs tariff, which was introduced in' 1903. A good deal of smuggling of tea and coffee is done, and [285—98] G 284 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No.so the bonded warehouses owned by the Germans were extensively used, with the connivance of the Belgian Customs officials, for the smuggling of dutiable goods and of prohibited goods, such as firearms. There is anchorage in all weathers for a large number of vessels in 5 fathoms, three-quarters of a mile off shore. The facilities for landing and shipping cargo are good of their kind, though the quay at the Customs house premises is small, and delays in the discharge of cargo result. The shipping lines which visit the port are the same as those which call 'at Bandar Abbas, but the service is less frequent. Bushire is the chief seaport of Persia, and is situated on the north side of the Abu Shahr Peninsula, about 160 miles south-east of the mouth of the Shatt el-Arab. The town has a population of about 20,000, more Arab than Persian. It is poorly built, the streets are narrow and dirty, and there is no attempt at draining, paving, or lighting them. The town is con nected with Fao and Karachi by submarine cable, and is on the Persian internal telegraph system. The port of Bushire is the terminus of the ancient caravan route from Teheran via Isfahan and Shiraz to the Persian Gulf. The chief exports are wheat, barley and other grain, dates, almonds, drugs, gums, cotton, wool, carpets, opium, skins, and tobacco. The imports are matches, timber, rice, candles, sugar, tea, drugs, spices, iron and other metal manufactures, hardware, cotton and woollen snoods, furniture, &amp;c. The following are the returns of the trade of Bushire in recent years: — 1895 1900 1905 1910-11 1913-14 f £ £ £ £ Exports to all destinations .. 529,000 710,000 470,000 349,000 602,000 Imports from all sources 1,017,000 1,323,000 762,000 676,000 826,000Persia] PORTS 85 There are two anchorages, of which the outer, where ships of deep draught lie, is upwards of 4 miles off shore, while the inner, which is about If miles out, can he reached at suitable tides by vessels whose draught does not exceed 17 ft. Both anchorages are exposed. The harbour has been surveyed, but the result goes to show that the cost of converting it into a convenient port would be prohibitive. There are neither wharves nor piers. The only landing-place is in Khor Sultain, a large creek giving access to the 'bund or embankment at which all cargo is shipped or landed; the depth alongside is only about 2 ft., and the accommodation is insufficient. The following steamship lines made Bushire a port of call in 1912-13:—The British India Steam Naviga tion Co.; the Anglo-Algerian Steamship Co.; the Bucknall Steamship Co., Ltd.; the West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co.; Andrew Weir &amp; Co.; the Arab Steamship Co., Ltd., and the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. Vessels of the Hamburg- America Line and the Russian Company of Shipping and Commerce also called occasionally. Mohammera is situated on the right bank of the so- called Haifar Channel, the main mouth of the Karun River, which flows into the Shatt el-Arab about one mile below the town. The population is about 12,000, of which the majority are Arabs; there is a consider able Jewish element. The town is connected by tele- graph with Basra and thus with the outside world; there is also internal telegraphic communication with Ahwaz, Shustar, Dizful, and other places in Arabistan. The town is built along the river, the buildings being partly of brick, partly of mud, and, although it contains some good buildings and has in recent years undergone considerable improvement, it remains dirty and highly insanitary. Mohammera is an important centre of commerce, and its trade has in recent years expanded, owing partly to the establishment of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. in the valley of the River Karun, and partly to the86 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No.so disturbed state of the trade route from Bushire, which has resulted in the diversion to the River Karun and the Lynch road of much of the trade destined for Isfahan, which was previously sent by Bushire and Shiraz. The future of Mohammera depends upon (1) the development of schemes for the irrigation of the plains of Arabistan, which would make the town the centre of an important export trade in cereals, &amp;c., but would put an end to the navigation of the River Karun; (2) the policy which is adopted in regard to the con struction of railways into Persia from the West (see p. 76). The following figures of the trade of Mohammera in recent years are taken from the British Consular Reports:— 1895 1900 1905 1909-10 1913-14 Exports to all destina' tions Imports from all sources £ 43,000 '138,000 £ 103,000 202,000 £ 93,000 221,000 £ 218.000 917.000 1 O O O O CO (M CO GC 1 Includes large imports of plant, &amp;c., for the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. The port of Mohammera has two anchorages, an outer in the Shatt el-Arab, immediately above the mouth of the Haft'ar Channel, and an inner, which lies up the Haifar Channel opposite to the town. The outer anchorage is used by large vessels, and has accommoda tion for over twenty ocean-going steamers to moor one below the other in line. The inner anchorage is not suitable for vessels exceeding 600 tons, and is only used by small vessels. Vessels using the outer anchorage are unloaded or loaded chiefly into or from lighters, barges and the native craft (baghalahs), but there are numerous wharves up the Haffar Channel which are used by the smaller vessels. There are no cranes or other conveniences for handling cargo. (ii) Ports on the Caspian Sea. —These are Bandar-i- Gaz, Meshed-i-Sa.r, and Enzeli, none of which is a port in the modern sense of the word.Persia] PORTS 87 Bandar-i-Gaz, situated in the Bay of Astarabad at the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea, consists of a few houses and a -pier about 350 yds. long but only 8 ft. wide, and without any conveniences for handling cargo. The entrance to the bay is well buoyed by the Russian Government, and ships of the largest size navigating the Caspian Sea can enter in any weather by day or night. The harbour is quite sheltered, and can hold a large number of vessels; there is sufficient water at the end of the pier for boats drawing several feet to come alongside. The port has been of consider able commercial importance in the past, but its trade has been adversely affected by the opening of the Trans- Caspian Railway. It still retains, however, a consider able amount of trade, but no statistics are available. It is visited every week by the steamers of the Caucasus and Mercury Steam Navigation Co., coming from Baku via Krasnovodsk. Meshed-i-Sar is only a small village with an open roadstead. There is no pier or wharf, or any con venience for landing or discharging cargo; steamers lie out some distance from the Customs house, and pas sengers and goods have to be transferred to or from large flat-bottomed cargo boats. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, a good deal of trade, both export and import, is done from Meshed-i-Sar, of which, in the former case, the bulk comes from Teheran, goods being sent by this route in preference to the Enzeli route, in order to avoid the tolls charged on the road from Teheran to Enzeli. Enzeli, situated in the south-west corner of the Caspian Sea, stands on the westernmost of two long sand spits which separate the Murdab—an inland lake —from the sea. On the opposite or easterly sand spit stands Gazian. The entrance to the Murdab is between the two spits, and, though over 200 yds. wide, is very difficult owing to a bar. At Enzeli the population is Persian, whereas Gazian is more or less a Russian settlement, and contains a hotel, steamship offices, and Russian trading houses. At Gazian there are also two?lf 111 88 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 80 Customs houses, wooden wharves, and two landing- stages, alongside which steamers drawing up to 7 or 8 ft. can load or discharge in calm weather. Mail steamers from Baku call twice a week in summer and once a week in winter, and passengers and goods are landed in steam launches. The harbour at Enzeli could be made accessible to mail steamers by dredging the bar. Steamship lines on the Caspian Sea. —None but Russian ships may ply on the Caspian Sea. The most important company engaged in its navigation before the war was the Caucasus and Mercury Steam Naviga tion Co. of Baku, which was subsidised by the Russian Government to carry mails, and whose ships were liable to be requisitioned for the transport of troops and war material. Some of the steamers of this company were built in England and Sweden and conveyed to the Volga in pieces. The total tonnage entered at Persian ports on the Caspian Sea between 1913 and 1916 (all of which was Russian) was:— Year. Tons. 1913-14 797,850 1914-15 752,617 1915-16 620,680 (b) Telegraphic and Wireless Communications I here is a submarine cable from Bushire to Fao and Karachi. An experimental wireless station was established at J ask in 1909 with a view to a larger scheme embracing all important points on the Persian Gulf and India. I his scheme has not yet materialised. (B) INDUSTRY (1) Labour Unskilled labour is plentiful in Persia wages normally amounting to about 1 kran 1 per diem.' Skilled 1 1 kran = about 4-k/.Persia] LABOUR 89 labour is confined almost entirely to the carpet manu facturing industry, where the wages paid to overseers amount to about 1^ kran per diem. Of the inhabitants of the country a large proportion are nomads or semi-nomads, owning only a nominal allegiance to the Persian Government. These nomads constitute the most virile portion of the population, but though they are grx&gt;d fighters they are poor work men. The Persian differs from the nomad in being a poor fighter, but resembles him in being an indifferent workman, his spirit having been crushed by conquest and bad government, or his energy sapped by opium and vice. There are no statistics of emigration from or immigration into Persia. (2) Agriculture The area of Persia is about 628,000 square miles or three times the size of France, but the proportion of cultivable land to wilderness and desert is small, and there are signs that it is steadily shrinking. The population probably does not exceed 9-| millions, of which between one and two millions are nomadic or semi-nomadic; the urban population is estimated at over one million. These figures, however, are conjec tural. There are no reliable data as to the proportion of the population engaged on the land, but probably between 80 and 90 per cent, are directly occupied in agricultural pursuits. No statistics are available as to the area under cultivation or as to the annual crops. It has been stated above that the deserts in Persia are increasing. That this is so is evidenced by the ruined cities and villages and the disused kanats (see p. 96), which are found in various localities. Com petent authorities are of opinion, however, that u water conservancy and irrigation, on a large scale and under scientific direction, were carried on, it would be possible not merely to arrest this process but to reclaim considerable portions of the desert. Agriculture in Persia is capable of enormous development; the soil is90 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [N o.8o extremely fertile, and, when water can be procured, gives a large return to the cultivator. Especially is this the case in south-west Persia. The plains north of Bushire and along the River Karun are a magnificent wheat ground, as is also the district of Kirmanshah. Unfortunately, the greed and ignorance of the rulers have prevented anything being done towards exploita tion. Messrs. Lynch Bros, built up a large grain trade at one time; then the profits which were being made excited the cupidity of the Governor of Arabistan and other governors. By many tricks known to Persian offic ialdom, such as the imposition of embargoes, whicli could be evaded by sufficiently large bribes, they'sought to transfer the profits to their own pockets, and so ruined the trade. (a) Products of Commercial Value The chief crops are wheat, barley, rice, a little maize and millet, sugar, cotton, silk, tobacco, opium, indigo, and henna. fo Ceieals mainly wheat and harley, are grown vv iciever the land is cultivated, but especially in the provinces on the western side of the country, where e mountains, which in winter are covered with snow, m spiing provide the moisture required by those crops. One reads of constant famine in Persia, u us is more the result of the absence of communica tions than of the general failure of crops. To prevent ammo, e Persian Government has in the past i /^ C11 ^ P e&lt; J an embargo on the export of grain, n!!. 1° 011 y r ® su ^ has been to leave the grain to rot in infrir aCe fi\\ 1 6 star ved in another, and it not about ^ a PP e . ns that while the price of wheat is rter owt n 1° W ln J^ lrmans hah, it is as much as 9^. of acnrini if 6 f n ' i J 1 s Pi te 0; f the thousands of acres wostf^n n!r] ir c a ^ an ying . idle ' principally in the in pxppoe n f f i 11 1_w ® st€r n districts, the wheat crop is e-ood oomTTmn - e f ne ^ ^ P 0 P u l a -tion, and, given done Oaf- n ^ lons ' a ^ ar g e export trade might be c. Oats and rye are not grown, and harley takes the(4^ Persia] AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS 91 place of oats as fodder for horses and cattle. Rice is largely cultivated in the low-lying strip bordering upon the Caspian Sea, whence it is exported to the Caucasus and northern Russia. This crop is also increasingly grown in Arabistan along the River Jarrahi, and it has for many years been cultivated on the River Karka, but the quality there is poor. A better quality is grown at Dizful. At present, however, the transport charges are so high that Persian rice costs as much delivered at Ahwaz as is charged for rice imported to that place from India. The bulk of the rice grown is, however, consumed locally, and next to wheat constitutes the staple diet of the peasants. Cotton is grown in Persia up to an elevation of 5,000 ft. above sea level. At such altitudes the summers are too short for the production of a long-stapled cotton; and, as the short-stapled variety is not good enough for the Indian and Manchester markets, before the war nearly the whole export went to Russia, whither Persian cotton was also attracted by a rebate amounting to over %\d. per lb., granted under the Russian tariff. Cotton is chiefly produced in Khorasan, but is also grown in central Persia in the provinces of Isfahan, Yezd, and Kashan. There are no figures of the total production or home consumption, but large quantities are consumed annually in the manufacture of carpets and native textiles. The value of the exports for the period 1908-1913 is shown by the following figures:— To Russia. To other countries. Total. £ £ £ 1908-09 803,000 45,000 848,000 1909-10 1,364,000 36,000 1,400,000 1910-11 1,368,000 40,000 1,408.000 1911-12 1,453,000 26,000 1,479,000 1912-13 1,683,000 23,000 1,706,000 Silk. —The production of silk in Persia has only recently recovered from a period of almost completer r 92 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No.so stagnation. In the sixties its annual value was about £1,000,000, but when disease broke out among silkworms (about 1870) the industry was practically ruined. In recent years, however, the import of silkworm eggs from Asia Minor has become more and more general, over 2,000,000 lbs. having been imported in 1902 as against 76,000 lbs. in 1893. The chief centres of production are the provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran. Silk is also produced at Yezd, Kashan, and Urumieh. The bulk is exported in cocoons to Marseilles and Milan, but steam reeling has recently been introduced. About 500 hands are engaged in spinning at Meshed. In addition to the export trade there is a large consumption of reeled silk and silk waste in Persia itself, mainly at Tabriz, Kashan, Isfahan, Yezd, Kirman, and Meshed; Some also is exported to Baghdad. Coarse silk tissues are manufactured at Gilan, and silk is also used in the car pet industry at Sultanabad and Isfahan. Opium is one of the chief sources of revenue to the I ersian Exchequer, and one of the most important exports. The opium poppy is cultivated chiefly at Isfahan felnraz Kirman, Yezd, Khorasan, and iimansJiali, and is an expensive and somewhat pre carious crop to grow, needing much labour, manure, and irrigation. Opium is exported to China, Great Britain, and America; m the two last-named countries its value c epcn s on the percentage of morphia it contains. 0 aC60 -~^here are two distinct varieties of -T C11 | | vat f ^ 111 Eersia, denominated respectively onf- Iv 11 .

Inferior wine and spirits are made in many other parts of the country. There is no export trade in wine, but dried grapes are exported in large quantities. Dates and melons are grown all along the southern coast and are largely exported. Indigo is grown in the south-west near Shustar and Dizful, and in Luristan. It is used in the dyeing of material for carpets. Henna, also used as a dye, is cultivated near Yezd and Kirman. There is a demand for it in Persia, and it is also exported to various parts of the East. Of the plants which are cultivated for medicinal purposes, the most important are gum trayacanth, gum arahic, and asafoetida. Domestic Animals. —Where there is no census of population a census of the animals is not to be expected, and no satisfactory estimate as to the number of animals in Persia can be given. Of horses there are several distinct breeds: the Turcoman horses in the north-east, weedy in appearance but possessed of great endurance; horses of the Cossack stamp in the north west; and, in the south-west and west, Arab horses. The best horses are obtained from Khorasan, Kirman- shah, and Hamadan. The Persian mule is celebrated for its excellence. Mules are chiefly bred by the nomad tribes, the best districts for the supply being the west and south-west. They have hardy constitutions and are capable of great endurance, and are used solely in the caravan traffic of the country. The best transport animal in Persia is the camel, and in the eastern and south -eastern districts it is the one principally used. The finest come from Khorasan, those from that district being noted for their size strength, and, owing to their long hair, for their ability to endure extreme cold. I he camels of southern Persia are smaller and more suitable for riding. Donkeys are found all over Persia and are in geneial use for transport purposes; they are imported m con-94 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 80 siderable numbers from Muscat and Bahrein. Though small, the Persian donkey is strong and enduring, and capable of carrying a heavy load. Bullocks of a small and sturdy type are used by the Bakhtiaris and Lur tribes for transport purposes, and also in other parts of south-western Persia. Besides animals used for transport there is a very large supply of live-stock, consisting mainly of sheej) and goats. These are maintained chiefly by the nomad tribes, both for the value of their wool and hair, and as a source of food supply. In winter the herds are to be found in the plains; as the weather becomes warmer they are driven up to higher and cooler pastures. There are several species of sheep in Persia, mostly of a small type: in many parts of the country they are kept chiefly for their milk, from which butter is largely made, and for their wool, of which in some parts of the country there are two clips, one in spring and the other in the autumn. Cattle are kept in considerable numbers in dis tricts where the grazing is good. They are generally of a small type. (b) Methods of Cultivation The implements of tillage in use are primitive in the extreme. The wooden plough, which is found in Mesopotamia, is also in use in Persia, but of modern agricultural implements the Persian is quite ignorant. Except in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf irrigation is carried on only by means of underground channels, known as kanats. The process of con structing a kanat is as follows. Experimental shafts are first sunk until a spring is tapped in high ground. I hen work is commenced from the point where water is required on the surface, and what a miner would call an adit is driven into the side of the hill to the point where the spring has been tapped. As the adit gets further and deeper underground, circular pits or shafts are opened from above at intervals of about 20 yards, by which the excavated soil is drawn up to thePersia] METHODS OF CULTIVATION 95 surface and heaped round the mouth of the shaft. In time the subterranean channel reaches the spring, and the water then flows out to the point at which it is required for the purposes of' irrigation. Kanats are found all over Persia, and the cultivable soil in the neighbourhood of the villages is as a rule the meeting- place of a number of kanat lines, often miles in length, radiating to the neighbouring mountains. This method, besides being primitive and quite inadequate for the needs of the country, is also very expensive, because, in addition to their initial cost, the sub terranean channels frequently collapse or become blocked, and have to be remade. A little irrigation on the ordinary lines is carried on in the areas commanded by the rivers Jarrahi (Abu Alia) and Hindian in the plains of Arabistan, and with proper management more might be done. The lower reaches of the Karun River afford abundant evidence that extensive irrigation was carried on in the neigh bourhood of that river in the past, and the opinion has been expressed that the practice might be revived with great advantage over the whole area commanded by the river below Shustar. The opinion has also been ex pressed that an important irrigation scheme is possible on the upper reaches of the Halil Rud (Darra-i-Dahr), which waters the Jaraft valley in the province of Kirman. It is stated that there are excellent sites for large dams, the building of which would result in a fourfold increase of the cultivable area in that region. If a good water supply were available here great quan tities of first-class cotton could be raised for the Indian market, and the production of wool could also be con siderably augmented. The areas where irrigation, in the ordinary sense of the term, is possible, are, however, limited. On the other hand, the conservation for irrigation, on the lines adopted in Ceylon, of the water which rushes down the mountain sides when the snow melts in the early spring, is certainly possible in many parts of Persia, and should be profitable.96 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No.so At present slow but steady desiccation is going on, and by degrees the deserts are conquering the culti vated portions of the country. Of this fact evidence remains in the dead villages and the lines of half obliterated kanat wells, which are to be found in the interior deserts of Kirman and in the wilderness of the Lut. After ordered government and better com munications, irrigation is Persia's most pressing neces sity. Given a sufficient supply of water, the country, which is now more than half desert but much of which possesses a perfect climate and a soil naturally fertile, would be a garden. (c) Forests It is said of Persia that, after Arabia, she ranks as the most treeless country in Asia, and, taking the country as a whole, this statement is true. There are, nevertheless, large areas of forest in the less-frequented parts, and in the neighbourhood of Mazandaran and Gilan there are fine forests from which timber has been exported for many years. Boxwood is exported from this region, the trade having for long been in Greek hands. There are oak forests also in Kurdistan, Luristan, and in the Bakhtiari district. The chief timber trees found in Persia are the alder, ash, beech, elm, hornbeam, maple, oak, and walnut. Nothing has been done to preserve or develop such forests as exist, and much damage is caused by the wanton burning of trees in order to clear ground for cultivation. Much timber is also used for charcoal- burning. The judicious planting of forests would, without question, be of great assistance in solving the problem of the desiccation of the country. (d) Land Tenure Landed property in Persia is of four kinds; (1) Crown lands; (2) lands held under a systemPersia] LAND TENURE 97 corresponding to the old feudal tenure; (3) religious endowments; (4) private property. (1) The Crown lands are very extensive. They are chiefly the result of ecclesiastical confiscation on a large scale in the eighteenth century, but have been further increased by the confiscation of private property on various grounds or by semi-compulsory gifts to the Crown. (2) Feudal lands are those which have been granted in times past on conditions of military service, chiefly to frontier tribes such as the Kurds of the Turcoman and Turkish borders. Their tenure is dependent upon the provision of a cavalry contingent and of outposts and guards; sometimes a monetary contribution to the revenue is also required. (3) The mosques and religious colleges possess large endowments both in landed property and in the rents of caravanserais, shops, and bazaars. For instance, the mosque of Imam Reza at Meshed possesses villages in all parts of the country, and derives from its posses sions an annual income which, apart from payments in kind, amounts to 60,000 tumans in cash. These estates are constantly augmented by the bequests of pious worshippers, and by secret agreements with public officials, who, in order to avoid the sequestration of their property, transfer it to the Church in return for a fixed life annuity. (4) Private property can be acquired by inheritance, by purchase, by gift from the Crown, or by right of reclamation from the desert. The State claims a per centage of the crop produced, but otherwise the estate is free and may be dealt with by the owner as he wishes. The Persian landlord does not as a rule farm his own property; it is let to tenants, who, without owning or claiming any proprietary rights, practically enjoy fixity of tenure so long as they pay the Persian equivalent of rent. This consists oi a portion of the produce of the land, is regulated by the amount of the respective contributions of the landlord and tenant to [285—98] • H98 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS the expenses, and varies in different parts of the country. In some districts the harvest is divided into five parts which are apportioned, one to the land, one to the water for irrigation, one to seed, one to labour, and one to bullocks; and if, as is often the case, the landlord provides cattle or seed, he receives the fifth appropriated to cattle or seed as well as that which he receives as rent for the land. (3) Fisheries The fisheries on the Caspian Sea are the property of the Persian Government, but are leased to a Russian firm, Messrs. Leonozoff, at an annual rental of about £18,400. The lease expires in 1925. A large proportion of the profit earned is derived from the sale of caviare. The value of the catch amounts annually to from £80,000 to £100,000. The climate of the Persian Grulf makes the curing of fish quite impossible, so that no industry is to be looked for in that direction. There are, however, valuable pearl fisheries on the coast above Lingeh, which are worked intermittently, the pearls being almost all bought by Indian traders. Shells (mother- of-pearl, mussel, and oyster) have in recent years been brought in increasing quantities by the fishing boats for export to Great Britain, Germany, and Russia, and before the war a German firm had established itself at Lingeh and Bush ire and was building up an export trade in shells. (4) Minerals Persia is said to be very rich in minerals, of which the most important are coal, copper, lead, iron, man ganese, zinc, nickel, cobalt, and petroleum. Owing to the absence of cheap and easy transport, and to the scarcity of water everywhere, attempts to work the mines by European methods and with European capitalPersia] MINERALS 99 have not as yet been successful; and, with the exception of the southern petroleum field, where the Anglo- Persian Oil Co. is now operating upon a large scale, and the turquoise mines near Nishapur, there is no mining industry properly so called. A few mines are worked by natives in a primitive manner and without any great outlay of capital. Particulars of the most important mineral deposits (with the exception of petroleum, which is dealt with separately) are given below under the regions in which they are found, for which purpose the division of the country into the six areas adopted by Lord Curzon has been followed. These areas are: (i) Azarbaijan; (2) the northern and southern slopes of the main Elburz Range between Rudbar (near Resht) and Astarabad; (3) Khorasan; (4) Kirman; (5) the districts lying between Kum and Shiraz, of which the most important are around Isfahan and Nain; and (6) the Persian Gulf littoral and islands. Taking these zones in their order:— (1) In Azarbaijan, iron, lead and copper ores exist in abundance, the richest district being Kara Dagh, where there are iron and copper mines. Lead, copper, and saltpetre have been produced from the Khalkhal region, and coal from a spot four miles north-east of Tabriz. In the Khamseh district there are deposits of copper, lead, coal, and mercury. (2) The slopes of the Elburz Mountains are particu larly rich in deposits of coal and iron found in close proximity. The most productive areas lie north-west of Teheran, between that town and Kazvin, north-east towards Demavend, and further east towards Shahrud. A number of coal mines are situated on the slopes half way between Teheran and Kazvin, and others in the Darbandisar district, and are worked clumsily and tentatively by native proprietors or by foreign lessees. Beyond supplying coal to Teheran the mines are not worked commercially. (3) In Khorasan there are abandoned copper mines at Ghurkani on the high road between Shahrud and [285—98] H 2100 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS rNo.so Meshed, and others are scattered all over the country but are hardly; worked. Good coal is reported 8 miles south of China,rin and in the neighbourhood of Isfarain. There are lead mines at Damghan, and copper, coal, and iron are also found near there. (4) There are deposits of coal at Basirgan 13 miles north of Kirman, at Deh Tagi 11 miles further north, and throughout the Kuhbaran district. Very rich manganese ore is found 60 miles from Kirman towards Ravar. (5) In the central districts the entire country between Kum and Isfahan contains mineral ores of considerable richness and variety. There is coal among the hills near Suh (Soh) and in the immediate neigh bourhood of Isfahan. At Gargaon, about 70 miles from Isfahan, iron and coal are plentiful, also at Ali Arab, 55 miles distant. Coal has been discovered also beyond Baft, east of Yezd, and is reported to be abun dant in the Abadeh district and near Yezd-i-Khast. Copper, lead, sulphur, asbestos, and manganese have been found in large quantities in the Anarek district. The mountains near Kum are rich in copper. (6) In the Persian Gulf littoral it was hoped that coal had been discovered in Dashtistan, north-east of Bushire, but this deposit has been classed as brown coal of no commercial value. In the Ramuz district there are deposits of bitumen, and further north near Shustar good indications of coal have been found. Hormuz Island and Kishm export rock salt and iron ochre. It is estimated that the former island contains at least a million tons of rock salt. There are sulphur mines at Khamir and Bustaneh near Lingeh and also in Hormuz Island. In addition to the above, gold, silver, tin, gypsum, and other minerals are found in different parts of the country. 1 1 Detailed particulars of these are given in a report made in 1913 by M. Brouard, a French engineer, who spent many years prospecting in Persia; also in the section which deals with Persia of the Handbtich der Regionalen Geologie by A. F. Stahl, published in 1911.Persia] MINERALS 101 The turquoise mines at Nishapur have been worked in a primitive manner for many years. According to De Lannay the mines are 14 in number, and in 1904-5 they were let for £5,000 per annum. The annual out put is valued at about £35,000, some 200 men being employed. There are two distinct areas in which petroleum is found; the first is in the extreme north of Azarbaijan along the Russian frontier, the general trend being from the north-west of Tabriz to Astara, and the second lies about a line running from the neighbourhood of Sulimanieh (Karij) in a south-easterly direction to the Persian Gulf. In the latter field, which alone has been exploited, oil has been found in quantity at Maidan-i- Naphtun, and has also been proved at Kasr-i-Shirin, whilst surface indications of petroleum have been ob served at White Oil Springs (near Ram Hormuz), Kishm, Daliki, Ahmadi, Rudan, Champa Kuh, Jask, and numerous other places. In 1901 the Persian Government granted an Englishman, Mr. D'Arcy, the exclusive right to bore for oil, except in the provinces of Azarbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Astarabad, and Khorasan: these excep tions were made because the Grand Vizier was afraid of giving umbrage to Russia. In the concession it was agreed to pay the Persian Government £20,000 sterling in cash, £20,000 sterling in paid-up shares, and 16 per cent, of the annual net profits. The concession runs for 60 years from May 28, 1901. An agreement was made between Messrs. D'Arcy and the Concessions Syndicate, Limited, on the one hand, and the Bakhtiari Khans on the other for the acquisition of the necessary land, the erection of buildings, &amp;c., and the guarding of the works and the projected pipe-line. For guarding these the Khans were to be paid £3,000; they were also allotted 3 per cent, of the shares fully paid up. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited (capital recently increased to £4,000,000), are the legal suc cessors of Mr. D'Arcy and his associates. Their con cessions over an area of some 500,000 square miles, of102 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No.so which only a very small portion has so far been examined. The company's production is at present obtained entirely from the Maidan-i-Naphtun district, lying 140 miles north-north-east of Mohammera and about 30 miles east-south-east of Shustar: the petro liferous area here is supposed to be about 3^ square miles in extent. From Maidan-i-Naphtun the oil has to be conveyed 150 miles by pipe-line to the refinery at Abadan, and materials have to be transported to the field by river and across a difficult tract of country by road. The pumping-station is situated at Tembi, 2| miles from the field. The pipe-line is 6 ins. in diameter as far as Wais (53 miles), and 8 ins. thence to Abadan, and has an estimated capacity of about 1,000 tons per diem. The line is patrolled from each of the stations, which have been placed at intervals of 20 miles, and there is telephonic communication between the field, the stations, and the refinery at Abadan. About 75 men are required for the working of the pumping-station and pipe-line. The total storage at the refinery, completed and under construction, will have a capacity of nearly 110,000 tons, of which 60,000 tons will be for crude oil. The refinery has 34 stills in operation, and is designed to deal with 400,000 tons of crude oil per annum. A steel jetty has been built on the river bank near the refinery, having -a depth of 25 ft. of water alongside at low water spring tide. Tank steamers load to only 18 ft. 6 ins. at the pier and take the remainder of their cargo from lighters below the bar of the Shatt el-Arab. It is expected that it will eventually be possible for vessels to load to a consider ably greater depth at the refinery. Ihe present workings are entirely under the charge of British subjects; skilled labour is mainly recruited from India, while the unskilled labourers are, in accordance with a provision of the concession, largely Persians, and no difficulty has hitherto been experi enced in securing an adequate supply. The agreements with the Khans for the policing of the field works and upper section of the pipe-line, and with the Sheikh ofPersia] MINERALS 103 Mohammera for the same service in connection with the refinery and the lower section of the pipe-line, have been carried out loyally and with satisfactory results. The material benefits obtained by the peasants in the form of regular employment and medical attention have had a considerable effect in producing a condition of tranquillity amongst a hitherto disturbed popula tion. In order to secure a supply of oil for fuel for the Admiralty, the British Government took a consider able financial interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany, and, in consideration of this financial support, conditions were made to secure to the Government a voice in the direction of the Company's general policy and in the supervision of the future development of the concession. (5) Manufacture The manufactures of Persia are very few and of a primitive nature. Many attempts have been made to establish manufactures in the country with foreign capital, but they have all been unsuccessful owing in most cases to the prohibitive cost of fuel or raw material, and until the means of communication in Persia are improved no other result can be expected. The following are the chief manufactures in the country at the present time:— Carpets. —The weaving of carpets is the greatest of Persia's industries, and is carried on in every part of the country, but more especially in the region round Ferhan and Sultanabad (Irak), and in Hamadan, Kur distan, Pars, Tabriz, Kirman, the Bakhtiari country, and Bashakard. There are factories in Kirman, Tabriz, and Sultanabad, but there and elsewhere the bulk of the weaving is carried on in the weavers' homes. The work is entirely done on handlooms, and for the most part by women and children, the 'manufacturer' indicating the design and supplying the quantities of wool required, so as to ensure the same shades of colours being used throughout. This practice is not satisfac tory, however, as the work is liable to be carelessly done,104 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 80 and the expensive wool supplied by the manufacturers is sometimes sold and inferior material substituted. The best results are obtained in the factories, where the work is done by men and boys under supervision. Women are not employed in factories to any extent, but there seems to be no reason why they should not be, under suitable conditions, and their employment would mean considerable economy of time and material. The weaving of a carpet takes a long time, as each stitch is separately woven. A good carpet contains 10,000, and the very best carpets as many as 40,000 stitches to the square foot. The patterns as a rule are very ancient and have been handed down from father to son for many generations. The woof is nearly always cotton, and is made from Manchester and Bombay yarn and twist; the warp and pile are wool'. The carpets are woven on upright looms, and are generally made in pairs. Silk carpets also are woven at Kirman. They are used for hangings and portieres, and are only made to order. They cost about two or three times as much as woollen carpets, and contain from 225 to 400 stitches to the square inch. Ihe wages paid to workmen in the factories vary considerably in different places. In Kirman the average is from 8 to 10 krans per month in addition to the midday meal, whilst an overseer gets from 40 to 50 krans per month according to his skill. Ihree English concerns are engaged in the manufac ture of carpets in Persia: Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co., of Manchester, who have branches at Sultanabad, Tabriz, and Teheran; the Oriental Carpet Co., Ltd., who are established at Kirman, Sultanabad, Tabriz, and leneran; and the Persian Carpet Manufacturing Co., Ltd., at Kirman. Shawls. Persian shawls made at Kirman from goats hair obtained from the nomads of Khorasan are amous ^ There are about 3,000 looms at Kirman engaged m this manufacture, the annual output being valued some years ago at about £60,000.Persia] MANUFACTURE 105 Other woollen fabrics produced in small quantities are material for the making of abbas, the cloaks in universal use in Persia. Woollen socks, gloves, &amp;c., are produced from home-spun and home-dyed wool. At Hamadan there are tanneries producing a con siderable quantity of leather made from goat and sheep skins. This finds a ready sale throughout the country, and is even exported to Russia. Rosewater is manufactured in the neighbourhood of Kashan, and in Ears, chiefly at Maimand, and is ex ported to India and Java. (6) Power % It is stated that a hydro-electric plant has recently been installed at Shiraz for electric lighting purposes. This is the only installation of the kind in Persia, excepting such as have been put up by the Anglo- Persian Oil Co. in connexion with their business. The possibilities for the extensive use of water power in Persia are not great, inasmuch as the majority of such rivers as the country possesses are in the summer reduced to insignificant streams, where they are not actually dried up. (C) COMMERCE (1) Domestic The domestic trade of Persia is quite unimportant. Poverty is very general in the country, the wants of the inhabitants are simple, and the deficiencies of com- munication are such as to make the easy interchange of commodities impossible. The bazaar is a feature of every important town, but the goods displayed for sale are nearly all of foreign manufacture. Taking Persia as a whole, Jews do not occupy a very important position in the trade of the country, but this statement is not equally true of all parts: at Bushire, for instance, there is a prosperous Jewish element.i 100 li : 11 i ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (a) Principal Towns 1 [No. 80 Hamadan, in the province of Irak-Ajami, is situated about 6,000 ft. above sea level, some 180 miles south west of Teheran. It lies on the edge of a fertile plain, producing much wheat and barley. It is a popular trading centre, and the tanneries there are stated to be the best in Persia. Other manufactures are copper- ware and red and white wine. The population is estimated at 50,000, of which probably 12,000 are Turks and 5,000 Jews. The possession of the reputed tombs of Esther and Mordecai makes the town a place of pilgrimage for members of the latter race. The Russian Banque d'Esoompte de Perse, and the Imperial Bank of Persia, both have branches at Hamadan. Isfahan, the capital of the province of the same name, is situated on the left bank of the Zindeh Rud. It stands at an elevation of about 5,300 ft. above sea level. The population is computed at 80,000, but is probably rather more. The city is a large emporium of trade, and its bazaars are very extensive and are covered in. The industries of the town are the manu facture of woven fabrics, ornamental trinkets, guns, pistols, sword blades, and silk and woollen carpets. At one time all imports to Isfahan came through Bushire and bhiraz, but the unrest on the route from Bushire to Isfahan has caused merchants to adopt Moham- mera and the Lynch road as the route for forwarding goods. Ihe Imperial Bank of Persia and the Banque d Escompte de Perse have branches at Isfahan. Kashan is situated about 128 miles south of Teheran and 111 miles north of Isfahan on the main trade route from north to south. 1 he population is between 20,000 and 30,000. Ihe chief industries are metal work and silk and velvet work. Kazvin stands about 90 miles west-northnwest of Teheran on the road to Resht and the Caspian port of Enzeh. The population is estimated at 40,000, and 1 Excluding ports, for which see pp. 81-88. |iS 3' fjk® ifisfia: itena. pi ^isi * 1 %PRINCIPAL TOWNS 107 contains a strong Turkish element. There is a con siderable amount of traffic through Kazvin to and from the Caspian Sea. The manufactures consist of swords and other arms. Kirman, the capital of the province of Kirman, is an important trade centre, though it stands practically surrounded by deserts. The population is between 50,000 and 75,000, and includes about 1,500 Parsees. The carpets manufactured at Kirman are famous; the only other manufacture of importance is that of shawls. The Imperial Bank of Persia has a branch in this town. Kirmanshah, the capital of the province of that name, is the centre of the trade, both import and export, which passes through Baghdad, about 220 miles distant. It lies in a fertile valley, and in normal times large quantities of grain are produced in the neighbourhood. The population, which is esti mated at 80,000, is mainly engaged in agriculture, though there is a very large trade in wool and skins obtained from the flocks of the nomads. The Imperial Bank of Persia and the Banque d'Escompte de Perse both have branches at Kirmanshah. Meshed, the capital of the province of Khorasan, lies about 550 miles east of Teheran. In addition to being the distributing centre for the province of Khorasan, it does a large trade with Russia, India, and Afghanistan. The fixed population is probably about 80,000, but there is always a large additional external element in the town, owing to the fact that Meshed is a holy city of the Shiah (Shi'a) Moham medans. The chief industries are carpet-making, shawl and silk-weaving, and stone-working. The Imperial Bank of Persia and the Banque d'Escompte de Perse have branches at Meshed. Resht (Rasht), the capital of the province of Gilan, is situated about 6^ miles inland from Enzeli, the most important Persian port on the Caspian Sea. The town is consequently the centre of a considerable export trade from the rice-producing provinces which border on the Caspian Sea; an export trade in silk has alsoioy ECONOMIC CONDITIONS grown up in recent years. The population is estimated at between 40,000 and 50,000, and is likely to increase. Shiraz, the capital of Fars, lies 180 miles north-east of Bushire in a fertile, well-watered plain. Until recently it was an important centre of trade in transit between Bushire and Isfahan, but this trade has recently been diverted to Mohammera. The popula tion of the town is about 60,000, and includes about 7,000 Jews. The local manufactures consist of rough carpets, tents, curtains, arms of various kinds, and footwear. The district also produces a wine of some note. There is a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Shiraz. Tabriz, the capital of the province of Azarbaijan, lies half way between Teheran and Tiflis. It is the most important trading centre in Persia, being on the route to Erzerum and Trebizond in Turkey, and to Julfa and Tiflis in the Caucasus. The population is over 200,000. It is at present the terminus of the only commercial railway in Persia, viz., the extension south from Julfa of the Russian railway from Tiflis. Both the Banque d'Escompte de Perse and the Imperial Bank of Persia have branches at Tabriz. Teheran, the capital of Persia, is situated at the southern foot of the Elburz Mountains. The popula tion is estimated at about 280,000, and includes a large number of Jews and Armenians, and about 500 Europeans, leheran is the seat of the Government, and shows a curious mixture of western and oriental leatures. The town has metalled and watered roads, a tramway, and gas works; yet the houses consist largely of the ordinary Persian mud hovels. There are no industries of any importance. The Banque Escompte de Perse and the Imperial Bank of Persia nave each a branch at Teheran. Yezd lies roughly half-way between Isfahan and Kir man. I he population is put at 60,000 to 70,000, an among these Parsees form an important com munity there being probably 7,000 in and around the own. Except m the quarter inhabited by the Parsees,i Persia] PRINCIPAL TOWNS 109 where conditions are better, the streets are narrow, dirty, and unpaved, and are half filled with sand. The houses have often two underground stories. Commer- 11 cially, Yezd is the most important point on the caravan route, 1,000 miles in length, between Bandar Abbas and Meshed. Its main business is the receiving and le W forwarding of goods. The only export of importance is opium, and weaving is the chief industry. The Imperial Bank of Persia has a branch there. (b) Foreign Interests There are only two foreign Powers which possess any vested interests of importance in Persia, namely, Great Britain and Russia. Those possessed by Russia are the outcome of a State policy, the object of which was to capture the trade of Persia, and thus control the country for political purposes; consequently. Russian interests have been mainly financed by Russian btate money. The British interests, on the other hand, are the result of private enterprise, and are part of the natural expansion of the Gulf trade which was estab lished by the East India Company many years ago. The following are the principal Russian interests:— (1) Road concessions from the Caspian Sea and the Russian frontier to Teheran, &amp;c. (see pp. 67 ' 68 )- , . • , (2) The Julfa-Tabnz railway concession, and incidental mining rights (see p. 72). (3) Banque d'Escompte de Perse (see p. 120). (4) Fishing interests in the Caspian Sea (see p. 98). (5) The maritime trade of the Caspian Sea (see p. 88). The British interests are:— (1) The Indo-European Telegraph Department and the Indo-European Telegraph Co., Ltd. (see pp. 73, 74). (2) The Imperial Bank of Persia (see p. 119). (3) The maritime trade of the Persian Gulf (see pp. 82, 85).110 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No.so (4) The Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd. (see p. 101). (5) Messrs. Lynch Bros.' concessions on the Karun river and the Lynch road from Ahwaz to Isfahan (see pp. 69-71). (6) The Persian Railway Syndicate's concession (see p. 73). (7) The interests of Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co., the Oriental Carpet Co., and the Persian Carpet Manufacturing Co. at the chief centres of the carpet industry (see p. 104). (8) A number of British-Indian trading concerns in Sistan and Khorasan, at Kirman, and along the route to Bandar Abbas. Down to the outbreak of war Germany had no large interests in Persia, though the firm of Robert Wonck- haus &amp; Co., the agents of the Hamburg-America Line, had established themselves at Mohammera, and were beginning to push German trade up the Karun river and to Isfahan. (c) Methods of Economic Penetration There has been no systematic penetration of Persia by any other foreign country than Russia. As has been stated above, the Russian Government from the year 1890 onwards has actively fostered trade with Persia, and 1ms been so successful in her efforts that the aggregate import and export trade between the two countries for the nine years ending 1914-15 amounted to over 50 per cent, of the total trade (import and ex port) of Persia for that period. This result has been brought about by the following methods:— (1) In 1903 Russia succeeded in negotiating with Persia a new Customs tariff, which substituted for the 5 per cent, ad valorem tariff imposed by the Treaty of Turkmanchay, a system of specific duties affecting certain articles to a greater extent than others. This tariff was so drawn that in effect it was equivalent to an ad valorem scale of less than 3f per cent, on Russian trade, but on British trade of a&amp; Persia] ECONOMIC PENETRATION 111 little over 9-| per cent., and on trade with other countries taken together of over 10 per cent. Under the old system ot taxation by value, British goods, which on arrival were less costly than Russian goods, as a rule entered the country more cheaply; whereas under the new system a ton of cheap British piece- goods paid the same duty as a ton of dear Russian goods of the same kind. It was the same with the ex ports. Some of the chief items of Persian produce taken by the British Empire were wheat, grain, lin seed, sesame, and opium. On these the new tariff added from 3f to 20 per cent, to the taxes, whilst exports for which Russia was the chief customer, such as rice and cotton, were either freed from taxation or had the tax reduced to a nominal amount. (2) Special through rates were granted by Russia for Russian goods going to Persia, and a steamship line running between Odessa and the Persian Gulf was heavily subsidised. At the same time transit in bond was refused to foreign goods forwarded to Persia via Russia. (3) The Ban que d'Escompte de Perse has been an important agent of Russian trade. Being connected with the Russian State Bank, it was to some extent independent of profit. It devoted particular attention to the import of Russian cotton textiles, and came to the assistance of merchants who could not afford to pay the Customs duties and dues immediately. It made a practice of taking up the invoices and clearing and warehousing the goods, charging only 2 per cent, com mission. (4) A refund of duties previously imposed was granted by Russia on certain exports to Persia, e.g., sugar, which formed quite one-third of the exports from Russia to Persia, got a refund of 175 rubles per pud (36-1 pounds). In addition to the advantages obtained by these methods, Russia has been favoured by the fact that the wants of the average Persian are very similar to those of the Russian, and it has not been found necessary to112 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS any great extent to provide a special class or style of goods to meet the requirements of a particular market. (2) Foreign Xhe returns of the export and import trade of Persia for the years 1906-7 to 1914-15 are given in Table I of the Appendix (p. 140). During that period the exports averaged £6,933,000, and the imports £8,877,000. In no year did the exports exceed the imports, and the tendency has been for the disparity to increase upon the wrong side. The volume of trade was increasing before the war. In 1904 the total trade of Persia amounted to about £10,500,000; in 1913-14 it was almost £20,000,000, the difference being the result of a general expansion of trade, and not due to any unusual circumstance. (a) Exports Statistics showing the values of the principal articles exported from Persia during the years 1910-11 to 1914- 15 and the amount of her trade with the principal countries during the same period are given in Tables II and III of the Appendix (pp. 141-2). The chief item is raw cotton, the export of which in 1906-7 amounted to over 46,000,000 krans (£840,000)/ and in 1913-14 to over 85,000,000 krans (£1,500,000), a figure which is, however, less than that for the previous year. Fruits form Persia's next most important item of export. The trade consists mainly of grapes, which are dried and sold to Russia and Turkey, and of melons and dates. The export trade in fruit shows no expansion in recent years, and for the four years ending in 1915 averaged 56,000,000 krans or £1,000,000 sterling. The export of woollen carpets averaged about 47,000,000 krans or £840,000 for the four years ending 1 Lack of uniformity in the reduction of krans to sterling is due to the extreme instability of the value of the kran, which between the years 1901 and 1912 varied from 50 to 61 to'^l.Persia] EXPORTS 113 in 1915. The trade of 1915 was affected by the Great War, and amounted to less than half that of the preceding year. This branch of trade is, however, expanding. The export of rice has increased very much in recent years, the figures for the four years ending in 1915 showing an average annual export value of 44,000,000 krans (£780,000), as against an average value of 26,000,000 krans for the four years ending in 1910. Other exports of importance are opium, wool, silk, raw hides, and gums. The export of fish has fallen off in recent years to a marked degree, the annual figures, which averaged 25,000,000 krans for the four years ending in 1910, only reaching an average of 8,000,000 krans for the four years ending in 1915. Countries of Destination. —Russia normally takes over 50 per cent, of the goods exported from Persia, the value of her purchases for the five years ending in 1915 averaging just under £5,000,000 sterling. These purchases included practically the whole of the export of raw cotton (&lt;?/. p. 91), the very small quantity which was not bought by Russia going to British India, the whole of the export of rice and a large proportion of the fruit, skins and furs, live animals, silk manu factures, fish, and gums. Turkey, Persia's next best customer, purchased carpets, for which Turkey has always been the chief market, also opium, gum, wheat, tobacco, and recently petroleum. Next came the British Empire (excluding India and Egypt), taking large quantities of opium, and also gums, wheat, carpets, and petroleum. The volume of the export trade with the British Empire is very small compared with that don© with Russia, amounting to an average of only £585,000 for the five years ending in 1915, against Russia's average of £4,974,000 during the same period. However, the exports to the British Empire are increasing, and with the British established in Mesopotamia the near future should see a very considerable change. [285—98] i114 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INo. 80 British India, considering her geographical proximity to Persia, is not a large purchaser, the trade, which is in pearls, fruits, drugs, wool, and recently petroleum, averaging only £438,000 for the five years ending in 1915. The exports from Persia to other countries than those mentioned are unimportant. (b) Imports Table IV of the Appendix (p. 143) gives statistics of the principal articles imported into Persia between 1910-11 and 1914-15, and Table V (p. 144) the share of the dilferent countries in the trade. Ihe two most important items of import are cotton manufactures and sugar. Normally, these two com modities taken together represent in value about half of the total imports. If we except the year 1914-15, when conditions were abnormal, the import of cotton manufactures shows a steady increase in recent years, and in 1913-14 the highest figure so far recorded was reached, viz., 203,000,000 krans (£3,625,000 sterling). Ihe increase in the import of sugar is even more marked, the value having risen from about £1,761,000 m 1907-08 to about £3,040,000 in 1913-14. This in crease i§ in a measure due to the growth of the popu larity of tea as a beverage throughout Persia. The other chief imports are tea, flour, woollen goods, petroleum, dyes, iron and steel manufactures, and mixed textile fabrics. Countries of Origin.—In the import trade Russia is again consideiably ahead of all rivals. For the five yea is ending in 1915 her exports to Persia averaged over £5,000,000 sterling, and the trade was on the in crease. Of this total about £2,000,000 annually was represented by sugar, and £1,450,000 by cotton manu- tactures. Russia also exported a considerable quantity of tea, and supplied the bulk of Persia's reouirements m other directions.Persia] IMPORTS 115 The imports from the British Empire (exclusive of India) consisted mainly of cotton yarns and manu factures. Of a total export trade from the British Empire to Persia, averaging annually about £2,000,000 sterling. Cotton goods have averaged £1,178,000 for the five years 1910-1911 to 1914-15. Other textiles in which a considerable trade is done by the British Empire are woollen yarns and manufactures, silk goods, and mixed textiles. Sugar is a small but increasing item. The exports of iron and steel manufactures to Persia have been abnormally large in recent years, owing to the requirements of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The statistical returns show that the export trade from the British Empire to Persia, though liable to considerable fluctuations, was in the main holding its own before the outbreak of war, though it failed to develop fresh markets or increased consumption. British India is dealt with separately in the statis tical returns. The export trade to Persia shows a small expansion during the period under review, but the pro gress is not satisfactory if the close geographical proximity and the number of Indian traders who are established in Southern Persia are taken into con sideration. Before the European War the trade amounted to a little over £1,000,000 sterling annually, and consisted chiefly of cotton yarns and manufactures, tea, sugar, dyes, and rice. German exports to Persia show considerable expan sion since 1908, as a result of the inauguration of the subsidised service of the Hamburg-America Line to the Gulf in that year. In the period 1909-13 they rose from an annual value of about £125,000 to about £542,000, representing a miscellaneous trade, in which the largest elements were sugar, chemicals, and silk, woollen, and cotton textiles. Of the other countries exporting goods to Persia the most important before the war were Turkey (about £398,000 annually), France (£250,000), Belgium (£186,000), Austria (£166,000), and Italy (£60,000). [285—98] I 2116 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (c) Customs Before the year 1900 the Persian Customs were farmed out to the highest bidder; the result was not satisfactory to the Treasury, though no doubt it was so to the holder of the post of collector. The financial difficulties in which Persia found herself at the end of the nineteenth century induced her to undertake measures for the adoption of a more profitable system, to which end application was made to the Belgian Government for the loan of a staff of Belgian officials. This request was complied with, and as a tentative measure the Customs houses of the provinces of Azarbaijan and Kirmanshah were entrusted to the Belgians. The plan answered so well that in 1900 the farm system was abolished and the new regime was applied to the whole country. The consequence was a marked increase in the Customs revenue, which in 1901 amounted to nearly £320,000, whereas under the old system it had seldom reached more than £200,000. In 1902-03 it was £418,000 gross and £380,000 net. The receipts were further increased by the new tariff, which was introduced in 1903, but there has since been a falling off, owing to the state of disorganization into which the country has fallen. (d) Tariffs The tariff now in force in Persia is that which was substituted in 1903 for the old 5 per cent, ad valorem tariff previously in force. It was drawn up by M. Naus, a Belgian official, then in the employ of the Persian Government and a protege of the ^ Russian Government, and has already been described (see p. 110). Besides being so arranged as unduly to favour Russian interests at the expense of British, this tariff has one important fault, namely, that the average rate of duty is so low as to make the actual collection of the revenues and the proper safeguarding of the frontiersi Persia] TARIFFS 117 an unreasonably heavy burden upon the Persian Government in comparison with the revenues obtained; and the opinion has been expressed that the rates might be increased in such a manner as to bring in double the amount at present obtained without undue hardship being inflicted upon traders. (D) FINANCE (1) Public Finance The latest available figures of the revenue and expenditure of Persia are the following:— Revenue £ 1911-12 2,042,850 1912-13 1,055,792 Expenditure 1911-12 1,608,600 1912-13 1,480,778 The revenue is derived from taxation, customs, rents and leases, and the receipts from Crown lands. More than half of it consists of payments in cash or kind, raised by assessments upon towns, villages, and dis tricts ; each of these has to contribute a certain sum, the amount of which is revised from time to time by the tax-assessors appointed by the Government. Almost all the burden of this taxation is borne by the labouring classes Taxes are of three kinds: land tax, herd tax, and trade tax. The land tax is the main source of revenue. It is levied on all landed property, excepting lands held on the basis of feudal service and religious endow ments, the principle being that one-fifth of the pioduce of all'land belongs to the Crown. The system of pay ment, however, varies in different parts of the country.118 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS About one-fifth of the land tax is paid in kind, usually cereals. In normal times it is expected to produce £1,000,000 per annum, but recently the amount obtained has been considerably below that figure. It is estimated that the revenue obtained from this source might easily be doubled by the abolition of the corrupt bureaucracy and the establishment of an equitable system of land settlement. The herd tax is supplementary to the land tax, except in the case of those nomad tribes who do not practise agriculture systematically, but nevertheless possess considerable wealth in their herds, when it forms the sole method of obtaining contribution to the revenue. The trade tax, which is levied on shopkeepers and artisans, is not assessed on a uniform basis, but in some places takes the form of a poll tax, and elsewhere that of a tax upon profits. The Persian Customs have been dealt with above (see p. 116). The amounts received in recent years from that source are as follows:—1913-14, £861,872; 1914-15, £589,197; 1915-16, £491,637. The receipts have, of course, been adversely affected bv the war. The revenue which falls under the heading of rents and leases is mainly derived from institutions or con cessions, owned or leased out by the Government. Of these the Mint is worth about £50,000 a year; while the post, telegraphs, passports, mines, profits of con cessions, Caspian fisheries, &amp;c., may, perhaps, be worth an additional £100,000 annually. The revenue from Crown lands is obtained in a manner very similar to that in use with the land tax, but is invariably paid in kind, and is determined by the relative contributions of the State and the lease holder to the expenses of the cultivation. The foreign debt of Persia at the present time is approximately £6,000,000, exclusive of arrears of interest. Of this sum about £2,800,000 is owinp to Great Britain, India, or the Imperial Bank of Persia and the balance to the Russian Government.Persia] FINANCE (2) Currency 119 The unit of money is the kran, a silver coin weighing 7104 grains troy; its value varies with the price of silver. At the present time the coinage in circulation is nickel, silver, and gold, the copper coinage having been withdrawn in 1900. It consists of the following:— Nickel—1 and 2 shahi pieces (1 shahi = l/20 kran). Silver—5 and 10 shahi pieces; 1, 2, and 5 kran pieces. Gold—J, 1, 2, 5, and 10 tumans. The gold coinage is not in general use owing to its ever-varying silver value. The silver tuman has a value of 10 krans, the gold tuman of 22 krans. The above is the general currency of Persia, and Persian money was before the late war accepted in Mesopotamia, Afghanistan, and Trans-Caspia. There are, however, local variations; for instance, the nickel coins are not accepted in Khorasan, but the old copper coins are in use. The exchange value of the kran has for many years been liable to violent fluctuations, but a fair rate for the purpose of calculating the exchange into sterling is 55 krans to £1. The fluctuating exchange value of the kran has been, in the past, a serious handicap to trade with Persia, and it is very important that some attempt should be made to provide a satisfactory means of steadying the exchange in the future. (3) Banking There are at present only two banks established in Persia, viz., the Imperial Bank of I ersia and the Russian Banque d'Escompte de Perse. The -Imperial Bank of Persia was incorporated by Royal British Charter in 1889. Its present capital is £650,000 in shares of £6 10s., which are fully paid. The capital may be increased to £3,000,000. The Bank has the right to issue bank-notes in Persia to120 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS the extent of the paid-up capital, guaranteed by a metallic reserve of 33 per cent, of the amount in cir culation. The Bank is limited as regards the amount which it may advance to the Persian Government to one-third of its paid-up capital. The dividends have in recent years varied from 8^. to 105. per share except in 1912, when there was a drop to 45. There are branches or agencies in all the important towns of Persia. I he Imperial Bank of Persia is the most important British institution in the country, both politically and commercially, and has in the past rendered valuable service. The British mercantile community in South Persia seem to be fairly satisfied with the treatment which they have received from the Bank, but the opinion has been expressed in other quarters that the Bank has not been conducted with sufficient regard for the interests of Great Britain, and it seems clear that more might be done to finance traders in the country on the lines adopted by the Bank's Russian rival. Hie Kussian Banque d Escompte de Perse, as ahead} stated, is (or was) connected with the Russian State Bank, and is virtually a department of the Russian Government. The headquarters are at Teheran, and there are branches or agencies in all the important towns in Persia. The Bank has, in the past, made large loans to the Persian Government, secured upon the Customs receipts, and as an instance of the political nature of this institution may be cited the condition, attached to these loans, that Persia should contract no loan with any foreign Power with out the consent of Russia for a period of ten years dating from 1900. Commercially, the Banque d Escompte de 1 erse has been an important agent of the Russian commercial policy in Persia. In 1906 the Deutsche Orient Bank obtained from the Shah a concession to open branches at Teheran and Tabriz. This concession was confirmed by the National Assembly aftei the Revolution, but was made subject to the condition that the Bank must be opened within(g) GENERAL REMARKS 121 three years, it therefore lapsed in July 1909, no branch having been opened by that date. (E) GENERAL REMARKS Persia, a country rich in minerals and possessing potential wealth in the soil, should, under favourable conditions, have a great future. First and foremost she needs improved communications, next she needs ordered government, and lastly she needs financial support sympathetically given. Recommendations as to the lines upon which British trade in Persia should be developed are contained in the report made to the Board of Trade by Messrs. Holland and Wilson in 1917. Owing to the military situation at the time at which this report was made, it was not possible to treat the questions which are involved in a consideration of the commercial future of Persia upon the basis of recent up-to-date information, and the report assumes that the spheres of influence established by the Anglo-Russian Agreement in 1907 will remain in existence, and that British and British- Indian trade with Persia will be based upon the Persian Gulf, and will be limited by the terms of that agreement. The present time, however, presents to Great Britain an opportunity of laying plans for extending her interests in Persian trade from that point which offers the best prospects of substantial results, namely, Baghdad. The bulk of Persia's wealth and trade is in the north-west, and a railway pushed through to Hamadan would do much towards the solution of the problem of transport, which is the initial difficulty to be overcome. If the promotion of commerce is to con tribute to the solution of Great Britain s political problems, the present is the time to attempt it, and a far-seeing railway policy would in the end probably prove the most economical method of procedure. Other recommendations made in the report of Messrs. Holland and Wilson as necessary for them ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 80 development of British and Indian trade in Persia are the following:-- (1) The amelioration of the Customs tariff. (2) Improved arrangements for the collection of commercial intelligence. (3) The encouragement of education in Persia by the institution of schools. (4) Improvement in business methods. It is, however, important that any steps to the ends desired should only be taken after careful considera tion of the position of Persia in relation to Mesopo tamia and India, with due regard to the questions of railway gauges already mentioned. It seems eminently desirable, therefore, that a small expert Commission should be appointed at an early date to enquire into and report upon the problems involved.126 APPENDIX [No. 80 As regards the first Great Britain promised to maintain the present political status of Afghanistan, to influence it only in a pacific sense, and not to take, or encourage the Afghans to take, any measures threatening Russia. Russia, on her part, recog nised Afghanistan as being outside her sphere of influence, ami undertook to send no agents thither, but to conduct all political relations through the intermediary of His Britannic Majesty's Government. The fifth and last article of this portion of the Agreement declared that '' the present arrangements will only come into force when His Britannic Majesty's Government shall have notified to the Russian Government the consent of the Amir to the terms stipulated above.' This consent, as a matter of fact, was never given, and this part of the Agreement therefore re mained null and void. As regards Tibet, it was stipulated that the status quo, in the maintenance of which Great Britain was admitted to have a , special interest, should be maintained; that there should be no interference on either part with her territorial integrity; that Chinese suzerainty should be recognised; that (with certain ex ceptions touching commercial matters in the case of Great Britain) all negotiations should be through the intermediary of the Chinese Government; and that neither Great Britain nor Russia should send representatives to Lhassa, or seek any concessions, or estab lish any claim over the revenues of Tibet, either in cash or in kind. Persia, the largest, most civilised, and historically the most im portant of the three Asiatic kingdoms concerned, fared the worst in the Agreement. She was divided by two imaginary lines jnto three zones or spheres, a northern sphere wherein Russian in terests were recognised as predominant; a much smaller south eastern sphere wherein British interests were regarded as predomi nant; and a neutral sphere, including southern and south-western Persia, with a comparatively narrow north-easterly prolongation, extending right across Persia, and forming a complete buffer or barrier between the so-called Russian and British ' spheres of influence.' The line forming the southern limit of the ' Russian sphere started on the west at Kasr-i-Shirin, on the Turco-Persian frontier, passed through but included Isfahan, Yezd, and Kakh, and terminated at a point on the Persian frontier at the intersec tion of the Russian and Afghan frontiers. The line bounding the British sphere started at Gazik, on the Afghan frontier, thence ran almost due west to Birjand, thence through the inhospitable desert of the Dasht-i-Lut to Kirman, and thence to Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf. Each of the ' High Contracting Parties undertook to seek for no political or commercial conces sions in the sphere of the other, while the ' neutral sphere ' was to be open to both.Persia] APPENDIX 127 II.—TRANSLATION OF A MEMORANDUM CONCERNING THE ANGLO-RUSSIAN AGREEMENT TRANSMITTED BY THE BRITISH MINISTER AT TEHERAN TO THE PERSIAN MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Sept. 1907). Although in the preamble to the Anglo-Russian Agreement (about which, unlike Afghanistan, Persia was not consulted) the High Contracting Powers ' 'mutually engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia .... sincerely desiring the preservation of order throughout that country, and its peaceful development, as well as the permanent establishment of equal advantages for the trade and industry of all other nations,' it nevertheless caused the greatest alarm and consternation amongst all classes of Persians as soon as it became known to them; an anxiety justified by the course of events in Morocco, where similar benevolent phrases had been the immediate prelude to the loss of independence. To calm their apprehensions the late Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, then British Minister at Teheran, addressed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on September, 5, 1907 (i.e., five days after the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement), an explanatory memorandum (ydd-ddsht), in Persian, which was published nine days later in the Habhi'l-Matin and other papers, and of which the translation is as follows; — ' Information has reached me that the report is rife in Persia that the result of the Agreement concluded between England and Russia will be the intervention of these two Powers in Persia, and the partition of Persia between them. ^ our Excellency is aware that the negotiations between England and Russia are of a wholly different character, since the MushiruT-Mulk recently visited both St. Petersburg and London, and discussed the matter with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of both Powers, who explicitly declared to him the objects aimed at by their respective Governments in Persia, which assurances he has no doubt duly reported. ' Sir Edward Grey has informed me of the substance of his conversations with the Mushfru'l-Mulk, and also of the substance of M. Isvolsky's declarations, officially communicated to the British Government. ^ ' Sir Edward Grey informs me that he has explained to the Mushi'ru'l-Mulk that he and M. Isvolsky are completely in accord on two fundamental points. _ ' Firstly, neither of the two Powers will interfere in the affairs of Persia unless injury is inflicted on the persons or property of their subjects. ' Secondly, negotiations arising out of the Anglo-Russian Agreement 'must not violate the integrity and independence of Persia. o128 APPENDIX [No. 80 Sir Edward Grey also observes that hitherto antagonism has existed between England and Eussia, each of whom has endeavoured to prevent the continuance of the other in Persia, and had this antagonism been prolonged in the present uncertain state of Persia, one or both of these two Powers might have been tempted to interfere in the internal affairs of Persia, so as not to allow the other to profit by the existing state of things, or to profit by it to the detriment of others. The object of the pre sent negotiations between England and Eussia is to prevent such difficulties from arising between them; and these negotia tions are in truth in no wise directed against Persia, as M. Isvolsky has clearly explained to the Mushiru'l-Mulk, saying, Neither of the two Powers seeks anything from Persia, so that Persia can concentrate all her energies on the settlement of her internal affairs.' Both Ministers are entirely in accord as to the policy of non-intervention in Persia, and have left no possible ground for doubt in the matter. M. Isvolsky's words, which include the intentions of England, are as follows: ' Eussia's general principle will be to refrain from any kind of inter vention in the internal affairs of other countries so long as nothing injurious to her interests is done; and it is quite impossible that she should deviate from this principle in this present case.' As to the reported partition of Persia between Eussia and England, concerning which it is asserted that the two Powers above-mentioned wish to define spheres of influence for them selves, Sir Edward Grey and M. Isvplsky have explicitly declared that these reports have no foundation. What the two Powers desire is to come to an agreement which will prevent future difficulties and disputes from arising, by guaranteeing that neither Power will aim at acquiring influence in those parts of Persia which are adjacent to the frontier of the other. This Agreement is injurious neither to the interests of Persia nor to those of any other foreign nation, since it binds only England and Eussia not to embark on any course of action in Persia calculated to injure the interests of the other, and so in the future to deliver Persia from those demands which in the past have proved so injurious to the progress of her political aspirations This is what M. Isvolsky says; ' ' This Agreement between the two European Powers which have the greatest interests in Persia, based as it is on a guarantee of her independence and integrity, can only serve to further and promote Persian interests, for henceforth Pe'rsia, aided and assisted by these two powerful neighbouring States, can employ all her powers in internal reforms.' From the above statements you will see how baseless and unfounded are these rumours which have lately prevailed in Persia concerning the political ambitions of England and Eussia in this country. The object of the two Powers in making thisPersia] APPENDIX 129 Agreement is not in any way to attack, but rather to assure for ever the independence of Persia. Not only do they not wish to have at hand any excuse for intervention, but their object in •these friendly negotiations was not to alloiv ^ne another to inter vene on the pretext of safeguarding their interests. The two Powers hope that in the future Persia will be for ever delivered from the fear of foreign intervention, and will thus be perfectly free to manage her own affairs in her own way, whereby advantage will accrue both to herself and to the whole world.' HI.—JOINT NOTE ADDEESSED BY THE BEITISH AND EUSSIAN EEPEE SENT ATI VE S AT TEHEEAN TO THE PEESIAN GOVEENMENT ON SEPTEMBEE 11, 1907. T he Governments of Great Britain and Eussia, desiring to avoid any cause of conflict between their respective interests in certain regions in Persia contiguous to, or in the immediate neighbourhood of, the frontiers of Afghanistan and Baluchistan on the one hand, and the Eussian frontier on the other hand, have signed a friendly agreement on the subject. In that agreement the two Governments mutually agree to the strict integrity and independence of Persia, and testify that they sincerely desire the pacific development of that country as well as the permanent establishment of equal advantages for the com merce and industry of all other nations. Each of the two States further engages, in case the Persian Government grants concessions to foreigners, not to seek concessions adjoining, or in the neigh bourhood of, the frontiers of the other. In order to prevent misunderstandings in the future, and to- avoid creating an order of things which might place the Persian Government in an embar rassing situation in any respect whatever, the above-mentioned regions are clearly defined in the arrangement. In mentioning the revenues which are affected to the loans concluded by the Persian Government with the Discount and Loan Bank and the Imperial Bank of Persia, the Eussian and British Governments recognise that these revenues will be in future affected to the same purpose as in the past; and the two Governments equally engage, in the case of irregularities in the amortisation of oi in the payment of interest on the above-mentioned loans, to entei on a friendly exchange of views in order to determine by common agreement the measures which, in conformity with the law of nations, it would be necessary to take in order to safeguard the interests of the creditors and to avoid all interference which w ould not be in conformity with the principles of that arrangement. In signing that arrangement the two States have not ioi a moment lost sight of the fundamental principle of absolute respect of the integrity and independence of Persia. The arrangement [285—08] K130 APPENDIX [No. 80 has no other object than that of avoiding any cause of misunder standing between the contracting parties on the ground of Persian affairs. The Government of the Shah will convince itself that the agreement arrived at between Russia and Great Britain can but contribute in the most efficacious manner to the security of the prosperity and the ultimate development of Persia. IV.—SUPPLEMENT TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE The 01 icjincil FundnmBntal Law, cotitcuni'ng 51 A.vticl6s, was pvo- mulgated on Dhu'l-Qa'd'a 14, a.h . 1324 (December'30, 1906), by the late Muzaffatu d-Dln Shdh.

Art. Powers of the Realm 26. The powers of the realm are all derived from the people; and the Fundamental Law regulates the employment of those powers. Art. 27. The powers of the realm are divided into three cate gories :— First, the legislative power, which is specially concerned with the making or amelioration of laws. This power is derived from His Imperial Majesty, the National Consultative Assembly, and the Senate, of which three sources each has the right to intro duce laws, provided that the continuance thereof be dependent on their not being at variance with the standards of the ecclesiastical law, and on its approval by the Members of the two Assemblies, and the Royal ratification. The enacting and approval of laws con nected with the revenue and expenditure of the kingdom are, however, specially assigned to the National Consultative Assembly. The explanation and interpretation of the laws are, moreover, amongst the special functions of the above-mentioned Assembly. Second, the judicial power, by which is meant the determining of rights. This power belongs exclusively to the ecclesiastical tribunals in matters connected with the ecclesiastical law, and to the civil tribunals in matters connected with ordinary law. Third, the executive power, which appertains to the King, that is to say, the laws and ordinances are carried out by the Ministers and State officials in the august name of His Imperial Majesty in such manner as the Law defines. Art. 28. The three powers above mentioned shall ever remain distinct and separate from one another. Art. 29. The special interests of each province, department, and district shall be arranged and regulated, in accordance with spe'cial laws on this subject, by provincial and departmental councils (anjumans). Rights of Members of the Assembly . Art. 30. The deputies of the National Consultative Assembly and of the Senate represent the whole nation, and not only the particular classes, provinces, departments, or districts which have elected them.134 APPENDIX [No. 80 Art. 31. One person cannot at one and the same time enjoy membership of both Assemblies. Art. 32. As soon as any deputy accepts any lucrative employ ment in the service of one of the departments of the government, he ceases to be a member of the Assembly, and his re-acceptance as a member of the Assembly depends on his resigning such government appointment, and being re-elected by the people. Art. 33. Each of the two Assemblies has the right to investi gate and examine every affair of state. Art. 34. The deliberations of the Senate are ineffective when the National Consultative Assembly is not in session. Rights of the Persian Throne Art. 35. The sovereignty is a trust confided (as a Divine gift) by the people to the person of the King. Art. 36. The constitutional monarchy of Persia is vested in the person of His Imperial Majesty Sultan Muhammad 'All Shah Qajar (may God prolong his sovereignty!) and in his heirs, gene ration after generation. Art. 37. The succession to the Throne, in case of there being more than one son, passes to the eldest son of the King whose mother is a Princess and of Persian race. In case the King should have no male issue, the eldest male of the Royal Family who is next of kin shall rank next in succession to the Throne. If, how ever, in the case supposed above, male heirs should subsequently be born to the King, the succession will de jure revert to such heir. Art. 38. In case of the decease of the Sovereign, the Crown Prince can only undertake in person the functions of the Throne provided that he has attained the age of eighteen years. If he has not reached: this age, a Regent shall be chosen with the sanc tion and approval of the National Consultative Assembly and the Senate, until such time as the Crown Prince shall attain this age. Art. 39. No King can ascend the Throne unless, before his coronation, he appear before the National Consultative Assembly, in presence of the Members of this Assembly and of the Senate, and of the Cabinet of Ministers, and repeat the following oath ;— I take to witness the Almighty and Most High God, on the glorious \\ ord of God, and by all that is most honoured in God's sight, and do hereby swear that I will exert all my efforts to pre serve the independence of Persia, safeguard and protect the fron tiers of my Kingdom and the rights of my People, observe the fundamental Laws of the Persian Constitution, rule in accordance vvith the established laws of Sovereignty, endeavour to promote the Ja fan doctrine of the Chutch of the Twelve Imams, and will in all my deeds and actions consider God Most Glorious as present and watching me.
