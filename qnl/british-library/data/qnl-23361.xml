The procedure whereby Pencillin was granted by the India Office to the Bahrain Government in October 1945 was highly involved, and its monthly journey out from the manufacturers to this dept: is still very indirect,although it arrives quickly enough, unrefrigerated, to be potent and effective. India Office first authorised lencillin as being essential for Bahrain,and they requested The Director of Medical Supplies, Ministry of Supply,to supply.
