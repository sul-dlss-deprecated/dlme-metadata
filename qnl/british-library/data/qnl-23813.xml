The plan, which is annotated with dimensions expressed in imperial feet, indicates with solid red lines the perimeter of the cemetery. Inside the cemetery area, graves and paths are marked, as is a circular feature, coloured blue, which may be a well or fountain. Forty grave plots are indicated and numbered. A key underneath the plan lists the occupants of the graves. The plan is similar to another included in the file (f 16), which is part of a title deed dated 1933, and which was produced by the Government of Bahrain’s Land Department.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100038136317.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
