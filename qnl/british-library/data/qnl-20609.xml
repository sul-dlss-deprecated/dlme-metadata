The Honourable the Political Reside iSiwp^iii 9m \ . b-m- in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Aerial survey of Bahrain in connection with operations of The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. Sir I have the honour to inform you that in the course of the recent discussions about the lining Lease the Chief Local Representative (Mr.J.M.Russell) and the Manager (Air.1 .A.Davies) i asked me whether it would be possible to arrange for an aerial survey of Bahrain Island. F. Their point was that in Article II, sub-paragraph 1, of the Mining Lease mention is made of n all land uncultivated at the date of this Lease’’ and that it was, therefore, desirable to have a record of what was cultivated and what was unculti vated land at that date. As the -^and Department survey of the cultivated lands of Bahrain is not complete and can only be completed in the course of a considerable time, it was suggeste that an aerial survey should be made and extended to cover the whole island. 5. They said that the Company would be willing to bring ’’its aeroplane” (that is to say, the aeroplane now in Has a) to carry out the sur\ ..., If that course would prove cheaper than a survey by the Royal Air Force4. I said that the Royal &amp;ir Force had already surveyed a considerable area in ^anamah, ^uherraq and oitrah and that I would make enquiries whether they would undertake the fuller survey now contemplated and w'hat it would cost. I took this line because they were clearly intent on having an aerial survey and because, I think that it would be undesirable to allow a survey of this nature to be done by the Company^ aeroplane. If they were to do so, they might become possessed of information, for example, about navigation, which v.e might not ish them to have, and once their machine had been ***4 here on work of that kind, it would be most difficult to keep it out. In the public mind aerial activities in Bahrain are still regarded as a British institution and it v/ouid be unfortunate, if it is possible to avoid doing so, to weaken this idea, and at the same time to give a greeter idea of the importance of American oil interests. 5. I would, therefore, suggest (a) that the Royal Air Force should be asked whether they can undertake the proposed survey and, (b) that they should be asked if possible to arrange that the cost shall not be so high as to give the Company an excuse for making a request to use their own aeroplane (w r hich w ould be difficult to refuse if the difference in cost was very great). 6. In connection with (b) above, Mr.Davies mentioned that he thought that they estimated such surveys in America as roughly! ten collars a square mile, but he did not know/ what this sum covered. 7. It was suggested tentatively that March or April might be the months with the best visibility, but I hesitate to offer any opinion on that point.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department, !N.J3 ,—This is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by j)ost to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, hut intended to be treated, on receipt, with the same expedition a# if it -had been telegraphed.

MOSAIC PHOTOGRAPH OF BAHREIN ISLAND. / I have the honour to refer to your Express letter No. 34-S dated 8th January, 1935, and to state that I agree with the views expressed in paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch f s letter attached thereto, that it would be preferable for the Royal Air Force to carry out the air survey. It was intended in any case to carry out such a survey for Royal Air Force purposes and, therefore, the supplying of a copy of the mosaic to the oil company will not entail any special work. 2. With the agreement of Colonel Loch, Mr. Davies, the manager of the oil company, was requested to communicate direct with my Headquarters giving particulars of what he required, and I enclose a copy of the reply for your information, from which you will see that I have agreed to carry out the work. A copy of this letter has been sent to Colonel Loch, who will be kept informed of all arrangements.

The survey was undertaken in February and March 1936.File notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folio 16.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial reconnaissance</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000284#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
