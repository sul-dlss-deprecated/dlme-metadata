Salloum recalls his work in AUC’s Campus Planning office in the 1990s, from efforts to maximize use of limited space on the downtown Tahrir Square campus to construction projects like the New Falaki Academic Building and Maadi faculty housing. He discusses the planning for AUC’s new campus, such as early ideas for a suburban move, the selection of the site east of Cairo over other options, and the architectural design process including the international Master Plan competition that resulted in the selection of the campus architects.  The goals of the campus’ design are explained, and Salloum outlines aspects of the construction process (begun in 2003) like the selection and performance of the contractors, costs and delays, the scale of the labor force, and the use of consultants. He discusses his role as Director of Planning and Design  in the Office of New Campus Development (where he served under Vice President Hussein El-Sharkawy), and that of Vice President for Planning and Administration Paul Donoghue who was later responsible for managing much of the project.  Features of the campus like its landscaping, the use of local and natural building materials, environmentally-sensitive design, and pedestrianization supported by a service tunnel, are covered as well. Salloum also addresses AUC’s position in New Cairo and issues of utilities and infrastructure. He speaks about the state of the campus at the time of the 2008 move, and efforts (his own and others’) through this 2014 departure to complete the project and settle the university into the space, and implement sustainable energy techniques.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
