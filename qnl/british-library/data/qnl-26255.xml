No.334.S Dated the ^ v ^ , Reference my telegram No.71 8 dated the 21st June, 1947 KtT idisregarding the Kuwait landing-ground. Agent, Kuwait from Iraqi Airways is forwarded herewith. The Company ask to be excused from the payment of landing fees at the Kuwait landing ground in view of the fact that no facilities are provided by His Majesty's Government. A sum of £.125. 2s. 6 d. is due from the Company for landings between June 15th 1947 and January 18th 1948. 3. Iraqi Airways maintain a daily service between Basrah and Kuwait largely for the convenience of the Kuwait Oil Company c.f. Baghdad t elegram No.413 dat ed 5th M ay^ 1947 to Foreign Office. 4. My view is that as His Majesty's Government provide no facilities whatever at the Kuwait landing ground the recovery of landing fees is inequitable. The annual payment of £.500 made to the Shaikh c.f. the last sentence of India Office telegram No.6708 dated the 23rd May, 1947 5 ._.is rea 1 ly^of^a pbTitIcal nature and made in return for the exclusive rights granted under the agreement, rather than as rent for the landing-ground though both reasons are assigned for it in Article 16 of the Heads of Agreement between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. It will be noted that although in that Article reference is made to 'the aerodrome' no aerodrome is anywhere mentioned by name in the Agreement and the payment cannot therefore be regarded as rental for any specified piece of land. 2 A copy of a representation received by the Political Sd/- W.R. Hay. Political Resident, Persian Gulf ATTESTED For Secretary to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. 'LB* oOo(Copy of letter Nd&gt;.IA/37/8038 dated the 29th Dece|nbe}r*]1947 from Iraqi Airways, Baghdad to the Political Agent, K' I acknowledge with thanks receipt of your letter No.2045-42/15 dated the 16th December, 1947 and the schedule of landing charges applicable to aircraft landing at Kuwait. I note that this scale of charges is similar to that normally used by the Royal Air Force and the Ministry of Civil Aviation. You will recall that a few months ago these charges which were sub stantially increased since the war were severely criticised in the House of Commons. It was then pointed out by the Secretary of State for Air that the interested parties must appreciate that landing fees do not only cover a landing and a take-off but that there are numberous other expensive services and aids rendered to aircraft in flight and whilst on the ground such as free meteoro logical facilities Air/Ground W/T communications, point-to-point W/T, navigational aids, Radio Telephon/^y airport Control, fire fighting services, medical aids, passenger and freight handling facilities. I am sure you will agree that none of these services and aids are available at the Kuwait landing ground, and although I am very reluctant in asking you to give this matter of landing charges your further consideration, I do feel that some adjustment is justified in view of the lack of facilities at Kuwait. We extended our service from Basrah to Kuwait in order to assist the public in travelling quickly between these two centred. The distance is very short as a sector of an air route, and the fare must for this reason remain fairly low. It therefore follows that expenses must be kept at the lowest possible level or the operation of the route becomes most uneconomical. Our air services are already linking Kuwait to many other parts of the world and we aim at providing you with faster and more frequent services to destinations such as Karachi, Tehran, Baghdad Cairo, London, Damascus, Beirut, Ankara, Istanbul, etc. It is already possible for a passenger to leave Kuwait by our service on say, Monday afternoon and to arrive in London midday Wednesday. It is generally accepted that air services are becomming more and more important in the development of a country and in providing essential systems for quick communications between countries. Normally countries subsidise, or contribute towards subsidies, paid to airline companies* Kuwait is singularily fortunate in this respect as it does not give financial aid to Iraqi Airways. ooOoo- ^ 'datod 14 th Jaiiuaryj in the Persian Gulf about recovery of landing fees at Koweit* jh- E7 7/1; i3xt # 199/4^i January, 1943# C j^ /to# to- I enclose nerewitu a copy af an express le tter from t « - olitical esident Would it be possible for trie Ministry of Civil Aviation to take the action requested in paragraphs 2 and 5 and let us Kinow the outcome in due course? f.
