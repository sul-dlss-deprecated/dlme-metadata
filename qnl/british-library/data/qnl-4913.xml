'[r. r |l' Dated the 10th November 1943« J £&gt; Gs\yf' 1943. Kindly refer to your D.O. No.c/1477 dated the 31st October 2* ) Of the 7000 bags of rice in Dubai at the beginning of Octo ber only 430 remained at the end of the month, of the amount consumed Qatar has taken 1000 bags, Abu Dhabi 500, Ajman, urn al Qaiwain, and Has al Khaimah 100 each etc. etc. totalling over 2,500 bagso The people of Dubai and the bedouin dependent on it have therefore consum ed 4,000 bags, which is not excessive in view of Dubai*s present popu lation of nearly 100,000, r&gt; 3* I do not consider it likely &gt;hat much, if any of the 4,000 bags consumed in the m.oilth has been hoarded as no one has been allowed to buy more than 13^ lbs, and I am certain that 2,000 bags-or even 500 bags-could not now^be found for export. Nor do I think it would be fair to ask shaikh ga*id to try to find rice for export in view of his generous response to Bahrain r s last appeal (please see Mr*wakefield*s -D.O.No.c/1004 dated the 25th July 1943 and subsequent correspondence), in fact I was going to ask you whether if Bahrain^ are lucky enough to import any more Australian wheat by tanker, you would care to repay Dubai by letting us buy 2000 bags, as the high price of the U.K.C.C. wheat we are shortly going to take into use and of the barley etc. is causing great hardship to the poor. 4. As the present mixture contains an unnecessarily low propor tion of wheat and is most unpalatable, I have given instructions th t wheat and barely etc., will be mixed in equal proporations when we start using the U.K.C.C. wheat in a few days time. The cost will work out at Rs.31/- per bag as shown in the account attached. After this mixture has been consumed we will be able to issue pure wheat until the arrival of the next consignment which it is hoped will be early in December. This next consignment will have to be taken into use almost immediately on arrival so it is vitally important that the U.K.C.C. notify us of the price at the time of delivery, but, in the event, which I consider more than probable, of our having to issue it for consumption before the final price is notified £o us I should be glad of your prior permission to dispose of it at the price of the previous U.K.C.C. consignments-as.a#'- per bag for wheat and Fs.30/- per bag for barley etc. ^ jj iq ^1, 5. I should be glad if the JTlK.C.C. could be asked to ensure t that the proportion of one fifth- for Sharjah and four fifths for Dubai recommended in my telegram No. 231 dated the 12th March 1943 is aflhered to. When they sent the consignment of barley etc. by the Baroda and Fsang in last May and June 860 tons were consigned to Dubai as against 891 to Sharjah. If the wheat/barley etc.proportion and the correct distribution between Dubai and Sharjah is not adhered to'it widl mean that the grain will have to be re-distributed later and the cost of t this will tend to send up the already high price of the grain.

C/1580 dated the 17th 2* I regret that we h ve discovered an error inthe Dubai Custom’s figures for food-stufts in hand, which has be n reported in my telegram Ho.1288 dated the 4th December, 1943. This error goes back to October (before I returned here from Bahrain) and arises from approximately 2(00 bags ox* wheat, containing 224 lbs each, being reckoned as 164 lbs each. Our monthly consumption of all food grains no works out as followss- September(Raradhan) 1313 tons. October 1047 ** Hovember 1012 ”, so that it appears that our consumption in October was not above average. 3• My estimate of Dubai’s population at 100,000 was a slip of the pen, for which I apologize. The figures should have been 50,000 which I think is approximately rig t, although the Shaikh maintains stoutly the population of Dubai.with the bedouin dependent on it is not les than 80,000. at 13plbs per head one bag ox rice suffices for 12 people so that 4000 bags should have been consumed by 48,000 people. In addition to this many ships left Bubai for the 1943-’44 trading season, and these had to be provisioned. Lorrimer’s estimate of the population was made in the early years of the century since when, there has been a large influx to the Trucial Coast, and to Dubai in particular, from Lingah, Hormuz, Bandar Abbas, Jask and o her XxsistaixSoaxjcxlaiaDK smaller towns in South Persia, and a further influx to Dubai from other Trucial Coast towns has occurred in 'he last year. 4*. I am doing my utmost to ascertain the present stocks held by private persons but no one is in a position to give accurate figures for his neighbour’s stocks ind the task in a very difficult one. All that is certain is that the stocks in the bazaar and merchants godov/ns (which, you will note from our memorandum No. C/781-34/ 3a dated the 87th July, 1943 were only ascertained by the use of stringent measures; have be n exha si&lt; d and that rice can'now be obtained in Dubai only by force or by threats. This rice, ur,f rt nate ly, was not a Government supply like the heat, barley etc., but was ordered, imported and paid for privately by merchants. . I doubt if smuggling from qatar is still going on. ShaiRh hamad bin Abdullah was deeply impres ed by the seriousness of the &amp;£ rice situation oii his visit here and since his return I hear that he caught the youngest Darwish brother smuggling rice and told him not to.

I have given him a broad outline of the position but have left all the details for you. 2. Cereals . Political Agency, Bahrain, 7th Jamaary 1944. I have told him that our figures were inaccurate and that this was due to the counting 2 cwt. bags as bags con taining the usual weight of grain which meant that the date of termination of our supplies on the Trucial Coast was moved forward from the 15th of December to the 15th of January. I have also explained to him the difficulties of transport and distribution. I have said that I considered it essential for you to have at least one month’s reserve in order to maintain your sub-agencies and cope with any unexpected tribal demands. I have asked him to explain to you that I considered it essential to recommence issues to the Bedouins even though it be on a reduced scale assuming that you have in fact, as suggested in your recent communi cation to me, stopped this issue in the Dubai area. Stoner will probably question you about reserves. I have explained that there is probably a certain amount of hoarding by the Shaikhs but that it is very difficult to control and that failure to produce our quota on time is one of the greatest incentives to people to hoard. He will probably wish to see Gray Mackenzie's agent in order to check stocks which have been delivered by the U.K.C.C. and note whether they have any which have not yet been taken over. You will no doubt explain your rationing system and give him % /an Captain M.P.O'C. Tandy, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah.&gt;0' 2. an opportunity of meeting such Shaikhs as he may have time to visit. 3. Dates. I am somewhat confused about the quantity of dates which you have already received from Basrah. I gather Andrew Weirs maintain that rather more than 2,000 tons have been delivered to you. Perhaps you will see that Stoner has all the facts which are available and please make it clear whether your agents in Basrah were buying the dates from Andrew Weirs in person or whether after paying Andrew Weirs* charges they have to go into the open market and buy at the best possible price. Andrew 7 Weirs maintain that they have purchased a quantity of dates which they have delivered at I.D.40-000 a Kara whereas my information sug gests that they have sold us no dates but rather we have had to purchase them as best we could and that generally above the fixed price. I have explained that we have done our best to stop smuggling but that now, on instructions from Sir Geoffrey, we have given the Shaikhs a free hand to obtain their dates as best they can. You can mention that you are now putting into practice your barter scheme in order to induce persons to bring dates to the Trucial Coast. 4. You will no doubt explain the difficulties of flour consumption and the greater difficulties cf making cereals available to the poor people at a price which they can afford. Stoner will I think be extremely helpful. Yours sincerely.1 * g* 3. 4. 5 . Extract from X.L.No. 21-S dated 6-1-44 from P # R.

Of the consignment of barley, darij and millet which arrived by the Baroda and Esang in last May and June more than half was consigned to Sharjah* The Sharjah foodstuffs compamy are allowed only 5% profit and could not be expected to tie up their capital in grain which they could no c sell for consumption for several months ahead* Another result has been that, whereas Dubai finished, their barley in December and have been consuming pure wheat since, ^hsrjah -sssb wheat will be consumed sooner than the barley and the people must con tinue to eat the unpopular mixed grain. This has caused widespread dis content, bun i have slightly alleviated the position by having the 200 tons of barley consigned to Sharjah on the Empire Envoy unloaded at Dubai and allowing Sharjah to import 200 tons of wheat in exchange. 5. The M.E.S.C’s statement that ’’Delivery of cereals at both Dubai and Sharjah are only made on receipt of Bank’s receipts that coll ection drafts has bsan made” is no more correct than their previous assertions. At the end of December , as Gray Mackenzie’s agent informed Captain Stonor, they had 516 tons of barley and 350 tons of wheat in Sharjah which they had not yet handed over to the Foodstuffs company; but on the same daparft the actual totals of barley and wheat in Sharjah were 400 tons and 250 tons respectively, and 216 tons had therefore been consumed before they were handed ove . Sharjah has not been guilty of misappropriation as the is .167,000/- not yet realised from them by Messrs Gray Mackenzie represents the cost of less than 400 tons of grain. Steps are being taken to insure that delivery orders are given for the full quantity of grain for which payment has been realised. 7* There appears to be general misapprehension on the subject of handing over of grain. We have now about 300 tons of grain ex Empire Envoy on our wharves. This is in the possession of Messrs Gray / - -—- &amp;Mackenzie vjho have not yet produced their bill although I stressed the; vital import'nee 01 producing their bill promptly as fa^r back as 10'di November 1943 in my confidential D.0.No.G/1188-34/31'of that date uO you. ./lien one bill is presented a month or so may elapse before the drafts are honoured and the local agent of Gray Mackenzie notified, ana i.i during this time the grain is left on the wharves^ it is almost certain that it will be damaged by rain or dew and that Gray Mackenzie will no c accept liability for such damage. As Gray Mackenzie has no Wore—nouse ana che customs ware—houses are full we are, in practice, compelled bo remove the grain to the Foodstuffs company * s ware—houses on arrival. The subsequent handing over of grain by Gray Mackenzie to the Foods CU-:.. is company thus becomes purely nominal# s * Payment in cafcfe for the grain can undoubtedly be effected more expeditiously but has two grave disadvantages. First the sending v'T mmo oums to Bahrain will materially increase the seasonal shortage 01 currenc y horirg the pearlin^ season which ali'eady causes sufficient dislocation. Secondly the Eastern Bank, Bahrain^demand 1% discount on notes of Rs.. 1,000/- and it. j. 00/— denomination^and Gray Mackenzie are now trying bo recover it.1,000/— irom Dubai and Ft. 197/ — from Sharjah on this account for the January payments made in cash. It is understood that the Bank will demand 2% discount in future on notes of Ba.1,000/- denomina- tion* Ihe sending of very large sums in notes of small denomination presents obvious difficulties.

I have spent most of the day on your problems, and have already telephoned a resume of my findings to Cairo and given Warner very full notes to enable him to continue the sub ject when he reaches there tomorrow evening. I asked Cairo about the adjustment of Flour prices on the basis of averaging all Cereals, but they wouldn’t commit themselves by giving an answer immediately over the telenhone, and it is necessary for me to write. In the meantime, they wish payment to be effected on the basis of the original prices, on the understanding that when I have put up my case they will consider it, and if they agree a repayment will be made.' I realise that this is not entirely satisfactory, but in the cir cumstances it is the best that can be done. I can understand their underlying reasons and I shall get my letter to them as soon as possible, asking them to cable direct their agreement or otherwise so that if there is an amendment you may be aware as soon as possible. The other points I am looking into, and subject to MESC’s agreement my people have already signified that they have no objection to a release of 1,250 tons of Wheat ex Basrah for the Trucial Coast and a further shipment shortly thereafter.

Willock. I propose to return to Sharjah on the 14th. £and have been per milted to do so pro vided it was only sold 2. I am taking the opportunity of the 'Rasang' being here to send you a hasty line about the price of cereals on the Trucial Coast, The Food Company, which was formed to deal with the import and distribution, under the Political Officer Trucial Coast*s general supervision, of cereals and sugar and is composed of loading merchants of all communities in Dubai, has been entrusted with the sale of the sugar reserved for barter purposes. This sugar costs approximately fs.GO/- a bag but the Food Company have found it possible to sell it at the rate of ft.230/- a ba&amp;Mto parsons actually importing livestock, dates, or other essential requirements, rnd provided further that the Ps.oOO/- profit per bag was set aside to be used to reduce the price of cereals and did not accrue to the shareholders in the Food Company. The somewhat startling result of this policy is that approximately 8 lacs of rupees have boon accumu lated by the Food Company during the Inst 3 or 4 months. 3. On the 11th 1 attended a meeting of the Directors of the Company with Jhalbh Bashid bin Said who was deputising for his father the Shaikh of Dubai who is away hawking. It was decided that the money must be used for the benefit of the general public of the Trucial Coast and the meeting was reminded by me and con firmed by all present that the first call on this sum should be to reduce the cost of cereals. At the suggestion of Shaikh Rashii bin Said and several members It was lac id eel to reduce the pi*ice of barley to approximately h.20/~ a bag of 168 lbs, the price of flour to approximately Bs.24/- for a bay of 140 lbs, and the price of wheat to approximately Rs.28/- a bag of 168 lbs. This will mean that these commodities wl. 11 now be sold on the Trucial Coast at a more reasonable price than they have boon during the last two years. The scheme is not fonfined to Dubai and it is only being financed from Dubai because the Dubai Foostuffs Company have had the sole handling of the surplus sugar. The lion* hie Sir Geoffrey Political Resident Bushire. Prior, I’.C.I.b., in the Persian Culf,4« The scheme was introduced by the Foodstuffs Company at Tandy’s suggestion with my knowledge and approval though X confess I did not anticipate that the results would be profitable. However, if the Foodstuffs Company had not made this profit it would be made by individual merchants who would most certainly not have handed it over to b. used for the bene fit of the general public. The price of foodstuffs prior to this reduction was such that the great majority of the people were unable to purchase a full ration and if this method of subsidising sales had not been adopted it would in my opinion have been necessary to ask for funds from the Government of India in the form of a subsidy.n /n Political Agency, Bahrain, Dated the 15th February, 1244.

Firstly, the weather, which, as you know, was particularly bad during this vessel's st stay, and considerably hampered the working of craft alongside the ship. Secondly, during this period, two vessels, the 'Nawab' and 'Mars' wore also discharging and these vessels were given priority over the 'Caithness' with M.W.T. agreement. Thirdly, the Bahrain Customs were unable to remove the cargo from the pier as fast as we could place it alongside and consequently the craft could not be unloaded as quickly as possible. These factors are applicable to any vessel calling at Bahrain with similar cargoes. are all, more or less, affected by the weather, particularly Dubai and Sharjah where it is absolutely impossible to work a ship in rough weather and v/here there are, in any case, few boats all of which are small. The presence of other vessels in these ports which are not equipped to handle more than one or two at a time, is also a decisive factor in the rate of dis charge, and this too, applies in some respects to Bahrain where very considerable cargoes are now being handled. Everything possible, however, is being done to expedite the despatch of all vessels. In regard to Bahrain, the S.S.

Cereal cargoes are discharged from steamships at the two ports of Dubai and Dharjah and from these two ports are distri buted by sailing boat and camel caravan, the one dependant on the wind, and the other on grazing and the political tranqui lity of the tribal areas to be traversed. 2 * kla ghfirfe JxQin ^t&amp;aashlPS and dtorare (a) Messrs. Gray Mackenzie i, Co., Ltd., have a sub-office at Dubai in the charge of a Goanese clerk who is also responsi ble for the discharging of steamships at dharjah. Gh^rjah is 13 miles from Dub&amp;i where the clerk lives and as the Company do not supply him with transport and as, owing to the lack of spare automobile parts, taxis are practically non-existant his visits to Bharjah are few and far between with consequent delay in the discharge of ships and the release of cereal con signments. /(b)}0l (b) On discharge cereals are stored in warehouses at and in the neighbourhood of tha Customs. These premises are the property of the Shaikh and no rent is charged. Owing to luck oi proper organisation cargoes are not necessarily stored by shipments and owing to the confined nature of the storage and a tendency to stack the warehouses from floor to ceiling and from back to front it is physically Impossible to check stocks once they have been warehoused, (&lt;-) Consignments are tallied off the steamer and are again tallied Into the Customs and issues from the Customs are sup posed to be only on presentation of a delivery order signed by the representative of Messrs, Gray Mackenzie c Co., Ltd. Salutl iho discharge and storage arrangements are much the same as those at Sharjah but the Customs premises are considerably larger ana in normal times it is possible to store by consign ments but the nature of the buildings and the tendency to make use 01 every cubic foot of space makes a check after storing an ail air oi considerable magnitude and expense as it necessi tates the employment of many coolies to shift the cargo. *he representative of Messrs, G r ay Mackenzie &lt;t Jo., Ltd., who has been in Bubal some months informed me that he had not set foot within the precincts of the Customs since he had taken over charge of his appointment. The sheds are the property of the Shaikh and are inade quate, the Shaikh charges nothing for storage, and as in Sharjah, is supposed to permit Issues only against Messrs, Gray Mackenzie S, Company Limited *s delivery orders. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie c Co., Ltd.*s agent informed me that once cargo had been landed and had entered the Customs r precincts his firm were no longer responsible lor loss or damage and would consider the Jhaikh solely to blame should grain be damaged by rain or lost through pilfering. As the cargo has not been handed over the company are in ay opinion still responsible. /3m'03 3# i&amp;p J&amp;XMhmis&amp;s ns has already been said releases from the Customs ware houses at charjuh and Cabal are In theory only made against t presentation or a delivery order* In practice releases are, I believe, made without waiting for the delivery order which often is given by Messrs* Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., several weeks after the period for which the release was authorised. Ihe reasons for -he delay In the issue of the delivery order are as followsi- (a) Messrs* Cray Mackenzie &amp; Co,, Ltd., insist on payment in cash or by bank draft on Bombay or Bahrain. Payment in cash is unsatisfactory, firstly as the money Is transferred to Bahrain &lt;and there is in consequence a shortage of cash on the Irucial Coast since replacement from India is impossible owing to the Government of India restrictions on the export of currency, and secondly as Messrs. G r ay Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., insist on the consignee paying the cost of the transport of the cash (notes) by air to Bahrain. If the payment Is in notes of it.1000 Messrs. G r ay Mackenzie £ Co., Ltd., make a further to meet the B&amp;s=tern Bank, Bahrain's charge of La charge of L&gt;^/before they will accept notes of &amp;.10GC or over. Payment by craft on Bombay is unsatisfactory because Messrs. G r ay Mackenzie £ Co., Ltd., Insist on the draft actually being credited into their account in Bombay before they will Issue the delivery order. This necessitates the drafts being sent by their representative in Dubai by air nail to Bahrain and from Bahrain to Bombay by air mail. Prom the time the drafts are tendered here to the time authority to issue the delivery order Is given by the Bahrain Office of Messrs. G r ay Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., there is normally a lapse of several weeks In fact more often than not a period of a month elapses. Payment by draft on Bahrain is objectionable to the local merchants because they lose the discount, at present 2^, that is obtainable by payln by draft on Bombay and also because, unfortunately, the majority of the merchants on the /Trueiai/etf 4. fmclal Coast do not have accounts in Bahrain and would thus a ina it rosiarkably difficult to issue drafts on Bahrain. (b}. Authorisation by the U.h.ChC. to Messrs. Or’ay Mackenzie l Co., Ltd., to make releases to Bhurjah and Dubai are not issued until the last moment and as has bean said before in some cases not until the period for which the release is autho rised has partially expired. These difficulties can be overcome if the U.K.C.C. agree to a definite programme of releases and authorise Messrs. Opay Mackenzie &amp; wO., Ltd., in advance. Thus payment by draft on Bombay can be made so far ahead as to enable the drafts to be honoured in Bombay before the date on which the release is to b© made. It will of course be necessary for the 'J.l.J.d. to maintain an adequate stock of cereals in Dubai and Sharjah. 4. The export of all grain by land or by sea is forbidden from all the Trucial Coast towns without the permission of the local Shaikh or the Political Officer, Trucial Coast. (&amp;) • fedlh&amp;l, and Char.;alii Two Companies have been formed under the aegis of the local Rulers for the sole purpose of taking over and controlling cereals. These companies purchase the grain and distribute it to certain authorised shops in the tv^o towns whose approximate requirements are known. These shops sell only for local consumption. The two companies also issue grain on the authority of the Shaikhs to tribal adherents. (k). Abu ■Dhabi: The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi draws a fixed monthly quota from the Dubai Foodstuff Company cm the authority of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, an^ is solely responsible for the distribution of grain to his tribesmen and the townspeople of Abu Dhabi.

Tribal 2 err 11ory: a loose term to define the undetermined areas in the Interior of Trucial Oman ^vhose Inhabitants are % primitive and are nomadic. Their sources of supply often depend on their very elastic relations with their neighbours, for instance the Beni Kitab now draw their supplies from Dubai owing to their paramount Shaikh having conceived the idea that the Shaikh of Sharjah with whom he was previously on excellent terms and from whose town he &lt;,^6. his tribesmen kept themselves supplied, desires to exterminate him by applying poison to his photographic likeness* Photographers arc not welcome at the moment in Beni Kitab circles. This territory is supplied from all the Coastal Shaikhuoras though principally from Dubai on the Shaikh of Dubai’s authority, when supplied from the other Sheikhdoms it is in theory but not always in practice on the authority of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast. The above is very briefly the system of distribution and were it always to work in practice in accordance with the theory there would be very little difficulty but like most schemes it does not. It Is the best that can be devised and although no attempt has been made to ration individuals the partial control effected has restricted and reduced smuggling of grain out of the country. The supervision of the scheme has increased very /greatlyc » * ^9 greatly the work of the Political Officer, fracial Coast, and his staff, ' and. Aationl rii; 3y,sterns complete lack of any Customs administration worthy of the name In any of the towns with the possible exceptions of Dubai and bharjah, and the absence of any local civil adminis tration which could be used as a foundation for a rationing scheme coupled with the peculiar lack of interest in the welfare of their subjects which has been displayed by certain of the fracial Shaikhs would necessitate the establishment of a large administrative headquarters at Dubai, the construction of proper warehouses for the storage of cereals and the provision of a fleet of lorries and lighter vehicles to distribute grain and transport supervising personnel if an efficient rationing organisation is to be set up and accurate information regarding stocks supplied. However as neither the men rut the vehicles are likely to be forthcoming to permit of the establishment of the ideal the best that can be done will be to continue^and to improve where possible the present system. 6 * Maputo (a) One of the most difficult tasks has been to determine the monthly cereal requirements of the Truciai coast and forecasts made from month to month have been so varied as to give the impression that the local authorities were out of touch with the situation, This is not in fact the case, but factors which are unpredictable ha\ r e to bo taken into consideration and factors not which should, be predictable turn out^to be so to the surprise of the Political Officer, Truciai Coast, and the confusion of his and the Political ^Agent Bahrain’s forecasts, For instance the ripening of crops on the Gulf of Oman affects grain demands from Dubai, the continual rise in the cost of cereals causes hoarders of which there are many to eat their hoards and thus there is a fall in the monthly consumption rate, winds delay vessels arriving from ,atar for that state’s quota with a consequent further fall in consumption figures, /the/e? 7. 0 the pearling fleet fits out and the rate rises, serious raiding occurs by camel thieves in the Ibri area and the consequent tribal movements cause an unpredictable rise or fall in Abu Dhabi and Dubai figures, rain occurs and tribes move nearer or farther away according to the crazing, there are so many considerations and they are so difficult to foresee that the wonder is that the forecasts are as accurate as they are and not that they are not as accurate m Is to be desired, (b) In the past there has been a considerable amount of hoarding and probably of smuggling. High prices have mt an effective stop to the building up of hoarded supplies and a gawod i rowing aw-areness of the seriousness of the cereal supply position In the lainds of the Shaikhs combined with drastic action where transgressors are caught, a Dubai merchant mis recently fined £.500 by his Shaikh, has brought about a reduction in wastage due to smuggling. It would be premature to say that smuggling has completely ceased for it has not, nor can it be completely exterminated unless a motor boat coastal patrol can bo introduced, but it has been very greatly reduced. fhe replenishment of and the building up of household hoards, particularly of rice, end the smuggling of rice in the past undoubtedly brought about an unusually high rate of con sumption. The consumption rate has been steadily falling for the last few months due to causes which have already been ©numerated and It is 4st my opinion that our further consumption rate should be in the neighbourhood of 1,350 tons a month. I * am most reluctant to commit myself to a definite figure but I believe t;*at this amount should prove adequate. (a) The stocks according to Messrs.

If my recommendations are accepted and not taking Into account the 1,000 tons already in merchants* stores and shops there will not he any necessity for any further shipments to be mad© until the end of April, the end of April so that a reserve of one month *s supply can be maintained for I consider such a reserve is essential. For the June issue the small quantities of flour remaining in the Dubai and the Sharjah Customs Houses can he considered as wheat and the 1/3 barley to 2/3 wheat scale can he intro duced. Thus the shipments recommended to court©free from the end of April should consist solely of wheat and barley. 8 . further Recommendations (a) I consider it most desirable that the representative of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie £. Co., Ltd., should be supplied by his Company with adequate transport. Serious delay to ships can be and is ctjSsed by the shipping company’s rep rose; d:ative not being in a position to supervise th© discharging of cargoes both at Dubai and Sharjah. (b) It is essential that the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, be supplied with transport to enable him to travel between Dubai and Sharjah and to pay periodical visits of inspection to the various areas for which he is responsible. He is not at present supplied by Government with transport and relies on the goodwill of the local Rulers for the loan of motor cars /and \!!V 10 . Bahrain, 23rd 1944. Political Agent, Bahrain and while their goodwill remains unimpaired their cars do not and spare parts cannot be obtained. I suggest that the anti-Locust Company at present operating with its head quarters at Sharjah should on their recall hand over two or their * Jeeps* with adequate spare parts to the Political Agent Bahrain for the use of the Political Officer, Trueial Coast, or If this is not possible the M.E.S.C. should make available one Station Wagon with desert tyres and adequate spare parts and tyres.x/ 29/1 &amp; 29/22 IK Political Resident, Bushire.

Trucial Coast’s monthly quota is approximately twice that of Bahrain and I therefore agree to use up to twice as much flour. 4. My report on the cereal position on the Trucial Coast is being sent by sea meil # tJ9day. From it you will see that I have recommended that 450 tons (of)each!Vflour wheat and barley (hall 5 900 tons each) be released monthly. I am assured that this proportion of flour can be absorbed for the time being. 5. The population of the Trucial Coast is mainly coneentrated in the coastal towns while 50% of Bahrain’s population live in primitive villages where up to now bakers are unknown. It is therefore more difficult for Bahrain to absorb a large proportion of flour. 6 . Bahrain Government will make every endeavour to make the people use the proportions agreed to by you in Cairo.

Fur J her t ° ®y circular ref. X/l of the Uth January’, 1 have now been advised that there exists some doubt as to whether or not our Underwriters will permit us to insure under our own upen Policy goods which are the property of a third party, particularly as our friends Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co, nt a are insurance agents and presumably could readily affect the insurance for vou. ,, * should be grateful, therefore, if you would discuss uhe mao ter with the local representative of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &lt;&amp; Go, Ltd., and let me knov^ whether the necessary insurance could, be eilected by uhem for buyers 1 account. If the business cannot be arranged locally, then it may be possible for us to effect cover on your beBtalf as outlined in my letter under feference, but' it would be neces sary ^or the Dhows to deliver their cargoes on arrival to Messrs. Mackenzie &amp; Co, Ltd., and not direct to the Shaikh or his^representative, so that if a claim is to be preferred it could be supported by the necessary survey report, as I think it unlikely that Messrs.Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co, Ltd., as Lloyds* agents, would be prepared to issue a survey report to support a claim if the i^how did not report direct to them immediately upon arrival. It must be further borne in mind that the amount nsurable is limited to the f.o.b. value of the goods, and Dhow freight and other on-forwarding charges (if any) would not be recoverable from Underwriters in the event of a loss. I, of course, appreciate that sendings by Dhow are unlikely to^be regular except between Basrah and Kuwait, but 1 consider it prudent that the insurance position shall be clearly understood in case occasional sendings to other ports may be effected, such as from Bahrain to Muscat/Sharjah/Dubai. I should be grateful for an early reply in this matter so that I may consult my .London office. * ■, : l — —y 89/1 &amp; 39/22 Telegram From To ho. /?y Dated the 1st Mcrcn, 1944, IJJ &amp;) Political Agent, Bahrain.

Wheat 360 90 Flour 360 90 Barley 360 90 Total . 450 450 450 Wheat will generally be unloaded at the Ports from incomi.fig cargoes. Only full undamaged bags will be delivered and delivery will be taken over-side from ship. Barley will be supplied by Coaster from Basra or, if necessary, (but improbable) from pool stocks at Bahrein. Payment will be on c.i.f. terms, Bill of Lading quantities and weights. Payment: Payment in all.cases ill be on delivery by a sight draft (Hundi) drawn on Bombay endorsed by the Ruler of the Sheikhdom concerned. In the event of non-payment of any Hundi, you will take the same steps to recover the amount as you would if the dishonoured Hundi were in favour of the Indian Government. You will endeavour to arrange that existing stocks on the Trucial Coast will be paid for in full in the course of the next few weeks. According to current stock -^gures, it will not be necessary for further supplies to arrive before the end of^April (for June consumption) and I am arranging for such deliveries to be adjusted as between Sharjah and Dubai in order, if possible, to avoid the need for transferring a surplus of one commodity at either to make up a shortage at the other. As this position will in any.case not arise until the May quotas are due for release to the i ublic, arrival of the June quota by the end of April or at latest by early May should ensure that no transfer of stocks will be necessary. stfr P0 1~C n it /—U .B. ^ trota. o 11 '^ 3i copies OUT TELEGRAM OTPHEI Ho, 68 fO BAGHDAD for &amp;B3C aiid.UKOC EH CM M, ■D, 15 th March 1944 Addressed to BAGHDAD forJESSC and TJKOC Ho. 88 Repeated BASEi and UKC'J So. 37 a ' BOSHUre P.B.P.a,.

Office from u.K.C.c. t to Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co.,Bahrain apprising them of the fact that the Esang” was carrying 4040 tons of Barley and/70CL tons of wheat for Dubai, with the prices. The political Officer,Trucial coast called on Gray Mackenzie's Agent at Dubai at jaidday on June 10th 1944 about an hour after the arrival of the^ssang and was surprised to find that Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company's Bahrain branch haa not yet passed on the information to Dubai. Had it not been for the fact that the Political Officer,Trucial Coast had taken a copy of the U.K.C.C. telegram to Dubai with him, local merchants and Gray Mackenzie's Agent would have been completely in the dark, and payments would have been consider ably delayed.

The telegram is often received after the arrival of the ship. £t the request of the U.K.C.C. this information has been passed to Gray Mackenzie and Company^ branch at Bahrain, even when the shipment has been for the Trucial Coast. It is apparent that Gray Mackenzie^ agent at Dubai does not receive this information et all, or does so at a very late date. The result of this is an unnecessary delay in the effecting of payments. The following procedure will he adopted in future :- (1) If intimation of a cereaj shipment to the Trucial Coast is received early , the substance of the message *ill be sent to the Political Officer, Trucisl Coast (for information) and to Gray Mackenzie and Company, Bahrain (in duplicate, so that one copy may be endorsed to their Dubai agent).

I A The position is that we accept .responsibility for shortage arising from slack hags landed ex tlie steamers listed in Major Hickihbotham*s letter of I9th April. But this letter does not indicate how much of the total shortage is accounted for *by hags short-landed, and this cannot he ascertained until we re ceive outturn reports from Gray Mackenzie. As these cereal transactions are performed on a e.i.f. basis, a claim for short-landed cargo is a matter for settlement between the ulti mate consignees and Gray Mackenzie, who, as ship’s Agents are responsible for delivering the number of bags contained in the bills of lading. Furthermore, as pool stocks lying at Shargah and Dubai are housed partly in an official Customs building in the con trol of the Shaikh, and partly in merchants* premises bonded to the Customs Department, any shortage between delivery to Customs and final outturn to the Dubai Food Company, must be for the administration*s account. What will be the amount of the final shortage to be borne by us, it is 'impossible to es timate until we receive the outturn reports of the ship. We have made a number of requests to Gray Mackenzie for these figures, but so far have not received them. We shall write you again on this subject as soon as we have further information.” tf— Af K E- CAK¥*f We will revert.

I believe that payment in full has been received by the U.K.C.C. for all shipments to Dubai and Sharjah with the exception of the above short- landed bags representing Rs.16,643-13-0. Our instructions from the U.K.C.C. are that the shipments are made on a GIF basis and we are required to collect payment for the full Bill of Lading quantity quite apart from the number of bags landed. However, as I am anxious to have all past transactions closed as soon as possible, I propose to pay the UKCC the amount still out standing and to take over, on behalf of the sheikh of Dubai, his claim against the Steaiiiship Company for the value of tiie packages short-landed. any time convenient to you.

As regards point (b),, it is suggested that, if no objection is seen, separate lists 'of importers may be prepared for Dubai and .

Howes. , Under Secretary to the Govt, of India.. Copy of letter from Sultan Bin Saqsr Alqasim to Major Howes, Deputy-Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs De partment, New Delhi. Dear Sir, After my arrival here, some of the. merchants of my country approached me requesting to redress some of their grievance's, which I put before you, for needful action through your good offices. ; ‘ They tell me that since about a. year, they are not being given any export quota for pieceg'oods for Sharjah as-before, whereas other ports of Persian Gulf like Dubai, Bahrain etc. are getting their allotments. Under the circumstances, my subject merchants are put to great difficulty, as they have to bear more cost by exporting the goods’ to Dubai and then bringing them to Sharjah and the goods are usually damaged owing to .bad. conveyances. Kindly let me know, how separate quotas for•Sharjah came to suspended, and what are the facts. ' ‘ J ’ 1 As you are aware, Sharj&amp;h being quite separate from Dubai, and for long* steamers have been calling there as a separate port; as such, it ought to have its separate quota allotment. Hoping for your especial consideration, and thanking you in anticipation, with best regards and compliments. i Yours sincerely, Sd. Sultan- Bin Saqer Alqasinl \CONFIDENTIM.

Kackinnon Mackenzie mature. 2. However before I consider the question of separate quotas for Sharjah I would like to receive your comments on (a) the statement made in para 3 that ships invariably call at Sharjah and Dubai. (b) whether there is any objection to the separation of Sharjah and Dubai ruotas on the grounds of possible complij cations in the control organisation or on any other grounds. (c) what you consider to be a fair division of quota goods as between Sharjah and Dubai. for Political Agent, Bahrain.Confidential No.C/1458- 30 }TL To X c , * BRITISH AGINGY, SHARJAH.

(a) The statement made in paragraph 3 of letter No.F.91~ ME/44 dated 26th August 1944 from the External Affairs Department O about steamers invariably calling at Sharjah is not correct. The Shaikh of Sharjah appears to have forgotten the frequent complaints made by him about Commercial Steamers not calling at ^harjah. In ^ 7 ■ ■ r' /? this connection kindly see your memorandum No.C/20 dated 9th Ferbruary 1943 to the Honourable the political Resident, and the latter 1 s telegram No.623 dated 16th February 1943 to the Government J C~° ■ of India received vviuh your endorsement No.730 dated 27th kay 1943. Also your memorandum No.C/1036 dated 1st August 1943 to the Honourable the Political Resident. A statement of steamers which from called at Sharjah from India fax 1st January 1943 to 20th September 1944 is enclosed. (b) Since the begining of khe war we have been allotting one fifth of our whole quota for Sharjah in order to help the Shaikh and his merchants, and reference to the Civil Requirements Programmes or permits granted will show this fact. The merchants of Sharjah have no established offices in Bombay and had to depend on shippers in India who in the absence of steamers for Sharjah, ship the goods to Dubai which is the correct line to follow. Besides, the Sharjah merchants have always shown lack of interest in importing goods to Sharjah and have ordered their shipping agents to have the goods shipped io Dubai on the'ground that owing to the bad Khaur (creek) goods could not be disposed of easily. Whenever we gave permits for export of quota goods from Sharjah to other I Shai&amp;hdoms the, applicants always re nested that they be issued against Dubai owing to She great difficulty they experience in getting boats in Sharjah. Sharjah and its dependencies consume about one tenth of the whole quota for the Trucial Coast and one tenth2 (22) ^ ^ ^ tenth is being allotted to hex* to help her in trade* .-.t present, if quota goods allotted 'to Sharjah are not shipped to Sharjah owing to shipped lack of steamers and the goods are/to Dubai, Sharjah and the rest of Trucial Coast get their needs from Dubai’s stock. If, however, we treat Sharjah quite separately and Sharjah allotted quota remains in India pending steamer, then Sharjah and the rest of the Trucial Sheikh doms, in proportion to their shares, will not be able to draw against Dubai stock and consequently suffer#. Although I see no objection to ti^e entire separation of Sharjah, I think, for the reason stated above, the quota hitherto allotted to Sharjah should be reduced to half arid the remaining half be added to Dubai so that the rest of othar shaikhdoms may hot suffer owing go lack of steamers or neglect on the part of Sharjah merchants. (c) So far we have allowed Sharjah one fifth of our total quota# but if enGire separation is considered,to which I see no objecoion^then one Genth should oe allotted to Sharjah which is sufficient for ^harjah and its dependencies' consumption.

It is\ difficult to understand how exporters from Iraq are abl,e to supply barley at Kuwait at 15 dinars per ton, when, according to the latest agreement with the 1 raq Government, cultivators are receiving 'approximately this price at .collect ing centres in Iraq. We presume that the barley being delivered at Kuwait at 15 dinars contains a very 'high percent er dirt, and we would- be grateful to- have your confirmation on this matter. * 2. We are informed by UiK.C.C., E.S.B.O.D., that future deliveries of barley will cost approximately 20 dinars f.o.b. Basrah.• At.the same time, the Iraq Government has issued a certain number of licences to private traders to export barle 3 ^, and therefore, we must be v prepared for the Sheikhdoms to buy their barley by private contract if they so wish. 3. ,/e very much doubt, however, whether it will be possible for private traders to continue to supply at this very low price and the probability is, that while the Kuwait and other Sheikh doms may obtain one or two small parcels at this price, it will be impossible for them to ensure obtaining their full needs by this method. 4. If Sheikhdoms desire to obtain their future supplies of } barley by private trade, we must make it absolutely clear at this juncture that should supplies fail to- arrive in adequate quantities to meet their needs, we cannot, under any circumstances,| make up any short-fall by increasing the release, of wheat/flour. .5. As requested by you, we have asked Baghdad to cease issuing any further releases of barley to Kuwait. V/e would suggest that the various Sheikhdoms now take immediate action, to discover whether they can obtain their year's supply of barley on satisfactory terms, through private trade channels. If you are satisfied that any, or all, of the Sheikhdoms can sup ly themselves by this means, we will then cancel them from our present Iraq Barley Programme, but we must make it clear, that If we do effect such a cancellation, it may be very difficult to obtain barley f^r them through TJ.K.C.C. channels after about February, 1945. 6 . ./e will await your reply before taking any further action.

The telegrams are often received after the arrival of the ship. # At the request of UKCC this intimation has been passed to Gray Mackenzie’s branch at Bhn. only, even when the con signment has been for the T.C. Apparently such intimation does not reach G.M*s. agent at Dubai at all, or is reed, by him at a very late date. This has resulted in unnecess ary delays in the effecting of payments. May take following action in future ? :- (i) if intimation of a cereal shipment to the T.C. is reed, early may (a) send paraphrased copy to G.M. Bhn. in duplicate so that they may endorse one copy to their Dubai agent, and (b) send one copy to' P.O.T.C. for infor mation. (ii) When intimation is reed late may (a) send paraphrased copy to G.M. Bhn and (b) inform^ gTmT~~ pu bai an cp P.O.T.C., telegraphically, (when the movement of a ship is involved the tel. may be sent to the R.A.F. Sharjah in cypher with the request that they will Tjass on the text of P.T.O. J, x \ . mb** ) Ref S.M: I find R.A’s statement at A and B contradictory; but I (presume he means that Sharjah f s actual share, from the point of view of consumption in Sharjah and dependancies, is l/lOth, but that from the point of view of a share in the T.C. trade Con cerned, i.e. the actual amount which Sharjah merchants are allowed to handle, is l/5th. May seek clarification of this? 2. - Admittedly, unless the steamers call regularly at Sharjah, there will be difficulty in allotting eve^her l/lOth share to Sharjah. However, it is not quite clear what the Shaikh wants (vide his letter at p.168, A &amp; B) and perhaps we should send the letter to the H.A. for report.. It may be that the Shaikh’s merchants formerly enjoyed a greater share of the entrepot trade, and if a reduction of this has been due to the' breach of our • undertaking that ships should call regularly at Sharjah, he has legitimate cause for complaint. I wonder how far the R.A’s point about the difficulty about unloading in the Sharjah creek is substantial. It is obviously not so easy as at Dubai but perhaps Sharjah merchants would unload there willingly enough, if they had the chance’! I consider v/e should press strongly for keeping the B.I. to calling regularly once a month ^at Sharjah. The action of the B. I .'^centring practically the whole of T.C. trade at Dubai (and we have largely condoned it) was no doubt natural enough In war circumstances but v/e should perhaps now try to do more to restore Sharjah’s position (if Sharjah can establish she has a position to restore). 3. I suggest we ask R.A. (a) to clarify point noted in my para 1 above. (b) to report bn the Shaikh’s letter. (c) to report on how far Sharjah’s trade has de- 'clinefi as a result of steanfers not calling and how far we can re-establish it. 4 T.E.R* 7/10 (a) The R.A’s meaning is understandable. At the moment she is entitled to 1/5 of the T.C. share. Half of this is ne cessary for the Shaikh's subjects and half i*s sold in the town |to visiting tribesmen. If the merchants do their own import ing then he does not think they should be permitted to deal with more than is actually required is for stock consumption. (b) The Shaikh’s letter is quite clear. He wants his own port used. He does not say that steamers call regularly. Only Major Howes says they invariably call at both ports. (c) We have pages of reports on the decline of the trade of Sharjah and many letters. Its decline is due part/ly to lack ! of steamers and larg’ely to the Ruler's exactions. Please draft reply, to Foreign on the following lines:- Statement that steamers calling at the Trucial Coast in variably call at Sharjah is not correct and unless the Government of India will ensure that they do I would prefer not to alter the present arrangement. If they are then will albi a small quota to Sharjah merchants sufficiant for the needs of that principality. They have proved unreliable in the past and it is not reasonable i x to make other than the Shaikh’s own subjects dependent on them. Please consult. Smith 'about the scheme in para 1. of Foreign 91- MS/44, of August 26th. If he is enthusiastic let us support it. If he is not let us object with reasons. We could also say that j . it is not understood why there are no separate lists of established \29/22 - Cereals for T.C. established shippers for we have often asked for them. I believe we have j&amp;isd sent in oui^fetst-s of approved. importers for here and the T.C. Pllase check from the files. These is no hurry about this. Mr. Johannes , I have seen Mr. Smith who is not in favour. Please check on points raised by P.A. ik last sentences of his note. Re f A.P.A T s. note of 24/10.above . May remove these papers from the piecegoods file as two separate questions arise from G of I X.L. at p.167 ? 1) Co-ordination of export control from India with import control in the Gulf. 2) Separate quotas for Sharjah and Dubai. Regarding 1) - The G of I have furnished lists of established exporters in respect of many but not ail items in the civil-requirements programme. The Agency has in the past furnished the names of ' established importers w in the form of a statement, when giving details as to how much of each article in the programme an importer is to handle. G of l ordered discontinuance of this practice, vide p.133 of f.28/31 vol 2. Reason was that they found it more con venient to allot quotas to established exporters who wece expected to distribute their shares among importers in each Shaikhdom. P.A. strongly deprecated this unsatisfactory system, tfide p.29 of f.29/27. PUC indicates that G of I is now favouring Bhn»s method of suppling details of exporters importers &amp; amounts, but want all these particulars to be based on business in 1941 only. Bhn»s calculations which are based on business for at least three years preceedikg the war gives a more complete picture. 1 There are no separate lists of established importers for Bhn qp the T.C.
