His Majesty’s Consul at /diwaz reports that the success with which the Jews have evaded the exchange restrictions has aroused the resentment oX* their business competitors, and that it appears likely that the powerful local merchant, Mlrza Jallsl j owaqvjiir, head of the Sherkat-1- ashtIrani Kerun and other concerns, hee used hia influence with Colonel Beyendor to oust buslnesc rivals in this way. fhe British subject mentioned in the first paragraph of Mr# Seymour’s despatch under reference, has decided/ » Honourable Viscount Halifax, K.G., O.C.b.I#, etc#, etc., etc#deoideu not to resist the order to leave Khuaiatan, and he will shortly proceed to Indie.

It is reported that the Russian Consul Ceneral at Meshed, owing to differences arising over the grant of prospecting licences to American oil companies, returned to Russia about 20 days ago. Before leaving he is said to have sold his furniture to 13 Iranians who have since been arrested. It is rumoured that in future only one Russian representative will be permitted to reside in Iran. The same source reports that in retaliation the Soviet Government compelled Iranian subjects residing in Merv to leave for Iran. About 40 persons are said to have arrived in Meshed after having their cash confiscated on the Russian-Iranian frontier.cojy . (E 1396/43/34) LEOaTXOS Temha*. Ko« 75 (2rf2/6/3B) 25th February, 1938.

Captain hasalgette adaed that this order would affect one British Indian subject who had been in ^badan twenty years as a money-lender and shopkeeper* This individual had ap^talcd to him for asi.!stance* Subsequently Captain bazalgette stated that the expulsion was apparently only iron the province of Khusiatan, and that he was endeavour ing to obtain full information fron the Governor of Khorrao- uhahr. ilia Majesty 1 ® Consul at /ihwas reported that the Jew® et that town had not been ordered to leave, and that the order sab apparently confined to the frontier zones, but that it was uncertain whether foreign dews were required to leave Iran or only the frontier zone**. nqulries were made by a member of ay staff at the l inistr^ of Foreign Affairs on the subject, but the Minlatry disclaimed all knowledge of any order for the expulsion of t,ews, and the Irqi Minister, with whom I h&amp;d a conversation on the subject, appears to have been equally unsuccessful in eliciting any definite reply, vhe Tehran representative of the Anglo-Iranian oil company, however, has confirmed that the order for the expulsion of Jews from frontier areas has in fact been given, and that it applies to employees of the company, a point which was previously in doubt* Mr* : ice was unaware as to the definition of frontier areas for the pur poses of the order* He said that the Company were assuming The aght horn— that/that none of thair Britieh Jewish eaployeee would be affected. 3. The position is thus far from clear. I do not ioaow what motives have led to this action by the Iranian Oovernmeat who have recently shown scarcely any tendency to anti-, emitic activity, but it ssems possible that the order has been prompted by the Customs authorities in connection with smuggling. 4. I have requested His majesty’ll Consul at ^ hwax to furnish as soon ae possible further information regarding the order for the expulsion of t ,e Jewish British Indian subject at Khorrasshahr. In the light of my present Jcnowledge, no action can yet be usefully taiten in Tehran, but X have thought it well to submit to Your lordship this preliminary report, since it seeiua possible that diplomatic action hei k e may be required if British subjects arc affected by the order. 5.

IT was announced a few days ago that none of the contracts of the eight Belgian customs officials would be renewed and that they were leaving the country in about three weeks’ time. I gather that the Director-General, M. Dekercheer, whose contract would normally have expired at the end of September, recently expressed a wish to be released sooner. His request was granted, and apparently the Persian Government managed in some way to make his request an excuse for ridding themselves of the others, on whose behalf my Belgian colleague has made entirely unsuccessful representations. He informs me that the Persian Govern ment are endeavouring to obtain the services of four Belgian ‘ ‘ inspectors ’ ’ who will not administer the customs as in the past. 2. As you are aware, there is a belief that there is more corruption at present than for many years past, and M. Dekercheer anticipates that the removal of the Belgian officials will result in a loss of some £300,000 a year in customs revenue. I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE.

I HAVE the honour to report that Ur. Lindenblatt, who came to this I country three years ago to direct the organisation of the National Bank, left f Tehran for Europe on the 11th of this month. He has ostensibly gone on leave, but it seems certain that he will not return unless the report is true that the Shah himself exacted a guarantee from the German Minister that he will be available if required to furnish explanations of his conduct of the bank’s affairs; his present contract would have expired, in any case, in October next. 2. Dr. Lindenblatt certainly had not intended to go away so soon, having just moved up to Gulhek, and the sudden decision was apparently the result of an interview with the Minister of Court on the 1st June, after which it was announced that he would be leaving within two or three days. Later, his departure was postponed to allow for the preparation of a balance sheet at the insistent request, it is said, of Hussein Quli Khan Nawabi, the chairman of the board of the bank, who told the Shah that otherwise he could accept no responsibility for the affairs of the bank. 3. The reasons for what amounts to the summary dismissal of this previously powerful German are not altogether clear, though it was obvious even before the Shah’s feelings were outraged by the press attacks reported in my despatch No. 626 of the 4th November, 1931, that his influence and German influence generally were waning; the recent order made by a Prussian court that the Persian Government should pay the costs of an unsuccessful action laid against a journalist there in connexion with these attacks has, perhaps, helped to bring matters to a head. His Majesty is also no doubt disturbed at the continued depreciation of the Persian currency, which it was the first function of the National Bank to support. Whether or not the Shah actually dismissed Dr. Lindenblatt, he, in any case, authorised this course. 4. The Minister of Court had originally much to do with the appointment of Dr. Lindenblatt, and has, until quite recently, supported him against criticism. Lately, however, various causes of friction have arisen, and, as was reported in the memorandum on the exchange situation enclosed in my despatch No. 269 of the 2nd June, Teymourtache attacked his former favourite last month in connexion with the ineffective handling of the exchange market. Other rumoured causes for Dr. Lindenblatt’s departure are in connexion with alleged facilities given to the Russians about buying exchange, the recent heavy loss sustained by the National Bank in accepting worthless American paper, the indemnity paid without the board’s permission to a German assistant, or the heavy expenditure incurred by the bank over the sugar factories and other industrial concerns. 5. Before his departure Dr. Lindenblatt paid farewell visits to Mr. Wilkinson, of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and Mr. Jacks, of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, and held language to both of them intended to convey the impression that the hostility of His Majesty’s Government in general and the reluctance of the two British institutions, especially the Imperial Bank of Persia, which they represent to co-operate with him had materially contributed to his failure. In a word, he was at pains to show himself a bad loser as well as an unsuccessful banker. 6. There are, of course, suggestions that Dr. Lindenblatt’s elimination is only partly due to causes over which he could have exercised a measure of control, and that it indicates a success of the opposition in the Cabinet to Teymourtache’s economic policy. Thus it is said that Dr. Lindenblatt, relying on the support ofw 2 &lt; 0 ^ dU the Minister of Court, adopted in matters of general financial and economic policy an attitude of independence towards the Minister of Finance which Taqizadeh found hard to bear. Considerable friction between the two Ministers resulted so much so that it was believed in March (see my despatch No. 135 of the 11th March) that Teymourtache was “ looking for a new Minister of Finance.” But Taqizadeh is still in office, and Dr. Lindenblatt’s head is obviously, people say, the outward and visible sign of his victory over the Minister of Court. It is natural enough that persons long resident in Persia, and therefore familiar with the melancholy story of successive foreign advisers and servants of the Persian Government, should conclude that the merits or demerits of the foreigner never are the factor that decides his fate. I have obviously not sufficient experience to form an independent judgment. Of one thing, however, I feel fairly sure, and that is that only a man of outstanding personality as well as of first-class technical capacity could hope to achieve anything substantial as the servant of the Persian Government, and why should such a superman adventure himself in a country and among people such as these ? 7. Herr Vogel, a German with a Russian wife, is at present in charge of the National Bank. There is talk of the appointment of a Swiss or of a Frenchman; the latter would probably be the less desirable alternative, specially to the German staff of the bank. Another German is unlikely, their reputation having suffered considerably since the time when Count Schulenburg so successfully pushed his country’s interests here. No Persian banker is thought to be yet fit to take charge of the National Bank, though Reza Quli Khan went to Europe recently to train for the post. This Persian is understood to be working under the Westminster Bank in Paris, and it might be of interest to learn of his reputation and ideas. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T.

Tehran, May 10, 1932. Enclosure in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Dodd to Mr. Hoare. (No. 95/5.) Sir, Tehran, May 10, 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that Herr Hartmann, the German citizen in charge of arsenals, and a number of other Germans employed under him, said to number as many as fifteen (not four or five as reported elsewhere), have been discharged by the Persian Government at short notice without any definite reason being assigned. 2. Herr Hartmann has been in Persian Government employ for eight and a half years, and has been responsible for the construction of the powder factory at Parch in and the reorganisation of the arsenal in Tehran. He has always been cn excellent terms with the Shah and Persian Government officials. 3. The German Legation are unaware of the exact reason for these discharges, but consider they are consequent on the general anti-German feeling prevalent at the present time in official circles in Persia, as the result of the state ments regarding the Shah which appeared last autumn in the German press. Some eighteen Germans were discharged from the National Bank last March, and German interests have recently declined to a considerable extent in Persia. Herr Hartmann is certain that the reason for his discharge is as follows :— Of the libels referred to above, the worst was a personal attack on the Shah by an exiled Persian Communist, named Farukhi. The German Government refused at the time to punish this man, but advised the Persian Government to conduct a libel action against him. The result of this action, in the German courts, was in favour of Farukhi with costs. The Shah received this information the day before the names of certain German employees were put up to him for his approval of an extension of their term of employment. Without any comment he ordered that they should be discharged as soon as possible. 4. Herr Hartmann informs me that he will endeavour to obtain employment elsewhere, but not in Turkey, nor the U.S.S.R. He favours the idea of Afghanistan. 5. Copies of this despatch have been sent direct to the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence, War Office, London; Chief of the General Staff, Army Headquarters, India; and G.S.O. 1, Intelligence, Air Headquarters, Bagdad.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 569 of the 5th November last, I have the honour to inform you that the Majlis, on the 21st instant, passed a Bill authorising the engagement of the following Belgian financial experts :— (1) M. Charles Clavier, to be Director-General of the Revenue Administra tion, and at the same time, Economic Adviser to the Government, at a salary of £2,700 a year. (2) M. Rene-Henri Eefevre, to serve as assistant to M. Clavier, at a salary of £1,350. (3) M. Leon Smets, to serve as Treasurer-General, at a salary of £1,350. (4) M. Darius Daris, to serve as assistant to the Treasurer-General, at a salary of £1,040. 2. Half of these salaries will be payable in sterling, which will be freely transferable abroad, and half in local currency at the official rate of the day. Rent allowances, varying between 100 and 50 tomans a month, and a travelling allowance for the journey out of £120 will also be paid. 3. There was a certain amount of opposition to the Bill, one Deputy maintaining that the money spent on Dr. Schniewind’s mission had been so much money wasted; he was afraid that the same would be said of M. Clavier and his assistants when they eventually left the country, and suggested that the money set aside for their salaries would be much better devoted to the construction of a factory. The Minister of Finance, however, insisted that Persia still needed outside assistance, and called attention to the fact that one of her most powerful neighbours (Russia) still employed thousands of foreign experts in spite of the progress it had achieved in the last 220 years. 4. According to the “ Iran,” these four Belgian officials are expected in Tehran towards the end of June. I have, &amp;c. R H CLIVE.

At the same time a few Russians, some of them so-called White Russians, are employed in the Road Administration and with the Northern Section of the Railway but none of them hold Majlis contracts. It is in fact an axiom with the Persian Government not to employ in their service under formal contract either Englishmen or Russians. 3. All the most important contracts are held by Germans. A considerable number of Frenchmen are also employed but mainly as teachers or professors in the schools. One of the most important positions held by a Frenchman is that of Monsieur Hesse, who is, to all intents and purposes, legal adviser to the Persian Government. He it is who is the chief adviser to/ The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., The Foreign Office. \to the Minister of Court in the present negotiations with foreign Powers for new commercial treaties. 4. Apart from Mr. Carrel, who succeeded Mr. Poland last year as so-called Head Engineer for the Railway Department, there are at present no Americans employed under contract with the Persian Government although the Ulen Company represent the large American interest in the Railway Syndicate. I understand that Mr. Carrel is unlikely to have his contract renewed and i in any case desires to leave the country. 5. Apart from the Belgians who, for nearly thirty years, have continued, with considerable success, to administer the Persian Customs, the few remaining contracts with foreigners present [no particular interest; nobody takes seriously the contracts with two Italian naval officers as instructors to the non existent Persian Uavy, least of all the Minister of Court. 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch and of its enclosure to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty's High Commissioner for , Ira&lt;£. I have, etc., (Signed) R. H.
