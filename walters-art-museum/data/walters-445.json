King Sesostris III broke dramatically with this tradition, and his face shows signs of age, concern, and discontent. He may have wished his sculptors to show him as the shepherd of his people, heavily burdened by his care for their needs and the duties of monarchy.\r\n\t\r\nAmong the most important ancient Egyptian sculptures in the collection, this statue is a classic representation of an Egyptian pharaoh. He is shown wearing the nemes head cloth (worn only by Egypt's monarchs) with a uraeus (protective serpent) at the brow, and a shendyit (pleated kilt). An unusual feature of this king's sculpture is the amulet suspended from a necklace.\r\n", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1925", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/18291", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris, [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1925, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest. \r\n", "Dynasty": "12th Dynasty", "Reign": "Sesostris III (1870-1831 BC)", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.033", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.115_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.115_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.115_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.115_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.115_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PS1_22.115_3QtrRt_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_22.115_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
