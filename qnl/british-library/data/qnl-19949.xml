Klior Kolaiya Reference Bushire telegram / I have the honour to forward a report from the Adviser to the Bahrein State giving the pros and cons of the proposed scheme for a harbour at Khor Kalaiya. The Bahrein State is not in a position to finance the scheme by themselves, but if the British Government are prepared to undertake the work for reasons of their own, it is probable that the Bahrein state would make a small contribution. The largest immediate gainers by the scheme would appear to be the British India Company# so it is possible that that Company would also see their way to make same contribution towards the/expense of the harbour. . 0 The scheme was condidered in 19$5 please see Report on KHOR KALIYA (Bahrein Island) by Lieutenant &amp; Commander H.G.Scmervil/tof H.M.S.'Redbreast' published by the Government of India in July 1905, I have the honour to be.

M's Political A^ent, Bahrain. Sir, Proposed anchorage at felaiya. With reference to your letter on the subject of developing the Xalaiya anchorage into a harbour, I have the honour to draw your attention to the following facts. ■ 1. I discussed the proposal with a number of uhe leading Arab and Persian merchants. They agree that an anchorage which would admit large steamers much closer to the shore than at present.although at a place some distance from Manama Town and the Oustcms, would be a great advantage. They think that it would almost eliminate the risk of damage to cargo which occurs frequently when ships lie where they get the full force of the open sea. They think that the change would not diminish the value of property on the Manama seaboard. Altogether they are unanimous In their approval of the proposed scheme, but as it was only diacussed today, they have not had an opportunity of considering it fully. 2. From the point of view of landing steamer cargo the scheme presents difficulties. Cargo would have to be taken by lighters to the present Customs pier pr transported to Manama. a. Oargo is now landed by ten sailing booms.1 page -2- booms, 'belonging to the B.I. agents. These, at high tide, would have to make a wide detour, about three miles, to reaoh the Customs Pier; at low tide they would have to go further, round the haok of Maharaq, a distance whloh Is probably more than that from the Customs to the present anchorage and whloh would be partly exposed to open sea. b. The second method necessitates the erection of a pier opposite the proposed anchorage extending beyond low water mark, preferably a roofed pier, other wise a pier and a big warehouse for storing landed cargo. This alone would cost a large amount. The cargo would have to be transported to the present Customs warehouses, which are conveniently situated on the edge of the bazar. The rate of porterage charges made by the Customs would have to be raised to pay for either motor-lorries or a trolley-line bet-.^een the town and the anchorage. The cost of this would fall on the Importer, also the handling and delivery of cargo could not be carried out at the present speed. 3. An alternative scheme, really the only workable one, would be the erection of cargo warehouses and the delivery of cargo on the new site. In fact the complete removal of the Customs from where it is now. This also would Involve the importer in heavy transport charges for moving the cargo himself from Customs to the town, and the State would have to build new warehouses leaving the present buildings useless. 4. The proposed scheme would without doubt benefit the passengers who come to this port, but they are so few, as to be a negligible quantity.page -3- 5. In my opinion, the proposed anchorage would 'be of very great assistance to the steamers only, but would prove an additional expense to Importers, an expense which I am quite certain they would he unwilling to meet. 6. The cost of constructing this new anchorage is not known to me, but In any case the Bahrain State Is nofc able at present to finance any heavy expenditure such as, I imagine, this construction would entail.

The survey of the entrance was commenced on the 2.12.1928 the base line being'measured from Khor Kaliya . Beacon as being the most suitable position available. After the triangulation had been completed transit marks as shown on the Pair Sheet were set up and soundings taken with aid of the ships motor boat. The The Port Director &amp; Director-General of JTavigation, Basrah. Subject i - SURVEY REPORT 03? THE SOUTHERIT ENTRAilGS TO THE KHOR KALIYA (BAHREIN). S UB! TIT TED . - The 'MSARGHUS' arrived at Bahrein at 17.20 on the 29.11.1928 and anchored in the Inner Harbour pending favourable weather to commence the' Survey. The Bench mark at Uannas Village was located and found to be in a dilapidated condition the pipe having apparently been broken off short. From subsequent observations it was found that there was a difference of 4.72 feet in the level of the top of the pipe to the level given on Admiralty Chart Ho.3380. This mark was therefore ignored and a tide gauge was erected at Kassar Diwan Rock wnich is shown as 1 foot high on the above Chart, and a series of observations made from which the mean tide level was obtained, this agreed with the value of mean tide level shown on the Admiralty Chart to within .09 of a foot; all soundings were subsequently reduced to this datum. On 1.12.1928 the 'HSARGHUS' proceeded to the entrance to the KHOR KALIYA and anchored. After soundings had been taken and buoys laid the H HB-iRCHUS' proceeded across the BarThe prevailing weather conditions did not permit of borings being taken but the area was thoroughly examined with a pricker and the nature of the bottom ascertained to consist of a layer of loose coral and sand about 2 to 3 tXJt inches in depth covering an aqueous rock formation samples / of which were obtained. This appears to be an extension of I the Kassar Diwan reef and not of silt formation. The set and drift of the tide was observed and the results are shown Lf on the Fair Sheet. Comparing the observations made with my experience of the dredging operations at the Shatt-al-Arab Outer Bar, I am of the considered opinion that the Drag Suction type of Dredger could not be employed with any measure of success. . Blasting and grab dredging would appear to be the only means by which the desired depth could be obtained at the entrance to the Khor. The whol^/period during which the survey was carried out was interrupted by bad weather and further work was abandoned on the 14.12.1928 when the 'HSARGHUS' sailed for Basrah there being no prospects of the weather moderating.

Sir, In accordance with your orders I have the honour to submit the following weather report on Khor Kaliya. The 'best ^nchorage is undoubtedly that shown on Chart 3540, to the Eastward of the middle ground, 'HBARCIIUS' rode out a strong shamal in this anchorage. It is equally well sheltered from the KAIJS Wind. M HBARCHUS w was previously anchored about 5 cables MJE from Khor Kaliya Beacon and good shelter was obtained from the Kaus. A sudden shift of the wind to the H¥ caused the ship to drag and I shifted berth to the anchorage previously menti oned. The entrance to Khor Kaliya in my opinion should only be attempted before H.W. as a strong cross current rendered a low powered ship practically unmanageable. I have, etc.. (Sd.)

Subject: - SXAMIHATIOIf OP TH3 SUTRAHGS OF KHOR KALIYAH (BAHREIH) . Referring to your instructions, I have closely examined the plans prepared by the Survey Party and the specimens of rock obtained from the bar across the Khor Kaliyah and submit the following : - The removal of the shoal does not appear to present any serious difficulty but due to set of currents, open site, nature of bottom, etc. it is suggested that the channel be laid true IT.W. and 3.S. and be 300 ft. wide with 22 ft. of water below datum to allow of vessels drawing 19 ft. to enter and leave at any state of the tide. Prom the sample of rock produced it would appear that the bottom is composed with the exception of a thin layer in places of sand and loose coral, of coral rock. The samples have no appearance of aqueous rock or sandstone. The net quantity of material to be removed is 36,000 cubic yards and allowing 25^ for an uneven depth the amount to be dredged can be taken in round figure as 45,000 cubic yards. VsJ With a rock Gutter (Lobnitz) the material could be broken up more evenly and less material would be removed than by explosives but the cost of obtaining suitable plant might be prohibitive. After the rock had been broken it would have to be picked up by a grab dredger and dumped. A hopper grab dredger appears to be the most suitable type of craft. The cost of the work entirely depends on the plant available and cost of getting it to the site as the job is not big enough to warrant new craft being constructed. Provided suitable plant can be hired either in Karachi, &lt;lKarachi, Bombay or one of the near Indian Ports it is consider -ed that the cost would 'be about Rs. 6 per cubic yard or in all Rs. 270,000. (This figure must be checked as no data is available for closely estimating the work). There would be no difficulty in erecting leading beacons in the neighbourhood of Khor Kaliyah Beacon and these are recommended as well as two port hand buoys at the entrance and exit of the cut but these would have to be heavily moored to prevent dragging. The Basrah Port Directorate do not possess suitable craft for the work. The only vessel suitable is the 3.V. 'AID' which is fitted with 15 ton Priestman Grab Crane but this vessel is fully occupied and would be too slow for the job as she would have to load other craft with the dredgings.

In regard to the expenses incurred in connection with this detailed survey I find on going more closely into these that full working costs have been charged duringjthe whole period for the 'Hearchus' 1 . However as she lay at anchor during 12 days of the survey a com pensating saving in fuel oil consumption was effected by about 75 tons and in view of this I recommend a reduction of Ss.2500/- against the hire of the Vessel. Apart from this there is no other item appearing thatia not actual out of pocket expense. IT0.II6 /LB. L.T.Hearchus» At Sea» 22nd September,1928. From The Inspector of Gulf Lights, L.T. Hearchus. To The Port Officer, Basrah. Sir, I have the honour to submit that on Friday 21st of September, 1928, I proceeded to inspect the Khor Kaliya in accordance with your instructions. The work was carried out by the ship 1 s motor boat while Hearchus lay at anchor in Bahrein. I proceeded via the Muharrak channel to the entrance to the Khor Kaliya where the soundings on charge 3540 were checked. A sketch survey of the result is appended. It would appear from the result that the shoal on the west side of the entrance extends further to the east ward than shorwn on the chart while that extending from Kassar Diwan does not extend so far to the southwest as shown. \ The bar appears to consist of loose coral and sand with a minimum depth lj .W.0.S. of 12 ft. The channel on the bar would be approximately I cable wide and blasting or dredging operations would be required for a distance of one cable. If it is required only to enter at H.W. 3 ft . would have to be dredged. The soundings inside the Khor agree with those on the charge.

With reference to your memo No.M.F.6827 dated 6th September, 1928, and in continuation of my No.33/10/58 dated a^ 10th September,1928, as you^aware I have only just returned from leave but on going into the matter find the survey carried out by the Commander of the n Nearchus w too superficial to be of much value. I propose making a personal visit to the Khor Kaliya with a qualified survey party as soonjas possible probably in November, when borings will be taken to ascertain \ if a Dredger can remove the obstruction and until.this, is done I have no idea of the cost of operations necessary to provide a 19 foot channel at low water. The Commanding Officer of the Persian Gulf Light Tender H Nearchus M who visited Bahrein on the 21st September, 1928, reports as follows :- 'The shoal on the west side of the entrance extends further to the eastward than shown on the Admiralty Chart No.3540 while that extending from Kassar Diwan does not extend so far to the south west as shown.

Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter Mo. F.i94-M/28, dated ttje 17th June 1929, I have the honour to state that Sir Lionel Haworth was very en thusiastic aJbout the Khor Kaliya Scheme as a base for the Royal Mavy, any benefits may have desired for the Bahrain Government being merely incidental. Sir Lionel*8 interest was first aroused in April 1927 by Captain Parry, the Senior iiaval Officer in the Persian Gulf. On referring the question to the Political Agent at Bahrain Sir Lionel was told that, from the point of view of the Bahrain State, there were certain benefits to be anticipated from the scheme, but there were also certain definite objections to its adoption and 'in any case the Bali rain State is not able at present to finance any heavy expenditure such as, I imagine, this constawction would entail'. The Political Agent gave his opinion that the Bali rain State wafjbot in a position to finance the scheme by themselves but that iimif the British Government were prepared to undertake the work for reasons of their own it was probable that the Bahrain State would make a small contribution.- 2 - CS) contribution. He also suggested tiiat the British India •oteara Havigation Company t as the largest immediate gainers« might see their way to make some contribution. The question was not again referred officially to the Political Agent or the Balirain Btate and it was thought that the scheme had been dropped until, without any previous consultation with the local authorities, the 'Nearchu8 ,, arrived to make surveys. Mo objection was raised as the Ruler understood the work was being done for the British Government. 2 * Ti* Bushire Kcfiiclency records do not show the various steps leading up to ~he survey. Yhe only references on record are Sir Lionel Haworth's telegrsan Uo. 270 of 29th August 1928 to the Government of India and a copy of letter Mo. I.O. 88, dated 21st September 1928, from the High Commissioner at Baghdad addressed to the Government of India. All other arranger^ents must have been made either verbally or by letters which were not registered Hvthis office. 3. In the' circumstances I do not consider it desir able to ask the Bahrain Btate to contribute towards the expenses of a survey which was made without their consent, to further a scheme as to fctoe benefits of which they were extremely doubtful and which an influential section of the Bahrain mercantile community disliked. Still less do I consider that the Kastern and General Syndicate should be approached. In June 1928 they proposed to develop the Khor Kaliya harbour for their own purposes, but they neither sought nor required any assistance from His Majesty*s Government and I understand that they are not now pressing that part of their application which included permission to develop the harbour. Bir Lionel Haworth certainly had no desire to assist the Eastern and General Syndicate which he suspected of being a foreign&gt; i - 3 - foreign concern* their application mac have induced him &gt; to renew hin interest in tlie scheme on imperial grounds, but 1 see no further connection between the survey and the Syndicate.

The Government of India find it impossible to believe that the Port Director and Director-General of Navigation, Basrah, would have undertaken the further survey of the Fhor Kaliya channel unless he had been requested to do so by the Officer for the time being holding charge of the office of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and they infer from your letter xTo.266-S of 1929 dated the 10th July 1929 that Sir Lionel I ' Haworth was the Officer responsible. They are strongly of opinion that in view of the certainty that this survey would involve considerable expenditure no such request should have been made without previous reference to themselves and without their prior consent to the expenditure likely to be involved, which has turned out to be considerable (Rs.12,983-14-0)» 3. In order to avoid a recurrence of such incidents which the Government of India cannot but view with serious disapproval and necessarily find difficulty in condoning, I am to request that the necessity for consulting and obtaining the formal sanction of higher authority and, if necessary, of the Government of India, may be borne in mind by you and firmly impressed on all officers serving under you, and that all concerned should clearly understand that any scheme which involves the expenditure of largeL i ^ large amounts of money must 'be very carefully scrutinised before proposals are submitted for its execution.

Dear Colonel nother surprise for me on my return was the agitation for a Chamoer of Commerce* A. number of merchants have interested themselves in this, and the idea seems to emanate from the Qusaibis. I dont at all like the idea, for when one sees the number of things which have nothing whateve to do with them that the Manam'municipality managed to meddle in, there seems no limit to the zeal of such a chamber. would immediately form that their power for evil would be li mited. I understand they propose to elect a new president at ea^h meeting, and since it is only the presence of the al Kha lifa president and the P.A. and Adviser that prevents the two Municipalities from coming to blows, I dont think such a ga thering will have much effect, though it will probably give the Government plenty of advice. Still in the hands of a clever and powerful man there is no saying what it might do, and I would prefer to do without it. I believe the Q.u- - v \ &gt; ' saibis immediate objective is a lowering of the R.E. duty and a reduction in some of the Customs handling charges, but th$i ideas are very nebulous. I expect to discuss the matter with the Shaikh on Friday, and will tell him that it is entirely his affair, but that since some of the merchants cannot lind time to at tend the municipal meetings and Majlis el Urfi, I doubt that they will have any time for this, and that I see no necessity for such a Chamber. I shall also advise him not to put any member of the al Khalifa on it, if he agrees to its formation Left to themselves, I think so many factions Yours sincerelyP.O.

I will discuss the matter with you when we meet, but would like to put my views on record as well. If any merchants choose to form a Chamber of Commerce that ix is their concern: we cannot stop it directly. If however there is no official representative on the Chamber of Commerce to hold it together, it will probably soon dissolve into factions, mid in any case will be an entirely un official body, whose representations can be met or dis regarded as seems desirable. I therefore quite agree with the advice that you propose to give the uhaikh, to the effect that no member of the Al Khalifa should foe put on it. As long as the Chamber of Commerce is entirely un official and composed, as in other countries, entirely of merchants^ I do not see that they can do much harm. v ptain C. G.

From ^&gt;To THE POLITICAL AGENT, BAHREIN. 7-^1 ytmi'ssnryj _The Horn ^le the-Toiitical •KesideEit „JjL„tiie Persi an G-ulf, Busiiire. Sir, I haye the hoisour to report that certaiii demoastrat- ioas occurred after the issue of the proclamation of the Bahrain GoTemment concerning inheritaELce,of which I enclose a copy. I propose to give a brief survey of the circum stances which lead up to the issue of this proclamation. 2. About a year ago I discorered that the proyisions of the Order in Council regarding inheritance were to a great extent being ignored and the property of foreigners was being disposed of without any reference to the igency, tuf cases only being referred to tkwhen some dispute occurred, and^owing to this,where some of - the heirs were minors,the whole property was eyen liable to disappear before they were of ag^e to protect themselves, it was of little value to them to have the right to sue on attaining majority if the money had all disappeared. A particularly glaring case came to my notice^where an unfortunate Persian minor had the greater part of his patrimony filched from him before the Agency received any notice of what was happening,and it was found that when the Xkadbca Shiah Qaahi himself had undertaken the administration of the child's estate,a very large proportion of the estate had been consumed by his administration charges. 3. I therefore issued a proclamation embodying briefly the provisions of the Order in Council regardinginheritance. The proclamation created seme excitement amongst the foreigners and a number of them came to see me,they having quite misunderstood the meaning of certain clauses and they had imagined that the statement that the Court might take over an estate,meant that the Court necessarily would take over all estates and administer them. I explained to th«m that if an executor were appointed by the deceased he would naturally be allowed to function until there was some very strong reason against it and that the Court would never take over the administration of any estate except as a last resort. I'hey were satisfied by my explanation and I issued a second alan to clear up the misunderstanding. 4. The Bahrain Goveriment had observed my action and throughout last year began to notice an increasing number of cases where widows and orphans had been defrauded sometimes of their entire inheritance,an injustice it was usually impossible to rectify as their patrimony had literally been swallowed up in the sea. These instances had been largely brought about by the collapse of the pearl market, aid prominent merchants found the diversion to their own pockets ol funds placed in their charge for the benefit of widows and orphans the easiest way out of their financial difficulties. 5. The employment of the estates oi minors tor diving is prohitied by Shara'a law and this is univer sally admitted and it was also universally admitted that many merchants had misappropriated large sums. The general feeling of the publie,however,was that it was bad luck for those who happened to be caught and that owing to the bad pearling seasons the Government should3. aot oe to© hard ©a them. God had sent the bad pearliag seasoriSso it was reallj his affair. 6. The matter had been discussed among the Shaikhs tor sometime and when three glaring instaaces had come to 4 the instance of the Bahrain Court,it was felt that some- thing had to be done if the Bahrain G-orernment were to take their responsibility for justice towards widows and minors seriously. In one case a certain Shahin bin Sagar had left an estate variously estimated at 10 to 15 lacs of rupees for his widows and children. A few months ago his widow,who had been refused relief by the Qadhis, applied to the Bahrain ^overiment for help in recoTering her share. After great difficulty the Bahrain G-OTernment succeeded in obtaining the so called accounts of the administration of the estate. It was admitted by Ali bin'Sagar,the executor,that the widow was due Rs.1,35,000 apart from landed property,but he stated that he was unslble to pay her a penny as the money was all tied up in pearls (for which there was no sale at the moment) and the bulk of the landed property had been mortgaged to others, ihree similar cases occurred in quick succession, and the Adviser asked me if I would discuss means combating the evil with him,Shaikh Abdulla and Shaikh Salman,the son of the deputy Ruler. A meeting was held in my drawiig room and the details of the proclamation it was proposed to submit to Shaikh Hamad were discussed. Shaikh Abdulla or Shaikh Salman,! forget which,wished to include the Sunni waqfs and the 'athlaths^or jot one-third of estates given for charitable purposes)as well as the question of protecting widows and orphans. They wished to issue a proclamation on the lines of the Agency proclamation of last year,but I strongly advised them to postpone the X wrnmmmmmmm/ o 4. questioa ©f waqfs as the Qadhis would fight it t© the last ditch and als© the questita ©f athlaths because mao-y prcmiaent mea had disposed the one-thirds ©f their relatives estates ia their qwl businesses aad their united opposition w©uld wreck any attempt to improve existing conditions. I was not much impressed by the project of interfering in these thulths for^they ka&amp; been faithfully ©bserved in the past,the greater part of the property in Bahrain would now be endowed far vague,and to our ideas, useless objects,whereas the sums could be much better employed by the living in their own businesses. ?• I pointed out to Shaikh Ibdulla that any inter ference in the present system by which executors,appointed or self appointed,could use the estates of orphans for their ©wn purposes without let or hindrance would provoke a great deal of opposition,and I said that the Qadhis would strongly resent anything that eacroached upon^or enquired too closely into,the powers they at present enjoyed. I told him that Bahrain was approaching a step which had long ago been reached in Bugland and recently in Iraq,Syria and Egypt where the ecclesiastical power had had to make way for the secular,but that gunni Qadhis and the interests they represented were very powerful and could not be ignored, he laughed and said 'Who are the Qadhis? They are ©nly three old menl* I replied 'Yes: but old men with very long tongues' 1 . I advised them to issue something much briefer than the igency proclamation as anything on those lines would be certain to be mis interpreted and suggested that they should content themselvi 'b^ a proclamation which ensured that Government should see that wills were registered,executors appointed ; ajad that if a person died intestate his property was protected, i5. A prdclamatiea ©f three short sections ©a those lines was drawn up ana the matter was then discussed with Shaikh Hamad by Shaikh ibdulla,Shaikh Sulman and the Adviser. 8. icSks i'he ShaiJdi himself had always warmly urged the need for protecting the estates ©f widows and ©rphans but xias shewn nimselt very unwilling t© proeeeute anyone proved to have st©len th®. His Excellency,! regret to say, feels that the criminal law exists ©nly for the poor and that if a wealthy merchant happens to malversate a matter ©f a lac ©r two belonging t© his br®ther f s widow it was a business misfortune and not a crime. However,he warmly supp©rted the issue ©f t£is proclamation which was issued on the 23rd January 1932. The proclamation was issued while I was in Hofuf and I imagined that the Adviser would have secured the agreement of as many-prominent men to it as possible before it was issued, but apparently he only shtwea it to the Shiah JT Qadhi, Khan Sahib Yusif bin Ahmad Kano© and a few other persons j in Manama who were in favour ©f it and otherwise did little in this direction. This was a mistake^for the usual method ©f paving the way f©r enactments that are likely to hurt people T s feelings is t© show ±4 t© as many as possible who support it and to get them to place their seals on ±4 and then send them to talk ©ver those wh© remain recalcitrant. This may appear a curious method,but it is the one which obtains in Bahrain and usually produces the best results. A public meeting to discuss any important project invariably ackieves nothing. 9. Until Sunday,the 7th February,! heard nothing to whow that the proclamation had mei with any opposttion^but on that day the Adviser informed me that considerable opposition to it was being formented by the Sunni Qadhis in Muharraq and that though many people must have died since the proclam ation was issued ; very few deaths had been reported to the ill' iS) 6. Bahrain G®urt. 10. A party @f pr«miaeiit men came ©ver fr«m Muharraq amd t®ld the Idviser that thej had been t® see Shaikh ibdulla ab ®ut the prsclamatisa aad that he had t@ld them t© g© t© the Adviser,without giving any explanati©a sf the pr#clsiaiati ®3a. t® them althtugh it was largely his haadiw®rk. They discussed the matter with the Adviser with s®me heat and then said they w@uld g® @ut t® Shaikh Hamad, he t@ld them they ctuld please themselves ab®ut seeiag him. They weat ®ut t® Sakhir amd the Shaikh t®ld them very plainly that he was determined t® pr®tect the interests ©f wid®ws and @rphans,that it was his duty t® d® s© as a Ruler, that the pr®clamati@n was designed t© achieve ihis^ and had 'been issued by him after careful c®nsiderati®n. 11. He enquired what ©bjecti®n they had t® it aad they pr®duced a series ©f fantastic rum@urs saying that they had heard that G-©veriment wished t© take ©ver aki the estates ©f all s® as t© tax them,taldag perhaps ®ne-third ©r ©ne-half ©f the estate^and that they had even heard that the dead were n@t all@wed t© be buried withtut the sancti®n ®f the G@vern'r ment aad that men had been placed at the d®®rs ©f cemeteries t© prevent any©ne being buried with@ut G®veriment permission. They urged him t® withdraw the pr®clamati®n a»d he refused p®int blank t® d® ss and had the matter ended here,probably n© m®re w©uld have been heard ©f the agitati@n y which w®uld have gradually subsided. H©wever,with the weakness which renders him s© futile as a Ruler,when asked what answer they sh®uld take back t© Muharraq.his nerve failed aad he said 'I will let y®u knew t®m®rr®w ,, . 12. He sent a special man that night t© discuss the matter with the Adviser and myself, aid the rnaa^wh® is his chamberlain,stated that the Shaikh pr®p®sed taking the pr©clamati®n d@wri by night and that when asked next day what %7. ; his reply was,he weuld saj 'the priclainatiQii is gsne - that is all . I shewed him that this w®uld make him tk# laughing st#ck fr®m Muscat t® Baghdad and that the excitement had really arisen because the great majerity ®f the pe@ple had n©t read and did n©t understand the preclamati on. I advised him t© tell the Shaikh t© write t® Shaikh ibdulla and ask him t® collect the leading merchants ®f Muharraq and explain the real ®bject of the pr@clamati@n to them, se^thtught this wsuld ©blige Shaikh Abdulla to c®me d@wn ®n one side or other ®f the fence. He replied t© the Shaikh next day that 'the merchants would explain their views t© him personally'. Actually he had done nothing whatever^ 13. Next day I paid my Id calls on the Shaikhs at Muharraq (Shaikh Hamad,however,being at Sakhir) and ®n visitiig Shaikh ibdulla noticed that he seemed uneasy and that he brouglj his sons back into the majlis^as they left after greeting me, evidently with the idea of preventing my discussing politics with him. Bofore the close ©f the visit,ktwever,I asked if I might have a word with him,and he dismissed his sons. I told him that he had been one of the prime movers of tne proclamation and that it was his duty to explain it to the people and allay the agitation as far as possible. I also asked him why he had made no^ attempt to explain matters to the Muharraq merchants and despatched them to the Adviser i without a word,He said they would not listen to him,a palpable a lie,since he is all powerful in Muharraq. I remind him that I had warned him that trouble might ensue that he had laughed at my warning and he replied 'Yesrbut who thought they would carry on like this'. 14. Next day I had to call on the leading merchants at Muharraq and noticed that there were large crowds about ind ' that the shops were all closed. There were,however,no signs of disorder. I enquired from the Adviser whether he8. believed that the agitati®a w@uld increase @r diminish and he seemed t© think that it w©uld die a natural death. At this time the tr@uble was l©calized in Muharraq and 1 had insufficient evidence t© f@rm a c©ntrary ©pini©n. On Wednesday h©wever,it was clear that the trouble had spread to Manama and all the shops were closed in sympathy. in©ther deputation frem Muharraq. went t® see the Shaikh at Sakhir, and a large deputation ®f Bahama also went ©ut and behaved in a most disgraceful manner in the Shaikh's mjlis. This latter deputation had some revolvers among them and had commandeered the cars which took them ©ut. They presented a most insolent petition,which the Shaikh unfortunately did not read. They shouted,screamed,and stated that they would not have any (j©verament interference or any interference by the Qadhis and that they would manage things just as they saw fit. The irabs^and some of the young al Khalifa who were present were much put out by this impertinent outburst,(for they regard Baharna as caiiaille^but Shaikh Hamad gave them mild words and they left having extracted a promise that he would 'see what he c®uld do.' 15. I had been ©ut to see the Shaikh the precending day and had found that he was determined to cancel the oiiending proclamation. He was much alarmed and had evidently heard exaggerated accounts ©f what was happeningjjln MuharracL. 1 found it impossible to persuade him to take any action against th®se who were-stirring up trouble on all sides, though I t@ld him that he would make himself ridiculous and damage the prestige of his Government^if he withdrew his proclamation at the first signs of opposition,without making any attempts to explain his motives or deal with th®se who were setting the whole place by the ears. I also told him that I was amazed to hear that he allowed the Baharna to insult him in his own majlis. I1/ 9. 16. On Tuesday the i,dviser asked me to reissue my pr©- clamati«B. as he thought this w©uld have a g©od effect. I Uj? doubted this,Jit in a slightly abbreviated f©rm. On Wednesday the f©reigners began t@ take an interest. All sh©ps in Maiama were cl©sed and ©n Wednesday night b©th my proclamation and that ©f the Bahrain S©veriment were t®rn d©wn. On Thursday I received news thr©ugla my ©wn s@urces that a Persian merchant had sent a launch t@ Muharraq^ t® bring over Persians 'to ask I the Government what they were g®ing t© d® ,! . This put an I entirely different aspect ©n the matter and the situation became seri@us ; as a crowd of igntrant and excited Persians entering the Manama bazaars might have produced a riot at any ' moment. The Adviser apparently knew nothing of this. In fact the outstanding feature of the ishole aifi^ar had been the fact that no information whatsoever was forthcoming from the official sources in Muharraq. until the situation was almost out of control. For this we have t© thank the inefficient and inadequate dispositions made by the Commandant of Police,Captain Parke. There are no Bahrain police in Muharraq with the exception of 6 sepoys ©f the Indian armed ^ police. These know neither Arabic nor Persian,nor are they encouraged to take any interest in local affairs,but had a post af Bahrain police been there, reliable news would have been available from the start. Order is supposed t© fee maintained by the imir with naturs. The Amir of Muharraq is a worthless reptile who was removed fmmjhe^same post in Manama for incapacity, and I had frequently Shaikh Hamad to replace him by a more reliable man. At no time aid the imir send any information whatever that any trouble was brewing, in fact his only message was sent on Thursday morning when he reported that the Bahrain Govemmeat and Agency proclamation had been torn down by persons unknown^majhool'.) -^g&gt; \ 10. 0a Wedmesday^when a disturbance might have occurred at any m«raent he retired t© his house and said that he was ill. Mr.Belgrave had considered replacing the Indians by local men when Captain Parke went on leave^but had nst been able to d© so before the trouble started, the result being that he and the Shaikh were completely in the dark as regards happenings in Muharraq_. 17. I asked Mr. Bel grave to get into touch with the Persian situation immediately^ and he sent some men in plain clothes to Muharraq at once,but the tide fortunately went out and prevented further incursions. I sent for the merchant alleged to have despatched, the launch,but before he Hasan Ousaibi came to see me aid said that my alan had caused some excitement amongst his community and the Persians had^asked about it. I iii told him that it was a resume ol the one which I had explained to Abdul Aziz Qusaibi the year before,and which the foreigners had then accepted. He seemed satisfied,but asked if I would receive some Persians and Nejdis. I said I would be glad to see them. 18. Some half an hour later a mixed body of twenty Persians and Hejdis came to see me. Tney said that great excitement was prevailing and that their communities had been agitated by the Bahama and Bahrain Arabs. Some of them were men to whom I had explained my proclamation the year beioie^ ann I asked them why they were now so disturbed by that they had accepted and understood last year. They told me that they had not understood it properly then and that all kinds of rumours were current. I said I knew this and chaiiea them about some of the more ridiculous ones ano. asAeo. them if they believed them. They said they did not,but that the. T jahil 1 ,the ignorant,did^and that they were the people who would cause trouble. They then asked me 4fo withdraw my '11. proclamation^since the Bahrain Govemment had withdrawn theiiE and this 1 refused to do. I asked them what they objected to since it was not proposed to do anything that had not been the practice in the Agency since the Order in Council was instituted,and some replied that the things mentioned in the alan had never 'been done before. I said that if they referred to the fact that executors were required to give notice of their executorship,they were quite right,and it was because this was being neglected that I had had to issue the notice. I enquired if they had ever known our Agency courts to deal with a Shara'a matter instead of sending it to the Qadhis for settlement,and they admitted that they had not. 19. They professed to be alarmed by the statement in the alan,that if there were no executor appointed in the Will the Court would appoint one. What Oourt did this mean? I said that such a matter would naturally be referred to trie Shara r a,who would appoint one in accordance with the pro visions of the Holy Law for that particular sect. This partly satisfied them,but they still urggd me to withdraw my alan. It would have been agreeable and easy to refuse to alter or witnUraw it,but they were evidently in a state of excitement and scarcely able to listen to reason. Since Hasan Qusaibi in particular, and some of the others^were obviously trying to help as far as they could,it would have seemed ungracious to have refused to do anything,and with all the foreigners in a troublesome mood the situation might have deteriorated rapidly, it seemed to me that though the alan was nothing but selected extracts from the Order in Council.some of the paragraphs were open to wilful mis interpretation and that if these were deleted the main effect of the alan would be the same though expressed differently. The principal opposition was to the clause which required executors to give notice to the Court,which certain professed . to believe the thin edge of all kinds of interference and/ ^g) 12. inquisition. I said,however, that I could not give way on this pointy and after three hours discussion they agreed to a modified alan which sounded more agreeable to them^and at objected to. 20. They retired^and evidently prevailed upon their communities / for further trouble from Persians and Nejdis ceased,and on the next day,Friday, I walked through the bazaar myself and found them all opening their shops or willing to do so. There were sufficient police to persuade the large gangs of suspicious looking loafers to keep their hands from any attempt at looting,and as the day progressed the situation became more mormal. Early in the morning the JLdviser came upon a large gang of Somalis who fled at the sight of him, so evidently there were not lacking persons with guilty intentions. 21. Next day,Manama was quiet,but I heard that when Shaikh Hamd fisited Muharraq on the Sunday (he could not ( postpone his Id visit any longer) he was going to be met with a series of concerted demands^,which seemed to cover everything from a request that respectabxe mercnants shoiu-d not have summonses served on them^to a request that tne Baladiyahs should be abolished. I went to Sakhir and warned the Shaikh about this^and he said he would be prepared for , it. I told His Excellency that Manama was now quiet,and that the question of the foreigners had been settled^and inquired what steps he proposed to taice against tLe instig ators of all the trouble,particularly the two authors of tne particularly insolent petition of the Bahama. He went off into a long discourse about what Bin Sa T ud did under similar circumstances. I again asked him what he was going to do. . He said 'If I do anything now,the whole trouble will break out again'. I agreed that immediate action might produce a the same time had much the same is effect as the one they- @ 13. recrudescence of the trouble^but I told him that if he allowed such instigation to pass without anyone suffering/ts weak ness would be patent to all. He went of in another long harangue. I again asked him what he proposed to do and he finally said 'I will wait now and let them cool down. Then as you know there is the party of so and so and the party of so and so (mentioning some four parties). Presently they will start to quarrel,and then I will more this man against that and that man against this,and then perhaps I can do something'/ 22. Three things have been fully demonstrated. The utter futility of Shaikh Hamad^who remained throughout at Sakhir, leaving the Adyiser and myself to shoulder all the respons ibility,when firm action on his part at the start would hare stopped the whole affair. The duplicity of Shaikh Abaulla, who though really the prime mover in the preparation and issue of the alan^did nothing whatever to assist when the trouble which I had Earned him of started* and the inefficiency of Captain Parke's dispositions of the forced of law and order in Bahrain.. 23. Shaikh Hamad displayed a regrettable tendency to fcow to agitation when some divers took it into their heads to create trouble two years ago. I knew him to be weak^but it remained for this incident to show me the complete extent of his incapacity in an emergency. He was insulted in his own Majlis by people who belong to tne weakest element in Bahrain,and his only action has been to dismiss one of tne ringleaders from his seat on the Manama Municipality. The view of the al Khalifa present may be judged by Shaikh Abdulla's remark to the Adviser after the event. He said 'whatever happened afterwards ,I should have had those two (the leaders of the Bahama) taken outside^ and flogged'. 24. When asked in 1929 to report on the general situation in Bahrain^! wrote that Shaikh Abdulla was no longer openly14. f agin T the GoTemnient jbut that I doubted the leopard could ■ change his spots so soon. Whether he deliberately instig- ated this proclamation with the object t&amp;at an agitation tHrogpteec to which the Shaikh would have to yield, thereby making him look ridiculous / 1 cannot say. I have since received clear proof that he made no attempt to check the disturbance^as he could easily have done,and he certainly gave no warning whatever of the early stages of the agitation though he must have been fully aware of it. When Shaikh Hamad asked him to take certain persons out of his Majlis and talk to them,all he is reported to have said was ^na wiakum T ,meaning in Bahrain! Arabic T i am with you T ,which could only have had the effect of encouraging the malcontents 25. Until the last day of the agitation,no information . whatsoever reached the Adviser from official sources in vj Muharraq.,and for this the blame must rest with Captain Parke. The Amir had long been known to be utterly useless,and yet | with the exception of six Punjabi sepoys the Government had , no source of information in this troublesome town of 20,000 inhabitants,since the naturs could only report through the Amir. As I have said before,the Punjabis are not expected or intended to do anything except guard duty,ior their ignorance of Arabic or Persian precludes their performing the normal duties of police. This,then,was the disposition of the police left at Mr.Belgrave's disposal by Captain Parke,and.though both he and Shaikh Sulaan had detected the weak spot,unfortunately action had not been taken to amend it before the trouble started,though I should mention that Captain Parke had only recently proceed on^leave. With proper police arrangements the trouble would nave been detected at least a week earlier and steps taken to check it. 25. I am confirmed in the view I have always held,that a firm control of the foreigners by the Agency is essential., 0 / / 15. for Shaikh. Hamad is incapable of dealing with eTen the weaker factions amongst his own subjects. I fear that the Bahrain G-oyernmeait have suffered a decided set back,acid the reactionary element have won a decided success,and that in a matter when the GoTemment were fully in the right.

Sir, 1 hare the honoor to forward herewith a copy of a report received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, regarding a somewhat unfortunate incident that occurred there recently. Captain Prior has given a full account of the trouble that arose and the causes that led up to it and I do not think it is necessary for me to comraent upon it at any length. 2 0 It is unfortunate inasmuch as it involves a definite loss of face for the Bahrain Government and a victory for the reactionary elements, and I propose to consider in due course in consultation with Captain Prior what steps can be adopted to restore the position. It is the duty of the State to protect the estates of orphans and widows and measures to this end should be enforced, but in view of *hat has happened it is \ clear that if difficulties are to be avoided the ground will have to be carefully sawn in advance before overt action is taken. 5 t j have never had any illusions regarding ohaikh Hamadj I have always considered him to be a perfectly useless individual ... / From To mmmBMI individual, utterly unfitted to perform the duties of Ruler cf Bahrain. While I bave every desire to avoid so far ae possible what has been termed the 'Westernisation* of Bahrain, and to make these Arab Principalities stand on their own legs, it is clear that with a Ruler of this kind, governing a State with so heterogeneous and inflammatory a population as Betoain, we must retain the management of affairs to a very large extent in our own hands. 4. I am disappointed in Shaikh Abdullah. He certainly is the most capable of the A1 Khalifa family, and the opintm always expressed about him is that with a little more education he would have made a good ruler, and the general consensus of opinion is that had the succession followed the normal course he would have succeeded# The police arrangements at Muharraq certainly seem to have been defective. Captain Prior informs me that the situation is now normal, and if I can manage to visit Bahrain again in two or three months 1 time, I will endeavour by discussions with merchants and others to pave the way for a re-introduction of tm Orders. Captain Prior appears to have dealt tactfully with the difficult situation. 1 Vf I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. lit .Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Copy forwarded to the Political Agent, Bahrain,reference his flo.C.25 of 14th February 1932. 5 ATTESTED, 'll/ fix*■i&gt; &gt; / f , y / Extract from private letter dateddthe Sist April 1952 from the Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel H. v. ±3iKCoe , jt?oliticai Resident in the Jfersian Gulf, to Captain G,G, i^rior, Fo1iti cal Agen t, Bahrain. There is one thing regarding which jl should like your views, and that is whether it would be desirable to return to the charge regarding the question of the . administration of estates, over whicli Hamad let us down so badlv a couple of months ago. if you think that the time is ripe i suggesf that the 3tate might begin preliminary dis cussions and prepare the ground with merchants and leading members of the community, etcr, and if you could report in about a month's time as to how matters have gone and ' tliink that my presence would be of a^BiBtance i should be prepared to come down for a few dayB to Jbahrain and try and clinch liiattrrs. i don^ tlaink we sliould let natters rest where they are, but you are the beet judge 01 tactics. i * A• -gencx, ,.S -iir-ia. —- - 1st 1932.

Also, I think we can attain much of our objective by simpler method. I suggest that an alan be published stating tl: t no one may dminister the estate of a deceased without thePage IH (S&gt; the authority of a ^ dhi. The Shaikh could order thei. to send u£ ■'i O- 1 - c '-ny e: tctte ts^ht canie to them to tue haiirain Goverui^e.j ment for registration as soon f.s they received it, and so the principal objrct of the old procl' .ation would be attained. ITo One could object to such an alan, if their intentions were f khalis, * ad the 4 dhis would have the ground cut from under their feet. They oulc probably charge hmtdsome fees for pro bate and so make themselves unpopular and so pave the way for further peaceful penetration by the B hrain Government. I would,however, still leave it open to anyone to take his estate to the '' hrain Court first, should he desire it. 5. I sug est that the Shaikh be told that he cannot al io'. the present, st te of ch os to continue and that he must be stir himself to improve it. That it is for him, as ruler, to take the matter into his hands and not to rest until he has effected this improvement. T'e is certain t-o discuss this witn. e. cnd I could then make the -,oove suggestion to him, telling him that it is for him and his fellow Muslims to purge the State, and not for Belgarve and myself who are unbelievers. If he can think of better plan, he is welcome to do so. 6. We cannot ch nge so large a mass of wrong doing without the support of public opinion, and it must be educated to see the wrong that is being done. Despite tnis setback, things aie moving in the right way, nd I am constantly having cases re ported to me now which would not ..have been brought to my notice before. Individually, the forces of darkness can be deieated, but when they all turn out together with a good battle cry, a bunch of hornets are easier to tackle. I think we should re- fr in from f-iving them another ch -nee to combine --nd s -p their position bit by bit.
