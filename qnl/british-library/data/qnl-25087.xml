A., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Arahlstan, To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E. His Britannic Majesty's Consulate for Arahistan, Dated Mohammerah, 25th April 1914. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have been approached by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the subject of an Indian Guard for their Refinery at Abadan. In February last, one of the Lurs was run over by the engine which pulls the trolleys. The Lur Conmunity in the Works amounts to some 1200, and of these 500 or 600 turned out and demanded the blood of the Indian driver of the engine. The driver escaped and the Lurs being foiled in their desire, turned their efforts to wreck-v.iecking what they could lay their Lay-thot-r hands on. The Shaikh’s g^aard of 30 men was unable to cope with the situation and help was telephoned for at about midnight, as it was feared that the rioters who had gone to obtain a well earned rest, would break out at day-break, as they threatened to do. I sent the Assistant Manager of the Company to the Deputy Governor who immediately sent down re inforcements to the guard, while I borrowed a guard of 25 men from the Frontier Commission Escort and with the addition of three men of my own Escort, proceeded to Abadan at about 2-30 A. M. I had the ringleaders arrested at day-break and the rest gradually calmed down. The incident had made the Oil Company, very nervous, since, although on the occasion named, the damage done was not very great, being mainly con fined to windows and other glass, it might have been much worse. With inflamable property, as exists at Abadan, of such value, the danger is very great should another case of the nature occur, and the management had a very unpleasant day on the occasion referred013) referred to, since they were unable to tell when the riot would end and were fuite powerless to stop it. A case has occurred this week again which has necessitated the intervention of the Local Govern ment. As stated above, the Oil Company have from the Shaikh a guard of 30 Arabs, on whom they say they could place little reliance when the situation is bad. I have explained to them that however unsatisfactory this guard may be, it is necessary that they should exist to mark the ultimate responsibility of the Local Government. With damage extending to a million pounds and the ruin of several years* work, it would however be small satisfaction to the Company to allot subse quently the responsibility. The object is accordingly to have a guard composed of Indians who will strengthen the backbone of the Shaikh’s men. The Company already have their own Police com posed of 29 Kurds. These men behave fairly well when required but they are Persians and unused to discipline or co-ordinate action. They would, however, be of considerable use when supported by an IndianIndian Guard* Mr. Walpole has Informed me that he would require five posts at various points of the Works and asked me whether it would he possible for Government to ontain reliable men for the purpose. I have suggested to him the following numbers and wages and he has agreed, as a preliminary at sriy rate, with the proviso, that the numbers may inquire to be increased One Jemadar on Rs.60 per mensem Rs.60 per mensem One Hawildar on Rs.40 per mensem « 40 ' Five Naiks for five posts on ) - 150 - Rs.30 per mensem ) Ihirty men, 6 for each post at ) ' 750 ' ■ Rs.25 per mensem ) Total — Rs. 1,000/- * • I am of opinion that this guard is a necessity but, although its main purpose would be to stiffen the local guards in cases of emergency, in intro ducing the question to the Shaikh, I would explain to him that they were to control the 1000 Indians employed in Abadan regarding whose drinking and gambling he has made remarks to me. I consider that from both points of view the guard is a necessity. WithWith the Kurds and Arabs the total men available for emergencies would total 96 and I think that this number of armed men would be suffi cient to quell any movement by the Lurs, whom, since the Arab appears to be incapable of steady work,the Company find themselves compelled to employ. It would not be difficult to obtain the men for this guard from time-expired men of Punjab fiegiments. Punjabi Mohammedans would be the most desirable, and I have no doubt that reliable men to the number stated would easily be obtained on the recommendations of Commanding Officers. The men would, of course, be purely private employes of the Company but it is to our interest to see that the right type of men is obtained, I have accordingly the honour to request whether you would recommend the proposal to the Government of India and would ask that the question may be treated as urgent.

Sir, T have the honour to acknowledge the receipt i* your telegram No. 512 with reference to ray letter No. 659 dated 25th April on the subject of Indian Police for Abadan. T have consulted the Assistant Manager at Mohammerah, Mr. Thorburn, who is in charge of the Question and he stetes that he would rather keep the numbers at those originally mentioned, for the present t sv te. He points out that, if necessary, it will be possible to increase the numbers but that he would rather commence with the smaller total. The number of 6 per guard was calculated by me as follows I considered that a permanent guard of 4 was sufficient for the purpose. I allowed one extra mum for sickness and one extra man so as to allow one nan of the guard€i) guaid goinj; off duty every sixth day. When on duty each nan would only he required to do 3 aours on niard and. 9 hours off. It must Se remembered that the area at Abadan is very limited and thus It would not be necessary to keep more .nan four out or the seven of each guard on duty at the post at all times* 1 had intended the Naik in charge to hand over to the senior constable when allowed to be away but i think that one balk above the number i suggested ibight/be auoeu. i do not think that reliefs in the military sense of the word are a necessity.

It will be seen that the managing director is prepared to put before his board a proposal that the company should undertake to pay to the sheikh 3 per cent, on the profits of any oil obtained within his territory, and asks for an expression of your views on this proposal. 3. It appears that this proposal was in Mr. Lloyd’s mind when the agreement between the company and the sheikh was in the making at Ahwaz, and as it is substantially the same as the present arrangement between the company and the Bakhtiari khans, it is difficult to understand Mr. Lloyd’s statement that “ it was not in his mind at all that this friendly arrangement should be on the basis which was made by the company with the Bakhtiari.’’ I submit, therefore, that my inteipretation of the undertaking, as given in my letter of the 26th August to the company, is substantially accurate. „ . 4. If this arrangement be agreed to by the board, I foresee no dilnculty in negotiating a mutually satisfactory agreement between the sheikh and the company, the rent for the lands being nil until oil is struck and not over 11. per acre if this contingency should fortunately occur. [ ll£L \ T 0 &amp;C. A. T. WILSON, Lieutenant, I.A. [1845 6—1] B2 Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Messrs. Lloyd, Scott, and Co. to Acting Consul Wilson. Mohammerah, August 30, 1910. WE have the honour to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of the 27th instant, contents of which we have carefully noted. We will submit your letter to our directors for their consideration, but we have the following remarks to make in connection therewith :— So far as this company is concerned, his Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah has no locus standi in the matter. The Persian Government sold in 1901 certain rights and privileges to this company. As you are aware, a very heavy price was paid for these. If, on the company proceeding to exercise these rights, obstruction is placed in its way by a second party who claims that the Persian Government sold to him also the same rights and at a heavy price, the company’s recourse against such obstructiou lies not with that second party, but with the Persian Government. This seems to us to be a case where the company must, if and when it becomes necessary, rely on Tehran to accomplish its aims, looking to the fact that it merely seeks to exercise a right bought from and paid for to the Persian Governnnent. And such pressure can very well be brought to bear when it is borne in mind that any claim for damages put forward by the company for failure of the Persian Govern ment to secure for it free of obstruction all rights under its concession, can, if necessary, be enforced by forfeiture of the share in profits to which the Persian Government would in due course become entitled. We are unaware what price his Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah paid in 1903 to the Persian Government for rights apparently sold in 1901 to the company, but we think it very improbable that he gave a greater quid pro quo than the company has done, so that however much his Excellency the sheikh claims that his rights must be respected the company is in a very strong position to insist that its prior rights must also be respected. Looking, however, to the fact that his Excellency the sheikh did not claim mineral rights in June-July 1909, we think it unlikely that he will claim them now. It appears to us likely that had he seriously considered he had any claim to mineral rights in June-July 1909, he would have produced his firmans at that time, especially as you report that he had a general recollection that he had complete rights. We think you will agree that it would be very unlike his Excellency the sheikh to give up anything that he thought he could legitimately claim or, possibly illegitimately get by “ bluff.” Undoubtedly this company would expect to be compensated, if it were necessary to pay a second time for what has already been purchased, but then the company does not propose to act in any such manner. We are instructed, as already advised you, that henceforth the directors propose to act strictly on the lines of the concession. Paragraph 8, first sentence of your letter appears to us to contain the crux of the position. You suggest financially interesting his Excellency the sheikh in the prosperity of the wells at Ahwaz, if worked. The company has already given an undertaking to make some amicable arrangement with him in the event of oil being tapped (naturally in the commercially paying quantities, as you presume), but that has nothing whatever to do with the company’s right under its concession to prospect for oil at Ahwaz. We cantiot agree with your remark that the company has been unhampered by the slightest local opposition, but that is a matter into which we need not enter here. We do not consider it necessary at all for the company to threaten his Excellency the sheikh with the wrath of the central Government at Tehran. We consider it necessary to threaten Tehran, and if and when the sheikh obstructs the company in exercising its rights purchased from the central Government, our opinion being as first stated above, that from the company’s point of view the sheikh has no locus staiidi in the matter. We are sure the directors will give the subject-matter of your letter under acknowledgment their very careful consideration, but their instructions to us indicate the unlikelihood of their agreeing to pay anything to his Excellency the sheikh in excess of the surface value of the land taken up for the purpose of working oil at Ahwaz.Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Messrs. Lloyd, Scott, and Co. to Acting Consul Wilson. Mohammerah, October 20 , 1910. IN connection w itli past correspondence on the subject of this company’s proposal to drill for oil at Ahwaz, we have the honour to attach hereto extracts from letters received from the managing director, dat-d the 23rd and 30th ultimo. In accordance with the final sentence thereof, we will be grateful if you will forward the attached papers to the honourable the political resident, and seek on our behalf, any expression of his opinion or comment, which he may wish to make. Enclosure 5 in No. 1 . Extract from Letter dated September 30, 1910. Concession .—With reference to your correspondence with Lieutenant Wilson on the ^question of the sheikh’s rights, I would point out that the firman of January 1903 only granted “ the said lands’ and “ to exercise in the said lands the possessory rights of ownership of every kind.” This in most grants of this nature in other countries does not cover “mineral rights,” which are usually held as being the property of the original owner, unless specifically mentioned in the grant. Therefore the sheikh’s claim is w r eak in two respects :— 1 . His firman is of later date than our concession, and therefore w r as subject to the latter; and 2 . There is nothing to show that the Persian Government, in granting that firman, ever intended to part with the mineral rights, which, moreover, at the date of the firman, were not theirs. However, it is obviously to our interest to maintain the good-will of the sheikh, and if we can, without in any way admitting any rights on his part to minerals, get him to agree to some such arrangement as that suggested in my last letter it will be considered by my board. I should, however, like to get (through Lieutenant Wilson) an expression of Colonel Cox’s views on the subject, as any suggestion from him would, I know, carry great weight wdth my co-directors. Extract from Letter dated September 23, 1910. Drilling at Ahwcuz .—With reference to the correspondence exchanged between yourselves and Lieutenant Wilson, Mr. Lloyd states that the undertaking given to the sheikh was neither more nor less than as stated in Colonel Cox’s note, viz., that “ the company would be inclined to come to some friendly arrangement with him”—and that it was not in his mind at all that this “ friendly arrangement ” should be on the basis of that which was made with the Bakhtiaris under quite different circumstances. He, however, points out that Lieutenant Wilson was not present at the portion of the interview when this point was discussed, but only came in at the end, when all the points had been settled. He says that what he had in mind was that the sheikh might be given in some form or other the equivalent of the “ 3 per cent, on profits ” which is what the Bakhtiaris will obtain by means of the shares they are to receive. The difficulty is that these profits cannot very well be defined in a way that would probably be satisfactory to the sheikh, without the formation of a separate company—a step which my directors would not for a moment consider at the present time—but if you think the sheikh would be satisfied with an undertaking from us to pay him 3 per cent, on the profits of any oil obtained within his territory (such territory to be clearly indicated and not to be open to question)—such profits being based upon the same price for crude oil as is paid to the Bakhtiari Oil Company, and the Aaglo-Persian Oil Company’s statement of these profits being accepted by the sheikh as conclusive and final, without any question—I will put the proposal before my board, although I have no reason for supposing that they would approve of such an arrangement and that they might not rather abandon altogether the idea of working at Ahwaz.4 Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Consul-General Cox to Actinq Consul Wilson, (Confidential.) Dlr ’ r tt a i i Bushire, November 6 , 1910. 1 HAVE the honour to refer to your letter dated the 28th October and previous correspondence in connection with the plans of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the inception of boring operations in the territorial limits of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the terms which should or should not be made with him in case of oil being tapped in paying quantity. ° 1 r 2. In expressing his own ideas regarding— (1.) I he nature of the present rights of the sheikh and his tribesmen in the soil ; . (2-). ‘he terms which might fairly be offered him by the oil company as an amicable satisfaction of them, the managing director is good enough to say that he would be glad to know my personal views. J r . ^*. ^. P 1 onouncement in regard to the former problem seems to involve the investigation and settlement of both the following points : (a.) The precise nature of the tenure and rights, if any, over and in the soil enjoyed by the sheikh and his tribes, anterior and to the time of the grant by the Persian Government of the D’Arcy concession. (^*) Tim precise rights of the sheikh and his tribes in the soil since the grant of tie formers finnan in January 1903, and how far they hold good against the rio-hts of the oil company under the D’Arcy concession. 1 hen again the following two queries seem to be suggested by the record : (c.) The company having in the agreement with the sheikh of the 16th July, 1909, acknowledged that the right to treasure trove is vested in the sheikh ; could they make good to him the argument that the cognate right in regard to minerals is not also vested m him ? In this connection I would point out that in framing article 13 of the agreement which was finally concluded between the company and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Mr. Lloyd and I in consultation were at pains, in the interests of the company, to alter the wording of the article on this subject numbered (11) in the draft sent to His Majesty’s Foreign Office with Mr. Wallace’s letter of the 9th June, 1909, and to omit any pregnant allusion to minerals. The managing director’s draft ran :— “( 11 .) The company as lessees of the land agree that all treasure trove throughout the lands leased to the company belongs to the sheikh alone. By ‘ treasure trove is meant gold and silver or precious metals in a natural state, or coins or objects of antiquity of the same metals.” J In the agreement concluded this became :— “ (13.) The company as lessees of these lands agree that all treasure trove throughout the land leased to the company and other lands given under this agreement belongs to the sheikh alone. By ‘ treasure trove ’ is meant coins, jewellery, and objects of antiquity.” J It will be noted that the words in italics were omitted. (d.) Is it usual or necessary to regard the right to allow or disallow boring’ for oil as a “ mineral right ” properly so called ? In fact, is the question of the possession or non-possession by the sheikh of “ mineral rights ” generally, involved at all in the present project under discussion? I do not feel qualified to give an authoritative answer on any of these four questions, and merely indicate them to make it clear that, according to my lights, the determination of the real position of the sheikh and the company in regard to the question of the oil boring and mineral rights,” would be by no means a simple matter. L Holding this view, I cannot help thinking that were the company, in connection with their contemplated boring operations, to raise acutely the question of the incidenceof mineral rights generally in Mohammerah territory, His Majesty’s Government won &lt; be a good deal embarrassed to decide what attitude to adopt towards it, and it would further seem to me probable that in regard to the larger question, British interests might be found to he in the opposite direction to the interests of the company in the ^Tirticular project under consideration. /What I mean is this. It would apparently be much more to our advantage, having regard to the strong position which we occupy with reference to the ruler of Mohammerah, to contend that the sheikh did enjoy “ mineral rights” in his territory in which case any future exploitation of minerals therein would, if we maintain our present predomment influence, naturally fall to British enterprise alone, rather than to Concede that the central Government possessed the said rights, in which event the possibility ot their placing some mining concession in Arabistan in a foreign quarter ovei the heads of the sheikh and ourselves, could not be precluded. ’ But my suggestion is that the right to allow boring for oil is not necessarily, if usually, included m the term “ mineral rights,” and that it is at all events advisable in this case ^ to disassociate the two if possible; and secondly, that it would be to the company s own interests not to raise the specific issue or dissect the question of the sheikhs precise rights, in either case in the present connection, but to have recourse to the alternative of an amicable compromise with him. _ 5. Speaking of the form which an amicable arrangement might take, the managing director suggests that the company might pay the sheikh the surface value of the ground taken up and allow him something equivalent to 3 per cent, on the profits derived from the sale of the crude oil extracted in his territory, the figures of the company to be based on the pi ice paid for the crude oil to the Bakhtiari Oil Company, and to be accepted without question by the sheikh. I find it difficult to express an opinion as to the fairness of this offer, or as to whether, if the sheikh leferred to us for advice, as he would be sure to do, it would be one which we could pi ess him to accept without fuller knowledge of the portent and probable results in practice of the arrangements in operation with the Bakhtiaris. Perhaps the managing director or the company’s agents would kindly supply further information on these points. I gather that the Bakhtiaris company and the exploitation company are merely offshoots of the main company without any separate interests, and, if so, it would seem that the business interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would lie in working the Bakhtiari company at no profit; the profit only occurring at the stage where the oil came to be handled by the parent company. I quite sympathise with the latter. Having paid their price to the central Government for their concession, they naturally resent being called upon to repeat payments in other quarters for their privileges; but in this case we have to deal not with abstract truths, but with the actual conditions represented by an impotent central Government and an Arab sheikh enjoying a large measure of administrative independence. The effect of these conditions is to my mind that the company’s best interests would suffer, and our national interests as well, if they are to pursue their enterprise through the Persian Government in spite of the sheikh ; and that, in the particular matter under reference, the sheikh would certainly ask our advice upon the terms offered him by the company. It is clearly necessary, therefore, that we should understand fully the real value to him of the terms offered, and that they should be such that, if referred to, we could honestly advise the sheikh that his interests were met thereby, and that he should accept them in satisfaction. 6 . This is the aspect in which the questions at issue present themselves to me, and I shall be glad if you will communicate my views to the company’s agents at Mohammerah with my compliments, asking at the same time that it be understood that they are given with diffidence for what they are worth, and that I am quite unable to conjecture how far His Majesty’s Government would or would not be inclined to endorse them. They are based on the belief that in their treatment of the rulers of Mohammerah, with whom, throughout the life of their distinguished enter prise, they will presumably be in the closest direct intercourse, a policy of dignified conciliation, within reasonable limits, will serve the permanent interests of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, as well as our natural interests, present and future, far better than one of a contrary character. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, [1845 6—1] C6 Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Consul-General Cox. Sir, Mohammerah, November 9, 1910. I HAVE the honour to refer to the marginally cited correspondence* on the subject of the proposal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) to bore for oil at Ahwaz, and to forward in this connection a copy of a further communication, dated the 8 th November, which I have received from the managing agents of the company on the subject, together with a copy of my letter in reply thereto. 2 . It will be seen that the company, in violation of the second part of article 3 of their concession,! propose to start work in the sheikh’s lands, without committing the company to any specific promises to the sheikh, and to temporise with him in the matter of terms, and in fact deceive him, with the object of enabling them to bring pressure to bear on him from Tehran. Sooner than accede to such terms as they granted to the Bakhtiari khans, they would, if necessary, abandon all idea of drilling in the sheikh’s territory, a course, I need hardly add, which would meet with the enthu siastic concurrence of his Excellency, who is by no means anxious to see any more of the oil company's activities than he does already. 3. I have submitted a detailed statement of the sheikh’s position in the matter in the correspon lence cited above, which came under review in your letter of the 2 nd October to the Government of India; it soems therefore unnecessary for me to discuss the subject further, and I would beg that I may receive instructions as to the attitude that I should adopt in the matter, as I can scarcely doubt that the sheikh will not permit any work to be done by them in the said lands until the company has concluded an agreement with him, as provided for in article 3 of their concession. 4. I have forwarded of this communication, together with copies of my despatch of the 28th October, and of the sheikh’s firman for the Ahwaz lands, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. I have, &amp;c. A.

WE have the honour to advise you, in connection with this company’s proposal to commence drilling operations for petroleum on the hills at Ahwaz, that the question of an arrangement to be made with his Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah has now been fully considered and discussed by the board of this company. It has been decided that the course to be followed is for us to start our work at Ahwaz without committing the company to any specific promises to his Excellency the sheikh, and, if and when his Excellency the sheikh raises any objection, we will immediately stop work and appeal to the Government at Tehran. Our directors are, however, anxious that no action should, on anv account, be taken by us in opposition to his Excellency the sheikh, or that we should have any dealings with him in the matter of “ terms,” so creating a position which will enable us to represent to the Persian Government that they must take the necessary steps for placing us in a position to carry out the objects of the concession purchased by this company from the Persian Government. As to the “terms” which this company would be ultimately willing to make with his Excellencv the Sheikh of Mohammerah, we are instructed that the arrangement of these can be left till a later date, but the feeling of our directors is that, in no event, would they be disposed again to agree to such terms as they were, under force of circumstances, compelled to grant to the Bakhtiari khans, even in the form indicated by . * Residency telegram of June 10; Residency letter of October 2 to Foreign Department (copy sent to Tehran); and Mohammerah consulate letter of October 28, 1910. f Translation of extract from concession : “ The Government grants also to the concessionaire the right to acquire all other lands or buildings necessary for the same object, with the consent of the proprietors, on terms which shall be arranged between him and them, without the latter being allowed to raise claims of a nature to surcharge the price ordinarily current for the lands situated in their respective localities.”7 our managing director in his letter of the 23rd September, an extract from which we sent you with our letter of the 26th ultimo. Our directors further instruct us that, should any such terms be demanded by his Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah and, or, the Persian Government, they would, rather than accede to them, and if no other course were left to them, abandon all idea of drilling in his Excellency the sheikh’s territory, so leaving any oil there may be in such territory in statu quo, since under the terms of the company’s concession, it would not be practicable for anyone else to take it away. Enclosure 9 in No. 1 . Acting Consul Wilson to Messrs. Lloyd, Scott, and Co. Gentlemen, Mohammerah, November 9, 1910. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8 th November, on the subject of the proposal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to drill for oil at Ahwaz, and of the intention of your board to do so without previously coming to a definite arrangement on the subject with the sheikh. 2 . His Majesty’s Minister will he apprised in due course of the attitude and intention of your company in the matter. In the meanwhile it is my duty to warn you that I consider the action proposed to be contrary to the second clause of article 3 of Mr. W. K. D’Arcy’s concession, and ill-calculated to further the interests of your company in Arabistan.

To take matter out of sphere of private negotiations between sheikh and company would lead to conflict between Persian Government and sheikh, which, in view of former’s present suspicions and jealousy of our relations with sheikh, they would especially welcome, as they would ostensibly be acting on behalf of a British interest. It would therefore seem the less inexpedient of the two alternatives to postpone if possible any explanations [?] to the Persian Government until payment is due and the deduction actually made. This, however, if Persian Government had had no voice m the matter, would be high-handed and hard to justify if the question went to arbitration as provided in article 17 of concession. # . Whole question is very awkward one, and, if company persists, whichever . alternative is adopted bids ‘fair to provoke triangular duel between sheikh and ourselves In these circumstances I trust company may be strongly pressed to defer, unless arrangements can be made with sheikh without raising the question of surcharge, representation on lands of the sheikh until they become more essential to its prosperity than appears at present. . .

The Company intend, if the Shaikh objects, to stop work and claim compensation from the Persian Government; there is no doubt that the Shaikh will object. For the Legation to support such a claim would clearly be impolitic as it would compel the Persian Government to try and coerce the Shaikh. I beg to suggest that the Company be informed that we could not support their claim and moreover in their own interest they would be well advised to defer boring till some agreement w r ith the Shaikh has been arrived at. It is manifestly to the Company’s interest for them to retain the Shaikh’s goodwill, whether the Company are warranted in their interpretation of para graph 2 Article 3 or not. The Company has been informed by the Consul that if they commence boring operations without the Shaikh’s concurrence it must be on their sole responsibility as he considers their action would be contrary to their Concession (Article 3).

CONFIDENTIAL. [December 19.] Section 14. \ [43455] No. 1. &lt;Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. ,&lt;&amp;' I (No. 201.) Sir, Foreign Office, December 19, 1910. I HAVE received your despatch No. 209 of the 12th ultimo, relative to the proposal of the x\nglo-Persian Oil Company to bore for oil in the territories of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and to transmit to you herewith copies of a letter from the company and of a private communication addressed by their managing director to Mr. Mallet setting forth their views on the subject.* You will observe from a perusal of these papers, which reached this Office some few days later than your despatch above referred to, that the company are prepared to treat the sheikh in a more generous and conciliatory manner than the tone of the letters addressed to the acting British consul at Mohammerah by their local agents would appear to indicate. The situation which has given rise to this question has been produced by the past action of the Persian Government. In 1901, as you are aware, that Government granted to Mr. W. K. D’Arcy the exclusive right to bore for oil in certain parts of Persia, including the region in which the territories of the Sheikh of Mohammerah are situated, but subsequent!}^, in a firman granted to the sheikh by Mozaffer-ed-Din Shah in January 1903, used language by which they admitted, at least by implication, that, in conferring these privileges on Mr. D’Arcy, they had exceeded their powers, since the lands in question had belonged in the past to the sheikh, his tribesmen, and their ancestors. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as the legal successors of Mr. D’Arcy and his associates, are bound by the terms of the concession of 1901 to pay to the Persian Government a certain proportion of their profits, but are not bound to make a similar payment to any other person, and they are naturally anxious to avoid diminishing their profits by exposing themselves to any such necessity. The sheikh, however, is likely to insist on such a condition, especially in view' of the terms of the agreement concluded in 1905 by Mr. D’Arcy with the Bakhtiari Khans. (It is pointed out, however, that this agreement, having been extorted from Mr. D’Arcy by the Bakhtiari Khans in special circumstances, ought not to be used as a precedent.) The company then, anxious as they are to avoid, as Mr. Greenway puts it, paying for their oil twice, have two courses open to them. They can insist on the letter of their rights under the concession of 1901. This course would involve a settlement of the question whether or no the Persian Government exceeded their powers in granting that concession, and would moreover certainly bring the company into conflict with the sheikh. The settlement of the legal question, if possible at all (and it is not clear by v r hom it could be decided) could not be effected without endless delay and difficulty, and the interests not only of the company themselves but of His Majesty’s Government in those regions could not fail to be adversely affected by any dispute with the sheikh. His Excellency could in practice make all operations impossible, and it would be in the highest degree embarrassing for His Majesty’s representatives to be obliged to support the company against him and thus risk the loss of his goodwill. The company are therefore disposed to follow' the alternative course wdiich is to agree to pay the sheikh, should he demand it, a proportion of the profits derived from oil obtained in his territories, and to deduct an equivalent sum from the amount due to the Persian Government under that head. The necessity for doing this is unlikely to arise for some time, since at least a year or two must elapse before oil can be extracted from any point in the sheikh’s territories in paying quantities, but when the time comes, if it ever does, for this step to be taken, the company will hope to receive the support of His Majesty’s Government in inducing the Persian Government to acquiesce in it. . I am disposed to consider that, in view of the fact that the responsibility for the * Anglo-Persian Oil Company, December 5; Mr. Oreenway to Mr. Mallet, December 5, 1910. &gt;5 *—14] • ; ;.

If you share my opinion, you should instruct His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire and the acting British consul at Mohammerah to support the local agents ok^ the company in their efforts to conclude an agreement with the sheikh on the lines suggested, which are that they should pay him, in respect of any lands where they desire to bore for oil, adequate compensation for any disturbance and a fair rent while they occupy the land, and should restore it to its present condition if no oil is found there, or buy or lease it, as may be arranged, should oil be discovered. They should also pay the sheikh, if he demands it, a certain share of their profits. I may add that Mr. Greenway accompanied by Mr. James Hamilton, who is also connected with the oil company, will shortly leave London for Mohammerah, and the former proposes later on to proceed overland to Tehran. You are authorised to afford to these gentlemen, and to instruct His Majesty’s consular officers on the spot to extend to them, such assistance as they may require in the prosecution of their business.

Foreign Office to Anglo-Persian Oil Company gj r Foreign Office, December 19, 1910. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the hthGnstant, relative to the proposal of your company to bore for oil in the territories of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. It appears from this letter, and from the private communication of the same date addressed by you to Mr. Mallet, that your company are prepared to conclude an aoreement with the sheikh by which they would pay him in respect of any lands where they desire to bore for oil adequate compensation for any disturbance, and a fair rent while they occupy the land, and would restore it to its present condition if no oil were found there, or buy or lease it, as might be arranged, should oil be discovered. They w^ould also pay the sheikh, should he demand it, a certain share of the profits derived from his land. Sir E. Grey farther understands that, should your company agree to make the last-named payment to the sheikh, they would propose to deduct an equivalent amount from the sum which, under the terms of the concession of 1901, they are bound to pay to the Persian Government under the same head, and that they would then solicit the support of His Majesty’s Government in inducing the Persian Government to acquiesce in such a step. Before pronouncing an opinion on this proposal, Sir E. Grey is anxious to be in possession of the views of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and has accordingly forwarded to Sir G. Barclay copies of the correspondence above referred to, with an explanation of the circumstances and instructions to express his views on the case, and, should he consider your proposal justified, to authorise His Majesty’s consular officers on the spot to support the local agents of the company in their efforts to conclude an agreement with the sheikh on the lines suggested by you. With regard to the misunderstanding referred to in your letter, I am to transmit to you herewith copies of correspondence between the acting British consul at Mohammerah and the company’s agents, which has reached Sir E. Grey in a despatch recently received from Sir G. Barclay, ” from which it will be observed that the lattei was justified in the apprehensions which he felt as to the line which the company appeared determined to take, and therefore in sending the telegram which formed the basis of Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 18th ultimo, the first of the present correspondence. In his despatch referred to Sir G. Barclay expresses the opinion (which is also that of His Majesty’s consul at Bushire and of the acting British consul at Mohammerah) that, whatever may be the strict legal rights of the company under the concession of 1901, their best interests would be seived by tieating the sheikh in such a manner as to keep him favourably disposed towards them as he has been in the past. Sir E. Grey concurs in this opinion, both on general grounds and because the settlement of the legal question referred to, if possible at all, could not be effected without endless delay and difficulty, which could not fail to be prejudicial to the inteiests of the company and without incurring the hostility of the sheikh, who could in practice make all their operations impossible. He is accordingly glad to obseive fiom letter under reply that the company are prepared to treat the sheikh m a generous and conciliatory manner, and to abstain from insisting on the couise indicated m t it enclosed correspondence. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. * Printed elsewhere.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. 'i [44293] vr. I {J [December 6.] Section 3. No. 1. Anglo-1 ersian Oil Company to Foreign Office.—(Received December 6.) Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, Dear Mr. Mallet, December 5, 1910. IN the accompanying official letter I have confined myself to dealing with the letter from you to which it is a reply, and to the misunderstanding on which that letter is based. I do not see what else I could do, but as, from private sources, I learn that the issue does not arise from the misunderstanding in question, or, at all events, if it arose there originally it now goes much deeper, I write you this further letter in the hope of saving time. I am told that the British consul in Mohammerah has expressed the opinion that the sheikh should get something more than compensation and rent or sale price of his lands at market value, in accordance with article 3 of the concession—something more in money I mean, apart from the indirect advantage that he will derive from the development of an important industry in his territory. If this information is incorrect, we shall be delighted to be corrected. If, on the other hand, it is correct, we shall be personally very glad if the sheikh gets a “ surcharge,” both because our greatest desire is to live in amity with him, and because, while getting generous terms from us hitherto, he has so far honourably kept his part of all bargains between us. I will go further, and say that, if it is your desire, we are ready, if you give us the assistance of the British Legation and consuls in Persia, and if the sheikh himself assists, to endeavour to secure a “ surcharge ” for him. But we are not prepared ourselves to pay twice over for oil. It is true that in the case of oil found in Bakhtiari territory we are in some danger of paying twice over, but we do not mean to pay it there if we can help it, and, in any case, that case must form no precedent. In the first place, the Bakhtiari agreement was not made by this company, but by the original concessionnaire and those then associated with him, and this company bought the concession with that, but with no other similar, liability attached to it. By the concession of May 1901 the Persian Government granted to the conces sionnaire the privilege inter alia to search for, obtain, &amp;c., and sell, &amp;c., petroleum, &amp;c., in a specified area, which includes inter alia the Bakhtiari and the sheikh’s territories, in consideration of certain payments. Such of the payments as were required to be made to the Persian Government have been made. The remaining payment is in the form of a share of profits when profits accrue. The Persian Government also bound “ itself to take all necessary measures to secure the safety and the carrying out of the object of this concession ” (article 14). It is true that in the case of oil found in the Bahktiari country we are even now in some danger of having to pay for oil twice over, but that was altogether an exceptional case* in which the concessionnaire and those associated with him were the victims of force majeure. In the year 1905, before the concession had been bought by this company, the exploring party employed by the concessionnaire and his associates to search for oil was held up by the Bakhtiaris in their country vi et armis. They scofled at the concession granted by the Persian Government, and ordered the exploring party to desist or pay up. In a settled country the concessionnaire could have called upon the Government to make good its grant. As matters stood, to do this would have meant at the best an interminable delay, and, with a pistol at his head, the concessionnaire paid. Ibis payment is embodied in the Bakhtiari agreement of which you know—an agreement made under stress of circumstances. It leaves us with an equitable claim on the Persian Government for whatever has been or will have to be paid to the Bakhtiaris in excess of what was in any case due under paragraph 2, article 3 of the concession, viz., “ prices ordinarily current for lands in their respective localities without surcharge. I have written “an equitable claim,” because inasmuch as stress of circumstances prevented the concessionnaire’s calling on the Persian Government to make good [1805/-3] , . , , n2 its grant with any chance of success he did not so call upon it, and it may consequently, when the time comes, seek to evade our claim on the plea that the concessionnaire did not give it an opportunity of making good its pledge in this But the distressing circumstances in which the concessionnaire stood when th./^ Bakhtiaris held him up no longer exist. So far as it is humanly possible to judge, prior to removing oil from the oil-fields in the Bakhtian country, we have a supply there sufficient for the need of any piping and refining installations that we can put for several years to come, and we have no desire to pay (or risk paying) twice over for any more oil now. . . , , . i . i . Presuming that we can reckon on your support in regard to our undoubted rights, what we want in regard to oil in territories other than Bakhtiari territory is to say in the most friendly way to the land-owners, “ Are you willing to give us land on the terms described in paragraph 2, article 3 of our concession ? If they s&amp;y “Yes,” cadit qucestio. . If they say, “No; we want x because of the oil,” or “x of or on the oil, or “ x of the oil profits,” then we can go to the Persian Government and request them either to make good their grant, or, what is better, consent to the surcharge demanded by the land-owners (adjudicated upon, perhaps, by officers of the British Government in Persia) being deducted from the 16 per cent, share of profits which we are to pay under the concession. „ . ,. Mv directors feel confident that none of the officers of the British Government is inclined to suggest that we should pay for the oil twice over. 1 he only reason for urgency in the matter is that we have sent some drilling plant to Ahwaz, and we do not want it to be idle for any length of time. Otherwise the matter could he over till I get out to Mohammerah, where it has been decided that I must go to settle many questions that have cropped up, and to put our whole organisation at the fields and in Mohammerah on a more satisfactory basis. I feel confident that if 1 had had the opportunity of discussing the matter verbally with His Britannic Majesty s consul at Mohammerah and with the sheikh, neither difficulty nor misunderstanding would have arisen But I cannot get out to Mohammerah until the middle of January, and I would very much like to have at least the principle settled to your satisfaction before I start. .

Anglo-Persian Oil Company to Foreign Office.—(Received December G.) Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, Sir, December 5, 1910. I HA\ E now been able to place your letter of the 18th ultimo before my board, and I am to inform you that, in deference to the desire expressed in the last paragraph of your letter, all negotiations and preparations for boring for oil in the territory of the Sheikh of Mohammerah have been suspended in the meantime. But I am also to inform you that your letter, and consequently probably also Sir Edward Grey s views on the matter, are based on a misunderstanding. Your letter says :— “ The local representatives of your company in Persia have stated to His Majesty’s acting consul at Mohammerah that they intend to bore for oil in the territory of the Sheikh of Mohammerah without securing his previous assent, alleging that the second paragraph of article 3 of your concession applies only to works mentioned in article 2 .” We do not know how the misunderstanding has arisen, but we do not put forward any such claim. Y e are quite ready to apply the second paragraph of article 3 to any lands that we require for any purpose whatsoever, and which do not come under paragraph 1, article 3. If that, then, is the only issue between us, I hope that you will see your way to our resuming negotiations with the sheikh with a view to our searching for oil in his territory. We are quite prepared to pay to him, or other owner or lessee of lands where we may desire to put down bore-holes, adequate compensation for any disturbance and a fair rent while we occupy the land, to restore it to its present condition if we strike no oil and leave it, and [or] to buy it in accordance with clause 2 , article 3 , or lease it, according to what arrangement may result from friendly negotiations, in the event of our finding oil anywhere. I beg to assure you that my directors desire to develop the concession in a manner congenial and profitable to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and in pursuance of this we shall instruct our Persian agents not to press the sheikh in any way, but to cease work, if he objects to our searching for oil, even in waste lands, pending further amicable negotiations. In this policy my board trusts that it will enjoy the support of the British Legation and consuls in Persia. I have, &amp;c. C. GREENWAY, Managing Director. COPY TO INDIA 3-0 91?..

The original of this letter was shown to me by the Shaikh yesterday. 2. It will be seen that strong objection is taken to certain clauses, not specified, and that the Shaikh is requested to do what he can to cancel the agreement and to demand that it be countersigned by the Ministry for 1 oreign Affairs. 3 . The Shaikh takes a philosophical view of the question, and seems half inclined not to reply to the letter: he points out, with truth, that the Oil Company’s concession from His Imperial Majesty the Shah ol 1901 is a sufficient authority to him to make such an agreement, containing as it does (Article 3) express provision for the acquisition of land by the Company. 4 .

Since the good intentions of Your Excellency in regard to this country are well known to all, and since the nobles and the whole Government have been at all times obliged to you, and pleased at your attitude, they are sure that you will never fail to deal boldly with any diffi culties that may arise in Arabistan that might prejudice the Government and people there. Knowing that persons so patriotic as Your Excellency are not to be found they have at all times been free from anxiety in regard to those territories. But in order to inform Your Excellency in regard to various matter s in order that special attention may be paid to them, we think it necessary to inform you that several paragraphs of the said agreement are not consonant with the interests of the Persian Government and may be the cause of diffi culties to it and to Your Excellency in the future. The Company drew up most of these clauses for its own benefit, and it was very necessary that your signature should have been attached to the agreement with the approval of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs— such a step would have been in accordance with present arrangements and conformable to the relations which exist between us. In regard to the objectionable clauses we should have made careful investigation. Several of them are quite contrary to your interests and ours, which are identical: in fact they are most injurious. We must draw Your Excellency’s particular attention to the fact that when drawing up such agreements it is necessary to obtain previously the permission and sanction of the chief officers of Government. This is particularly the case in regard to what has occurred, and the above agreement, which has been concluded without the permission and sanction of Government, is inimical to the interests, of those concerned. We are sure that in view of your patriotism, for which you are well known, you will in no case conclude such agreements without previous sanction. Accordingly in order to put in force the rule of which we have apprised vou above, I am sure that you will agree with me that till such agreements tave received previous examination at the hands of the principal officers of Government, and subsequent countersignature, they must be regarded as null and void, and cannot be accepted officially. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has, therefore, addressed you in this sense and trusts that you will use your discretion in delaying the putting in force* of this agreement, and in whatever way possible obliterate lit and demand on it the signature and confirmation of this Ministry.

Your letter No. 2353 of the 25th Sha’ban has been received. I am most grateful for your kind sentiments. I am busy as usual looking after the frontier and seeing to the order and arrangement of the affairs of Arabistan. I was much surprised at what you wrote in regard to my agreement with the Oil Company in respect of a piece of land, my own property, which I leased to them on Jazirat al Khidar (’Abadan Island). You stated that some of its provisions were against the interests of the State and of myself, and that it could not receive official recognition. I venture with great repect to submit my reply. I would ask Your Excellency to compare the agreement with the conces sion which the Persian Government gave to the Oil Company, and to note with care the clauses thereof, in particular clause 3. You will then see for yourself the care with which I drew up the clauses of my own agreement. If the original concession of the Company, and the agreements between them and others can be refused recognition and called in question, then mine may also be disputed though even if some flaw be found in it. I do not think that it could be made an excuse for cancellation and refusal of recognition, for I obveyed strictly the clauses of the Company's concession from the Persian Government, and leased a piece of ground to them, although the Company have the right to purchase according to their concession. I did not, however, think this step advisable in my own interests, and, therefore, handed over to them a defined and restricted area of land. I am sure that if the Ministers of State are unbiassed, they will confirm the correctness of my attitude. 8. O. P. I.—No. 1807 F. D,—5«12*10—40—L. G.

With reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 906, dated 27th August 1910, I have the honour to forward copies of further correspon dence which has reached me on the subject of the proposal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, to drill at or near Ahwaz. 2. It will be seen that the Managing Director is prepared to put before his Board a proposal that the company should to cZi S X teVmo. undertake to pay to the Shaikh 3 per cent. on the profits of any oil obtained within his territory, and asks for an expression of your views on this proposal. 3 . It appears that this propo&gt;al was in Mr. Lloyd’s mind when the agree ment between the Company and the Shaikh was in the making at Ahwaz, and as it is substantially the same as the present arrangement between the Comjmny and the Bakhtiari Khans, it is difficult to understand Mr. Lloyd’s statement that “ it was not in his mind at all that this friendly arrangement should be on the basis which was made by the Company with the Bakhtiari”. I submit, therefore, that my interpretation of the undertaking, as given in my letter, No. 903 of 26th August to the Company, is substantially accurate. 4. If this arrangement be agreed to by the Board, I foresee no difficulty in negotiating a mutually satisfactory agreement between the Shaikh and the Company, the rent for the lands being nil until oil is struck, and not over £1 per acre if this contingency should fortunately occur. Dated the 30th August 1910. From— Messes. Lloyd Scott &amp; Co., Ld., Managing Agents, AnglorPersian Oil Company, Ltd., To—His Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan. We have the honour to acknowledge and thank you for your letter No. 904, of the 27th instant, contents of which we have carefully noted. We will submit your letter to our Directors for their consideration, but we have the following remarks to make in connection therewith : — So far as this Company is concerned, His Excellency the Shaikh of Mohammerah has no locus standi in the matter. The Persian Government sold, in 1901, certain rights and privileges to this Company. As you are aware, a very heavy price was paid for these. If, on the Company proceeding to exercise these rights, obstruction is placed in its way by a second party who claims that the Persian Government sold to him also the same rights and at a heavy price, the Company’s recourse against such obstruction lies not with that second party hut with the Persian Government. This seems to us to be a case where the Company must, if and when it becomes necessary, rely on Tehran to accomplish its aims, looking to the fact that it merely seeks to exercise a right bought from and paid for to the Persian Government.2 . And such pressure can very well be brought to bear when it is borne in mind that uny claim for damages put forward by the Company for failure of the Persian Government to secure for it, free of obstruction, all rights under its concession, can, if necessary, be enforced by forfeiture of the share in profits to which the Persian Government would in due course become entitled. We are unaware what price His Excellency the Shaikh of Mohammerah paid in 1903 to the Persian Government for rights apparently sold in 1901 to the Company, but we think it very improbable that he gave a greater quid pro quo t\\a,n the Company has done, so that, however much His Excellency the Shaikh claims that his rights must be respected, the Company is in a very strong position to insist that its prior rights must also be respected. Lookino’ howe\ er to the fact that His Excellency the Shaikh did not claim mineral rights in June-July 1909, we think it unlikely that he will claim them now. It appears to us likely that had he seriously considered he had any claim to mineral r ghts in June-July 1909, he would have produced his Eirmans at that time, especially as you report that he had a general recollection that he had complete rights. e think you will agree that it would be very unlikely for His Excellency the Shaikh to give up anything that he thought he could legitimately claim or, possibly illegitimately get by “ bluff.” Undoubtedly this Company would expect to be compensated, if it were necessary to pay a second time for what has already been purchased, but then the Company does not propose to act in any such manner. We are instructed, as already advised you, that henceforth the Directors propose to act strictly on the lines of the concession. Paragraph 8 , first sentence of your letter appears to us to contain the crux of the position. You suggest financially interesting His Excellency the Shaikh in the prosperity of the wells at Ahwaz, if worked. The Company lias already given an under taking to make some amicable arrangement with him in the event of oil being tapped (naturally in the commercially paying quantities, as you presume), but that has nothing whatever to do with the Company’s right under its concession to prospect for oil at Ahwaz. We cannot agree with your remark that the Company has been unham pered by the slightest local opposition, but that is a matter into which we need not enter here. We do not consider it necessary at all for the Company to thieaion IPs I xcellency the Shaikh with the wrath of the Central Government at Tehran. We consider it necessary to threaten Tehran, and if and wl en the Shaikh obstructs the Company in exercising its rights purchased from the Central Government, our opinion being as first stated above, that from the Company s point of view the Shaikh has no locus standi in the matter. We are sure the Directors will give the subject matter of your letter under acknowlodgment their very careful consideration, but their instructions to us indicate the unlikelihood of their agreeing to pay anything to His Excellency the Shaikh in excess of the surface value of the land taken up for the purpose of working oil at Ahwaz. Dated the 26th October 1910. From —Messrs. Lloyd Scott &amp; Co., Ltd., Managing Agents, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd, To—His Majesty’s Consul for Arahistan. In connection with past correspondence on the subject of this Company’s proposal to drill for oil at Ahwaz, we have the honour to attach hereto extracts from letters received from the Managing Director, dated 23rd and 30th ultimo. In accordance with the final sentence thereof, we will be grateful if you will forward the attached papers to the Honourable the Political Pesident, and seek on our behalf, any expression of his opinion or comment, which he may wish to make.Extract from letter dated the 30th September 1910. Concession. With reference to your correspondence with Lieutenant W^ilson on the question of the Shaikh’s rights, I would point out that the Firman of January 19)3 only granted “ the said lands” and “ to exercise in the said lands the possessory rights of ownership of every kind This in most grants of this nature in other countries does not cover t- mineral rights” which are usually held as being the property of the original owner, unless specifically mentioned in the grant. Therefore the Shaikh’s claim is weak in two respects. ( 1 ) His Firman is of a later date than our Concession, and therefore was subject to the latter, and ( 2 ) there is nothing to show that the Persian Government in granting that t irman, ever intended to part with the mineral rights, which, moreover, at the date of the Firman, were not theirs. However, it is obviously to our interest to maintain the good will of the Shaikh and if we can, without in any way admitting any rights on his part to minerals, get him to agree to some such arrangement as that suggested in my last letter, it will be cons dered by my Board. I should, however, like to get (through Lieutenant Wilson) an expression of Colonel Cox’s views on the subject, as any suggestion from him would, I know, carry great weight with my co-Hirectors. Extract from a letter dated 23rd September 1910. Drilliny at A hicaz. — With reference to the correspondence exchanged between yourselves and Lieutenant Wilson, Mr. Lloyd states that the under taking given to the Shaikh was neither more nor less than as stated in Colonel Cox’s note, viz., that “ the Company would be inclined to come to some friendly arrangement with him” and that it was not in his mind at all that this “friendly arrangement ” should be on the basis of that which was made with the Bakhtiaris under quite different circumstances. He, however, points out that Lieutenant Wilson was not present at the portion of the interview when this point was discussed, hut only came in at the end, when all the points had been settled. He says that what he had in mind was that the Shaikh might be given in some form or other the equivalent of the “ 3 per cent, on profits” which is what the Bakhtiaris will obtain by means of the shares they are to receive. The difficulty is that these profits cannot very well be defined in a way that would probably be satisfactory to the Shaikh, without the formation of a sepa rate company- a step which my Directors would not for a moment consider at the present time —but if you think the Shaikh would be satisfied with an under taking from us to pay him 3 per cent, on the profits of any oil obtained within his territory (such territory to be clearly indicated and not to be open to question), such profits being based upon the same price for Crude Oil as is paid to the Bakhtiari Oil Company, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s state ment of these profits being accepted by the Shaikh as conclusive and final, with out any questior^ I will put the proposal before my Board, although I have no reason for supposing that they would approve of such an arrangement and that they might not rather abandon altogether the idea of working at Ahwaz. No. 8005, dated Buskire, the 6 th November 1910 (Confidential). From—Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah. I have the honour to refer to your letter, No. 1212 , dated 28th October, and previous correspondence, in connection with the plans of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the inception of boring operations in the territorial limits of the fehaikh of Mohammerah, and the terms which should or should not be made with him in case of oil being tapped in paying quantity.4 2. In expressing Lis own ideas regarding: — (i) The nature of the present rights of the Shaikh and his tribesmen in the soil. ^ (ii) The terms which might fairly be offered him by the Oil Company as an amicable satisfaction of them, the Managing Director is good enough to say that he would be glad to know my personal views. 3. A pronouncement in regard to the former problem seems to involve the investigation and settlement of both the following points ; (a) The precise nature of the tenure and rights, if any, over and in the soil enjoyed by the Shaikh and his tribes, anterior to and at the time of the grant by the Persian Government of the D’Arcy Concession. (b) The precise rights of the Shaikh and his tribes in the soil since the grant of the former’s Firman in January 1903, and how far they hold good against the rights of the Oil Company under the D’Arcy Concession. Then again the following two queries seem to be suggestee by the record; (c) The Company having, in the Agreement with the Shaikh of 16th July 1909, acknowledged that the right to treasure trove is vested in the Shaikh; could they make good to him the argument that the cognate right in regard to minerals is not also vested in him ? In this connection I would point out that, in framing Article 13 of the Agreement which was finally concluded between the Company and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, Mr. Lloyd and I in consultation were at pains, in the interests of the Company, to alter the wording of the Article on this subject numbered (11) in the draft sent to His Majesty’s Foreign Office with Mr. Wallace s letter of 9 th June 1909, and to omit any pregnant allusion to minerals. The Manag ing Director’s draft ran : — “ (11) The Company as lessees of the land agree that all “ treasure trove ” throughout the lands leased to the Company belongs to the Shaikh alone. By “treasure trove” is meant go/d and silver or precious metals in a natural state, or coins or objects of anti quity of the same metals ”. In the Agreement concluded this became: — “ (13) The Company as lessees of these lands agree that all treasure trove throughout the lands leased to the Company and other lands given under this Agreement belongs to the Shaikh alone. By “trea sure trove ” is meant coins, jewellery and objects of antiquity ”. It will be noted that the words in Italics were omitted. (d). Is it usual or necessary to regard the right to allow or disallow boring for oil as a “ Mineral Right ” properly so called ? In fact, is the question of the possession or non-possession by the Shaikh of “ Mineral Rights ” generally, involved at all in the present project under discussion ? I do not feel qualified to give an authoritative answer on any of these four questions, and merely indicate them to make it clear that, according to my lights, the determination of the real position of the Shaikh and the Company in regard to the question of the Oil Boring and “ Mineral Rights ” would be by no means a simple matter. 4. Holding this view, I cannot help thinking that were the Company, in connection with their contemplated boring operations, to raise acutely the question of the incidence of “ Mineral Rights ” generally in Mohammerah territory, His .Majesty’s Government would be a good deal embarrased to decide what attitude to adopt towards it, and it would further seem to me probable that, in regard to the larger question, British interests might befound to lie in the opposite direction to the interests of the Comranv in the particular project under consideration. company in the What I mean is this. It would apparently be much more to our ad™n St s? - Government placing some mining concession in Arabistan in a foreign quarter oyer the heads of the Shaikh and ourselves could not be precluded q ’ But my suggestion is that the right to allow boring for oil is not necessarily if usually, included in the term “ Mineral Eights ” anil that it necessarily, advisable in this case to dis-associate tlm tw^f ^libt Ld stofdly 6 ^ it would be to the Company’s own interests not to raise the specific issue ^ dissect the question of the Shaikh’s precise rights, in either eas^n the present with him. 11 ' ° ^ reC ° UrSe t0 the alternative of an amica We compose 5. Speaking of the form which an amicable arrangement might take the Managing Director suggests that the Company might pay the Shaikh thp surface value of the ground taken up and allow him something equivalent to 3 per cent on the profits derived from the sale of the crude oil extracted in hil nn r w,;I , ^tv^ Ure 8 n 0 fr he C ° m P an y to be based on «« price paid for the crude Shaikh 6 Babbtiarl 0l1 Coni P an y au d to be accepted without question by the I find it difficult to express an opinion as to the fairness of this offer or as to whether, if the Shaikh referred to us for advice as he would be sure o do, it a\ oulclbe one which we could press him to accept, without fuller knowledge of the portent and probable results in practice of the arrangement in operation with the Bakhtiaris. Perhaps the Managing Director or toe omparry Agents would kindly supply further information on these points. I gather that the Ba.ditiari Company and the Exploitation Company are merely olxslioots of the main Company without any separate interests, and if so it would seem that the business interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would lie m working the Bakhtiari Company at no profit, the profit only occur ring at the stage where the Oil came to be handled by the parent Company. I quite sympathise with the latter. Having paid their price to the Central Government for their Concession, they naturally resent being called upon to repeat payments in other quarters for their privileges, but in this case we have to deal not with abstract truths but with the actual conditions represented by an impotent Central Government; and an Arab Shaikh emov- mg a large measure of administrative independence. The effect of these conditions is to my mind that the Company’s best interests would suffer and our national interests as well, if they were to pursue their enterprise through the Persian Government in spite of the Shaikh; and that in the particular matter under reference, the Shaikh would certainly ask our advice upon the terms olfered him by the Company. It is clearly necessary therefere that we should understand fully the real value to him of the terms ' offered, and that they should be such that, if referred to, we could honestly advise the Shaikh that his interests were met thereby and that he should accept them in satis- taction. 6 . This is the aspect in which the questions at issue present themselves to me, and I shall be glad if you will communicate my views to the Company’s Agents at Mohammerah with my compliments, asking at the same time that it he understood that they are given with diffidence for what they are worth, and that I am quite unable to conjecture how far His Majesty’s Government would or would not be inclined to endorse them. They are based on the belief that in their treatment of the Eulers of Mohammerah with whom, through the life of their distinguished enterprise, they will presumably be in the closest direct in tercourse, a policy of dignified conciliation, within reasonable limits, will serve the permanent interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as well as our national interests present and future, far better than one of a contrary character.1 cn ^ -v, {* 26 NOVI910 No. 2647 (Confidential), dated Bnshire, the 2 nd (received the 10 th) October 1910 .

The Company, whatever may be their stnct rights under their original concession, have to reckon with arf impotent Government at Tehran and the practical situation in Arabistan, and I have no doubt myself that it will prove more profitable for them in the long run to carry the Shaikh with them in their enterprise than to endeavour, so far as his territory is concerned, to pursue any policy in spite of him. J 3. The particular points raised by the correspondence, 'namely, (z) the precise nature of the Shaikh’s rights under his farmans, (zY) the bearing of the onginal L) Arcy Concession upon those rights, (m) the question whether the bhaikh s lands in which the Company may wish to operate are “ State lands ” or other lands under article (3) of that concession, will doubtless be examined when the time comes by the Legal Advisers to His Majesty’s Government. For the present they are not in practical issue, and there seems therefore no object in my discussing them at length. 1 should not omit to remark, however, that I do not know on what Mr. Black is relying, when he writes in his letter of 25th August “the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is fully aware of the point that the Shaikh possesses no min ^ r£ T Hg^ts,” nor is it the case that the Shaikh of Mohammerah made any such admission, in the same connection, as that with which he is credited in Mr. Black’s later letter of 26th August. As he had not his farmans with him at the time, and had a very hazy idea of their precise wording and details, it is obviously unlikely that he would have volunteered such a gratuitous admission, whether it were a fact or not. 4- lu conclusion I beg reference to Lieutenant Wilson’s letter No. 906 of 2 7th August to my address, paragraph 4, and would observe that Deh Mulla and Hindian being within a few miles of one another on the same river bank, and under the same headman, it would be natural to regard them as one place, the other place referred to being “ the lands east of the Karun,’’ a long way off.

With reference to the proposed commencement of drilling by you in the Shaikh’s territories near Ahwaz, I have discussed the question with Colonel Cox at Bushire. I think it desirable that before you take any active steps you should write to me officially stating precisely what your proposals are and on what lines you desire to conclude an agreement, bearing in mind that the bhaikh is fully cogni zant of the terms of the Bakhtiari Agreement of 1905, and is at present quite alive to the fact that they have got ^5,000 and about ^3,000 a year by bluff ing you and persistently opposing your work, whereas he has got £650 a year only by helping you and doing all that is possible to prevent your work being hampered. s Dated Mohammerah, the 13 th July 1910 . From— Mr. JOHN BLACK, Manager, Lloyd Scott and Company, Limited, To—His Majesty's Acting Consul for Arabistan, Mohammerah. We have the honour to refer to your demi-official letter to Mr. Black of the 16th ultimo, and to inform you in reply thereto that we propose some time this year, we cannot yet definitely say when, to erect one derrick with rig, with steam bpiler and engine, and most probably a workshop for tools and spares, at a spot which we will in due course select in the Ahwaz hills. There we will put down an experimental bore hole with the object of discovering whether there is any oil in that locality. We hold that we are entitled to carry out the above indicated experimental works by virtue of the rights given us under this Company’s concession from the Persian Government without making any lease or agreement at all with the Shaikh of Mohammerah. Our work will of necessity be carried out on uncultivated ground and will interfere with nobody. With regard to your verbal suggestion that we should agree to give the Shaikh the 3 per cent of the ordinary shares of any Company which may be formed to produce oil hereafter as a result of the above experimental work, we are in consultation with our Directors with cable, and will advise you of their views in due course. Our belief is that our Directors will readily agree to such a proposal. No. 906 , dated Mohammerah, the 27 th August 1910 . From—L ieutenant A. T.

I judged it necessary to explain the position of the Shaikh in some detail to the Company, in order to put the case clearly before them, but I have, I trust, said no more than was necessary for this purpose. I did not think it desirable at this stage to refer to the clause in the first farman (page 6, lines 18-20 of print), which provides that should any of the lands be ever required for the Government, they should pay a reasonable price to the Sardar Arfa’ and then take possession thereof.” This clause (which does not appear in the second farman) will be useful when negotiating with the Shaikh. 4. I may also draw attention to the fact, perhaps without significance, that the second farman mentions Deh Mulla, Hindian, and the lands east of the Karun, but the covering letter only mentions “ two places.” 5. Unforeseen delays have occurred in obtaining the plant for the Ahwaz works, and the question is not, therefore, a matter of immediate urgency, as was at first represented. 6. As it seems possible that references may be made to His Majesty’s Le gation from His Majesty’s Foreign Office in regard to this matter, I am sending a copy of this letter with all its enclosures to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Dated the 25 th August 1910 . From—The Managing Agents of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, To—His Majesty's Consul for Arabistan. * We have the honour to place before you for your information the following extract from a letter received by us from our Managing Director:— “ You have asked by wire this week if you may promise the Shaikh 3 per cent in ordinary shares of any Company formed to work oil at Ahwaz. I have not had the opportunity of bringing the matter before my Board, but in the meantime 1 may prognosticate that the answer will be certainly not. We do not want to incur the obligation or forming another Company, nor would the percentage basis be workable in any other way.” It is pointed out to us that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is fully aware of the point that the Shaikh possesses no mineral rights, and though the Company will give an undertaking to pay for the surface value of the land taken up in the same way as in the Bakhtiari country, there is no intention to pay anything further. We are advised that, if any difficulties or obstructions are placed in the way of our drilling at Ahwaz, the Company will, through the British Minister at Tehran, call upon the Persian Government to put us in possession under the terms of the concession, and, if they fail to do so, to claim damages. The Company’s intention is to firmly resist any further attempt at extortion similar to that which we have been subjected to in the case of the Bakhtiaris, and to henceforth deal, as far as possible, strictly in the lines of the terms of the concession. Little concessions may occasionally have to be made in order to secure and maintain the goodwill of the Shaikh and others, but in regard to the Shaikh, the Company considers it has already gone a long way in this respect. No. 903 , dated 26 th August 1910 . From—His Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, To—The Managing Agents, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited. In reply to your letter of the 25th instant in regard to your proposal to bore at Ahwaz. Before taking the matter further, I should like to be informed whether, when your Directors wrote the letter of which you are good enough to give me extracts, they had before them the undertaking given verbally to the Shaikh by your Mr. Lloyd last year, and which I understood at the time to indicate that the Company were prepared to treat with him on much the same basis as the Bakhtiari, quite independently of the surface rights question.4 I forward a copy of the official record of the understanding on the matter, for your information, in case you have not seen it. Extract from enclosure 2 to Political Resident's No. Q‘Commercial t dated 25th July igog, to the Foreign Office {forwarded to Foreign Department under endorsement No. lyggof the 26th July). Notes on the details of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s agreement with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, dated 16th July 1909. Article ij .—This article differs somewhat from the Company’s draft. It was thought best to specify only what treasure trove did cover, and not to put ideas into the Shaikh’s head by stating what it did not cover. He himself raised the question of the possible finding of oil in his limits. The rights of the Company in this eventuality were explained to him, but he was given to understand verbally by the Company’s Agent that in the event of separate springs of oil being tapped within his limits, the Company would be inclined to come to some friendly arrangement with him. Dated the 26 th August 1910 . From—The Managing Agents, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, To—His Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan. We have the honour to advise you that when we cabled to London regarding the issue to His Excellency the Shaikh of Mohammerah of 3 per cent of the ordinary shares of any Company which might be formed to produce oil at Ahwaz, we had before us the notes made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at the time an agreement with the Shaikh was being drawn up, an extract from which is attached to your letter under acknowledgment. Further, in replying to us, as per extract and remarks submitted to you yesterday, our Managing Director had a copy of these notes before him also. Our understanding of the note on article 13 of the agreement is that it was carefully explained at the time \y the Shaikh of Mohammerah that, although he had no mineral rights whatever, under his firman from the Persian Government which holds against the Company’s concession, still the Company might be willing to make him some gratuitous payment in the event of oil being tapped in Arabistan. This has, however, nothing to do with the prospecting and drilling work we propose to undertake at Ahwaz. His Excellency the Shaikh would probably bring the matter up, in the event of oil being found as a result of our operations at Ahwaz, and in such case we would be pleased to ask our Directors for their instructions in the matter. We think it very improbable the Directors will submit again to the extor tionate robbery they had of necessity to suffer at the hands of the Bakhtiaris. No, 904 , dated Mohammerah, the 27 th August 1910 . From— Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, I. A., Acting Consul for Arabistan, To—Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited. I have to acknowledge receipt of your letters of 25th and 26th August re garding your proposal to bore for oil at Ahwaz. 2 . I gather that your Company claims that it has the right under article 1 of its concession to prospect for oil anywhere within the provinces covered by the concession, without asking leave or paying rent to anyone, the provisions of article 3 being held to apply only to article 2, and that in Consequence your Company is not prepared to make any payment to the Shaikh of Mohammerah for the rights to prospect oil in his lands. Lii(^2 3. It further appears that your Company, whilst prepared to comoensate for the ^ ur f a ce value of the land taken up, is not prepared to pay the Shaikh anythin? further though ,t nught be willing to make l/m some gra^uitous payment m hf event of o.l betng tapped m hts lands, with the proviso, presumably, that it is tapped m paying quantities. y ’ 15 The proposal to interest the Shaikh financially in the prosperity of the con cern, were o.l to be tapped, and worked, by giving him 3 per cent of the ordinary shares of any Company formed to work oil in the territory under his control is not accepted by the Directors, it not being intended to form a special Company !K ga 4 h tf r -|!h at y ° Ur , Dlrectors woul . d be equally averse to any other scheme whereby the Shaikh received a payment of any kind calculated on the profits to be derived • r °tT 1 ' n ' T St ^ hwaz ’ as the y decline to recognise that he has any rights in the minerals in or below the lands. y * 15 j rv * J^ Shai !&lt; h 0WnS l th ? se lands in virtue of Armans granted by Muzaffar- ud-Din Shah in the month of Shawal 1320 (January 1903). One farman which relates to the Karun lands (which in common parlance include Ahwaz), ’ grants he said lands to him and to h.s tribes in perpetuity : it prohibits him and h s tribes from transferring or selling the lands to foreigners, and - permits and ^every 1 imh™ eXerC,Se ' n th6 Sa ‘ d ' ands the P osses “ry rights of ownership A further farman of the same date grants to the Shaikh personally, among t0 the 6331 ° f the Karun ” ( no mention being made ol the tribes of the Shaikh) on the same conditions as the lands above referred to. 5. These farmans were obtained as a quid fro quo in exchange for the surrender ot va.uable privileges enjoyed by the Shaikh previous to 1003. They grant to him in the most definite way the complete ownership of the land, and he may fairly point out, if his claim to mineral rights be contested, that he paid a heavy price for the farman, and that his rights must be respected. I may remark that when the agreement was being discussed in June and July iqoq the Shaikh was not aware of the precise wording of his farman, and beyond a general re collection that it gave him complete rights over the lands, could give us no in formation as to its scope, it was only early in this year that the original far- Tu . we I [ e . brou g ht out b y the ^aikh and scrutinized by him, with the assistance o naji Kais, true copies being taken for the use of His Majesty’s Government. 6 On the other hand, your Directors may equally truly say that they have paid a heavy price for their concession and expect to be put in possession of their rights and to be compensated if they have to purchase from others the mineral and other rights for which they paid the Persian Government in 1901. 7* The date of Mr. D’Arcy’s concession is 1901, two years previous to that 1 of the Shaikh s farmans, and it may therefore reasonably be urged that the Persian Government had no right or power to give to the Shaikh exclusive and complete rights of ownership over the said lands. But the Shaikh may reply that the Persian Government had no right in his lands, which were never in the gift of the Persian Government, and this contention would gain force from the fact that it is admitted in the first farman that the Karun lands have been in the possession of the forefathers of the present Shaikh and his tribes. 8. The position is a difficult one, and in approaching it I would remind you that my object in advocating an arrangement whereby the Shaikh would be financially interested in the prosperity of the oil wells at Ahwaz, if worked, was to secure the co-operation of the local authorities with the Company in the future as well as for the present. The Government of this country shows no tendency to centralize itself at, Tehran or to become stronger relatively to the local authorities, and it is in my opinion important that the Company should not have to rely on pressure from Tehran for the accomplishment of its aims. I hat it has been able to push forward its works in Arabistan unhampered by the slightest local opposition, untroubled with theft or robbery, and in friendly co-operation with the local authorities is due to the fact that we have hithertomade our arrangements with the Shaikh locally in an amicable manner, and not threatened him with the wrath of the Central Government at Tehran, to which he is less inclined to defer than formerly, in view of the present state of affairs there. 9. I think that it is possible that an arrangement may be come to whereby the Shaikh should receive from the Company an annual icntal per acre for the ground taken up for the purposes of boring and exploitation. This rental would no doubt be in excess of the value of the land for agricultural purposes, but in this way the question of mineral rights might be avoided. Whether it will be possible to induce the Shaikh to forego his rents during the period of prospecting remains to be seen. I will do my best in the matter. 10. I have, I trust, shown that the claims of the Shaikh are in no way fic titious, but worthy of careful consideration, in view of his exceptional position in Arabist an, and that it is in the interests of your Company to approach the ques tion in a conciliatory spirit, recognising that the question has two sides, and that, whatever we may think of the conduct of the Persian Government in granting exclusive rights to one party subsequent to having parted with certain rights to another party, we cannot blame the Shaikh for seeking to get what his farman entitles him to, and for which he has paid a heavy price. 11. lam quite prepared to enter on negotiations and to do my utmost to arrange a satisfactory settlement, but I think that a more liberal anangement than that adumbrated by the Directors may be necessary, in view of all the facts. I hope to deal in a separate letter with the position of the Persian Govern ment, vis-df'vis the Company in regard to the apparently somewhat illusory rights granted to the Company by articles 3 and 4 of Mr. D Arcy s concession.(o [This Docmgent is tiie Property of His B ritannic Majesty’s Crovemment.] I HAA E the honour to transmit copy of a despatch addressed to the Government of India by His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, respecting a proposal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to bore for oil in the territories of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. I rom the correspondence enclosed in Colonel Cox’s despatch you will see that the oil company claims the right under article 1 of its concession to prospect for oil anywhere within the provinces covered by the concession without asking leave or paying rent to anyone, and that it is not prepared to make any payment to the Sheikh of Mohammerah for the right to prospect for oil on his lands, and, moreover, even if oil is found, the company maintains that the sheikh is not properly entitled to any share in the profits though the company might be willing to make him some gratuitous payment. There is no doubt something to be said for the company’s view of the legal aspect of the case, but I concur with Colonel Cox and Lieutenant Wilson in thinking that it would be in the company’s best interest to treat the sheikh in this matter in such manner as to keep him as favourably disposed towards the company as he has shown himself in the past. I HAVE the honour to refer to my telegram of the 10th June, 1910, reporting the intention of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to commence boring for oil in the territory of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copies of correspondence which has since passed on the subject between His Majesty’s acting consul at Mohammerah and the agents of the company, received under cover of Lieutenant Wilson’s two reports. 2 . It will be seen from the papers that the oil company, feeling that they have been too complacent and too freely bled in their dealings in the past with the Bakhtiaris, and being disinclined to repeat the experience, express their intention to proceed on different lines in future, and to rely more on a strict interpreta tion and enforcement of their rights under the original D’Arcy concession in any further negotiations which they may require to embark upon with the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Lieutenant Wilson, in taking note of their intentions, expresses the view, on the grounds explained by him, that the pursuance of a too rigid policy with the Sheikh of Mohammerah is likely to be beset by more difficulties than the company have perhaps fully realised, and advises them to shape their contemplated negotiations on more liberal and elastic lines. With this view I generally concur. The company, whatever may be their strict rights under their original concession, have to reckon with an impotent Government at Tehran and the practical situation in Arabistan, and I have no doubt myself that it will prove more profitable for them in the long run to carry the sheikh with them in their enterprise than to endeavour, so far as Ins territory is concerned, to pursue any policy in spite of him. t . . ~ - - [43455] CONFIDENTIAL.

The particular points raised by the correspondence, namely, ( 1 ) the preclusive nature of the sheikh’s rights under his firmans, (2) the bearing of the original D’Arcy concession upon those rights, (3) the question whether the sheikh’s lands in which the company may wish to operate are “ State lands ” or “ other lands ” under article 3 A ., of that concession, will doubtless be examined when the time comes by the legal advisers to His Majesty’s Government. For the present they are not in practical issue, and there seems therefore no object in my discussing them at length. I should not omit to remark, however, that I do not know on what Mr. Black is relying when he writes in his letter of the 25th August “ the political resident in the Persian Gulf is fully aware of the point that the sheikh possesses no mineral rights,” nor is it the case that the Sheikh of Mohammerah made any such admission in the same connection as that with which he is credited in Mr. Black’s later letter of the 26th August. As he had not his firmans with him at the time, and had a very hazy idea of their precise wording and details, it is obviously unlikely that he woiild have volunteered such a gratuitous admission, whether it were a fact or not. 4. In conclusion, I beg reference to Lieutenant Wilson’s letter of the 27th August to my address, paragraph 4, and would observe that Deh Mulla and Hindian being within a few miles of one another on the same river bank, and under the same headman, it would be natural to regard them as one place, the other place referred to being “ the lands east of the Karun ” a long way off.

WITH reference to the proposed commencement of drilling by you in the sheikh’s territories near Ahwaz, I have discussed the question with Colonel Cox at Bushire. I think it desirable that before you take any active steps you should write to me officially stating precisely what your proposals are, and on what lines you desire to conclude an agreement, bearing in mind that the sheikh is fully cognisant of the terms of the Bakhtiari agreement of 1905, and is at present quite alive to the fact that they have got 5,000L and about 3,000Z. a-year by bluffing you and persistently opposing your work, whereas he has got 650Z. a-year only by helping you and doing all that is possible to prevent your work being hampered. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON.Enclosure 4 in No. 1 . Mr. Black to Lieutenant Wilson. Si r &gt; Mohammerah, July 13, 1910. WE have the honour to refer to your demi-official letter to Mr. Black of the 16th ultimo, and to inform you, in reply thereto, that we propose some time this year, we cannot yet definitely say when, to erect one derrick with rig, with steam boiler and engine, and most probably a workshop for tools and spares, at a spot which we will in due couise select in the Ahwaz hills, dhere we wdl put down an experimental bore hole with the object of discovering whether there is any oil in that locality. We hold that we are entitled to carry out the above indicated experimental works by virtue of the rights given us under this company’s concession from the Persian Government without making any lease or agreement at all with the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Our work will of necessity be carried out on uncultivated ground, and will interfere with nobody. With regard to your verbal suggestion that we should agree to give the sheikh the 3 per cent, of the ordinary shares of any company which may be formed to produce oil hereafter as a result of the above experimental work, we are in consultation with our directors with cable, and will advise you of their views in due course. Our belief is that our directors will readily agree to such a proposal. We have, &amp;c. (For Lloyd, Scott, and Co. (Limited), Managing Agents), JOHN BLACK, Manager. Enclosure 5 in No. 1 .

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith copies of correspondence on the subject of a proposal by the oil company to bore for oil at Ahwaz, in the territories of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and in this connection would invite reference to Colonel Cox’s telegram No. 182 of the 10 th June to your address. 2. The translations of the firmans, to which reference is made, were forwarded to you by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, under his letter of the 26th June, and also to the Foreign Office. I have, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON, Acting Consul. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Lieutenant Wilson to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. Sir, Mohammerah, August 27, 1910. I HAVE the honour to refer to the correspondence, ending with my letter of the 16th July, regarding the proposal of the oil company to bore for oil at Ahwaz. 2 . I forward herewith further correspondence on the subject. 3. I judged it necessary to explain the position of the sheikh in some detail to the company in order to put the case clearly before them, but I have, I trust, said no more than was necessary for this purpose. I did not think it necessary at this stage to refer to the clause in the first firman (p. 6 , lines 18-20 of print), which provides that k ‘ should any of the lands be ever required for the Government, they should pay a reasonable price to the Sardar Arfa and then take possession thereof.” This clause (which does not appear in the second firman) will be useful when negotiating with the sheikh. 4. I may also draw attention to the fact, perhaps without significance, that the second firman mentions Deh Mulla, Hindian, and the lands east of the Karun, but the covering letter only mentions two places.4 &gt;'4*&lt; mi 5. Unforeseen delays have occurred in obtaining tbe plant for the Ahwaz works, and the question is not, therefore, a matter of immediate urgency, as was at first represented. 6 . As it seems possible that references may be made to His Majesty’s legation from His Majesty’s Foreign Office in regard to this matter, I am sending a copy of this /V letter, with all its enclosures, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. I have, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON, Acting Consul. Enclosure 7 in No. 1 . Anglo-Persian Oil Company to Lieutenant Wilson. Mohammerah, August 25, 1910. W E have the honour to place before you, for information, the following extract from a letter received by us from our managing director:— “You have asked by wire this week if you may promise the sheikh 3 per cent, in ordinary shares of any company formed to work oil at Ahwaz. I have not had the opportunity of bringing the latter before my board, but in the meantime I may prognosticate that the answer will be certainly not. We do not want to incur the obligation of forming another company, nor would a percentage basis be workable in any other form.” It is pointed out to us that the Resident is fully aware of the point that the sheikh has no mineral rights, and though the company will give an undertaking to pay for the surface value of the land taken up in the same way as in the Bakhtiari country, there is no intention of paying anything further. We are advised that, if any difficulties or obstructions are placed in the way of our drilling at Ahwaz, the company will, through the British Minister at Tehran, call upon the Persian Government to put us in possession under the terms of our concession, and, if they fail to do so, to claim damages. The company’s intention is to firmly resist any further attempt at extortion similar to that which we have been subjected to in the case of the Bakhtiaris, and to henceforth deal, as far as possible, strictly on the lines of the terms of the concession. Little concessions may occasionally have to be made in order to secure the good-will of the sheikh and others, but, in regard to the sheikh, the company considers it has already gone a long way in this respect. (For Lloyd, Scott, and Co., Limited), JOHN BLACK, Manager. Enclosure 8 in No. 1 . Lieutenant Wilson to Messrs. Lloyd, Scott, and Co. Mohammerdhy August 26, 1910. W11H reference to your letter of the 25th instant in regard to your proposal to bore for oil at Ahwaz, before taking the matter further I should like to be informed whether, when your directors wrote the letter of which you are good enough to give me extracts, they had before them the undertaking given verbally to the sheikh by your Mr. Lloyd last year, and which, I understood at the time, to indicate that the company were prepared to treat with him on much the same basis as the Bakhtiari, quite independently of the surface rights question. I forward a copy of Jhe official record of the understanding on this matter, in case you have not seen it. I am, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON.-linclosure y m No. 1. Notes on the Details of the Arte/b-PersianOil Company's Agreement with the oheikh of Mohammerah, dated July 16, 1910. ,, , 1S r- Thl s article differs somewhat from the company’s draft. It was thought best to specify what treasure-trove did cover, and not to put ideas into the sheikh s head by stating what it did not cover. He himself raised the question of the possible finding of oil in his limits. The rights of the company in this eventuality were explained to him but he was given to understand verbally by the company’s agents that in the event of separate springs of oil being tapped within his limits, the company would be inclined to come to some friendly arrangement with him Enclosure 10 in No. 1 . Messy's. Lloyd, Scott, and Co. to Lieutenant Wilson. TI 7 T 7 1 , . Mohammerah, August 26, 1910. WE have the honour to advise you, in reference to your letter of to-day’s date, that, when we cabled to London regarding the issue to his Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah of 3 per cent of the ordinary shares of any company which might be formed to produce oil at Ahwaz, we had before us the notes made by the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf at the time an agreement with the sheikh was being drawn up, an extract from which is attached to your letter under acknowledgment. further, m replying to us, as per extract and remarks submitted to you yesterday our managing director had a copy of these notes before him also. Our understanding of the note on article 13 of the agreement is that it was carefu } explained at the time by the Political Resident to his Excellency the sheikh that, although he had no mineral rights whatever under his firman from the Persian ^hich hold against the company s concession, still the company might be willing to make him some gratuitous pa 3 unent in the event of oil being tapped in Arabistan. This has, hov ever, nothing to do with the prospecting and drilling work we propose to undertake at Ahwaz. His Excellency the Sheikh would probably bring the matter up, in the event of oil being found as a result of our operations at Ahwaz, and in such case we would be pleased to ask our directors for their instructions in the matter. ^ e R very improbable that the directors will again submit to the extortionate robbery they had of necessity to suffer at the hands of the Bakhtiaris. (For Lloyd, Scott, and Co., Limited), JOHN BLACK, Manager. Enclosure 11 in No. 1 . Lieutenant W ilson to Anglo-Perslan Oil Company. Oentlemen,^ Mohammerah, August 27, 1910. I HA\ E to acknowledge receipt of your letters of the 25th and 26th August regarding your proposal to bore for oil at Ahwaz. 2 . I gather that your company claims that it has the right under article 1 of its concession to prospect for oil anywhere within the provinces covered by the concession without asking leave or paying rent to anyone, the provisions of article 3 being held to apply only to article 2 , and that, in consequence, your company is not prepared to make au y payment to the Sheikh of Mohammerah for the right to prospect oil in his lands. 3. It further appears that your company, whilst prepared to compensate for the surface value of the land taken up, is not prepared to pay the sheikh anything further, ? .ugh it might be willing to make him some gratuitous payment in the event of oil 3ei ng tapped in his lands, with the proviso, presumably, that it is tapped in paying quantities. [2968 gg- 1 ] C6 The proposal to interest the sheikh financially in the prosperity of the concern, were oil to be tapped and worked, by giving him 3 per cent, of the ordinary shares of any company formed to work oil in the territory under his control is not accepted by the directors, it not being intended to form a special company. I gather that your directors would be equally averse to any other scheme whereby the sheikh would ^ receive a payment of any kind calculated on the profits to be derived from the oil-wells at Ahwaz, as they decline to recognise that he has any rights in the minerals in or below the lands. 4. The sheikh owns these lands in virtue of firmans granted by Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah in the month of Shawal 1320 (January 1903). One firman, which relates to the Kanin lands (which in common parlance include Ahwaz), grants the said lands to him and to his tribes in perpetuity; it prohibits him and his tribes from transferring or selling the lands to foreigners, and “ permits and empowers them to exercise in the said lands the possessory rights of ownership of every kind.” A further firman of the same date grants to the sheikh personally, among other lands, “ the districts to the east of the Karun ” (no mention being made of the tribes of the sheikh) on the same conditions as the lands above referred to. 5. These firmans were obtained as a quid pro quo in exchange for the surrender of valuable privileges enjoyed by the sheikh previous to 1903. They grant to him in the most definite way the complete ownership of the land, and he may fairly point out, if his claim to mineral rights be contested, that he paid a heavy price for the firman, and that his rights must be respected. I may remark that when the agreement was being discussed in June and July 1909 the sheikh was not aware of the precise wording of his firman, and beyond a general recollection that it gave him complete rights over the lands, could give us no information as to its scope. It was only early in this year that the original firmans were brought out by the sheikh and scrutinised by him with the assistance of Haji Rais, true copies being taken for the use of His Majesty’s Government. 6 . On the other hand, your directors may with equal truth say that they have paid a heavy price for their concession, and expect to be put in possession of their rights, and to be compensated if they have to purchase from others the mineral and other rights for which they paid the Persian Government in 1901. 7. The date of Mr. D’Arcy’s concession is 1901, two years previous to that of the sheikh’s firman, and it may therefore reasonably be urged that the Persian Govern ment had no right or power to give to the sheikh exclusive and complete rights of ownership over the said lands. But the sheikh may reply that the Persian Government had no right in the first place to give the company mineral rights in his lands, which were never in the gift of the Persian Government, and this contention would gain force from the fact that it is admitted in the first firman that the Karun lands have been in the possession of the forefathers of the present sheikh and his tribes. 8 . The position is a difficult one, and in approaching it I would remind you that my object in advocating an arrangement whereby the sheikh would be financially interested in the prosperity of the oil-wells at Ahwaz, if worked, was to secure the co-operation of the local authorities with the company in the future as well as for the present. The Government of this country shows no tendency to centralise itself at Tehran or to become stronger relatively to the local authorities, and it is, in my opinion, important that the company should not have to rely on pressure from Tehran for the accomplishment of its aims. That it has been able to push forward its works in Arabistan unhampered by the slightest local opposition, untroubled with theft or robbery, and in friendly co-operation with the local authorities, is due to the fact that we have hitherto made our arrange ments with the sheikh locally in an amicable manner, and not threatened him with the wrath of the central Government at Tehran, to which he is less inclined to defer than formerly, in view of the present state of affairs there. 9. I think that it is possible that an arrangement may be come to whereby the sheikh should receive from the company an annual rental per acre for the ground taken up for the purposes of boring and exploitation. This rental would no doubt be in excess of the value of the land for agricultural purposes, but in this way the question of mineral rights might be avoided. Whether it will be possible to induce the sheikh to forgo his rents during the period of prospecting remains to be seen. I will do my best in the matter. 10 . I have, I trust, shown that the claims of the sheikh are in no way factitious, but worthy of careful consideration, in view of his exceptional position in Arabistan,and that it is in the interests of your company to approach, the question in a conciliatory spirit, recognising that the question has two sides, and that whatever we may think of the conduct of the Persian Grovernment in granting exclusive rights to one party subsequent to haying parted with certain rights to another party, we cannot ~ lame the sheikh for seeking to get that which his firman entitles him to, and for which he has paid a heavy price. 11 . I am quite prepared to enter on negotiations and to do my utmost to arrange a satisfactory settlement, but 1 think that a more liberal arrangement than that adumbrated by the directors may be necessary in view of all the facts. I hope to deal in a separate letter with the position of the Persian Government vis-d-vis the company in regard to the apparently somewhat illusory rights granted to the company by articles 3 and 4 of Mr. D’Arcy’s concession. I am, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON, Acting Consul.U-JTl [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,'! I BEG to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant on the question of my company’s intended boring for oil in the territory of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and conveying the views of Sir George Barclay, and Sir Edward Grey’s concurrence with same, on this question, and also the request that my company will for the present defer any boring operations in this territory without the consent of the sheikh.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform you that, according to a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, the local representatives of your company in Persia have stated to His Majesty’s acting consul at Mohammerah that they intend to bore for oil in the territory of the Sheikh of Mohammerah without securing his previous assent, alleging that the second paragraph of article 3 of your concession applies only to works mentioned in article 2. It is reported that if the sheikh objects your company proposes to stop work and to claim damages from the Persian Government. Sir G. Barclay states that the sheikh will certainly raise objections to the proposed action of your representatives, and that it would be impolitic both for your company to alienate the sheikh’s good-will and for His Majesty’s Legation to support such a claim as that foreshadowed above. In this view Sir E. Grey concurs, but he is unable to pronounce upon the exact interpretation of the articles of your concession cited above until he has received a full report on the subject, which is now in course of transmission by post. I am therefore directed to express to you his hope that you will for the present defer action as to boring for oil in the district in question without the assent of the Sheikh of Mohammerah.

[20023] Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 6 .) (No. 71.) Sir, ^ Tehran, May 14, 1910. WITH reference to my telegrams No. 194 of the 28th April and No. 207tof the l 2 nd May, I have the honour to report that the question of the right of the Sheikh of Mohammerah to lease land on Abadan Island to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was first alluded to by Sardar Assad in conversation with His Majesty’s Minister shortly before my arrival here, and was again brought up by him, but in a much more definite manner, at an interview which Mr. Churchill had with him on the 29th ultimo. The Minister of the Interior spoke in a peremptory tone, and demanded to be supplied with full particulars of the transaction. He asserted that Sardar Arfa had no right to lease or sell land, as it all belonged to the State, and stated that the Persian Government were about to appoint a commission to go to Mohammerah to investigate the transaction and assess the amount for which Sheikh Khazal was liable to the Government on account of State lands leased or sold by him. The Government would have no difficulty in dealing with the sheikh, forcibly if necessary, and they could even dismiss him and appoint another chief in his place. In reply, Mr. Churchill warned the Sardar Assad against taking any action that might be prejudicial to the company’s interests, and hinted also that perhaps His Majesty’s Government might have some understanding with the sheikh by which he would be entitled to their support against the Persian Government. Your telegram No. 115 of the 28th April reached me just at the moment when the restoration of the old Cabinet, in spite of the strenuous opposition of the two legations to the retention in it of Sani-ed-Dowleh, and the openly defiant attitude of Sardar Assad rendered a certain degree of aloofness on the part of the legation desirable, and instead of sending Mr. Churchill to give Sardar Assad a strong warning, I thought it better to act through Mr. Preece, who arrived recently in Tehran, and whose past relations with the Bakhtiaris made it easy for him to convey a message from me. Mr. Preece accordingly saw Sardar Assad on the 2 nd instant, and pointed out that under the terms of the concession the oil company were entitled to conclude arrange ments with Persian subjects for the acquisition or lease of land without the interference of the Persian Government, that the concessionnaires had recently agreed to pay o, 000 /. to the Bakhtiaris in connection with the agreement to acquire land for the laying of the pipe line without tbe Persian Government being consulted, and throughout the history of the oil concession both the Bakhtiari khans and the legation had always held that the dealings between the former and the company in no way came under the control of the Persian Government. The legation held the same view in the present case, and Sardar Assad, as a Bakhtiari, could not hold the opposite. Mr. Preece added that, as a friend, he could tell Sardar Assad that His Majesty s Government would not allow any interference with the Sheikh of Mohammerah that might create complica tions for the oil company. Sardar Assad, whom Mr. Preece thought had been to a considerable degree sobered by the warnings I have recently had to send him of the danger to his own position if he persisted in his unfriendly attitude to His Majesty s Government, professed to acquiesce in these views, and promised that the Persian Government would take no further action in the matter, and that the commission mentioned above would not go to Mohammerah. I will not fail to take a favourable opportunity to give a similar warning to the new Minister of the Interior. There can be no doubt that the object of Sardar Assad in desiring to raise this question was in the first instance to obtain for himself a part ot the moneys advanced to the sheikh either as loan or as rent, but he may also have desired to embroil his tribal enemy with the Persian Government. . As to the title of the sheikh to the lands in question, I have ascertained trom His Majesty’s consul at Aiohammerah that they derive firstly from hereditary occupation, as is the case with the Bakhtiaris and other tribes, and secondly from a grant by Imperial firman. The firman explicitly forbids the sale of the lands, so that by mlerence we may properly assume that they may be leased. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M.

Haji Mushir counted 2 bags, weighed the rest, found all correct, replaced the bags in the boxes, sealed the boxes with his own seal and left them with me till the evening, when he and his father dined with me and after dinner took away the boxes, explaining to the boatmen that they must tell no one, as the 1 boxes contained cartridges.

I also desire to pay the original amount at the rate of one thousand pounds per annum simultaneously with the interest, but as regards the instalments of the original amount above referred to, I shall be glad if I am given the option to put off the annual instalment of one thousand pounds in any particular year when the state of affairs makes it difficult for me to make the payment. It should be understood, however, that this will not relieve me from the obligation to refund the whole loan within ten years. I shall be obliged if the Consul, Mohammerah, can be authorised to give me, regularly, a month’s notice prior to the date when the payment falls due. Interest should run on the loan from the date when the Consul, Moham merah, pays me the same against my receipt. The refund of instalments is to be made in this way, that is, the amount due will be paid in English pounds or rupees or by drafts on well known banks against his receipt.

In continuation of my telegram from Fao, dated 17th instant, I have the honour to submit a copy of the Agreement concluded on 16th July 1909, between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Urgencies which I find awaiting disposal on my return to headquarters to day prevent my submitting with it, as I had intended, a memorandum of com ment which I have recorded in rough, together with a copy of my letter of assurance to the Sheikh in connection with the question of reversion. I shall do so by next post, and request that you will be pleased to await my further communication before the terms of the agreement are definitely examined. AGREEMENT entered into between the Sardar Arfa, Amir Nuyan, Sheikh Khazal Khan ibn Haji Jabir Khan, heirs and successors, and his tribesmen, on the one part, hereinafter called “ the Sheikh,” and Messrs. Anglo*Persian Oil Company, Limited, of London, on the other part, hereinafter called ” the Com pany,” in respect of lands required by the said Company in the territories of the former, for the purposes of their business, under the exclusive privileges of the Concession granted to Mr. W. K. D’Arcy by His Majesty the Shah of Persia on the 28th May 1901,Whereby it is agreed that — 1. The Sheikh undertakes to hire to the said Company an area free of date trees of 650 (six hundred and fifty) jaribs of 4,669 square yards per jarib, on Abadan Island, situated between the village of Baraim on the north-west and Buwardeh on the south-east, having a frontage of about 2,000 yards on the Shatt-al-Arab, and also a strip of land not less than thirty yards in breadth for a right of way connecting the land abovementioned with the Bahmanshir River ; but the public rights of way must remain. 2. Should the said Company find the ground selected as above, after further examination, not suitable for their requirements, they should have the right to select other sites of the same area and same description. Should the Company require more land, free of date trees, adjacent to the lands leased to them, the Sheikh undertakes, in case the Company asks for such land within a space of two years from the date of this agreement, to grant them land not exceeding one hundred jaribs in area, at the same moderate rate. If the said Company ask for more land after two years from the date of this agreement, they shall pay rental at the fair current rate of the time for similar land in those localities. 3. The Sheikh further undertakes to grant free of charge to the Company a strip of land for the laying of such pipe-lines as may be necessary, above or below ground, situated in his lands or in those lands for the time being under his jurisdiction, or leased or purchased by him from others, with success thereto ; and also to grant free, in connection with the said pipe-line, such uncultivated land as may be needed by them for telegraph or telephone stations, or pump ing stations, or quarters for line inspectors and staff, having an area of three jaribs for each pumping station, and one and a half jaribs for each of the other stations. It is to be understood that at the expiration of the Concession, or of any extension or renewal thereof, the Company shall relinquish every pumping or other station that may be erected on these lands, and shall not be entitled to demand any refund of expenses in this connection. It is agreed that in places where the pipe-line is exposed, guards shall be appointed. Further, that the Sheikh will exert himself to the utmost to prevent the wilful setting fire to the oil in the pipe. In the event of such a contingency occurring he will endeavour to the utmost of his power to trace and punish the offenders and, if they possess anything, to recover compensation, but the Sheikh does not accept personally any pecuniary liability for loss which may accrue to the Company from this cause, and will not pay compensation. 4. The Sheikh further undertakes to hire to the Company an area or areas, aggregating ten jaribs at Ahwaz and Nasiri, having frontage on the eastern bank (edge) of the River Karun, for the storage of material, and building of storehouses, and such other buildings as are needed for the Company’s business, at a rate of one pound sterling per jarib per annum, i.e., that the yearly amount of the rent thereof wdll be ten pounds sterling. The Company have power to select a site or sites on the eastern edge of the Karun, located opposite the island in the river, upstream from the garden adjacent to the landing place used by steamers plying on the Upper Karun. Should the Company find the ground selected as above, after further examination, not suitable for their requirements, they shall have the right to select other sites of the same area and description : and whatever buildings there shall be on these areas shall be left by the Company on the expiry of the lease or of any extension or renewal thereof and they are not entitled to demand any refund of expenses in this connection. 5. In order that the Company may be satisfied that it has received from the Sheikh good and sufficient title to these lands, and that no one in future can put forward any claim in regard to the lands, the Sheikh undertakes for the com plete validity thereof to cause this document to be signed and sealed by the elders of his tribes. 6. The Sheikh further undertakes to appoint watchmen for the efficient guarding of the property of the Company in each district situate within3 his territories through which the pipes may be laid or in which the Com- panys property may be expased to possible loss : the salary of such watchmen he C P ompan y v with He wi ' furnish the represenUt.Ve of sentative of the Com^ names , ot hls own representatives ; so that on the repre- fncf Tl * h Com P a . n y on th e spot preferring a request, the Sheikh will struct his representatives to detail trustworthy men for the work. chan £ es in the P^sonnel of the representatives of the Sheikh will be intimated to the representative of the Company in due course.

In the case of theft unde^ other circum stances, cr of any wilful damage being done to the pipe-line or tanks thereof or utmost t^trare^, t0 , t - he Company, the Sheikh undertakes to do his utmost to trace the offenders, and in the event of their being identified, should nl ^h° Ve ° v, 6 ° n ^ *1? ^ 1S i unsd ^ tion &gt; or should thev be found therein, to inflict upon them such punishment as will be an example and deterrent to others against the perpetration of such acts; and also a means 0 f making the Company’s pro perty respected in his territory. ^ i s F ru 8. The Sheikh further grants the right to the Company to make all burnt and unburnt br icks and tiles required by them in the lands for the time being in the hands of the Company, and also to erect on the lands occupied by them in accordance with the articles of this Agreement, all buildings, structures and machinery as may be needed by them for the proper execution of their business. The Company undertakes that on the expiry of the Concession or of the period of the extension or renewal thereof, all these lands which have been acquired from the Sheikh on lease or free of charge, shall be abandoned and shall be given back into the hands of the Sheikh, and the said Company will nave no further rights in them. 9 - This lease of land, and all the conditions pertaining thereto, shall remain in torce for the full period of the Concession granted to Mr. W. K. D’Arcy by His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, dated 28th May 1901, and of any extension or renewal thereof. But on the expiration of the original period, in the event of there being an extension or renewal of the Concession, the rent shall be fixed at 1,500 (fifteen hundred) pounds sterling per annum, payable annually in advance, and the Sheikh shall have no right to demand any further increase. If in consideration of the exigencies of their business, the Company should wish to curtail the period ol their lease, in that case twelve calendar (Christian) months notice of their intention must be given in writing to the Sheikh prior to the termination of the lease. Such notice will be sent to the Sheikh through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah. If the lease should be thus cur tailed the Company shall make no claim for refund of money that has been paid in advance on acconnt of rent, and the Sheikh likewise shall make no claim for rent for the unexpired period of the lease. 10. If at any time the Company desire to acquire land on the Karun or Shatt-al-Arab at Mohammerah or Ahwaz, or any other point anywhere in the country under the Sheikh’s jurisdiction, for wharves or warehouses for the purposes of their business, the Sheikh undertakes as far as possible to assist the said Company in procuring the said land at favourable rates of lease. It is to be understood that such rent will be paid by the Company themselves. 11. In consideration of the lease of the lands mentioned in paragraph i, the Company undertake to pay rent at a rate of six hundred and fifty pounds sterling per annum ; such rent to be paid in advance every ten years, namely, the amount due to be paid to the Sheikh by drafts of the Company : such paymem \ to be made through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, in exchange for the receipt of the Sheikh. The first payment shall be made by the Company within three days of notice being received by the Directors of the completion of this Agreement. Notb.— -Insert at end of clause 7. “ That is to say—if it should be ascertained that the culprit or robber is not in the Sheikh's limits and does not belong to his jurisdiction the Sheikh shall not be held responsible’'.4 !2. The Company on their own part agree not to engage, without the cognizance of the Sheikh, tribesmen for their work, or in any way to interfere in tribal matters. 3. The Company as lessees of these lands agree that all treasure-trove throughout the lands leased to the Company and other lands given under this Agreement, belongs to the Sheikh alone. By “ treasure Trove” is meant coins, jewellery and objects of antiquity. 14. The Company bind themselves to take into their employ as guards and watchmen such persons as the Sheikh or his representatives in the various loca lities may state to be trustworthy ; and the Company agree that on receipt from the Sheikh of the expression of a wish for the dismissal of any such guard or watchman, they will act in accordance with his request, but only so long as sup port to the enforcement of their authority over the Company’s employes is received from the Sheikh, and so long as his assistance in the detection of thieves and punishment of them when detected—if subject to his jurisdiction—shall be real and effective. 15. The payments to unmounted guards and watchmen engaged from among the Sheikh’s men will be made by the Company on the following scale fifty krans per month of the Christian calendar without food, or any higher sum that the Company may think necessary; and this sum will be paid by them 15 days subsequent to the end of the month during which it was earned. If the said guards and watchmen do not agree to work for fifty krans per month or the further sum above indicated , then the Company shall have the right to bring guards and watchmen from some other place, but they shall not import them from localities at enmity with the Sheikh, and only so long as the pay of such men shall not be greater than the sum offered to the Sheikh’s men. 16. In the event of a watchman or any employe leaving without giving due notice of one month, it is the rule of the Company that 15 days pay be forfeited, and without exception all native employes are engaged on these terms. 17. The said Company reserve to themselves the right to punish their employes by inflicting fines to the extent of half a month’s pay as a maximum, and in the event of the behaviour of the said employes warranting a heavier punish ment, they will be handed over to the representative of the Sheikh at the nearest place: and the latter, under the Sheikh’s instructions, will use his utmost endeavours to uphold the authority of the Company over their employes and the respect of their property among the people of the district, so avoiding unneces sary trouble to both parties of this Agreement. 18. This Agreement and all the Articles therein are accepted by the Sheikh and admitted to be binding on himself and heirs and successors and on his tribesmen, whoever they may be. 19. This Agreement is considered to be in force from the date on which it is signed, from which date the Company become liable for the abovenamed rental. 20. Whenever differences arise between the Sheikh or his representative, and the Company or their representative, such cases shall be adjusted in a friendly and unofficial manner between the parties concerned. Should settlement not be achieved by this means the matter in question shall be referred to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, and the latter shall endeavour to settle the matter in dispute personally and informally with the Sheikh, and in the event of their not being able to arrive at a settlement they will refer the case in the same manner to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, whose settlement shall be considered final.

Cox, C.S 1 ., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Right Hon’ble Sir Edward Grey, Baronet, His Britannic Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London. In continuation of my despatch No. 8-Commercial, dated 18th instant, I have the honour to submit a duplicate copy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Agreement with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, together with a memorandum for your information containing notes in comment or elucidation of various points in the Agreement, which were the subject of special discussion in the course of our negotiations with the Sheikh. My proceedings in connection with the said negotiations were as follows :— 1 left for Mohammerah on the 7th instant, immediately on receipt of the Draft Agreement and instructions received with Foreign Office Despatch No. i Political ^21595-09) of 12th June. Mr. McDouall after so many years in Mohammerah not having yet been able to complete his preparations for departure and consequently not having handed over charge of the duties of His Majesty’s Consulate, and being more over anxious to avail himself of the present opportunity to bid farewell to Sheikh Khazal, accompanied me to Ahwaz, as also did Lieutenant Wilson and Mr.6 J. B. Lloyd, the Agent of the Oil Company. We arrived there by steam launch on Sunday i ith instant and the negotiations occupied the ensuing 5 days. This being the first important Agreement which the Sheikh had ever entered into with a European Company, it was not surprising that he should feel that he was breaking new ground in which innumerable pit-falls might be awaiting him. He was consequently extremely nervous and apprehensive, with the result that every petty detail of the Agreement had to be dissected and discussed and re discussed ad/.auseam. It was owing to this fact that it had to be entirely altered in form. By Thursday evening, after four sittings, everything regarding which Mr. Lloyd and he could be brought to an understanding on business lines had been adjusted, and there remained only the three cardinal points about which the joint arguments of Mr. Lloyd and myself as on behalf of the Company were unavailing. At this stage Mr. Lloyd retired from the discussion in order to mark the fact that as far as the Oil Company were concerned he had gone as far as he could, and to let the Sheikh see that he must either come to an understanding on such advice, on behalf of Government, as I might give him, or else adjourn the negotiations pending further correspondence with London. The three points of difference alluded to were— (i) The question of the concurrency of the present Agreement with the parent Concession, on which the Company insisted. (ii) The Sheikh’s demand for the substitution of the words “ sons and lineal descendants ” for the words “ heirs and successors ” both in the Preamble and in Article 18. (iii) The question of the reversion of the existing buildings to the Sheikh on the expiry of the Concession. They are most convenient to handle in the above order. As regards’( 0 * The Sheikh pressed perseveringly for the retention of the stipulation inserted by him in his preliminary agreement to the effect that at the expiry of the original period of the Company’s Concession the possession of the land and buildings should lapse to himself or his heirs, and should in the event of a renewal or extension be leased by the Company from him. That stipulation, it will be remembered, was rejected altogether by the Company and the joint negotiations of Mr. Lloyd and myself had reached a stage at which the Sheikh had consented primd facte to drop the question of lease and to let the agreement be concurrent in consideration of a substantial advance in the figure of the rental for the second or any subsequent period. In negotiating this latter point Mr. Lloyd had risen in conversation from ^1,000 to ^1,300 and informed the Sheikh that he could not go beyond that. On retiring from the deliberations, however, he gave me authority, should I see fit to use it in order to ensure completion of the Agreement without recourse to further reference home, to raise the figure to ^1,500. This I had to do by gradual stages, and the point was eventually settled at that figure. As regards (ii). I beg to refer to the penultimate paragraph of my letter of 16th May to the Sheikh, enclosed with my Despatch No. 55—1391, of 12th June to His Majesty’s Minister, which will doubtless have reached the Foreign Office before this communication. It will be seen that the Sheikh then pressed for the substitution of these words, or their equivalent, in our assurances to him; and he evidently saw his opportunity in the negotiating of this Agreement between himself and the Gil Company under our auspices, to get us indirectly committed to a dynastic guarantee. I had discussed the point repeatedly with him in the presence of Mr. Lloyd, endeavouring to make the Sheikh understand that the point was purely a political one already under correspondence and that he had no reasonable excuse for attempting to introduce a controversial political question of this nature into a purely commercial agreement with the Oil Company who were simply concerned to be assured that their Agreement would hold good both for his time and that of his successors. Who those successors might be was no concern of the Oil Company, and they could not be expected to makeany pronouncement upon the question in their agreement; much less could they commit Government to father it. y I reminded the Sheikh that I had undertaken to discuss this and other Representations of h,s wtth the Minister, and that I would do so, but that it was useless and unreasonable for him to expect to dispose of the question in the way he now sought to do. . i r As re £ ards 0 '). Sheikh Khazal from the first assumed the attitude which I feared he would, and insisted on the insertion of a clear undertaking that the buildings should revert to the Sheikh or his lineal heirs ” or words to that effect. He was extremely heated on this point, and argued it excitedly for a very long time. It proved useless telling him that the buildings would be evacuated and left, and that he knew whether the Persian Government would be in a position to take them or not; or, that the present Agreement would probably be seen at some time by the Persian Government and that, apart from the fact that the Company were quite unable to insert the clause he wanted, even if they were able it would be extremely shortsighted on his part to insert in the Agree ment a clause like that suggested, to which the Persian Government would at once take exception. 1 he Sheikh would not be persuaded and said that sooner than leave the matter in doubt he would much prefer to insert the clause and let the Persian Government see it now and do their worst. I did not, however take him at his word, and said that if he could not alter that view we would reserve the point for a private discussion. He dropped the demand in his final interview with me on my undertakiug to give him the separate assurance, in terms of which I attach a copy, backed by the threat to which I shall presently allude. He would not be put off with any ambiguous language, and his ultimate argument was that unless he could be reasonably assured he would not consent to the Company erecting any build ings at all but would erect them himself. This latter arrangement would not be satisfactory for the Company, and Mr. Lloyd had informed me that he could not accept it in any case on his own authority. But it would appear that the existance of this obvious alternative, whether employed or not, would afford a sufficient answer to any claim on the part of the Persian Government to the buildings. Moreover, should any question arise within the near future resulting from the inception of a Constitutional Government at Tehran, it would be a simple matter to revise the Agreement accordingly. To have done so now would have held up the conclusion of the Aorpp. ment indefinitely. The ultimate lever which seemed to turn the scale in all these matters was the observation, or threat, that it was clear to me from the terms of their instructions that His Majesty’s Government were anxious to help the Company in this matter and intended that the Agreement should be put through without fail at the present meeting and that they would be extremely displeased if I had to report that the Sheikh had proved unreasonable. I added on mv own account that if after the concessions already made by the Company he did not complete the Agreement the Company would think it hopeless to get fair terms from him, and would take their chance with the Persian Government direct simply informing the latter that they needed a tract of uncultivated land on Abadan under the terms of their concession, and requesting that the Central Government would either assign it to them or instruct their Governor at Moham- merah to do so. I imbibed this useful hint in the course of conversation with Haji Rais who, I may mention, was most helpful throughout and well deserved the honorarium which I understand the Company decided to give him on the conclusion of the Agreement.

After Compliments— I have the honour to state, with reference to Article 8 of the Agreement which has this day, 16th July 1909, been entered into between Your Excellency and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, that I am authorised to assure you that when the Concession expires, should the Persian Government claim the buildings erected by the Company on the lands held by the said company from yourself, the British Government will afford you assistance towards the realization of an adjustment which may leave the said buildings in your own possession. (Usual complimentary ending). Notes on the details of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Agreement with the Sheikh of Mohammerah^ dated 16th July iqoq. \ Preamble, (i) On behalf of himself, heirs and successors'' etc .—This passage contains one of the three fundamental points on which the Sheikh held out to the last minute. He insisted on the Oil Company substituting for “ heirs and successors ” the words “ sons and lineal descendants.*’ The manner of disposal of it is explained in the covering letter to this memorandum. (it) It was considered important to insert at the outset the reference to the principal Concession from the Persian Government and its exclusive character, as evidence of the Sheikh’s cognizance and recognition of it. Article /.—A right of way 30 yards wide, independent of the ground taken up for the pipeline, is a very liberal allowance. Article 2. — (i) “ Free of date trees.” The Sheikh feared that “ uncultivat ed ” might not be sufficient to protect ground bearing date trees, and therefore wished for this change. (ii) In the Sheikh’s skeleton agreement with me, he only gave the Company option to purchase at the same rate up to one year ; the Company in their draft altered the period to three years, and the Sheikh after discussion agreed to split the difference. Article 3 .—(/) The question of the reversion of the buildings arises in this Article. It was, as I anticipated, the chief difficulty and was got over eventually in the way explained in my covering letter. (ii) In connection with this Article the Sheikh was possessed with, the fear that tribal enemies might, in order to do him injury, bore a hole in the pipe at any point where it was exposed, and by applying a match create an enormous con flagration, and that the Company would come down on him for the damage. I gather that it would be practically impossible to cause a serious fire in this way. Moreover, the Company’s buildings, oil, etc., will presumably be covered by insurance. The Sheikh was greatly exercised as to his possible liability. Article 4. —(i) In the wording of this Article the word “ lab ” in the Persian meaning “ lip ” or “ edge ” has been designedly used in preference to “ side ” or “ bank ” which the Sheikh used. This course was taken in order to preclude the possibility of the Sheikh saying afterwards that the terms of this Article would be fulfilled by his giving land some distance back from the river without frontage actually on it. This has occurred in a previous case. (ii) The Sheikh expressed his objection to giving any land at all on the right bank. He argued that the right bank was not so secure in the first place, and that in the second place no land had ever been given on that bank, and if he gave any now much undesirable gossip would result ; and that as he could not understand9 ?, nd M f; L J°y &lt; J c u ou!d not explain the object of the Company in wanting land on t e right bank he must decide not to give it. Mr. Lloyd saw no nee/to press reasons'were'for'the request^ 2 ^ t0 S£e P recisel y what th « Company's thanSo H^f h Rli7sToS r offices nd ^ accommodating and liberal, again'in\his Article!' 016 *^ that tHe question the revers i° n of buildings occurs c , endorsement of the deed by the Tribal Sheikhs of the Sheikh s tribe was provided for as likely to be a valuable cachet to the Agreement. Article 7--The question of territorial responsibility. cu The Bakhtyaris, who accepted responsibility with alacrity compared to Sheikh Khazal, have never fulfilled their obligations satisfactorily. Sheikh Khazal is very apprehensive for himself in this connection and naturally anxious to protect himself as far as possible ; but though less ready to commit himself on paper there is good reason to hope that in practice he will act up to his obligations more fully than they have. He admits that even should he become personally exempt from responsibility under the wording of this Article, by reason of the company electing to supply their own guards, he will still, as Governor of the district on behalf of the Central Government, be administratively responsible for the maintenance of order in the ordinary way. Article 8 % This is the Article in which the question of reversion is chiefly raised* As before mentioned it is dealt with in the body of my covering letter Article g .—This Article was one of the three chief difficulties of the nego- ciations. The sheikh refused to concede to the Company's desire that the Agreement with him should in every respect run parallel, in point of renewal or extension, with the parent Concession with the Persian Government. It was one of the three questions which we were unable to get him to settle with the Company as a matter of business, but which was eventually got over otherwise. Article 10 .—This Article differs somewhat from the Company’s draft. It was thought best to specify only what “ treasure-trove ” did cover, and not to put ideas into the Sheikh’s head by stating what it did not cover, He himself raised the question of the possible finding of oil in his limits. The rights of the Company in this eventuality were explained to him, but he was given to under stand verbally by the Company’s Agent that in the event of separate springs of oil being tapped within his limits, the Company would be inclined to come to some friendly arrangement with him. Article 1 $.—It is not apparent to me why the Company expected to get men from the Sheikh of Mohammerah for five tomams per month when they were paying six or more in the Bakhtyari country. The Sheikh gave a good deal of trouble over this section, but it was eventually arranged as stated. Article /c?.—The same question regarding substitution of 11 sons and lineal descendants ” arose here as in the case of the preamble. Article .20.—The subject of this Article was one regarding which the Sheikh was not unnaturally a little apprehensive. He has of course heard from time (? to time) of the friction which there has been between Messrs. Lynch and the Bakhtyaris, and trusts that his relations with the Oil Company are not going to be conducted on similar lines, with frequent recourse to Consular intervention or arbitration. It will be greatly in the interests of the Company, and I am sure their desire is also to deal as far as possible directly with the Sheikh in a friendly and give and take way in regard to the settlement of the innumerable petty questions which must inevitably arise, they refraining as far as practicable from recourse to Consular assistance or official correspondence. Similarly, when reference to Consular authorities does become necessary it will be to the interests of all to let communications be informal up to a certain point. The Sheikh is likely to be much more amenable to this method of negotiation, itp+*. 10 being of course understood on both sides that the ultimate discretion to become official when driven to it, lies with other party. Article 21 .—We had originally prepared a 21st Article containing a proviso that in the event of any dispute as to interpretation, the English version should prevail, but the Sheikh refused to agree to this as he knows no English and keeps no English-knowing Secretary. He also wanted the Articles kept down to 20 for luck. No. 21 was consequently dropped, but the Agreement was drawn up • Not printed.

Notes on the details of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Agreement with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, dated July 16, 1909. PREAMBLE. ‘ On behalf of himself, heirs, and successors,” &amp;c. This passage contains one of the three fundamental points on which the sheikh held out to the last minute. He insisted on the oil company substituting for “ heirs and successors” the words “sons and lineal descendants.” The manner of disposal of it is explained in the covering letter to this memorandum. (ii.) It was considered important to insert at the outset the reference to the principal concession from the Persian Government and its exclusive character, as evidence of the sheikh’s cognizance and recognition of it. Article 1 —A right of way 30 yards wide, independent of the ground taken up for the pipeline, is a very liberal allowance. Art. 2.—“ Free of date trees.” The sheikh feared that “ uncultivated ” might not be sufficient to protect ground bearing date trees, and therefore wished for this change. (ii.) In the sheikh’s skeleton agreement with me, he only gave the company option to purchase at the same rate up to one year ; the company in their draft altered the period to three years, and the sheikh after discussion agreed to split the difference. Art. 3.—(i.) The question of the reversion of the buildings arises in this article. It was as I anticipated the chief difficulty, and was got over eventually in the way explained in my covering letter. (ii.) In connection with this article the sheikh was possessed with the fear that tribal enemies might, in order to do him injury, bore a hole in the pipe at any point where it was exposed, and by applying a match create an enormous conflagration, and that the company would come down on him for the damage. I gather that it would be practically impossible to cause a serious fire in this way. Moreover, the company’s buildings, oil, &amp;c., will presumably be covered by insurance. The sheikh was greatly exercised as to his possible liability. Art. 4 .—(i.) In the wording of this article the word “ lab ” in the Persian meaning “lip” or “edge” has been designedly used in preference to “side” or “bank” [2377 ? - 6 ] B 24 which the sheikh used. This course was taken in order to preclude the possibility of the sheikh saying afterwards that the terms of this article would be fulfilled by his giving land some distance back from the river without frontage actually on it. This has occurred in a previous case. (ii.) r lhe sheikh expressed his objection to giving any land at all on the rig. bank. He argued that the right bank was not so secure in the first place, and that m the second place no land had ever been given on that bank, and if he gave any now much undesirable gossip would result; and that as he could not understand, and Mr. Lloyd could not explain, the object of the company in wanting land on the right bank he must decide not to give it. Mr. Lloyd saw no need to press the point, none of us present being able to see precisely what the company’s reasons were for the request. The sheikh’s terms for this land are exceedingly accommodating and liberal thanks to Haji Rais’s good offices. (iii.) It will be noted that the question of the reversion of buildings occurs again m this article. Art. 5. The endorsement of the deed by the tribal sheikhs of the sheikh’s tribe was provided for as likely to be a valuable cachet to the agreement. Art. 7.—The question of territorial responsibility. The Bakhtyaris who accepted responsibility with alacrity compared to Sheikh Ivhazal have never fulfilled their obligations satisfactorily. Sheikh Khazal have never fulfilled ^ their obligations satisfactorily. Sheikh Khazal is very apprehensive for himself in this connection and naturally anxious to protect himself as far as possible; but though less ready to commit himself on paper there is good reason to hope that in practice he v r ill act up to his obligations more fully than they have. He admits that even should he become personally exempt from responsibility under the warding of tins article, by reason of the company electing to supply their own guards, he will still, as go\ ernor of the district on behalf of the Central Government, be administratively lesponsible for the maintenance of order in the ordinary way. .^his is the article in which the question of reversion is chiefly raised. As before mentioned, it is dealt with in the body of my covering letter. .,4 r ^ ^ art i c ^ e was one of the three chief difficulties of the negotiations. The sheikh refused to concede to the company’s desire that the agreement with him should m every respect run parallel, in point of renewal or extention, wdth the parent concession with the Persian Government. It v r as one of the three questions which we were unable to get him to settle with the company as a matter of business, but which was eventually got over otherwise. Art. 10.^ This article differs somewhat from the company’s draft. It was thought best to specify only what “treasure-trove” did cover, and not to put ideas into the sheikh s head by stating wffiat it did not cover. He himself raised the question of the possible finding of oil in his limits. The rights of the company in this eventuality were explained to him, but he was given to understand verbally by the company’s agent, that in the event of separate springs of oil being tapped within his limits, the company w r oiild be inclined to come to some friendly arrangement with him. ^ not a PP aren t to me wffiy the company expected to get men from the oheikh of Mohammerah for 5 tomans per month, w T hen they were paying 6 and more in the Bakhtyan country. Ihe sheikh gave a good deal of trouble over this section, but it was eventually arranged as stated. Art. 18 ;&gt; The same question regarding substitution of “ sons and lineal descendants arose here as in the case of the preamble. Art. 20. The subject of this article was one regarding wdiich the sheikh was not unnaturally a little apprehensive. He has of course heard from time to time of the inction which there has been between Messrs. Lynch and the Bakhtyaris, and trusts t at his relations with the oil company are not going to be conducted on similar lines, with^ frequent recourse to consular intervention or arbitration. It will be greatly in the interests of the company, and I am sure their desire is also to deal as far as possible directly with the sheikh in a friendly give and take way, in regard to the settlement of the innumerable petty questions which must inevitably arise, they retraining as far as practicable from recourse to consular assistance or official corre- spondence. Similarly, when reference to consular authorities does become necessary, it wui be to the interests of all to let communications be informal up to a certain point. he sheikh is likely to be much more amenable to this method of negotiation—it being ol course understood on both sides that the ultimate discretion to become official when driven to it, lies with either party.) 5 Art. 21. We had originally prepared a 21st article containing a proviso that, in the event of any dispute as to interpretation, the English version should prevail, but the sheikh refused to agiee to this as he knows no English and keeps no English ^l^iowing secretary. He also wanted the articles kept down to 20 for hick. No. 21 as consequently dropped, but the agreement was drawn up in English and Persian on the same paper, and the sheikh signed under the Persian and the oil company’s agent under the English.

IN continuation of my telegram from Fao dated the 17th instant, I have the honour to submit a copy of the agreement concluded on the 10th July, 1909, between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Urgencies which I find awaiting disposal on my return to head-quarters to-day prevent my submitting with it, as I had intended, a memorandum of comment which I have recorded in rough, together with a copy of my letter of assurance to the sheikh in connection with the question of reversion. I shall do so by next post, and request that you will be pleased to await my further communication before the terms of the agreement are critically examined. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Ears, fyc. Inclosure in No. 1. Agreement entered into between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, dated Ahwaz, the 16th July, 1909. AGREEMENT entered into between the Sardar Arfa, Amir Nuyan, Sheikh Khazal Khan ibn Haji Jabir Khan, Sheikh of Mohammerah, on behalf of ^himself, heirs and successors, and his tribesmen, on the one part, hereinafter called the sheiklq and Messrs. Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), of London, on the other pait, hereinafter called “ the company,” in respect of lands required by the said company m the terri tories of the former, for the purposes of their business, under the exclusive privileges of the concession granted to Mr. W. K. D’Arcy by His Majesty the Shah of Persia on the 28th May, 1901. Whereby it is agreed that:— 1 . The sheikh undertakes to hire to the said company an area free of date trees of 650 jaribs, of 4,669 square yards per jarib, on Abbadan Island, situated between the village of Baraim on the north-west and Buwardeh on the south-east having a frontage of about 2,000 yards on the Shatt-al-Arab ; and also a strip of land, not less than 30 yards in breadth, for a right of way connecting the land above-mentioned with the Bahmanshir River, but the public rights of w r ay must remain. 2. Should the said company find the ground selected as above, alter further examination, not suitable for their requirements, they should have the right to select other sites of the same area and same description. Should the company require more land, free of date trees, adjacent to the lands leased to them, the sheikh undertakes, in case the company asks for such land within a space of two years from the date of this agreement, to grant em an Imd 100 jaribs in area at the same moderate rate. If thesai companj after two years from the date of this agreement, they shall pay rental at current rate of the time for similar land in those localities. t • 3. The sheikh further undertakes to grant, free of charge to the P of land for the laying of such pipe-lines as may be necessary, f &gt;ov ®. “ • ’ situated in his lands or in those lands for the time being un ® r 1 errant free in leased or purchased by him from others, with access there o, an ne JLd bv them connection with the said pipe-line, such uncultivated land as may be needed by them [2377 i—10]2 for telegraph or telephone stations or pumping stations, or quarters for line inspectors and staff, having an area of 3 jaribs for each pumping station and 1|- jaribs for each of the other stations. It is to be understood that at the expiration of the concession, or of any extension or renewal thereof, the company shall relinquish every pumping or other station tl^ may be erected on these lands, and shall not be entitled to demand any refund expenses in this connection. It is agreed that in places where the pipe-line is exposed guards shall be appointed. Further, that the sheikh will exert himself to the utmost to prevent the wilful setting fire to the oil in the pipe. In the event of such a contingency occurring, he will endeavour, to the utmost of his power to trace and punish the offenders and, if they possess anything, to recover compensation, but the sheikh does not accept personally any pecuniary liability for loss which may accrue to the company from this cause, and will not pay compensation. 4. The sheikh further undertakes to hire to the company an area or areas, aggregating 10 jaribs, at Ahwaz and Nasiri, having frontage on the eastern bank (edge) of the River Karun, for the storage of material and building of storehouses and such other buildings as are needed for the company’s business, at a rate of 11. per jarib per annum ; i.e., that the yearly amount of the rent thereof will be 101. The company have power to select a site or sites on the eastern edge of the Karun, located opposite the island in the river, upstream from the garden adjacent to the landing place used by steamers plying on the Upper Karun. Should the company find the ground selected as above, after further examination, not suitable for their require ments, they shall have the right to select other sites of the same area and description, and whatever buildings there shall be on these areas shall be left by the company on the expiry of the lease or of any extension or renewal thereof, and they are not entitled to demand any refund of expenses in this connection. 5. In order that the company may be satisfied that it has received from the sheikh good and sufficient title to these lands, and that no one in future can put forward any claim in regard to the lands, the sheikh undertakes, for the complete validity thereof, to cause this document to be signed and sealed by the elders of his tribes. 0. The sheikh further undertakes to appoint watchmen for the efficient guarding of the property of the company in each district situate within his territories through which the pipes may be laid, or in which the company’s property may be exposed to possible loss, the salary of such watchmen to be paid by the company themselves. He will furnish the representative of the company with the names of his own repre sentatives, so that on the representative of the company on the spot preferring a request the sheikh will instruct his representatives to detail trustworthy men for the work. Any changes in the personnel of the representatives of the sheikh will be intimated to the representative of the company in due course. 7 . So long as the sheikh guarantees the guards employed by the company, he undertakes to recover any property stolen by the said guards themselves, or by reason of their connivance, and in the event of non-recovery to compensate the company for the loss sustained. In the case of theft under other circumstances, or of any wilful damage being done to the pipe-line or tanks thereof, or any other property belonging to the company, the sheikh undertakes to do his utmost to trace the offenders, and, in the event of their being identified, should they prove to belong to his jurisdiction, or should they be found therein, to inflict upon them such punishment as will be an example and deterrent to others against the perpetration of such acts, and also a means of making the company’s property respected in his territory- That is to say—if it should be ascertained that the culprit or robber is not in the Shah’s limits, and does not belong to his jurisdiction, the sheikh should not be held responsible. 8 . The sheikh further grants the right to the company to make all burnt and unburnt bricks and tiles required by them in the lands for the time being in the hands of the company, and also to erect on the lands occupied by them in accordance with the articles of this agreement, all buildings, structures, and machinery as may be needed by them for the proper execution of their business. The company undertakes that, on the expiry of the concession or of the period of the extension or renewal thereof, all these lands which have been acquired from the sheikh on lease or free of charge shall be abandoned, and shall be given back into the hands of the sheikh, and the said company will have no further rights in them. 9. This lease of land and all the conditions pertaining thereto shall remain in force for the full period of the concession granted to Mr. W. K. D’Arcy by His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia dated the 28th May, 1901, and of any extension or renewal thereof. But on the expiration of the original period, in the event of there being anextension or renewal of the concession, the rent shall be fixed at 1,500L per annum, payable annually in advance, and the sheikh shall have no right to demand any further increase. If, in consideration of the exigencies of their business, the company should ■wish to curtail the period of the lease, in that case 12 calendar (Christian) months’ v notice of their intention must be given in writing to the sheikh prior to the termination of the lease—such notice will be sent to the sheikh through His Britannic Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah. If the lease should be thus curtailed, the company shall make no claim for refund of money that has been paid in advance on account of rent, and the sheikh likewise shall make no claim for rent for the unexpired period of the lease. 10. If at any time the company desire to acquire land on the Karun or Shatt-el- Arab at Mohammerah or Ahwaz, or any other point anywhere in the country under the sheikh’s jurisdiction, for wharves or warehouses for the purposes of their business, the sheikh undertakes as far as possible to assist the said company in procuring the said land at favourable rates of lease. It is to be understood that such rent will be paid by the company themselves. 11. In consideration of the lease of the lands mentioned in paragraph 1 , the company undertake to pay rent at a rate of 650/. per annum, such rent to be paid in advance every ten years, namely, the amount due to be paid to the sheikh by drafts of the company, such payment to be made through His Britannic Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah in exchange for the receipt of the sheikh. The first payment shall be made by the company within three days of notice being received by the directors of the completion of this agreement. 12. The company on their own part agree not to engage without the cognizance of the sheikh, tribesmen for their work, or in any way to interfere in tribal matters. 13. The company, as lessees of these lands, agree that all treasure-trove throughout the lands leased to the company, and other lands given under this agreement, belong to the sheikh alone. By “ treasure-trove ” is meant coins, jewellery, and objects of antiquity. 14. The company bind themselves to take into their employ as guards and watchmen only such persons as the sheikh or his representatives in the various localities may state to be trustworthy, and the company agree that on receipt from the sheikh of the expression of a wish for the dismissal of any such guard or watchman, they will act in accordance with his request, but only so long as support to the enforcement of their authority over the company’s employes is received from the sheikh, and so long as his assistance in the detection of thieves and punishment of them when detected, if subject to his jurisdiction, shall be real and effective. 15. The payments to unmounted guards and watchmen engaged from among the sheikh’s men will be made by the company on the following scale : 50 krans per month of the Christian calendar without food, or any higher sum that the company may think necessary, and this sum will be paid by them 15 days subsequent to the end of the month during which it was earned. If the said guards and watchmen do not agree to work for 50 krans per month or the further sum above indicated, then the company shall have the right to bring guards and watchmen from some other place, but they shall not import them from localities at enmity with the sheikh, and only so long as the pay of such men shall not be greater than the sum offered to tlm sheikh’s men. 16. In the event of a watchman or any employe leaving without giving due notice of one month, it is the rule of the company that 15 days’ pay be forfeited, and without exception all native employes are engaged on these terms. 17. The said company reserve to themselves the right to punish their employes by inflicting fines to the extent of half month’s pay as a maximum, and in the event of the behaviour of the said employes warranting a heavier punishment, they will be handed over to the representative of the sheikh at the nearest place, and the latter, under the sheikh’s instructions, will use his utmost endeavours to uphold the authority of the company over their employes and the respect of their property among the people of the district, so avoiding unnecessary trouble to both parties of this agreement. 18. This agreement and all the articles therein are accepted by the sheikh, and admitted to be binding on himself, and heirs, and successors, and on his tribesmen, whoever they may be. 19. This agreement is considered to be in force from the date on which it is signed, from which date the company become liable for the above-named rental. 20. Whenever differences arise between the sheikh or his representatives and the company or their representatives, such cases shall be adjusted in a friendly^ and unofficial manner between the parties concerned. Should settlement not be achieved by this means, the matter in question shall be referred to His Britannic Majesty s consul at Mohammerah, and the latter shall endeavour to settle the matter in disputepersonally and informally with, the sheikh, and in the event of their not being able to arrive at a settlement they will refer the case in the same manner to the resident in the Persian Gulf, whose settlement shall be considered final. Ibis agreement of lease has been written, signed, and sealed at Ahwaz this 16th July, 1909, corresponding to 27th Jamad-us-Sani, 1327, in duplicate. It is correct. Khaza’l bin Jabir.

WITH reference to your letter of the 1 st instant, relative to the proposed agree ment between your company and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, l am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that he has received a telegram from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire reporting that, after negotiations which have lasted several days, a settlement has been reached on terms which Major Cox agrees with your agent in considering reasonably satisfactory. All essential conditions have been maintained, though certain alterations have been made in-the less important details. As regards the reversion of the buildings, &amp;c., constructed on the land leased, Major Cox states that he was obliged to give to the sheikh the separate confidential assurance suggested by His Majesty’s Minister at lehran, that if, when the time comes, the Persian Government claim these buildings, His Majesty’s Government will assist the sheikh to reach a reasonable settlement. The sheikh has undertaken to get the agreement endorsed by the tribal elders within the next few days, and it is hoped that by that time the sum of 16,050?. will be ready at Mohammerah. The sheikh accepts the conditions which His Majesty’s Government have attached to the loan, and has asked that the amount may be paid in gold instead of by draft on a bank. The sheikh has expressed the fear that by executing this agreement with a foreign company he may incur the hostility of the ulema and Nationalist leaders. He therefore begs that overt operations at Mohammerah may be delayed, and secrecy maintained as to the execution and details of the agreement until the present crisis at Tehran is at an » I am to suggest to you the advisability of complying with the request of the sheikh on this point.

Jwne 18, 1909. 1 HA E the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 15th instant calling my attention to clause 6 of an agreement made on the 15th November 1905' between Mr. Preece on beha f of the then holders of the Persian concession on the one hand and the Bakhtian chiefs on the other. T [ u * '' as the flrst tlm ® t hat my attention was called to the clause in question, and it has taken me a couple of days to investigate the matter. r 1 fiuci f rom ^fr. Preece that when he negotiated this agreement with the chiefs and discussed the question of their allowing Europeans and others under them to go to live and work m the Bakhtian country, when the chiefs claimed that on the departure of these people their buildings should revert to the Bakhtiaris he had in his mind that such buildings would be all or mainly cateha, and that consequently the clause would be unobjectionable m any case, that it involved comparatively speaking onlv a small sum or money. It is true that in all human probability it can only involve a small sum of money as it does not cover plant, pipes, machinery, or anything of a kindred nature, but ali the same I think that putting it into the agreement was a mistake. However that may be, it is a mistake to suppose that the Persian Government has taken no exception to this agreement. I have to-day obtained a copy (attached hereto) of a letter dated the 16th August, 1906, from the British legation in Tehran to Sir Edward Grey, which shows that the Persians took exception to it in the strongest possible manner. In any case, I am sure that you will feel that my company cannot now safely commit a similar mistake, and, besides, the Sheikh’s demand, as set forth in Major Cox’s telegram No. 486 of the 18th May, 1909, is of a far more wide-reaching nature, viz. “ That all the company’s plant of machinery, workshop, and other erections upon the lands leased to them shall lapse to the Sheikh.” As on these lands it is proposed to erect an oil refinery and all necessary buildings, with plant, machinery, and pipe lines, the value involved will certainly not be under a quarter of a million sterling, and may easily run to a million or more if the company has before it the successful career that we all anticipate. In conclusion I ask leave to say that my company has no objection as such to allowing a reversion to the Sheikh on the expiry of the concession or of any renewal or extension thereof, but that it is precluded by one of the terms of the concession from specifically promising such reversion to the Sheikh as against the Persian Government, and I sincerely hope that Major Cox, when this is clearly put before him (as it will be by our Persian agents, Messrs. Lloyd, Scott, and Co. on arrival of to-day’s outward mail, if it has not already been put), will succeed in persuading the Sheikh to either waive his demand or else to be satisfied with the undertaking given in my letter of the 27th ultimo, paragraph 17.

In reply to the reference made in your note to Article 3 of the concession, I have the honour to state that the article in question only refers to the lease or purchase of lands about which the concessionnaires can come to terms with the owners, but the latter cannot, without the knowledge or approval of the Persian Government, make with any person an agreement the stipulations of which affect the rights of the Government. The Persian Government cannot accept the agreement which the oil syndicate propose to make with the chiefs, and when the draft w r as sent to the Foreign Office a reply was sent in writing, saying that the Persian Government could not accept and certify the agreement in question, and also, in my note respecting the complaints made by the Shoja-es-Sultan,-I referred to the matter and await an answer for communication to him.PERSIA.

I am to invite your special attention to the fact that the company must insist on their lease from the Sheikh being coextensive with their concession from the Persian Government or any extension thereof, and also that as regards the question of the lapse of the company s buildings, machinery, &amp;c., at the expiration of their concession from the Persian Government, or of any extension thereof, the company are unable, in view' of their engagement to the Persian Government, to agree to the proposed reversion to the Sheikh, but they are quite willing, if it is thought advisable to dispense with a definite pronouncement, that such buildings, &amp;c., shall lapse to the Persian Government, and it does^ not seem necessary to raise this question with the Sheikh, who should be contented with a statement that the company undertake that the buildings, machinery, &amp;c., will not be removed at the expiration of the concession, or of any extension thereof. * To Anglo-Persian Oil Company, May 24; Anglo-Persian Oil Company, May 27; ditto, June 9, 1909.

Written Declaration recorded by Sheikh Khazal Khan, Sheikh of Mohammerah, on May 15, 1909, regarding the Purchase of Land, fyc., by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. (Translation.) WHEREAS a friendly discussion has taken place between me (Sheikh Khazal) and Major Cox and Mr. McDouall, regarding the desire of the Anglo-Persian Company to lease certain lands in the territorial limits of myself and my tribe, for the establishment of an oil refinery and structures connected therewith, and for the laying of a pipe line from the head of the oil wells, and for the works in con nection therewith, and whereas it appears that their precise requirements are as follows:— 1 . A strip of land for bringing the said pipe line from the head of the above oil pipes to the refinery is needed. 2 . A plot of uncultivated land on the Island of Abbadan, with a frontage of 2,000 yards on the Shatt-el-Arab between villages of Braim and Bawairda is required, the area of which shall not exceed 650 jareebs. 3. Right of way between this plot of land and the Bahmanshir {i.e., Turra) River. 4. Right to acquire further uncultivated land contiguous to the said plot, in case of necessity, at the same fair rate as that (ground) above mentioned from the present date up to a period of one year. If they want it after that lapse of time it will be leased at the fair current rate of the time. 5 . If the above plot of ground be eventually not approved for the above-men tioned works the Oil Company have the right to acquire instead another site of the same size on another part of the Island of Abbadan upon the same terms. 6 . If the Oil Company require any other land on the banks of the Karun, &amp;c., for wharfage and storage and for other purposes, of course to the best of my power I am ready to meet their requirements at the fair current rate of the time. [2306 o— 6 ]Therefore, I, Sheikh Khazal Khan, on my own part and on behalf of my descendants and my tribes, agree that I will lease to the Oil Company*the above land which th~” may need for the pipe line and refinery establishment and connected works, with g title, inasmuch as concerns my rights over it, for such time as the company, during the duration of their concession, may require. This lease is subject to one of the following terms, of which the company are at liberty to choose whichever they may prefer. That is to say :— 1 . For an annual rental of 650/., to be paid in advance every ten years. 2 . For an annual rental of 1 , 000 /., to be paid to me annually in advance ; it being stipulated that— (a.) After the expiry of the period of their concession which will be defined [i.e., in the subsequent agreement which would be drawn up between the company and the Sheikh.—P.Z.C.], all the buildings, workshops, &amp;c., for themselves and for the oil refinery, &amp;c., and all the buildings which they may construct in those limits, with the necessary gear for the refinery of oil which they may possess there, all become my property, and the company will not have the right to remove them or to demand their value. ( 6 .) The company’s officials have no right to interfere in the affairs of my tribes. For instance, if they require to engage (tribesmen as) servants, &amp;c., it must be with my cognisance. 3. If at any time in the process of excavating land for the buildings and workshops and laying the pipe line, any treasure should come to light in those lands, it is my concession from the Government, then they must lease these buildings, workshops, and this property, with the land, in a way satisfactory to me or to my descendants.

I HAVE the honour to report that I learn from His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz that a ditficulty has arisen between him and the syndicate’s manager, which originated in the failure of Mr. Bradshaw, the acting manager, to keep in sufficiently close touch with Captain Lorimer regarding the syndicate’s affairs. The syndicate’s instalments due to the Bakhtiari Khans are paid to the Ispahan branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the present misunderstanding has arisen from a sum having, by Captain Lorimer’s instructions, been deducted from the November instalment to cover certain compensation claims of the syndicate. Mr. Reynolds complains of this action, although he admits that it was taken in the best interests of the syndicate, and has instructed the bank that no consul has any control over the funds deposited in the bank by the syndicate’s manager; and that unless specially asked to do so by the manager, as was the case on one occasion, the bank must not carry out any instructions from the consul in regard to them. I need not trouble you with the correspondence which has passed between Captain Lorimer and Mr. Reynolds on the subject. It will be sufficient to say that Captain Lorimer, while maintaining—quite rightly as I think—that his action was justified on the occasion which gave rise to the dispute with Mr. Reynolds, admits that the latter is right in principle, while pointing out with justice, in my opinion, that a rigid adherence to this principle will lead to difficuties in the future, has written to the bank endorsing Mr. Reynolds’s view. Until the occurrence of this misunderstanding things between His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz and the syndicate’s manager had worked smoothly, and Captain Lorimer’s services in the interests of the syndicate are admitted by Mr. Reynolds, and have been acknowledged by the management in London. From Captain Lorimer’s report it would appear that he had hoped that such a question as that which has produced the present misunderstanding would not be formalised. Circumstances have, however, made it desirable to give the manager a ruling in order to prevent similar misunderstandings in the future. This is all the more desirable, inasmuch as Mr. Reynolds is about to proceed to Europe, leaving the management in less experienced hands. In these circumstances, I would suggest that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should be approached, and that it should be intimated to them that it would facilitate matters if instructions on the following lines were sent to their Arabistan manager :— 1 . That before issuing orders to the Imperial Bank of Persia for the payment of any quarterly instalment the company s manager should coufei with His Majesty s consular representative, and should endeavour to meet the lattei s wishes, should he raise any objection, or have any suggestion to offei on political giounds, of which he is the competent judge, as regards the manner in which it is proposed to deed with the instalment. . ... 2 That the company’s manager, before presenting compensation claims to the Khans, should assure himself that they are such as the consul can properly support, in the event of their being disputed. . , , . , , . 3. That the company’s manager (and the European staff) might be reminded m general terms that political relations with the Khans require ^ ei y delicate andlmg, that the successful conduct of the company’s operations largely depends upon these relations, and that frank and cordial co-operation between the representatives of His Majesty’s Government and the company is accordingly the best safeguard for their mutual interests.

Byshire, June 19, 1909, 3‘40 p.m. WITH reference to Foreign Office telegram No. 17 303 to^on. Urgency exists; in fact that whereas Sheikh writes that he is in pressing need of money, no money can pass until the lease is signed. Before the dispatch of my telegram No. 610, I had written to Sheikh informally explaining circumstances, in which he was likely to he soon receiving 16,500L, and hoping that prospect would enable him to hold out for three weeks longer. I added that the moment draft reached me I would come to Mohammerah, and was confident that we should then finish matters satisfactorily and speedily. My telegram No^610 was sent with the idea that if I personally needed illumina tion on any point I might get it while draft was on way, and not have to delay in order to ask questions after its arrival. As regards question of reversion of buildings no action is needed at present. I hope that it may prove adjustable on lines indicated by Foreign Office or yourself, but I hesitate to be over-confident, as I have as yet had no discussion of the question with the Sheikh and Haji Rais, [? and] before I do so I am naturally anxious to be made personally acquainted as fully as possible with the views of His Majesty’s Government. It is conceivable that Sheikh and Haji Rais have never seen or heard of terms of Bakhtiari Agreement of 11th December, 1905 ; on the other hand it is quite possible that they have and that they may refer me to it, and ask why Sheikh’s territory should be given differential treatment. (Addressed to legation ; repeated to Foreign Office.) it [452—615]/-Confidential [22189 Foreign Office to Anglo-Persian Oil Company. gj r Foreign Office, June 15, 1909. directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the* 27th ultimo respecting the arrangements now being negotiated with the Sheikh of Mohammerah in connection with your pipe line and refinery in South-West Persia. A telegram has now been received from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire pointing out that the agreement concluded by Mr. D’Arcy with the Bakhtiari Khans on the 15th November, 1905, contains a provision for the reversion to the Khans of such buildings as were Mr. D’Arcy’s property, after the expiration of the period of the concession granted by the Shah. The Persian Government appears to have taken no exception to this provision. , As there is some similarity in the degree of dependence of the Sheikh and the Khans on the Persian Government, the existence of this provision in the case of^ the Khans seems somewhat to affect the considerations advanced in your letter of the 27th ultimo against allowing a similar reversion in the case of the Sheikh.

[2306 P -l]Ik ' -[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [20079] [May 28.] Section 2. No. 1. Anglo-Persian Oil Company to Foreign Office.—{Received May 28.) Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, r ’ * ci i , , / May 27, 1909. Ab he was about to leave^wn yesterday morning, Sir Hugh Barnes sent on to me yonr deim-offioia! letter of the 24th instant, and its inclosures, requesting me to deal with it m order to save time. ° . r. re &amp; ai( ^ s amount of the proposed loan, the present suggestion to increase it from 5,000/. or 6,000/. to 10,000/. does not in itself upset me, but from the form in winch it comes before me, it would look as though the proposed loan to the Sheikh from this company through the Foreign Office were not, as we understood that it was only a portion of a loan from the British Government to the Sheikh. In this connection I would refer you to my letter to Sir Charles Hardinge, dated the 28th of last month, which It tter was drafted m your Office for my signature, and of which the following is an extract :— .... if the proposal is agreeable to the Foreign Office I am t&lt;&gt; suggest that this company would contribute the sum of 5,000/. and 6,000/. through He Foreign Office towards the advance . . . .” Am 1 right in drawing the above inference ? I ask, because if I am it alters the complexion of affairs to such an extent from what I put before my directors when I received from your Office the letter which I was authorised to sign on the 28th April that I shall feel bound to consult them again. 3. If, on the other hand, whatever sum ive advance is to be this company^ contribution through the British Government towards some larger sum to be advanced by Government itself, then I am ready, if and when the terms of the lease are made satisfactory, to raise our contribution from 6,000/. to 10,000/. 4. The terms on which we would contribute 6,000/. or 10,000/. are for a loan bearing interests at 6 per cent, per annum and repayable in ten years, i.e., either at the end of ten years in full or by instalments as may be arranged, and a provision of the loan might vrell be that, in the event of default of payment by the Sheikh of any instalment of capital or interest, the same shall fall to be repaid, plus interest at 6 per cent, per annum, out of future instalments of rent as these become payable • by the company to the Sheikh. 5. I shall be prepared, as soon as satisfactory terms are agreed upon, to remit the money in question by telegram to Persia. 6. With reference to Major Cox’s telegram No. 486 of the 18th May, I enclose a copy of the letter from Mr. Reynolds, dated the 30th April, to which he alluded, of the inclosures thereto, and of Mr. Reynolds’ letter to us of the 24th April explaining the position. 7. Major Cox telegraphed under a misunderstanding when he said that no repre sentative of the syndicate had inspected the land that we want. We sent Mr. Andrew Campbell from Burmah to Persia last November, and the enclosed copy of a letter, dated the 27th November, 1908, from him to my colleague on the board, Mr. James Hamilton, will show you that he went very fully into the subject. 8. En passant I wmuld ask you to note that all the land that w^e require is at present uncultivated, or, as Mr. Campbell puts it, “ desert,” and that in clause 3 of our concession from the Government of Persia is the following:— “ The Government also grants to the concessionnaire the right of acquiring all and any other lands or buildings necessary for the said purpose with the consent of the proprietors on such conditions as may be arranged between him and them without their being allowed to make demands of a nature to surcharge the prices ordinarily current for lands situate in their respective localities. 9. Mr. Reynolds is not of opinion that 2,000/. per annum “ would not be unreason able.” On the contrary, though he wrote on the 24th April that in the then [2200 ee-2] Bcircumstances he personally recommended us to settle for 1,500Z. per annum (at that time knowing nothing of a proposed loan to the Sheikh, of course) he considered that we should have got better terms if he had tackled the matter some months previously, as we had intended him to do. 10. We know absolutely nothing of any arrangement or suggested arrangement fc^ paying Swintharis or any other people 1,000/. per annum or any other sum for pipes passing through their territory, and we think that this must be a mistake on Major Oox’s part. 11. So far as I can tell, the six numbered clauses describe our requirements fairly accurately, accurately enough for present purposes in regard to Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, and as regards 1 and 2 if these are detailed in the words used in the draft agreement attached to Mr. Reynolds’ letter to Major Cox, dated the 30th April enclosed, they will be acceptable to us. The lease will be from the Sheikh to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company not to the concessions syndicate. 12. As regards the length of the lease, it must be coextensive with our concession from the Persian Government and any extension thereof. This last appears to be the most serious point of divergence between the Sheikh and my company. 13. Of the two alternative methods of paying rent offered by the Sheikh I am prepared to accept the decennial method of paying 6,500/. in advance. And I think that if this be given, the loan might stand at the original figure of 6,000/. as otherwise the Sheikh will be getting paid down now, for rent and loan combined, 16,500/. plus whatever amount the British Government may be advancing to him. 14. With regard to the Sheikh’s four conditions, we cannot agree to No. 4 as I have already stated in paragraph 12 hereof. 15. No. 3 I agree to, provided always that petroleum be not included as treasure trove, for on petroleum, if found, we are already paying to the Government of Persia. 16. No. 2.—The second stipulation, that we shall not interfere in tribal affairs, we agree to, and subject to my being sure that I understand the first part I would agree to it also. I can see no objection to our abstaining from engaging any of the Sheikh’s tribesmen without his cognizance, but it might obviously lead to great inconvenience if at any time during a man’s engagement the Sheikh had power to call upon us to dismiss him unless he (or we) did something or other for the Sheikh. 17. No. 1.—Clause 15 of our concession from the Imperial Government of Persia reads as follows :— “ On the expiration of the terms of the present concession all materials, buildings, and apparatuses then used by the company for the exploitation of its industry shall become the property of the said Government and the company shall have no right to any indemnity in this connection.” We cannot consequently give the Sheikh a good title to machinery, plant, and buildings, as against the Government of Persia. All we can undertake to do, is not to remove any machinery, plant or buildings at the end of our lease, thus leaving the Sheikh and the Persian Government to settle the question of ownership between them. 18. As regards the last sentence in Major Cox’s telegram No. 486 Mr. Reynolds, who is in possession of a copy of Mr. Andrew Campbell’s letter of the 27th November, 1908, together with a copy of the sketch attached thereto, should be in a position to select provisional sites subject to provision No. 5 detailed by Major Cox, and I think that we may presume from the detail given in his draft agreement that he has done so. 19. Mr. Reynolds is coming home on leave shortly, and partly for this reason and partlv in consequence of your otfice letters Nos. 15593 and 15910 of the 27th April and 1st May, Mr. J. B. Lloyd, one of the partners of Shaw, Wallace, and Co. of Calcutta, Bombay, &amp;c., has gone to Persia (I believe him to be now in Mohammerah) to take charge of all the company’s affairs, and with plenary power from the company to negotiate this land and all* other questions. 20. If after reading this, you can spare me a few moments at any time convenient to you on Tuesday or Wednesday next, I will gladly call upon you and thereby save you both time and trouble in regard to the matter of a reply to Major Cox. I have, &amp;c. E. W. WALLACE, Vice-Chairman.Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Mr. Reynolds to the Concessions Syndicate, Glasgow.

Repeat fourth, fifth and ninth words of cable.” I received on the 20th your reply, via Aleppo, which bore the same date and by it I was enabled to read yours of the 14th, receipts of which I own above. 2. At the risk of being prolix, in your opinion, I would state that the Sheikh of Mohammei ah has two confidential men attached to him, Mulla Humza, in respect of matters in lurkey, and Hadji Rais, as he is called for Persian matters, and in a matter such as the acquisition of land by us on the Shat-el-Arab, he would probably consult both these men. On the afternoon of the 20th, in response for a request for an interview, I had a call from Mulla Ilumza and a chat on the subject and he assured me he would write and do his best to forward our wishes. I he same day I asked Mr. McDouall, His Britannic Majesty’s consul at Moham merah, to arrange an interview with Hadji Rais and it was only yesterday, in the morning that I saw him, and the Sheikh himself, with Hadji Rais, in the evening. 3. This man, Hadji Rais as he is called, is the power behind the Sheikh, and he can make or mar our negotiations with the Sheikh,’being at the present time the strongest man in Arabistan, in consequence of which he has to be propitiated, and then the negotiations with the Sheikh will be comparatively easy to put through. 4. My meeting with Hadji Rais was friendly enough, and it was clear he was glad that we were thinking of establishing a refinery at Abadan Island, on account of the advantage that Mohammerah would reap thereby, for I should tell you that I have always tried to put them off all idea of this, and said that my principals appeared to favour Bunder Dilam, by reason of its passing near to Kai Kaous in the pipe-line route. To obtain his good offices he quite unblushingly asked for 1,000 shares on the understanding that they were of a value of 1/. each, and added he wished to buy another 1,000 shares and that he could sell many shares among the people about. It is on this understanding that he agreed to do his best with the Sheikh of Mohammerah on our behalf, and the matter is alluded to in my wire of this date. 5. In the afternoon I visited the Sheikh of Mohammerah with Hadji Rais, and I gathered that the choice of sites was to them of no importance, and I named the northern ,as most suitable, for the reasons previously given. I was then asked to name a price that I thought fair to pay for the land on lease for so long as the concession lasted, and the right to lay the pipe-line through his country. To be brief, I named about 1,200/. per annum, and after some discussion the Sheikh asked me to name 2,000/. per year as the figure he wanted, and all cost of guarding to be on the company. Then it was inexpedient to press for settlement of the many petty details which go to make a good and workable agreement, for it was late in the afternoon and I trusted to your accepting a figure of say 1,500/. per annum, when details could be discussed and agreement drawn, for which by the v ay 1 need your permission. I do not think that you will do better than this now, though had it been done some few months ao-o it had been better, as then the news of the formation of the company would not have raised their cupidity, and the public news telegrams afforded them this information by the assistance ol His Britannic Majesty s consul at Mohammerah. \ ou though are aware of the causes of this unfortunate delay and are now aware that it was only on the 20th April that I had your authorisation to go ahead, acting on Major Cox’s J&lt;h ’ On my return here I wired, or hoped to wire you my message dated the 24th April, of which I enclose translation and original for your information. You willWUM M 4 see that the Sheikh absolutely refuses to sell the land to us, and it was questionable if it were expedient for us, being in the future neighbours, to attempt to work this sale under the authority of the concession, for the reason that the authority of His Imperial Majesty the Shah, nebulous at any time since the concession was granted, is now still more so, in fact they say he is dead as I write this. Under these circumstances I recommend you to accept the terms suggested, viz., 1,500/. per annum for 1 square mile, about 640 jereeb, I named, the right to lay pipe lines any where in his country, and all cost of guards to be paid by the company, the Sheikh nominating those so employed and we fixing the rate of pay in the agreement, and the guards to be paid monthly on or after the 13th on the month subsequent to that for which the pay is due. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Mr. Reynolds to Major Cox. (Confidential.) Dear Sir, Bussorah, April 30, 1009. I HAVE the honour to state that I took occasion to call on Captain Trevor when he was here recently, and asked him to tell you of the result, so far, of my seeing the Sheikh of Mohammerah re the land which is required by my principals for the refinery they propose to put up on Abadan Island, some few miles south of Mohammerah. Briefly put, we require 660 jereebs of land, which now is uncultivated, vith a frontage on the Shat-el-Arab of some 2,000 yards, the area to extend from the Shat-el- Arab to the Sahmishir River, and the exact boundaries will be defined after the survey in course of making is finished. We further require the right to lay our pipe-line, as far as possible, 2 feet to 3 feet under the ground, from the neighbourhood of the “ White Oil Springs,” via Weis and Ahwaz, along roughly the left bank of Karun to Mohammerah and down Abadan Island to the site selected for refinery, between the two villages of Barein, on north, and Bar wards on south of same. After some little discussion the price asked by the Sheikh per annum was 2,000/., the Company providing their own guards. A draft agreement drawn up by me, and as yet not shown to the Sheikh, is inclosed, which will be found to embody all we require of him. 2. On the 22nd I wired my principals what should read as follows : “ I had an interview with Sheikh of Mohammerah to*day, who, in consideration of 2,000/. per annum offers to hire us 640 acres on north site. Will permit pipe-line any where in his territories. Messrs, the C. S. L. must pay their own guards. V hat do you authorise me to offer ? “ Would suggest that you make him an offer of 1,600/. Strongly recommend you to accept this. The Sheikh is not selling land.” I am this day in receipt of a message which runs as follows : “ We are of opinion that 500/. per annum is ample for all land as per Campbell s survey and your selection and strip for pipe-line. . . “ W T e are arranging (that) Foreign Office, London, telegraph (to) British Minister, Tehran, authorising loan to Sheikh, conditional (on) his agreement with foregoing. To this I have this day replied as follows :— “ In reference to your cable of the 29th April no reference was made to loan. It is not understood.” 3. I now, apologising for the trouble I am giving you in this matter, and recog nising that His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, may possibly wire you on the matter, send you the above information, that you may be au eourant with what I have done and what has passed between the Sheikh and myself. I am leaving this for Ahwaz and the Oil Field to-morrow, and should occasion require, and the line be not disconnected, you can wire me there to “ Geobrey. Yours faithfullv, G. B. R.

Ibis area to be located opposite the island in the river and up stream from the garden adjacent to the landing-place used by steamers plying on the Upper Karun. 5. The Sheikh further undertakes to nominate watchmen for the efficient guarding of the property of the syndicate, and in each district through which the pipes may be laid, or the syndicate’s property exposed to possible loss, he will furnish the represen tative of the syndicate with the names of his representatives, who will be instructed by him to supply reliable men for this work, on receipt of a request from the syndicate’s representative on the spot. Any changes in the personnel of his representatives he will from time to time advise the syndicate’s representative. “ 6 . The guards employed being thus, as it were, guaranteed by the Sheikh, he under takes to indemnify the syndicate for loss incurred by theft of property, when such is in charge of the said guards, and in the event of damage done wilfully to pipe-line, tanks or other property of the syndicate, he undertakes to do his best to trace the offenders, and in the event of identification, to inflict such punishment as may deter others, in the future, from doing the same and with the object, also, of making the property of the syndicate respected in his lands. “ 7. The Sheikh further grants the right to the syndicate to make all bricks, tiles, &amp;c., required by them, and to erect on the lands so occupied by them, in accordance with the articles of this agreement, all buildings and machinery as may be needed by them for the proper execution of their business, which same buildings, &amp;c., will become the property of the Sheikh on the expiry of the concession referred to in the following article. “ 8 . This lease of land, and all the conditions pertaining thereto, will remain in force for such a period as may be then remaining, at the date of signing this agreement, of the concession granted to Mr. W. K. D’arcy by His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia , and dated , or such shorter time as the syndicate may wish, in consideration of the exigencies of their business, and, should the period of the lease be so curtailed, twelve calendar months’ notice of their intention will be given in writing to the Sheikh, prior to the termination of the lease. Such notice will be sent to the Sheikh, and, at the same time, a duplicate to His Britannic Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah, and its receipt by the latter will be held to be proof of its receipt by the former. “ 9 . This “agreement, and all the articles therein, are accepted by the Sheikh as binding on him and his heirs and successors, whom ever they may be. “ io. The syndicate, on their part, agree to pay the above-named rental to the Sheikh in the following manner :— and to the credit of the Sheikh in the hands of Messrs, the Impel ial t [2266 ee—2] Ct he receipt by the bank of the money being accepted as the full receipt of the Sheikh himself. “ 11 . The syndicate bind themselves to employ as guards and watchmen on l&gt;^ those who may be recommended as reliable by the Sheikh or his representatives in th'^, - various districts, but only so long as his support ot their authority over them, and his assistance in the detection of thieves, and his punishment of them, when detected, be real and effectual. t “ 12 . The payment to the guards and watchmen engaged from the Sheikh s men will be by the hands of the syndicate and on the following scale : ** Fifty krans per month of the Christian calendar and without food, and tins will take place fifteen days subsequent to the end of the month during which it were earned. “ 13. In the event of a watchman, or any employe, leaving without giving due notice of one month, it is the rule of the syndicate that fifteen days pay be forfeited, and, without exception, all native employes are engaged on these terms. “ 14. The syndicate reserve to themselves the right to punish the watchmen by inflicting fines to the extent of half-month’s pay as a maximum, and, in the event of their behaviour warranting a heavier punishment, they will be handed over to the representative of the Sheikh in the nearest place, who, instructed by the -Sheikh in the sense of paragraph 6 above, will do his best to uphold the authority of the syndicate among their watchmen and the respect of their property^ among the people of the district, so avoiding unnecessary trouble to both parties of this agreement. . . “ 15. This agreement is to be considered as in force from the date on which it is signed, from which date the syndicate become liable for the above-named rental. s • G. B. E. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Mr. Campbell to Mr. Hamilton. Dear Mr. Hamilton, Bussorah, November 27, 1908. I HAVE selected two excellent sites for refineries on Abadm Island, one about 15 miles from Fao telegraph station, at the entrance to the river, and the other about .29 miles from Fao and 11 from Mohammerah. . There appears to be sufficient desert at either place to put down all the refining plant in the world. In my opinion, the land is very suitable for our purpose, and, as there is a deep channel about half-a-mile broad at both points, steamers will be moored right alongside. Steamers landing plant will be able to do so within a few hundred yards of the sites. Steamers must not, however, draw over 18 feet, on^ account of the bar outside Fao. Those arriving about that draught are lightened outside the bar, and loading is completed there on departure. From enquiries made here and on board the mail steamer, I find that 18 feet is the “safe” draught, though when I came up in the “ Dwaika, drawing 16 feet, she had to scrape through the bar (which is soft and harmless as far as the ship is concerned) with only 14 feet of water. Then a “ shammal ” was blowing (a shammal is a strong north-westerly gale), and it appears that the wind has a great influence on the tidal rise of this river. A nor’-wester blows the water out and a southerly wind blows it in, so that, during the latter state of weather, ships have been known to get out drawing 21 feet. For regular traffic 18 feet should not be exceeded. The tidal rise is^ only 8—10 feet. The water was quite sweet at the time I tried it, and the amount of salt it contained exceedingly small. I am told that it remains so at all seasons. I enclose a rough tracing off the Admiralty chart you gave me in Glasgow showing sites selected. You will obtain a copy of the Busra Diver^ anchorage chart to place this over. I have left a copy of this tracing with Mr. Mackie, to whom you gave me a letter of introduction, and who has put me up comfortably, provided launches, &amp;c., and accompanied me over the ground. He know ? s the spots, and will point them out when asked to do so. . . These two sites are, as far as I can see, perfect for our purpose, and seeing the size of refinery in your mind, I suggest that you obtain not less than 500 acres having^ a river frontage of 1,500 yards. If, however, the ground is cheap enough, I should advise you to take up as much as you can get for the moneys y T ou vush to lay out.I strongly advise you to secure site A-B (and failino- it «itp r u- n • situated, as you will see from the rhart V which is could be easily led to it it is rie-ht on th^ ’ \ 8t ^°\ e ^hallab Point.

I have therefore disregarded it. There is a flooding in spring time which, the natives say covers the sites with about 6 inches of water. I do not think that serious, ku the water can easily be bunded out, and all foundations must be raised above nghest water-level. I have asked Mr. Mackie to visit the sites when this flooding next occurs, and to report it there is more than a foot or two of water there n i S 1 l mmer . conditions—May-October, when the temperature is seldom below 100 Fahrenheit night or day, and sometimes as high as 110 ° Fahrenheit in the daytime—the working of a refinery should, I think, be satisfactory. There is apparently great variation in the temperature—depending on the prevailing wind—south hot, north cool. On the morning of the 20 th it was 38° Fahrenheit at 6 a.m., and at the same time to-day it was 54° Fahrenheit. Building materials are not plentiful, but there is lots of clay on the site for brick making, and if arranged for well ahead, would be ready for building operations. I doubt if we could ever make bricks ourselves as cheaply as natives. Some of the bricks here aie faiily good, and work out a little cheaper than Bangoon bricks. They would suit us quite well.

Further piesent mail has brought me a letter from him begging that question of loan may be settled urgently. I recommend, therefore, that grant of 10,000 be reconsidered. ‘ s regards Sheikhs first stipulation: Definite pronouncement by company at ns stage that buildings will lapse to central Government will certainly upset Sheikh and also tribal headmen if they hear of it. In view of their firman, could not Sheikh and tribesmen be regarded as “ proprietors ” for purposes of article 3 of concession? ai mg that, I suggest that I should inform Sheikh after verification, as far as possible * ^ i • concession is prior to date of his firman (which we have not yet seen) and advise him not to raise issue now, but to accept undertaking of company to leave Duildmgs where they stood, and settle matter with Persian Government when the time comes. Similar argument will presumably apply to fourth stipulation. Sheikh, however, is sure to ask what is attitude of Government towards this issue, and I therefore beg to be apprised of their views as well as those of Company. As regards list of requirements in Reynolds’ draft agreement:— Paragraph 2 . Abadan Island proves to be practically 2 miles broad at point selected, not 1 mile as understood by Company. Paragraph 4. Sheikh cannot be expected to include grant of building sites on bank of Karun either at Ahwaz or Mohammerah within price agreed upon for pipe line and plot on Abadan, and it does not appear from Reynolds’ telegram of the 22nd April to his principals that he contemplated this. As regards other details of requirements, it appeared to me that it was of no use my discussing them until broad preliminaries had been arranged, but apart from items above mentioned there appears to be nothing which Sheikh is likely to take exception to ; My idea was that local agent of Company would work out and settle these details with Sheikh after fundamental conditions under correspondence had been settled.

On this assumption, and also assuimng that Sheikh does not demand more than 650L a-year rental, do you think he would be satisfied with a sum down of 12,500h, of which 6,500L would represent the capitalized value of ten years’ rent paid in advance and 6 , 000 L would represent a loan at (3 pei cent., repayable in ten years, either at the end of ten years in full or in instalments ? “As regards Company’s requirements summed up by Sheikh under six headings, draft Agreement inclosed in Reynolds’lette/of 30th April represents what would be acceptable to them.

CONFIDENTIAL. [Amended Copy.] [18831] No. 1 . Foreign Office to Sir Hugh Barnes. Dear Sir Hugh Barnes, Foreign Office, May 24, 1909. I INCLOSE paraphrases of two telegrams from Major Cox in regard to the proposals for the grant of a loan to the Sheikh of Mohammerah by His Majesty’s Government out of funds which would be furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, in return for the grant to them of a site for a refinery on Abadan Island, and a strip of land for a pipe line to connect the refinery with the oil wells.* We should like to have your observations on the terms proposed with as little delay as possible. In view of Major Cox’ opinion that the Sheikh’s terms as to rental are handsome, and only conceded out of deference to us, the Company will no doubt give them their careful consideration. As regards the Sheikh’s views as to the amount of the loan to be granted to him by His Majesty’s Government, I am to inquire whether the Company is prepared to accede to his request that it should amount to 10,000L, repayable in ten years. If the Company is so prepared, it would be necessary for them to let us know as soon as possible the terms, &amp;c., on which they would provide the funds, so that Major Cox may be informed without delay. You will see, from Major Cox’ earlier telegram, that he is anxious that Mr. Reynolds may be informed if the Sheikh’s proposals are considered satisfactory by the Company. We should be glad if we could see Mr. Reynolds’ letter of the 30th ultimo, as suggested by Major Cox.

The difficulty is how to commence negotiations and though the Foreign Office has been good enough to instruct His Britannic Majesty s Consul-General to assist in the matter, it has not so far been possible to make much progress. . . We . have hear d that the Sheikh is urgently in want of a small loan, and that while it is considered desirable to assist him in the matter, there is some difficulty in finding all the money required. In these circumstances, if the proposal is agreeable to the Foreign Office, I am to suggest that this Company would contribute the sum of 5,000/. to 6,000/. through the Foreign Office towards the advance required on the understanding that it is made a condition of this loan that the Sheikh first considers and settles satisfactorily the Company’s application for land and gives it, or procures for it a good title to all the land made over to it. The Company is of course ready to pay the reasonable market value of the land, either by purchase or by rent on a lease co-extensive with the currency of the Oil Concession or the extension of it, if absolutely necessary, but as this rate seems to be very high for such land we name it as an extreme. We presume that the Company’s advance will bear a reasonable rate of interest, say 6 per cent., and we trust that the Government will instruct its Representative to take the same care to safeguard the loan as would be exercised in the case of the advance of Government funds. It is understood, however, that though the Government will do their best to insure that the interest and sinking fund (if one is formed) are duly paid by the Sheikh, they do not undertake financial liability for the payment if [16185] CONFIDENTIAL.
