James Dow, Assistant Surgeon, temporarily in charge of the Residency, states that he has obtained information from the most respectable merchants at Bushire which suggests that sums of money, not exceeding at one time more than 25,000 rupees, could be procured at different periods. He suggests that much larger sums might be raised if Jervis were able to grant bills on the other two Presidencies in India. Dow concludes by listing the proportions that the different currencies available at Bushire bear to the Bombay rupee.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000059#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
