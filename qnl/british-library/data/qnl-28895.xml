Your telegram No,460 (of July 4th) and connected telegrams have been carefully considered. In view of the large sums we have given to this family during the war and particularly in view of the first instalment out of the loan .(see your telegram No. 546 (of August ' 15th)) of which Prince Firouz must have received a [ considerable share, I see no reason why we should now be called upon to acquit ourselves of any further 'debt of obligation'. You should therefore make it clear to Farman Farma that, though we recognise and fully appreciate his loyalty to us during the war, it is quite out of the question to give him a lease of property, in Mesopotamia as suggested or a further subsidy in cash. If prince Firouz raises the question here he will be given a similar reply.In any further communication on this subject, please quote /w, and address- The Under-Secretat of State, Foreign Oflioe.

A copy of a letter which has been addressed to the Treasury on this subject is also enclosed, here in, for Mr. Chamberlain's information. Lord Grey would be glad to learn whether Mr. Chamberlain concurs in His Lordship's proposal to Sir C. Marling to discuss the arrangement as suggested, and whether he will accept as a charge on Indian revenues one-half of the advance in question. I am.

Lord Grey would propose to authorise bir C. Marling to open discussions in this sense with the Persian Government, on the distinct understanding that the latter will affect the revenues of Fars, or other future assets, to the repayment of any advances which may be made. As Their Lordships are aware, it is on political grounds well nigh essential for British interests that Fars should be as orderly as possible, and Lord Grey trusts, therefore, that they will accept a moiety of the proposed advance as a charge on the imperial Exchequer, provided that the remain ing[grig Docnment is the Property of Hig Britannic Maiastr’g and should ba retarned to the Foreign Office when don e with unless required for official use.] ~ —'— ’rt » * ') msiA* 1 zJ s O Decypher r Sir C r Marling (Tehran) September 5th r i916 r Do 8 r 0rarm« Rr Bfl5pp« m. r September 5th^ 1916, NOr 589, Farm (sic) affaire, Your telegram Nor 263, June 3rdr Colonel Gough reports that after examination of the situation with Farman Farma he is convinced that for s©me months after arrival at Shiraz we must provide financing of (?scheme) conseidering chaos that has existed there for more than a year and fact that this year’s crops have been extensively damaged by l&amp;custs etc* I agree with them that unless Farman Parma’s mission is to tail financial support for it must be found temporarily, Persian Government can do nothing but will probably agree to an arrangement somewhat similar to that authorized by your telegram above-mentioned by which any advances made by His Majesty’s Government (?gr, omr n are') repayable out of (?farm) revenues or out of monthly subsidy when paid or out of other Persian revenues, Farman Farma puts monthly expenditure at tomans 50,000 of which tomans 20,000 is for Gendarmerie, May I discuss with Persian Government arrangement of this kind for a maximum, of tomans 50,000 for 6 month.■ '« •: I suggest toirians 50,000 because Sir Percy Sykes' arrival in Shiraz will place Gendarmerie in question on new basis entailing a reduction and presumably eventual disappearance of this item from total of advancer Colonel Gough will be able to exercise general con trol but not of course detailed supervision of expendi ture* Addressed to FrOr Repeated to Colonel GoughrIn any further communication on the subject, please quote IS and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, 4 London. no.

It seems clear that we can only save the situation by meeting force with force and for this purpose a defeat by Russian troops of the revel bed gendarmerie either at Ramadan or wherever they are accessible would be most effective* It is -particularly important to make parman Parma secure, and sole means of doing so is by having Russian troops within reach of Tehran. T'o occupy Teheran unless essential for protection of Legations might precipitate departure of shah, who is already at perabad, outside Tehran, and of some, if not all, of Persian Government, but troops should be near enough to prevent Gendarmerie and Germans occupying and becoming masters of Tehran. I trust therefore that Grand Duke may be able to order Russian troops according - ly. I understand that Furman Parma’s properties are extensive and that guarantee asked for would consequent ly involve a considerable sum* We should eventually have to recover it from Persia, but I am asking Mr* Mar1ing for further de taiIs, Repeated to Tehran No.418.
