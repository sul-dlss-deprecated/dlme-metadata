MUSCAT A1TD MUTTRA I had only a few hours at luscat on my way out, but had an opportunity of seeing the political Agent and the director of Customs aiiG during my convexsation v/itn the latter I gathered that the tr8.de of Muscat was dwindling. The town of Muscat is practically deserted, and no business whatsoever is taking place there. All the merchants are trading in Muttra, and consequently al though the cargo is landed at Muscat, there being no caravan route from there it has to be again re-shipped to Lluttra by boats, in volving a very heavy expenditure. I gathered from the Director of Customs that many ports in the Sultan of Muscat's territory and tov/ns south and within a few miles of Muscat were being supplied from Dubai. This I mentioned to the Political Agent who expressed surprise and enquired of a European who had been travelling in these districts as to this, who confirmed that such was the case. The Political Agent stated that the Residency were anxious to &lt;^1 divert the trade from Dubai, and had talked of opening a port at Khasub in the Sultan's territory at the entrance of the Persian Gulf. I gathered however that it is not certain whether the trade oould be diverted to this place, as it is questionable whether the route into the interior is practicable for caravans. In any case the population there is small, and it would take some considerable time to develop it. I pointed out to the political Agent that the Sultan by in sisting ormll cargo being landed at Muscat and then transhipped to \ ' / I h ■■■O ~ ~ Muttra was strangling trade and below I give a comparison of what it now costs to land 100 ba^p of Rice at Futtra under the present system of discharge at Muscat as compared to Dubai:- MUSC AT Landing Charges Re.18/12- 0 * Boat Hire to Muttra w 20- 0- 0 Rs.38-12- 0 Duty 5% say Rs.75- 0- 0 Ea.1T5-12- 0 * Sultan receives from the contractor. DUBAI / Landing Charges Rs,16- 0- 0 Sheikh^ charges. Customs etc.' 25- 0- 0 Kg.41- 0- Q / No duty is charged. I suggested to the Political Ajent that the only way for the trade of Muscat territory to develop would be for Muttra to be made the Port {the Captain of the 'Baroda' told me it would be more suitable than Muscat and was more protected) as the change would result in landing charges and boat hires being reduced by half, and that if the Sultan wished to increase trade he should allow cargo to be re-exported at a very much lower rate of duty so as to compete with Dubai and other ports. The Political Agent admitted that there was a great deal in what I said but was of opinion that the Government of India would not scrap Muscat as they had built a very fine Residency, post and Telegraph Office, a Cable StatitM and other buildings there. Also he mentioned that the Sultan's Palace was at Muscat, and the steamers when entering fired a salute. He said that perhaps it might be arranged to make .Muttra the Port and allov; steamers to( 4~ - 3 - land their cargo there if the Company would agree to call at Muscat, say for two hours to land nails, I consider that it is detrimental to the trade of the Oman District for Muscat to be continued as a port solely for senti mental reasons, and that in opening up Muttra instead, not only would there be an increase in trade owing to the lower cost, but also a large export trade could be developed if the Sultan were to reduce Customs duty on such goods as is done by the Chiefs at other Gulf Ports Busreh, 19/2/26.

Thomas which gives his views on a memorandum 'by Mr. 'Jills forwarded with your D*C.lTo. 81-S of 3rd LTarch 1926. The merchants I have consulted are unanimous in their opinion that : arU^rn-vould be a better port of call for B. T. steamers than lluscat, if the Customs wiiarf Y;ere extended At present it is far too small to admit of the landing and storing of goods brought by tne Bombay and Karachi steamer. The I T uscat Customs House on the other hand is commodious and quite capable of meeting the demands made upon it. he majority of the merchants consider tnerefore that Muscat should continue to be the port of call 'or the Bombay end Ka rachi steamers for the time being.,/ Apart from the 1: e'e of Customs house facilities however is superior to TTuscat as a port of call,as the harbour is protected from the Shsmal and Kaus winds and open to the Hashi wind only whereas Muscat cove is exposed to both the ohamal and the Pas hi w i no. s» Iiuscat is moreover cut off from the interior by tne hills which sur round it whereas Muttra is visited by all camel caravans.

If the Sultan and the Customs House departed.the port would protatly die a natural death, 1 do not mean to imply by these views thpt I anticipate the early demise of Muscat. I do not consider it to be at all likely that His Highness will change his residence.^The hills y which detract from its desirabilitv as a 'Dort, add considerably to its attractions as a safe refuge for a some what insecure ruler gmong a turbulent people .J; ^he state of the finances must render any scheme for en- largin^f the Customs House abortive. Unless the Sultan and the Customs House leave Muscat I think it would be premature to consider the question of changing the location of the Con sulate, the Post Office, the Telegraph Department or the Agency Hospital.V Ministry of Finance I'u 3 cat 22nd Larch 1926. Cct-A In the remarks 'below I have criticised the trade and financial imp] icatioiG of the views contained in 1'r. bill's r iemorandum rather than state a case for IJuscat as a port ac against Hat rah or vice versa. In my opinion the case chan. e is untenable hut first to leal with the fiucstion^ raised, 1 ]!u.scat (gc Duhai , It is true that Muscat as a port ha^ declined hut not for the self-straa'ulatory reasons ref^ered to 'by I jr. T . ills. I was already fully aware,and I should have thought Colonel Grosthwaite had heeii too, that Duhai has a considerable share of our northern Batinah trade. Nothing is more natural or more inevitable. Dubai's pearl wealth has given it a wreat and rrowin- purchasing power. Thus it habit ually buys nearly the whole of our Shumailiyah date crop and most of the buildinc timber cut in the Sill behind the Batinah ports as far south as Buwaic. This is sea borne. 1 myself when on tour have also seen big butter caravans leaving the Batinah towns for Dulai by the land route. Camels and ships having disposed of t 1 eir valuable freights at Dubai do not return empty-handed. It would be ludicrous to imagine them coming empty away, bach to the Batinah where they belong and thence setting off in the opposite direction to Muscat and ¥atrah to buy rice and cloth which are available in Dubai. The reason that the -^atinah buys from Dubai is that Dubai buys the Batinah dates and timber and butter, thus providing cheap and ready-made transport for the return journey. have That Dubai happens tQ A no customs duties and is a cheap port is a mere accident^al featvre of the situation.11 Bu^ai ^ IChasalD. a-'-*# Jfe, : f / | a£ regards tie proposed port of Khasal) I have a t&gt; 1 -il - o onscience a 'bout) uiiis as 'the I r on, poliljical Besiden c ro - anc.. asked me to make a point of visitinr it to exylcre itr possiDilities (l) as a port, (ll) as a hill . d oatioii.

At the outset I am at variance with Tr. ' ills Then he claims that the change froir Muscat to ITatrah would develop trade.What fresh resources are there which we do not already tap? There is no port within hundreds of miles of Muscat which can he regarded as a rival and w M scat at present taps all the coastal area south of Suwaiq*. and its hinterland almost exclusively so far as the B.I. Company is concerned.

These figures @Yen if absolutely correct which I do not admit would fail to ar^ue a deflection of trade 300 miles tj camel or any other means of transport. And to reduce the Muscat charges to zero would which not materially increase the volume of trade within Geograph ical limits, Muscat already monopolises.

But Zakat in the present ruffled political state of the country is incapable of being taken at the source. Goods of indigenous orgin are taxed 5/£ on export in lieu of Zaxat « There is no re-export tax on goods of foreign origin. To adopt the measure (3) suggested by Mr.Wills would entail a loss of 3 lakhs of revenue and plunge the State into irrevocable bankruptcy. Mr, 'wills in asking that luscat should assimilate its taxes to those of Dubai would appear to be innocent of a fundamental difference political and governmental in the two States.

Indeed this is the history of events at Gwadur. There the B.I. Company in fact asked for the Landing Contract as a matter of right: and the State- nominated contractor (not their Agent) was Suueezect out by the Company though it is only fair to add, by my connivance.

As regards Mr, Thomas 1 comments, if you will excuse me saying so, I think he has rather dril ^fted from the subject and that he has lost sight of the probability that the Oman Government would receive a very much larger revenue on increased imports by a gre^t® demand from the interior if they reduced the initial expenses on goods by cutting out the Muscat -Hut rah transport and transhipment expenses# Further, a reduction in the tariff for re-exported oar go would also bring in revenue which the Government does not receive at present, and which Dubai and other Gulf ports cater for.I am sorry to see that Mr. Thomas thinks mjr report was possibly put forward solely with a view to He spere t airing ad vantage of any improvement in the export trade.
