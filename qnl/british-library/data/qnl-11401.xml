SIMLA: PEINXED AI THE GOVEENMENT MONOTYPE PRESS. 1917.KA—KAA 977 K KA (A l)— See (AI) Qa'a. KA'AB— Pronounced Cha'ab; the singular is Ka'abi (Cha'abi). The Ka'ab are the largest and most important tribe of Southern 'Arabistan; they are Arabs, but at the present day they are to some extent Persianised. Distribution. —The Ka'ab form almost the entire population of the Fallahiyeh District, which is their headquarters, and they also occupy the greater part of 'Abbadan island, especially towards its lower end ; the articles under these name? with those entitled Janjireh and Shatut include the greater bulk of the villages of the Ka'ab. A few occur in the Haffar tract on the right bank of the Karun in the Muhammareh District, and some on the left bank of the Bahmanshir. Ka'ab are found in considerable numbers in the Jarrahi district, where they occupy the river-bank villages of Khar Faraih, Bunwar, Bun- war Rizaiq, Maksar, Maksar 'Atiqeh, Suwaireh, Kurduniyeh, Maqtu' Fauqani, Haskeh, Maqtu' Hadrani, Khamzeh, Sidaireh, Saraimeh, Dob-al-Mir, Tuwaqiyeh and Qarqar, and have settlements in the interior at Dauweh, 'Aquleh, Hor Trawaishid, Idaideh, Abu Saileh, Khalafiyat, Hamad and Haji Asghayar, and they spread nortwards into the Ahwaz District at Banneh and Shakheh: the tribe is represented also at Cham Sha'abani, Gharabi Kuchik and Hindiyan Village in the Hindiyan District. Detached colonies of Ka'ab emigrants occur further down the coast of Persia in the LIrawi, Rud-hilleh and Angali districts ; but these are tribally isolated and unimportant. In Turkish 'Iraq some immigrant Ka'ab are settled at Fao. Sub-divisions and numbers. —The structure cf the Ka'ab tribe has been carefully investigated, but the results elicited are conliicting even as regards main divisions and sub-divisions. The ordinary tribesman has no ideas whatever on the subejct of the composition of his tribe, and the theories which are entertained by intelligent individuals here and there do not command general acceptance. One fact stands out clearly, that the tribe consists partly of original and partly of adscititious families and groups, the divisional name Dris being closely associated with the former, and that of Khanafireh with the latter of these two classes. The more minute classification of the Ka'ab depends not on blood relationship but on political accidents, for the name of a headman's family or section is generally extended to include all who find (or place) themselves under his authority ; it follows that there are many semi-obsolete names, as well as aliases both exact and partial. The following is the classification of the tribe which appears most satisfactory to express the facts in so far as the^ are known :— Division. Sub-division. Section. Fighting strength. Habitat and remarks. Dris 'Asakireh 'Abbadi ( a1 B u) 80 on both banks of Khor D5raq below B u z i y e h, on the Khor branch of the Aushar canal, and on the 'Abdun Nabi canal of the Jan jireh group.

It should be added that of the above only Dns and Nassar divisions are universally regarded as true Ka'ab ; the Khanafireh and Muqaddam are frequently described not as Ka'ab but as Tawaif, that is ' (dependent) tribes.' There are said to be other adscititious Ka'ab also who are not included among either the Khanafireh or the Muqaddam. _ , , , . , x ^ ±. ^ t This is the system of classification of the Ka'ab which seems to be the most worthy of adoption out of two or three that have been propounded ; but in order to exemplify the discrepancies of opinion which exist another is now added in brief. It is as follows I JJris (fighting strength 6,000 men). III. Khanafireh (fighting strength 3,000 1. Dris. 2. Kasir (A1 Bu). 3. Nassar. II. Muqaddam (fighting strength 1,100 men). 1. Is-haq. 2.

The total strength of the Ka'ab tribe is, and must be, largely a matter of conjecture ; but, if the first table of sections given above be accepted as correct, the number of fight ing men arrived at is 15,722 as below:— r'Asakireh .. .. .. .. 4,750 Dris .. &lt; Ghubaish (Al Bu) .. .. .. 3,042 (.Nassar .. .. .. .. 1,200 Khanafireh .. .. . • . • • • • • 4,680 Muqaddam .. .. . • • • • • .. 2,050 Total .. 15,722 According to the principle on which fighting strength is usually calculated the figures given would represent a total of about 55,000 souls, — a number which is not patently either in excess or in defect. These statistics do not include the Ka'ab colonies outside Southern 'Arabistan nor those of the Hindiyan District; the members of the latter in number about 1,500, mostly belong to a section called Sha'abani not shown in any classi fication table of the tribe that has been obtained. Arms. —It may be added here that a large number of long-barrelled muzzle-loaders are still seen among the Ka'ab, and that almost every fighting man of the Dris and Khanafireh divisions is armed either with one of these or with a superior weapon. The numbers of rifles possessed by the Muqaddam and Hazbeh are indicated above in the table of sections. Religion and life. —The Ka'ab, like all the other tribes of Southern 'Arabistan are Muhammadans of the Shi'ah persuasidn. They cannot except in a few places be de scribed as altogether settled, nor on the other hand are any considerable proportion of them truly Bedouin. The bulk of the tribe are now in that stage of development, in termediate between nomadism and fixity, which is typified by the huts—less removeable than tents and more easily abandoned than houses—in which they dwell. In out-of- the-way tracts like Shatut the Ka'ab are still very primitive in their ideas and habits ; and in some places a tradition as to the iniquity of buying and selling things for money lingers amongst them. Like the Pathans of the Indo-Afghan frontier they have a strong objection to being seen in a state of nudity, and this prejudice is even said to give rise to embarrassment among themselves when rivers have to be crossed by swimming. Where the Ka'ab possess arable lands they cultivate wheat, barley and rice ; where pasture exists they own buffaloes, cattle, sheep, goats and even donkeys ; in the marshes they move about in light canoes, catching fish and snaring or shooting wild fowl; at Fallahiyeh Town they are otherwise noted as the manufacturers of very fine and light woollen 'aftas for summer wear. Origin, history and political position. —The Ka'ab claim to be 'Awamir or Bani 'Amir descended from a certain Ka'ab-bin-Rabi'-bin-'Amir who was himself, they say, the 24thKA'AB 991 in descent from Ishmael. It is stated that the original home of the Ka'ab was in Najd and that some of the tribe are still to the found there at a place called Bishauramyahi; all efforts to identify this locality have, however, up to the present, been unsuccessful. According to tribal tradition the majority of the descendants of Ka'ab eventually es tablished themselves in Northern Africa ; but Nassar and Dris, the legendary progenitors of the Ka'ab of Southern 'Arabistan made their way from Najd to Doraq and occupied it after expelling some other Arab tribes and some Afshar or 'Aushar Turks whom they found in possession. The date of these supposed events is altogether uncertain. Early in the seventeenth century, apparently the capital of the Ka ab tribe was at Qubban ; and there it remained until 1747, when a move was made to Fallahiyeh Town or Doraq- al-Fallahiyeh as it was then styled. Another old settlement of the Ka'ab, since abandoned, was Sablah or Sablah ; it stood on the right bank of the Karun river, opposite to the island of Dair and the Marid creek. The history of the Ka'ab tribe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is a part of that of 'Arabistan, which is related at length else where. Here it is enough to add that shortly after 1775 the jurisdiction of the Ka'ab chiefs seems to have extended from the neighbourhood of Basrah to the confines of Behbehan ; but their influence declined as that of the Muhaisin rose, and the chiefs of the Ka'ab, stripped of political power, have sunk in recent years into undistinguished vassals of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The divisional Shaikhs have no political power; the most important among them are Shaikh Rizaij of the A1 Bu Ghubaish (Bait Hilayil), who is in charge of Buziyeh and lives there ; Shaikh 'Abud, the head of the Khanafireh ; Shaikh Musa of the 'Asakireh, and Shaikh Sultan of the Muqaddam, who is at present in jail. KA'AB (B ani)— Sin ular Ka'abi. A tribe in the interior of the 'Oman Promontory, having their headquarters at Mahadhah, in the neighbourhood of which they are nearly all found.

KA'AB AH— i A spring in the Qatif Oasis {q. v.), in Eastern Arabia. KA'AB AN Singular Ka'abi. A small tribe of Bahrain and Qatar who regard Ka'ab-al-Habar, a companion of the prophet Muhammad, as their ancestor and claim tribal connection with the Ka'ab of Persian 'Arabistan and the Bani Ka'ab of Trucial 'Oman. About 60 nomad families of Ka'aban belong to Qatar ; 30 other nomad families wander in the neighbourhood of Jabal-ad-Dukhan in Bahrain ; and 30 families, employed in the pearl fisheries, are settled at Jasairah on Bahrain Island. In religion the Ka'aban are Maliki Sunnis. They are said to have accompanied the 'Utub from Qatar to Bahrain, but their earlier movements are untraceable.

It is a fine sheet of water with wooded banks and is sometimes dotted with waterfowl. At low tide the foot of the creek, called Khor-al-Maqta' Tubli, is a stretch of mud covered with stumpy mangroves, which a donkey-rider can cross at a ford 1 mile from its end without wetting his feet. KABD— A locality about 25 miles south-west of Kuwait town, between the district of Qra'ad on the east and that of Shaqq on the west. Kabd is a row of hills or belt of high ground extending east and west over a distance of 6 miles. Immediately to the south of Kabd is a parallel ridge called Kabaidah or Little Kabd, having to the east of it some wells called Jahliyah, and to the south of it a well-known Bedouin landmark called Eijm-al-Jahtan. South of Rijm-al-Jahtan, again, is Fawaris, a small plain diversified by hillocks. A group of five small hills at the western end of Kabaidah is called Minaqish; they are of a whitish hue and stand between the route from Jahrah to Riqa'i and that from Kuwait town to Hafar. KABDA— An inland village of the Eastern Hajar District {q, v.) of the 'Oman Sultanate. KABlR (W adi-al)— A valley in the Dhahirah district of the 'Oman Sultanate which runs south-west wards and debouches on Wadi Sanaisal, a little above 'Ibri in Dhahirah.

The suitability of the place as a terminus for the proposed Baghdad Railway is discussed by Gaptam E. W.S.Mahon, R.B., in a report dated the 24th July 190S. See also Government of India's Foreign proceedings for February 1905.KADHIMAIN—QADHA. 995 the cove shoals gradually from its entrance, where it is 4 miles broad and 6 fathoms deep in mid-channel, to its head, which is 9 miles west by south of Ras 'Ashairij and within about 2 miles of the village of Jahrah. There is an anchorage, well sheltered from the Shamal, which would accommodate a large number of ships of 24 feet draught; but there is no deep water close to the shore, and cargo would have to bo worked in lighters or a large pier built Ras Kadhamah is a low swampy point ruining out some 3 furlongs southwards into the cove at about 3 miles from its head ; it is hardly above sea level, but it is partially protected by a natural bank of sand which follows the highwater line. It is in Dohat Kadhamah that the best transhipping anchorage lies, since on account of its narrowness it is sheltered both from the Shamal and the Qaus, 1 he southern shore is bordered by rocky shoals ; to the north, west, and south are sandy plains from which, with the wind at anything above force 5, sand and dust are blown in such quantities that the hills to the west the town of Kuwait, and other more or less distant navigation marks are completely obscured. In order therefore to make this anchorage secure and safe from a navigating point of view a tall beacon has been constructed on Eas Kadhamah and an anchoring buoy laid in the anchorage. The bacon has been placed in the transit line between the anchoring buoy and Gap hill. It is^ of great value, even when that hill is not visible, both as a transit and fixing mark. With these two aids to navigation the largest vessels, even those which have never been in these waters before, can proceed into Dohat Kadhamah with absolute confidence. Perhaps the time may not be far distant when railways will terminate on jetties in D5hat Kadhamah ; nor is there any reason why these jetties should not admit of the largest ship going alongside them, KADHIMAIN QADHA— , A division of the Baghdad Sanjaq of the Baghdad Wilayat in 'Iraq. Position and fcouttiams.—The Qidha of Kadhimain embraces the greater part of that narrow section of Mesopotamia which is enclosed between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates where they approach one another in the neighbourhood of Baghdad City. On tho north-east side the Tigris divides Kadhimain from the Qadha of Baghdad ; on the north Kadhimain appears to be in contact with the Qidhas ot Sa mar rah and Dilaim ; the adja cent districts on the west, south-west, south and south-east are Dilaim, Karbala, Hillah and Jazirah respectively. Topoprctphy and tribes.—~-ThQ only places of importance in this Qadha are Abu Bhuraib* Kadhimain Town and Mahmudlyah, all of which are described under their proper names.

The principal canals which traverse the Qadlm are described in the articles on the Euphrates river : they are those apparently from the Saqlawiyah to the Latifiyah inclusive. Administration. —Under Turkish rule the Qadha was of the _ 3rd class ^nd was not, ru.i.a-cilly, sub-divided into NShij'ahs ; the town ot Kadhimam wa» the chef-hen. iho Mrat al samyah had established a firm hold on the district and were represented by Mudirs at Abu Ghuraib and MahmSdiyah. KADHIMAIN TOWN— . Known also as Imam Musa ; this town in 'Iraq, situated on the right bank of the Tigris about 3 miles north-west of Baghdad City, is important b^th as a Shi ah place of pil grimage and as the headquarters of a Qadha of_ the same name in the Sanjaq and Wilavat of Baghdad. It is connected with Baghdad by a horse-tramway (which was- constructed by Midhat Pasha, Wali of Baghdad about 1870, and runs most of the way along the top of an embankment^ and with Mu'adhdham on the opposite bank of the Tigris by a bridge of 21 boats. The permanent population of the town is about 8,000 souls, all Muhammadans, of whom about 7,000 are Shi'ahs ; about 1,000 are Persian subjects ; 200 are British subjects, being Indians or of Indian descent; and 50 are Russian subjects of Persian race. The town is a hot-bed of vice venereal and ophthalmic maladies are common, and the passage through the place of nearly all the Shi'ah corpses sent from Persia to be buried at the holy places of Najaf and Karbala in no wise adds to its salubrity. In the cold weather the population is largely increased by Shi'ah pilgrims on their outward and re turn journeys. The chief feature of the place is the tomb of the 7th and 9th Shi'ah Imams, namely, Musa-bin-Ja'far and his grandson Muhammad-bin 'Ali, from whom the town derives its name of Kadhimain or '• the Two Self Restrained Ones,' although in strictness the epi thet of Kadhim belongs to the 7th Imam alone. Christians are not admitted within the precincts of the shrine, which is surrounded by a lofty wall; but a good general view of the buildings can be obtained from the roof of a Khan which faces the main entrance. The structure has the form of double cube, each of the two portions of which is surmount ed by a cupola ; and four tall galleried minarets spring from near the corners of t'ao build ing. After his visit to the shrine in 1874 Nasr-ud-Dln, Shah of Persia, imitating the munificence of Nadir Shah at Karbala, caused the twin domes to be plated and the minarets to be richly ornamented with gold, and the general effect produced by the largo surfaces of the precious metal is brilliant in the extreme. The coloured encaustic tile work of the entrance gate and minarets, also the stalactite corbelling below and the carved wood-work above the galleries of the minarets, are equally remarkable. The shrine is richly endowed and the endowments were formerly under the management of the Auqaf Dspartment of the Turkish Government by whom the salaries of the custodians and attendants were paid. There are graveyards here for devout Shi'ahs, of which the principal is the Maqabir-i-Qaraish ; but they do not possess equal sanctity with those of Najaf and Karbala. Combs and small artistic objects of ivory, wood and tortoise-shell are manufactured for export, chiefly by Persians ; Kashi or encaustic tiles and bricks are also made by Persians ; and there are some skilful Persian painters who decorate walls and roofs. The weaving of silk kerchiefs and handkerchiefs is a considerable industry and some of the handkerchiefs are sent abroad as far as to Tunis and Algeria ; there arc also tanneries. There is a trade in Persian carpets which the pilgrims, combining business with the performance of a religious duty, bring with them from their country ; and the fact that the pilgrims mostly leave their riding animals to wait for them at Kadhimain while they proceed by stage-coach to Karbala, creates a large demand for forage. The pilgrims, many of whom are visitors from cold climates, are considerable purchasers of tea, sugar and wollen cloths. Kadhimain contains 30 Khans or hostelries and over 300 shops. Under Turkish rule, the principal civil officials were the Qaim-Maqam of the Qadha and representatives of the Departments of Customs and Public Debt. The ordinary police forca of Kadhimain consisted of about 50 Dhabitlyahs, but at the Muharram, and onKAD—KAH 997 fttlier occasions of religious excitement, large re -inforcements were drafted into the town from Baghdad City, with which there is tel graphic communication. There is also a post office. The town is constituted as a municipality. An honorary Naib-Karpardaz or Consular Agent is charged with the interests of Persian subjects.

It has no harbour, but a poor anchorage to the west of the village which is least exposed during the north-east monsoon. The houses are scattered amongst the palm groves, and have small gardens in which gourds, melons, and tobacco are grown. It possesses one mosque, a paltry edifice. The place is poor-looking, but has neat, sand-strewn streets. There are wells in the village ; and three miles away under the northern slope of the Kallansayia range there is a stream which flows past the ruins of an ancient town, and irrigates groves of palm and other trees. Separated from the sea by a bar of shingle, and fed partly by this stream, is a lagoon which is covered with wild duck and fringed with trees and mangroves. The sea shore is rendered pestiferous by rotting seaweed, and by the bodies of sharks, with back fin and tail cut off, which are left to dry on the beach. The Kallansayia range is distinct from the Haghier mountains, and rises to a height of 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The 0 highest peak is called Matalah.

KAMALlYAH—• An agricultural tract in tbe Karbala Qadha {q. v.). KAMARAN— The Island of Kamaran lies about 15 miles south of Lahlyah, and 45 miles north of Hodaidah, and well within sight of the Arabian mainland/ It is 12 miles in length north to south. The northern end is less than 2 miles broad but for the greater part the Island is about 4 miles in width. The general appearance is that of a desert, featureless and barren. The ground is low and sandy, rising a little towards the southern end where there are a few hillocks ; on the northern side there is swamp and low scrub. There are a few isolated spots on which a few date trees grow and which, with their shallow wells and scanty patches of green, are pointed out to the stranger as examples of oases.KAMARAN 1001 Numerous evidences scattered about everywhere go to prove that the Island is the result of a dereliction. The time of its first appearance above the surface of water ia unknown. It is surprising to note that the appearances which it possessed hundreds of years ago while under water are still preserved to a very great extent. The reason of this might be found in the scanty rainfall and the poorly inhabited state of the place) so that neither the activities of man nor the influences of nature have been sufficient to alter the configuration and the other signs peculiar to land that once formed the bottom of the sea. The coast is very much indented and surrounded by reefs and shoals which, however,, do not extend very far. The Island on the west and two promontories extending some ten miles from the average lines of the mainland coast on the east and south, form the boundaries of the Kamaran bay which is about ten miles in length and seven in breadth and affords capacious anchorage for all classes of vessels in from 5 to 15 fathoms. The northern entrance is about 4 miles between the shoals and presents no difficulty. The southern entrance is little over a mile and is reduced by the shallows from both points to a breadth of about 2 cables. On the eastern shore of the Island a few miles north of the southern extremity the bay runs inward forming the Kamaran harbour which affords for very small vessels good anchorage in 7 fathoms. The entrance to this harbour is If cables wide between the 5 fathoms line. The harbour is well buoyed; dhows always lie here. Southerly winds are almost continuous from October to March. At times they blow very hard. During these months tain falls now and then and the climate is unhealthy and the wet and dry thermometer stands about the same height. Northerly winds are hot and dry and blow ftom April to September. Dust storms are common from August to the middle of October. These come from the north-east over the mainland and con tinue for some hours. The wind which brings them is extremely strong. A thick wall of dust miles broad and reaching up to the heavens suddenly appears in the horizon and soon envelops you in a few minutes. The heavens darken and the atmosphere gets thick with dust which causes distress for some hours. The chief interest of Kamaran lies in the fact that it is a Quarantine station for all pilgrims going to Mecca from the Persian Gulf, India, and the Straits Settlements and the adjoining Islands. Between forty and fifty thousand pilgrims annually undergo quarantine at Kamaran before they are allowed to proceed to Jiddah en route to Mecca. The period of quarantine ranges from 24 hours to 5 days. The pilgrim season lasts for about 8 months in the year. The town of Kamaran situated at the head of the harbour is said to be increasing. It is very dirty. Extremely short, narrow, unpaved streets separate the rows of houses. Sanitation is most primitive and it is surprising that an epidemic is seldom heard of. Possibly the abundance of fresh air and the scantiness of the population have some thing to do with it. The inhabitants are mostly fishermen. Some are employed in pearl fishery. The officials of the Island were the Mudir, the Captain of the port, and the Director and staff of the Lazarette. There are five small villages scattered about the Island. The total population is about 3,000. At the town of Kamaran, beef and mutton can be obtained in small quantities. Vegetables are difficult to procure as they mostly come from Hodaidah. During the pilgrim season there is always a good supply of condensed water, and ice can also be procured- Tt is not advisable to use water from the wells for drinking purposes. The northern shore of the harbour contains the ice factory and the condensing ins tallation. Eighty blocks of ice each weighing about 35 lbs. can be turned out every day. The quantity of water used on an average is 26 tons daily. There is a stone pier about 100 yards long on this side of the harbour, with a small house at its outer extremity. It is here that the pious pilgrim from infected ports first meets with the operation of the quaratine regulations. The British Vice-Consulate, the Quarantine office and the quarters for the Director and the staff of the Lazarette are also on the same side. There are five large quarantine camps, and one small one, situated to the north of the harbour along the eastern shore of the Island, covering a distance of about 2J miles. Accommodation is intended for 6,000 pilgrims. Each camp is surrounded by a wire ience, with two or three gates which are kept closed except when affording passage to authorised persons. The main gate is guarded by a Turkish soldier. The pilgrims live C52(w)GSBKAM—KAN in what are ca.W X liLs the' pelTrf :!fd t nxlrp^ro%ssrtU ^ P ag rim8 .

The Kamaran Quarantine Station, for pilgrims on their way to and from Mecca is situated on the eastern side of Kamaran Island, which belongs to Turkey The pilgrims are segregated in enclosed camps and kept there for a number of days that varies with the circumstances. There is a well-equipped hospital and a number of houses for the accommodation of the medical staff. The admimstration is m the hands rof the international quarantine board, and the doctors and other off^aW very cosmo politan. The station has a short tramway, an ice-makmg plant, and a distillery, and is (connected by telegraph from Ras-al-Mo'aram with Salif, on the main land, and thence with Hodaidah and the general system. On the other side of the Kamarans there is a small native village in a palm-grove ; otherwise the islands are practically devoid of vegetation.

KARBALA QADHA— j The headquarters division of the Sanjaq of Karbala in the Baghdad Wilayat in 'Iraq Position and boundaries. —The Qadha of Karbala extends, at a short distance west of the Euphrates, from the parallel of Musaiyib (or a little above it) down almost to that of Najaf town : at Musaiyib however it actually touches the river and even reaches a few miles to the east of it. On the north the Qadha is in contact with that of Dilaim : on the north-east with that of Kadhimain ; on the east with that of Hindiyah and possibly with that of Shamlyah ; on the south with that of Najaf; and on the west with the fehaml- yah Desert. Topography and inhabitants, —-By far the largest and most important place in the Qadha is the town of Karbala, described elsewhere under its own name ; but the town of Musaiyib, the settlement of Shifathah, and the village Sikandariyah are also deserving of mention and form subjects of separate articles. Razazah in practice belongs to the Karbala Qadha and is mentioned below in the list of Muqata'ahs, but nominally it is a separate Qadha. The chief feature of the Karbala district,—apart from the Euphrates river with which its connection is slight,—is the Husainlyah Canal, running from Musaiyib to Karbala town and beyond. The following is a list of the principal Muqata'ahs or agricultural tracts in the Qadha Tracts. Razazah. Salih (Karaid Muham mad). Salihlyah. Sharif (Bad'at). Shitah. Sulaiman (Abu). Sumanah (Bu). Tahln (Abu). Tuwairij. Wand. Zanit (Abu). There is also a tract called Jaruf, inhabited by the Janabiyin tribe, on the east bank of the Euphrates above Musaiyib town. Another tract known as Nasrlyah or Nasirlyah, occupied by the Jadi, Jahaish, Jarawinah and Qaidhah tribes, is situated further south on the same side between Musaiyib and the Hindiyah barrage ; it is the country surrounding the Khan-an-Nasriyah on the Baghdad-Hillah route. The characteristic tribes of the part of country adjoining the Husainiyah canal are the Al Bu Masri, Mas'ud and Yasar : those of the Musaiyib neighbourhood are the Janabiyin, Al Bu Mahaiyi and 'Uwaisat. The desert round Shifathah is occupied by nomads of the Khawadhir and Al Bu Shibil tribes. Population. —Karbala Town (50,000), Musaiyib (4,500), and Shifathah (8,000) being included, the fixed population of the Karbala Qadha is believed to amount to 80,000 souls. The great majority of these are Shi'ah Muhammadans; but Sunni Muhammadans numbef about 10,000 and there are about 300 Jews. Resources. —The rural population, including the inhabitants of Shifathah, are alto gether engaged in agricultural and pastoral occupations. Dates, wheat, barley, cotton, opium and tobacco are cultivated by them ; and their livestock include horses, cattle, buffaloes and sheep. The date palms of the Qadha are estimated at 750,000 trees, of which some 50,000 belong to the rich settlement of Shifathah. There is in this Qadha a remarkable salt-field which is said to yield about 500 tons English of salt every year.

KAKBALA TOWN— One of the chief to^-ns of'Iraq, renowned as the scene of the martyrdom, or rather massacre of Husain and his companions,—an event to which it oA\e - . alternative name' of Mashhad Husain and in virtue of which it has become one of the i i mg . nf ^ViT'nh nilffrimase • it is situated about oo miles south-south-^est of Baghdad City and about 25 miles west-north-west of Hillah Town Karbala is known also by the name of Ghadhariyah and by the old-fashioned appellation of Naina^ a. Site and buildings.— The town stands on the left bank of the Husainiyah canal, which circles Ground its northern and western sides. On the north, east and south it is surrounded by cultivated lands, date plantations and gardens of fruit trees , and its general shape and disposition cannot be observed from any point of view accessible to luropeans. On the west the Shamiyah or Syrian Desert approaches almost to the walls About 2 miles to the south-ea6t of Karbala begins the Hor-al-Husainiyah, a marsh formed by the Husainiyah canal and the Shatt-el-Hindiyah ; an embankment running north and south for a distance of 6,000 metres is supposed to prevent the ingress of the waters of the Hindiyah, but this work is at present m a rumous and inefficient state. • Karbala consists of an old town on the north, still walled on the east, north and west, but open on the south—the side on which the new town adjoins it; the old town is crowded and irregularly built, the new is well laid out, with a broad mam street running north and south, and is by comparison clean. A mile or more to the south of the new town the large mansion of a Panjabi Indian family is conspicuous, standing in its own grounds and known as Afzal Khan's Fort. The walls of the old town are of brick, between 20 and 30 feet high, with towers projecting at intervals as bastions; there are two tiers of loopholes, and on the inside is a banquette supported bv arches which affords standing room for the defenders of the upper tier. The perimeter of tlft walls is about 2 miles ; they are pierced by 5 gates and about 25 towers still remain ; but the whole work is now in bad repair, and the arches on the inner side serve chiefly as dormitories for vagabonds and as latrines. The bridges connected with the town are described in the article on the Husainiyah C The site of the town is level, but the ground is somewhat higher towards the north western comer. Inhabitants.—So close estimate of the population is possible, but it appears to amount to about 50,000 souls, not reckoning pilgrims and other visitors. At least three-fourths of the fixed population are Persians, and almost the whole of the remainder are Arabs. There are only about 100 Turks and 50 Jews, but Indians or persons of Indian extraction number about 1,200 souls, and there are a number of Baluchis. With the exception of a few hundred Sunnis, of the Jews already mentioned, and of about a dozen Christians, the people of Karabala are all Shi 'ah Muhammadans. The Persians who compose the bulk of the population are almost altogether Persian subjects, so also are the Baluchis ; but the rest are of Turkish nationality, except the Indians, who are nearly all British subjects, and about 30 Persian-speaking subjects of the Russian Empire. In all there are about 9,000 dwelling-houses ; but they are not sufficient and the extension of the town, although constant, does not keep pace with the growthKARPALA 1007 of the population. Drinking water is from the Husainlyah canal, or, in the months when it is dry, from some 20 or 25 wells, mostly sunk in its bed. Trade, manufactures, and resources. —Karbala is a place of considerable trade, the most valuable imports being piece-goods, sugar, petroleum, spices, coffee, tea, Persian carpets, and candles, almost entirely for local consumption ; while the leading exports are dates, consecrated articles—such as rosaries, praying-tablets, and inscribed shrouds- skins and hides, wool and tobacco. The bazaars are extensive and well-stocked, and attached to the main bazaar in the old town is a Qaisariyah or arcade, in which are about 20 good shops dealing in European and other wares. Filigree work and engraving upon mother-of-pearl are the only two arts ; but all the ordinary trades are carried on with success, and even mechanical professions, such aa watch making and photography, are exercised with a fair degree of skill The agricultural and garden produce of the environs is large, and the output of dates is on such a scale as to leave a large balance for exportation. Karbala is not, however, a good centre for the collection of ordinary supplies or transport: there are no mules, and camels can only be procured in autumn when Bedouins of the 'Anizah and Shammar tribes are in the vicinity. Administration. —Karbala is the chief town and the headquarters of the administra tion, both civil and military, of the Karbala Sanjaq in the Wilayat of Baghdad ; inter nally it is administered as a municipality. The Mutasarrif of the Sanjaq had his residence here. Under Turkish rule, a whole Tabur of Dhabitiyahs was supposed to be located at Karbala, rarely more than 100 of the force were present. There is a post office, and telegraphic connection is maintained with Baghdad and Basrah via Hillah : a branch line of telegraph also connects Karbala with Najaf. The interests of British subjects, both residents and pilgrims, are watched over by a native Vice-Consul, and the Persian Government also maintain at Karbala a paid Karpardaz or consular official of somewhat similar rank. Religious importance. —We may now mention the holy places which are the sole cause of the existence of a large Persian city on the verge of the Shamiyah Desert at a distance of nearly 150 miles from the nearest part of the Persian frontier. The historical events with which they are connected are related elsewhere : but for those events Karbala, which does not appear to have been a seat of pre-Islamic civilisation, might never have existed even as a petty town. The chief shrines within the town are the tombs of Husain and 'Abbas and the Khaimahgah ; in the country outside the walls are the tombs of 'Aun and Hurr. The shrine of Husain, called Bargah Hazrat Husain, stands in the old town tow'ards its western end. The interior is not accessible to Christians, but it is known to consist, in the first place, of a large enclosure called the Sahn or Outer Court; this enclosure has 7 entrances, the-xoaiaone surmounted by a clock-tower, and the enceinte wall is lined upon the inner inside by no less than 53 arched recesses forming rooms, some of which are of considerable site. In the midst of the Sahn stands the Haram or Sanctuary proper : it is a roofed building surmounted by a lofty dome of gilded tiles and its facade from either end of which shoots up a gilded minaret of great height, faces the main entrance of the Sahn. A tile-work minaret, larger than those of the Haram but not so magnificent, rises in the corner of the Sahn which is at the back of the Haram and behind its proper left; and near this corner is a small external Sahn adjoining the main Sahn to which it serves as an entrance. In the centre of the building, underneath the dome, lies the Imam Husain with his son 'Ali Akbar on one side of him. The tombs of both have an outer cover of steel lattice-work overlaid with silver and an inner one of carved wood ; both are of hexagonal shape. Behind a silver grating in one of the corners are the tombs of the 72 Shuhada or so-called martyrs, who died with Husain. The tomb of 'Abbas, half-brother of Husain, to the east of that of Husain and so nearer to the middle of the town, is similar but slightly smaller and has a dome of glazed brick only ; the minarets however are gilded. Each of these principal shrines has a treasury supposed to contain untold wealth, but, as the treasury of Husain was looted by the Wahhabis in 1801 and is still admitted ly the richer of the two, it does not seem that in either case the popular idea can be well founded. Such treasures as remain are, along with the other endowments, in charge of the Auqaf Department of the Turkish Government. Both buildings owe their goldkar-kas I 008 . . , . to the p ie ty of Nadir Shah.

KASHIRI— One of the more important tribes of the Arabs proper of the Hadhramaut. They live in, and cultivate the lands round, the towns. Many of them emigrate, and somo of them are very wealthy. The Bedouin reside amongst the Arabs, but are frequently at war with them, one of the results being that the tribal system in the Hadhramaut is very complex and difficult to grasp. The Kashiri tyranise over the Governor of Siwan, and are enemies to the Governor of Shi bam. One source of enmity between the Kashiri and the Yafa' is a debt which the Kashiri owe to them and will not pay. Their chief towns are Saiwan and Tarim. They are enemies of the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla. Their Amirs are Al-Mansur and Ghalib, 'Abdullah-al-Kashiri, who were invested by Canstantinople. The heir is Al- Muhassin.

They are said to own 200 buffaloes, 40O cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. They are attached to the Dailam sub-sec tion above. These are really a divi sion of the Sarkhah (Bani Lam), but at present they hold land under Shaikh Haidar of the Kathir, pay revenue through him, and are attached to the .Bait Karlm. At times they have lived under the pro tection of Haidar'a rival, Farhan Asad. They own 100 camels, 100 cattle and 4,000 sheep and goats. The Sa'abireh are at tached to the Dailam section above. They are stated to possess 100 buffaloes, 200 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. Besides the above, or perhaps included in them, are said to be a section called A1 Bu Nassi who live at Hiddeh or Haddameh on the Diz and have 300 rifles. The whole tribe may be estimated at 7,000 souls, of whom perhaps not more than- 1,000 have a fixed residence. The senior member of the Ma'alleh section formerly commanded the obedience of the whole tribe ; but at the present time two rival Shaikhs divide the Kathir between them. Shaikh Farhan Asad is followed by the Bait Karlm sub-section and part of the Dailam sub-section and has his headquarters at Dih Nau'; the village of Qal'eh Banut also belongs to his party and, outside of the Kathir, the Miyanab Arabs of 'Abdun Nabi on the Gargar, the A1 Bu Hamdan and Mahamid sections of the Bait Sa'ad, the Bait Sa'ad of Saiyid H isan on the Gargar, and indeed the Bait Sa'ad generally, are his adherents. The remainder and great majority of the Kathir upon the upper Diz, obey Shaikh Haidar,. to whom the village of Qal'eh 'Abdush Shah belongs. Both chiefs are recognised by the Persian Government, and the control of the country and tribesmen and the collection of revenue is left entirely in their hands ; the total annual revenue demanded from the two is said to be 4,725 Tumans, for the greater part of which Shaikh Haidar is responsible. Shaikh Farhan Asad cultivates the friendship of the Shaikh of Muhammareh and his sister is married to Karlm Khan, Faili Lur of 'Amleh Karlm Khan ; while Shaikh Haidar, whose daughter is married to a chief of the Sagwand Lurs and who has himself a Sagwand wife, is inclined to rely for support in difficulties on the Sagwands and indirectly on theKAT -KAT 1013 Wali of Puslit-i-Kuh. The relations of Shaikh Farhan Asad are with the Persian officials at Shushtar and those of Shaikh Haidar with the authorities at Dizful; consequently the tribe may be regarded as divided between the t wo districts of Northern ' Arabistan. It is a remarkable fact that of the Shaikhs—who are distantly related to one another—• neither really belongs to the Kathir tribe, but both are of Bait Sa'ad extraction. KATHlR— A small tribe which once belonged to the Bani Khalid tribe, but now associated with the Dhaflr {q. v.) of the right bank of the Euphrates about Samawah and Suq-ash- Shuyukh. kathir— A section of the Fadhul tribe (q. v.) of Najd j they are probably identical with the Kathran.

The population of Khabrah is about 3,000 souls and, though tradition represents it as originally a settlement of the Qahtan, the present inhabitants are described as of 'Anizah extraction : they are dull, ungracious and inhospitable. The majority live by agriculture, but many are camel-men.

The trunk valley of the western system appears to be Wadi-al-Goras which, below Ghadir-at-Tair, is called Wadi Tubj, whilst lower down still it has the name of Wadi Sulsila. The minor valleys which go to form Wadi-al-G6ras are, from south to north, as followsAth-Thammud, Al-Hasid, Silimah, and Zaidiyah. Wadi-al- Goras has the following tributaries, all of which are on the right bank:—Jallas (the upper part of the bed of which is called Al-Halhal), Al-Khutharannah, Asmainan, An- Naba, Sokhnah (or Gummarah), and Tithan. Of the eastern system the most important is Wadi Makhit, or Makhait, which trenda south-east and joins Wadi-ar-Rummah. Khaibar is a large oasis village (or group of villages) lying in harrah desert at an elevation of about 2,800 ft., considerably below the general harrah level which is about 6,000 ft. It lies some 70 miles N. of Al-Madinah, from which town it is controlled when not left to the tribes men of Wald Sulaiman, who own the land, or to Amir of Hail. The settlemet stands in the Wadi Zaidiyah, the largest of the Khaibar valleys, which lie close together in the harrah border, cutting into the larva field to the shallow clays beneath. The village is built under a long basalt crag, which stands isolated in the valley and bears the ancient citadel, Al-Husn. At the top of the rock is a walled platform, some two hundred paces by lynety, and on the side above the village is a covered well, protected by two great pyramids of brick, for its supply in time of danger. The village gates are shut at night. The water, supplied by many springs which rise between the upper basalt and the underlying clays, is tepid and sulphurous, but never brackish. The soil is heavily, charged with salt, which renders agriculture difficult ; but if the salt-crusts be removed for two or three seasons, the soil becomes capable of being sown, and every year it be comes sweeter. The villagers plough with a pair of small oxen, and they do not dress their fields ; they only work before noon. They irrigate with the public water once a week ; and the irrigation-rights of every plot of land are inscribed in the Shaikh's register of the village, the day and the hour being noted at which the owner may draw off the public water. Each household has its palm-plantations and its plots for sowing. The settled population is 2,500, mainly negroes and half-breeds ; the majority are of the Sudan type, but there are some Gallas among them. The Arabs avoid residence for fear of intermittent fever, but they are the owners of the land which is cultivated by the negro villagers as their permanent tenants ; and they enter the town at mid-summer togather their half of the date-harvest. The Bedouin owner must also remunerate his partner at a fixed rate for the planting of fresh palms and the repair of walls ; and, should he be unable to pay, the sum may be deducted from his share of the date-harvest. The negro tenants cannot purchase the land, the right to which is vested permanently with the tribe. But the villagers possess in their own right certain open lands which have never been planted with date-palms ; these lie towards Qasr an-Nabi, to the W. of Khaibar, and at Al-Hurdeh to the N. W. where there are many wells. Millet is grown for sale to the nomands ; but there is little ready money, and the younger villagers work for their food and without wages. The Khaibar dates, which form the staple produce of the oasis, are yellow and small and have a drug-like flavour, but they are not unwholesome. The chief traffic is with Al-Madinah, and many salesmen arrive from that town for the autumn fair, when they store their goods in hired houses which are left empty during the rest of the year. It is only under stress of famine, after a succession of rainless winters, that Bedouin ever seek refuge in the Khaibar valleys ; when they do so they have the right to plant half the land of their negro partners, who willingly lend them ploughs and tools. The oasia is far from healthy. The most pestilent season, called the hamlm, is between March and April, after the corn is carried ; the valley fever is then liable to carry oS an adult after a day or two's sickness. The following table shows the principal villages and hamlets of Harrat Khaibar. They are mean and poor, and fever and cholera are prevalent.KHA-KHA Maite-R^embte an African village, the majerity of the inhabitants being negroes who are known as Khaiabara.

KHALID (B ani) oe KHUWALID— The singular of the name is Khalidi. An Arab tribe of Eastern Arabia who had for merly a very wide range but are now little found outside the Sanjaq of Hasa ; they are still predominantly Bedouin, but appear to be in the process of settling down. Distribution. —The domains proper of the nomadic Bani Khalid are the northern portion of Habl down to the Habaiyah wells and the northern half of Biyadh ; when however, as at the present time, they are on good terms with the Ajman, they make use of the southern parts also of these two tracts. They also roam in Kuwait territory, sometimes travelling as far north as Kuwait Town to obtain supplies, but the Maqta' stream is their ordinary limit in this direction. * Summan, too, is visited by them. Per manent communities of Bani Khalid have for long existed on the islands of Musallamlyah, Jinnah and Tarut; and during the last few years two fixed villages of Bani Khalid have sprung up on the mainland, namely, Umm-as-Sahak in the Qatif Oasis and Qasr Al Subaih in Biyadh. The Bani Khalid are also represented at Jishshah and Kalabiyah in the Hasa Oasis and in the fixed villages of Wadi-al-Miyah ; and a few are permanently settled in Bahrain and some at Kuwait Town, while others pay regular annual visits to 'Anik in the Qatif Oasis, and may be regarded as partially settled there. In Najd part of the inhabitants of Malham in 'Aridh, of Zilfi in Sadair, of 'Anaizah, Qasaibah and possibly of Khabb and Qisai'ah in Qasim, and of Quwai'iyah in the south western desert are believed to be of Bani Khalid extraction ; those' at 'Anaizah bear a stronger resemblance to Bedouins than their fellow-citizens who are Bani Tamim. Religion, character and mode of life.—The Bani Khalid, unlike most of their neighbours, are Maliki and not Hanbali Sunnis: the difference is probably accounted for by their hereditary antagonism to the Wahhabis, from whom the Hanbalis are sometimes almost indistinguishable. The Bani Khalid are described as more dignified and formal in their intercourse with strangers than the other Bedow in tribes of Eastern Arabia; and among themselves the share of the women in the social life of the tribe is said to be more restricted. Their tents are larger than the ordinary Bedouin tent. The Bani Khalid are considered to be handsomer and of fairer complexion than the average Bedouin, and in general appear ance they resemble the settled Arab rather than the nomad. As a rule they are well dressed and ordinarily wear abas: they are said to have a characteristic way of bringing down their kerchiefs so as partially to conceal their faces. They have some slight peculiarities of dialect. In the 3 hot weather months the Bedouins of the Bani Khalid descend to the coast and tend the date plantations which they own at various places in its vicinity • during the rest of the year they roam in the interior. The principal occupations of the tribe as a whole are horse and cattle breeding and the cultivation of dates ; but those who are settled on the coast engage also iu pearl diving and in the sea-fisheriea.HMMM KHlLID 1029 Divisions ctrtd numbers. —The following is a table of the divisions and sub-divisions of the Bani Khalid together with such detailed information as it has been possible to procure regarding them :— i; theyj Section.

The settled Bani Khalid of Malham are stated to belong to a section called Qammaz those of Zilfi to sections styled Dushan and Hamran and those of Quwai'iyah to one known as 'Arafah. There is also a small nomodic section, the Kathlr, who are found to the north of Kawait among the Dhafir tribe. , . , , , j The fighting strength of the Bani Khalid, exclusive of divisions which have separated from them and become independent tribes, is thus about 4,000 men; and the total number of souls in the tribe, subject to a similar deduction, may be roughly estimated History and viesent political position. —Less than 150 years ago the Bani Khalid were the permanent tribe of Eastern Arabia, and the extent of their territory at that time is marked by the fact that caravans between Baghdad and Aleppo used to suffer from their depredations. Their power was first broken by the Wahhabis m or before 1795, and in 1830 they were obliged to surrender the sovereignty of the Hasa Uasis to the Wahhabi Amir. In 1874 the Turks attempted to govern the Hasa Sanjaq through one of the Bani Khalid chiefs, but the experiment was a failure. The Bani Khalid are on bad terms with the Mutair and the A1 Morrah, and the recent establishment of the village of Qasr Al Subaih was intended to facilitate the prosecution of hostilities against those tribes. With the Turks the Bani Khahd were in somewhat close relations, and the non-nomadic portion of the tribe for the most part used o pay them a regular Zakat; but the allowances disbursed by the Porte to the tribe as a wholeim KHA-MA exceeded the revenue which was recovered from the sedentary sections. The Shaikh of the Al Khalid section was styled Mudir of the island of Musallamiyah and received a monthly allowance of $30, which he shares (unofficially) with the Shaikh of the Al Baz'm • and the other headmen on the island were given annual presents o f . abo ut $50 each. The Shaikh of the Al Shahin was similarly called Mudir of Jinnah island, and he also received an allowance from the Turks of $30 per mensem, i he settled Bam Khalid of Qasr Al Subaih, however, considered themselves independent of the lurks ; and so apparently did the nomadic branches of the tribe unless when they were in the neighbourhood of Turkish posts.

Several hamlets appear scatterred about which are comprised m the general name Khalis- the largest is called As-Suq, or the market-place, near which the Hajj caravans encamp. A small rivulet, tepid like that in Wadi Fatimah, rises near the Suq and is collected on the outside of the, village in a small cistern, now ruined, and then waters the plain.

Jabal Khamis is parallel to Jabal Khadhar, the portion of Hajar which next adjoins it on the west; and Wadi Falaij, the main route from Sur to Ja'alan and Sharqiyah, descends to the coast between the two. The height of Jabal Khamis, which at 9 miles from the coast has an elevation of 2,845 feet, increases^ -,, r KHA-KHA 1037 and 2,0 own li annarentlv from north to south and attains 4,195 feet at a point about 2o miles from Sur ; 4 ir 5 miles however the north of this point it falls to a col with an elevation of only 2 ,340 feet above the sea. This pass, called Najd -al-'Ayun, is crossed by a route Pract^able for camels which on the one side leads down via Ain-al-Mashanfah (16 miles) tn Khnr al Jaramah (30 miles) and on the other falls to Wadi Fisao and passes by Wadi ^ St^al-M^harifah has shallow wells of indifferent water sufficient for 200 LmTandequal number ef men, and the route on whieh it hes crosses a number o drv^water-courses that run down from Jabal Khamls to the soutb-eastern coast of 'Oman. In Wadi Miiswa and Wadi Fisao, the valleys which begin respectively from the east and west sides of the pass and in their tributaries, are outcrops of coal which wwe scientifically examined in 1901.

KH AMISl Y AH— A larae village in the Euphrates valley, situated somo 6 miles to the southward o Sua ash Shuyukh and consisting of about 200 houses, with a bazar and a mosque w^s formerly^ Turkish military station, and possesses good and abundant water. r^Sbe^r^b ^br^oThe'drrt'^me 12 or U miles south from Sua al Sbuyukh and is connected with it by a Creek called the u ai lya , at present occupies a considerable area adjoining the town.

This canal has apparently long been unused and is sl ^ ed { ^P' h lt f S ^ C a having been taken by the Hutaibiyah already mentioned ^^ch issues forth nf roods about \ mile from Khamisiyah and branches out into the canals kho StS ttn^rro^wato^ng^rtS and southern gardens idea of building a new town where no town or permanent habitation ex i The whole area may therefore be taken as belonging to this family though■ . . .. .. ^ ■'-/ ■ ■ • - ■ I ll K HAM IS I YAH the date gardens in point of fact belong to others, to whom they were given by the Shaikh or his father to plant with a view to encouraging people to settle down permanently. Two of the gardens still belong to the Shaikh and are cultivated for him by Najadah tenants who pay him half the produce of the date crop, while the other gardens have been given over as above stated to Ibrahim (north side), Mutlaq al Sibbi (north side) and Ali (south side), all of them Najadah. These are self-cultivating owners and pay nothing to the Shaikh. In addition to dates, lucerne is grown under the palms, as aho a certain amount of wheat and barley (south side) and vegetables. On crops other than datea nothing is paid to the Shaikh by his tenants, who however keep him supplied with vegetables, etc., by way of occasional presents. It goes without saying that nothing has ever been paid on these gardens by way of revenue to the Turks or to us. 4. Salt. —The most interesting feature of Khamisiyah is its salt-pans which are worked throughout the summer and autumn but not during the rainy season. There are two main salt areas or mamlahas both on the southern side of the town, separated from each other by the date groves already mentioned. In each of these areas a number of wells (called Bir) are scooped out and the water found there in ladled out by the Maadan (mostly women), who work the pans, with instruments like largo ladles made of gourds and known as diliyah into runnels known as Saja from which it runs into beds which are called haudh and there stands for 24 hours by which time nothing remains of it but a thick white sediment of salt. This is then collected and is to all appearances excellent salt of considerable purity and snow white. The Shaikh as owner of the land takes a rent of Rs. 2-8-0 and one maund of salt per hir. There are said to be about 30 Abyar so the Shaikh's annual income from this source is Rs. 75 and 30 maunds of salt which is worth about Rs. 1-4-0 a maund. The total income is thus a about Rs. 110 only. The out-turn of each hir is said to be 20 maunds a year so the Maadan who pay such a small proportion in all say 3-20ths do very well. The salt is sold mainly in Khamisiyah and Suq-ash-Shuyukh and it is understooJ that the Nasiriyah contractor is also drawing on this supply which should be capable of unlimited exten sion. All the subsoil water in these parts is brackish but not all of it is capable of producing salt. 5. The Town. —The Shaikh's father was certainly a man of ideas to judge by the way the town was laid out. It is a rough square with great wide streets, a bazaar, a sif for giain and a square for the camels and other animals of the Bedouin visitors, who come from the desert to barter their livestock, ghi, etc., for rice and other necessaries of life. The sumptuous mosque was apparently the gift of Falih Pasha as-Sa'dun and its leaning tower which is a prominent land mark affords an excellent view of the town and its surroundings to Suq-ash-Shuyukh on the north, Tel-al-Lahm on the south-west and Tel-Jabbarah on the south-east, the last two beina until recently the residences of 'Ajaimi and his brother Thamir-as-Sa'dun respectively. Everywhere else is the desert on the one side and the endless reeds on the other. The town is, or rather is supposed to be, walled though the wall which should surround it is conspicuous by its absence in a very large portion of the perimeter Its absence is serious in view of the undoubted smuggling of piece-goods, etc., to the enemy of which Khamisiyah is an important centre and it must be admitted that this smuggling can not be effectually prevented until the wall is rebuilt and its exits guarded by military or other trustworthy guards during the hours of darkness. The wall should therefore be built up if the blockade is to be worked seriously. 6. lieienue.—tio far we have made no attempt to collect any revenue from this tract eitheronthedate-grov^ oron thesaH produce while no restrictions have been placed on the working of the salt pans. The Turks had apparently never thought it worth while to raise the question and the Shaikh has been left to his own devicls till now. He has certainly shewn himself worthy of his position. From the people to whom he has given land for cultivation he takes nothing—not even the Haqq al Hukumah W f V 01 h ^ OWn 1 he t t keS half the P roduce ' and n o more—the only point in respect ot which he exacts a royalty is salt but even here he is studiously moderate in his demands. Strictly speaking Government would be entitled to levy about Rs 200 per annum on the date groves and to take a royalty on each salt-well in work ng aAn alternative to closing them down with a view to making the salt monopoly more of a reality but I am generally of opinion that in view of the good work which the Shaikh and his people are doing for Government especially in connection wilh rSway itKHA-KHA 1039 would be impolitic to raise the question of Government's rights just now. The amount of revenue at stake is very small and except for the profits they make out of blockade running—the income of the inhabitants of Khamisiyah must be very small, though trade, not the soil, is their raison d'etre. We can therefore afford to waive the revenue question altogether till a later and more suitable date. In due course revenue will have to be assessed if only as a tangible sign of British domination but even then it may be found expedient to remit it in favour of the Shaikh. 7. The Future. —The future is certain to see a branch line to the town and possibly on to Suq or in the alternative the transplanting of Khamisiyah to Talh al Lahm. In any case the prosperity of the house of Khamis and its followers is assured and the wisdom of Sheikh Hamad's father justified who cut himself off from Suq al Shuyukh to be a link between the desert and the sown in the season of floods. Whether the desert will in due course become a granary is a matter which depends on the irrigation and river control questions. Neither of them should be incapable of a satisfactory solution. 8. The Khamis family —-Is said to have migrated from Najd to the Suq-ash-Shuyukh region attracted by prospects of trade and agriculture less than 40 years ago and the foundation of Khamisiyah dates back 27 years.

In passing between Sharjah and Khan the Sharjah creek must be crossed or a detour made so as to pass between it and the Khan creek. The land in shore of the village is for some dis tance low and swampy. Khan consists of about 200 houses, the majority of stone set in gypsum mortar or mud, the rest huts of date branches. The inhabitants, who belong to the Al EuMahair. Mazari, and Manasir tribes, are pearl divers and fishermen, owning about 74 pearl boats^but no other sea-going vessels.

It is understood to extend about 40 miles from north to south and the same from east to west. Physical diaractenstics.—KhQx] is a sandy plain without any remarkable physical features. The Sahabah tract on the north-east is closely connected with Kharj, but should probably be regarded as distinct. On the east side Kharj passes into a sandy and at times stony country called Maraghah ; on the south it shades off into a bare sandy desert known as Dahi; on the west it is divided from Hautah by Saut, a stretch of low flat country containing tamarisk and acacia trees. The drainage of the Hautah and Hariq districts is brought to Dilam in Kharj by a hollow (Wadi Braik) which has its beginning at Hautah town, or even further away, to the west-south-west; and the Sha'ib 'Alaiyah reaches from the eastern face of Jabal 'Alaiyah to the village of Yamamah in Kharj ; on the other hand Wadi Hanifah, though it approaches the district from the north, is dissipated, in Sahabah and does not enter Kharj. There is one flowing stream in the district, that of Farzan, which rises on the west side of the Kharj villages and after ma kin g its way across some miles of sandy country is utilised for the irriga tion of crops. The air of Kharj is described as healthy and refreshing.* Topography, population and resources. —The following table contains some particulars of the principal places in Kharj— Katne. 'Adhar .&lt; Balaisah Position, On the west or south west side of Dilam, the date groves of the two places being almost conti nuous. A short distance to the south-west of 'Adhar. Nature. A village of about 40 houses, viz., 20 of Bani Tamim, 10 of 'Aid and 10 of in ferior tribes. Formerly a village, now deserted. Remark?, There is considerable cultivation of dates and wheat; live stock are estimated at 50 camels, 20 donkeys and 40 cattle. The wells are 6 fathoms deep. There is not even cultivation now at this place. •So far as Is known Kharj has not yet been visited by any European travejler.SC2 KHARJ 1045 Name. Position. Nature. Remarks.

See article Dilam. Faraijah Not far from Dilam, direction south-west. An abandoned Qasr There are wells by means of which some cultivation is carried on in favour able years by agri culturists from ' Dilam. Farjan ('Ain) To the west of Zamai- jah. A spring which for merly sent out a stream, but now nearly dry. This spring belonged originally to the Farjan sub-dvision of the Dawasir, but it was seized by the Wahhabi Amir after the with drawal of the Egyp tians from Najd. Farzan ('AirO Rises about 8 miles west of Dilam. A flowing stream, said to be the pro perty of the Wah- habi Amir. This rivulet loses much of its volume on its way through sandy ground to Dilam. Its water is used for all crops by the cultivators of Dilam, and the people of Sulaimiyah and Yamamah are able to irrigate their corn fields from it, but it does not reach their date groves. The inhabit ants of NaVjan de rive no benefit from it. Muhammadi About 3 miles north of the date groves of Dilam. A stretch of culti vated ground. There was a Qasr here, but it is now ruined and deserted.,1: A mile or two or per haps more to the west of Yamamah. Sulaimiyah or Sala miyah. About 8 miles east by north of Dilam. Nature. A village of 25 houses nearly all of inferior tribes but one or two of Bani Tamim. A place with a few houses occupied by servants of Ibn Sa 'ud. About 50 horses of the Wah- habi Amir are kept here on account of the lucerne which is good. A village of about 100 houses, viz., 30 of 'Aid, 20 of Bani Tamim, 10 of Dawasir, 10 of Sahul, and 40 of inferior tribes. Yamamah 1 or 2 miles north (or, according to another account, south) of Sulaimiyah. A village of about 130 houses, viz., 30 of 'Aid, 20 of Sabai,' 15 of Dawasir, 15 of Sahul, and 50 of inferior tribes. Remarks. The usual crops of the district are grown and there are the ordinary live stock. There are no dates, but some ordinary cultivation is carried on. Water is said to be derived from the Farzan stream. According to one account the place is now dried up and forsaken. There is the usual cultivation, fairly extensive here, of both dates and cereals. Livestock are estimated at 200 camels, 50 donkeys, and 300 cattle, besides sheep and goats, but no horses. This village benefits to some ex tent by the Farzan stream and its own wells are only 6 fathoms deep. The chief Shaikh is of the 'Aid tribe. There are large date pantations, and the usual fruits, cereals, melons and lucerne are grown. Live stock are said to amount to 300 camels, 80 donkeys and 200 cattle, ex clusive of sheep and goats, but there are no horses.

As at Sulaimlyah, the headman of the village belongs to the 'Aid tribe. Zamaijah Some miles to the south-west of Dilam. A small settlement of about 10 houses. The inhabitants are slaves belonging to Dawasir residents of the Aflaj dis trict. Apparently the settled population of the Kharj district, among whom the 'Aid are the most characteristic tribe, amount to some 3,000 persons only, and half of them inhabit Dilam town ; they are said to be of a milder disposition than the people of 'Aridh. Their houses are of sun-dried brick and mud with a coating of cement, which gives them a white appearance. The Bedouins of the district, who outnumber the townsmen and villagers and have been placed at 8,000 souls, are said to be chiefly 'Ajman of the 'Arjah and Al Shamir sections, Sabai', 'Ataibah, and Dawasir of the J Ju'aid section; they are well armed with breeach-loading rifles. In point of fertility Kharj ranks high among the districts of Southern Najd. The water level is only 6 to 8 fathoms below the surface, and dates and cereals are produced in large quantities ; among fruits other than dates are grapes, lemons, pomegranates, and figs ; lucerne and melons are also included among the products of Kharj. Kharj ia said to contain running streams and large date plantations.— {Leachman.) Domestic animals are camels, donkeys, horned cattle, and sheep and goats ; but horses, unless belonging to Ibn Sa 'ud or the Bedouins, are hardly seen in the district. Such trade as exists is concentrated in Dilam town. Communications. —The ordinary route from Kharj to Hasa leaves the district at Yamamah and, skirting the Sahabah tract which is on the right hand, falls into the Riyadh-Hofuf route at Tarabi or Abu Jifan. The distance from Yamamah to Abu Jifan is stated at 3 days by caravan. Administration. —As explained in the article on Dilam, the Wahhabi Amir at present governs Kharj through an official without local connections who is stationed at Dilam and occupies a fort within the walls. Taxes are collected from the nomadic as well as from the sedentary population of the district. KHARJAH— A group of knolls close to the Batin depression (g.v.), in north-eastern Arabia. KHARKHARAH— A tract in the Diwaniyah Qadha {q.v.) in 'Iraq. KHARMAH— A tract in the Sanjaq of Hasa immediately to the south of the oasis of the same name ; it is bounded on the north by the oasis, on the west by Ghuwar, and on the other two sides by Jafurah. The length of Kharmah from north to south is about 40 miles, and it tapers from about 30 miles in breadth at its northern end to about 15 at its southern extremity ; the loss of breadth appears to be chiefly upon the east side. Jabal Arba' is situated oa the border between this tract and the Hasa Oasis.im KHA-KHA The principal feature of Kharmah is a hill named Jabal Kharmah, which is situated in the middle of the tract at about 30 miles from its northern end. The soil of Kharmah is a light red sand and the general level is higher than that of the Hasa Oasis. Water is found in a few places only ; but depressions contain Hamdh, Rimth and Thanum upon which 'Ajman and Al Morrah Bedouins pasture their flocks and herds. The following are the chief wells of Kharmah:— Name, 'Awaisah Position and remarks. Khuwainah Mutawi Shajah Zarnuqah On the west side of Jabal Kharmah, about 4 miles from it.

The trade of Wadi Bani Kharus is partly with Barkah and partly with Masna ah. KHASAB— , u ^ - In English formerly known as ' Kassaab.' A small town on the coast of the Oman Sultanate, the capital of the Bani Haidlyah section of the Shihuh tribe, situated o n south side of a great bay which forms the approach to Khor-ash-Sham on the wes coast of the Ruiis-al-Jibal district. It stands upon a sandy beach nearly a mile 1 g and is surrounded by date groves, which extend some distance up a wide valley, called Sal'alah, behind the town ; these plantations belong partly to Shihuh of other places ^ the Ruus-al-Jibal district. At the back of the groves there is some cultivation of wheat and vegetables. Landing at Khasab is difficult at low water even from ^1 toats. The only defences are a fort in the centre of the date plantations and twoorth u towers near the sea. Good fresh water is obtained from wells 30 to 60 f eet deep, and, being abundant, it is applied to irrigation: wood, cattle and vegetables are obtaii a . The town consists of about 300 houses of Shihuh, besides which there is a bazaarcrf lO shops. The fixed inhabitants nearly all belong to the Bam Hadiyah section of the SI _ , but a few are of the Bani Shatair section: of the former about 300 persons are of the Bayadir or field labourer class. There is also a floating population, especially m the date season, when people flock in from the country round and from Hanjam Sharjah and Dibai and camp in mat huts which they erect on the road level m fro , nt ^ , th ®; 0 1 J n ;. ah The inhabitants own six sea-going boats whic i run to Dibai, Lingeh and coast; they have no pearl-boats of their own, but some of them go o p in boats belonging to Dibai.

The island contains 2 villages, of which the larger is called Umm-al-Khasasif; this one is situated on the south shore of the island about 1 mile from the western end and is inhabited by about 2,000 souls of the so-called Shaikh Hasan and other tribes. Umm- al-Khasaslf village is well built and is laid out in 4 broad parallel streets ; its resources are estimated at 20,000 date palms, 400 cattle, 300 sheep and goats, 10 horses and 20 donkeys. On the north side of the island near its eastern end is a smaller village known as Umm-ar-Rasas ; it is said to possess 250 inhabitants of the so-styled Shaikh Hasan tribe, who own 7,000 date trees, 30 cattle, 30 sheep and goats and 4 horses. In the channel between Umm-al-Khasaslf island and the right bank of the river lie two smaller islands ; the upper of these, Rumhailah, ((?. v.) is between the western end of L mm-al-Khasasif and the shore of BaljanTyah and about ^ of a mile west-south-west of Umm-al- Khasaslf village ; while the other, known as Umm-al-Yababi, {q .v.) is situated between the central part of the main island and the coast of the Faiyadhi tract. The main island of Umm-al-Khasasif is owned partly by the Shaikh of Muhammerah and partly by the family of the Naqib of Basrah.

Abul Khasib is said to have been named after a freedom of the KhalTfah Mansur: in the middle of the 9th century of the Christian era it was a stronghold of the Zanj rebels. Abul Khasib is practically one with Bab Sultan, which lies to the east-south-east; there are some fifteen small villages in the locality so close to one another that it is difficult to define their proper boundaries. The inhabit ants number about 12,000 souls and belong to various tribes including Bani Malik (Malich) of the Bani Nahd section. At Bab Sonaman, opposite to Bab Sultan, there is a large house and the bridge between them can be raised to allow mahailahs or tugs to pass underneath. The other bridges are high enough for launches. The agricultural resources of the place are estimated at 400,000 date palms and livestock at 1,000 cattle, 3,000 sheep and goats,- besides a good many horses and donkeys, and a few camels. Each quarter of the town contains a large bazaar in which European goods are exposed for sale. Abul Khasib is a great centre of activity in the date season and the annual meeting between the date growers and exporters, held early in September to fix the prices for the season, sometimes takes place here. Under Turkish rule the town was the seat of a Mudir, being the chef-lieu of the Abul Khasib Nahiyah in the qadha of Basrah, and the Turks had a police post and customs house at the entrance to the Abul Khasib creek. The result was that much smuggling of goods to and from Persia was carried on here. Harun Yaman's house is about a quarter of a mile south-south-west of Bab Sonaman. —{Murphy).

KHAZl'II^- A considerable Arab tribe in 'Iraq: their country stretches approximately from Kufah to Samawah through the intervening marshes and includes a portion of the adjoining Shamiyah Desert: the settled members of the tribe are chiefly in the Qadha of Samawah. The Khaza'il are all Shi'ahs and are divided into Mu'allim, Al Bu Hasan and Lamlum ; and one of their smaller sections is known as the Bani 'Aridh. They are a strong and warlike body but not naturally pugnacious. Those who inhabit the desert are horsemen and are well-mounted: those on the rivers and marshes depend for loco motion, both in peace and war, upon their mashhufs or canoes. The agricultural parts of the tribe cultivate rice, barley and wheat; sheep horses and camels also are bred by the Khaza'il, and a considerable number of them are carriers and camel-dealers. A large proportion even of the agricultural sections follow the desert life between January and June. The Khaza'il levy khuwwah from the 'Anizah anl northern Shammar, towards whom they are not well disposed, when camping in their territory. The following is a conspectus of the tribe :— Shall al, al Salman al Dhahir On the Shatt Hamidiyah round Umm al Ba'rur extending south almost to Shinafiyah in the Bahr Shinafiyah.

Their fellahin were Ma'dan. Sixteen years ago the Turks seized their properties and con verted them Into Saniyah putting in the Fallah as cultivators. Fara'un, father of Mubdair, was placed In charge. The Shatt Hillah flowed for 2 years after the construction of the Hindivah dam, but at the beginning of this month (end September 1916) one of the arches of the dam broke and from Hillah down-stream there is now no water but well water. The Turks have undertaken to repair the dam. If they fail to do so Sa'dun states that the tribes will break into active revolt. Muhammad Daghistani came to them at the beginning of the war, distributed money and asked for 2,000 horses, but the Khazail refused to comaly with this request.

A consider able number live in the coast towns of Trucial 'Oman and Persia. The entire Khojah community of Matrah reside in a large fort or enclosed quarter upon the sea beach ; security from attack by the Arabs and privacy for their women are the principal motives of this arrangement, and, except menials, the only non -Khojahs admitted to the enlosure are the British officials at Masqat, whom they regard as their natural protectors. The Khojahs of Matrah marry, for the most part, among themselves. Only about 10 families of those at Matrah are now adherents of the Agha Khan of Bombay ; the remainder have been converted to Thain ' Ashari Shi'ism, but preserve to some extent their old social usages and customs. The majority of the Matrah Khojahs are petty merchants and shopkeepers dealing in piece-goods, spices, etc. Only about 12 of them do business on a large scale, but there are seven or eight others who some times receive small consignments of goods on their own account. The business of the large Khojah merchants at Matrah consists in the importation of rice from Calcutta and of piece-goods, oil and drugs from Bombay, and in the exporta tion to India of dates, both wet and dry, and of a small quantity of dried fish (Matut). Some land in the Masqat District has been acquired by Khojahs, particularly at Birain, at Darsait near Matrah, and at Ghallah in Wadi Boshar. The Matrah Khojahs are mostly of Sindi or Kachi extraction, but very few of them now have homes in India, and of 250 male adults only about 120 are British subjects, those, namely, whose ancestors immigrated after the British conquest of Sind. Of 41 families of Khojahs in other parts of the'Oman Sultanate except Gwadar, 29 are under British protection and 12 are Arab subjects; those of Gwadar, are comparatively recent im migrants and all claim British nationality. In the ports of Persia and Trucial 'Oman the Khojahs are all regarded as British subjects. In the Sultanate of 'Oman the Khojahs are known to the Arabs as Lawatiyahf and in the Persian Gulf they are called Lutiyan; the singular in either case is Latiyah. They are also commonly spoken of as Haidarabadis.

Their chief occupation is pearl diving, but those of Qatar also own camels, sheep, donkeys and cattle, with which they retire into the interior of the peninsula in the cold weather ; in summer they leave their animals to the care of local Bedouins and betake themselves to the pearl fisheries. In religion the Kiblsah are Maliki Sunnis. The tribe once lived mostly at Dohah, but they were compelled by a difficulty with the 'Amamarah to remove to Khuwair Hassan. Later they took part with the Na'im in the foundation of Zubarah, but after a time they return ed to Khuwair Hassan, which is still their headquarters.

KIDUR— A village in Hadhramaut, southern Arabia; it is situated in Ghail Habban at a distance of 17 or 18 miles eastwards of Yashbum, and constitutes a halting place on the route between that town and Balhaf. Good water is to be had at Kidur. KIFL— A considerable village in 'Iraq, situated on the left bank of the Shatt-al- Hindiyah: it lies about 18 miles south-south-west of Hillah Town and 16 or 17 miles north by east of the town of Najaf. 1 Kifl is surrounded on 3 sides by creeks from the river, which are not often more than 4 or 5 feet deep; but they extend in some cases for a number of miles. When the Hindiyah rises in winter the village is surrounded by floods ; it is then connected with the mainland only by a winding embankment about 3 feet broad and j of a mile long. There are a good many date trees in the immediate neighbourhood. Kifl consists of about 70 houses of masonry and of a much larger number of poor constructions in mud and matting. The population of the place is estimated at nearly 2,000 souls, of whom about 200 are Jews and the remainder Arabs. The village is filthy and the people are poor. There are a couple of small and inferior Khans at Kifl: the better of the two is double-storeyed and was built by a private individual for the gratuitous accommodation of pilgrims passing by water between the towns of Karbala and Najaf. The most striking architectural object at Kiti, however, is a solitary minaret, believed to have formed part of a mosque which has now disappeared ; it affords an ex cellent landmark to all the country side, becoming visible on the way to Kifl a few miles after leaving Najaf Town, but it is now in an insecure state and its days of usefulness appear to be numbered. The sole claim of Kifl to importance is founded on its possession of the reputed tomb of Hizqil or Ezekiel; this shrine stands in the middle of the village, in a courtyard sur- ' rounded by a wall, the cells and recesses on the inner side of which are the dwelling place of most of the Jews of Kifl. The building is extremely simple and at present it is in a bad state of repair. The supposed coffin of the prophet, covered with common cloth, is about 12 feet in length by 6 feet wide and 5 feet deep; it is kept in a room which is 36 feet long and 20 feet wide and has a domed roof. The walls of the room are ornament ed with pieces of inferior mirror glass and other bright coloured objects,—decorations attributed to the munificence of a Jewish merchant of Bombay, by whom the tomb is said to have been restored about 65 years ago. Jewish pilgrimages are made to this shrine, especially at the time of Pentecost; and many Jewish corpses are sent to Kifl from a distance for internment. A family of Muhammadan Arabs are the custodians of the tomb and receive whatever is paid by pilgrims. There is some cultivation around Kifl,—chiefly on the further side of the Shatt-al- Hindlyah, which is here about 200 yards broad. Trade, chiefly with Hillah Town and Tawairlj, is unimportant; but there is a bazaar about 150 yards long by 10 yards wide. Kifl was the headquarters of a Nahiyah in the Qadhaof Hindiyah and the seat of a Mudlr who has a few Dhabitlyahs under his orders. KIFRI— Or Sa!ahlyah ; a town in 'Iraq, situated on the main Baghdad-Mosul route at a distance of 117 miles north-north-eastward of Baghdad. It consists of about 800 houses, giving a population of 4,000 souls. Kifri is connected by telegraph with Baghdad and Mosul.KIH-KIL 106? Genera? Description*—Tan town lies in a plain at the mouth of a gorge in a low nd g (300-400 feet high) to the north, through which the Chechepan Su (Kifri Su) emerges. The river on the right bank of which Kifri stands, is unbndged. A cultivated treeless plain extends for a few miles to the south and east for about 10 miles to north-west. The hill of Bawa Shah Suwar, to the north of Kifri, commands an excellent view of the town. There are a shrine and a cemetery on it. The town is surrounded by a mu w in poor repair. The houses are of stone and mud, with flat roofs ; a few on the sout are built of lime and gypsum from the hills close hy. There m a stoue Khau on the north, outside the town, and a new Khan on the east with upper rooms. It is 40-55 yards, with stabling for 150 horses, and of rough stone and cement. There is another Khan, single-storeyed, 30 yards square, and stabling for 50 horses. n-w Supplies and commerce,— There is a bazaar containing about 80 shops with a fair amount of supplies (flour, dates, dried fruits). The neighbourhood is said to produce good wheat, and near the town are gardens with date and fruit trees Sheep andgoats are plentiful in normal times. The water, which comes from the Kifn bu east of the town, is abundant and good. There is very good grazing m the neighbourhood of the town. Fuel is plentiful. In normal times it was estimated that 400 horses mules might be obtained here. . r + v The place is described as depending partly on the export 0 ^ w00 ^ p ^ t 1 y sale of goods imported from Baghdad, partly on agriculture. The ^ asa Jf lie in the low hills east of the town, the nearest being about f hour fro m the town newest workings apparently lie at a distance of 1 or 2 miles. e coa is n quality that it will not burn in an ordinary grate. It is said that three workmen ca excavate about 30 cwt. or 20 donkey-loads daily, and the coal is sold in Kiln a i Baii Piastres per donkey -load {'Hd. aewt.). r a Inhabitants.—The inhabitants are mostly Kurds, though there are a few Arabs a Jews. The town lies in the country of the Jaf Kurds, whose power recently been much reduced by the Turkish Government, though they are stiU a co^^erable ^. They inhabit both sides of the frontier and live a semi-nomadic hfe, moving between the hills and the plains. The Turkish Jaf claim that, though they are the less numer section, they number 3,000 mounted men: this is probably an exaggeration. ^ In the country towards Khaniqin live the Bajalan Kurds ( 1 n ( is) ant ■ bad Kurds (270 riders). The Hamawand Kurds at least as late as 1910 were a ser danger on the roads in the neighbourhood, and in spite of measure taken against them in recent years may possibly still cause trouble. , , , i rw Administration.—The Turkish Governn ent was represented here by a Qaimmaqam, and in those days there was a post of inf. ntry mounted on mules.

KIRKUK.— A town in 'Iraq, situated on the main route between Baghdad and Mosul at a distance of 187J miles northward of the former city. It is said to contain 4,000 houses, giving a population of 20,000 souls. A stone bridge of 15 arches spans the mountain torrent called Hasa Su, or Kirkuk Chai from Kirkuk to Qaryat Mahallah. There are post and Telegraph offices General description.—The town lies on the bank of the Hasa Su, with the suburb of Qaryat Mahallah opposite it at the west end of the bridge. In this suburb are the sarai, military barracks, military hospital, post and telegraph office, a school, and the residences of many officials. On the west, north, and north-east the low hills stand close round the town, hiding it from view in these directions until one is near it. At the northern end the citadel stands on a large flat-topped mound, 130 feet in height, with the quarter near the Mosque of 'Ali at its base. The Chaldean commu- mty has a new cathedral built by the French Roman Catholic mission. The town contains two arched bazaars and several Khans, as well as public baths which are report ed to be very bad. Owing to the sheltered position of the town, the climate is excessive ly hot and not very healthy in summer. Supplies and Commerce.—The town is said to contain apparently about 500 shops, but the local authorities claim that there are upwards of 1,800. Wheat, barley, a little nee, beans, melons, cucumbers, and a few grapes are grown in the country round Kirkuk. There are several flour-mills on the bank of the river. The inhabitants were reported in 1903 to own 30,000 sheep in the pastures near the town ; but the livestock of the district may have been dln ; ini ^ed owing to the constant raids of the Hamawand between the years 190b and 1909. Water can be obtained after rain or the melting of the snow from the Hasa Su but there is generally little or no water in the river bed, and most of the rather scanty supply comes from wells. There are oil springs at Baba 01 the t0Wn - ^ 18 ^ th » »' A-b Some cotton is grown in this region, and the ehief exports of the place arc oil, wool, gall-nuts, wheat, barley, fruit, gum, and a little wine.

There are also Armenians, Chaldaeans, Syrians, and numerous Jews, who are said to own 200 houses out of 4,000, An equal number of houses is said to be inhabited by the Christians of various sects. Arabic and Kurdish are spoken indifferently in the bazaars, and Turkish is understood by most. The town itself has been strongly held by the Turkish Government, which has main tained fair order within the walls. The Sunni element is probably considerably stronger than the Shi'ah. There is said to be a fanatical population in the quarter round the Mosque of Ali to the north of the town ; but the Moslems of Kirkuk have been given a good character for honesty and generosity, at any rate in their dealings among themselves. They are said to be more interested in local than imperial politics. Administration and Authorities. —Kirkuk and the surrounding country is adminis tered by Mutasarrif under the Wali of Mosul. In peace time it was the head-quarters of the 12th divisions of the 6th (Baghdad) corps. The ordinary garrison was a batta lion of infantry and a large detachment of infantry mounted on mules.

The Brothers (often called by the older navigators The Sisters) lie between 'Abd-al-Kauri and Soqotrah. Samhah is 6| miles long and 3 miles broad. It has rocky shores and rises in a table-shaped mountain to 2,440 feet. As in 'Abd-al- Kauri ambergris is found on its shores and turtles abound. There is running water there all the year.

KUFAH— t A town in Turkish 'Iraq ; it stands on the right bank of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah at a distancl of 6 miles eastwards, by road, from Najaf Town. The original Kufah, founded about 638 A. D., was in early Islamic times among the most famous of cities, and under the 'Omaivids shared with Basrah the honour of being one of the Iraqan, that is, one of the twin capitals of 'Iraq ; but it subsequently declined and disapi^ared - the mo cm town is not more than 20 years old. The name is said to mean the (city of) reed ^The ancient Persian city of Hirah probably stood 2 or 3 miles to the south of Kufah, and the battle of Qadislyah, which in 635 A. D. gave the province of Iraq to the rising Muhammadan power, appears to have been fought at a place m the desert about 15 miba west of Kufah ; this Qadislyah is not to be confounded with the place ot the a name on the Tigris above Baghdad. In 'Abbasid times the Hajj route from Baghdad Kufah the Hindiyah stream is 150 yards broad and flow® deepest in the neighbourhood of the right bank, where, at the present time about 6 feet of^ water may be found in midwinter. At this place the Hindiyah is spanned by a bridge of 16 boats, each of which is 30 feet long, 10 feet wrde and 4 fee eep, ie roadwav is 8 feet wide, and there is a handrail about 3 feet high on each side from end told 5 This bridge is now in bad repair. There is a small island 200 yards above and another 350 yards below the bridge ; these are both wooded, and either ^ould ox good eover or support to a bridging party. Quarter of a mile above the bridge the H r^«dT^te^--MfaT d eonsists of about COO 1,ous f • of ^ mortar, and 100 occupied shops ; its frontage on the river is 500 to_ 600 yards, ihe whole town is upon the western bank, but there is one private Khan on the 0 PPOs side about 50 yards above the bridge. The present population of Kufah is about 3,000 souls of whom one -fourth may be Persians (including a few Persiamsed Baluchis) wh le the remainder are Shi'ah Arabs ; but this estimate does not include residents of iNajaf Town who have houses or offices at Kufah and visit them often for pleasure or business. itesourc&amp;s. —Kufah, always the port of Najaf, is now a general entrepot of trade an d the distributing centre, for a wide tract of country, of goods brought by water from Basrah Town.

By far the more important of these is the great Kufah mosque, the scene of the assassination of 'Ali in 661 A. D. by 'Abdur Rahman-bin-Muljam ; it is situated about li miles from the present Kufah, upon the way to Najaf. Externally this building resembles a fortified enclosure; for it has no dome and from the well surrounding it, which is 30 feet high, small semi-circular bastions 10 feet in diameter project at intervals of 50 feet. Inside, the mosque is like a caravansarai; the courtyard, which is 128 paces long and 104 paces wide, is surrounded on three sides by the cubicles usual in Khans; but behind these cubicles, instead of the usual stables, are little rooms with doors, 63 in number and equally divided among the 3 sides. There are also 9 maqdms or sarddbs in the centre of the enclosure; they are named after Noah, Zain-al- 'Abidin, 'Ali and others, who used, it is said, to retire to them for meditation. On the fourth side of the courtyard, that towards Makkah, is the mosque proper; and here, enclosed by iron gratings, is a space about 4 yards square paved with blue tiles to show where 'Ali fell. It may be noted that from early times there have been some Muhammadan authorities who have maintained that 'Ali is buried at Kufah, not at Najaf. The mosque is adjoined by 2 other well-built brick enclosures; one of these, on the east side, has a wall about 20 feet high and contains, besides a few huts, the tombs of Muslim-bin-'Aqil and Hani-bin-Amwah, which are both objects of veneration. To the north of the mosque outside it, are 2 or 3 small Khans. Many pious mullas'oi Najaf are in the habit of spending a night of each week in the old mosque at Kufah for quiet devotion. The other sacred place is the Maqam Yunas near the bank of the Hindiyah at the upper end of the present town. It appears to be doubtful whether this shrine is intended to commemorate the prophet Jonah or some other of the name. The style of Arabic writing known as Kufic had its origin here.

Ther^' is no route by land from Kamzar to any other place. Kumzar consists of about 600 low stone houses of Shihuh of the Bani Shatair section : there are two large whitewashed mosques. The people are fishermen and have no cultivation of any sort; they own 4.0 or 50 fishing-boats and 5 sea-going boats that run to Qishm, Dibai and Masqat Town with cargoes of salt, fish and shark- fins. Small quantities of dried and salted fish are exported also to Kuwait and Basrah. The Kumzaris have no pearl-boats of their own, but a few of them go to the banks on Sharjah and Dibai vessels. In the date season all but a very few persons migrate, mostly to Khasab and Dibah; the women go to the date harvest there or elsewhere, the men to the date harvest or the pearl fishery, and the 3 or 4 individuals who remain take charge of the flocks of the absentees.

KURIA MURIA* ISLANDS— , ^ , This group of islands lies 25 miles off the south-eastern Coast of jOman between Ras Sharbatat and Ras Nus and is consequently a little to the east of Dhufar. The origin of the English name ' Kuria Muria'' is unexplained ; the Arabs call the islands Jazair Bin-Ghalfan after a Mahra family who once seized them and in 1835 still claimed the group as their property. The Kuria Murias are 5 in number and form a chain running for 50 miles due east and west. They are of granite and stand upon a granitic ledge, with very deep water immediately outside, which extends hence under the sea to Ras Nus and from there by land to Murbat, where it ends. During the north-east monsoon the islands are exposed to winds blowing from all points of the compass. The north wind sometimes lowers the temperature as much as 20° E. bringing it down to 50° and causing severe sickness. Hallaniyah, the largest and central island of the group, is the only one inhabited : the people are reported to speak a dialect closely allied to that current in the neighbourhood of Murbat and resembling Mahri. The islands, in order from east to west, are:— Jilliyah Position. 10 miles east of Hallaniyah. Dimensions and physical characteristics. Oharzaut or Rodon- do. Eallanlyah 7 miles north-east of Hallaniyah. 48 miles east-north east of Ras Nus. About i mile square. It consists of por phyriti'* syenite and dark granite ; the highest pf-int is 500 feet. Hardly more than a large rock, 200 feet high, of reddish granite. The largest of the islands, about 7| miles long from east to west by 3| broad from nr&gt;rth to south. It con sists of granite with dark veins, and the hills in the centre form a cluster of spires one of which reaches a height of 1,503 feet. Remarks. There is no fresh water. There are numerous gannets; the only other living creatures are rats, mice, snakes, scor- jions and centi pedes. Some fine sponges are obtain able in from 5 to 7 fathoms of water. Nil. Water is abundant but all slightly brack ish. There are a few tamarisk trees and at the east end a little grass. The na tural fauna are wild goats, whip-snakes, scorpions and centi pedes. The human inhabitants number ed 23 in 1835 and 36 including children. b authorities on thi3 group are mentioned in the article on the 'Omftn Sultanate (footnote). The Chhartr~ c 5 ?

The second largest island of the group, 3 miles long by 2 broad. It is of red and grey granite with dark strata interposed and reaches a height of 1,310 feet. About a mile square and mostly com posed of reddish granite ; the high est point is 500 feet. Remarks. in 1883. Their race is uncertain; nomi nally they are Mu- hammadans. They keep goats and fish but have no boats and hardly ever visit the mainland. Their houses are mere semi-circular walls of loose stones and are roofed with sticks, fish-bones and sea weed. When Hal- laniyah was last vi sited in 1901 it was found deserted. Their is some scanty grass and a quickly filling but brackish well. The island is now uninhabited but is known to have had occupants at the be ginning of the 19th century. Three is no vegeta tion or fresh water here but thousands of gannets frequent the rocks.

Population. —The fixed population of the present reduced Qadha of Kut-al-Amarah is estimated at 20,000 souls, of whom the great majority are Shi'ah Muhammadans. There are also about 100 Jews. Resources. —Wheat, barley, beans, maize, Mash'and sesame are among the crops culti vated. Livestock are the same as in other Qadhas of the Baghdad Sanjaq, such as Jazirah. KUT-AL-AMARAH TOWN— Generally called simply Kut, and not to be confounded with the town of 'Amarah; the name of which is differently spelt; it is a small town and municipality in 'Iraq on the left bank of the Tigris opposite to the point where the Shatt-al-Gharaf goes off from its right bank : by river Kut is 140 to 145 miles above 'Amarah Town and 220 to 225 miles below Baghdad. The town stands along the river bank and has one mosque with a minaret: it is con nected with the opposite bank of the river by a boat bridge varying from 35 to 41 pon toons. The population is about 4,000 and mixed ; a large proportion are Faili Kurds ; the rest are Arabs of the Shi'ah persuasion with the exception of the 100 Jews, who have a synagogue, and a handful of Christians. The surrounding country belongs to the Bani Rabi'ah. The inhabitants are mostly agriculturists, cattle breeders, dealers in grain and wool, brokers and shopkeepers; but the Kurds are generally porters and carriers; the Jews, goldsmiths; the Christians, liquorice merchants. Trade is mostly with the Kurdish towns of Badrah and Jassan and is not important; but there are about 200 shops, 10 Khans and 8 caf^s, also 2 wool-presses. There is a considerable export of liquorice, which grows plentifully in the neighbourhood, and barley, wheat, oats, maize and mash are cultivated in the vicinity. Woollen rugs or Haramat and coarse carpets called Zull are manufactured, and the town has some good gardens and date plantations; but supplies and transport are both scarce. Kut-al-Amarah was formerly the headquarters of the Qadha of the same name in the Sanjaq and Wilayat of Baghdad. Kut has post and telegraph offices. kut-al-gaw A m— A village on the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab (q. v.), between Basrah and the Persian frontier. kut GHADHBAN— A village on the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab {q. v.), between Basrah and the Persian frontier.

KUWAIT BAY and TOWN— This name is the diminutive of Kut and means a small fort: it sviffieiently indicates the insignificant origin of the thriving town of Kuwait, the capital of the Arab Shaikhdom or principality which now shares its name. In old English records and books Kuwait i generally called ' Graine ' or ' Grane,' doubtless from the island of Quram a short distance to the west of it. The town, which is about 80 miles south and slightly east of Basrah almost 180 miles west by north of Bushehr and nearly 280 miles north-north- west of Bahrain, faces the north-west and is situated on the southern shore of Kuwait Bay about one-third of the way from its entrance at Ras-al-Ardh to its foot at Jahrah. Coast, harbour and anchorages.— The bay itself is a large inlet of remarkable form leading out of the north-west corner of the Persian Gulf, with an extreme length east and west oi over 20 miles and a maximum breadth north and south of about 10 miles, shape it approaches a crescent with the convex side to the north and one of the boms pointing to the south-west. The bay proper is an indentation in the true Arabian coast fine which is represented northwards by the western shore of Khor-as-^abiyah and southwards by the coast below Ras-al-Ardh ; but its shore line is prolonged on the side next the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab by a mud-flat, extending 20 miles south-east from the mouth of Khor-as- Sabiyah, on which stands the island of Failakah. The entrance of the bay, between this mud-flat and Ras-al-Ardh, is about 4 miles wide and open to the south west and south-south-west. In the southern shore of the bay, within there are three coves; the easternmost, between Ras-al-Ardh and Ras A]uzah is_shallow and vessels are recommended not to enter it; the middle cove, between Ras A] uzah and Ras ' 'Ashairij, contains Kuwait Town on its eastern side, a dead coral reef covered with mud and sand and known as 'Akaz in the centre, the island of Qurain or Shuwaikh on the southern margin of 'Akaz, and the island of Umm -an-Namal near_Ras Ashainj ; the watermost cove, D5hat Kadhamah between Ras 'Ashairij and Ras Kadhamah, forms the innermost recess of the whole bay, and near the foot of it stands the village of Ja The land surrounding the bay is low except on the north side where the Zor hills, parallel to the shore, attain a height of 150 to 400 feet. A flat of soft mut extends for some distance off shore on the northern side of the bay making communication diflicu at low water between sea and land. j , v • i In most parts of the bay the water is of suitable depth for anchorage and t'leic is goo holding-ground : the soundings are 14 fathoms off Ras-al-Ardh and 6 to 10 fathoms o x Ras 'Aiuzah, shoaling to 6 fathoms at the entrance of Dohat Kadhamah. Ihere is a rocky 2-fathoms shoal, called Fasht-al-Hadibah, 2*- miles north of the town. The anchorage for large vessels is called Bandar Tawainah ; it lies a mile and a half to the north of the town inside Fasht-al-Hadibah. In a Shamal a considerable sea rises in the south part of the bay, not enough however to distress a large vessel; but in a Qaus vessels anchoring outside the Hadibah shoal, or with the town south by west to south west, might not be sufficiently sheltered. , , . . Shoal water extends off the town of Kuwait for about 8 cables, and landing at low tide is inconvenient as the beach dries out to a considerable distance ; but a,t high water the sea washes up almost to the houses. In front of the town are several tidal har wurs, called Niqa'ahs of considerable size, formed by piers and breakwaters or burs ot loose coral blocks ; these arc often breached in a Shamal, but are easily repaired. Un the beach proper lie in winter, drawn up above the highwater line, many of the pearling and other vessels on which the prosperity of the town depends : in places these extend, almost touching each others' side, for hundreds of yards, and when launched they must form an imposing fleet. The boat harbour of Bandar-ash-Shuwaikh near the town is described in the article on Qarain island, and the bay and promontory of Kadhaman are dealt with in the article under their own name. -KUWAIT BAY AND TOWK 1 The town and Us surroundings. —The town now measures about 2 miles alon« the shorn and is rapidly extending towards Ras 'Ajuzah; its depth inland is from one-fourth to threo' fourth of a mile. Free sites granted by the Shaikh on all sides of the town are, on account of the increasing prosparity of the place, being rapidly taken up and built upon by enter prising individuals as a commercial speculation. The land surrounding Kuwait is nura desert as far as the eye can reach and blonga to the tract called Qra'ah 0 One mile west of the town, on Ris 'Ajuzah, is a fortified dwelling house, erected in 1904 by the eldest son of the Shaikh of Kuwait and named after him Qasr-ash-Shaikh Jabir. To the south of the to vn the land rises for a mile or so and then falls ; consaquently the place is lost from sight soon after leaving it. On this side, in the cold weather, are pitched many Bedouin camps, and there is a constant coming and going of camels and of small caravans. Kuwait was formerly walled and 30 years ago had seven gates on the land- ward side, but since that time it has doubled in size and the sites of the old gates are now known to few; of one only, the Drawazat Jana'at, which was the second in order from the east, do any traces remain. Kuwait is now an open, undefended town. From the centre of the town on the south side has grown out a long suburb called Murbaq beyond which is a gypsiferous tract where Juss or gypsum mortar is manufactured by simply hnng rubbish in broad shallow excavations. The site of the town is generally flat and sandy; but the south-western quarter stands on somewhat higher ground than the rest and has steep lanes leading down from it to the beach. The streets are irregular and winding, many of them are blind alleys, and the town is not laid out on any general phm ; the only street of apparent importance, besides the main bazaar which runs at right angles to the sea about the middle of the town, is one which leads from the Sua or market square, situated at the back of the town near the Murqab quarter, to the north east end of the town but it has no general name. Most of the houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher owing to a parapet-wall enclosing the roof; they are generally built surrounding a courtyard. The better sort are of stone plastered with Juss and have high arched gateways, sometimes with a wicket-door in the middle of the gate: a few arches appears also in upper storeys. The system of conservancy is rudimentary; the bpTwSn^n eP TSi 111 large '. 0 P en P ubllc cesspools in the various quarters. There are l ^ m03qUeS ' 0 /. Which 4 are J * mi ' s or Frida y congregational mosques; these are the chief mosque, which stands on the west side of the main bazaar, the 0 -w Sea face . near his residence, the mosque of Haddad, and the mosque of the Jana at; none of these have any architectural pretensions.

Two of the Jews are well-to-do merchants ; the rest are ajostly cloth-sellers and goldsmiths. The Jana at are a small colony of 150 souls ; some are merchants, the others sailors and boatmen. The negroes are a very conspicuous element in the population : thev number about 4,000 altogether, and have social clubs of their own which are distin- guished by peculiar sky-signs; about one-third are Ma'tuq or emancipated, while two-thirds are Mamluk or enslaved. The Muhammadans of Kuwait are nearly all Sunnis ; the exceptions are the Persians Baharmah and some of the Hasawiyah, who are Shi'ahs, and some immigrants from Aajd, who are Wahhabis. The pilgrimage to Makkah from Kuwait is never made by land at present, and the annual number of pilgrims who go by sea is only from 20 to 40. J The Arab population of Kuwait are not on the whole of a robust type ; they are generally long-faced, slender and inclined to lankiness ; the Complexion of' many is sickly. The men wear the ordinary garments of the sedentary Arab, while the women dress in black veils and overmantles, but sometimes display beneath a bright-coloured skirt which they allow to trail in the dust for some distance behind them. A remarkable scene follows sunset, when the town suddenly becomes alive with mendi cants, mostly children, who beset the doors of the houses and beg in melancholy voices for a morsel from the evening meal; they are seldom repulsed from any gate. Mer chants and other townsmen of Kuwait often resort for a change, before the pearling season, to the small tillages in the adjacent Qra'ah and 'Adan districts. Supplies and Neither Kuwait town nor its environs can boast of any agricultural lesources. There are no date plantations, no fields, hardl3 ? even a kitchen garden. Forage and vegetables are mostly brought fro n Jahrah or from abroad ; and the Bedouins of the neighbourhood provide the town with dried curds or Yuqat, ghi ot Saman and truffles or Paqa' both fresh and dried, besides camel-dung or Jillah which is used as fuel to supplement the scanty supply of brushwood from the neigh bourhood. 6 The drinking water of the town is mostly obtained from wells 4 miles to the south of the town and it is passably good, but water of better quality is supplied to the Shaikh's household from the wells of Qasr-as-Sirrah or those of Mishrif in Qra 'ah. Sect fisheries.—The only truly local produce of Kuwait is that yielded by the har bour fisheries ; these are a valuable asset. The principal fish is the Zubaidi, a deep thin fish about 1 foot long, which is in season from December to April and, though found all over the bay, is caught chiefly between the island of Failakah and its outlier An hah in water from 2 to 12 fathoms deep ; the Zubaidi forms about one-third of the total catch of the Kuwait boats. The Zubaidi is captured with float-aad-weight nets 2 to 2^ fathoms deep, which are set across the tide-way ; these nets are made in lengths of 36 fathoms, and each boat carries 8 to 16 lengths which are connected when set so as to form one long barrier of 300 to /00 fathoms in extent; sometimes as many as 70 boats go out. The nets are cast after sunset and are hauled three times in the night: fish that are not disposed of on the hrst day, in consequence of not reaching the town in time, are salted. The next most common kinds of fish are the Naqrur and the Nawaibi, which each constitute about one-quarter of the yield of the fisheries. The Naqrur, varying in length from 1 to 2 feet, is found all over the harbour, is in season in March and April, and is caught with lines or Khuyut by about 40 boats, prawns and small fish being used as bait. The Nawaibi is about the same size, is in season at the same time, and is caught in the same manner. The Maid is a fish rather less than a foot long which is caught along the beach in summer with hand-nets. Ribyan or prawns, which are in season in March and April and again in October and Novem ber are captured with fine triangular hand-nets. Many fish are taken also in stake- nets or rather tidal weirs called Hadhrahs, constructed of reed-hurdles ; the fish enter them with the flowing tide and are left behind at the ebb. These Hadhrahs are a common sight along the coast near Kuwait and also at other places such as Bahrain. The fishermen of Kuwait are mostly town Arabs, but there are a few Persians: the boats used ^ are Shu ais, Baqarahs and Ballams. As a rule Kuwait fishermen do not go outside 'Auhah near Failakah, but occasionally they visit the Khor 'Abdullah and fish it, for Zubaidi only, between Pas-al-Qaid and Warbah island j at such times C52(w)GSB1082 KUWAIT BAY AND TOWN they take their drinking water with them and are absent from Kuwait for about a week, not landing on Bubiyan island except to collect fuel. Pearl fisheries. —The lower and middle classes of Kuwait town almost all live by sea faring occupations, such as fishing, pearl diving and the coasting trade; the town posseses about 400—500 pearl boats carrying 9,000 men ; but of the crews in the pearling season, some 1,500 or 2,000 are Persian subjects. A large number of Kuwait pearl fisheries—in 1905 no less than 3,000—flow visit the Ceylon pearl banks in winter instead of remaining at home to prosecute the cold weather sea fisheries which have been described above. Carrying trade. —The carrying trade of Kuwait is chiefly confined to the upper and western part of the Persian Gulf and to the Shatt-al-'Arab; its ordinary limits are Qatif on the south and Basrah on the north, and the boats engaged in it are seldom absent from Kuwait for more than two months at a time. Sea-going cargo vessels number 36, viz., 11 Baghlahs, 20 Bums-and 5 Shu'ais ; the Baghlahs have an average carrying capacity of 2,000, and the Bums arH Shu'ais one of 1,200 date packages each. Coasters are about 50 Bums with an average carrying capacity of 700 date packages each. Besides these cargo vessels, wlvich though owned at Kuwait are quite distinct from the pearl boats, about 50 strange boats—chiefly Ballams—visit the port with wood and vegetables from the Shatt-al-'Arab; and occasional calls are made by vessels from Kharag island and from Sur in the Sultanate of 'Oman. Boat-building. —Except boat-building there are no local manufactures. About 20 or 25 vessels are turned out annually, the timber, coir rope and fibre required being brought from Calicut, and the ribs from Karachi: the nails used are also from India. About 300 carpenters gain a livelihood by boat-building ; their earnings range from ^ of a Riyal to 4 Riyal? a day. Miscellaneous occupations. —The other occupations and industries of the town are directed to the satisfaction of local requirements : an enumeration of them as they were in 1904 will help to elucidate the character of Kuwait. There were then 36 dealers in piece goods. 21 goldsmiths, 11 blacksmiths, 12 tinsmiths, 7 gunsmiths, 11 lamp makers, 132 dealers in Bedouin requisites (such as carpets, cheap 'Abas or cloaks, nails, horseshoes, lead and shot), 13 leather workers, 17 quilt makers, 23 haberdashers, 21 tailors, 37 cloak embroiders, 7 gold and silk braid workers, 12 makers of'Aqals or Arab head fillets, 13 barbers, 11 confectioners, 8 bakers, 3 professional cooks, 11 fishmongers, 36 butchers, 14 tobacconists, 9 ghi sellers, 32 date merchants, 16 druggists, 28 fruiters, 24 rice merchants, 15 wheat dealers, 2 oil pressors, 147 grocers and druggists, 9 grass sellers and, lastly, 35 male and 32 female brokers of private goods on commission who had fixed places of business. There were at the same time 12 tea shops, 7 cafes, 70 business offices, 250 warehouses for the storage of grain, and 6 stores for the material used in pressing oil. Weights, measures and currency. —The weights and measures by means of which the tradesmen of Kuwait conduct their business with one another and with the general piibhc deserve a brief notice. Small weights are the Habbah of 3 gr. English, the Mith- K f ^ 54 grains, the Mithqal Shirazi of 72 grains, and the Tolah of 120 grains ; u these are only in use for weighing such commodities as the precious metals, pre cious stones, gold and silver thread or lace, raw silk, silk thread and drugs. The or- oinaiy unit of weight in retail transactions is a Waqiyah equal to 4 lbs. 10 oz. 1 dr. xmglish; there is also a retail Mann of 30 Waqiyahs or 138 lbs. 13^ oz.

Beams and masts are sold by the Calicut kandy of 10 cubic feet and 29 cubic inches, chandals (round rafters or spars) by the Korjah or score, and boat ribs by the Gari or cart load of 40 pieces or upwards according to size. Indian rupees and other coins are current; but the basis of the local currency is the Maria Theresa dollar or Riyal of which 100 are on the average equivalent in value to 135 Indian rupees, but in 1905-06 the rate of exchange fluctuated between 133 and 152. Trade, —Kuwait owes its mercantile, as distinguished from its political, importance to its pearling and coasting fleet, to trade—especially a lucrative smuggling trade with Persia and Iraq, The richest merchants of Kuwait are Arabs who have made their fortunes in general trade ; ten of them possess capitals ranging from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 5,00,000. Of the Persian trading community two are wealthy, while about 20 others have sums between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 10,000 invested in their business ; two Jews also employ from Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000 each in local trade. As no statistics of imports and exports are kept at Kuwait or, if kept by the Shaikh's customs department, are not communicated, it is impossible to give reliable particulars of foreign trade. According, however, to the most recent trade report the value of foreign goods imported by sea in 1905-06 was Rs. 48,18,929, of which Rs. 27,69,054 represented goods arriving by steamers and the balance goods brought in native sailing craft. In the year mentioned the chief classes of imports were as follows, in order of value;— Article. Value in lakhs of rupees. Remarks. 1 Arms and ammuni tion. 10i Entirely by steamer ; four-fifths of the total were of British and one-fifth was of French origin. It is said that about three-quarters of the rifles and cartridges landed eventually find their way into Turkish 'Iraq ; the remainder, with the exception of a few which are smuggled into Persia, are disposed of to Central Arabian customers.

The Brazilian coffee from America, which is of recent introduction, has not as yet found any sale in Kajd, and the Indian is still preferred even at Kuwait. Some Arabian coffee for private consump tion, not for sale, is brought from Aden, etc., by owners of native sailing vessels. All by sailing vessels, three-fourths from Persia and one-fourth from 'Iraq. By steamer; three-quarters came from Germany and one-quarter from India. It is said that the bulk of the rice, wheat, coffee and barley, and of the baled piece-woods such as cheap Mexicans, are not consumed at Kuwait but have Najd for their destination. The total value of export in 1905-06 was only Rs. 11,54,322 and the table of valuable exports and re-exports is consequently a short one ; it is as follows Article.

The value of the specie exported from Kuwait in 1904-05 was Rs. 4,32,223 and in 1905-06 —^ Rs. 2,87,535 ; in both years this specie went chiefly to India and was considerably in , excess of the amount of specie imported. In 1905-06 of the total sea-borne trade of Kuwait in both directions, about 30-75 per ^ liii cent, was with India, 28*77 percent, with Arabia, 14*66 with the United Kingdom and 9 * 21 per cent, with Persia ; the remainder was divided among various countries ^ in less considerable amounts. With regard to trade by land, it is stated that before the war in Central Arabia about 20 caravans from Southern Najd and two from Jabal 'ei)]!*. Shammar used to come in annually at Kuwait; on the other hand, while the course of events was unfavourable to the Shaikh of Kuwait and his allies and Hafar was in fell ill the hinds of Ibn Rashid, the Central Arabian trade was in a large measure diverted to iffltsj. Basrah and Najaf ; and at the present timodirect commercial relations between Kuwait *i eveiil and Jabal Sham mar are still in abeyance. Batches of 300 to 500 camels are occasionally com ® exported to Syria by land. The slow steamer of the British India Steam Navigation Company has called regularly once a fortnight at Kuwait since 8th of July 1903, and on the 9th of December 1904 the last steamer began to call in the intermediate weeks. In 1905-06 no less than 50 steamers mi (all British) with a total tonnage of 51,893 entered the port of Kuwait. Administration. —Kuwait is despotically and personally governed by the Shaikh. There is no delegation of authority. The town is divided into many quarters, but in none of them is there any recognised headman : all the inhabitants must deal direct with the Shaikh, who generally gives audience at the market place for an hour or two every morning. The nature of the Shaikh's general administration is explained in the ;iiV ,, article on the Kuwait Principality. Bedouins are not now forbidden to enter the town eS (j, k . armed, but they generally leave their weapons in their tents outside. The town [ ^ guard consists of about 20 watchmen indifferently armed and equipped. KUWAIT PRINCIPALITY. Strategical and commercial advantages, close political relations with the British Government, and an intimate connection with Central Arabian affairs combine to render the position of the Kuwait Shaikhdom remarkable. It might almost be regarded as an independent state under virtual British protection. Extent. —The boundaries of the Kuwait Principality are for the most part fluctuating and undefined ; they are, at any given time, the limits of the tribes which then, either voluntarily or under compulsion, own allegiance to the Shaikh of Kuwait. The northern and southern frontiers in the neighbourhood of the sea may however be regarded as fixed. On the north the influence of the Sha kh of Kuwait is unquestioned up to the very walls of Umm Qasr and Safwan; we may accordingly consider the frontier on this side to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwan to Jabal Sanam and thence to the Batin. On the south the Shaikh does not claim to exercise any real control over the Radaif tract; his boundary on this side may accordingly be considered to run westwards from Jabal jj Manifah on the coast to the Na 'airryah hill at the north-western corner of Radaif. It is a task of great difficulty to circumscribe the Shaikh's territories on the remain ing sides with even approximate accuracy. Shaikh Mubarak stated (1904) that on the north-west his influence reached to the Batin and somewhat beyond it, and that on the west the inhabitants of Summan, but not those of Dahanah, acknowledged —him ; and his assertion was to some extent borne out by known facts in regard to the Bagii^ occupation of Hafar which Ibn Rashld, though at one time he seized it, was unable ia for long to retain. We may therefore consider that the Shaikhdom is bounded between A Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and that south of Hafar the border is the gleyesr, line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is obserw intersected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. These being the limits of the [lii?fact Kuwait Principality its length form north-north-west to south-south-east is about (serves 190, and its breadth from east-north-east to west-south-west about 100 miles. The nly tke islands belonging to Kuwait are mentioned in the next paragraph.1086 KUWAIT PRINCIPALITY Districts and islands. —The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Kuwait Town and Riqa 'i. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batin, Umm-al-Khllan, Yah, Qira'-al-Marru, Zaqlah and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah and Umm Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Kuwait Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, Qra ah, 'Adan, Salu and Hazaim. There is also, in the extreme south, a district called Sudah, which some authorities treat as independent of Umm Janaib and others regard as a portion of it. The maritime possessions of Kuwait may be reckomd to consist of the island of Failakah which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and 'Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Kuwait Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, C^aru and Umm-al- Maradim. Coastal features. —The cost line of Kuwa t, except Kuwait Bay, s insignificant in its features and hardly merits a detailed description. The following only need be noted:— Name. Position. Nature. Remarks. 'Ajuzah (Ras) 12 miles north-east by east of Kuwait Town. It is in the Qra : ah District. Low cape. The present Shaikh of Kuwait has a fort, Qasr-ash- Shaikh Jabir, here.

On the coast near the point is a pearl bank known as Qalai'ah. About 4 miles north west of the point is a very short pro montory of soft sandstone rising about 50 feet above the level of high tide and protecting from the Shamal a small bay known as Adhba'iyah ; on this promontory, which is rapidly disappear ing into the sea, are the ruins of a fort and mosque. The small promon tory is called Qalai- at-al-'Abid to dis tinguish it from the main promontory or Qalai'at-al-Har a r ; the explanation given of the names is that the former is dark like a ' slave ' while the latter is light-coloured like a ' free man.' The village of Shi'ai bah is visible from the neighbourhood of Qalai'at-al-'Abid. A well-known land mark.

The coast of this bay to wards the north is called Ardh-ad- Dasht, and towards the south Ardh-az- Zor. Zor (Ras-az) 51 miles south-south east of Ku wait Town and 40 miles north-north west of Hadd-al-Mi- sha'ab. A long, low, sandy point. There is a pearl bank here, adjoining the coast, about G miles west-north- west of Ras-az-Zor, and \ a mile inland from the shore of Dohat-az-Zarq is the Baniyat-az-Zor, a chain of broken sandstone mounds reaching south-east and north-west for about a mile ; the highest rises 30 feet above the plain. These mounds are situated in a tract known as Ardh-az- Zor or Ardh Abu 'Amlrah ; the tract contains an abund ance of a shrub called Silaij, green in the hot weather, on which camel feed and which has an aperient effect on them. Between Ras az-Zor and Banlyat- az-Zor are the brackish wells of Sulloh. An account of the pearl banks adjoining this coast will be found in the Appendix on • the pearl fisheries of the Gulf. Physical geography. —The surface of each of the districts mentioned above is described in the article under its name. As a whole the territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait is monotonous devoid of striking features, and sterile. The only well-marked valleys of any size are t ose o titin and Shaqq, while the only eminences deserving of mention are Jabal Sanam on the northern boundary, the Jal-az-Zor on the north side of Kuwait Bay, and the Dhula -al-Mi aijil towards the south of Umm Janaib ; isolated hills of some importance as landmarks are Sirrah in Qra'ah, Burqan and Warah in 'Adan, Qrain andKUWAIT PRINCIPALITY 1091 'Amudah in Sudah, besides the small plateaux of Ba'al in Sudah and Warai'ah near Dhula'-al-Mi'aijil. The soil is generally gravelly in the districts to the north of Kuwait Bay ; in the more southerly it is partly sand and partly clay, except in Summan, where there seems to be little sand. In many places there are low outcrops of sandstone, and in Summan these are a leading characteristic. Nowhere in Kuwait, it is said, is there any flowing water or spring rising to the surface of the ground except Maqta' : the entire water supply is from wells which are on the average about 20 feet deep and are frequently saline. The only minerals known to exist are Juss or gypsum, in fields near Kuwait Town, and elsewhere, and bitumen which exudes from the ground in a hollow near the Burqan hills. Flora and fauna. —Vegetation is exceedingly scanty and in winter becomes almost invisible. The only trees are the date and the ber or Sidar and they, even, are not met with except in the environs of villages. Shrubs found, especially in the northern districts, and useful as grazing for camels are the 'Arfaj and the 'Ausaj ; the latter is a thorny bush with small leaves and red berries. The colocynth, called Handhal, flourishes in the desert ; and south of Kuwait Bav the grass called Thamam is obtainable, but is often of poor quality. Nasi grass is also obtainable in places. Animal and bird life are scarce, but the wild animals include the hare and a gazelle resembling the Indian chinkara ; also the wolf : among land birds are the lesser bustaid and the sandgrouse, the last being plentiful in the Batin in winter. Communications. —From what has gone before it will be apparent that Kuwait, though free as to its surface from physical obstacles, is not a country of easy travelling. At a maximum distance of 20 to 25 miles from the town in any direction even the smallest quantity of provisions ceases to be obtainable ; it is thus necessary to carry all the food required for a journey. The case of forage is not so difficult, as in many localities camels are able to support themselves by grazing on the road. Water is scarce, especially to the north of Jarah, and routes are determined everywhere chiefly by the position and state of the wells. The principal routes are two leading to Basrah and four (of which two pass through Hafar) to Najd : the details of the more important follow below. All these of course are mere tracks ; there are no made roads :—- Inhabitants. —The tribes of Kuwait are all Arabs or quasi-Arabs, belonging to the Sunni sect of Islam. Non-Arabs and Shi'ahs are found only in the town of Kuwait. The two tribes which compose the bulk of the population outside of Kuwait Town are tho 'Awazim and Rashaidah ; both are regarded as of socially inferior status, nevertheless they differ but little from the ordinary Bedouin Arabs. To these we may a Id wandering bands of the Saluba, between whom and the Arabs there is a more pronounced dilference. Some of the friendly Dhafir and Mutair tribes of Najd enter Kuwait limits at certain seasons ; indeed, the Kuwait portion of Summan is exclusively tenanted by the Mutair, and a large number of the Mutair encamp every season at Jahrah. The people of Jahrah are mostly of Najdi extraction. A few stray 'Ajman, Bani Hajir and Bani Khalid fioiu the south are found in Kuwait limits, and Kuwait Town contains, in addition to^ repre sentatives of most of the tribes already mentioned, 'Anizah, Dawasir, Jana'at, and 'Utiib. The only permanent villages in Kuwait are Jahrah at the head of Kuwait Bay, Qasr-as-SabTyah on Khor-as- Sabiyah, Zor on Failakah island, Dimnah and Qasr- as-Sirrah in the Qra'h district and FahaihTl, Fantas, Abu Halaifah and Shi aibah on the coast of 'Adan, none of which are more than 25 miles in a direct line from Kuwait Town. . . . The fixed population of the principality, consisting of the inhabitants of the town and villages may be estimated at 43,000 souls, of whom no ler,s than 40,000 are residents o the capital; and the Bedouin population, if we reckon only the 'Awazim and Rashaidah and a part of the Mutair (whose tribal headquarters are in the principality) and exclude others such as the Dhafir (who are merely visitors), must amount apparently to about 13,000 souls. t ■ l • -u- Agriculture and trade. —-A general description of such agriculture as exists in Kuwait will be found in the article on Jahrah, and the article on Dimnah contains a description of village dwellings int rmediate between the houses of Kuwait Town and the tents of the Bedouins. Domestic animals are the camel, sheep, goat and donkey ana there are some horned cattle and a few horses. Commerce is fully treated of in the article on Kuwait Town. _ „KUW—KUW A certain amount of stono is exported from Kuwait. It is extracted from coral roofs which are actually growing in the shadow waters of the bay. These reefs at low tide are only from one to two feet below the water. The Arabs go into the water and extract the blocks by means of crowbar. The blocks are then roughly piled into heaps, and at high tide a boat Is brought alongside the heap and is loaded. When first extracted, the blocks are relatively soft, but they harden on exposure to the air. After the upper two feet or so of any given area of coral reef has been extracted, the Arabs proceed to another reef, and, after about 15 years or so, the coral is often found to have grown sufficiently to allow of the previous area again being worked. Military resources. —The Shaikh's fighting force in war consists of the best levy he can raise from the tribes subject to his influence ; bat he also possesses a sort of standing army, armed with rifles, who defend his person, perform his errands in the country and supply the town guard at Kuwait. These are about 100 in number and are mostly footmen. Revenue. —There is no distinction in Kuwait between the State revenues and the privy purse of the ruler, nor, of course, are any accounts of revenue and expenditure made public. The following is a careful estimate by a Persian merchant settled at Kuwait of the Shaikh's annual receipts, of which a large proportion are in kind :— $ Produce of date plantations at Fao .. .. ., 108,000 Rent of shops in the Kuwait bazaar Zakat on B3douin flocks Tax on sheep brought into the town Tax payable by butchers Tax on camels brought to the town for sale Sea customs Duties on exports to the interior Tax payable by pearl divers* .. Fines Share of fish brought into Kuwait Interest on m jney lent to merchants Total 9,000 25,000 2,000 2,500 1,500 150,000 20,000 60,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 3,99,000 The Shaikh denies receiving anything from pearl divers or by way of interest on money lent; but it was generally stated at Kuwait in 1904 that he took one diver's share fro n each pearl boat and that he had lent a large sum at 23 per cent, interest to a local Arab merchant named Shamlan. It is believed that the Shaikh is building up a lar&lt;re private fortune. Bjsid-is valuable plantations at Fao he owns some 300 shops and warehouses in Kuwait Town. KUWARAH(AL-BJ)—- Singular is Kuwari. A tribe found chiefly in Qatar, but there are a few of them in ^.ahram also, in Qatar they have 250 houses at Sumiismah, nearly 150 at Dha'ain, 100 at Fuwairat and 20 at Dohah ; in Bahrain there are now onlv about 10 houses at Muharraq Town and the same at Hadd. The Al Bii Kuwarah are divided into four sec tions, m the Al Abd-ash-Shaikh, Al Kalaib, Al Yaham, and Matawa'ah. In religion they are Sanms of the Mahki school; by occupation they are pearl merchants, pearl divers, sailors, and camel and cattle breeders.

Some of the inhabitants then removed permanent ly to Ghasibah, but others returned to Mubarraz after a time. The name of Mubarraz appears to refer to the ' exodus ' from Naqaiyah to which its foundation was due. This was once the principal quarter but was abandoned in favour of Mubar raz on account of an epidemic. The few remaining inhabitants are Bani Khadhir. The Ghasibah quarter sprang up round Taraiyij, which forms a3 it were ita core. WusaUah, which is described in the topographical table attached to the article on Aflaj, is attached to Lailah for administrative purposes ; but it is a distinct village and lies about 5 miles to northward. °LAI—LAM 1097 L ATM UN (W adi)— The largest and most important tributary of Wadi Fatimah {q .v.) in Hejaz.

(c) Juwi ibn Lazim. {d) Chitab ibn Said. {a) Shahib is in occupation of lands on left bank from 'Amarah to the Nahr Sa'ad, twenty miles above 'Amarak. He is the senior member of the Bani Lam tribe and, though with little power in men, exercises much influence over other sections with which he happens to be on good terms. Ho has been at all times friendly to the British. He is a violent enemy of Ghadhban ibn Bunaiyah and would go to any extreme to see the latter out of favour. Strength about 200 horsemen and 1,000 footmen. His camp is opposite the Butairah canal •during most of the year, but in the spring he lives at a fort five miles inland on the edge of the marsh. (6) Ghadhban is the most powerful member of the tribe. He was a perpetual thorn in the flesh of the Turks who could do nothing with him. At the time of our entry into Mesopotamia however he offered the Turks his services in return for certain lands. After the fall of 'Amarah he came in, and remained staunch for a time, but in July 1915, on the advance of the Turks towards 'Amarah, he went over to them with his following of about 6,000 men. His lands were taken away and given to Juwi ibn Lazim. In Decem ber 1916 he again made overtures and on certain conditions he was allowed to come in. He is now, with a much decreased following and with his prestige diminished, in the neighbourhood of the Duwairij river on the Persian Frontier. His brother Bilasim is at enmity with him. He lives, with a small following, five miles below Ali Gharbi on the left bank. Another brother, Falih, with a following of 150 horsemen and 300 foot, owns lands on left bank of the Musharrah canal eight miles east of 'Amarah. Ghadhban'a following at present is 700 horsemen and 1,000 footmen. (c) Juwi ibn Lazim occupies the lands formerly belonging to Ghadhban extending along the left bank from Nahr Sa'ad, twenty miles above 'Amarah, to the Wadi, ten miles above Shaikh Sa'ad. From the time of our occupation of 'Amarah, except for a brief period when the Turks were camped close to him, his conduct has been irrepproach- able and his worst enemy has never suggested that he has had dealings with the Turks. A violent enemy of Ghadhban and also of Fahad of Bait Arar. He lives usually at Guraishah about ten miles below Ali 'Gharbi, strength .500 horsemen, 1,000 footmen. (5?) Chitab ibn Said owned part share of lands known as Ghuraibah on left bank of Tig' ris in the neighbourhood of the Wadi and Suwaichah march. He came in at the time of the first advance to Kut, but the day before the battle of Sinn assisted to loot and bum supply mahailas in the Line of Communications. After this he joined the Turks His camp was raided and burnt by us in March 1916. Has a small foUowing of about 100 2. Bait 'Ali Khan. A smafl section of whom the Shaikh is Yaqub ibn Yusuf.

The Sarkhah are not of very much importance: their Shaikh Mushattat has friendly relations with some of the Sagwand Lurs, and a few settled Sarkhah are found at Jirqeh Saiyid Ta'ameh in the Dizful District of 'Arabistan. The number of fighting men of the tribe in 'Arabistan is thus approximately 8,000, and from a comparison of various discrepant accounts their military strength in 'Iraq would seem to be about 10,000. In view, however, of the indefiniteness of the Turco- Persian boundary and of the mobility of some of the sections of the Bani Lam, it is probable that the two estimates to a great extent overlap : consequently it is not neces sary to estimate the fighting strength of the tribe at more than 15,000 men or their total number at more than 45,000 souls. Mode of life and resources.-Except the Kinanah division, who (unless those settled at Mirbacheh) are entirely pastoral in their habits, the majority of all sections of the Bam Lam are agricultural and live by growing cereals. The tribe as a whole have not yet, however, abandoned the nomad life; for neither houses nor huts but only hair tents are found among them and they migrate towards the hills in the cold weather and are on the move from February to June. Wheat, barley, oats, maize millet, mash and lentils are among their crops, but they have not much rice ; their cultivation is shifting and desultory. The camels and horses of the Bam Lam are among the best in 'Iraq ; of horses their best breeds are the Hargah Nasbah and Wadhnah, the two former being, it is said, a monopoly of the tribe They have also buffaloes, cattle, sheep and donkeys and supply most of the eW for which 'Amarah Town is famous. The livestock of the ZighSb^rdTvis on afe to consist exclusively of buffaloes, and the Ka'ab Bait 'Amir are also amonVthe buffalo-owning sections. The horses possessed by that portion of the tribe which is rrraLra t 3fo5 1 b,stanratherthanwith ^ ^ t'LAM—LAM 1101 Political position and military importance. —The Bani Lam are, with a few exceptions, Shi 'ahs ; by some of them Persian is spoken as well as Arabic, but they are not to any appreciable extent bilingual. Blood feuds are rigorously prosecuted both within the tribe and against outsiders. The tribe, as a whole, show great respect for their Shaikhs, to whom they are said to be blindly submissive both in peace and war; and though much divided among themselves by feuds and factions they do not fail to combine against outsiders. Their present head Ghadhban is described as notoiiously rich and brave, but a rude and violent savage wihout the experienee or the moderation that a ge gives ' ; he appears to have a permanent good understanding with the Shaikh of Muhammareh. .. . . , ^ On the Arab side of the border the Bani Lam are generally quiet, but the Ottoman Government never dared to put much pressure on them ; and though the revenue collector was treated with outward respect he did not always succeed in recovering the demand in full. In Persia the Bani Lam give much trouble to the authorities and seldom pay any revenue. In 'Iraq, where they are probably the largest, the most powerful and the richest tribe next to the Muntafik, the land assessment of the Bani Lam ia one-tenth to one-fifth in kind of agricultural produce, and they are also subject to a trifling annual tax in cash per head of livestock; these imposts are generally farmed out to the Shaikhs of the tribe, who collect as much as they can. In both countries the Bani Lam are noted for their predatory tendencies, but in reality the greater part of the tribe lead a peaceful and respectable life. The proceed ings of the lawless minority are said, however, to be connived at by the Shaikhs, who even accept a one-fifth share in the proceeds of their raids and robberies. Their plunder from Arab territory is disposed of in Persia, and vice versa. In 'Arabistan it is the Khasraj division who give most trouble j they attacked the Shushan steamer in April 1904, and in the summer of 1905 parties of them infested the neighbourhood of Nasiri and were not driven away without difficulty. The Kinanah also are said to raid in the Dizful District. Gangs of Bani Lam and Lur robbers sometimes come in conflict with one another; in the instances known victory has generally remained with the Lurs. The Bani Lam are now well 'supplied with modern rifles, chiefly Martinis, and are considered to be good shots, especially from the saddle. It is estimated that on the Persian side about one-third of the fighting men are mounted and two-thirds are armed with rifles ; on the 'Iraq side the proportion of mounted and unmounted men is said to be about equal.

The older town, in the north-east quarter, is surrounded by its own wall, and is separated by a broad open space, the Barr- al-Munakhah, and on the south side by the narrower Darb-al-Jenazah, from the modern town and suburbs, which are protected by a rampart of mud and crude brick joining the wall of the older town at its north-west and south-east extremities. Through the modern town runs the Wadi Bat-han, a tributary of the Wadi Qanat, which the road from Yanbo' crosses. A fort or small citadel shuts in the head of the Barr-al-Munakhah on the north side. There are five outer gates, the Bab-ash-Shami and the Bab-az- Ziyafah on the north, the former leading to Jabal Ohod and the tomb and mosque of the Prophet's uncle Hamza (about 4 miles from the town) ; in the East wall is the Bab- al-Jumah, which opens on the 'Najd road, and Bakis-al-Gharqad, the cemetery, in which are the tombs of many of the companions of the Prophet ; on the south is the Bab Kuba, opening on to the Kuba road, and on the west is the Bab-al-Ambari through which runs the road to Yanbo' The east and west gates are massive buildings with double towers. The railway station lies abcut a quarter of a mile to the west of tjhe town, and includes some substantial, bullet-proof buildings. Pilgrims arriving by rail or from Yambo' enter the town by the W. gate and cross the suburbs to the Barr-al-Munakhah, the great open space, already referred to, where cara vans assemble on arrival and before starting ; here those who cannot afford to hire houses encamp in the open. The older town is entered from the Barr-al-Munakhah by the Bab- al-Misr, from which the principal street runs eastward to the Haram or Prophet's Mosque, which is entered at the principal gate (Bab-as-Salam) in the south-west corner, richly decorated with marbles, tiles, and gilded inscriptions ; but the spacious court of the mosque, with its minarets and lofty dome, are hemmed in on all sides by narrow lanes and houses. Within the principal gate a portico leads along the south wall to t le chain bo t hung with curtains, which is supposed to contain the graves of Muham- mad, Abu Bakrand Umr ; the reputed tomb of Fatima is in a chamber to the north of tins, \\ ithin the court of the mosque are the Prophet's well and some palms said to have been planted by Fatima. The houses of the town ar® substantially built of granite and larva blocks cemented with lime ; some of those in the better residental quarters are four or five stories high and have small gardens behind ® , r n ' Tb® street are narrow and dark, but clean, and in part paved. Unhke Mecca, Al-Madinah has always been a city of agriculturists. It is surrounded on all sides except the west by date-plantations and cultivated fields, which extends or severa 1 miles. A copious supply of watei is conducted from a tepid source (Az-Zarka) to eaXo3t P fr. t0 t J leso » tb )' and is distributed by underground conduit eround wntor l^' 0 ° wa ei 18 ; ^ so obtained from many wells in the oasis, the under- and • eaSy reach ^ lmost an y P oint - Some of the wells are brackish no less than j Jq a ^ S . 1S . lm P re S na ^®d with salt.

In i ey ioi m a contrast to the motely population of the city, which throughmadinah 1121 intermarriage with Turks, Kurds, Persians and other races are Arab only in language and customs. Further admixture takes place through new settlers, who remain behind after each pilgrimage, attracted by the profits to be gained as guides and by the Turkish subsidy. All classes in the town, from the owners of houses to the water-carriers, make large profits out of the pilgrims, for while a visit to Al-Madjnah is not compulsory (like the pilgrimage to Mecca), those make it who can afford the luxury ; thus the annual influx of pilgrims, though much below that of Mecca, is still very considerable. Normally there is a garrison of three battalions and some camelry. Telegraph to Damascus and Yambo. The convergence of torrent-courses in the neighbourhood of Al-Madinah makes this one of the best watered spots in North Arabia. The city lies close to one of the great volcanic centres of the peninsula, which was in violent eruption as late as A. D. 1266, when the lava stream approached within an hour's distance of the walls and dammed up the Wadi Kanat. The result of this and other prehistoric eruptions has been to confine the underground water, so important in Arabian tillage, which can be reached at any point of the oasis by sinking deep wells. Many of the wells are brackish, and the natural fertility of the volcanic soil is in many places impaired by the salt with which it is impregnated. The date-palm grows well everywhere, and the groves, interspersed with gardens and cornfields, which surround the city on all sides except the west, have been famous from the time of the Prophet. Many kinds of fruit and vegetables are grown, among others, onions, garlic, carrots, beetroot, radishes, beans, cucumbers, and very fine grapes. The chief cereals are maize, wheat and barley. Thus situated, Al- Madinah was originally a city of agriculturists, not like Mecca, a city of merchants ; nor apart from the indispensable trade in provisions has it ever acquired commercial importance like that which Mecca owes to the pilgrimage. The pilgrimage to Al-Madinah,. though highly meritorious, is not obligatory, nor is it tied to a single season—so that there is no general concourse at one time, and no fair like that of Mecca. Strictly speaking, it is not even correct to speak of a pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and a visitor to that city, or to Mecca itself out of the pilgrim season, is called a Zair, not aHajji. Landowners and cultivators are still a chief element in the population of the city and suburbs. The latter, who are called Nawakhalah, and more or less openly profess the Shi'ah opinions, marry only among themselves. The townsmen proper, on the other hand, r.re a very motley race.* New settlers remain behind with each pilgrimage, attracted by the many offices of profit connected with the mosque, the stipends paid by the Sultan to every inhabitant and the gains to be derived by guides, or by those who make it a business to say prayers at the Prophet's mosque for persons who send a fee from a distance, as well as the alms which the citizens are accustomed to collect when they go abroad especially in Turkey. The population of the city and suburbs is about 20,000,t of which probably two-thirds are Arabs, the remainder being Turks with a small proportion of foreign residents from other Mohammadan countries. The city proper is surrounded by a solid stone wall, about 40 feet high, loopholed for musketry, but has no ditch. At short intervals all round the wall are disposed semicircular towers about 50 ft. high, which project sufficiently to afford means for flanking file. The wall forms an irregular oval running to a kind of angle at the North West where stands the castle held by a Turkish Garrison. There are four gateways very massive and well built. The houses are good stone buildings similar in style to those of Mecca ; some of those in the residential quarter have four and even five storeys, with small gardens behind. The streets are narrow but clean and in part paved ; the business part of the town is practically confined to two long streets, both very narrow. The Balat is a great paved street, an unusual feature in an eastern town, and dates from the first century of l^ lam. » 4 small number of families in Al-Madinah still claim to represent the ancient Ansar, the defenders of Muham mad- there are also some Siddiqiyah, claiming descent from Abuberk. But in fact the old population emi- ffrate'd m magse after the sack of Al-Madinah by Moslim in 683 and passed into Spain in the annies of Musa. In th/mh century one old man of the Khazraj and one old woman of the Aus tribe (the two tribes who,with some T pws inhabited the oasis at the time of Muhammad, were all that remained of the old stock in Al-Madinah (Maqqari 1 1S7 Dozv Mus d'Espa&lt;mel III). The aristocratic family of the Beni Hosain, who claim descent from Husainj til? mavtvr of' Kerbela, and so from the Prophet, have apparently a better established pedigree. nYavell puts it at 30,000 in 1909. C52(\v)GSB /E■HIiailBIIIIIIMIIirilBliM III I MADINAH There ia a copious supply of water conducted from a tepid source called 'Ain-az-Zafqa., at the village of Kuba, 2 miles south and distributed in underground cisterns in each quarter. The glory of Al-Madinah and the only important building is the mosque of the Prophet in the eastern part of the city, a spacious enclosed court about 420 feet in length from north to south and about 340 feet in breadth. The minarets and the lofty green dome above the sacred graves are imposing features but the circuit is hemmed in by hous es or narrow lanes, and is not remarkable except for the principal gate (Bab-as-Salam) at the south and of the west front, facing the sacred graves, which is richly inlaid with marbles and fine tiles, and adorned with golden inscriptions. This gate leads into a deeper portico, with ten rows of pillars running along the southern wall. Near the farther end of the portico but not adjoining the walls, is a sort of doorless house or cham ber about 20 feet by 25 feet built of square cut standstone blocks and hung with rich curtains, which is supposed to contain the graves of Mahammad, Abu Bakr and 'Omar, and has a blank space left for Isa-bin-Maryam (Jesus Christ) after his next appearance on earth. To the north of this is a smaller chamber of the same kind, draped in black which is said to represent the tomb of Fatima. Both are enclosed with an iron railing, so closely interwoven with brass wire work that a glimpse of the so-called tombs can only bo got through certain apertures, where intercessory prayer is addressed to the Prophet, and pious salutations are paid to the other saints. T he space between the railing and the tomb is seldom entered except by the servants of the mosque ; it contains the treasures of the mosque in jewels and plate, which were once very considerable but have been repeatedly plundered, last of all by the Wahhabis in the beginning of 19th Century The portico in front of the railing is not ineffective, at least by night. It is paved with marble, and in the eastern part with mosaic, laid with rich carpets ; the south wall is clothed with marble pierced with windows of good stained glass, and the great railing has a striking aspect; but an air of tawdriness is imparted by the vulgar paintings of the columns, especially in the part between the tomb and the pulpit, which has received in accordance with a tradition of the Prophet, the name of the '' Garden * (raudhah), and is decorated with barbaric attempts to carry out this idea in colour. The word raudhah also means a mausolem, and is applied by Ibn Zubair to the tomb itself ; thus the tradition that the space between the pulpit and the tomb was called by the Prophet one of the gardens of Paradise probably arose from a mistake. Visitors passing along the south wall from the Bab-as-Salam to salute the tomb are separated from the garden by an iron railing. The other three sides of the interior court have porticoes of less depth and mean aspect, with three or four rows of pillars. Within the court are the well of the Prophet and some palm-trees said to have been planted by Fatima ; this grove is separated from the rest of the court by a wooden partition. Flocks of pigeons similar to the famous pigeons of St. Mark's at Venice feed quite tamely among the worshippers. The original mosque was a low building of brick, roofed with palm branches, and much smaller than the present structure. The wooden pulpit, from which Mahammad preached, appears to have stood in the same place as the present pulpit in the middle of the south portico. The dwelling of the Prophet and the huts of his women adjoined the mosque. Mahammad died in the hut of Ayesha, and was buried where he died ; Abu Bakr and 'Omar wore afterwards buried beside him. In A. D. 711 the mosque which had previously been enlarged by 'Omar and 'Othman, was entirely reconstructed on a grander scale and in Byzantine style by Greek and Coptic artificers at the instance of Khalif Wahid and under the direction of 'Omar Ibn 'Abd-al-Aziz. The enlarged plan included the huts above named, which were pulled down. Thus the place of the Prophet s burial was brought within the Mosque ; but the recorded discontent of the city at this step shows that feeling which regards the tomb as the great glory of the mosque, and the pilgrimage to it as the most meritorious that can be undertaken except that to Mecca, was still quite unknown. It is not even certain what was done at this time to mark off the graves. Ibn 'Abd Rabbih, in the beginning of the 10th Cen tury describes the enclosure as a hexagonal wall, rising within three cubits of the ceiling of the portico, clothed in marble for more than a man's height, and above that height daubed with the unguent called Khatuk. This may be supplemented from Istakhri who calls it a lofty houses without a door. That there are no gravestones or visible tombs within is certain from what is recorded of occasions when the place was opened up for repairs. Ibn Zubair and Samhudi speak of a small casket adorned with silverMAD—MAD 1123 fixed in the eastern wall, which was supposed to be opposite the head of the Prophet; while a silver nail in the south wall indicated the point to which the corpse faced, an from which the salutation of worshippers was to be addressed. The European fa ie of the coffin suspended by magnets is totally unknown to moslem tradition, ihe smaller chamber of Fatima is comparatively modern. In the time of Ibn Zubair and ot i n Batuta (unless the latter, as is so often the case, is merely copying his predecessor) theie was only a small marble trough north of the raudhah (or grave) which is said to be the house of Fatima or her grave. It is more probable that Fatima was buried in the Baki where her tomb was also shown in the 12th Century. The mosque was again extended by the Khalif Mahdi in A. D. 781 and was biirnt down in 1256. Of its appearance before the fire we have two authentic accounts by Ibn 'Abd Rabbih earlv in the 10th Century, and by Ibn Zubair who visited it in 1184. The old mosque had a much finer and more regular appearance than the present one ; the interior walls were richly adorned with marble and mosaic arabesques of trees an the like, and the outer walls with stone marquetry ; the pillars of the south portico (seventeen in each row) were in white plaster with gilt capitals, the other pillars were of marble. Ibn 'Abd Rabbih speaks of eighteen gates, of which in Ibn Zubair's time as at present all but four were walled up. There were then three minarets. After the fire which took place just at the time of the fall of the Khalif ate, the mosque long lay in a miserable condition. Its repair was chiefly due to the Egyptian Sultans especial ly'to Qait Bey, whose restoration after a second fire in 1481 amounted almost to a complete reconstruction. Of the old building nothing seems to have remained but some of the columns and part of the walls. The minarets have also been rebuilt and two new ones added. The great dome above the tomb, the railing round it, and the pulpit all date from Qait Bey's restoration. , n j • The suburbs which occupy as much space as the city proper and are partly walled m lie south-west of the town from which they are separated by an open space, ^he halting place of caravans. Through the suburbs runs the watercourse called Wadi liuthan, a tributary of Wadi Kanat, which the Yanbu road crosses by a stone bridge. The suburbs are the quarter of the peasants. Thirty or forty families with their cattle occupy a single courtyard (hosh) and form a kind of community often at feud with its neighbours. The several clans of Al-Madinah must have live in much the same way at the time of the Prophet. The Turks after the conquest of Egypt held Al-Madinah for a time with a firmer hand, but their rule grew wexk and was almost nominal long before the Wahhabis took the qlty in 1804. A Turko-Egyptain force retook it in 1812, and the Turks now maintain a pasha with a military establishment, while the Qadhi and chief Agha of the mosquo are sent from Constantinople. In late years the influence of the Turkish Government has been much strengthened, an important factor in this connection being the construc tion of the railway from Syria to Al-Madinah which was effected in 1908. There are two Colleges and many mosque-schools in the town. The climate of Al- Madinah is one ofextermes the summer being very hot and the winter long and vigorous. The rains begin in October and last off and on for six months. MAD IN AH— A small town in 'Iraq on the right bank of the Euphrates about 12 miles above Qurnah village: under Turkish rule it was the headquarters of a Nahiyah of the same name in the Qadha of Qurnah and the seat of a harbour master. Some maize is exported and the reeds and mats used at Basrah Town mostly come from Madinah. Madinah has perhaps 2,500 inhabitants. Near the town, on the South side of the river are^ great marshes known as Hor-al-Yazair which communicate with the Shatt-al- Arab. From these marshes the water of J the Euphrates in flood time finds it way down to the tract between Zubair and Basrah. (Murphy.)

The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have docks and workshops at this place, where they have been established for many years. One of the river steamers of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company was lately reconstructed here but as a rule the Kut-al-Farangi yard is only used for small repairs, and the heavy work of the Company is carried out at their Baghdad premises. There are two cemeteries one belonging to the Company and the other to the Anglican community of Basrah • and a native village and some brick kilns also exist. Some of the Arab inhabitants emigrated in 1914 to Persia to avoid conscription by the Turks for military service. On the south side of the place is an insignificant creek which does not run very far inland : on the north side is a channel by which water from KhamMyah on the Euphrates is said to reach the Shatt-al-'Arab. The frontage of Kut-al-Farangi on the Shatt-al- 'Arab seems to have been reclaimed at no very distant time and it is now again threaten ed by the encroachments of the river. Magil is the terminus of the Basrah-Nasiriyah railway and possesses several berths for ocean steamers, as well as numerous wharves with cranes.

The original inhabitants were a few Bani Rabi'ah Arabs who migrated from Khan-al-BIr ; but Mahmudiyah is now a considerable and increasing place with 11 Khans, a dozen shops, about 150 houses, and a population of perhaps 1,000 souls. The Khans are mostly defensible, one of them being partly loop-holed and provided with circular towers at the four corners ; in the aggregate they would provide accommoda tion for about 1,000 men and the same number of animals.

The island is a mere sand bank 2 miles long by 1 broad, devoid of vegetation, except mangroves, and of potable water ; the mangroves grow on a mud-flat, screening the island from view seawards and extending round f of its circumference. The village consists of about 50 huts of mangrove boughs and there is one mosque roughly built of stone. The inhabitants are Hikman and a few Jannabah; they maintain a perpetual feud with the A1 Wahibah of the adjoining mainlaind ; thrie semi-insular position protects them from sudden attacks.

Mahot is the principal trade centre of this part of the 'Oman coast and in particular the market in which the inhabitants of the coast from Masirah to the Kuria Muria islands purchase their dates ; its unimportance is in proportion to that of the district which it serves. There are no regular shops and few large boats ; but caravans constantly visit the place from Adam, tho nearest point in 'Oman Proper, distant from Mah5t, 7 days' journey by way of Wadi Halfain which reaches the sea, it is believed, a little to the north-east of Mahot. These caravans bring dates and cotton twist and take away fish. Animals at Mahdt are 10 camels, 10 donkeys, 20 cattle and 30 sheep and goats ; there are 4 Baghlahs and 20 small fishing boats. In former days Mahot was a great place for the disembarkation of slaves, who were then smuggled into 'Oman by way of Wadi Halfain. Native sailing vessels passing between Aden or Zanzibar and the Persian Gulf used some times to call and ship cargoes of salt, made at Has Sauqirah or Kh5r-al-Milh, or of salt fish, shark-fins and tortoise-shell, but this has become unusual.

The villages of Fifah, Haim and Samkat lie in the basin of Wadi Maih near the watert- shed between it and Wadi Sarain. They are about 6 miles from the left bank of Wadi Maih and their drainage enters it between Mahaidith and Khafaiji. Fifah is the mos- westem and Samkat the most eastern of the three. These settlements are stated to be at present unoccupied. The settled population of Wadi Maih, exclusive of the village of Yiti which is on the coast, appears to be about 3,000 souls. Wadi Maih has only one important affluent, Wadi Jannah or Hatat, which joins it on its left bank from the south-west immediately below Tawllah. This valley contains the1144 mai—maj village of- Hajir on its bank a few hundred yards above Taw lah: Hajir was founded about 1875 by Saiyid Hilal-bin-Ahmad who purchased the water supply from the B' ' Wahaib : it consists of 30 stone houses and huts ( f the Bani Wahaib to whom part oHt still belongs : it produces dates in considerable quantities, also melons, limes figs and mangoes : livestock are 30 camels, 40 donkeys, 20 cattle and 200 sheep and ao'ats For 8 miles above the junction Wadi Jannah lies in Saih Hatat, whence its alternative name ■ it is formed by the junction at the head of Saih Hatat of two short vaUeys, Wadi Qahza from 'Aqabat-al-Qahza on th3 west and Wadi 'Amdah from 'Aqabat 'Amdahmoreto the east. Each of these valleys contains a route from Matrah to Wadi Tay n; the passe? of both are difficult that of 'Amdah especially so. Wadi-al-Hilu joins Wadi Maih on its east bank immediately bolow Yiti ; but the junction being so near the coast, it can hardly be reckoned a tributary. Wadi Maih below Tawilah contains a fast-Howing stream which irrigates the two villages of Mizra', but its aspect in its lower course is generally barren. The uppermost 7 villages are said to possess 30,000 date palms ; and frankin cense is stated to be obtained in their vicinity, but this is doubtful.

A thick grove of palm trees extends a short distance eastward from the anchorage and detached clumps of trees in like manner to the northward. MA J i LIS (U mm-al)— A spring in the Qatlf oasis {q. v.), in eastern Arabia. MAJAMILAH (R as)— The northern extreme of a sandbank off the Yemen coast, Red Sea; it is from 3 to 10 feet high and was formerly connected with the mainland by a narrow strip of sand about 12 miles long in a south-south-easterly direction, thus forming Khor Ghulaifiqah on its eastern side. The sea has, however, washed an opening through this peninsula into the khor, about 5| miles southward of the point, through which there is reported to be as much as 3 fathoms of water.— {R. S. and G. of A. Pilot.) MAJAMIR (Al)— A depressed tract in northern Arabia ; it is traversed by Sha'Ib {or Wadi-al) Hisib the bed of which is here studded with curious flat-topped mounds. Some of these mounds, from which the surrounding sand has been washed away, are 40 feet high. The Majamir tract is crossed by the western (Wallin's ) route between Karbala and Hail, at a point about one-third of the way from Bir Samlt to the wells of Hazil.— [L&lt;iac,hman, 1910). MAJAR (or M ijakb)— A locality on the right bank of the Tigris {q. v.) between 'Amarah and Qal'at Salih . MAJAR (or M ijarb ) MINSHAD— A canal on the right bank of the Tigris {q. v.) in the locality of the same name. MAJAR-AL-KABIR— A very large reed-hut village of the Al Bii Muhammad tribe in 'Iraq, on the right bank of the Tigris about 12 miles by water below 'Amarah Town. It is the head quarters of a'Nahiyah similarly named in the Qadha of 'Amarah and has a bazaar. Maize, rice and Mash are cultivated ; the land is marshy ; and the only animals kept are buffaloes and cattle. There are about 40 ah ops. C52(w)G3B 7hMAJAE-AL-KABlR A few miles above this place on the same bank is Majar-as-Sagh'rr, a similar village of about half the size, situated in the domains of the Dairat-as-Sanlyah and formerly the seat of a Mudir. # . , ,r . There are two canals, the larger of which is of some size, called respectively Majar -al- Kabir and Majar -as-Saghir, in the neighbourhood of these two villages; they join up with the Hammar Lake a little to the east of the point where the Shatt-al-Bada ah reaches it, but they have not yet been surveyed and their courses are not clearly under- stood. The following article contains most of what is known about these waterways. The whole canal was formerly the property of the Turkish Government. As is the case with all the big streams flowing out of the Tigris, the Majar Kabir has built up for itself by the gradual deposit of silt a central plateau along which its waters and those of its subsidiary streams run. This central plateau is commanded by its waters only at the time of the full flood during the hot season, and in the cold weather is always dry. Each of the subsidiary streams flows down into low land at its tail known as i5aza }iz or Danaib, which is always wet. Thus round every channel is a gradation of slopes, the highest being fitted for barley and wheat (which is very little grown), the lower land being fitted for millet after the greatest heights of the floods have subsided, and the lowest land of all fitted for rice. The rice land itself may again be sub-divided into two classes : the higher land well commanded by water throughout the rice season, but not always under water ; and the lower land which is always under a certain amount of water. In the higher rice-land the rice is cultivated broad-cast and is called Afli or Harfi. In the lower rice-land in which there are always 2 or 3 inches of water, the rice is transplanted and is called ShittaL Beyond the strip in which the Shittal rice is sown, is everywhere the unreclaimed Hor or swamp full of reeds. The main stream of the Majar Kabir reaches from its mouth about half way between Qala'at Salih and 'Amarah down to the markaz or official headquarters, a distance by river of about 16 miles. In May, 1915, it was a channel through a Hor—the Hor being 5 or 6 feet deep. Below the headquarters and town of Majar Kabir it branches, the western branch being known as the Adal, and the south-eastern as the Wadiyah. The Adal again branches some way lower down into three big streams, the Jindala, the Adal and the Tafshah. The Majar Kabir runs almost parallel to the main Tigris river, so that the town itself is only about 5 miles from the bank of the Tigris, and the tail end of the Wadiyah, or south-eastern branch, almost coincides vith the tail end of the Hafirah canal, which takes out from the Tigris opposite Qala'at Salih. On the other hand the Jindala or westernmost branch of the Majar Kab'r sweeps round until the tail coincides with that of the Tabar or Majar Sagh'r, the mouth of which is not far below 'Amarah, and with that of the Bitairah, the mouth of which is above 'Amarah. The Majar-as-Saghir, is free from weeds and deep enough to take a boat of 5 or 6 feet draft. The Majar-al-Kab'r is a good waterway from its head above Abu Sidrah to a little below Majld-al-Khallfah's village, which is given as 13 miles by road from Qala'at Salih. Its danaibs are, however, useless as waterways for anything but mashhUfs and light bellums as there are several branches and no depth of water. The largest danaib is the Adil which is about 8 miles in length before it loses itself in the Hor. The Majar-al- Kabir is 4 hours' journey by mashhvf from the Tigris to Majid's village and 2 hours on to the place where it bifurcates. Some authorities say that the Jindalah forms dhanaib of the Majar-as-Saghir. 1. The Abu Judeiah canal, with its bazayiz of Charba. 2. The Hashariyah. 3. The Ae'mi Canal, which sweeps round to the south until its tail-ends or bazayiz touch those of the Adal much lower down. 4. The Khar, a short canal with its rice lands not far ofi the main stream. 5. The Lao'lah. 6. The Adal. 7. The Jindalah. 8. The Tafshah. The most valuable of these above the Adal appears to be the Hashariyah. The Ae mi has recently silted up, and its rice lands are at present uncultivated. On the left eide coming from the Tigris there are few important streams until a short way above the town of Majar Kabir itself, when tho Abu Hantah is met. Below the headquarters is theMAJ—MAJ 1147 Wadiyali which is the richest stream of the whole Muqata'ah, ending in the fertile rica lands of Khashaf and Buraidiyah. Tho biggest settlements of tribesmen are at Hashariyah under Majid's brother, Mushattat, 0 at the headquarters itself under Ma]id, at Wadiyah ha f way down tho Wadiyah branch under Araimish-al-Mansur, Majid's maternal uncle, and on the Adal under Hamud, another of Majid's brothers. The settlement of Wadiyah under Araimish seems to be the biggest of all, and much exceeds in size that of the headquarters under Majid. Besides the Majar Kabir stream and its subsidiary streams, there are several important canals taking out of the main Tigris itself between the Hafirah MuqaCah and the mouth of the Majar Kabir. The first of these is the Ajuliyah, then the Umm Aranib, and third the Rubaihiyah. These appear to have no important rice lands at their tails and to be almost entirely devoted to spring crops. MAJAR-AL-KABIR— One of the Nahiyahs of the ' Amarah Qadha [q. v.) in 'Iraq. MAJAR-AS-SAGHiR— One of tho Nahiyahs of the 'Amarah Qadha (g. v.) in Iraq. Trad of KJmzainah-al-Hamish. The Bitairah runs almost due south from tho Tigris before emptying itself into the Hor. On the right or west bank is the Muqata'ah of the A1 Bu Darraj (Gassat-ash-Sharqi), The Hor Gassat-ash-Sharqi is enclosed by the A1 Bu Darraj lands. El Khazainah and Al Ha'mish tract, —At the foot of the Bitairah before it enters the big Khor, on the right bank with Hor Gesat-ash-Sharqi on its north, the Bitairah on the east, the big Bitairah Hor on its south and the desert JazTrah on the west; devoted to wheat and barley cultivation. .46m Siba or Baghdad TvfaijiyaJu —On left bank of the Bitairah, the Abu Hallanah Muqata'ah reaches down to the Tomb of Madosh about half way between the point where the Bitairah leaves tho Tigris and the Hor. The first 'Azairij land is that watered by the Abu Siba, a large canal taking off about 5 miles from the Tigris. The greater part of its lengthy is rice land watered by the Abu Siba and is known as Baghdad Tufaijiyah. 'Awaiji and ChalbaL 'Awaiji and Chalbat; a tract comprising the lands of Rughl, Nishabah, Gusamah and Ra'ash, the last and southernmost of which borders on the great Bilairah Hor. It is part wheat, part barley, part rice, watered by the big branches called Shakairiyat, about 5 miles from the Tigris, and Talaa, about 7 miles from the Tigris. Umm-uch-Chir and Bdb-al-Hawcu The Bitairah Hor is about 6 miles broad but nowhere except immediately below tho Batera is it more than about 1 foot in depth. At about 4 miles E.-S.-E. from the debouc hure of the Bitairah the Umm-uch-Chir takes off from the northern bank of the Bitairah Hor and forms the south-eastern boundary of the Ra'ash lands watering a largo rice tract. It runs towards the north-east, and falls into a Hor half way between the Tabar, or Majar- as-Saghir, and the Bitairah. Large mashhvfs can pass up the Umm-uch-Chir channel across this central Hor .and up the Kubaiyir (one of the branches of the Tabar). Tho mouth of the Umm-uch-Chir is badly silted up from the floods of 1915. At about 4 miles from the Umm-uch-Chir entrance the big channel of the Bab-al- Hawa, takes off from the north (eastern ?) bank of the Bitairah Hor and runs N.-E. into the Hor Jindalah at the bottom of the Jindalah, the most westerly branch of tho Majar-al-Kabir, There is a through connection for big mashhvfs between the Bitairah Hor, by the Bab-al-Hawa, into the Majar-al-Kabir. On the south shore of the broad Bitairah Hor opposite the Umm-uch-Chir and Bab-al- Hawa lands, and separated from them by 6 or 7 miles of water, is a large rice tract entirely surrounded by water comprising Karaichi, Haddam, and Abu Dhahab. The principal place is Haddam where resides a sfave of Shaway as his agent. A mound of ruins close to Haddam, where gold ornaments or coins are often found after rain, gives its name to Abu Dhahab. The whole of the Karaichi—Haddam—Abu Dhahab tract is liable to submergence and has to be protected against tho Bitairah Khoc by expensive dykes formed of clav, lice, straw and xccds. 7a2MSB 1148 MAJAE-AS-SAGHfK Umm-az-Zora and Laqdqah. tJmm-az-Zora is a long island lying in the middle of the Bitairah Hor to the north-weSt of Haddam. It is intersected by numerous channels and mostly covered with tamarisk having also a certain amount of rice cultivation. Laqaqah, is a very extensive rice tract lying south-west of Khazainah and almost due west of Umm-az-Zora from which it is separated by a comparatively narrow strip of Hor. It abuts on the desert Jazirah. Like Haddam it has to be protected by ex pensive dykes. Cereal land# of 'Audah a)id Shaltaniyah (,Bardah, Buraidah, Daivaimah, Al-Bazunand Al Aim). South of the main Bitairah Hor, and partially screened from ifc by the Haddam block, lies the smaller Hor-at-Tcira. Round the shores of the latter lie the extensive wheat, barley and millet lands known as 'Audah ; they are, beginning from the north, Bardah, Buraidah, Al-Bazun and Al 'Audah (sic). The Muntafiq tribe of Al-Bazun under Shaikh Fa lib ibn Abu 'Oja cultivate them. The 'Audah lands seem to be at present (February 1916) entirely submerged. Shattaniyah is a large isolated tract, lying on the southern side of the Bitairah Hor, about 10 miles to south-east of Haddam, and forms the extreme outpost of cultivation in the tail-lands or bazayiz of the Bitairah. It is separated from the Hor-at-Tafra by about 12 miles of desert called Al-Khidhr, which is dotted with ruined mounds called Al-Hiffa or HuSa. The soil here is very rich and has two crops yearly, one millet and the other wheat and barley. Shattaniyah is protected against the Hor by exceptionally big dykes faced with camel-thorn. Bitairah watering. It seems evident that the flow of the water in the Bitairah might be diminished afld regulated with advantage ; not only is the rice cultivation liable to be swamped, but the extensive barley and wheat crops in 'Audah and Shattaniyah are cftsn drowned. The Al-Bu-Darraj muqata'ahs lie on the right bank of the Tigris between the 'Azairij Muqata'ahs of Maj'ar-as-Saghir (on the Tabar and Bitairah rivers) to the east, another Bani Lam Muqatamah of 'Ali Gharbi and Gutba beyond the Dujailah river on the north-west. To the south-west they are bounded by the desert Jazirah stretching to the Hai, while due south is the muqata'ah of 'Audah Shattaniyah. There is a comparatively small enclave round the town of Kumait on the Tigris which forms the mvqata'ah of Gassat-al-Gharbi. Probably |th of the apparent area of the muqata'ahs is taken up by the two immense Hors or shallow lakes, the Hor Gassat- esh-Sharqi on the east, fed by the Safhah and Safaihah channels from the Tigris, and by the channels from the Bitairah, and the Hor Ataifiyah on the west, fed mainly by channels from the Dujailah river. These Hors contract and expand with the volume of water in the Tigris and its channels, and have to be restrained by a vast system of dykes from flooding the comparatively narrow rim of cultivated land round them. When they contract after the summer floods, excellent crops of millet are grown in the damp soil left bare. Rice cannot be cultivated in them, because their waters do not hold enough of the silt essential to rice cultival ion. They contain no reeds, the reeds having, it is said, been killed by excessive floods about the year 1903. There is in the winter a strip of dry land between the Hor Gassat-ash-Sharqi and the Bitairah river and between the Hor Ataifiyah and the Hor Gassat -ash-Sharqi—but in the summer the two Hors coalesce and a vast sheet of water stretches uninterruptedly from the Dujailah to the Bitairah. 1 he rim round the Hors is devoted to wheat and barley in the winter and spring and to millet in the autumn,—the only rice land beinc a small tract near Kumait. The Gassat-ash-Sharqi Muqata'ah consists of the strip immediately north of the Hor Gassat-esh-Sharqi between the Hor and the Tigris which is watered by the Safhah and Safaihah canals. The name Gassat-ash-Sharqi is only an official name and the tract is locally known as Safhah Safaihah. It is about a mile broad in the cold weather and grows good barley and wheat crops. There is practically no cultivation on the strip between Hor Gassat-ash-Sharqi and the Bitairah river, which is salt land apparently covered with tamarisk. The Jazrah Muqata'ah comprises all the lands on the south of the Hors Gassat-ash- i Sharqi and Ataifiyah between them and the Jazirah desert. These lands, beginningmajab-as-saghlr 1149 from the east, are named Khazainah and Al-Hamish, Jifjafah, Jafijafat ( a barren tract) Tel Dukhn and Harair. (а) Khazainah and Al-Hamish. —These lands form a peninsula jutting out from the desert Jazirah between the Hor Gassat-ash-Sharqi on the north and the big Bitairah Hor on the south, with the Bitairah in the east. (б) Jifjafah. —A strip about 13 miles long and varying in breadth from J to | of a mile stretching along the shore of the Gassat-ash-Sharqi to the west of Khazainah- Wheats barley and millet are grown. (e) Tel Dukhn. —A large stretch of arable land 8 miles by 3 miles bordering on Hor Ataifiyah. It contains a series of mounds of ancient bricks and pottery, and several sweet- welK Very fertile but the greater f art of it is flooded by the breaking of dykes every second or third year, and when this happens the cultivation of it is abandoned, and Harair, the tract beyond it, is cultivated instead. (d) Harair lies immediately to the north-west of Tel Dukhn, but contains higher ground. Sadraniyah and Baghailat Muqata 1 ahs. These two are separated from Harair, the most westerly of the Jazirah lands, by a stretch of desert about 20 miles across which in February 1916 contained several large lakes of rain water, known as mughaddarat. Baghailat is about 6 square miles in area, and Sadramiyah about 3. They lie side by side on the southern or left hand shore of the Dujailay stream. Devoted to wheat and barley only. The Shaihaniyah Muqatdah. (Again a purely official name) comprises the lands of Bidat Saiyyah, tTmin Atna, Shaiyah and Thabi, bordering the Dujailah stream between Sadraniyah and its mouth at the Mudalil canal, and are bounded by the Dujailah on the north and the Khor Ataifiyah on the south-east. Kather swampy, so that wheat and barley is precarious. Good grazing for sheep. Kumait Muqata 1 ah*. This is the home farm of the Albu Darraj Shaikh. Boundaries—South-west Thabi, and Thabi canal. North-east by Najm's muqata'ah of Gassat-al-Gharbi, North-west by Midaihl canal, having the Kumait river flowing through its midst, and the Hor Ataifiyah on the south-east at its back. The fort of the Shaikh lies on the left or north east bank of the Kumait river. The Ouiba lands {Bani Lam Muqata:ah) of Ali Gharbi. The Gutba lands lie on the right or north-west shore of the Dujailah river, and are part of the Bani Lam Muqata'ah of 'Ali Gharbi. • •■■•4 Old Nahr Alchdhar in the Jazirah Desert. All along the edges of Jazrah stretches a line of mounds, the remains of cities formerly grouped on the lands of the ancient Nahr Akhdhar or Green Canal, which took off from the Dujailah (believed to have them been the main Tigris stream). Notes on the Bitairah and Dujailah. Its length before entering the Hor is not more than 8 miles. The Hor varies in depth but the greater part is not more than 1 foot. It is said that Mahailahs can never use the Hor except in very high floods. The Dujailah. From Sadraniyah to the Tigris a fine stream, but not at present (February, 191G) deep enough for anything larger than a large Mashhuf. The banks are covered with excellent brushwood.

This bay, with the exception of a sunken rock half a mile off-shore on its north-westrn side, is free from danger; the soundings are regular and the shore bold to approach. The little village of Majdahah is in the eastern angle of the bay ; it affords no supplies and the water is indifferent. It is the residence of a chief, a tributary to the Sultan of the Wahidi tribe, who derives the prin cipal part of his revenue from the guano on the islets. The inhabitants of Majdahah are almost wholly dependent on other ports for food. (Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot.) MAJID.— A section of the Bani Tamlm tribe (q.v.) of Najd.

Except the Sulutah, in regard to whom there is doubt, the Bani Malik are believed to have reached Qatar from Persia ; and, being Maliki Sunnis, they are accordingly classed as Huwalah. They are, however, if the Sulutah be excluded, few in number, and they have no tribal organization. MALIK (B ani ) (II)— Generally pronounced Bani Malich : an Arab tribe of 'Iraq, not very numerous but somewhat widely disseminated. On the Tigris the Bani Malik are found between 'Azair and Q jmah village ; but here on either side of the river, the marshes behind them are tenanted by the Ma'adan and they are confined to the neighbourhood of the actual banks. On the Euphrates they occur at various places from Suq-ash-Shuyukh down to Q'irnah village.

The town is surrounded by date groves except on the south and is characterised by a tall tower, call Minarah, in the Bilad quarter. The houses are of mud and stone, some of them with upper storeys. Wheat, gram and sugar are grown in the oasis, which also produces grapes, limes, and quinces, but neither almonds not oranges. The date palms are estimated at 20,000, camels, at 30, donkeys at 100, goats at 1,000 and sheep at 2,000 ; cattle are very few. The cultivation is irrigated by hot springs.

MANAKHAH— A town in Yemen, on the Hodaidah-Sana'a road, situated 88 miles'by road from the former and 63 from the latter. It is built at an elevation of 7,500 feet above sea-level and is sometimes known as the Gibraltar of Yemen because, in addition to occupying a naturally strong site on a mountain massif, it is in itself a collection of forts and stone-built fortress-like houses. The town and district is administered by a Qaimmaqam, whose jurisdiction extends from Hajailah to Suq-al-Khamis. The population of Manakhahis about 7,000, including 1,000 Jews—Harris gives, 5,000 inhabitants excluding troops. The place would be well able to withstand siege, for fertile gardens with good crops overhang the precipices which fall sheer from the town on one side, and orchards and fields of fodder cover the slopes of Jebel Shi bam on the other side.BMBMamMHwitnuiimiiimn i ^ 1160 MANAMAH The military hospital is at the upper end of the town, and somewhat lower clown are the tall oblong barracks and magazine ; the Government buildings, Hukumah, and post office are substantial buildings ; all these are supplied with a very excellent water laid on to them by a covered conduit leading from a good spring in a ravine in Jabal Shibam. There are also a number of other perennial springs of good water which adequately supply the town in general. . The streets are steep and often just lead over bare and slippery rock—m some instances they resemble badly -constructed staircases. Harris says of Manakhah: ' Of all the places it has ever been my lot to see, this is the most wonderfully situated. The town is perched on a narrow strip of mountain that joins two distinct ranges, and it forms the watershed of two great valleys. So narrow is the ridge on which the town stands that the walls of the houses on both sides seem almost to hang over a precipice.' MANAMAH— The principal town and commercial metropolis of Bahrain ; it can hardly, however, be described as the political capital, for the seat of Government is where the Shaikh is, and he resides during the greater part of the year at Muharraq iown, not at Mana- Situation and harbour. —Manamah is situated on the coast of Bahrain Island at its north-eastern corner, on the northernmost point of the island ; it lies less than 2 miles south-west by west of the town of Muharraq, from which it is separated by the tidal channel connecting the Manamah anchorage with Khor-al-Qalai ah. The harbour of Manamah, * the only one in Bahrain used by steam vessels, is sheltered by the Bahrain and the Muharraq islands on the south and east respectively, by the Fasht-al-Jarim on the north, and by the Fasht Khos Fasht on the north-west. The outer anchorage, the nearest point to which steamers of 19 feet draught can approach the town, lies 4 miles north-west of Manamah ; smaller vessels can run up to an inner anchorage less than 2 miles off shore in the same direction. The water of the harbour is clear, and the bottom over the greater part of it appears to consist of white sand in patches interspersed with flat coral rock. The bottom shelves very gradually and regularly up to the town, and even boats, at low water, cannot get within J of a mile of the beach, but are obliged to discharge their passengers and cargo by means of donkeys that come alongside ; these donkeys, 30 or 40 in number and belonging to the large Bahrain breed, have been specially trained to work in the sea. A feature of the harbour is the number of fish-weirs and nets which are always set.f General aspect and buildings. —Including the suburbs of Ilas-ar-Rumman on the north-east and Na'im-al-Kabirah on the south-west, Manamah now extends 1| miles along the sea-front, and it has a depth inland of about J a mile. The general aspect of the town is damp, squalid and depressing. The better houses are built of small stones cemented together with mud or inferior mortar, which, failing out, give them a rickety as well as an unwholesome appearance ; some of the tenements are roomy, but often a good deal of the internal space is devoted to business offices and godowns. The bazaar, in the centre of which is the market place, is a filthy labyr inth of narrow lanes lined by shops and generally covered over with mats to keep out the sun. The habitations in the outskirts are for the most part mat huts with sloping roofs, standing in courtyards surrounded by hurdles of upright date fronds. There are but few really good buildings. The best are the new British Political Agency towards the north-east end, between the town proper and Ras-ar-Rumman ; Qal-at-ad- Dlwan or Manamah fort, the Shaikh's summer residence, a large construction in good repair with several bastions, standing in the open plain behind the town between it and the date gardens ; a neat and well built mansion belonging to his son Shaikh Hamad, partly upper-storeyed, which is situated near the fort but somewhat further inland ; and a large house with strong and high walls, situated near the south-west end of the town and occupied until his flight in 1905 by Shaikh 'Ali-bin-Ahmad, a junior member of the ruling family. The existing mosques are singularly plain and unpretentious, •For the harbour and its approaches see Admiralty Plan No. 2377 — 20. ,.tSome remarks on the harbour by Admiral Atkiuson-WiUes, 11.Is' will bo found in the Government of India's rohtical Proceedings for June 1904.MANlMAH 1161 with^ dwarf minarets only about 12 feet high ; a new Jami' mosque, however, is now in course of erection which will be a much finer building than any of them. There are now no trees in the town; but on the side towards the American hospital traces exist of a date grove which appears to have been watered by a falaj from a spring in the Qal'at-ad-Diwan. Large refuse heaps abound, especially in the suburbs. About 1 mile south of Manamah is an old shrine which is visited by Shi'ah women during the night; it consists of a stone with a hollow top in which the devotees deposit rice and eggs. Defences. —Except for Manamah fort, already mentioned, which is badly placed and of no modem value, the town is open and undefended both from land and sea.

The better classes at Manamah buy their drinking water from camelmen of Rifa- ash-Sharqi and Rifa'-al-Gharbi who bring it for sale from the Hanaini and Umm Ghuwaifah wells of their respective villages. The water used by the poorer inhabitants if. procured from one of two sources, Quful and 'Ain Muqbil; the former of these is a cistern, about 1 mile west of the fort, which is filled by the surplus water of several springs ; the latter is a well sunk in the coral rock between the British Political Agency and the American Mission, in open ground belonging to Haji-Muqbil-adh-Dhakari, the leading Najdi merchant. The water of Quful is always contaminated by the ingress and washing of men and animals, while that of 'Ain Muqbil is natrurally very brackish ; but the servants of the Political Agency get their drinking water from the first, and the animals of the Agency are watered at the second. Water from both is hawked about the town by carriers ; that from Quful fetches one pice per goatskin. For washing purposes nearly every house or courtyard in Manamah possesses a shallow well in which the water stands at about 6 feet below the surface. Trade and shipping. —Manamah exists chiefly by its trade, which forms the bulk of that described in the article on the Bahrain Principality. There is considerable dealing in shark's skin. Locusts are freely sold in the bazaars as an article of food, being pickled and pressed into barrels. The bazaar contains about 450 shops.

Maslrah is of irregular oblong form, about 40 miles in length from north-north east to south-south-west and lies parallel to the coast, from which it is distant about 10 miles. Constricted in the middle to about 4 miles in breadth, the island widens out above and below this point to 10 miles and again tapers towards each extremitv. The eastern or ' outward ' side of the island is called Dhahiriyah and the western or ' channel ' side Khorlyah. The sound which divides Masirah from the mainland is so shallow that the greater part of it is dry at low water ; it is navigable only on the side towards Masirah. The channel is used by native vessels of about 40 tons. A chain of hills traverses Masirah longitudinally from end to end sending ridges down to all the principal capes, while shorter spurs protrude in different directions over the island. The highest summit, Jabal Madhrub near the north-east comer, attains an altitude of 620 feet; hardly any of the peaks in the southern half exceed 300 feet and in the narrow waist of the island the hills are low and undulating. Flat land is'almost confined to the west side of the island, where it occuTs in the shape of sandy plains that extends from the base of the hills to the sea and are raised only a few feet above sea level. The rocks of Masirah are chiefly igneous, of euphotide and diorite with here and there small tracts of limestone raised upon them. Copper is found in man V places mostly among green earthy dioritos and in low trap hills ; it occurs also as malachite' both disseminated and in veins. Traces exist in some localities of ancient workings and smelting furnaces. In the northern half of the island is a tabular bed of limestone 2 miles long by £ a mile broad, which rests upon greenstone and is elevated about 400 feet above the level of the sea ; both in horisontality and in colour it forms a marked contrast with the dark, rugged igneous rocks around and beneath it On the inner side trbSow\e to e»Atf ddIe ' ^ Water 18 0bt '* inable '&gt;™ghout the year at a few Masirah is almost destitute of vegetation.

There are sheep here and a few cattle. Nil.1182 MASlRAH The inhabitants of Maslrah subsist on fish and turtle which they catch themselves, on dates from 'Oman Proper and Batinah, and on rice from India which is brought by boats from Sur, When provisions run short they obtain dates from Mah5t. The women and children eat shell-fishes. Domestic animals are sheep and goats, which are not numerous on account of the scarcity of pasture ; also dogs, cats and fowls. In the monsoon the 'northern end of Maslrah island is (or was till lately) frequented by tribesmen from the mainland who came, under pretext of fishing, to indulge in wreck ing and other nefarious practices ; among these were the A1 Bu 'Isa Bedouins of the Ja'alan district. The massacre of the crew of the ' Baron Inverdale ' at Jidufah in 1904 was committed by these summer immigrants. The exports of Masirah are tortoise-shells, shark-fins and dried fish, all of which go to Bombay in Sur boats ; and the principal import is cotton cloth brought by the same vessels. The people extract porpoise oil. The statement that they deal in ambergris is now incorrect: none has been found for over 40 years. The following article brings out some additional information regarding Maslrah island. (South extreme, latitude 20° 10' N., Long. 58° 38' E.) From its southern end, Masirah island is about 36 miles long in a north-north-easterly direction by 10 miles wide, and has an area of nearly 200 square miles. It is from 8 to 12 miles distant from the mainland, between which and it are many islets, shallow banks, and rocky patches, leaving only narrow navigable channels. The island is generally of a hilly aspect, but low in the centre and at the northern . extreme ; see view on plan. The hills form clusters of small peaks, the greatest height being 620 feet and the average about 400 feet. Approaching the island from the north ward or north-eastward, the most conspicuous hill is Jabal Madhrub, a rounded hill on the northern range 620 feet high and standing amidst a cluster of lesser hills, one of which about 1| miles, north-eastwards of Jabal Madhrub, is named Sharp peak, from its peculiar form. Nearly all the hills are volcanic formation, except some table land in the vicinitv Has Yai, the eastern extreme of the island. The island itself is barren and sterile producing no vegetation beyond two or thre-j date groves and a few pumpkins. The animals found are a few gazelles, hyaenas, jackals and wild asses. Copper ore of a poor quality exists in the southern part of the island near Jabal Sawir ; the remains of smelting furnaces, said to have been used by the Persians many years ago, are still to be seen. The depth is on the eastern side of the island are irregular as regards distance from the shore, but increase gradually to seaward. There are several shallow patches at soma distance from the shore, as hereafter described. Population.—Produce. —The population of Mas'rah island is scanty, amounting probably to about 1,000 souls, chiefly of the Jannabah tribe, and mostly very poor, subsisting chiefly on fish, and formerly thought to be not over friendly to Europeans ; they have no cattle, but possess a few dhows and many fishing-boats. Fish of very excellent quality are plentiful all round the island. Sharks abound, and are caught for their fins and tails, which are dried and exported to Masqat for the Chinese markets. Turtles are very numerous between Mas'rah and the mainland, but more particularly in the neighbourhood of Ghubbat Hash'sh. There are two kinds, the edible, probably the Chelone mydas, and the inedible C. imbricata, or hawk's bill turtle, both common to the Indian Ocean. The latter, or inedible turtle as it is termed from its being so much less fleshly and fat, yields the turtle shell of commerce. The inedible turtle is much scarcer than the edible one. The carapaces of both species are used by the Arab fishermen for fireplace in their boats. Ambergris is sometimes found at Maslrah, as well as on the opposite coast. The sperm whale is common, also several species of cetacea, and myriads of cuttle fish and capha- lopods of all kinds, on which the whale feeds. Climate. —The climate of Masira is generally healthy. In the north-east monsoon the thermometer ranges from 68° to 78° Fahrenheit. Rain is very uncommon, but judging from the enormous water-courses visible in all parts of the island, it must fall heavily at times. East and north coast of Maslrah . —Has Abu Rasas (Lat. 20° 10' N. Long. 58° 38' E.), the southern point of Masirah island, is a low rocky sharp point, having Jabal Sawir, a conspicuous conical hill 468 feet high, about 2 miles north-eastward of it.MASlRAH 1183 From Ras Abu Rasas, the eastern shore of the island trends north-eastward 10| miles to Ras Kaidah, with small rocky points and sandy bays intervening ; the hills rising abruptly from the beach. Ras Dtharri is a projecting rocky point 6 miles north-eastwad of Ras Abu Rasas ; Jabal Dtharri is just within it. The shore, northward of the reefs already mentioned is fairly bold, there being nowhere less than 5 fathoms within one mile of the shore, and though the shore has a narrow rocky fringe there are no outlying dangers until off Ras K^idah. From Ras Kaidah to Ras Zafarnat, 16 miles distant in a north-easterly direction, the coast recedes slightly, but is regular, with a low rocky beach, and with only one small sandy point occurring bet .veen the points named. The shore is safe to approach, the soundings being regular and there being no hidden danger. Reefs.— About 8 cables south-westward from the point is the small breaking patch Shab Abu Rasas, with 5 and 6 fathoms water between it and the point. Shab Matraih, a coral reef with from 3 to 6 feet water, extends U miles westward of Shab Abu Rasas but a narraw 5 fathoms channel divides them. At 1J and 2| miles east-south-eastward from the point and within the 10-fathoms line are two other reefs, the nearest having depths of 2 fathoms, the other 4 or 5 fathoms. As the sea frequently breaks on all these reefs the southern point of the island should not be approached to less than 3 miles. lias Kaidah. —(Lat. 20° 16' N. Long. 58° 47'E.) Is a small rooky point which mav be known by a black double-peaked hill rising close to it. The shore reef extends about 7 cables from the Ras in a north-easterly direction, with only a few feet water over it, and breaking down to 4.j and 6 fathoms at its outer edge. Reef.—A coral reef lies If miles eastward of Ras Kaidah, with depths of 3 to 5 fathom water, and with from 7 to 10 fathoms between it and the shore. When the sea is smooth there is no indication of shoal water but with the slightest swell the sea breaks heavily. Vessels should therefore avoid anchoring on this or any shallow bank round the island. Hakkan. This small village is in a date grove close to the beach, 4 or 5 miles north ward of the Ras Kaidah. About 4 miles northward of Hakkan is the narrow central part of the island where it is only 4 miles across from shore to shore, the land consisting of low undulating hills. Supplies. Fresh water is procurable at the village of Hakkan, also a few pumpkins. Rds Zafarndt. —Less than 2 miles south-westward of Ras Yai, is a rocky point from which the hills rise abruptly. Rds Yai (Latitude 20° 32' North, Longitude 58° 58' East), the eastern extreme of Masirah island, is a bluff point formed by a ridge of hills extending eastward from the centre of the island, of which Jabal Mahrub, 620 feet high, is the highest, most cons- picuous. and of obtuse form. The depths off Ras Yai are 15 fathoms at one mile, the edge of the bank in 100 fathoms being 10 miles off shore. From this point the land trends in a north by west direction for 10 miles to Ras Jidufah at the northern end of the island. Ras-al-J ezlrah —Is a rocky point 3J miles north-north-westward of Ras Yai, between which two points the shore is rocky but free from danger, though the depth is under 3 fathoms when loss than 5 cables from the shore, and a 5 fathoms patch surrounded by 7 and 8 fathoms lies 1^ miles off shore from the centre of the bay. It derives its name from a sandy islet called Jezlrat Janzi, lying close o£E and northward of it. The point is prominently marked by a black cove. From Ras-al-Jezirah, the shore curves westward and then northward, forming a bay between it and Ras Jidufah, 7 miles distant. Rds Jidufah. —(Latitude 20° 42' N. Long. 58° 55' E.) Ras Jidufah, the north-eastern extreme of the island, is a rocky point with two horns 5 cables apart, and a slight indentation between them; a hill of the same name rises immediately from the shore of the bay. Off *his double point, a reef extends half a mile, with shallow water at its edge ; the point should therefore not be approached m any direction near er than one mile. R ee f. In the bay between Ras Jezlrah and Ras Jidufah is a rock awash at low water U miles from the shore, with the southern horn of Ras Jidufah bearing N. \ _W. 4J miles • close round the rocks the depths are and 4 fathoms. The soundings m the bay are regular, there being from 7 to 9 fathoms at 2 miles ofi shore, the depths decreasing gradually towards it.1181: MASlRAH A nrlorage,—There is anchorage in 7 fathoms, sand and rock, about 11 miles north- north-west of Ras Jidufah, but it is said to be bad probably on account of the nature of the bottom, and landing is very difficult from the generally heavy surf and the rocky nature of the shore. Has Hilf. —The north-western point of the island is low and sandy at 1| miles south ward of it, and near the western shore, is Jabal Hilf, a moderately high black hill. The coast between Ras Jidufah and Ras Hilf is fronted by several patches of rocks, dry at low water, extending from a quarter to half a mile off shore. Shoals. —Between N. by W. from Ras Hilf and N. J E. from Ras Jidufah, and distant from 3 to 5 miles from the shore, are five patches with as little as 2^ fathoms on them, between them and the island the depths are from 3| to 7 fathoms. Between the north extreme of Masirah and the mainland, and as far northward a? Shaiballah, the ground is foul, with depths of from 2 to 4 fathoms, on which the sea rolls heavily during the north-east monsoon, rendering this and of the Masirah channel un approachable in that season, except in boats. Clearing mark. —Jabal Jidufah bearing south-south-west leads eastward of all these shoals. Masirah channel and west coast of Masirah island. —The Masirah channel, between Masirah island and the mainland, is about 35 miles long by from 8 to 12 miles wide. Near its northern end, though its width between Ras Shanna on the mainland and Ras Hilf on Masirah island is no loss than 8J miles, its navigable width with a depth of only about 3 fathoms at low water, is restricted to 2| cables or less and it should not be at tempted at all by vessels unless bound to Daua or to Unim Rasas. The channel is used by native vessels of about 40 tons. See Directions, page 547. From Ras Hilf, the north-western point of Masirah, the coast trends south-westward 11 miles to Ras Shaghaf, forming a slight curve and fronted by a bank which dries at low water from 5 to 8 cables off shore, rocky foul ground extending in places from one to two miles from the beach. Kinasat Hilf —Is a shoal, partially dry at low water, between the northern entrance points of the Masirah channel and U miles westward of Ras Hilf with depths of from 3 to 7 fathoms between it and the point. Between it and Dimna reef, extending from the main land shore, the depth is but 1| fathoms, san 1 y bottom, the channel thus lying eastward of Kinasat Hilf and along the western shore of the island. Dawwah. —(Latitude 20° 36'N., Longitude 58° 50'E.) Is the principal village in Masirah, and stands in a date grove close to the shore and 2 miles northward of Ras Shaghaf. It consists of about 150 rudely thatched huts, built of mud and stone, and contains a population of about 600. It is the residence of the Shaikh of the island. The people are mostly very poor and appear to be either fishermen or shepherds ; they are civil and obliging to strangers and have been known, in recent times, to show great kindness to shipwrecked people ; a few of the wealthier class possess date groves on the mainland. II aler. Good water may be obtained by ships' boats from two wells at the northern end of Dawwah, and there is good anchorage for them on the western side of Jazirat- bin-Juwaisim. These wells are surrounded by a conspicuous belt of palm trees about 180 yards in circumference, which trees, when approaching from the northward, are seen long before the village. Good water may also be obtained at Ras Shaghaf, off which there is anchorage in 4 or 5 fahtoms, at from 1 to 1^ miles from the shore. Baiyat-bin-Juwaisim. —Jazirat-bin-Juwaisim is an islet 2 miles from the Masirah shore on and near the eastern edge of Baiyat-bin-Juwaisim which shoal is 7J miles long north east and south-west, by 3 miles wide, and, when surveyed the greater part dried at ow water, but the drying portion is reported to have mucH decreased in size. There is good anchorage for boats on the western side of the island, there being a gap in the reef on its north-western side, which allows boats to get close in. The northern edge of Baiyat-bm-Juwaisim is one mile from Kinasat Hilf, and there are only from 2 to 4 fathoms e ween t em. On either side of the shoal is a navigable channel for small craft, with from 3 to 4 fathoms of water. See directions, page 647. Near the south-western edge o t ' ya in : uwaiSirn &gt; where the general depths are 3 and 4 fathoms, is a small 2 fathoms patch.MASIRAH 1185 From Has Shaghaf the coast trends more southward to the village of Umm Rasas, about 3 miles distant, and from thence 3 miles farther southward and then westward about the same distance forming the deep bight of Umm Rasas. In this bight lies the low sandy island Jazirat Shagha, which cannot be approached within 1J miles on atocount of a bank, dry at low water, extending from the southern shore of the bight and surround ing the island at that distance, between Jazirat Shagha and the eastern shore of the bight is a narrow inlet, presently described. At the southern end of Baiyat-bin-Juwaisim the channels round that reef join, being bordered on the eastern side by the rocky ground extending off Maslrah and, on the west, by the bank of foul ground extending from 6 to 8 miles from the mainland and terminate ing at Jaair? t-al-Hara, one of the Oyster islets. The depth in the channel are from 4 to 8 fathoms, with the exception of one small 3 fathoms patch in mid-channel about miles north-eastwards of Jazirat Sanfar; the width varies from 4 miles off Ras Shaghaf to 7 cables only between the Oyster islets and the rocky bank extending from the Masirah shore northward of Ras Kalban. Umm Rasas —is a small village, containing with Safaij, adjacent to it, about 100 people. The village is fronted by Jazirat Shagha, surrounded by a flat before mentioned. Be tween this flat and the village is an inlet passing close along shore and entered from the northward. It has depths of from l\ to 3 fathoms, runs in 3J miles, and is from 2 to 4 cables wide; by it small craft can get close up to the village. Jahal Safaij —is a conical hill close southward of the village of that name—with the remains of a fort on the summit. From the western point of Umm Rasas bight the coast trends south-westward 8 miles to Ras Kalban; it is rocky and irregular with small projecting points, and, for 7 or 8 cables from the shore, is fronted by a rocky bank with many rocks above water, Ras Kalbdn. —(Latitude 20° 21' N., Longitude 58° 38' E.) Is a low rocky pomt with a sandy beach on either side, from whence the coast trends south 11 miles nearly to Ras Abu Rasas, the southern extreme of Masirah islands. , , , , From Ras Kalban to Ras Abu Rasas, the southern point of the island, described at pa^e 540, the shore is low and sandy, with several low points. At If miles northward of Ras Abu Rasas, and close inshore, are two islets, and 1 J miles further northward are three more islets lying in an east and west direction, with some sunken rocks beyond them, extending altogether nearly 1^ miles from the shore. The whole collectively are called Banat Murshid. , ,, * i-i.- x. « Jebal Kairdn—Or Saddle hill, is a remarkable double-peeked hill, 385 feet high, one mile from the beach, and nearly 4 miles north-eastward from the Ras Kalban. The little village of Kairan is at the south-western foot of the hill. Oyster islets. —North- westward of Ras Kalban are these three rocky islets. Between Jazirat Sanfar, the northern islet, and Jazirat Al-Hara, the next which lies 2 miles south- westward from it, are two patches of sunken rocks and from 2 to 3 fathoms water on the bank between the islands and the rocks. Jaslrat Amkads, the southern islet, lies one mile west -north-west from Ras Kalban, and makes from the south-westward as a patch of sand with a small black rock at its western end. The islet can be seen about 7 miles Shoals. —A shoal about half-a-mile long, oji a south-south-easterly line, and with about If fathoms water, lies with its northern extreme one mile westwards of Jazirat Amkads. Shallow water also extends a short distance northward of the islet. Zanatiyat. —A dangerous group of rocks about 1J miles m extent, with one rock dry at half tide and others with less than 6 feet water over them and from 4 to 6 fathoms around, lies 3 miles south -westward of Ras Kalban. .u „ i n a Other shoal patches of from 2^ to 3 fathoms lie nearly 3 miles south-westward and south-south-westward of Zanatiyat reef. ShA Sanfar. —{Latitude 20° 12' N., Longitude 35° 35' E.) Is a reef ueariy awash 8 cables long north and south by ball a mile wide, and its eentre a.nd s . h ° alest ^ dis ' a ^ from the shore 2| miles, with the south cone of Jabal Sawir bearing S. 82 E. ihi shoal usually breaks, and may be seen from the masthead at a considerable distanc . ' Hassar Walad HamZ.-(Latitude 20° 28' N., Longitude 58° 41' E.) Westward of Umm Rasas and on the edge of the western bank of the channel, is Hassar Walad Hanal, C52(w)GSBwimmmmmmm mmm. MAS—MAS a dangerous sunken rock, with only 2 feet water and steep-to, from which Jabal Kairan bears S. f E. and Jabal Safaij is in line with the southern point at Jazirat Shagha. Kalban is a small village close to the shore, about 5 miles from the southern point of the island. Western shore of Maslrah channel. —For the first 13 or 14 miles from Has Mishayu, its southern extreme, this shore is low and rocky with intermediate sandy patches when within 11 miles of Jazirat Maawal it becomes sandy, and so remains as far as and beyond Has Shanna. Baiyat Dimna. —Is a very extensive reef, the greater part of which dries at low water; commencing from the shore about 10 miles north-eastward of B,as Mishayu, it gradually increases in width until abreast of Ras Shanna, where it extends nearly 6 miles from the shore, and dries miles out into the Masirah channeL Abreast of Ras Shanna the reef ends but shallows of 1J, 2 and 3 fathoms extend almost across to the northern end of Masirah island. From the head or north-eastern end of Baiyat Dimna a sandbank with from 1^ to 2| fathoms water, extends southward as far as the Oyster islets, forming the western side of the navigable portion of the Masirah channel; from thence it turns sharply back towards the mainland and rejoins the shore about where Baiyat Dimna shoal commences. A small reef of rocks, covered at high water lies about 2 miles offshore on this inner part of the sandbank. Rds Shanna. —(Latitude 20° 45' N., Longitude 58° 44' E.) is the low sandy point form ing the western portion of the northern entrance to the Masirah channel. It bears north-north-west 8| miles from Ras Hilf on Masirah island, the eastern point of entrance. At 3 miKs southward of Ras Shanna is JazTrat Maawal, a low wooded islet connected with the mainland at half-ebb; a eroek in the reef, open from the northward, and navigable for boats, leads up to it. Tides. —It is high water, full and change, at the village of Umm Rasas at lOh; springs rise 10 feet. The flood stream sets westward round the northern end of the island, and south-westward down the channel; round the southern and the flood stream sets west-north-west, and from thence north-north-eastward up the channel, the two streams maeting about off Umm Rasas village. The ebb streams part at about the same place an d set the contrary way to the flood streams. The rate of the streams varies from 1| to 2\ miles an hour. MASIRAH (Gulf of)— The extensive bight, in the south coast of Arabia, which is included between Ras Madrakh {q.v.) and Masirah Island (q.v.). The whole coast of this gulf is desolate and but thinly inhabited by Jannabah settlors who subsist largely on fish. MASIRAK (W adi)— One of the tributary valleys of Wadi B'shah. It is crossed by the route from Abba to Taif and Mecca at a distance of 65 miles from the former town. See Wadi Dawasir. MASKARI— The singular form of Masakirah fa.v.). MASQAT (Bay and Town)*— This is the established spelling of the name, but educated inhabitants of the given place state that it is frequently pronounced and sometimes written Muscat; the latter is the form given by Niebuhr. Situation. Masqat is the capital of the 'Oman Sultanate and the usual residence of the Sultan : it is situated in the Masqat District on the southern shore of the Gulf of Oman rather less than J of the way from Ras-al-Hadd, the eastern point of Arabia, to Ras Musandam which marks the entrance to the Persian Gulf. It stands in the centre of an outcrop of volcanic rock which extends 10 miles along the coast from Darsait to Bandar Jissah and has a depth inland of about 3 miles; the town is at the bottom of Ja S T o Th 2372-286 r 9 MaSqat t0Wn iS and MatraJl (Survey of Illdia . 1904-05); the chart, which contain view,MASQAT 1187 a cove the easternmost of 5 large contiguous indentations, where Wadi-al-Kablr, a valley carrying the drainage of the greater part of the igneous basin, disembogues into the eea. The northern portion of the volcanic bed is dioritc and the remainder euphotide of a dark-brown colour resembling serpentine ; between the diorite and the euphotide is a deposit of green steatitic clay. . . , , , ,1 , 1 ,1 -i * ixr-j- i Rugged and almost inaccessible hills rise inland of the town on both sides of Wadi-al- Kablr to heights of 300 and 400 feet, and are dominated by Jabal Bardah or Saddle Hill in the brackground, which is 1,350 feet high and about 3 miles south of Masqat. Through the hills on the west a track barely practicable for animals leads over a pass to Riyam and bo to Matrah ; while on the south-east a somewhat similar pass conducts to Sidab ; both these passes are situated beyond the outermost suburbs and each is barred by a wall with a gateway in it. There is no route, except for foot-passengers, by Wadi-al- Kablr to the interior. ., Harbour The bay of Masqat* is about | of a mile deep and I a mile wide ; it is open to the north-north-west. The western side of the bay is formed by rocky promontory, 436 feet high terminating at the seaward end in a point named Ras Kalbuh. The eastern side consists of Masqat Island, 1,300 yards long and 350 feet high, indented and precipi tous all round and ending seawards in Ras Masqat. Between the southern end Masqat Island and the mainland is a rocky islet, 100 feet high, which has a narrow and shallow channel upon each side of it; the channel between it and Masqat Island is known as Duwarah The foot of Masqat Bay is a sandy beach terminated at each extremity by a rocky eminence on which stands a fort; and it should be mentioned that a spur from the western side of the bay projects about 200 yards into the harbour forming on its south side a small sheltered cove called Makallah.f The side of Masqat Island next the harbour is-covered with the names of European ships of different nationalities painted in white upon the rocks; the custom of recording a first visit in this manner is a time- honoured one which with few vessels neglect to comply. Among the names are those of one or two Russian vessels were which lost in the war with Japan. T Defences The principal defences of Masqat are the forts callod Miram and Jalali perched on rocks at-the opposite ends of the sandy beach already mentioned ; each stands on a cliff about 150 feet above sea-level and is approached by a staircase cut m rock. Mirani on the west is very slightly the higher of the two ; it is also the more complicated in its design and has a battery beneath it at water level. Jalali, to the oast, is a rather smaller and Simpler construction, but exhibits two tiers of cascmated embrasures. These two forts, in conjunction, were well calculated at the time they were built by the Portuguese to command the town and to protect both from the landward and seaward sides; but neither of them has the slightest modern value or is in a state of even tolerable repair. Subsidiary maritime defences, also legacies of the Portuguese, are Sirat-ash-Sharqiyah, on the eastern side of the harbour about 250 yards within Ras Masqat, and Sirat-al-Gharbiyah on the other side, surmounting the promontory which shelters Makallah : both these arc now in ruinous stato._ On the landward side the water-supply of the town, situated J a mile up \\ adi-al-Kabir, is pro- tocted by a high, square fort of Portuguese construction with machicoulis, called Rawiyah ; and numerous points of vantage on the hills environing the suburbs are occupied by small blockhouses, the principal of which are Burj ba ab above the south-east corner of the town, Bosto behind the middle of the town, Burj -al-Murabba some dist ance up Wadi-al-Kabir, Burj Damodar above the west end of the town. Bur] Madaimm on the side towards Riyam, and Burj Makallah on the top of the ndge that forms the west side of the harbour. At present only the Mirani and Jalali forts are occupied , their armament consists of a number of old muzzle-loadmg guns in bad order, fit only fo firing salutes. The garrisons amount to 200 men of whom one-fourth are private retainers of the Sultan, and a half composed of Baluelus and miscellaneous Arabs arm with rifles but destitute of military training. oo +1^ f The present Sultan has recently enlisted a special Palace Guard hno^ n ^ ^ consisting of 1 Commandant, 1 Pay master, 11 non-commissioned officers and about ♦See Admiralty Plan Ko. 2372-2869.

The ' Guard ' consists of local boys enlisted forcibly by the Sultan, and the present Commandant (1915) is an Arab of Baghdad who received his military training in Constantinople. The force is provided with white and khaki uniform and brown leather equipments, all from India. They are armed with'different types of rifles mainly mausers. His Highness has also 3 Maxim guns, two French (Creusot) of modern pattern and one of 1 German pattern. These were purchased in 1914. Attached to the Nizam is a brass Band, also recently enlisted, consisting of 1 Band- I master, 1 Assistant Bandmaster, both Goanese, and 18 bandsmen all local Arabs, Sidia or Baluchis. The cost of the new force is estimated at about Rs. 28,200 annually. Town and suburbs. —Masqat consists of a town proper, surrounded by walls, and of a large agglomeration of unwalled suburbs twice or thrice as extensive as the town proper. It is necessary to deal with these separately^ The town proper is about J a mile long from east to west and J of a mile deep from the sea inland. On the north side it fronts the harbour and comes right down to the beach ; on the east it is enclosed by precipitous hill which a gap called Mughab divides from the Jalali hill; on the south and west sides the town is walled. The wall is in fairly good order and has towers at intervals ; it is broken in the middle of the south side by the Bab-as- Saghir or Little Gate on the road to Sidab, immediately outside which is a good bazar of about 40 shops and stalls, chiefly for the sale of provisions. Here also is an imposing Mosque built in 1912 by the notorious arms trader 'Ali Khan Musa, now deported to India; at the south-western angle it is pierced by the Bab-al-Kabir or Main Gate through which runs the route to the majority of the suburbs and to Matrah; both of these Babs are fortified gateways at which guards are stationed day and night. There is another gate of less importance at the north-western comer under Fort Mirani which is called Bab-al-Matha'ib ; it consists of a row of four small iron-grated posterns through which Wadi-al-Kabir passes on its way to the beach. Many of the houses in the town 1 are somewhat handsome erections of two or more storeys, built of stone, concrete or mud, , and plastered with gypsum-stucco. The old mosques are low and mean, without either ! domes or minaret, but 3 of more recent date are of greater elegance and pretention. These are (1) the mosque of Saiyid Yusuf-az-Zawawi built in 1905 and situated in the eastern quarter of the town, (2) the mosque of Khan Sahib Nasib bin Muhammad, Naval Contractor, built in 1909 and situated near the Bab-al-Kabir, (3) the mosque of 'Ali Khan Musa, built in 1912, referred to above, and situated outside the Bab-as-Saghir. The bazaars inside the town, containing about 300 shops, are roofed and rather dark: of the shops about 80 belong to money-lenders and bankers, 100 to sellers of piece-goods and 100 to provision merchants. The quarters of the town in order from east to west along the sea-face are :— h Name of quarter. Mughab Muhallat Banyan Muhallat Al Bu Sa'id ., Limits and number of houses.

The Baluchis are soldiers, sailors, porters, servants and petty traders. There is a considerable Persian community who are shopkeepers, fishmongers and makers of quilts and bedding. Hindus number about 200 male adults and 50 women, besides some children, the presence with some of them of their families being a recent innovation ; they are bankers, im porters from India of rice, piece-goods, sugar and coffee, date-exporters, silversmiths and owners of some of the best gardens la the suburbs. There are some Hadharim or Had- hramautis in the Sultan's service, with their families ; and a few families of fishermen from Soqotrah come annually to the Makallah cove in the beginning of the hot weather and remain for a month or two. There are a few Abyssinians, called Habush, and Nubi ans called Nuban. About 20 Goanese are settled at Masqat as general store-keepers, vendors of spirits and tobacco, clerks and servants. There are 10 Khojahs at Masqat. The population of Masqat is fluctuating and is at its lowest in the hot weather when more than half the inhabitants of the s iburbs leave for Sib, Barkah and other places in Batinah in quest of a less trying climate. In winter, when the town is full, the population of Masqat may be 9^000 souls, viz., 2,500 residing within the walls, 4,500 in the suburbs and 1,000 visitors : in size Masqat is inferior to Matrah. The principal food of the people apart from fish, is rice ; but the poorer classes subsist largely on bread of jowari. Resources cmd clivfiate. —Masqat has no natural resources or amenities. Food and firewood are all imported, with the exception of the trifling yield of a few date trees and of some small market gardens in Wadi-al-Kabir and of the excellent and abundant fish which a fleet of boats belonging to the town catch outside the entrance of the harbour every morning when the weather permits. About 30 cattle and 200 sheep and goats are kept which are fed largely on fish. The climate is equable but extreme, the heat in the sun rising to as much as 189° F. and the temperature on the house roof at night in June occasionally remaining at 106° F. There are only two seasons, a cool and a hot ; the cool season lasts from November to March and is attended by occasional rain and heavy stormv weather with comparatively chilly winds from the north and north-west which produce outbreaks of malarial fever. The early part of the hot weather is the healthiest season of the year. The rainfall is about 4| inches per annum, and most of it is received during February and March in the course of a fortnight or 3 weeks. Commerce, shipping, etc. —The choice of Masqat as capital of the country appears to have been determined by the comparative excellence of its harbour, which favoured trade and in former times enabled the Sultan to maintain a naval force and exercise some influence at sea, and.by its inaccessibility and consequent security from the inland side. Even as a port, however, Masqat suffers from various disadvantages. The harbour lies open to the prevalent Shamal, and landing is difficult when that wind blows. Af'ain Masqat has no landward communications and all goods for the interior after being imported at Masqat must be re -ahipped to some other distributing centre, generally to1192 MASQAT Matrah. Despite these drawbacks Masqat continues to be the only steam-port of 'Oman, the Matrah anchorage being regarded as unsafe, and through it passes practically the whole export and import trade of the country. The only local manufactures are lungis, white skull-caps embroidered with silk' matting of Makran reeds, and ornamental daggers called Khanajir. Dates are the only export of any account. The principal articles of export in 1914-15 were,;—dates ; arms and ammunition ; specie; dried fish ; mother-of-pearl and pearls ; dried limes ; and fresh fruit. The Fard dates of Masqat all go to America, where they are much esteemed; other sorts are exported to Kach, Calcutta and Rangoon, mostly in native vessels. Native sailing boats from the Red Sea, mostly from Hodaidah, visit Masqat in September of each year and some of them ship full cargoes of dates at Masqat; others, which have previously visited Basrah, merely complete their cargoes ; both dispose of their purchases along the east coast of Africa and in Madagascar. The date-trade with India is mostly by Kutiyahs from Kach which come over at the beginning of August. The dates are collected at Matrah by Hindu dealers, who sometimes advance money on an instrument executed before the Qadhi to Arab brokers ; in these cases the dates are brought in at harvest time by the broker, who subsequently receives commission at the rate of 2i to 5 per cent, on the price which the Hindu merchant is able to obtain. For the Indian trade dried dates are preferred ; these are dates boiled in the Ratab or semi-ripe state and then dried ; they are in request at native weddings in different parts of India. The chief imports in 1914-15 were :—rice ; arms and ammunition ; cotton piece- goods ; specie twist and yarn j silk and silk goods sugar; and coffee; and, cereals other than rice. The import of rice is chiefly form Calcutta ; the import of wheat, which is less important, is from Karachi^Persia or 'Iraq according to the season and the prices r ulin g in those countries. In 1914-15, 101 steam vessels with a tonnage of 165,614 entered and left the port of Masqat: of these 98, with a tonnage of 157,800, were British. The shipping of Masqat port consists of 9 Baghlah and owned by Hindu and Musalman British subjects, of 32 large Horis for loading and unloading cargo, and of 130 small Horis for conveying passen gers between Masqat and Matrah. Cargo and fishing boats are built, and larger boats aro required, at Masqat. The boat building yard is at the mouth of Wadi-al-Kabir, below Fort Mirani. There are now no European firms at Masqat. Ten Hindu firms employ about Rs. 10,00,000 in the Masqat trade and own house and other property, worth about Rs. 5,00,000, at Masqat; altogether there are about 100 Hindu traders, all of whom are under British protection. The Hindu merchants export dates and import piece-goods, rice, sugar and coffee ; they also deal to some extent in pearls and shells. The Hindu commercial community is smaller than it once was, but its prosperity is at present on the increase in consequence of expanding trade. CurrenrAj, weights and measures. —The currency of Masqat is described in the article on the Oman Sultanate. We may add here that the usual means of payment in the foreign trade is by Hundis, here called Kundis, or bills of exchange at 21 days' sight, drawn against requirements ; these instruments are practically accommodation bills as possession is not given of the bills of lading for the cargo against which they are drawn and there is no relation between the value of the Hundi and the value of the consign ment, a trade usage sufficient in itself to deter European firms from engaging in banking business at Masqat. The weights and measures of Masqat are the same as those of Matrah, but differ somewhat from those of the Batinah coast and other parts of ' Oman. The ordinary table of Masqat weights runs as follows :— (1) Those use by the Sultan's customs are :— 1 Kiyas .. 1 Masqat maund 6 dol. or 5.9375 ozs. 144 dol. or 24 Kiyas or 8lbs.l4ioz3. 1 Frasilah. 1 Bahar. 10 Masqat maunds .. ,, .. = 200 Masqat maunds .. ,. ,. = There is yet another weight also called Bahar and weight is exclusively used for weighing salt. is equal to 400 Masqat maunds.

Dates are sold by these weights ; so also are liquids. Saffron, musk and ottar of rosea however, are sold by a Mithqal of 62-6 grains English. Gold is sold by Rattis and Ibramis, one Ibramis being equal to 28 Rattis : the Ibramls is equal to 54-46 grains English and the Ratti consequently to a little less than 2 grains. Civet is sold by a Waqiyah of 14-5 grains English. For transactions in grain measures of capacity are employed, namely, the Sidis and Farah ; a Farah consists of 40 Sidis, and 2.| Farahs of ordinary wheat are equal in weight to 2 Karachi maunds. The measure of length is the actual cubit, viz., the distance from a man's elbow to the point of his middle finger. Other measures of length are the long span or Shibar and the short span or Fatar, from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little and the first finger, respectively, when distended as widely as possible. Administration.—Ta.Q tow.i of Masqat is personally governed by the Sultan without tho intermediacy of a Wali. Of the gross produce of the few gardens which belong to the town T l - is taken as a tax. There is also a municipal police tax called Hirasah which is collectecl monthly from the occupiers of shops and places of business. The main source of revenue is of course the sea-customs, which are noticed in the article on the Sultanate of 'Oman. MASQAT DISTRCT— This name is not current locally ; but it is the most suitable that can be given to that tract in the 'Oman Sultanate which surrounds Masqat town and is enclosed between Wadi Samail on* the west, Wadi Tayin on the south, and the sea upon the east and north.f With these limits tho district has a length of about 50 miles from W.-N.-W. to E.-S.-E. and a maximum breadth of about 25 miles. Configuration. —Masqat District consists of a complexus of small valleys which diverge in different directions from the slopes of Eastern Hajar to the sea. The principal of these valleys in order from west to east are Wadi Risail, Wadi 'Adai, Wadi Bait-al-Falaj,Wadi Maih and its tributaries, Wadi-al-Hilu and Wadi Mijlas with its affluents, including Wadi Sarain, all of which are described under their own names. The surface of the district rugged and barren in its general aspect, is chiefly occupied by this net work of valleys with their intervening ridges, but in places the country opens out into small expanses of more or less level plain which possess specific mimes, such are Wadi Boshar and Saih Hatat, to which special articles are devoted, and Saih-al-Harmal of the ' Plain of Rue,' a widening of Wadi Bait-al-Falaj, between Bait-al-Falaj and Ruwi. The coast of the Masqat District is bold, the hills everywhere east of Wadi 'Adai coming right ' * for authorities maps and charts sec foot-iiote to article 'Oman Sultanate.

Communical.ions. —Apart from the valleys of the interior and their villages and from the inhabited places on the coast, among which are the towns of Masqat and Matrah, the district possesses few points of interests. It is necessary however to mention various routes by which Matrah and, through Matrah, Masqat Town are placed in communi cation with central 'Oman. The most important of these is the westernmost which leaving Matrah by way of Ruwi and traversing Wadi BOshar, reaches WSdi Samail near Fanjah and so taps the main highway between the coast and the interior of'Oman, Probably the second in importance is one which starting likewise by Ruwi, follows Wadi 'Adai to a point 7 miles above Birain and thence crosses into the upper basin of Wadi Maih, whence two steep passes, 'Aqabat Qahzaand 'Aqabat 'Amdah, conduct into Wadi Tayin ; Wadi Tayln in its turn gives access to the Sharqiyah district. A third route, running from Matrah by Ruwi to Birain, leaves WSdi 'Adai at that point and crosses direct to WSdi Maih which it descends to its head and then, surmounting an intervening pass, descends Wadi Mijlas to Quryat on the coast. The Only land route which starts from Masqat Town is one which skirts the coast south-eastward as far as Qantab, passing through all the intermediate cOast villages; at Qantab its distance from the shore increases, but Jissah and Yiti on the sea can be reached by following it. This last route is connected with Ruwi by a track that enters it between Jissah and Yiti. Yiti is connected with two different points on the Matrah-Quryat road by tracks, one of which leads up Wadi Maih, the other up Wadi-al-Hilu. Topography. —It remains to describe the features and places on the coast of the Masqat District: in the following table they are given in the order in which they occur from west to east and, except when the contrary is stated, they stand upon the sea.

A few of the Bani Wahaib appear to be the only nomads in the Masqat district. MASRA— A hamlet in Hadhramaut on the route between Shihair and Shibam and some 8 or 10 miles short of the latter town. See Wadi Bin 'Ali.— {Bent.) MASRI (Al BU)— One of the rural tribes of 'Iraq {q. v.).

Mastarah is 12 hours' journey northward of Rabigh. According to Burckhardt, who makes the journey one of 11 hours, two large and deep wells, cased with stone, afford here a copious supply of good water. Near them stood the tomb of a Shaikh Madaili, but it was demolished by the Wahhabis. About 10MAS—MAT 1201 miles east of this is a high mountain, called Jabal Ayub, overtopping the other summits of the chain of which it forms a part and covered in many spots with trees. It is in habited by the 'Auf tribe. The whole road fr^m Kullaiyah to this place is dangerous on account of the robberies of these Bedouins and caravans never pass without losing some of its loads or camels. At the Masturah wells Burckhardt saw several flocks of camels and sheep belonging to the 'Auf. According to native reports in 1912, nearly a century after Burckhardt's time, the water supply at Masturah is now scarce. MAS'UD— An Arab tribe of 'Iraq belonging to the neighbourhood of Karbala and inhabiting both banks of the Husainiyah canal from the Euphrates down to the Pul-i-Sufaid, as well as some land on the Mshorab canal to the west of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah : they seem to occur also on the left bank of the Euphrates a little above Musaiyib. The bulk of the tribe dwell in hamlets of grass, thorn and mat huts sprinkled along the banks of the Husainiyah canal, but the leading men have brick-built castle. The Mas'ud are about 7,000 souls. As a tribe they are reputed brave, generous and hospitable, and they have about 1,000 horses ; but only the Shaikhs possess modern firearms. In religion they are Shi'ahs ; by occupation they are agriculturists and graziers owning cattle, buffaloes and sheep. They are generally at feud with the Yasar and live in amity and alliance with the Janabiyln. The small Khadhirat and Zumailat tribes are politically dependent on the Mas'ud, and some would even classify the latter as a section of the Mas'ud. The Mas'ud joined the townspeople of Karbala in their rebellion in 1843 against the Turkish Government. They are exempt from conscription for Turkish military service. The official Shaikh of the tribe, recognised by the Turks, is Ibrahim- ibn-Haji Hatmi; but the real Shaikh is Haji Sa'ud, eldest son of Haji Hatmi; there is not however any dissension between these two. The Mas'ud comprise the following sections: A1 Bu Ghanim, Harlr, Inaqabat, Qarid and Shukan: in all there are about 15 different sub-divisions.

Like Ma sqat it is enclosed on the landward sides by rugged volcanic »Ihe map and chart for Matrah are the same a 3 for JIaaqat Town, q. v.MATKAH 120B liills ; but its Isolation from the interior is less complete, for an easy route leads through a pass called Kharashif to Bait-al-Falaj and Ruwi, whence routes described in the article on Masqat District diverge to various parts of 'Oman. The ordinary way to Masqat Town lies by Matairah and Riyam along the coast; there is also a more inland route across the hills.' Communication with the capital, however, is maintained chiefly by boat, the passage occupying in a rowing-boat about | of an hour. The bay of Matrah* is 1,400 yards wide, 1,200 yards deep and shoals regularly from 8 iathoms at the entrance to the beach on which the town stands. In appearance it is 4ess remarkable than the bay of Masqat; but though open to the north-east, it is sheltered from the north-west, is more easily entered, and is preferred as a harbour by ordinary native craft. The town extends along the water's edge for J of a mile and has a mean depth inland of about 250 yards. The fort, a Portuguese construction of the same typo as the forts at Masqat, stands on a rocky eminence at the east end of the town which, like Masqat, is defended, where nature has left it unprotected, by a wall with fortified gateways ; the most important gate is the Bab-al-Kabir at the south-west corner of the town, by which the Ruwi road leaves Matrah. Several blockhouses, as at Masqat, tomnrand the ap proaches through the hills. The Customs House is on the beach slightly to the west of the fort. In the centre of the town upon the sea-front stands the fortifed quarter inhabited by the Khojah community and generally known as the Khojah Fort; behind it, some distance to the north-west of the Bab-al-Kabir, is the Bab-as-Saghir. About midway between the Customs House and the Khojah Fort a hollow, coming from the Bab-al- Kablr and known as Khor Bambah, reaches the sea. The houses of Matrah Town are meaner than those of Masqat, but there is less suburban squalor. The following are the quarters of Matrah within the walls— Name, Sur-al-Lawatiyah Takiyah Harat-as-Siyagh .

The population of Matrah is a medley of races resembling that of Masqat Town But whereas at Masqat there are many Hindus and almost no Khojahs, here Khojahs are numerous and Hindus comparatively few, the KhSjahs numbering about 1,050 souls, while the Hindus are 6niy about 30 men, of whom 7 or 8 have their families with them. The population of Matrah is greater than that of Masqat, and the permanent inhabitants are about 8,000 within and 4,000 outside the walls, or in all about 12,000 souls, of whom at least half are Baluchis. The predominant Arab tribes are Bani Hasan, Siyabiyin, Rahbiyan and Bani Jabir. The bulk of the trade of up-country 'Oman apart from the mere shipping and Unshipping of goods which take plaoe mostly at Masqat, is concentrated at Matrah; and it» volume and character appear from the article on Masqat Town, Matrah is the loading and unloading place of all caravans for aftd from the interior. The import and export trade is mostly in the hands of the Khojahs and Hindus, who are as a rule general merchants and shopkeepers not confining themselves to particular lines of business. Both classes import rice from Calcutta and piece goods, sugar, oil, iron and spices from Bombay and export wet afid dried dates ; the Khojahs also export some quantity of dried fish of the small sardine variety called Matuk Some of the Hindu merchants settled at Matrah visit the Sam ail valley and 'Oman Proper in persons to purchase dates.

MATTI (S ab I khat)— This is the name used among the inhabitants of 'Oman ; but by dwellers in Qatar ard the Hasa Sanjaq it is generally called Sabakhat 'Oman, and sometimes it is even spoken of as Wadi Sabakhah. It is a coastal district in the Abu Dhabi Principality near its western end, and by some it is regarded as forming the western boundary of ' Oman in the strictly geographical sense. The extent of the district upon the coast is from Jabal Wutaid in Dhafrah to Dohat- as-Sila' in Mijan, a distance of about 30 miles; and its centre is situated very nearly upon the 52nd meridian of east longitude. Inland it extends probably 60 miles, and its hnght is possibly greater at a distance from the coast than it is upon the sea. ' Sab akhat Matti is enclosed landwards by Mijan on the west, bv Jafurah and possibly the Ruba'-al-Khali on the south, and by Dhafrah on the east, the well of Sufuk in Jafurah marks approximately the boundary of Sabakhat Matti on the south. The whole of the district appears to be a saline or nitrous marsh, the extreme of desolation, without wells or grass, or even mangroves at the coast. It is said that the sea runs up the middle of the Sabakhah at high tide for as much as 12 or 15 miles and that camels in that part of it are liable to be lost. Ordinary travellers prefer to pass it by sea, and the crossing is so difficult, and even dangerous, that the Manasir Bedouins in' their periodical migrations between Dhafrah and Qatar avoid it by deviating into the Jafurah desert to the south.'

C52(w)GSB 7c iMDA—MEC MDAIRAH- A halting place on the route between Kuwait and Qasr-as-Sabiyah, situated nearly 40 miles from the former. It possesses one well of fresh water which is liable to become silted up in rainy weather. The birthplace of Muhammad, the chief town of Hejaz and the great holy city of Islam. It is situated about 50 miles eastward from Jiddah, on the Red Sea, in Lat. 21° 25' N. and Long. 40° 8' E. Mecca lies in the heart of a mass of rough hills, intersected by a labyrinth of narrow valleys and passes, and projecting into the Tihamah, or low coastal plain along the Red Sea, in front of the great mountain wall that divides it from the central plateau, though in turn they are themselves separated from the sea by a second curtain of hills forming the western wall of Wadi Marr. The inner mountain wall ia pierced by only two great passes and the valleys descending from these embrace on both sides the Mecca hills. The town itself is built in a deep, narrow valley, and is so completely hidden from the seaward side that no sign of it is visible until almost the gate of the city is reached. This valley runs approximately north-east and south-west and seems to extend for a considerable distance. There is a hospital for sick strangers. Any who die destitute aro buried at the ex pense of the temple, and upon any naked wretch is bestowed a shirt cloth from the same source. The hills east and west of Mecca, which are party built over and rise several hundred feet above the valley so enclose the city that the ancient walls never actually surrounded the city but only barred the valley at three points, where three gates led into the town. In the time of Ibn Zubair the gates were still standing though the walls were in ruin but now the gates have only left their names to quarters of the town. At the northern or upper end was the Bab-al-Ma'la, or gate of the upper quarter, whence the road con tinues up the valley towards Muna and 'Arafat, as well as towards Zaimah and Xajd. Beyond the gate, in a place called Hajun, is the chief cemetery, commonly called Ma'la and said to the last resting place of many of the companions of Muhammad. Here across-road, laboriously cut through the rocks running over the hills to join the main road to Al-Madinah, turns off to the west by the pass of Kada the point from which the troops of the Prophet stormed the city. Here too the body of Ibn Zubair was hung on a cross by Hajjaj. The lower or southern gate, at the Masfalah quarter, opened on to the Yemen road, where the rain water from Mecca draims off into an open valley. Beyond there are mountains on both sides, that to the east is Abu Kubays while on that to the south, namely Jabal Jiyad, commanding the city is the great castle, a fortress of some strength. On the north is the hill Jiyad Amir. The third or western gate Bab-al- Umr, stood almost opposite the great mosque and opened on a road leading to the west round the southern, spurs of the Red Mountain. This is the way tc Wadi Fatimah and to Al-Madinah, the Jiddah road branching off from it to the left. Considerable suburbs now lie outside the quarter named after this gate; in the middle ages a pleasant country road led for some miles through partly cultivated land with good wells as far as the )oundary of the sacred territory and gathering place of the pilgrims at Tanim, near t e mosque of Ayesha. This is the spot on the road to Al-Madinah now called 'Umra from a ceremonial connected with it which will be mentioned later. The length of the sinuous main axis of the city from the farthest suburbs on the road to Al-Madinah is a out 3,500 yards and the greatest breadth from the Jiyad quarter east of the great mosque across the valley and up the western slopes, about 2,300 yards. About the middle of the longitudinal line the thorough fares are pushed aside by the vas courtyard and colonnades composing the Bait Ullah, or great mosque which, with i s spacious arcades surrounding the Ka'abah and other holy places and its seven minarets forms the only prominent architectural feature of the city. The mosque is enclosed by houses with windows opening on the arcades and commanding a view of the Ka'abah. Immediately beyond these, on the side facing Jabal Abu Kobais, a broad street runs south-east and north-west across the valley. This is the Mas'a between the eminences of bafa and Marwah and has been from very early times one of the most livelyCs MECCA 1211 intc^ 'iDtbin bazaars and the centre of Mecca life. The other chief bazaars are also near the mosque in smaller streets. The general aspect of the town is picturesque, and the streets are fairly spacious though filthy and ill-kept; the houses are of stone, many of them well- built and four or five storeys high, with terraced roofs and large projecting windows as in Jiddah a style of building which has not varied materially since the 10th century and gains in effect from the way in which the dwellings run up the sides and spurs of the mountains. The principal markets are roofed and contain some good shops. Of public institutions there arc baths, ribals or hospices for poor pilgrims, a hospital and a public kitchen for the poor, a court house, as well as post and telegraph and other government officGS. • • • There are no local industries, and all classes of the population live by the pilgrimage, acting as guides and directors during the sacred ceremonies, contractors for transport and the like. Considerable sums are also realized by the letting of houses, of which many more exist than the permanent population requires. The mosque is at the same time the university hall where between two pilgrims seasons lectures are delivered on Muhammadan law doctrine, and connected branches of science. A poorly provided public library is open to the use of students. The buildings round the mosque originally intended as lodgings for students and professors, and known as the Madrasah have long been let out to rich pilgrims. The minor places of visitation for pilgrims such as the birthplaces of the Prophet and his chief followers, are not notable. Both these and the court of the great mosque lie beneath the general level of the city, the site having been gradually raised by accumulated rubbish. The town in fact has little air of antiquity ; genuine, Arab buildings do not last long, especially in a valley periodi cally ravaged by tremendous floods when the tropical rains burst on the.sui iounding hills. The history of Mecca is full of the record of these inundations, unsuccessfully combated by the great dam drawn across the valley by the Khalif 'Umr and later works of Mahdi. ' The fixed population of Mecca, exclusive of soldiers, is now estimated at nearly 70,000 souls the largest urban aggregate in Arabia ; this includes about 12,000 Indians. There is a larwe floating population and that not merely at the proper season of pilgrimage the pilgrims of one season often beginning to arrive before those of the former season have all dispersed. The annual pilgrimage bring about 200,000 visitors into the town. The British Indian pilgrims sometimes number 20,000 and those from Malay, 4,000 to 5 000. At the height of the season the town is much overcrowded and the entire want of a drainage system is severely felt. Fortunately good water is tolerably plentiful for though the^water from the wells is mostly undrinkable, and even the famous Zamzam water only available for medicinal or religious purposes the underground conduit from bovond 'Arafat supplies to the public fountains a sweet and light water. This aqueduct is the successor of an older one associated with the names of Zubaidah and other bene factors The only true well in Mecca is Zamzam and the main water supply of the town is derived from the springs at Mount 'Arafat. The water is brought down to Mecca by a conduit which runs subterraneously through the town and has pits at intervals resembling wells The water drawers are a special class ; they carry the water in skins and supply houses at a certain monthly rate according to the quantity required. The water is of crood quality when uncontaminated and the supply is plentiful except when the channel Sets blocked up as occasionally happens. The water in the Zamzam well stands at about 40 feet below the level of the ground. It is regarded as a panacea for many bodily «s well as spiritual ills, it is used both for drinking and ablutions, and many pilgrims have it brought to their houses in order to wash themselves and their clothes in it; a canister, r ontaining a pint or so, is the most valued present that can be brought from Mecca The soil of Mecca and its immediate neighbourhood is almost entirely barren. There are hardly any gardens and all supplies are brought in from outside, fruit and vegetables from TaU rice and foreign products bv sea to Jaddah ; poultry can be obtained at reasonable prices, and mutton, milk, and butter are plentifully supplied from the desert Very little livestock is kept locally, except donkeys and camels. The climate of Mecca is very hot and very dry but not unhealthy Ihe own is so shut in by the surrounding hills that a breeze seldom reaches it, and the heat reflected from the rock faces increases the glare by day and the closeness of the atmosphere at St Rain falls only once or twice a year, but it is tropical in its violence, and does considerable damage to the town. On these occasions, during the inundation i 'ij-BHBHHHnBBMnBMnHMHHnHmM MECCA (sml), the mosque is often flooded to a depth of several feet, since it lies lower than the surrounding city whose level has been gradually raised by accumulated dibris through the destruction and rebuilding of the houses. A former attempt to mitigate the inunda tion by throwing a dam across the valley was not successful, and the flood-water is allowed to escape through the town and out into the open valley by the south gate During the pilgrimage there is always peril'of devastating epidemics, for the present quarantine system is useless, and the camps of the poorer pilgrims are crowded and most insanitary. Cholera is most dreaded; the bubonic plague, though equally deadly, is not feared so much, owing to its comparatively slow rate of development and to the speedy dispersal of the pilgrims after the ceremonies. There are two old forts above the town, the larger on the south-east, and a smaller one to the west on a mound below Jabal Hindi. Normally a Turkish garrison of at least three battalions with field and mountain guns is stationed at Mecca. The Wali of Hejaz resides there (in summer at Ta'if) and so does the Grand Sherif. In addition to the profits of the pilgrimage, the town receives an annual Government grant (mrra), and the customs duties levied at Jiddah and Yambo'. It is free of tax and military service. The public buildings include a court-house, post-office, and other government offices • there are also baths, a hospital, and hospices (ribdt*) for poor pilgrims from India' Java, etc. A petroleum engine for a flour mill, turning out about l^ton of flour daily' was set up in 1909, and in January 1912, two others of the same size had been import ed and were being set up ; they are all of British manufacture. A weekly paper. The Hejaz, is published in Turkish and Arabic. Telegraph to Jiddah and Ta'if. Holding this position between two great routes between the lowlands and inner Arabia and situated in a narrow and baren valley incapable of supporting an urban population, Mecca must have been from the first a commercial centre. At all events, long before Muhammad we find Mecca established in the two-fold capacity of a com mercial centre and a privileged holy place, surrounded by an inviolable territory known as the Haram, which was not the sanctuary of a single tribe but a place of pilgrimage where religious observances were associated with a series of annual fairs at different points in the vicinity. Indeed, in the unsettled state of the country commerce was possible only under the sanctions of religion and through the provisions of the sacred truce which prohibited war for four months of the year, three of these being the month of pilgrimage with those immediately preceding and following. The victory of Muhammadanism made a vast change in the position of Mecca. The merchant aristocracy became satraps or pensioners of a great empire ; but the seat of dominion was removed beyond the desert and though Mecca and the Hejaz strove for a time to maintain political as well as religious predominance the struggle was vain and terminated on the death of Ibn Zubair, the Meccca pretendant to the Khalifate when the city was taken by Hajjaj in A. D. 692. The sanctuary and feast of Mecca, however, received a new prestige from the victory of Islam. Purged of elements obivously heathen the Ka'abah became the holiest site and the pilgrimage, the most sacred ritual observance of Muhammadanism, and drew worshippers 'from so wide a circle that the confluence of the petty traders of the desert was no longer the main feature of the Holy season. The pilgrimage retained its impotance for the commercial well-being of Mecca ; to this day the people live by the Hajj—letting rooms, acting as guides and directors in the sacred ceremonies, as contractors and touts for land and sea transport, as well as exploiting the many benefactions that flow to the holy city while the surrounding Bedouins derive support from the camel transport it demands and from the subsidies by which they are engaged to protect or abstain from molesting * caravans. But the ancient fairs of heathenism were given up and the traffic of the pilgrim season was concentrated at Muna and Mecca, where most of the pilgrims have something to buy or sell, so that Muna, after the sacrifice of feast day, presents the aspect of a huge international fancy fair. Long before Muhammad, the chief sanctuary of Mecca was the Ka'abah, a rude stone building without windows, and having a door seven feet from the ground ; it was so named from its resemblance to an astragalus of about 40 feet cube, though the structure is not really a cube nor even exactly rectangular. The exact measurements to w ? ™ 2 T l nc , h f and 38 feet 4 inches ; ends 31 feet 7 inches and ' hei g ht 3o fee t- The Ka abah has been rebuilt more than once since Muham-\C?z MECCA 1213 Kit; ; stmt mad purged it of its idols and adopted it as the chief sanctuary of Islam, but the old form has been preserved except in secondary detail. The Ka'abah of Muhammad's time was the successor of an older building, said to have been destroyed by fire. It was constructed with courses of timber between the stones. The roof rested upon six pillars and the door was raised above the ground and approached by a stair (probably on account of the floods which often swept the valley) under which the wor shippers left their shoes before entering During the first siege of Mecca (A. D. 683) the building was burnt down and Ibn Zubair reconstructed it on an enlarged scale and in a better style of solid ashlar work. After his death, his most glaring innovations, namely the introduction of two doors on a level with the ground and the extension of the building to include the Hijr, were corrected by Hajjaj, under orders from the Khalif, but the building retained its more solid structure. The roof now rested on three pillars, and the height was raised one-half. The Ka'abah was again entirely rebuilt after the flood of A. D. 1626, but since Hajjaj there seem to have been no structural changes. Thus the 'Ancient House ' as it is titled, is still essentially a heathen temple adapted to the worhsip of Islam by the clumsy fiction that it was built by Abraham and Ishmael by divine revelation as a temple of pure monotheism and the chief object of veneration is the black stone, which is fixed in the external angle facing the Safa. The building is not exactly oriented, but it may be cal'ed the south-east corner. Its techni cal name is the black corner; the others being named the Yemen (south-west), Syrian (north-west) and 'Iraq (north-east) corners from the larids to which they approximately point. The black stone is small dark mass a span long, with an aspect suggesting vol canic or meteoric origin, fixed at such a height that it can be conveniently kissed by a person of middle size. It was broken by fire in the siege of A. D. 683 (not as many authors relate, by the Carmathians), and the pieces are kept together by a silver setting. The history of this heavenly stone, given by Gabriel to Abraham, does not conceal the fact that it was originally a fetish, the most venerated of a multi tude of idols and sacred stones which stood all around the sanctuary in the time of Mahammad. The Prophet destroyed the idols, but he left the characteristic form of worship the tawdf, or sevenfold circuit of the sanctuary, the worshipper kissing or touch ing the objects of his veneration, and besides the black stone he recognized the so-called Southern Stone, the same presumably as that which is still touched in the tawdf at the Yemen corner. The ceremony of the tawdf and the worship of stone fetishes was common to Mecca with other ancient Arabian Sanctuaries. It was as it still is, a frequent religious exercise of the people of Mecca, and the first duty of one who returned to the city or arrived there under a vow of pilgrimage ; thus the out side of the Ka 'abah was and is, more important than the inside. Islam did away with the worship of idols ; what was lost in interst by their suppression has been supplied by the invention of spots consecrated by recollections of Abraham, Ishmael and Hagar, or held to be acceptable places of prayer. Thus the space of ten spans between the black stone and the door, which is on the east side between the black and 'Iraq corners, and a man s height from the ground, is called the Multazam, and here prayer should be offered after the tawdf with outstretched arms and breast pressed against the house. On the other side of the door, agamst the same wall is a shallow trough, which is said to mark the original site of the stone on which Abraham stood to build the Ka'abah. Here the growth of the legend can be traced for the place is now called the ' Kneading-place (Majan), where the cement for the Ka'abah was prepared. This name and story do not appear in the older accounts. Once more in the north side of the Ka abah, there projects a low semicircular wall of marble, with an opening at each end between it and the walls of the house. The space within is paved with mosaic, and is called the Hijr. It is included the tawdf, and two slabs of verde antics within it are called the graves of Ishmael and Hagar, and are places of acceptable prayer. Even the golden or gilded mizab (water spout) that projects into the Hijir marks a place where prayer is heard and another such place is the part of the west wall close to the Yemen corner. The feeling of religious conservatism, which has preserved the structural rudeness of the Ka'abah did not prohibit costly surface decoration. In Mahammad s time the outer walls were covered by a veil (or kiswa) of stripped Yaman cloth. The Caliphs substituted a covering of figured brocade, and the Egyptian government still sends with each pilgrim caravan from Cairo a new kiswa of black brocade, adorned with a I1214 MECCA broad band embroidered with golden inscriptions from the Ku'an, as well as a richer curtain, for the door. The old kiswa is removed on the 25th day of the month before the pilgrimage, and fragments of it are brought by the pilgrims as charms. Till the 10th day of the pilgrimage month the Ka'abah is bare. The door of two leaves, with its posts and lintel, is of silvergilt, it was opened with considerable ceremony every Monday, and Friday, and daily in the month Rajab. But, though prayer within the building is favoured by the example of the prophet, it is not compulsory on the Moslem, and even in the time of Ibn Batuta the opportunities of entrance were reduced to Friday, and the birthday of the Prophet. It is now opened but a few times every year for the general public, which ascends by the portable staircase brought forward for the pur pose. Foreigners can obtain admission at any time for a special fee. The modern descriptions, from observations made under difficulties, are not very complete. Little change, however, seems to have been made since the time of Ibu Juba who describes the floor and walls as overlaid with richly varegated marbles, and the upper half of the walls as plated with silver thickly gilt, while the roof was veiled with colour ed silk. Modern writers describe the place as windowless, but Ibn Zubair mentions five windows of rich stained glass from 'Iraq. Between the three pillars of teak hung thirteen silver lamps. A chest in the corner to the left of one entering contained Qur'ans, and at the 'Iraq comer a space was cut off enclosing the stair that leads to the roof The door to this stair (called the door of mercy-Bab-al-Rahmah or Babal Taubah- of repentance) was plated with silver by the Khaliph Mutawakkil. Here in the time of Ibn Zubair, the Maqam or standing stone of Abraham was usually placed for better security but brought out on great occasions. The houses of ancient Mecca pressed close upon the Ka'abah the noblest families who traced their descent from Kosai, the reputed founder of the city, having their dwellings immediately around the sanctuary. To the north of the Ka'abah was the Dar-al-Nadura, or place of assembly of the Quraish. The multiplication of pilgrims after Islam soon made it necessary to clear away the nearest buildings and enlarge the place of dwellings for prayer around the ancient House. 'Umr, 'Uthman, and Ibn Zubair had all a share in this work, but the great founder of the mosque in its present form with its spacious area and deep colonnades, was the Khali f Mahdi, who spent enormous sums in bringing costly pillars from Egypt and Syria. The work was still incomplete at his death in A. D. 785, and was finished in less sumptuous style by his successor. Subsequently repairs and additions extending down to Turkish times have left little of Mahdi's work untouched, though a few of the pillars probably date from his days. There are more than five hundred pillars in all, of very various style and workmanship, and the enclosure 250 paces in length and 200 paces in breadth according to Burckhar.'t is entered by nineteen archways irregularly disposed. After the Ka'abah the principal points of interest in the mosque are the well Zaimam and the Maqam Ibrahim. The former is a deep shaft enclosed in a massive vaulted building paved with marble. Sacred wells are familiar features of Semitic sanctuaries, and Islam retaining the well made a quasi-biblical story for it, and endowed its tepid waters with miraculous curative virtues. They are eagerly drunk by the pilgrims, or when poured over the body are held to give a miraculous refreshment after the fatigues of religious exercse ; the manufacture of bottles or jars for carrying the waters to distant countries is quite a trade. The Maqam of Abraham is also connected with a relic of heathenism, the ancient holy stone which once stood on the Majan, and is said to bear the prints of the patriarchs feet. The whole legend of this stone which is full of miraculous incidents seems to have arisen from a misconception, the Maqam Ibraham in the Qur'an meaning the sanctuary itself ; but the stone which is a block of about 3 spans in height and 2 in breadth and in shape like a potter's furnaca {Ibn Zubair) is certainly very ancient. No one is now allowed to see it, though the box in which it lies can be seen and touched through a grating in the little chapel that surrounds it. Since the fall of Ibn Zubair the political position of Mecca has always been dependent on the movements of the greater Muhammadan world. In the splendid times of the Khalifs immense sums were lavished upon the pilgrimage and the holy city ; and conversely the decay of the central authority of Islam brought with it a long period of faction, wars, and misery, in which the most notable episode was the sack of Mecca by the Carmathians at the pilgrimage season of A. D. 930. The victors carried off the Black Stone which waso? MECCA 1215 ' S ^ IbiM. f Wtig jelytk not restored for 22 years, and then only for a great ransom, when it was plain that even the loss of its palladium could not destroy the sacred character of the city. Under the Fatimites Egyptian influence began to be strong m Mecca ; it was supposed by Sultans of Yemen, while native princes claiming descent from the Prophet, Hashimite Amirs and after them the Amirs of the hous 3 of Qxtada attamedtogreat authority and aimed at independence ; but soon after the final fall of the Abba. , the Egyptian overlordship was definitely established by Sultan Bibars. The Turkish conquest of Egypt transferred the supremacy to the Ottoman Sultans, who treated Mecca with much favour, and during the 16th century executed great works in the sanctuary and mosque. The Ottoman power, however, became gradually almost nominal and that of the Sharfs increased in proportion, culminating, under Ghalib, whose accession dates from A. D. 1786. Then followed the wars of the Wahhabis and the restoration of Turkish rule by the troops of Muhammad Ah. By him the dignity of Sharif was deprived of much of its weight and in A. D. 1827 a change of dynasty was effected by the appointment of Ibn 'Aun. Afterwards Turkish authority again decayed. Mecca is, however, officiality the capital of a Turkish province and has a Governor- General and a Turkish garrison, while Muhammadan law is established by a judce sent from Constantinople. B it the real sovereign of Mecca and the Hejaz is the Sharif, who as head of the princely family claiming descent from the Prophet, holds a sort of feudal position. The dignity of Sharif, or Grand Sharif as Europeans usually say for the sake of distinction since all the kin of the princely houses reckoning descent from the Prophet are also named Sharif, although by no means a religious pontificate, is highly respected owing to its traditional d?scent in the line of Hasan, son of the fourth Khalif, 'Ali. From a political point of view the Shar f is the modem counterpart of the ancient Amirs of Mecca, who were named in the public prayers immediately after the reigning Khalif. {Murphy.) Safa and Marwah— In religious importance these two points or hills connected by the Masa, stand second only to the Ka'abah, Safa is an elevated platform surmounted by a triple arch and approached by a flight of steps. Ibu Jubair speaks of 14 steps. Ali Bey of 44, Burckhardt of 3, the surrounding ground no doubt has risen so that the old name '' Hil of Safa ' is now inapplicable. It lies south-east of the Ka'abah, facing the black corner and 76 paces from the '' Gate of Safa,'' which is architecturally the chief gate of the mosque. Merwa is a similar platform, formerly covered with a single arch, on the opposite side of the valley. It stands on a spur of the Red Mountain called Jabal Kuaykian. The course between these two sacred points is 493 paces long, and the religious ceremony called the '' Say '' consists in traversing it seven times, beginning and ending at Safa. The lowest part of the course, between the so-called green mile stones, is done at a run. This ceremony which as we shall presently see, is part of the Omra is generally said to be performed in memory of Hagar, who ran to and fro between the two eminences vainly seeking water for her son. The observance, however, is certainly of pagan origin, and at one time there were idols on both the so-called hills. Sharifat of Mecca— The Sharifs of the Imara family are of the Quraish tribe (now only a remnant of about 200 families) and directly descended from Husain, son of the Khaliph ' Ali and of Fatimah the Prophet's daughter. The present Sharifial family dates its power to Sharif Muhammad, Tbn 'Aun, who displaced in 1827 the younger branch represented by his predecessor, Ghalib. He was a friend of Muhammad 'Ali of Egypt. The latter presented the Sharif with 5,700 feddans of land in Upper Egypt, of which 2,000 were constituted wakf. This property is now administered for the Grand Sharif. The family has also about 500 feddans at Dawakhila, near Mehalla, divided between the Sharif, his brother Nasir, his sisters and his mother ; 100 feddans at Bahtin, and properties at Mecca, Taif, west Fatima, west Laimun, and Raiyan. The principal residences of the Sharifs are at Mecca (winter) and Taif (summer). They maintain a princely state and are the most civilized as well as the wealthiest of Arabian potentates.1216 MED—MIA {([.v.), in the bay between Abu MEDI— Ste Midi.

These wells contain good water, but of a very red colour ; it is not far below the surface and there are many wells pits. When Carruthers visited these wells in the spring of 1909, some two or three thousand camels of the Shararat tribe were driven in to be watered which points to an abundant supply of water . Doughty mentions Mghairah as being a stage on the old Haj j camel-post route between Damascus and Madain Salih before the Hejaz railway was opened.

Below Musairah is Mi'aidin, a pretty village under a cliff, well-watered and possessed of date, lime and other trees ; it is composed of 30 houses of Habus. A small hamlet called Misfah is 3 miles below Mi aidin near it the banks of the Wadi begin to recede and decrease in height and vegetation grows more abundant as the exist from the hills is approached ; Misfah con- tains 40 houses of Habus. The crops in the villages are wheat, sugarcane and lucerne; and graps, figs, quinces, limes and pomegranates are grown. The only animals are a score of cattle. In the plain of 'Oman Proper Wadi Mi'aidin passes Birkat-al-M6z, and further on it probably joins Wadi Halfain. The descent into the upper part of the val ley fiom Sharaijah is accomplished by means of an artifical causeway or staircase which is practicable for horses. The valley contains 3 small but perennial streams. The banks of the Wadi exhibit a dark-bluish veined limestone and a very brittle ferru ginous shale. . . f ■ v ,!&lt; n t fx -t ;'.f / ■ »ir • MI'AIDNIYAT— i PrMcltS ^ tW0 0r inc0nsiderable hills in the 'Adan tract {q.v.) of the Kuwait • ' 'A ■&gt; fl M ' • MI'AIJIL (D hula'al)—^ 1 ' ' tt .^ r i £ \ r ! ge 0 f 1 low hdisinthe Kuwait Principality running east and west between the tot m U , r o 1Ct and the SMah wellls ^ Summan.

Also the small valley of Jo Umm Saibah, 2 miles south of Al-Khulah. CCo MIYAH ( Wadi-al)— A long valley or depressed tract in the extreme north of the Sanjaq of Hasa; it is distinguished by its comparative fertility from the regions which surround it upon every side and it owes its name ' The Valley of Waters ' to its numerous wells and springs. Boundaries and extent. —Wadi-al-Miyah is considered to begin in the north at the N a'airly ah hill. From that point its border, curving out to the westwards, runs by the isolated hill of 'Uduwat to the rigde of Abu Dhahair, which it follows southwards to its termination ; the remainder of the boundary on the west side is defined by the northern part of the Taff range. A line which leaves Jabal-at-Taff immediately north of the Jau-al-Ghanam portion of Habl and goes almost straight eastward to Jabal Qadam, marks the limit of Wadi-al-Miyah on the south ; and on the east side its perimeter is completed by an almost straight boundary which runs northwards and very slightly westwards by Jabal Qadam, Jabal Labtalah and Jabal-al-Hass back to Jabal Na'airlyah. With these limits the extent of Wadi-al-Miyah from north to south is about 90 miles and its greatest breadth, which is in the southern half, is about 30 miles. It should bo observed, however, that some Bedouins would greatly increase the dimensions of Wadi- al-Miyah by including in it so much of Habl as lies further west than Jabal Qadam, and even the low-lying parts of Taff as far as the wells Judah ; and Bedouins are also found who consider Sanfan-al-Hanna to be a sub-division of Wadi-al-Miyah. Position. —The districts surrounding Wadi-al-Miyah are thus Warai'ah in the Kuwait Principality upon the north-west, Summan on the west, Habl on the south ; and, on the east, Habl as far north as Jabal Labtalah, then Sanfan-al-Hanna from Jabal Labtalah to Jabal-al-Hass and finally Radaif between Jabal-al-Hass and Jabal Na'airiyah. Physical characteristics. —The soil of Wadi-al-Miyah is dark brown and perfectly cultivable ; the fall of the land is generally from west to east. After heavy rain the ground in the northern part of the district is said to be flooded to such an extent that the Bedouins move all their camps to the southward of Qubaibah where the land is slightly higher. In spring the valley is covered with grass, which is in places 3 feet high, and the water overflows from many of the wells; in summer the water level is generally about 12 feet below the surface. At Bakha, Mughati, Halaislyah and other places there are flowing springs. Population and villages .—Besides the Bedouins who visit the district there is a small settled population, inhabiting the three permanent villages of Nta', Mulaijah and Sarrar and the temporary village of Kahafah ; of these Nta' is described elsewhere under its own name, and the others are dealt with in the paragraph on topography below. The settled population is very mixed and includes representatives of the 'Ajman 'Awazim Bani Khalid, Mutair, Rashaidah and Southern Shammar tribes. The crops generally grown are dates, wheat, barley, maize and lucerne ; livestock are horses, camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats. Notwithstanding the distance from the sea some of the people go to the pearl fisheries. Political position. —The inhabitants of Wadi-al-Miyah are said at the present time to pay Zakat to the Shaikh of Kuwait, but the Shaikh does not regard the district as form ing part of his territories. The local authority is the Shaikh of Nta', at present Ibrahim- bin-'Abdur Rahman. The sites of deserted towns and villages are numerous from which it may be inferred that Wadi-al-Miyah was once more populous and politically more important than it is now; among the places at which these occur are 'Aqair, 'Ataiyiq, 'Awainah, Bakha, Mishafin, Muraighah and Thaj. At some of these places very ancient ruins with non-Arabic inscriptions are alleged to exist; the most consider able remains are at Thaj, where they are said to cover a large area.Name. Position.

MIYAISIN (W adi)— One of the component valley of Wadi Ma'awal {q. v.), in the Western Hajar district of the 'Oman Sultanate. MIYAKHAH— A fendy of the southern Shammar tribe {q. v.), of the 'Abdah division. MIYAY1HAH— Singular Mij^ahi. This tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate are also called Bani Ghafir, but the alternative name is ambiguous and is apt to lead to confusion between the Miyayihah and the Ghafiri political faction, to which they belong and to which they gave their name. The Miyayihah are found chiefly in Western Hajar,, in Wadi Bani Ghafir, where they occupy the villages of Dhab'a (25 houses,) Kahaf (30 houses), Dhawaihir (20 houses), Taiyib (25 houses), Rijlah (20 houses), Qarti (40 houses), Ruwaibi (15 houses), Difa' (30 house ), Marji (50 houses), Khafdi (30 houses), Tabaqah (20 houses), Diha (20 houses). 'Amar (25 houses), and Zawajir (35 houses); in Wadi Sahtan, where they have Khadhra (40 houses); and in Wadi Fara', where their villages are Rustaq (400 houses), Mizahit (65 houses), and Hazam (40 houses): but they also occur at Darlz (200 houses) in Wadi-al- KabTr, at Bait-al-'Ainain (20 houses) in Wadi Sanaisal, and at Wahrah (100 houses) in Wadi Sharsah, in the district of Dhahirah. They are found too at Bahlah in 'Oman Proper (30 houses). Those of Marji and Mizahit belong to a section called Bani Salman, those of Pihas to a section known as SalamiyJn, and those oi Bahlah are Maqarishah, but it has not been possible to obtain a complete account of the subdivisions of the tribe ; there is also a section styled Khanabishah, located in the villages of Nizuk (20 houses) and Madmah (25 houses) in the Wadi-al-Hoqain section of Wadi Bani Ghafir. The Miyayihah are not a very large tribe, numbering perhaps 7,000 souls, but they have a reputation for valour and skill in war, and in 1881 gave ample proof of pugnacity by being simultaneously at feud with eight other tribes. The Miyayihah at Darlz are Sunnis, the rest are Ibadhis : none are Bedouins. The Miyayihah have not now, and never had, as a tribe, any dominant position in the Ghafiri poUtical faction : that the faction was named after them was a circum stance due not to the strength of the tribe but to the personal energy and talents of their Shaikh, Muhammad-bin-Kasir, who commanded the Ghafirlyah in the earliest struggle between that coalition and their rivals the Hinawlyah. The Tamimah of the Miyayihah nevertheless till lately continued to be titular Tamimah of the whole Ghafiri faction, but this is not now the case. In 1881 the office of Tamimah of the Ghafiriyah was held by Barghash-bin-Hamaid, a member of an almost extinct family; he was subsequently murdered by a younger brother, and if the Ghafiris have now a general head, it is probably 'Abdullah-bin-Salim of the Bani Bu 'Ali tribe. The present leading Shaikhs of the Miyayihah are Saif-bin-Hamad and his two brothers in Wadi Bani Ghafir and Muham mad-bin-Sulaiman and his sons at Darlz.

MOKHA (Lat. 13° 20' N., Long. 43° 14' E.)— Formerly the chief port in the Yemen for the coffee trade, but now much diminished in importance. It is situated some 115 miles south by east from Hodaidah, and lies in a small bay between two low points, about 1J miles apart, on each of which are the ruins of a fort. Between these ruins extends the sea-wall, which allows access to the town by a single gate only ; and in front of this gate is a stone pier or jetty, which, like the town itself, is in a state of utter decay. The town extends along the shore, is about half a mile square, and in its days of prosperity must have possessed an imposing appearance. The houses were originally large, white, and built of stone, but are now in ruins, the only buildings now standing, and deserving of note, being the mosques, of which there are several with lolfty minarets. The highest, which is in the eastern quarter of the town, is 118 feet high, and is a good landmark. The streets were always very narrow, and in places have become impassable from the debris. Mokha which belongs to the Mashalahah tribe, no longer holds any position as a trading port. In 1824 it contained about 20,000 inhabitants; in 1882 the population within the walls had dwindled to 1,500, and in 1901 the number was probably not more than 400. A floating population composed of Arab, Somalis, and Jews, lives in huts outside the walls. The total present population within and without probably fluctuates between 5 ,000 and 8,000. The decline of Mokha, once the principal seat of commerce in the Read Sea; seems to have been coincident with the establishment and rise of Aden as a British port, and to have been affected also by the rise and development of Hodaideh. 7 t 2mmmmmmMMummnuBBrnrn 1236 MOM—MOR The country round Mokha is an arid, sterile plain, with little fresh water, the town having been supplied by an acqueduct from the village of Muza, at the foot of the hills, about 24 miles to the eastward. Brackish water may be obtained from wells at Bailili and Suwais, 5 miles to the east. The Mokha roadsteads, with a depth of 3| fathoms, are over a mile westwards of the town, with deeper water farther out, and as there are some shoal patches in the ap proach, care is required in proceeding to the anchorage. On the site of the old south fort stands a red iron framework tower, 167 feet high, at 171 feet above high water, from which is exhibited a white flashing light, visible 19 miles. To the northward of Mokha is Jabal Katairi, a long, wedge-shaped hill terminating in a steep bluff at its northern extreme. South-east by south of the light-tower, near the eastern border of the Tihamah district, is the sharp-peaked Jabal Dubab. Up to the outbreak of the great war a garrison, supposed to be sufficient to serve three batteries, was maintained at Mokha. There is telegraphic communication with (a) Sana'a—via Ta'iz; (b) Hodaidah, via Moshij, Hais, and Zabid; and (c) Perim, overland to Shaikh Sa'id and thence by cable. {Murphy.) MOMAD ( Jabal) (Island)— MORRAH ( al)— They appear to be the wildest, most dangerous, and least civilised of the nomad tribes in this part of Arabia, and to exist, to an appreciable extent, by plunder. They are said to be staunch friends to those whom they recognise as neighbours ; but otherwise they are treacherous and untrustworthy, and they sometimes betray persons who take sanctuary with them. The dialect of Arabic spoken by the Al Morrah is peculiar, and to other Arabs they appear to talk ' in a stammering way,' See Farasan (Islands and Bank); western side. The singular is Morri. A considerable Arab tribe, altogether Bedouin, of eastern Arabia ; they are notorious for their misdeeds ; but otherwise less is known of them than of any other tribe of equal size and importance in the same region of Arabia. Distribution. —The Al Morrah inhabit the country in the south of the Hasa Sanjaq and that adjoining it but lying beyond its border on the same side; some are generally to be found in Kharmah near the wells of Zarnuqah; they visit Barr-adh-Dhahran; and their raiders sometimes infest Wadi Faruq. They are the only inhabitants of the Jafurah desert; Jabrln is their property ; they sometimes visit Qatar in their peregrina tions ; and they frequent the district of 'Aqal to a certain extent. A few Al Morrah are among the Bedouins who resort annually to 'Anik in the Qatlf oasis and who are regarded as having a permanent connection with the place. Religion, character, mode of life and language. —The Al Morrah are Hanbali Sunnia in name, but concern themselves little with religion. The principal wealth of the Al Morrah is in camels ; but they have also some horses and many sheep and goats. Their tents are small and black ; some of them have no tents. Of the sections enumerated below only the Al 'Adhbah, Al Bahaiah, Al Fahaidah and Al Shabib have either kerchiefs or 'Abas. The tribe as a whole avoid towns and villages. Those of the Al Morrah who enter Jafurah do so in winter, and while there they have often no drink other than the milk of their camels and are reduced to boiling their rice in the same. It is said that the sections which frequent Jafurah wear a specially thick footgear made of camel hair to protect their feet from the burning sand, that their complexion is of a swarthiness unusual among Arabs, and that their camels are generally dark-coloured.msmmmm mmam m MORRAH 1237 Divisions and numbers. —The following table contains all that is known about the internal structure of the tribe :—• Section.

Political position. —The Al Morrah are at present at feud with the 'Ajman and the Bani Khalid ; and difficulties between them and the Turkish administration in the Hasa Sanjaq are chronic. The Al Bahaih sub-section are particularly turbulent and obnoxious to their neighbours ; in 1900 they massacred a Shaikh of the Bahrain ruling family with a number of followers at the Bin-'Aqdan well in Barr-adh-Dhahran, where he had come for sport; in 1902 they cut up a Turkish force near 'Oqair Port; in 1905 they committed an unprovoked attack on Bahrain boats at Huwaiqll bay in Barr-al-Qarah ; and in 1906 they repeated their exploit against the Turks at nearly the same place as in 1902 and in much the same circumstances. The Al Morrah when pressed by enemies more powerful than themselves ordinarily take refuge in the inpenetrable Jafurah desert but in 1902 the Turks, after the 'Oqair outrage, succeeded in surprising a large body of them at the wells of Zarnuqah in Kharmah and inflicted on them a sanguinary defeat. The Amirs of the Wahhabis sent frequent expeditions against the Al Morrah ; but one only, led by the Amir Faisal, was partially successful; his forces, however, reached the scene of action in such a feeble State, owing to want of water, that he was obliged to be satisfied with a nominal arrangement and returned to Najd vanquished rather than victorious. In connection with their postal service in the Hasa-Sanjaq the Turks pay small subsi dies to the chief Shaikh of the Al Morrah, to the Shaikhs of the Al 'Adhbah and Ghafran eub-sections, and to Muhammad-as-Sa'ak of the Al Bhaih sub-section ; but these do not avail to secure the good behaviour of the tribe, nor can any revenue be realised from them by the Ottoman Government. About 1865 the Al Morrah were paying the value of $3,000 as revenue to the Wahhabi Amir, and during the recent conflict in Central Arabia they supported the Wahhabi cause, but they are not at present tributaries of Ibn Sa'ud. MORRAH (A l 'A li B in)— A section of the Al Morrah tribe {q.v.). MORRI— The singular form of Al Morrah {q.v.). MOSAL— A hamlet in Dhafrah {q.v.), in Trucial 'Oman. MOSHIJ— « A village in Yemen, nearly 30 miles by road northward of Mokha and roughly midway between Khaukhah and Marsa Faj rah. It consists of well built huts, situated near a headland, and contains 500—1,000 inhabitants, two mosques and a shrine of one AbuMOSUL 1239 Zahar ; there are some gardens and fields irrigated by a watercourse from Jabal Rasian. Moshij'belongs to the Hasasin tribe. The small isolated group of hills 6 or 7 miles east- south-eastward from the village is called Jabalain. Moshij is wrongly shown on some mapo as Musa or Mauza'.—( Wauhope, 1916). MOSUL- An important town in Iraq, situated some 230 miles by road (via right bank of Tigris) north-north-west of Baghdad ; it is a great route-centre, containing about 14,000 houses and with a population of 70,000 souls. There are post and telegraph offices, with communication, before the war, with Baghdad, Diarbakr, Ruwanduz (through Arbil, and Sulaimaniyah (through Kirkuk). General Description. —Mosul stands on the west side of the Tigiris trough and is bounded on the east by the river. To the west of the city the country consists of rocky formations, rising in gentle undulations out of the plain. In the immediate vicinity these formations consist of solid beds of compact, granular, calcareous gypsum, in horizontal strata and non-fossiliferous. This rock is extensively quarried as ' Mosul marble, ' which varies in colour from pure white to bluish gray. Superimposed on the gypsum is a layer of coarse friable limestone, abounding in shells. This layer is thin to the west, but much thicker to the south of the city, where it is extensively quarried for building purposes. The Tigris at Mosul cuts into the side of its trough and threatens some of the buildings of the town. The whole river-bed covered, in high flood, is about 675 yards broad, and there is a deep channel on the west of about 150—200 yards. The bridge of boats crosses the river from a pier 32 yards long opposit the Bab-al-Jiar Gate (in the southern half of the river front) to a gravelly bank which is submerged when the Tigris is in flood. The boat-bridge is 125 yards long, and has a roadway of rough planking 24 feet wide, which is laid on 17 pontoons, flat-bottomed boats 26 feet long by 10 feet wide, with a waterway 10 feet between each and its neighbour. The gravelly bank on the east side of the river is crossed by a bridge of brick faced with sandstone, which is laid at an bangle of about 45° to the boat-bridge. The masonry bridge is approached from the pontoon-bridge by a ramp 46 yards long, and has a total length of 278 yards; the roadway, which is 16 feet wide, is laid on 29 arches, each of 20 feet span, and at the eastern end there is a ramp 52 yards long. Beyond the east end of the masonry bridge the road may be under water for as much as 150 yards in the flood season. In high flood the boat-bridge is removed, and the river is then crossed by boats. These boats (of which about 30 used to be available) are each about 24 feet long by 8 feet wide- They are punt-shaped, with the stern cut down to allow animals to go on board. Each boat can take 6 laden mules. The boat-bridge may be expected to be in position from some time in the early part of June to the end of March. The town of Mosul, though dusty, glaring, and treeless, is not unpicturesque at a distance, the outline of the walls|being broken by numerous domes, minarets and towers. The city is partially surrounded by badly built rubble walls, 15—20 feet high, with a thickness of about 6 feet at the bottom and 3 feet at the top. These were constructed at the beginning of the last century as a protection against Bedouin raids, and are now out of repair. In many places they have already been breached, and the ditch has been filled in. There are 11 gates. On the river side, houses have been built into the wall, and their windows look out on to the river. To the north and west there is an expanse of waste land between the houses and the walls. To the south, beyond the Bab-as Sarai, the river is fringed with mud houses inhabited by raftsmen, boatmen, and fishermen. Behind these houses is a broad road planted with trees, and east of this is a broad open space used partly as the drill-ground of the garrison, and partly, apparently, as a cattle market. At the end of the road, about f mile from tho city gate, are the barracks and Government offices, and the residences of the Wali and other officials. The post and telegraph offices lie on the road somewhat nearer to the town. The streets of Mosul are narrow, undrained lanes, winding between blank house walls. A few of the streets are paved with stones, which make very slippery going. The houses are built of sundried bricks or of stone (' Mosul marble ') set in gypsum cement. Little wood is used in their construction. The larger houses are built roundMOSUL a court-yard, into which the rooms and a dlwdn open. They usually have sardahs, or underground rooms, for use in the hot weather. The number of houses has been estimated at 12,000. There are numerous mosques and several large khans. The bazaars are held in booths in the streets. About the middle of the river front, not far above the bridge, is an old citadel. The church of the French Dominican Mission is marked on a plan of 1873 as slightly west of the centre of the town. Mosul is not an attractive place ; it is insanitary and dirty, with a bad climate and smoky atmosphere. The smoke comes from the gypsum kilns. The most un pleasant quarter appears to be a cluster of some 300 houses near the river, which serves as ' abattoir, tannery, and dyary for the whole town In 1906 it was stated that the Government had twice endeavoured to abolish this quarter, but on both occasions the attempt had provoked a riot. Climate and Hygiene. —The climate of Mosul is very trying in the summer. The worst part of the hot weather is from July to September, when the thermometer may go as high as 120° Fe. in the day, and not fall below 95° at night. Hot winds blow in from the desert. Even in May a temperature of 100° may be looked for, and the cool season does not begin till November. In the cool weather, which is also the rainy season, the nights are often frosty. Owing to the glare and the dust, the amount of which is appreciably increased by the numerous kilns and pounding mills in which gypsum is worked, ophthalmia is common, and tuberculosis is said to be ' terribly prevalent. Cholera, on the other hand, is not common, though its existence has been suspected. Visitations of plague are reported. Mosul has its ' boil,' from which few who reside there long escape; it is said to be not distinguishable from the Baghdad ' date-mark. ' Almost all travellers comment on the filthy and isanitary conditions of the place ; which, in the opinion of one observer, call for the abandonment of the place and the building of a new town on another site. Sulphur springs, some of them hot, are found near the Tigris both above and below Mosul {e.g., al Hammam ' Ali), and are much resorted to for medicinal purposes. A hot eddying wind—the Sam—which blows in the desert west of the city, is said occasionally to affect fatally those who are exposed to it. It is sometimes possible to avoid its worst effects by lying on the ground. Supplies and Commerce. —In spite of its arid appearance much of the country from which Mosul is supplied is fertile, and agriculture has on the whole been developing during the past twenty or thirty years. There are said to be about 200 flour-mills in the city. In normal times the bazaars of the town are well stocked with grain, fruit and meat. The principal crops of the Mosul country are wheat and barley, which ripen in April, and among the minor produce may be mentioned lentils, peas, beans, millet, maize, cucumbers, as well as many fruits—melon, orange, fig, plum, pear and grape. The date palm grows but does not fruit freely. Sheep and goats were numerous before the present war. The water-supply is not satisfactory ; there are numerous wells, but they are brackish; and the people rely for their drinking supplies on the Tigris, from which the water is brought on ponies in skins. The Tigris water is considered good except when the river is low. Schemes for a municipal water-supply has been talked of for years, but nothing has been done. There is much excellent spring grazing near Mosul . Wood for fuel seems scarcely to be found in the neighbourhod of the city. In normal times timber is brought from the Kurdish hills. Mosul would make a good centre for the collection of transport animals of all kinds. In peace time numerous donkeys, mules, horses, and camels could be obtained here. In the middle ages Mosul was an important entrepot and manufacturing centre, and was celebrated for its jewellery, _a.rms and carpets as well as for cotton and silk and embroidered fabrics (the word ' muslin' is said to be derived from the name of the town). Misrule insecurity of transport, the introduction of cheap machine-made goods, and the diversion of trade by the Suez Canal have in various ways affected its prosperity, but there are still a considerable number of gold and silversmiths, of workers in non an copper, o shoemakers, and above all of weavers ; and only security is required to increase very largely its commercial importance. Mosul is a distributing wmBflHHflHHHHHHRHHHHflHHHSHRHHHHRHHHHBHHBHHI iihhhhhhhhhhhhhbhhhbhih Oir MOSUL 1241 centre for European goods imported through Aleppo, and for Indian goods which come through Baghdad ; and to it are brought for re-export the abundant raw products and the textile fabrics of Kurdistan and N.-W. Persia. The following statistics (giving value in £ sterling) for 1012 show that before the war trade was still on a fairly extensive scale: United Kingdom .. India Other foreign countries Other parts of Turkey Total Imports. Exports. £ £ 51,000 163,000 41,000 22,000 56,000 53,000 148,000 238,000 30,000 188,000 178,000 426,000 Grand Total The chief articles of import were cotton piece-goods and yarn, and the demand was increasing in spite of the superior durability of locally woven articles. Iron and copper were always in large demand, Swedish iron being much used. From France came tanned leather and cigarette papers, from Austria broadcloths, from India cotton goods, coffee, and gunnies, from Persia carpets. Petroleum was also imported. The imports from other parts of Turkey included piece-goods, soap (from Aleppo), dates (from Baghdad), dried fruits, peas, and nuts. The main exports to other countries were wool, hides and skins, boots and shoes ; and to other parts of Turkey wheat, sheep and cattle, galls, hides, and fruits. In favourable seasons exports of wheat were on a very large scale ; in 1908 their value amounted to £ 200,000. There is a large local production of flour, the number of mills being not less than 200, and there is a good opening for the introduction of western methods of milling. About 40 miles from Mosul, near the bank of the Tigris, are the Kaiyara naphtha springs' which yield a thick black product. In 1908 the right of exploitation was leased to a native of Arbil, who sold the refined product at his own village at 9 to 15 piastres for 4 gallons. Inhabitants. —Fully three quarters of the peopic are Muhammadans, and practically all of these are Sunnis. The Mosulis are a race of mixed origin, their language being Arabic. They have a bad reputation for turbulence, cruelty, and viciousness. In normal times there is a considerable floating population of Arabs and Kurds. The Christians (perhaps about 15,000) are chiefly Syriac speaking and belong to various sects—the Chaldae uis. West Syrian Catholics, and Jacobites arc all represented ; there are also some Nestorians. There is a large and important French Dominican Mission in Mosul, and at the Dominican mission-school many of the Chaldseans and West Syrian Catholics have learnt to speak French. There are also a few native Protestants, the converts of an American mission ; some of these probably speak English. The strong Jewish colony lives in a quarter oi its own. Administration and Authorities. —The municipal administration before the war was in the hands of the Wali of the province and a council of notables. This council has a particularly evil fame for corruption and intrigue. Its members are wealthy merchants and landowners, some of the latter being descended from the Arab oligarchy which ruled Mosul in the eighteenth century. So far as they could not make the Turkish officials their tools, they were generally in more or less concealed opposition to the Wali's ad ministration. For the furtherance of their ends they used their money and influence among the lower classes of the city, and they have been known covertly to instigate violent outbreaks of riot. The Chaldaian Christians have a patriarch in Mosul; the West Syrian Catholics and Jacobites have their respective bishops. There was also before the war a Papal Legato with supervisory powers over the Uniate churches of the country. In 1914 there was a French consul at Mosul, and also British, Russian, and German vice-consuls. C52(w)GSB 7u1242 MOZ—MUA MOZ (B irkat -A l )— A large village in the 'Oman Sultanate on the northern limits of the plain of 'Oman Proper, situated at the point about 6 miles west of Izki where Wadi Mi'aidin emerges from Jabal Akhdhar. It consists of three Huj rahs or quarters, appropriated respectively to the A1 'Umair, to the Bani Riyam and to tenants of A1 Bu Sa'idi landlords ; the po pulation is about 1,400, about 1,250 belonging to the Bani Riyam and 150 to other tribes. There are large date-groves containing about 15,000 trees, and the plantains to which the place owes its name are numerous. Irrigation is by Falaj. Bait Rud- aidah, a fort and residence, consisting of a rectangular enclosure with an upper storey and towers at the corners, lies to the west of the village and is separated from Bir- kat-al-M6z by a conical hill with a watch-tower commanding the water-supply. This fort belonged in 1870 to a relation of the Sultan of 'Oman, one Hamad, son of Hilal-bin-Muhammad who was murdered by Qais in 1864 ; it is at present (1906) in bands of the Bani Riyam, who are holding it against the Sultan. MSHORAB— A small administrative sub-division of the Hindiyah Qadha {q.v.) situated on both banks of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah. MSHAORAB (C anal). A canal taking off from the Shatt-al-Hindiyah {q. v.) in 'Iraq. MSHORAB-AL-GHARBI ') Two agricultural tracts in the Hindlvah Qadha {q.v.) in MSHORAB-ASH-SHARQI ) 'Iraq. MTAR (Sha'ib Abu)— One of the Wadi heads of Wadyan {q.v.) northern central Arabia.— {Leachman, 1912.) MU'ADHDHAM— Also called 'Adhamlyah : a small town in 'Iraq on the left bank of the Tigris opposite to Kadhimain and distant 2 miles north-westwards from the nearest part of Baghdad City. Mu'adhdham is connected with Kadhimain by a bridge of 21 boats, and with Baghdad by an unmetalled road—very little better than a ploughed field—on which ply public conveyances drawn by four mules and many hackney carriages. The population of Mu'adhdham is about 2,000, and almost all are Sunni Muham- madans. Some good houses on the bank of the river serve as villas to wealthy merchants of Baghdad ; but the principal object of interest is the tomb of the great Sunni theolo gian Abu Hanlfah, which is distinguished by a fine dome of blue tile-work ; entrance is denied to Christians. The Mutawalliship of this shrine is hereditary in a local family. The chief industry is the tanning of skins and hides with gall-nuts from Musal: there are about 40 tanneries, employing a large number of hands and turning out about . 5,000 pieces a week. The brokers and merchants of Baghdad visit the yards once a week to make their purchases ; and the leather, though technically known as rough-tanned, is of good quality and commands a ready sale in Europe. The red and yellow shoes called Yamanis are made at Mu'adhdham and sold wholesale at Baghdad ; and some of the market-gardens which supply the city are at Mu'adhdham. There is a small bazar. Under Turkish rule Mu'adhdham was the chef-lieu of a Xahiyah in the Baghdad Qadha and the seat of a Mudlr : it was also the headquarters of a Radlf battalion. MU'ADHDHAM (Q al'at-al)— A station on the Hejaz railway, 515 miles from Damascus {Maunsdl). The qaVah, now abandoned, and the cistern, now ruinous and without water, were formerly the best on the Syrian Hajj route. It has an elevation of 3,250 feet. The Fuqarah, and the Khuthara section of the Bani Atiyah, roam about here. In the vicinity of Qal'at- fil-Mu'adhdham is a rock known to the Bedouines as Khubbat-ath-Thamathil and scored over with inscriptions.MTJA—MUB 1243 MU 'ABHDHAM (Wadi-AL)— A valley in north-west Arabia ; it rises in the high ground near Dar-al-Hamra and drains north-westward. Wadi-al-Mu'adhdham appears to be the name of the upper reach of Wadi-as-Sani {q.v.), or Wadi-al-Akhdhar, as it is often called, MUAISIL— A place two hours' journey north-east from Jauf-al-'Umr on the road from Sakakah, It is not far from the hamlet of Jawah and consists of an old disused castle, a spring, and two wells.— {Butler and Aylmer, February, 1908.) MU'ALLA— One of the divisions of the Bani Lam tribe {q.v.), in 'Iraq.

MIPAWDAH— A small tribe of Maliki Sunnis in Bahrain, pearl merchants, owners of date gardens and navigators in every part of the Persian Gulf and even in seas outside it. They claim descent from the 'Anizah of Najd and are supposed to have come to Bahrain with the 'Utub from Kuwait and Qatar. They have now only 20 houses at Muharraq Town. MUAZ A small tribe in Yemen living round Muza, to the eastward of Mokha. MUBARAK— See Dawasir tribe of southern Najd ; 'Ammar sub-division of the Al Hasan. MUBARAKIYAH— A hill in that division of Riyadh {q.v.) which lies to the south of Sabakhat-as-Summ. MUBARRAZ— The next town in importance in the Hasa Oasis after Hofuf, from which it is distant 2 miles due northwards. Surroundings. —On the west of Mubarraz is the desert; on the other 3 sides it is en closed by cultivaion. A raised causeway which connects it with Hofuf traverses a heavily irrigated country, full of ponds and springs of tepid water. Immediately outside the town on the north side in the Harah spring, while the springs of Marjan and Nadharah adjoin respectively its south-western and its south-eastern corner : these are all describ ed in the article on the Hasa Oasis. At half a mile westwards from the town is the Bedouin camping ground called Hazam. A cemetery extends along the south side of the town. Defences. —Mubarraz is enclosed only by a ruinous wall without a ditch. The only military work is a fort called Qasr Sahud which is just outside the town wall on the west 7u2\ 1244 MUBARRAZ side, between it and Hazam. Un ler Turkish rule the garrison was a quarter of a bat talion of regular infantry in Qasr Sahud and 25 mounted and 10 unmounted Dhabitiyahs in the town. Quarters, gates and buildings.—The town consists of 5 FarTqs or quarters, which are as follows:— Karae. Position. Houses and inhabitants. Remarks. 'Ayuni (Far'q-al) 'Itban (Farlq-al) .. Embraces the cen tral and south western portions of the town. Occupies the middle of the northern face of the town. 700 houses mostly of non -Bedouin Sumi Arabs. The chief family in this quar ter are the Bin 'Afaliq. 400 houses, mostly of Sh 'ahs ; but there are still a few also of the settled 'Ataibah from whom the quarter is said to take its name. The residence former ly occupied by the Turkish Mudlr is in this quarter, so also are the market place or Suq and the Qais- r riyah; the latter is a small collection of permanently oc cupied shops in the market place. Muqabil (FarTq-al) Situated in the north-east comer, having 'Itban to the west and Sha' abah to the south of it. 70 houses, mostly of Sunnis. Sha'abah (Farlq-ash] Forms the south-east ern end of the town and has Muqabil and 'Itban to the north-west and 'Avuni to the west of it. 200 houses, chiefly of Shi'ahs. The leading man in this quarter is at Hasan- bin- Bishr. Siyasib (Far7q-as) Is on the north-west side and is met by 'Itban on the east and by 'Ayuni on the south. 300 houses, the ma jority of Sunnis. Shaikh ' Abdullah- bin-Sa'dun, a resi- sident of this quarter, is headman of the whole town and descended from its ancient rulers. He traces his origin to the Bani Khalid.MUB—MXJB 1215 There'arc only two gates in the town wall, one on the north and one on the south side; the former called Darvvazat-al-'Itban, is in the 'Itban quarter ; while the latter, known as Darwazat-al-'Anainah, is in the eastern end of the wall belonging to Ayum. The houses of Mubarraz are mostly of stone and lime, but some are of unburnt bnck. Inhabitants.— From the table in the preceding paragraph it will be f«een that the popula tion of Mubarraz is about 8,500 souls ; of these about four-fifths are Sunnis» The people are all settled Arabs and there are not many foreigners among them ; a few immigrants from Najd are found, but none from Persia or even from Bahrain. , ,, Resources, trade and industries.—The best drinking water is obtained from the Mar] an spring. The interests of the town are largely agricultural, but it has a market which is resorted to by Bedouins on account of the springs and grazing which enable them to encamp near by ; the Bedouin trade however is smaller than at Hofuf. A Friday fair is held in the Suq around the Qaisariyah ; the number of booths at this weekly fair is said to reach 250. . Administration. —Mubarraz is the head-quarters of a ^Nahiyah. MUBARRAZ— One of the quarters of Lailah {q. v.), in the Aflaj district of Xajd. MUBARRAZ (H alat-al)— An islet in the Persian Gulf, lying 53 nautical miles westward of Abu Dhabi in Trucial 'Oman. It is low, narrow, and sandy, without vegetation, about half a mile in length, and only 3 or 4 feet above high water. It lies on the south-eastern edge of the great detached reef called Rak-al-Hajji. This reef has not been surveyed, but it is probably about 8 or 9 miles in length and breadth, and there are one or two sandbanks on it, dry at low water. The channel, Khor Bashubar, southward of this islet, between Rak-al- Hajji and the Bazam reef, has 7 or 8 fathoms water and is about 1J miles wide. MUBASILI— A section of the Siyabiyln tribe {q. v.) of the 'Oman Sultanate. MUBASILI (Bu)— An alternative name for the hamlet of Rissah in Wadi Saijani (q.v.) in Eastern Hajar 'Oman Sultanate. MUBBIAT (Al)— A ruined site in north-western Arabia, two hours' journey to the south-east of Al 'Ali. It lies in a plain with a loam and clay bottom and crusted with salt. The ruins are of mud buildings, some being of mud and stone. There are a few acacia trees. {Doughty, 1876-78.) MUBHIL (W adi)— One of the tributary valleys of Wadi-ar-Rummah {q.v.). MUBRAKAT-AN-NAQAH— A remarkable gorge in Hejaz. It is a sharp and narrow descent, some 18 or 20 miles in length, between sandstone cliffs, and opens out on to the plain of Madain Salih, or Al- Hajr. The Hejaz railway and the Syrian Hajj road pass through this gorge. Its chief feature is the quaint and fantastic forms into which the sandstone rocks have been weathered. Out of the ribbed surface of rolling sand, which forms the floor of the gorge, spring, in endless succession, tall towers and pinnacles, gigantic hummocks and needles, and soaring monstrosities of warm-hued rock of every conceivable and inconceivable shape, and only separated by narrow chasms and clefts. At a point 578 miles by rail from Damascus is Al-Muzhim, which in the form of El- Mezham is the name applied by the Arabs to the whole of this region ; the railway then enters the gorge. Mubrakat-an-Naqah, or Mubrak-an-Naqah (pronounced ndga) means the place where the cow-camel fell on her knees, this gorge being the scene of the death of Nabi Salih's miraculous camel concerning which the legend is briefly as follows.MUD—MUD In ancient times these regions were peopled by the tribe of Thamud, who, according to Arabian writers was fourth in direct descent from Noah through his son Sham. Tha Thamudites rejected his teaching and asked from him a sign from God. Their request wa-, granted and accordiagly the rocks in the Mubrakat-an-Naqah opened and there issued from them a female camel big with young. Two months later the camel gave birth to a calf which was watered at the well now seen in the courtyard of the fort at Madain Salih, and called the Bir-an-Naqah in consequence. But the wicked tribe still spurned the prophet, and impiously hamstru ig and slew the mother camel. A terrible vengeance followed ; three days later a great noise shook the heavens and the Thamudites were found lying on their faces stone dead. The camel-calf fled to the great table-rock of Al-Huwwarah (q. v.), and there the rocks opened and received the calf once more. {Doicghfy; Clemow, 1913.) A locality on the right bank of the Tigris [q. v.) between 'Ali-al-Gharbi and KuraaitJ There is also a canal of this name which takes out from the Tigris in this tract. Where it enters the marsh is about 1| hours from the river by mashhuf, but the canal continues along the western side of the mar-h towards Hai. Width of marsh, two hours' journey from east to west; depth of canal and marsh more than 6 feet. A helium with a load of two tughdrs could proceed the whole length of the canal and marsh. In April, 1916, the Mudailil canal was reconnoitred for 3| miles from its mouth as far as Shahiyah. Breadth and depth at mouth, 75 and 101 feet respectively. At Shahiyah breadth is only slightly decreased, depth 8 feet. According to the local Arabs the canal extends as far as Sadirah in Fahad's territory 24 miles from mouth, where it enters a marsh which extends to within 14 miles of Hai. Canals off the Shatt-al-Hai do not flow into the above marsh, and therefore direct water communication between Tigris vid Mudailil and the Shatt-al-Hai is not possible. MUDAMMAN— See Dannan.

Distribution.—The headquarters of the tribe are in Persian territory, and a majority of the Muhaisin are probably Persian subjects ; but they also occur in large, and perhaps not much inferior numbers in 'Iraq. In Persia the Muhaisin occupy all that part of the Muhammareh District which lies north and west of the Karun and they are found in some of the northern and eastern villages of 'Abbadan island to the south of it; they also extend up the banks of the Karun into the Ahwaz District, where there principal settlements are Maqtu', Khifi, Milaihan, Moran, Farsiyat, Isma'ili, Chimaiyan, Qajanyeh, Dr slyeh, Nathareh and Salaihawiyeh, but of these only Milaihan, Isma'ili and Qajaryeh are occupied at other seasons than those of cereal cultivation.

Bait Wddi. —The Shaikh is 'Arabi ibn Wadi, known as 'Araibi Pasha, who liveg at a village called Mus'aidah, 20 miles south east of 'Amarah, on the Chahalah canal. He farms the large Chahalah estate extending along the left bank of Tigris, from the Chahalah canal the Xahr Husainiyah south-wards the Chahalah to about 14 miles north of Qal'at Salih. It includes valuable rice land in the marshes at the tail and of the Chahalah and its branches. He holds also the lease of the small 'Uwaijlah estate on the Musharrah. 'Araibi came in at the occupation of 'Amarah and appears to have been staunch. Strength about 4,000 footmen. 2. Bait Khalifah. —The Shaikh is Majid ibn Khalifah who lives at Majar-al-Kabir, a small town about 18 miles from 'Amarah on the canal of the same name. He farms the Majar-al-Kabir estate which extends along the Tigris from the mouth of the Majar- al-Kabir to below Muzaniyah some 8 miles above Qal'at Salih, and inchidcs very rich lands at the tail end of Majar-al-Kabir towards the marshes. Majid's conduct has not been quite satisfactory and he is reported to have corres ponded with the Turks freely at times. Majid practically controls the Fartus Arabs, who cultivate part of his rice lands, and graze their buffaloes in and near his limits. Majid has a following of about 8,000 men. 3. Bait Fcmr.—Up to July 1916, two brothers named 'Usman and Zabun ibn Yasir were Shaikhs of this section. Zabun refused to obey the orders of Government and was turned out of his lands, his brother Usman being put in as Shaikh over all the lands.MUHAMMAD 1255 'Usman Is now in occupation of the country on left bank of Tigris from some 14 miles above Qui'at Salih down to Ezra's Tomb and has extensive rice lands at the outflow of the Michiriyah canal and its branches, but these have been reduced in value by the damming of the Michiriyah. He has acted at all times in a friendly and straightforward manner. His following number about 1,000 foot and he controls, though to a limited extent, the Xawafil section of Shaddah (descendants of Bait Shudaiyid), and the Hulaichiyah, a section of the Sarrai. These number probably another 1,000 rifles. 'Usman lives about 6 miles inland from Qal'at Salih on the Michiriyah canal. 4. Bait Saihud. —Falih ibn Saihud, the Shaikh of this section, leases the Hafirah, Jamshah and Kasrah estate on right bank of Tigris from 8 miles about Qal'at Salih to immediately below Ezra's Tomb. He lives about 8 miles up the Hafirah canal which takes off opposite Qal'at Salih. Falih has behaved very well since our occupation of 'Amarah and appear to have dealt with us in a straightforward manner, but his brother, 'Abdul Karim, is of very doubtful Virtues. • Falih has a following of about 800 men and also controls to a limited extent the A1 Bu Bukhit Arabs (section of Shaddah) camped in his limits just below Ezra's Tomb. Another brother of Falih's, by name Hatim, with whom he is on very bad terms, occupied the small estate of Jawwar, lying a few miles inland from the Tigris on the right bank between the Jawwar and Majar-al-Kabir Canals. Hatim's following is some 200 foot. Hatim's son Tahir, who quarrelled and separated from his father, leases the estate of Jurait situated on the left bank of Chahalah canal. Neither Hatim nor Tahir had a very savoury reputation, but they behaved well from the date of our occupation, until November, 1916, when Hatim fled to the Turks, alleging grievances with regard to water and boundaries. His estate was leased for one year to Majid al Khalifah. B . -Bait 'Ahud. —Are now split up into small insignificant sections and scattered throughout the territories of Baits Wadi, Khalifah, Yasir and Saihud. They comprise among other the following sections :■—• 'Ali, al bu. Baidhan, al. Haddam, al. Khulaifah, Bait. Masalikh, al. Mutair, al bu. Shumaiyil, Bait. Their following have been included in the numbers given for Al bu Muhammad Shaikhs, C, —Bait Shudaiyid. —From this are descended the Shaddah which comprise four chief sections :—- 1.

Though they are marsh people they are described as not Ma'dan but Al bu Muhammad. No one has any authority over them and like all tribes who live in the isolation of the swamps, their habits are primitive. They are buffalo owners and have no culti vated ground. The principal sections are as follows :—• Bukhit, al lu. Men. 'Aufi, Bait. .. Musallam ibn Musa'ad .. ..100 Furaij, Bait. Ghuwainim, Bait Nakhsh, Bait. Saqr, Bait. 100 30 100 200 Jabbarah ibn Thajil .. Sarhan Mughtadh Janzil ibn Kuwaili .. All sections are constantly moving. Their present position is roughly from the Nahr, Safhah to Haddamah, on the river bank of the Tigris. The Baits /Aufi, Furaij and Saqar are together immediately below Haddamah and a part of the Bait Saqr is on the oppo site bank, below Nahr al Rof: the Bait Nakhsh is close to Sakhrichah, the Bait Ghuwai nim, the smallest and worst section, a little further south. The figures given are appro ximate only. The Shaddah Arabs, with the exception of Al bu Ghannam, who transplant nee, in the marshes in 'Araibi's territory, are not cultivators, but move with their buffaloes as they find necessary for grazing. In the cold season they generally move further into the marshes, coming down close to river during the hot months. They make and sell mats and cut reeds from the marshes for sale. Shaddah Arabs probably number some 2,000 men. The Al bu Muhammad control the Ma'dan tribes, Al Fartus [q.r.) and the Bait Haddad (q.v.) BAIT HADDlD— A small Ma'dan tribe controlled by Falih al Saihud (Al Bu Muhammad).^ Their principal Shaikh is Sultan ibn Marzuq. They have a few baits south of Manjabi and range up to the Jamshah district. No fixed habitation. They may number some 250 men. FARTUS, A l— Originally Ahl Jazair, a constituent of the Bani Asad, by whom they were driven out of the Chabaish district into the Hor. The Bani Asad now deny their claim to kinship. The Fartus are split up into many sections and with few exceptions are cultivators with, and at present subservient to, Majid al Khalifah of the Al Bu Muhammad. They own a' large number of buffaloes. The question of taxation was always a bone of contention between the Azairij and Majid al Khalifah as, during certain periods of the year, they cross for grazing purposes into territory claimed by the Azairij. Previously many of the Fartus were cultivators with the Azairij and a few odd families are still with Shaikh Shawai. In August 1916 a section of the Fartus made a raid on the Tigris. The 'IranMUH—MUH 1257 section is on the Tigris, immediately south-west of Ezra's Tomb. The principal sections are:— 'Asafrah, al .. .. .. ., Muhi. 'Attas, al ., .. .. .. Rukn ibn Musa. ' Mukallaf ibn Shukhaiyir. Briish, al bu .. .. ,. ., Kumaiyish ibn Ghailan. ^badi, al Ju'aidhir. Iran, al .. .. .. ,, Hatim ibn Ruwaihi. Burhan bin Muhammad. Hamid ibn al 'Aiwis.

Mani ibn Dhamin. Ziyarah, al bu. .. .. .. ,. Lazim ibn Jaulan. Sultan ibn Mizban. The 'Asafrah, Birish, 'Ibadi, Ras and Sumailmat are known collectively as Al Hatrah and are controlled by Faris ibn Tahir, the most important of the Fartus Shaikhs. The 'Attas and the Ziyarah are under the control of Rukn ibn Musa and Mukallaf ibn Shu khaiyir. It has been arranged with the Azairij and Majid that the Fartus should occupy Ja'far al Saghir, a small island on the eastern fringe of the marsh opposite Ja'far al Kabir, and for grazing purposes should go south-west of Saighal in the Chabaish direction. They have recognised settlements in Majid' territory at 'Adl and 'Aqal. Faris is mostly on Ja'far al Saghir in Majid's territory and Majid is responsible also for Mukallaf. They number probably 2,500 men (rifles) but are not united.

Sharm Shaikh and Sharm-al-Moiya. {Obs. spot, Lat. 27° 51' 5' N., Long. 34° 16' 50' E-).—About 8 miles northward from Ras Muhammad are the two small harbours Sharm Shaikh and Sharm-al-Moiya, separated from each other by a rocky tongue of land, from 50 to 70 feet in height. The western harbour, Sharm Shaikh, derives its name from the tomb of a Shaikh at its eastern extreme ; it is more capacious and has a wider entrance than the other. It affords good anchorage abreast of the tomb, about 1J cables from the shore, in about 14 fathoms, sand, but care must be exercised in taking up a berth as the bank drops abruptly into deep water. The entrance to the completely sheltered harbour of Sharm-al-Moiya is 11 cables wide, but so obstructed by coral banks that a vessel drawing more than 10 feet can only make its way between these obstacles with great caution, and there is no anchorage outside them. It has a depth of about 6 fathoms within the outer reef, shoaling towards its head. There are wells in Sharm-al-Moiya containing but little water, and that brackish ; they are on the western side of the Bay, about 150 yards from the shore. From this place, Mount Sinai may be reached, in 2| days, by a comparatively good road. C52(w)GSB 71258 muh—muh Between Ras Muhammad and these harbours there is no anchorage on the coast; the mountains are close to the sea and present a grand range, from 3,000 to 5,000 feet high, extending both north-eastward and north-westward.

This water is quite salt, in spite of there being a spring of fresh water at the bottom of the pool. The fresh water comes up through a pipe about 3' in diame ter, let in flush with the ground ; it comes out with considerable force, bubbling to the sur face at high water.

MUHARRAQ TOWN— The principal town of Muharraq Island and the second in the principality of Bahrain ; as it is the head quarters of the Shaikh during eight months in the year it may even claim to be the political and administrative capital of the Shaikhdom. Situation and general character. —Muharraq is surrounded by the sea at high water on the eastern, southern and western sides, and its situation is low ; nevertheless, as seen from Manamah harbour, it stands up handsomely in the afternoon or evening light. Its distance from Manamah, which it exceeds in area though it is not equal to it in population, is about 2 miles, measured across the shallow strait which divides the Muharraq and Bahrain Islands. Muharraq fort, more correctly described as the fort of Abu Mahur, stands on an island and is 800 yards south of the town, but it is no longer of military importance ; near it is the celebrated submarine spring of Abu M»hur which supplies the town of Muharraq with most of its drinking water. The sea, closely approaching the town on three sides at high water, is the scavenger of Muharraq and removes at inter vals of a few hours the town refuse which is deposited at its edge. Inhabitants and qmrters .—The population of Muharraq Town is now about 20,000 souls, who may be classified as below ; 'Ainain (Al Bu) 'Ali (Al Bin-) .. 'Amamarah ^ Arabs (miscellaneous non-Bedouin) Baharinah Dha'in (Al) Huwalah Kuwalah (Al Bj) Manana'ah Mu'awdah Musallam (Al) .. Negroes (free) ..

MUH—MUJ Of the 'Utub mentioned in this table, 30 houses are A1 Fadhaland 30 are Jalahimah. The Baharinah and the Persians are all craftsmen: they being the only Shi'ahs it is obvious that the Sunni form of Islam here enjoys a great ascendancy. During the hot months the bulk of the inhabitants forsake the town and encamp in the north-eastfern part of Bahrain Island. The Farlqs or quarters of the town are these :— 'Ali (A1 Bin-). 'Amamarah. 'Arar. 'Asfur (Al). Dha'in (Al). Haiyak. Khamis (Al Bu). Kharu. Kuwarah (Al Bu). Manana'ah. Mu'awdah. Qumarah. Yusuf-bin-Ibrahim (Al). and Ziyainah. Most of them, as will be apparent, are called after the tribes inhabiting them. Occupations, trade, shipping and resources. —Muharraq Town contains a bazaar, the only one on the island, of about 300 shops. The people of Muharraq Town are general merchants, shopkeepers, pearl merchants, pearl divers, sailors, fishermen, boatmen, bakers, barbers, butchers, tailors, shoemakers masons, carpenters, tin-workers, water-sellers and washermen. Trade is considerably less than at Manamah ; but the pearl diving proportion of the community is many times greater. More than 700 vessels, some of considerable size, belong to Muharraq Town : they are 40 Bat Is, 141 Bams, 68 Baqarahs, 189 Shu'ais and Sambuks and 396 Mashuwahs and jollyboats ; of these 282 are used as pearl boats. There are no date palms. Animals belonging to the town are 80 horses, 220 donkeys and 150 cattle. MUHASHlR— A section of the Bani Khalid tribe {q. v.), of eastern Arabia. MUHAWIRAH— A section of the Sabai' tribe {q. r.) of Najd. MUHAZZAH— A hamlet in Sitrah Island {q. v.), in the Bahrain Archipelago.

At the present time (1916) the Shaikh is Al-Bukash, of the Kurashiyah tribe.MUJ—MUK 1265 MUJAWtR— One of the Aqra' group of the rural tribes of 'Iraq (7. r.). MUJDAIR— A tract in the Pibdibah steppe, Kuwait Principality ; it is bounded on the north-east by the gravelly desert of Al-Qara'ah and on the north-west by that of Subhan, both of which are portions of Dibdibah. On the south it adjoins the huge distcict of Summan but on the south-east the boundary between Mujdair and the parent tract of Dibdibah is indeterminate. The centre of Mujdair lies about 30 miles to the north-east of the wells of As-Safah. MUJIYAN— A ridge sand, forming a landmark, in the Nafud (f^. v.), in northern eeucral Arabia. MUKAINIS— A halting place in the interior of Qatar {q. v.), eastern Arabia. MUKAIYAR (J azirat-al)— Anislet off the east coast of Qatar (q. v.)^ eastern Arabia. MUKALLA— Next to Aden, the principal port on the southern coast of Arabia, is situated about 300 miles east-north-east irom Aden, and is built partly on a rocky point between two bays and partly in terraces (like a miniature Genoa) on a slope at the foot of a reddish lime stone cliff which rises to a height of about 300 feet immediately at the back of the town, and on which are four conspicuous towers for the protection of the place ; it is, in fact, the only place between Aden and Masqat with any pretensions to a port. The town is protected on the western side by a wall which extends from the cliff to the shore, and having only one entrance gate. The Governor's house is a large prominent square building ; the others are chiefly huts intermingled with a few stone houses, but the houses on the point are of stone, and of a more modern and substantial description. In this quarter is the bazaar, which is well stocked with all the requirements of Arab life. There are two main mosques. The immediate vicinity of Mukalla is particularly barren, but about one mile inland, to westward, is an oasis of gardens, belonging to the Governor, irrigated by a good stream of water. The water-supply of the town is obtained by means of an iron pipe from the source of this same stream. The harbour, having a fixed light elevated 25 feet at the extreme end of the pro montory, is not available for anchorage during the south-west monsoons, and then a considerable portion of the trade is diverted to Bandar Burum, a place about 16 miles to south-westward, where good anchorage is found all the year round. The climate of Mukalla is very trying, and the heat on shore is often very excessive ; but land and sea breezes, with showers of rain occasionally, mitigate it from October to April and again in June and July. A very considerable trade is carried on with India, the Somali Coast, the Red Sea, and Masqat. The exports are chiefly gums, hides, senna, and a small quantity of coffee ; the imports, cotton stuffs, metals, and crockery from Bombay, dates and dried fruits from Masqat, coffee from Aden, and sheep, aloes, and frankincense from African ports. Steam vessels call here and steamers run to Aden ; but the coasting trade is carried on mainly by native sailing craft of from 100 to 300 tons, the greater number arriving during the date season. The population was estimated by Hirsch ' at about the same as that of Shihr,' viz., 6,000, and is a very mixed one.

Its breadth varies, but generally speaking it is narrow and is contained between steep and barren cliffs of granite. The hills to the north are called JabalThabair. In the middle of the valley along both sides of the way is the village or town of Muna, many of its buildings being in ruins. The village of Muna is about 5 miles north-north-east of Mecca and its importance lies in the fact that all pilgrims must pass the night here on their way out to Mount 'Arafat. At tho eastern extremity of the valley stands a house belonging to the Sharif of Mecca. To every division of the Hajjis its place of encampment is appointed in Wadi Muna and at 'Arafat. Wadi Mohsab is one of the side valleys of Wadi Muna, between Mecca and Muna village MUNAHIRAH— See 'Auaizah tribo ; Dahamishah sub-division of the 'Amarat.

MUNTAF- A hamlet in the Ruus-al-Jibal district {q. v.) of tho 'Oman Sultanate. MUNTAFIK— The term Muntafik does not really denote a tribe; but a confederacy of tribes, the most powerful in 'Iraq. Thus, if a Muntafik were asked within his own dlrah to what tribo he bolongod ho would say 'Azairij, Khafajah, etc., as the case might bo ; if he 7z2 —MtJNTAFlK replied that he was a Muntafik, it would probably mean that he belonged to the Sa'adun family. On the other hand, if he were in Mecca or Damascus he would call himself a Muntafik, a term which would identify him in any part of Arabia. Territory. —To the Muntafik belong both banks of the Euphrates together with the adjacent western desert from Durraji, between the towns of Samawahand Nasiriyah, to the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris ; also the banks of the Shatt-al-Gharaf except in its upper course, the right bank of the Tigris from 'Azair to Qurnah Village and the whole western portion of the country, called JazTrah or Mesopotamia, included between those three. Part of the right bank of the 8hatt-al-'Arab below Basrah was formerly occupied by the Muntafik, but they wore at some period displaced by the Muhaisin; some of them, however, are still found at Ma'amir above Fao and at Kut-al-Khal fah in the Dawasir District. The Muntatik are adjoined by the DhafJr on the West, and by the Khaza'il on the north-west; while the Bani Rabi'ah, A1 Bu Daraj and A1 Bu Muhammad intervene between them and the Tigris bank from Kut-al-Amarah to 'Azair. It fellows that the bulk of the tribe are under the government of Basrah and comparatively few under that of Baghdad The chief towns in the Muntafik country are Su-qash-Shuyukh, 8hatrat-al-Muntafik and Nasirlyah, and the tribe also frequent the town of Samawah. Divisi(jns.~~Ko estimate of the number of the Muntafik is possible and their sub divisions are innumerable ; but they are sometimes classified under the throe heads of Ajwad, Bani Sa id or Al Bu Sa'ad and Bani Malik ; of these the first aro predominant in the Euphrates valley above Hammar, the second (sometimes treated as a distinct tribe) are chiefly found upon the Tigris and Shatt-al-'Arab and have their centre about Qurnah, while the third are now generally regarded as a separate tribe and have been so dealt with in this Gazetteer. The Al Bu Sa'ad were actively hostile to us during the great War. Zamil-al-Manna' is now titular head of the Ajwad Division. The term Muntafik is properly applicable to the central core only of the great tribal congeries of Which the territorial limits have been described above ; but in use it has become extended to the whole. Some of the components of the tribe in the wider sense occasionally separate themselves from the general body and this is considered to be the position at present of the Bani Malik, and in a lesser degree of the Ajwad. Various client tribes also, though not included under the name, are closely associated with the Muntafik ; such were formerly the Bani Mansur and Ahl Jazair. Part of the once famous Bani Khalid tribe is believed to have been absorbed in the Muntafik. Mode of life. A large part of the Muntafik tribe is still Bedouin ; but the remainder inhabit tents, reed-huts, villages and even towns, cultivate the land, grow dates, and breed Bheep cattle, buffaloes and camels: many, however, even of those who belong to the settled pastoral sections, rove the desert in spring with their flock and herds for the sake of the grazing. The Muntafik women do not veil their faces. Beligion and political position.-Ai\ the Muntafik tribesmen are Shi'ahs with the exception of the small Sahaiyim section of the Al Humaid and it is remarkable that not ordy are tho ruhng family, the Sa adun, Sunnis, but the Manna' family, who have been Shaikhs of the Aj wad Division for the last 80 years, are also Suanis.

They were formerly Ma'dan in all probability. Their methods of fighting bring them into disrepute even among their not over par ticular neighbours, llefused to allow Saiyids sent for the purpose to bury our dead after the Butniyah fight early in 1916. The authority of Qata' al Buti is not recognised by any of the sub- tribes except the Al Bu Nasir. No Shaikh among them has any real authoritv. Good fighting men. They say they are from Najd and claim des cent from one A zraq -ash-Shami. Pos sibly comparatively recent comers to the Gharaf and adopted methods of frightfulness in order to establish their position. Many members of the tribe migrate to other tribes in search of a livelihood. The Hawalah and Humai- rah joined the tribes against us in Feb ruary 1916 and were selected for punish ment. The Humairah are wholly in nocent of morals. The Khudhair used to be the ruling section but are now almost extinct. They do not recog nize the authority of Qata'. i&gt;hirb connected with the attack on us in Feb ruary 1916. Most of the Al Bu Yusuf have migrated to the Mujarrah and to Kut in search of water. On the occasion of the withdrawal of Gen eral Brooking's force to Nasirlyah from camp at Butaniyah (12 miles to the north) on 7th February 1916, the 'Azairij and Khafajah, who had in the past professed friendly feelings towards us, shewed their hands by a treacherous attack on the retiring British force, in combination with the 'Abudah of Khavyun-al-'Ubaid and with other hostile tribes of the Shatt-al-Hai. Prompt retribution was dealt out to the Azairij in a punitive expedition on the 9th March, and subsequent minor operations have been successfully car ried out both by land and water against these and other ill-conditioned sections inhabiting the neighbourhood.

Near Raighah it is joined by Wadi La'a Avhich comes in on the left bank ; both are perennial streams with several branches rising in the highlands to the east. There is said to be always running water in Wadi Mur up to a point a few miles ea«t of Zohrah and a large area of cultivation on both banks is irrigated by its flood water. The principal places in the valley are Zohrah and Mur, on the north and south sides respectively, and about three miles apart. Roads lead from Zohrah north through Wayidat and the Bani Abs country to Maidi, about 60 miles ; east up the valley to Hajjah, about 40 miles, a difficult hill road ; and south through Zaidiyah to Hodaidah, about 75 miles. Wadi Mur receives a right-bank tributary, called Wadi Juwa, near the hamlet of Humasiyah, 12 or 14 miles from the sea. The estimated number of fighting men at Mur is 800 and in the independent villages north of W T adi Mur, 1,600 ; the total population is four times these figures. {Wauhope, 1915.)

It is over COO nautical miles by sea from Masqat. At Ras Murbat the coast changes its direction from east and west to south-south-east and north-north-west; and off the village, which stands on the shore about a mile within the cape, there is consequently a perfectly sheltered anchorage in the north-east monsoon ; the depth of water is 6 to 7 fathoms at less than half a mile off shore. Near the sea, less than a mile north of the village , is a red granite hill called Jabal-al-Ali, and a plain of dark granitic rocks extends eastward from Murbat to Ras Niis and inland for about 10 miles to the foot of the huge sc ap here formed by the Samhan hills : one of the highest points in the Samhan range is situated about six miles north of Murbat. The village of Murbat consists of about 150 huts and houses ; of the houses, 38 in number, some are of stDne. The only buildings in good repair are the house of the Shaikh and the residence of the ' Aq'd commanding the garrison; the latter is on the beach about J of a mile north-west of the village. The population of the place is mixed and includes 40 houses of Sadat, 20 of Ja'afar, 10 of Qaras of the Ahl 'Umr section (Bat Makhaiyir sub -section), and a few of Mahras, Hikman and Mashiakh. The poorest classes live by fishing and none are well-to-do. Malarial fever is said to prevail through out the year and the people are rather thin and anaemic. Little is to be had in the way of supplies except cattle and goats ; the water-supply is from wells in the bed of Wadi Murbat, which comes down to the sea about one mile north-west of the village, and is of fair quali^. Livestock are a few camels, donkeys and cattle and about 400 sheep and goats ; in winter the cattle present a thin and miserable appearance, due to the scarcity of pasture at the season. Millet and sugarcane are grown ; also cocoanut. Frankincense from the Samhan hills is exported to Bombay, whence rice and cloth are obtained in return. With the exception of 10 to 30 boat crews of Jannabah, who come every year to fish, few Arabs from abroad visit Murbat. Murbat is subject to the Wali of Dhufar and is held by a garrison of some 20 'Askaris in the name of the Sultan of 'Oman ; but few of these levies are men from 'Oman. The virtual ruler of Murbat is tho Shaikh of the place whose authority is supposed to extend from Ras Nus to Taqa ; but he has little real power beyond the limits of his village. The plain of Dhufar Proper can be reached from Murbat by a track which runs along the coast westwards for about 20 miles Murbat was once occupied by Muhammad-bin-'Aq 1, a pirate who made himself master of Dhufar at the beginning of the 19th century : the traces of his fort built in 1806 still remain, and his tomb also is here.

It is a fine old work, luilt round and domed over with roughly squared stones, very like what may be seen in some rustic parts of southern England.— [Biirton.) MUSA (Hammam)— A warm spring in the SinaPeninsula, two or three miles northward from Tur, on the Gulf of Suez. The cistern is in the inner room of a bungalow built in a narrow strip of date plantation and garden, the whole being surrounded by a ruinous mud wall. The water is about 4 feet deep, warm in winter, cool in summer, of a saltish-bitter taste, but celebrated from its invigorating qualities.— {Burton.) MUSA (Bu)— In English formerly called ' r Bomosa.' An island in the Persian^Oulf, lying about SO miles north-west of Sharjah in Trucial 'Oman, or a few miles nearer to that town than to that of lingeh in Persia and situated slightly to the west of a line joining those places. In shape it is nearly rectangular and lies with its corners approximately to the cardinal points ; its extent is about 3 miles diagonally between opposite comers. The island is low and consists of great sweeps of sandy plain covered with tussocks of dry grass but without trees ; it carries however some isolated hills of dark, volcanic appear ance, and a sugar-loaf peak, somewhat to the north of the centre, attains a height of 360 feet. Bu Musa is surrounded by fairly deep water and is a common place ot refuge for native boats in bad weather. There is good drinkingwater in about 20 we Is, also a plantation of about 150 date trees which is said to belong to the Shaikh of Sharjah. The permanent population consists of above 20 households of Sudan from the village o Khan is Sharjah, all of whom are fishermen and live in huts and mud houses. T e y are reported to own 4 camels, 60 donkeys, 40 cattle, 200 sheep and goats, 7 pear ing boats and 5 fishing boats ; and their provisions are obtained from Lingeh. There is a so a shifting population of persons from the Sharjah coast who come to fish, or bring anima s for grazing on the island ; but of late years their numbers have been fewer than former y in consequence of failure of pasturage due to want of rain. Some 10 or 15 donkeys aie kept on the island by the employes of a Persian contractor of Lingeh who has obtaine from Salim-bin-Sultan, the uncle of the Shaikh of Sharjah, a concession to workdeposi 3 of red oxide of iron that exist on the island. Tho concessionaire pays $250 a year to 0MtjSA 1313 Shaikh's uncle by way of royalty ; his Persian work-people (men, women and children) sometimes number 100 souls ; and the amount of oxide removed annually is said to average 40,000 bags. The island of Bu Musa belongs to the Shaikh of Shajrah, who frequently visits it in the hot weather. The Shaikhs of Sharjah have been under the protection of Great Britain for over a century. This ruler is solemnly pledged not to enter into any agreement with, nor to alienate any of his territory to, any other power. He also owns the islands known as the two Tambs, close to which the Persian Gulf cable passes. There are several herds of wild gazelle on the island. MtJSA ( K hor)— A remarkable inlet of the sea which leaves the Persian Gulf at its northern extremity, to the east of the Shatt-al-'Arab, and afiords access to Buziyeh and Ma'shur, the ports respectively of the Fallahiyeh and Jarrahi Districts of Southern 'Arabistan. Course and main features. —The channel of Khor Musa begins in the open sea at a distance from terra, fir ma, and the position of the entrance may be taken as approximately 29° 55' north and 49° 3' east, or about 30 miles east of the bar of the Shatt-al-' Arab. For the first 31 miles within the entrance Khor Musa is nearly straight and runs approxi mately north -north-westwards ; in the course of the next 5 miles the channel gradually bends round to eastwards ; and for the remaining 7 miles, to a point where it divides into branches running to Buziyeh and Ma'shur, its direction is slightly to the north of each. The total length of the main Khor is thus over 40 miles. Near the entrance the banks of the channel are not visible on either side, being covered even at low water ; but on the east side, from 5 miles within the entrance up to 23 miles, there are patches of sand and mud which dry at low water ; and on the opposite side, from 14 miles and upwards, banks of mud with rocky patches are exposed at half tide. At 11 miles within the entrance a low swampy island to the right, called Uairah, is passed at about 6 miles distance ; 3 miles to the north-east of this island is Bunneh, another island, 3^ miles long, narrow and distinguished by a ruin. A channel passing between Dairah and Bunneh is said to be called Khor Wastah. Beyond Dairah, Khor Musa is tem porarily divided into two channels by Qassar-bin-Siswan, a rocky shoal a mile in length; and at 23 miles from the entrance Qabr-an-Nakhuda, another low islet, lies upon the starboard beam at 3 or 4 miles distance. Immediately after passing Qabr-an-Nakhuda, a ridge of dry sand a mile or more in length appears above the mud on the western bank of the Khor ; and at 29 miles from the entrance there is a small sandy islet on the east bank, opposite which Khor Musa throws off to westwards a branch named Khor Qana- qeh. The banks of Khor Musa above Khor Qanaqeh are still low ; on the western or northern side they are of mud with small patches of rock and are covered at high tide ; on the other side they are of mud and are submerged at high water springs. Khor Qatmqeh branch. —Khor Qanaqeh runs inland, westwards and slightly northwards for a distance of about 25 miles to the ruins of Qubban where it forks ; this is the distance as measured in a direct line, but by the windings of the creek it is somewhat over 50 miles. From Qubban one branch, named Khor Abu Khadhair, runs north and is lost in the marshes adjoining the Fallahiyeh-Marid canal; the other, known as Khuwairln, goes south-eastwards and meets, or almost meets, a creek called Silaik or Silaich which is said to leave the coast at a point between the mouth of the Bahmanshlr and the entrance of Khor Musa. The level of Khor Qanaqeh as far as Qubban and of its branches beyond Qubban is affected by the sea tides. It is interesting to observe that the head of Khor Qanaqeh at Qubban is connected by a hollow, now dry, with the Karun river at Marid ; and it is easy to imagine that, as the inhabitants of the tract assert, the Karun or a part of it at one time flowed to Qubban and thence to the sea either by the Khuwairin and the Silaik creek or by Khor Qanaqeh and Khor Musa. The water in the upper part of Khor Qanaqeh is nearly fresh; at flood it is drinkable in the upper third, and at obb in the upper half of the creek. The banks of Khor Qanaqeh at 7 miles from its mouth and upwards are ' 4 to 6 foot high, firm, and covered with coarse grass ; but nearer to the main Khor they are liable to be overflowed 7 at spring tide. The west bank of the Khuwairln near Qubban is of hard mud. In the season of most water, e.g., in May, the whole country to the north of Qubban is a swamp.

Khor Ma'shur branch .-The other branch, and true continuation beyond its head of Khor Musa is Khor Ma'shur which runs north-eastwards, has a length of about 14 miles, aJicT may be considered to end at a point about a mile south of Ma shur village ; but w^th high tides and a south-east wind the sea water is said to reach almost to the town to two sides—the south and the west. On both sides of this Khor are broad mud flats which are mostly covered at high water springs. . , , , ,. . NaMion of Khor .Vum.-the entrance of Khor Musa .3 crossed by a bar which carries only 3 fathoms at low water springs, but is practicable for large vessels at high water, the spring rise being about 10 feet. The bottom however, is of mud and 3d easily be dredged if necessary ; and, though no more favourable sounding than 3 fathoms hL as yet been obtained on the bar, it is possible that a complete survey might reveal a deeper channel than any at present known Inside the bar the depth steadily increases, and shortly after passing Dairah island there is no bottom at 9 fathoms, a condition which is maintained the whole way from this place to the head of the mam Khor The soundinga in Khor Musa do not appear to be liable to much variation, for recent surveys agree closely with others made a number of years ago. In Khor Musa. Dairah island and the mainland upon the oppoiste side are very low and onlv just visible in crear weather ; but as the inlet is ascended the mud banks and flats which uncover at low water afford guidance to the navigator. The Qassar-bin- Siswan shoal lies in the middle of the fairway and probably never uncovers ; as a rule however, it can be seen, but it may be missed, especially if the western edge of the channel is followed Above the entrance to Khor Qanaqeh the Khor Musa channel is difficult to find, except at low tide, on account of the distance to which the sea spreads over the mud flats on either side. ... . Naviqation of the branches. -In the Khor Qanaqeh branch at 7 miles from its entrance the width of the channel is about 400 yards, and the depth within 20 yards of the banks is 4 fathoms, increasing rapidly to 6 or more in the middle. In Khor Qanaqeh a mini mum depth of 6 fathoms can apparently be obtained for 30 miles above the entrance; and a ship's boat can proceed about 20 miles further still to a point about 1| miles east-south east of Qabban where the creek is only 10 yards wide and has a depth of a foot at low water. In the upper part of the Khor the tide flows for 3 hours and ebbs for 9 ; its nse and fall is about 10 feet, and the ebb is very strong- At 7 and 12 miles from the entrance unexplored branches run southwards, and one at least of them must apparently communicate with Khor Musa or with the sea as a native vessel has been known to emerge from Khor Qanaqeh which had not entered it by the ordinary channel. The navigability of Khor Doraq has recently been tested ; in the uppermost fewmiles it is narrow and at low water nearly dry, but the rise of the tide is about 10 fee and sea-going native vessels of as much as 150 tons are able to reach the town ot Buziyeh. . For 2£ miles above the month of Khor D5raq the soundings in Khor ma s u continue to be more than 9 fathoms, butthereafter they shoal, not altogether regularly, to the head of this branch. In ordinary tides small boats reach a point 1J miles irom Ma'shur village, and native sea-going craft ordinarily discharge their cargo at a P c ® called Sif, 2J miles from the town, where at ordinary low tides the depth of 18 feet and the width of the channel 15 feet. The banks here are of shelving mud and tne breadth of the water increases at high tide to 50 feet. Larger vessels discharge opposi ft tract called Zangi further down.MUS-MUS 1315 General navigability. —The whole of Khor Musa Proper is navigable for large vessels, and the Khor Qanaqeh branch is also navigable for a distance of 7 miles at least. The only difficulty is that already remarked on, which arises from the invisibility of the edges of the channel except at low water; and it should be added that Khor Qanaqeh becomes, after a few miles, too narrow for a long ship to be turned in. At the places most suitable for anchorage in Khors Musa and Qanaqeh the tidal stream runs not less than 2 knots an hour at springs. Land approaches. —So far as examination has yet been carried, the navigable portions of Khor Musa and its branches appear to be difficult of access from terra firma, being as a rule separated from the same by wide stretches of soft mud or treacherous saline soil which are sometimes miles in extent. The ground in the neighbourhood of Ma'shur village has been carefully explored; and the result has been to show that the channel, where it is deep enough for European vessels, is unapproachable on that side by animals or even by foot-passengers. The tract called Zangi which adjoins the northern bank of Khor Ma'shur above the mouth of Khor Doraq appears to consist to a large extent of labyrinthine creeks containing liquid mud ; so ne of these are ramifications of an inlet, called Ju-i-Jangi, from Khor Ma'shur. Even the route from Ma'shur village to Sif, the place already mentioned where native sailing vessels discharge their cargoes, is sometimes impassable by caravans. For one mile it lies across a bare plain of saline soil which is swampy in winter and almost untraversable after rain. It then crosses a drainage hollow leading from the desert west of Ma'shur village to Khor Ma'shur ; this hollow is liable to floods after rain, and even in ordinary weather the tide runs up it to within a mile of Ma'shur village. The remaining 1J miles of the way are sandy going and somewhat firmer than the first mile; but this section also is said to become deep and difficult in wet weather. At S f itself is a patch of really firm sand. The only other point at which it is certain that access to Khor Musa exists by land is on the north-eastern bank of its Khor Doraq branch, at the point nearest to Imamzadeh 'Abdul Hasan which is on the direct route between Ma'shur and Buziyeh. The distance of the bank from the Imamzadeh is several, perhaps 10, miles and the ground, especially in the neighbourhood of the Khor, is fairly high and firm ; but for part of the way it is somewhat cut up by the canals of the Shatut tract. The depth of the Khor at this place has not been reported, but it has been ascertained that the water in the Khor does not ordinarily rise to within less than 3 feet of the top of the bank. Both abo . e and below this particular spot, however, the north-eastern bank of Khor Doraq is stated to be low and marshy. ' It is possible that the Qanaqeh branch of Khor Musa may be easily approachable by land from certain directions, but this point has not as yet been specifically investi- Naval advantages and disadvantages of Khor Mvsa. —The principal anchorages of Khor Musa are completely protected from all winds and could be easily defended against attack from the open sea whether by bombardment or by torpedoes. Fresh water could perhaps be brought from the Jarrahi river, which is not far distant; and the climate is probably less trying than in some other parts of the Persian Gulf. The near ness of the place to the mouth of the Shatt-al- 'Arab and to the valley of the Karun is also an important consideration. On the other hand, it is not certain that the navigable portions of Khor Musa could be made approachable, at least without inordinate expense, from the landward side ; the chief natural anchorages might require adaptation in order to form good harbours ; and the bar at the seaward entrance must be dredged to enable the Khor to be entered by ships in all states of the tide, MUSAGH— A sub-division of the A1 Shibil, one of the rural tribes of 'Iraq {q. v:).

MUSAIYIB— A country town of pleasant aspect in 'Iraq ; it is situated upon both banks of the Euphrates river where crossed by the Baghdacl-Karbala road, Musaiyib is well sheltered by palm-groves, which surround it and extend along the banks of the river, and most of the houses are masonry built. The main body of the town lies upon the left bank, but some of the best buildings, including the government offices and several good khans, are in the small quarter on the other side. On the left bank, immediately above the town, a strong embankment carefully revetted extends for about 600 yards, and along the top of it runs the high road to Baghdad. The stream of the Euphrates is spanned at the town, where it is about 200 yards broad,, by a bridge of 24 boats : some of the boats are connected only by insecure gangways without hand-rails. The whole population of Musaiyib may be about 3,500. The great majority of the people are Shi ah Arabs, but there are about 80 Jews who are Turkish subjects, 100 Persians who are Persian subjects, 20 Punjabi Indians who are British subjects, and a few Afghans. There are no resident Christians. The Jews are silversmiths and traders. Musaiyib contains 12 khans, 25 granaries and over 100 shops. There are no local manufactures ; and trade, though the town possesses about 40,000 date-trees and is the centre of a good agricultural district, is inconsiderable ; most of the going and coming is of goods and travellers passing between Baghdad and Karbala. Transport is not readily obtainable in any quantity, and the surplus of forage and provisions is not great. In the busy season 12 boats of the Safmah type are retained to bring up rice from H ndiyah barrage, 5 miles distant, and to take down cotton piece-goods and other Baghdad merchandise to boats which wait below the barrage to receive them ; in the off- eeason 7 of these are released for up-stream traffic on the Euphrates. There are 20 gajahs or small boats at Musaiyib. Under Turkish rule, Musaiyib was the headquartersMUS—MUS C 1317 of a Nahiyah—which also contains Sikandariyah—in the Qadha of Karbala ; but only the smallest local affairs were settled by the Mudir. The town is a municipality, and Paswanivah and Chiraghivah, or taxes on account of night watchmen and the lighting of the streets, are collected. Besides the Civil Mudir there was here a harbour master, a Mudir of the Public Debt and a Mamur of the Sanitary Department. From Musaiyib a double line of telegraph runs to Baghdad on the one side and to Hillah on the other. Before the war the Dairat-as-Saniyah took firm hold of the country around Musaiyib on the left bank and planted down a number of masonry enclosures m the neighbour hood ; these were used as storehouses, but in appearance they resemble military forta. The same department maintained a school on one of its estates near Musaiyib. MUSAIYIB— One of the canals of the Euphrates {q. v.). MUSALLA— A hamlet in Bahrain Island {q. v.).

It consists of a large walled enclosure containing two caravansarais which lead one into the other. Outside are two small khans and a few coffee-shops and about 200 yards to the eastward are some 30 Arab huts. The sarais would hold about 800 horses and 600 men, but there are practically no supplies. Water is obtained from wells and from a canal which comes from the Shatt-al-Hindiyah {q. v.).

A small clan of Qatar and Bahrain who clai n descent from the Bani Khalid and are probably a branch of the Al Humaid section of that tribe. The Al Musallam wore once numerous and influential in Qatar, where about 1850 a number of them were settled by the Shaikh of Bahrain at Dohah as a counterpoise to the Sudan ; they were brought apparently from Fuwailat and Huwailah. The present fort of Dohah, formerly known as Qal'at Al Musallam, was built by them; they founded the quarter of Duwaihah; and they maintained close rel .tions with the Ma'adh'd. They have now been reduced by natural causes to about 25 houses in Bahrain (at Muharraq Town Hadd and Halat Abu Mahur) and 8 houses in Qatar (at Dohah, Fuwairat and Wakrah). In religion the Al Musallam are Maliki Sunnis : by occupation they are all pearl merchanta except a few who serve the Shaikh of Bahrain as soldiers. MUSALLAM (F AIUQ-AL)— A quarter of the town of Hadd {q. v.) in Muharraq Island, Bahrain Archipelago. MUSALLAMIYAH— Musallamiyah bay is a considerable indentation in the coast of the Hasa Sanjaq ; it is situated about 77 miles north-west of Has Tanurah and divides the tract of Zor-al- Audhan on the north from that of Huzum on the south : at the foot it meets, or nearly meets, the inland district of Sabakhat-al-Mutaya. The northern point of the bay is Ras-al-Bidya', a low sandy promontory with tufts of grass ; the southern, wjiich is of some height and runs into the sea between Musallamiyah bay and the island of Jinnah, is named Ras-al-Abkharah. The width of the entrance between these points is 4 miles, and the depth of the bay inland from the entrance is 6. The inner area is for the most part shallow ; but a deep channel, known as Khor MusallamTyah, leads past Ras-al- Bidya' up to MusallamTyah island. This island, which like Jinnah has Jazirat-al-'Amair for an alternative name, is situated in the bay about 5 miles west of Ras-al-Bidya'. On the east side of it is a village of 400 houses, protected by two adjacent forts, which possesses several wells and a few bar trees, but no cultivation. The inhabitants are Bani Khalid of the ' Amair section andMUSANNAH— An undulation in the district of Dibdibah (,. v.). in the Kuwait Principality.

MUS—MUS belong chiefly, if not altogether, to the Al Khalid and Al Raz'n sub-sections; they subsist by fishing and pearl-diving and own, with the people of Jinnah island, about a dozen pearl boats. Under Turkish rule a detachment of 3 Turkish Dhabitlyahs was quartered on tho island, which was under the Qaim-Maqam of the Qatif Oasis : they were accommodated in a mud house, and their sole duty was to fly and look after the Turkish flag. The Shaikh of the Al Khalid was styled Mudir of the island, and he received from the Turks an allow ance which he shared, by private arrangement, with the Shaikh of Al Razin; the less important headmen also, as mentioned in the article on the Bani Khalid tribe, were stipendiaries of the Porte. The Zakat or revenue payable by the whole community on Musallamiyah island is 60 Riyals per annum. MUSALLAMIYAH—(Island and Khor)— See Musallamiyah.

An island adjoining the north -eastern tip of the Kuus-al-Jibal promontory, from which it is separated only by a narrow strait • it may be considered to mark the entrance of the Persian Gulf and to divide that sea from the Guif of Oman Musandam measures 2 miles in length from north to south and very little less m breadth across its southern end: its extreme height is 875 feet and it is ore cipitous almost all round, the only landing places being 3 or 4 small coves on the east side! Some ruins exist at the north end, built of large blocks of stone without mortar • but a few herdsmen in charge of goats are generally the only denizens of the island. At its north end Musandam terminates in a cliff 100 feet high, the celebrated cape Ras Musandam Not far from Musandam island, on the north and east sides, soundings are obtamed of 100 fathoms, a depth considerably exceeding anything found within the Persian Gulf. The strait which separates the island from the main is called Fakk-al-Asad or Bab ; it is 600 yards wide 24 fathoms deep, clear of obstacles and can easily be passed by steamers if a good speed is maintained, but in consequence of strong tides and baE winds it is avoided by Arab vessels except rowing-boats ; the cliffs on either side am perpendicuiar resembling door-posts.

It belongs to a series of hills among which this mountain, the Mushahhar, or conspicuous, is the only one that attracts notice; this intervening range divides the territory of Qatif from the province of AI-Hasa.' This Mushahhar range is probably identical with Jabal-adh-Dhahran, in Barr-adh- Dhahran {q. v.), and the pyramidical peak of Palgrave is probably Jabal Mudrah. MUSHAIDIYAH— A station on the Baghdad-Samarrah section of the Baghdad railway; it is situated some 22 miles from Baghdad and 4 miles from the right of bank the Tigris, The water supply is plentiful from wells. Not far from the station is Khan Mushaidiyah, formerly a well-known halting place on the route between Baghdad and Mosul, via the right bank of the Tigris. The khan is of brick, 100 yards by 90 outside measurements ; stabling all round, walls 18 feet high, parapet on top 5 feet high ; the top is crenelated. There is a balakhana with three rooms ; the whole is solidly built; drain holes on roof, at 12-foot intervals, could be used as loopholes. There is a semi-circular bastion at each corner and a small square one in the centre of the curtain. On the east side, facing the main gateway at a distance of 60 yards, is an old Zaptieh post of sun-dried tricks; it has two storeys, with two rooms on top and stabling for 6 horses beneath, and a small court yard, 15 yards by 12. Ten yards to the south of this post is a well, the water, which is brackish but perennial, being about 6 fathoms below the surface. On the north side of the khan are some native mud huts at 40 yards distance. Inside the khan, above the stables, is a terrace, 39 Teet wide, with the domes of the stables sticking up through it, ! The river is about 4 miles away to the east. The country round Mushaidiyah is almost a desert. MUSHAIQIQ (Umm)— A halting place on the western route between Karbala and Hail. It is situated a few miles to the north-west of Sha' b Hisib, at a distance of between 130 and 140 miles from Karbala and consists of a camping ground and some cisterns in which, however, it is not safe to trust to finding water after the middle of May. The Mushaiqlq cisterns are in a small tract of the sa-rie name which adjoins that of Al-Majamir and lies to the north of it.— {Leachman, 1910.)

For the first 14 or 15 miles of its course, the Musharrah cannal trends eastward, after which it bends to the south-east and be comes lost in the Khor Hawizeh. In the high-water season it is navigable for boats drawing 4' to about the Khor 'Ob .iid tower. This canal gives its name to a large and important muqatd'ah of the 'Amarah district.

Limit*. —The range of the Mutair is more extensive than that of any tribe except the 'Anizah. They are the principal nomad visitors to Qas^m and the almost exclusive possessors of Dahanah and Summan. On the north-east they extend far into Kuwait territory, where they have a favourite summer camping-ground at Jahrah; on the south-west they are found on the outskirts of Qasim about Miskah and Dharlyah, in Washam and Wadi-as-Sirr, and at a great distance off in the volcanic country between Mecca and Al-Madinah ; a few of them visit 'Aridh. Hejaz is said to have been the cradle of their race. On the Persian Gulf side their northernmost limit is at a place called Bishuq, the positon of which is not accurately known ; southwards they reach to the end of Summan, and to Hasa in which they sometimes wander. The Mutair are in contact on the north with the 'Anizah, on the north-west with the Shammar, on the west with the Harb, 'Ataibah, Qahtan, Dawasir and Sabai', on the south-west with the Ajman, and on the south with the Al-Morrah, Bani Haiir and Manasir. At the wells of Dukhnah their Bedouins have been supplanted in recent times by the 'Ataibah. The Mutair, closely akin to their western neighbours the Harb and the 'Ataibah, are people of the north claiming descent through Mudhar from Ma'ad. A turbulent tribe, some 2,700 tents strong (including the Brain), the Mutair stand in close relations with the Shaikh of Kuwait. With Ibn Rash id they are perpetually at feud and no year passes without raiding expeditions from one dirah to the other. It was a Mutairi who in 1908 killed the Amir 'Abdul 'Aziz, father of the present Amir Ibin Rashid, of Hail, at Raudhat Mahanna, near Buraidah. The Mutair harry the outlying settlements of Qasim and not infrequently interrupt the caravan traffic to the Persian Gulf. Their peramount Shaikh, Faisal- ad-Darwish, pastures in the Kuwait area and is head of some 800 tents. All the Mutair belong to the confederation of Ibn Sa'ud and contribute fighting men to his raiding expedition. They are camel-breeders and entirely nomadic. They possess no cultivated ground. Some authorities treat the Braih to be an independent tribe, but others consider them to be so closely allied with the Mutair as to be of the same stock. In all political relations they are held to be at one with the Mutair and like them come under the au thority of Ibn Sa'ud. Their pasturages are in Qasim. They are reported to have opposed 'Abdullah, the second son of the Sharif of Mecca, when he raided Sadair in 1914 in order to collect overdue taxes from the eastern 'Ataibah, and that after some fighting they were defeated. i Settled Mutair are found chiefly in Qasim, where some of the inhabitants of Bukairi- yah, Butainiyat, Ghaf I, Hatan, Khabb, Khabb-al-Qabar, Khudhairah, Muraid Saiyid, Rafi'ah, Raudhat-al-Mahanna, Ta'amiyah, Qasr Zaid and Ummahat-az-Ziya- bah are supposed to be of Mutair blood ; and non-nomadic Mutair occur also at Dhrumah in 'Aridh ; at 'Ashairah in Sadair and at Jaraifah in Washam in Southern Najd, and in the villages of Wadi-al-Miyah in the Hasa Sanjaq. •Thp Mufcair have been described at some length, as, on account of their present close relations with Kuwait it Wn nfwslble to procure detailed and authentic information concerning them. Very full particulars of the jti hi an Rtih-di vision and of some of the sections of the Umwahah sub-division, with pedigrees of chiefs, etc., are Jiv?by CapUin Knox, Folitical Agent at Kuwait, in an Appetdl* to his Diary No. 19 for the week ending 8th May 1907. * ~ ■ r!S2/w^ftSB 80MMBMMMMBWWBIIIWIIIIII I MTJTAIR Dit isions and numerical strength. —The original divisions of the Mutair are two only, the 'Ilwah and the Braih ; but to these have been added in recent times, probably by fission of the Braih, a third main division, the Bani 'Abdillah. During the late struggle for supremacy in Central Arabia the Bani 'Abdillah sided with Ibn Rashid while the majority of the tribe were partisans of Ibn Sa'ud, and the estrangement continued until the final defeat of Ibn Rashid when the Bani 'Abdillah rejoined the general body of the Mutair. The llwah consist of two large sub-divisions, the Jiblan and the Umwahah composed of the sections given below :—- Jiblan sub-division. Umwahah sub-division. 'Araif. 'Araqibah. 'Arfan. Bursan. Bara'asah. Tnah. Jibrah. Kharabtah. Khawatirah. Laini(Bani). Mala'ibah. Masai bah. Rukhman. Mijalidah. Sa'anin. Mura'asah. and Qa'aimat. Sahal)ah. Qahtan. Qisha'an. Shawa irah. Shiyabin. The Sahabah section of the Umwahah consists of several sub-scctions, among which are the 'Arafan, Damanan, Fuqamah, Hijji, Jama'ain, Jarid, Jawafiyah and Umtairat; of these the Fuqamah supply the Shaikhs of the section, as a sub-section called Dhil Ghanaiman do in the Mala'ibah section. Some authorities have included among the Umwahah the whole Rashaidah tribe and a clan called Hirshan, both of whom join the Mutair in their raids and forays and pay tribute to the chief Mutairi Shaikh ; thev are however altogether repudiated by the Mutair, who consider them to be of servile or otherwise inferior origin and decline to intermarry with them. The Braih are composed of three main sub-divisions, the Aulad 'Ali, the Birzan and the Aulad Wasil; of these the Birzan and the Aulad Wasil are in some manner more closely connected than the Birzan and the Aulad 'Ali. The Birzan, with a fighting strength of 300, appear to be a nearly homogeneous body ; the sections of the other two sab-divisions are as follows : —• Anldd Wasil sub-dh i&amp;ion, 'Abaiyat. 'Afisah. Aka'lah. Aqut. 'Awaridh. Bidanah. Diyahin. Farawlyah. Hawamil. Haftah. Jida'an (Ibn). Qaraifah. Mahalithah. , Maraikhat. Mashahibah. and Wisamah. The Hawamil section of the Aulad Wasil comprises four sub-sections, namely, Hamran Hizwah, Shadhlyah and Sharman. The Mutair settled at Dhrumah are of a section called Nafisah which is said to belong to the Braih. Aulad 'Ali sub-division. 'Abadin. Hamadin. .f alailah. Sa'adun (Dhi). Sa'aran. Shi 'all n. Shitailat. and Tha'alah of whom the Tha'alah are closely associated with the Hamadin.MUTAIR 1323 The Bani 'Abdillah appear to be the most western portion of the tribe, and their com, position has not been clearly ascertained ; they include however the following groups- some of which are probably quoted here merely by the names of their chiefs :— Askiyan (Ibn). Jabrll (Ibn). Darwish {Bin). Jarnas (Bin). Dhimnah (Ibn). Maimun. Harish (Ibn). Sharar (Bin). It seems certain that, of these, the Maimun are an important sub-division. Sections of the Mutair known as Dhawi'un, Shahaba and Shakir are said to be known in Hasa, but it is uncertain to which division of the tribe they belong. From estimates given it may be inferred that the total strength of the Mutai amounts to not less than 4,000 fighting men,* that is, males who are neither infants nor decrepit with age ; and the total number of souls may thus be 10,000 or more. Character and customs. —The Mutair are typical Bedouins, which is to say that they are poor, hardy, restless, impatient of control, much engaged in tribal warfare and ready to fight,—in the desultory nomand fashion,—where there is either hope of plunder or an injury to be revenged. In religion they are not fanatical, but, as compared with other Bedouins, they are perhaps somewhat deficient in hospitality. The principal customs of the Mutair mostly refer to marriage, to compensation and retaliation, and to crime and punishment. A sum, called Muhar, is paid to the father or guardian of a bride ; among Shaikhs and headmen it is $200, but among ordinary tribesmen it averages $40 to 50; Muhar is generally given at the time of the marriage, but occasionally the paj^ment of half the amount is postponed. The customary bride-price among the Mutair is said to be the same as it has always been. If the Mutair happen to be near a town the 'Aqd or cere mony of marriage is performed by a Qadhi, but in the desert his presence is dispensed with. The Fuqamah sub-section (see above) will marry the daughters of other sub-sections of the Sahabah, but they will not give their own daughters in marriage except to men of Shaikhly class such as the Dhil Ghanaiman. The Dhil Ghanaiman on the other hand will give their daughters to certain selected classes only in their own section (the Malai- bah), but they do not refuse them to any sub-section of the Sahabah. Compensation for a man slain is called IdTyah and among the Mutair it consists of §800 in cash, a slave, a riding camel and a rifle. The blood-price of a woman iss half that of a man, and if a slave or animal be killed the actual value must be made good. Injury causing the loss of both eyes must be compounded for at the same rate as homicide, while the loss of one eye or of the nose, the fracture of a bone and the severance or per manent disablement of a limb are each treated as entitling the sufferer to half the Idly ah. In cases of flesh-wounds, loss of fingers and deafness suitable compensation is assessed by the Shaikhs. Teeth knocked out must be paid for at the rate of one she-camel per tooth. A peculiar provision of the tribal code is one which auhorises a man whose beard has been pulled in anger or by way of insult to cut off the hand or nose of the offendeir without recourse to the tribal authorities and without incurring any liabilitv to pay compensation. A murderer can go in safety for the settlement of his case only in com pany of a member of the opposite party who consents to act as his escort. Disputed points are settled to a great extent by oath. The formula in swearing to a homicide is ' I bear witness, being adjured, that thou art the slayer the established phrase o£ denial is ' By God neither do I know nor have I become aware.' A solemn form of oath is one by which a man declares his wife to be divorced in the sight of Heaven in case what he is asserting be not true. • Thieves are punished with the loss of the nose and one hand, but the delinquent may- ransom his hand by payment of half Idiyah ; only the paramount Shaikh of the Mutair and the chief Shaikhs of the Jiblan and Braih have power to order this penalty. In case of seduction of an unmarried girl she is put to death, and the paramour also is killed if caught in the act. In case of adultery the husband kills the adulterer if he can, and the woman is handed over to her blood-relations to be put to death or otherwise punished ; the disgrace is considered to fall on her own family rather than on her husband's. Adul tery cannot be compounded. The adulterer is not regularly outlawed, but his goods ♦Tribal estimates of fighting strength are in Arabia as a rule too greatly exaggerated to be of any value, la tne present ease the estimate may perhaps be accepted, subject to some deduction, the tribe being well known at ituwait ana their fighting strength having been a question directly in issue during the past several years. 8g2 jBMBBBHWMBBMwaiiiitiniiiMii MUTAIR are kept under attachment as long as he lives. In a case of rape the woman is not killed, and if the assailant make good his escape it is not incumbent on the injured husband to make any effort to discover him. The subject of the war-cry, called 'Izwah or Nakhwah is replete with complications. The war-cry of the 'Ilwah as a body is ' Ilwah hil-al-Ridah,' meaning apparently ' O noble ones, will ye not return to the fight ? ' ; it is said to have originated from the words used by a leader to rally the 'Ilwah in a fight in which they at first gave way, and the name 'Ilwah is supposed to be derived from it. If, however, the jiblan should be engaged alone they cry ' Khayyal-as-Subhah Jabali' and the shout of the Umwahah in similar circumstances is ' Aulad-al-Uwaihi' both phrases referring to ancestral origin. The AuladWasil battle-cry is their name, and it is perhaps used by others of the Braih, for it is stated that if the Mutair generally were engaged the words 'Ilwah and Wasil would be those chiefly heard. The separate cry of the Bani 'Abdillah is ' Aulad 'Iba'd Mode of life and 'property. —Like other Bedouins the Mutair follow a wandering life, being assembled together in large bodies at good watering stations for 3 months in summer and dispersed during the rest of the year over their whole territory in search of pasture. They are said to prefer the northern part of their Dirah. Nowhere do they cultivate, and camels, mostly of a dark colour, are their chief wealth, but they also possess sheep and goats in large numbers and in about equal proportions. Both sheep and goats are of one kind only, the sheep belonging to the species called Nijad because proper to Najd. The best male riding-camels, called Dhaluls, do not sell for more than $100 each among the Mutair, and a female (or Naqah) Dhalul being weaker only fetches $60. The price of the best male baggage camels, called Ba'irs, is $60, and their Naqahs average about S10 less ; but a Halfah or she-camel in milk may become more valuable than a male. The goats (Ma'az) and sheep (Dhan) are sold at $4 to §6 a head, and the price of females is higher than of males. The Wasams or property marks of the Mutair are endless and, as a rule, are branded only on camels. The Wasam of the Dushan is a H placed low down on the off-quarter, and that of the Basaiyis a crescent impressed in two places, viz., below the right eye and low down on the off-quarter. The brand is applied to a camel when it is 2 years old and the operation is accompanied with the remark ' This is your mark and may good luck be your portion.' Tribal constitution. —The paramount Shaikh of the Mutair is at present Sultan-bin- Hamaidi-ad-Dawish. a man 60 years of age, whose authority over all lesser Shaikhs is admitted by such of the Mutair as are not at the moment in rebellion against him. The Bani 'Abdillah, as already mentioned, refused for a considerable time to submit to his paramount authority, and the Sahabah section are reported to have maintained a quarrel with him for the last 15 years in connection with the division of some booty ob tained in a raid on the ' Ataibah. His authority, therefore, is far from being absolute, and it is said to be weaker now than it was formerly. The surname, ad-Dawish, shows that this Shaikh belongs to the Dushan, a family of the Umwahah and not, as some authorities have supposed, a large division of the tribe. There are 5 other Shaikhs who are recognised as ' Shaikhs of the Dushan,' but the recognition appears in the case of each to be honorific and not founded upon the headship of any considerable group. Sultan appears to be chief Shaikh not only of the whole Mutair tribe but also of the 'Ilwah division ; there are however sub-divisional Shaikhs of the Jiblan and Umwahah ; and there is a divisional Shaikhship of the Braih, vested in a family called Bin Basaiyis'of the Sa'aran section and held at the present time by Naif-bin-Hazal, aged 45. The nomenclature of the Mutair in regard to tribal groups seems to differ from that of most of their Bedouin congeners in Central Arabia, by whom small groups are ordinarily styled Findahs (plural Finad). The Mutair divide the whole tribe or 'Ashirah into Qabilahs (plural Qabail) and the Qabilahs into Badidahs (plural Badaid) or Hamulahs. Thus, strictly speaking, Qabilah means a main division and Badidah a sub-divsion or smaller group ; but the current use of both terms is loose and inconsistent and Qabilah is frequently employed to describe a sub-division. Political position. —The Mutair have ordinarily been tribvtaries of Ibn Sa'ud, and their annual contribution to the Riyadh treasury was valued 40 years ago at $16,000 ; nevertheless'by religion they are Maliki Sunnis, and in this respect they differ from most of the Bedouins of Central Arabia, who are tinctured with Wahhabiism aud describe ■■mut-mut 1325 themselves as Hanabilah. About 1878 the relations of the Mutair with Ibn Rashid were friendly deputations of the tribe used to visit Hail with gifts ; bnt they were not then subject to him and never became so. In Qaslm their disposition at the same period was hostile towards the Qahtan tribe and the town of Buraidah, and amicable towards the town of 'Anaizah. In the long struggle between the Wahhabi and Shammar Amirs a large majority of the tribe, as already noted above, adopted the side of the southern stato and shared in its final victory. The alliance which subsisted between Ibn Sa'ud and the Shaikh of Kuwait during the war brought by the Mutair into closer relations than before with that north-eastern seaport. By arrangement with Ibn Sa'ud the Shaikh of Kuwait now collects on his own behalf from all of the tribe in his territories, and pos sibly from some of those beyond it, a tribute or Zakat at the rate of $1 annually on every 100 sheep and the same on every 5 camels. The Kuwait tax-gatherer or Muzakki, at present a native of Buraidah, visits the watering-places of the tribe with 30 or 40 followers, numbers the animals and collects the amount due from all owners except headmen ; he then pays a share of the proceeds to the principal Shaikhs of the tribe and conveys the remainder to his master at Kuwait. There is also a matrimonial alliance between the Mutair and Kuwait. The Shaikh of Kuwait has espoused a daughter of Fahad-al-Askah, one of the Dawlsh Shaikhs, and has appointed his fort at Jahrah as her residence. The Mutair, as befits allies of Kuwait, are well armed with breech-loaders, and it is estimated that every fifth fighting man now possesses a Martini rifle or Sama'ah, as that pattern is called. The best rifles cost $100. Among the Mutair are smiths who are accustomed to repair modern weapons. Matchlocks are now entirely out of date, MUTAIR— See 'Anaizah tribe; Dahamishah sub-division of the 'Amarat. This clan must not be confused with the great Mutair tribe of Central Arabia.

MUWAIH HAKRAN— A group of wells in Najd, on the route between Riyadh and Mecca, and situated about 340 or 350 miles west-south-west from the former town. There are many wells at Muwaih Hakran and they contain drinkable water at about 2 fathoms ; they are situated in a saline bay in the eastern face of Harrat Qishab. The altitude is probably about 3,750 feet above sea-level. Two days' supply of water must be taken from this place by caravans going west. This part of the route is said to be infested with thieves. Doughty calls this place Ameah Hakran, or Shi'ab-al-Ma ; the former would seem a corruption of Miyah Hakran, or Hakra:i waters. MUW AIJIY AH— Or Mwaiji; a sub-division of the 'Awazim {q. r.) Bedouins of Kuwait. MUWAIL AH— A village and fortress on the coast of the Red Sea, about midway between Tor, in Sinai, and Al-Wajj, containing a small grain-depot for pilgrims and a Bedouin market. The village consists of some seventy or eighty families most of them dwelling in palm- leaf huts ; there are a few stone houses, and some gardens and date-groves. The water- supply is from shallow wells, and is abundant but not always good. Sheep are obtain able, and charcoal is extensively burnt from acacia-trees in the neighbourhood. A small Turkish garrison protects the place. The coast is low, but gradually rises inland to hills of great height. There is no harbour but merely a roadstead behind coral reefs where a vessel might anchor in light winds ; but the approaches are dangerous. Good shelter may be obtained at Sharm Yuhar, an inlet about 4 miles S. of Muwailah. There is a caravan-route from Muwailah to Tabuk and thence to Al-Madinah. i MUWAILGHAH (A l)— A hamlet in Bahrain Island {q. v.). It is also the name of a spring near the hamlet.

NA'AIR (S ir B u )— An island in the Persian Gulf, 50 miles north by west of Abu Dhabi Town and 65 miles west of Dibai, on the north edge of the pearl banks. It is 2| miles long from north to south by 2 miles broad, is covered with hills of volcanic rock which attain a maximum height of 240 feet, and has a low sandy point at its south-eastern corner. The only supplies it affords are brushwood and some brackish water in wells upon the east side. Sulphur is said to be found, and there is salt in the hills which until some two years ago used to be removed by Persians, chiefly from Lingeh and Kung, on payment of dues to the Shaikh of Sharjah. In winter fishermen from Sharjah, Khan and Dibai resort to the island, and in the pearl season the fleets visit it to open their oysters ; at other seasons it is uninhabited. There are several pearl banks in the vicinity, in particular Hair Bin 'Adhbi, 6 miles to the north ; Rijlah, 8 miles to the south-west; and Lijjah, 6 miles to the north-west. Sir Bu Na'air belongs to the principality of Sharjah.— (Peman Gulf Gazetleer.) The Persian Gulf Pilot gives the following additional details regarding this island, the exact position of which is in L at . 25° 14' N., Long. 54° 13' E. The island is bordered by a reef extending from 2 to 3 cables. The south-eastern poin being low, must be given a good berth at night. The soundings are not a good guide in approacihing the island, there being from 10 to 15 fathoms close to the surrounding reef, and also the same depth several miles distant; about 35 miles north-v/estward of the island, and near the edge of the pearl bank, are great overfalls. The island belongs to the principality of Sharjah, but is uninhabited. There are a few wild cats and a fair number of sea birds, as well as some curlew. It is barren, nothing except brushwood growing on it. There is brackish water in wells near the eastern side, and there is a deep well of good drinking water, with tracks leading to it from the south east point, but it is too hard for washing purposes; iron ore and some sulphur are said to exist. During the pearl fishery the island is visited by fleets of boats, to open the oysters, etc., and in winter there are generally a few Sharjah or Dibai fishing boats here; their crews, with their families, erect temporary huts and remain some months fishing, chiefly for saw-fisn and sharks. The anchorage. —T his is on the eastern side of the island in 13 fathoms, about half a mile ofi-shore with the peak bearing 275° true, and the south-east point 202° true ; sheltered from the shimdl, but open to the nashi.—{Persian Gulf Pilot.)

NABAQ (A n)— Some wells in Wadi Sirhan {q. v.), north-western Arabia. NABAR— A village in the Liwa sub-wilayat {q. v.), 'Oman Sultanate. NABATAEANS— A people of ancient Arabia, whose settlements in the time of Josephus gave the name of Nabatene to the borderland between Syria and the Syrian desert, and Arabia proper, from the Euphrates to the Red Sea. The history of the Nabataeans cannot be carried back beyond 312 B. C., at which date they were attacked without success by Antigen' 3 I in their mountain fortress at Petra. They are described as being at this period a strong tribe of some 10,000 men, pre-eminent among the nomadic Arabs, eschewing agriculture, fixed abodes, and the use of wine, but adding to pastoral pursuits a profitable trade with the seaports in myrrh and spices from Arabia Felix as well as a trade with Egypt in bitum* n 8h2WKKKtBrnammmmmm—m—mmmmmrn NAB—NAB from the Dead Sea. Their arid country was the best safeguard of their cherished liberty; for the bottle-shaped cisterns for rain water which they excavated in the rocky soil were carefully concealed from invaders. Petra, orSila',was the ancient capital of Edom; the Nabataeans must have occupied the old Edomite country and succeeded to its commerce, after the Edomites took advantage of the Babylonian captivity to press forward into Southern Judaea. This migration also made them masters of the shores of the Gulf of 'Aqabah. The Nabataeans had already some tincture of foreign culture when they first appear in history. That culture was naturally Aramaic ; they wrote a letter to Antigonus in Syriac letters and Aramaic continued to be the language of their coins and inscriptions when the tribe grew into a kingdom and profited by the decay of the Seleucids to ex tend its borders northward over the more fertile country east of the Jordan. They occupied Hauran and became lords of Damascus. The Nabataeans might have long been a bulwark between the European invaders and the desert hordes but for the cupidity of Trajan who, in 105 A. D., reduced Petra and broke up their community. The Arab invaders who pressed forward into their places found the remnants of the Nabataeans transformed into FaUdhln and speaking Aramaic like their neighbours. Hence Nabataeans become the Arabic name for Arama eans, whether in Syria or 'Iraq, a fact which has been incorrectly held to prove that the Nabataeans were originally Aramaean immigrants from Babylonia. It is now known, however, that they were true Arabs (as the proper names on their inscriptions show) who had come under Aramaic influence.— {Enc. Brit.)

NAFI (A n)— A hamlet in Qasim {q. v.), central Arabia. NAFJAN— A large village in Widyan Dawasir {q v.), south-western Najd. NAFUD— The word Nafud is used in the northern and eastern parts of Central Arabia, both as a generic term and as a proper name. In the wider and primary meaning the word denotes any expanse of sandy desert soil,—such for example as the wastes of sand which pervade southern Qasim and approach the town of 'Anaizah and Buraidah.1334 NAFtD In the restricted sense in which it is employed in the present article, the name Nafud refers to the huge wilderness of sand which forms a counterpart in northern Central Arabia to the Ruba'-al-Khali of the south. Extent. —'The boundaries of the Nafud or Great Northern Desert have not yet been ascertained with any completeness, and its extent is consequently uncertain. On the west it commences between Taima and Jauf-al-'Umr, probably not far to the west of a line joining those two places. The northern boundary of the Nafud runs thence in a curve almost to the edge of the Jauf-al-'Umr depression and from there to a point 50 miles north of Shamah, while the southern boundary, after passing a little to the north-east of Taima, continues by the northern extremity of Jaba'al Irn5ri Jabal Misma', and Jabal 'Aja to a place about 10 miles south of Shamah. It follows that the breadth of the Nafud, which to the south of Jauf-al-'Umr, is 200 miles, has near ShSmah diminished to about 60 ; but the precise limits of this portion are difficult to fix as it is broken up and interspersed with stony ground. The districts which border the Nafud on its northern side are, from west to east, Jauf-al-'Umr, and its connected villages, the Hamad or Syrian desert, especially the tract known as Wadyan, and the region of Hajarah. On the south are the districts of Jabal Shammar and Qasim. Physical characferisti:s. —The surface of the Nafud is generally devoid of prominent features. Its level above the sea varies, however, within considerable limits; and on the line between Jauf-al-'Umr and Hail differences of several hundred feet in elevation apparently occur; the central portion of the tract upon this section stands somewhat higher than either of the margins. It is generally agreed that the north-western part of the Nafud towards Jauf-al-'Umr is that which has the most broken and irre- gular surface; and here the ridges and valleys of which it consists, if they have any general direction at all, run from west to east. Nearer to Hail the Nafud consists of open concave plains, interrupted here and there by banks of sandstone; there are also sandhills of less height but greater circuit than those in the north. Further to the east the Nafud falls away into low sand ridges branching out from the higher western grounds: enclosed between these ridges are long but shallow valleys which descend eastwards. The average altitude of the Nafud between Jauf and Hail seems to be rather more than 3,000 feet; in a line between Hail and Najaf it is, apparently, some 700 feet less. The Nafud throughout is composed of a bright red sand, somewhat coarse but abso lutely pure ; this sand is almost crimson when damp and does not seem to vary in colour or consistency from one place to another. In occasional deep depressions a firm bottom of clay or a calcareous, flinty or quartzy stratum is exposed at the lowest point. The Arabs state that the 'sand of the Nafud is in most parts too deep and too loose to admit of the sinking of wells. The most remarkable phenomenon of the Nafud is a species of large depression called a Ga'rah, or Falj. In shape it is semi-oval and resembles the print of a gigantic horse- hoof ; the toe is the deepest part and points to the north-west, in the western Nafud but in the eastern Nafud the direction is south, while the floor of the hollow rises south- eastwards and reaches the ground level at the heel; the internal walls are inclined at an angle of 50 or 60 degress to the horizon. The Falj ts of all sizes, varying in area from I to 200 acres, but the average diameter is 300 to 400 yards and the ordinary depth from 150 to 250 feet. The formation of these hollows is generally ascribed to the agency of the prevalent winds, but this theory cannot yet be regarded as fully established. Peculiar facts relating to these depressions are that, in spite of the instability of their sandy sides, they apparently remain constant in shape and size from year to year and even from generation to generation ; that none of them retain water after rain ; and that they lie in irregular courses or strings from west to east. To the north of Jubbah for the greater part of the way to Jauf-al-'Umr, there is a constant succession of Faljs on both sides, of the road. In Nafud nomenclature sandhills, parti cularly if (as is not uncommon) they are of crescent shape with the concave side to the south, are styled Tu'us* (singular Ta'as); and passages or spaces between them are called Khalul (singular Khali). •Such is the definition obtained at Kuwait of a Ta'as: it differs somewhat from Hubcr's (Journal de Voyage page &amp;1).OiMfiI lHWiffrMfnWi naf O d Climate, vegetation and animals. —The prevailing breezes in the Naffld are from the west: the Bedouins state that high winds are of rare occurrence. In winter a white frost is visible on the ground in the early morning, and a considerable depth of snow has been known to fall in a single night. After rain, which is not frequent but is some times heavy, pools are formed but the water sinks almost immediately into the sand. There is abundant desert vegetation, and but for the absence of watering places the Nafud would be permanently inhabited. The grazing is excellent, and when the winter rains have made a sojourn possible the surrounding Bedouins repair to the Nafud with all their flocks and herds. North of 'Alam-an-Nafud the principal plant is the Ghadha. which yields good firewood and charcoal; south of that point it is the Artah, which when leafless resembles a thickly matted vine. The commonest plant however is 'Adar with stiff green leaves and brownish-yellow flowers: there are also Nusi, a good kind of camel grass, and Hamrah, a blue prickly plant which is excellent forage for horses.* Animals include the wolf, the Beatrix antelope (called Baqr-al-Wahshi or Wadhihi) the hare, lizard and snake ; among the snakes are believed to be the cobra and the horned viper. Birds are the buzzard, kestrel, grey shrike, linnet, wren, dSsert lark and wheat- ear with an occasional crow ; and a few ostriches are still, it is said, found in the eastern and nothern parts of the Nafud. There are also flies, dragon-flies and small butterflies, f Inhabitants.—Several fixed villages mentioned below lie within the border of the Nafud; but these few isolated spots excepted, the whole tract is without permanent inhabitants! In winter and spring the north of the Nafud is frequented by Shararat and by 'Anizah of the Ruwala branch, the south by 'Anizah of the Bishr branch and by Southern Shammar, and the east by Northern Shammar, Dhafir and Muntafik; in summer all the Arab Bedouins withdraw, the three last mentioned to 'Iraq, and Saluba and Hawazim remain in exclusive possession. Communications. —Political interest in the Nafud attaches mainly to the routes by which it is crossed, the most important being that between Hail and Jauf-al-'Umr known as Khali Bani Hilal or Khali Abu Zaid. They are described in the article on Najd. Topography. —Below are described, in tabular form and alphabetical order, the princi- pal inhabited places, recognised subdivisions and other points of interest in the Nafud: Name. Position. Remarks. 'Akairishah .. On© hour north of Jibbah on the rout from Kuwait to Makkah. A watering-place with 50 wells of sweet water at a depth of I fathom. 'Alam-an-Nafud .. or 'Alaim-an-Nafud. About 80 miles south east of Jauf-al- 'Umr. O Two pyramidal hills of sandstone weather ed black, the principal landmark on the route across the Nafud from Jauf-al- 'Umr to Hail. They stand about 600 yards apart; the northern hill rises about 250 feet above the plain and the southern about 120 feet, the base of the former being 3,650 feet above sea level. They are also known by the names 'Alam-as-Sa'ad and 'Alam-al-'Atsh. *^ or further details see Ruber's Journal de Voyage, pages 571-2 and 581-3.

Asha'ali Begins a few miles south-east of the Sha'aibah wells and extends south-east wards for 20 or 30 miles. A long narrow tract forming part of the Nafud between Shamah and Qaslm. Ba'ithah Three hours north of 'Akairishah. • A watering-place with 30 wells of sweet water at 8 fathoms ; it is situated in the tract of the Nafud known as Madhhur. Bajiiyah The part of the Xafud nearest to Jauf-al- 'Umr. A high and extensive plain of fine sand with protruding rocks; it is the first obstacle to be surmounted on the way from Jauf-al-'Umr to Hail. Bittah (Al) South of Shamat-az- Zarud. Seven strips of sand coming from the Dahanah ; they rise 150 feet above the plain and are about 1 mile broad. Between them are gravelly depressions each about a mile broad. The north side of each wave is very precipi tous, rising in successive steps to the highest point from which it trends to the south in one long slope. Prevail ing wind from the south. Faluq* .. or Faluh. Commences 30 or 35 miles north-west of 'Alam-an-Nafud and extends north-west wards of 15 to 20 miles. The most difficult known part of the Na fud ; it consists of valleys and scarped hills which make it difficult for the traveller to preserve his direction and render progress tiring. There are numerous deep Faljs and a quantity of bushes. The route between Jauf-al- 'Umr and Hail traverses this tract. Haiyaniyahf Between Hail and Hazil, about 125 miles north-north east of the former. A group of 5 wells containing sweet water at 25 fathoms. Shammar Be douins and Saluba encamp here at times and a small permanent post is maintained by the Amir of Jabal Shammar for the protection of the wells. Hinatain 30 or 40 miles south east of Jubbah. A couple of high sand dunes. •See Huber's Journal d'un voyage en Arabie. tVon Nolde apparently reached Hail from Jauf-al-'Umr vid Haiyaniyah. In that case Haiyaniyah must apparently be placed further west (which is difficult, see Wallin and Huber) or the existence of two somewhat Similar Haiyamyahs must be supposed. Position of Haiyaniyah 70—100 miles North by West of Hail. Shakespear (19th April 1914) says. 'Haiyaniyah consists of one biir well and a gatr in the K ha brat Hajyanlyah on the very _ edge of the Xafud. The qasr is of mud with towers at opposite ends of a diagonal and contains a half-dozen oflbn liashid'^ men who are changed once a year. C. C. IC.NAF^D 1337 Name. Jubbah Position. About 80 miles west- north-west of Hail and 160 miles south- south-east of Jauf- al-'Umr. Eleva tion above the sea is 3,060 feet. Lazzam Madhhur Mujiyan (spelling uncertain). C52(w)GSB East of Asha'ali Extends from Jabal Shamlan to a point a little east of 'Ain ibn-Fahaid in Qasim. At the northern boun dary of Faluq. Remarks. A village situated in the midst of the Nafud, towards the north end of a plain several miles in extent of which the soil is hard and stony. One mile to the west-north-west of the village is the hill of Umm Sinman. Jubbah once consist ed of 4 quarters and was a thriving place of nearly 1,000 inhabitants of the Armal section of the Shammar; during the last few years, however, it has rapidly declined and is now estimated to contain only 25 houses inhabited by about 100 Arabs of various tribes. The place was once walled, but is now open and undefended. The grazing in the neighbourhood is among the best in the Nafud and attracts nomad 'Anizah, Shammar and Hataim in the season to the number of 300 or 400 families. A few dates and some cereals are grown and here the Ithl tree is first seen in entering Central Arabia from the north. The wells are about 40 feet deep and yield water which though insipid is better than that of Jauf-al-'Umr. Fifty years ago a toll, under the guise of payment for water-rights in the Nafud, was collected at Jubbah on behalf of the Amir of Jabal Shammar: it was at the rate of $2 from travellers about to cross the Nafud and $1 from those who had passed it. A portion of the Nafud about the same size and shape as Asha'ali with which it is conterminous and parallel. A tract in the Nafud, 100 miles in length but narrow. Trubah is on the west border of Madhhur near its northern end. Madhhur contains the wells cf Zi- bairah, Tha'alabiyah, Radifah, Ba'ithah, Talaih, 'Akairishah and Jibbah, the last the Kuwait-Mecca route through Qasim. Southern Shammar Arabs encamp at these. A high barrier of -very fine sand with brush wood which is leafless except in winter. The ridge is light-coloured and gives its name to the Nafud for some distance north of it on the way to Wadi Shaqiq. 8iNAFtD On the west of Madh- hur extending south wards to Dhldah on the outskirts of Qaslm. 50 miles east-south east of Jubbah and 30 north-west of Hail. Elevation above the sea is 3,280 feet. About 35 miles north- north-west of Hail. About 25 miles south east of Jauf-al-' 'Atnir. 40 miles east-north east of Baqa'a. A tract of theNafud 60 miles in length but narrow. It consists of three parallel strips running north-west and south east ; they are Umm-adh-Dhumaid on the east, Ma'-athir in the centre, and Batrah on the west. A village in the Nafud close to its south ern border ; it stands on a white chalky plain surrounded by low sandstone hills. The place consists of about 20 houses of Shammar with half-a-dozen wells and about the same number of date-gardens. The soil is sandy and the water sweet. A little fruit and some corn, especially barley, are cultivated ; the grain fields are unfenced. A locality situated in an enormous Falj of red sand towards its northern end. There is good water at 10 fathoms from the surface in about a dozen wells. Shammar Arabs camp and graze their camels and horses here all the year round, but there are now neither date- palms nor any permanent village. A valley running north-east and south-west with a breadth of about 1 mile and a depth below the surrounding Nafud of 120 to 150 feet. It is rugged, with rock coming to the surface in places and else where flints or sand, and appears to drain a large area of Nafud and to supply the wells of Shaqiq and Azhari. The wells of Shaqiq are two at the*usual watering-place ; they are sunk through 20 feet of hard soil, this upper por tion being masonry-lined, and then through 100 feet or more of rock. The diameter at the mouth is 3 feet, but it increases further down. The water never entirely fails and is generally sweet but sometimes becomes fetid. 'Anizah, Shammar and Shararat nomads collect here, especially at the end of summer. The wells of Azhari lie about 6 miles further east. A halting place on the Ha'l-Nafaj route.,.

A remarkable hill rising about 1,200 feet above the level of the surrounding pUin ; it is almost perpendicular on the west and very steep on the east side. The summit is very narrow ; from it the higher point of 'Alam-an-Nafud is visible. Many of the rocks at the base of Umm Sinman bear Himyaritic in scriptions. The name suggests a re semblance to the hump of a camel. A portion of the Nafud of small extent. An enclosure with 2 wells and a dozen in habitants. There are 2 wells of moderately good water; they are 30 feet deep. The surround ings are extraordinarily arid, consist ing of stony desert with patches of sand ; the sub-soil is a conglomerate of quartz, flints and calcareous stones. Trubah is a stage on the Hail-Najaf road and is protected by a fortlet with walls 20 feet high and corner-towers. It was built by the Amir Mata'ab and is held by a garrison of several men. Southern Shammar camp in the desert around. A village in the Nafud with a population of of 100 souls at the most ; a few corn fields and ithl trees, but no palms. Three long, low, parallel sand-ridges reach ing for 30 miles but only a few miles broad. They are separated from Lazzam to the south-west of them by a narrow belt. A narrow, stony plain. The following description of the Nafud brings out some additional information ;— A.-—T he Northern Nafud. The Northern Nafud is a wilderness of deep sand, which separates the Syrian desert from Jebel Shammar. It extends about 140 miles from north to south and about 180 8i2HBMHBH ■NMMMnMManniMaBn&gt; 1340 NAFtD miles from east to west. Formerly it was considered to be of much greater dimen* sions ; but the limits of the sand area are now accurately known, and the above i^ a fair allowance for the maximum distribution of the Nafud. It forma a rough triangle, extending from a day's march east of Teima to the edge of the Jauf depression ; southwards it reaches to the foot of the Jebel Aja, and in the north-east to the wells of Haiyaniyeh. The unbroken sand-bed is known as Nafud (Nefd), or occasionally by the Bedouin as rami 'all —the high sands. The term Nafud was applied by Doughty to all sand-tracks in the peninsula. The Arabs say, ' the Nafud reaches from Jauf to San'a.' As a general statement this is correct; but, to be more exact, there are two main sand-beds—the Nafud in the north and the Roba 3 el-Khali in the south, these being more or less connected by the tongues and belts of sand which chiefly cross the eastern confines of Nejd, but also lie in isolated patches across the very heart of the peninsula. These are called Little Nafuds or Dahanah, according to their character, the latter term being especially applied to the belts which are composed of parallel ridgea of sand, divided by intervening plains of hard steppe. On the north and west the margin of the sand-area of the Nafud is very abrupt, the dunes rising like a wail above the surrounding steppes. On the bouth the margin is less clearly defined. On the east, however, the sands break away from their uniform boundary and throw out long tongue-like strips into the hard desert. The two most remarkable of these are the Dahanah and the Ardh-el-Madhua, one of which continues right across the centre of the peninsula, eventually joining up with the southern desert, while the other extends for a hundred miles. In the true Nafud there are practically no wells, but its margins are fairly well sup plied with water. The only break in the whole extent of sand is the depression of Jubbah, on the Jauf-Ha'il track. This locality is a hollow, about 300 feet below the level of the surrounding sands, protected from encroachment by a ridge of low sandstone hills. In earlier days there was a settlement here—Wallin reckoned it at 170 families, besides palm-groves and abundant water-supply. Later on it was reduced to about a hundred inhabitants, and according to the latest report it is now abandoned altogether. The neighbourhood is, however, still a great centre for nomads, for the grazing is some of the best in the Nafud. The only other settled locality in the sand- bed is the small village of Qana, which lies just inside the Nafud on the track between Ha'il and Jubbah. It used to contain about 20 houses, with a small patch of cultiv ated ground. There are a few watering-places just within the margin of the Nafud: for instance, El-Shaqiq, 12—14 hours to the south-east of Jauf, can be said to be inside the sand-belt; Nolde records the wells of Hoah east-south-east of Jauf in the Nafud, and Wallin watered at El- Atwa in the sands between Ha' il and Haiyaniyeh. On the southern margin there is water in the great ' Felj ' of Umm el-Qulban to the north-north-west of Ha il, and at Haizun, Gulban and El-Abeisah, between Hail and Teima. These are the only known wells actually in the sands ; but it is possible that there are others known only to the Bedouin, in the deep horseshoe pits, which occasionally sink down to the underlying floor, and may therefore contain wells. Travelling is slow and laborious owing to the detours and circuits which these pits necessitate, and to the soft texture of the sand. These remarkable hollows, ■which may be as much as from 2 to 300 feet deep, are the only features of the landscape besides the occasional outcrop of rock which emerge above the sand-bed, and serve as excellent landmarks. There is only one recognized crossing of the sand-barrier which shuts off Jebel Sham- mar from Syria. Caravans from Damascus bound for Ha'il traverse the Nafud between Ja,uf and Jebel Aja in from ten to twelve days. The distance between the oases is 266 miles, of which 220 lie over sand-desert. The long waterless stage is between Shaqiq and Jubbah, a distance of 150 miles, which usually takes between seventy and ninety hours to accompalish, although it has been done in fifty hours. The only other line wmch has been followed across the Nafud is that taken by Nolde, who travelled from Jauf along the northern edge of the sands (but inside the Nafud) to Haiyaniyeh, and ence sou wards to Hail. Nolde claimed that this was the shorter route, and that the waterless stage was shorter than that on the Jauf-Jubbah track. As a matter of fact from our present knowledge of the true position of Haiyaniyeh the distances betweenNAFtD 1341 wells are practically the same, while the total length of the journey is if anything longer. The latter half of this route, between Haiyaniyeh and Ha'il, is a recognised track across the eastjern end of the Nafud and connects Jebel Shammar with 'Iraq } the sand crossing takes two days and the going is comparatively easy. The only other track in the Nafud of which we have any record, is one which leads westwards from Jubhah to Fejr and Tebuk. There would be a waterless stage of 100 miles. Deserted in summer when the heat becomes intolerable, the Nafud is, in winter and spring, an asylum for all the tribes upon its borders. The sand area, curiously enough, supports a considerable vegetation. The dunes are more or less covered with large bushes of ghada (a species.of tamarisk) and artah (yerta), with scrub such as hamar and 'adar, and with tall succulent grasses, nvssi and sob at h. There are also many peculiar parasites that grow on the roots of the ghada ; these are typical desert growth —full of moisture and greatly sought after by the drinkless fauna. The Nafud grasses afford excellent feed for camels, and are so nourishing in the spring months that these become quite independent of water for many weeks at a time. Thus the Bedouin, living on their camels' milk, are enabled to wander far into the depths of the water less dunes. The sands even lend themselves to artificial afforestation. Doughty mentions how he found the 'great dune of Boreyda' newly planted with ethel (tamarisk) trees. The natives set the young plants in the loose sand and water them for one year. By that time they have struck out long roots and are able to thrive of themselves. 'Planted with tamarisks' —he notes— 'the sands of Arabia might become a green wood.' The first rains fall about mid-November, and very soon afterwards the sap begins to run in the twigs of the thorny bushes, and grass and flowering weeds spring up in the sand. The nomads have a great liking for the Nafud, finding, as they do, an abundance of fuel and pasturage. The warm hollows afford them, besides, a shelter which is much appreciated after the exposure of the surrounding deserts. There is also comparative immunitv from the attacks of raiders ; although the Bedouin also complain that the Nafud is dangerous on account of the ease with which an enemy can be tracked in the sand. The Bishr confederacy, the Wulud 'Ali, Awajeh, Fuqara, Sherarat, etc., occupy the western and south-western quarters ; the Shammar tribes the south and east; the great Anazeh tribes ('Amarat and Ruweileh) come into the Nafud from the north. The distribution is, however, only typical of normal conditions ; Shammar and Ruweileh have been known to meet in conflict on the western confines. The only other nomads likely to be met with in the Nafud are the Suleib. Wild game is abundant in.the sand-area. Gazelles, ostriches, hares, and innumerable small rodents are to be found, while the Nafud and its confines form the true home of the Arabian oryx {oryx healrix), an antelope allied to the oryx of African fauna. There are several poisonous snakes. The axes of the dunes lie north and south and the great horseshoe hollows face the south-east. The prevailing winds being from the west and north-west the dunes have their steep faces towards the east and south-east. This statement applies to the main sand-bed, but on its eastern margin the axes of the dunes gradually swing round until on the Ha'il—Haiyaniyeh track they lie east and west. The prevailing wind between Ha'il and Boreidh appears to be from the south. The ' felj ' pits are by far the most remarkable features of the Nafud. They are known in different localities by the names of felj, felq, gar of, and gar. Feli, or felq, is usually applied to those on the Jauf-Hail-track. Gar at is used by the Shammar of those in the north-east. Gar is a more general term both for those in the Nafud and those in the Dahanah. There has been considerable discussion as to their origin, and as to peculiar facts relating to them. The prevalent west winds are no doubt the principal agency to which the formation can be ascribed, but whether it is by the direct move ment of sand from the west or by a process of scouring out by back eddies is still undecid ed. They appear, in many cases, to go right down to the underlying floor of the sand- bed, and some are certainly stationary, for they are habitually used by travellers as camping-grounds and even contain wells. From this it would appear that the pits aio formed by a different process to that which piles up the moving dunes. In shape they H1342 NAF^D are most regular, being best described as resembling the imprint of a gigantic horse- hoof. In size they vary greatly, some covering a hundred acres, others not more than an acre ; the average depth may be between 150 and 250 ft. They all lie with the deep, east pa rt of the horseshoe towards the north-we?t, the sides running out to the south east. Apparently they never vary in this respect, whether they lie in the Nafud dunes which run north and south, or are in the Dahanah belt among dunes trending east and west. The internal walls are very steep and unstable in the middle of the bend, but less so at the sides. The sides are as well covered with vegetation as are the ordinary dunes. The sands lie deepest, and the grains are heaviest, in the western, southern, and cent ral portions ; on the north and west the beds become shallower and lighter both in tex ture and in colour. The characteristic hollows and high bare dunes of the centre and west fade away, on the east the sands assuming a more even surface; finally the sand-bed breaks up into intermittent dunes and hard desert. The depth of sand in the west is reckoned at from 200—300 ft., and in the east at less than 100 ft. The nomenclature of the dunes is somewhat confusing. There is a host of names, which includes terms for every variety of sand formation. Jvrda is applied, in Qasim, to the hard stationary dunes where desert bushes grow 5 iaus to the high single dunes, generally bare of vegetation, and also to the little white dunes which accompany a/eZ/ ; a dan at and kelhib to the light shifting sand ; kabl is an ordinary sand-hill, and barkah an isolated patch of Nafud. In colour the sands vary from white to dark red, being heaviest and darkest in the centre and lighter and whiter on the edges. The Nafud is situated at an average altitude of 2,500 ft. above sea-level. On the north and east the underlying floor of the Nafud is about 2,000 ft. above sea-level • on the south and west it is 3,000 ft. ' As regards climate, the sand-bed is by no means a rainless area ; travellers have ex perienced heavy rain-storms and snow, standing pools of rain-water have been seen while the vegetation on the dunes proves that the sands hold much moisture. The weather is subject to great variation in a short space of time. Shakcspear experienced ram thunder-storms, cold winds, and great heat in April on the northern margin of the sands Frost is quite usual during the winter nights. The temperature is liable to considerable change during the 24 hours ; great heat at noon may be followed by frost soon after sunset.

Sixty-five miles to the south-east of the point where it crosses the Wadi er-Rummah, the sands are 18 miles wide, and are formed into four distinct ridges, separated from each other by bare hard steep. The sand-ridges vary in width from half a mile to 4 miles, the intervening plains being from half a mile to 5 miles across. A more direct track than the Wadi er- Rummah route here crosses the Dahanah from Koweit to Boreidah by way of Bir es- Safra and Zilfi. Twenty miles further on the Dahanah is 23 miles across, and is composed of seven belts. The main direction is here east south-east. Fifty miles further it extends to its maximum width—38 miTes, but the number of sand-ridges is seven as before, while the width of each dune and of the intervening plains continues to vary. Some are several miles in breadth, and stand from 200 to 300 ft. above the plains, which in their turn vary from 5 to 12 miles in breadth. For the next 120 miles the Dahanah runs in a south-easterly direction, and is unknown ; but just beyond this it is crossed by the Riyadh—Hofuf caravans, and its form is known to have altered. The sands are now in a solid 18-mile wide belt, but the dunes are insignificant as compared with the Nafud. The Dahanah type—of parallel ridges—has not entirely disappeared, for there seem to be the remnants of other sand-belts on the eastern margin. Slightly to the north of the Riyadh—Hofuf track therg is apparently a wider stretch of sand, for Pelly reck oned the crossing of it at two days' march. Beyond this point the Dahanah has a direction of south-south-east, and then nearly due south; except for Leachman's crossing of it—40 miles on—it is unknown. By report it continues in the same direction, until it finally merges into the great southern sand- bed—the Roba' el-Khali. At Leachman's crossing it was 30 miles wide, but it had lost so much of its true character that he was able to describe it as being ' scarcely more than a sandy plain '—the waves being small and the sand of little depth. The general disposition of this sand-area is in a long semi-circular barrier shutting off the central tableland of Nejd from the lowlands of 'Iraq and the Gulf Coast. It lies at an average altitude of 1,200 ft. above the sea, and is bordered on the west by higher ground and on the east by the level plain called Summan. The prevailing winds appear to vary at different localities between south and west, the trend of the dunes varying accord ingly. In the north they run east and west, with their steep faces towards the north ; in the middle section of the Dahanah the dunes run north-west, and south east, the steep sides being turned towards the north-east. At the Riyadh—Hofuf crossing the dunes lie about north and south, being formed by westerly winds. The vegetation is remarkably abundant, as in the Nafud, and attracts many nomads to its vicinity, especially in the winter months. The Muteir are almost the exclusive posses sors of the Dahanah, but in the southern portions the Murreh and their foes the 'Ajman come at certain seasons into the sands for pasture. In the North the Dhaflr range the deserts to the north of Lineh, and doubtless use occasionally the Dahanah pastures. The Dahanah is the principal sand-area between the Northern Nafud and the Roba' al-Khali. There are, however, several subsidiary sand-belts worthy of notice. All of these differ from each other in character. Some are isolated dunes or hummocks of sand, others are miniature Nafuds in themselves, and one is an off shoot of the Northern Nafud. All are consistent in one point, however, namely, that they are all long-drawn-out belts of fine sand, having the same general direction as the Dahanah. The belt which has its origin in the Northern Nafud is the 'Ardhel-Madhua ' (Leach- man), 'Nefud Matsom' (Huber), or 'Araj Mathur' (Shakespear). This tongue of sand breaks off from the main sand-bed between the wells of Metseiaha and Trobah, in lat. 28° 30' north. It is here 6 miles wide, being of the same width, 50 miles to the east where crossed by Leachman. In character it is more like the true Nafud than the Dahanah. Leachman described it as 'formed of great waves of sand running east and west, with a difference in level of 151 ft. between trough and crest, while at certain places horseshoe depressions (falj) are encountered in the trough. The sand is a darker red than the Nafud, very heavy, and most difficult to traverse, while the sides of the waves are so precipitous that it is necessary to dismount from one's camel to get over them.' The Ardh el-Madhua is supposed to extend to the Wadi er-Rummah, and to cease there.ipty ; • &gt; V . l V.,-&gt; • &gt;&lt;» f .... y*. r' ?. -v ? .-Tflgjiismir ill; 1314 NAFOD It is possible that it connects with the belt called El-Bitteh, which must come very closa indeed to it on the south. El-Bitteh is the northern extension of a long, isolated sand-belt which extends for 235 miles, starting from the borders of Woshm and 'Aridh, and reaching to within 30 miles of the Northern Nafud. It is divided from the Dahanah by the Tuweik uplands having a general direction of south-south-east by North-north-west. That portion of the belt north of the Wadi er-Rummah is called El-Bitteh. In character it is typical Dahanah, being composed of parallel ridges of sand divided by valleys of hard soil At its northern end there are seven strips of sand each about a mile broad, hi between them being gravelly valleys of the same width. The dunes face north, and their sides are very steep. Further to the south, on the Boreideh track, is a single down-like wave of sand, 300 ft. high, called Nuwathir, supposed to be connected with El-Bitteh. The Bitteh retains its Dahanah like character from about 85 miles. The track from Basra, or Koweit, to Boreideh, by way of the Wadi er-Rummah, crosses it as such, but a little further on the parallel ridges come together into one broad belt. The remainder of El-Bitteh is of the Nafud type. Between Zilfi and Boreideh it is a solid sand-ridge, 13 miles broad, characterized by three depressions containing un inhabited palmgroves. The dunes are said by Raunkiaer to trend from south-west to north-east. Near Shaqra the belt is eight miles wide, the sands being easy to traverse. Here it is called Araj el-Bildan or Nefud el- Woshmt Within this last belt, 20 miles to the west, is yet another of the same type. We know if for about 100 miles running nearly due north and south from Boreideh to lat. 25 p . Beyond this point it is entirely unknown. East of Boreideh, where it surges to the very edge of the Wadi er-Rummah, is a five-mile ridge of big dunes ; west of Shaqra it is fifteen miles across, and more difficult to traverse than the Nafud el-Woshm. The only other sand-area on the eastern confines of Nejd is a small belt in the space between the Temamma and Tuweiq ranges, which Pelly recorded on his track between Ormah (Rumhiyeh) and Sedus. This is a four-mile wide ridge, running parallel to the Temamma range ; apparently the sands are deep, for Pelly speaks of a ' giganti© pyramidal dune.' The vegetation of Nafud has its areas and its distribution is not accidental. The part where most fuel is found is Bihbuh next the Habl-as-Saif. No other part of the Nafud approaches these two. The part where there is least fuel is Al-Batrah ; only nasi and sabat is found there. Although Bihbuh is richest in fuel, all the desert plants are not found there, but only Artah, 'Adar, 'Alqahl, Q.urdhi, Mati, and in winter, 'Ashub. In another great part of the Nafud, Zor, are the following;—All the above and in addition, Ghadhah, Ears, Dhumran, and 'Arad. The regions favoured by Ghadhah are. The route Jauf—Jubbah. East of A1 Khunfah—South of J. Tawil. The part where there is most 'Ashub in spring (after the winter rain) is Zor. The least, m Al-Laban where the Nafud is white—the sterile white Nafud is called Al-Barakhis (plr. of Barkhus). 1 ho red is called Nafud Samra, a term used to express the fertile Nafud. r The white is quartz. The red is grit, smaller and lighter than the quartz. When the wind is strong it carries the red grit off the crests of the ta'as, leaving the white quartz grain behind, which gives them a white aspect and renders them sterile.

NA'lM— Or Na'aim : the name is sometimes pronounced with the accent on the fir^t syllable and the singular in Na'aimi. The Na'im are an important Arab tribe found chiefly in 'Oman, but partly also in Bahrain and Qatar ; these two main territorial divisions of the Na'im are now in all respects independent oi one another and must be dealt with separately. Settled Na'hn of Settled Na'im are found in Trucial 'Oman, in the 'Oman Sultanate, and also in the neutral autonomous district of Jau which is situated between the two former. The table below explains the distribution of the tribe in this quarter :—■ Country. Principality or district. Town or village. Number of houses. Trucial 'Oman 'Ajman .. 'Ajman .. 25 Do. Sharjah ..

Do Su'arah .. 100 8k2NA'Lvi From the figures given it may be inferred that the total number of non-nomadic Na'im in 'Oman is about 10,500 souls, of whom roughly 3,500 belong to Trucial 'Oman, 4,500 to the 'Oman Sultanate, and 2,500 to Independent 'Oman. Bedouin Na'im of'Oman. —The Bedouin Na'im in 'Oman range over the entire central portion of the 'Oman Promontory towards its base. The district of Jau, in which the Baraimi Oasis is situated, may be regarded as their headquarters ; but they are predominant also in the Dhahirah District of the 'Oman Sultanate to the eastwards, and on the west they extend to the district of Khatam which they occupy in common with the Bani \as and Dhawahir. In winter some of the Na'im pasture their animals on the water shed between the Baraimi Oasis and Sohar, and the Na'im are an important factor in tribal politics at the head of Wadi Hatta ; but on the north their principal location is in the plain of Jiri which is shared by their Khawatir section with the Ghafalah tribe. In the direction of Sharjah, the track known as Gharif was once in their possession; hut they were displaced by the Bani Ka'ab, who in their turn had to make way for the Bani Qitab. The number of Na'im Bedouins in 'Oman may be roughly estimated at 2,500 souls, of whom 1,200 may be ordinarily in Truoial 'Oman, 900 in the 'Oman Sul tanate and 400 in Independent 'Oman. Suh-divisions of the Na'im of O'mdn. —The Na'im of 'Oman, whether (settled or nomadic, all belong to one of two main tribal divisions—the Al Bu Kharaiban and the Al Bu Shamis and each of these again is resolvable into a number of tribal sections. The Al Ba Kharaiban are said to be descended from a common ancestor named Khazraj and the Al Bu Shamis from one 'Aus. The following table contains some of the better known sectional names:— Section. 'Aryan . 'Aziz ('AySl) i)arSwishah t)hanain (Al BQ) .. Main division. Location. Remarks. Al Bu Kharaiban .. Hafit village in Jau About 140 souls. In summer they culti vate dates; in winter they roam the desert in tents with their flocks and herds. Al Bu Shamis Dhank Town in Dhahirah. About 700 souls ; all are townsmen. They are believed not to be really Na'im, but their true origin is forgotten. Do. Hairah, Hamrlyah and Sharjah Town in Sharjah, also Ras-al-K h a i m a h Town. At these places the settled members of this section aggregate more than 1,500 souls. The Shaikhs of Hamrlyah and Hairah belong to this section. Al Bu KharaibSn .. 'Ajman and else where. About 700 souls. The name is also given as Al Bu Adh- nain.1250 NAlM The A1 BQ Kalbi of 'Ajman Town are perhaps another section of the Al Bu Kharaiban division of this tribe. Polilical position of the Na'im in 'Oman.—The Baraimi Oasis, where they are still politically, though no longer numerically, predominant, is regarded by the Na'im of Oman as their tribal headquarters ; but at 'Ajman and Hamriyah. both of which places are ruled over by Na'aimi Shaikhs, their position appears' to be more secure * , a _ n in Baraimi at the present day. They are also the most powerful Ghafin tribe in the Dhahirah District of the 'Oman Sultanate ; but their relations with the ruler of the Sultanate are slight. Except at 'Ajman and Hamriyah the Na'im appear to be weakened by internal dissensions, but their Bedouins are described as warlike and predatory. In 'Oman the Na'im are generally Sunnis of the Hanbali school: one or two exceptions to this rule are noted in the table in the preceding paragraph Settled Na'im of Bahrain.—We now turn to the second territorial division of the tribe^ a uranch severed from the parent trunk some generations ago—who are found in Bahrain and Qatar. In the region in question non-Bedouin members of the tribe are now found only m the Bahrain islands where they have 60 houses at Umm-ash-Shajar, 50 at Halaf- arwNa im 30 at Shajairah, 10 at Halat-as-Sulutah and a few at Rifa-al-Gharbi • thev th^ number about 800 souls altogether. There are now no settled Na'im in Qatar Bedouin Na'im of Bahrain and Qafar.—The nomadic Na'im outside 'Oman are believed to number about 2,000 souls. In winter they live in Qatar, chiefly in the neighbourhood Zubarah ; in the hot weather most of them remove to Bahrain and form camps in the northern part o the main island, but some take up their summer quarters near Dohah in the Qatar peninsula. These Bedouins are reputed to possess altogether about ICO horses, 600 camels, 1,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. Sub-divisions of the Na'im of Bahrain and Qatar.—The main tribal divisions of the Aa im are the same here as in the south, namely, the 11 Bu Kharaiban and the Al Bu onamis; but the prominent sections appear to be entirely different. They are— Al Bit Kharaihan. Jifacalah Miza'idah. Khaluwi ari( j Matawa'ah Qahatin ^ Al Bu Shdmis. Fahad (Al) Jima'an (Al) Haiyi (Al) Ramadhan (Al) Hutum and Jabar (Al) Suwawarah. ., , f e Sectlons 'and even the two main divisions, are here much intermingled ; but all e tribesmen in Bahrain and Qatar are followers of one of two Shaikhs who belong to the Al Haiyi and Al Ramadhan sections respectively. TheMuraikhat of Bahrain aresome- imes regarded as a section of the Al Bu Shamis division of the Na'im, with whom they are at least intimately connected ; but it appears preferable to treat them as a separate k ? .u Spealc 0f the Shaikh of Ajman as a Jaffali, and it is there- e possible that the Jifafalah section among the Na'im of the north corresponds to the Qaratisah section among those of the south. Pohtica 1 position oithe Na'im in Bahrain and Qatar.—The Na'im of Bahrain and Qatar nn rTT- detached fro ni the main body of the tribe in 'Oman and maintain no relations with the latter.

It lies on the south-western edge of a great reef, which appears to join that extending northwards from the Yasat Islands. There are a few graves on the island, probably of fishermen, and several detach sd rocks lie off its northern end.

Position and boundaries. —The Qadha of Najaf is situated on the Shatt-al-Hindlyah in its lower reaches, chiefly on the western side ; it is bounded by the Qadhas of Karbala and Hindlyah on the north, by that of Shamiyah on the east, and by the Sham'yah desert on the south and west. Topography and inhabitants. —The only town which the Qadha contains is that of Najaf, elsewhere described ; the only fixed village of any size is Rahabah, the seat of a Mudir, which is situated nearly 20 miles south of Najaf Town on the western verge of cultiva tion and at the beginning of the Shamlyah desert. Rahabah is a small place inhabited by sedentary Arabs whose houses are miserable cabins of mud. The chief physical features of the district are the Bahr-an-Najaf, which is noticed in the articles on the Shatt-al-Hindiyah and Najaf Town, and part of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah which flows into it. Tables follow below of the agricultural tracts and of the tribes of the Najaf Qadha, by Nahiyahs. Ndhiyah of Hor-ad-Dukhn. The names of the tracts in this Nahiyah, which is situated between Kifl and ths Shamiyah Qadha, have not been ascertained. The principal tribe are Ban! Hasan of the following sections :— 'Abbas. Hadari (Al Bu). 'Adhaib (Al Bu). Hawatim. 'Aradhi (Al Bu). Majatin. There are also some of the Mawash tribe who are intimately connected with the Bani Hasan.

The settled Arab tribes of the Rahabah sub-division are the 'Akarat. 'At:i Dhuwaihir and Al Bu Sultan of the Al Bu 'Abdullah section. ' ' In the Qadha generally there are a number of nomadic Arabs, chiefly of the 'Anizah (including Dahamishah), Ghazalat, Bani Hasan of the 'Ayash and Bani Salamah sections Zubaid of the 'Ajaib subsection (Jab Lir-al-Wawi section). Northern Shammar and a ! Shibil. Population. The total fixed population of the Qadha, inclusive of the town of Naiaf is probably not loss than 50,000 souls. In the Hor-ad-Dukhn Nahiyah there are said to be 2,000 huts of tribesmen. The people are nearly all Sh:'ah Muhammadans. iJcsources.—-Agriculture is the principal pursuit; the crops and live stock are of the usual sorts ; but, as parts of the district are marshy, rice cultivation and buffaloes are also found. A number of saline hollows have been converted into rice lands. The date palm in the Qadha are estimated at 250,000 trees, of which 170,000 are in the Nahivah of Kufah. J Near Rahabah are large salt fields, formed by the evaporation in the hot weather of previous floods; the more important are three in number, and are known as Wadi. al-Hamarah, feirajlyah and Rahmiyah, of these the first two are close together and the third about 3 miles from the others. These three fields together yield about 1,000 tons a year of salt, but the produce is of poor quality and has not been utilised of late years.

J NAJAF TOWN.— Sometimes characterised as Najaf-al-Ashraf and also well known as Mashhad 'Ali; a famous town of Iraq the most, sacred of the places^egarded as holy by Muhamma* dans of the Shi ah sect The origm of Najaf, unreliable tradition apart, is ob- flcure, and there is no mention of its existence earlier than the 10th century of the ChriatianNAJAP TOWN 1353 fera. Prom ancient times it has been maintained by some Muhammadan authorities that 'Ali was really buried at Kufah, and not here. In 1051 A.D. a Shi'ah shrine which existed here was burned by Sunnis from Baghdad. The battle of Qadislyah, by which the Muslims in 635 A. A. gained the province of 'Ira;i from the Persians, is believed to have been fought at a place about 10 miles west of the present town of Najaf ; Qadislyah was then a village, and its existance as suc h continued until the 14th century of the Christian era, if not longer. ■Pontion and -site, —Najaf stands in the desert 6 miles west-south-west of Kufah on the Hind [yah,; it is situated on a ridge of reddish sandstone and gravel and overhangs and overlooks from the north-east the Bahr or Sea of Najaf, described in the article on the Hindlyah, to which its site falls away in cliffs about 40 feet high. The Bahr is now dry near the town and contains several date plantations. In the plain surrounding the town every side except the south-west irregular earthen mounds rise in different directions; some of those to the north and east are about 30 feet high, but their summits are narrow. A mound of rubbish, also narrow-topped but commanding the town, is situated on the south-west side between the town and the Bahr. On the south, between the town and the Bahr , is open ground, where the. Turkish expeditionary force destined for Najd was encamped in 1904-05. The Hamtdiyah canal from the Hindlyah, mentioned again further on, runs in the bed of the Bahr skirting the foot of the cliffs; its bed, opposite the town, is 12 feet wide and 6 feet deep, and the water in it runs in midwinter about 6 feet wide and 6 inches deepit is occasionally filled up by drifting sand. The Hamidiyah canal is sometimes, from the name of the Saniyah agent who constructed it, called the Eakriyah. Cemeteries adjoin the northern and eastern sides of the town. The environs generally contain market gardens and plantations of young date trees which have not yet begun to bear fruit. Town and building*. —The town of Najaf, which is roughly quadrangular, is surrounded by a wall built a century ago to defend it from the attacks of the Wahabis ; the wall is about 30 feet high and has circular bastions, some 50 in number and each 50 feet in dia meter, at intervals of 100 yards. This work is now in a state of decay; in places it is cracked and in others it is actually falling down. There are two main gateways with gates, one 12 and the other 9 feet wide, on the eastern face of the town : of these the larger is the Bab-al-Husainand the other, opened only three years ago, is the Bab-al-Kufah, On the south-west side towards the Bahr is a third gate, called Bab Murad on account of a tradition that the turban of the Sultan Murad IV fell off when he was passing through it in 1638 or 1639 A.D. In the western wall is an aperture known as Thilmah which has no gate but is large enough to afford a passage for field artillery or other vehicles. At the north-east corner of the town, adjoining the military barracks, is a fifth gate spoken of simply as Bab, The principal building in Najaf is the shrine which contains the tomb of 'AH ; it rises in the centre of the town and is even richer and more splendid than the shrine of Husaln at Karbala. In general design it resembles the sacred edifices of Karbala; but it is double-storeyed, and the gold plating of the minarets reaches almost to the ground. Its dome has been described as ' a mound of gold rising .from the level deserts. ' * The main bazaar of Najaf runs from the shrine to the larger eastern gate, and in it are situated the old Turkish Government buildings or Sarai. There are some dilapidated barracks in the north-eastern part of the town. About a score of caravansarais for travellers are located in different quarters ; these include 5 or 6 well-built brick Khans of modern construction which stand outside the town on the north-east side at about 25 yards from the town wall. The houses of Najaf are mostly of brick and motar and new ones of modern design are steadily replacing those in the old style. The site of Najaf is greatly overcrowded. Inhabitants. —The population of Najaf, which has greatly increased during the last generation, is now estimated at more than 30,000 souls. Of these more than one-third are Persians and nearly all the remainder are Arabs ; but there are also about 250 Negroes, 100 Barbaris of Afghan origin, and 100 Indians. No Jews or Christians are found. With the exception of about 100 Sunnis, chiefly government employes, the entire population (including the Babaris) is Shi'ah, ♦See Loftus' Tra els and Researches, page 52. Loftas and his party are perhaps the oaly Christians who have ever entered the precincts of the shrine. C52(w)GSB1354 NAJAF TOWN The town is divided between two turbulent political or municipal factions, tBer Shumurd and Zugurd, ol which the origin and raison d'etre have not been explained, and in the past the public peace was often disturbed by their frays ; even at the present time serious fighting sometimes takes place' between them in the streets. The atmosphere of Najaf is one of Shi'ah culture and bigotry, both carried to greater lengths than at Karbala ; and most of the permanent residents depend for their liveli' hood on functions connected with the shrine, the pilgrims, or religion^ There are many Mujtahids, some of whom carry great weight in the Shi'ah world ; also real and nominal students of Shi'ah theology to the number, probably, of several thousands. The town boasts 15 Madrasahs or religious high schools and 90 mosques. Resources. —In a place so artificial as Najaf, a large town situated in a desert, supplies and transport are necessarily deficient. The water of the Bahr. when it contains any, is not drunk except by animals ; but it serves for washing and other domestic purposes, A better water supply is now furnished by the Hamidiyah, an open canal, which brings the water of the Hindiyah to the town ; and the ancient jingling proverb—•' He who takes up his hresidence in Najaf must he content with brackish Well-water barley-bread ! compensated for hy the virtue of the shrine of 'Ali ? '—has now lost its appropriateness. Trade and manufacture. 1 !.—The trade of Najaf, of which the river port is Kufah, depends on local consumption, on the influx of pilgrims, and in a minor degree on inter- Course with Jabal Shammar. Two-thirds of the imports are said to be consumed by pilgrims. The trade with Najaf is carried on by Hadrahs or commercial missions from the interior, sometimes private enterprises and sometimes officially despatched by the Amir of Jabal Shammar, which visit Najaf periodically to make purchases. In seasons of scarcity inland there is a steady flow of grain from Najaf to Hail. The principal exports of Najaf are lambskins, sheepskins and wool brought in from the adjacent country, 'Abas manufactured in the town, and grain. The chief imports are Manches ter piece-goods from Baghdad, sugar, Indian spices, tea, largely from Calcutta, hard- Ware and timber. The most important local manufacture is silken and woollen 'Abas, dyed in fast Colours and embroidered with gold thread ; it maintains about 200 looms and 30 shops in the town. There is a business also, as at Karbala, in praying tablets and inscribed shrouds. Administration. —-Najaf was the headquarters of the Qadha of the same name and the seat of a Qaim-Maqam, but Turkish officialdom was never conspicuous. A single telegraph wire connects Najaf with the Euphrates valley line at Hillah vid Karbala and Tawairij, but the working of this branch is inefficient and in 1905 it remain ed interrupted for several months continuously. There is also a post-office at Najaf. The town itself is administered as a municipality. The municipal building consists of 6 or 7 rooms, partly furnished, over the Bab-al-Husain : it was placed at the disposal of the British Consul-General on the occasion of his last visit to Najaf (1905). The interests of Persian subjects at Najaf are protected by a paid Naib-Karpardaz or Persian Consular Agent. In the early summer of 1915, the inhabitants of Najaf, incensed at the high-handed methods of the Turks in regard to recruiting, broke into incipient revolt and a battalion of Turkish tfoops and four guns were despatched from Baghdad to quell the disturbance. The disgraceful behaviour of these troops so exasperated the inhabitants that they threw off their allegiance to the Turkish Government and barricaded the streets and houses I against the troops. During the fight which ensued, the Turks, either by accident or design in turning their guns on to the townspeople, damaged the minarets round the shrine. Fighting continued for three days and at the end of that time the populace got the upper hand. The troops surrendered and were disarmed. The management of affairs was then taken over by local Arab Shaikhs, in consultation with the Chief Priest. (Murphy.) ' Religious importance. —Najaf owes its celebrity and even its existence to the estima tion in which it is held by Shi'ah Muhammadans as a place of pilgrimage and inter ment ; the subject of the Shi 'ah pilgrimages is fully dealt with in another place. The consecrated cemetery of Najaf, known as the Wadi-as-Salam, or Valley of Salvation, is even more highly esteemed than the corresponding necropolis of Karbala ; it covers the sandy plain to the north and east of the town, and it contains, besides myriads ofNAJ—NAJ 1355 i ffiti ^ itinB.!' obseure tombs, a few pretentious mausoleums and a number of enclosed family grave yards • some of the last are pictured as delightful places of retirement and seclusion. The deposit of bodies, at the rate of several thousands annually, has now been going on 1 At Najaf for centuries, grave being superimposed on grave ; mouldering bones are often visible, and the soil must now consist largely of decomposed human remains. This enormous difficulty in the way of sanitation may account for the epidemics which sometimes ravage the place inspite of a climate said to be healthy in comparison with that of the neighbourhood.— -[Persian Gulf GazetteeT.)

It is a loosely -linked group of nine more or less settled districts ■(from north to south), Qasim, Sadair, Woshm, 'Arich, 'Hanq, Aflaj, Salaiyin and Dawasir. The internal boundaries of the nine districts, though undehmited, appear tobe immut able, but their external boundaries lying in desert admit of no precison. Najd mea sures about 450 miles from the extreme from north Qasim to the extreme south of Dawasir and some 200 miles from the west of Washam to the east of Sadair. But it we follow its curving north and south axis, we get a length of well over uOO miles. Physical Chaeactee. Phvsicallv Najd falls into three parts;— , , -rrr i t&gt; I. A northern valley region determined by the middle basin of the Wady Kummah which lies south-east by north-west, and including the lower courses of _ the (un er- ground) tributary drainage from left and right. This is Qasim. The floor of this re g 10 ' sandstone in the south but becoming chalky in the north, is, to a large extent, covered by drift-sand, but remains exposed and topped by sandy loam m many considerable patches, where water is obtainable at a depth of a few feet. The main Wady ^self is a wide depression, varying in breadth from two miles to five hundred yards, least steep y inclined on the left bank, and having a well-defined storm -water course, which genera y hugs its cliffy right ban£ This watercourse may run from six to nme feet deep after heavy rain in the western harrahs. Between ^Anaizah and Buraidah the sand ^as drifted across the depression so as to form a dam, which often holds up storm-water for months in a large lagoon (Khabrah), Below this dam the bed of the depression becomes a salty slimy clay and bears little or no vegetation. From the left bank of the Wady the ground slopes up uniformly all above the sands as hard steppe, which runs up towards the highlands of •| aV &gt;al Shammar From the right bank the slope is more gradual, and, since there is less drainage flo g underground, the drift sand along the edge of the Wady itself is backed by a mor ba n en A central region dependent on a chalky, broken-up plateau, which trends from north to south and is composed of two ridges with escarpments faemg west lemg slop falling eastward. This plateau (Jabal Tuwaiq) has a mean elevation of about 600 feet above the general level of the plains to west of it. It admits of settled life in its hollows.1356 najd and bears one of the Xajdean districts, Sadair, almost entirely on its broad baolr tn getber with the northern half (Mahtnal) of another, 'Aridh. The two ridges divert in south Sadair, leaving an intramontane depression. The eastern ridge bears awav South-East into desert ; the western breaks down to a deep and broad gap and then alter rising again on the farther side takes a south-westward course. The gap allowt the waters drained off the western face to escape through the ridge by a great valley known at first as Wad! Haosiyab and lower as Wadi Hanifah. The upper part of this valley with the lower country on each side of the broken rigde make the rest of 'Aridh which is therefore about half and half chalky hill country and sandy valley and plain Below the westward escarpment of Jabal Tuwa.q lies a plain of sandy loam sloping gradually up towards south- est and divided longitudinally by a beft of drift-sand running north and south la its western part subterranean drainage collects and comes near the surface before finding its way from the northern haH to Wadi Rummah rom t e southern haM to Wadi Haisiyah This whole district may be called Washam 4^1 n i ^ partlClllarl - y to the so^hern part only, while the northern kn ' Vvilti Is lOW Water9hed contain9 a large water-logged depression I I r.

The settled folk are, however, almost all of oritrinal Bedawi stocks — Bani Tamim in Qasim ; southern 'Anazoh Tamim and Dawasir ; in central Najd and Dawasir and Qahlan in the south-west. If other tribes men come in, it is to &amp;3ttle. It is to this constant homogeneity of its society that Najd owes its common adherence to Wahha-bism, its unification under one sceptre, and its comparative stability and strength. Domestic Apparatus and Manufactures. These are as simple and primitive throughout Najd as in any other Arabian region where there is settled life. At the top of the very narrow scale stand the citizens of 'Anaizah in Qasim ; at the bottom the Daw a sir and Salaiyil villagers. All buildings are of sun-dried clay, with walls thinning upwards, except in the southern most villages, where the construction material is palm-branch. Roofs are flat, and made of clay laid on palm-fronds or tamarisk branches, which are supported by palm-beams. Windows are represented only by triangular light or smoke-holes. Each house has a court or yard used for keeping domestic animals, depositing dung, etc. Privies are very rare the yard, roof, street, or even a room being used. Two-storeyed houses are ex ceptional. Furniture — even a fitted divan frame — is virtually unknown. Men sit and sleep on palm-fibre mats, and half the floor will be bare and deep in dust. A shallow depression with a clay rim services as a hearth. For dishes and plates small palm-leaf mats are used. No implements for carrying food to the mouth ar; known. Artificial light is seldom provided ; only rich men possess badly-made petroleum lamps, imported from the Gulf. Cooking utensils are of copper, badly tinned, and of very simple forms. Except in Qasim these are seldom of native manufacture. Only v. ry rude ' kitchen ' pottery is made in Najd. Bread is baked in flat pancakes either on the ashes themselves, or, in the richer houses, on an iron tray. Except in Qasim towns, and the largest urban centres of S. Najd, there is no metallurgy : and even in those, cooking pots of copper, and other very simple vessels and necessaries alone are made. Coffee-pots come from Hasa, dagg ; rs and knives from Hail or the Gulf, and firearms exclusively from abroad. These last are adapted by the owners to their use by knocking off the sights, paring down the stock hammering in decorative nails, etc. They soon become foul, and are seldom or never cleaned. As for clothing materials, all are imported except the coarse woollen cloth used for abbas, and the woollen head-cords. Camel hair cloth for tents and saddle-bags is manu factured locally, but with only a monochrome stripe. Better calss ahbas come from Hasa. No underclothes except a cotton-shirt are worn. Foot-covering is only known to the rich, and leather articles are almost all imported, except the simplest utensils of ill-tanned! hide, c. g., water-skins and buckets (used in irrigation), skin robes of some nomads, and rude saddles, sandals, holsters, etc. Very little basket or reed-work is produced besides mats and fans. There is some- improvement on this standard of production in Qasim, especially in 'Anaizah ; but even there the technique and output are much below those of Gulf ports, e. g., Kuwait; and the apparatus of the household is of the simplest. Throughout Najd the foodstuffs do not go beyond milk, ghi, dates and bread, as staples ; and rice and mutton as luxuries.. Trade. There is almost nothing to treat under this head, except in respect of one district. This produces a superfluity of dates and ghi (butter), but in the last commodity trades more as middleman than producer, collecting from the Bedawi herdsmen of the western and northern steppes. At one time it used to breed horses for export, but (as also in central Najd Washam and 'Aridh) the production of these has almost ceased as a result of the wars between Hail ahd Riyadh during the past half century. But if Qasim does not produce much, it trades in the products of others more than any other Arabian district. Doughty heard in 1878 that more than a third of its population acted as carriers, and hirers-out of camel -transport. Hence the society of the whole district, and especially its towns, has an exceptionally commercial and cosmopolitan character. In the rest of Najd comparatively little caravan traffic seems to go on. Leachman heard in 1912 that trade had declined to almost nothing in Riyadh; but Shaqrah, though not what it was, seems still to be a trading centre. There is said to be regular1358 NAJD traffic between Riyadh and the south-western districts of the peninsula by way oi Wa ii Dawasir, but what its measure and character may be is not known. Currency. The only currency in common use in Najd is the silver Spanish dollar {rial) ; but when the Amirs' dues and the Meccan contributions are paid very few coins remain in circula tion. There are no smaller denominations except stray Turkish pieces, and these are accepted only in Qaslm. In S. N ijd even Turkish gold is taken very reluctantly. Persian currency, and the rupee, though common on the Gulf Coast, do not pass in Najd, except, possibly, with big merchants of Qasim towns or of Shaqrah, and at heavy discount. Doughty, however, got rials for a cheque in 'Anaizah. Ordinary exchange is effected by barter in kind calculated on a ba is of date fruits, measured by the sah (see below). Weights and Measures. Dates are measured by weight, says Doughty, at 'Anaizah, but what weights are used as a standard he does not say. Leachman reports Indian weights and measures to be used at Sha^rah, but gives no details. (Compare Indian scales used at Masqat, p. 1193.) Doughty (1877) found a measure of content, the sah (of Al-Madinah), in use as the basis of trade in dry commodities throughout W. Central Arabia. He says it varies according to locality, being equivalent to nearly 2 pints at Taima ; Hail 2| ; nearly 3 at Al- 'Ali; and 6 at Khaibar. He gave the following table:— 12 sahs —1 medega (a mall palm-basket):— 5 medegas = l mejellad. ? mejellads = l hashiah (a skinful of dates). Lorimer {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, 1908) gave the following for both South Najd and Qasim : ' W holesale weights are the Waznah = 52 dollars in silver coin, or about 3 lb. 1 oz. 6 dr. English avoidupois, and the Mann — 40 Waznahs, or about 123 lb. 6 oz. 12 dr. Wholesale weighments are usually made with a sort of steel-yard. For retail transactions dry and liquid measures of capacity are employed, which are really weights in disguise The standard sizes of bowl are the Midd, which holds a Waznah, and the Sa', which holds two : but quarters, fifths, sixths, and eighths of Sa's are also employed.' This is in tabular form : 1 Waznah = 1 Midd. 2 Waznahs or Midds =1 Sah. 20 Waznahs or Midds 7 , ,, 20 Sahs 1 =1 Mann - The unit of lineal measure, he adds, is the Dhira=\§\ inches. Recent History and Present Politics. All Na,jd acknowledges the Sa'ud dynasty of Riyadh in Aridh. The present ruler of Najd is the Amir Abdul Az z-a 1-Faisal-as-Sa'ud. Its jurisdiction is enforced directly by accredited representatives, in 'Aridh, Sadair, and probably Kharj, and also in parts of Aflaj, Washam, Qasim (e. g., Buraidah), and probably, Har'q ; indirectly in the other parts of these latter districts, in the towns of 'Anaizah and Majma', and probably in Salaiyil and Dawasir, Each town has its amir or governor and its wwyZis or council, but only in Anaizah of Qas m have we heard of the council having much power. Hereditary amirs are not uncommon even in directly administered districts, and they seem to be the rule in the outlying quarters of the south, where, as in parts of Washam also, the settlements are free except for a tributary obligation. The origin of the present power of Riyadh will be found in the article on that town. It suffered eclipse at the hands of the Shammar Amirs of Hail from the middle of the eighties of last century until 1902, the representatives of the Sa'ud family being reduced after 1891 to puppets, while Rashidite governors took charge of all the important settle- ^Sadair, Aridh and Washam. This state of things was terminated by Abdul Az z Ibn Sa'ud, who had remained in exile at Kuwait with his fathers Abdur- ahman, until he heard that his uncle, the mediatized Amir, had been murdered by Ibn , I. &lt; ' rs ' With only about forty followers he appeared in Sadair, raised part of that distnet and marched on 'Aridh, where he had no difficulty in surprising and removing A ^ aS i 6 8° V0n ' l0r 0 f Riyadh. His father stood aside and accepted his son as Amir. Acknowledged by all the southern provinces, 'Abdul 'Aziz marched on Qasim in 1904,NAJD 1359 and though forced to retire thence by a Turkish force, sent under Ahmad Faizi Pasha to co operate with the Amir of H. il, he returned in 1906, and has held that district to tribute, and partially in direct subjection, ever since but not without frequent skir^ mishes with the forces of Jabal Shammar. In 1910 he had to meet both an mtemal and an external danger. Certain graidsons of his late uncle, A ud, claiming the throne the elder branch, tried to raise Kharj and Hariq. At the same time AMu^h, the son of the Grand Sharif, appeared in Qas m, professing to champion rights of the Ata bah violated by 'Abdul 'Aziz. The latter's younger brother, Sa ud his representative m Oas m was made prisoner; but finding that the Amir of Hail, who had lately made peace with'Abdul'Aziz, did not co-operate, 'Abdullah retired stipulating that the Qasim towns contribute to the Meccan treasury a sum of £4,000 annually (the h^gertowns had previously paid such ' Peter's pence 'voluntarily), and be free to elect their own governors. 'Abdul 'Aziz assented to these terms. The southern rebels had no success, Ld after being driven, from town to town, fled out of Najd For 'Abdul 'Az z inflicted heavy punishment on the Ataibah a year later, in violatio his convention with the Sharif. Hard pressed for resources he had been coveting Hasa which before 1871 pertained to his dynasty, and he had tried, without much success, enlist the support of the Indian Government, seeking to revive an agreement which had subsisted between his uncle, the Amir 'Abdullah, and ourselves m regard to Gulf matters. The Balkan War and the internal dissensions of the Ibn Rashid house at last offered him an opportunity, and the presence of rebel grandsons of Sa ud at Hofuf, an excuse : and early in 1913 he descended on Hasa, captured the central oasis, and ten days later, Qatif. He sent the Turkish governor and garrison down to Gjair, whence they made their way into Al-Qatar. At the end of that year he had a conference with two representatives of the Indian Government, and, after a show of negotiating, with the Ottoman Power and aecepting the title- Wah of NaR 'he mv.ted a Bnteh agent to his court, and declared for us and against Ibn Rashid, the ally of the Turks. The latter advanced early in 1915 into Sadair, but retired after fighting a drawn battle at Irtawiyah, near Zilfi, in the course of which our newly arrived agent Captain Shakespear was unfortunately killed. In the early autumn the Grand Sharif, who shelters the rebel grandsons of Sa'ud, again sent up 'Abdullah, with a considerable force to mediate between the two Amirs and at the same time to enforce, the pact of 191o' especially its financial clause. A peace was patched up (it has not been very faithfully observed), and the Sharif's son retired, leaving some soreness behind. _ The present attitude of 'Abdul 'Aziz is opportunist He subscribes to the Arab Unionist party, headed bv the Sharif, but disparages the latter and allows the Turks to procure rarnels from his territory. At the same time he does his best to be on terms with the Indian Government and has, lately, concluded a definite treaty with it, of the same kind as those in force with the Gulf potentates. He keeps his grip on Hasa and Qasim. North-Eastern District. Batn A depression included in the desert of Hajarah and crossed on the route from Najaf to Hail at about one-third of the distance from Najaf. Batn has a length from north-west to south-east of about 100 miles, one-third of which is to the west of the usual Najaf-Hail route and the remainder to the east of it; the breadth of Batn is about 3 hours and its slope is downwards to the south-east. On the south Batn is bounded by a clay plain, which gradually rises from it; and on the north by a remark able rocky scarp, called Jal-al-Batn, about 140 feet high and co-extensive in length, or nearly so, with the Batn itself. Above the Jal, is a stony tableland stretching away to the north without visible change of level. The track scales the Jal, ot which the vertical face is to the Batn plain, by a difficult pass, called merely 'Aqaba ; here camels frequently lose their foot ing, and elsewhere the Jal is said to be generally impossible of ascent even by men climbing. The surface of Batn at the1360 NAJD North-Easfern District —contd. . Batn— conid. . . bottom of the Jal shows signs of strong water action and con tains some pasture. There are various wells in Batn and its elevation above the sea is about 1,640 feet. Batn is debatable land between the Shamrnar and 'Anizah tribes. Hajarah .. .. A hard stony tract or calcareous desert of great extent^ lying to the north-east of the Nafud between Hazil on the north-west and a point considerably beyond the ordinary Xajaf-Hail route on the south east. On the south. Hajarah is bounded by tho Kafud and on the north it includes Batn and a considerable area beyond, approaching to within about 50 miles of Najaf.* The greater part of Hajarah consists of an unvarying succession of broad ridges, like waves, alternating with gravelly plains; not a single hill meets the eye to relieve the monotony or serve . as a landmark, unless we except the Jal-al Batn and a couple of small hills called 'Athaman, which are 10 miles north of Batn on the west side of the Darb Zubaidah. Hajarah is traversed both by the Darb Zubaidah and b} 7 the Hazil route between Xajaf and Hail. Shammar and 'Anizah Bedouins camp in it while pasturage lasts and while there is water in the tanks upon the Darb. Hazil .. .. See Article Hazil. Khadhra (Jabal) .. A solitary hill 2 hours south-west of the Khadhra wells on the ordinary Xajaf-Hail route. It stands in a depressed tract of dark soil which covers a large area. L'nah .. .. Se?. article Linah. Loqah .. .. A halting place on the direct route from Tauf-al-'Amir to Shabaikh nn the Darb Zubaidah : it is said to lie 0 hours east of Hazil and to possess about 25 wells with water, equal in goodness to river water, at 12 fathoms from the surface. Loqah is used as a summer camping ground by the Shammar. Rutha (W adi-ar-) .. A valley which begins between the wells of Lainah and Birkat Ashshar on the ordinary Najaf-Hail route ; it runs north as far as Birkat Zibalah on that route, its drainage then dispersing part- ly northwards to Batn and partly eastwards to Hajarah. The adi is two or three miles in breadth, and its fall in a courss of some 25 miles appears to be about 500 feet. The name Rutha h derived from a plant which grows in the valley and is much prized as pasture for both camels and horses ; the grazing rights belong to the Shammar. A camping ground about 25 miles east of Baqa'a sometimes used by the Persian Hajj as an intermediate stage between Khadhra and Qitaiyan near Baqa'a. At one time the pilgrim route instead of continuing through Hail turned southwards at this point and ran to Buraidah in Qaslm. Sha'aibah has 30 or 40 'vv el s, 15 to 20 feet deep, of very salt and bitter water; they stand in a large bare space with hills of white sand to the north of them.

A scarp somewhat similar to Jal-al-Batn and parallel to it, but in every way less striking ; it crosses the Darb Zubaidah 20 or 80 miles on the Najaf side of Batn. This Jal is said to have a. length of about 40 miles and consists of two tiers with an aggre gate height of 70 feet and with a level space between them 100 yards in extent. The steep face of the scarp is to the south-west. See article Darb Zubaidah. iSoiitJh Wtst'rn District. A village situated 2 days' south-south-west of Rass in Qasim on the Kuwait-Mecca route. It consists of about 40 mud houses. Grain and vegetables are grown, but there are no date palm ; irrigation is from a score of wells with good water at 7 fathoms. The inhabitants are partly Negroes and partly Arabs of Qasimi extraction. 'Ataibah, TIarb and Mutair Bedouins all camp in the neighbourhood of Dhariyah. A camping ground 50 miles south-south-west of 'Anaizah and 4 or 5 miles eastwards from Jabal Khazaz% There are about 40 wells scattered over a space of 1 or 2 miles ; they contain good water at about 3 fathoms. At one time Dukhnah was exclusively occupied by the Mutair, but it subseqMertly passed to the 'Ataibah, whose tribute to the Amir of Jabal Shammar was collected here in 1884. The Qahtan have been known to visit the place, and were surprised and severely punished there in 1878 by the Mutair and the people of 'Anaizah with whom they were then at feud. A considerable walled village of Sabai' on the route from Riyadh to Mecca ; it is situated in the desert about two-thirds of the way from 'Ayainah in Wadi Hanifah to Jabal-an-Nir and probably lies about 110 miles south and slightly east of 'Anaizah. There are date groves and numerous wells with sweet water at 8 fathoms. A great tract of stony desert of which the eastern border is near the 'Afif wells ; its extent south -Avestwards from 'Afif is 2 i days march and its length from north to south is said to exceed its breadth. It foims a part of the Dirah^ of the 'Ataibah tribe. According to some authorities, it is identical with Shiffa. Some hills about 80 miles south-south-west of 'Anaizah on the route to Mecca. The rocks are said to bear numerous inscrip tions, which have not yet been examined, and to contain gold.* *Huber was informed that the clue to the mines was lost. The story now told by native informants is that the old, in the form of dust, is found in a cavern on the north side of the hills, which the Arabs dare not enter for fear of meeting with dangerous animals and reptiles.

A hamlet of the Sabai tribe in the desert, 12 hours' march east wards of Jabal-an-NIr ; it is a halting place on the Riyadh- Mecca route. There are corn-fields and a score of wells holdiug sweet water at 7 fathoms. A small range of hills running parallel to the ' Anaizah-Mecca route near Dukhnah at a distance of 4 or 5 miles to the north west. Here is said to have been fought in pre-lslamic times a decisive battle between the Tubba' of Yaman and Kukih, Shaikh of the Rabi'ah. A hamlet of 30 mnd houses a few miles north of Dhariyah; it is surrounded by a wall with 4 towers. The inhabitants are Arabs of mixed origin. The wells contain good water at 8 fathoms, and cereals are grown, but no dates. Sheep and goats are numerous an 1 there are a few other animals. 'Ataibah and Mutair Bedou ins encamp in the vicinity, the former in summer. A mass of low hills about 120 miles south by west of 'Anaizah on the south -east side of the route to Mecca and adjacent to it. Jabal-an-Nir stands in a hollow and is masked from the north by a detached hill called Kadhadiyah ; the drainage of the surround ing desert gravitates to the depression which surrounds Jabal-al- Nir and supplies several groups of wells, one of which, Hanabij, is said to comprise 200 borings. Jabal-an-Ni-* is low on the north, and its contours are mild. The route divides it from the hills of Shi'ar and Shi'abah to the north-west of which the latter is craggy and said to contain many Badun or wild groats. A village in the desert, probably to the west-south-west of Washam ; the route from Shaqrah to Mecca is said to pass through it. Altogether there may be 100 houses; the inhabitants are Bani Zaid, Bani Khalid of the 'Arafah section and Bani Khadhir, along with a few 'Ataibah and Qahtan. The Bani Khalid live in a separate Qasr which is a mile or two to the south-west of the main village. Dates, cereals, vegetables, lucerne and melons are grown. Water is at 6 fathoms, livestock are numerous ex cept horses. The Shaikh is of the Bani Zaid, at present 'Ab- dullah-bin-Mas'ud. A largish village of 100 or more houses on the route from Riyadh to Mecca, about midway between Duwadimi and Khanuqah. The Arab inhabitants are mostly Bani Zaid of the Qaihab section, but some Sabai', 'Ataibah and Qahtan are also found. In number Bani Khadhir and slaves predominate over the Arabs. There are a few date palms and numerous wells with sweet water at 9 fathoms. According to Meccan information, the authority of the Sharif of Mecca begins and that of Ibn Sa'ud ends at Sha'arah, but it is not certain that this has the acceptance of Ibn Sa'ud. A group of 20 Nvells on the ordinary route from 'Anaizah to Mecca 35 to 40 miles south by west of Dukhnah. They contain good water at 3 fathoms and are frequented by 'Ataibah Bedouins. A desert tract on the first part of the route from'Anaizah to Mecca. The true application of the name is uncertain ; by some it is given to the stretch between Rass and the wells of 'Afif, by others (who consider it to be identical with Hazam-ar-Raji) to the tract next beyond 'Afif. Political organization and external relations. —The normal constitution of Jabal Sham- mar, Qasim and Southern Najd, the three states which together compose Central Arabia, is described in the articles under their names. Each of those articles, however, ends with the intimation that an ostensible Turkish sovereignty or suzerainty has been establishedNAJD 1363 end-'*' 1 ' in the tract with which it deals, and it remains to consider here how far the Ottoman Government have been successful in enforcing their pretensions. a , In 1904 when a state of war had for some years prevailed between Ibn Sa ud, ruler of Southern Najd, and Ibn Rashid, the Amir of Jabal Shammar, the Turks intervened with a military force on the side of Ibn Rashid ; but they were defeated in two actions bv the followers of Ibn Sa'ud and the people of Qasim, nor were these reverses ever made good on the field of battle. Early in 1905, however, Ottoman officials at Basrah suceed- S inducing Ibn Sa'ud to negotiate. The result of the discussions became apparent In April 1905 when Qasim was formally occupied by the Turks and it was understood that Ibn Sa'ud had professed allegiance to the Sultan ; the effect, Ibn Rashid e n 3 already a Turkish vaL, was to convert the whole of Central Arabia at least m name, into a' Turkish province. A Turkish cantonment was established at Shaihiyah inQasi m and Turkish garrisons of 100 men each were placed in the towns of Anaizah and Burai- dah ; but no attempt was made, apparently, to coccupy any point either m Jabal Sham- mar or in Southern Najd. The design of the Porte was plainly to create out of Qas.m a neutr'utate garrisoned by themselves, which should serve to separate the territories of the rival native powers in Central Arabia and prevent their committing aggression noon one another • and the Turkish Government probably hoped that their own command ing position between the disputants would throw the balance of power into their hands and enable them to dominate, with an insignificant military force, the politics of Central Arabia So far did the confidence of the Turks in their scheme extend that they pro ceeded to parcel out the country into civil administrative divisions as if it had actually been incorporated with the Ottoman dominions. Southern ^ajd was declared to be a Qadha having its Markaz or headquarters at Riyadh and Ibn Sa ud for Qaim-Maqam. In Qa^m Buraidah and the places dependent on it were erected_ into a Qadha under Salih-bin-H asan -bin-Mahanna, Shaikh of Buraidah, as Qaim -Maqam ; and at the same Sne -AnSand its villages were constituted a bin ' Abdullah -bin-Yahya, Shaikh of 'Anaizah, was appointed the fir.t Mud r. QWutMaqam of Southern Najd and the - d . ^o~arda nallv made subject to the authority of the Wall of Basrah ; but the relations towards each oXr of the last two do not seem to have been defined ; and the titles of all as soon became manifest, were honorific and implied no real subordination to the Porte. iSo Turkish civil officials from abroad were introduced into the new province, not even in o its Qasim District: indeed the whole of the arrangements from the first were little better than make-believe. The results of the scheme were far, it may safely he said, from corresponding with the anSipTtions of the projectors. The Turkish -d 'betag nfter it* institution employed to enforce compliance with Turkish policy, and, Deing rfnTdlv reduced by desertions and deaths, it soon ceased to inspire awe or even respect In April 1906 the son of Ibn Sa'ud, ignoring the presence of the Turks in Qas.m, attacked and slew Ibn Rashid on the borders of that district; and a little later he seized and denorted the Shaikh of Buraidah, who enjoyed, equally with his own father Ibn Sa ud, the status of a Turkish Qaim -Maqam. The weakness of the Turks in Central Arabia J i' that thev dared not even manifest their displeasure at these insulting acts , Td from the^at^it reports it would seem that their military strength in the country soon after reached the vanishing point. • . i r u , . . ^ rin^ not annear that the claim of the Turks to have establish- I n the drcumstan a otectora t e , over Central Arabia was substantiated ed effective sovereignly, ^ between Turk and the Alies ; on the contrary, it would before the outbreak ° with fac ts, the whole of Central Arabia was independent Arabian peninsula, as of all the Arab provinces oi 1 Turktrempire. rests upon the outcome of the present contest. NAJD (SOUTHERN)— ,i, . v f 0 f a mor e distinctive term sanctioned by usage we are obliged to call by this r ' ' i lacfp nf districts which form the southern part of Central Arabia and name the dominions of the Wahhabi Amir. Middle Najd is better known under 'lie title of QasTm, and Northern Najd is generally referred to as Jabal ; PPMmi MJD Shammar; but Southern Najd has no alternative designation, and it is not clear that the name even which we have applied to it is current among the Arabs. Limits. —Political changes keep the boundary of Southern Najd to the north in per petual vibration ; but westward, on this side, it tends to settle at Wadi-as-Sirr between ash am and Qasim, and further to the east at Wadi-ar-Rummah on its lower course from Qasim to the Dahanah&lt; On the west the frontier of Southern Najd is approxi mately represented by a line parallel to the watershed between the Red Sea basin and Central Arabia and about 100 miles east of it. On the remaining two sides the limits of Southern Najd are natural and well marked ; oil the south it ends in the Ruba'al-Khali or Great Southern Desert, and on the east it is separated from the littoral districts of the Persian Gulf by that comparatively narrow, but long and perfectly continuous strip of desert which is known as the Dahanah. * Physical features and divisions. —Southern Najd has never been surveyed, and the greater part of it is as yet unseen by European eyes, nevertheless something is known of its chief regions and their characteristics. The dominant feature of the country is Jabal Tuwaiq, a range or elevated tract which has its commencement approximately in the 27th parallel of north latitude and thence runs almost due southwards, for the space of at least five degrees of latitude. Of the actual height, breadth and configuration of the northern part of this range or plateau we have little certain information ; of the southern, none. Our knowledge of Jabal Tuwaiq is practically confined to the facts that in the north it consists of a light- coloured stone, calcareous in appearance ; that its eastern slopes give birth, rather, nearer its northern than its southern end, to Wadi Hanifah, one of the only large valleys properly so called, of Central Arabia, and that beyond Hautah, the hills assume a darker hue and are perhaps of a different geological formation. The existence of this imperfectly known range enables us to distribute the districts of Southern Najd into three groups, the first consisting of the districts which reach from Jabal Tuwaiq east wards to the Dahanah, the second of the single one between Jabal Tuwaiq and the Great bout lern Desert, and the third of those that lie on the farther (that is on the western) side of Jabal Tuwaiq, 1 he northernmost district of the first group is Sadair, which lies chiefly on the Tuwaiq plateau and is furrowed by four well marked hollows, of which one has a westerly and the ot icr three an easterly course. The district contains a fair proportion of arable land, and water is obtained from rather shallow, wells, but does not apparently reach the surface in springs. Immediately south of Sadair, and not divided from it by any very conspicuous landmark, is the premier district, in the political sense, of all Najd : this is Andn, a tract hilly or even mountainous towards the north, west and south, level to the east and m the centre, and seamed across by the deep Wadi Hanifah with its nume- tous villages and (in places) highly cultivated banks. 'Aridh includes Dhrumah, a valley \ ing to the west ofthe Puwaq hills but sending its drainage through that range into the ontfv nf' 'r *1 'it 1 niass of Jabal 'Alaiyah perhaps an eastern 1 'tv, f f 1 iT ( ^ 1 Aridh from the next trough or compartment to the south- Wn r ' ft by A the thl,ce ln ter-connected districts of Harlq, Hutah and Kharj.

Hariq and Hautah are covered with date groves, ^ 7 C ™, ls raise from wells of no excessive depth. To the north- east and east of Kharj is Sahabah, a sandy and featureless tract with one large spring: from 'iridiT dram ^ e ?fHari q Hautah and Kharj, but also the floods of Wadi Hanifah S , ^8% absorbed and disappear in the Dahanah.

Widyan Dawasir is. in parts, not ill supplied with water from wells ; and it contains manv villages and date plantations and much cultivation. ^ , . At some point Widyan Dawasir receives, it is said, from the west a part of the dram- age of Wadi Sabai', the first of the trans-Tuwaiq districts which we have had occasion to notice. This district is a plain or system of open valleys with springs and shallow wells where cultivable soil alternates with sandy desert and collections of stagnant water are formed after rain. With Wadi Sabai' is associated another Wadi, that of Tathlith, which lies apparently to the south of it and it sometimes reckoned a separate district of Southern Najd. The last remaining district, Washam, is also behind i™iq, but less remote from the centre of Southern Najd ; it lies immediately west of Sadair and 'Aridh, it is practically surrounded by sandy deserts or by hills, and its drainage seems to have no outfall. The soil of Washam is described as a sandy loam at times cultivable by the unassisted rainfall. More full and exact information in regard to these districts is given under the name of each. , . , . , . . ^ , Southern Naid is, like Jabal Shammar, a portion of Central Arabia which the lava hills in the west of the peninsula have saved from burial under growing, and moving sands : the limestones are still generally exposed, but here and there, especially in de pressions, are strips and intervals of sand. , , . , , , . • Climate and products.—The climate is healthy and, in the highlands even mvigorat- ina Pasture is abundant, but there is a scarcity of trees except date-palms. The four staple products of nearly all the districts are dates, barley, wheat and maize ; but cotton and millet are also grown. Some localities produce fruits, including figs, peaches citrons grapes, pomegranates and melons ; also lucerne, brinjals, onions, spinach and other vegetables The date groves of Wadi Hanifah are famed for their size and luxuri ance while the palms which cover the valley of Hautah are particularly fine and prolific, a single tree there sometimes yielding (it is said) as much as 14,000 pounds weight of dates in a season; the date plantations of Aflaj are described as extensive but thin. Horses are bred by the nomad tribes and sent, for exportation, to 'Anaizah and Buraidah in Qasim. Camels are numerous; those of the southern nomads have frequently a blackish tinge and are smaller than the dun-coloured animals of Jabal Shammar. There are no buffaloes, but cattle of a small-limbed, humped breed are comparatively abun dant in the south, especially in Kharj : nowhere is there any lack of sheep and goats. Wild animals include leopards, wolves, and jackals ; and in the south lions are said to be found Among the game of the country are the gazelle, bustard, partridge, sand- grouse, quail and pigeon and, possibly, the wild boar. Southern Najd, in common with Jabal Shammar,* is said to enjoy almost complete immunity from insect pests. Communications. — See Routes in Arabia, 1915. Population— The population of Southern Najd, both fixed and migratory, is composite ^The Arab txibeiTto which the settled inhabitants of the districts principally belong are the 'Anizah, Dawasir, Sabai' and Bani TamTm, to whom may be added the Fadhul and Sahul Of these the Dawasir, besides practically monopolising Widyan Dawasir and Aflat are found in all the districts enumerated above as composing the Wahhabi domi nions except the petty ones of Wadi-as-Sirr and Wadi Tathlith ; the Sabai' are the next most widely distributed after the Dawasir ; and the Bani Tamim, though not found in so many districts as these two, are a strong tribe and enjoy a local predominance in Sadair. Oher Arab stocks, but of less importance as settled residents in this part of the country, are the 'Aid, Ashraf, 'Ataibah, Buqum, Bani Hajir, Harb, Hataim, Bani Khalid, Mutair, Qahtan, Shammar and Bani Zaid ; the number of persons belong- in^ to some of these is very small. Inferior non-Arab tribes of cultivators, comprehen sively described as Bani Khadhir, are a large element in the population ; and the menial caste of Sunna' is represented in many places : there are also a few Awazim or Hawazim. 'See Huber's Journal de Voyage, page 179,1366 NAJD A strong infusion of negro blood and a considerable proportion of full negroes are said to exist in the southern districts, especially in Aflaj and Widyan Dawasir. The information available regarding the distribution and numbers of the tribes mentioned will be found in the articles under their names and the names of the districts which they inhabit. The Bedouins of Southern Najd are for the most part these:—'Ataibah in the vast stretch of country between Qasim and Mecca and in the districts of Wadi Sabai', Wadi-as-Sirr, Washam, Sadair, 'Aridh and Kharj ; Dawasir in Widyan Dawasir, Afiaj and Kharj ; Mutair in Sadair, Washam, Wadi-as-Sirr and in the direction of Miskah and Dharlyah, etc.; Qahtan in Wadi Tathlith, Wadi Sabai', Washam and even Sadair ; and Sabai' in Wadi Sabai', Kharj and 'Aridh. Besides these some 'Ajman visit Kharj and some Buqum frequent Wadi Sabai'. The Sulaba wander in Southern Najd as they do elsewhere in the interior of Arabia. The following is a rough calculation of the population of Southern Najd, excluding Wadi Tathlith for which no estimate is possible:— Fixed. Nomadic. Aflaj .. 22,000 'Ajman 1,003 'Aridh .. 30,000 'Ataibah 6,000 Widyan Dawasir .. 27,000 Buqum 1,000 Harlq 4,000 Dawasir 5,000 Hautah 6,000 Mutair 4,000 Kharj 3,000 Qahtan 8,000 Wadi Sabai, 16,000 Sabai' 5,000 Sadair 21,000 Sulaba, etc. 3,000 Wadi-as-Sirr 1,500 Total 33,000 Washam .. 6,500 Total .. 137,000 This gives a total population of 170,000 souls distributed over a region of which the area is not less then 50,000 square miles ; the average deasity of population consequently appears to be less than 4 persons to the square mile. The people of Southern Najd are of good physique and often attain an age which would be considered advanced even in Europe ; among the manhood of the country the palm is awarded to the Bani Tamim, especially of Sadair, whose more than average physical development is attributed to the quantity of camel's milk that enters into their diet. The description of the settled population and nomads of Jabal Shammar applies in the main to those of Southern Najd, with this modification, that the inhabitants of Southern Najd are for the most part professed Wahhabis. Trade. —The meagreness of exports and imports bears testimony, in spite of the agri cultural wealth of a few favoured localities, to the general poverty of the country and to the almost total absence of surplus produce. Horses to India and ghi to Hasa are per haps the only articles exported, while imports are chiefly arms and ammunition, piece- goods and coffee. About half of the general imports is obtained through Hasa, while the other half is almost equally divided between Kuwait and the ports of Hijaz, The trade in arms is of an exeptional character and may not be of long duration ; at present it is conducted by Najdi merchants who visit the Masqat market once a year and, after purchasing a stock of arms, introduce them into Southern Najd by way of Qatar, a neighbourhood in which their operations are not exposed to interference by any/- 1' VL. NAJD 1367 Civilised power. English medicines are said to be obtainable in some of the bazaars of Southern Naid and some merchants of the southern districts, especially Hautah, are accustomed to visit India in the course of their ordinary business. Wholesale weights in Najd are the Waznah, equal to 52 dollars in silver coin or about 31h. 1 oz. 6dr. English avordupois, and the Mmn of 40 \\ aznabs or about 123 lb. 6 f oz. Wholesale weighments are generally made with a sort of steelyard. For retail transac tions dry and liquid measures of capacity are employed which are really weights m dis- euise These take the form of turned wooden bowls made to contain exactly a unit by weight of the substance of fluid they are intended to measure ; this result is obtained by adjusting the cubic capacity of the bowl to the specific gravity of the article for which it is • to be used. The standard size of bowl are the Midd which holds a Waznah and the ba which holds two ; but quarters, fifths, sixths and eighth of Sa's are also employed. The unit of lineal measure is the Dhira of 19i inches. Turkish coins and the Riyal or Mana Theresa dollar circulate in Southern Najd and form the bulk of the currency ; the Indian VU ^overnmeniJ-~-A genealogical table of the ruling family of Najd will be found in the historical volume of this Gazetteer, they are known a^ the A1 Sa ud and the regnant member is Ibn Sa'ud par excellence. As head of the Wahhabi interest the ruler was formerly often described as the Imam ; but political considerations having since eclipsed religious in Southern Najd, he is now generally spoken of as the Amir. The Washam of the A1 Sa'ud is - placed, on a camel, on the near quarter : their battle-cry is either 1 am a horseman of ' Aujah, a son of Mijrin,' or ' I am a lord of Elijah, a son of Mijnn. Aujah means Dara'iyah and refers to the crookedness of Wadi Hanifah near that place. The viccissitudes undergone by the Wahhabi state have been so many and so violent that a general account based on past events and implying a fixed organisation would necessarily be misleading ; nor have we the materials for a complete and reliable descrip tion of the constitution and resources of the principality at the present day. Some permanent features appear in the historical account given in the other volume of this Gazetteer, and for the rest it may be observed that in the palmy days of the Wahhabi empire the greater part of the countrv was in strict subjection to the Amir ; justice was administered bv salaried Qadhis of the government; tribes were held responsible for crimes committed within their territory ; attempts were made to abolish the blood-feud svstem • one-fifth of the spoils of war went into she treasury of the ruler ; the ordinary Quranic Zakat was levied on land, merchandise, capital and other forms of property ; confiscation of land as a punishment for rebellion, followed by a regrant on terms of tenancy to the original owners, was not uncommon ; fines were levied on law-breakers, the proceeds being applied to such purposes as the relief of paupers, the support of teachers and ecclesiastics, the repair of mosques and wells belonging to the state, the maintenance and equipment of indigent soldiers and the entertainment of strangers at public hostels ; war was carried on by means of temporary levies of the Amir's subjects collected under a requisition that usually contained the significant formula : ' We shall not count those who join but those who do not ' ; less regular hostilities were initiated by proclaiming the enemy to be beyond the pale of the law ; a small body-guard of retainers kept by the Amir about his person was the only semblance of a standing army. The Wahhabis have abated the moral strenuousness of their earlier days, but an administration modelled somewhat on these lines probably still constitutes their ideal of government. The revenues of the Amir were estimated in 1865 at $402,000, of which Si 14 000 were derived from the Bedouins. In 18r&gt;5 the annual r&amp;venue was generally received in horses or otherwise in kind: it was either collected on the spot by emissaris from Rivadh or brought to the capital by leading men in person or their deputies. The revenue'of a district is now assessed about a month before the date harvest by a Wakll or subordinate official, generally a local man and frequently a merchant, who goes round the plantations and inspects them in company with a party of camel riders sent from Riyadh. This assessment is called Ikhras ; the result of it is communicated at once to the Amir. The duty of collecting the government share, which is taken in kind and is fixed at ^ of the gross produce, devolves subsequently on the Wakll, and the Wakll is also responsible for the storage of the same. Such is the procedure in regard to the taxation of dates, and that for ordinary agricultural produce is similar. The Amir afterwards makes local payments due by him in the form of orders or Hawalahs on the produce stored at1368 NAJ—NAJ convenient places; and every six months a settlement takes place with the local officials in consequence of which the balance of the Amir's produce is generally sold and the net surplus to which he is entitled is remitted in money to Riyadh. It is estimated that about a quarter of the tenth share or Zakat ultimately reaches the central treasury in this manner. Contingents for n otary service are still demanded by districts and towns, and it is understood that, up to a limit of one month per annum, these contingents must be maintained by the districts furnishing them, but their expenses after the first month are defrayed by the Amir. The W ahhabi ruler is represented at various places in his dominions bv Amirs or Gover nors ; such are Majma in Sadair, and Dilam in Kharj. These Amirs may be either local or non-local men, and in places where Ibn Sa'ud has reason to distrust the loyalty of the inhabitants they are generally the latter ; the Governors at the present time at Majma' and Dilam are apparently non-local. The relation of the Widyan DawSsir district, which at present is almost autonomous to the &gt;, ahhabi Government, is noticed in the article under its name.

The approach from Wadi Ma'awal is impressive ; at first only a watch tower on a pinnacle 200 feet high is visible : next a fort on a hill comes in sight; finally on skirting the base of the pinnacle, and passing under a two-arched viaduct, houses, palms, gardens, orchards and cultivations burst suddenly on the view. The settlement is scattered through date- groves and covers an area of perhaps 4 square miles : the date plantations, containing 25,000 palms, leave little space for other cultivation. There are 11 permanent quarters, some of which possess more than one Sablah or public hall, and other temporary quarters spring up in ths date season. The elevation above th3 sea is 1,100 feet, and, as Nakhl receives the sea breeze and is shelterd from hot winds, the climate is generally fresh and agreeable. The fort, which stands on an eminence betwe3n the pinnacle rock already mentioned and a hill called Jabal Laban, is not now in a serviceable state. Nakhl is celebrat ed for its hot springs : of these the largest group, including Hammam Thuwarah and about 20 others, rise among gardens at the head of the valley: on the otherside of the towo is a second group, of which the best known is Hammam 'Adaisah. These springs are tasteless and inodorous : their highest temperature is 106 o F. The population of Nakhl is mixed : the tribes of which it is composed belong mostly to the Ghafiri faction and include Salamiyin (200 houses), Bayasirah (100 houses), Bani Harras (65 houses), Kunud (50 houses), Ya'aribah (50 houses), Bani Kharus (40 houses), Bani Hadhram (25 houses), Sarairiy:n (20 houses), Nabahinah (20 houses), Yahamidah (15 houses), Bani Jabir (10 houses), Hirth of the Khanajirah section (7 houses), and Bani Azzan (4 houses). Some of the leading citizens of Nakhl belong to the Bani Harras. There are not many negroes and those are Mutawalladin with Arab blood : no Zatut or resident Persians are now to be found here. The total population of Nakhl is about 2,500 souls. The date-groves are prolific and their produce is celebrated, the Naghal date of Nakhl, a long-shaped variety, being held in high estimation. The water of the spring is entirely expended in irrigation. There is one water-mill for grinding flour. The bazaar consists of two streets and comprises over 60 shops. Turbans called Wizrah and lungis called Taurir are made, but these manufactures are not peculiar to Nakhl. Porous earthenware vessels for cooling water are manufactured by local potters, mostly of the Sarairiyan tribe, from bluish clay mixed with sand, some of which comes from Musilmat.

Na'man Island (also spelt Noman and Nu'mSn), the northern end of which is in Lat. 27° 8' N, Long. 35° 44' E. is 4 miles long in a south-south-east direction, and one mile wide; on its eastern side is a small harbour described below. The island is low and sandy at its northern end rising gradually to the southern end where it attains a height of about 400 feet in abrupt red limestone cliffs and hills. These hills are skirted by a few bushes, but are otherwise destitute of vegetation. From the northern end of the island a reef extends in a north-north-westerly direction for nearly 4J miles and is steep too. Between Na'man and Ras Abu Masahrib on the Hejaz coast, there is a navigable channel which, however, contains rocky patches. The anchorage, known as Sharm-an-Na'man, is roughly midway along the east side of the island ; it is in from 5 to 8 fathoms, with coral bottom, and is IJ cables wide. It affords shelter in all winds as the shores, from 80 to 100 feet high, drop almost perpen dicularly to the sea.

It is nearly eight hundred yards in length, and about three hundred and fifty yards at its extreme breadth. The direction of its greatest length is from east to west. Crossing diagonally, there is a shallow valley, dividing it into two nearly equal portions, which swell into an oval form. About a third of the height from its base, a massive wall, averaging in those places where it remains entire, from thirty to forty feet in height, is carried completely round the 8n21372 NAQAB-AL-HAJAR eminence, and flanked by square towers, erected at equal distances. There are but two entrances situated north and south from each other, at the terminaion of the valley before mentioned. A hollow square tower, each side measuring fourteen feet, stands on both sides of these. Their bases extend to the plain below, and are carried out considerably beyond the rest of the building. Between the towers, at an elevation of twenty feet from the plain, there is an oblong platform which projects about eighteen feet without and as much within, the walls. Presumably there was once a flight of steps at each ex tremity of the building, although now all traces of them have disappeared. This level apace is roofed with flat stones of massive dimensions, resting on traverse walls. It is somewhat singular that there are no traces of any gates. The southern entrance has fallen much to decay but the northern remains in almost a perfect state. The sketch on the map will illustrate its appearance and dimensions better than any verbal description Within the entrance, at an elevation of ten feet from the platform, we found the in- scnptions. They are executed with extreme care, in two horizontal lines on the smooth face of the stones of the building, the letters being eight inches long. Attempts have been made, though without success, to obliterate them. From the conspicuous situation which they occupy, there can be but little doubt, but that when deciphered, they will be found to contain the name of the founder of the building, as well as the date,' and purport of its erection. The whole of the wall, the towers, and some of the edifices within, are built of the same material, viz., a compact greyish-coloured marble, streaked with thin dark veins and speckles, and hewn to the required shape with the utmost nicety. The dimensions of the slabs at the base of the walls and towers were from five to six and seven feet in length, from two feet ten inches to three feet in height, and from three to four in breadth. These decrease in size with the same regularity to the summit, where their breadth is not more than half that of these below, where the thickness of the wall cannot be less than ten feet and about four at the summit. Notwithstanding the irre- gulanty of its foundation, the stones are invariably placed in the same horizontal lines carefully cemented with mortar, which has acquired a harness almost equal to that of the stone. Such parts of the wall as remain standing, are admirably knitted together; others \v hich, by the crumbling away of their bases, incline towards their fall, still adhere in their tottermg state without fracture ; and those patches which have faUen are scattered around in huge undissevered masses. There are no openings in these walls, no turrets at the upper part; the whole wears the same stable, uniform, and solid appearance.

Except the attempts toNAQ-- NAQ 1373 deface the inscriptions before noticed, there is no other appearance of the building having suffered from any ravages besides those of time ; and owing to the dryness of the climate, as well as the hardness of the material, every stone, even to the marking of the chisel, remains as perfect as the day it was hewn. The ruins of Naqab-al-Hajar, considered by themselves, present nothing more than a mass of ruins surrounded by a wall. But the magnitude of the stones used in its con struction, and the perfect knowledge of the builder's art, exhibited in the style and mode of placing them together, with its towers, and great extent, would give it importance in any other part of the world. Here in Arabia, where, as far as is known, architectural remains are of rare occurrence, its appearance excites the liveliest interest, That it owes its origin to a very remote antiquity is evident by its appearance alone, which bears a strong resemblance to similar edifices which have been found amidst Egyptian ruins. There is (as in them) the same inclination in the walls, the same form of entrance, and the same flat roof of stones. Its situation, and the mode in which the interior is laid out, seem to indicate that it served both as a magazine and a fort. The conclusion may be adopted that Naqab-al-Hajar was erected during a period when the trade from India flowed through Arabia towards Egypt, and from thence to Europe. Thus Arabia Felix comprehending Yemen, Sabai' and Hadhramaut, under the splendid dominion of the Sabaean or Homerite dynasty,* seems to have merited the appellation of which she boasted.

KASIRIYAH DISTRICT— A division of the Muntafik Sanjaq of the Basrah Wilayat in 'Iraq. Position and boundaries.—The District of NasirTyah is situated on the extreme lower course of the western branch of the Shatt-al-Gharaf, and on the Euphrates both above and below the confluence with it of that branch. The district is surrounded by tho District of Samawah on the west, Shatrat-al-Muntafik on the north, Suq-ash-Shuyukh on the east; on the south it is bounded by the ShamTyah Desert. Topoqatphy and inhabitants. —The only large place in the district is the town of Kasiriyah, but the villages of Azairij and Butaihah may be mentioned as they are the centres of Nahiyahs. The former of these is on or near the right bank of the Enphrates above Kasiriyah Town. The Euphrates and Gharaf rivers are the dominant physical features. The Arabs of the country belong to the Muntafik tribe. Population. —The fixed population of the Qadha is estimated at 53,000 souls, of whom all except 1,000 Sunnis and about 1,100 persons of other races and religions who reside in the town of Nasiriyah, —are Shi 'ah Arabs. Administration. —Besides its Markaz Nahiyah, this district comprises two others, Azairij and Butaihah, each of which is presided over by a Mudir resident in the village after which his subdivision is named. The whole of the cultivated land and the Marsh land from the borders of Nasiriyah downwards along the 'Aqiqah channel and the Mazlik channel, as far as the Hammar Lake, seem to have been held, up to comparatively recent times, by various aboriginal tribes as tribal property. The tribesmen paid light dues to their Shaikhs and probably re- distributed the land periodically amongst themselves. Date palms were few, and the main cultivation was rice. Towards the end of the fifteenth century the Sa 'adun family came in from the desert, dominated the aboriginal tribes, and settled in the country as overlords, holding at first none of the territory as their private pro perty, but imposing a fixed tribute upon the various tribes. This state of affairs conti nued until about 40 years ago, when the Turks began to bring 'Iraq under their regular control. Date gardens are found from a few miles above Nasiriyah on both banks of the river down to the boundaries of Suq, with considerable gaps in which only grain crops are grown. As the area which can be watered by '' lift '' is limited (the date gardens are of no great depth. On the Azairij side the gardens have the advantage of being flooded for a short time each spring. The gardens belong mainly to Muntafiqs or to non-tribal owners who have bought them from the Muntafiqs. The gardens on the actual edges of the Euphrates are usually cultivated by fellahs who do not belong to any of the regular tribes, and call themselves either Najjada (natives of Najd) or Hasawi (natives of Hasa). There is practically no rice cultivation in Nasiriyah, the crops being barley and wheat in the spring and millet in the summer.NAS-NAW 1379 4 K ASL ATAIN-AL-P ARH A— One of the spurs of the hills in the Taff district (g. v.), in Hasa, Eastern Arabia.

North of the Khausar on the same edge of the Tigris are copses called Hawiqah in ^ ich ^ re 'fl boar at times ; francolin are to be shot here, and up the lower reaches of the Khausar several kinds of duck and an occasional snipe are to be found. -1382 NIQ-NIS Kuyunjik, the larger of the two mounds, is about 100 feet high. Nabi Yunu^ tti emaller, has a fair-sized village on the top and a mosque (said to contain the tomW the Prophet Jonah) with a greenr minaret.

Westward of this spit and about three cables from it is the most convenient inner anchorage off Dohah. In the small bay here are several shoal patches which, however, show plainly.—(Feman Gulf Pilot.) NISAB ( or A nsab)— A town in Western Hadhramaut, Southern Arabia, situated rather more than 150 miles (crowfly) north-east from Aden and 130 miles by road north of the anchorage of Maqatin. Niaab lies about 4 miles to the east-north-east of Maidak, the ddr of the upper 'Aulakl Sultan, and close to the confluence of Wadi Durra and Wadi 'Abadan. The greater part of the surrounding land is under cultivation. Near the eastern edge of this plain are a few ranges of low hills beyond which, to the north-east and east, stretches the desert of Hamam, also bounded by ranges of hills. The most important of these is Haid Hadhanah, about two days' caravan journey to the east. The desert is dotted here and there with metamorphic outcrops, the chief of which is Haid Megah ; near it ia a dry well said to be of Himyaritic origin. Across this desert to the north-east, two days caravan journey, lies the town of Shabwah, and half-way is Eyad {sic), a \ i lage containing the only well on the road. The water is, however, very brackish, and two hours to the west of the village is a mountain composed largely of rock salt. Nisab is an unwalled mercantile town of some 4,000 inhabitants. It is built of the Usual composite of stones and mud and contains several good houses and a mosque. The broad cultivated tracts round the town produce cotton, indigo, and millet, in considerable quantities. The crops depend for irrigation mainly on the valley streams and are often affected by drought. In dry seasons Nisab often runs short of grain and the Sultan has a standing arrangement with the neighbouring settlement of Markhah for its supply during such times. The Sultanof Nisab retains some 900 W.V and in the district round the town are some 2,000 tribesmen. Towards the west and south-west the fortified towers ofNI8—NIZ 1383 Hisn-al-Labas, Khandul, and Harashat, each on a commanding knoll, cover the approaches to the town. They are manned by very small garrisons in time of peace. Nisab being unwalled and containing a large non-combatant and alien population (about 60 per cent, being merchants from Hadhramaut) would stand little chance if seriously attacked.— {G. W.

KlZUK— A hamlet in the Wadi-al-Hoqain section of Wadi Bani Ghafir {q.v.) in the 'Oman Sultanate. NIZWA—• A town of 'Omftn Proper in the Sultanate of 'Oman, the most central of the district, situated at an elevation of 1,900 feet above the sea near the foot of Jabal Akhdhar, some 20 miles west of Izki and about the same east of Bhalah. The place is divided into an Alayah or upper town and a SifSlah or lower town, which are separated by WSdi Kalbu; the Alayah is on the east bank and is the further up-stream. The water-supply of the 'Alayah depends on a stream called Daris, that of the Sifalah on one called Ghunduq. Another whdi, Wadi-al-Abyadh, traverses the town and joins WSdi Kalbu near the market-place. Date groves succeed one another continuously upon the lower course of the Wfidi from Nizwa down to Raddah, and the number of the palms is estimated at 25,000. The houses of Nizwa are of stone, and many are two storeys high, but the streets are narrow. The fort of Nizwa, in the Sifalah, is reputed the strongest in 'Omftn : it consists of a hisn or large quadrangular enclosure, in one comer of which stands a huge cirular tower or keep, known as the QaFah. The whole construction rests on a solid base which rises to a considerable height above the level of the plain. The population may be 6,000, and many tribes are represented, especially the Bani Riyam (500 houses), Bani Hina (300 houses), Al Bu Sa'id (250 houses), Bani Rashid (80 houses), 'AwSmir of the Aulfid Saif section (40 houses), Kunfid (40 houses), Hirth (10 houses), Bani Hadhram (10 houses), and Bani Ruwahah (4 houses): besides these there are about 40 houses of mixed tribes including some Bayatirah of the Aulad Subah section. The Bani Riyam are found in the ' Alayah, also called Samad-al-Kindi, and their Shaikh in 1902 wa« one of the principal Shaikhs of the Bani Riyam ; he had at that time some influence with the Bani Riyara of Jabal Akhdhar and maintained a .blood-feud with hie brother, the Shaikh of Tanuf.1381 NOF —NUM Indigo is grown at Nizwa, also some sugar and cotton ; ordinary crops are wheat, barley, millet, maize, peas, beans, sesame and luoeme. Livestock are estimated at 7 horses, 600 camels, 60 donkeys, 150 cattle and 7,000 sheep and goats. There is some indigo-dyeing, and vessels and utensils of copper and brass are manufactured. Nizwa is now in the possession of the Sultan of 'Oman, who has a Wali here, and a garrison of 30 men, commanded by an ' Aqid, in the fort. About $3,000 is collected annu ally as 7akat, but no balance is remitted to Masqat. The present Sultan (Saiyid Taimur) owns some date groves here as his private property ; these have an annual value of S2,000 and are at present assigned to the Wali as a contribution towards the public expenditure.— {Persian Gulf OnzeUe c r.)

At half an hour's ride from the garden house of the Sharif (in the subrub of Al-Ma'abidah) the country opens out a little to the left. There the canal passes which supplies Mecca with sweet water ; and about two miles distant is the conical mountain called Jabal-an-Nur con sidered holy by pilgrims. In the vicinity of Jabal-an-Nur the rocks, which to the westward are of gneiss, with quartz and mica, change to granite. NUR JURUFT— A hamlet in Bahrain Island (q. v.), Persian Gulf.

The word 'Oman however is now (and has for a long time been) employed, with a wider but still purely geographical meaning, to designate the whole projecting butt of the Arabian continent which is enclosed be tween the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the Ruba'-al-Khali or Great Desert of southern Arabia. Upon the coast the geographical 'Oman is considered to end north westwards with the district of Sabakhat Matti, ♦ and southwards somewhere between Ras-al-Hadd and the district of Dhufar. 'O/tidn in the political sense and its divisions. —The political Oman has the same inland boundary, namely, the Ruba'-al-Khali desert, as the geographical; but upon the sea ita extent is somewhat greater. On the north-west it is bounded at the coast by Khor-al- 'Odaid, and it thus includes the districts of Mijan and 'Aqal which are beyond Sabakhat Matti: on the south it takes in the entire maritime district of Dhufar. The large tract thus constituted is divided chiefly between the 'Oman Sultanate and Trucial' Oman, of which the boundaries are more precisely explained in the articles under those names; but there is also a small tract between the two, consisting chiefly of the districts of Jau and Mahidhah, which is not subject to any recognised ruler and may therefore be styled Independent 'Oman. 'OMAN (Pbomontory and Gulf of)— The sense in which the term ' 'Oman Promontory ' is used throughout the present Gazetteer may here be explained. It is used to describe that great projection of the Arabian coast of which the point nearly blocks the entrance of the Persian Gulf, and of which the base is a line running from Abu Dhabi Town to the Baraimi Oasis and thence to the town of Sohar. The point and eastern side of the promontory consist of a range of mountains which are a continuation of those forming the Western Hajar of the 'Oman Sultanate; the western side is flat and open. The political distribution of the promon tory is rather complex. The district of Ruus-al-Jibal at its extremity is an isolated possession of the 'Oman Sultanate, divided on the eastern face of the promontory from the Batinah district of the Sultanate by the Shamailiyah District of Trucial 'Oman. The whole western face belongs to Trucial 'Oman ; but in the heart of the promontory, at or near its base, are the Jau and Mahadhah districts, which are not subject either to the Sultan or to any of the Trucial Shaikhs of 'Oman. The expression ' Gulf of 'Oman ' also requires explanation. In this Gazetteer it is employed, in harmony with general European usage, to denote the arm of the Indian Ocean or Arabian Sea which forms the approach to the Persian Gulf. Its outer limit mav be taken as a line joining Gwatar in Persian Makran to Ras-al-Hadd on the Arabian coast; and at the inner end it may be considered to pass into the Persian Gulf in the neigh bourhood of Ras Musandam. The terms Bahr 'Oman, and Darya-i-'Oman are current locally, but it is not clear that they are consistently used, or that they refer with precision to the sea of which the limits have just been specified. 'OMAN PROPER— The most central district of the 'Oman Sultanate, enclosed by the district of Dhahirah 01 the west, that of Western Hajar on the north, and that of Sharqiyah on the east; on the south it merges in the Ruba'-al-Khali desert. The term 'Oman, now so wide in its application, appears to have belonged originally to this inland plateau, and from it, as was not unnatural, to have spread to the whole principality ; until the removal of the capital to Rustaq, and eventually to the coast, 'Oman Proper was the principal seat of political power as well as the most prosperous and civilised district in 'Oman. Boundaries. —'Oman Proper is enclosed on the north by the lofty range of Jabal Akhdhar and on the west by Jabal-al-Kor and Haddah, off shoots of the Hajar hill sys tem : on the east it is not divided from Sharqiyah by any marked natural feature, unless it be Wadi 'Andam, and similarly on the south there is no perceptible land mark between it and the desert. • Some authorities would carry the geographical Oman so far as to include the Mijan tract which lies imme diately beyond SabSkhat Matti; but the next district on the west, that of 'Aqal, is certainly outside Oman in tnia'OMAN PROPER Hills, —Jabal-al-Kor is a range 20 miles in length, which runs nearly north and south and has peaks about 7,000 feet high. At either extremity it is crossed by a compara tively low pass, on the north by that over the Najd-al-Barak, a col 3,700 feet high which connects it with Jabal Akhdhar; on the south by a pass over the Najd-al-Makhar:m, 2,500 feet high, at the point where Jabal Hamrah joins on to Jabal-al-Kor. Both passes are practicable for camels, but the descent from Najd-al-Makharim on the eastern side lies down a rocky torrent-bed and is not easy for loaded animals. Jabal Hamrah appears to run south-eastwards from Najd-al-Makharim, but its direction and extent have not been investigated by any European traveller; this range is of a terra-cotta colour and may possibly differ in geological structure, as it does in appearance, both from Jabal-al- Kor and Jabal Akhdhar. Valleys. —'Oman Proper possesses two main channels of drainage, Wadi Kalbu, and Wadi Halfain, both of which traverse it from north to south, the former from Nizwa near its centre, the latter from Izki at its eastern extremity. The western part of the district appears to be drained by various Wadis from Jabal-al-Kor which join Wadi Kalbu on its right bank ; one of the principal of these is the wadi on which Bahlah stands, formed by the junction of Wadi Ghol from Najd-al-Barak and a more southern wadi called Wadi Shams, or Shamah. Another is Wadi Saifam containing a village of the same name; it runs south-eastwards from the neighbourhood of Najd-al-Barak, and joins Wadi Kalbu. The subsequent course of Wadi Kalbu is uncertain ; but it is believed to fall into Wadi Halfain in the desert. General configuration, etc. —The surface of 'Oman Proper outside the oases is rough and broken. The central portion, which contains the towns of Bahlah, Nizwa, and Izki but not Manah, is called the Jauf, that is the hollow or basin ; it is a stony plain thickly dotted with small volcanic hills and mounds, some of conical shape. The northern part of it in particular, under Jabal Akhdhar, is very barren and is seamed with dry water courses. A wide and level surface with a gentle declivity to the south separates Izki from Manah, and between Manah and Adam again is a smooth, gently descending ex panse, uninhabited, but sprinkled with dwarf mimosa and bunches of desert grass and containing bustard, partidges, sandgrouse, gazelle and hares. Looking to the south and east from Adam neither hill nor habitation meets the eye, and the line of the horizon is unbroken as the sea; to the north, in the distance, the grand pile of Jabal Akhdhar towers into the sky. At many places in 'Oman Proper the springs are hot, their tem perature ranging from 102 to 112° F.

The whole of Batain from Ras Jibsh to Ras Mishayu is low and sandy except a stretch of a few miles to the north of Shaiblah ; towards the south end it is covered with shrubs and bushes. Masirah island which lies off this part of the coast is described under its own name.1398 'OMAJT The remainder of the coast may be disposed of in six sections 'corresponding to its principal divisions which are Barr-al-Hikman; Ohubbat Hashish; Bahr-al-Hadri, a featureless stretch between Ghubbat Hashish and Has Madrakah; Sauqirah bay between Ras Madrakah and Ras Sauqirah ; a short stretch between Ras Sauqirah and Ras Sharbatat; and, finally, the large bay which contains the Kuria Muria islands. Each of these we now proceed to describe separately. Barr-al- Hikmdn. —Barr-al-Hikman, so called from being the domain of the Hikman tribe, is a blunt promontory, 18 miles broad and only about 12 miles long, which points south between Masirah channel on the east and Ghubbat Hashish on the west. It is low and sandy and contains a large salt-water lagoon called Khor-al-Milh which is divided from the sea only by a narrow ridge of sand ; the Hikman and the inhabitans of Mahot and Masirah island resort to the Khor to fish and to make salt, and Sur boats also load salt here for Sur and India, Barr-al-Hikman is covered with scattered bushes of tamarisk and salsola and with tufts of grass and rushes. The U. S. ship ' Peacock ' was wrecked on this coast in September 1835. The south-western point of Barr-al-Hikman is Ras Zaiwari, a low sandy point situated in Lat. 20° 21' N., Long 58° 16' E. Ghubbat Hashish. —Ghubbat Hashish is a large bay forming the foot of the Gulf ojf Masirah ; it is open to the southward and divides Barr-al-Hikman from the continuation of the coast to the south-westward. The bay is 8 miles wide at the entrace and 10 miles deep, with soundings decreasing regularly from 6 fathoms in the middle of the entrance^ The shore is low, sandy, and desolate throughout. Near the centre of the bay is the small rocky islet of Abb frequented by natives for fish-curing. From Abb a mud-bank which dries at low-water, extends northwards for 3 miles dividing the ba y into two part, and then spreads out eastward and westward across the foot of the bay. On this mud- flat, 4 miles north of Abb, stands the island of Mahot with the village of the same name ; 2 miles west-north-west of Mahot is Raqq, a steep and rocky islet. Thick and sudden fogs are prevalentin the neighbourhood of Ghubbat Hashish during the north-east monsoon. Bahr-al-Hadri. —The section of the coast from Ghubbat Hashish to Ras Jadrakah, called Bahr-al-Hadri, possesses few points of interest. It is distinguished chiefly by the re appearance of hills upon the coast; indeed for more than ^ of its length, towards the southern end, it presents to the sea a line of bold cliffs which are composed of light- coloured limestone. At Ras Sarah, 24 miles south-west of the entrance of Ghubba- Hashish, there is a small village of huts inhabited by the Al Wahibah. At Ras Sidarah again, 20 miles south by west of Ras Sarab, the existence of a small village of Hikman and Al WahTbah with a date-grove has been reported. Six miles south-south-west of Raa Sidarah and 3 or 4 miles off-shore is Hamar-an Nafvir, a white limestone islet 400 yards long, 300 yards broad, and 320 feet high. The summit is flat and split in all directions myriads of wild-fowl frequent it and Arabs used formerly to remove the guano for agri culture. From Hamar-an-Nafur to Ras Madrakah is about 53 miles in a due south direction. When approached from seaward, Ras Madrakah, which is 450 feet high, appears as an island and for this reason, or because of a small island which lies off the point of it, has received the alternative name of Ras Jazirah or Isolette. An outcrop of igneous rock here has greatly disturbed the strata of the prevailing limestone. The coast about Ras Madrakah and for some miles to the northwards is frequented by Janna- bah who have no boats, but put to sea on goat-skin floats and capture sharks, of which they sell the fins and tails. There is good anchorage* in the south-west monsoon about 1 mile north-west of Ras Madrakah in 5| fathoms, and good but slightly brackish water can be obtained from a well on the coast about 2^ miles to the north-eastwards. Sauqirah Bay. —Sauqirah Bay extends from Ras Sauqirah and is about 102 miles in length, but its maximum depth is only about 26 miles. The coast is barren and in habited only by a few Jannabah and Mahras, who come here in the winter months to fish and graze their cattle, and are too poor, apparently, even to construct huts, for they camp under the sails of their boats. They attack helpless strangers and avoid armed ones, are under no human control, and seem to pass their lives in a chronic state of semi- starvation. The best known locality in Sauqirah bay is Jazir near its south-west end, which is a favourite winter camping ground and the only point where the land-route from Dhufar to 'Oman Proper strikes the coast; water can be obtained by digging in the low ground near the sea. Ras Sauqirah is a prominent bluff cape rising 600 feet above the f A plan ol this anchorage will be found in Chart No. 2369-40-0.'OMAN SULTANATE 1399- Eaci tjinij: 1 * sea: connected with it is a rocky table-land which forms a background to the greater part of the bay at some miles from the coast. « t-.- 01, i, +-+ Eas Sauqirah to Eds Sharbatdt^-Ftom Ras Sauqirah to Ras Sharbatat, a distance of 24 miles, the coast presents to the sea a noble lime-stone cliff, 600 feet in height, falling precipitously to the water's edge and having a table-land behind its summit. Eds Sharbatdt to Eds Nvs.—From Ras Sharbatat to Ras Nus again the coast forms a slight bay, 82 miles in extent, which contains the Kuria Muria islands, described else- where under their own name. With a few intervals the coast in this part also consists of cliffs supporting table-land 500 to 800 feet high ; they are throughout of pale-brown lime stone rock except at Ras ShuwSmiyah, about the middle of the bay, where there is a remarkable outburst of igneous rock corresponding doubtless to the Kuria Muna islands which lie opposite it. Ras Qarwao, 6 miles west of Ras Sharbatat, is a headland nearly insulated by a lake at the inner end of which the water is fresh ; a few Jannabah fishermen reside there in caves j and hares, foxes, partridge, plover, duck and widgeon are said to be found near the lagoon. Near the west end of the bay are Wadis Raikhut and Hasik. Wadi Raikhut is a valley opening on the sea 12 miles north of Ras Nus, where there is a spring of fresh and a lake of brackish water ; it appears to be thickly wooded and well watered, is said to come down from the far interior, and shows signs of violent torrent action * Hasik is a miserable village at the mouth of a valley thickly wooded with small trees - 'it is near the head of a bay of the same name three miles south-east of Wadi Raikhut and ten miles north of Ras, Kiis. What was once an inlet of the sea is now a marsh contained by a sand bar, but there is still a well of brackish water. There are considerable ruins here and tradition relates that the place was once a thriving town ; it is said to have been ruined by pirates from the coast of Trucial r Oman, who earned off the women and children into slavery at the beginning of the 19th century. The present inhabitants are some 15 families of various tribes ; they are very poor, subsist alomst entirelv on fish and are nearly destitute of clothing. They have about 300 sheep and goats ; there are no boats, but vessels from Sur call occasionally. There are cocoanuts here and a few dates. . s „ a Inhabitants —As will have been observed, there are no places of any importance except Lashkarah and Mahot, on the whole south-eastern coast of 'Oman. Such villages aa exist are mostly small and fluctuating, inhabited by migratory fisher-folk who dispose of shark-fins to passing vessels and obtain in exchange the dates, grain and cloth of which thev stand in need. Many of these fishermen have no boats, and between Ras-ar-Ruwais and Hasik they commonly put to sea on a float made of a goat or sheep-skin ; after this has been inflated they tie the hind and forelegs together with string and sitting on the string with the skin in front of them paddle their way with their hands to the fishing ground. As many as twenty men have been seen to enter the water at once in this manner and proceed two miles out to sea. ,,, n , Exclusive of places belonging to the Ja'alan district the settled population of the south eastern coast of 'Oman is extremely small in proportion to its extent. An estimate gives only 1,500 souls, distributed as follows:— , . . A , ... Ras Jibsh to Mishayu, 60 families ; Mahot, 50 families; Bahr-al-Hadn, 40 families ; Ras 'Sharbatat to Ras Nus, 30 families ; and Nasirah island, 120 families. The Bedouins of the district, whose number is uncertain, are chiefly Jannabah, A1 Wahibah, and 'Awamir. 0M The Suhanate of 'Oman is not, as explained in the article on 'Oman, co-extensive with 'Oman in the geographical sense ; for Trucial 'Oman, the Baraimi Oasis and the Ma- hadhah tract, though they belong to 'Oman, are not included among the Sultan s pos sessions. On the other hand the Gwadar District on the coast of Baluchistan and the Dhufar District on the southern coast of Arabia are under the Sultan's govemmenb and form part of his Sultanate. In the present article, except in the general paragraphs on administration, etc., the district of Gwadar, which is fully dealt with elsewhere under its own name, will be left out of consideration, and our attention will be con fined to the Sultan's Arabian possessions. _ Boundaries.—The dominions of the Sultan of 'Oman, if taken as comprising not only regions under his direct government but also independent or semi-independent localities where his influence is strong er than that of any other recognised authority, extend along ' A. sketch of the mouth of this valley will be found in Admiralty Chart No.. 11. ' ■WOO 'OMAN SULTANATE the coast of Arabia from the entrance of the Persian Gulf to the neighbourhood of Ras bajar opposite Saqotrah, and inland as far as the confines of the Ruba'-al-Khali or Great Desert. More precisely, the extreme points on the coast are the village of Tibat in Kuus-al-Jibal, on the western face of the promontory that divides the Persian Gulf from the Gulf of 'Oman, and the village of Kharifot, in the Dhufar District. It should, however be noted that the boundary between the political jurisdictions of Masqat and Aden is Ras Sajar, The Dhufar District is reckoned to the Sultanate of Oman, and therefore the boundary between the latter and Hadhramaut has been considered to be immediately to the west of the village of Kharifot. Between these the Sultan s territory is continuous but for a strip of coast-line which extendmg from Dibah to Khor Kalbaon the east side of the'Oman Promontory, belongs' to the Shaikh of Sharjah and is consequently part of Trucial 'Oman. The Sultan's land frontier on the side towards Baraimi may, to the northwards of the Great Desert be placed at the watershed between that place and the coast of the Gulf of 'Oman' Divisions. The country is not regularly parcelled out into administrative districts', but it falls naturally into several distinct tracts which have recognised names. , „ . c , h , ief Physical feature is a range of mountains or hilly tract which, commencing at Ras Musandam, the entrance of the Persian Gulf, sweeps round in a curve parallel to the coast to terminate in the vicinity of Ras-al-Hadd, the point which divides the 11 0 - ma ? T fr ° I ? ^ Indian 0cean - From R5s Musandam to Dibah this tract is called Ruus-al-Jibal; the remainder is known as the Hajar of 'Oman. Hajar attains its maximum altitude of nearly 10,000 feet in Jabal Akhdhar, a group of lofty mountains to the south-west of Masqat Town, and immediately beyond Jabal Akhdhar it is cut ™- ^ t 0 ! ) u Samai1 ' whlcl1 thus divides it into Western and Eastern Hajar, Ruus-al-Jibal and the two parts of Hajar in themselves constitute three territorial divisions ; and between Western Hajar and the sea is enclosed a long and narrow but populous maritime district, known as Batinah. From Western Hajar a number of valleys descend across Batinah to the sea, most of which are thickly inhabited in their ImmediateI y east of ^Vadi Samail the mountains of Hajar reach down h JI i fv!

Springs and streams abound in the hilly districts of Ja'alan; but in Batinah the supply of water depends entirely on wells, and wells are found to some extent in 'Oman Proper and Sharqtyah. Many of the springs of 'Oman have a high temperature. The two largest valleys of 'Oman are Wadi Samail and Wadi Halfain which rise on opposite sides of the same pass. Wadi Samail reaches the Gulf of 'Oman at Sib; it is a main seat of population and date culture and the chief highway between coast and interior. The course of Wadi Halfain is southwards ; it carries the drainage of all tho inland districts except Dhahirah to the Indian Ocean at Mahot and is the longest valley in all 'Oman. Climate.—The summer climate of Oman is intensely hot, and Masqat is said to be one of the hottest towns in the world, but it cannot be said to be unhealthy. During 1912 the highest temperature recorded was 114° Fahr. and the lowest 64° Fahr: in 1913 the highest temperature was 110° Fahr. and the lowest 69°. The high temperatures are due to the hot winds, which at certain times in the summer months, and generally only for a few hours at night, blow from the Arabian deserts and barren rocks round Masqat. For the greater part of the summer owing to the high state of humidity, of the atmos phere in combination with a hightemperature, the climate is very trying. From Xovem- ber to the middle of March the weather is distinctly pleasant, but fails to be bracing as the temperature seldom falls below 60° Fahr. As at Masqat, the climate'of the sea-coast generally, owing o its humidity, is relaxing and oppressive except in the coldest months. The Batinah is much cooler in summer, especially at night, than the rocky coastal tract of it in which Masqat lies ; the months of May, June, and July are healthy there, but fever begins with the date harvest. Many of the towns and districts at some elevation on the coastal side of the Hajar watershed while open to the sea -breeze, are shut off by the range from the hot desert winds, and enjoy a fresh and temperate climate. In the interior the summer heat is oppressive, but in winter cold and wet weather is sometimes encountered. The ordinary rainfall in'Oman varies between 3 and 6 inches, but occasionally violent storms accompanied by floods devastate the country; on the 4th and 5th of Juno 1890, during a cyclone, it rained continuously for twenty-four hours, during which 11^ in. fell. The rainfall at Masqat averages 4 inches only, and it fe due to this fact that the place may be considered a fairly healthy tropical port, provided ordinary precautions are taken to purify the drinking water by boiling or filtration, and to protect oneself from mosquitoes, which are numerous in the town during the winter months and cause a considerable amount of malaria among the natives. In 1912 and 1913 there were no cases of cholera or plague ; in the latter year small-pox occurred at Matrah, Sidab, and to a less extent at Masqat, and there were six cases of blackwater fever of, which two were fatal. Wild flora and fauna.— The natural vegetation of the country is sparse and stunted and wood of large growth is not found even in the highest hills. Mimosa, acacia, tama risk and ber are among the commonest trees. Grass is not abundant. Fauna are correspondingly poor. The wild mammals of the country include the Masqat gazelle or Dhabi, common all over 'Oman in suitable localities; the Marica gazelle or Rim, which is rare except on the edge of the Ruba'-al-Khali; the Beatrix oryx or Bansolah, which is brought in by nomads from the desert; Jayakar's wild goat, a kind of Tahr—in Arabic called Wa'al; also a lynx of which the species is doubtful. There are besides hares, jackals and foxes ; the existence of leopards has not been established. Among the birds are the bustard {Houbara Macqueeni), grey partridge, francolin, sisi, sandgrouse and quail. Agricultural prodt/ds.—-Cultivated trees and crops are more plentiful and varied than vegetation of natural growth. The principal tree and staple of agriculture is the date, of which some very fine varieties are grown ; it flourishes everywhere, even in almost inaccessible valleys among the hills and at a height of over 2,000 feet; the extensive date plantations are a striking feature of the landscape, especially in Batinah, Wadi Samail and Sharqiyah. 'Other fruit trees more or less common are the plantain, mango, pome granate, quince, sweet and bitter lime, olive and almond; and the walnut, fig, vine, and mulberry flourish in Jabal Akhdhar. Cereals are wheat, barley, maize, millet, and C52(w)GSB1402 'OMlN SULTANATE bajri; other crops are must melons, water melons, lucerne, cotton, suearcanc , . places, indigo and tobacco. aric '. in Domestic animals. —Camels are numerous in Sharqlyah and Batinah and a in Ha jar and elsewhere, but horses are everywhere few. The dromedaries ? are esteemed the best in Arabia. Cattle, sheep, and goats are found ev the sheep being most common in the hilly tracts and in the possession of u' Jess numerous than the goats.

Non-Arab population.—The Arabs compose seven -eighths or more of the popula- lation • the residue consists partly of aboriginal tribes and partly of immigrants whose arrival was later than that of the Arabs. Among the aborigines may perhaps' be classed the Bani Ka'ab, part of the Shihuh, the Zatut and possibly some of the Baya- sirah. The later immigrants are represented by colonies of Persians,—in part relics of Persian occupations,—in the neighbourhood of Sohar and elsewhere; by Baluchis and Jadgals, the former now very numerous, who were originally introduced aa mercenary troops ; and by considerable Indian communities in the towns of Masqat and Matrah. Nor must the large negro element which exists along the coast be over looked, an outcome of several centuries of the slave-trade. Character and language. —The chief characteristics of the people of 'Oman are impatience of control, strong factional and tribal feeling, unprogressiveness in the social and material aspects of life. Their settlements in East Africa however show them to have been, in the past, not devoid of enterprise of a kind. Arabic is the language of the country as a whole, but the dialect of the Shihuh is peculiar, and the Kumazirah section of that tribe have in addition a language of their own which belongs to the Iranian group. Baluchi may be heard in Oman among the Baluchis and Swahili where negroes are numerous. The Qaras of Dhufar have a language of their own. , , Classification and distribution by factions and tribes. —The following is a conspectus of the tribes of the Sultanate of 'Oman, arranged under the heads of Ghafiri and Hinawi :— Tribe, Singular.

We may therefore conclude that the total population of the 'Oman Sultanate is not less than 600,000 souls, of whom at least 30,000 are Bedouins. Occupations and mode of life. —The greater part of the fixed population of 'Oman live by agriculture, of which date cultivation is the commonest form. Cultivation, whether of date trees or of other crops, is dependent on irrigation. In the hills and where springs exist the water is brought to the field by a carefully constructed channel, sometimes subteranean and in that case called a Falaj: an open channel is called Saqlyah. Where irrigation is from wells, as in Batinah, the water is raised in leathern hoists, as in some parts of India. On the sea-coast agriculture is supplemented or replaced by fishery, and inland by the keeping of flocks and herds. In Batinah, where the fisheries are important, the nets are sometimes a mile long and form the principal possession of the village. The fishermen of 'Oman ply their business along the coast of Makran at certan seasons. The livelihood of the inhabitants of Masqat and Matrah is exceptional, depending Upon the presence of the Sultan's government and on foreign commerce : Stir and Khabu- rah also are ports of which sea-borne trade is the mainstay. In some of the larger inland towns part of the population live by retail trade or by simple industries and manufactures: such are indigo dyeing at Nizwa and 'Ibri, copper and brasswork to an insignificant extent at Kizwa, pottery at Nakhl, and the weaving of cloth, turbans and lungis in other places. Masqat Town is renowned for its gold and silver work, especially the sheaths and mounting of daggers and swords; the workmen are Indians. Local trade and trade between the coast and the interior maintain a carrier class; Maqniyat in Dhahirah, for instance, is a place which subsists largely by the earnings of the donkey and camel owners. The Bedouins are altogether pastoral in their habits, depending for a livelihood on their camels and flocks. In hilly districts and their vicinity the houses are generally of stone and mud, but in some of the SharquTyah towns, as also in Masqat and Matrah, the better houses are of1422 'OMAN SULTANATE stone plastered with gpysum stucco. Where stone is not easily obtainable suri dried brick often takes its place ; but throughout Batinah and in part of Sharq'yah light sheds of date branches and mats are the commonest form of domestic architecture. Beef is little eaten by the people, and fish is an important article of diet even in the interior. Tridt. —The trade of 'Oman, which is described in full detail in the article on Masqat Town, is chiefly with India ; and its character is by no means complicated. The only valuable export is dates, of which the better sorts go to America and most of the remainder to India. The Fard date, a small dark-coloured sort grown in the Samail valley, enjoys high favour in America and the supply of it is never equal to the demand of the market; the Americans have lately been endeavouring to acclimatise it in Arizona, but as yet without much success. Another date called Mibsali, preferred by natives of Oman to the Fard date and much appreciated in India, is grown in Sharqiyah and exported through Sur to Bombay ; a third kind is the Khalas. Exports of secondary importance are pearls, mother-of-pearl, dried limes, fresh fruit and salt fish, all of which which go chiefy to India. By far the most valuable import received in return for these exports is rice from India, and after rice come arms and ammunition, consigned direct from Europe ; but this is not unlikely to prove on ephemeral traffic, for the arms market in 'Oman itself is said to be already glutted and the extinction of the arms trade through Masqat with other countries is an object of the British Government. Next are cotton goods, Indian, Manchester and American, mostly (except the American) imported through Bombay. The American cotton is a time-honoured import which shows no sign of increasing at the expense of the other kinds. Twist andy am, silk and silk goods, sugar, coffee, and cereals other than rice are the chief remaining imports. Timber, except date trunks, is all brought from India and Africa. The foreign trade is largely in the hands of- Indian merchants resident at Masqat and Matrah—-the latter being the real commercial capital— but there are also some wealthy Arab merchants. The total value of the imports at Masqat was £401,320 in 1911-12, £463,551 in 1912-13, and £407, 768 in 1913-14. It should be noted that the imports for 1912-13 included an item of over £180,000 for arms and ammunition, imported mainly during the seven months from April to the end of October. By the latter date the warehouse regulations (see p. ) had begun seriously to affect the traffic, and in 1913-14 the year's imports under the same head amounted only to £13,500. The total value of exports was £ 290,387 in 1911-12, £301,477 in 1912-13, and £271,536 in 1913-14. The decrease in the last year referred to, as compared with 1912-13, was entirely due to less export of specie. Muscat's trade with the interior has of course been entirely dislocated since the rising of the tribes men in 1913 (see p. ), and their capture of the Semail valley. The British Indian Company, who have the contract for mails from and to India, provide a weekly fast mail service, and also a weekly slow coasting service, between Bombay and Basra, and the vessels call at Masqat both ways. The vessels of the Arab Steamers, Ltd., maintain an irregular service between Bombay and Basra calling at Masqat; and during normal times vessels of the Bucknall Steamship Co., the Strick Line, and the West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co. from Ixmdon, the Compagnie Russe de Navigation a Vapsur et de Commerce from Odessa, and the Hamburg-America Line from Hamburg call at Muscat. The trade of Oman is limited, not so much by insecurity, bad communications and the difficulty of recovering debts in the interior, though these are not without their effect, as by the natural poverty of the country and the limited purchasing power of the inhabit ants. The only valuable asset is the date crop, which is liable to be severely affected by draught. The carrying trade of 'Oman is small and practically confined to Sur ; the only other ports of any account are Wudam and Sur Haiyan in Batinah with about 15 and 40 sea-going vessels, respectively, Suwaiq with 10, and Matrah without about 7. Weights and measures vary somewhat from place to place.* The standard of currency every where is the Maria Theresa dollar or Riyal, but the Indian rupee also circulates. Accounts are kept in Muhammadis, an imaginary unit of which 11.1 are equal to one dollar. Subsidiary coinage consists of copper pice, partly imported from India, Zanzibar, and Ger- f . l^hl 0 ! 6 0n k 'ST* 7T' n i.

During 1904, the value of 100 dollars fluctuated between 126 and 139 rupees and the num- of ber copper Masqat pice to the dollar varied from 220 to 270. In 1906-07 the dollar exchange fluctuated between 1511 and 176 J. This instability of the silver exchange occasions many shipments of specie between Masqat and Bombay and is unfavourable to general trade. Communications. —'See Routes in Arabia, 1915. Navigation and harbours. —The navigation of the'Oman coasts is simple, and hidden dangers are few ; but there is an almost entire deficiency of harbours and safe anchorag es. The Elphinstone (Khor-ash-Sham) and Malcolm (Ghubbat Ghazirah) Inlets and Dohat Haffah in Ruus-al-Jibal would make good harbours, but their position in a wild and barren district renders them commercially valueless. There is not a single shelt ered anchorage for vessels On the whole B&amp;tinah coast. The coast of the Masqat District possesses the best anchorages in 'Oman, viz., the bays of Matrah and Masqat and the inlets of Bandar Jissah and Bandar Khairan ; but the first two are imperfectly sheltered, and the others are badly situated with regard to internal communications. From Bandar Khairan south-eastwards there is no sheltered anchorage till the Sur, Khor Jaramah and Khor-al-Hajar creeks are reached near Ras-al-Hadd ; the first and third of these are only accessible to native 'boats, and the second, though well sheltered, cannot be entered by vessels of more than 15 feet draft. The south-eastern coast of 'Oman is poor in good anchorages ; indeed, excluding Ghubbat Hashish, the approaches to which are not free from danger, and an indifferent anchorage at Ras Madrakah, there are none until the complementary harbours of Murbat and Risut in the Dhufar District are reach ed. Political constitution. —The Government of 'Oman is a Sultanate or absolute monarchy and the manner in which the present hereditary Sultanate has arisen out of an ancient elective Imamate will appear from the chapter on the history of 'Oman in the first volume of this Gazetteer. The title of Imam is inapplicable to the present ruler, who has never qualified for the semi-religious dignity of the Imamate, and he is commonly men tioned as the Saiyid. The term is not free from ambiguity however, for each member of the ruling family is also a Saiyid, though not the Saiyid, and the term Sultan, though possibly a British invention,* appears to be coming into the general use in the capital and its vicinity. General administration. —The Government of 'Oman is without system or efficiency, and outside the districts of Masqat and Batinah the Sultan's authority is either precarious or merely nominal. The Sultan is represented at a number of points by executive officials styled Walis, who exercise their powers, according to the will of their master, to the extent which the means at their disposal permit; and there are, at some less important places, minor civil or military officials who receive their orders from the Wali nearest them. The town of Masqat is ruled by the Sultan personally, but at Matrah there is a Wali, the only official of that rank in the Masqat or head-quarters district. In Batinah there are Walis at Sib, Barkah, Masna'h, Suwaiq, Khaburah and Sohar; and the Wali of Sohar, whose charge is in some respects the most highly organised in the Sultanate, is assisted by Deputy-Walis at Saham, Liwa and Shinas, each of whom is responsible for a defined district and for certain specified villages. In the Hajar hills the Sultan has Walis at Nakhl and Hisn Samail and outposts in charge of minor officials at 'Awabi, Bidbid, Mizahit, Hibi, Haiyadh, and Durj-ash-Shikairi; the last three are subject to the Wali of Sohar and the others to the Wali of Samail. In the Rustaq portion of Western Hajar there exists what is practically an imperium in imperio, held by a distant relation of the Sultan over whom he has no real control. On the coast of Eastern Hajar there are Walis at Quryat and Sur and a post at Hadd under the Wali of Sur ; but the position of the Sur Wali is extremely difficult, and at present he is to a large extent merely a spec tator of events (1905). 'Araqi, close to 'Ibri, is the seat of a Wali and the Sultan's only post in Dhahirah. In 'Oman Proper the Sultan has Walis at Izki and Nizwa besides a post a Manah under the Wali of Nizwa, but his position in this district is insecure and im plies no real control. * If British, it may have had its rise in a misapprehension, the personal name of the ruler at the time of the first two treaties between Masqat and the East India Company havinp: been Saiyid Sultan. It is noteworthy that on the pice minted by Faisal-btn-Turki, or to his order, he is variously described as ' Imam of Masqat and 'Oman, ' Sultan of Masqat and 'Oman ' and ' Sultan of 'Oman.'1424 'OMlN SULTANATE In the detached district of Ruus-al-Jibal, where his authority ia recognised rather than felt, the Sultan has a Wali at Khasab ; and in the still more remote district of Dhufar, where Masqat rule is tolerated by the inhabitants rather than actively enforced by the Sultan, His Highness is represented at the present time by a substitute W ali with his headquarters at Hisn, by a garrison at Murbat and by small detachments in other places. In Sharqiyah and Ja'alan the Sultan has no official agents of any sort, and, though the Shaikhs profess allegiance to the Sultan of 'Oman, their attitude towards the present ruler makes it impossible to regard them otherwise than as semi-independent. The south-eastern coast of 'Oman between Ja'alan and Dhufar is valueless and its existence is ignored in the Sultan's administrative arrangements. Gwadar is a Waliship, and in the town and its environs the authority of the Wali ia complete. Further particulars about the Sultan's posts are given in the paragraph on military forces below. Criminal and Civil Justice. —Criminal justice is dispensed in the name of the Sultan only in places which fall within the jurisdiction of his Wfilis., The most heinous cases, as of murder or extreme personal violence, are, if the culprit can be arrested, sent to the Sultan for disposal along with the witnesses of the crime ; and a person convicted by the Sultan of murder is frequently put to death by the same means as he employed to destroy his victim. Minor offences are tried by the Walis who are supposed to report their decisions to the SultSn : in these reparation to the person injured is usually exacted or, failing reparation, a term of imprisonment is awarded. The procedure is on the whole In accordance with Muhammadan law, but the requirements of the Quran are not always strictly complied with. Outside the jurisdictions of the Walis there is no justice apart from the settlements which local Shaikhs are able and inclined to arrange on the basis of Arab customs of compensation and retaliation. Tribesmen are never surrendered to the Sultan by the tribal authorities as criminals for punishment. Questions of civil right are adjudicated on by Qadhis in the same manner as in other Muhammadan countries. Finances —The sea customs, here called 'Ushur, are the principal source of revenue in the Sultanate of 'OmSn; import duty is levied on all goods at the rate of 5 per cent. ttd valorem, the maximum permitted by treaty. At all principal ports the customs are now under direct management instead of being farmed, as formerly ; payment of duty is accepted either in cash or in kind, and in the latter case the goods taken are generally sold by auction. Subsidiary sources of income are the Zakat and Bait-al-Mal; but these terms, unless in the interior, are not employed in the strict Quranic sense. At places on the coast Zakat, instead of signifying the impost authorised by Muhammadan law on agricultural produce and moveable property, denotes a virtual export duty which, though not fixed by treaty^ is permitted by the British Government to be taken at the rate of 5 per cent. ad valorem in lieu of Zakat proper; this concession has been made on account of the inability of the Sultan to collect the Zakat in the up-country localities where it becomes due. On the seaboard Bait-al-Mal means not the public revenue from all sources, but the rent of shops and other property owned by the State. It will be seen from the table given in the next paragraph, which is based upon in quiries made in 1906-07, that import duties and real and so-called Zakat produce to gether a gross revenue of $429,000, but that of this amount only $290,700 or about Rs. 4,00,000 actually reaches the central treasury at Masqat; the remainder is absorbed in administrative expenditure at the places where the collections are made. The Bait-al-Mal brings in about $500 a year at Masqat Town and $750 at Matrah and the total proceeds of this tax are thus about Rs. 1,750. ' revenues of 'Oman the Sultan receives from the British Government a subsidy of which the origin is explained in the history of 'Oman; its amount is at present Rs. 7,200 per mensem.'OMAN SULTANATE The net annual public incoiiw of'Oman from all sources is thus about— Rs. .. 4,00,000 1425 from customs and Zakat from Bait-al-Mal from the British subsidy or R&amp; 1,750 86,4*00 4,88,150 As we shall presently see, this is supplemented to a slight extent out of the Sultan's private estate, , ,. , ., , v. The expenditure of the Sultan is even more difficult to estimate than his revenue ; it is certain however that his normal position is one of financial embarrassment His personal expenses are small, but large sums are spent m placating discontented tribes of the interior and in supporting a multitude of parasites in his entourage ; consequently he finds it difficult to make both ends meet. The Sultan is m the habit of forestalling his customs receipts by overdrawing on his customs officials, who are thus compelled to obtain advances from local merchants in anticipation of duty payable in the future.

The total strength of the Sultan's forces is thus considerable ; but the detachmentB are so small and dispersed that his army, if such it can be called, is everywhere powerless for aggressive action. When an effort that is more than merely defensive is required it can only be arranged by subsidising tribal levies, a method which experience has shown to be as ineffectual as it is expensive. The Sultan's soldiers or 'Askaris are partly foreign mercenaries ; about 25 per cent, are Hadhramautis and 6 per cent. Baluchis, and these are the most reliable part of his force ; but in some districts, as in Dhufar, they are altogether locally recruited and are consequently not to be depended on. The Askaris are without training and have no organisation unless by sections of about 20• . —. , i- 'OMAN SULTANATE 1427 Hi I I fl E 1 E E E 1 SiL tnen, each of which is supposed to be commanded by a sort of non-commissioned officer called an 'Aqid. Every regular fort is in charge of a military commandant called a Jama'dar. In the more important stations the 'Askarisare armed with breech- loading rifles. The Sultan has a number of old muzzle-loading gun, but not more than one or two of these are capable of being moved. The once considerable navy of 'Oman is now represented by a single steam yacht, the ' Nur -al-Bahr,' of 300 tons, mounting one 9-pr. R.M.L. gun and one five-barrelled Nordenfelt of '45 calibre. The ruling family.* —The descendants of Ahmad-bin-Sa'id, the founder of the ruling family, are now too numerous,—many of them being also obscure,—to permit of a complete genealogical table being drawn up ; but in the space given to 'Oman in the third volume of this Gazetteer will be found a table including all or most of those who retain any importance at the present time.

The Sultan possesses country-houses at Bait-al-Falaj and Wataiyah in the Masqat District and at Falaij in Batinah. Foreign interests. —-Foreign interests in the 'Oman Sultanate, whether political or commercial, are predominantly British, and Britain is the only power represented by a Consul or Political Agent. In normal times France and the United States are each represented by a Vice-Consul. The only European firm at Masqat is British, as are also most of the European firms .which have agencies there. There are at Masqat 12 European Briti -h subjects, also 32 British subjects or protecte- ed persons belonging to various races ; and 2 of the last are found also at Matrah. Other British subjects or protected persons are either Hindus or Muhammadans, in the second ease generally Khdjahs, and are distributed as follows .— Place Hindus. Muham- Place Hindus.

R ecent H istory and P resent Por.mcs. Our treaty relations with Masqat began as early as 1798, and foreign interests, whether political or commercial, are predominantly British. Since 1891 the Sultan has been under a binding agreement with the Indian Government, and he receives a large annual subsidy, as well as a guarantee of protection, on condition of his observing it. The most important of its terms are that he shall alienate no part of his territory except to the British, that he shall direct his policy in conformity with ours, and that he shall accept no help, pecuniary or other, from any other foreign power. The reigning; Suitan of Oman, Saiyid Taimur ibn Faisal, the eldest son of his prede cessor, succeeded on October 4th, 1913, at the age of 27, and was recognized by the British and French Governments on November 1915 of that year. He found his realm in a bad state. In 1895 his father, Saiyid Sir Faisal-bin-Turkey, G.C.I.E., had already experienced a formidable rising of the Hinawi tribesmen, when the rebels actually penetrated into Masqat, and drove him from his palace to take refuge in the eastern fort. At the time of his death he was faced by another serious rebellion with which his son has had to cope. His reign may be said to have marked the rise of the arms traffic, which during the last few years overshadowed all other questions at Masqat, and more than once imperilled the friendly relations between his State and the British Government. For Masqat became, not only a local centre cf supply of arms and ammunition for 'Oman, but large consignments were re-exported thence to the Persian Coast and Afghanistan. A blockade of the Makran Coast, which was instituted by the British Government in 1909, paralysed for a time the export trade. Several large captures were made, and the practice of carrying small consignments was stopped by the burning of dhows which were proved to have carried them. More stringent measures became neces sary in 1912, when, after a preliminary proclamaiion in June of that year, an Arms Warehouse was established at Masqat, through which all traffic in arms and ammunition, whether for import or export, must be cont nued under direct government control From the date of the opening of the Warehouse on September 1st, the port of Masqat rapidly ceased to be a distributing centre. To a certain extent its place was taken by a number of smaller depots, scattered chiefly among the 'Oman hills and along the-• 'OMAN 1429 Balrinali coast, for sea-going steamers continued to smuggle arms in amongst bales of merchandise at various ports of call. But after making all allowances, it would seem that as a result of the Arms Warehouse, barelv a tenth of the former infiltration of arms and 'ammunition reached the inhabitants. Moreover, in October 1913, the deportation of the notorious Baltt hi arms trader' Ali Musa Khan, and his banishment .or five years, served to inspire all ann» traders with a wholesome respect for the State Warehouse and its regulations. , . c In May 1913 the rising of the 'Oman tribes, which had been threatening .or a year past, began to a sume serious proportions under the leadingship of the so-called Imam o Tanuf, Balim-ibn-Rashid-al-Kharusi. The rising was due to the preaching of the prin cipal Ibadhi Shaikh, 'Abdullah -ibn-Hamaid-as-Salimi, who inflamed any feeling of dis content at the establishment of the Arms Warehouse, and proclaimed his son-in-law, Salim-ibn-Rashid, as 'Imam of the Muslimin. The rebellion spread rapidly, Nizwa falling about the middle of June, followed by Izki and Awabi in the course of the month. In Julv a bodv of Indian troops was landed at Matrah and they occupied Bait-al-l ala], a hamlet nearthat port, with a picket posted on Ruwi village At the beginning of August the forts of Bidbid and Sama'il passed into the hands of the rebels ; and, as a projected attack on Masqat was rumoured, the garrison at Bait-al-Falaj was doubled in September. But nothing came of the attack at that time, and the new Sultan, after his accession, entered into negotiations with the Hinawi tribes and arranged a tempo- rarv truce. . , i . .i • a • „ i Throughout the vear 1914 the Imam continued to give trouble in the interior and made preparations'for a renewed attack. A bombardment of the ports of Barkah and Quryat in April of that year had a tranquillizing effect upon the coast; but, as a means of precaution, Indian reinforcements were sent to Masqat in November, By the end ot the vear the tribes had gathered, and in January 1915 the threatened attack took place, when a force of Arabs, estimated at 3,000, attacked the British outpost line but met with a crushing defeat. This success relieved the situation, though the rebel party still dominates the interior. Meanwhile, the Warehouse has worked well, and io importation of arms and ammunition has ceased. '.OMAN (TRUCIAL)— Uniformity of physical, social and political conditions throughout that part of Oman which extends from the frontier of the 'Oman Sultanate on the east to Qatar and the ,Ta ? urah desert on the west requires that the region should be treated as a geographical ^The name Tracial 'Oman.—The region in question consists of the actual possessions of the Shaikhs of 'Ajman, Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Umm-al-Qaiwain and Sharjah and of the territories of the tribes who, in fact or in theory, are directly subject to their influence but in Arabic it has no general name. Among the subjects of the Oman Sultanate the whole is known as Sham al, either on account of its position with reference to their o\\n country or because of its exposure to the north-west wind ; and in Eastern Arabia, further to the northward, the part adjoining Abu Dhabi Town seems to be spoken of as 'Oman-ash-Shamali because it is the northernmost part of 'Oman ; but neither of these terms is in common use among the inhabitants of the regions which they used to des cribe. The nearest approach to a recognised general designation is apparently Sahil 'Oman or Coast of 'Oman ; but this expression, though not unknown to the people of the country, is wanting in precision and distinctiveness and is far from bemg universally understood. In English official literature a part of the shore line has long been familiar under the name of ' The Pirate Coastbut the term is not sufficiently comprehensive, and, at the present day, is obsolete and even misleading, inasmuch as the state of affairs which it once accurately connoted has long since passed away. Regard bemg had to a perpetual maritime truce which regulates the relations of the rulers to one another and to the British Government the pentarchy in question maybe styled, not inappropriate ly, Trucial 'Oman ; but it must be remembered that the trucial obligations of the Shaikhs do not extend to the interior of their dominions. The component principalittes of Trucial 'Oman are fully described elsewhere under their own names ; and the function of the present article is accordingly to correlate them, to describe the country and its inhabitants as a whole, and to dispose of certain matters (such as communicat : ons) which could not be dealt with piecemeal under the names of the separate principalities.I42G miAN Limits. —Upon the coast, Trucial 'Oman extends in the Gulf of 'Oman from Khor Kalba to Dibah, and in the Persian Gulf, from Sha'am to Khor-al-'Odaid, the places named being all included in it; in other words, its boundary between these two sets of points is the sea. Inland, its frontiers are more difficult to define; but it covers a consider able portion of the interior of the'Oman Promontory. On one side there it is bound- ed by a line of uncertain course which runs from a spot between the contiguous villages ol Dibah and P&gt;ai'ah on the east coast to Ras Sha'am on the west coast, and so divides it from the Ruus-al-Tibal district of the 'Oman Sultanate to the north ; on another by a line, even more indeterminate, which leaves the Gulf between Khor Kalba and Murair and, after partially crossing the promontory in such a way as to exclude the Mahadhah and Jau districts to the south, is eventually lost in Khatam. Westwards of Khatam the inland limit of Trucial 'Oman is at the commencement of the Ruba-'al-Khali and Jafurah deserts. Physical Leaving out of consideration for the present the artifical political divisions of Trucial 'Oman, we find that it consists of a maritime belt (or Taff) and islands • of inland plains ; and of a mountain system ; these we now proceed to describe. Maritime features and islands of Trucial 'Oman.—The eastern coast—that washed by the Gulf of 'Oman—is bold, somewhat resembling the coast of Ruus-al-Jibal, and the hills in places come down to the water's edge. The western coast—that within the Persian Gulf— is low and monotonous. In the north the latter is diversified # by occa- sional date groves, especially by those of the Sir tract between Rams and Ras-al-Khai- mah Town, but as the coast trends away to south and west trees languish, and at Abu Dhabi they cease altogether. The hills, too, which near Ras-al-Khaimah Town form a pleasing, background, rapidlv recede inland and are soon lost to view from seaward as the coast is followed to the south-west. Salt-water creeks abound on this coast, and the lagoons at Ras-al-Khaimah Town and near the town of Abu Dhabi have a considerable superficies ; yet there are no inlets of real importance. The creeks sometimes unite inland to form backwaters and mangrove swamps, which are separated by a short distance only from the cost; and quasi-islands, sometimes inhabited and sometimes not are created in this manner. The best known instances of such islands are Qurmah between Rams and Ras-al-Khaimah ; Jazirat-al-Hamra ; the Siniyah island, formed by Khor-al-Baidhah near Umm-al-Qaiwain ; Zora ; the not altogether insulated site common to the village of Khan and to the Laiyah suburb of Sharjah Town ; and, last but not least, the tract of country in which stands the town of Abu Dhabi. Beyond Abu Dhabi, as far as Khor-al- Odaid, the coast is almost unknown ; it is barren and generally low, but has some bluff headlands. The only eminence and conspicuous landmark on the coast of Trucial 'Oman, Dhafrah being excluded, is Jabal-al-'Ali in Dibai territory. In the Gulf of 'Oman the sea is deep at no great distance from shore. In the Persian Gulf, from Sha am to Abu Dhabi it is open and free from dangers but rather shallow; here the coast lies open to the full fury of the Shamal, there are no harbours or sheltered anchorages except for boats, and landing is often difficult. From Abu Dhabi to Khor-al- 'Odaid the coast is adjoined by a labyrinth of islands, shoals and reefs, imperfectly surveyed and so intricate that even Arab vessels, if larger than pearl boats, avoid these waters. In this direction most of the space between the coast and the 20 fathom line, —which runs approximately from opposite Sharjah Town to the tip of the Qatar peninsula, is occupied by pearl banks. Full details of these banks are given in the Appendix on the Pearl Fisheries. A number of islands are associated with the coast of Trueial 'Oman, the most import ant being Bu Musa, Tunb, Sir Bu Na'air, Yus and Dalmah ; the last of these is adjoined by a number ot others which are enumerated in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality, and by Shura awah. Inland plain of Trucial 'Oman.-The interior of a country so extensive naturally varies in character from one part to another, but, attention being for the moment confined to the non-mountamous portions, the variations are found to be less considerable than might have been expected. Almost the whole consists of sandy desert; uncultivable but not altogether destitute of natural vegetation or even of wood ; the principal exceptions to the general infertility are the Jin plain, the plain of Dhaid and the Liwah division of the Dhafrah tract, in aU of which some cultivation, at least of dates, is carried on. These relatively small districts are fully described in the articles under the names indicated,'OMlN 1431 and it is unnecessary to enter here upon the exceptional features which they present. Another tract of a different nature, which has no general name and which it is conse quently impossible to make the subject of an article, is described below in the para graph on the topography of Trucial 'Oman. The only remaining portion of the country is that which lies between the sea and an imaginary line joining Ras-al-Khaimah Town to the Baraimi Oasis : it ends southwards in the district of Khatam which is elsewhere described under its own name. So far as can be ascertained, this portion, from Ras-al- Khaimah as far south as Dibai Town, is not entirely composed of sand dunes but con tains also level shingly plains with sparse acacia vegetation ; southwards from Dibai the whole surface appears to be sandy and undulating, but desert vegetation and wella and water holes are still sufficiently plentiful to support a scanty Bedouin population. In the whole of this region no running water is found except in one subterranean aqueduct which irrigates the settlement of Falai; but there are numerous wells, sunk generally on the banks or in the beds of dry watercourses, and sometimes in spots which from their elevated position might have been supposed unsuitable for the purpose. On the Ras-al- Khaimah-Baraimi route these wells are generally from 40 to 60 feet deep and are lined for 8 or 10 feet near the surface with timber or rough-hewn stones brought from the bills. Acacias, which are the commonest kind of tree, are of the Ghaf and Samr varieties the Ashkar shrub, the Markh bush, and grass of the kind called Arta are frequently met with ; and the dwarf tamarisk, the wild castor oil plant, and a bulbous grass called Qufa are also found. Other sorts of vegetation which afford grazing are Rimth, a species of Salsola which, when green, is eaten by camels ; Halam, a small sand plant; Thamam, a coarse grass which eventually dries up into twigs and becomes inedible ; and Qasad, a small vivid green shrub of the caper tribe ; the last three are eaten by livestock of all kinds. There is also a bright green edible weed, somewhat resembling mignonette, which is called Haram. Hills of Trivial ''Oman. — The only mountainous part of the country is in the east where a section of the spinal range of the 'Oman Promontory is included : this section is the part between a line joining Dibah to Sha'am on the north, and another, on the south, which runs inland from Khor Kalba, first westwards then southwards, so as to curve round the northern and western sides of the Mahadhah tract and the hills connected with it. The hill tract of Trucial 'Oman is thus about 50 miles in extent from north to south, and its average breadth seems to be about 20 miles. It is still almost entirely unexplored the only part of it as yet traversed by Europeans being that which lies on the direct route, through Wadi-al-Qaliddi, between Dibah and Ras-al-Khaimah ; and even of this part no account appears to be extent. As seen from the west, from the Ras-al-Khaimah- Baraimi route, the rtfountains appear to be disposed in three more or less parallel ridgea running from north to south: of these the westernmost terminates at a hill called Qumr immediately behind the village of Adhan ; and the second ridge, after curving slightly westwards, seems to continue the interrupted line of the first. The third or easternmost ridge contains the highest peaks and probably overlooks the Gulf of 'Oman : one of these high peaks, situated apparently 12 to 15 miles east of Adhan, is said to be named Jabal Sa'ta. It is possible, however, that these three ridges are apparent only, and that the hill system is more complex than from the west it seems to be. As Adhan in the Jiri plain is considered to be a village of Wadi Ham, it may be inferred that this valley pierces the whole mass of mountains from side to side and even conveys part of the drainage of the south end of the Jiri plain to the Gulf of 'Oman at Fujairah ; but it has not been found possible to locate with certainty the true head of Wadi Ham ; in any case, however, its average direction appears to be from north-west to south-east, and not from west to east as has hitherto been generally supposed. Wadi-al-Qor, further south than Wadi Ham, is the only other considerable valley that comes down to the sea from the hills of Trucial 'Oman on their eastern side. The drainage from the western slope of the hills never, apparently, reaches the Persian Gulf, but Is swallowed up by the inter vening sands. Climate. —The climate of Trucial 'Oman in winter is pleasantly cool by day and cold at night, but frost is unknown: on the coast, in the same season, the weather is often boisterous. Between May and October the climate is excessively hot and trying; and during the worst of the heat, that is from May to September, travellers journey by1432 'OMlN night as mucli as possible. The rainfall is scanty and is believed to average about 5 inches a year. Most of the rain is received in midwinter, but there are also occasional showers in spring. Population and tribe*. —The people of Trucial 'Oman belong to numerous distinct tribes ; indeed, the country is tribally one of the most composite and perplexing in the Persian Gulf. The comprehensive ' Joasmee ' tribe, assumed by some writers, has no real existence. Only the members of the family of the Shaikh of Sharjah, numbering at the present day about 20 adult males, are Qawasim (Jaw asim) by blood ; and the use of the name to denote all subjects of the Shariah Shaikh, though partially sanctioned by local practice, is really incorrect. The following is a synopsis of the principal tribes of Trucial 'Oman:— Tribe. Singular. Settled in Trucial 'Oman (souls). Bedouins in Trucial 'Oman (souls). Location. Remarks. 'Abadilah ..

These are said to be of the same stock as the Baharinah, but they are Sunnia by religion. By some they are bel eved to be an offshoot of the Mazazi', but this is doubtful. They own about 10 camels and 150 sheep and goats ; but they also cultivate a little, and some of their number are semi- settled. See article Qawasim. See article Bani Qitab. There is also a singu lar Shahyari. The Shahairah are con sidered to be abori ginal. The Bani Shamaili are said to have been originally Jews (sic), but now they are closely connected with the Shihuh and may almost be regarded as a section of that tribe, though not included in either of its 2 main divisions. They are also called Shamaliym. A few of them who are nomadic are found among the Shihuh in the Ruus-al-Jibal dis trict of the Sultanate. 'Oman 8x21436 'OMAN Tribe.

This tribe are appa rently identical with the section similarly named of the Bani Ka'ab, with which tribe they still inter- marry, but in this Gazetteer they have not been included among the latter. In religion they are Hanbalis. See article Sudan. See article Tanaij. The Thamairat were originally Marar, but they are now reckoned the Bani among Yas. See article Bani Yas. See article Za'ab. They are said to have been formerly Sharqiyin of the Hafaitat section, but at the present time they are un doubtedly a distinct tribe. t &gt;- i tt T • , ? 0,10 d ' uuul ' -Dfi.iucms at uibai j own, Ghailah and Ras-al-Khain ah; 194 Hindus at Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Umm-al-Qaiwain and Sharjah S^Tvi J?

Negro slaves are exceptionallv numerous in the coast towns but no separate estimate of them is possible and they may be taken as included m our tables among the Arabs to whom they belong. The Indians are not domiciled nor accompanied by their families. Here it may be useful to mention that'OMAN the Bayadir found in Sir, at Dibah, and elsewhere, e.g., at Khasab in Ruus-al-Jibal, are not a tribe but a class,— the class namely of the agricultural labourer to whatever tribe he may belong. The singular of the name is Baidar. The total number of Bedouins in Trucial 'Oman may be estimated in accordance with the table above at about 8,000 souls. In respect of settled population, however, the table is not exhaustive, and recourse must be had to the articles upon the principalities from which it will appear that the figures are :— Principality. 'Ajman Dhabi (Abu) Dibai Qaiwain (Umm-al-) Sharjah Settled inhabi tants. 750 11,000 10,250 5,000 45,000 Total for Trucial 'Oman 72,000 By far the strongest numerically of the settled tribes are the Bani Yas, whose Bedouins also are the most numerous of any except the Bani Qitab. Next after the Bam Yas there rank, in point of numbers among the settled tribes, first the Sharqiyin and A1 'All and then the Al Bu Mahair and the Sudan. Political and religious distinctions. —Like the people of the 'Oman Sultanate those of Trucial 'Oman are divided between the Hinawi and Ghafiri political factions, but Gha- firiyah greatly predominate, the Bani Yas and the Shihuh alone being Hinawi; and, whereas in the Sultanate the Hinawiyah are mostly Ibadhis and the Ghafiriyah mostly Sunnis by religion, here the Hinawiyah are all Sunnis of the Maliki school while the Ghafiriyah are virtual Wahl abis. The Wahhabism of Trucial 'Oman is not now, however, of the militant order; it is generally described as Sunniism of the orthodox school of Ibn Hanbal, and it even connives at the private consumption of tobacco, though not as yet at the public sale of the same. Modern rifles are widely distributed among the people in both town and country. Character, life and language. —The people of the western coast, at least those of the more northern parts, have shown themselves in the past a bold and energetic race. By their piratical exploits at the beginning of the 9th century they gained; under the misleading name of ' Joasmees,' a permanent place in history and they played a large part in the politics of the Persian Coast, especially of Qishm island, and in those of Bahrain and the 'Oman Sultanate. At the present day they lead a quiet and unobtrusive existence, but doubtless the old qualities are latent in them still. The well-to-do classes on the coast of Trucial 'Oman have three meals a day ; the first, called Fakk-ar-Biq, or ' Loosening of the Spittle,' is a kind of breakfast and consists sometimes of pancakes made of eggs, rice flour and sugar ; the other two meals, at noon and evening, comprise rice with fish or meat, accompained by dates and thin cakes of white bread. Coffee is drunk several times a day. Virtually the whole free population is Arab, and Arabic is almost the only language spoken. Swahili, however, survives among negro slaves of the full blood. Occupations and resources. —Pearl diving is, since the suppression of piracy, the prin cipal and almost the sole occupation of the maritime population. In summer most of the able-bodied men, to the number of more than 22,000, are absent at the pearl banks ; and the coast towns and villages are left to a great extent unprotected and deserted. The number of pearl boats in Trucial 'Oman is approximately 1,215, carrying on the average crews of about 18 men each : they are distributed as follows :— Principality. Number of boats. 'Ajman .. .. .. .. .. .. 40 Dhabi (Abu) Dibai Qaiwain (Umm-al-) Sharjah 410 335 70 360 In winter some of the pearl diving class take part in the ordinary sea fisheries, but the majority of them spend the season at home in idleness, supported by boat owners and contractors who thereby acquire, under the stringent rules of the industry, an indefeasible lien on their services for the next pearling season. A few of the seafaring class are t- ■ 11 ,k :1238 'OMAN employed on the cargo vessels mentioned in the paragraph on shipping below. Fish * are everywhere plentiful and excellent, and turtle are caught upon the islands. The settled population who do not live by the sea are herdsmen and agriculturists; to this class belong most of the non-nomads of the interior and of the eastern side of the 'Oman Promontory. The agricultural capabilities of the country are, however, very limited ; and cereals, such as wheat and jowari, are grown only in a few favoured loca lities such as Sir and the Shamailiyah district. Dates flourish in most places ; but on the west coast south of Ras-al-Khaimah Town they never fully ripen, for want of water and are eaten fresh. Vegetables are raised at most places by means of well irrigatioon. Livestock are chiefly camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats, and there is plenty of poultry ; but horses are few in consequence of the difficulty of feeding them ; the last are kept on barley and desert grass, with occasionally a little lucerne, which in places is grown among the date groves. The Bedouins depend chiefly on their livestock for subsistence, but some of them take part in the pearl fisheries. In winter, when the weather is cool and grazing abundant, they are scattered far and wide in small parties ; but, as water and pasture become scarce with the approach of summer, they congregate in larger bodies around the more copious wells in the less inhospitable parts of the country. Favourite Bedouin summer resorts of this kind are the Jiri plain in the north and Bainunah in the west. They own many camels and a number of donkeys ; but the latter are used only for work in the neighbourhood of the camps, and not for long caravan journeys. Foreign trade. —Commercial statistics are available only for the larger towns on the western side of the 'Oman Promontory, and so much of the foreign trade of the country as is carried on from the Shamailyah coast escapes observation : the amount of this trade is probably inconsiderable, but the fact of its non-inclusion should be borne in mind. Scrutiny of the trade statistics shows how artificial is the existence of the larger coast settlements of Trucial 'Oman and how entirely dependent they are on the proceeds of the pearl fishery for the means of purchasing the ordinary necessaries of life, which they do not themselves produce. Pearls are the only export of any magnitude, and the average annual value of those sent abroad (almost entirely to India) during the last seven years has been 67 lakhs of rupees ; the second export in value is that of mother-of-pearl shell, worth only J of a lakh of rupees per annum. Dibai is now the chiof pearl mart of the Persian Gulf after Bahrain and occupies in this respect the place formerly held by Lingeh ; it has also suplanted Lingeh as the distributing centre for imported goods on the Arabian coast between Ruus-ul- Jibal and Qatar. The following are the chief imports with the average annual value of each during the past septennium (in lakhs of rupees) :■—grain and pulse, chiefly from Persia and India, 12^ ; cotton piece-goods, from India, 4 ; dates and date juice, mostly from Turkish 'Iraq, 3 ; coffee, from India, 2f ; miscellaneous provisions, from Persia, 2 ; and sugar, from or through India, 1^. Considerable amounts of specie also pass in both directions. In face of the facts it does not seem unreasonable to hold that all sources of profit here are subsidiary to pearl diving, and that if the pearl banks were to fail this coast would shortly be depopulated. Shipping. Dibai is the only steani port of Trucial 'Oman. Ten years ago Dibai was almost unvisited by European vessels, but in 1905-06 the number of steamers, call ing had risen to 34, all British, with a tonnage of 70,132 ; the progress of the place is a consequence of the decline of Lingeh. The number of native sailing vessels,-—other than pearl boats, coasters and fishing boats,—owned in the ports of Trucial 'Oman is about 90, distributed as follows:— Bidyah .. .. ,. 10 | Khaimah (Ras-al-) Town .. 15 Dhabi (Abu) Town .. ,. 10 Qaiwain (Umm-al-) Town .. 1 Dibai Town .. .. .. 20 , Rams .. .. .. .. 1 Fakkan (Khor) .. .. 5 an( j Gh^h .. .. ..10 Sharjah Town .. .. ..18 The majority appear to be Sambuks, but a proportion of them are Baghlahs, and there are some jollyboats andBadans : these vessels are chiefly employed in running to India an ports o the Persian Gulf for supplies. The statistics of pearl boats are given in the Appendix on the pearl fisheries. Fishing boats not also used as pearlers appear to be rou g y equal in number to pearl boats, but they are often extremely small. Jazirat-'OMlN 1439 al-Hamra and Sha'am, though they have no large vessels, possess some coasters of a useful size. , . , • „ ^ j • Internal trade and wamf/oriwes.—-Inland traffic is petty and is chiefly with the Bedouin tribes; but Sharjah, Dibai and Abu Dhabi divide with Sohar Town in the 'Oman Sul- tanate the trade, such as it is, of the Braimi Oasis. Local manufactures are few and none of them are exported. Fine sheep wool 'Abas are made at Sharjah Town, and daggers at Ras -al-Khaimah. A certain number of sail ing vessels are built, chiefly at Umm -al-Qaiwain ; the average numbers launched annually are about 20 at that place, 10 at Dibai and 5 at Sharjah Town. Topography.— toporgaphy of nearly the whole of Trucial 'Oman is explained in the articles on the five principalities of which it consists, and in the various subsidiary articles to which clues are given in the articles on the principalities. Some additional facts may be learned from the paragraph on communications which follows below. It only remains to deal in this place with the topography of a small land-locked which does not apparently belong to any one of the principalities in particular, and which has no general name ; the centre of this tract is approximately the Madam plain which lies about 40 miles inland, south-eastwards, from Sharjah Town. The principal points of the tract in question are as follows ;— Name. 'Aiyoh .. 'Anaij (Ramlat) . Badu' .. Dbakhar Faiyah (Jabal) Position. In the centre of the Madam plain. 20 miles south 'Aiyoh. of 11 miles south by west of 'Aiyoh.

Character. A single well, lined at the top with timber. A narrow strip of rolling sand hills. A group holes. A well of water A range of hills, reaching a height of about 1,000 feet; it runs north and south with a length of about 12 miles, and is roughly parallel to the main range of the 'Oman Promontory about 20 miles to the east- word of it. Remarks. The site is surrounded by acacias. This tract lies east and west across the Route from Ras-al- Khaimah Town to the Barimi Oasis. The site is a blind re entrant among sand hills forming a branch of Wadi Sa lt is situated a little to the west of ordinary route between Ras- al Khaimah Town and the Baraimi Oasis. At the northern ex tremity of Jabal Faiyah are two fan tastic rocks forming landmarks. They are known as Zibb-al- 'Azab, and Khadkat- al-Jariyah, names of which the mean ings are apparently obscene.1 'OMlN Position. 8 miles north east of 'Aiyoh. by 10 to 11 miles south of Uhaid village. 17 miles south of 'Aiyoh (The ex - act position is 24' 42 / 18' north by 55° 49' 26' east.)

A stony plateau without water or grazing, about 20 feet higher than the country immediate ly to the north of it and 550 to 600 feet above sea level. It runs west and east and is 3 miles broac 1 from north to south. Remarks. This well is on the ordinary route via Wadi Hatta from Dibai to Shinas Town. See article Gharif. It is on the north bank of a hollow which forms the southern border of Qallah Mahafidh. The name means ' The Gazelle's Bound.' The place is also called Khasaib. The plain is enclosed by the south end of Jabal Faiyah on the north, by Jal al Rodhah on the north east, and by the northern part of Jabal Samaini on the east: on the west it is divided by Wadi Yidaiyah from a tract of sandhills. Madam is a camping ground of nomadic Na'im connected with the Baraimi Oasis. This plain slopes down gently from the base of Jabal Faiyah on the west to the foot of the main range of the 'Oman Promon tory on the east, and it also declines gradually from north to south. The soil is sound and hard, con sisting of black sand and shingle ; near to Jabal Faiyah the sand is course and boulders take the place of shingle.Name.

This range is parallel to, but appears to be separated by an in terval from, the main range of the 'Oman Promontory, which is to the east of it. It emerges from a V- shaped gap near the south end of Jabal Samaini and runs first 4 miles west wards, then 7 miles northwards, and then westwards again to the desert. It comes from the neighbourhood of Jabal Khadhra (which is connected with Mahadhah) on the east and goes westwards to the desert. The well of Dhakhar is on its right bank. On its right bank is the well of Yidaiyah lined with wood like that of Masaifi. Communications. —See Routes in Arabia, 1915. Administration.—Each of the five principalities of Umm-al-Qaiwain, 'Ajman, Sharjah Dibai and Abu Dhabi is ruled by an independent Shaikh, whose possessions on the sea coast are generally under full control; while all except the Shaikh of 'Ajman, and parti cularly the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, exercise some authority or influence over Bedouin tribes in the interior. For further details the separate article on each principality mav be con sulted. Political position, foreign relation and foreign interests.—Hhe political position of Trucial ^ 'Oman in regard to Great Britain is difficult to define with exactitude ; it is regulated in C52(w)GSB gY1442 OKS-OQA the main by two agreements, each of which has been signed by, and is individrally bind ing upon, the five Shaikhs of 'Ajman, Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Umm-al-Qaiwain and Sharjah, The earlier in date of these agreements is a perpetual truce, concluded in ] 853, which provided for the entrie cessation of hostilities at sea among the signatories, and imposed on the British Government the duty of enforcing peace and obtaining reparation for maritime aggressions committed incontravention of the arrangement. It is in virtue t)f this treaty that the Shaikhs of the principalities are styled Trucial Shaikhs and that their country may appropriately be styled Trucial 'Oman. By the second treaty, signed in 1892, the Trucial Shaikhs bound themselves not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with a power other than the British Gov ernment ; not to permit, without the assent of the British Government, the residence within their territories of the agent of any other government; and not to cede, sell, mortgage or Otherwise give for Occupation any part of their territories save to the British Government. The exact international effect of these two agreements is a matter for publicists to determine, but taken together they evidently create preferential and almost exclusive 'relations between the British Government and the Trucial Chiefs,—relations which might be held to imply the dependence of the Shaikhs on the British Government in foreign' affairs and a moral obligation on the part of the British Government to protect the Shaikhs in so far as they may be endangered, or disabled from defending themselves, in consequence of the treaties of 1853, and 1892. The existence of some such position has been in a sense recognised by the Government of the French Republic. During the years 1909-10 it became necessary to warn some of the Trucial Shaikhs regarding their connivance in the Arms Traffic ; see Dibai. British subjects in Trucial 'On an are distributed as follows and include at each place a proportion of w r omen and children :— Town. Hindus. Muhammadans. Dhabi (Abu) 65 Nil Dibai 61 23 Qaiwain (Umm-al-). 11 Nil Khaimah (Ras-al-) Nil. 33 Sharjah 51 158 Total 194 214 If some Persians from the opposite coast and their concerns are left out of account, Great Britain is still the only foreign country which possesses any moral or material in terests or subjects in Trucial 'Oman : for the protection of these a Native Agent of the Persian Gulf Residency is maintained at Sharjah Town. The subjects in question are the Indians, Hindus and Khojahs, who are settled in the larger ports. ONSURAT (A l ) {Island)— See Farasan (Islands and Bank); bank, western side. 'OQAIR (B abr-al)— The name is very frequently pronounced 'Ojair. A coastal tract in the Sanjaq of Hasa containing the port of 'Oqair; it falls naturally within the main boundaries of Biyadh and should perhaps be regarded as forming part of that division. Boundaries. —Barr-al-'Oquair extends upon the sea from Tall-az-Zabanat, on the south side of the entrance of Dohat Ruhum, to Ras-as-Sufairah, a promontory of the mainland opposite the south end of Zakhnunlyah island ; its length from north-north west to south-south-east is thus roughly 38 miles. Its depth inland is undefined but small: possibly however the easternmost of the wells which are enumerated in the article on Biyadh (division VI) should be regarded as belonging to Barr-al-'Oqair, in particular those of Dannan, Rughwan, Mijama'ah and Suwad. Physical cMraciemiics.—Barr-al-'Oqair is similar in character to Barr -adh-Dhah- ran, from which it is divided only by Dchat Ruhum ; like its congener it is inferior to the Dabaisi and Hushum areas, but superior to the rest of Biyadh, and it contains many wells and numerous small date plantations owned and tended by the Bani Hajir. lMi on 11 lartis^' Dhalum (D5hat) From Ras-al-Qarai- yah on the north to Ras-al-Madhbah on the south.

In 1913, there was a spring of good water about half a mile west of the port; no water had issued from this spring for some years previous to that date. Residing in the Khan are some agents of Merchants in the Hasa oasis and other places. The surrounding Arabs are Bedouins of the Al-Morrah, 'Ajman, and Bani Hajir tribes. In the small tower referred to above there have been since May 1913, a few levies of Ibn Sa'ud.

It is miles long by U wide with an area of 5 square miles ; its highest point, near the south-eastern end, is 214 feet above sea-level. The formation is entirely volcanic, with coral and sand in the valleys and on the outskirts. There is no natural water supply and little vegetation. Perim was occupied by the British in 1799, subsequently abandoned, and re- occupied in 1857 on the opening of the overland route. For many years regarded as a place of little value, and with a small detachment of Indian troops as its only inhabi tants, it has now become a place of considerable importance from its position as a coaling station. In 1883 the Perim Coal Company obtained a concession on the south-western side of the island as a site for a coaling station and by this Company the harbour has been lighted and buoyed. Perim is a station of the Eastern Telegraph Company and also for Lloyd's signals. Lloyd's signal station is on the highest point of the island already referred to ; the lighthouse is on the same ridge to the northward of it. Near the west ern end is Signal Hill, 112 feet high, on which is another signal station. The surface of the island, which is generally flat, is grooved with watercourses and sparsely cover ed with coarse grass and a few stunted shrubs. Perim harbour is divided into two branches by Murray Point, on which are two white beacons which serve as leading marks into the harbour by day and on which the leading lights are exhibited by night. The main branch extends one mile to the north-west ward ; the other about 7 cables in a north-easterly direction, and is much encumbered with shoals. The bights on the eastern shore are Shand Bay, James Bay, and \\ illiam Bay. Telegraphi cables.—Fevim is in telegraphic communication by cable with Aden, Suez, Obokh, Asab, Masawah, and Suakin. Lights, Buoys, Signal stations, efc.—See Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot. The main light, exhibited at a height of 249 feet above high water, is visible 22 miles. Coal and supplies.— Welsh coal can be obtained from the stores of the Perim Coal 'Company and put on board at from 50 to a maximum rate of 120 tons per hour A stock varving from 5,000 to 15,000 tons, according to season, is kept m store, and from 800 to 1,000 tons is always afloat in lighters, ready for delivery m bulk by night or clay. The Company has 18 steel lighters of from 90 to 120 tons each ; there is room for 14 lighters at one time alongside the Company's three piers and there is no liability to interruption of coaling from bad weather. Provisions, stores, ice, and water may also be procured ; if fresh provisions in large quantities are required, notice should be given to the Perim Coal Company. The storage of ice is about 25 tons ; it is supplied at about £5 a ton. Water. —This is obtained from condensers, close to which is the water pier, with 12 feet of water alongside its head at low water springs. It has a pipe delivery both at head and sides, and on it is a derrick to lift 7 tons. Water is sent alongside in steam or motor tanks and pumped into vessels at from 20 to 60 tons an hour. The price is about 10/ a ton, but there are special prices for large quantities. JRepairs. —The services of an extensive salvage plant, and of European divers, can be had here and considerable repairs to ship and machinery can be effected. Ther , two small slipways with winches for lighters and launches which can haul up 100 tons dead weight. Several small steam cranes, steam hammers, punching machines, et besides a blacksmith's shop, are available.1448 PUL—PUZ Population and garrison. —In 1901 the population amounted to 1,236 souls.

QAHTAN— The singular is Qahtani; and, as distinguished from the collective plural Qahtan there is a distributive plural Qahatin. The Qahtan are almost the only very ancient Arabian people who still maintain their importance as a tribal unit. They are, according to Arab tradition, the mother stock of the Ahl Qibli, and it is not improbable that for a very long period of time they may have occupied their present district near the southern limits of the habitable desert. No travellers have penetrated into their country and little is known about them. Strange, and seemingly quite baseless, accounts of their customs are repeated among the nor thern tribes, for like all distant and unknown people, they are a peg on which to hang marvels. Distribution and -Their country lies to the west of Hautah and is divided into three districts, Al Hasat, Al Areyji and Tathlith, the last being near Asir. The Shahran and the Sbey lie to the west, the Dawasir to the south and south-west, the Bugum and Shalawa to the north. Somewhere north of Bisha is the Bilad Qahtan, with a group of villages known as the Qahtaniyeh (Tarid, Azim and Kiran are among their number) and the Beni Wahab villages inhabited by a small tribe of that name. The eastern, southrn and western limits of the territory of the Qahtan are not precisely ascertained ; but on the north they wander in Sadair and Washam; sometimes they dispute the pastures of Qasim with the Mutair or visit the districts of 'Aridh and Summan. They are believed to be numerous in Wadi Sabai', Wadi Bishah and Wadi Tathlith and to be found also m the Tihamah of the Red Sea basin; but in Widyan Dawasir they have no place, ihe distribution of their Bedouins is explained in greater detail in the table of tribal divisions below; and we may note that settled communities of reputed Qahtani blood are found in the south-western part of Najd at Quwai'iyah and Sha'arah ; in Qasim at Basr and Hatan ; in Sadair at Majma', Raudhah and Zilfi; in 'Aridh at Malqa andmm* QlH—QAI U55 'Wmut to itaiki * QAHZA (W adi)— One of the composite valleys of Wadi Maih (J. v.), in the Masqat district of the Sultanate of 'Oman.

A lagoon 2 miles in width by 3 miles in length, lying to the southward of Muhalrraq Island in Bahrain. Shelter. —It is enclosed on the south by Sitrah Island and its fringing reef; on the west by the Island of Bahrain ; on the north by Muharraq Island ; and on the east by a barrier-reef extending 3 miles to the Southward from Muharraq Island and terminating fn a rock, one foot above sea level at high water, which is called Qassar-ad-Diwan. Entrance. —The only entrance available for shipping lies between Qassar-al-Diwan and the Sitrah reef ; it is two cables wide and has a bar, formed by an extension of the eastern | barrier-reef which stretches right across its mouth and is 120 yards across at its narrowest part. In the centre of the bar is a gut, 60 yards wide and generally 16 to 17 feet deep ; istitreatkmr: but the bottom is rocky and uneven, and in places the depth is only 14 feet. The re- ray to Haral; mainder of the entrance-channel is from 5 to 7 fathoms deep and steep-to on both sides. A shoal lies outside the entrance, and there are two approaches, one to the north, the other to the sOuth of the shoal, of which the northern is the better. ISmifesiiW Interior. —Within the Khor the 5-fathomIine extends for a mile, enclosing a gutter | yjHugg, Miis from 1 to 2 cables wide with an average depth of 6 fathoms ; this grutter is situated 8 50 camel 'di between the barrier-reef and a large sandbank which lies in the middle of the Khor. The 4-fathom line extends further northward and encloses an anchorage about 1 mile long and 3 to 4 cables wide, suitable for vessels of moderate draught. The bottom here is hard and covered with a thin layer of sand ; it does not afford good holding-ground. There are two other good anchorages, lying respectively south and west of the middle gtound, with mud bottom and depths of 4 to 5 fathoms ; but they are difficult of access. There is abundant anchorage for light-draught ships up to within a mile of Muharraq Town. A channel which leads from the northwest corner of the Khor into Manamah harbour is 2 feet deep at low water and consequently fit only for small boats. Tides. —The velocity of the tidal streams in the Khor is generally about | a knot, the flood setting to the northward. In the entrance they are much stronger, being about 3 knots at springs, with swirls, eddies and overfalls at the bar. Naval value. —The entrance of Khor-al-Qalai'ah could be very easily defended by forts erected on the reef, and ships lying within would be secure from torpedo attack. The Khor is also perfectly sheltered from all winds. On the Other hand it would be expensive, if indeed it were possible, to dredge out the entrance and anchorages to the depth neces sary for large ships; the entrance even after improvement would be difficult, and the holding-ground inside, as already remarked, is indifferent: in these respects Khor-al- Qalai'ah does not lend itself to the establishment of a large defended port, but it might berve as a station for a torpedo flotilla. Survey. —The Khor was surveyed and reported on by Lieutenant and Commander H. B. Somerville of H.M.S. ' Redbreast ' in 1905 and the above are the principal resullg Of his inquiry, C52(w)GSB L . 8A1458 qal—qal QALAIB— Some wells in the Jafurah desert {q. v.) in eastern Arabia.

QARA TRIBE— An uncivilised tribe of the Samhan hills and certain coast villages in the district of Dhufar; in their own tongue they call themselves Hakli, and the word Qara is locally pronounced Gurrah. Their range is from Sadah on the east to Rakhyut on the west and inland as far as the country is habitable, that is to say for no great distance. Physical characteristics.—Tha Qaras are commonly stated to be a branch of the Mahra tribe. The differ greatly in appearance and character from the typical Arab, and, though they are generally regarded as belonging to the Gbafiri faction, it may lafor no QARA 1461 doubted whether they are really a part of the Arab race. They are an active and well- built people, too slender to be termed athletic and formed for agility and en durance rather than for strength. The typical Qara face is oval, with a forehead low but not receding, a prominent frontal sinus, and eyebrows horizontal rather than arched. The cheek bones are high and prominent ; the nose is long ; the lips are thin, the upper one short; and the chin tends to protrude. The Qaras have generally hand some features and a pleasant expression. Character, religion and language. —The Qaras appear to be excitable and untrust worthy. They profess Islam and undergo circumcision, but they pay little atten tion to other forms or ceremonies and are regarded as heathens by the ordinary Arab. Their beliefs are said to relate chiefly to Jinns and sorcery, but they are classed as Sunnis. No specimens have as yet been obtained of their language which has been described as a dialect of Mahri. Food and clothing. —The food of the Qaras is chiefly milk and flesh with honey, wild fruits, roots and vegetables. They are much addicted to smoking, and the men all carry short pipes carved out of stone. The clothing of the male sex is a piece of cloth 7 cubits long by 4 cubits broad, fringed or tasselled at the ends ; this they wrap round their loins allowing it to hang down to their knees like a short kilt. The men wear their hair long and secure it in a bunch by means of a leather fillet or a cord made of their own hair ; the fillet serves upon occasion for many other purposes. The women dress in a piece of cloth measuring 9 cubits by 2 cubits ; it is fashioned with short sleeves and descends a little below the knee in front, while behind it trails upon the ground ; in addition to this they throw a cloth 4 cubits long by 2 cubits wide over the head and shoulders. Female ornaments are nose and toe-rings, armlets and necklaces of silver ; the women divide their hair in the middle and collect it on each side in a tress which passes behind the ear and hangs loosely over the breast. The garments of both sexes are dark blue, being dyed with indigo, and men and women alike mark them selves upon the cheekbones with 3 vertical cicatrices. Mode of life and customs. —During the greater part of the year the majority of the Qaras inhabit thatched huts, and a few of them live in small tents ; but in the 3 winter months they occupy caverns. Certain of their cave-dwellings are of great size, accom modating the flocks and herds as well as the families of the owners ; in some there is an upper storey. One of these caverns at Dirbat is 150 feet in span, 50 feet high and 30 feet deep. The Qaras keep camels, cattle, sheep and goats ; they have very little cultivatio n They subsist chiefly by collecting frankincense and other gums but they deal also to a small extent in hides and ghi. The Qaras salute strangers by touching fingers with them, they do not shake hands. Qara relations kiss one another upon each cheek by way of greeting. A distinctively Qara custom is to slaughter a bullock at the grave on the occasion of a funeral and to distribute the meat to the assembled poor. As a race the Qaras are quarrelsome and addicted to mutual slaughter. The blood-feud is tempered only by the employment of Rabi's, or third persons specially engaged as protectors, whose duty it is to' take up the feud should the person for whose safety they are responsible be attacked while under their protection. Qara disputes, so far as they are not fought out with arms, are settled, by the authority of elders. Arms. —The arms of the Qaras are a wooden, shark-skin, basket-work or metal shield, about feet in diameter and conical in shape, which is also used as a stool, as. a head dress and for carrying water; a throwing-stick a yard long and pointed at both ends which they can deliver with great precision at 30 feet, causing it to turn over once in its flight, and can also make to ricochet along the ground ; and an iron sword without a guard, straight-bladed, 3 feet long and 2 inches broad, which they carry on the right shoulder without a scabbard. The throw-stick, which is called Ghatrif, is made of a specially hard wood called miat, which grows in the mountains. The sword is sometimes of German manufacture. They also wear daggers and a few of them have muzzle loading guns.Tie cliels i j Qaras te|(«(i this ttioii, t is in eveij n tkelitedli i section t: „ friendlv to ® Sultan of 'W inchdes a ' tion ciiW ^ liirfi QAK—QAR 1463 QARA (A L).— See Fuwwah.

Limits. —Qasim is bounded on the north and north-west by the frontier of the Jabal Shammar principality, which runs between the Shammar village of Kahafah on the one side and the Qasim villages of Quwarah and Qusaibah on the other ; on the east it meeta the Sadair district of Southern Najd; on the south-east it is divided from the district of Washam by that of Mudhnib ; on the south and west it ends where a country of igneous rock begins, a little beyond Rass. Physical geography. —Qasim is a flat and almost featureless tract. Its elevation above the sea probably varies above and below 2,500 feet, and its surface is thus 1,000 feet lower than the plains of Jabal Shammar. Qasim falls from both sides to the Wadi-ar-Rummah in its centre, of which the slope and direction, within the bounds of Qasim, are down wards from south-west to north-east. Though Qasim contains numerous villages the greater part of it is stony or sandy desert; and accidents of surface are generally insigni ficant. Where rock protrudes it is generally sandstone, the volcanic formations which belong to the territory of Jabal Shammar and girdle Qasim on north, west and south not apparently penetrating within the district. The water table is generally high, few wells having a depth of as muh as 10 fatoms, but the water is commonly brackish and in many places almost undrinkable. Wadi-ar-Rummah is the chief physical feature of the country, but it is scarcely dis tinguishable, owing to the width and ill-defined character of its bed, from the country on either side of it; more than one European traveller has crossed it without, apparently, becoming aware of its existence. Jabal Sarah is a low standstone ridge which has its origin in the vicinity of Buraidah and runs thence north-westwards for about 30 miles,1470 QASlM the villages of Shiqqah, Qara'ah, 'Ayun and Rodh lying in bays upon its south side • a little to the west of Rodh it throws off a low spur which is crossed by the road from Buraidah to Samirah in Jabal Shammar. A great plain, called Fuwailik, remarkable even m Central Arabia for the unbroken level of its surface, begins on the south side of Jabal Sarah near Rodh and extends westwards for some 25 miles ; its breadth however is inferior to its length. A number of the villages of QasTm are situated'in remarkable hollows or pits in which water and loamy soil approach the surface : such are the depressions, several miles in extent, which contain the villages of Quwarah, Qusaibah and 'Ayun, and the valley a little to the west of Buraidah, free of sand though surrounded by desert, along which the plantations of Khabb, Huwailan and Qisai'ah extend for 7 miles ; such too is the Sarif hullow to the north-east of Buraidah, which is 5 miles long by a mile broad and like the Knal.b valley has a northerly and southerly direction. Certain of the larger deserts which separate the cultivated basins of the villages from one another are known by special names. Among these may be mentioned Batain, a , tract ] of whlc} i J^al Sarah possibly forms the scrap on the south-west; it consists to- waids its southern end of standstone boulders and towards its northern of round pebbles ■ not a blade of green is to be seen in its whole extent of 25 miles from Wathal to Qusaibah! Another is J armus a wilderness of disintegrated standstone bearing not a single shrub which stretches along the border of Qasim between Qusaibah and Kahafah, with a length from east to west of 20 miles and a breadth of 10. Tarmus is remarkable for a small deep depression near its centre, called Thiqbat-az-Zarraq, which holds rain water for 3 or 4 months in the year and is adjoined on the south by a small hill named 'Anz. A some, what similar hollow exists some 10 miles to the west of Quwarah ; it is known as Ban- nyah, contains tamarisks and tall grass, and holds rain water throughout the year.

It is said that one of the principal purveyors of camels at Damascus, a supplier at the same time of escorts to Muhammadan pilgrims, is at the present time Bin-Rawwaf, a native of Qasim, Their history and institutions bespeak a sturdy love of freedom among the people of Qasim, and, though mainly addicted to husbandry and trade, their citizen infantry have always borne a good name for steadiness in the wars of Najd. The main peculiarity of dress in Qasim is among the women, who wear sleeves so loose as some times unexpectedly to expose their persons to view from the shoulder to the knee. Morals are said to be laid in Qasim than elsewhere in Central Arabia. Pal., I, 257, The men generally w ear their hair short. A number of the Qusman, but probably less than half, are Wahhabis ; and, among these, Wahhabi doctrine as late as 1878 carried more weight than law or civil authority. Yet even then Wahhabi-ism was not really popular, for intercourse with abroad had rendered the people comparatively tolerant, and the word ' Wahhabi ' had even be&lt;nm to be used among them as a term of abuse applicable to an ill-natured fellow. The Bedouins of Qasim are chiefly Mutair, but the Harb and Qahtan also visit the district, and a few Shammar encamp in summer within its northern border. On the data available the fixed population of Qasim may be roughly estimated at 45,000 souls; if 2,000 be added on account of Bedouins the total population will be 47,000. The area of the district being approximately 5,000 square miles, the density of population works out at less than 10 individuals to the square mile. Occupations and trade. —Agriculture and the carrying trade are the principal means of subsistence; the latter, it is calculated, employs on -third of the population of Qasim and the operations of the Qasimi camel masters extend to Makkah, Madinah, Hail, Baghdad, Basrah, Kuwait and Riyadh. Dates, w'hich in Qasim are sold by weight, are commonly exported to Jabal Shammar, and ghi to Makkah ; and in some years, when the rate is favourable, the dates and corn of Qasim find their way to Madinah. There is also an important trade in horses bought from the Bedouins, chiefly with India through Basrah, and horse and camel dealing are accounted highly respectable occupations. 'Anaizah' supplied by the Qahtan, and Buraidah, supplied by the Mutair, are the two principal horse markets; at Buraidah the number of animals is generally larger, while at 'Anaizah they are of better class. 'Anaizah is the principal trade centre of the country, and further details of the trade and industries of Qasim will be found in the article on that town. Both 'Anaizah and Buraidah are wealthier places than Hail. Usury is common in Qasim, and agriculturists, and even Bedouins, in the neighbourhood of the towns are frequently burdened with debt; the cash rate of interest is 15 per cent a year, and the rate in kind 50 per cent, at harvest prices. The weights and measures'of Qasim are identical with those of Southern Najd. Political position and administration. — Qasim has generally enjoyed a vertual auto nomy, but at times the whole or parts of it have been dependent or semi-dependent now on Southern Najd and now on Jabal Shammar. It has frequently played the part of a make-weight, causing the scale to dip on this side or on that in the long contest between the Wahhabi Amir of the south and the Shammar Amir of the north. Qasim is moreover the battlefield of Central Arabia; but its people, unlike those of Belgium, have ever taken an active and frequently a decisive share in the combats waged upon their own soil. Qasim contains the principal cross-roads of Central Arabia, routes* from Riyadh, Kuwait, Hail, Madinah and Makkah meeting at Buraidah or 'Anaizah. The internal political constitution of Qasim is loose ; but, sich as it is, it seems little subject to change under the influence of external events, and it has outlasted many vicissitudes of foreign war and alliance. The affairs of Qasim are dominated by the great municipalities of'Anaizah and Buraidah, each ruled by an Amir or chief who is in name tyrant but in practice effectually restrained by public opinion. Between the twin capitals there is perpetual rivalry and sometimes war; but they are not incapable, in great emergencies, of sinking their differences and taking united action for the common weal. Each stands at the head of a cluster of dependent town ships and villages, related to it in various and varying degrees of closeness and subordi nation ; as a rule places south of Wadi-ar-Rummah are thus attached to 'Anaizah and places north of it to Buraidah. Inl878 some of the places subject to Buraidah paid I**?.1472 qasim to it a tribute of one-twentieth of their produce, the corn by measure and the dates by weight. About 1878-80 'Aushaziyah, Shabibiyah, Wadi and Wahlan were included in the 'Anaizah sphere of influence, while that of Buraidah comprised 'Ayun, Bukairi yah, 'Ain Ibn-Fahaid, Hilaliyah, Huwailan, Khabb, Khabrah, Khadhar, Nabqiyah, Qara'ah, Qisai'ah, Qusaibah, Quwarah, Nabqiyah Rakaiyah, Rass, Rodh, Rodhat-ar- Rubai'i Sarif, Shamasiyah, Shiqqah.^Tarfiyah and Wathal. The distribution at that period was probably normal, and from the positions of the places mentioned it is easy to infer what must have been the political situation of most of the remainder ; in some cases however the present political connection is specified in the table below. Between 1874 and 1884 the village of Mudhnib and the Washam town of Shaqrah were also tributary to Buraidah; Mudhnib is still so. The administrative and military system of 'Anaizah is described in the article upon that town, and the system at Buraidah is similar. There is at present (1906) a Turkish cantonment at Shaihiyah and small Turkish garri- | sons are stationed in 'Anaizah and Buraidah ; in all but name, however, the district is still independent. The villages of Upper Qasim are about 40 in number. They are situated by wells in the valleys and their inhabitants vary between 500 — 3,000. The largest village is siad to be Qafa. Every village is surrounded by a proportional extent of palm-grovea gardens, and fields, reaching not unfrequently far down the valley along series of wells, which mark the direction of some underground water-course. It seems that a new well opened in the last will diminish the supply of a more westerly one, thereby suggesting that the slope of the country is in the latter direction.

QASR (Jabal)— See Fatasan (Islands and Bank); islands. QASR (U mm)— Properly a spot 7 miles above War bah island, on a prolongation northwards of tho 'Abdullah and Sablyah Khors. For 6 miles above Warbah island the inlet on which Umm Qasr stands is on the average three-quarters of a mile broad and its depth varies from 6 to 9 fathoms; at 6 miles it divides into two branches, one of which runs for a short distance (perhaps 3 miles) north-westwards, narrowing as it goes ; while the other continues northwards in tho direction of Basrah, The former branch at low tide is a mere mud-flat with a channel not more than 3 or 4 feet deep close to its western bank; but the branch which runs northwards continues undivided, with a depth generally exceeding 7 fathoms, for a distance of 14 miles and then splits into two arms of minor importance. Of these arms one, going north-north-east, reaches to within 12 miles of the Shatt-al-'Arab at Abul Khasib with soundings of 3| fathom and over; while the second, going north-north-west has its head only 11 miles south of Basrah and 10 miles east-south east of Zubair Town; but it is narrower and much shallower than the other. Now here within Khor Umm Qasr or Zubair is the navigation easy, for the channel is winding and the banks are submerged and disappear at high tide. A steamer can unload 30 yards from the shore Ballam convoys could, in a normal year, get up to within a few miles of Zubair. ' There is some doubt as to the true nomenclature of these waterways ; but the main inlet for 6 miles above Warbah island appears to be known locally as Khor-ath- Tha'alab, the small branch running the north-west as Khor Umm Qasr, and the large branch running to the north as Khor Zubair. Umm Qasr proper is situated about 1 mile above the point where the inlet first divides and about half a mile inland from the western bank of the western branch (Khor Umm Qasr): the usual landing-place, however, is opposite to the point of separation ' of the branches. The country to the east of the main inlet and to the north of Khor 'Abdullah appears to be a marsh several miles in extent; but it is possible from Ham- dan on the Shatt-al-'Arab to reach, without leaving terra fir ma, a point about 5 miles east of Umm Qasr proper. The only building at Umm Qasr proper is the old Turkish fort, formerly garrisoned by an infantry detachment from Basrah of about 30 men under an officer. The fort is nearly square, measuring about 120 feet each way, and having one entrance in the middle of the north face: a recently constructed salient on the west side enflades two faces. The walls are 15 feet high loop-holed at 4J feet from the ground, and are built chiefly of mud: but the gateway and coping of the wall are of burnt bricks. There are wells with a plentiful supply of water to the northward, opposite the entrance to the fort at 250 yards distance, and the water used by the garrison is sweet: whether ' it is obtained from these wells or from elsewhere is uncertain. No supplies are obtain able at Umm Qasr and not even vegetables are grown ; there is grazing for sheep, but not for horses. The wells are a favourite camping ground of Bedouins. At 300 yards to the east of the fort are the remains of an old Arab Qasr. The ground in the neigh bourhood is firm and gravely. Umm Qasr is 15 miles east-south-east of Safwan and about 34 miles south and a little east of Basrah ; there are no wells on the direct route from Zubair to Umm Qasr, and travellers between Basrah and Umm Qasr ordinarily pass through Zubair and Safwan.1488 QAS-QAT QASR-ASH-SHARQI— A fort in the Hasa oasis (g. v.), in eastern Arabia; it was formerly occupied by the Turkish garrison.

QA'TABAH— A town in Southern Yemen, half a mile from the boundary of the Aden Protectorate and situated about 107 miles beyond north-north-westward from Aden and 12 miles northward from Dhali'. The town is built on a rise in the plain at the foot of the western slopes of Jabal Marais, about 2 miles north-east of the Amiri village of Sanah and consists of a few stone dars and many mud hovels huddled closely together. The houses on the outer perimeter have evidently been joined by a high mud wall which surrounded the town. This wall now stands on the south side only and has been broken down on the north-east. The population consists of Arabs, Jews, and Turkish half- castes, and may aggregate 1,500 souls. The water-supply is derived from 7 principal wells, • 7n!!o 5 a 1 re l m the waterco urse south of the town, one in the town itself reported dry m 1903, and the remaining one called Bir Ziriyah, J of a mile south of the town, in British territory. The water is good and abundant. Forage and local supplies arc plentiful and market is held twice a week. There is cul ivation in the water course but elsewhere the ground is scrub and rocks. There is one large white mosque in the town, but the principal building is a large, flat-roofed, three-storeyed stone built house, situated on the east side of the town and used as a court-house by the Turks. The fort lies on the same level as the town, J a mile due north-west of it; they are connected by a bad road which is merely a camel track. The fort is built on a small oncy p a ^au, which ends in an undulating and in places very broken plain on the west ao v! 3 on r !

A town in Hadhramaut, Southern Arabia ; it is situated in the main Hadhramaut valley some 10 or 12 miles west-south-west from Shibam. Al-Qatan is a clean and prosperous Qa aiti town, built amongst extensive palm groves and agglomerations of gardens. There are several mosques and a busy bazaar; the houses are built largely 0 * fu 0n o u t ° wn is J surroun ded by mud walls which lead off and end at the palace of the Sultan and wind over the hill-side and are protected at the most elevated point by a strong fortress. The population of Al-Qatan is probably well over 2,000. The water-supply is good and abundant, and is derived almost entirely from very numerous wells. The chief feature of Al-Qatan is the palace of the governor, a huge white building with battlements and towers, and affording a striking contrast to the little brown mud houses the fresh-looking palm groves, and the red rocks of the encircling mountains- The palace contains several storeys. The dwelling rooms are above, the ground-floor being used for merchandise and as stables and cattle stalls ; and the first floor for domes tic offices The balustrades are decorated with a kind of chevron pattern much in vogue in these parts. The doors and windows are adorned with excellent wood carv ing ; and in addition the windows are painted red and have fretwork instead of olass The doors are fastened with wooden locks, the keys of which are about ten imhes long There are innumerable wells in this area. Small quantities of lucerne clover vegetables, spices, indigo, henna, and various kinds of grain are cultivated • 'but the chief object of attention is the date palm. A special kind of date called Hai'ar which is much prized seems almost peculiar to this district. Honey is obtainable The o/poultry ^ h0rses ' a few C0WS ' bullocks &gt; shee P and goats, and a good deal Wadi Serr is within easy reach of Al-Qatan, in the recesses of which is Qabr Salih the tomb of Sahh, of no architectural pretensions, but looked upon as one of the nrm' cipal sacred places of the Hadhramaut. 1 QATAN (B ait)— A section of the Qara tribe {q. v.) Southern Arabia. QATAR— Frequently pronounced Qatar, and sometimes spoken of as Barr-al-Qatar esneciallv when the reference is to the interior rather than to the coast. Qatar is a remarkable CS ^ TI g SB I)r0jeCting m the Arabian coast of Persian Gulf midway between of the Samhan hills and Dhufar district of/ 1490 qatar its entrance at Has Musandam and its head at the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arah: the axis of Qatar runs due north and south, and the promontory as a whole measures about 85 miles in length by about 40 in breadth. Boundaries. —On the east, north and west Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as- Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-east wards to the wells of Sakak : thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al- ''Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has ne-jer clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, and as the A1 Thani Shaikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Xaqiyan tract, the latter of the two alternative lines is to be preferred : the British Government have recognised Khor-al-'Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial 'Oman though the Al Tbani Shaikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Shabakhat Matti. It is said that three men, stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak, and Niqa-al- Mabarah, respectively, can watch the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea. Physical characteristics. —The interior of Qatar has only once been visited by a Euro pean ;* but its nature is tolerably well known from native accounts, and a list of the chief wells and camping grounds is given in this article ; the principal features of the coast line also are enumerated and described below. Practically the whole pronon- tory consists of undulating rocky and pebbly desert, and the northern part at least is very 1 &gt;w ; the level of the rest is generally higher than that of Bahrain Island. The only hill of any importance is Jabal-at-Tawar. Wells are numerous, and in winter there are also many pools of water among the rocks. The soil is poor, consisting in the b 'st localities of gravel and marl mixed with sand ; fields and date groves there are almost none, and such gardens as exist near towns and villages are small and unpro ductive, while hardly a tree is to be seen anywhere. The only natural vegetation is coarse grass, growing in tufts upon the sandhills, and stunted brushwood in places, i he climate is dry, and at a few miles inland the air appears to be entirelv destitute of moisture ; nevertheless the rainfall appears to be less scanty than in Bahrain, and fine crops of natural hay are said to be produced. Places and features of the coast. —The following are alphabetically arranged lists of the chief places, bays, headlands, hills, and islands which form or adjoin the coast; the first table is of those upon the eastern side, the second of those upon the western:—• East Side of Qatar.

It will be observed that a few gardens are the only places permanently occupied which are not situated upon the coast; this also is a noteworthy circumstance. The people. —The inhabitants of Qatar, as of most of the districts on the western shore of the Persian Gulf, may be conveniently classified as fixed and nomadic.

Pearls are the only export of value. Routes. —See Routes in Arabia, 1915. Political conditions. —Prior to 1766 A. D. the peninsula of Qatar, it is believed, was included in the dominions of the Bani Khalid Shaikhs, whose head-quarters, were at that time in Hasa and whose jurisdiction then extended as far north as Kuwait; and it is probable that the 'Utub, when they arrived at Zubarah in 1766, found the A1 Musallam occupying a pre-eminent, though not a paramount position in the country. In the course of about 20 years the pre-eminence of the Al Musallam appears to have been transferred to the 'Utub ; but the attention of the latter was for some time held in another quarter by their conquest of Bahrain. By the middle of the 19th century, however, the Shaikh of Bahrain had established a suzerainty — more apparent than real — over Qatar, and was represented at Bida' (Dohah) by a political agent who was a member of his own family. In 1868 direct negotiations took place between the British Government and the tribal Shaikhs of Qatar ; and, in the result, the interest of the Shaikh of Bahrain in Qatar was limited to the receipt of tributes probably on behalf of the Wahhabi Govern ment of Najd. In 1872 the Turks established a garrison in Dohah ; and with the cessa tion of the Wahhabi Zakat the political connection, such as it was, between Bahrain and Qatar came to an end. The Ottoman troops consisted of about 300 men under a major, with a few guns, quartered in the fort; but the authority of the commander did not extend beyond the 9h21516 QAT—QAT town, and was always precarious even there. In 1904 Herr Burchardt, an unimpeach able witness on such a point, noted that upon his request for permission to take photo graphs, he was referred by the Turkish commandant, to the local Shaikh, and that posts were carefully placed at night because the Arabs were well armed, not only with Martinis but even with magazine-rifles. The Porte, however, was strong enough to control the foreign relations of the local Shaikh, though the British Government never acknowledged the occupation; before the outbreak of war there had been negotiations between the two Powers for the removal of the garrison which has since shared the fate of that of Al-Hasa. Down to 1882, the Government of India had an agreement with the Shaikh of El-Qatar simUar to that signed with the Trucial chiefs; but it was after wards allowed to lapse. At the present time, Great Britain exercises an informal protectorate. The ruling Shaikh is Abdullah Ibn Jasim At-Thani, second son of the old Sheikh Jasim Bm-Muhammad, who died in the summer of 1913. Before his father's death he had acted for a time as governor of the port of Dohah, though supplanted in this post bv his x of .rother, Khalifa, in 1912. This brother is still hostile, as are his cousins, the sons u Ahmed At-Thani. Sheikh Abdullah has maintained friendly relations with fx, • j ' Which have contillued during the war ; he is on good terms with Ibn Saud o Rxadh, for whom his father more than once acted during the latter's overtures to the Indian Government. He is not, however, regarded as an energetic ruler. QATAR— A bluff point m the ridge in Jau (q. v.), in independent 'Oman, which overlooks the Muzdailah plam.

QATlF OASIS—* A well watered maritime tract in the Sanjaq of Hasa, the counterpart upon the coast of the larger and ncher Hasa Oasis in the interior. Position and^ extent. ~'The oasis of Qatif immediately adjoins the coast for a short distance on both sides of the town of the same name : on the east it is bounded by the sea and on the other sides it is enclosed by the large desert tract of Bivadh except It its south end upon the coast where it meets Barr-adh-Dhahran. The oasis extends about lln^riS l + t ¥ S * m , G dlstf fce south of Qatif Town and has thus a total length of about 18 miles ; its depth from the coast inland is on the average about 3 miles Physical charactenshcs and climate.-The greater part of the Qatif Oasis is a sandy plam, saturated with spring water and raised only a few feet above the level of the sea The springs are not warm hke those of the Hasa Oasis, but the source from which they are supplied is doubtless the same — the drainage, namely, of Southern Najd which disappears underground in the Dahanah desert and the Sahabah tract.

The intervals are occupied partly by sandhills, but partly also by the marshes already mentioned. -,,.11 Throughout Qatif generally the atmosphere is denser and heavier, the heat more oppressive, and the vegetation ranker and more luxuriant than in the twin oasis of Hasa. The climate of Qatif is damp and unhealthy, and the results of malarial fever are manifest in the sallow complexin and poor physique of the inhabitants. Population and inhabited places. —The settled population of the Qatif Oasis is not large ; it may be reckoned at 26,000 souls in all, viz., 5,000 in the town proper of Qatif, 6,000 more in the suburbs of the same, and 16,000 in the remaining villages of the oasis, which are 17 in number. Except some non-nomadic Bani Khalid chiefly at Umm-as- Sahak and a few Huwalah at Qatif Town — who are Sunnis — the peolple of the oasis are by race nearly all Baharinah and by religion Shi'ahs. There are some negroes, both enslaved and free, who have been included for statistical purposes in the communities with whom they live or by whom they are owned ; in religion the great majority of these are Shi'ahs. The 'Utub, who a century ago dominated the district along with the rest of the coast on both sides of it and later were displaced by the Wahhabis, have now entirely disappeared. In addition, to the sedentary population some Bedouins, chiefly of the Bani Haiir, Bani Khalid and 'Awazim tribes, frequent the oasis and ars held m fear by the timid Baharinah. It is reported that nearly every male adult in the villages of the oasis possesses a rifle. • • , , . . , The following, given in alphabetical order, are the principal places at present or for merly inhabited in the oasis : Name.

As in tlie Hasa Oasis, the land in Qatlf is irrigated clitefly, if not entirely, by flowing streams which have their origin in springs : the following is a list of the princi pal among these springs :—• Kame. 'Aq'aq A'raf .. 'Atiqah Buddi Dabaibiyah Darush Hashaish J adidah J auhariyah Ka'abah Majalis (Umm-al) Position. 1J miles north-west by north of 'Awamiyah village. miles west-north-west of 'Awamiyah village. 1^ miles west-north-west of Qudaih village. About | a mile south of the vil lage of Jishsh. In a line between the villages of 'Awamiyah and Qudaih, about I a mile from either. R emarks. About J a mile east of Lajam village. 2 miles north-west by west of 'Awamiyah village. 1 mile south of Safwa village .. J a mile south-west of Lajam village. Closely adjoining the village of the same name. About J of a mile south of Safwa village. One of 2 springs which irrigate the cultivation of Lajam. Apparantly irrigates the plan tations of 'Awamiyah next on the south to those watered by Hashaish. One of two springs on which the cultivation of Safwa depends. One of 2 springs from which the cultivation of Lajam is irrigated. The lands of Dabaibiyah village are watered by this spring. Daiush is the finest spring in the whole oasis: with 'Atiqah it waters the entire lands of Safwa village and is not exhausted. The surplus waters reach the sea to wards the top of Qatif bay by 3 separate channels, the only case in Qatif in which water is partially wasted in this fashion. Hashaish apparently waters the northernmost part of the plan tations of 'Awamiyah. Assists to irrigate the southern part of the cultivation of 'Awami yah. The water of this spring apparently goes to the lands of Qudaih village. The cultivation both of Jishsh and of Saihat benefits by this spring. The irrigation of Qudaih depends partly on this spring. 8i21524 QATIF Name. Position. R emabks. Qasair About A a mile to the north of Tobi village.

Saddain W ithin the village of Jarudiyah As is natural, this spring irrigates the Jarudiyah cultivation. Sadrfyah * 11 miles west of Qudaih village Sadriyah helps to irrigate the plantations of Qudaih. Taibah Close to the north side of 'Awamiyah village. One of the various sources of irri gation belonging to 'Awamiyab. Agriculture and livestock. Dates are the staple crop in Qatif, no village being without its date grove ; the water irrigating the plantations is in some places brackish, but this does not appear to affect the trees injuriously, and the total annual yield of dates in the oasis is computed at 24,000 tons. Cultivation other than dates — mostly wheat, barley, and nee — is inconsiderable. Fruits are abundant and of fair quality ; they include pomegranates, figs, peaches, grapes, bitter limes and citrons : besides these 'there are musk and water-melons, the last sometimes of gigantic size, and a few mangoes are produced at Saihat. Vegetables of many sorts are grown. Domestic animals are the same as in the Hasa Oasis. Transport animals in the possession of villagers are estimated at 50 horses, 200 donkeys of the famous white Has» breed, and 650 donkeys of ordinary breeds ; the last are mall and generallv grev or dark in colour. j j Communications. —See Routes in Arabia, 1915, Transport and supplies.

QATIF TOWN— The principal place and only considerable town in the Qatif Oasis ; it is situated on the coast of Eastern Arabia about 230 miles south-east by south of Kuwait Town, 30 miles north-west by west of the nearest part of Bahrain Island, and 64 miles north by west of Qair Port. bile and marine, approaches. —-Qatif town stands on the shore of the bay which reaches from Has Tanurah to Dammand and may be called Qatif Bay. The coast at this point runs nearly north and south ; and Tarut island, in the bay, bears east-north-east from the town at a distance of about 2 miles. Landing at Qatif is inconvenient, for boats of over 6 feet draft cannot in any circum stances reach on inner berth. The reef opposite the town extends about 10 miles to seawards ; and upon it, 2 miles east of the town, is an islet carrying a small and ruinous but conspicuous fort, of which the name is Burj Abul Lif. On the north side of Burj Abul Lif three channels leading from the open sea converge ; two of them are in the shore reef and come from the south-east and east respectively, the second of these passing immediately south of Tarut island ; the third approach is round the north side of Tarut, but it is only practicable at high water. From the basin in which these three channels unite, a single passage conducts landwards to the town and a passenger by boats feels as if he were ascending a river. Toum and suburbs.—Vaa town proper consists of a Kut or fortified quarter, and of a long bazaar outside but connected with it; and besides these there are various suburbs. The Kut, called also Qal'at-al-Qatif, is surrounded by a bastioned wall 30 feet high and presents a front, about 400 yards long and containing a gate, to the sea ; the shorter faces on the north and south measure about 300 yards each. There are gates also in the western and southern faces, the former opening on the suburb of Bab-ash-Shamal y to which it gives its name, and the latter leading into a cemetery. The front of the Kut is almost upon the beach ; but between the gate and the sea are a pier and the Port Office of Qatif, and a building known as Mansur Pasha's house stands at the water's edge a short distance to the south of them. Immediately to the north of the Kut is a dense forest of date palms, and on the west and south sides are suburbs which will be mentioned further on. The whole space within the walls of the Kut is filled by about 700 houses, mostly constructed of stone and gypsum mortar but a small proportion of them mere huts. There are no shops in the Kut; but the old Turkish Government offices stand in its extreme south-eastern corner, and a minaret of considerable height towards the southern end is one of the most conspicuous objects at Qatif. The bazaar, joining on externally to the south-western corner of the Kut, runs due south for quatrer of a mile to the suburb of Kawaikib in which it ends ; it is built of stone and lime, is roofed, and contains about 300 shops. There is also a quarter known as Fariq-al-Maqbarah perhaps from its adjoining a graveyard which is situated on the east side of the bazaar, between the bazaar and the south wall of the Kut. The principal suburbs are Bab-ash-Shamal, immediately outside the back gate of the Kut; Jarari, 200 yards west of Bab-ash-Shamal; Madaris, 200 yards west of the Kut end of the bazaar ; Maiyas, a similar distance west of the middle of the bazaar ; Dabaibiyah, ^ of a mile south-west of Maiyas ; Kawaikib, at the south end of the bazaar ; and fehari ah, a little east of the middle of the bazaar, between it and the sea. All of these are capable of being regarded as distinct villages and they have accordingly been described, each tinder its own name, in the general article on the Qatif Oasis. The ground between Babash-Shamal, Jarari and Madaris is open ; that between Madaris, Maiyas and the bazaar is occupied by enclosed yards and godowns ; that between Maiyas, the bazaar and Kawaikib is open. Defences. —There are no defences except the wall of the Kut. Population.—The total population of Qatif town, inclusive of the 7 suburban villages of which the names have been given, is estimated at 10,000 souls ; or, without the suburbs, at 5,000. Nearly all the inhabitants belong to the class called Baharinah and are consequently Shl'ahs by religion; but there are a few Huwalah artisans, who areQAZ-QIN 1527 namely, a cousin of the Shaikh who holds the Shamailiyah District in fief and his son ; and 3 at Hamriyah, viz., an exiled uncle of the Shaikh and his 2 sons. Outside Trucial 'Oman, for example on the Batinah coast, the subjects of Sharjah generally are sometimes spoken of-as Jawasim, and a tribe which has submitted to the Shaikh of Sharjah is said to have become ' Jasimi' ; to this fact is probably due the indiscriminate application, in old British records, of the term ' Joasmee ' to all the piratical inhabitants of what is now Trucial 'Oman. The trucial flag of 1820 unfortu nately came to be known (and is still known) as the Jasimi flag, and the Bani Yas of Abu Dhabi have consequently always shown a. certain disinclination to fly it. A tribe of Qawasim, by some supposed to be identical with the Qawaoim of Trucial 'Oman, are found in the 'Oman Sultanate at Miltiqa in Wadi Samail, at Nafa'ah in Wadi Mansah, in Wadi Risail, at Falaj-al-Hijari in the Sub-Wilayat of Saham in Batinah, at Mizra'-al-'Alowi in Wadi Maih, and at Bandar Jissah on the coast of the Masqat District. According to some authorities, however, these Qawasim are a section of the Nidabiyin. Other Qawasim, about 650 souls, occur at Duvvan in the Lingeh District of the Persian Coast.

The settled part of the Bani Qitab tribe is approximately equal to the nomadic : it is represented by about 500 households at the cluster of villages known as Aflaj Bani Qitab in the Dhahirah district of the 'Oman Sultanate and by 40 families at Dhaid in the Sharjah principality, and it may therefore be reckoned at about 2,700 souls in all, exclusive of the Baluchi colony at Aflaj Bani Qitab who are generally included for the purposes of tribal calculation. The limits of the Bani Qitab Bedouin territory are the northern end of the Dhaid plain, the towns of Sharjah and Dibai, the Baraimi Oasis and the western slope of the hills of the 'Oman promontory. These Bedouins do not as a rule enter hills, but they occasionally send their women and children and flocks and herds thither for asylum in time of danger. The fighting men of the nomadic sections being estimated at 600 the total strength of those sections may be assessed at 2,100 souls ; and they are believed to own about 1,300 camels, 200 donkeys, 200 cattle, and 2,000 sheep and goats. The Bani Qitab have recently been recognised by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, the most powerful chief in Trucial 'Oman, as clients of the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain and entitled to claim the protection of that ruler. •Either the number of the Mugharibah fighting men is greatly underestimated here or other settled sections must be represented at Aflaj Bani Qitab. C52(w)C&gt;B 9k i1530 QIT—QOR QITAIYAN.-- A watering place and camping ground on the ordinary route between Baghdad and Hail and lying between Sha'arah and Khasirah on the Darh Zubaidah at a distance of perhaps 18 hours' journey from the Shammar capital. At Qitaian there are said to be a number of wells situated in a depression surrounded by low ridges one mile south of Baqa a. The water is at 5 fathoms and is rather saline. Baqa'a is 45 miles north-eastwards from Hail. QIZIL RUBAT— A small town in 'Iraq ; it is situated 75 miles by road north-westward from Baghdad and some 18 or 20 miles from Khanaqin. It contains post and telegraph offices; supplies are fairly plentiful and water is abundant. There is good grazing, but fuel is scarce. About 50 transport animals, such as mules and ponies, could be collected daily. There are no camels. Qizil Rubat was a first-class Nahiyah of the Khanaqin Qadha. QIZILBASH— The name Qizilbash, or Redhead, is applied to a religious sect rather than to a distinct race ; they are found scattered about in Kurdistan, 'Iraq, Persia, and India. Qizilbash Kurds, for example, are sometimes regarded as separate tribe, but actually they are only those Kurds holding these particular tenets. The name Qizilbash is sometimes applied by Sunnis to unorthodox Muhammadans whose faith is a strange mixture of Shia'ahism, paganism, Manichaeism, and Christianity, sometimes one and sometimes another element predominating. They are a peaceful people and have a high reputation for energy, industry, and frugality. Many of them are cultivators.—( Murphy.) QOBBA— See. Fuwwah.

At the head of the Wadi, above the highest village, are camping-ground places of Bedouins of the Bani Ka 'ab and other tribes. Of the settled inhabitants about 400 appear to be subjects of the Sultan of 'Oman and 250 of the Shaikh of Sharjah. Native informers state that the gradients of Wadi-al-Qor are easy and that there is no rugged pass at the top ; they believe that a road for wheeled traffic could be made up the valley without great difficulty, but the point must be regarded as doubtful. • The route from Murair to Dhaid lies for the first part of the way in Wadi-al -Qor.

The hill is about 40 miles south of Kuwait Town and about 14 miles inland from the sea-coast- and the wells are 4 miles from it to the south-south-west. The Khor or depression lies to the north and east of the hills ; between it and the sea; it measures about 6 miles in each direction and is overgrown with grass and bushes. In spite of the fact that it is called a Khor or inlet, it appears to have no communication with the sea and its drain age is said to sink into the ground. QRAINIYAH— A settlement on Failakah Island (q.v.), near Kuwait Bay, Persian Gulf, where Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait has a house.

The island is frequented by fishermen from Musallamiyah and Jinnah islands, from Hadd (II) in Bahrain and possibly from Kharag island, who dry fish and make turtle oil for sale at Basrah and Kuwait. The oil is used as a remedy both for rheumat ism and for costiveness. The ownership of Qran is apparently indeterminate. QUBABINAH— A section of the Sahul tribe {q.v.) of southern Najd.

QUR— One of the valleys of the Wadyan {q. v.) tract of north-eastern Arabia. QURAIN or QRAIN — Frequently pronounced Grain. A small barren islet in Kuwait Bay, about half a mile off shore at a point 4 miles to the west of Kuwait Town. Towards its south end is a small brown-coloured mound 27 feet high. On the south-east side of the island, between it and the shore, there is a small basin called Bandar-ash-Shuwaikh where native boats may ride, perfectly sheltered from all winds, in 3 to 4 fathoms of water. This harbour is connected with the open bay by a long narrow gut, which over a distance of 400 yards carries only 12 to 13 feet of water at low spring tides: the obstruction appears to be of rock which could not be very easily removed. ' Graine,' the old English name for Kuwait Town, was probably taken from this island. QURAIN— A village in Wadi SamS.il {q. v.), in the 'Oman Sultanate. QUR AI YAH— A small village in Bahrain Island {q. v.). QURAM— A village in Wadi 'Adai {q.v.), in the Masqat district of the 'Oman Sultanate. It is situated 6| miles from Matrah, via Ruwi; by striking across the hills the distance is reduced to about 4 miles, but the going is difficult and it is better to go by Ruwi village. Quram consists of one mud building and 70 palm-branch huts. 1 here are six wells, all stone-lined and flush with the ground; the water of one is stagnant and of another brackish. The villagers get their drinking water from 3 small wells north-north-west of the village, but the water in each looks dirty and would probably be unsafe unless boiled. The average depth to water is 15 feet, and the diameter of the wells 3 feet. The well with the stagnant water is 10 feet wide and the depth to water 20 feet. There is no culti vation and the date palms are few and poor ; round about the Wadi Adai a fair amount of brushwood is obtainable. The villagers obtain their meagre supplies from Matrah. Livestock comprises 30 cows, 26 donkeys, and 300 goats (1915), but of course these numbers vary continually.— {Murphy.) QURAN— A small hamlet on the south-eastern coast of 'Oman {q. v.). QURMAH— An uninhabited island close to the town of Ras-al-Khaimah {q. v.) in Trucial 'Oman. QURNAH QADHA— A division of the Basrah Sanjaq of the Basrah Wilayat in 'Iraq. Position and boundaries.—The Qadha of Qurnah is situated on both banks of the Shatt-al-'Arab immediately below the point where that river is formed by the junc tion of the Tigris and the old channel of the Euphrates ; a small portion of the dis trict also, containing the administrative centre, is enclosed between the Tigris and Euphrates above their confluence. Conterminous tracts are the Qadhas of Shatrat- al-' Amarah and (perhaps) Zubair on the north, Persian territory on the east, the Qadha of Basrah on the south, and that of Suq-ash-Shuyukh on the west. Topography and inhabitant*.—The chef-lien, Qurnah Village, which is elsewhere described in a special article, is the only place of any importance in the Qadha, and it too is of small size. The only other villages deserving of mention are Madinah, Nash- wah and Sharish, which, under Turkish rule, were the seats of Mudirs : the first of these is the subject of a separate article, and the other two are noticed in the article on the Shatt-al-'Arab. The only great natural features of the district are the rivers Tigris, 2Jr1536 QUR—QUE Euphrates and Shatt-al-'Arab, on which its entire character depends The nrinciml tribes of the Qadha are Ahl-al-Jazair, Qatamah, Bani Malik and Bani Mansur of these the first and the last are found on both banks of the Euphrates and on the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab the whole way from Hammar to Sharish, while the Bani Malik are found chiefly on the eastern side of the Shatt-al-'Arab. Population. The fixed population of the Qadha is estimated at 30 000 souls and nearly all of these are Arabs belonging to the Shi'ah sections of Islam. Resources. —Qumah is a damp and unhealthy district, but fertile arid well irrigated' Large quantities of dates and rice and smaller quantities of wheU and barlav are nro- duced year by year ; and livestock are abundant, especially buffaloes. The only local manufacture is one of reed mats. Administr'Uion.—qnmah is divided into 4 Nahiyahs besides that forming the head quarters or Markaz : they are Dair-wa-Sharish, on the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab • Madinah, upon both sides of the Euphrates before its junction with the Tigris • Bani Mansur; and Nashwah on the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab. The headquarters of the first, third and fourth of these are the villages of Sharish, Madinah and Nashwah respectively. ' QURNAH VILLAGE— A small municipality in 'Iraq, situated between the Tigris and the old bed of the Euphrates. Qumah consists of about 160 houses with a large number o* huts ; and the inhabitants who are almost all Shi'ah Arabs of the Bani Mansur and Ahl Nahairat tribes, mav number about 2,000 souls. Many natives of the place are employed as lightermen at Basrah and elsewhere. The neighbourhood produces dates, barley, wheat and rice and many buffaloes ; but the climate is unhealthy and there is very little trade. The only manufac ture is of fine summer 'Abas, some of which (it is said) can be passed through a finger- ring and are called Khachiyah : Qumah was also famous for a kind of cheese which is made in strands and plaited together for sale. The position of the town, commanding both rivers where neither is more than 100 yards broad and the water in each is 20 to 30 feet deep, is one of high administrative and military importance, and the fact was realised, though imperfectly by the Turks Qumah is the headquarters of the Qadha of the same name. There are a quarantine station and a telegraph office, the line from Basrah to Baghdad dividing at the latter into two branches, one of which follows the Tigris and the other the Euphrates valley. r \ She present Qumah was founded more than 100 years ago by the Turks, who fortified it with a double wall on the landward side against Persian attack ; but the name existed as early as the 17th century, and there was a ' castle ' even in the 16th. Qumah is said to occupy the site of a more ancient place called Dighah, while local tradition even places the Garden of Eden here and points to a tree, still in existence, as planted by the patriarch Noah. Qumah has greatly increased, both in size and importance, since the Turkish evacuation. It is at present the terminus of the Tigr s railway.

QUSAI'IR (C ape and village)— Has Qasai'ir is a low, rocky point on the south coast of Arabia, situated about midway between Shihr and Saihut in Lat. 14° 54' N., Long. 50° 17' E. Close westward of it are two small rocky islets from which a reef, partly dry at low water, extends south-eastward to a distance of 4 cables southward of Ras Qusai'ir. Boats find shelter between this reef and the headland and also behind a reef about 7| cables north-east ward of the headland. About a mile inland from the cape is Qusai'ir village. It is squarely built and is walled on the landward side : there are a few stone buildings, including a small qasr but it consists mainly of huts. The qasr is in ruins and stands J a mile north-westward of the village by a small date grove. On the seaward side are four detached towers. The tiny port of Qusai'ir is just a nook in the black basalt coast where boats can nestle behind a small natural breakwater, known as Ras Dis, lying on either side of it accord ing to the wind. The inhabitants own a few boats, rude craft of which the planks are sewn together with cord ; in these they catch sharks, the tails and fins of which are exported to India and Masqat. A couple of miles westward of Qusai'ir is the scattered hamlet of Al-Qurain.— {R. S. and G. of A. Pilot; Bent.)

The Bani Rabi 'ah are descendants of the powerful Rabi'ah group which with Mudhar constituted the^ Northern Arab stock, the Arabs of middle Arabia as distinguished liom those of \aman. Previous to the Muhammedan invasion the Rabi'ah had mi- grated northwards and had given their name to one of the extreme northern provinces of Mesopotamia. Their settlement in the 'Iraq may date from the same or even from V f j J ea ' rll0r P eriod and there can be little doubt that few of the tribes between Baghdad and the sea have an older title to the lands they occupy. The tribe as constituted at present consists of four large divisions, the Amarah, Maiyah, Maqasis and Sarraj, each of which is practically an independent group obeying its own paramount Shnikh though the Amarah are considered the leading member of the confederacy. Three of these 4 are of true Rabi 'ah origin, but one, tho Maqasis, are Saiyids, tracing their lineage to one Said Muhammad al Muqasqas (so nick named, according to tradition, on account of his hairy chost) who migrated from the Hijaz &lt; u ring the last days of the Abbasid Khalifate. He settled first on the Euphrates Jftween Karbala and Hillah, moving over subsequently to the Tigris where he joined the Rabi ah confederacy and intermarried with them. Most of the Maqasis wear the green turban of the Saiyid by virtue of their origin. Besides these four divisions, the hereditary Shaikhs of Kut are members of the Bait i^aba family, a branch of the Al bu Badr section of the Maiyah. They have gatheredEABIAH round them during the last 200 years a number of detached sections of tribes outside the Rabi ah and those formed a fifth group which, if not in origin homogeneous were all fellahm on the Bait Saba lands and under the control of Bait Saba' Shaikhs' This group has been temporarily dissolved by the war. The Bait Saba' family suffered severely at the hands of the Turks after the fall of Kut. The eldest branch of 'Ihe house was wiped out, many members of the family were exiled and many have sought refuse with us and are living at 'Amarah. s xeiuge Bani Rabi 'ah shaikhly houses are found in authority over tribes not included in +v a confederation.

(The situation of the bulk of each section is given in the tables m all cases as it was before the war.) The whole tribe are settled The Jilukh and Shuwawish sections provide the Hoshiyah of the Amir and number in all 250 horse men. Ihe Bam Amir are said to number 1,000 men and the Quraish 1 200 • these figures are possibly below the mark since Colonel Leachman puts the fighting strength of the Amarah at 1,000 horse and 2,000 foot. &amp; &amp; engin Maiyahr—k tribe of cultivators settled mainly on the west bank of the Gharraf 5 ^ ' als0 partly 0n the east bank and on the Shatt al 'Ama Tol t ?u K V^ i r Unt Shaikh is Muhammad Al Yasin.

'There is no paramount Shaikh ; the tribe s divided into two main sections, the Bait 'Aziz and the Bait Ibrahim al Aziz and his brother Kamar are the principal Shaikhs of the first, while Zamair ibn Salman, Nasir ibn 'Isa and 'Aziz ibn Jadu' are the leading men of the second. Zamair, who was a staunch ally of he British Government, is now a prisoner in the hands of the Turks. The Bait 'Aziz is said to number some 300 men and the Bait Daghir about oOO. This is perhaps a narrow estimate for Colonel Leachman puts the fighting strength of the Maqasis at 200 horse an 500 foot. $arr&lt;y.—The Sarraj or Sarrai, to give the dialect form of the name, are partly settled fellah n and partly nomadic breeders of sheep. The settled sect ons cultivate the east bankof the Gharraf and the area east of the Gharraf. The paramount Shaikh is Qassab ibn Attar (or al Baqqal) who is bitterly anti-British. They are divided into a number of sections varying in size from 50 to 100 men. Many of these are dircc ly - der 4 rr b - ^ fnnn ? . lya n 0 ? 50 1 horse and 18 said to command in tribal levies 300-400 horse and 1,000 foot.

They are said to number 1,000 men. Tayih ibn Zamzir of the Bait Khalati, a younger branch cf Qassab s family, has come in to us.

Of these, the first and largest is said to be a walled village ; the second, which is perhaps Rass proper, a village with a high watch tower rising above the palms ; a d the third, a village, the smallest of the three. Some authorities hold that these places are depend ent villages of the Rass oasis ; others, that they are merely separate quarters. Accord ing to one report, Ruwaidhah is 10 miles north-west by west from Rass and separated from it by Wadi-ar-Rummah. One authority places Shinanah 5 miles south-west of the centre of Rass ; another makes it H miles to the north-west and nearer to Wadi-ar- Rummah, but both these reports agree that it is south of that great watercourse. It is said to have been unoccupied since the fighting in these parts, in 1904, between Ibn Sa'ud on the one side and lb a Rashid and the Turks on the other, and the cultivators are said to have moved to in Rass proper. The total population of Rass has been estimated at 3,000 souls and the place is regarded as belonging mainly to the 'Anazah and 'Ataibah tribes. The oasis is girdled, except on the east, by date groves and orchards, but the major portion of these is said to have been destroyd by Ibn Rashid before his defeat in 1904. Rass possesses much arable land in the bed of Wadi-ar-Rummah ; water is good and abundant at 6 to 7 fathoms below the surface. Several outlying granges also, where corn is grown, are associated with Rass. Rass lies on the route between Kuwait and Mecca and is consequently in the path of many caravans ; supplies are plentiful and many of the inhabitants live by the carrying trade. The place is usually subordinate to the Amir of Buraidah : the local Shaikh is said to be one of the 'Ataibah. Unfortunately Forster Sadlier left no description of the place ; he merely states that he was ' a reluctant witness of the devastations of the Pasha's army as far as the ruins of Rus (sic).' RATAWI— A station on the Basrah-Nasiriyah line ; it is 46 miles from Basrah (Makina) by rail and about 50 by road. There is no village here, only a camping ground. Bellums carry ing 4 taghars (say 20 maunds) can be unloaded on the island feature north of Ratawi, but when the river is in flood the low-lying land between Ratawi and the island would have to be crossed by a cause-way. Brushwood is available in small quantities, and there is grazing, for camels only, round the camping ground.

RAZAZAH— In name a Qadha of the Karbala Sanjaq of the Baghdad Wilayat in 'Iraq ; in practice rather a Muqata ah of the Karbala Qadha. Razazah is really a small estate situated on the north-western bank of the Rashdiyah branch of the Husainlyah canal, about 12 miles south-west of the town of Karbala ; on the south side of it is the swamp known as Hor Abu Dibis, fed by the water of the canal. Originally the property of the Turkish Gov ernment, Razazah was, as a measure of policy, conferred by the Porte as a free grant on Fahad Baig-bin-'Abdul Muhsin, a leading Shaikh of the 'Anizah tribe, and about 1875 was constituted a Qadha of the third class, the Shaikh being at the same time appointed Qai n-Maqam. At a later period Eahad Baig, while allowed to retain the ownership of tho estate, was deprived of the official post of Qaim-Maqam in favour of his cousin Fahad- bin-Daghaiyin, by whom it is now held. Tho emoluments of the Qaim-Maqamship used to consist in a monthly allowance of 1LTrahs and one-fourth of the net amount of the cattle tax collected from the Arabs under his authority. Both the owner and the so-called governor of Razazah lead a wandering life in the desert with their tribe; tha former is represented locally by a negro agent and has a small mud fort there, in which he used at one time to reside and which is now used as a granary. The ordinary inhabit ants of the place live in huts and number about 750 souls. The value of the Turkish Government share (~) of the crops of Razazah used to be about 500 Lirahs per annum. RAZIN (Al)— One of the 'Amair families of the Bani Khalid tribe (q.v.), of eastern Arabia. RAZIQ (B ani)— A section of the Bani Bu 'Ali tribe {q.v.), of the Ja'alan and Sharqiyah districts of the Sultanate of 'Oman. RED SE A— This extensive inland sea lies between the parallels 30° N. and 12° 40' N., and between the meridians 32° 20' E. and 43° 25' E. From Suez to Cape Bab-al-Mandab it is about 1,200 miles long, in a south-south-east direction ; and its greatest breadth from shore to shore at right angles to its axis is in the southern part near Musawwa, where it is 190 miles wide ; its least breadth, in the Straits of Bab-al-Mandab, is 14 miles. The northern part of this sea bifurcates ; one branch, the Gulf of Suez, has a general north-north-west and opposite direction throughout its length, which is about 170 miles ; the other, the Gulf of 'Aqabah, has a north-north-east and opposite direction, and is about 97 miles long. On the promontory between these gulfs, the Sinai peninsula, is the mountain group called Jabal Musa. No rivers discharge themselves into the Red Sea, and the northern half of the region is in the rainless district. Coral Reef*. —The Red Sea though, generally speaking, of considerable depth (in some places over 1,000 fathoms) is in parts studded with rocky islets and hidden coral banks extending far into the main ship channel. They are more numerous in the southern than in the northern portion of the sea, the principal being the Farasan, the Zabair, and Hanish islands. In the Red Sea they are perhaps more numerous and extensive than in any other body of water of equal size, extending most commonly in long strips parallel with the shore, with which they are in many cases united. Usually they are not mora than 5 feet below the surface, but the sea seldom breaks on them, and their outer edges1568 RED SEA are generally very steop-to. In the Gulf of Suez they are generally only 2 or 3 feet below the surface, and in summer they occasionally uncover ; the light green tint of the water on them makes them almost always plainly visible from the masthead, except with the sun ahead or when the glassiness of the water in a dead calm prevents any reef being seen. With the slightest ripple these shallow reefs always break on the weather side. Among the Red Sea reefs unconnected with the shore, several are at some distance from it but with channels between them and is of sufficient depth to admit of navigation by small vessels, and binder their lee good anchorage may often be obtained. These reefs are more numerous on the eastern than on the western shore. There are also many isolated reefs, but they are not so formidable as might be supposed in consequence of the trans parency of the water which admits of their being easily seen from aloft. The water outside the reefs, especially when moved by storms or tidal streams, is often of a milkv appearance caused by the coral sand then stirred up. This white water frequently indi cates a shoal, but not always for some reefs show as dark green patches. This is the case at Jiddah. Central and Inner Channels. —The existence of the islands and reefs just mentioned has led to a division of the Red Sea into a central and two inshore channels. The central, and for all practical purposes, only navigable channel used by full-power steam vess, la bound through the Red Sea, lies between the outer extremes of the reefs extending from either shore, and has a depth of over 1,000 fathoms in the centre abreast of Cape Elba but shoals towards both ends of the Red Sea. The breadth of this channel in its widest part, near the Sayal island, is about 110 miles ; further southward it decreases to , 0 m p re than 40 miles, and from thence gradually narrows as the Straits of Bab- al-Mandab are approached. The inner channel on the Arabian side is formed partly by small detached reefs and * sunken rocks, and partly by island and long reefs. The general width of this inner channel is from - to 3 miles ; the depth is considerable, and the anchorage, except in the places hereinafter described, is so insecure as to afford but little protection. The inner channel on the western coast is similar in character to that on the eastern coast, but much narrower. The harbours, of which there are several, furnish fair anchorage ; but it is unsafe to anchor on the rocky shelves projecting from the reofs. Both of these mshore channels are connected with the central channel by openings in the reefs, some of which, especially tho.e northward of latitude 17° N., are of great width. Mountains—The land adjacent to the Red Sea, as well as to the Gulf of Aden, is gener- ally mountainous throughout its whole extent, though the high lands s ldom abut on the shores, which latter are generally low and sandy ; indeed the Red Sea may be con- sidered as the lower part of a valley bounded eastward by the high table-land of Arabia and westward by a range of mountains rising from 4,000 to 0,000 feet in height Be- ^nf ^ Sh0re 18 a leVel district of some g ene rally desti.

RENNIE SHOAI.— A shoal in the Persian Gulf, 54 miles north of Muharraq Island, in the Bahrain Archi pelago. It is situated in Lat. 27° 4' N., Long. 60° 42' E. and marks the place where tho shallow waters of Bahrain may be said to end. It was discovered by the E.I .C. schooner Constance, Lieutenant .1. Rennie, I.N., 1848, is a small shoa], I J miles long by 8 cables wide ; the bottom consists of sand with lumps of rock, the least water being 2^ fathoms. At one mile northward and eastward of the shoal, there are depths of 30 fathoms, and from 20 to 25 fathoms southward and westward, so that it forms a kind of outlier of the Great Pearl bank. It is a danger for vessels going between Bahrain and Bushire, or other places to the northward. Nothing was seen to indicate the shoal when it was passed over in a depth of 4^ fathoms. In 1897, H.M.S. Sphinx reported that a shoal of about 19 feet existed 2J miles S. h W. from the Rennie Shoal ; it was not then properly examined, but in 1903 H.M.S. Lapwing confirmed the existence and position of this shoal, and in 1906 the Ss! Warocnga, drawing only 15 feet, touched on it, showing that there is less water over- it than had been supposed. It is shown as 2h fathoms on the chart 2,8376. Depths of 5.1 and 6 fathoms have also been reported to exist over a considerable area some 20 miles east by north from the entrance to Bahrain harbour. There is a 3-fathom patch on the Ashirah bank S. by W. i W. 16 miles from the Rennie Shoal. In April 1907, Commander Heneage, H.M.S Hyacinth, reported a depth of 41 fathoms in approximately Lat. 26° 35' N. Long. 50° 53|' E. Depths of 4|, ^ and 0 fathoms, respectively, were found at U, 3, and 5 miles S. 33° W., and 7 fathoms 3i miles N. 33° E., from the position indicated above. It would appear therefore that the shoal with 4^ and 4| fathoms already charted from the report of the Commander of the R.I.M.S. Lawrence in 1898 is of greater extent than was supposed. RGHABAH— A village in the 'Aridh District {q. r.) of central Arabia. RGHABAH— A village near the boundary between Washam and 'Aridh, in central Arabia. Leach- man says that Rghabah is situated about 28 miles from Tharmidah on the route to Al- Barrah and that along that route the Arar hills end, towards the south, in a long crag from which Rghabah lies perhaps 2 miles to the north-east. According to the Persian Oul] Gazetteer, there is another village called Rghabah lying 18 miles east by north from Tharmidah ; see 'Aridh. These two villages are possibly identical.

The people are Maliki Sunni^, chiefly of the 'Utub tribe, but there are 3 houses of Kibisah, 4 of Na im and 3 of natives of Hasa. Most of them are engaged in the nale of drinking water at Manamah, whither they convey it on camels. The well Umm Ghuwaifah, in the water of which they traffic, is situated on the high plateau and ia considered by natives to be best in the island ; it is probably however not so pure beine practically in the village, as that of the Hanaini wells belonging to Rifa'-ash-Sharqi ' There are no dates or other trees or cultivation here. Animals include 8 horses, 35 donkeys and 7 cattle. This place and Rifa'-ash-Sharqi are the sanitaria of Bahrain. RIFA'-ASH-SHARQI— A large village of fortified aspect, with several watch towers, overlooking the central depression of Bahrain Island at its north-eastern corner ; it is 7 miles south of Manamah fort and occupies a dreary and barren site. It contains about 300 mud houses and two large masonry houses, one of which is occupied by Shaikh Khalid-bin- 'Ali borther of the ruling Shaikh of Bahrain, and the other by Shaikh Sabah-bin-Hamud, the oldest member ahve of the ruling family. In the middle of the village is the fine well of 'Ain Khalid, in which the water stands at 20 fathoms below the ground level. Close to the village, beneath the cliffs that enclose the central depression, are the wells of Hanaini The inhabitants of Rifa-ash-Sharqi are Maliki Sunnis, and may be classified as follows : 'Utub, 170 houses ; natives of Hasa, 60 houses ; free negroes, 20 houses • and slaves living apart from their masters, 50 houses. The place is in the jurisdiction of Shaikh Khalid. Most of those who are not members of the ruling family live by purvey ing drinking water at Manamah.

RIYADH— The most important town in southern Najd, central Arabia ; it is nearly 2,000 miles south-east of 'Anaizah in QasTm and the same distance west-south-west from Hofuf, in Hasa. The name Riyadh is the plural of Raudhah, meaning not only a garden but any moist hollow in which vegetation grows. From being merely the centre of Wahhabi influence it has become the seat of government of 'Abdul 'Aziz-as-Sa'ud and the capital of the vast dominions over which he now holds sway. Riyadh and its environs lie in a depression which is about 100 feet below the surrounding country, with a length from north to south of about two miles. At its1576 RYI—EOB RIYAM— A hamlet in the Masqat District {q. v.), of the Sultanate of 'Oman. RIYAM (B ani)— Singular Riyami. A somewhat peculiar tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate, found chiefly in 'Oman Proper, but also in Jabal Akhdhar and in the upper villages of some of the valleys in the seaward slopes of Hajar. In 'Oman Proper their settlements are Izki (450 houses), Kamah (20 houses). Karsha (20 houses), Manah (140 houses), Birkat-al- Moz (250 houses), Muti (300 houses), Nizwa (500 houses), Tanuf (40 houses)[and Zikait (15 houses); in Jabal Akhdhar they have Sharaijah (100 houses) and Saiq (CO houses)- in Wadi Bani Khariis they are found at Misfah (100 houses), and in Wadi Mistal Hi jar (50 houses), and Qorah (40 houses). Those of Saiq belong to a section called Jawamid, and those of Misfah to a section called Sharaiqiyin. The 'Azur of Khashbat 'Azur in the Baldan-al-Habiis division of the Sharqiyah District are believed to be con nected with the Bani Riyam. The Bani Riyam are said to be of Yamani descent and are reputed to have been among the earliest Arab settlers in 'Oman ; but they are now attached to the Ghafiri political faction. In religion they are Ibadhis; none of them are Bedouins. They are a large tribe of perhaps 11,000 souls, well-to-do and peaceably inclined, but those of the hills do not bear a good reputation among the people of 'Oman generally, who regard them as irascible, slothful, immoral and wanting in hospitality; the prejudice against them may be partly due to their disregard of Muhammadan principles in dinkinga wine which they themselves manufacture from home-grown grapes.

Eastward of 'Anaizah the Wadi Dukhnah joins the main valley. According to Huber, this wadi rises in Jabal Khazaz, and trending northwards, passes near Qasr-al-'Aqali in the neighbourhood of Jabal-al-'Abal, which is apparently some 12 *or 14 miles to the north-east of Ablah. In leaving Qasim Wadi-ar-Rummah seems to take temporarily a more northward direction, for it is reported to pass between Sarif and Rakaiyah. From Qasim downwards the valley preserves its general north-easterly direction and perhaps bears the comprehensive name of Batin ; but some distinguish the portion lying in the Dahanah as Wadi-al-Mustawi and call only the remainder Batin or Batain, Of the section between Qasim and the frontier of Kuwait little is known except that at Thu- wairat, about 50 miles below 'Anaizah, the valley is blocked by a great natural dam con sisting of sand dunes ; that it is a route of caravans from and to the north, and that it contains a few halting places with a little water, the most important politically being that of Hafar, about 160 miles west-south-west of Kuwait Town. ' ' , Except in time of flood Wadi-ar-Rummah is dry. Great floods do not occur on the average more than twice or thrice in a century, and the Wadi, even when the Avater rises, can be crossed by camel riders except where the stream is confined. The last great flood was about 1838, when the waters pent up bj' the Thuwairat dam washed back towards 'Anaizah and formed a lake of about 200 square miles which remained for two years and attracted many water-fowls not seen before, -within the memory of man, in Central Arabia.

In the foregoing table a few unimportant and uninhabited islands are omitted, of which the native names have not been ascertained with certainty. Administration. —Ruus-al-Jibal is a district in the Sultanate of 'Oman. The Sultan is represented by a Wali who has his seat at Khasab, in the article on which his position is described. The district brings in no revenue to the Masqat exchequer and it prob ably does not even pay for its own administration— if the slight political supervision exercised by the Wali may be called by such a name. The amount annually collected by the Wali as Zakat is about $600, and the present Sultan of 'Oman (Saiyid Faisal) has in addition, out of his own private property, assigned him at Khasab a date planta tion and land of the value of §1,000 annually. RUWA— Some wells in Hushum {q.v.), in the Hasa district of eastern Arabia.

RUWAHAH (BANI)— Singular Ruwahi or Ruwaihi. This important tribe of Hajar In the Sultanate of ' 'Oman are said to be of Nizari descent, but they are now attached to the Hinawi political faction ; in religion they are Ibadhis. Their principal seat is the upper part 'of the Wadi Samail, called Wadi Bani Ruwahah, which they entirely monopolise, and where they have about 900 houses ; but they also inhabit the lower villages of 'Adhdah 50 houses), Rissah (II) (20 houses), Rufai'ah (80 houses), Qarwashiva'h (50 houses), Naghzah (50 houses), Suharah (100 houses), Hijrat Wilad Sa'ad (50 houses), Jammar (75 houses), Hijrat-al-Bakriyin (100 houses), Ibrahimiyah (40 houses). Bait Walad-al- Khalili (100 houses), Dighal (100 huses), Subarah (50 houses), Daqdaqain (20 houses) and Tasawir (25 houses).

In Wadi Mistal, on the northern side of the Western Hajar hills, they occur at Ghubrat Bani Ruwahah (40 houses) and Hail (40 houses). The greater part of Wadi 'Andam belongs to them and the whole of Wadi Mahram. Their total number is perhaps 18,500 souls. The Bani Ruwahah are a troublesome tribe ; they were consistently adversaries of the Sultan of Oman during the reign of Turki (1871-88) and are supposed to be still very hostile to the ruling power ; but they can be subsidised when necessarv, and in 1905 the Sultan made use of them Against the Bani Riyam of Izki and Birkat-al-Moz.

RUWI— An important though small village at the south end of the Saih-al-Harmal plain, in the Masqat district of the Sultanate of 'Oman. It lirs about a mile up a small valley of its own, which is a right bank tributary of Wadi 'Adai and is distant about 3J miles by a good track from Matrah and 4| miles by a mountain path from Masqat. There are 12 mud and 41 palm-branch huts in the village, most of them being at present (1915) empty ; the population is 60 souls, namely 21 men, 20 women, and 19 children, mostly of the 'Awamir and Bani Wahaib tribes. There are 8 wells which supply w ater both for drinking and irrigation. A line of falajs runs from Ruwi to Bait-al-Falaj, a distance of about 1J miles. The distance from the surface of the ground to the surface of the water in these wells in from 45 to 50 feet, the depth of the water itself being between 5 and 10 feet. Ruwi used to be a market-garden for Matrah and Masqat, but now only a strip of ground about 800 yards long and 150 yards wide is under cultivation, the crops being usually lucern, millet, and grass, in about equal quantities. There are 340 date palms and half a dozen lime trees. Some of the palm trees are the private property of His Highness Saiyid Taimur, Sultan of Masqat. Two small shops in the village supply the inhabitants with flour, rice, and their other small requirements, the total value of the stock in the two shops aggregating less than Rs. 30 as a rule. Live stock comprises 44 bullocks, 11 cows, 9 donkeys, 17 goats, and 8 sheep ; and there are 40 cocks and hens. A reference to the article on the Masqat district will show that Ruwi is the point from which all the routes from Matrah to the interior diverge, and this fact has more than once invested it with military importance when rebellious tribes were threaten ing an attack on Masqat. There is a large watch-tower in the foot-hills at the south eastern corner of the village resembling the smaller fortifications at Masqat.— (Murphy).

Zuwaidat At FailTyeb .. 400 Small bodies of Zuwaida are found planted as police guards on the Karun, e. g., at Rahwali and QajarTyeh, where there are permanent posts, and sometimes at the Marid creek and in the Umm-al-Wawiyeh tract. The Muhaisin in 'Iraq appear to belong almost entirely to the Bait Kana'an v section. The Abu Hamreh in Northern 'Arabistan, who arc said to have 200 fighting men and to frequent the country south of the Haddam towards its source, are considered by some to be a section of the Muhaisin ; but others class them as Hamaid. The Al Bu 'Atuwi section of the Bavvlyeh were originally Muhaisin and in some respects still belong to the tribe. The fighting strength of the Muhaisin proper in Persian territory would appear from the table above to be about 6,000, and the present Shaikh of Muhammareh estimates it at double that number ; but a computation by settlements gives the total number of Muhaisin in Persia as about 12,000 souls only. It is estimated that about two-thirds of the fighting men of the tribe are armed with rifles and that about one-sixth of the total muster are provided with horses. Mode of life and character. —The Muhaisin in Persia are a settled, but not altogether sedentary, tribe, having their permanent headquarters in the Muhammareh District; at their homes they are cultivators of dates, but they also grow wheat and barley upon both banks of the Karun as far up as Moran and even in the vicinity of Wais. Their custom is to leave the Muhammareh neighbourhood in November for their grain lands on the Karun ; in February, after sowing these, they return to Muharnmareh to fertilise their dates ; in May they revisit the Kama to reap their crops of wheat and barley ; in Juno or July they reappear at Muhammareh in expectation of the date harvest, which begins at the middle of July. The Muhaisin own many sheep and goats, some cattle and a few buffaloes; when they return from the Ahwaz to the Muhammareh District they leave part of their flocks in charge of sections of the Pawiyeh tribe. Tn religion, except some of the Bait Gha iim, who are Sunnis, the Muhaisin are all Shi'ah Muhammadans. They are described as a cheerful and lazy race, thoroughly amenabls to tribal custom and authority. Origin, history and 'political 'position. —The Muhaisin are said to be descended from a certain man whose name was Muhaisin and from his son-in-law Kasib (pronounced Cha^ib). TradiLion represents these individuals as belonging to a tribe of the Muham mareh District whom the encroachments of their nslghbr.urs the Ka'ab compelled to emigrate and to settle on the Tigris under the name of Al Husain Pasha. Muhaisin and Kasib, however, having purchased land near the site of the present town of Muham mareh from the Ka'ab, returned with some followers to their native country and founded the Muhaisin tribe, of which the headship has remained vested in the house of Kasib. The later authentic history of the Muhaisin is included in that of 'Arabistan. Hero it is enough to observe that on the conclusion of the Anglo-Persian war in 1857 Haji Jabir, then head of the tribe, was recognised by the Persian Government as Shaikh of Mtihammareh in his own right and with plenary powers ; the Shaikhship up to that time hai been held by him merely as nominee of the Ka'ab Shaikh. Shortly afterwards,MUH—MUH 1253 the Shaikh ct the Ka'ab having been deported to Tehran, the Fallahiyeh District wa« f placed in charge of his Mnhaisin rival; and, except dnrine one short interval from 1860 to 1862, the heads of the Ka'ab tribe have ever since been in subordination to the Shaikh of the Muhaisin, or as he is now generally called, the Shaikh of Mnhammareh.* Afc the present time the Muhaisin, in consequence of the authority wielded by their head over all the districts of Southern 'Arabi?tan, may be regarded, though still outnumbered by the Ka'ab, as the paramount tribe in all that region. MUHAISIN— See 'Anaizah tribe ; Pahamishah sub-division of the 'Amarat. This clan must not be contused with the great Muhaisin tribe of southern 'Arabistan.

The entries range from short descriptions of one or two sentences to longer entries of several pages for places such as Iraq and Yemen.A brief introduction states that the gazetteer was originally intended to deal with the whole of Arabia, "south of a line drawn from the head of the Gulf of 'Aqabah, through Ma'an, to Abu Kamal on the Euphrates, and to include Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats" and notes that before the gazetteer could be completed its publication was postponed and that therefore the three volumes that now form this file simply contain "as much of the MSS. [manuscript] as was ready at the time". It further notes that the contents have not been checked.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023486173.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
