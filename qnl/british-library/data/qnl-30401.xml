To foreign Calcutta Muscat Jan. 18th. 1901. Sir, Priii,itfl41y in connection with the increasing practical difficulty which the adequate supply of Welsh coal to the Depots in these waters seems from time to tim^ to present and the very pronounced inferiority of the Indr dian article (of which the comparative consumption is said, to be from 30 to 40 per cent greater for the same speed ^ and distance) I have the honour to solicit the attention of the Government of India to the possibilities presented by the existence of coal in Oman as a convenient source of supply for our Mbtscat and Persian Gulf requirements. (2). The existence of coal in the Sultan's territory found mention in the Political Diary furnished weekly by this Agency, some two years ago in the following entry: May 22nd. 1898. ”Shaikh Mahamod bin Mubarack of the Jene- oeh of Soor has sent 50 bags of coal, about 5 tons, from Rafseh a few miles distant from Soor. H. H.'s Engineer pronounces it equal if not Superior to Welsh Coal, being entirely smokeless'. As the general question of coal supply was not then much in evidence, the above entry may possibly have escaped specific notice at the time, I venture therefore to revert to it. While at Soor recently I took the opportunity of . visiting the locality of Rafseh or rather Rufsheh, about 10 miles inland of Soor. It is easily reached from Soor by a good caravan road and the sheltered creek which sur*- rounds the pftrt of Soor offers every facility for export by Dhow&amp;. The only reason I believe why H.H.'s Seyyid 1 Teisul has not hitherto essayed to take it in hand is that he has little authority over the tribe inhabiting the lo-* cality, who maintain a toll gate on the caravan road in in the vicinity whereat they levy transit fees on every J laden animal that passes through, and would therefore vieu/10 , with suspicion and disfavour any civilised intrusion such as a trade in coal would bring, simply from the fea/^ of lobsing the income they at present derive from the above form of blackmail. I do not imagine however that their attitude would offer any serious difficulty and am of opinion that it might be got over by the Sultan sub siding them or giving them a royalty on the coal; or by his building a^?ort in the neighbourhood, of the inex pensive pattern common in Oman^and locating in it a garri son sufficiently strong to keep the tribesmen in hand. I may mention that there is no village of '’Rufsheh”, the name simply represents that particular portion of the Maritime Range. Judging from the aspect of this range there is no reason to suppose that the coal is likely to be limited in quantity. On the contrary, accor ding to my information it exists not only near Rufsheh but also at other points in the Range E.G. Kalhat about 20 miles further up the Coast. (3) . The idea of a coal-trade from this coast suggests advantageous possibilities in three directions:- (I) It would be an obviously convenient source of A supply for our coal Depots in these wafers. (II) IT would considerably improve the independent financial position of the Sultan (though this perhaps is not wholly an advantage from one poin£ of view). (III) It would be the means of shedding in some degree the light of civilisation and publicity upon the part of Soor, a spot which has hitherto borne a time-honoured and unenviable notoriety as the principal emporium for the supply of negro-sla ves to meet the demand for them in Eastern Arabia and the Persian Gulf. (4) . Apart from the above considerations more '-over the existence of coal in the Maritime Range behind Soor and the vicinity seems to have an indirect bearing on the Erench flag question, and in that connection to accentua te in no small degree the undesirability of our allow ing the French or any other Maritime power to raise acommunity of proteges and thus gain a footing and influ ence on that part of the Coast of Oman. T respectfully commend the question therefore to the attention of the Government of India, and beg to inquire whether it may not be advisable to come to some arrangement with the ' Sultan on the subject.

In case Government may consider the matter of suf ficient importance to make early action desirable,I ven ture to submit this communication direct, but shall duly forward a copy to the Resident by the next up mail.

M.'s Consul and Political Agent, MUSCAT; — Tiie Resident in the Persian. jQuIT. Dated Muscat, 12th June 1901. Sir, In my letter No.202 dated 29th May I had the honour to report my return to Muscat on 25th MaY in company with His Highness the Sultan and Dr-von-Krafft of the Geological Survey of India, and at the same time I mentioned briefly the result of his investiga tions, without prejudice however to the professional report which he will submit to Government in due course. (2). I now submit a further report of what passed du ring our sojourn in the neighbourhood of Soor, but &lt;°s the particulars given are more or less closely bound up with the far reaching Question of French iniluence in Oman I would request that what follows be accepted rather as a contribution to the record on the latter subject than as limited to the question oi the coal deposits near Soor. Before proceeding with the narrative I beg to invite reference to Para.S. of my letter N.lll dated 16th March last and to -observe that my reason for therein asking that the Geological expert ire ght do deputed to Muscat as soon after 1st April as jo^sible was that I realized the importance of our getting through the work before the end of April. Failing that it■that; the annual visit of the French Consul to Soon to toe expected atoout that time in the ordinary course of events might not improtoatoly rtosult in difficulties for us. Un- Soor luckly Mons. Ottavi reached ^ toeftore we did and as the se quel will show, the result was of the nature anticipated. Itinerary of Tour. (3). In the first place it will be well for me to explain that the coal-Dearing district near Rufsheh lies within the tribal limits of a small Hinawi clan by name 'Musharifeh' mustering from 500 to 600 fighting men. Being of little in dependent account owing to their numerical weakness they arc dominated in trioal matters and almost regarded as the vas sals of their more powerful neighbours the ’'Beni Abu Hassan', who inhabit the country in the neighbourhood of El Wafi a little further inland. Both these tribes belong to the great political division of 'Hinawi' (as opposed to 'Ghafiri') other powerful sections of which, such as the Harthi and Hejrieen, occupy what is known as the 'Sharkiyeh v district of Oman. The tribal affairs of the Hinawi collectively,i.e. in mat ters of national rather than sectional importance, are con ducted oy a number of representative Shaikhs from each com ponent part, meeting in council; and at present these coun cils are in a great measure swayed by Shaikh Aysa bin Saleh of the Harthi tribe supported by Hilal bin Amr and Mohsin bin Amr of the same tribe who are also related to him by m marriage. The first named of these three is the eldest son and successor of the Saleh oin Ali who organised and led the at ack on Muscat in 1895, and the mantle of the father as I Temimeh' or religious head of the Hinawi, has likewise des cended to the son. The names of the other two must I think oe familiar to yourself and Government as the subjects of a gold deal oi past corresT^ondence with Zanzioar from whence Hilal has but recently cut himself adrift. On previous occasions when the coal-deposits of the Mu- 0 sh&amp;rifeh country have become the subjects of attention inin any way the matter has not been considered of suffi cient tribal interest to be carried beyond the narrow cir cle of the Musharifeh themselves, who have more than once excavated a quantity of the coal and sold it without any interference from their neighbours. Similarly in the pre sent case it was confidently believed that we should only have the Musharifeh to deal with and with this view an aged and well disposed Shaikh of that tribe was summoned to Muscat by the Sultan and undertook to us through the locality. This individual,who was loyal to us through out, was himself well aware that our intentions were friend ly and harmless and assured the Sultan and myseli of his ability to guarantee the co-operation of his fellow trioes- u, e n in the matter. In addition to him the Sultan’s Wall (or fiovernor) of Soor, with a few sepoys from the garrison there, was instructed to accompany us on behalf of His Highness in order to make arrangements for our supplies and transport and to look after us generally. It was an ticipated that our work in the vicinity of Rufsneh would occupy perhaps the inside of a week and in that case I proposed if the Geologist did not find the heat too exces sive for field-work, to bring him back by land in order that he might obtain a general idea of the Geology of Oman and perhaps material lor a paper on the ■- This however was a secondary consideration which a^ matter turned out time and circumstances did not permit to take V . shape. (4). Dr-von Krafft arrived in Muscat on 10th April. On the 14th having previously received a telegram irom the dent in the Persian Gulf intimating in reply to a commu nication from myself R.I.M.S. 'Lawrence' could not no sparer; • o q +o when a British man- having likewise no information as . of-war might be expected and thinking it inexpedient, political reasons, to delay departure on the chance of one being sent, I arranged with the Kakhuda of a Kattywari Dhow to convey us and our following as xar as Kd ( 15 miles from Soor) where he proposed to take m a cargo of lime-pebbles and then continue his voyage to nwas not willing to convey us the whole way to Soon, but as a coal-seam had been reported near Kalhat we arranged to start inland from the latter place instead of from Soor. Owing to contrary winds we did not reach Kalhat until the fourth da/y April 17th. The trioesmen in the neighbouring hills proved to oe perfectly friendly; made no trouble about showing us all 4 - there was to be seen and did their best to make us welcome and to dispense such suoh village hospitality as they were ab/ * On 19th April,on our return to camp in the evening news reached us that the French Consul accompanied by his Drago man Abdul Aziz had arrived at Soor the day before in a French Cruiser and had been met at that port by a second man- of-war. Thinking that under these circumstances it would be advisable for us to get to Rufsheh with the least possible delay I decided to push on the following morning through the hills to the Musharifeh country. In due course, on 21st April we arrived at the Musharifeh village of Mislook about 10 miles inland of the port of 3oor. Here the reception we met with was just the converse of what we had experienced at Kalhat. Te learnt that divers reports emanating from Soor had already preceded us, setting forth our alleged sinister designs upon the people and the country and that these were readily belie ved by the ignorant villagers. The Musharifeh elder who ac companied us now found himself altogether discredited and abused for bringing us there and I even heard villagers in conversation with him openly threatening to cut our tents down if we attempted to put them up. Closer acquaintance how ever assisted by the appearance of the tfali of Soir who now arrived from the coast to join us, remedied matters in this respect, and the Mislook villages subsequently became our good friends. Soon after our arrival we were visited by the Musha rifeh elders who, be it noted, came to our camp not from their villages in the hills, but from Soor, whither according to the i .Vali they had been summoned by Aodul Aziz on the arrival of th# R.F. Tm.ernet a lew days oeiore and had been plied by him and the trench Consul with fantastic stories of our evil inten tions .They were even said to have received money presents to en- courage them to impede our progress. Be that as it may it atonce became evident that they meant to give trouble. Notwithstanding that we brought explicit official,letters from the Sultan which should ordinarily have been in them- selves quite sufficient to allay any suspicions which otheV wise they mig ’t at first have entertained; notwithstanding too that we accompanied by one of their own Shaikhs and that the Sultan was himself represented oy an important official in the Wali of Soor, they at first sullenly ex pressed themselves as altogether unwilling that we should lift their tribal ’’purdah” further. After a long parley with myself and the Wall they eventually pretended to have become personally disabused of their previous suspicions with regard to us but declared that there were some elders of theirs at outlying villages whom it was necessary ior them to worn and explain mattei's to and that having lone -that they would return in three days' time to escort us through their country. I feared much that ttyis was merely a ruse for gaining time to organise further opposition and had any Gunboat been available at Soor I should have asked her forthwith to return to Muscat and bring the Sul tan down for a day or two, in which case our difficulties could have been nipped in the bud, but in uhe ao.ren^^ o^. our ships at either port and with the ’Knowledge that for communication with Muscat^and the receipt of a reply 9orl0 days would be necessary, the only alternative seemed to be for us to make the best of things and to endeavour with the Wall's assistance to overcome the opposition by patient negociation. During the three days that now ensued several travellers from the interior halting or passing near our camp enroute to the coast informed us that alarming report* had gone forth by letter and messenger from Soor to a the Hinawi centres in front of us to the eiiect that Sey yid Deisul was in collusion with the British Government and contemplated handing over the port of Soor to the lattw; thatpur present object in prospecting for coal was in con-after inspecting the coal-deposits we intended to return oy land in order to fix upon an algnment for the said Railway furthermore the french Consul was alleged to have given out t that the sanctuary of french protection was open to all who w were oppressed oy the Sultan or the English;and with relerenc-c to the contemplated surrender of Soor to the latter he was said to have warned the Arab conmunity that the french Govern- 'U ment.in Oman ahl would certainly seize for themselves the same amount of territory that we took for ourselves. (5) Tne Musharifeh did not re-appear in person at the end of the stipulated period but informed us by a letter that their more powerful congeners the Beni Abu Hassan and the rest of the Hinawi had now become interested^!!! our movements and that the matter unfortunately passed beyond their control a. and must be left for the decision of their betters. Tn the meanwhile with a view tc make sure that we did not attempt to reach the coal locality secretly or by force they sounded their trioai tocsin,represented by an old brass field-piece which they keep in the watch-tower at Rufsheh, and assembled 150 or 200 riflemen in the vicinity to hold the road against us. The Beni Abu Hassan on the other hand wrote assuring me that they intended to be loyal to the Sultan and obedient to his orders with regard to us .and were much ashmed at the way we had been treated. They went on to explain that the Musharifeh were ordinarily almost their slaves but that Aysa oin Saleh, el Harthi, Hilal and Mohsin bin Amr and all the chief Shaikhs of the Hinawi, pretending that this simple matter was one for their interference, had flocked down from their country to the Beni Abu Hassan5settlement and wen£- r~ J t trying prevail upon them (the writers) to support the Musharm feh in turning us back, and had even endeavoured to enlist the assistance of the Ghafiri element (the hereditory eni- rnies of the Hinawi)- without any success however, finally they begged me to have confidence in their good faith Xn this matter and said that df their felloweountrymen conti nued to show contumely they were ready and willing to call' out their tribe and land us in the coal-bearing hills by force, after expelling the Musharifeh.They recommended however t/hat/ we should wait patiently for a few days more until the Hinawi Shaikhs had time to obtai'Tl answerSffrom the Sultan to letters they were now dispatching to him by soecial messengers and meanwhile they sent a party of 6 of their own elders to remain in attendance on us on behalf of the tribe. T received at the same time an equally friendly and cordial letter from the powerful G-hafiri Amir, Abdulla bin Salim, with whom I was previously well acquainted, informing me that he had indignantly rejected the mischievous overtures of the Hinawi and saying t] at he was a loyal subject of the Sultan and a friend of the English and was at all times ready to welcome me to his country and on the present occasion to escort us wberepver we wished to go. It appeared that the position taken up by the Hinawi $ Shaikhs at this stage was that they could not credit the letters which the Sultan had sent to them by us and that it was necessary for them either to see His Highness per sonally or failing that to receive certain assurances from him by the hand of the trusted messenger of their own whom they now proceeded to send to Muscat. They really hoped no doubt to levy black-mail from the Sultan on the one hand and on the other to rid themselves of us by pro tracting negociations as only an Arab shaikh, knows how. They evidently thought that by these means they would wear out patience and our supplies, camped as we were in a de solate spot with a simoom wind blowing daily as ii irom a furnace and they oeing well aware that owing to the ao sence of our man-of-war from Muscat vVaters the arrival of the Sultan was very problematical. (6) During this long wait at Mislook, on the night oi 5th May, Hilal bin Amr El Harthi (referred to in para 5th sup ra) rode through from El Vafi to Soor and the lolloping morning had a long interview with the French Consul, who subsequently took hirn^on board the R.F. Internet . Ijater the day having put Hilal on shore again Mons. Ottavi and the French Cruiser left for Muscat from whence the former dispatched a long telegram to his H oieign Otfice.On the 10th the 'Tnfernet' returned again to Soor and Hilal ; having had a further interview with Mens. Ottavi left imme diately 'k° re ^°^ n Hinawi conference at El Watie . It was ~nrrinrtj'tj.h'f reported at the time that his ooject in journeying to Soor had been to inquire from the French Con sul whether, in the event of the Hinawi resisting ourselves and the Sultan forcibly, they would receive any support from the French and to what extent. What truth there was in this jj report it is impossible to say, but it is certain that Hilal did not make the tedious journey for nothing. By the 10th May | the Hinawi had received their reply from the Sultan but still pretended not to be satisfied with it and it became more than ever evident that nothing short or his arrival in person could bring the matter to a peaceable conclusion, and as 1 f had no certain inforimation as to the prooability oi a man- of - war arriving at Muscat in the nee-r future and did no i, expect that the Sultan could get to us by any other means au this season, we decided to shift camp to more shady quarters at Bilad-es-Soor (a collection of date-gardens about 4 miles inland of the port) and there to%ait his arrival in one of ^ ships. Meanwhile the Hinawi Shaikhs remained in conclave at El Wafi^and the Musharifeh tribesmen continued to watch the approaches to the coal locality. T should mention here that at any stage of the proceedings up to this point we could have reached the goal with little personal risk to ourselves simply by accepting the armed assistance either of the Beni Abu Hassan or the Ghafiri Amir, Abdulla bin Salim. The former repeatedly pressed me to allow them to take the Musharifeh in hand and clear the way for us, and the Ghafiri chief again invited us to join him in the Beni Abu Ali country and allow himjbo escort us to the coal-ground in force from that side. To have adopted either of these courses how ever would in all probability have resulted in a certain amount of bloodshed and have started tribal conflagrations which it might have been difficult to extinguish or foresee the end of, I therefore felt that I was not warranted in lending myself to them.At the same time I gave out that while we had started on a mission which was intended to be friendly and peaceable we were none the less bent upon carrying it through and had plenty of time at our disposal. ( 7 ).Two days?after our change of camp the Sultan, accompa nied by his son Taimoor and his usual following, unexpec tedly joined us via Kalhat, whither the Agency burgeon had arranged for the Mailsteamer Kilwa to convey him. Uniortu- nately His Highness arrived on the scene without any 01 the sinews of* war, for during his disembarkation Irom tbe steamer outside Kalhat 3 bags of money containing 3000 dol lars and a heavy case of cartridges went to the bottom in some 50 fathoms of water. It was ostensibly an accident but the fact that when the Sultan and his lollowing were s settling themselves down on board the Mailsteamer in Mus cat Harbour, Monsieur Ooguyer also went on board and was noticed by the Agency Surgeon to be suspiciously busy with some of His Highness’s retainers raises the suspicion that some person or persons may possibly have been bribed to bring this very incovenient accident about. Seyyid 5’eisul however bore the loss very philosophically and good temperedly and sent hurriedly back to Muscat for a further supply, which arrived inpne course. Meanwhile written negociations proceeded and the news of the Sultan’s sudd.en arrival, which the Hinawi never exported, &lt;uid his thorough identification of himself with our mission gave them little excuse for further open .obstruction and Aysa bin Saleh now wrote that in deference to Seyyid Feisul’s wishes he and his companions would return to their country and leave the Musharifeh to come to what arrangement they pleased. Accordingly on 17th May we started from Bilad- es-Soor for the Wadi Rufsheh, a long procession of about 60 camel riders, including our own party, th. Sul complement and an escort of Beni Abu Hassan elders. Seyyid ,-eisul was anxious to come with us in person, out T would not listen to this as it did not appear safe for him to risk his person within reach of such old enemies as Aysa, oin baleh and 'the sons oi Ami.I His Highness was represented however toy his son Taimoor and the ’7ali of Soor. We hoped that our difficulties were now nearly at an end tout such was far from toeing the case. Atoout an hour after passing the Rufsheh Tower the long cavalcade moving in single file came to a halt and one of the leading files rode back and reported that Aysa toiipSaleh and a strong party of Musharifeh were in front and wished to parley. After representatives from both parties had according to cus tom advanced and exchanged formalities a halt was called and a long palaver ensued in the Wadi toed. Aysa now alleged that the Musharifeh were still unwilling to let us visit their coal- seams but that he was using his influence and hoped eventually to bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion. It was noted however that he had taken the precaution to meet us at a place where the path passed through in deep^'orge ^he high banks of which were lined by a number of Musharifeh riflemen, and the real fact of the matter was believed to toe that on hearing that we had actually started out for the Musharifeh hills with Seyyid Taimoor ect, Aysa and his confederates had determined to go back from their promise and to stay their ground in the hope of being able to encourage the Musharifeh to further con tumacy. At any rate the result was that we were ooliged to bi vouac where we were^the Beni Abu Hassan and ourselves in one place and Aysa bin Saleh, his two brothers.with whom were HilaJ and Mohsin bin Amr and the other Hinawi Shaikhs, atoout &amp; half a mile away and the next four days were then wasted in the same exasperating negociations as those of which we had previously oeen the victims. I should explain here that since the Sul tan's arrival on the scene I had placed myself and Dr.von Krafft in his hands and ceased to ha,ve any direct dealings with,any of the Shaikhs. Similarly now that Seyyid Taimoor and the Wali of Soor were representing His Highness I did not enter personally into the negociations, in order that it might not be said if they failed, that it was toy reason of my interference. It will toe realised however that though the interv tions oi Seyyid Taimoor and the ‘.7a 1 i were of the best their efiorts were oi little avail against the cunning duplicity oi A;ysa bin Saleh ana his confreres Hilal and Mohsin.(8). Tn the meanwhile however news reached us of the arri val of a British man-of-war at Soor and this news worked for good and at last on 22nd May after several false starts information reached us that the Musharifeh had now thrown up the sponge and sent in their elders to express their readiness to admit us. They did not venture however to (xJh our camp out joined the Hinawi. A little later a depu^ion came over to Seyyid Taimoor's quarters and debate followed t beween our own representatives and the Beni Aou Hast.an on A the one side and the Hinawi and Musharifeh on the other at which it was agreed to make us the following offer:- That on the understanding that we should not require to remain out on the ground for more then two complete ^ays a representative party of elde 1 ^ consisting of 2, Harthi(’Aysa's brother and Mohsin bin Amr ) 2, Hejrieen, 2, Beni Abu Hassan, 2, Musharifeh, should escort us to the coal deposits, and that while there we should be at liberty to go where we pleased and do what we liked in pursuit of Dr. von Krafft’s inve s tigations. This offer we formally accepted and messengers wane there upon sent out by the Musharifeh Shaikhs to inform their tribesmen that this amicable arrangement had been arrived at and that they could now disperse. An hour or so later, taking with us food and water sufficient for two day's requirements, we set out about 40 persons in all to the scene of operations. The path wandered tortuously in and out of the hills and the going was slow owing to the great heat. We had been marching thus for some time v.hen sudden lyas our long cavalcade rounded the spur oi a hill and touched into a oroad open Wadi we were xired at ir0I1 ‘ c ° n overhanging cliff about 4oo yards away. As once shot -ol lowed another and struck unpleasantly ne^r us, Dr. von Kraf ft and I who were riding together a,bout the centrethe cavalcade quickly dismounted and took the best cover we could find among the boulders that stre wed the wadi bed. The other members of the party hurriedly scattered or did likewise. Fortunately no human damage was done but the horse which my companion had been riding had its leg broken by a oullet a few moments after he had dismounted and taken cover. Alter some twenty or thirty rifles had thus been emptied at us, and after much shouting and waving of handkerchiefs on the part of our escort the firing ceased and in the course of It « time the oody of tribesmen responsible for the scare, appar ently about 100 in number, trooped down from the bluii and assembled in the nullah, and a few minutes later two or throe of the chiefs of them came over to us. They were m su | such a state of extreme excitement that it was difficult to obtain from them any coherent explanation 01 the lining, ouu the substance of their protetations was that it was all a mi take and they begged us to think nothing more of it and to 1 let them now take us on to the coal-deposits which were said to be close at hand . Subsequently when matters had cooled down a little and made deliberate inquiry possible two coloul- able solutions of the incident were lorth coining. The first was that these unfortunate villa,ges had been kepo out days on theilM.nhospitable hills by Aysa bin Saleh and /i * their Shaikhs on a very short allowance for food and water.+ When then they suddenly received orders from their elders to the effect that the matter had now been amicably arranged and that they were accordingly to disperse they felt that had been imposed upon and put to privations for nothing^or moT* probably for the private profit of their Shaikhs which they had not oeen allowed to share.and the more excitable among them could not resist emptying their rifles at our cavalcade or &gt;fore they dispersed, hoping to make things unpleasant f teir deceives. e other explanation.. was that Aysa bin Salehand Hilal bin Am reing that the Musharifeh were tired of the game and failing » get them to hold out any longer ha,d. whileprofessing to be pa,rties to the auiicable arrangement arrived at, had secretly persuaded a few bad characters among them to deliver this Parthian shot at us, and had auietly waited where we had left him, to hear the result. That they were quite capable of having done so I have not the least doubt but am inclined to think that the former solution is the more probable. In any case it was apparent to us that the Shaikhs actually v with us had not been parties to the treachery for they were exposed to the same risk as we were, and as we ran just as much further risk in going backwards as forwards and were presumably close to our goal we decided to go on. At the same time we discounted the chances of the treachery as much as possible by disarming the two principle Mushari- feh Shaikhs and making them walk one infront of each of us with the warning that on the next shot being fired ea,oh would have a oullet in him. (9). Although up to now every one from whom we had nade in quiries regarding the seams of coal had told that there we^a 3or 4 different places where it was exposed and in one cas£&gt; the whole stratum lay on the surface of a plateau and could oe got at without any excavation, the Musharifeh now decla red that the smallyseam which they proceeded to show us was the only one they knew of. It was evident however that this was false for the small seam in question had hardly De en if at all touched by the spade and in any case could not have supplied the 8f&gt;r 9 tons of coal which have in alt reached Muscat from the locality. By the time Itt» Krafft had taken a number of samples from this seam and we had further explored the nullah in which it occurred night was approaching and we had to return to omr bivouac. Our faithless Hinawi escort now did their utmost to get us away from the ground at once insisting that we must have seen all there was to be seen and that ther^ «»s dang in spending the night in these hills, we however had good reason to think that it was^regard for their own personal comfort rather than the existence of any danger that promp ted their attitude and expressed our intention of going outagain in the morning, which in due course we did. Dr. von Krai’ft then found the samastratum of coal which we had examin^^ .&gt; v on the previous evening re-appearing in^adjoining ravine and proceeded to make trifling excavations in two or three places to enable him to trace the course of the j$Q#*seam. This was a labour of some time and meanwhile the sun was get ting high and hot and the elders who accompanied us who were sitting in the shade of the main nullah some 400 yards away rropotionally impatient. They continually importuned us to As have done with our labours^ both on account of the heat and oecause as they alleged the Musharifelidiad not bargained ior our digging operations might give trouble again. vVe were little K disposed to listen to this as several Musharifeh who had been at our bivouac the night before assured our servants that they had only been put up to oppose us by their Shaikhs and now tha£' we had arrived they hoped we would stay as long as we liked, and we accordingly went on with our work, Seyyid Taimoor and the Ifalijbeing with us at the time. A few minutes later we heard 7 or 8 shots fired, not at us or from within view, but apparently coming from th/ direction of the main nullah where the numbers of our escort, were sitting. Soon one of their number came running up with the story that the Musharifeh had become annoyed at our digging and had started to the tops.of the hills again to take the offensive; that their Shaikhs having seen them went to remonstrate^with them and that they fired the shots heard, without however doing any harm. Our own belief was that the whole story was a fabrica tion as not only had we not seen the vestige of a hostile Mu sharifeh but on the contrary two of them had been in our com pany helping us £ig. In all probability the Hinawi themselves fired the shots as a means of effecting what their importunities could not, and having fired had then quickly wiped out their ri fles. Seyyid Taimoor however now began to get alarmed on our account and begged us to desist and we too felt that whether this last incident had been the doing of our own people or of hostile Mushariieh there seemed in either case no chance ofo^tArJ pvvXfyv oeing left to go on with our work in peace and that present A,conditions it was impossible that any really satisi'actory geological investigations could be crried out. Dr. von Krafft had at all events seen enough to enable him to gauge the quality of the coal and form some idea as to the probability or there being more of it. Accordingly we de termined to return that evening to our bivouac in the .Vadi J'i ' ■ OO' 0:t in f.. •X.i) i •« Delej and the next morning we rejoiced the Sultan at Bilad- es-Soor. By this time H.Mis.” Assaye ” had joined the I ' Cossack ' of Soor and having ridden down to the coast A to confer with the Captain of the latter it was arranged oet-ween us that the Assaye ' should convey the Sultan back to Muscat as so &gt;n as he was ready. I had now been ab sent from Muscat 6 weeks and heard from my locum tenens tnat a good of work ha.d in the meanwhile accumulated. Moreover the weather had become excessively trying and the Sultan's followers and our' own stale and fever stricken; we decided therefore after talking over the matter with the Sultan to forego the intention of marching back to Muscat, and return the following day in the ' Assaye ’^previously reported. (10). I fear the foregoing narrative will prove tedious reading but I notice that some details have already ap peared in the Indian dailies and others have been communi cated in my absence by the Agency Surgeon, it seems advis able therefore that the G-overnment of India should have th€s main facts from me first hand. Having recorded them T beg to offer a few observations by the way ox comment on the incidents set forth as a whole. I was periectly well aware from the outset that had it been a question oi the Sultan landing us at the coal-deposits by force in the lace of th£ opposition of the Hinawi, His Highness was not in a posi tion to undertake the step, out at the time we started lor Soor both he and I had good grounds for thinking that our investigation could be carried out ^ I ^ :L h aDl / and would not involve Musharifeh Shaikhs who accompanied us and the expenditure of 200 dollars or so in presents by myself at the conclusion of our investigations. There was absolutely no reason for either of us to suppose thrvt our mission would oe made the occasion or the excuse lor a 5S) j mam general Hinawi movement and Instill of the opinion that out J : for the sinister report^,which coincident with the arrival o± - the French Consul at Soor were promulgated in advance of us we should have got through our work quietly in three or ! our days without any more difficulty or risk than we had anticipated. ) Having once arrived on the scene and delivered our letters from the Sultan in which our mission and his approval and co operation were frankly set forth it would have been obviously damaging to the Sultan's prestige and our own had we allowed ourselves to be turned from our purpose. Moreover Monsieur Ottavi conveniently situated as he was would have been quick to make capital out 01 our failure and to take credit to himself among his clientele in those parts for having given them timely warning of and saved them from a, national danger. As we did eventually arrive at our desti nation without the employment of any force the question ol loss of prestige can hardly arise; on the other hand I fear the geological results obtained willbe disappointing Irom their inc omp1etene s s. (11). The attitude of the Sultan during the events above nar rated which I think put him somewhat severely to the test, was marked throughout by the fullest identification of him self with the interests of the British Government and by com- pjete personal loyalty to its representative. During the time that I was absent and letters were passing between himself and his subjects with regard to Dr. von Krafft and myself, every thing he wrote to them he sent open to me to close and forward, and later when we met he should me all the communications he had received from them, from among which I attach translation \ of a some what interesting specimen. ( Enclosure No. 2 ) In one of his letters replying to a communication upbraiding him for allowing us into the country he wrote in these terms:- ,f The British Consul and his friend not only have my approval M in going where they like and doing as they wish ^'they are ae / M acting in my behalf and in my interests*but even if they were 'there only by the wish ol the British Government my orders woul^ ” be the same. If it was not for the British Government the Kingdom of Oman and I would have ceased to exist and I wouldnot rex use anything they ask of me. M ( At the very time c / N i J 12°) Seyyid Feisul writing thus, he was being overwhelmed by visits of French men—of-war and lavish French presents, and in the absence oi any sign of the moral support of our ships did not know from one day to another what de mands they would not make of him and to what extent they were not simultaneously undermin^ing his authority at Soor* When he subsequently joined me near Soor his attitude was ‘ equally satisfactory, and not once nor twice did T hear him and his son Tairnoor express in open debate with various Shaikhs the same sentiments that prompted his letters. Supposed French Connection. With the recent hostile attitude of the Hinawi together with some observations on the general question of the French Flag and influence in Oman as it appears from recent light thrown on it.u (12).While endeavouring to make due allowance for the bias of my surroundings,! can come to no other opinion that the difficulties x'ecently experienced by Dr. von Krafft and myself were due in the first instance to the specific ef forts of the French Consul and Abdul Aziz on arrival at Soor a few d.ays before us and in the second place, indire ot~ ly, to the effect of the systematic dissemination for the last year and a half among the Shaikhs of ^ the Sharkiiyeh of the notorious ' Hye-opener ' leaflet, which has acted as an effective fertilizer to a naturally productive soil and made of it a ready field for the crop of calumny which our errand in the neighbourhood o^Soor put it in my French colleaguefs power to sow. From the moment that we arrived at Mislook on 21st April French connection with what was passing formed the cons tant theme of conversation between individuals or groups of Arabs of which I was often an unsuspected listener, but the reports of letters and messengers which were trom time to time alleged to be passing between the French Consulate and the Hinawi Shaikhs were I am aware often unreliable . i m i I'Mand I have tiherefore no^ wish that* should be haken into account 4 i.bsence 01 ' actual proof which is not at present forthcoming. The following items of circumstantial evidence however are dilfc- cult to ignore. (a). On 5th May a stormy interview took place outside but withjrt hearing of our camp between the 2 chief. Shaikhs of the Mushari.*- feh and the friendly Beni Abu Hassan elders who had attached themselves to us, during which the latter vehemently swore that they would call,out their tribe and take us to the coal- grounds by force if the Musharifeh continued to obstruct us. The Musharifeh replied frankly and confidently that if either the Sultan or the Beni Abu Hassan attempted to use any force t urv towards them, on our account they would straightway take the protection and assistance of the French Consul and his ship. It is not reasonaoly conceivable that a weak clan like the Musharifeh in ^discussion with shaikhs of the tribe in whose protection and friendship their whole wellbeing ordinarily lies would adopt such a def&amp;lnt tone unless they had been giv^^rz, some specific grounds for believing that they could carry their threat into execution. (d). The fact of their having listened to French intrigues and false reports of our intentions, and the prevailing impression that any one who wanted it could obtain French projection ior the asking formed the subject of discusstand I believe correspondence,between Seyyid Feisul and various tribal shaikh^ with whom he had dealings. (c) . The fact that intercourse took place between Hilal bin and the French Consul during the time that we held up at A Mislook is beyond question as is also the fact that when the W Yali of Soor journed to FI IVafi on 28th April to interview the Hina-wi shaikhs on our be&amp;alf Hilal was their chosen spokes man • (d) . The nature of the reports spread among the tribes of the Sharkiyeh and the arguments used by Aysa bin Saleh in adjurin the Sultan to keep us out of the country were simply an echo of the sentiments and allegations pervading Mons. G-oguyer's contributions to the French press and the Arabic leafletIf Bye Opener ' during the past year. (15). In the latte^onnection I may mention in reference to Foreign Dept. Telegram IJ0.II66E.A. dated 4th June 1900, that although the action then taken oy Govt, caused a tem porary cessation 01 the arrival of the leaflets in Muscat it was not long beiore the authors found other methods of getting them here in square private envelopes bearing Indian stamps and posted from Bussorah and elsewhere, and thus difficult of detection. A specimen accompanies ( Enclosure 5.(a).) One batch of 'Bye Openers actually arrived at Soor and reached several persons oi the Sultan s suite while His Highness was in camp at Bilad—es-Soor and Dr. von Krafft and I were in difficulties further inland. In this particular issue there was a pregnant and opportune article regarding British designs on Soor and the neighbourhood. It is as follows ** Muscat and Soor. 'The British Government is as covetous as ever of the soil ' of the Arabs and their Consul Captain Cox ceases not to //devote all his energies to the acquisition of (British) tfisway over the territory of Oman. He is especially bent upon ' placing his grip upon Soor and the neighbourhood. ' The author then goes on to give an imaginary version of my visit to Soor of January last, ( when I went for two days to a criminal ca,se). The article concluded with the news that the French Government were sending up ' a large Ironclad the ' Internet ' for the protection of ' their subjects ' who own Dhows flying the French Flag, and that the Russian Government also intended sending men-of-war to the Gulf to safeguard the interests of Russian trade. Since my return to Muscat two more issues have arrived curl as will be seen from Enclosure No. 5. (b)&amp;(c) these are en closed in envelopes of the original pattern and are addres&gt;u^ among others to Hilal and Mohsin bin Amr, the very men 1 who have been so intimately concerned with our recent di± ficulties.Turning now t,o 'the question of the , (14). Soor Flags and recalling:- what happened in this connect tion last year and the promises understood to have been then isf-' made by the French Foreign Office to Her Majesty's Govt., I be| to reiterate the fact that there has been no attempt on their ] partduring the 12 months that have since elasped to discuss any ’’disputed” case with the Sultan. On the contrary His Highness has had visits from 5 French men-of -war the first of which made every possible effort to threaten and frighten him out oi the attitude he had taken up towards the flag question general* ly. When nothing resulted from this police the French Consul reversed his tactics, and while on the one hand he adopted a a markedly conciliatory attitude and dropped all unpleasant subjects in his intercourse with the Sultan, on the other hand he set himself by every means in his power so to work matters in connection with Soor, that at the end of the stipulated period the original holders of French Articles and flags instead of returning to the Sultan's allegiance as promised, might come to him for a renewal of their artic1es. In furtherance of his object €)ach Frenctynan-of-war, after visiting Muscat^and closing the Sultan's mouth with expensive p presents and ceremonial visits of a nature surpassing anything our own ships have ever done in this respect has then gone down to Soor and made much of His Highness's disaffected subjects there and given much repeated promises of complete protection. &amp;cL Recently when the time approach for the Soori Dhows to return from Zanzibar Monsiuer Ottavi proceeded to Soor accompanied by the Cruiser 'Internet” which remained with him there for a month, and during this month the lavishness with which the for mer has been entertaining all and the boldness with which he ) has be n signing the attractions of French protection has be n a mater of much wonder and comment. I now learn that on his return from Soor (where he still is) he is to leave Muscat either on forlough or transfer: and it i is difficult to come to any other conclusion than that he has been specifically ordered by his Government, trusting in our present inertness, to push the flag question to the utmost limit that he dares before he leaves Musca/b. 11That Monsiuer Ottavi and his Government would make a spe cial demonstration at this season was all along foreseen bv the Sultan (vide Para 3 of this Office Letter. No.2 date*- 3rd February 1901) and while I had been unable to give him much encouragement as regards active intervention on our part I hoped and I have no doubt His Highness did also that the ordinary amount of moral support represented by the presence of one or two of our men-of-war and their oc- ^ as 4onal appearance in the vicinity of Soor would have - fforded some measure of unobjectionable assistance to his cause. So far from this being the case however and con trary to all precedent for the season of the year^always important one owing to the slave running which occurs at this time.British men-of-war were conspicuous by their ab sence . I am aware that events passing at Koweit made the presence of ships urgent there which might otherwise have been a- vailabie for Muscat and I have been at pains to explain their absence in this way to the Sultan; at the same time there is no doubt that Monsiuer Ottavi has made capital at Soor out of their absence by pointing out that the moment a French man-of-war came up to protect them British ships which had oeen in evidence for many months disappeared al together, and also that many of the Saltan's Arab friends have made it a reason for advising hyrfo pull in. his horns in his attitude towards the French, on the grounds that if the British Government had wanted or been able to help h' they would not have held aloof at this juncture. (15). The Sultan's personal feelings at present may be gau ed from a remark which he made to me at Soor. bad enough ' he said » that the French Consul should soduc my Soori subjects from me by means of the French flag and encourage them to defy me in ordinary matters of uovu.- Now he has even extended his hand towards my subjects m t the interior and is alienating them iron, m^* ^ i.£U rfhere is it going to Gnd?'[L.tely Seyyid i?eisul has been in a state of such intense annoyance both at the behaviour of nis Sharkiyeh subjects towards us in the matter of the coal and au the French Consul's thrasonical proceedings at Soor that the difficulty has been to prevent him from taking some hasty act-i tion of self-assertion. I have however so far restrained him from anything of the sort; in the first connection because he has as^yet no tangible proof of Monsiuer Ottavi's collusion with his subjects and in the second i.e. the matter 01 th., flags oecause the passive attitude which His Majesty's Govt., seems to me from the record to have assumed towards the questitf/v made me fear that His Highness's interests might not be ultima tely benefitted by his coming to a, fresh issue on the subject with the French Consul^in which at the present jun-,i &gt; cture it might be inconvenient or impossible for His Majesty's Govt, to support him. Moreover I felt that Mons. Ottavi having had the board entirely to himself during his visit to Soor this year had probably won over all the wavering flagholders past recall, &lt;' nd that an y precipitate action taken by the Sultan now would prove too late to be of any real use. (16). At the sane time I have the honour to express very respec- fuily the decided opinion that whereas the attitude of the Sul tan in the matter of loyalty to his obligations to the British Govt, and their representative 1 ^ ift a* favourable noiv as it is ev- ver likely to be in the case of the present Ruler, and his indifl nation p,gainst the French though Mupb^tRw^ both real and acute tips state of things cannot reasonably be expected to remain permanent unless His Majesty's Govt, arc soon in a position to adopt towards Muscat such fa a wel/ &gt; defined policy as will both be apparent to the Sultan and his subjects and will at W tfl French du- -ring the past year in the direction of protection and the s Spread of anti -English propaganda has undouotedly accomplished and which without our assistance the Sultan is powerless to cope with.Xi* ohese xop^Vr^rl 'bo.ctjics ' n.PG G.llow6d. ~bo psiiicxin un— repressed and the loyalty of the Sultan to the British Govt, continues by means of scurrilous literature and otherwise to be made in it^eli a handle for arousing the disaffection of his subjects against him, I can see no other result than that boor and uhe Siarkiyeh country will in process of time become altogether alienated from his authority. (17). I submit that if as I understand is the case, His Majesty's Govt, can find no locus standijfor us to intervene on the Sultan' s behalf in the matter of the flags, we have ampl^grounds for moving on our own account under the Brus sels Act. In support of this view I beg to quote the fol lowing recent incident. While I, Dr. von Krafft and the Sultan's son were lately in a position of some delicacy some miles in the interior and the Sultan himself waiting anxiously at Bilad-es-Soor for news of us, H.B.M.'s S. Cossack arrived off Soor. Soon after she arrived, although the French Cruiser 'Internet' and the French Consul had been stationed in Soor for a month previous, a party of 10 slaves in one boat made off to the ship for freedom. The owners g4«B/e chase however and overtook the boat, but three of the negros dived into the water and reached the Cossack safely. Their depositions wert recorded by the commander. They subseouently stated that they had not attempted to es cape to the French ship during the past month because they knew that they would not be received; that some ox their acquaintances had been so turned away or given back to thei^ owners and that it was known to all the slave community in Soor that whereas it was no use going to a French ship, es cape to a British ship meant certain freedom. It wa,s evi dent from their statements that they were entitled to free dom and when I arrived on the scene a few days later and vi sited the Captain of the 'Cossack' I agreed with him that he could not do otherwise than give them manumission papers* toiiviUThis was done, the Cossack soon a: afterwards left Soor for Muscat and consigned the slaves to the Consulate and on ray return 1 ont them to Bombay. Two of these slaves proved to have be longed to an influential Soori who has been loyal to the Sul tcan in the matter of the flags and always hospitable to me when in the neighbourhood, and our friend's injured importunities w- tan in t. v ore spraewhat embarrassing for both of us when leaving Soor and afterwards. Our men—of—war hardly ever touch at Soor 2 or a few hours wit ^without something of this kind happening, and though from an ethical point of view the state of things disclosed is a very desirable one, it seems to me to be the height of na tional quixotism that while we thus make ourselves intensely unpopular and prejudice other political interests of our own and the Sultan's by the most loyal adherence to our obligations under the Brussels Act, we should complacently allow the Trench simultaneously to make political capital at our expen se out of the oreach of it and to go on with holding indefi nitely their signature to the most important Articles of the Act. (18). In conclusion I beg to observe that if His Majesty's G-overnment are now in a position to give the Sultan more ac tive support than has hitherto been possible I am of opinion that it can oe most effectively done by helping him to esta- olish proper customs administration at Soor where his subject headed by the Trench proteges defaintly refuse to pay regular duty, and fron whence his income is consequently only 6000 dollars when it might be 50,000. (IS). A copy of this report, for which I ask indulgence if I have expressed my self too freely, will be forwaredd direct to the G-overnment of India as it is desirable that it should reach them as early as possible.

Foreign Office Press-No. 1218-G-8-01-48.Report on coal, occurring in South Oman (Arabia). After receiving orders on the 29th March to proceed to Maskat and to Tntmdiiption examine certain occurrences of coal, which were reported from 1 * South Oman, I left Calcutta on the 2nd of April and arrived in Maskat on the 9th. In company of the Political Agent and Consul in Maskat, Captain P. Z. Cox, I proceeded on the IPth April to K.alhat, approxi mately 70 miles S.E. of Maskat, on the coast of Oman. Arriving there on the 17th, I first examined a locality, approximately 12 miles N.W.'of Kalhat, where coal had been reported from, but the occurrence, which was shown me by natives, proved to be carbonaceous shale of no economic value whatever. On the 20th April, we left Kalhat to proceed to a second locality, approxi mately 30 miles further S., where good coal had been found. Unfortunately we met with much opposition, and it was not until the 22nd of May that I was allowed to inspect one seam. The time spent in the coal district (afternoon of the 22nd and forenoon of the 23rd May) was insufficient to arrive at anything like a definite conclusion as to the amount of coal available. I, however, was able to take samples of coal with me, and it has been ascertained that the quality of the coal is very satisfactory. Before dealing with the coal, it will be appropriate to give a short sketch g e o i o g i c ai of the geology of Oman, features. (Compare sketch map.) The beds follow each other in descending order as below:— (6) Conglomerates, sandstones, sands and clays with gastropods and Pleistocene. bivalves, presumably identical with recent forms. Unconformity. (5) Shaly and sandy limestones, from 5 to 6,000 feet thick, the topmost Miocene. 100 feet or so containing coal (“ Sur coal ”). (4) Brown weathering limestones and conglomerates, made up chiefly of Eocene limestone boulders imbedded in a calcareous matrix. Many of the layers of this series full of Nummulites.—300 to 500 feet. (3) Great thickness of limestones, mostly grey, the lower divisions contain ing a bed full of Kudistes. Middle and upper cretaceous. (2) Red and greenish, sandy clays, underlain by conglo merates, consisting chiefly of boulders of igneous and schistose rocks with a few limestone boulders of unknown origin. Near the village Sarfan in Wadi Heza, approximately 12 miles N.W. of Kalhat, a bed of carbonaceous shale is included in the clays. Unconformity. (1) Mica schists and quartz schists, intruded by dykes of granite and basic Crystalline igneous rocks (serpentine and diabase). series.The coal (“ Sur coal ”) belongs to the uppermost 100 feet or so of the Description of 'Oman Tertiaries, and is presumably of Upper Miocene age. coal exposure. jt occurs in a hilly country situated from 10 to 12 miles S.-E, of Wadi Ealij and approximately 25 miles from Sur, In the coal district the Miocene series form an open syncline, the axis of which coincides roughly with a broad valley running S.E.-N.W. Into this main valley lead a number of small ravines from S.W., and in one of these the outcrop of coal, which I inspected, occurs. This outcrop is as follows The ravine is from 70 to 150 feet wide and is bordered by steep walls of rock. On the S.E. bank, at a few hundred yards from the main valley, the coal exposure is met with, which has a 0 /££ yanfs. The beds dip down the ravine, their dip being steeper than the gradient of the former. The seam, therefore, disappears towards the main valley under the surface, while it rises out of the ground up the ravine (S.W.), so that the base of the coal is exposed at the S.W. termination of the outcrop. Here the seam is concealed by debris for a short distance, under which it apparently thins out, as it does not re-appear higher up the ravine. Nothing but an unworkable bed of carbonaceous shale was found in this direction. The coal is underlain by an ochrey shale, while the beds immediately over- lying the coal consist of canbonaceous shale of several feet thickness. Above this follow shaly and concretionary limestones, which rise in a perpendicular wall of from 50 to 60 feet. The seam is at the outcrop 4' S' thick. Erom this exposure nine coal samples were taken and tested in the Labora tory of the Geological Survey Office. As the rocks were over amp es. hanging, it would have been impracticable to dig far into the seam. The samples, therefore, had to be taken from the surface, where the coal # s-e ’s N was a cer t a i n extent weathered. Two of the samples,* viz., D. 50 and D. 49, are from the top of the seam, two (D. 67 and D. 66) from the base, all the rest are from the middle of the seam. The history of B. 37 is unknown. I received it from a native, but am not sure whether it comes from the same locality or a different one. As to the composition of the coal compare the accompanying table, page Composition 3. The first group of tests shows the percentage of moisture, of coal. volatile matter, fixed carbon and ash. The second gives the composition of coal of which the moisture has been extracted before assaying. The samples gave all much the same results. There is, therefore, no marked difference in the composition of the seam either vertically or horizontally. - similar to The Sur coal can best be compared to Assam coals as shown Assam coal. below, page 4.3 so of the ocene age. miles S.-E. ^he axis of Into this ne of these p walls of lin valley, e beds dip •mer.

At a Probably cak- first glance the coal might be taken for a non-cakino* coal ing coal. but this is by no means certain, nor even probable It is known that some coals lose their caking properties after having been exposed to weathering. As mentioned above, the Sur coal samples were weathered and as there is one among them that cakes, it seems very likely that the coal was originally a caking coal, but has for the most part lost its caking properties by weathering. 1 The average specific gravity of Sur coal is 1*338. A ton of this coal, there- 26 , 7 cubic feet fore, contains 26 , 7 cubic feet. The specific gravity is somewhat = i ton. higher than in Cherrapunji coal* (Assam). In Phillips’s list of 43 assays of British coals, I can find only two which have a higher specific gravity. ° Welsh coal, Hill’s Plymouth Works, s.g. 1*35. Lancashire coal, Ince Hall, Pemberton Yard, s.g. 1-348. Sur coal crumbles easily, and the samples fell partly to dust on the trans- Friability. port to Calcutta. Priability of coals may be due to mechanical pressure or to -weathering. As the Sur coal has undergone practically no pressure, the beds including it being but slightly raised, its friability may safely be attributed to weathering. The Sur coal will, I suppose when freshly raised from below the surface, be of medium hardness, but it will no doubt deteriorate more or less rapidly by keeping. The friability of the coal is hardly a great disadvantage. I have been informed by experienced businessmen that the market value of coal is not affected by its more or less crumbly condition, as the gratings can easily be adjusted. I have further satisfied myself by an inspection of Assam coal depots at Garden Beach near Calcutta that Assam coal, which is used advan tageously in ocean-going steamers and sells in Calcutta at Bs. 17 a ton, is of a very crumbly condition. I, therefore, suppose that the fabrication of briquettes (“patent fuel ”) will not be necessary. As to the distribution of the coal and the amount of workable coal Totai quan- available but little information could be gained, tity of coal not ° ascertained. I have shown above that at the outcrop described the coal dips under the surface in one direction (N.E.), while it disappear towards the other (S.W.). Opposite the outcrop, at the N.W. bank of the ravine, no trace of coal was found, which in the absence of other reasons must be attributed to the coal thinning out and disappearing towards N.W. There is, however, an indication of the coal seam extending towards S.E. In a second ravine, running parallel with the one described, and at least one hundred yards further S.E., traces of coal w r ere found, which I am convinced belong to the same seam. At the S.E. bank of this ravine, the carbonaceous shales were noticed, and by digging away the debris I could ascertain that they are at least of the same thickness, if not thicker than at the coal exposure. Un fortunately the coal, which must lie below these shales, was not reached, as my work was interrupted by the natives, but traces of coal were found in the ravine itself below some boulders. The evidence gained as to the distribution of the seam examined can be summarised as follows :— There is a workable seam of coal which from the exposure thins out towards S.W. and N.W., but continues at least a hundred yards towards S.E. The seam further must continue for some distance towards N.E., as there is no indication of its thinning out in this direction. I' ' I i6 It is, however, almost certain that the coal is of much greater distribution. This is to be concluded from geological reasons and from native reports received. The formation in which the coal is found appears to preserve the same characteristics over a distance of several miles, and as these characteristics are proved to be consistent with the occurrence of workable coal, it is reasonable to expect that the seam examined is not the only one or else of larger extent. This conclusion is to a certain extent borne out by native reports, of which one related by a bania in Maskat may here be communicated, as it contains nothing that did not agree with facts known to myself. From the description of the bania I gathered that there is an exposure of coal in the main valley alluded to above to the S.E. of the locality which I inspected. It is quite uncertain how far this exposure is distant from the one I examined. It is described as being a superficial exposure in the bottom of the valley, that is to say, the overlying limestones have there for some distance been denuded away. The length of the exposure is said to be 300 feet. The thickness of the seam 4 to 5 feet, and the coal is described as crumbling easily. These data would point to the exposure belonging to the same seam as that seen by myself, but in the absence of further proofs it would of course be wrong to draw more definite conclusions. The data, therefore, on which to form an estimate of the total quantity of available coal are insufficient, but there is reason to suppose that the seam examined by me is either not the only one, or else is of large enough extent to justify mining operations. Tor mining the Sur coal offers several important advantages. The coal is Conditions for .likely to be in places exposed superficially, and can therefore, I mining. suppose, to some extent be extracted in open workings. Where covered by overl ing rocks, its vertical depth from the surface will be found inconsiderable. The overlying limestone beds afford a firm roof. The beds including the coal are but little disturbed, and few faults are, therefore, likely to occur. The amount of percolating water must be very inconsiderable owing to the dryness of the climate. On the other hand, attention must be drawn to the absence in the country of timber and the difficulty of transport, which will be expensive if camels or donkeys are used. The scarcity of water will also be a drawback, although there are wells in the vicinity of the coal seam. At present the coal is only worked occasionally by surface scratchings. No native mining operations. Once a quantity of 8 tons was brought to Maskat by an enterprising bania, but there is so far no market for the coal in Maskat.

Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your confidential letter No. 232, dated the 15th June 1901, I am directed to forward a copy of a report* by Dr. A. von Krafft upon the result of his examination of the coal seams in the neighbourhood of Sur. * Dated the 21st June 1901. 2. Although the quality of the samples which Dr. von Krafft brought with him to India is satisfactory, the evidence for the occurrence of coal in any considerable quantity is so meagre that the Government of India are quite unable, upon the present data, either to invite capital for the working of the supposed mines, or to embark money in the scheme themselves. Before any such action is taken, it is necessary that a thorough and sustained geological investigation of the locality should be made; and I am to request that you will obtain the consent of the Sultan to the renewal of the examination at some convenient date. In reporting, through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the result of this reference to His Highness, with your suggestions as to how and when the investigation should be carried out, you should also give your opinion as to the form which, if it is eventually decided to work the coal, the enterprise may properly assume. In your letter No. 202, dated the 29th May 1901, you were understood to suggest that the Sultan himself should work the scheme, and. should provide coal to the British Government according to requirements at a fixed price per ton. It might, however, be preferable that the coal should be worked directly by the British Government or through the agency of a British firm upon specified conditions, and I am to invite an expression of your views upon this suggestion. 3. The other subjects dealt with in your report No. 229, dated the 15th June 1901, are under separate consideration, and a communication will be iuade to you later.

In the coal district the Miocene series form an open s^chne, the axis of which coincides roughly with a broad valley running . • • n 0 ns main valley lead a number of small ravines from S.W., and in one of these the outcrop of coal, which I inspected, occurs. This outcrop is as follows The ravine is from 70 to 150 feet wide and is bordered by steep walls of rock. On the S.E. bank, at a few hundred yards from the mam valley, the coal exposure is met with, which has a length of 22 y ard8 ' ^ etls down the ravine, their dip being steeper than the gradient of the former. Ihe seam, therefore, disappears towards the main valley under the surface, while it rises out of the ground up the ravine (S.W.), so that the base of the coal is exposed at the S.W. termination of the outcrop. Here the seam is concealed by debris for a short distance, under which it apparently thins out, as it does not re-appear higher up the ravine. Nothing but an unworkable bed of carbonaceous shale was found in this direction. The coal is underlain by an ochrey shale, while the beds immediately over- lying the coal consist of canbonaceous shale of several feet thickness. Above this follow shaly and concretionary limestones, which rise in a perpendicular wall of from 50 to 60 feet. Ihe seam is at the outcrop 4' 6' thick. From this exposure nine coal samples were taken and tested in the Labora tory of the Geological Survey Office.

Sur coal is remarkably free from sulphur.

Of the 10 samples assayed, 6 gave a white ash, in 2 only the ash shows a distinct brown colouring, while two are buff coloured. * Assays 1 to 5 from the Agricultural Ledger, 1898, No. 14, page 23. Assay 6 from Mallet, Memoirs, Geol. Survey, Vol. XII, Part 2, page 80, No. 24.! One of the 10 samples cakes beautifully, the rest do not cake. At a Probably cak- first glance the coal might be taken for a non-caking coal, ing coal. but this is by no means certain, nor even probable. It is known that some coals lose their caking properties after having been exposed to weathering. As mentioned above, the Sur coal samples were weathered, and as there is one among them that cakes, it seems very likely that the coal was originally a caking coal, but has for the most part lost its caking properties by weathering. The average specific gravity of Sur coal is 1*338. A ton of this coal, there- 26-7 cubic feet f ore &gt; contains 26'7 cubic feet. The specific gravity is somewhat = 1 ton - higher than in Cherrapunji coal* (Assam). In Phillips’s list of 43 assays of British coals, I can find only two which have a higher specific gravity. Welsh coal, Hill’s Plymouth Works, s.g. 1*35. Lancashire coal, Ince Hall, Pemberton Yard, s.g. 1*348. 4 Sur coal crumbles easily, and the samples fell partly to dust on the trans- Friability. port to Calcutta. Priability of coals may be due to mechanical pressure or to weathering. As the Sur coal has undergone practically no pressure, the beds including it being but slightly raised, its friability may safely be attributed to weathering. The Sur coal will, I suppose when freshly raised from below the surface, be of medium hardness, but it will no doubt deteriorate more or less rapidly by keeping. The friability of the coal is hardly a great disadvantage. I have been informed by experienced businessmen that the market value of coal is not affected by its more or less crumbly condition, as the gratings can easily be adjusted. I have further satisfied myself by an inspection of Assam coal depots at Garden Beach near Calcutta that Assam coal, which is used advan tageously in ocean-going steamers and sells in Calcutta at Bs. 17 a ton, is of a very crumbly condition. I, therefore, suppose that the fabrication of briquettes (“patent fuel”) will not be necessary. As to the distribution of the coal and the amount of workable coal Total quan- available but little information could be gained, tity of coal not ascertained. I have shown above that at the outcrop described the coal dips under the surface in one direction (N.E.), while it disappears towards the other (bAk.). Opposite the outcrop, at the N.W. bank of the ravine, no trace of coal was found, which in the absence of other reasons must be attributed to the coal thinning out and disappearing towards N.W. 1 here is, however, an indication of the coal seam extending towards S.E. In a second ravine, running parallel with the one described, and at least one hundred yards further S.E., traces of coal were foiind, which I am convinced belong to the same seam. At the S.E. bank of this ravine, the carbonaceous shales were noticed, and by digging away the debris I could ascertain that they are at least of the same thickness, if not thicker than at the coal exposure. Un fortunately the coal, which must lie below these shales, was not reached, as my work was interrupted by the natives, but traces of coal were found m the ravine itself below some boulders. The evidence gained as to the distribution of the seam examined can be summarised as follows :— There is a workable seam, of coal which from the exposure thins out towards S.W. and N.W., but continues at least a hundred yards towards b.Ji. The seam further must continue for some distance towards N.-h., as ere is no indication of its thinning out in this direction. sr * LuTouclie Records, XXII, page 169.6 It is, however, almost certain that the coal is of much greater distribution, i This is to he concluded from geological reasons and from native reports received. The formation in which the coal is found appears to preserve the same characteristics over a distance of several miles, and as these characteristics are proved to be consistent with the occurrence of workable coal, it is reasonable to expect that the seam examined is not the only one or else of larger extent. This conclusion is to a certain extent borne out by native reports, of which one related by a bania in Maskat may here be communicated, as it contains nothing that did not agree with facts known to myself. Prom the description of the hania I gathered that there is an exposure of coal in the main valley alluded to above to the S.E. of the locality which I inspected. It is quite uncertain how far this exposure is distant from the one I examined. It is described as being a superficial exposure in the bottom of the valley, that is to say, the overlying limestones have there for some distance been denuded away. The length of the exposure is said to be 300 feet. The thickness of the seam 4 to 5 feet, and the coal is described as crumbling easily. These data would point to the exposure belonging to the same seam as that seen by myself, but in the absence of further proofs it would of course be wrong to draw more definite conclusions. . Tbe data &gt; therefore, on which to form an estimate of the total quantity of available coal are insufficient, but there is reason to suppose that the seam examined by me is either not the only one, or else is of large enough extent to justify mining operations. Por mining the Sur coal offers several important advantages. The coal is Conditions for likely to be in places exposed superficially, and can therefore I mining. suppose, to some extent be extracted in open workings Where covered by overling rocks, its vertical depth from the surface will be found inconsiderable.

After receiving orders on the 29th March to proceed to Maskat and to Introduction. ^ xam ine certain occurrences of coal, which were reported from South Oman, I left Calcutta on the 2nd of April and arrived in Maskat on the 9th. In company of the Political Agent and Consul in Maskat, Captain I. Z. Cox, I proceeded on the Hth April to Eialhat, approxi mately 70 miles S.E. of Maskat, on the coast of Oman. Arriving there on the 17th, I first examined a locality, approximately 12 miles N.W.°of Kalhat, where coal had been reported from, but the occurrence, which was shown me by natives, proved to be carbonaceous shale of no economic value whatever. On the 20th April, we left h_alhat to proceed to a second locality, approxi mately 30 miles further S., where good coal had been found. Unfortunately we met with much opposition, and it was not until the 22nd of May that I was allowed to inspect one seam. The time spent in the coal district (afternoon of the 22nd and forenoon of the 23rd May) was insufficient to arrive at anything like a definite conclusion as to the amount of coal available. I, however, was able to take samples of coal with me, and it has been ascertained that the quality of the coal is very satisfactory. Before dealing with the coal, it will be appropriate to give a short sketch G e o i o g i c ai of the geology of Oman, features. (Compare sketch map.) The beds follow each other in descending order as below:— (6) Conglomerates, sandstones, sands and clays with gastropods and Pleistocene. bivalves, presumably identical with recent forms. Unconformity. (5) Shaly and sandy limestones, from 5 to 6,000 feet thick, the topmost Miocene. 100 feet or so containing coal (“ Sur coal ”).

(2) Bed and greenish, sandy clays, underlain by conglo merates, consisting chiefly of boulders of igneous and schistose rocks with a few limestone boulders of unknown origin.

It occurs in a hilly country situated from 10 to 12 miles S.-R of Wadi Ralij and approximately 25 miles from Sur. In the coal district the Miocene series form an open syncline, the axis of which coincides roughly with a broad valley running S.E.-N.W. Into this main valley lead a number of small ravines from S.W., and m one of these the outcron of coal, which I inspected, occurs. This outcrop is as follows :— The ravine is from 70 to 150 feet wide and is bordered by steep walls of rock. On the S.E. bank, at a few hundred yards from the main valley, the coal exposure is met with, w 7 hich has a length of 22 yards. The beds dip down the ravine, their dip being steeper than the gradient of the formei. Ihe seam, therefore, disappears towards the main valley under the surface, while it rises out of the ground up the ravine (S.W.), so that the base of the coal is exposed at the S.W. termination of the outcrop. Here the seam is concealed by debris for a short distance, under which it apparently thins out, as it does not re-appear higher up the ravine. Nothing but an unworkable bed of carbonaceous shale was found in this direction. The coal is underlain by an ochrey shale, while the beds immediately over* lying the coal consist of canbonaceous shale of several feet thickness. Above this follow shaly and concretionary limestones, which rise in a perpendicular wall of from 50 to 60 feet. The seam is at the outcrop 4' 8' thick. From this exposure nine coal samples were taken and tested in the Labora* tory of the Geological Survey Office. As the rocks were over- Sampies. hanging, it would have been impracticable to dig far into the seam. The samples, therefore, had to be taken from the surface, where the coal was to a certain extent weathered. Two * Seep ’ 3 ’ of the samples,* viz., X). 50 and X). 49, are from the top of the seam, two (D. 67 and D. 66) from the base, all the rest are from the middle of the seam.

Prom, The Under Secretary to the Government of India, in the Poreign Department, To, Lieut-Col C.A.Kemball, Offg; Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire, Dated Port filliam,the17th Pebruary 1902 Sir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter No.216 dated the 6th December 1901, regarding the coal seams in the vicinity of Sur. 2. Mr Oldham has submitted his report uoon the examination of the localities in question, and copies of it will be furnished to you in due course when printed. The reoort indicates that the coal beds are limited to a comparatively small area, and that, owing to the dis tance of these beds from the coast and the absence of any local supply of labour, it would probably be imposr- sible to lay down the coal at the sea board as cheai ly as foreign coal might be imported and stocked there. In the face of this expert opinion,the Government of India are not prepared to proceed further in the matter. I am to report that you vifill direct Captain Cox to acquaint the Sultan with the result of Mr Oldham s exploration,and to inform His Highness that the Govern ment of India cannot recommend that any attempt should be made to work the coal for the present. Captain Cox should, however, endeavour to obtain rom His Highness an undertaking that he will not entertain any proposals from other parties to work the seams without first giving■the British Government the option of reconsidering the matters. The result of the reference to the Sultan should be reported in due course. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Signed) J.B.Wood, Under Secretary to the Government of India.No. sz of 1902.

Without prejudice to the full report which Dr. Oldham will subse quently submit, I understand from him that his inspection of the exposures of coal leads him to the conclusion that the seams existing are rather of the nature of “ pockets” and that, whereas some 200,000 tons are probably avail able, the general prospect is not sufficiently good to warrant the inception of mining operations. 4 The Beni Abu Hassan and Musharifeh have been perfectly wel - disposed to us throughout, and the expedition has experienced no practical difficulties.

In continuation of my letter of proceedings, dated the loth October 1901 (Maskat No. 21), I have the honour to report that, in accordance with the arrangements^reported to you therein, H. M. S. Assays left Maskat at 11 a.m. on October 15th, with orders to proceed to Karachi at sufficient speed to catch the mail steamer leaving that port on the evening of the 17th. 2. On the 18th October, His Highness the Sultan of Oman visited me in return for my official call upon him a few days previously, and was saluted on disembarking with 21 guns. 3. At 6-45 p.m. on Friday, October 25th, I left Maskat, with telegrams from the Political Agent and arrived at Jask at 11 a.m. on the 26th. On the morning of the 27th I received a telegram from the Assays reporting the arrival at Karachi of Mr, Oldham, the Indian Government Geologist, that the Assays would sail (for Khor Jerama, near Sur, understood) on the 28th, and that the embarkation of a Military Intelligence officer had been authorised bv you. J 4. I accordingly left Jask at 5 P.M. on the 27th October and arrived at Maskat at 10 a.m. on the 28th. 5. Target practice with heavy and light Q. F. guns was carried out on the morning of the 28th, half the quarterly allowance (reduced by the surplus used in prize firing the previous quarter) being expended, and all 'guns that could bear tiring together in accordance with A. L. of 21st March 1899, paragraph 5. An officer was stationed to mark for each 4 ,/ gun, and a petty officer for each 3 pr. 6. On arriving at Maskat I was informed by tbe Political Agent that the Sultan would not be ready to embark before the morning of the 30tb (instead of the 29th as previously arranged) owing to the arrival at Maskat of the Sheikhs ol the 13em Abu Hassan and Musharifeh tribes, in whose country the coal fields proposed to be explored are situated. It was the Musharifeh tribe (insti gated by the French) that opposed the last expedition which was sent to explore the coal-fields, and which was therefore unable to complete its investigations. Ihese Sheikhs had come to Maskat to offer their submission to the Sultan and to express their willingness to permit tbe proposed new exploration to be carried out. 1 7. On the morning ot Wednesday the embarkation of the Sultan’s guard ami ol the above Sheikhs with their retinues was carried out, the total number ing loO His Highness the Sultan and Captain Cox, the Political Agent, having been embarked, I sailed from Maskat at 8 a.m, on that day, the 30th betedhr 66 ^ St motlerate des P atcl1 speed in order to reach Khor Jerama 8. Khor Jerama had been selected as the best starting point for the ex- pedition, as the road from that place is better than the one from Sur. Onoe started, however the exploring party intend to maintain communication only with Sur, where tbe Sultan will remain. J 9. Up to this date and for tbe past fortnight the weather bad been very fine and the sea calm. After leaving Maskat, however, a fresh northerly breeze set in, and on arriving off Khor Jerama a considerable sea was runningmaking the disembarkation inconvenient, though not actually dangerous The anchorage ns entirely exposed, and an unpleasant one to lie at with the rocky steep coast as a close lee shore, and a confused sea. J i i, • Tll r S ? ram el,tter aIlcl three pulling cutters conveyed the local natives (about ninety m number) ashore, with the exception of a few leading men who remained wi h the Sultan. It was after dark when these boats entered the tWR w i' 1 ^° the Kl ' 0r ’ and on their arrival inside the harbour found . M. S. Assays as 1 expected, though the intervening high land mdclG her presence unknown upon iny cirrivcil. 11 The Commanding Officer of the Assays declined to allow any of the boats to go out of the harbour during the night, on account of the sea run- rung at its entrance ; but on the morning of the 31st the steam cutter returned, the Lieutenant in charge reporting that the sea at the entrance of the harbour prevented his getting the cutters out, and that he had ordered them to remain inside until the weather moderated. The Sultan being anxious to disembark at our, and as he was to make arrangements for the supply of 100 camels for the expedition, further delay was inadvisable. I therefore weighed at 7-30 A M., and proceeded to Sur, arriving and anchoring off that town at 9 a.m. Baghalas came off from the shore, and, despite the heavy sea, landed the Sultan and his guard, His Highness being saluted on leaving the ship with twenty-one guns. 1 12. At 2 p.m. the Sultan being landed, I weighed anchor and returned to the former anchorage off Khor Jerama, arriving at 3-30 p.m. Having no means of communicating with the Assays except by boat, I sent Lieutenant Levan m the whaler to bring off one of the cutters, which I required in order to disembark Captain Cox, Prince Timor (son of the Sultan), and Ids party, baghalas not being obtainable at Khor Jerama. The whaler safely got inside the harbour entrance, and into smooth water, but one of the cutters came out at 9 p.m,, and reported that the whaler had been capsized in a squall inside the harbour. An houi later Lieutenant Commander B. M. Lambert came on board and reported that Lieutenant Bevan and the whaler’s crew were safely on board the Assays, and that the float and most of its gear had been recovered by the Assaye’s boats. 13. On the morning of Friday, November 1st, the sea having moderated somewhat, I was able to disembark Captain Cox, Prince Timor and their parties and baggage, and in the afternoon got all the boats hack and hoisted : considerable sea was still running, and in the course of the three days’ opera- tions the boats have unavoidably suffered from damage and losses. 14. The Assays being able to lie inside the Khor Jerama, an entirely land-locked and sheltered harbour, which His Majesty’s ship under my command is unable to enter, I directed the Assays to remain there until the exploring party (to which she will render any required assistance) have started ; and immediately afterwards, weather permitting, to proceed to Sur and remain there, in accoidauce with the Political Agent’s wishes. In case of bad w eather, Khor Jerama is available, and land communication with Sur can be arranged temporarily. 15. The outer anchorages at Khor Jerama and at Sur being very unsatis factory in the northerly wind and sea prevailing, and the Assays being more useful inside the harbour than I would be outside, I left Khor Jerama at 5 p.m., on the 1st instant, and proceeded to Maskat with the mails of both ships, arriving at 7 a.m. to-day. On the arrival of the English mails due here on the 5th I propose to return to Sur, when I hope to find the weather more moderate by that time, and to remain there, sending the Assays with mails to Maskat on the 8th to await the English mails due there on the 12th instant. 16. Captain Cox was unable to inform me of the probable duration of the expedition, until after his arrival at the coal-fields, but hoped to let me know in the course of a few days. 17.

Oldham’s report of an examination of the coal localities south of Sur in Oman, Arabia, and request that a copy of it may be sent for record in this Department. REPORT OF AN EXAMINATION OF THE COAL LOCALITIES SOUTH OF SUR IN OMAN, ARABIA. 1. Embarking on board H. M. S. Assays I left Karachi on 28th October and reached Khor Jerama on 30th October. On 31st October I was joined by Captain P. Z. Cox, His Majesty’s Consul at Maskat, and on 1st November we landed. After devoting a day to the measurement of a base line and starting the topographical survey we left Kbor Jerama on 3rd November. Two long marches brought us to Musweh, the first of the localities at which coal was known to exist. The five days from 5th to 9th November were devoted to investigating this locality. On 10th November I visited the second of the reported localities, Jebel Khami, and on 11th November we marched to Migel, in the Fisao valley, the locality which was visited by Dr, von Krafft and Captain Cox in May last. Three days proved sufficient for the investigation of this locality, and on 15th November we left it, arriving at Suk Sur on 16th November. Here I was detained till 21st November, when I embarked on H. M. S. Perseus and reached Maskat the following day. 2. Of the geology of the country traversed it is not necessary to say much, as the opportunities for making observations other than those directly bearing on the coal were small. The rocks seen on the route differ somewhat from those noticed by Dr. von Krafft, the lower part of his section being only imper fectly represented, while the open country between Khor Jerama and the ^Jusawi hills is composed of a much contorted series of rocks, of unknown age,7 whose prevailing, colours are red and white. These are unconformably over laid by beds of eocene, probably upper eocene, age. 3. The country passed through was everywhere barren to a degree and covered by an almost continuous sheet of stones, shattered by the intensity of the heat they are exposed to, and the rapid changes of temperature at sun rise and sunset. A few stunted thorn bushes and a few dried up tufts of herbage are all that can be seen in the way of vegetation, and animal life was represented by a few birds, one hare, four bats, and numerous flies. At Ealiz and from Ealiz on to Suk Sur fresh water is found in the Wadi Faliz, but else where there are only a few scattered water holes of small size and yielding a limited supply of brackish water. 4. The coal is found among rocks of tertiary age, classed by Dr. von Krafft as miocene, which occur in the centre of a synclinal, and are, consequently, the newest rocks of the district. The outcrop ends, by the closing in of the synclinal, about 4 miles north of Migel on the one hand and 3 miles south of Musweh on the other, giving a total length of about 10 miles, along which the dip of the rocks is towards the centre from either side. 5. The first locality visited was about half a mile south of the camp at Musweh water. Here there is a stretch of low-lying level ground, carved out by a stream from between two beds of hard sandstone, about 200 yards long by 30 broad, which is shown in the photograph. In this and in the stream beds draining down from the east there are numerous exposures of coal; after clear ing and opening up the coal seams at the southern (further) end of the low ground, the section given in the right hand column of the statement appended was measured. It will be seen from this that eighteen seams were found on this section of which two measured over 4 feet in thickness. At first sight this looks promising enough, but there were soon facts tending to modify the first favour able impression. In the next ravine to the south, not half a mile off,, an excellent section is exposed of the rocks occupying precisely the same horizon as the coal seams, and here not a trace of coal is to be seen. There is no room for doubting that the coal is really absent and not merely hidden, for it happens that there is a freshly exposed section on the hillside extending right across the whole thickness of the beds in which the coal was seen, and had there been a trace of coal it could not have escaped detection. . • 6 flavin 0 ' seen this I returned to the original locality to investigate it a s fully as possible. With this object I had a fresh set of pits opened, along the outcrops of the coal seams, at about 450 feet from the first set, that being as far as I could go without finding the outcrops covered with a thick deposit of boulders, which would have necessitated much work to clear the outcrops. Alon°' this line, whose section is given in the left hand column of the statement, I found three seams, not represented on the southern section, while one seen on the southern is not represented on the northern section. This does no , however, fully exhibit the variability of the seams m thickness, for No- J. seam &gt; which has a thickness of 1 foot 10 inches on the northern, and of 1 foot 7 inches on the southern section, was found to have a thickness of nearly 4 feet about half-way between the two. No. 7 seam, which has a thickness of 1 foot 8 inches on the northern section, was found to thin out to 14 inches at 100 eet to the southwards along the outcrop, to inches at loO feet, and at 200 t et it had come to an end, and could not be found. 7 A still more striking evidence of the limited extent of these eoa seams was found when I came to try and trace their extension to the southward. With this obiect I had a trench cut across the hillside at a distance ot about 950 feet measured up a slope of some 15°. This trench is just visible m the photoeraph • it was very shallow, but carried down to the solid rocks along its ttfth, Which, as Will be seen from the photograph --ses he c^pu- ation of the same series of beds in which theseamsNosltoTmcludmthe two 4-feet seams, are found Yet in spite of this and of the small distance from the thick outcrops not a trace of coal could be found. S. From th “ e pTkeTs*whic^may'reL^T good workable C thick- S S ~t. s..u «. .f...... » nessstipply fuel fof local purposes from surface workings,—and for this there is no* local demand. 9. The outcrops just described are not the only ones that were seen in these rocks. Close to the water hole at Musweh camp is a band of coal 18 inches thick; a band of shaly coal is found in the ravine south of the coal valley ; in a tributary on the opposite side of the main valley three seams of coal, of from 4 to 8 inches in thickness, are found ; and about two miles down stream from Musweh camp a thin string of coaly shale was seen. Evidently the conditions, under which the coal-bearing rocks were formed, were such as favoured small accumulations of vegetable matter, but not the formation of extensive coal seams. 10. The second locality visited was Jebel Khami, on the eastern slope of the Musawi range. The coal occurs in rocks which belong to the same series as those in which the Musweh coal is found, but lower down in it. Ihere were a couple of thin bands of coal, associated with thick beds of carbonaceous shale and evidently as inconstant as the Musweh coals. 11. Having examined the Jebel Khami and Musweh localities, we went on to Migel, which is in the same field as Musweh, though in a different drainage basin and separated by a ridge of about 500 feet in height. Here I saw the outcrop examined by t)r. von Krafft, a good exposure of nice looking coal, which would have been regarded as very promising but for the experience gained at Musweh. The anticipation that it too would thin out very rapidly was strengthened by the variation of thickness along the exposure: one measurement gave 4 feet 9 inches, another 16 feet off gave 5 feet 1 inch, and a third, obtained 12 feet further on by digging out the extreme end of the expo sure, gave 3 feet 2J inches. This pointed to a rapid thinning out, but I soon found that the coal extended further than at first sight seemed probable. Up the valley I found two exposures on the same side, and about 300 yards up, under a cliff, over w r hich the water falls on the rare occasions when the stream flow's, there was a deep cut recess at the back of which an exposure of carbonaceous shale was seen. On clearing this out and digging downwards the coal seam was found, with a thickness of 4 feet 6 inches. 12. This coal seam can be picked up with ease, as it and the associated shales are over and underlaid by two peculiar rocks. The overlying one is a calcareous sandstone, passing into limestone, composed of large spheroidal con-* cretionary masses of a blue grey colour set in a buff coloured matrix: the underlying rock is a massive, hard, white sandstone. Led by these guides it was found that the exposure of carbonaceous shale in the next ravine to the south, mentioned by Dr. von Krafft in his report, was on the same horizon as the original exposure. I had an excavation made here and found the coal was only 1 foot 8 inches thick, overlaid by about 8 feet of carbonaceous shale; half a mile further up this stream I found another exposure of carbonaceous shale, and, after digging down through 8 feet of it, found that the coal had dwindled to only 9 inches in thickness. 13. No other exposure of the coal seam, or of rock on its horizon is seen on this side of the valley, but about a mile to east-north-eastward of the camp at Migel the white sandstone is found in the bed of a stream, and above it the rock composed of blue grey spheroids set in a buff matrix. On searching the ground between these two rocks I found an exposure of coaly, matter in the stream bed and another on the valley side. On opening out this exposure the coal was found to be only 2 inches in thickness. IL Besides the coal of the seam seen by Dr. von Krafft I saw two others in this valley, both at lower horizons. The lower of these is exposed about half a mile up stream and the other further down, between the two coab already mentioned; the lower coal is only 6 inches thick and the other 7 inches. 15. From the measurements recorded in the preceding paragraphs it will be seen that von Krafft’s coal seam, though more extensive than those at Musweh, thin out in a short distance. The exposures seem to indicate, however, that there may be an area of as much as a quarter of a mile square with a thickness of 4 feet and more. This gives some 250,000 tons ot^ *r* 9 workable coal; this would certainly be worked if it were found in an easily accessible region where there was a good demand, and once tnining works were established, doubtless, other similar patches of coal would be discovered, and so a moderate supply might be kept up for many years. Eor this reason it will be well to consider the other conditions on which the possibility of profitable working depends. 16. The natural outlets for the coal must be either Sur or Khor Jerama. The latter is a land-locked harbour, with a narrow entrance, which presents no serious difficulty to steamships drawing up to 16 feet, provided they enter and leave against the tide. In this harbour, completely land-locked and having an extreme rise and fall of tide of 9 feet at springs, a jetty could easily be constructed from which coal might be loaded directly into ships. Erom Ehor Jerama to Musweh would require a railway of at least 30 miles in length ; at about 5 miles from the harbour there is a couple of miles of broken ground, where a good deal of earthwork would be required to make a line, even one with sharp curves and steep gradient, but with this exception the line would run over open plains, where hardly any embarkments or cut tings would be required, till the last 4 miles into Musweh, which would be through a hill valley and difficult and expensive to construct. If the coal in the Eisao valley was to be tapped, there would be a very difficult and expensive piece of line over, or through, the 500 feet ridge separating the two valleys. 17. If Sur was adopted as the outlet, the country traversed would be more difficult on the whole than that between Musweh and Khor Jerama. The dis tance by camel track is about 26 miles, but any railway would have to be longer than this, and probably not less than 35 miles. Of this, the first 5 miles from Migel is hilly to a degree which would make the alignment of even a light railway expensive and difficult. At Sur there are. practically no facilities for shipping the coal; there is a backwater in which a jetty might be constructed, but the water in this is too shallow to admit of the entry of even small steamers and the jetty could only be used for loading lighters, from which the coal would have to be transhiped into vessels lying at anchor in an open roadstead. Eor this reason it would probably be better to.adopt Khor Jerama as the outlet, were there a sufficient quantity of coal to justify the expense of getting it out. 18. All labour would have to be imported, as there is none locally procurable. The inhabitants of the country are unwilling to undertake regular labour, and would be useless if they were willing. 19. All timber would also have to be imported, as the country produces none, even firewood would have to be imported, or brought from a distance, as the demands of a mining population would soon clear off the few scattered bushes in the neighbourhood of the mines. 20. Water would have to be brought from a distance as there is no wate*- fit for use in engines near the mines, nor even a supply of drinking water; the few waterholes yield a limited supply of brackish water, which is pei orce drunk by the Arabs, in default of better. The nearest source of fresh water is in the Wadi Ealig; here there appears to be a sufficient supply, but it would have to be pumped a distance of 10, or more probahy 12, mi es up to the coal-field. 21. The country has already been described as a desert; it is consequent y almost unnecessary to say that it produces nothing in the way o provisions and supplies, all of which would have to be imported. 22. The country in which the coal is found is unsettled and inhabited only by lawless tribes. Until some settled government is established, it would be impossible—at any rate imprudent—to sink capital in i, am ^ tribal organisation of the Arabs would make it easy o ant em . country, were there any justification for that course being adopted, the ex- pense of doing so would have to be added to the other expenses of extracting the coal and bringing it down to the seaboard. i • 23. Erom this it will be seen that not only would the cost of working ie coal be very high, in this region where everything has to be imported, but 1145 F. D.very large capital outlay would have to he faced at the outset, before any return could he obtained. In these circumstances it is onlv a very large supply of exceptional quality which would justify the establishment of a colliery equipped lor an outturn sufficient to give a profitable return on the initial expenditure. It will be seen from paragraphs 5 to 16 of this report that the amount of available coal is really very small, and it must consequently be pro nounced of no economic value, in spite of the excellence of the samples brought back by Dr. von Kralft. Whether this quality is maintained in the other exposures and seams can only be known when the samples I have collected have been assayed, but in view of the fact that the main conciusion reached in this report would be unaffected, its submission has not been delayed in order to incorporate the results of these assays. 24. There remains finally for consideration the question whether there may not possibly be other coal seams more continuous than those examined and this question must be answered in the negative. In the coal-bearing beds the conditions of deposition were evidently such as led to the formation of limited patches, as opposed to extensive seams, of coal, and it is unlikely that both these forms of occurrence should be found in the same district. Besides this I think it unlikely, in view of the interest which has been shown and the inquiries which have been made, that any exposure of a thick seam of coal exists in this region which has not been brought to notice. There are doubtless many exposures of small seams which would be discovered in the course of a prolonged examination, but probably none of workable thickness. 25. The question of the existence of a workable seam of coal need not however, be left to be answered by inference, as, owing to the barrenness of the country, it can be answered with certainty in the negative. I have men tioned that the surface of the ground is covered with a sheet of fragments of stone, and though this sheet is almost continuous over the more level 'round and very extensive over the hillsides, yet on the slopes it is frequently interrupted and the underlying bare rock is exposed. In this way complete sections of all the rocks composing the hills are seen, and in the clear air of the desert any coal seam of workable thickness would have shown up conspicuously against the light coloured rocks of which the hills are composed. I do not make this statement from inference, but from experience; in the Garo hills, when they had been stripped bare by the earthquake of 1897, I saw the coal seams most distinctly running in black lines along the bare hillsides, which were visible from long distances off, and in Baluchistan, where the general aspect of the country much resembles the part of Arabia I have seen, though it is not quite so barren, all the coal seams found by me in the hills near Quetta were in the first instance detected from a distance of some miles. In the hills south of Sur, in spite of a very careful search of the hillsides, both with and without the aid bf binoculars, I could detect no exposures of coal, and may state with certainty that these hills contain no seam of sufficient thickness and extent to be workable.

I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 216, dated the 6th December 1901, regarding the coal seams in the vicinity of Sur. 2. Mr. Oldham has submitted his report upon the examination of the localities in question, and copies of it will be furnished to you in due course when printed. The report indicates that the coal beds are limited to a comparatively small area, and that owing to the distance of these beds from the coast and the absence of any local supply of labour, it would probably be impossible to lay down the coal at the seaboard as cheaply as foreign coal might be imported and stocked there. In the face of this expert opinion, the Government of India are not prepared to proceed further in the matter. I am to request that you will direct Captain Cox to acquaint the Sultan with the result of Mr. Oldham’s exploration, and to inform His Highness that the Govern ment of India cannot recommend that any attempt should be made to work the coal for the present. Captain Cox should, however, endeavour to obtain from His Highness an undertaking that he will not entertain any proposals from other parties to work the seams without first giving the British Govern ment the option of reconsidering the matter. The result of the reference to the Sultan should be reported in due course. No. 387-E.A.

Although the quality of the samples which Dr. von Krafft brought with him to India is satisfactory, the evidence for the occurrence of coal in any considerable quantity is so meagre that the Government of India are quite unable, upon the present data, either to invite capital for the working of the supposed mines, or to embark money in the scheme themselves. Before any such action is taken, it is necessary that a thorough and sustained geological investigation of the locality should be made; and I am to request that you will obtain the consent of the Sultan to the renewal of the examination at some convenient date. In reporting, through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the result of this reference to His Highness, with your suggestions as to how and when the investigation should be carried out, you should also give your opinion as to the form which, if it is eventually decided to work the coal, the enterprise may properly assume. In your letter No. 202, dated the 29th May 1901, you were understood to suggest that the Sultan himself should work the scheme, and should provide coal to the British Government according to requirements at a fixed price per ton. It might, however, be preferable that the coal should be worked directly by the British Government or through the agency of a British firm upon specified conditions, and I am to invite an expression of your views upon this suggestion. 3.

In company of the Political Agent and Consul in Maskat, Captain P. Z. Cox, I proceeded on the 14th April to Kalhat, approxi mately 70 miles S.E. of Maskat, on the coast of Oman. Arriving there on the 17th, I first examined a locality, approximately 12 miles N.W. of Kalhat, where coal had been reported from, but the occurrence, which was shown me by natives, proved to be carbonaceous shale of no economic value whatever. On the 20th April, we left Kalhat to proceed to a second locality, approxi mately 30 miles further S., where good coal had been found. Unfortunately we met with much opposition, and it was not until the 22nd of May that I was allowed to inspect one seam. The time spent in the coal district (afternoon, of the 22nd and forenoon of the 23rd May) was insufficient to arrive at anything like a definite conclusion as to the amount of coal available. I, however, was able to take samples of coal with me, and it has been ascertained that the quality of the coal is very satisfactory. Before dealing with the coal, it will he appropriate to give a short sketch Geologic ai of the geology of Oman, features. (Compare sketch map.)

It occurs in a hilly country situated from 10 to 12 miles S.-E. of Wadi Ealij and approximately 25 miles from Sur. In the coal district the Miocene series form an open syncline, the axis of which coincides roughly with a broad valley running S.E.-N.W. Into this main valley lead a number of small ravines from S.W., and in one of these the outcrop of coal, which I inspected, occurs. This outcrop is as follows The ravine is from 70 to 150 feet wide and is bordered by steep walls of rock. On the S.E. bank, at a few hundred yards from the main valley, the coal exposure is met with, which has a length of 22 yards. The beds dip down the ravine, their dip being steeper than the gradient of the former. The seam, therefore, disappears towards the main valley under the surface, while it rises out of the ground up the ravine (S.W.), so that the base of the coal is exposed at the S.W. termination of the outcrop. Here the seam is concealed by debris for a short distance, under which it apparently thins out, as it does not re-appear higher up the ravine. Nothing but an unworkable bed of carbonaceous shale was found in this direction. The coal is underlain by an ochrey shale, while the beds immediately over- lying the coal consist of canbonaceous shale of several feet thickness. Above this follow shaly and concretionary limestones, which rise in a perpendicular wall of from 50 to 60 feet. The seam is at the outcrop 4' 8' thick. Erom this exposure nine coal samples were taken and tested in the Labora tory of the Geological Survey Office. As the rocks were over- ampies. banging, it would have been impracticable to dig far into the seam. The samples, therefore, had to be taken from the surface, where the coal was to a certain extent weathered. Two k ' eep ' ’ of the samples,* viz. 3 D. 50 and D. 49, are from the top of the seam, two (D. 67 and D. 66) from the base, all the rest are from the middle of the seam. The history of B. 37 is unknown. I received it from a native, but am not sure whether it comes from the same locality or a different one. As to the composition of the coal compare the accompanying table, page Composition 3. The first group of tests shows the percentage of moisture, of coal. volatile matter, fixed carbon and ash. The second gives the composition of coal of which the moisture has been extracted before assaying. The samples gave all much the same results. There is, therefore, no marked difference in the composition of the seam either vertically or horizontally. similar to The Sur coal can best be compared to Assam coals as shown Assam coal. below, page 4.4 Assam.* Calorific power.

Sur coal is remarkably free from sulphur. No iron pyrites were observed. Very little but the coal is impregnated with a small amount of hydrous sulphur. iron oxyde, resulting no doubt from the decomposition of iron pyrites. Of the 10 samples assayed, 6 gave a white ash, in 2 only the ash shows a distinct brown colouring, while two are buff coloured. * Assays 1 to 5 from the Agricultural Ledger, 1898, No. 14, page 23. Assay 6 from Mallet, Memoirs, GeoL Survey, Vol. XII, Part 2, page 80, No. 24.* LaTouche Records, XXII, page 169. One of the 10 samples cakes beautifully, the rest do not cake. At a Probably cak- first glance the coal might be taken for a non-caking coal, ing coal. but this is by no means certain, nor even probable. It is known that some coals lose their caking properties after having been exposed to weathering. As mentioned above, the Sur coal samples were weathered, and as there is one among them that cakes, it seems very likely that the coal was originally a caking coal, but has for the most part lost its caking properties by weathering. The average specific gravity of Sur coal is 1*338. A ton of this coal, there- 26*7 cubic feet f ore &gt; contains 2G-7 cubic feet. The specific gravity is somewhat = i ton. higher than in Cherrapunji coal* (Assam). In Phillips’s list of 43 assays of British coals, I can find only two which have a higher specific gravity. Welsh coal, Hill’s Plymouth Works, s.g. 1*35. Lancashire coal, Ince Hall, Pemberton Yard, s.g. 1*318. Sur coal crumbles easily, and the samples fell partly to dust on the trans- Friabiiity. port to Calcutta. Priability of coals may be due to mechanical pressure or to weathering. As the Sur coal has undergone practically no pressure, the beds including it being but slightly raised, its friability may safely be attributed to weathering. The Sur coal will, I suppose when freshly raised from below the surface, be of medium hardness, but it will no doubt deteriorate more or less rapidly by keeping. The friability of the coal is hardly a great disadvantage. I have been informed by experienced businessmen that the market value of coal is not affected by its more or less crumbly condition, as the gratings can easily be adjusted. I have further satisfied myself by an inspection of Assam coal depots at Garden Beach near Calcutta that Assam coal, which is used advan tageously in ocean-going steamers and sells in Calcutta at Bs. 17 a ton, is of a very crumbly condition. I, therefore, suppose that the fabrication of briquettes (“patent fuel”) will not be necessary. As to the distribution of the coal and the amount of workable coal Total quan- available but little information could be gained, tity of coal not ascertained. I have shown above that at the outcrop described the coal dips under the surface in one direction (N.E.), while it disappears towards the other (S.W.). Opposite the outcrop, at the N.W. bank of the ravine, no trace of coal was found, which in the absence of other reasons must be attributed to the coal thinning out and disappearing towards N.W. There is, however, an indication of the coal seam extending towards S.E. In a second ravine, running parallel with the one described, and at least one hundred yards further S.E., traces of coal were found, which I am convinced belong to the same seam. At the S.E. bank of this ravine, the carbonaceous shales weye noticed, and by digging away the debris I could ascertain that they are at least of the same thickness, if not thicker than at the coal exposure. Un fortunately the coal, which must lie below these shales, was not reached, as my work was interrupted by the natives, but traces of coal were found in the ravine itself below some boulders. The evidence gained as to the distribution of the seam examined can be summarised as follows :— There is a workable seam of coal which from the exposure thins out towards S.W. and N.W., but continues at least a hundred yards towards S.E. The seam further must continue for some distance towards N.E., as there is no indication of its thinning out in this direction.6 J It is, however, almost certain that the coal is of much greater distribution. This is to be concluded from geological reasons and from native reports received. The formation in which the coal is found appears to preserve the same characteristics over a distance of several miles, and as these characteristics are proved to be consistent with the occurrence of workable coal, it is reasonable to expect that the seam examined is not the only one or else of larger extent. This conclusion is to a certain extent borne out by native reports, of which one related by a bania in Maskat may here be communicated, as it contains nothing that did not agree with facts known to myself. Prom the description of the bania I gathered that there is an exposure of coal in the main valley alluded to above to the S.E. of the locality which I inspected. It is quite uncertain how far this exposure is distant from the one I examined. It is described as being a superficial exposure in the bottom of the valley, that is to say, the overlying limestones have there for some distance been denuded away. The length of the exposure is said to be 300 feet. The thickness of the seam 4 to 5 feet, and the coal is described as crumbling easily. These data would point to the exposure belonging to the same seam as that seen by myself, but in the absence of further proofs it would of course be wrong to draw more definite conclusions. The data, therefore, on which to form an estimate of the total quantity of available coal are insufficient, but there is reason to suppose that the seam examined by me is either not the only one, or else is of large enough extent to justify mining operations. Eor mining the Sur coal offers several important advantages. The coal is Conditions for likely to be in places exposed superficially, and can therefore, I mining. suppose, to some extent be extracted in open workings. Where covered by overlying rocks, its vertical depth from the surface will be found inconsiderable. The overlying limestone beds afford a firm roof. The beds including the coal are but little disturbed, and few faults are, therefore, likely to occur. The amount of percolating water must be very inconsiderable owing to the dryness of the.climate. On the other hand, attention must he drawn to the absence in the country of timber and the difficulty of transport, which will be expensive if camels or donkeys are used. The scarcity of water will also be a drawback, although there are wells in the vicinity of the coal seam. At present the coal is only worked occasionally by surface scratchings. No native Once a quantity of 8 tons was brought to Maskat by an mining enterprising bania, but there is so far no market for the coal operations. in Magkat&gt; EZZ3 IZZ3 &lt; c=] E=H Geological Survey of India, • Calcutta ; The 21st June 190L (Sd.)

The correspondence is mainly between the Consul and Political Agent, Muscat, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, reporting about the necessity of hiring a geological expert to survey the area of Sur and its neighbourhood, and to examine the coal seams there. British Officials considered the coal found in Oman as a convenient source of supply for their Muscat and Persian Gulf requirements. British officials also reported about the French activities and their interest in the area of Sur.While the Sultan of Muscat was in agreement with the British over their interest in the coal export, the Hanawi tribal confederation in Oman was against any British work in Sur. The correspondence includes reports on Shaikh ‘Isa bin Salih al-Harthi writing to his followers in Sur endeavouring to stir them up against the British and the Sultan’s building operations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Hināwī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sur</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Coal</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00024f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
