Recently some Omanis have come to Bahrain, in particular three men, and have set up as pseudo religious leaders and sellers of amulets, charms etc. Lately they have begun to induce people, mostly youths, to submit to Zikr exercises as practised in North Africa and at one time by the so-called Darwishes in Cairo. They produce a kind of hysterical insensibility in their patients and then stick nails through their limbs without apparently causing any feeling to the patient. One of the boys who has been dealt with in this manner is now in hospital and from police reports I believe that many people have allowed themselves to be damaged by these Omanis. Though nothing is felt at the time the after results are in some cases really dangerous. Today we have arrested two of these men. If we prosecute it is quite likely that their victims will refuse to give information against them. Would you consider making a repatriation order against them without a case in Court? In my opinion and in the opinion of most of the people here the introduction of these ideas and practices into Bahrain are dangerous and undesirable. Lieut. Colonel A.C. Galloway, O.B.E., H. B.

The practices had included producing a kind of 'hysterical insensibility' in the people they influenced, and encouraging them to pierce their own limbs with nails, which in some cases had led to serious medical consequences.The papers include correspondence between the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave), and the Political Agent, Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Crawshaw Galloway); a report by the State Medical Officer, Bahrain (Richard Henry Barter Snow); and a copy of the Order of Prohibition issued by the District Magistrate, Bahrain, prohibiting the presence of the three Omanis in Bahrain for a period of two years, under the terms of the Bahrain Order-in-Council.The date range gives the covering dates of the correspondence; the last addition to the file is an entry in the notes dated 15 November 1947.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>State Medical Officer, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Self injury</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious activities</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000014#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
