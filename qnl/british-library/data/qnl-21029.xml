S/t XXXXXXXXArticle appeared in the AL-SHURA dated the 26th Shawal 1745. Literature in Bahrain and Kuwait. A page of their Modern History. Bahrain ia Kuwait and Kuwait is Bahrain. They are twin eiet^re whose father I f the Gulf and their mother the Arabian peninsula. -i-iieir nationality is the same; they speak the same language and their customs aro identical. Their rulers are from the same family. If they differ in political idbm they combine in everything else. They are about gathering together in the lap of the kind world educating power, and God is knowing. Literature was backwards in these two estates in the full sense of the phrase. It appears however that her contact with Iraq and India gave Kuwait a priority to take to literature a soul without which no nation can have any life. Shaikh Yusuf his bin Isa called upon it* people to establish a school and explained to them what progress could be achieved by it and they heard his call witliout any hesitation; and subscribed a sum of about 100,000/-. They established a school in the year 1530 and called it the 'Mubarakiah Sc2iool w in recognition of the feelings of that despotic Ruler who never looked on the school with any confidence. He was mentioning in his private confabulations that the progress of education and freedom of thought are harmful to a despotic Government. The school, was however, opened by the people of Kuwait under the patronage of H.Highness and the result was that it educated and promoted the sons of the middle class of the people to such a height which would not be believed. The school, however, has remained elementary until now, although fifteen years have passed from its age not to say of those years in which it retrograded. 1 his was the case because the policy of her Ruler was to deprive the school of its erudite principal and its kind father who left it alone and it remained Ijke a blind creature without liaving any one to lead it onward. AfterAfter the death of the Ruler of Kuwait Shaikh Yusuf tried to open another Gchool in the name of the present Ruler name! namely Shaikh Ahmad and it wac named ' A&gt;imadiah w , Shaikh YuGUf had to faoe many difficulties the principle onee being lack of money and the prejudice of the truGteeo of the 'Mubarakiah 1 * school. H. E. fcas however tided over all these difficulties by his wisdom one after the other, until he got the schools combined and caused the -^uler to issue an edict that an annual subsidy of 2000/- should b^ paid to them. ^he wisdom and economy with which the two schools are managed shall bring them prosperity sooner or later. But in Bahrain the moving spirit for the spread of literature and knowledge is H.E.ShaikJ? Abdallah bin Shaikh Isa al ^iial if ah because in his travel to Europe in the year 1?57 he was convinced of the necessity of his ^state's prosperity and the spread at in it of education and knowledge and his high position enabled him to take up this case with succers. He established the Municipality in Manama and founded the '^adrasat ul Hadaiah Khalifiah' 1 and collected for it a sum amounting to 400,000/- and $0^' left the management of the school in the hands of a committee of the notables of the town in view of it* his i-overnmontal position and his manifold duties. The regrettable thing however is that the said committee did not wisely managethe affairs of the school and squandered its finds and without any accounts whatever. And the principatlt.reason for this i^tris the fact that they do not heed the affairs of the school and it is no exaggeration wiw when I say that some of the said committee members are a/) illiterate whose wealth is considered^their capability. J-he other members of the committee have thrown the burden of the responsibility on the shoUilder of Haji Yusuf Fakroo in his capacity as the banker of the school. And with all . deference to this man I say that he has not demonstrated sincerity in his acts and this has made many of those subscribers7 GubEcriberc who gave annual donat lone to tho Gchool to withhold their donationo. It aleo bo happened that while the school being bMlt in ^oharraq a boat loaded with cement and other materials which were imported from Karachi, was Irnwn^ and the banker o^' the school contended that he had ordered the said materials from Karachi for the said school, although he had nothing of the management of the school in his hand nor the President of the committee or its members had any knowledge about this order, they only came to know of it after the incident took place. When we came to know that the ^oharraq school was not built but two thirds of its building while its ftimds ran short and neverthless its expenditures amounted to 250,000/- we shall come to know what a game has been played with its funds. And when things came to that state of affair namely bankruptcy before any lesson was being taught the school had to implore its founder - the high personality mentioned abo^ for assistance, and he used all in his power to convince the Government to grant it an annual subsidy amounting to ^ 12,000/- and was it for this subsidy and efforts of the founder the school would not have been in existence by now. In view of the importance given to education by the local Government of Bahrain which is due to the efforts of H. Highness the founder of the school we write the following lines to say that the annual subsidy of the school was raised to R* 30,000/- a year with effect from the month of Hamazan and we have here to express a word by way of protecting public interests after we put all feelings aside and that is what follows, x he Madrastul Hadaiah in Bahrain is higher than the two schools in Kuwait tnd its curricula and methods of teaching but the superiority of the Kuwait Schools is due to the appreciation of the people of Kuwait and the punctual attendance of their students whereas it is not the case in Bail rain. TheThe people of Bahrain are BubnicGjve to the turban-wearin* inclivtduale who ree danger in the progreeo of thoughts to their euperGtitious position and who hate schools and deem it a place of a hated enlightenment. i! he school 'boys also are indolent and unpunctual in attending to their lessons. Was it not for these reasons the school in Bahrain would have advanced a wj.de distance leaving her sister behind and would have been shining in the field. II.E. We request/Shaikh Abdulla to pay attention to the role played in the managenont of the affairs of the school and to invest its funds in Banks which do not allow any interost in these towns and to refer its management to wise and far seeing and economical persons so that the same regrettable state of affair shall not take place for a second time. We also approach our beloved Ruler to vie with the Ruler of Bahrain in such generosity as evinced by it towards the prosperity of schools, in his rs&amp;lra and during regime as H.il. tnows that no country s* all prosper but by the medium of knowledge. My request of my brethren the erudite individuals of Bahrain and Kuwait is that they should help me by writing to me on this important subject and which they have substituted for politics whereas it ic the life of all ^states.
