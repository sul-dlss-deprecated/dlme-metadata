Several questions, some of great political im portance, are opened up for consideration in these papers and correspondence. 2. Before proceeding to offer a few remarks upon them, I would premise that I see no occasion for sending out any special Officer to enter upon ques tions of general policy with the Persian Govern ment and with the Government of India. I would leave all such questions to be dealt with by the authorities on the spot, after Her Majesty’s Govern ment had decided upon the policy to be pursued. If any special agency should be required for the settlement of a particular question, the Government of India could appoint a special Commissioner to make the arrangements. 3. The very fact of sending a Commission*’* from England would be apt to excite suspicion in the mind of the Shah of Persia, and create difficulties, by leading him to suppose that something more was meant than met the eye. The Officer selected must be of rank to carry weight, he must be paid a high salary, and have an establishment, and be in vested with large powers to enable him to bring all the various matters treated of in this correspon dence to a satisfactory conclusion. A very long time would probably elapse before he could com plete his task. 4. I concur, however, in the propriety of de spatching a competent Naval Officer to Tehran to assist Her Majesty’s Minister in advising the Per sian Government as to tbe best mode of carrying into effect the wishes of the Shah to establish steamers in the Persian Gulf. A better man than Captain Lynch could not be selected, if he would consent to go. 5. We are informed by Mr. Alison that the Shah is very much engrossed by this project, and it would not be politic to thwart him, as, failing to obtain assistance from our Government, he might be driven to apply to France or to America. 6. It is our policy to preserve and strengthen Persia, without, however, encouraging her to encroach on her neighbours. There are no an tagonistic interests between the two countries, and we ought to endeavour to impress this sentiment upon Persia, at the same time evincing every desire to cultivate friendly relations by attending to her reasonable requests, and using all legitimate means to cement the alliance. 7. It was unfortunate that the application of the Shah a few years ago for British Officers to drilland organize his troops fell to the ground. The employment of British Officers in the Persian army is a measure to he encouraged, as the local know ledge and influence they acquire may prove of the greatest advantage to their own Government under certain contingencies, which may occur earlier than expected. 8. In the same manner the knowledge of lan guages, and of the people, and of localities, which would probably be acquired by British Commanders and officers of the Shah’s vessels in the Persian Gulf (should the project ever be realized), would be most useful to our own Government. Every year we miss more and more the special qualifi cations of the Officers of the Indian Navy, and if any school for training up a similar class of men could be found, it would be an advantage to the public service. 9. I must confess, however, that I very much doubt whether the Shah’s project of a steam navy will ever be carried into effect, nor do I consider that it is a result to he desired, or to be promoted by us, except in so far as not seeming to thwart the Shah’s wishes. The difficulties of providing the funds appear to me almost insurmountable. Neither the Shah nor his ministers have probably formed any idea of the large sum required. The only feasible arrangement would be that an assignment should be made upon the customs of Bushire, and upon the revenues of Shiraz, but to this it is not likely that the Shah would be prevailed upon to consent. 10. Should there really seem a prospect of the establishment of a Persian war navy, it will be requisite to make provision beforehand that it should not be turned into a means of aggression against Muscat, or against any of the maritime Arab Chiefs with whom we have engagements, nor should Persia be permitted to revive obsolete claims to territory (to Bahrein, for instance), nor to interfere in any way with the acknowledged supremacy of the British Government in the Gulf, by w hich alone the lawlessness of the maritime Arabs is restrained. England and India are largely interested in the safety of commerce in these waters. Trade with India is increasing, and is likely to increase, if only proper facilities be given, and if the security that has of late existed be maintained. This security depends entirely upon the repressive policy of the British Government. 11. It must also be recollected that any dimi nution of the prestige of British power in the Gulf and in the neighbouring countries would probably react more or less upon India, and be productive of injurious effects, especially in certain provinces, such as Sind, Hyderabad in the Deccan, and Kattywar, and among those Native Princes and Chiefs who employ Arab retainers and mercenaries, and into whose territories there is a constant influx of immi grants from the shores of Hadramant and Oman.While considering the intimate connexion of the interests of British Indian subjects, of the subjects of allied Native States, and of India gene- lally, with this portion of the dominions of Persia, and the necessity of dealing with questions that may arise, not merely with reference to local and tem porary objects, but on the basis of a large and com prehensive policy applicable to our widely extended empire in India, the further question mooted in these papers, as to the proper Department which should conduct our relations with Persia, is naturally suggested. 13. It will, I think, be admitted, that if it were not for our Indian empire, British relations with Persia would be shorn of half their importance. The chief matters which form the subject of diplo matic discussion and correspondence between the two countries, have more or less reference to India. This is the only ground on which the annual payment of 12,000/. for the Persian mission from the Indian revenues can be justified. 14. There is one subject especially which is assuming larger proportions every day, and occu pying the attention of all whose duty it is to watch over the safety and progress of our Indian territories, the question of Central Asia. I am not one of those who view the advance of Russia with any undue alarm, but I nevertheless recognize, in the gradual approach of a great European power towards our North-Western frontier, an element of disturbance which should not be overlooked. 15. I know well, from experience (having held a political appointment on the Indus), the spirit that animates the warlike Mahomedan tribes of those countries, and their traditional impressions of plunder gained in former invasions of Hindostan. These impressions, though dormant at present, may at any favourable moment be roused into activity, and when combined with religious fanatacism represent a formidable danger not to be despised by prudent statesmen. 16. Such questions are little understood, and, consequently, little appreciated by diplomatic agents educated in the purely English scnool; they are, on the other hand, very familiar to the thoughts, studies, and experiance of Indian political officers, and are thoroughly grasped and mastered by them in all their various bearings. 17. One great advantage, therefore, which would result from the transfer of the conduct of our re lations with Persia to the India Office would be, in my opinion, the power possessed by the Indian Se cretary of consulting those who had held high office in India, and had been in the habit of considering large political questions, and who would bring local knowledge and practical experience to bear upon many of the matters that would come up for discussion.18. An early opportunity would, I believe, be taken to remodel and reconstitute the Persian em bassy. At present, it is a post not only not coveted but, if I err not, absolutely shunned by the subor dinates of the diplomatic service. No young attache of any promise will go there, if he can avoid it, nor will he stay longer than he can help; the consequence is, that few acquire sufficient expe rience to be afterwards of any real service in the East, and that it is notorious that the embassy is too often composed of individuals not the best fitted to represent the British nation, at a Court where the embassies of other countries are upon a very efficient footing. 19. If the appointment rested with the Indian Government, young Officers of the Outram, Raw- linson, Edwardes, Kemball, stamp would be se lected. They would consider their nomination to the Persian embassy as the first step on the ladder of promotion, and would bring to their duties all that zeal and devotion which is the characteristic of Indian political Officers, and all those qualities which gain an ascendancy over the Asiatic mind, and tend to spread British influence far and wide throughout the continent of Asia. They would, moreover, form a nursery from whence our diplo matic agency in the East could most advantageously be supplied. 20. Sir George Clerk and Sir Bartle Frere, would, I feel certain, confirm what I have stated as to the importance of careful discrimination in selecting Officers to fill appointments such as those of the Persian embassy. There could not be a more striking illustration than the influence exer cised by Sir Henry Rawlinson, when he held for a short time the post of Ambassador at Tehran. While we are sailing in smooth water, it does not much matter, but in the day of trial, which may come upon us suddenly, the services of Officers of the calibre and character of those I have indicated would prove of the highest value. 21. On the above grounds, I advocate the transfer of the superintendence of British relations with Persia to the Secretary of State for India. At the same time, I am aware that there are con siderations of importance which are in favour of allowing things to remain on their present footing. In the first place, these constant changes are in themselves an evil, more especially with Asiatic Courts. They have a tendency to unsettle and disturb the confidence placed in us, and thereby diminish our influence. 22. It must not be forgotten, also, that the presence of the representatives of great European powers, and of Turkey, at the Court of Persia, constantly gives rise to questions rather belonging to the Department of Foreign Affairs in England than to the Indian Minister’s, and that the course ot policy to be pursued with regard to countriesconterminous with Persia, involving a wide extent of frontier, conies undoubtedly more within the range of European than Indian diplomacy. 23. There is another point that ought not to be omitted. I he Shah of Persia is peculiarly sensi tive on the score of prerogative. I have always understood that a strong feeling exists, both with the Shah and his ministers, that it would involve a loss of dignity to carry on diplomatic relations with any Department but the Foreign Office. It is an element, though perhaps not a conclusive one, in the question of a change, that it should not be dis tasteful at the Court where it is proposed to be introduced. 24. If, however, I have some hesitation in ad vocating a change with regard to Persia, I have none^ in respect to Muscat, the affairs of the Gulf, and Zanzibar. I concur with the Government of India that our relations with those countries should be placed entirely under the Indian authorities, primarily under the Government of Bombay, to be supervised by the Government of India, and then in the regular course by the Secretary of State for India. 25. Our relations with Muscat, and with the Arab maritime Chiefs, have been conducted from the earliest times by the Government of Bombay; all our treaties and engagements have been made by the Indian authorities, and, from the proximity and constant intercourse between India and Arabia, there must necessarily be more exact knowledge possessed in India, and better means of forming correct conclusions upon any points of difference that may arise between the inhabitants of these countries that can be available at the Foreicn Office. 26. The same reasoning applies, though in a less degree, to Zanzibar, and it is very desirable that the anomalous state of things at present existing there, in respect to the division of authority, should cease. I he Political Agent should no longer be permitted to correspond direct with the Foreign Office. He should correspond with, and receive ■ his instructions only from, the Government of Bombay. His appointment should also rest with that Government. 27. The important point as to the unity of the controlling authority having been determined, the question next come what is the policy to be pursued in the actual condition of affairs between Muscat and Zanzibar. ^ 28. During the long reign of the Imam Syud Saeed, who succeeded to Muscat in 1807, and died in 1856, and w ho was a firm ally of the British Government, Zanzibar was a dependency of Muscat. At the death of Syud Saeed, he left Muscat to his son, Syud Thoweynee, and Zanzibar to another son^ Syud Majid, on condition of certain payments. 9638 a . u6 Disputes arose, and there is little doubt Syud Majid would have been compelled to succumb, but toi the intervention of the British Government. It must be borne in mind that Muscat is, as it were, the mother country, from whence the conquerors of Zanzibar arid the Arab settlements on the coast of Africa came, and that, if left to themselves, the warlike tribes of the Gulf would soon reassert their supremacy over their African conquests. 29. In 1861, a final and permanent arrangement was made by Sir William Coghlan, under the orders of Lord Canning, by which Zanzibar became independent, paying annually 40,000 dollars to Muscat in compensation of all claims. Since the accession of Syud Salim to Muscat, by the alleged murder of his father, Syud fhoweynee, in 1866, Syud Majid declines to pay the 40,000 dollars, on the ground that Syud Salim is a parricide and an usurper. 30. Syud Salim was, we are told, elected by the tribes to succeed his father, according to the usage of Oman. He was recognized by the Government of India, and the recognition was approved by the Secretary of State on the 28th of February 1867. On the 22d May 1867, the Viceroy addressed a letter to Syud Majid, announcing his intention to enforce the payment of the subsidy. Sir William Coghlan, a high authority on these matters, having been consulted by the Secretary of State, sent in an elaborate memorandum, dated 17th August 1867, in which he expresses his concurrence in the letter and policy of the Viceroy, and states that “ in his esti- “ mat ion it would have the worst possible effect “ throughout Oman, and the Persian Gulf, if the 4&lt; British Government allowed the plain terms of “ its arbitrament to be set aside by such flimsy pre- “ texts.” 31. Syud Salim depends upon the Zanzibar sub sidy to enable him to pay his tribute to the Wa- habees, his assignment to Toorkee, and other demands. The Government of India distinctly state, that British “ good faith ” is involved in the maintenance of the subsidy, and they strongly de precate any measures that may tend to weaken the Sultan of Muscat. There is no doubt that for a series of years it has been the policy of the British Government to support Muscat; the late Syud Saeed, on more than one occasion, owed the preser vation of his power to British interference in his behalf. 32. I feel strongly that the character of Syud Salim does not entitle him to our sympathy or sup port, but he is not the first eastern ruler who has risen to a throne by the shedding of blood. Syud Saeed, himself, stabbed his uncle and stepped into his place, and the Arab tribes did not think the worse of him for the outrage. Syud Salim was elected by those who had the right to elect him, and he has been acknowledged both by the Indian andraHH Home Governments. We must deal with him as the de facto Ruler of Muscat, and if we do so deal with him, we shall have the right to exact from him a strict adherence to the engagements of the Muscat State with us, both as regards the slave trade, and the preservation of the peace of the Gulf. We must tell him plainly, that we will not permit him to commence any hostile movement against our ally the King of Persia, and that we shall hold him responsible for any piratical outrages committed by the Arabs under his jurisdiction. 33. We may thus conciliate Persia, and do away with her plea for the establishment of a navy, and we shall maintain the position of a quasi-protec torate, which we have always held in the Gulf, but from which, since the abolition of the Indian Navy, we have shown a disposition to recede. If we do recede, it is certain that, sooner or later, anarchy and confusion will follow, and that we shall be obliged to interfere at last, and do over again, pro bably at a heavy expenditure of money and life, the work that we did so effectually in former times. 34. It is quite clear to me that the British Govern ment alone has the will and the power to keep peace in the Gulf, but we must employ more adequate means, and have a more efficient system than at present, or we shall lose the ascendancy we have so long maintained. While this ascendancy exists, and the prestige of our power has suffered no dimi nution, we are in a far better position than we otherwise could be for carrying out more effective measures for the suppression of the slave trade. 35. We are informed that at the present time, in reference to the question of the subsidy, Sultan Majid is willing to make certain concessions, by which the transport of slaves will be restricted within narrower limits along the coasts of his domi nions. I attach very little importance to a further limitation of the line of coast, if the conveyance of slaves from one part of the coast to another, or to Zanzibar, be still permitted. The door will still be open for evasion of the engagement, and facilities will be afforded for converting the transport into traffic. We should strike at the root of the evil, and pro hibit the slave trade entirely. It is everywhere prohibited, on both coasts of Africa, except in the Zanzibar dominions. 36. Our proposition to Syud Majid should be, an extension to all his territories of the third additional article of the Treaty of 1839, with Syud Saeed, in regard to the Soomalies, which provides that the sale of males or females, young or old, being con trary to Mahomedan law, shall be considered as piracy, and all people convicted of being concerned in such an act after a specified date shall be punished as pirates. We should need the coopera tion of the French Government in this arrangement, but there is no reason to doubt that it would be freely given. 9638 a. C37. Syud Majid has long anticipated that more stringent measures for the suppression of the slave trade would be adopted by the British Government, and he has, I am told, commenced building a town and residence on the main land, with a view to such a contingency. Still, we cannot expect him to agree to the sweeping proposition above stated, which would be most unpopular with his Chiefs and people, would take away a great proportion of the cultivators of his own estates, and would deprive him of the chief source of his revenue, without an adequate equivalent. 38. The payment of this equivalent, compared with the results to the general interests of humanity, would be an insignificant sum for the Imperial and Indian revenues to share between them. We might put it at ten thousand pounds, more or less. The amount stated to be realized annually by the Sultan of Zanzibar from the tax on the importation of slaves is about 40,000 dollars. We might add 10,000 dollars, to make the bargain more palatable, and, what would doubtless offer a great inducement to Majid to look upon the arrangement with favour, we might further undertake to pay the subsidy to Salim, giving Majid the surplus, and thus relieving him of a continually recurring obligation, mos obnoxious to his feelings, and sparing us the ne cessity of perhaps being compelled to resort to coercive measures on behalf of a ruler whose con duct we cannot but regard with abhorrence. 30. It would probably be desirable to fix a date after which the measure would come into full operation, and arrangements might also be made for the gradual reduction and final extinction of the payment, on certain conditions being realized. We know that there is a supply of free labour to a con- sideiable extent in Zanzibar, from the original inhabitants of the island, from the slaves of British subjects set free, from immigrants from the African coast and islands in the vicinity, and from other countries. This supply would increase with the demand, and remove any pressure in respect to want of labour, but it is not requisite to enter into these details. 40. As a set off to the annual charge for com pensation, there would be the prospective reduction ot the African squadron, and the extension of legi timate trade. It is stated by General Rigby 5 * that “ a S reat ^crease in the trade of Zanzibar, and in “ tae £ ro wth of agricultural produce, took place after the abolition by treaty of the slave trade to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea.” When we put down piracy in the Persian Gulf, the Chiefs principally concerned took to the slave traffic* if we deprive them of this outlet to their maritime energies, they will probably turn their attention to lawful commerce. 41. The policy I have recommended may per- aps be considered to involve an undue amount of9 interference. I believe it to be the only policy that will be understood by those with whom we have to deal. Our position in India, and the position we have acquired in the Gulf, demand that we should maintain the supremacy which has been conceded to us by the various Arab States and Chiefs with whom we have from time to time formed engage ments. We should not be justified in shrinking from enforcing the obligations of those engage ments. It is only thus that we can effectively pro tect commerce, the interests of British and Indian subjects, and the general interests of humanity and civilization. Wm. J. Eastwick.
