This estimate would be exclusive of the cost of packing, freight, etc., and v/ould not include masts or sails which the Admiralty did not consider woudd—im—any oase-be c^nJL_ necessary. The gig could be made in approximately 2 months and if an order K) wa-e placed at once it is possible that the boat could be transported from Malta to Muscat in one of His Majesty^ ships which would vp ' I a 11. a . aap^y-dr August.

Mr,Lyndsay of the firm of Sir J.H. Biles &amp; Co., Naval Architects ,/h^s made “pj- ,r further enquiries in regard to the motor ^ o S ( \ ^ y l30at * and 0 Pi n i on that it would be quite impossible to obtain a new boat at anything like your maximum figure of £4,000. You will recall that Messrs.Thorneycroft's estimate was for £9,500. As regprds secondhand vessels there are several factors which limit the choice of a suitable boat very appreciably. These are:- Age. Material of the hull. Speed. Type of engine. Nature of fuel. Suitability of accommodation. Minimum length of vessel to enable the gun to be satisfactorily mounted. Cost. I will take^ the above points in the order in which they are stated. As the vessel is to operate under comparatively severe climatic conditions as compared with this country, the Naval Architects are of the opinion that a boat more than 1C years old would not be an economic proposition. Sven if a motor engine is well maintained, an engine which is much older than this is not only liable to readily break down, but the/ 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38the provision of new ps.rts and spares hecones increasingly difficult. Most vessels available in this country have been built for service here, where worm and the other difficulties of tropical service are not encountered. Even under the best conditions the hull, if of wood, would require to be sheathed to a little above the waterline, and the behaviour of the hull structure itself, unless new and specially designed wrould be somewhat doubtful. A. steel hull costs appreciably more and is not so suitable for maintenance and repair in service. iASliAsd*. The speed of 10 knots^ speci f ied involves quite a large engine on a boat of this size, and a, reduction of one knot on this speed if acceptable, would be of assistance^. In most cases ^Se^speeds quoted are speeds on trial of the boat as originally designed, and the additional weight of the gun, ammunition, protective plating, etc., would reduce this original trial speed by an amount which could only be determined on trial after conversion. The Naval Architects are of the opinion that a diesel engine is the only suitable type, as a petrol engine require^ such a large quantity of fuel, that the provision of bunkers for a radius of action of 80C miles would present a very serious problem. The Naval Architects consider that the /^ F Draft Paper Department r^, c*A&gt;e^ tz li^ dr^J. 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38 special requirenents of the proposed ^rvi^e would render very extensive S^-Au/vd fa/i/i-t-A alterations necessary snd thot the precise cost thereof could not be estimated until one particular vessel had been selected.

We have been in touch with various Brokers of Yachts and have most carefully considered the many varied offers which they have placed before us. There are however several factors including - First cost. Age. Material of the hull. Speed. Type of engine. Nature of fuel. Suitability of accommodation. Minimum length of vessel to enable the gun to be satisfactorily mounted. which limit the choice of a suita.ble boat very appreciably. We will take the points in the order in which th§r are stated, and also the given figure of approximately £4,000 as the total cost of the vessel delivered at her destination. Dealing with the first cost, we have to make the following deduction from the figure of £4,000. These allowances are onlySir J. H. BILES &amp; Co. - 2 estimated, 'but they may he considered as close approximations This deducted from the basic figure only allots £1720 for the boat, and*it would be therefore necessary to very substantially increase ^the limit figure to obtain a satisfactory vessel. As the vessel is to operate under comparatively severe clims.tic conditions as compared with this country, we a.re of the opinion that a boat more than 10 years old would not be an economic proposition. Even if a motor engine is well maintained, an engine which is much older than this is not only liable to readily break down, but the provision of new parts and spares becomes increasingly difficult.

The speed of 10 knots specified involves quite a large engine on a boat of this size, and SS a reduction of one knot on this speed if acceptable, would be of assistance. In most cases the speeds quoted are speeds o# trial of the boat as originally designed, and the additional weight of the gun, ammunition, protective plating etc. would reduce this original trial speed by an amount which could only be determined on trial after conversion. :&gt;t^ a/ &gt; We are of the opinion that a diesel engine is the only suitable type, as a petrol engine requires such a large quantity of fuel, that the provision of bunkers for a radius of action of 800 miles would present a very serious problem. It is apparent after the examination of such pla.ns as are ^ v N.^ - available for the craft offered,■that the special requirements of the proposed service would render very extensive alterations necessarry, and the precise cost thereof could not be estimated until one particular vessel had been selected. The effect on the trim of the boat of the addition of the weight of the gun, ammunition, gun stiffening etc. forward could not be determined in advance, for the reason given in the previous paragraph. In this connect ion'we find' that the vessel would require to be not less than 68 to 7° f t. in length to carry the gun satisfactorily.The launch will he mainly required for coastal patrol for Customs purposes.

The price of this last named vessel is understood to he £8,500. For the other boats the prices of course vary but the lowest I understand is £6,000. Messrs* Thomycroft will be pleased to show H.H. some 55 ft. boats now being built at Hampton, Middlesex, and they will be happy to arrange for a car to take him down to their works. We could also arrange for a representative of our Naval Architects to go down if desired.
