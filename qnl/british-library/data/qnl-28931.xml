Dear Symon, You will remember that we discussed over the telephone the case of Miss Phyllis B. Knowles, who had been engaged by the Bahrein Petroleum Co. to proceed to Bahrein to take up a post as school mistress. After you had seen Ballantyne you telephoned to say that no objection was seen to our granting a visa for Bahrein and that you would like to have particulars of the case. We granted the visa on the 4th instant. On the 6th instant we received a telegram from the Political Agent authorising the grant of a visa which shov/s, presumably, that the Oil Company had in the meantime got into communication with Bahrein.

I have iince discussed the matter with both Companies* Petroleum Concessions, Limited, are not in any case allowing any ladies to go to Bahrein and the Kuwait Oil Company apparently themselves take the most careful steps to ensure that suitable accorranodation is available before any ladies go to Kuwait. It is therefore unnecessary for you to take any action on my letter of the 26th September* Would you please regard it as cancelled? Yours sincerely, J.W.

We quite appreciate the difficulties of accommodation, and Packer will be punctilious in con sulting Colonel Loch before we allow any ladies to go to Bahrain. There will, of course, be no question of their going to Qatar or the Trucial Coast, unless and until con ditions there are very different from the present. Yours sincerely. - M.J.

Colonel Loch’s suggestion appears to be quite reasonable, and no doubt the Company will agree that it is. Perhaps you would kindly confirm that the party going down next month will not be taking any womenfolk, or, if they are, that they will conform with this procedure. Colonel Loch also refers to the fact that women will /not in any case be allowed to go to Qatar or the Trucial Coast. I imagine thar this is already clearly understood by 3 ^our people.
