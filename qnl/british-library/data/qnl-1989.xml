Hyslop , M.D. Mohamreh. —Mohamreh,* a Persian town, is situated (lat. 30° 26' N. and long. 48° 13' 30'' E.) on the HafFer canal, which connects the Karoun river and the Shut-al-Arab, at a distance of about half a mile from the latter, on the left bank. The town on the north side of the Haffer is enclosed by plantations of the date palm. The population is composed chiefly of Persians and Arabs of the Chaab tribe. The breadth of the HafFer here is about two hundred yards; the tide rises and falls as much as nine feet, during' the ebb leaving a bank of filthy mud, con sisting mostly of decomposing animal and vegetable matter. Beyond the date plantations, both to the north and south, extensive marshes and rice swamps exist. Busreh. —Busreh is situated in lat. 30° 31' N., long.^T? 50' E., on the right bank of the Shut-al-Arab, at a distance of about nu miles from the sea. A narrow creek intersects the town in its whole length, and as the rise and fall of the tide is as great as at Mohamreh, the slimy banks are there also, but giving out a more noxious effluvium, from the greater quantity of refuse from the town. Busreh at one time was a place of great importance and much trade, but now it is comparatively a ruin, and the population, which consists of Arabs, Persians, Turks, Jews, Abyssinians, and some Indians, has dwindled to a small proportion of its former numbers. The chief occupation of the inhabitants is trading with Baghdad, the Persian Gulf, and India. A considerable trade in drugs is carried on; gums and gum-resins are brought from Baghdad and shipped to India, while in return Indian medicines, spices, and drugs are carried to Baghdad and the north. There are some fruit gardens at Busreh, pro ducing pomegranates, figs, apricots, &amp;c., but the great produce of the place is dates, which are largely exported, and from which the principal revenue is derived. Vegetables are grown sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants. Between forty and fifty years ago an extensive marsh was allowed to form and remain on the north and west of the town, which in summer and autumn causes fever, often of a malignant nature. Before the formation of this marsh the climate was tolerably healthy, and Busreh was not then, as now, shunned by Europeans j indeed, for a series of years, the East India Company had a factory there, and in later times a Residency, and among their large establish ments the mortality was by no means great. Climate. —The climate of Mohamreh and Busreh is very different from that of Baghdad and the country north of the marshes. In the former, the air is constantly loaded with moisture, which, in summer, acts as a vapour bath, producing and maintaining a copious and exhausting perspiration. I have made no extended thermometrical observations in this country, except at Baghdad, the mean annual temperature of which is 76°, the thermometer having an annual range of 90°, but in the lower parts of * Mohamreh, though not in Turkish Arabia, as it is now a Persian town, is noticed in this report, becansei t is contiguous to Turkish territory, and, from its position, must in the future be a place of importance. Moreover, it was once occupied by a British force, and may be again. 10928. I. 188. Athe country the actual temperature is not so high, although the heat is much more oppressive. In Busreh, the daily range of the thermometer is much less than in Baghdad ; in the latter the nights are generally cool, even in the height of summer; in the former the nights are almost as hot as the days. The constitution, being enfeebled by the relaxing and enervating effects of the moist heat and by the want of refreshing sleep, becomes more sensitive to the influence of malaria, and hence arise the fevers common during summer, but more general and fatal in autumn. Fever. —The fever of this low swampy country is of a totally different character from that generally met with in the north. Intermissions are seldom seen, and remissions even are rarely obtained; organic visceral complications are almost universal, the liver and spleen being chiefly affected, and not infrequently the disease assumes a malignant typhoid type. Should the patient recover from the first attack, the fever still lingers upon him for months or years, even, it may be, after his return to England. A vessel with an European crew visiting Busreh between April and October would, in the course of a few days, have many men on the sick list, as 1 ha\e several times seen in May and June; indeed experience has shown that Europeans cannot reside in Busreh during the summer and autumn without great risk. ' Cholera. Cholera, too, has been more fatal in the south than in the north, and on two occasions it has lingered in the towns lono- after the epidemic had passed away. As the situations of Mohamreh and Busreh are similar, so are their climates; situated on creeks, on a low alluvial soil, and surrounded by swamps, it is not to be wondered at that disease pievails, and that the mortality is great. Moh.mreh.—ln 1849 and 1850 a coasiderabJe party of Europeans was located at Mohomreh, where they were encamped on a dry Xn ahont a m ,le to the north of the town, just outside the gardens they suff^ seyereJy from feyer which proyed ycry fatal amolS thci^scort ^ Turkish tioops, but were affected with a disagreeable comnlainf fn was not caused by anything deleterio,., t i f lhat thls ^Thc Eurof ^ lyin8 0ff Mohamrei r S Xcd in the same waT^' 8 from this naSL alTyoSngtn'the^ 6 ^ n' 1857 ' suff ered Mohramreh. vomiting in the month of April at Bushire and HiSt0 Ih- 0f ^ ®« ra ^7Fu3ffiLt ,1 *t!Thelte X B r r C f fTT a tt upon th. s subject, may not be without interest- bearm S excited Hfe of a^campai^rto' the^enta' 3 and habits of a standing camn cnnr. i 8edentar y&gt; inactive life and loose relish for their mealf, tl.ci? predl™Xn Z ^ ^^hed m the preyalence of nausea and yomitine- aftpr ^ v- J aundice . and Ih, # ' Transactions of the uu TTT ^hysieai Society of Bombay,' Vol. IX., p. 313 regiment, and indeed, I believe, almost every man of the force. The complaint, tor complaint it was, aod a very annoying one too, though not dangerous I admit, I could not account for in a manner satisfactory to myself. The natives, as they always do, attributed it to swallowing flies, and soon became converts to this opinion ; they, no doubt, did soil and corrupt every article of diet or whatever else was left for the shortest period exposed, and, if anything could give one an idea of the third plague inflicted on the land of Egypt in days of old, it was here realized in perfection. Many attributed the complaint to the presence ol antimony in the water, as it is found in the hills from which the streams issue, but none could be detected in it, and I consider that the real cause lay in the new life and habits we had entered upon. The disease was characterized by no peculiar symptoms besides those men tioned. There was nausea, most frequently in the middle of, or imme diately after, a meal, suddenly followed by vomiting, till the whole contents of the stomach were ejected, and the feeling of nausea con tinued for some time afterwards, but gradually subsided, very probably to return again, however, at the following meal. In the matter ejected there was seldom anything either bilious or acid, and the bowels were in a natural state, or perhaps rather confined. This state of things might occur once, or might recur frequently, and then the men would apply at the hospital for an emetic or a dose of physic, but seldom to be admitted. From not being able to retain anything on the stomach, and consequently from want of due sustenance, the men felt languid and low-spirited, but no other permanently bad effects resulted from it, and after we moved back to Peshawur on the 7th May there was scarcely a case of it.' Dr, Arnott's theory of the cause of this complaint could not hold good in the instances • mentioned at Mohamreh, where the circumstances of the men affected were so dissimilar to those of the Fusiliers. The fly theory was the favourite one at Mohamreh, but neither was it quite satisfactory. At Busreh the flies were not a plague as at Mohamreh, but still sufficiently numerous to be a nuisance and annoyance, but this vomiting after meals was unknown there. Report by Dr, Miller. — The following extracts from the Annual Report of the 28th Regiment, Bombay Native Light Infantry, for the year ending 31st March 1858,* by Surgeon J. H. Miller, M.D., also bear upon the climate of Mohamreh :— &lt;c On the 26th March 1857, the successful storming and capture of the forts of Mohamreh placed us in occupation of the plain imme diately adjoining. This ground was objectionable, owing to situation, drainage, and quality of soil, rendered all the more apparent by the rainy and unsettled state of the weather which prevailed during the months subsequent to our arrival. The position of the camp was on a spot of land nearly perfectly flat, surrounded on three sides by the river, the banks of which, for upwards of half a mile in breadth, were densely covered with the date palm. To irrigate these, numerous creeks or cuttings were made from the river, the water of which rose and fell with the tide twice in the twenty-four hours. Beds of slimy mud, with a rank and luxuriant growth of vegetation, were thus daily exposed to the action of a tropical sun, and a better nidus for the pro duction of marsh miasmata could hardly be found anywhere. We were encamped about two thirds of a mile from this hill (?) of trees, the soil being a soft alluvial clay, abounding in saline earths. Owing to this latter'circumstance, the ground was never thoroughly dry ; and when rain fell, which it did on several occasions, the surface soon becomes covered with water, which remained until removed solely by evaporation. * ' Transactions of the Medical and Physical Society of Bombay,' No. IV., New Series, p. 268.281.

W e remained thus till near the end of May, when we were removed to Bushire. . . . i'e evacuation of the place (Mohamreh) was rendered nearly im perative, as the season for the river overflowing its banks was lapid y approaching, and our encamping ground would speedily have been under ' The change to Bushire was acceptable also for other reasons. The weather at Mohamreh bad latterly become oppressively hot,* and the nights were sultry. Dysentery and diarrhoea prevailed to a cousideraole extent, and fever would doubtless soon have been added. Report by Surgeon The following on the same subject is taken from the Annual Report of the 26th Regiment, Native Infantry, for the year 1867—58,t by Surgeon J. E. Batho :— ' The army was encamped (at Mohamreh) in two divisions, on a low plain of considerable extent, about a mile from the river; it bore traces of having been recently flooded, and after its occupation by our troops, extremely heavy rains fell in the latter part of April, converting the soil into a deep and tenacious mud, which interrupted com munication, gave rise to sickness, and added materially to the dis comforts under which the men had lately suffered, e.g., detention on board ship in Bushire roads for a fortnight in heavy weather, when the diet of the majority was confined to pulse. . . . Under these cir cumstances, to which were added exposure to the sun, labour in the conveyance of tents and stores from the bunder to the camp, and heavy night duties, some increase of sickness naturally resulted ; it was not, however, very great, being for the month of April only 38 in excess of the preceding month (or 84) ; of this number 19 were fevers, 19 affections of the bowels, 13 dysentery, 7 pulmonary complaints, and 15 contusions, &amp;c., the effects of disembarking. The weather (April) was becoming hot and sultry during the day, though the nights were generally cool; the maximum of the thermometer was 100°, and the minimum 50°. On the 1st of May there were 26 in hospital, chiefly cases of fever, dysentery, and diarrhoea ; the whole had a sickly appearance, and seven or eight were in a feeble condition. . . On the 11th of May the regi ment was in orders for Bushire. . . . Eor some time before the departure of the army from Mohamreh, the climate had become extremely warm and oppressive. At the beginning of May the mercury rose to above 100° m a good Bengal tent (with a thick numda between the flies as 0 early as 10 a.m. In the double-poled hospital tents it rose to 111 and in the rowties it must have been higher than this. he ettect ot this extreme heat tended to produce inordinate stimulation o le organic functions of the body, while the animal functions were ausmL't^l Knt/i 0 ? 1 ''' 88 / the biliary secretion in particular became deteriorated, as manifested by the presence of jaundice d affections of the chylopoetic viscera among officers and men.' tnnil 'Lf 0 K • Uat ' J 'b?' at a sll0rt distailoe from Mohamreh and Busreh ncTh and easf 8 J m T t0 . be f0Und ' At 110 S reat dist ^ ^ ^ and east ot Mohamreh you ascend from the alluvial nlain and the moist pestilential air of the marshes to an elevated Z d^ regfon,5 ^ iixuccu, uiiere is no spot to winch it has not been carried m bye^one days (as the ruins of mno-nifin^f ^ Q i 0 i 0 ^,f-~~ Zobeir ' about nme miles from Busreh, is situated on a hard elevated, gravelly soil to the south-west of the marsh, and as the prevailing winds are the north-west and south-east, it thus escapes the influence of the malaria. Whether it be from this cause, or from the nature of the soil, the climate is as different as possible from that of -Busreh. There are no plantations to prevent free ventilation, and the heat is dry and not oppressive; there, fever is little known, and cholera has never been seen (1851), except as solitary imported cases. This is so well known to the inhabitants of Busreh, that all whose means and circumstances permit retire to Zobeir in summer and when cholera Koorna . Koorna is a small village of mud.huts, placed in the ande between the Euphrates and Tigris, at their junction, at a distance of 50 miles from Busreh. The two rivers, by their confluence at this point, form the Shut-al-A.rab, a noble river, lined on both banks, to the sea, by extensive plantations of date palms. It has a course of about a hundred and thirty miles to the Persian Gulf, and is navigable by ships of large size. The inhabitants of Koorna suffer much from fever, and have^a sallow, unhealthy look. Koot-al-amarah. —Between Koorna and Baghdad, on the Tigris, there is not a single town or village to be seen, except at Koot-al -Amarah, about half way between these two places. From this spot a large canal, called Shut-al-Hye, runs to the south for a hundred miles, carrying water from the Tigris to the Euphrates, which it enters about 15 miles to the north of Sook-esh-Shiukh. Sook-esh-Shiukh. —This is a walled Arab town, and is a place of con siderable commercial importance. Cholera, in its different epidemics, has always* travelled from Busreh to Baghdad by way of this place, from which it has demanded its usual number of victims. Fever, how ever, is neither general nor fatal, and Sook-esh-Shiukh is reckoned healthy. From about 20 miles below this place to Koorna, almost the whole country between the two rivers is covered with water, which is poured out at various places by the Euphrates and Tigris, especially appears. 10928. * Written in 1854.

Baghdad is situated on the river Tigris, in lat. 33° 19' 40 ' N., and Ion' 44° 26'E., in the centre of a large alluvial plain, which is intersected by the Wo great rivers, Euphrates and Tigr^ The soi ls a deep and rich alluvium, and the country almost perfectly level, thickly dotted over with mounds, the ruins of ancient cities towns, and canals. Along the banks of the river for some miles, both above and ' )cl0 ^ citv, besides date plantations, there are numerous gardens, yielding a considerable produce of fruit and vegetables. V ith the exception of a few cultivated spots in the neighbourhood of towns and villages, how- ever, the whole country is an arid waste, which requires only water to make it a fertile land. Tigris.—At Baghdad, the breadth of the Tigris is 871 feet from bank to bank; the depth varies at different seasons from (3 to 25 feet. 1 here are two annual rises of the river, one in the beginning ol wintei from rain, the other in spring, caused by the melting ol snow on the mountain ranges of Armenia, from which the river has its sources, at an approxi mate height of 5,050 feet. The winter rise is insignificant and irregular, but that in spring is quite the reverse. The volume of water is observed to increase generally about the end of March, and the increase continues till the middle of April, from which time it falls slowly and gradually until October, when it is at its minimum size. The rise varies much in different years, but it is never less than ten or twelve feet; when it exceeds eighteen it overflows the banks, and causes more or less mischief according to the suddenness of the rise and the volume of water spread over the country. In 1849 and 1850 the rises were greater than any since 1831; the partial and badly constructed embankments gave way, inundations resulted, and, on both occasions, they presented the appearance of a sea from Baghdad to Busreh. The former city was surrounded by the flood, and in many instances the courtyards and cellars of the houses were filled with water. When the river began to fall and the floods to subside, the heat of summer, acting on an immense tract of marsh, pro duced fever of no ordinary virulence, which, in the first of these years, carried off 11,000 people in Baghdad and its suburbs. Climate. —The climate of Baghdad presents a considerable variety of aspect at the different seasons. We have the torrid summer of the tropics, the cold winter of the north, and the mild and genial spring and autumn of Southern Europe. The hottest months are July and August when the mean temperature is about 95° The coldest months' are IJeceniber and January, in which the mean temperature is a little over ' / h -December and January frost is not uncommon, and ice is occasionally seen. March and April are the two most pleasant months'S&gt; 5o 7 in the year; the gardens are then in full foliage, and the atmosphere is loaded with the perfume of the orange blossom, which is often carried on the breeze to a considerable distance. In August and September there are occasional hot winds from the north-east, during which the air is obscured with very fine dust, which penetrates everywhere. The thermometer has been seen as high as 117° at ten o'clock at night during one of these winds. The prevailing wind is the north-west. East and west winds are rare, and occur only during thechan^o trom north-west to south-east and vice versa. The southerly wind has always a depressing effect, producing langour, headache, and general malaise. In addition to these, it is often observed that diarrhoea and vomiting are prevalent, especially in summer. Persons liable to fever or suffering from chronic disease feel this change of wind more than those in good health. The city of Baghdad is situated on both banks of the Tigris, the two portions being connected by a bridge of boats; that on the east or left bank is the largest. The walls enclose an area of about 2,560 acres, but a great part of this is unoccupied by houses. There are many gardens within the walls, and there is a large vacant space on the north, east side, covered by ruins of houses and pools of stagnant and putrid water. The streets are narrow and confined, the houses generally small and badly ventilated, and into many of the crowded bazaars neither sunshine nor wind ever penetrates. Almost every house has a summer apartment called a ' sirdaub,' corresponding to the tah-khana of Bengal, to which the inhabitants retire during the great heat of the day, spending the evenings and nights on the roofs, which are flat, and the mornings in the upper rooms. The sirdaub is a cellar or room, the floor of which is more or less under the level of the courtyard, with an arched roof and paved with bricks, from which the sun and heated air are carefully excluded. These places are rather dark, and, in the beginning of summer, damp, and a harbour for mosquitoes, but there is no difficulty in choosing between a room in which the thermometer stands at 106° or 110° and the sirdaub, in which the temperature is not more than 80° or 85°. Those who have convenience and can afford country residences, build what are called chartaks ' for summer use, in which, if the situation is good, that is, well exposed to the north-west wind, the temperature can be reduced to 70°. The chartak is an apartment with a thick roof, and walls formed of tatties ; the roof is composed of mats and brushwood and a thick coating of mud ; tha tatties are very simple in their construction being made of a light framework of date wood, the interstices being filled with camel-thorn. These are kept constantly wet, and the breeze blowing through causes a strong evaporation, which produces a con siderable degree of cold. The change, however, from the heat without to the comparative cold atmosphere within, and vice versa, is rather trying. In the event of the occupation of any part of this country south of Mosul by European troops, it must be a recognized fact that military movements during the hot weather are impracticable. If possible, the troops should arrive in the beginning of winter, in preference to the end of it. Erom October to May the weather is cool, but from May to October prolonged exposure to the sun would be fatal, and even in tents the danger from insolation would be great. Indeed, if practicable, European troops should be moved to the hills during the hot weather; if not, they should have capacious and airy barracks, cooled by tatties and punkahs. Mud huts with thick roofs afford good protection from the sun, especially when fitted with tatties. These huts can be quickly and inexpensively run up on the banks of a river, and date wood and camel-thorn are everywhere procurable. Commonly the nights are cool, even after the hottest days, and, although there are at times heavy dews, experience has not shown that sleeping in the open air has any injurious effect if due precations be taken to prevent sudden chills ; indeed, sleeping 10928. c8 indoors would be impossible. As sound and refreshing sleep, especially after the exhausting effects of a hot day, is necessary for the preservation of health and vigour, it would be well in this mat,cr to / of the country, when in barracks, of sleeping on the tops ol th., 10 . . during the hot months. Bedsteads. —Light bedsteads made of date wood, called 'sereers, can be procured in any quantity at a small cost, and are well adapted 101 hospitals. These could be fitted for mosquito curtains for special cases, and hospitals should be furnished with a quantity of netting for this purpose. Bags filled with chopped straw (tibn) make comfortable beds. A coarse kind of cotton is grown on the Euphrates which might be used for mattresses. Tf^citer. —Drinking water is drawn from the rivers, and filtered through large earthen jars, and afterwards exposed to the breeze in porous jugs, by which means a cold draught can always be had. I ce _—Ice or blocks of frozen snow could also be procured from the nearest mountains without much trouble. Clothing. —The clothing of the men should vary with the seasons. In summer light woollen material is preferable to cotton or linen ; in winter warm clothing is required. Snakes and scorpions. —There are not many poisonous snakes in the country, but there are one or two species which are dangerous, to be found chiefly in old wells and ruinous buildings. In the towns scorpions abound, and should be guarded against on summer nights. Date mark. —Twelve months after the arrival of an army in this country, probably half of their number would be suffering from the Baghdad boil, here called date mark,' and as it generally attacks the hands and feet in adults, a considerable portion might be incapacitated for duty. This disease is known all over this country. In Aleppo it is called ' ma l d'Aleppe,' or 'bouton d'Aleppe.' In the southern country it is called in Arabic ' nishan-al-tamar,' or ' date mark,' from the fact of its appearing in autumn, when the dates are ripe. In Busreh it is known amongst Europeans as the Busreh boil.' It affects all classes of the population, old and young, and is so universal that in Baghdad scarcely an individual can be found who has not suffered from it, and who does not bear its marks in unsightly scars on the face and extremities. It attacks all parts of the body except those covered witn hair, but principally the hands and feet in adults, and the face in children, riie sores in most instances appear in autumn, and continue from six months to a year. There are two different forms of the disease known as the ' male ' and the 'female.' In the beginning of both kinds it cannot be distinguished from a mosquito bite; indeed the natives believe that it is so. The 'male' boil then assumes he appearance of a small tubercle or pimple, of a purple colour, wliich never suppurates, it continues to enlarge, and becomes covered with a thick light-coloured crust, which, if detached, is immediately renewed and oTed. li C ^trtTft 0ff ' r f TV ^ .V uarges and contracts, but more generally it remains9 stationary after the first month, until it has run its course, and then it heals, leaving a pitted, depressed, dark coloured cicatrix. There is another affection which, although somewhat different from this, I have no hesitation in classing with it and calling a third form of i( date mark.' It is a tubercle, and nothing more. It seldoms attains a larger size than that of a pea, and gives very little uneasiness. It is always situated on the hands or feet. The tubercle is of a deep red colour, and on the top there is a minute white scale, which, being de tached, shows a small circular hole, from which a sanious looking fluid may be pressed. It is at first so like the sting of an insect that it is generally supposed to be so, but it continues for several months, and leaves a dark coloured mark exactly like that of the male (&lt; date mark.' The two first varieties generally occur together, but they never appear more than once in the same individual. This third variety always appears alone, and may occur several times in the same person, and seldom lasts more than four months. External and internal remedies have been tried without elfect. The native treatment consists merely in the application of a little sweet oil to the sores, or a leech or two in the neighbourhood when there is much inflammation. It has been supposed to be constitutional, and to be caused by something in the water used, but experience has convinced me that this is not the case. I would hazard the conjecture that the boil is caused by the deposition under the cuticle, by the mosquito or other insect, of the ova of some microscopic parasitic animalcules, which, in the process of growth and maturation, give rise to the sores and keep up the irritation until their course is run. At all events, a rigorous microscopic examination of the discharge from the sores might reveal the nature of the disease, and suggest the proper treatment. The most common diseases of this country are fevers, diarrhoea, rheumatism, and ophthalmia. Dysentery is rarely met with, and abscess of the liver equally so. It is unnecessary to enter more into detail on the sanitary means to be adopted and the precautions to be used by an Anglo-Indian army in this country. They may be summed up in a few words. Mohamreh, Busreh, and the low country should be avoided in summer and autumn; exposure to the sun in June, July, August, and September should be guarded against, and the heat of tents or barracks should be mitigated as much as possible. During the months of December, January, and Pebruary we have a different state of things to deal with. At that season warm clothing is necessary, and fires even might occasionally be used with advantage. As it is always desirable to have a station at no great distance, which might be used as a sanatorium for the more speedy and complete recovery of those affected with fever and chronic visceral complaints, it may be noted that we have for selection the whole range of the Luristan and Kurdistan mountains, the choice being determined by political considerations and the position of the army. The latter, however, is of less consequence, seeing that the Tigris is navigable as far as Samarreh, which is only a few days' march from an eligible position in Kurdistan. The Hamrin range of hills, which vary in height from 300 to 500 feet, are only about sixty or seventy miles to the north of Baghdad, and might be made useful in the hot weather, if removal to the more remote mountains were considered inexpedient. .
