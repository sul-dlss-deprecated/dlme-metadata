The Treasury some months ago drew my attention to the heavy cost of our communications and asked whether anything could be done about it. I accordingly requested the newly-appointed Director of Communications, Brigadier Gambier-Parry, to let me have a report, with recommendations. 2. A copy of the report, which I have now approved, is enclosed. It is, I am afraid, necessarily rather long but I shall be grateful if you and the appropriate members of your staff will study it carefully. You will see that its two main sections deal with telegrams and bags, respectively, and that a summary of the recommendations is given in the last paragraph. Summary of Report 3. As to telegrams, we hope to be able to cut them down con siderably in number and length (a) by producing time-tables for Foreign Office bags and for the air-mail and ordinary posts so that telegrams shall not be sent when other and cheaper means of communication would do; (b) by circulating revised instructions enjoining economy; and (c) by maintaining a close scrutiny of telegrams and making sure that the rules are observed. It is really, I think, mainly for lack of strength in the scrutiny staff that our existing rules have largely fallen by the wayside. 4. We hope, too, to be able to effect savings by extending the use of the Diplomatic Wireless Service and, in due course, the relay system for telegrams in suitable cases. The eventual introduction of machine cyphering and decyphering should also, in the long run, produce a great saving in man-power and money. His Majesty’s Representative at 14480 34411—42I 2 5. In regard to bags, the proposals for economy rest mainly on a ^ f reduction of load. In the first place we can curtail the private privilege mail. Subject to special arrangements for certain countries such as those in the Soviet orbit, the report recommends that we should confine the privilege to the staffs of Foreign Service posts and permanent delegations* abroad, that privileged mail should travel only by the cheapest (slowest) means, and that the carriage by bag of tobacco, which at present consti tutes a very heavy burden, should cease altogether. We also prop^* to reduce the quantity of print and to make a drastic cut in the distribu- of print volumes to posts abroad. 6 . A further proposal is that all Government Departments should make their own arrangements for the despatch of non-confidential material to our posts. This might perhaps go by the Urgent Government Mail Service. If, as we hope, the service is developed under expert Post Office administration, actual economy should result, quite apart from the saving on our vote. 7. Further economies on the bag service can be effected by curtail ing the runs of King’s Messengers to consulates, with consequent reduc tion in the number of King’s Messengers, and perhaps also by negotiating cheaper rates for the carriage of bags by captains of aircraft. This last point, however, is bound up with the question of security and we are not sure that it will be possible to make anything of it. We'intend, however, to make savings by reverting as far as may be practicable to the pre-war system of sending bags by sea, the cost of which is negligible, rather than by air and of using'air bags only for urgent material that could not be handled by telegraph or, if it could, would cost more by this means. General Effect of Recommendations 8 . In submitting the report to me, Brigadier Gambier-Parry pointed out that, for lack of statistics and for other reasons, he could not set figures, except here and there, against the proposed measures of economy. I agree with him, however, that considerable saving should result from them, both in man-power and in money. I also agree that the measures that he recommends will not impair the efficiency of our communications so far as official material is concerned and that in some respects they should enhance it. They will unfortunately involve some curtailment of the privileged use of the bag for private purposes, but I do not think that in present circumstances we can object to this. If properly applied they will also lead to a general reduction of tempo inthe transmission of official communications. As suggested in para graph 12 of the report, however, it is likely, I think, that only advantage will result from this. Action on the Report 9. I have therefore authorised Brigadier Gambier-Parry to intro duce the various measures recommended in the report and have told him tc \rry on. This must necessarily be a gradual process. Some of the proposals, however, can be put into force at once and others without much delay. Telegrams 10 . In regard to telegrams, we intend shortly to let you have a new booklet of instructions (including revised bag rules also) with time tables attached (see paragraphs 19 and 20 of the report). Until this is available, the recommendations in the report cannot be fully applied. I hope, however, that you will make sure that your staff adhere to existing instructions on this subject and that they will be guided by para graphs 11-13, 16, 18, 22-24, 34 (last two sentences) and 42 of the report. The purport of these paragraphs may be briefly summarised as follows' (i) cut down the number and length of telegrams to the bone; (ii) be sparing in the use of priority markings; (iii) do not confuse importance with urgency : the important is usually less urgent than the ephemeral; (iv) do not send an entire message by telegraph (and least of all by priority telegram) or in cypher, if only a part of it is urgent or secret as the case may be : in such cases two separate communications should be sent and one of them, if possible, by despatch or savingram; (v) with effect from 1 st January, 1948, introduce the Ci lettergram ” (to be so marked) as a deferred telegram (cf. the obsolete “ Dally ”) which would be numbered in the ordinary tele graphic series but would rank after the ordinary telegram in priority and might take up to three days to arrive; (vi) give a further trial to the system of using the prefix &lt;c Light ” on communications that, 'in your opinion, should be seen by the Secretary of State or an under-secretary (see my circular letter to Heads of Missions, No. 0103 of 1 st August, 1946); 34411—42 p 94 (vii) ascertain, report and use the cheapest telegraphic routes, which ^ are by no means always the shortest, more particularly when the standing cost of diplomatic wireless is taken into account. Most of the above precepts are of long standing but have not been much honoured of late years save in the breach. We hope now by close scrutiny of all telegrams to be able to enforce them and I trust that for your part you will always draw the attention of Communications Departmentto cases in which you think that wasteful telegrams have gone out f^n here. Bag Services 11 . The section of the report dealing wdth bags contains a number of recommendations that can be put into effect without further ado and I shall be glad if, pending the issue of the new bag rules, you will take the following steps :— (i) Official material. —Ensure that nothing is despatcned by moie costly means than can be justified by consideration of urgency, security, or safety (see paragraph 47 of the report). _ (ii) Private mail .—Subject to paragraph 56 and to the exception m favour of the correspondence of Heads of Missions in para graph 53— (a) see to it that bags containing private mail travel only by the cheapest route; (b) ensure that the use of the bag for private purposes is withheld from unauthorised persons (see para graph 54 ) and furnish and maintain lists as requested for use in the Foreign Office; (c) arrange, if necessary, that tobacco (see paragraph 55) shall not be sent to the Foreign Office for transmission by bag. 12 . If you consider that, under the terms of paragraph 56, any of the above steps would be unreasonable, having regard to the conditions in the country in which you reside, you will no doubt let us know and make out a case for exceptional treatment, saying in precisely which respect this is needed. I feel sure, however, that you will not ask for any relaxation of the general rule unless you are satisfied that it is essential from the point of view of the welfare and efficiency of your■\v oi staff. \ou will observe that, in any case, the correspondence of any of our officials in the Soviet orbit must travel by confidential bag. 13. The recommendations in paragraphs'60-66 relating to ( 1 ) a reduced circulation of print, ( 2 ) the abolition of the Weekly Political Intelligence Summary, and (3) a revised form of £C intel ” are now being put into force. As a general rule, £C intels ’ will be despatched weekly m the form of savingrams by bag, but this service will be supplemented b) ordinary telegrams as circumstances may require. 14. The security arrangements referred to in paragraph 67 of the report are not primarily a communications matter and will be dealt with separately. In view of them, however, copies of the enclosed report are not being sent to consuls under your superintendence. I am nevertheless sending them copies of this circular letter for their guidance and shall be glad if you will show them the report as opportunity offers. 15. As I have said, further instructions on the implementation of the report will follow and I am sure that you will do what you can at all stages to impress on your staff the real need to follow the instructions closely and to do everything possible to effect economy. As you know, our position in regard to foreign exchange is such that drastic cuts in our expenditure abroad must be made. Unless we can sufficiently curtail the cost of our ancillary services, we shall be unable to avoid reductions m stan or m the standard of living of our representatives to a point where the functions of our missions and consulates can no longer be discharged either adequately or without discomfort. 16. Mr. G. C. Allchin is the Inspector who has been appointed in accordance with paragraph 30 of the report to help in seeing the recom- mentations successfully carried through, and if posts have any points to raise, I shall be grateful if they will address themselves to him. and iliicli tiw it is your Yours sincerely, ORME SARGENT.CIRCULAR No. 0193 Top Secret [ Y 8638/8638/650 ] Foreign Office, 2^th November, 1947 Economies on Communications: Report IVIv dcSii* AS you know from the Chief Clerk’s circular letter No. 0177 of 14th October, we have recently had our communications system under examination with a view to effecting economies.

Yours sincerely, ORME SARGENT.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT TOP SECRET Copy No. 200 COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT, FOREIGN OFFICE REPORT BY DIRECTOR OE COMMUNICATIONS ON PROPOSED ECONOMIES Introduction High Costs On 16th April Sir Orme Sargent attended a meeting with Sir Edward Bridges and Sir Wilfrid Eady to discuss expenditure on the Foreign Service. The Treasury drew attention to the fact that the expenditure on Foreign Office communications had risen sharply since before the war and asked that this should be looked into. General Reasons 2 . There were many good reasons for a vast increase of expenditure, such as the mounting volume of public business under war and post-war conditions, rising costs, the bequeathal to the Foreign Office of the functions of the Ministry of^ Information (a heavy user of communications) and the Ministrv of Economic Warfare, and the assumption by Communications Department ^ of additional functions, some of them due to new security needs. In considering the charge for Foreign Office communications, it had also to be taken into account that much of the load carried by them (nearly a quarter of the telegrams and a heavier share of the bag load) appertained to other government departments. Moreover, many of the functions discharged by Communications Department were of an administrative and departmental order and not attributable to a purely signals organisation. 3. It was, however, agreed that I should be called upon to prepare a report showing what could be done to reduce the charge and at the same time increase the efficiency of the services provided. Interim Report 4. I submitted an interim report in June based on preliminary investigations and Sir Orme Sargent sent a summary of it to Sir Edward Bridges on 19th June. The interim report included in some detail suggestions for the internal reorganisa tion of the Communications Department itself as well as suggestions for the general improvement of the economical working of the communications of the Foreign Service. This report was at the same time referred to a committee of under-secretaries, who endorsed the main suggestions in principle and decided that the various proposals made in it, together with any others that might emeron should be examined in detail by special committees to be set up for the purpose of examining their application to the overall requirements of the Service I have therefore prepared my final report on the basis of the deliberations of these committees. Committees of Enquiry 5. Telegrams and bags. —I established two separate committees to consider telegrams and bag services. These committees each held five meetings which were attended by representatives not only of Communications Department but of other departments of the Office. Representatives of the under-secretaries we&gt;’^ also good enough to attend 6 ^ Government Despatch Service.—A small committee was formed to enquire into the.possible development of the Urgent Government Mail Service (under the new name of Government Despatch Service) as an alternative to the Foreign Office bag service for the carriage of non-confidential material for government departments. We held a meeting with representatives of the General Post Office 14367 34383MMMNSR mm® 2 the Central Office of Information and the British Council and attended two meetings at the Cabinet Offices. At the first of these, we met representatives of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The second was attended by representatives of all government departments and of the aircraft companies. 7. Distribution .—Another committee, under Mr. Halford, considered the distribution of telegrams and print. ^ 8 . Heads of Department .—On the basis of the findings of these committees/ heads of departments were given an opportunity, at meetings held on 27th and 29th August, to comment on the main heads of the proposals for economy. Many of their suggestions are incorporated in this report. 9- Undersecretaries—This report was studied and approved on 29th beptember at a meeting of the committee of under-secretaries, which was attended by a representative of the Treasury. Summary 10- In the course of this report, I propose to deal separately with (A) telegrams, (B) bag services and (C) the transfer of certain administrative functions to other branches of the Foreign Office. A full summary of our recommendations will be found in the last paragraph of this report. I will say now, however, that, on the basis of present costs, we hope to be able to effect considerable economies, some forthwith, others within a year, and the rest within three years. Owing to lack of statistics and to the fact that post-war conditions are not as yet sufficiently stable to allow of long-term calculations, it is impossible to produce any global figures or percentages of saving in relation to present costs. Wheie reasonable approximation seems possible, estimated figures are given in the paragraphs of this report dealing with the proposed economies. In the field of telegrams we look forward to drastic curtailment as a result of the issue of time-tables and the maintenance of vigilant scrutiny to ensure that speed of trans mission is closely related to urgency. We anticipate great savings by the gradual extension of diplomatic wireless and particularly in the direction of establishing a relay system and, m the long run, by the introduction of machine cyphering. In regard to the bags, subject to special arrangements for certain countries, we recommend the exclusion of non-confidential material from other Government departments, relegation of privileged private correspondence to the cheapest (slowest) form of transport, withdrawal of the privilege from all but the staffs of Foreign Service posts, rejection of tobacco (like wines), reduced circulation of print and stoppage of King’s Messengers’ runs to consulates (partly for security reasons). The question of security at consulates has not been our immediate concern. We are, however, satisfied that none of our recommendations will involve any impairment of our official services. A.—Telegrams Extravagant Use 11 . At the original discussion with Sir Orme Sargent, Sir Edward Bridges said that our telegrams seemed to be too many and too long. In view of the vast increase m the public business, their number must necessarily be greater than in 1939. Our committees have nevertheless endorsed Sir Edward Bridges’s comment. We have also come to the conclusion that priority markings (like security markings) are too high, with the consequent production of rush hours which impose heavy strain on operating staff. And there is too much cypher. Causes 12 . This wasteful state of affairs seems to be due to a general attempt to gear the conduct of coi i espondence too high (so far as communications are concerned) with the consequence that the priority pyramid is well-nigh inverted and has almost ceased to serve its purpose. The telegram has largely usurped the place of the despatch and far too many of the telegrams bear priority markings. Onlv efficiency, we think, could result from a reduction of tempo. Such a reduction together with projected improvements in technique, control and management within the Communications Department, will enable legitimate priority to be met. r 13. There is a tendency for an originator to over-estimate the urgency of his work, particularly at the moment when he is passing it into other hands, andV - . \v sometimes to endeavour to catch up departmental delays by speed of transmission. There is also a tendency to confuse the importance of a subject and the level on which it is handled with the entirely separate question of its urgency. Recent reports from a Foreign Ministers’ conference in Paris were all sent by “Most Immediate ” telegram, although reports by bag would have sufficed. (In this connexion we think it unfortunate and misleading that the third priority marking .*4or telegrams should be “ Important”). In some quarters it is even imagined That high priority markings for telegrams result in their being given a wider distribution. 14?. There is also, as Sir Wilfrid Eady pointed out, in many cases a justi fiable doubt whether anything sent by slower means than that selected will arrive in time. Many telegrams are, therefore, marked “ Most Immediate ” to be on the safe side. Remedies 15. The recommendations to counteract the above causes of extravagance are contained in the following paragraphs. The resultant savings will fall under the headings of :— (a) Reduction of overall load and spreading of existing inequalities of loading (see paragraph 31). {b) Reduction of distribution by re-classification (see paragraph 36). (c) Extension of diplomatic wireless (see paragraph 38). (d) Introduction of telegraphic relay system (see paragraph 40). (e) Machine cyphering (see paragraph 44). (/) Recovery of telegraphic costs from other government departments (see paragraph 45). Revised Categories 16. In the first place we recommend the introduction of revised categories of telegrams as follows “ Most Immediate.” “ Immediate.” “ Important ” (or “ Urgent ”). “ Ordinary.” “ Lettergrams ” (deferred or no government priority telegram). “ Savingrams ” (to travel by bag or post). The introduction of lettergrams, which might take 2 or . 3 days to arrive, should reduce the number of ordinary telegrams and spread the telegraphic load more evenly over the 24 hours. “ Important ” 17. We think that, in order to avoid confusion between importance and urgency, the marking “Important” should be replaced. This point, however, does not concern the Foreign Office alone and we recommend that it be token up with the Cabinet Office. It is possible that the terms which we have applied to the above categories may at some time be modified to bring them into line with generic nomenclature to be adopted by the Service departments as a result of inter-departmental discussion now proceeding. Effect of priority markings on action 18. Priority markings are intended primarily for the guidance of communi cations staffs, but, in cases where action is to be taken on a telegram, these markings are accepted by recipients as indicating the urgency with which'action is required. It should, therefore, be made clear to all originators of telegrams that telegrams are handled as soon as possible after receipt by the person respon sible for action at the destination according to their priority markings and urgency and ahead of non-telegraphic material, and that “Most Immediate” telegrams are dealt with immediately on receipt at any hour of the day or nio-ht, if necessary at the highest level. Only in the rarest cases, therefore, could^the “ most immediate ” marking be justified for a telegram that is to arrive after office hours and which cannot be acted on until the following day. Time-tables for telegrams 19. In the absence of time-tables showing when telegrams of the various categories would arrive, it has been impossible for originators to use priority 34383 B 2 ■ 'mm4 markings correctly and to avoid extravagance. We recommend, therefore, that ^ such tables should be prepared and kept up to date, showing the normal maximum periods of transmission for messages between the Foreign Office and Foreign Service posts, the office hours of communications staffs abroad, and the time differences in relation to G.M.T. Transmission times would run from the moment of handing in a tblegram to the communications staff to the time of delivery by the communications staff at the other end. The tables would say whether post^ 1 ^ are served by diplomatic wireless or by public service communications, it being appreciated that, whereas precise transmission times can be stated for the former, only estimates, with a margin for safety, can be produced for the latter. The periods of transmission by the cable companies could, however, be kept under constant check at both ends. If, through special pressure of work or for any technical cause, diplomatic wireless staffs were falling behind their schedule, the departments concerned would be informed immediately. There would also be advantage in showing the cost of telegrams to the various addresses at the public rate. This would remind originators that telegrams cost money and would be useful in cases where cost is to be recovered from the public. Time-tables for bags, post, &amp;c. 20. We recommend, too, that the existing time-tables for bags and postal services should be expanded, kept up to date, and given a wider distribution. These tables should give the transmission times by ordinary post, air mail, and Foreign Office bag (air and surface) and also by Government Despatch Service (urgent and ordinary) if, as we hope, this service develops satisfactorily. With these tables available, it would, we are satisfied, be possible to divert much of the present telegraphic traffic to the bag. Night load 21. It is evident that, if the time-tables for telegrams are to work smoothly, the number of staff on duty in the Cypher iToom must at all times correspond to the volume of work to be disposed of. At present this is not the case. The highest peak of work occurs at about 8 p.m., when large numbers of telegrams reach Communications Department for despatch. Owing to the reduction of night work, the staff is then at its lowest ebb. It is unfortunate but quite clear, there fore, that the night staff must be increased. There are good reasons why telegrams cannot, in many cases, be prepared for despatch before the end of the day. We recommend, however, that we should continue by exhortation to do our best to induce originators to send off their telegrams in the mornings. In this connexion we understand that—^particularly in the out-housed departments—there is a tendency, because of shortage of boxes, for the transmission of telegrams to the Cypher Room to be delayed. We recommend that envelopes and Lamson tubes should be used more extensively for this purpose and that telegrams should be sent to the Cypher Room as soon as they are initialled. The Treasury Organisation and Methods Division’s report on the Communications Department made a recom mendation in this sense. Relate speed to urgency 22 . Once time-tables for the various means of communication have been distributed, it will be possible for the speed of transmission of a message to be closely related to its urgency. No message or part of a message should be sent by faster means than its subject matter can justify. 23. In the case of telegrams of substantial length, and particularly those of high priority, the load on the Communications Department could be materially lightened if the practice of sending brief messages by the highest priority justified, followed by explanatory communications by slower means, were extended. Much telegraphing and cypher-work could be avoided in this way. And cypher to secrecy 24. Telegrams should similarly be divided into two separate messages in cases where only parts of them are secret. Booklet 25. We recommend that a loose-leaf booklet on telegraphic procedure should be produced, incorporating the above precepts and the time-tables. Special stress must be laid on the need for an originator of a telegram to produce a legible text: otherwise delay and possible error will occur in the communications olfice.5 With a view to assisting the operating staff, consideration, we think, should also be given to the use of special forms for draft telegrams. The booklet should be distributed throughout the Foreign Office, to other government departments using Foreign Office communications, and to Foreign Service posts abroad. The latter should be asked to watch and report results in relation to the time-tables. gaining in Foreign Office 26. There would be advantage, when the proposed reforms are operating, in reverting to the practice of attaching new entrants to the Service to Com munications Department for a short training period. We feel, that, at the beginning of their careers, the booklet of instructions is not otherwise likely to impress itself sufficiently on their minds. It is important, moreover, that, on their transfer abroad, they should be capable of handling cyphers, at any rate in emergency. They should also familiarise themselves with the Bag Rules (see paragraph 48). Other Government Departments 27. Nearly a quarter of the telegraphic material transmitted by the Foreign Office emanates from other government departments. We therefore attach great importance to the distribution of our instructions to those departments and think that there would be advantage in explaining them orally as occasion offered. We think, too, that, as all members of other departments cannot be expected to acquaint themselves with our rules, it would be advantageous if focal points could be established in them through which all telegrams for transmission by the Foreign Office would be routed and where Foreign Office communication rules would be known. The establishment of such focal points was indeed recom mended by Sir Edward Bridges in 1943. Scrutiny 28. On the basis of its present organisation the staff in Communications Department is of insufficient strength to permit of more than part-time scrutiny of telegrams from the point of view of economy or to take up shortcomings effectively with heads of departments, other government departments, or posts abroad. It is for this reason that, although well-conceived circulars have been issued from time to time enjoining economy, they have remained dead letters for lack of enforcement. 29. We therefore recommend that the scrutineers (or examiners), of whom there are only two, should be doubled in number and, further, that they should examine incoming telegrams (after distribution) as well as outgoing telegrams. We estimate that the economies resulting from their labours would do much more than cover their salaries. A recommendation in this sense was included in the report furnished by the Organisation and Methods Division of the Treasury in November of last year. Inspector 30. We also recommend that an inspector should be attached to Communica tions Department for a period of not less than six months to act as liaison officer between the department and the originators of telegrams in matters concerning contraventions of the telegraph rules. We understand that he can be provided from the existing establishment. We hope that, after six months, the rules will be automatically observed and that there will be no further need for his services. The examiners would, of course, continue to have any contraventions referred to originators. Savings 31. We believe that when the remedies described in the above paragraphs crystallise and close scrutiny has been applied, we can look for a very material reduction in telegrams with consequent savings. There are, however, imponder able factors such as the uncertainty of the future requirements of the Service (particularly in relation to conferences), the reactions of the Service as a whole to these remedies, lack of statistics, and several others which, at this stage, render any forecast of savings—either in terms of man-power or money—of no substantial value. The proposal (to which I referred in my Interim Report) to incorporate a Statistical and Control Section within the Communications Department wilhremedy this condition and intelligent forecasts can be anticipated after an initial period. 'Sit6 Possible transfer of scrutiny, distribution, &amp;c., and of Despatch Section 32. It seems to us that the work of scrutinising outgoing telegrams from the point of view of need, length, clarity, cypher, and markings for security and distribution, of addressing questions where necessary on these points to originators and of giving serial numbers to telegrams is not really a logical function of a communications or purely signals department. We take a similar view of the work of scrutinising incoming telegrams (once a clear text has b&lt;^ produced) and of classifying them for distribution, as also of the whole process of making vast quantities of copies of telegrams both incoming and outgoing and distributing them automatically by box to a large number of addressees in the Foreign Office and elsewhere in Whitehall. On the other hand, we think it possible that delay and some duplication of work might result if the editors of incoming telegrams (for clarity of text) did not as at present simultaneously mark telegrams for automatic distribution. Moreover, we think it imprudent to disturb the existing arrangements on these points, however logical it may be to do so, at a moment when many other changes in Communications Department are being introduced. Dislocation might result. 33. We, nevertheless, recommend that the advisability and feasibility of the removal of some or all of these functions from Communications Department should be re-examined in, say, six months’ time and that the possibility of trans ferring at any rate the work of distribution to the Registry, where the distribution of telegrams to some addresses and the distribution of all other papers is already carried out, should then be considered. The suggested return of the Despatch Section from Communications Department to the Registry, where it was, we think, formerly properly placed, is largely bound up with this issue. In any case, the Communications Department should receive credit for performing these extraneous functions so long as they continue to do so. Distribution: Curtailment 34. The automatic outside distribution of telegrams falls under two heads :•— (i) The general purposes distribution, designed to provide a backgTound in the field of foreign affairs; (n) The special distributions to the working levels of other government departments on certain financial, economic and other special subjects with which they are equally or primarily concerned. As to the general purposes distribution, the committee has recommended that the circulation of telegrams to Cabinet Ministers and very senior members of the government service might very well be drastically reduced. There are, however, strong grounds for continuing the special distributions. It is true that working- copies of the telegrams in question must later be sent out from the Foreign Office by printed letter or otherwise. This, however, takes time and the suppression of the automatic distribution would delay the consideration of telegrams. On the other hand, the committee has come to the conclusion that the time has come to abolish certain special series such as “Citizen” and “Quench” and that all distributions should be kept under periodic review. The committee has further recommended that, on man-power and security grounds, copies of telegrams should be distributed to one point only in other government departments and that the number of telegram distribution’boxes in the Foreign Office itself should, if possible be reduced. The committee has also suggested that the Ligm system should be continued for a further trial period and that posts abroad shou d be reminded of the necessity for using it in the case of papers which should be seen by the Secretary of State or under-secretaries If the system proved successful, it would facilitate the automatic distribution of telegrams on the higher levels. &amp; New Classification 35. The distribution committee has further recommended the introduction of a new classification of telegrams for distribution purposes as follows : - Private distributions (Prisec, Priper and Personnel) : to remain Departmental: to comprise the existing Files and Departmental'No 1 has been found m practice that the use of “Files” instP-’r! “ Departmental No. 1 ” has brought no saving.) (It ofDiplomatic: an expanded Departmental No. 2 with some elements of the present Cabinet distribution. Diplomatic Secret: a secret version of the above. Political: to comprise the existing General and Cabinet distributions (for circulation outside as well as within the Foreign Office). ^ffiese changes would result in some slight diminution of distribution and would present a suitable opportunity for curtailing outside circulation. Savings 36. The savings realised by the proposed reduction and re-classification of distribution are not likely to be very high, as they would be represented only by the cost of paper, printing, and a small number of staff. Again, it is impossible to compute these accurately until the eventual load factor is known. Extension of diplomatic wireless 37. There are substantial economies to be made in the technical field. In the first place, great saving would be effected in sterling and foreign exchange by extending the use of diplomatic wireless in the place of the ordinary cable routes. If the load spreads in accordance with the design of the new procedure, it is estimated that diplomatic wireless could carry twice the present traffic without any measurable addition to cost. Even now this works out at less than *2d. a word as against an average cost of by public service communications. The latter figure is composed (probably as to at least 50 per cent.) of foreign currency, whereas the former only involves this to the extent of the cost of living of wireless operators at foreign posts, which is a much lower figure. We recommend, therefore, that diplomatic wireless stations should be established abroad wherever the volume of traffic or other considerations would justify the cost of maintaining them and that the position in this respect should be reviewed from time to time. Savings 38. The total saving which can be realised by the transfer of telegrams from public service communications to diplomatic wireless depends upon the load transferred but it should be noted that the saving realised on every telegram of one hundred words so transferred is the equivalent of just over £1 in sterling or foreign currency. Relay by diplomatic vnreless 39. Plans are already made to set up a diplomatic wireless station in Canada and to route all our messages for North America, which at present go by other means, through it. They would be relayed to the United States by special land lines which are already laid on. The possibility of establishing relay stations for the Far East and South America is also being explored. The latter might be in, say, Brazil or perhaps in British territory, e.g., Jamaica. We recommend that the feasibility should be examined of using'the relay system for other areas in which we could not economically establish wireless 'stations at all posts and that a small research staff should, if necessary, be set aside to go into this. Existing wireless stations should, of course, be used as far as possible. It is evident, for example, that, if a diplomatic wireless station exists at a mission, all telegrams exchanged with consulates in the same country should as a rule be routed through the mission. There would then be only the internal telegraphic costs to defray. Savings 40. We estimate that this relay proposal should effect an economy of at least £ 100,000 a year. Relay by cable 41. We recommend that economy should be effected wherever possible by the application of the relay system to telegrams sent by ordinary means. If, for example, a telegram is addressed to several consulates in the United States, it should be sent to the embassy for dissemination. Similarly, a telegram addressed to several posts in one area could be sent to one of them for onward transmission.8 r r' •• . i Cheapest routes 42. In the above connexion, all Foreign Service posts should ascertain and use the cheapest telegraphic routes. These are by no means always the shortest, more particularly when account is taken of the standing cost of the diplomatic wireless establishment. Machine cyphering, &lt;#c. 43. We endorse the proposal to push on with the plans for the extension of machine cyphering and decyphering and for mechanical transmission and reception by diplomatic wireless, both at home and abroad. We recognise, however, that much technical development on new methods of transmission has yet to be accomplished and that there are difficulties of supply : this must, therefore, be a long-term plan and it will be some 2 or 3 years before the major posts abroad are fully equipped. Savings 44. A saving in the Foreign Office alone of some £35,000 a year in salaries will result. Some immediate economy can be effected by a re-design of the teletype and teleprint rooms, which is already in progress.' These two measures will result in considerable eventual reduction in man-power. Other government departments to pay 45. I have mentioned that nearly a quarter of our outward telegrams apper tain to other government departments. We recommend that these departments should now pay, perhaps on a periodic bulk assessment basis, for the telegrams sent on their behalf by the diplomatic wireless service, just as for those sent for them by the Foreign Office through the cable companies. ’ In any case, allowance must be made for this altruistic traffic in considering the cost of Foreign Office communications. B.—Bag Services 46. With regard to the Foreign Office bag service, we recommend certain measures in order to effect economies. Savings can be realised under the following headings :—- (a) Reduction of load by elimination of non-confidential material from other government departments (see paragraph 51). v (b) Reduction in cost and volume of privileged correspondence and parcels. Curtailment of enjoyment of privilege. Rejection of tobacco as privilege parcel (certain exceptions in the case of classified countries : e.g., Soviet orbit) (see paragraph 57). (c) Reduction in the quantity and circulation of print (see paragraph 65). {d) Reduction of cost of King’s Messengers’ journeys by restriction of secret documents and cyphers held by consulates and by any other practical means (see paragraph 70). We have found room for saving on all these points, but more particularly in regard to load. Classification 47. As a first requisite for the proper use of bags, we think that some of our recommendations in regard to telegrams should be applied to bags also. In the first place, we recommend that the classification of bags for security ( confidential or crossed and 11 non-confidential ’ ’ or &lt;£ uncrossed ”) and for priority purposes should be made clear in all quarters concerned and that the proper use of the markings should be enforced. Much waste can occur through the carriage of non-urgent and non-confidential material by confidential air bag. Marking “ By Bag ” alone is not enough but, where the higher markings are used, they must be justified. For reasons of safety, however, communications or articles of special value should continue to qualify for the crossed bag. Time-tables and Bag Rules 48. As stated in paragraphs 19, 20 and 25 we recommend that time-tables should be prepared for the various means of transmission, including bags, and distributed throughout the Foreign Office, to other government departments’ and9 / 1 to Foreign Service posts abroad, together with a booklet of instructions on telegraphic procedure. We recommend that revised rules for the use of the bag should be incorporated. Bag points in other departments ^ 49. As in the case of telegrams (see paragraph 27) we also recommend that steps should be taken to establish focal points in other government departments through which all material for inclusion in Foreign Office bags should be sent. Otherwise our rules are unlikely to be observed. Reduction of load. Ron-confidential material from other departments 50. This brings me to our first attack on load. Outward diplomatic bags at present carry a heavy load of material emanating from other government departments that requires no protection on security grounds from the authorities of the countries through which the bags pass. As no diplomatic immunity is needed for this material, the Foreign Office are under no obligation to carry it and we think that it should go by other means. The Central Office of Informa tion have already set up machinery to shoulder their own obligations. We under stand that a reminder in this sense was circulated to government departments last year by the Joint Security Panel of the Cabinet Office and we recommend that this injunction should now be enforced and that the Foreign Office should inform all government departments accordingly. Savings 51. The savings which will result from off-loading the carriage of non- confidential material carried on behalf of other government departments is difficult to calculate accurately. It is, however, estimated with reasonable accuracy that the carriage of outgoing material under this heading is costing approximately £25,000 per annum. There will also be considerable savings in man-power as a result of a diminishing load on the Bag Rooms. Government Despatch Service 52. We understand that the Cabinet Office also drew attention to the Urgent Government Mail Service as a possible alternative to the diplomatic bag or the ordinary post for the carriage of material below the top security gradings. As mentioned in paragraph 6 , we have enquired into the prospects of development for this service (under the new name of Government Despatch Service (urgent or ordinary) ). The service has no internationally recognised diplomatic immunity but experience goes to show that its bags would be far less likely to be tampered with or delayed in foreign hands than packages sent by the ordinary post. Proposals for developing the service are under examination and it is too early to say to what extent other government departments would use it in lieu of the post or whether it would be feasible or advantageous to divert certain Foreign Office material (official or private privileged mail) from the non-confidential bag to it. Privileged mail. To go by cheapest means 53. Whether or not private privileged mail could be handed over to the Government Despatch Service, there is considerable saving to be made in the handling of this material. It is a long-standing privilege of members of the Foreign Service abroad that their private correspondence and parcels should be carried between the Foreign Office and their posts by bag. Air bags however are a recent and expensive development and we recommend that except for the correspondence of Heads of Missions, which frequently assumes official impor tance, they should no longer be used for private purposes and that the ordinarv private privileged mail should travel by the cheapest means. If it turned out that the cost by non-urgent Government Despatch Service was lower than by slow ban and that safety of transmission was not sacrificed, this service should 'we think be used, although not at the cost of the sender, who would still be responsible only for postage to or from the Foreign Office. If faster transmission were desired, the public air mail service would normally be open to the sender In any case, we think that, whereas the Foreign Office should continue to take the strictest care of private mail entrusted to it, the bag rules should make it eW 34383 ' t uear v.r wthat the privileged mail service is provided as an act of grace and that the Foreign Office and His Majesty’s Government can accept no responsibility for the loss or damage of packages sent by it. Privilege confined to Foreign Service staffs 54. We find that the use of the bag for private purposes is no longer confined to members of Foreign Service posts and that officials of all kinds avail themselvo. of it. We recommend that in future the privilege shall be open only to the staffs of Foreign Service posts and permanent delegations abroad but not include those members of the staff recruited locally who have no close ties with this country. Heads of Missions should be asked to furnish and maintain up-to-date lists for use in the Foreign Office of those entitled to the privilege and to ensure that private material is not accepted from anybody else for transmission at the public expense. We think it undesirable to discriminate between the ranks of members of staffs at Foreign Service posts and thus exclude the lower grades from privilege. On the other hand private parcels should not be sent abroad by diplomatic bag except to persons enjoying customs immunity locally and Heads of Missions should furnish lists of those for whom parcels may be accepted here for transmission. Tobacco 55. For practical reasons liquids cannot be carried by Foreign Office bag and, when imported by members of Foreign Service posts, are sent out of bond to them direct through commercial channels or are addressed in bulk to Heads of Missions for distribution, against payment, to members of the staff entitled to customs immunity. This system, we understand, usually works well and we recommend that it be applied to tobacco and cigarettes. The carriage of these supplies by diplomatic bag involves heavy loads and cost and we think it justi fiable to curtail the existing bag privilege by excluding them in future. This would bring great public saving without, we think, imposing any considerable burden on the individual. Classified countries 56. We recognise that conditions in certain classified countries, mostly within the Soviet orbit, are exceptional in varying respects and that the rules proposed in the last three paragraphs cannot automatically be applied. As to personal correspondence, we think, indeed, that it should be an obligation on all United Kingdom officials in countries within the Soviet orbit to forward letters only by confidential diplomatic bag, using, however, slow bags where this would be suitable. We think, nevertheless, that tobacco, like wines and spirits, should if possible be forwarded through commercial channels as proposed and that the Government Despatch Service should be used for parcels if a reliable and economical service can be established. We think, in short, that the needs should be met in the cheapest possible way and that this should be made the subject of enquiry. We realise that life for our officials in these countries would be pre carious if not insupportable if the supply of parcels broke down and that the use of diplomatic bags must continue if no satisfactory alternative can be found. Savings 57. Analysis based upon available statistics reveals that the present cost of carrying privileged letters, parcels and tobacco is not less than £ 75,000 per annum. The proposals we make will result in a 60 per cent, reduction of the numbers of persons entitled to enjoy the privilege. No clear calculation can as yet be made as to what reduction in carriage costs can be effected, or to what extent the continuance of the privilege to classified countries will affect the eventual total saving. We believe, however, that the saving will be large and will also have effect on man-power employed in the Bag Booms. Newspapers, &amp;c. 58. We think that there are strong grounds for off-loading a considerable weight of newspapers and periodicals officially supplied. A large number of these are ordered by the Library for our missions and consulates, at the cost of the Stationery Office, and forwarded by the first available air bag. Greater quantities are sent out direct for Information purposes by the Central Office of Information, who, in view of their more frequent transmissions, manage tooutstrip those sent in the Foreign Office bag. For some of their material they use the Urgent Government Mail scheme (Government Despatch Service), and we understand that the Stationery Office have considered whether this service might not with advantage, in some instances, handle the material at present carried by bag. 59. A meeting was held in the Foreign Office on 1 st September with representatives of the Stationery Office, Central Office of Information, and British Council, to consider whether delay and possible duplication of supply might not be avoided if the Central Office assumed responsibility for the transmission of all this official material. They were not unwilling but proposed that, now that normal postal services had been largely restored, they should instead arrange, on behalf of the Stationery Office, for it to be despatched direct by air mail from the publishers, except for destinations for which the posts were unreliable. In this way still greater speed would be achieved at, it was thought, no real extra cost to the exchequer. This proposal is now under examination and we recommend that it should be supported. As things stand, much of the newspaper material forwarded at considerable cost by bag is largely out of date on arrival. Print 60. Heavy loads of confidential print and print volumes are at present distributed by bag to all missions and a number of consulates. We believe that there is room for considerable saving here, and largely in foreign exchange. 61. In more leisurely and prosperous days, when news from public sources was scantier and belated, the lavish distribution of print was of great value. Now, however, we believe that not only can we not afford it but it largely fails of its purpose. The print arrives in great quantity and, partly owing to pressure in the printing department, some months after the event. A busy man can scarcely be expected to read it, knowing as he does that it can have no direct bearing on his work and can be of only academic interest. We believe, indeed, that it is largely left unread and that, if it were drastically reduced in quantity and certain alternative measures taken, its objects would be better and more cheaply met. Reduced circulation abroad 62. We recommend, therefore, that— (a) Papers that merit printing for historical reasons or for purposes of reference, as distinct from those of current interest, should be printed ££ for volume” and that copies of them should not be sent to any Foreign Service posts except the post of origin; (b) Annual reports should, nevertheless, continue to be distributed to all posts; (c) Reports on personalities and heads of missions or extracts from them, should be supplied on request; (d) The volumes themselves should be sent only to the posts directly concerned or, on departmental instruction, to other posts in the same orbit (not necessarily all covered by the same political department); (e) In special cases, volumes should be issued on request; (/) In order to make recommendation (d) more effective we should break down the present composite volumes and revert to the system under which volumes are confined as far as possible to one country or subject; (y) Papers other than those printed for historical or reference purposes should be printed and given general distribution only if, in their full text, they are likely to be of real importance or interest to virtually all missions; and (k) That papers of more limited interest should be copied selectively, either direct from the post of origin or on receipt. These measures would virtually dispose of the burden of distributing volumes, whidh by reason of great weight and bulk constitute by far the most expensive item of documentary distribution, and would, we think, reduce the weight of other print by about a half. Reduced circulation in London 63. We believe that considerable reduction could be made in the distribution of print within the Foreign Office itself and suggest that this be examined. As regards the distribution of print to other interested departments in London, we 34383 d12 i / m recommend that this should be reduced pari passu with the circulation of Foreign Office telegrams (see paragraph 34), due account being taken of the special needs of the Commonwealth High Commissioners. Intels.' 64. We also recommend that, in order to keep the Foreign Service abreast of world developments, in so far as they are not adequately reported in the preS 1 , an expanded form of intelligence telegram should be sent out weekly or as occasion required. These telegrams could, we think, normally go by bag.' Even so, they would arrive long before the print, besides being cheaper to produce and carry and easier to read. The Foreign Office Weekly Political Intelligence Summary, on the other hand, could, we think, be abolished, since an enquiry made of a cross section of the present recipients in London shows that it is rarely, if ever, read by them. We dare say that the position is much the same abroad. Savings 65. Savings to be effected on print will depend almost entirely upon the reduced freight loan. The annual overall cost at present freight rates is estimated to be £35,000. Our proposal should reduce this figure by at least 50 per cent. There will be a proportionate reduction in the cost of paper. Print for consuls 66 . As to the circulation of print to consuls, for the security reasons mentioned in the next paragraph this must virtually cease altogether. In any case, we recommend that the distribution should be stopped. We are informed that not infrequently confidential consular bags accompanied by King’s Messengers contain nothing but print. We clearly cannot afford this luxury. Security 67. Consular reports. —We understand that, owing to the high cost of providing reliable British guards from this country, it is proposed that, whereas nearly all diplomatic missions shall continue to be strongholds of security, only the minimum amount of security shall be maintained at consulates save in excep tional circumstances. Thus, most consulates will not be able to hold either print or other secret papers. In order, however, that consuls should not be prevented from furnishing secret reports in cypher, posts from which such reports might be regarded as essential could be provided with one-time pads enabling them to communicate with their mission and the Foreign Office. The loss of'one of these pads would not compromise the communications of other posts. A reserve of such pads could also be held at missions for despatch to consulates in emergency. 68 . King’s Messengers’ destinations. —If no consulates except a few in the security grades are equipped to hold secret paper, they will, of course, no longer receive crossed bags. This will enable us to curtail the 'runs of King’s Messengers to consulates in the United States and elsewhere and to effect some reduction in their numbers and travelling costs. 69. Safe hand, sea hags and cost. —We think, too, that every opportunity should be taken to reduce the numbers of King’s Messengers in other ways and, where complete security can be assured, to extend the practice of entrusting crossed bags to captains of British vessels or aircraft or to other safe hand when conditions permit. At the moment, captains of aircraft do not always offer satisfactory security service. We think that this point should be pursued and that an attempt should at the same time be made to secure a reduction in what we regard as the unwarrantably high cost of sending bags by this method. As to the carriage of bags by masters of ships, we think that much greater use should be made of this method, the cost of which is negligible, and that we should revert as far as may be practicable to the pre-war practice of sending bags by sea. We recommend that air bags should in future be used only for material that is too urgent to be sent by the surface route and could not be handled by telegraph or, if it could, would cost more than if sent by air. We appreciate that the resumption of the use of surface bags on an extended scale would call for enquiry into shipping facilities, which are not what they were before the war, and into arrangements for the reception of bags at ports of destination and, if necessary, for their onward transmission. The selection of the telegraph or air bag for the transmission of urgent communications (not of such priority as to make the use of the telegraph essential) would have to be based on careful costing. Among13 the factors to be taken into account, which would vary largely from post to post, would be, on the one hand, the cost of cyphering, transmission by diplomatic wireless or cable and decyphering and, on the other hand, the cost of transmission by air, with or without a King’s Messenger as the case might be (and, if with one, with an allowance for his pay). It seems probable that, if only a few items were involved, the telegraph, at any rate by diplomatic wireless, would be cheaper nd that, when the Diplomatic Wireless Service has been extended and machine cyphering and decyphering introduced, air bags might virtually fall out of use. The question, however, is one of some complexity and we recommend that it should be made the subject of research. It would be for the Statistical and Costings Section of the department to elucidate matters of this kind. It is, however, at any rate clear that air bags should not be continued as a matter of course and that no material should be sent off by more costly means than considera tions of urgency or security require. 70. Savings .—-The journeys of King’s Messengers and the cost of unaccom panied confidential air bags are among the largest headings of expenditure on communications. It will be some time before we can estimate the extent to which reductions can be effected on the basis of the preceding paragraphs. We antici pate, however, that important savings would be made. C.—Possible Transfer of Functions 71. Other economies in money and man-power might result if the Com munications Department were relieved of certain duties not really a part of communications work. In paragraphs 32 and 33 I have referred to the possible transfer of — 1 (i) the distribution, &amp;c., of telegrams; and (ii) the Despatch Section; and have recommended that this should be re-examined in about six months. Travel Section 72. There is also the Travel Section of Communications Department, which does not concern itself with the journeys of King’s Messengers. We recommend that this Section should be transferred to the Conference Department and we understand that arrangements for this are already being made. This Section clearly belongs to the administrative branch of the Foreign Office. Security Work 73. We further recommend that the Security Department should take over all work relating to security, except such as concerns communications and technical services. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS 74.

There were many good reasons for a vast increase of expenditure, such as the mounting volume of public business under war and post-war conditions, rising costs, the bequeathal to the Foreign Office of the functions of the Ministry of Information (a heavy user of communications) and the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and the assumption by Communications Department of additional functions, some of them due to new security needs. In considering the charge for Foreign Office communications, it had also to be taken into account that much of the load carried by them (nearly a quarter of the telegrams and a heavier share of the bag load) appertained to other government departments. Moreover, many of the functions discharged by Communications Department were of an administrative and departmental order and not attributable to a purely signals organisation. 3. It was, however, agreed that I should be called upon to prepare a report showing what could be done to reduce the charge and at the same time increase the efficiency of the services provided. Interim Report 4. I submitted an interim report in June based on preliminary investigations and Sir Orme Sargent sent a summary of it to Sir Edward Bridges on 19th June. The interim report included in some detail suggestions for the internal reorganisa tion of the Communications Department itself as well as suggestions for the general improvement of the economical working of the communications of the Foreign Service. This report was at the same time referred to a committee of under-secretaries, who endorsed the main suggestions in principle and decided that the various proposals made in it, together with any others that might emerge, should be examined in detail by special committees to be set up for the purpose of examining their application to the overall requirements of the Service. I have therefore prepared my final report on the basis of the deliberations of these committees. Committees of Enquiry 5. Telegrams and bags .—I established two separate committees to consider telegrams and bag services. These committees each held five meetings, which were attended by representatives not only of Communications Department but of other departments of the Office. Representatives of the under-secretaries were also good enough to attend 6 . Government Despatch Service. —A small committee was formed to enquire into the possible development of the Urgent Government Mail Service (under the new name of Government Despatch Service) as an alternative to the Foreign Office bag service for the carriage of non-confidential material for government departments. We held a meeting with representatives of the General Post Office, 14367 34383 ■ ■I . i &gt;4 m A B2 the Central Office of Information and the British Council and attended two meetings at the Cabinet Offices. At the first of these, we met representatives of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The second was attended by representatives of all government departments and of the aircraft companies. 7. Distribution .—Another committee, under Mr. Halford, considered the distribution of telegrams and print. 8 . Heads of Department .—On the basis of the findings of these committees, heads of departments were given an opportunity, at meetings held on 27th and 29th August, to comment on the main heads of the proposals for economy. Many of their suggestions are incorporated in this report. 9. Undersecretaries .—This report was studied and approved oh 29th September at a meeting of the committee of under-secretaries, which was attended by a representative of the Treasury. Summary 10. In the course of this report, I propose to deal separately with (A) telegrams, (B) bag services and (C) the transfer of certain administrative functions to other branches of the Foreign Office. A full summary of our recommendations will be found in the last paragraph of this report. I will say now, however, that, on the basis of present costs, we hope to be able to effect considerable economies, some forthwith, others within a year, and the rest within three years. Owing to lack of statistics and to the fact that post-war conditions are not as yet sufficiently stable to allow of long-term calculations, it is impossible to produce any global figures or percentages of saving in relation to present costs. Where reasonable approximation seems possible, estimated figures are given in the paragraphs of this report dealing with the proposed economies. In the field of telegrams we look forward to drastic curtailment as a result of the issue of time-tables and the maintenance of vigilant scrutiny to ensure that speed of trans mission is closely related to urgency. We anticipate great savings by the gradual extension of diplomatic wireless and particularly in the direction of establishing a relay system and, m the long run, by the introduction of machine cyphering. In regard to the bags, subject to special arrangements for certain countries, we recommend the exclusion of non-confidential material from other Government departments, relegation of privileged private correspondence to the cheapest (slowest) form of transport, withdrawal of the privilege from all but the staffs of Foreign Service posts, rejection of tobacco (like wines), reduced circulation of print and stoppage of King’s Messengers’ runs to consulates (partly for security reasons). The question of security at consulates has not been our immediate concern. We are, however, satisfied that none of our recommendations will involve any impairment of our official services. A.—Telegrams Extravagant Use 11 . At the original discussion with Sir Orme Sargent, Sir Edward Bridges said that our telegrams seemed to be too many and too long. In view of the vast increase in the public business, their number must necessarily be greater than in 1939. Our committees have nevertheless endorsed Sir Edward Bridges’s comment. We have also come to the conclusion that priority markings (like security markings) are too high, with the consequent production of rush hours, which impose heavy strain on operating staff. And there is too much cypher. Causes 12. This wasteful state of affairs seems to be due to a general attempt to gear the conduct of correspondence too high (so far as communications are concerned) with the consequence that the priority pyramid is well-nigh inverted and has almost ceased to serve its purpose. The telegram has largely usurped the place of the despatch and far too many of the telegrams bear priority markings. Only efficiency, we think, could result from a reduction of tempo. Such a reduction, together with projected improvements in technique, control and management within the Communications Department, will enable legitimate priority to be met. 13. There is a tendency for an originator to over-estimate the urgency of his work, particularly at the moment when he is passing it into other hands, andsometimes to endeavour to catch up departmental delays by speed of transmission. There is also a tendency to confuse the importance of a subject and the level on which it is handled with the entirely separate question of its urgency. Recent reports from a Foreign Ministers’ conference in Paris were all sent by k ‘Most Immediate” telegram, although reports by bag would have sufficed. (In this connexion we think it unfortunate and misleading that the third priority marking ^or telegrams should be ‘'Important”). In some quarters it is even imagined that high priority markings for telegrams result in their being given a wider distribution. 14'. There is also, as Sir Wilfrid Eady pointed out, in many cases a justi fiable doubt whether anything sent by slower means than that selected will arrive in time. Many telegrams are, therefore, marked “ Most Immediate ” to be on the safe side. Remedies 15. The recommendations to counteract the above causes of extravagance are contained in the following paragraphs. The resultant savings will fall under the headings of :— (a) Reduction of overall load and spreading of existing inequalities of loading (see paragraph 31). (b) Reduction of distribution by re-classification (see paragraph 36). (c) Extension of diplomatic wireless (see paragraph 38). (d) Introduction of telegraphic relay system (see paragraph 40). \e) Machine cyphering (see paragraph 44). (/) Recovery of telegraphic costs from other government departments (see paragraph 45). Revised Categories 16. In the first place we recommend the introduction of revised categories of telegrams as follows “ Most Immediate.” “ Immediate.” “ Important ” (or “ Urgent ”). ■ , “ Ordinary.” “ Lettergrams ” (deferred or no government priority telegram). “ Savingrams ” (to travel by bag or post). The introduction of lettergrams, which might take 2 or 3 days to arrive, should reduce the number of ordinary telegrams and spread the telegraphic load more evenly over the 24 hours. ‘ ‘ Important ’ ’ 17. We think that, in order to avoid confusion between importance and urgency, the marking “Important” should be replaced. This point, however, does not concern the Foreign Office alone and we recommend that it be token up with the Cabinet Office. It is possible that the terms which we have applied to the above categories may at some time be modified to bring them into line with generic nomenclature to be adopted by the Service departments as a result of inter-departmental discussion now proceeding. Effect of priority markings on action 18. Priority markings are intended primarily for the guidance of communi cations staffs, but, in cases where action is to be taken on a telegram, these markings are accepted by recipients as indicating the urgency with which’action is required. It should, therefore, be made clear to all originators of telegrams that telegrams are handled as soon as possible after receipt by the person respon- • sible for action at the destination according to their priority markings and urgency and ahead of non-telegraphic material, and that “Most Immediate” telegrams are dealt with immediately on receipt at any hour of the day or night, if necessary at the highest level. Only in the rarest’cases, therefore, could the “ most immediate ” marking be justified for a telegram that is to arrive after office hours and which cannot be acted on until the following day. Time-tables for telegrams 19. In the absence of time-tables showing when telegrams of the various categories would arrive, it has been impossible for originators to use priority 34383 t&gt; o4 markings correctly and to avoid extravagance. We recommend, therefore, that such tables should be prepared and kept up to date, showing the normal maximum periods of transmission for messages between the Foreign Office and Foreign Service posfs, the office hours of communications staffs abroad, and the time differences in relation to G.M.T. Transmission times would run from the moment of handing in a telegram to the communications staff to the time of delivery by the communications staff at the other end. The tables would say whether postlP' are served by diplomatic wireless or by public service communications, it being- appreciated that, whereas precise transmission times can be stated for the former, only estimates, with a margin for safety, can be produced for the latter. The periods of transmission by the cable companies could, however, be kept under constant check at both ends. If, through special pressure of work or for any technical cause, diplomatic wireless staffs were falling behind their schedule, the departments concerned would be informed immediately. There would also be advantage in showing the cost of telegrams to the various addresses at the public rate. This would remind originators that telegrams cost money and would be useful in cases where cost is to be recovered from the public. Time-tables for bags, fost, &amp;c. 20. We recommend, too, that the existing time-tables for bags and postal services should be expanded, kept up to date, and given a wider distribution. These tables should give the transmission times by ordinary post, air mail, and Foreign Office bag (air and surface) and also by Government Despatch Service (urgent and ordinary) if, as we hope, this service develops satisfactorily. With these tables available, it would, we are satisfied, be possible to divert much of the present telegraphic traffic to the bag. Night load 21. It is evident that, if the time-tables for telegrams are to work smoothly, the number of staff on duty in the Cypher Room must at all times correspond to the volume of work to be disposed of. At present this is not the case. The highest peak of work occurs at about 8 p.m., when large numbers of telegrams reach Communications Department for despatch. Owing to the reduction of night work, the staff is then at its lowest ebb. It is unfortunate but quite clear, there fore, that the night staff must be increased. There are good reasons why telegrams cannot, in many cases, be prepared for despatch before the end of the day. We recommend, however, that we should continue by exhortation to do our best to induce originators to send off their telegrams in the mornings. In this connexion we understand that—particularly in the out-housed departments^—there is a tendency, because of shortage of boxes, for the transmission of telegrams to the Cypher Room to be delayed. We recommend that envelopes and Lamson tubes should be used more extensively for this purpose and that telegrams should be sent to the Cypher Room as soon as they are initialled. The Treasury Organisation and Methods Division’s report on the Communications Department made a recom mendation in this sense. Relate speed to urgency 22. Once time-tables for the various means of communication have been distributed, it will be possible for the speed of transmission of a message to be closely related to its urgency. No message or part of a message should be sent by faster means than its subject matter can justify. 23. In the case of telegrams of substantial length, and particularly those of high priority, the load on the Communications Department could be materially lightened if the practice of sending brief messages by the highest priority justified, followed by explanatory communications by slower means, were extended. Much telegraphing and cypher-work could be avoided in this way. And cypher to secrecy 24. Telegrams should similarly be divided into two separate messages in cases where only parts of them are secret. Booklet 25. We recommend that a loose-leaf booklet on telegraphic procedure should be produced, incorporating the above precepts and the time-tables. Special stress must be laid on the need for an originator of a telegram to produce a legible text: otherwise delay and possible error will occur in the communications office.I—Mi -s With a view to assisting the operating staff, consideration, we think, should also be given to the use of special forms for draft telegrams. The booklet should be distributed throughout the Foreign Office, to other government departments using Foreign Office communications, and to Foreign Service posts abroad. The latter should be asked to watch and report results in relation to the time-tables. ^raining in Foreign Office 26. There would be advantage, when the proposed reforms are operating, in reverting to the practice of attaching new entrants to the Service to Com munications Department for a short training period. We feel, that, at the beginning of their careers, the booklet of instructions is not otherwise likely to impress itself sufficiently on their minds. It is important, moreover, that, on their transfer abroad, they should be capable of handling cyphers, at any rate in emergency. They should also familiarise themselves with the Bag Rules (see paragraph 48). Other Government Departments 27. Nearly a quarter of the telegraphic material transmitted by the Foreign Office emanates from other government departments. We therefore attach great importance to the distribution of our instructions to those departments and think that there would be advantage in explaining them orally as occasion offered. We think, too, that, as all members of other departments cannot be expected to acquaint themselves with our rules, it would be advantageous if focal points could be established in them through which all telegrams for transmission by the Foreign Office would be routed and where Foreign Office communication rules would be known. The establishment of such focal points was indeed recom mended by Sir Edward Bridges in 1943. Scrutiny 28. On the basis of its present organisation the staff in Communications Department is of insufficient strength to permit of more than part-time scrutiny * of telegrams from the point of view of economy or to take up shortcomings effectively with heads of departments, other government departments, or posts abroad. It is for this reason that, although well-conceived circulars have been issued from time to time enjoining economy, they have remained dead letters for lack of enforcement. 29. We therefore recommend that the scrutineers (or examiners), of whom there are only two, should be doubled in number and, further, that they should examine incoming telegrams (after distribution) as well as outgoing telegrams. We estimate that the economies resulting from their labours would do much more than cover their salaries. A recommendation in this sense was included in the report furnished by the Organisation and Methods Division of the Treasury in November of last year. Inspector 30. We also recommend that an inspector should be attached to Communica tions Department for a period of not less than six months to act as liaison officer between the department and the originators of telegrams in matters concerning contraventions of the telegraph rules. We understand that he can be provided from the existing establishment. We hope that, after six months, the rules will be automatically observed and that there will be no further need for his services. The examiners would, of course, continue to have any contraventions referred to originators. ■ Savings 31. We believe that when the remedies described in the above paragraphs crystallise and close scrutiny has been applied, we can look for a very material reduction in telegrams with consequent savings. There are, however, imponder able factors such as the uncertainty of the future requirements of the Service (particularly in relation to conferences), the reactions of the Service as a whole to these remedies, lack of statistics, and several others which, at this stage, render any forecast of savings—either in terms of man-power or money—of no substantial value. The proposal (to which I referred in my Interim Report) to incorporate a Statistical and Control Section within the Communications Department wilhremedy this condition and intelligent forecasts can be anticipated after an initial period. u ■ JPossible transfer of scrutiny, distribution, &amp;c., and of Despatch Section 32. It seems to us that the work of scrutinising outgoing telegrams from the point of view of need, length, clarity, cypher, and markings for security and distribution, of addressing questions where necessary on these points to originators and of giving serial numbers to telegrams is not really a logical function of a communications or purely signals department. We take a simikrr view of the work of scrutinising incoming telegrams (once a clear text has be!^ produced) and of classifying them for distribution, as also of the whole process of making vast quantities of copies of telegrams both incoming and outgoing and distributing them automatically by box to a large number of addressees in the Foreign Office and elsewhere in Whitehall. On the other hand, we think it possible that delay and some duplication of work might result if the editors of incoming telegrams (for clarity of text) did not as at present simultaneously mark telegrams for automatic distribution. Moreover, we think it imprudent to disturb the existing arrangements on these points, however logical it may be to do so, at a moment when many other changes in Communications Department are being introduced. Dislocation might result. 33. We, nevertheless, recommend that the advisability and feasibility of the removal of some or all of these functions from Communications Department should be re-examined in, say, six months’ time and that the possibility of trans ferring at any rate the work of distribution to the Registry, where the distribution of telegrams to some addresses and the distribution of all other papers is already carried out, should then be considered. The suggested return of the Despatch Section from Communications Department to the Registry, where it was, we think, formerly properly placed, is largely bound up with this issue. In any case, the Communications Department should receive credit for performing these extraneous functions so long as they continue to do so. Distribution: Curtailment 34. The automatic outside distribution of telegrams falls under two heads:— (i) The general purposes distribution, designed to provide a background in the field of foreign affairs; (ii) The special distributions to the working levels of other government departments on certain financial, economic and other special subjects with which they are equally or primarily concerned. As to the general purposes distribution, the committee has recommended that the circulation of telegrams to Cabinet Ministers and very senior members of the government service might very well be drastically reduced. There are, however, strong grounds for continuing the special distributions. It is true that working copies of the telegrams in question must later be sent out from the Foreign Office by printed letter or otherwise. This, however, takes time and the suppression of the automatic distribution would delay the consideration of telegrams. On the other hand, the committee has come to the conclusion that the time has come to abolish certain special series such as “Citizen” and “Quench” and that all distributions should be kept under periodic review. The committee has further recommended that, on man-power and security grounds, copies of telegrams should be distributed to one point only in other government departments and that the number of telegram distribution boxes in the Foreign Office itself should, if possible, be reduced. The committee has also suggested that the “Light ” system should be continued for a further trial period and that posts abroad should be reminded of the necessity for using it in the case of papers which should be seen by the Secretary of State or under-secretaries. If the system proved successful, it would facilitate the automatic distribution of telegrams on the higher levels. New Classification 35. The distribution committee has further recommended the introduction of a new classification of telegrams for distribution purposes as follows ■ - Private distributions (Prisec, Priper and Personnel) : to remain. Departmental: to comprise the existing Files and Departmental No. 1 . (It has been found in practice that the use of “Files” instead of “ Departmental No. 1 ” has brought no saving.)7 Diplomatic: an expanded Departmental No. 2 with some elements of the present Cabinet distribution. Diplomatic Secret: a secret version of the above. Political: to comprise the existing General and Cabinet distributions (for circulation outside as well as within the Foreign Office). ' c, *hese changes would result in some slight diminution of distribution and would present a suitable opportunity for curtailing outside circulation. Savings 36. The savings realised by the proposed reduction and re-classification of distribution are not likely to be very high, as they would be represented only by the cost of paper, printing, and a small number of staff. Again, it is impossible to compute these accurately until the eventual load factor is known. Extension of diplomatic wireless 37. There are substantial economies to be made in the technical field. In the first place, great saving would be effected in sterling and foreign exchange by extending the use of diplomatic wireless in the place of the ordinary cable routes. If the load spreads in accordance with the design of the new procedure, it is estimated that diplomatic wireless could carry twice the present traffic without any measurable addition to cost. Even now this works out at less than 2d. a word as against an average cost of 4^. by public service communications. The latter figure is composed (probably as to at least 50 per cent.) of foreign currency, whereas the former only involves this to the extent of the cost of living of wireless operators at foreign posts, which is a much lower figure. We recommend, therefore, that diplomatic wireless stations should be established abroad wherever the volume of traffic or other considerations would justify the cost of maintaining them and that the position in this respect should be reviewed from time to time. Savings 38. The total saving which can be realised by the transfer of telegrams from public service communications to diplomatic wireless depends upon the load transferred but it should be noted that the saving realised on every telegram of one hundred words so transferred is the equivalent of just over £1 in sterling or foreign currency. Relay by diplomatic vnreless 39. Plans are already made to set up a diplomatic wireless station in Canada and to route all our messages for North America, which at present go by other means, through it. They would be relayed to the United States by special land lines which are already laid on. The possibility of establishing relay stations for the Far East and South America is also being explored. The latter might be in, say, Brazil or perhaps in British territory, e.g., Jamaica. We recommend that the feasibility should be examined of using the relay system for other areas in which we could not economically establish wireless stations at all posts and that a small research staff should, if necessary, be set aside to go into this. Existing wireless stations should, of course, be used as far as possible. It is evident, for example, that, if a diplomatic wireless station exists at a mission, all telegrams exchanged with consulates in the same country should as a rule be routed through the mission. There would then be only the internal! telegraphic costs to defray. Savings 40. We estimate that this relay proposal should effect an economv of at least £ 100,000 a year. Relay by cable 41. We recommend that economy should be effected wherever possible by the application of the relay system to telegrams sent by ordinary means. If, for example, a telegram is addressed to several consulates in the United States, it should be sent to the embassy for dissemination. Similarly, a telegram addressed to several posts in one area could be sent to one of them for onward transmission.Cheapest routes 42. In the above connexion, all Foreign Service posts should ascertain and use the cheapest telegraphic routes. These are by no means always the shortest, more particularly when account is taken of the standing cost of the diplomatic wireless establishment. Machine cyphering, &amp;c. 43. We endorse the proposal to push on with the plans for the extension of machine cyphering and decyphering and for mechanical transmission and reception by diplomatic wireless, both at home and abroad. We recognise,, however, that much technical development on new methods of transmission has yet to be accomplished and that there are difficulties of supply: this must, therefore, be a long-term plan and it will be some 2 or 3 years before the major posts abroad are fully equipped. Savings 44. A saving in the Foreign Office alone of some £35,000 a year in salaries will result. Some immediate economy can be effected by a re-design of the teletype and teleprint rooms, which is already in progress. These two measures will result in considerable eventual reduction in man-power. Other government departments to pay 45. I have mentioned that nearly a quarter of our outward telegrams apper tain to other government departments. We recommend that these departments should now pay, perhaps on a periodic bulk assessment basis, for the telegrams sent on their behalf by the diplomatic wireless service, just as for those sent for them by the Foreign Office through the cable companies. In any case, allowance must be made for this altruistic traffic in considering the cost of Foreign Office communications. B.—Bag Services 46. With regard to the Foreign Office bag service, we recommend certain measures in order to effect economies. Savings can be realised under the following headings :— (a) Reduction of load by elimination of non-confidential material from other government departments (see paragraph 51). (b) Reduction in cost and volume of privileged correspondence and parcels. Curtailment of enjoyment of privilege. Rejection of tobacco as privilege parcel (certain exceptions in the case of classified countries : e.^., Soviet orbit) (see paragraph 57). {c) Reduction in the quantity and circulation of print (see paragraph 65). (d) Reduction of cost of King’s Messengers’ journeys by restriction of secret documents and cyphers held by consulates and by any other practical means (see paragraph 70). We have found room for saving on all these points, but more particularly in regard to load. Classification 47. As a first requisite for the proper use of bags, we think that some of our recommendations in regard to telegrams should be applied to bags also. In the first place, we recommend that the classification of bags for security ( confidential or crossed and c 1 non-confidential ’ or 4 £ uncrossed ”) and for priority purposes should be made clear in all quarters concerned and that the proper use of the markings should be enforced. Much waste can occur through the carriage of non-urgent and non-confidential material by confidential air bag. Marking £t By Bag ” alone is not enough but, where the higher markings are used, they must be justified. For reasons of safety, however, communications or articles of special value should continue to qualify for the crossed bag. Time-tables and Bag Rules 48. As stated in paragraphs 19, 20 and 25 we recommend that time-tables should be prepared for the various means of transmission, including ba°- s , and distributed throughout the Foreign Office, to other government departments’ andtrtai to Foreign Service posts abroad, together with a booklet of instructions on telegraphic procedure. We recommend that revised rules for the use of the bag should be incorporated. Bag points in other departments ^ 49. As in the case of telegrams (see paragraph 27) we also recommend that steps should be taken to establish focal points in other government departments through which all material for inclusion in Foreign Office bags should be sente Otherwise our rules are unlikely to be observed. • Reduction of load. N on-confidential material from other - departments 50. This brings me to our first attack on load. Outward diplomatic bags at present carry a heavy load of material emanating from other government departments that requires no protection on security grounds from the authorities of the countries through which the- bags pass. As no diplomatic immunity is needed for this material, the Foreign Office are under no obligation to carry it and we think that it should go by other means. The Central Office of Informa tion have already set up machinery to shoulder their own obligations. We under stand that a reminder in this sense was circulated to government departments last year by the Joint Security Panel of the Cabinet Office and we recommend that this injunction should now be enforced and that the Foreign Office should inform all government departments accordingly. Savings 51. The savings which will result from off-loading the carriage of non- confidential material carried on behalf of other government departments is difficult to calculate accurately. It is, however, estimated with reasonable accuracy that the carriage of outgoing material under this heading is costing approximately £25,000 per annum. There will also be considerable savings in man-power as a result of a diminishing load on the Bag Rooms. Government Despatch Service 52. We understand that the Cabinet Office also drew attention to the Urgent Government Mail Service as a possible alternative to the diplomatic bag or the ordinary post for the carriage of material below the top security gradings. As mentioned in paragraph 6 , we have enquired into the prospects of development for this service (under the new name of Government Despatch Service (urgent or ordinary)). The service has no internationally recognised diplomatic immunity but experience goes to show that its bags would be far less likely to be tampered with or delayed in foreign hands than packages sent by the ordinary post. Proposals for developing the service are under examination and it is too early to say to what extent other government departments would use it in lieu of the post or whether it would be feasible or advantageous to divert certain Foreign Office material (official or private privileged mail) from the non-confidential bag to it. Privileged mail. To go by cheapest means 53. Whether or not private privileged mail could be handed over to the Government Despatch Service, there is considerable saving to be made in the handling of this material. It is a long-standing privilege of members of the Foreign Service abroad that their private correspondence and parcels should be carried between the Foreign Office and their posts by bag. Air bags, however are a recent and expensive development and we recommend that, except for the correspondence of Heads of Missions, which frequently assumes official impor tance, they should no longer be used for private purposes and that the ordinary private privileged mail should travel by the cheapest means. If it turned out that the cost by non-urgent Government Despatch Service was lower than by slow bao- and that safety of transmission was not sacrificed, this service should 'we think be used, although not at the cost of the sender, who would still be responsible only for postage to or from the Foreign Office. If faster transmission were desired, the public air mail service would normally be open to the sender In any case, we think that, whereas the Foreign Office should continue to take the strictest care of private mail entrusted to it, the bag rules should make it clear 34383 g* I A vr 1 ? C10 that the privileged mail service is provided as an act of grace and that the Foreign Office and His Majesty’s Government can accept no responsibility for the loss or damage of packages sent by it. Privilege confined to Foreign Service staffs 54. We find that the use of the bag for private purposes is no longer confinf^L to members of Foreign Service posts and that officials of all kinds avail themselv^ of it. We recommend that in future the privilege shall be open only to the staffs of Foreign Service posts and permanent delegations abroad but not include those members of the staff recruited locally who have no close ties with this country. Heads of Missions should be asked to furnish and maintain up-to-date lists for use in the Foreign Office of those entitled to the privilege and to ensure that private material is not accepted from anybody else for transmission at the public expense. We think it undesirable to discriminate between the ranks of members of staffs at Foreign Service posts and thus exclude the lower grades from privilege. On the other hand private parcels should not be sent abroad by diplomatic bag except to persons enjoying customs immunity locally and Heads of Missions should furnish lists of those for whom parcels may be accepted here for transmission. Tobacco 55. For practical reasons liquids cannot be carried by Foreign Office bag and, when imported by members of Foreign Service posts, are sent out of bond to them direct through commercial channels or are addressed in bulk to Heads of Missions for distribution, against payment, to members of the staff entitled to customs immunity. This system, we understand, usually works well and we recommend that it be applied to tobacco and cigarettes. The carriage of these supplies by diplomatic bag involves heavy loads and cost and we think it justi fiable to curtail the existing bag privilege by excluding them in future. This would bring great public saving without, we think, imposing any considerable burden on the individual. Classified countries 56. We recognise that conditions in certain classified countries, mostly within the Soviet orbit, are exceptional in varying respects and that the rules proposed in the last three paragraphs cannot automatically be applied. As to personal correspondence, we think/indeed, that it should be an obligation on all United Kingdom officials in countries within the Soviet orbit to forward letters only by confidential diplomatic bag, using, however, slow bags where this would be suitable. We think, nevertheless, that tobacco, like wines and spirits, should if possible be forwarded through commercial channels as proposed and that the Government Despatch Service should be used for parcels if a reliable and economical service can be established. We think, in short, that the needs should be met in the cheapest possible way and that this should be made the subject of enquiry. We realise that life for our officials in these countries would be pre carious if not insupportable if the supply of parcels broke down and that the use of diplomatic bags must continue if no satisfactory alternative can be found. Savings 57. Analysis based upon available statistics reveals that the present cost of carrying privileged letters, parcels and tobacco is not less than £ 75,000 per annum. The proposals we make will result in a 60 per cent, reduction of the numbers of persons entitled to enjoy the privilege. No clear calculation can as yet be made as to what reduction in carriage costs can be effected, or to what extent the continuance of the privilege to classified countries will affect the eventual total saving. We believe, however, that the saving will be laro'e and will also have effect on man-power employed in the Bag Rooms. Newspapers, &amp;c. 58. We think that there are strong grounds for off-loading a considerable weight of newspapers and periodicals officially supplied. A large number of these are ordered by the Library for our missions and consulates, at the cost of the Stationery Office, and forwarded by the first available air bag. Greater quantities are sent out direct for Information purposes by the Central Office of Information, who, in view of their more frequent transmissions, manage to11 w§ r' ! *** j r outstrip those sent in the Foreign Office bag. For some of their material they use the Urgent Government Mail scheme (Government Despatch Service), and we understand that the Stationery Office have considered whether this service might not with advantage, in some instances, handle the material at present carried by bag. 59. A meeting was held in the Foreign Office on 1 st September with representatives of the Stationery Office, Central Office of Information, and British Council, to consider whether delay and possible duplication of supply might not be avoided if the Central Office assumed responsibility for the transmission of all this official material. They were not unwilling but proposed that, now that normal postal services had been largely restored, they should instead arrange, on behalf of the Stationery Office, for it to be despatched direct by air mail from the publishers, except for destinations for which the posts were unreliable. In this way still greater speed would be achieved at, it was thought, no real extra cost to the exchequer. This proposal is now under examination and we recommend that it should be supported. As things stand, much of the newspaper material forwarded at considerable cost by bag is largely out of date on arrival. Print 60. Heavy loads of confidential print and print volumes are at present distributed by bag to all missions and a number of consulates. We believe that there is room for considerable saving here, and largely in foreign exchange. 61. In more leisurely and prosperous days, when news from public sources was scantier and belated, the lavish distribution of print was of great value. Now, however, we believe that not only can we not afford it but it largely fails of its purpose. The print arrives in great quantity and, partly owing to pressure in the printing department, some months after the event. A busy man can scarcely be expected to read it, knowing as he does that it can have no direct bearing on his work and can be of only academic interest. We believe, indeed, that it is largely left unread and that, if it were drastically reduced in quantity and certain alternative measures taken, its objects would be better and more cheaply met. Reduced circulation abroad 62. We recommend, therefore, that— {a) Papers that merit printing for historical reasons or for purposes of reference, as distinct from those of current interest, should be printed “ for volume’’ and that copies of them should not be sent to any Foreign Service posts except the post of origin; (b) Annual reports should, nevertheless, continue to be distributed to all posts; (c) Reports on personalities and heads of missions or extracts from them, should be supplied on request; (d) The volumes themselves should be sent only to the posts directly concerned or, on departmental instruction, to other posts in the same orbit (not necessarily all covered by the same political department); (e) In special cases, volumes should be issued on request; (/) In order to make recommendation (d) more effective we should break down the present composite volumes and revert to the system under which volumes are confined as far as possible to one country or subject; (g) Papers other than those printed for historical or reference purposes should be printed and given general distribution only if, in their full text, they are likely to be of real importance or interest to virtually all missions; and {h) That papers of more limited interest should be copied selectively, either direct from the post of origin or on receipt. These measures would virtually dispose of the burden of distributing volumes, which by reason of great weight and bulk constitute by far the most expensive item of documentary distribution, and would, we think, reduce the weight of other print by about a half. Reduced circulation in London 63. We believe that considerable reduction could be made in the distribution of print within the Foreign Office itself and suggest that this be examined. As regards the distribution of print to other interested departments in London, we 34383 drecommend that this should be reduced pari passu with the circulation of Foreign Office telegrams (see paragraph 34), due account being taken of the special needs of the Commonwealth High Commissioners. cc Intels.” 64. We also recommend that, in order to keep the Foreign Service abre^t of world developments, in so far as they are not adequately reported in the prelb, an expanded form of intelligence telegram should be sent out weekly or as occasion required. These telegrams could, we think, normally go by bag.' Even so, they would arrive long before the print, besides being cheaper to produce and carry and easier to read. The Foreign Office Weekly Political Intelligence Summary, on the other hand, could, we think, be abolished, since an enquiry^made of a cross section of the present recipients in London shows that it is rarelv, if ever, read by them. We dare say that the position is much the same abroad. Savings - ‘ 65. Savings to be effected on print will depend almost entirely upon the reduced freight loan. The annual overall cost at present freight rates is estimated to be £35,000. Our proposal should reduce this figure by at least 50 per cent. There will be a proportionate reduction in the cost of paper. Print for consuls 66 . As to the circulation of print to consuls, for the security reasons mentioned in the next paragraph this must virtually cease altogether. In any case, we recommend that the distribution should be stopped. We are informed that not infrequently confidential consular bags accompanied by King’s Messengers contain nothing but print. We clearly cannot afford this luxury. Security 67. Consular reports.—We understand that, owing to the high cost of providing reliable British guards from this country, it is proposed that, whereas nearly all diplomatic missions shall continue to be strongholds of security, only the minimum amount of security shall be maintained at consulates save in excep tional circumstances. Thus, most consulates will not be able to hold either print or other secret papers. In order, however, that consuls should not be prevented from furnishing secret reports in cypher, posts from which such reports might be regarded as essential could be provided with one-time pads enabling them to communicate with their mission and the Foreign Office. The loss of one of these pads would not compromise the communications of other posts. A reserve of such pads could also be held at missions for despatch to consulates in emergency. 68 . King's Messengers' destinations .—If no consulates except a few in the security grades are equipped to hold secret paper, they will, of course, no longer receive crossed bags. This will enable us to curtail the 'runs of King’s Messengers to consulates in the United States and elsewhere and to effect some reduction in their numbers and travelling costs. 69. Safe hand, sea hags and cost. MT think, too, that every opportunity should be taken to reduce the numbers of King’s Messengers in other ways and, where complete security can be assured, to extend the practice of entrusting crossed bags to captains of British vessels or aircraft or to other safe hand when conditions permit. At the moment, captains of aircraft do not always offer satisfactory security service. We think that this point should be pursued and that an attempt should at the same time be made to secure a reduction in what we regard as the unwarrantably high cost of sending bags by this method. As to the carriage of bags by masters of ships, we think that much greater use should be made of this method, the cost of which is negligible, and that we should revert as far as may be practicable to the pre-war practice of sending bags by sea. We recommend that air bags should in future be used only for material that is too urgent to be sent by the surface route and could not be handled by telegraph or, if it could, would cost more than if sent by air. We appreciate that the resumption of the use of surface bags on an extended scale would call for enquiry into shipping facilities, which are not what they were before the war, and into arrangements for the reception of bags at ports of destination and, if necessary, for their onward transmission. The selection of the telegraph or air bag for the transmission of urgent communications (not of such priority as to make the use of the telegraph essential) would have to be based on careful costing. Among13 the factors to be taken into account, which would vary largely from post to post, would be, on the one hand, the cost of cyphering, transmission by diplomatic wireless or cable and decyphering and, on the other hand, the cost of transmission by air, with or without a King’s Messenger as the case might be (and, if with one, with an allowance for his pay). It seems probable that, if only a few items ^ere involved, the telegraph, at any rate by diplomatic wireless, would be cheaper md that, when the Diplomatic Wireless Service has been extended and machine cyphering and decyphering introduced, air bags might virtually fall out of use. The question, however, is one of some complexity and we recommend that it should be made the subject of research. It would be for the Statistical and Costings Section of the department to elucidate matters of this kind. It is, however, at any rate clear that air bags should not be continued as a matter of course and that no material should be sent off by more costly means than considera tions of urgency or security require. 70. Savings.—The journeys of King’s Messengers and the cost of unaccom panied confidential air bags are among the largest headings of expenditure on communications. It Will be some time before we can estimate the extent to which reductions can be effected on the basis of the preceding paragraphs. We antici pate, however, that important savings would be made. C.—Possible Transfer of Functions 71. Other economies in money and man-power might result if the Com munications Department were relieved of certain duties not really a part of communications work. In paragraphs 32 and 33 I have referred to' the possible transfer of—• (i) the distribution, &amp;c., of telegrams; and (ii) the Despatch Section; and have recommended that this should be re-examined in about six months. Travel Section 72. There is also the Travel Section of Communications Department, which does not concern itself with the journeys of King’s Messengers. We recommend that this Section should be transferred to the Conference Department and we understand that arrangements for this are already being made. This Section clearly belongs to the administrative branch of the Foreign Office. Security Work 73. We further recommend that the Security Department should take over all work relating to security, except such as concerns communications and technical services. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS 74.

Foreign Office, 15th April, 1946. Sir, It has now been decided that official motor vehicles will be supplied at the public expense for salaried Consular Posts where the local transport is inadequate for the proper performance of official duties and where there is sufficient official work to justify the provision of official transport. This arrangement applies only to the present time. The question of replacement at some future date must be deferred for later consideration in the light of general policy. 2. I transmit herewith a memorandum (The Official Car Code) which has been prepared for the purpose of defining the responsibilities of Heads of Consular Posts in regard to motor vehicles supplied by His Majesty’s Government and of ensuring that as far as possible uniform practice may be followed in their use and maintenance. 3. The fixed rate to be charged for representative and private use is at present 6d. per mile per vehicle. This charge is subject to revision. 4. In the course of revising the personal allowances of certain officers account has been taken of expenditure in connexion with their privately owned cars. In such cases these allowances will be subject to the appropriate reduction as from the time of delivery of an official car. 5. The first of the reports called for in paragraph 11 should be rendered forthwith, and officers at posts where official cars are held should apply immediately to the Establishment and Organisation Department of the Foreign Office for supplies of the forms mentioned in paragraph 14. 6. Extra copies of this circular and memorandum are enclosed for transmission to Foreign Service officers under your superintendence. JL CViXJ. , Sir, Your obedient Servant, I am ERNEST BEVIN. His Majesty’s Superintendir Consular Officers. 13172a 31389—1a ■/[ XA 5/0/1 J Foreign Office, April 1946. THE OFFICIAL CAR CODE. ►_iNOE it is desirable to define the responsibilities of Heads of Posts in the use and care of official motor vehicles, to guide them in their proper maintenance, and to avoid controversy over the respective responsibilities of an outgoing Head of the Post and his successor, the following rules have been made: — RESPONSIBILITY. 1. The responsibility for the proper use, care and maintenance of official vehicles will rest entirely with the Head of the Post, whether the vehicles be driven by himself or by an official chauffeur or temporarily by any member of his staff. It is emphasised that especial care must be taken of official vehicles,, because they are supplied at the public expense and are not the personal property of the Head of the Post or his staff. It is his responsibility to ensure that the vehicles are properly serviced, that the log-book supplied for use with each vehicle is regularly kept and that all instructions concerning repair and running costs, accounts and insurance are carried out. The official motor vehicles are entirely at the disposal of the Head of the Post, who may at his discretion authorise their use by subordinate members of his staff if and when he sees fit. During absences from his post or on his transfer to another post, the outgoing Head of the Post will ensure that the vehicles are handed over to his substitute or his successor with their complete equipment and full comple ment of spare wheels and tyres, tools and spare parts, and the fact reported in a separate paragraph, noting any exceptions, in his handing-over report. USE. 2. The^ use of official vehicles may be differentiated under three headings: official, representative and private. 3. The term ‘official use” includes: official visits by the Head of the Post and members of the staff to public bodies, British subjects, foreign colleagues and so on; the meeting of distinguished arrivals, attendance at official receptions (luncheons, dinners, cocktail parties, funerals, &amp;c.); and collection of Foreign Office bags and mail from King’s Messengers and landing grounds. The cost of such use is to be charged to public funds. 13172b [31389—2]m mmm smmhm •*'- ■■, w- \ t. ■Journeys for normal attendance at the office can only be regarded as ' official ” when special sanction has been granted by the Department. The present practice is to require the staff to make a payment for such journeys. The cost of journeys made on behalf of Dominion or Colonial Governments should .,be charged to the Dominion or Colony concerned and credited to this Department. 4. The vehicles may also be used for representative or private purposes, in which case the cost is to be paid to the official funds at the post by each person concerned at the approved fixed rate per mile per vehicle and shown as a credit on the “ Transp^^-” schedule with the quarterly accounts. Representative use o^The vehicle includes visits of a less than official nature, which nevertheless must be paid in order to maintain touch with people and affairs. This of course includes attendance at parties and places which are not strictly official. 5. Private use ” of the vehicle is a self-explanatory term and may chiefly be applied to the use of the vehicle for recreational purposes. MAINTENANCE. 6. The proper driving and maintenance of official vehicles are responsibilities of the Head of the Post, who must ensure that the vehicle is not driven at an excessive speed (taking into considera tion the local standard of roads and of driving) and that the economical cruising speed of the vehicle is not needlessly exceeded. W hen a chauffeur is necessary the Head of the Post must satisfv himself that the chauffeur’s standard of driving and maintenance is adequate. 7. The Head of the Post must also ensure that the vehicles are serviced at regular intervals (according to the instructions in the handbook of each vehicle) and that an accurate record of maintenance, repairs and replacements is kept. A log-book for each vehicle is to be kept in the front pocket, and petrol and oil consumption and mileages at the time of replenishment are to be entered in it, as well as the records of trips. Where not supplied with the vehicle, an inventory of equipment, tools and spares, should be prepared and revised as necessary from time to time, and care should be taken that these articles are not lost. Both the log-book and the inventory should be checked every month, preferably on a specific date such as the first day of each month, and deficiencies accounted for and made good, if necessary privately. All proper vehicle expenses not arising out of negligence or fault are chargeable to public funds. 8. In particularly hot climates care is to be taken to ensure that the cooling system is working efficiently, and especial attention should be paid to correct tyre pressures (as given in the handbook). Where roads are rough, care should also be taken to remove stones or flints which may have become embedded in fc* 4 8 the covers before they have cut through to the inner tube, and road springs should be periodically inspected for signs of breakage. In climates where great extremes of cold are experienced attention should be paid to the necessity for Anti-freeze ” in the water system. It is to be emphasised that from the points of view both of smartness and upkeep the tasks of washing and polishing are important, as also are those of oiling and greasing in the interests of continued efficiency. Where the official vehicles of a post include trucks or lorries, over-loading should be avoided and ' xa^Vi distribution of load (with the bulk of the weight well forward between the axles) observed. 9. Each official vehicle should be overhauled every six months and a report furnished to the Head of the Post. For this, as for all maintenance and repairs, the local agents of the makers or their advised local garage (if there is one) should be used, or else the best local garage. The expenses of overhauls and reports are chargeable to public funds. 10. _ At large posts it is probable that the Head of the Post will wish to delegate the supervision of maintenance, &amp;c., of official vehicles to a competent member of his staff, but he will at all times remain himself responsible. SIX-MONTHLY REPORT. 11. In order that a proper check may be kept in London on the state of official vehicles abroad, and with a view, as far as possible, to avoiding eventual disputes both as to the necessity of replacing old vehicles and as to the condition of vehicles at times of handing-over, a six-monthly report is to be furnished to the Establishment Officer of the Foreign Office. Such reports, drawn up by a competent firm of motor-engineers as indicated above, if one is available, should cover: (a) The state of the- engine and chassis. (b) The state of the coachwork. (c) The condition of the tyres. (d) Petrol consumption per mile. (e) Oil consumption per mile. (/) The mileage run from time of delivery and during the pasi six months, and must be submitted on the 1st October and the 1st April of each year, countersigned by the Head of the Post. The reports should, where possible, state the causes of any defects which may come to light as the result of examination; and distinguish between those due to fair wear and tear and those arising from other causes such as original defects, abnormal road and climatic conditions, careless supervision or driving, &amp;c.K 1 • ■ t V \ V 4 ACCOUNTS. 12. Accounts for the running costs and maintenance and repair costs of each official vehicle will be submitted with the quarterly accounts in a separate “ Transport ” schedule. In such schedules are to be included separately the costs of running expenses,^ spares, repairs, replacements, overhauls, reports, chauffeur’s wages and uniforms, insurance (where necessary), &amp;c. 1 ayments in respect of private use and use on behalf of Dominion or Colonial Governments, as laid down in paragraphs 3 anJfcfc-—•' should be entered as an item on the Dr. side of the quarterly iJ * account, supported by a schedule showing in detail the composition and amount of each individual payment. INSURANCE. 13. Official vehicles will not be insured, unless the law of the country in which they are in use so demands, in which case the Ioreign Office must first be consulted, - since His Majesty’s Government do not as a rule insure their own property and since they accept in consequence all the risks involved, which in the case of official use of official vehicles are borne in the public interest and in the case of their private and representational use are covered by the mileage ^ate. DOCUMENTS. 14. Specimen copies of the proposed log-book, six-monthlv report form and monthly maintenance check-list accompanv this Code which should be kept readily available at each post.
