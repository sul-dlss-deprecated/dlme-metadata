In light of a large number of telegrams on this subject, Shuckburgh wishes to clarify the matter with a statement. The note deals with Ibn Saud's relations with King Husain [Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī], King of the Hijaz, and Ibn Rashīd, British representation with Ibn Saud, and the question of the supply of arms and munitions to Ibn Sa‘ūd, as well as some general observations. There is also an appendix (folio 91v) that includes details of communications made to Ibn Saud and his reply.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Secretary to the Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Emir of Jabal Shammar Saʿūd bin ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz Āl Rashīd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002b2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
