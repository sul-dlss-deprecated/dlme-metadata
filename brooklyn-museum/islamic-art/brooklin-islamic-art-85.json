Although each piece in the series is quite different, they are all arranged as similar sized decorative mirror frames.  Within each frame a different vignette of city life in Damascus is reflected through the protruding ensemble of various small repurposed items made to look like the architectural details of the city.This piece, numbered 7 in the series, shows a building fa\u00e7ade with two doors, one placed inside an historical arch. A Toyota truck representing those used by the Syrian secret service is parked outside.  A surveillance camera protruding from the building draws attention to the life of fear and stress lived daily by the civilians on the eve of the Syrian civil war.  The piece also includes an audio recording captured by the artist during his last visit to the city in 2011. In the audio, the call of prayer from the Great Umayyad Mosque as well as children playing in the streets and people including the artist talking in Arabic in a caf\u00e9 can be heard. Overall it is a contemplative piece reflecting the physical, historical, and political complexities of Syria.", "medium": "Mixed media, plaster, pigment, found objects, audio recording", "dimensions": "34 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 8 in.
