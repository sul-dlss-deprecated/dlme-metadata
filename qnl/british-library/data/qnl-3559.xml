SIMLA: GOVERNMENT CENTRAL BRANCH PRESS 1916. S2049ADTRANSFER OF CONTROL OF THE OPERATIONS IN MESOPOTAMIA FROM THE INDIA OFFICE TO THE WAR OFFICE. In a private* telegram to His Excellency the Viceroy, dated the 3rd Feb- (Hb ^Exceiie'nry ruary iqi 6, the Secretary of State for India intimated that the War Committee the viceroy's appro- had had under their consideration the question of the control of operations in be! Mesopotamia and that they proposed to approve of the following arrangements ing treated as oS- subject to any remarks the Government of India might have to offer: (1) The Commander-in-Chief in India to receive instructions with regard to military operations in Mesopotamia and Persia from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff under the authority of the Secretary of State for War in exactly the same manner as the Commander- in-Chief in other theatres ; these instructions being based on the decisions of the War Committee. (2) India to remain, as at present, the main base of the force in Meso potamia which will continue to be administered by the Commander- in-Chief such requirements of the force as India cannot meet being supplied by the War Office from or her parts of the Empire subject to the general policy at the time being decided upon by the War Committee. (3) All reports of operations, states, returns, recommendations as to higher appointments and requests for additional units to be sent by the General Ofucer Commanding in Mesopotamia to the Com mander-in-Chief in India and repeated to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. (4) Demands for drafts to mainta : n Indian units in Mesopotamia and for such war mateiial as is being provided from India to continue to be made on the Commander-in-Chitf in India. (5) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Commander-in-Chief in India to correspond direct in regard to requirements of force in Mesopotamia but all questions of principle or policy likely to affect the military or internal security of India to continue to be referred by the Commander-in-Chief in India to the Viceroy. (6) Copies of all telegrams exchanged with India to be supplied by the General Staff to the Secretary of State lor Indh. (7) Arrangenments in regard to prisoners of war, our sick and wounded and finances of campaign to remain as at present, (8) AH press communiques to be issued through the War Office after communication with the India Office and telegraphed to the Com mander-in-Chief in India. (9) Intelligence obtained in India which might affect operations to be telegraphed to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and repeated . to the General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia. (10) The foregoing provisions to make no change in the control of the troops in India as at present exercised. The Secretary of State added that he, personally, welcomed these pro posals, being convinced that they would lead to more efficient co-operation and better support from home. Neither he nor the Government of India had any reserves of troops at their disposal, while in the matter of military supplies he was practically dependent on the War Office. The proposals would, more over, have the advantage of uniting responsibility and power, which at present were divided, in the Imperial General Staff subject to Cabinet control. In a communicationf to H. E. the Viceroy dated the 8th February 1916, ^ Sefial No a R E. the Commander-in-Chief in India expressed the opinion that the proposals S2049AP2 i » Serial No. 3. t Serial f o. 4. J Seiial No. !• § Serial No. 5* )|Serial No- 6. were fundamentally sound and that it need not be anticipated that the contrO to be exercised by the War Office would be extended to minor matters He pointed out that the major control of the campaign was even then exercised in London and that it wou d be well worth while to surrender the control that we did exercise, even it it proved more real than nominal, for the adyantages such surrender would ensure. He concurred in the view of the Secretary of State tha^ the result would be more efficient co-peration and better support from home and stated that this was already evidenced in the arrangements for the despatcti ot the nth Division from Egypt. There were a few points which wo uld i remarked, require further elucidation and possibly amendment, such as the authority to make higher appointments, the effect on the politick control exercised by the Viceroy in Persia and the Persian Gulf, the retention y the Government ot India of the right to alter or suppress War Office communi ques and the preservation of the status quo in the matter of the interchange ot intelligence likely to affect operations. His Excellency also drew attention to the fact that the new procedure might lead to some weakening of the financial control of the Government of India as the orders received from home, and which would be binding on him, might involve expenditure. This danger was not, however, a serious one, as in the main the class of expenditure referred to would, under existing agreements, tall on the Treasury and not on India. In a private telegram* dated the 9th February, H. E. the Viceroy assured the Secretary of State of the whole-hearted support of the Government cf India but at'the same time called attention to the points brought to notice by H. E. the Commander-in-Chief in India. In his telegraphic replyt of the 10th February the Secretary of State intimated that, m order to meet the various points raised he had agreed with the Chief ot the Imperial General Staff to (a) Omit recommendations as to higher appointments in section 3 _ of the procedure communicated in his telegram; of the 3rd February, and to insert a new section numbered 3 (a) after (3) as follows : ' The General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia will make recommenda tions for higher appointments to the Commander-in-Chief in India and will repeat them to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. The appointments will be made by tne Commander-in-Chief in India subject to the approval of His Majesty s Government. , The higher appointments referred to are those down to Divisional Com- manders inclusive and also Senior General Staff Officer. The object of this clause was to secure that^ the Chief of the ^penal General Staff should be consulted in regard to higher appointments and tha Government would intervene only in case of a difference arising between him and the Commander-in-Chief in India. ^ (b) Insert in section 5 after the words ^ security of India ' the words ' or the political situation in Persia or the Gulf. ■ The rieht to alter or suppress War Office communiques was conceded, and ,h. reciprocity of the arrangement for the communication of intelligence admitted. The Secretary of State at the same time ordered that the new arrangements should be brought into force at once. The orders of the Secretary of State were given effect to in Army Depart ment letter to the Chief of the General Staff, No. dated thel6th February iql6 a copy of which was communicated to all Departments of t e bebruary 1910, a copy Branc hes of Army Headquarters, the Financial AdvtseTMilitary Finance, the Military Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy, fbt Direcwr -General, Indian Medical Service, the Directoi-General, Posts and TpWranhs the Director Royal Indian Marine, the Military Accountant J e ' ea ' • tbe Central War Controller, and the Deputy Field Accountant General Force ' D,' and in a telegramU dated the 23rd idem, the Secretary ot State was inform ed accordingly. Subsequent discussions arose as to the exact meaning of clauses 4 and 5 of the revised procedure and its effect on the position ot the- Secreta y, y 'ifP* 1© 3 Department vis h vis the Heads of Branches, and the control exercised by the Financial Adviser over war expenditure. The meaning of these clauses was made clearer in an explanatory letter No. H .-1703,* dated the 6th March 1916, * Serial No- 7. • which was communicated to Branches of Army Headquarters, but His Excel lency the Commander-in-Chief in India did not consider that any action was called for in regard to the position of the Army Secretary and the Financial Adviser as the transfer of control to the War Office did not necessitate any change in the procedure in force. A further telegramf from the Secretary of State regarding the control of t Serial No, 8. operations in Mesopotamia was received on the 21st July 1916. The officers to assist His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, referred to in this telegram, have been despatched to Mesopotamia, and the changes in organisation alluded to are being carried ouU1 Telegram P., dated 3rd (received 4th) February 1916.

Staff by their direction on control of oper ations in Mesopotamia. Note states that it is long-established custom for Government of India to control military operations based on that country. This arrangement had undoubted advantages on account of superior knowledge of local conditions, and because operations did not require employment of General Imperial resources. In present war, however, whole resources of Empire are en S a 8 e ^j an ^ operations of war, except Mesopotamia, are now under control of Imperial General Staff subject to decisions of War Committee. And further reinforcements required for Mesopotamia must come from home or other theatres of war and events in Mesopotamia, over which War Office has up to now had no control, thus reacting upon operations elsewhere. Note continues—' it is in accordance with sound military principles that the authority which controls the reserve should also control the operations which those reserves may be required to support. It is also in accordance with these principles that the base of operations should be under the same general control as the forces in the field. It does not, therefore, seem advisable that the War Office should attempt to conduct directly the opeiations in Mesopotamia so long as India remains the main base for the campaign in that country, and consequently I have recom mended that these operations should be controlled by War Office through the Commander-in-Chief in India. Chief of the General Staff therefore proposed alternative system which, as amended by War Committee on my suggestion, now reads as follows (1) The Commander-in-Chief in India to receive instructions with regard to military operations in Mesopotamia and Persia from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff under the authority of Secretary of State for War in exactly the same manner as the Commanders-in-Chief in other theatres. These instructions will, ot course, be based on the decisions of the War Committee. (2) India will remain, as at [present, the main base of force in Mesopo tamia which will continue to be administered by Commander-in-Chief, such requirements of force as India cannot meet being supplied by the War Office from other parts of the Empire subject to the general policy at the time being decided upon by the War Committee. S (3) The General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia will send all reports 0 operations, states, returns, recommendations as to higher appointments and requests for additional units to the Commander-in-Chief in India and will repeat these to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

It is the Secretary of State folk India who makes the real surrender of power and responsibility. He welcomes the new system, and so 1 think may we.. Mr. Chamberlain is entirely right in saying that the result will be more efficient co-operation and better support from home. There are, of course, a few points on which we must guard ourselves. We want to kno^, for instance, which authority is to make the higher appointments referred to in (3). Again, as regards (8), we must retain the right to alttr or even suppress War Office communiques whenever necessary. It is seldom that a communique as worded and issued in London is suitable for the press in India. As regards (9), it is no doubt intended that the communication of intelligence between India and the War Office shall be reciprocal as it is at present. I think we may assure the Secretary of State that we will whole-heartedly accept the new arrangement and carry it out with all good-will and in no grudg ing spirit. 1 have also considered what effect the change will have on Your Excellency 's position. In purely military affairs, 1 think, there will be none. i here will, however, be a certain danger th?t your political control in Mesopotamia, in Persia and in the Gulf may be weakened, and 1 would suggest that, in your reply, Your Excellency should ask for assurances on this point, for though I can very well carry on military operations under the general direction of the Chief of the ImperiafGeneral Staff, the Viceroy cannot well receive political instructions through that channel. I do not say that any attempt in this direction would be made—indeed 1 do not think it would be—but nevertheless I think a clear understanding on the point essential. Clause (5) telegram is not quite sufficient, since, if read literally, it covers only internal India. I also feel bound to bring to Your Excellency's notice that the new procedure may possibly lead to some weakening of the financial control of the Government of India, since the orders I shall receive from home and which will be binding on me may involve expenditure- I do not see how this can be provided against, but the danger is not a serious one, since in the main the class of expenditure to which I refer, would, under existing agreements, fall on the Treasury and not on India, and the^e agreements are under (7) of the telegram to remain unchanged. 3 Telegram P , No. I82, dated 9th Feb. uary I9I6.

There are one or two points which require elucidation and possibly amend- me t. For instance, it is not clear which authority is to make the higher appoint ments referred to in section 3. Section 5 applies only to India, but I think it is very desirable that, apart from Mesopotamia, the political control of the Viceroy in Persia and the Gulf should not be weakened.4 With regard to section 8, *,ve mast retain the right to alter or even suppress War Office communiques when necessary. It is seldom that a communique, as issued in London, is suitable for the press in India. It is presumed that the action defined in section 9 will be reciprocal as at present.
