I am to inform you that these units were not installed in the premises at Khorramshahr and Abadan respectively as hitherto believed, but both units are now' being installed in the premises occupied by His Majesty’s Consulate at Khorramshahr, which are rented from the Anglo—Iranian Oil Company as from the 14th August, 1947. The cost of installation etc. is being borne by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 3 . In view of the transfer of power, and the fact that these units are only now being installed, any question of division of costs would presumably only arise in connexion with the general question of joint representation after the 15 th August, 1947 and I am, therefore, to request that this Department may be informed as to what extent the Government of India are now interested in the disposal of this equipment. 4 .

The Government of India have, I think, been rather generous over this. Instead of including the cost in diplomatic and consular expenditure as the Foreign Office suggest they propose that the cost of installation should be treated as capital expenditure, i.e. paid for by the Government manning the post (the Government of India in the case of the Consulate and H.M.G. in the case of the Abadan Shipping Office) and the cost of maintenance divided in accordance with the usual procedure. The memorandum to which the Government of India refer is flagged on the A.G. file attached.

As regards the expenditure involved, such expenditure incurred atposts maintained by the Government of India m the Persian Gulf is chargeable to the budget head 50-Qivil forks (Central) and its division between the Indian and imperial revenues is soverned by the arrangement described in this Department letter No.U-910-A/38, dated the 7th May 1958.

Prior seems to^have been given s somewhat exaggerated report of the extent to which air condition ing has been introduced in Delhi, for apart from the Tecretariat blowers (which as you know work by blowing air over water and are coasec^ently quite useless in Humidity) all'we have is a limited number of. Desert Coolers which work enough in dry ;heGt but'tire net worth turning on when it is damp, and'an even more limited number of real air conditioners for particularly high officials.

The intention is that when the war situation is easier and if the funds can be made available, a contract may be placed with an Ur Conditioning Finn in India for the supply of the requisite number of plant to you and that the # importing firm will be granted an import license. It is expected that hen the manufacturers of the air conditioning equipment in the United States of America are allowed to change over from the war production to peace production, there will be a heavy demand on them i or such equipment, and therefore the sooner a contract is placed m the United 1 tales of America the better. % I am desired to request that the Government of India # may be furnished wiih information as to the description and number of the b uildin^s in rnich it is considered essential to instal the air conditioning plants and the number of plants required. On the supply of the plants it will presumably be jossible for the Uechaaic-in-charge pf the /ork-snop of the Per si,an Gulf Independent 'job-Givisi on to instal tiiem in the various buildings, but the Government of India would like to ' know whether the maintenance of the plants will necessi tate the engagement of any extra mechanics, and if so, vdiat the cost involved will be. ment oOoSecretaiy of State The answer proposed hy the Department is: 'I have no information on the subject, but am consulting the Government of IndiaS.--- This is suggested v/ithout knowledge of- the fact, the welfare context, that considerable quantities is v/anted for hospitals'-and troop trains in India and cannotdbd obtained because it is in very short supply.

Lt rV Question by Fo: ^ jr ■rf- Sir Waved Wakefield—To ask the Secretary of State for India, when he expects to have air conditioning plant installed in the residences and offices of political officers in the Persian Gulf. [Thursday 26th April.] MINUTE OR SUGGESTED REPLY. (X. (*,*(Lr Hw C-fc/iu. t— 0 ; FU dUMtj fa A The political officers in the Persian Gulf to whom the questioner is referring are presumably the political Agents at Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat and the political Resident at Bushire. The Government of India have the primaiy responsibility for the upkeep of their residences and offices bearing the whole cost at Bahrein and Muscat and sharing that at Koweit and Bushire with H.M.G. So far as I am aware the question of installing air-conditioning plant has not yet been considered by the Government of Indiai I understand that it has been installed in parts at least of the Legation at Jedda and the Embassy at Bagdad, and I think that the American/ (26034) Wt.41S15/P.179 500 11/43 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685(!&amp; fa fa** £&gt;) American ®il Company^have installed i^T for their employees at Bahrein, fLit is probably this that Sir W. Wakefield has in mind since his brothei^^^wSs ^ political agent at Bahrein. I understand that at Jedda, at ary rate, air- conditioning is considered a great boon and it would be no doubt a good thing if it could be installed in the /Agencies. The Ministry of Works say, however, that there are liable to be practical difficulties in installation since it depends on the local supply of electric current and probably it would in ary case be difficult to obtain the equipment at the moment. A draft reply is suggested. f.O. ' / i~-0 t^COCo-3 On further reflection, I am a little doubtful whether the proposed reply is altogether suitable. In the first place it does not really answer the question when the introduction of air conditioning is expected. Secondly, it suggests that the final decision in a matter of this kind rests with the Government of India and that the Secretary of State’s ^eoiiion is that of an intermediary between the Member and the Goverrment of India. As I see it, the Secretary of State might well be expected by the Member to take a more active interest in the matter than this.•i. i © Although the Indian 'olitical Service is not technically a Secretary of State’s service, I presume that he has some responsibility for their conditions of service, in view of his responsibility for External Affairs. If this is accepted, it may be thought preferable for the Secretary of State to reply that he will call for a report from the Government of India on the possibilities of adopting the suggestion rather than that he will simply pass the suggestion on. My own feeling is, therefore, that a reply on the lines of the alternative marked ’'B'’ below would be more suitable.
