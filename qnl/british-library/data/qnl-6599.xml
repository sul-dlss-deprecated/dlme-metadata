SECRET. Trans-Persian Railway. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 29th May 1913. Private. Your Secret Despatch No. 1 1 of 13th February. Trans-Persian Railway. Please let me have your personal views on question of alignment as soon as possible. Also whether if main line is taken to Kerman, military authorities consider that immediate increase of army or other measures will be necessary, and if so, what. Russia has made it clear that if Kerman is not included the scheme will break down altogether, and she will consider herself free to build as she pleases, including eventually line to Meshed and southwards. Whether this risk is worth taking must depend partly on immediate measures which inclusion of Kerman would necessitate Mkmouandum by the Indian General Staff. The following remarks by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief are submitted upon the points raised in the “ Private ” telegram P. of -9th May 1913, from the Secretary of State to His Excellency the Viceioy :— 1. Taking the first points raised in the telegram—whether an immediate increase to the army in India, or other measures, will be necessary if the main line is taken to Kerman, and if so what increase or other measures— no satisfactory attempt to frame the reply can be made without an endeavour to gauge the Russian attitude of mind as it appears to us to be therein revealed. 2. If no intention inimical to British interests or to the security of our military possession of India can be discovered, we might conclude that Russia will adhere for some considerable time to the spirit and letter of the Convention and to her declared policy of respecting our wishes and interests, and we might, therefore, postpone steps to protect ourselves against future dangers. It is no part of our business to speculate on the influence, temporary perhaps, which has brought about the present remonstrance, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the building of railways has an effect far beyond the present generation, and that the influence now at work may re-assert itself again and again and have a permanent effect on Russian policy. With every wish to credit Russia with friendly intention, we find in the telegram under consideration evidence of a contrary nature which, in our opinion, cannot be ignored with prudence, especially if we remember her present attitude on the Afghan border. Her protest against the omission of Kerman from the direct line is accompanied by an assertion of freedom to build elsewhere, including Meshed and southwards of that place. But Russia is already free to build where she likes in her own sphere, though in the neutral sphere “ previous arrangement ” with us, if we wish it, is implied in the Convention. Her claim for freedom must, therefore, have reference to the neutral sphere and amounts to an intimation that she will consider herself released from the “ previous arrangement ” clause. 3. The reference to a line to Meshed and southwards is in this light significant. The line can hardly be intended to foster her own trade, for it would lead to no industrial or commercial centre without crossing the limit of our sphere. There can be no pretence that it is designed for a through connection between Russia and India, between West and East, for it would involve either the crossing of the Caspian Sea or a very circuitous route via Tashkend and Orenburg. Moreover, it is ex hypothesi to be built withoutour consent, which, therefore, excludes any idea of linking India with Russia by means of this line. On the other hand, any line from the Central Asian Railway in the direction of beistan constitutes a direct menace to our strategical position covering the North Vest Frontier, which it threatens in flank. The Russian General .stall are well aware of this, and by choosing this line as an alternative ! ■ llo ' v anxious they are to ensure that any line that is built should benent Russia strategically. This would appear to have been in their minds from the first, when Captain Rittich mooted the through Trans-Persian line as a strategic measure, with Chahbar for its terminus as a port on the open sea under Russian influence. Jrom the extracts which we have been allowed to see from the merno- . accom pan ie d the original Consortium proposal, it is also clear _Iiat the Russian strategical requirements were therein carefully safeguarded. Later on M. Sazonoff expressed his disappointment at the selection of Bandar Abbas, and contrasted that port with Chahbar or Gwattar much to its dis advantage, though Ins information on that point was incorrect. Bandar Abbas being m fact the best port on that coast. 4. It, therefore, seems to be a fair deduction from her present attitude following on what has preceded it, that Russia desires the through railway to he built in such a way that she shall benefit strategicalIv, and rioRtlv thinks that any such benefit would be neutralised by its leading direct to Bandar Abbas, instead of to Kerman. The threat which she now holds out and the length to which she is prepared to go in disregard of the Convention’ is a measure of her disappointment at having to forego the strategic value of a direct connection between the railways of Southern Russia and^Kerman It may also be pointed out that, should we withdraw from our present position and agree to the mam line passing through Kerman, Russia will still be at liberty to construct a line south from Meshed and will indeed have an additional inducement to repeat the process of bringing pressure to bear on us by this means. At present, even if she means to fulfil the threat conveyed in the communication under reference, we should, as will be shown later, lose less by her so doing, than by yielding to the pressure she is bringing to bear. 5. Tlie strategic advantage to Russia and the corresponding disadvantage to us of a direct line to Kerman have already been discussed in SirP Lake’s paper of 5th September 1912 (with which the Commander-in-Chief was in complete agreement), which was laid before the Honourable Mr. IV. H. dark s Committee on the subject of the proposed railway. In that paper it was shown that the military strength of Russia as compared with that of India, was so great that if she were in a position to develop the whole or even a large proportion of it at the front, the Army of India would be overwhelmed. As Sir Ian Hamilton told the Sub-Committee ot Imperial Defence m 1907 in this connection, “How can a non -conscript nation stand up against a conscript nation ? ” 1 It was further shown, in the original scheme for the defence of India prepared by Lord Kitchener in 1906. and examined by the Imperial General btall and the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1907, as well as in its further recent examination by the Indian General Staff in 1911, that the whole ot the available mobile forces of India, together with such reinforcements as it was hoped might be contributed by Great Britain and the Dominions over- seas, would only be sufficient to oppose approximately equal forces to those which Russia could, under existing conditions, deploy on the two lines of advance against Kabul and Kandahar alone. It was also demonstrated that no troops could be made available from the Indian Army to oppose a further Russian advance, should a third line of attack become open to her, without reducing the forces employed upon the two first named lines to a dangerous extent. . ' e 00,11 1. 1 not , t0 1)6 !l kh' to spare more than perhaps 20,000 to 60,000 troops, for the purpose, while, judging from previous actual performances by Russia, it was calculated that she could fairly rely upon maintaining at least 200,000 men at any point on such a line as the Trans- 1 ersian Railway is intended to be.f). It was for this reason, viz., that we could only spare hut very few troops to act on this line, that the Indian military authorities unanimously wanted the I rans-hersian Railway to be made vulnerable to our sea power, by being easily accessible from the sea for as great a distance as possible— for then we could hamper the hostile advance by threatening the rear of the enemy’s force from the sea as it advanced, and, with good fortune, by cutting its communications If we cut them, it would be forced to return to restore them, or starve. If it decided to guard them so strongly as to make them safe against our attack on such a long line open to the sea, then its offensive force would be enormously reduced and we might eventually hope to meet what remained, face to fact, with some prospect of success. On the other hand, if the railway ran fai inland, we could only try to cut it from the sea under great disadvantages. In fact, all the chances would lie on the enemy's side and against us. We might fairly hope that, with the line running along the sea shore from Bandar Abbas, the enemy would require 100,000 men to protect it, but with the line running inland via Kerman-Regan-Bampur toChahbar, probably half that number would suffice, leaving 1 f&gt;0,000 of the 200,000 mentioned above available to meet us at the front. If the main line, as desired by Russia, is made to pass through Kerman prolongation to the coast at or near Chahbar would follow as a matter of course, and would enable Russia to deploy an army in war time at any point on the line without our being able to interfere with the operation. In course of time, except w r e took steps as suggested in paragraph 9, and if no war occurred previously, the sea port on the Indian Ocean would practically become a Russian port as obviously intended from the first, with results both financial and moral upon the political position of India which might com pletely change the balance of power in the East, and seriously imperil our hold on this country. In war time Russia could construct a line from Kerman towards Seistan arid Nushki, with sufficient rapidity to turn our flank at Quetta, this forcing us to form front to a flank, for which operation, as well as for an advance southwards, she would then have more than sufficient troops. These manoeuvres would be rendered practically impossible if the main line led direct to Bandar Abbas. By the strong action she is now taking, Russia show's that she understands this fully, and that she is prepared to risk much to secure the strategic advantages of a direct line to Kerman, with its consequent effect on public feeling in India. 7. From wdiat has been said in the preceding paragraphs we arrive at the conclusion, therefore, that we shall want at a low estimate 100,000 more men in the field, if the railway runs by Kerman, out of reach of our attack from the sea, than if it runs along the coast. This means that, in addition to large immediate increases to our Indian forces, we should have to call upon Great Britain and the rest of the Empire for further assistance. As w r e are already calculating on getting from the above sources the largest reinforcement possible at present besides drafts to replace wastage, it is evident that the bulk of the increase must come from India, probably at least 50,000 men or the equivalent of three divisions and one cavalrj' brigade. Moreover, Lord Kitchener estimated, and his estimate has never been seriously disputed, that we should need as a minimum nine divisions and eight cavalry brigades across the frontier to meet the advance by Kabul and Kandahar. The Army in India Committee considered that, if Russia could be excluded from our calculations, five instead of eight cavalry brigades would suffice beyond the frontier, and also that one division more than Lord Kitchener contemplated, besides the cavalry thus set free, might have to be ictained in India for internal security. Assuming the Army in India Committee calculations to be accepted, then three cavalry brigades and one division will have to be added to the 50,000 men to be provided by the Army in India as just mentioned. 8. If, therefore, access to India by a line of railway safe from interruption is to be allowed to Russia, India will apparently, under the most favourable S. 215. A 2circuinstances of internal peace and unrestricted assistance from other parts of the Empire, need the following additions to her Army lor war : Four Cavalry Brigades (including three to replace those detailed for internal security); Four Divisions (including one to replace the Division detailed for internal security ; and some Army Troops. This means a total of about 60,000 fighting men, of whom, working on the accepted proportion, 24,000 would be British and the remainder Indian. This can, of course, be nothing more than a rough general estimate, but, having in view the uncertainty of the attitude of Afghanistan and the frontier tribes in such a contingency, it is more likely to be an under- than an over—estimate. The raising of the Indian portion of such an additional force must require consideration in view of the political factors involved, including the price of labour and the paucity of fighting races in India; and, to judge from past experience, it must inevitably take a long time to carry a scheme of such magnitude to completion, both from the point of view of finance and of the provision ol equipment and barracks. II, however, it is to be available, say eight years hence, its organization should be proceeded with at once, with the least possible delay. 9. It is also asked what other measures are advocated in the event of the Kerman alignment being adopted. In the General Stall Memorandum ol 3rd January 1911 on this subject, the advisability of fortifying Bandar Abbas was urged, should this port be selected as the point at which the railway would first reach the coast. It was, however, pointed out that this might be politically impossible as it would involve the cession on lease or otherwise of the port in question. Should, however, the more dangerous alignment from Kerman to the Mekran coast be adopted, the necessity for controlling and fortifying the port at which the railway reaches the coast would be even more urgent. For this reason it would be advisable that the port should be at the mouth of the Dasht river at Gwattar rather than at Chahbar, so that no question of our right to control and fortify the port could be raised. Gwattar has also been pronounced the better port. Outside the increase to our military forces already referred to, we know of no other measures save that just mentioned which can be recommended as minimising the danger of this alignment. 10. The foregoing remarks outline the position, if w r e allow r a Trans- Persian Railway to be built and aligned through Kerman. For purposes of comparison, the question K further raised :—What is the real amount oi risk involved in the Russian threat to build railways in her sphere, or south from Meshed if we do not consent to the Kerman line. That when those lines w r ere completed to Seistan or south, there would be risk cannot be doubted. On the other hand, such railways while within her sphere could not for some time harm us much. Presumably no railway could be built within our sphere without our consent, without constituting a direct challenge to us. If we took up that challenge then Russia would find herself at war with us with a railhead several hundred miles from our frontier, and possibly in difficult and barren country. She would not be even within one hundred miles of Seistan. Moreover, such a line would not constitute an independent^ line of operations, as would a direct connection from European Russia to Kerman ; and as operations to the south of Meshed, as well as any she might undertake via Herat towards the 11 elmand, would be dependent on the single line of rail from the Caspian Sea to Askabad, it follows that the numbers which could be supported at the two railheads would be less than were separate and independent lines of railway available. 11. In such circumstances it is doubtful whether she could deploy an appreciably greater number of men against us in front line than under present conditions. And while it may be that indications of a hostile4 5 attitude on her part would make it wise for the Government of India to increase its armed forces with a view to eventualities, still that increase would he quite insignificant compared with what would be required, were the 1 rans-1 ersian Railway ever to take concrete shape on the Kerman or other cognate inland alignment. It would be for consideration when the time came whether the best retort to any such action on her part would not be to start the construction oi a railway liom the Mekran coast to Seistan as soon as she began to com mence construction towards Meshed ; although we must recollect that there are serious military objections to developing Seistan, which in our interests it would on no account be permissible to do from the direction of Nushki. 12. To sum up, the Commander-in-Ohief considers that for England to yield to the implied threat and to agree to the alignment of the main line through Kerman would involve at least the addition of the forces named above to the Army in India, as well as further demands upon the United Kingdom and the rest of the Empire for assistance in the event of war. On the other hand, the risk involved in leaving Russia at liberty to carry out her threat if she likes is by no means commensurate with the expense involved in such an increase to the Army. If, however, it should be decided to agree to the alignment through Kerman, then it will become imperative to undertake these increases without avoidable delay.
