Accord ingly a brief summary is submitted of the principal events in the modern history of Persia, which will, it is hoped, illustrate the political rela tions of that power to the eastward, and at the same time furnish an easy means of reference to the progress of affairs in that country, which has long been wanting in the Foreign Depart ment. To this has been added a sup plementary note on the Turkomans, Char Eimaks, and people of Seistan, which will indicate the course of events amongst those tribes, and the nature and extent of their political relations with the states on either side. Separation of the ancient from the modern history of Persia.—The ancient history of Persia occupies an important place in the annals of Asia; but the modern history cannot be said to commence until the establishment of the Suffavean2 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. or Sophi dynasty, about the commence- Ante A. D. 1722. ment of the sixteenth century. A broad chasm of nearly nine centuries separates the modern from the ancient empire. The Arab conquest of Persia in the seventh century converted the people of Persia from the religion of the Magians to that of the Koran; but at the same time it established a foreign yoke. Indeed from the seventh century until the commencement of the six teenth century, Persia seems to have had no national existence. In the first instance, she formed a province only of the Arab empire of the Caliphs of Damascus and Bagdad;* and subse- * Persia UIlder the Arabian Caliphs, A.

Even in the matter of religion there was a grave sectarian difference between the Persians and their conquerors, which had arisen almost immediately after the subjection of the country by the Arabs, and the conversion of the nation to the Mus sulman creed. The Caliphs of Bagdad, and the Turki dynasty of Timour and his successors, were alike Sunnees; but the people of Persia had exhibited from the first a deep sympathy with the cause of Ali, and consequently belonged to the sect of Shiahs.^ D. 1722, Ante A.

Independent Empire of Persia under the Shiah dynasty of Suffaveans, 1600 to 1722.—This attachment of the Persian nation to the Shiah faith has proved of paramount importance in resuscitating and main taining its individual existence. The re volution which established the Suffavean dynasty on the throne of Persia may be regarded as a religious movement, which imparted new life to the nation, and en abled it to throw off the yoke of ages and establish its independence. Shah I smael, the founder of the dynasty, was a prophet of the Shiahs, who success fully appealed to the popular enthusiasm for the Shiah faith as a weapon by which to overthrow the Usbeg dynasty. The new Suffavean sovereigns reached the zenith of their power under Shah Abbass the Great about the commence ment of the seventeenth century. His empire extended to the Oxus, and in cluded Herat and Candahar. On the south it extended over the Persian gulf. Shah Abbass was an able administrator, but his later years were stained by a cruel jealousy of his own sons, which led to horrible tragedies. Under his successors the empire rapidly degene rated, and the national life ebbed away. At every succession one member only of the royal family was taken from an effeminate prison and placed upon the throne ; whilst all the others were either murdered or deprived of their eye sight. Then generally followed a reign of sensuality; and the travellers of that period furnish graphic pictures of the orgies of intoxicated sovereigns; the bastinadoing of offending guests; the mutilation of musicians and dancing girls in drunken freaks; and the fre quent murder of concubines or favour ites, or even of sons, in fits of jealousy.PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Meantime the outlying provinces threw off the Persian supremacy. Turkey obtained possession of Georgia, Azer baijan and Kurdistan ; and the Imaum of Muscat established his sovereignty over the Persian gulf. Division of the modern history of Persia into five periods, 1722—1869.—The history of Persia under the Suffavean dynasty 4 ended in an anarchy which may be said to have lasted for nearly forty years, namely, from 1722 to 1760; since the only intermission during the whole period was that caused by the usurpa tion of Nadir Shah. This period of anarchy was followed by the establish ment of the Zend dynasty, which was continued with much civil war and bloodshed for thirty-four years, namely, from 1760 to 1794. Lastly, the Zend dynasty was followed by the Kajar dy nasty, which is still reigning, and of which four sovereigns have occupied in succession the throne of Persia. The modern history of the country is thus divisible into six periods, as follows ;— 1st. —The Eevolutionary period, 1722 to 1760. 2nd. —The Zend dynasty, 1760 to 1796. Src?.—The reign of Agha Mahomed Khan, the first Kajar, 1794 to 1797. &amp;th.—The reign of Putteh Ali Shah, the second Kajar, 1797 to 1834. 5/fA.—The reign of Mahomed Shah, the third Kajar, 1834 to 1848. 6th.—The reign of Nasser-ud-deen Shah, 1848, who is still on the throne. The history of these periods will now be briefly related in successive chapters.* Ante A.

A. D. 1722 to 1747. Afghan rule in Persia, 1722-1730.—During the last years of the Suffavean dynasty, the Afghans to the eastward asserted and maintained their independence at Herat and Candahar. Subsequently, the Afghans were impelled, partly by hope of plunder and partly by religious hatred towards the Shiahs, to move on towards Ispahan. Here, after a des perate siege, in which cannibalism was openly practiced in the streets of the capital, the Afghans compelled Shah Hussein, who may be called the last of the Suffavean sovereigns, to abdicate the throne. During the eight years which followed, the Afghans exercised a brief but bloody rule. Indeed the horrors of Afghan dominion in Persia are indes cribable. Wholesale massacre, pillage, and outrage were practiced by a brutal soldiery, under the direct encourage- * Malcolm's History of Persia, Vol. I, p. 596 ment of their no less savage masters.* et seq.; Vol. II, pp. 1-43. Reign of Nadir Shah about 1730—1747.— Here it should be remarked, that when Shah Hussein surrendered his throne to the Afghans, his eldest son Shah Tahmasp put forth a feeble claim to the kingdom. Por a long time, however, he was wholly unable to make head b ^oentsin^; against the Afghans. Subsequently ■issSS I'S6 PERSIAN AFFAIRS, two imlividuals appeared in support of the young prince, who were destined to leave a lasting name in Persian annals. The first was Futteh Ali Khan, a chief of the Kajar tribe in the region to the south of the Caspian, who is famous as the ancestor of the Kajar dynasty, which at this day occupies the throne of Persia. The second personage was a petty robber of Khorassan, afterwards known as Nadir Shah. These two men engaged in active rivalry, which terminated in the murder of the chief of the Kajars by the unscrupulous Nadir. The career of the new conqueror is a matter of general history. It will suffice to state here that Nadir Shah drove the Afghans out of Persia, and endeavoured to asso ciate himself with the Suffavean dynasty by marrying his eldest son to the daughter of Shah Hussein, who was also sister of Tahmasp. After this he cau tiously dethroned Tahmasp, and assumed the sovereignty. Ultimately he extend ed his empire over all the territories which had been conquered by Shah Abbass. He became master of the whole country from the Caspian to the Oxus and Indus; and connected himself by matrimonial alliances with the states beyond those boundaries. The Mogul emperor of Delhi gave his daughter in marriage to a son of Nadir Shah, with all the provinces westward of the Indus as her dowry. The Ameer of Bokhara beyond the Oxus gave his daughter in marriage to a nephew of Nadir Shah, and paid homage to the Persian ruler.* Absence of religious or national enthusiasm in the career of Nadir Shah.-The dynasty of Nadir Shah was, if possible, more 7 brief and unsubstantial than that of any A.

D. 1747 to 1760. * Malcolm's Persia, Vol. II, pp. 98-108 of the nomade conquerors who had gone before him, excepting perhaps that of the Afghans. It was not the result of a religious movement, like that which placed Shah Ismael upon the throne more than two centuries previously. Neither was it a national movement in which a hero had risen from the people, and successfully rallied them against a foreign invader. On the contrary. Nadir Shah was an enemy to the Shiah reli gion, and an unscrupulous usurper. He espoused the religion of the Sunnees with the view of maintaining his domi nion over the outlying provinces of Turkistan and Afghanistan, and with out regard to the deeply rooted prejudi ces of his Persian subjects in favour of the Shiah doctrines. Moreover he seems in a great measure to have abandoned the ancient capital of Ispahan, and to have made Meshed his capital; with the view apparently of maintaining a strong reign over his newly conquered provinces to the eastward. In 1747 Nadir Shah was assassinated at Meshed, and this event was followed by massacre and anarchy ; and for many years the country was deluged with blood, by a succession of rival chieftains who were actuated by little more than a vulgar lust for plunder and dominion.* Revolutionary anarchy in Khorassan, 1747- 1760—It will be wholly unnecessary to follow in detail the progress of affairs in 8 Persia during this period of revolution ary anarchy. Nadir Shah had been murdered at Meshed, the capital of Khorassan; and Khorassan thus became the chief theatre of the wars and intrigues as regards the succession.PERSIAN AFFAIRS. The first series of massacres was carried out by a nephew of the deceased ruler named Adil Shah. Under this man's orders every son and grandson of the family of Nadir Shah was put to death, excepting a hoy named Shah Rukh, who was only fourteen years of age. After some bloody struggles for the throne, it appeared that Shah Rukh would suc ceed. He was a grandson of Nadir Shah, with a double claim to the Persian crown ; for his father was the eldest son of Nadir Shah, whilst his mother was a daughter of Shah Hussein. But a reli gious outcry was raised against Shah llukh. It was asserted that he was a Sunnee like his grandfather, and that he would revive the old persecution of the Shiahs. A son of the priest in charge of the Shiah shrine of Imaum Reza at Meshed headed the rebellion, and Shah Rukh was taken prisoner and his eyes put out. Other revolu tions followed. Meantime, Ahmed Shah Abdallee, an Afghan soldier of fortune in the army of the deceased Nadir Shah, had established himself as an independ ent sovereign over the whole of Afghan istan, inclusive of Herat and Seistan. Ahmed Shah seems to have perceived the advantage of making Khorassan a buffer between his new empire and Persia pro per. Accordingly he induced the people of Khorassan to form that province into a separate principality under the blind Shah Uukh, who henceforth ruled over Khorassan under the powerful guarantee of his Afghan neighbour. Indeed, for some years after this arrangement, Khorassan was virtually a part of A.

Contest in the Western Provinces—Whilst these bloody struggles for sovereignty were being carried on in Khorassan, an 9 old race hatred was breaking out in the western provinces. Erom time imme morial there have been three conflicting elements in the population of Persia, which have been occasionally restrained by the strong arm of a sovereign like Nadir Shah, but which have always taken advantage of a time of disorder to com mence disturbances. These are the * Malcolm's Persia, Vol. XL, pp. 115-121. Persian, the Arab, and the Turkoman.* The Persian, the Arab, and the Turkoman.— The Persian citizens and cultivators are not warlike; but as nearly all the towns 10 and villages are walled, their support is of considerable importance to a rival chief during a civil war. The Arabs, again, have lost the prestige in Persia which they maintained under the glori ous rule of the early Caliphat, but they are still capable of giving much trouble. They chiefly occupy the level country along the shore of the Persian Gulf; and, whilst yielding more or less obedience to the Persian government, have often maintained a rude independence. The real antagonism, however, lies between the Persian nomade and the Turkoman nomade, the two great military classes of the population. The Persian nomades are the native tribes, who continue to live in tents, and change their residence with the season. Their dialects are different, but they all belong to the Pehlvi stock. They inhabit the ranges of highlands which stretch from the neighbourhood of the entrance to the Persian Gulf in a north-westerly direc- Vol.n.pP' 108 ' 11 ^ 1 tion along the left bank of the Tigris in, PP i, 37-^10 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. as far as Armenia. This region thus includes Kerman, nearly all Ears, a part of Irak and the whole of Kurdistan. The Turkomans, on the other hand, are of foreign extraction. They are called indiscriminately Tartar and Turkish. At different periods they have accompanied conquerors from heyond the Oxus, fiom the banks of the Volga, and from the plains of Syria into Persian territory. Their habits resemble those of the Persian nomades, but they speak a different language. But the antagonism between Persian nomade and Turkoman nomade is not to be ascribed to a mere difference of language. From the advent of Islam to the death of Nadir Shah, the sovereign of Persia had always been either Turkish or Arab ; and no member of the Persian nomade tribes had ever ascended the throne. It is this fact which probably originated that bloody rivalry between the two classes of nomades, which is known in Persian history as the struggle between the Zend and the Kajar.* Origin of the Zend and the Kajar.—The Zends are perhaps the most illustrious of all the Persian tribes. According to tradi tion they derive their name from having been entrusted by Zoroaster with the care of the sacred Zendavesta. The chief of the tribe at the period under review was Kureem Khan. After the death of Nadir Shah this chief succeeded in estab lishing himself in Ispahan and the southern provinces.

The Kajars were formed into two branches, the upper and the lower; and this distinction should be borne in mind, as it is not without importance even in the present day.* Prior to the abdication of Shah Hussein, the last of the Sulfavean sovereigns, the upper branch had always been superior. But Eutteh Ali Khan, the Kajar, who supported the cause of Prince Tahmasp, was chief of the lower branch ; and his subsequent position as general of the army of Tahmasp gave him an ascendancy over the upper branch. After the death of Putteh Ali Khan the jealousies between the upper and lower branches were fomented by Nadir Shah, who gave the command of Astrabad to the chief of the upper branch. Accordingly Mahomed Hassan Khan, the eldest son of the deceased Putteh Ali Khan, took refuge amongst the independent Turkomans beyond the eastern frontier until the death of Nadir Shah; and then amidst the anarchy which followed that event, this chief returned to his native country, and took possession of the three provinces between the Elburz and the Caspian, namely, Astrabad, Mazanderan, and Ghilan.f Struggle between the Zends and the Kajars, 1763-1760—A deadly war thus com menced soon after the death of Nadir 12 Shah, between Kureem Khan, the Zend chief at Ispahan, and Mahomed Hassan Khan, the Kajar chief beyond the Elburz. In this struggle Shah Rukh of Khorassan took no part. It was simply a contest between the Zend and the Kajar, for the possession of provinces in which Shah Rukh could have no share,23 petisian affairs. and to which after his blindness he could lay no claim. The termination of the conflict is significant of the treacheries of the period. The Kajar chief gained a number of successes, and seemed to be on the point of crushing Kureem Khan, when his army was bought off by gold, and he was compelled to retreat towards his own territory beyond the Elburz mountains. On his way he was murdci eel by a rival chief of the upper branch of the Kajars; but he left a son named Agha Mahomed Khan, who, in after years, fully revenged the death ol his father by the destruction of the dynasty of the Zends.* A.

Establishment of the Zend dynasty.—The es tablishment of the Zend dynasty seems for a while to have restored tranquillity to Persia; but the death of its founder, and indeed every subsequent succession, was accompanied by civil wars which filled the country with bloodshed, and weakened the Zend dynasty to a degree, which finally enabled the Kajars to acquire the ascendancy. Reign of Kureem Khan, the Zend, 1760-1779; transfer of the capital from Ispahan to Shiraz.—The reign of Kureem Khan lasted only nineteen years, but may be characterised as just and comparatively peaceful. He transferred the capital from Ispahan to Shiraz, but there is no event during his rule which would throw any light upon the main object of the present memorandum. Khorassan still remained under Shah Rukh, and thus there could have been little or no communica tion between the Persian governmentand the governments of Bokhara and Meantime the sons ol the unfortunate Kajar chief, together with other members of the family, had fled to the Turkomans ; but they subse quently surrendered to Kureem Khan, and were kept at Shiraz as prisoners at large, but were otherwise treated with everv consideration. Kureem Khan took the sister of the deceased Mahomed Hassan Khan to be his wife, and made her the mistress of his harem; a cir cumstance which was of some import ance in the ultimate rise of the Kajars to sovereign power. Kureem Khan died at an advanced age in 1779. '' Rise of Agha Mahomed Khan, the Kajar, 1779. The death of Kureem Khan was natural ly expected to affect very considerably the 15 future fortunes of the family of the deceas ed Mahomed Hassan Khan, and especial ly those of the eldest son Agha Maho med Khan. The early career of Agha Mahomed Khan was characterised by misfortune, but he was destined to become one of the most important personages in the modern history of Persia. After the death of Nadir Shah, when Mahomed Hassan Khan, the Kajar chief, revolted against the new rule, and established his independence in the northern provinces, Agha Mahomed Khan unfortunately fell into the hands of Adil Shah, the imme diate successor of Nadir Shah. Agha Mahomed Khan was then a lad of ten der years, and Adil Shah had the cruelty to order that he should be reduced to the condition of a eunuch. After the down fall of Adil Shah, the boy returned to his father's house, and henceforth he seems to have devoted all the energies of his mind to the gratification of three master A.

He accompanied Mahomed Hassan Khan in various journeys and campaigns, and was entrusted with the important government of a province; but his career was cut short for a while by the death of his father, and the accession of his detested Zend rival to the throne of Persia. As Agha Mahomed Khan was the eldest son of Mahomed Hassan Khan, he was entitled to succeed to the chiefship of the lower branch of the Kajars ; but he was so closely pressed by the hereditary enemies of his father, that he was compelled to fly to the Turkomans, accompanied by the other members of his family, and ultimately to surrender to Kureem Khan and reside at Shiraz. Here, notwithstand ing the kindness he received, Agha Mahomed Khan sometimes secretly vented his rage against the Zends by cutting up the rich carpets of Kureem Khan; without remembering that if he realized his dreams of ambition and became sovereign of Persia, those very carpets and the palace itself would fall into his own possession. All this while his aunt was the mistress of the royal harem; and when Kureem Khan w r as on his death bed, this lady privately warned her nephew that if he remained at Shiraz after the death of the Zend sovereign, he would certainly be mur dered by the surviving chiefs of the Zend party. Accordingly Agha Ma homed Khan effected his escape from Shiraz under pretence of a hunting expedition, and speedily obtained pos session of all the Caspian provinces which had previously belonged to his predecessors in the chieftainship of the ' lower branch of the Kajars.*1G PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Usurpation of Zeki Khan, the Zend, 17 (9- Meantime Kureem Kli&lt;in had breathed his last; and the throne of Persia was disputed hy his brother and his son. It would be needless to describe the series of tragedies which characterised the struggle between the uncle and the nephew. Ultimately Zeki Khan, the uncle prevailed, and succeeded in estab lishing himself at Shiraz. He then re- vived the feud against the Kajar by sending an expedition against Agha Mahomed Khan, under the command of a kinsman and warm supporter of his own, named Ali Murad. But there was treachery in the camp. Ali Murad re volted against the brother of Kureem Khan, and declared for the son of the deceased sovereign. Zeki Khan left Shiraz furious with rage to wreak his vengeance on his refractory kinsman. In the pursuit he halted at a place called Yezdikhast to collect some taxes ; but found that Ali Murad had been before hand with him and levied the dues, and that the inhabitants refused to pay the taxes twice over. In his wrath he or dered eighteen of the principal citizens to be thrown down a precipice of the rock on which the city stands. This act of cruelty, added to others equally atrocious, soon brought his career to an end. One night his tent ropes were cut by his guards, and he was dispatched with their daggers whilst struggling in the folds of the pavilion.* Abul Futteh Khan, the Zend, 1780-81.—The death of Zeki Khan was followed by the accession of Abul Futteh Khan, the eldest son of the deceased Kureem Khan, to the throne of Persia.

Then Ali Murad, who had reached Tehe ran, declared for the imprisoned prince; but Sadik Khan tried to remove the cause of quarrel by depriving the prince of his eye-sight, and thus rendering him in capable of filling the throne of Persia. At this news Ali Murad left Teheran and proceeded to Shiraz; and after a blockade of eight months he succeeded in capturing the place, and putting Sadik Khan to death and all his family.'^ Ali Mnrad, the Zend, 1781-85: successes of Agha Mahomed Khan, the Kajar.—Ali Murad thus became the sovereign of Persia, 18 His first act was to transfer his capital from Shiraz to Ispahan, f His second was to send his son Shaik Vaiz against the Caspian provinces held by Agha Mahomed Khan. In the first instance Shaik Vaiz gained some successes, and compelled Agha Mahomed Khan to fly from Mazanderan to Astrabad. He then sent a detachment in pursuit which was completely cut off by the Kajar chief; and the whole army was seized with such a panic that Shaik Vaiz re treated with all speed to Teheran. Ali Murad had already arrived at Teheran from Ispahan; and he was so enraged at the chiefs who had abandoned his son, that he ordered their brains to be beaten out with wooden mallets. He would then have marched in person against Agha Mahomed Khan, but was called away to the southward by tidings of a revolt of his half brother, Jaffir Khan, and he died on the road from Teheran to Ispahan.}:se 18 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Struggle between Jaffir Khan, the Zend, and Agha Mahomed Khan, the Kajar, 1785-89.— Meantime Jaffir Khan advanced to Ispahan and took possession of the throne of Persia. He had now two enemies to deal with, namely, Shaik Vaiz, the son of the deceased Ali Murad, and Agha Mahomed Khan, the chief of the lower branch of the Kajars and heredi tary enemy of the Zends. He overcame Shaik Vaiz by treachery. He cajoiled the prince with a friendly letter, and thus got him in his power, and then immediately put out his eyes. The attention of Jaffir Khan was next drawn to Agha Maho med Khan. During the previous reign Agha Mahomed Khan had with diffi culty maintained himself in Mazande- ran ; but he had long promised his fol lowers that when Ali Murad should be out of the way he would advance to wards the south. No sooner did he hear that Ali Murad was dead than he left Mazanderan with a small army, which was rapidly joined by so many disaffected chiefs that he was enabled to take posses sion of Teheran and Ispahan, and to com pel Jaffir Khan to retire in the utmost confusion to Shiraz. It is needless to detail the military operations which fol lowed. They were brought to a close by the violent death of Jaffir Khan. That sovereign had excited such disaffection by his breach of faith, that poison was mingled with his victuals, and a party of conspirators broke in and put him to death whilst he was writhing with the agony. The people of Shiraz were then auddenly apprised of the death of their sovereign by seeing his bleeding head thrown out from the citadel into the pub lic square.* A.

ZEND DYNASTY. 19 Succession of Lootf AliKhan, the last of the Zends, 1789.—Jaffir Khan left one son, who has long been celebrated in Persian annals 20 as the hero of the Zends and the last of the dynasty. His name was Lootf All Khan. This prince was engaged in the reduction of Kerman when he heard that his father had been murdered at Shiraz. At this time he was only eighteen years of age, but he had already distinguished himself in war. Accord ingly when he heard the news of the tragedy at Shiraz, he at once marched against that city. At that time the chief magistrate of the province of Ears was Hajee Ibrahim, a man whose fortunes had been closely bound up with those of the Zend rulers to whom he had rendered great service, and by whom he had been liberally rewarded. Through the influ ence of this important personage, Lootf Ali Khan was readily admitted into Shiraz, and succeeded in obtaining pos session of the throne of Persia. His dominion, however, only extended over the southern provinces. The northern provinces were still in the possession of the Kajar chief, Agha Mahomed Khan, who had made Teheran his capital, and still retained possession of Ispahan; and who was actively preparing to engage in ( _ a desperate struggle for the throne. * Contrast between Lootf Ali Khan and Ag-ha Mahomed Khan.—Before glancing at the progress of this memorable conflict 21 between the Zend and the Kajar, it is curious to notice the remarkable con trast between the chiefs on either side. Lootf Ali Khan was young, brave, and handsome, and was already famous throughout Persia for his warlike ac complishments. He seemed in fact to■ • - 20 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. be the ideal of a Persian hero, who possessed all the attributes which the national bards had fondly ascribed to Rustum. On the other hand, Agha Mahomed Khan was a eunuch in his forty-seventh year. In size he was as diminutive as a boy of fourteen or fifteen; whilst the constant fire of rest less ambition rendered his features as lean and shrivelled as those of an old woman. But he was cruel to ferocity in the attainment of his ends; and it was in a great measure by his remorse less barbarities and indomitable will, that he at last succeeded in obtaining the mastery over his more highly favoured rival.* Early disasters in the reign of Lootf Ali Khan, 1789-90— Jaffir Khan had been slain in February 1789. In the early part of 22 the following summer, Agha Mahomed Khan left Teheran with an army of fifty thousand men and marched towards Shiraz. Lootf Ali Khan at once took the field against him, and in all probability would have defeated him; but during the engagement his troops began to desert him and retreat towards their native hills, and Agha Mahomed Khan was thus en abled to obtain the victoiy. Lootf Ali Khan, however, succeeded in reachinsr Shiraz; and although Agha Mahomed Khan followed him and laid siege to the city, he failed to take it, and was ulti mately compelled to return to Teheran. In 1790 Lootf Ali Khan expected a renewal of the siege, but Agha Mahomed Khan was at this time too much engaged in maintaining his own authority in Azerbaijan to attempt a second expe dition against Shiraz. Accordingly Lootf Ali Kb an determined to march once A. D. 1789, 1790. * Malcolm's Persia, Vol. II., pp. 177-300,- Watson's Persia, p. 67. * laicZEND DYNASTY. more against Kennan, which he had been endeavouring to reduce when he was call ed away by the news of his father's mur der. The governor of Kerman offered to pay tribute to Lootf Ali Khan on the condition that his attendance at Shiraz should be dispensed with ; but the impe tuous young Zend refused to accept the terms, and set out with his army in the beginning of winter, and commenced the siege of the city of Kerman. The result was that the army of Lootf Ali Khan perished of cold and hunger. Heavy falls of snow cut off the supplies of provisions; and at last so much disaffec tion was excited that he was compelled to raise the siege of Kerman and return to Shiraz.* Breach between Lootf Ali Khan and Hajee Ibrahim—At this juncture a breach arose between Lootf Ali Khan and Hajee Ibrahim, which proved fatal to the Zend dynasty, llajee Ibrahim had long ren dered loyal and valuable services to the Zend sovereigns; and it was to his active support that Lootf Ali Khan obtained possession of Shiraz. In return Lootf Ali Khan made Hajee Ibrahim his minister; but soon grew jealous of his authority. Hajee Ibrahim exercised a strong local influence in Shiraz, by which indeed he had been enabled to place Lootf Ali Khan in the possession of the southern province, but which nevertheless excited the growing suspi cion in the mind of the young sovereign that his minister was entertaining ulterior designs. Under such circum stances it needed very little to create an open rupture ; and this was brought about by a somewhat curious incident.PERSIAN AFFAIRS. In the previous reign a certain pay master of the army had been accused of peculation, and Jaffir Khan had ordered his ears to be cut olt. Sub sequently, as already related, Jaflir Khan had been murdered, and his head thrown into the public square ; and when the head was recovered, it was found that the ears had been cut off; and it was suspected that the default ing paymaster had committed this mutilation to avenge the indignity to which he had been subjected by Jaffir Khan when alive, llajee Ibrahim how ever was fully convinced of the man's innocence and procured his pardon ; and some months afterwards, when dresses of honour were being distri buted by Lootf Ali Khan, one was given to the paymaster. The mother of Lootf Ali Khan heard of this circum stance, and complained bitterly that her son should have rewarded the wretch who had mutilated the remains of his father. The young sovereign was stung to the quick by this taunt, and he ordered the man to be burnt alive. Hajee Ibrahim was summoned, but only arrived in time to behold the charred remains of the victim whom he had recommended for pardon. From that moment the minister saw that his existence was at stake, and that his only chance of escape was by subverting the authority of his royal master.* Agha Mahomed Khan obtains possession of Shiraz, 1791-92.-Meantinie Lootf Ali Khan entertained similar fears of his minister; and considered that the down- tall of llajee Ibrahim was essential to» ZEND DYNASTY. 23 Ul '%ai A.

He refrained from violence, as the influence of llajee Ibrahim was great throughout Ears ; but his acts proved that he had lost all confidence in the man to whom he owed his throne. Plots and intrigues follow ed on both sides, which need not be detailed. It will suffice to say that whilst Lootf Ali Khan was absent on an expedition, Hajee Ibrahim Khan obtained possession of the citadel and garrison of Shiraz; and that when the news reached the camp of Lootf Ali Khan, the whole army broke out into mutiny, and the young sovereign effected his escape with difficulty accompanied by only seventy followers. Lootf Ali Khan then returned to Shiraz, but was refused admittance.

He waited till morning and then found that he had been deceiv ed, and that instead of realising the fruits of his victory, he must fly to Khorassan. The further story of his exploits would, however, be out of place in the present memorandum. In 1704 his career was brought to a close. For four months he maintained an obstinate resistance in the city of Kerman, where one of his most trusted supporters admit ted the enemy to the citadel. On this occasion Agha Mahomed Khan had sur rounded the whole city of Kcrman with troops, and posted a strong force at every gateway. Nevertheless, Lootf Ali Khan crossed the ditch on some loose planks, and succeeded in cutting his way through the enemy and escaping to Nerman- sheer. The rage of Agha Mahomed Khan at the escape of his rival was beyond expression. He wreaked his vengeance upon the unfortunate people of Kerman in a manner which is almost unparalleled in history. He deprived seven thousand men of their eye-sight. A still greater number were slain. Twenty thousand women and children were distributed as slaves to the brutal soldiers. For three months the city was abandoned to the troops, who were not only permitted but encouraged to perform the most bloody and shameless atrocities that can disgrace human nature. At length Lootf Ali Khan fell into the hands of the Kajar. A chief of Nermansheer gave him as a ransom for his brother who had fallen into the hands of Agha Mahomed Khan; and Lootf Ali Khan was overpowered bv numbeis, and carried into the camp of the Kajar, where Agha Mahomed KhanZEND DYNASTY. 25 A, D, 17^ A.

In this state of agony Lootf Ali Khan was carried to Teheran, and was put to death by the bow-string at the early age of twenty- four ; whilst Agha Mahomed Khan ordered nine hundred prisoners to be decapitated for the special purpose of commemorating the downfall of the Zend dynasty by the erection of a pyramid of skulls on the spot where Lootf Ali Khan was captured. This pyramid was seen by Sir Henry Pottinger * Malcolm's Persia, Vol. II, pp. 186-2 0. Wat- in 1810.^ son's Persia, pp. 71-76. Retrospect of the history of the Zend dynasty.— Such was the end of the Zend dynasty, which ruled over the greater part of 26 Persia for nearly half a century, but possessed no stability after the death of its founder Kureem Khan. Its down fall is to be attributed to two causes; first, its internal divisions, and se condly, the genius of their enemy, Agha Mahomed Khan.26 CHAPTER III.

Transfer of the capital to Teheran, 1794.— The death of Lootf Ali Khan, the last sovereign of the Zend dynasty, and the ^ accession of Agha Mahomed Khan as the founder of the new dynasty of the Kajars, naturally led to the transfer of the capital of the Persian empire from Shiraz to Teheran. The reason for this transfer is obvious. The strength of the Zend dynasty depended upon the Persian nomades to the west, and perhaps on the power of the Arabs to the south; and consequently Ispahan and Shiraz proved convenient capitals during the Zend rule. But the home of the Kajars was in the Caspian provinces beyond the Elburz mountains; and consequently it seems to have been necessary for the new dynasty to find a capital in the northern part of the empire, under the wing as it were of the native stronghold of the Kajars. Under such circumstances the site of Teheran was manifestly convenient for a capital; and accordingly it has been adopted as such by all the sovereigns of the Kajar dynasty.* Conquest of Georgia, 1795.— The first con quest effected by Agha Mahomed Khan was that of Georgia.

In 1783, whilst Persia was distracted by the wars between the Zend and the Kajar, Heraclius, Czar of Georgia, transferred his allegiance from Persia to Russia; and the Empress Catherine the Second gua- A, D. 1794,1^ ranteedthe crown of Georgia to Heraclius and his heirs for ever. Accordingly, when Agha Mahomed Khan had established his supremacy, he called on Heraclius to re turn to his allegiance; but the ruler of Georgia replied that he acknowledged no sovereign but Catherine. Agha Mahomed Khan then determined to take Heraclius by surprise, before the Russians could support him; and with this view he ad vanced by rapid marches to Tiflis, the capital. Heraclius fought bravely to the last, but was overpowered by numbers, and compelled to fly to the mountains with a portion of his family. Tiflis was then abandoned to the bigoted and brutal rage of the Persian soldiery. The churches were levelled to the ground; the priests were bound and thrown into the stream; the town was pillaged and burnt; all the aged and infirm were ruthlessly massacred; and fifteen thousand youth of both sexes were carried away to Teheran to end their * Malcolm's Persia, Vol. II, pp. 212-214; days in slavery.* 279-286. Watson's Persia, pp. 77-93. Tacit relinquishment of all right to Afghan 65' territory at the coronation of Agha Mahomed Khan, 1796.—Prior to the conquest of 29PERSIAN APFAIUS. Georgia, Aglia Mahomed Klian had re- A. D. 1796. fused to be crowned Shah of Persia. By that conquest, however, he appears to have considered that he had recovered all the territory which belonged of right to the Persian kingdom, for he allowed him self to be solemnly crowned Shah of Persia at the new capital of Teheran. At the same time it should be mentioned that Agha Mahomed Khan would only assume a small diadem ornamented with pearls, and refused to wear the four great plumes by which Nadir Shah denoted his para mount power over Persia, Afghanistan, India and Tartary. This is a significant circumstance of some political impor tance as regards the extraordinary pre tensions which have been put forward of late years by the Persian court to territories conquered by Nadir Shah. Agha Mahomed Khan permitted him self to be crowned Shah of Persia after he had recovered the province of Geor gia, which had long formed an integral part of Persian territory. He did not, however, apparently consider that the conquest of Khorassan was a necessary preliminary to his coronation as Shah ; although, as will be seen hereafter, the province itself was regarded as a valu able addition to the Persian kingdom.* « ^ i , . r. • ^ , tt ^ &amp; * Malcolm's Persia, Vol. II, p. 287. Conquest of Khorassan, 1796.— Immediately after the coronation at Teheran, Agha Mahomed Khan marched a large force towards Meshed, the capital of Khoras san. He pretended that he was going on a pilgrimage to the holy shrine of Imaum Eeza at Meshed; but his real object was to establish his suzerainty in Khorassan, and to check the inroads of the Turkomans and Usbegs. Above all, 30EEIGN OF AGHA MAHOMED KHAN. 29 lie was anxious to possess himself of the jewels which still appertained to the miserable descendants of Nadir Shah. On his march the chiefs of Khorassan tendered their submission; and as he approached Meshed, the blind Shah Bukh came out to meet him, and to propitiate him with pre sents. The wretched grandson of Nadir Shah was indeed utterly powerless. Hitherto he had ruled over the province of Khorassan under the suzerainty of the Ameers of Afghanistan ; but Ahmed Shah and Timoor Shah had passed away, and Zeman Shah, the reigning Ameer, was far too much occupied at this period with his designs on Hindu stan to pay any attention to the aggressions of Persia in Khorassan. Under such circumstances. Shah Hukh was submissive to the last degree. He was prepared to yield everything except his jewels, and he attempted to evade the demand for treasure, by solemnly protesting that he had none in his pos session. Agha Mahomed Khan, how ever, was remorseless. He ordered the old man to be bastinadoed, but without effect. He then tortured Shah Rukh with hot irons ; and a number of jewels were produced which had been sunk in wells or built up in walls. Still there was one ruby of extraordinary size which had once adorned the crown of Aurungzebe. Shah liukh was supposed to have it in his possession, but not even hot irons could make him give it up. Pinally, a circle of paste was put upon his head, and boiling lead poured into it. Then the aged prince gave up the ruby, and Agha Mahomed Khan pre pared to carry him prisoner to Teheran.30 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Shah llukh, however, died of his tor tures at the age of sixty-three.* Hostilities against Bokhara prevented by Rus- sian aggression, 1796. Whilst Agha Ma homed Khan was thus engaged in Khorassan, he projected the conquest of Bokhara, which was at that time ruled by a mendicant priest named Eegee Jan, who had ascended the throne under the title of Shah Murad. The road to Bokhara however lay through the Afghan province of Balkh; and accordingly Agha Mahomed Khan applied to Zeman Shah for the cession of Balkh. Zeman Shah is said to have agreed to the cession; but before the measure could be carried out Agha Ma homed Khan was recalled to Teheran by the news of Russian aggression in Georgia. The progress of affairs in that direction was indeed alarming. The Empress Catherine, in her wrath at the excesses committed in Georgia, had declared war against Persia; and General Zuboff had recovered posses sion of Georgia. Aga Mahomed Khan threatened vengeance, but appears to have hesitated to bring his irregular forces against the cannon and discipline of Russia. On reaching Teheran he found that some Russian sailors had been taken prisoners and brought to the capi tal in chains; and he wreaked his immediate fury upon these men, by ordering them to be strangled ; but he postponed military operations until the ensuing year. Meantime Catherine the Second ended her extraordinary career on the 9th November 1796 ; and the first act of her son and succes sor, the Emperor Paul, was to recall the Russian army under Count Zuboff.f A.

First rebellion of Nadir Mirza in Khorassan.— Nadir Mirza was the son of Shah lUikh, and, consequently, the great-grandson 31 of Nadir Shah. This prince had left Khorassan during the invasion of Agha Mahomed Khan ; but on hearing that the Shah was dead, he returned to Khorassan and assembled an army. Eutteh Ali Shah now advanced in person into Khorassan, and enforced the obe dience of the chiefs on his way ; but on reaching Meshed, all the holy men of the city came out and implored him to respect the sanctity of the shrine of Imaum Reza. At the same time Nadir Mirza tendered his submission to the Shah. Accordingly the refractory prince was pardoned and entrusted with the government of the province. Nadir Mirza also gave his daughter in mar riage to one of the generals of the Kajar, and sent his brother Abbass to reside at Teheran as a hostage for his t Watson's Persia, Vol. II., p. 121. future good behaviour. f A. D. Relations between Persia and Afghanistan.—At this juncture the attention of the British government was drawn after a long 35 interval to Persian affairs. Tippoo Sultan of Mysore had been intriguing with Zeman Shah of Afghanistan ; and the latter sovereign was making prepa rations for an invasion of Hindustan. Some alarm was felt both at Bombay34 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. and Calcutta at the prospect of an inva sion of Afghans ; for whilst their fero cities and treacheries were tolerably well known, their strength was much exag gerated ; and undue stress was laid upon the crushing defeat which Ahmed Shah Ahdallee had inflicted upon the Mahrat- tas on the plains of Paniput only forty years previously. Accordingly the Bombay government sent an envoy, named Mehdi Ali Khan, to induce the Persian government to create such a diversion in western Afghanistan as would draw off the attention of Zeman Shah from the threatened invasion. At that time two refractory brothers of Zeman Shah, namely, Prince Mahmood and Prince Peroz-ud-deen, were refugees in Persian territory seeking the aid of the Shah against the Afghan Ameer; whilst other circumstances led the Shah of Persia to meditate hostilities against Afghanistan. In 1796 Zeman Shah had been sufficiently alarmed at the progress of Agha Mahomed Khan to agree to the cession of Balkh; but after the death of that sovereign in 1797, he had sent a mission to the Persian court to demand the restoration of Khorassan to the suzerainty of Afghanistan. Fut- teh Ali Shah replied in the usual tone of Persian arrogance, that so far from restoring Khorassan to Cabul, he intended to extend the Persian empire to its ancient limits; in other words, to conquer all Afghanistan to the neigh bourhood of the Indus. Accordingly the envoy from Bombay reached Persia at a time when the Persian government was prepared to assume a hostile atti tude towards Afghanistan; and there upon sent an inflated account of hisUEIGN OF FUTTEH ALI SHAH. 35 A.

Subsequently, however, Putteh Ali Khan received an ambassador from Zeman Shah loaded with presents; and he was so far propitiated that he agreed to return to his capital, Teheran, provided Zeman Shah would receive back his two refractory brothers. The further adventures of these Afghan princes are sufficiently recorded else where. It will suffice to state here that in 1800 Mahmood dethroned his brother Zeman Shah, and deprived him of eye-sight, and then ascended the throne of Afghanistan. About the same time his brother Peroz-ud-deen obtained possession of Herat, and ruled it for many years with only occasional inter- * Memorandum on Afghan Affairs, pp. 31 et ferencc from Persia.* seq. rerrier's History of the Afghans, pp. 112 etseq.

Moreover, Lord Wellesley, who was at this time Governor Gene ral of India, was to some extent alive to the ultimate designs of Napoleon in the east. Accordingly he dispatched Captain, afterwards Sir John Malcolm on a mission to Teheran. Malcolm distributed presents in a somewhat lavish fashion, and succeeded in con cluding both a commercial and a political treaty with the Shah. Under the com mercial treaty the Persian ports were to be opened to English and Indian traders under the protection of the Shah's go vernment. Under the political treaty, the Shah engaged to make no peace with the Afghans, unless the Ameer30 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. agreed to abandon all attempts against Hindustan ; and to exclude all Trench- men from his dominions under any circumstances whatever. Subsequently Futteh Ali Shah sent a return mission. The first envoy from Persia was killed at Bombay in a scuffle between his own servants and the guards appointed to attend him; but the British govern ment made such a liberal reparation to his family, that the Shah is said to have observed that the English might kill as many more of his ambassadors as they pleased on the same terms. However, a second envoy, named Mahomed Nebi Khan, was appointed to succeed the deceased envoy.* Fall of the Minister Hajee Ibrahim—After the departure of Captain Malcolm from Persia, a memorable personage in the 37 modern annals of Persia met with a sudden downfall. This was Hajee Ibrahim, the Persian king-maker. This able statesman had filled the post of prime minister during a considerable part of three reigns. It was by his means that Lootf Ali Khan and Agha Mahomed Khan obtained in turn possession of the throne of Persia; but it was the fate of this kins'- maker not only to depose one dynasty and set up another, but to incur the deadly suspicion of both parties. In the first instance he had excited a jealousy in the mind of Lootf Ali Khan, so deadly, that to save him- self he abandoned the cause of the Zend and transferred the crown to the Kajar; and it is easy to conceive that he may ha'v e stirred up a similar hostile feeling in the mind of a voun^ A.

The stroke which fell upon Hajee Ibra him was sudden and crushing. On a given day the minister and all his relatives were suddenly seized and put to death; and even two young boys were brought from Shiraz to Persia to share the same fate. Their lives were spared, but the elder, who was hand some and high-spirited, was deprived of manhood. The younger escaped on account of his feebleness but lived to perpetuate the family. He became guardian of the shrine of Imaum Eeza at Meshed, and was still residing there in 1864* Second rebellion in Khorassan: downfall of Nadir Mirza, 1802.—Eutteh Ali Shah appears to have effected the destruction ss of Hajee Ibrahim and all his household as a necessary preliminary to the prose cution of ambitious designs at a dis tance from his capital; for very shortly after this event he projected a resettle ment of the affairs of Khorassan. It appears that the rule of Nadir Mirza had proved so oppressive to the chiefs of that province, that they petitioned the Shah to interfere. Putteh Ali Shah accordingly marched a force to Meshed and blockaded the city, but hesitated to open fire upon a place which contained so holy a shrine. The sufferings of the people of Meshed during the blockade were most severe; but they were compelled to submit to the horrors of a continued siege as the gates and citadel were in the possession of Nadir Mirza. At this juncture Nadir Mirza was unable to meet the pressing demands of his soldiery for arrears of pay; and KPERSIAN AFFAIRS. he entered the shrine, and carried away the silver railings from the tomb, and stripped the golden covering from the dome of the mosque. The people were infuriated at this outrage, and prevented further spoliation by sheer force of numbers. Nadir Mirza believed that the crowd had been instigated by a holy Syud, who was seventy years of age, and the foremost saint in Persia. Accordingly, whilst the holy man was engaged in his own house in the act of prayer. Nadir Mirza cut him down with his battle-axe and left him for dead. At this enormity the whole people arose with one accord and threw open the gates of the city to the Persian army. Nadir Mirza escaped through a drain, but was captured outside the walls and carried in chains to Teheran. His punishment was horrible. His hands were cut off, his tongue was torn out, and a red hot wire was drawn across his eyes; and all those who had abetted in the sacrilege were put to death.* Eetrospect of Russian aggressions on Persia.— Whilst Putteh Ali Shah was thus en gaged in putting down rebellion in 39 Khorassan and elsewhere, he had been unable to give his attention to the aggres sions of liussia on his north-western frontier. A brief outline of these aggressions may not be out of place in the present memorandum ; as they tend to show the circumstances under which Persia was so long prevented from press ing her pretensions to the eastward. During the seventeenth century and part of the eighteenth, the chiefs of Georgia had been tributary to Persia ; and had sent every year a number of their sons and daughters to be slaves to the Shah.

During the period of anarchy when the Suffavean dynasty was overthrown by Afghan invaders, Peter the Great had taken possession of certain portions of Persian territory; but these were all covered by Nadir Shah. The distrac tions which followed the death of Nadir Shah in 1747 induced Czar Heraclius, the ruler of Georgia, to throw off the Persian yoke. Erom the death of Nadir Shah to the accession of Agha Mahomed Khan in 1794, there was only one break in these distractions, caused by the tranquil reign of Kureem Khan, the Zend, between 1760 and 1779. Kureem Khan, as already stated, demanded the usual tribute from Hera clius, which should include members of his own family, and twelve sons and daughters under twelve years of age from the families of his nobles. The messenger who carried the demand threa tened hostilities in case of refusal. The nobles of Georgia pressed their ruler to accede to the degrading requisition, but Heraclius was a brave soldier who had served under Nadir Shah, and he reso lutely refused, and Kureem Khan was unable to march an army against him. In 1783, four years after the death of Kureem Khan, Heraclius acknowledged the suzerainty of Russia. In 1795 he was driven out of his territory by Agha Maho med Khan. In 1796 Catherine the Second sent General Zuboff to his sup port ; but the force was withdrawn the following year by the Emperor Paul, and Agha Mahomed Khan marched an army into Georgia where he was mur dered in 1797. Heraclius died in 1798 in his eighty-fourth year, leaving his crown to his son George. Differences40 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. arose between George and his brotliei A. D. 1802 to 1813, Alexander ; and the Emperor I aul published an ukase in 1800, by which he incorporated Georgia with the Russian empire, for the purpose, it was said, ot preventing farther disturbances in that territory. In 1801 George died at Tiflis; and about the same time the Emperor Paul was put to death at St. Petersburg. The Emperor Alexander succeeded to the Russian throne, and confirmed the ukase of his father which annexed Georgia to the Russian Empire. He also appointed General Zizianoff to the post of Governor General of the provinces beyond the Caucasus; and this officer soon engaged in active operations to the eastward, with the view apparently of extending the Rus sian frontier to the Caspian.* * Malcolm's Persia, Vol. II., pp. 212-214.

Russian aggressions, 1802-1813—Eor the first seven years of the reign of Futteh Ali Shah, namely, from 1797 to 1804, 40 the attention of the Shah had been so ex clusively occupied by the rebellions in various parts of his dominions, and especially in Khorassan, that he had been wholly unable to defend the pro vinces on his north-west frontier from the aggressions of Russia. Meantime, General Zizianoff had occupied Min- grelia, and in 1802 he captured the fortress of Ganga, the modern Eliza- bethpool. In 1804, he very nearlv obtained possession of Erivan; for the Persian governor of Erivan rebelled against the Shah, and hearing that a 1 ersian force was advancing against him, he applied to General Zizianoff lor assistance, and promised in return to deliver up the fortress of Erivan toA.

At that time there was no war between Russia and ] Persia, and yet General Zizianoff at once accepted the invitation of the rebel governor, and advanced towards Erivan. Mean time a Persian army under the com mand of Abbass Mirza, the heir- apparent, advanced from the opposite direction for the reduction of Erivan; and although no war had been formally declared, an engagemente nsued be tween the Russians and Persians near the celebrated Armenian convent of Etzmiadin, in which the Persians were defeated. But notwithstanding the defeat of the Persian army, the go vernor of Erivan was so alarmed at the presence of Abbass Mirza in the ileighbourhood of Erivan, that he refused to surrender the fortress to the Russian general. Further hos tilities followed, and ultimately Gen eral Zizianotf was compelled to retreat, whilst the governor of Erivan surrendered on terms to the Shah. In 1805, General Zizianoff again took the field, and reduced the provinces be tween Georgia and the Caspian, and prepared to reduce the fortress of Bakoo, which is situated on a peninsula that juts out into the Caspian sea. The gover nor of Bakoo offered to surrender, and invited Zizianoff to a conference; on which occasion the Russian general was treacherously murdered by assassins. Prom 1805, when General Zizianoff was assassinated, until 1813, when the treaty of Gulistan was signed, Russia was unable to trespass much further on her Persian neighbour. She took pos session of the province of Talish; butPERSIAN AFFAIRS. was far too deeply engaged in the affairs of Europe to add mucli further to her territorial acquisitions on the side of Georgia.* Relations of Persia with France and Great Bri tain, 1800-1813.—When Futteh Ali Shah found himself unahle to cope with 41 Eussia, and perceived that she was extending her aggression to the Caspian, he naturally looked to his English ally for support. Accordingly he direct ed his envoy at Bombay to request the assistance of the British government; but at that time Great Britain was in alliance with Russia, and could not move in the matter. Futteh Ali Shah then made overtures to France, and the idea of an alliance with Persia im mediately seized the imagination of Napoleon, who regarded Persia as part of the great high road leading to Hindustan, which had been traversed by Alexander the Great and Nadir Shah. General Gardanne was despatched by the French Emperor on an embassy to Teheran, and there met with a dis tinguished reception. French officers began to introduce French discipline into the Persian army; and French engineers built the first regular fortifi cations which had been seen in Persia. The government of India was now alarmed at the action of the French Emperor, and endeavoured to recover its lost prestige at Teheran. In 1808, General Malcolm was sent on a second mission to the Gulf. The French influ- ence was however too powerful for him. He was directed to communicate with the prince-governor of Fars, and not to advance nearer to the capital; and he returned to India to press the A D. 1800 to 1813, * Progress of Russia in the East, pp. 56-58.

About the same p time, however, Sir Harford Jones was despatched on a mission to Persia by the Court of St. James' and fortuitous circumstances enabled him to secure that favourable reception at Teheran, which had been denied to the ambassador from the government of India. By this time Futteh Ali Shah had reason for being utterly dissatisfied with his Erench alliance. He had been assured by General Gardanne that, in the event of a treaty being concluded between France and Russia, a stipulation should be inserted for the restoration of Georgia to Persia. In July 1807, the treaty of Tilsit was concluded between Napoleon and Alexander, but no provision was made for the cession of the territory in question. Moreover, the Shah was apprehensive lest his treatment of General Malcolm should lead to hosti lities on the part of the government of India. Accordingly General Gar danne ultimately received his passports; and a preliminary treaty was concluded between England and Persia. In 1810 ' General Malcolm proceeded to Persia on a third mission to support the dignity of the government of India. Finally, in 1811, Sir Gore Ousely proceeded to Persia as ambassador extraordinary from the Court of St. James' and concluded a definitive treaty, under which British officers replaced French officers in the * Progress of Russia in the East, pp. 58-62,— army of the Shah.

As early as 1812, when the French army was harassed by the Russians in the retreat from Moscow, the army of Abhass Mirza, the crown prince of Persia, was cut to pieces hy a Russian army on the hanks of the Araxes; and two British officers, with thirteen sergeants, were in action with the Persian army on that occasion. The diplomatic complication of being en gaged in a close and defensive alliance with two powers who were in active hostility to each other, naturally led to an attempt on the part of the British ambassador to reconcile the differences between the Courts of St. Petersburo- and Teheran. The result was that in 1813 the treaty of Gulistan was con cluded, by which Persia ceded to Russia all the provinces which the latter had acquired, and engaged to maintain no navy on the Caspian. This ceded terri tory included Georgia, Immeretia, Mingrelia, Derbend, Bakoo, and all Persian Daghistan, Sherwan, Sheki, Ganja, Karabaugh, and parts of Moghan and Talish.* * Watson's Persia, p. 169.

Accordingly, it will .be seen that the second son, and not the first, was the crown prince of Persia. The four sons and their respective govern ments were as follows :— 45 1.

It is bounded on the north by Russia, and on the west by Tur key; and its capital, Tabriz, is the principal emporium of Per sian trade. This province fur nishes the best recruits for the Persian army. Its governor is entrusted with the defence of the Husso-Persian frontier, and the northern part of the Turko-Per sian border. Hassan Ali Mirza, Governor of Shiraz .—The province of Shiraz is important from its containing the old Zend capital of Persia. Mahomed Veli Mirza, Governor of Khorassan .—This province was in almost a normal state of rebellion. Its capital was Meshed.* It will be wholly unnecessary to attempt a sketch of the rebellions which occa sionally broke out in different districts M 3. 4446 PERSIAN AFFAIRS, throughout the reign of Futteh Ah Shah; although those in the province ol Khorassan will be occasionally noticed hereafter in consequence of the light which they throw upon the political con dition of the countries beyond the eastern border. It will suffice to say that these outbreaks were not regarded as unmiti gated calamities by the government of the Shah. If the people of a district were driven to disaffection, they were as a general rule soon dragooned into obedience; and the plunder of the disaffected district often restored the mutinous troops to their allegiance at critical times, when the military chest was empty, and they were clamorous for arrears of pay. State of affairs in Khorassan—The progress of affairs in Khorassan during the years immediately succeeding the destruction of Nadir Mirza is somewhat obscure. About 1808 or 1809, Mahomed Veli Mirza, the prince-governor of Khorassan, put forward certain pretensions of the Persian government to the exercise of suzerainty over Herat; and the fact is of some importance as a landmark in the history, inasmuch as no previous claim to Herat had been made by Persia since the death of Nadir Shah. The attempt failed. Mahomed Veli Mirza sent an army against Herat, which was successfully repelled by Prince Peroz-ud-deen, and was compelled to return to Meshed with such cattle as the Persians could plunder from the intervening tribes.* Rebellion in Khorassan, about 1813.

The defeat of Abbass Mirza on the Araxes in 1812, whilst tending to bring about the treaty of Gnlistan, seems to have encouraged the chiefs of Khorassan to rebel against Mahomed Veli Mirza, the prince-gov ernor. Accordingly they took posses sion of Meshed, and so long as they acted in concert, Mahomed Veli Mirza was powerless to oppose them; but mutual jealousies broke up the con federacy ; and the chiefs then returned to their respective strongholds, whilst the prince-governor resumed possession of Meshed. The Khan of Khiva and the Ameer of Bokhara advanced to the assistance of the rebel chiefs; and it is said that the ruler of Khiva was defeated, whilst the ruler of Bokhara tendered an explanation which was ac cepted by the Shah. Subsequently the Turkomans rose in rebellion, if rebel lion it can be called; for they never appear to have acknowledged the supre macy of the Shah.* Mahomed Veli Mirza recalled from Khorassan, about 1814.—During this period, when the Persian government held but a 47 loose hold upon Khorassan, Mahomed Veli Mirza committed an act so vio lent as to lead to his recall. The most powerful of all the chiefs of Kho rassan was a Kara Turkoman named Isaak Khan.f He had originally filled the office of mace-bearer to the chief of his tribe; but having secured the means of constructing a fort at Turbat, he soon obtained the foremost place in the province. His possessions extended over two hundred miles in the neigh bourhood of Meshed and KhafF, and his48 PERSIAN APFA1KS. force included six thousand men, Isaak • • Khan is said to have yielded submission to Afirha Mahomed Khan, and to his O successor, Futteh Ali Shah; but to have imbibed a strong dislike to Mahomed Veli Mirza, and to have employed every species of intrigue with the Shah to procure the recall of the prince-gover nor from Khorassan. Isaak Khan, how ever, still continued to attend the levees of the prince-governor of Khorassan, and to respect his authority; and, though Mahomed Veli Mirza was aware of the extent of his intrigues, he hesi tated to act against a chief of such commanding influence. At length the prince-governor was driven to despera tion by the intrigues against him; and when all the chiefs were as sembled at a certain levee, he ordered Isaak Khan and his son to be seized and strangled in his presence. The other chiefs immediately left Meshed, and fled to their respective strong-holds; and the treacherous act brought about the very disgrace which Mahomed Yeli Mirza had hoped to avoid. Such a storm of indignation was raised, that the Shah was compelled to recall him from the government of Khorassan.* # Watson's Persia, pp. 175, 176. Hassan Ali Mirza restores order in Khoras- san. The province of Khorassan was then conferred upon Hassan Ali Mirza, 48 whose warlike disposition was well cal culated to restore the turbulent chiefs to the authority ol the Shah. Indeed, at this period, the city of Meshed may be said to have been the only place in the vast province of Khorassan, which was really in the possession of the Shah.

Hassan Ali Mirza, however, marched against these refractory chiefs in turn at the head of his army, and gradually reduced them to submission with but one exception. A chief of the Huzaras still held out in his stronghold at Mahmoodabad; and as Hassan Ali Mirza had resolved on an expedition against Herat, he determined to take this fortress on his way. After a desperate assault the fortress was taken, but the chief escaped on horse back, although pursued for twenty miles by the prince-governor in person. Hassan Ali Mirza subsequently wreaked his vengeance upon his prisoners, many of whom he caused to be nailed to the f Watson's Persia, p. 177. ground. 1' A D- 1800-1809. Retrospect of the progress of affairs in Herat, 1800-1809.—It will now be necessary to glance briefly at the affairs of Herat. It 49 i Persia,pp. 175 ,1 has already been stated that about 1800 Prince Feroz-ud-deen obtained possession of that province. For some years subse quently Eeroz-ud-deen was virtually an independent sovereign. On the one hand the tierce internal struggles that were being carried on between the sons of Timoor Shah at Cabul and Candahar, prevented any attempt being made to reduce Herat to the subjection of the reigning Ameer of Afghanistan. On the other hand the pressure of Russia on the- 50 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. north -west provinces of Persia, and the frequent rebellions in Khorassan, pre vented the government of the Shah from asserting any suzerainty over Herat territory. Unfortunately Peroz- ud-deen was induced to interfere in the affairs of Cabul and Candahar. The ruler of Herat was full brother of Mah- mood Shah ; and about this period Mah- mood Shah was compelled to yield the throne of Cabul to his half-brother Shah Shuja. At the same time Kamran, the son of Mahmood, was driven out of Candahar by a nephew of Shah Shuja, and fled to his uncle, the ruler of Herat, for protection. Peroz-ud-deen sent an army under his nephew Kamran to liberate his brother Mahmood, who had been shut up in the Bala Hissar at Cabul, by Shah Shuja. Kamran advanced to Candahar, and was in the full tide of success, when he was suddenly recalled to Herat. Mahomed Veli Mirza had sent a Persian army against Herat, as already stated; and Prince Peroz-ud- deen was comparatively powerless in consequence of the absence of his army under Kamran. However he assembled a few thousand horse of the Eimak tribes, and moved out of Herat to meet the Persians *, but he sustained a severe defeat, and was compelled to return to the city. The Persians then commenced the siege of Herat, and in all probability would have captured the place, as they had good artillery, and had been recently drilled by European officers; but their rear was suddenly attacked by the Heratee army, which had returned under Kamran, whilst their front was assailed by Peroz-ud-deen, who seiz ed the opportunity to make a sallv A.

The result was that the Persians found themselves between two fires, and were compelled to return to Meshed.* This attempt on Herat is said to have been undertaken to coun terbalance the influence which the British government might have been expected at this time to exercise in Afghanistan in consequence of the mission of Mr. Elphinstone to the court of Shah Shuja. Operations of Hassan All against Mirja Meshed, about 1816.—The rebellions which broke out in Khorassan, after the defeat of the so Persian army by the Russians on the river Araxes in 1812, and the recall of Mahomed Veli Mirza from Khorassan, probably prevented any serious renewal on the part of Persia of her pretensions on Herat. According to General Terrier, the Persians made occasional expedi tions to Herat, and were either com pelled or bribed to retire; for although the men of Herat protested against any interference on the part of Persia, and asserted that Herat belonged to Afghan istan, the ruler of Herat could expect no support from Shah Shuja, the reigning Ameer of Cabul, with whom he was at feud. At length Feroz-ud-deen went a little too far; for he furnished assistance to the rebellious chiefs of Khorassan. Accordingly about 1816, Hassan Ali Mirza, the new prince-governor of Khorassan, having reduced the refrac tory chiefs of his province to submis sion, marched an army against Herat to inflict condign punishment on its ruler. The accounts which have been pre served of this expedition are somewhat contradictory. According to Captain52 PERSIAN AFFAIRS, Watson, whose statements are based A. D, 1816. upon Persian authorities, Eeroz-ud-deen invaded the district of Ghorian and cap tured the fortress ; but after the capture of the stronghold of the Huzara chief at Mahmoodabad by Hassan Ali Mirza,* * See para. 4r&gt;. Peroz-ud-deen was so alarmed that he sent an envoy offering to surrender Ghorian, but entreating the prince to spare Herat. Hassan Ali Mirza accepted the fortress of Ghorian, but advanced on Herat and commenced the siege, and terrified reroz-ud-deen into tendering his submission. Peroz-ud-deen was then left in the government of Herat, but was required to pay a line of fifty thousand tomans, and to have the khotbah read for the Shah, and the coinage issued in his name.f Ac- t Watson's Persia, p. jyo. cording, however, to General Ferrier, who derived his information from local enquiries, Hassan Ali Mirza was de tained at Meshed until after the arrival of Eutteh Ali Khan at Herat, and that he consequently never captured Herat at all.t Defeat of Prince Hassan Ali by the Firuzkuhi. —Leaving the capture of Herat by Hassan Ali Mirza an open question of 51 no real importance, it may be stated that after the assumed event Hassan Ali Mirza undertook an expedition against the tribe of Piruzkuhi. It seems that after the capture of Ghorian, the Heratee governor of the place, together with two Khorassan chiefs, had taken refuge with the tribe of Piruzkuhi; and Hassan Ali M^irza and his general Ts- mail Khan, determined to follow the fugitives. The expedition, however, terminated in terrible disaster. An ad- X Perrier's History of the Afghans, p. 152. See Memorandum on Afghanistan, paras. 73,74.

Meantime the enemy overlooked their proceedings, and seizing their opportunity, they poured through a gorge into the camp where the Persian plunderers were at work, and gained a complete victory. Ismail Khan was compelled to fall back upon the main army; and Hassan Ali Mirza, finding himself unable to prosecute the war any further, was obliged to retreat to Meshed.* Defeat of Prince Hassan AH by Futteh Khan at Herat, 1817.—Next year Hassan Ali Mirza undertook a second expedition 52 against Herat; and this time he would probably have captured the place but for the intervention of the government of Cabul. It seems that Peroz-ud- deen was so much alarmed at the ex pected advance of the Persian army, that he at last determined to apply to Cabul for assistance. At this time Shah Mahmood was occupying the throne of Cabul having driven out Shah Shuja, through the assistance of his vizier Putteh Ali Khan, the famous Barukzai chieftain. Accordingly the vizier Putteh Ali Khan marched to Herat, ostensibly to assist Peroz-ud- deen against Persia, but on arriving at the place he dethroned Peroz-ud-deen. The result was that Hassan Ali Mirza, instead of gaining a comparatively easy victory over Peroz-ud-deen, found that he had to encounter the whole forces of P utteh Ali Khan. A battle ensued in which, o54 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. according to General .terrier, Hassan Ali Mirza was utterly defeated; but ac cording to Captain atson,i' lie gained the victory. The truth appears to be that the Persians were really defeated and fled to Meshed, leaving their artillery behind them. Subsequently, Futteh Ali Khan received a ball in his throat, and a report spread that he was dead; on which the Afghans were seized with a panic and fled to the city of Herat. The result was that both parties claimed the victory. Progress of diplomatic relations between Persia, Russia and Great Britain.—The progress of diplomatic relations between Persia, Eussia and Great Britain, from the conclusion of the treaty of Gulistan in 1813, to the renewal of the war between Persia and Russia in 1825, are of little practical importance. Both an English and Russian minister were residing at Teheran; and one of the main objects of diplomacy at this period was to settle the Russo-Persian frontier as laid down by the treaty of Gulistan. The question however linger ed on for years without any settlement. Meantime it may be remarked that the continued residence at Teheran of the ministers of Great Britain and Russia increased the stability of the Persian throne, and conferred a greater dignity upon the court. In return, however, for these advantages, Persia was com pelled to conform, in many important respects, to the practices of civilized nations; and in course of time Persian ministers have found it necessary to abstain from acts of needless cruelty and barbarity, by the fear lest theREIGN OF fUTTEH ALT SHAH. 55 foreign residents should mark their horror by withdrawing from all personal intercourse, and lest they themselves should be exposed to the ridicule or indignation of the European press. * War against Turkey; treaty of Erzeroum, 1821-23.—In 1821, war broke out between Persia and Turkey, which originated 54 in some local disputes. Abbass Mirza overran the border from his province of Azerbaijan. The Pasha of Bagdad, in return, overran the border further south, and entered Kermanshah. He was how ever defeated by Mahomed Ali Mirza, who subsequently pushed on towards Bagdad. But the career of Mahomed Ali Mirza, the eldest son of the Shah, 1 was drawing towards a close. He was compelled to return from Bagdad by an attack of disease, which proved mortal, and carried him oif at the age of thirty- seven. Subsequently Abbass Mirza, the crown prince, inflicted a defeat on the Turks. The war was ultimately brought to a close by the treaty of Erzeroum in 1823, under which each power retained the territories which were in its possession at the commencement of f Watson's Persia, pp. 197-204. the War.f Differences with Russia respecting the treaty of Gulistan.—All this while differences between Persia and Russia, arising out 55 of the terms of the treaty of Gulistan, were still as far from settlement as ever. The treaty had not been sufficiently definite as regards certain portions of the line of frontier; and patches of land were claimed, on either side,—by the Russian authorities, with all the arro gance of conscious power, and by the Persian authorities with all the bitterness A.

At length, in 1825, Russia took military possession of the little territory of Gokcheh, which belonged of right to the Shah, and declared that she would continue to hold it until her claims in other directions were conceded. About this juncture, namely, in December 1825, the Emperor Alexander died, and the Emperor Nicholas succeeded to the throne of Russia. Shortly afterwards Prince Menchikoff arrived in Persia for the purpose of arriving at a final arrangement.* Mission of Prince Menchikoff opposed by a reli gious movement, 1825.—Meantime a reli gious movement against Russia had sprung up in the dominions of the Shah. The Russian authorities in Georgia were said to have wantonly interfered with the prejudices of their Mussulman subjects; and the occupa tion of Gokcheh converted this discon tent into a religious frenzy. The priests began to proclaim from their pulpits the necessity for chastising the infidels ; and the Shah found that, unless the Russians evacuated Gokcheh, he had no alternative but to declare war against Russia. He received Prince Menchi koff at his summer camp at Sultaneea, but scarcely had the negotiations opened, when a long train of priests from Teheran arrived at the royal camp. It now appeared that Prince Menchikoff had no power to consent to the evacu ation of Gokcheh ; and consequently the Shah was literally forced by the popular lanaticism to break up the conference, and give the prince his passports.

The Russians were thus taken by surprise, and for some time were wholly unable to resist the onslaught of their heated and enthusiastic enemy. Abbass Mirza gained a series of successes, and was soon pushing on to Georgia; but by this time a Russian force had taken the field, and the Persians discovered that they were unable to contend against Russian artillery and discipline. It would be needless to describe the mili tary operations. It will suffice to say that, in spite of some successes of Abbass Mirza on the river Araxes, in 1827, the superior power of the Russi ans was manifest, and the inferiority of the Persians was vastly increased by the parsimonious avarice of Futteh Ali Shah. Notwithstanding the grave character of the crisis, the Shah of Persia refused to advance the funds necessary for the conduct of the war; and, indeed, threw all the charges upon the single province of Azerbaijan. Under such circumstances, disaster fol lowed disaster. The resources of the province were soon exhausted, and the Russians advanced into Azerbaijan and58 PERSIAN AFFAIRS, took possession of Tabriz. This was A. D. 1828. the crowning event of the war. Nego tiations followed, and at length the unequal contest was brought to a close in 1828, by the treaty of Turkomanchai. Under this treaty, the existing frontier was laid down, and the parsimony of the Shah was duly punished; for the Persian government was required to pay an indemnity for the expenses of the war, amounting to five millions of tomans, or more than two millions sterling. It was also agreed that all the prisoners of war made on either side, and all the subjects of either sovereign who might be in captivity in the dominions of the other power, should be liberated within a specified time.* * Watson's Persia, pp. 210-242. The Treaty of Turkomanchai will be found in the Appendix. Arrival of M. Grebaiodoff at Teheran, 1828: massacre of the Russian Mission, 1829.—The conclusion of the treaty of Turkoman- 58 chai was followed the same year by the appearance of M. Grebaiodoff at Tehe ran, as envoy extraordinary and minis ter plenipotentiary from the Emperor Nicholas to the court of Persia. The Russian envoy was received with the utmost distinction by Futteh Ali Shah; but a hostile feeling seems to have prevailed amongst the inhabitants of leheran, although no manifestation was allowed to appear. This natural feel ing was aggravated by circumstances. The Cossacks of the mission were often seen in a state of intoxication in the streets of Teheran; and M. Grebaio doff is said to have refused redress when complaints were made of the conduct of his followers. Early in the following year, he obtained his audience of leave, and was about to return to Tabriz. At this juncture aREIGN OF FUtTEH ALI SHAH. eunuch in the harem of the Shah claimed the protection of the Russian mission. He was a native of Erivan, and urged his right to return to his own country under the treaty of Turkomanchai. M, Grehaiodoff, after vainly endeavour ing to turn him from his purpose, at length gave him shelter, although by so doing he placed the Russian mission in opposition to the household of the Shah. Two days later M. Grehaiodoff claimed the surrender of two ladies in the harem of Allah Yar Khan, better known as the Ausof-ud-dowla, who had been recently degraded from the post of prime minister. It was urged that these ladies were natives of the districts ceded to Hussia, and conse quently possessed the same right as the eunuch to return to their native country under the recent treaty. The ladies were given up, but the insult must have rankled in the breast of Allah Yar Khan, who had always been an in veterate foe to the Russians. Meantime the populace of Teheran were roused to indignation at the surrender of Mussulman converts to the unbelievers; and the chief priest issued a futwa declaring that it would be lawful to rescue the Mussulman ladies from the hands of the infidel. On the morning of the 11th February 1829, the bazars of Teheran were all closed, and a great mob gathered round the house of the Prussian minister, and burst into the court-yard. M. Grebaiodoff permitted the ladies to be given up, but the mob persisted in carrying away the eunuch as well. A struggle ensued, in which a fatal shot was fired, and a citizen of Teheran was killed. The eunuch was60 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. torn to pieces by the mob, and the Cossack guard fired upon the rabble; and the populace then swarmed to the top of the house, broke down the roof, and drove the Kussian gentlemen into the court-yard, and soon dispatched them with daggers. Thirty-five Russians were massacred, and the house was plundered. The governor of Teheran and commander of the forces endeavoured to quell the disturbances, but were set at defiance by the moh, and compelled to take refuge in the citadel. The only Russian who escaped the massacre was M. Malzoff, the first secretary to the mission; but it is remarkable that although the mob carried away the horses belonging to the Russian mission, which happened to be in the stables of the British mission, all British property was rigidly respected. The Shah is said to have been filled with consternation at this unhappy event; and Khosru Mirza, a son of Abbass Mirza, the crown prince, was sent to St. Petersburg to offer reparation to the Czar. Ultimately the Emperor Nicholas accepted the assurance that the Persian government had not been in any way concerned with the lamentable occurrence which they regarded with horror; and simply required that the persons mainly con cerned in the murder should be punished; that the priest who had issued a futwa for the removal of the ladies from the house of the envoy should be punished; and that the plun- dered property should be restored. Ulti- mately Prince Dolgorouki was sent as Russian minister to Persia, and de clared that the Emperor was satisfied :* Watson's Persia, pp. 247-257. EEIGN QP FUTTEH ALI SHAH. gl and the reconciliation between the two governments was publicly announced by a parade of troops in the presence of Prince Dolgorouki and Abbass Mirza, accompanied by a royal salute of artil lery and a feu dejoie.* Refractory Chiefs of Khorassan reduced by Abbass Mirza, 1830—32.—Persia was now in a state of comparative rest. Rebel- 59 lion had been suppressed. The disastrous war against Russia had been brought to a conclusion by the treaty of Turko- monchai; and there was nothing to distract the attention of the Shah from the internal administration of his domi nions. Under such circumstances, the wild dream of extending the Persian empire to its ancient limits began to fill the imagination of the Shah and those around him. The mythical glories of the ancient empire of Darius Hystas- pis were not forgotten; nor the splen did conquests and commanding influ ence of Shah Abbass the Great. But the greatest stress was laid upon the brief and evanescent empire which had been maintained by Nadir Shah; and the territories acquired by that conqueror between 1730 and 1747 were regarded as the rightful possession of the new dynasty; although a century had passed away since any attempt had been made to enforce such dormant claims, which, according to interna tional law, are regarded as invalid after a lapse of sixty years. In accordance with these new pretensions, Abbass Mirza was appointed, in 1830, to be governor of Khorassan, and directed to establish the authority of the Shah Q62 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. A. D. 1830 to; 1832. as far as the river Oxus. * Abbass Mirza seems to have succeeded in compelling the refractory chiefs of Khorassan to return to their allegiance to the Shah. His son Khosru Mirza captured the fortress of Tarshiz, which was an effec tive blow at the turbulent confederacy. Subsequently Abbass Mirza attempted to reduce the Khan of the Kurdish tribe to submission. This Khan was one of the most powerful chiefs in Khorassan. In the first instance he opened negotiations with the crown prince, but failed to come to terms. At length Abbass Mirza advanced against his celebrated fortress of Ameerabad, and after a desperate assault succeeded in taking the place. The fall of this fortress spread consternation throughout Khoras san. The Khan of Khiva, who had advan ced against Sarrakhs, retreated on hear ing of the capture of Ameerabad. The Khan of the Kurds, however, still held out; and Abbass Mirza advanced against his last stronghold at Khabooshan, and ultimately succeeded in taking the place. The submission of the Khan was now complete. Abbass Mirza, however, deposed him from his authority, and appointed the son of the Khan to the headship of the tribe, in the room of his father, t Capture of Sarrakhs.—After these successes, Abbass Mirza determined to march against Sarrakhs.

The Salor tribe, who held the city, had not been in the habit of making marauding incursions into Persia for the purpose of plunder and capturing slaves; but they were charged by Abbass Mirza with supplying arms to other Turkoman tribes, and of receiving Persian prisoners in return, whom they either retained as slaves or sold in Khiva and Bokhara. The Chief of the tribe was named Adina Khan. When Abbass Mirza advanced against the place there were three thousand captive Shialis within the city. Abbass Mirza at once summoned the city to surrender; and Adina Khan proceeded to his camp, and offered to release the Persian cap tives on receiving back some Turkoman hostages who had been previously sent to Persia. Abbass Mirza, however, placed Adina Khan in confinement, and opened fire upon the city. The Turko mans within the walls placed their Shiah captives in such a position that they were exposed to the full effects of the firing; and Abbass Mirza accordingly suspended the cannonade. Subsequently the prince received a petition from the Shiah captives in Sarrakhs, imploring deli verance from a captivity in which they were compelled to hear the Shiah faith blasphemed, and to see their wives violated. Abbass Mirza then sent Adina Khan into the city with an ultimatum,PERSIAN AFFAIRS. that unless Sarrakhs was surrendered without conditions, and within an hour, he would storm the place. The hour elapsed, and the order was issued foi an assault, to he followed by a general massacre. The Salors fought desperately, but were at length overpowered, and a fearful carnage ensued. At last the soldiers abandoned the work of slaugh ter for that of plunder, and are said to have obtained great spoil. The Shiah captives were set at liberty and permitted to wreak their vengeance upon the slave dealers; and a hundred and fifty slave masters were literally torn to pieces by their infuriated servants. The walls of Sarrakhs were then levelled with the ground. Subsequently the chief of the Kara tribe, the last refractory leader in Khorassan, submitted to the authority of the Shah.* Failure of Abbass Mirza to extend the empire to the Oxus —After these successes, Abbass Mirza returned to Meshed. The bom bastic intention of extending the Persian empire to the river Oxus had not been realised; and the prince had not even penetrated as far as Merve. The con quest, however, was effected on paper. Five thousand prisoners of the tribe of Salor still remained in his camp, and the Khan of Khiva offered fifty thou sand tomans as ransom. Abbass IVIirza accepted the terms on the condition that he also received a paper comprising four stipulations:— 1^.—That Persian merchants proceed ing to Central Asia should be conducted as far as the Oxus by guards of the Salor tribe, 61 A.

Srd. —That they would hold no commu nications whatever with slave dealers. Mh.—That they should consent to furnish tribute and horsemen to the Shah at stated intervals. The required paper is said to have been given; but there is not a shadow of reason for supposing that the Turko mans considered themselves in any way bound by such conditions, or had the slightest intention of acknowledging the suzerainty of the Shah.* Pretensions of Persia as regards Herat — Abbass Mirza having achieved these successes in Khorassan, began to enter- 62 tain the idea of extending the empire of Persia over a part of Afghanistan. Shah Kamran, son of Mahmood Shah of Cabul, was at that time the nomi nal ruler of Herat; but the celebrat ed Yar Mahomed Khan was his minister, and in fact exercised all real authority. Accordingly Abbass Mirza invited Yar Mahomed Khan to Meshed, to settle all differences between Persia and Herat. Yar Mahomed Khan pro ceeded to Meshed, but found on his arrival that he had been drawn into a snare. Abbass Mirza informed him that the Shah of Persia was no longer at war with Russia; and that he was deter mined to assert his suzerainty over Herat. General Eerrier states that the &amp;66 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. prince drew two of Yar Mahomed Khan's teeth, in the hope of inducing him to take a favorable view of the pre tensions of the Shah. Yar Mahomed Khan, however, refused to acknowledge in any way the suzerainty of the Shah, and was ultimately permitted, on the payment of a considerable sum, to return to Herat.* A. D. 1832, * Ferrier's History of the Afghans, p, 69 Watson's Persia, p. 265. The account given by Ferrier has been adopted in the text, as wl based on independent local enquiries; whilst that of Captain Watson is apparently based on Persian authorities, whose interest it was to 1 Eeturn of Abbass Mirza to Teheran— Abbass Mirza now applied to the Shah for re inforcements, to enable him to effect 63 P retensions ot the sliah - the conquest of Herat. But Futteh Ali Shah found that his health was failing, and that his end was drawing nigh; and being anxious that his successor should be at the capital at the time of his demise, he summoned Abbass Mirza to Teheran, and directed him to leave his son, Mahomed Mirza, to conduct the war. Abbass Mirza accordingly proceeded to the capital, taking with him three of the fallen chiefs of Khorassan.f f Watson's Persia, p. 266. Atrocity committed by Mahomed Veli Mirza— Amongst the chiefs of Khorassan, who were thus conducted to Teheran, was Abdul Rezak Khan of Yezd, a chief who had rebelled against the Shah during the Russian occupation of Azerbaijan in 1827. At that time Mahomed Veli Mirza, the ex-governor of Khorassan, was prince-governor of Yezd; and Abdul Rezak Khan not only forced him to leave the city, but ill-used his family, and drove the members of his harem out of Yezd. Abdul Rezak Khan was now afraid that on reaching Teheran he might fall into the hands of Mahomed Veli Khan ; and although Abbass Mirza promised that he would intercede with the Shah for the pardon of the prisoners, the 64 %soiREIGN OP MJTTEH ALI SHAII. unhappy Abdul Eezak Khan had just cause for alarm in the known cruel disposition of Mahomed Veli Khan, and the vengeance to which he would be exposed. Accordingly he twice attempted to commit suicide on his way to Teheran, first by opium and afterwards by a dagger; but the opium did not kill him, and the dagger only wounded his hand. On reaching the capital he was brought before the Shah and severely reprimanded with the other captives; and then he was made over to Mahomed Veli Mirza, on the understand ing that, although disgraced, he was to receive no bodily injury. The ladies of the household of Mahomed Veli Mirza, who had been insulted by Abdul Rezak Khan, now clamoured for vengeance; and the prince was equally thirsting for the blood of his victim. At length Maho med Veli Mirza could restrain himself- no longer, and rushed into the apartment where the wounded Khan was beirg attended by the surgeons, and murder ed him with his own sabre. The ladies of the harem then entered the chamber and mangled the remains of the dead man, and caused them to be thrown into the public street. No censure appears to have been passed by the Shah upon the perpetrators of this atrocity.* Death of Abbass Mirza, 1833.—Abbass Mirza was now anxious to return to Khorassan; and although his health was failing, and his father was anxious that he should not leave Teheran, he ultimately proceeded to Meshed. There his illness rapidly increased, and he felt that his days were numbered. Twice every day he proceeded on foot to the shrine of Imaum lleza, but at length his last hour arrived.68 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. He died in 1833, aged forty-six, and was buried beneath the shrine ot Imaum Keza. Of all the hundred and fifty-nine sons of Futteh Ali Shah, Abbass Mirza was the favourite of his father ; and al though fickle and passionate, he is said to have been the noblest of the race ol Kajar.* Mahomed Mirza appointed crown prince and governor of Azerbaijan.—Meantime Maho med Mirza had commenced the siege of Herat; but the news of the death of his father Abbass Mirza, compelled him to raise the siege, and return with all speed to Meshed. Erom Meshed he proceeded to Teheran, where he was nominated heir to the throne by the aged Shah, and at the same time appointed gov ernor of Azerbaijan, which had so long been held by his deceased father. His two brothers, however, had so injured the province by their excessive peculations, that they were sent to the state fortress at Ardabil; and one of the two, Khosru Mirza, the same who had been ambas sador to the court of Eussia, was de prived ol eyesight as a punishment for his delinquencies. Mahomed Mirza was only twenty-eight years of age, but in consequence of his self-indulgence he was much enfeebled by gout. He was, consequently only a nominal governor. All the real authority was exercised by his vizier, Mirza Abdul Kassim, who had long served as vizier to the deceased Abbass Mirza. This individual was des tined to a still higher destiny in the future as grand vizier of Persia. He is said to have been a statesman of the highest ability. He was an able finan cier, well acquainted with the condition of every province in the kingdom, and well versed m the foreign relations ofKK10N OF FUTTEH ALl SHAH. r»9 the government of the Shah. He possessed a great power of deceiving others, and this seems to have led him to trust no one. The consequence was, that he endeavoured to perform, himself, the whole work of the administration of the province, which consequently fell greatly into arrears, and excited much discontent amongst the people of Azerbaijan.* Death of Futteh Ali Shah, Sovereign of Persia, 1834.—Futteh Ali Shah was now fast sinking into the grave; but avarice still 67 continued to be his ruling passion. His son Hassan Ali Mirza, prince-governor of Pars, saw that his father was dying, and withheld the arrears of his pro vince, which amounted to three hundred thousand tomans. Meantime the Shah was journeying towards the south, with the view of putting a stop to the rumours of his death, which were constantly cir culating. At Ispahan he halted for a while, and Hassan Ali Mirza arrived there shortly afterwards from Shiraz; but instead of bringing the six hun dred thousand tomans, the prince only brought thirteen thousand. Futteh Ali Shah boiled with rage, and not only abused his son, but ordered him to be put into confinement until certain commissioners whom he appointed had collected the arrears. This was done soon afterwards, and Hassan Ali Mirza was released. The end of Futteh Ali Shah was now fast approaching. He was compelled by fever to remain in his harem, where he was nursed by his favourite wife, whom he had raised from the condition of a dancing girl to that of ruling Sultana.

Hassan Ali Mirza had left Shiraz and reached Ispa han in time to seize all the royal trea sures and jewels which had been left in that city by the deceased Shah ; whilst the Zil-es-Sultan was in actual possession of the capital of Teheran. Each of these two princes lost no time in pro claiming himself Shah of Persia, and in preparing a military force to maintain himself in his assumed sovereignty.f Coronation of Mahomed Shah at Teheran.— Meantime Mahmood Shah was delaying at Tabriz, the capital of his province of 09 A.

The Russian representative offered to place him on the throne, by a Russian military force; but Sir John Campbell, the British envoy, who was at that time at Tabriz, had already taken such measures as to render this move ment unnecessary. The Shah was con ducted from Tabriz to Teheran by a Per sian force, under English officers, which was commanded by Sir Henry Bethune ; and on approaching the capital it was found that the rebel troops, under the Zil- es-Sultan, were rapidly deserting their leader and joining the army of the Shah. The result was that the Zil-es-Sultan made his submission, and his offence ap pears to have been condoned. Mahmood Shah was crowned at Teheran in Janu ary 1835, and the Zil-es-Sultan assisted at the ceremony.* Downfall of Hassan All Mirza.—After the co ronation of Mahmood Shah, Sir Henry Bethune marched against Hassan Ali 70 Mirza and his brother, and obtained an easy victory. Ultimately, the two rebel ' princes were taken prisoners, and sent to the state fortress of Ardabil. Hassan Ali Mirza died on the way, but his brother was deprived of eyesight, t Downfall of the Minister Mirza Abdul Kassim.— The necessary steps were now taken for the restoration of order throughout 71 Persia. The Khorassan chiefs were again in rebellion, but were reduced to submission by Prince Feridoon. There were also some serious troubles in Luris- tan and Arabistan, but they were sup pressed by Prince Behram, the prince- governor of Kermanshah, aided by Lieu tenant, now Sir Henry Rawlinson. Meantime, the minister, Mirza Abdul72 VERSIA-N AFFAIR#. Kassim, persisted in keeping ev ery branch of the administration in his own hands; and his proceedings in this respect naturally excited grave discon tent. From the first he had been morbidly jealous lest any one besides himself, or his own creatures, should have access to the Shah. He had even thrown every obstacle in the way ot the Shah's return to Teheran, although it was of the highest importance that the Shah should reach the capital with out delay. Subsequently his monopoly of the administration aroused an opposition which soon led to his removal from office. Unfortunately, a minister in Persia is either in the en joyment of full power, or in abject dis grace. llemoval from office is not follow ed by dignified retirement, but by utter destruction. Accordinsrlv when the o «/ Shah found that he could no longer sup port his minister without causing dis affection amongst his subjects, he did not merely demand the seals of state, but he ordered that Mirza Abdul Kassim, and all his sons should be put under arrest. A host of accusations then pour ed in against the fallen minister ; and the Shah was at last so convinced of his cor ruption and mal-administration that he ordered that Mirza Abdul Kassim should be strangled. This sentence was carried into execution on the 26th June 1835, within five months of the coronation of the Shah.* Hajee Mirza Aghassi appointed Minister, 1835—Meantime the post of minister had long been coveted by Allah Yar Khan, the governor of Khorassan, who was the maternal uncle of the Shah. Allah ^ ar Khan, better known as the Ausuf-4.1.1^ A. D. 1835. * Watson's Persia, pp. 288, 289. Watson's PemiPF REIGN OP MAHOMED SHAH. ^ ud-dowla, had occupied this important position in the reign of Tutteh Ali Shah, but had subsequently been dismissed from the office, and appointed to the government of Khorassan. On hearing of the arrest of Mirza Abdul Kassim he hastened from Meshed to Teheran ; but Mahomed Shah had already appointed his old tutor, Hajee Mirza Aghassi, who had acquired so much knowledge during his early travels in Arabia, as to attract the notice of the deceased Abbass Mirza. The result was that Hajee Mirza Aghassi was constantly in fear of the intrigues of the governor of Khorassan; whilst Allah Yar Khan was on his part constantly striving to upset Hajee Mirza Aghassi. It will be seen hereafter that Hajee Mirza Aghassi maintained his position as prime min ister throughout the reign of Mahomed Shah, but that his administration was as unsuccessful as that of his pre decessor. He was suspicious of foreign governments, and utterly ignorant of political economy; and in the early part of the reign of the present Shah he was sent into banishment.* Pretensions of Persia respecting Afghanistan.— During these domestic troubles the designs which the Persian government 73 had entertained during the latter part of the reign of Putteh Ali Shah, as regards the extension of the empire to the eastward, appear to have remained in abeyance. When, however, Maho. med Shah found himself fully estab lished on the throne of Persia, and had effected a change in his prime minister, he once more turned his attention to the siege of Herat, which city he would himself have captured two years pre viously, had he not been recalled by the74 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. death of his father, Abbass Mirza. The national sentiment was in strict accord ance with this ambitious line of policy. The imagination of the people of Persia, always sufficiently pretentious and arrogant, had been more inflated than ever by the successes which had attended the last campaigns of Abbass Mirza in Khorassan; and it was considered not only right, but feasible, that Persia should recover possession of Herat, and incorporate it in her own territory, with the view of prosecu ting vast and ill defined designs of conquest to the eastward. This assumed right however was utterly without foundation. According to international law, with which Persia is sufficiently familiar, and to which she has never failed to appeal when dealing with re presentatives of foreign powers, a dor mant claim to territory cannot be legal ly allowed after the lapse of sixty years. Por nearly a century, however, the terri tory of Herat had formed an integral portion of Afghanistan; and although during the struggles between the Baruk- zais and the Suddozais, the ruler of Herat had occasionally acknowledged the suze rainty of Persia, rather than that of Cabul, yet Persia had not, and could not, exercise any sovereign or territorial rights in a province held by a refrac tory vassal of the Afghan govern ment. But besides Herat, Persia put forward an arbitrary claim to Afghan territory as far to the eastward as Ghuznee; a claim which was altogether out of the question. If Persia could base any right upon the evanescent con quests of Nadir Shah, or the bygone empire of the old Suffavean sovereigns, it mustjiave extended over the whole A.

Captain Watson, however, does not state when this application to Persia was made, nor whether it was successful. of Afghanistan, and not be confined to an arbitrary portion of that territory.^ Claim of Persia to Seistan.—There was an other specific claim, which Persia put forward as regards the little territory of 74 Seistan, which also requires some expla nation. Seistan like Afghanistan had formed a part of the Persian empire of Nadir Shah; but from 1749 to 1793 it had formed a part of the Afghan empire under Ahmed Shah and his succes sor Timour Shah. Prom 1793, Seistan was entirely independent. In 1800, there were three chiefs in Seistan, viz., Baiiram Khan. Ameer Khan. Khan Jatjn Khan. Of these Bahrain Khan was the most powerful, and the other two paid him homage, but no tribute; and he assumed the title of king, and state and forms of royalty. Neither of the chiefs paid revenue or tribute either to Persia or Afghanistan. In 1834 Jellalud-deen, son of Bahram Khan, succeeded his father, but was expelled from Seistan ; but Y ar Mahomed Khan, the Herat vizier, restored him to the throne, and established the suzerainty of Herat over Seistan.f At this step the Persian go vernment considered itself aggrieved; but in reality the Shah had no claim to dominion in Seistan, beyond what was implied in a promise, given by a rival chieftain, that if the Shah would assist him in obtaining Seistan, he would acknowledge the sovereignty of Persia. I Military operations of Mahomed Shah against the Turkomans, 1836.—Having thus indi cated the nature and extent of the 75 pretensions of the Shah's government76 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. to the eastward, it becomes necessary to point out the measures unciei taken by Mahomed Shah for carrying out his aggressive policy. Having prepared an army for active service in Khorassan, Mahomed Shah took the field in 1836, ostensibly for the purpose of reducing the Turkoman tribes, who had long been independent of all constraint, and had carried on their slave hunting expedi tions against Khorassan without much check or hindrance. A division of the Persian army was accordingly detached under Prince Peridoon to attack the fortified town of Karakilla. The tribes, however, who possessed it, retired to the mountain fortress of Sooknah, and the prince vainly endeavoured to dis lodge them. Meantime the Khan of Khiva opened up communications with the Afghans of Herat, with the view of forming a combination of Usbegs and Afghans against the advance of the Persian Shiahs. The failure to dislodge the Turkomans at Sooknah imparted new courage to Yar Mahomed Khan at Herat. Shortly after the event Maho med Shah sent a summons to the Herat ruler, demanding the payment of tri bute, and that hostages should be sent to the Persian camp for the future good behaviour of the Herat govern ment. In reply, the Shah was told that Shah Kamram would make him a present, but would give him no hostages; and about the end of 1836, Mahomed Shah was compelled to return discontentedly to Teheran.* Siege of Herat, 1837-38—In 1837 Mahomed Shah once again set out for the east ward ; and then commenced that me morable siege of Herat, which lasted nine A. D. 1836, 1837. * Watson's Persia, pp. 294-297. 76'R.E1GN OF MAHOMKD SHAH. r months. The story of its defence by Yar Mahomed Khan, assisted by Lieu-, tenant Eldred Pottinger, need not be re peated here. It will suffice to say that in the spring of 1838, Mr. MacNeill, the English minister at the court of Persia, arrived in the camp of the be siegers, and endeavoured to persuade the Shah to abandon the siege; whilst; Count Simonich, the Russian envoy; extraordinary, prompted the Shah to renew his efforts for the capture of the city. At length the Shah was told that the Persian occupation of Herat, or of any portion of Afghanistan, would be regarded by Her Majesty's govern-1 ment as a hostile demonstration against i England; and that five ships of war had already arrived in the Persian Gulf,: and taken possession of the Island of; Karrack. On the 23rd June 1838, the ■ Shah made a final and desperate effort to take Herat by assault, but was successfully repelled. Ultimately in 1838 the siege was raised, Subsequenth^ on the requisition of the British govern ment, the fortress of Ghorian was restored to the Herat ruler; and in 1841 the mission under Sir John. MacNeill arrived at Teheran, and was cordially received by Mahomed Shah.j It might however be added that the Persian envoy, Hussein Khan, who had been sent to London to bring about a different result, was punished for his want of success in western diplomacy by a severe application of the bastinado.* Rising of the Ismailites under Agha Khan, 1838-39.—Meantime there was a rising of the dangerous sect of Ismailites in Kerman. This sect of fanatics hold that u78 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. the lawful successor to Imauin Jaffir, the fifth Imaum, was his son Ismail, and hence they were called by the name of Ismailites. The chiefs of this sect based their claim to spiritual power on the ground that they were descended from the last chief of the Assassins, who was popularly known as ' the old man of the mountain.'* In the early years of the reign of Eutteh Ali Shah the chief of the Ismailites resided at Yezd, and was unfortunately slain in an affray between his servants and some shop-keepers. The Shah was greatly concerned at this occurrence, as he feared lest the Ismailites should hold him responsible. The actual perpetrators had been put to death by the Ismail ites; but Eutteh Ali Shah sent for the ringleader of the disturbance, and ordered that the man should be flogged, and otherwise severely punished in his presence. Futteh Ali Shah also adopt ed the son of the murdered chief, and added considerably to the estates which the boy inherited from his father. This boy was named Agha Khan. Whilst Mahomed Shah was returning from Herat, this Agha Khan put for ward his claim to spiritual power, and took possession of Kerman. The rising speedily gathered strength, and although put down for a while, it broke out afresh in 1839. Many of the troops, sent to suppress the revolt, were followers of the sect; and consequently Agha Khan obtained three successive vic tories. At last the governor of Ker man marched against him in person at the head of a select body of troops; and Agha Khau, seeing that his defeat A.

Tbe subsequent career of tbis spiri tual ruler is somewbat remarkable. He proceeded to Western India, wbere be was employed in borse racing.* Persian aggression in Beloocliistan, 1839.-- About tbis period, the cbief of Bunpoor, in Beloocbistan, took advantage of tbe ^ rising of Agba Kban, to make fre quent inroads into tbe province of Kerman. Here it should be explained tbat in 1739, tbe wbole of Beloocbistan was bestowed by Nadir Sbab on Nasser Kban, wbo at tbe same time received tbe title of Begler Beg of Beloocbistan. Accordingly about 1839, tbe Persian go vernment renewed its pretensions to tbe suzerainty of tbe country, although no such rights had been recognised by tbe chiefs of Beloochistan for more than a century. A force was sent against Bun- poor, and the place was surrendered ; but all at once the Beloochees were roused to further action by seeing a Persian soldier attempt to carry away one of their women. The effect of this outrage upon the excited Beloochees was most remarkable. The tribesmen put their wives and daughters to death, in their fury, and then fell upon the troops to whom they had previously surrendered. A bloody conflict ensued, in which the carnage was so terrible that when tbe Shah heard of it he ordered the libera tion of all tbe surviving prisoners at Bunpoor. f Massacre of Persians at Kerbela by the Pasha of Bagdad, 1843.—About this time, and for some years previously, there had 79 been differences between Persia and80 PKRSIAN AFFAIRS, Turkey; and at length, through the influence of the representatives of Great Britain and liussia, a mixed commis sion was appointed to adjust all the points at issue. At this crisis the Pasha of Bagdad marched a force against the holy city of Kerbela, in Turkish Arabia. The political status of Kerbela is somewhat peculiar. It is the holy city of the Shiahs, inasmuch as it contains the shrine of Hussein, the son of Ali, and prophet of the Shiabs. At the same time it is really included in the Pashalik of Bagdad, and is subject to the autho rity of the Pasha. There is always a large number of Persian pilgrims resi ding in the city, and from this circum stance, and the sectarian character of the place, the authority of the Pasha of Bagdad had been for a long time almost entirely rejected. The Persian govern ment could scarcely have resented this expedition of the Turks against Kerbela, if it had been confined to a mere re-estab lishment of the rightful authority of the. Pasha. But the Turkish army, after taking the place by storm, commenc ed a wholesale slaughter of the inha bitants ; and some fifteen or eighteen thousand persons, including several hundreds of Persian subjects, were said to have perished in the massacre. The news reached Teheran whilst the people tv ere celebrating the martyrdom of Hussein, and had it been made public, the priests would no doubt have goaded the people to frenzy. Hajee Mirza Aghassi, however, kept the matter secret until the ten days of mourning for Hussein were over. Then, when the matter was spread abroad, and the people demanded vengeance, Hajee A.

EEIGN OF MAHOMED SHAH. ^1 Mirza Aghassi quieted the public mind by the ostentatious movement of troops and collection of stores ; and ultimately the atfair terminated by the Turkish government expressing its regret, and offering a suitable reparation.* Downfall of Allah Yar Khan, Governor of Khorassan.—The power of Hajee Mirza Aghassi was now at its height. Allah so Yar Khan, the governor of Khorassan, had, however, never ceased to intrigue for his own return to the office of prime minister, which he had previously held in the reign of Putteh Ali Shah; but he was wholly unable to cope with Hajee Mirza Aghassi, whose influence was paramount. At this juncture, Allah Yar Khan, however, managed to obtain from the Shah the post of custodian to the shrine of Imaum Heza at Meshed; and at the same time was allowed to transfer the government of Khorassan to his son, Mahomed Nasser Khan, who was better known as the Salar. Subsequently Allah Yar Khan was implicated in the murder of a chief of Nardeen, and was summoned to Teheran to explain his con duct. The result was that lie was ordered to reside in exile at Kerbela.f Revolt of Khorassan under the Salar.—Mean time the Salar continued to retain the government of Khorassan ; but he si secured for himself so much influence amongst the chiefs of Khorassan and the Turkomans, that he was suspected of entertaining the design of rendering him self independent. Accordingly Hamza Mirza, a brother of the Shah, was sent against him, and after a severe struir^le ^ o o compelled the Salar to take refuge amongst the Turkomans. J w82 PEKSIAN AFFAIRS. Rise of the Bab. —About this period an extraordinary fanatic began to attract notice, whose name was to occupy a 82 lasting place in the annals of Persia. This was Syud Ali Mahomed, better known as the Bab. Syud Ali Mahomed claimed to be descended from Mahomet, the prophet. His father was a grocer at Shiraz. In his youth he manifested a religious disposition, and was sent to Kerbela, where he sat at the feet of a celebrated doctor of the Mussulman law. From Kerbela he proceeded to Bushire, where he sought to acquire a saintly reputation, after the usual fashion, by the practice of religious aus terities ; and especially by exposing him self bare headed to the burning summer sun, in order to show his power over that wondrous orb which had been wor shipped by the Persians of old. This pro cess however, whilst adding largely to his spiritual intiuence, seems also to have had the effect of disordering his brain. I n the first instance he declared that he was the' Bab,' or gate by which men might attain to a knowledge of the tw elfth Imaum of the Shiahs;—the Imaum Mehdi, who is supposed to be not dead, but concealed. Subsequently heannounc- ed that ho was himself the long-expected Imaum Mehdi; and then he gave out that the prophet Mahomet had revisited the earth and appeared in his person. Finally, he reached a climax by declaring that lie was an incarnation of the Supreme Being. Meantime the fame of his doc trines and miracles spread far and wide throughout Persia, and he prepared to IciiA e Bushiie, and extend his mission to other quarters. He sent his naib, or vicegerent, to Shiraz to prepare the A. D. 1843 to 1848.REIGN OF MAHOMED SHAH. 83 A. D. 1843 to 1848, * Watson's Persia, pp. 347—351. city to receive him. The governor of Kerman, however, ordered the naib to be bastinadoed. The Bab then proceeded in person to Shiraz, and the governor of Kerman temporised, and pretended to be a convert, and finally induced him to confront the moollahs. The result was that, after one or two conferences, the moollahs declared that the Bab was mad, and suggested that he should be confined and imprisoned for life. The sentence was carried out, and the Bab was impri soned at Shiraz, and subsequently trans ferred to Tabriz, but meantime Babism spread abroad in all directions. A hot persecution was commenced; and the profession of Babism was treated as a capital offence; but belief in the Bab became only the more deeply rooted, when it was seen that his followers were ready to lay down their lives in his cause.* Tenets of the Bab.—The cause of the success of the Bab, which in the present day is assuming large proportions, opens up a 8 3 large field for speculation. Babism, however, is a natural phase in religious development, and corresponds in some measure to that of Mormonism. It is a rebellion against established forms. The Bab had not only announced himself to be God, but he had given the earth to his followers. lie denounced the res trictions of the Koran. He declared that all the possessions of his followers, in cluding iheir women, were in common. He admitted no hereditary claims to rank. He taught that good and evil had no real existence; that death was the mere transmigration of the soul84 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. from one body to another; and that , A. D. 1848. man and the earth on which he li\ed were alike everlasting. The defiance ot the Koran reached its climax when the Eah laughed to scorn the Prophet's descriptions of the black eyed virgins who welcome the believer to the pavil ions of Paradise, and the terror-striking bridge over which the unbelievers are compelled to pass, in order to enter the depths of hell.* * Wat80n ' s Persia, pp. 389, 390. Death of Mahomed Shah, 1848. —Shortly after the commencement of this extraordi nary movement, the death of the third Kajar sovereign began to draw nigh. Gout and erysipelas had broken up the constitution of Mahomed Shah, and he expired on the 4th of September 1848, in the fortieth year of his age, and fourteenth of his reign.f 1 Watson's Persia, p. 354.85 ^ns Persia, p p,|| 1 Watson 's Persia, p, &amp; A.

Disturbances on the death of Mahomed Shah.— Tlie death of Mahomed Shah was fol lowed by considerable disturbances, §5 which, however, were by no means so dangerous as on former occasions of a vacant throne. At Teheran a large body of the more influential courtiers proceeded to the camp of the British mission, and professed the warmest devotion to the new sovereign, but de clared that they would submit no longer to the authority of the minister, Hajee Mirza Aghassi. In reply Colonel X86 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Farrant, tho British repres6iitati\ g , A. D. 1848. stated that he would act in concert with the Russian representative. Prince Dolgorouki. Subsequently the two foreign ministers requested Hajee Mirza Aghassi to abstain from all interference in public affairs until the commands of the new sovereign had been received. Hajee Mirza Aghassi agreed in the first instance to remain in his own village, but afterwards returned to Teheran with twelve hundred men, and shut himself up in the citadel. Ultimately he made his escape to a neighbouring shrine; and the people of Teheran then vented their fury on his retainers. Meantime Ispahan and Shiraz were the scenes of lawless outrage. At Yezd the governor was driven into the citadel, but was com pelled by hunger to engage to leave the place, provided he was supplied with provisions and beasts of burden. The rebels complied with his request, and then he shut the gates and refused to ful fil his promise; but afterwards he found that he also had been overreached, as the rebels had poisoned the provi sions. Finally some troops arrived to his rescue, and enabled him to leave the citadel. Other rebellions took place, but the most important was that of Mahomed Xasser Khan, better known as the Salar, who again appeared in Khorassan.* * Watson's Persia, pp. 355-362. Arrival of Nasser-nd-deen Shah at Teheran.— TV hen Mahomed Shah was dying at Teheran, his son and heir-apparent, 86 asser-ud-deen Mirza, was residing at Tabriz in Azerbaijan. The young prince was only sixteen years of age, and it was expected that considerable disorders would arise in consequence of his absence from Teheran. Colonel Farrant, however, prevented much ofA.

Hajee Mirza Aghassi Khan, who had been guilty of every species of corruption, nepotism, and mal administration, was banished to the holy city of Kerbela. He was succeeded in the post by Mirza Tukee Khan, a man who is described as one of the noblest and ablest of Persian statesmen. It should however be remarked that Mirza Tukee Khan did not adopt the high title of 'Sudr Azim,' by which the prime minister or chief vizier is desig nated in Persia; but that he adopted the humbler title of ' Ameer-i-Nizam,' or Commander-in-Chief of the Persian army.f Rebellion in Khorassan, 1848-49—Meantime the rebellion in Khorassan had assumed formidable dimensions. Some of the 88 followers of Mahomed Nasser Khan, the gallant Salar, had taken sanctuary in the great mosque of Meshed, and the soldiers of Hamza Mirza, the govern or of Khorassan, endeavoured to drag them from the holy place. The priests and pilgrims at once appealed to the people to save the shrine from insult; and the result was that the people of Meshed not only drove the impious soldiers from the mosque, but devoted themselves to the cause of the Salar-88 persian affairs. Accordingly the Salar took possession of the city of Meshed, and compelled Hamza Mirza to take refuge in the citadel. All the chiefs of Khorassan, with one or two exceptions, joined the insurgents. Yar Mahomed Khan of Herat, however, was induced to come to the relief of Hamza Mirza with two thousand horsemen and a large supply of provisions, by the promise of twenty pieces of artillery and some muskets, as well as two places on the frontier of Khorassan. But the joint forces of Persia and Herat made but little pro gress, and Hamza Mirza was compelled to retire towards the Afghan frontier. Meantime Mirza Tukee Khan had sent six thousand infantry to Khorassan under the command of Sultan Murad Mirza. The force was delayed for a while by an attempt to capture Sebzewar, which was defended by a youthful son of the Salar; but the place held out, and. Sultan Murad Mirza was compelled to raise the siege, and proceed to Kuchan. Meantime the rebellion in Khorassan suffered a severe blow from the deser tion of Jaffer Kuli Khan, the chief of Boojnoord, who quarrelled with the Salar and proceeded to Teheran and paid his submission to the Shah. Sub sequently, the fort of Sebzewar sur rendered to the royal forces; but the Persian troops committed such atrocities in the town, that the people of Meshed were not likely to follow its example. Por eighteen months the royal troops continued to besiege Meshed. Mean time the Turkomans carried on their de predations throughout Khorassan with out any check or hindrance. Not a caravan could pass to Herat with safety, tv hilst the Khorassan villages were plundered far and wide. At length the A. D. 1848-1849.REIGN OF NASSER-UD-DEEN SHAH. 89 A. D. 1849-1850. citizens of Meshed were induced, by their fears of a general assault, to enter into negotiations with Sultan Murad Mirza. The result was that the city and citadel were surrendered, whilst the inhabitants were permitted to ransom their property from plunder by the payment of one hundred thousand tomans. The Salar, however, was tor tured for the purpose of compelling him to give up his treasure, and was then * Watson's Persia, pp. 367-360, 377, 378, 383, executed with the bowstring.* 384. Persia captures Bunpoor, but refuses to invade Seistan.—Whilst Khorassan was still in revolt, the chief of Bunpoor in 89 Khorassan threw off his allegiance to the Shah; and after a vain attempt to settle the difference by negotiation, a Persian force took possession of Bunpoor. About this time there were disturbances in Seistan, and the son of a deceased chieftain was put down by his uncles. Both parties applied for assistance to the Persian governor of Kerman, who considered that the mo ment was favourable for practically asserting the vague claims of Persia to the possession of the province. He accordingly proposed to invade Seistan, but the matter was rejected by the t Watson's Persia, pp. 378, 379.

The priests of Yezd, however, aroused the people against the heretics, and the Babis were overthrown and com pelled to take refuge in Kerman. There a conspiracy was formed against90 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. the life of tlie minister, but the plot was discovered, and seven of the con spirators were seized and condemned to die. Their death was accompanied by an important change in the execution of justice. It had been the previous custom for all condemned criminals to be strangled in the presence of the • n Shah; but on one occasion the Kussian minister was summoned to the presence of the Shah, whilst an execution was taking place, and he heard the cries oi the victims and encountered the dead bodies which were being carried away, and he accordingly warmly remon strated with the Shah's government against the recurrence of so barbarous a usage. It was feared, however, that a public execution in Teheran would excite a commotion, but the experiment was tried in the case of the Babi conspira tors. Each man was offered his life on the simple condition of reciting the formula of the Mussulman creed; but one and all refused, and were publicly executed at Teheran.* Obstinate insurrection of the Babis at Zinjan: execution of the Bab—The spread of Babism was by no means checked by these proceedings. In May 1850 a serious revolt broke out in Zinjan. This city is the capital of the district of Hamseh, and lies in the direct road between Teheran and Tabriz. It ap pears that the chief priest of Zinjan had embraced the tenets of the Bab, and had induced the other Babis of the place to capture a portion of the town. When the news reached Teheran a force was at once dispatched to besiege the rebels, who defended themselves withA. D. 1851. X' ersia, pp. Watson's Persia, pp. 387-392. UEIGN OF NASSER-UD-DEEN SHAH. the utmost enthusiasm. Meantime the Bab himself was taken out of his pri son at Tabriz, and condemned to be shot in the public square. A company of soldiers was drawn up and a volley fired ; but when the smoke cleared off, the Bab was gone. Strangely enough the bullets had missed his body, but cut the ropes which bound him. Those present thought he had ascended to heaven, and had he gained the bazaar he might have been safe; but unfortu nately he rushed into the guard-room, and was taken back to the square and shot dead, and his body thrown into the ditch at Tabriz. All this while the Babis at Zinjan maintained a hopeless contest against the troops of the Shah with reckless bravery; and the women fought with the same ardour as the men. The lot of those Persians who fell into the hands of the Babis was terrible in the extreme; they were shod like horses, or suspended by one arm, or burnt to death. The siege lingered on from May till the end of the year, when the leader of the Babis was slain, and the besieged lost heart. The Persian army at length carried the position, and then every man, woman and child who had survived the siege was ruthlessly butchered.* 91 Eussian occupation of Ashoradeh: capture of the Island by the Turkomans, 1851-—About this time attention was drawn to the 92 small island of Ashoradeh, off the Bay of Astrabad, which for some years had been occupied by the Russians under the following circumstances. By the treaty of Gulistan in 1813, Persia had resigned the right of maintaining92 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. ships of war in tlic Caspian ; and about 1836 the Government of the Shah applied to the Czar for naval assistance against the Turkomans on the south-eastern shore of the Caspian. Subsequently the Shah endeavoured to rectify this diplomatic error by requesting that the Eussian naval Commander might be placed under the orders of the Governor of Astrabad, or else that the naval assistance might be withheld. Later still the Shah informed the Russian minister that he had succeeded in capturing the island of Cherken, and that consequently he did not require the presence of any Russian vessels. But Russia was not prepared to relinquish the idea of maintaining the police on the Caspian; and in 1842 a Russian squadron appeared off Astrabad, and commenced putting a stop to the predatory expedi tions of the Turkoman pirates. Sub sequently the Russian officer took pos session of the small island of Ashoradeh, and converted it into a naval station. The Persian Government remonstrated in vain. The Russian minister declared in the first instance that the cruizers had been sent at the urgent application of the Shah to put an end to the piracies of the Turkomans; and that the Czar was surprised at such an open display of ingratitude as was involved in the remonstrances of the Persian minister. Subsequently Persia protested against the extensive increase of the Russian buildings on Ashoradeh; but the Rus sian envoy declined to discuss the sub ject, and thus the island of Ashoradeh has continued ever since in the posses sion of the Russians. In 1851 the island, was protected by five Russianii ^■ina A. D. 1849 to 1851. * Watson's Persia, pp. 395-397. Despatch of Captain Watson to Sir A. Alison, loth December 1864.

The officers on board the ships succeeded in making their escape, but the people on shore were either impri soned or put to death. The Eussians declared that this aggression on the part of the Turkomans had been abetted by Persia; and the Russian representative at Teheran demanded the dismissal of the governor of Mazenderan. Eor a long time the Persian Government refused to give in, but at length yielded to the demand.* Vigorous administration of Mirza Tukee Khan, 1849-1851.—It will now be necessary to glance at the progress of the administra- 93 tion under Mirza Tukee Khan. This able statesman had risen from a low station in life, and when offered the post of vizier in the beginning of 1849, he declined the more ambitious title of prime minister, and adopted the humbler designation of commander-in- chief. On assuming charge of his new duties, he found the administration in the utmost disorder, and that every evil was aggravated by the insurrection in Khorassan; but he laboured hard in the teeth of every difficulty to check the bribery and corruption which are in herent in Persian officials, to reform the army, and to restore the finances of the State. His predecessor, Hajee Mirza Aghassi, had granted pensions and dona tions with a lavish hand, without any regard to the services rendered, and which moreover could not possibly be paid; and he had thrown the odium of non-payment upon the provincial gover-94 PERSIAN affaihs. nors, who were secretly ordered not to A.

At the same time Colonels were drawing pay and receiving clothing for regiments which had no existence; and the royal body guard, which had been increased on paper to four thousand horsemen, was reduced on muster to three hundred men. Mirza Tukee Khan, however, cut down the civil expenditure and restored the army to its proper efficiency, without regard to any interests, save those of the State; and above all, he showed himself to be ut terly inaccessible to bribery. This line of conduct naturally excited great op position, and especially that of the Queen-mother; but for some time he retained the unbounded confidence of the Shah. Indeed the Shah not only refused to listen to any complaints, but gave his only sister in marriage to his trusted minister. The minister in return upheld the authority of the Shah against all aggression or interference, whether from the foreign representa tives at Teheran, or the priestly arro gance of the moollahs.* * Watson 'a Persia, pp. 364-367, 369-375, 381-383, 392-394. Fall of Jffiirza Tukee Khan, 1851. —At length however the enemies of the minister succeeded in gaining the ears of the 94 Shah. They represented his virtues and successes as so many crimes, and the young Shah at last gave ear to the numerous warnings he received that Mirza Tukee Khan was nrmfng at the possession of the throne. Aocordingly, in November 1851, Mirza Tukee 'Klin.n was informed that for the future he would only hold the post of commander- in-chief, and that Mirza Agha Khn.n was appointed to the vacant post of prime minister.

Accordingly the Shah ap pointed Mirza Tukee Khan to be gover nor of Kashan. Unfortunately the ruin of Mirza Tukee Khan was brought about by foreign interference. Prince Dolgorouky, the Russian representative, was not well-disposed towards the new minister, Mirza Agha Khan; and he^ accordingly sent the members of his mission, together with his Cossack guard, to the house of the deposed minister, and declared that Mirza Tukee Khan was under the protection of Russia. The Shah was much irritated at this insulting interference, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Rus sians ; and ordered Mirza Tukee Khan to retire in disgrace to Kashan. Prince Dolgorouky withdrew, but referred the matter to St. Petersburg; and after a few weeks openly boasted that he expected to receive a reply very shortly which would restore the for tunes of Mirza Tukee Khan.f Execution of Mirza Tukee Khan, 1852—The Shah was now fearful lest Russia should call upon him to give a gua- oo rantee that Mirza Tukee Khan should not be injured; and to escape this inter ference, he gave orders for the secret96 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. execution of the fallen minister. The A. D. 1852. matter was rendered doubly painful by the fact that the wife of Mirza Tukee Khan was the sister of the Shah, and devotedly attached to her husband. For two months the pair were permitted to live at the palace of Feen, but every day Mirza Tukee Khan was required to show himself to his guards. At first his wife used to accompany him on these occa sions ; but finding that it was a mere matter of form, she soon ceased to ap pear. On the 9th January 1852 the guards called for the ex-minister as usual, and then seized and gagged him, and carried him into an adjoining room, where certain veins were opened, and he was allowed to bleed slowly to death in ^ great agony. Meantime his young wife was told that her husband had received a dress of honour, and had gone to his bath preparatory to putting it on. When she ascertained the deception, her husband was dead. The Shah is said to have been subsequently seized with remorse, and betrothed the two infant daughters of the murdered man to two of his own sons* * Watoon . s p crsia| rp m _ m Babi conspiracy against the Shah, 1852.— From the fall of Zinjan, at the end of 1850, till the middle of 1852, but little was 97 heard of the disciples of the Bab. In August 1852, however, four Babi con spirators fell upon the Shah whilst he was riding in the neighbourhood of Teheran and attempted to assassinate him. The royal attendants immediately came to the rescue. One Babi was slain on the spot, two were captured, and the fourth escaped down a well.

Numerous other executions followed; the victims in every case re fusing to renounce tlieir faith in the Bab, although offered their lives on the simple condition of reciting the Moslem creed.* Neutrality of Persia in the Russian war, 1853-55—After this the rupture between Russia and the Western Powers began 98 to assume a grave character, and the Russian government endeavoured to induce the Shah to co-operate in the war against Turkey, on the promise that the Czar would relinquish his claim to the balance due to Eussia under the treaty of Turkomanchai, and would supply money and stores in the case of protracted hostilities. At first the Shah seemed inclined to accept the invita tion ; but his minister, Mirza Agha Khan, suggested that the combined forces of Great Britain, Prance, and Turkey were stronger than those of Russia, and that it would be more prudent to join the allies; especially as a declaration of war against Russia might enable Persia to recover the provinces which had been conquered by General Zizianoff and ceded under the treaty of Gulistan, and to escape from the crushing conditions imposed by the treaty of Turkomanchai. The Shah adopted the views of his minister, and Prince Dolgorouky was so enraged at this change of policy, which threw Persia into the arms of the allies at the moment when her cordial sup port was a matter of grave moment to the Czar, that he warmly remon strated with Mirza Agha Khan, and in his passion he flourished his cane and chanced to strike the prime minister on the leg. Mirza Agha Khan immedi- a a98 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. ately took the cane and threw it to the other end of the room, and requested the Russian representative to withdraw. Soon afterwards Prince Dolgorouky was recalled by his own government, and in consequence of this recall the pretensions of Persia in dealing with foreign ministers rapidly rose to that height of arrogance and insolence, which ultimately led to the withdrawal of the British mission.* Rupture with the British Government, 1855 — The change of policy on the part of the Shah was not followed by the expected 99 results. Proposals were indeed afloat for carrying on the war from the Asia tic side hy land and sea, that is by invading the Caucasian provinces and launching war steamers on the Caspian; and it is probable that the Shah looked forward to large subsidies from the allies, as well as to relief from treaty obligations. But the offers of Persia to join the allies were not accepted. It was felt that the Persian alliance would only enlarge the sphere of complica tions; for in the event of the war in Europe being brought to a conclusion, and Russian aggression checked on the Danube, neither Great Britain nor Prance would be in a position to protect Persia from the vengeance of Russia. Under such circumstances the British minister advised the Shah to remain neu tral. This course, however, did not at all accord with the inflated ideas of the Shah, who longed to take a part in the great struggle.f Dispute respecting Hashem Khan—At this juncture a correspondence arose respect ing the employment of a man named 100 Hashem Khan by the British mission. A. D. 1855. * Watson's Persia, pp. 410-417. t Watson's Persia, pp. 417, 418.EEIGN (XF NASSER-UD-DEEN SHAH. 99 A. D. 1855. This man had been appointed Persian secretary to the mission. Prom some unknown cause the Persian minister, Mirza Agha Khan, had entertained a violent dislike to Hashem Khan, and was anxious that he should not remain in Teheran. The minister urged that Hashem Khan had formerly been em ployed by the Shah, and had never received a formal discharge; and he sug gested that the man should be sent from the post of Persian secretary at Teheran to fill the post of British agent at Shiraz. Mr. Murray, the British repre sentative, conceded this point; as it was obviously inexpedient to employ a man as Persian secretary to the mission who was personally obnoxious to the Persian minister. Then Mirza Agha Khan unexpectedly announced that the Persian government would not permit Hashem Khan to be employed by the British mission at any place or in any capacity. To this arrogant dictation Mr. Murray could scarcely be expected to yield; especially as he had as certained that it was not customary for the Shah's servants to receive a written discharge on quitting the royal service; and Mirza Agha Khan admit ted that Hashem Khan had been told to go where he pleased. Accordingly Mr. Murray declined to submit to the interference, and Mirza Agha Khan ordered the wife of Hashem Khan to be arrested. This trivial quarrel might have been settled, as Mr. Murray offered to discharge Hashem Khan from the British service, provided the woman were restored to her husband. But it was soon evident that the Persian gov ernment wished to create a rupture, in order to seize Herat whilst Great100 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. A,IU Britain was engaged in the Crimean war. Mirza Agha Khan declared, what sub sequently turned out to be an unfounded slander, that Mr. Murray and his pre decessor had retained Hashem Khan in the service of the mission on account of his wife. The result was that in December 1855 the British mission left Teheran.* Revival of the obsolete claims of Persia to wards the east, 1855.—Meantime, whilst the Crimean war was at its height, 101 Persia was actively engaged in prose cuting claims to the eastward, and extending her influence in that direc tion. In January 1853 an agree ment had been concluded between the British minister at Teheran and the Persian prime minister, under which the Shah engaged to send no troops to Herat unless that principality were invaded by troops from Cabul or Canda- har, or from some other foreign country. In January 1856, however. Prince Sultan Murad, the governor of Kho- rassan, marched an army against Herat. He captured the fort of Ghorian, but for a long time failed to take Herat. At length the capture was effected, but meantime the Russian war was brought to a close, and in November 1856 the government of India declared against Persia, f war British expedition against Persia, 1856-57.— In December 1856 the British expedi tion arrived in the Persian Gulf, and 102 occupied the island of Karrack.

On the 26tli March Mohamra was captured. Meantime a treaty had been concluded at Paris, under which the British forces were to withdraw from Persia, and the Shah relinquished all claim to suzerainty in Herat and the countries of Afghanistan, and engaged to abstain from all inter- „m b' n'^^aS 3 ' '»• The t ' a ' y ference in their internal affairs.* General progress of affairs after the Persian war of 1856-57. —The events recorded in the foregoing Memorandum 103 have been compiled from the published works of Sir John Malcolm, General Perrier, Captain Watson, and other authorities, which have been duly stated in the margin. There is, however, no published history which brings the nar rative down to a later period than the Persian war; and it was accordingly proposed to draw up a sketch of the leading events from 1859 to 1869 from the Persian files preserved in the Poreign Department. But the incom plete state of some of the files, and the absence of the despatches received by the minister at Teheran from the Home Government, renders this portion of the task somewhat unsatisfactory; and the sketch is merely submitted as a meagre summary of affairs, which will chiefly be of use for facilitating references to the files. Disastrous expedition of Hamza Mirza against Merve, 1860-61. —The first event of importance subsequent to the 104 war of 1856-57, was the expedition of Hamza Mirza, prince governor of Khorassan, against the Turkomans of Merve. This prince had commanded the expedition against Herat in 1856, B 2102 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. and was now ordered by the Shah to undertake the reduction of Merve. Preparations on a great scale were made at Meshed and Sarrakhs, and in June 1860 the force advanced from Sarrakhs to Merve; hut at the latter place was utterly defeated by the Turkomans. The horrors which followed were almost beyond description. Numbers of Per sians were slain, or carried away captive, during the retreat through the desert; and the army degenerated into a mere rabble of stragglers, whilst the prince himself made a narrow escape into Herat. In Pebruary 1861 Hamza was brought to Teheran in disgrace, and Sultan Murad Mirza was appointed governor of Khorassan in his room. Famine at Teheran, 1861.— In March and April 1861 there was a great scarcity of grain at Teheran, and the people 105 were almost driven to insurrection from want of bread. On the 2nd of March a crowd of famished wretches beset the residence of the Shah, and were only appeased by the public execution of the Chief Magistrates, and distribu tion of wheat from the royal granaries, feome days afterwards, a crowd of vi omen foiced their way into the mosque whilst the chief priest was at prayers, and dragged out the holy man, and compelled him to ask the Shah for a further distribution of bread; whilst another crowd gathered round the house of the British mission, and called upon Mi. Alison, the minister, to represent their distresses to the Shah. The famine would scarcely have been felt had there been any cart roads. For there was a superabundant supply of wheat in A.

Fears of Persia respecting Dost Maho med Khan, ISB'i-es.—In 1862 the fears of Persia were excited by the advance 106 of Dost Mahomed Khan against Pnrrah, for the purpose of punishing Sultan Ahmed Khan of Herat. The consolidation of Afghanistan under one ruler had always been opposed to the policy of Persia, who could not forget wiiat she had suffered from the Afghans in the early part of the eighteenth century; and if Dost Mahomed Khan added Herat to his dominions, which already included Cabul and Candahar, it was believed that every Turkoman and wild horseman, far and near, Avould flock to his standard, and that the whole of Khorassan would soon fall into his hands. Persia urged that Great Britain was bound by the treaty of 1857 to interfere, whilst Dost Maho med Khan declared that Persia was to blame for having broken the treaty by permitting Sultan Ahmed Khan to coin money and read the khotbah in the name of the Shah. Meantime the wildest rumours were afloat. It was said that Dost Mahomed Khan was instigated by Great Britain, and that the Christians were about to form an alliance with the Soonnees for the over throw of the Shiahs. The capture of Herat, and subsequent death of Dost Mahomed Khan in 1863, seem to have allayed the fears of the government of the Shah.104 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Troubles in Astrabad, 1862-63. Mean time the city of Astrabad and the sur rounding villages were harassed by the constant raids of the Yomut Turko mans; and in 1863 the incursions increased in consequence of the ap pointment of a youth of fourteen years of age, brother of the Shah's favorite attendant, to be governor of the province. Persecution of the Nestorian Christians, 1863-65.—About this time the attention of the British Government was drawn 107 to the persecution of the Nestorian Christians of Oroomiah. These people numbered about thirty thousand, and were all cultivators of the soil, except ing about a hundred families, who were employed as carpenters, masons, and dyers. Their landlords, known as the Afshar Chiefs, were Mussulmans, and exercised oppression over their Christian ryots in a variety of ways, such as forced labor, general ill-usage, heavy exactions in the form of poll tax, extortion of presents at weddings and feasts, demands for provisions for a chief and his attendants durin 0 * a journey, with seduction and outrage of every kind. Mussulman ryots were pro tected from many of these proceedings by virtue of their religion; and more- ovei theii evidence was taken in a court of justice, which was refused in the case of Christians. For some years Dr. Perkins and other American mis sionaries had labored amongst these people, and endeavoured to elevate their moral standard; but their efforts seem ed to excite the wrath of the land lords, and aggravated the sufferings of A.

Such a proceeding would have been naturally obnoxious to the Persian Government; for those Nes- torians who leaned towards the Latin Church might claim the protection of France, whilst those who inclined to the Greek Church would look to the pro tection of Russia. After some measures of relief, more or less effectual, the Shah was ultimately induced to settle the affairs of the Nestorians on a permanent and satisfactory basis, by appointing a Christian officer to preside over their affairs under the Persian Governor of Oroomiah. At the same time a quarrel which had broken out amongst the Nestorians themselves was brought to an end. The Nestorians who had been patronised by the Catholics had obtained possession of a church which belonged to the Nestorians who had been patro nised by the Protestants; and the Shah liberally settled the dispute by leaving the Catholics in possession of the church, and granting a piece of ground to the Protestants on which to build a new church. His Majesty also head ed a subscription list for the cost of building with a donation of £100. Up to this time it had been the policy of the Mussulman powers to play off the rival Christian sects against each other; but Mr. Alison, the British minister, took the opportunity to induce the ministers of Prance, Eussia, and Turkey to form a common bond of alliance, so far as to join in the subscription which was headed by the Shah. c 2106 persian affairs. Renewed troubles in Astrabad: Per- A. D. 1864-1865. sian victory over the Turkomans, 1864-65.— Meantime the city of Astra- ios bad and the adjacent villages were incessantly harassed by the incursions of the Turkomans. These nomades originally occupied the vast steppes which stretch from the north of the Attrek river almost to the frontiers of Khiva; and of late years had gra dually extended their wanderings to the southward until they reached the fertile plain which is watered by the Goorgan river. Henceforth the town of Astra- bad, which is situated within a few miles of the Goorgan river, has been at the mercy of these marauders, who have been in the constant habit of carrying off loads of rice, cattle and beasts of bur den, men and women as slaves, and the heads, hands and ears of those whom they killed. The people were often reduced to beggary by bands of Turko man robbers, or, what was worse still, were carried away into hopeless cap tivity ; for none but the rich could afford to pay a ransom. Prom time to time the Shah had sent expeditions against these tribes, but without effect- ing any permanent result. In 1864, however, a Persian force was sent against the Gohlen and Yomut Turko mans, and was said to have gained a signal victory, in which five hundred families, tw o thousand camels, and forty thousand sheep fell into the hands of the Persians. The submission of the enemy was said to be complete. All Persian captives who had been taken by the Turkomans were given up;REIGN OF NASSER-UD-DEEN SHAH. arrears of tribute were paid up; and two forts were destroyed. Dispute between Turkey and Persia, 1864-65—In 1863 the construction of telegraphic lines of communication com- ] menced in Persia, and was accompanied by protracted negotiations as regards territorial rights, which need scarcely be narrated here. A dispute however between Turkey and Persia, respecting the point of junction between the lines belonging to the respective terri tories, seemed at one time likely to lead to hostilities. The question was at length settled as regards the telegraph, without reference to any territorial rights, which were reserved for future settlement by a commission. In 1865 the unsettled state of affairs on the Turko-Persian frontier was aggravated by a conflict between Nanuk Pasha, Governor General of Bagdad, and a small Turko-Kurdish tribe, called the Hemavend. This tribe of the Hema- vend numbered only two hundred and fifty families, but in consequence of their marauding habits were attacked by the Ottoman troops and driven into Persian territory. Here they were joined by free lances from the tribes on the border, Turkish as well as Persian, and committed extensive depredations in Saleimanick and Kerkook, not with out suspicion of acting with the con nivance of the local Persian authori ties. Ultimately, however, the Persian Government co-operated with the Turk ish force in reducing this turbulent tribe, and the Hemavend were then speedily reduced to submission.108 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Disturbances at Shiraz, 1865.—In July 1865 a disturbance broke out in Shiraz, in consequence, it was said, of the no action of the Persian authorities, who had bought up all the corn, and were re-selling it at an advanced price, to the great distress of the poorer classes. On the morning of the 17th J uly, a crowd of women folded up their veils around their heads and proceeded to the Tele graph Office, and requested the officials to complain to the Shah of the proceed ings of the local authorities. The tele graph officials informed the Governor of Shiraz of what was taking place, and the latter sent his furashes to drive the women away; but all at once the bazaars were closed, and the people broke out into open insurrection ; whilst the women roundly abused the tele graph officials and tore down some of the wires. These proceedings being reported to the Shah, the Governor was removed, and the rising was quelled, but not until after some of the crowd had been killed and many wounded. Visit of the Shah to the Russian fleet on theCaspian, 1866.—In April 1866 the Shah proceeded to Mazanderan for the m purpose of seeing some Russian ships of war, and there he was entertained with a naval review on the Caspian, and distributed decorations amongst the Russian officers. This expedition how ever aggravated the scarcity already existing at Teheran, and several tumults broke out, which so alarmed the mother of the Shah that she telegraphed him to return, and opened the royal granaries to the public. In J UU e the Shah returned to his capital.REIGN OF NASSER-UD-DEEN SHAH. 109 Outrages against the Jews at Barfourish, 1865—In May 1865 a disturbance bVoke out in the town of Burfourish on the 112 Caspian. A Syud bad sent bis daughter to a Jewisb dealer in tbe bazaar, either to return some clothes, or to pro cure a reduction of the price. The girl was in delicate health, and was said to have been struck by the Jew on the mouth; and shortly after her return from the bazaar she suddenly expired. This event occurred during the Mohur- rum, and tbe rumour spread amongst the excited Shiah population that the girl had been outraged and murdered by the Jews. The people turned out in crowds, and immediately attacked and plundered the Jewish quarter, and gave the Jews the simple alternative of death or Islam. Some of the wretched crea tures embraced the Mussulman creed, whilst others fled into the woods, where they must have experienced terrible pri vations. The matter was a difficult one to be dealt with by the Persian Govern ment, but orders were ultimately issued that any Jew who had been forcibly converted might return to his original faith. Expedition of the Shah to Meshed, 1867 —In April 1867 the Shah left Teheran and proceeded to Meshed, ac- companied by the Queen-mother and all the ladies of the royal anderoon. The avowed object was a pilgrimage to the holy shrine; but it was supposed that the Shah was desirous of acquaint ing himself with the actual state of affairs on the Khorassan frontier, and especially with the course of events in Afghanistan. He arrived at Meshed D 2110 PERSIAN AFFAIRS. on the 17th June, and two days later A. D. 1867. the Prince Governor of Meshed died suddenly of a stroke of apoplexy. In August, Mahomed Yakoob Khan, the son of Shere Ali Khan and ruler of Herat, visited Meshed, and was present ed to the Shah; but subsequently expressed disappointment at the result of his visit. On the 23rd September the Shah returned to Teheran. Successful expedition against the Yomut Turkomans, 1867.—Whilst the Shah was absent in Khorassan, the iu Yomut Turkomans in the neighbour hood of Astrabad began to renew their plundering raids. The Persian Gover nor of Astrabad showed no energy in suppressing the marauders; and the minister of finance, who had been left at Teheran to direct affairs in the absence of the Shah, was unable to undertake active operations. A force, however, was detached from the Shah's own camp, and an expedition was dis patched from Boojnoord under the com mand of Hyder Kuli Khan, the Chief of Boojnoord. In August the news reached Teheran that the Persians had gained an important victory over the T urkomans, and carried away three bundled heads, for each of which the Persian Government gives five tomans, together with two thousand prisoners and an immense booty. The Persian force subsequently returned to the camp of the Shah, and the heads of the slain were placed on spears, and paraded with the prisoners in the presence of the Shah and his ministers. Mr. Thomson was present in the royal camp and describes the painful scene. AmongstREIGN OF NASSER-UD-DEEN SHAFT. Ill the prisoners were six hundred women and children, who reached the camp ex hausted with the fatigues and sufferings of the march; whilst many of the female prisoners were half naked, and had been brutally ill-treated by their captors. Mr. Thomson learnt that the Shah, in his exasperation at the outrages committed by the Turkomans, had ordered that all the male prisoners, many of whom were mere children, should be put to death. Mr. Thomson however remonstrated with the Booj- noord Chief, who had commanded the expedition, against putting such pri soners to death in cold blood. Ulti mately the Shah was induced to spare the lives of the children, but eleven of the adults were decapitated in front of His Majesty's tents, and their bodies dragged through the camp. Difficulties with the Imaum of Muscat as regards Bunder Abbass, 1868.— In April 1868 the Persian Government 115 represented to Mr. Alison, that the Imaum of Muscat had manifested so much delay in meeting his money pay ments under which he had farmed the port of Bunder Abbass, that the Shah had been induced to cancel the lease which had been concluded in 1856. In return the Muscat Arabs had subjected Persian traders in the Gulf to much wrong and violence • and the Persian Government was anxious that the Bri tish Government should remonstrate with the Imaum and furnish the Shah with a naval force for maintaining the peace in the Gulf It will be unneces sary to reproduce the voluminous nego tiations which followed. It will suffice112 PERSIAN AFFAIRS, to say that in August 1868 a new lease of Bunder Abbass was granted by the Shah to the Imaum, under which the yearly rent was raised from 16,000 tomans, which had been fixed by the lease of 1856, to the advanced rate of 30,000 tomans. In other respects the old lease was unaltered. Miscellaneous negotiations. —In addi tion to the events recorded above, several negotiations have been carried hg on by the British Government with the Shah, which still remain unset tled, and respecting which no new facts have been brought forward on either side. Amongst these may be mentioned the claims of Persia to Bahrein and Angaum, and her assumed rights over Seistan. The latter question, however, will be found fully discussed in the supplementary note.

Object and scope of the present Supplementary Note.-— Division of the border country into three regions. Object and scope of the present Supplementary- Note.—The previous memorandum on Persian affairs was intended to exhibit i the general progress of events in that kingdom, with perhaps special refer ence to the eastern frontier. The pre sent supplementary note is intended to exhibit the general progress of affairs in the border country, which separates Persia from Khiva, Bokhara, and Af ghanistan; with the view of illustrat ing, as far as may be, the political relations which have subsisted between the tribes who occupy this debatable territory and the states around them. Division of the border country into three re gions.—The border or debatable country between Persia and Afghanistan may be 2 generally described as a desert region, with large patches of cultivation inha bited by nomades. This country may be divided for the sake of clearness into three distinct regions :— 1st. —The northern region of Turko- mania, or the land of the Turkomans, with the neigh bouring states of Khiva and Bokhara. E 2&gt;11-i TURKOMANS, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. 2nd. —Tlie central region of Herat, and the tribes of Eimaks, Huzaras and others, generally known by the collective name of the Char Eimaks. 3rd. —The southern region, comprising Seistan, and the other terri tories of Beloochistan.115 CHAPTER I.

Description of the Turkomans.— Turkomania, or the land of the Turkomans, may be said to extend along the north and north- 3 eastern boundary of the modern pro vince of Khorassan from the Caspian to116 TURKOMANS, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. the river Murgab. The Turkomans thus occupy the territory which inter venes between Persia on one side, and Khiva, Bokhara and Afghan-Turkistan on the other. They belong to the Tartar, or Turkee race, and are only to be distinguished from the Usbegs from the fact of their being nomades of the desert, whilst the Usbegs are dwellers in villages or towns. The Turkomans are a robber people, who scour the desert as pirates scour the seas, and not only plunder the passing caravans, but occa sionally make bold descents upon Persian territory, and carry off the peaceful inha bitants to be sold as slaves in the markets of Khiva and Bokhara. From time immemorial they appear to have moved about in their felt-covered tents, encamp ing with their admirable horses wherever there is a fertile and well-watered soil. From these camps they occasionally emerge upon their trained steeds to make a raid into the surrounding country, and sweep down like a whirlwind upon a village or caravan. Their work is soon over. Every species of property, and every man, woman or child worth carry ing away, are hurried olf to the desert; the more valuable booty, such as Per sian girls, being placed on the horses, whilst brothers, mothers or fathers are fastened by a long rope to the saddle bow, and compelled by the prick of a lance, or fear of immediate death, to drag on as they best can. The social condition of these nomades has been described at considerable length by Ferrier, \ambery, and other travellers, and requires but little notice here' It will suffice to say that they per- form the duties of hospitality, butNORTHERN REGION:—TURKOMANIA. 117 otherwise have but little sense of right or wrong, and are wholly absorbed in the acquisition of money. They are pitiless and utterly callous, and appear to love their horses far above their wives. Indeed, so long as the wife takes care of the tent, and looks after the crops and flocks, she is allowed considerable license; and consequently the ladies are not distinguished for severity of manners, either towards strangers or their own slaves. The Turkomans gene rally are bigoted Sunnees, and excuse their outrages against the Persians on the ground that the latter are heretical Shiahs. They have no government, beyond a certain respect which is paid to 'greybeards;' but they are held together by the bondage of ' Deb' or custom, and to some extent by the * Burnes, Abbott, Ferrier, Vambery, &amp;c. influence of religion.^ Kine tribes of Turkomans.—According to Mr. Vambery there are nine tribes of Turkomans, which are again sub-divided 4 into branches and classes. These nine tribes, and the territories they occupy, may be indicated as follows :— 1. C haudok ... between the Caspian and Aral 2. E esari ... on the left bank of the Oxus from Chardjui to Balkh; they are tributaries to the Ameer of Bokhara 3. A lieli ... at Andkho 4. K aea ... between Andkho and Merve 5. Saloe ... the oldest Turkoman tribe recorded in history. Prior to 1855 they were in possession of Merve, but have since been supplanted by the Tekke 6.

Y omut ... are in two branches:— (1) the Gorghan Yomuts on the eastern shore of the Caspian; (2) the Khiva Yomuts close to the Oxus* * Vambery 's Central Asia, pp. Five tribes demanding 1 special notice.—Of all these tribes only five require special notice in the present memorandum, 5 namely:— 1.—The Ersari on the left bank of the Oxus. 2.—The Salor of Merve and Sarakhs. 3.—The Sarik on the Murgab. 4.—The Tekke, who have supplanted the Salor at Merve. 5.—Yomuts of Khiva, who have taken an important part in recent revolutions in Khiva territory. Political condition of the Turkomans.—The po litical relations of these tribes with the neighbouring states will now be con- e sidered by the light of all available detail. It must however be confessed that the annals of shifting encamp ments, the stories of fray and outrage, and the degraded lives of men-stealers and slave-dealers, furnish but little data that can be made available for real his tory ; whilst they are wholly wanting in those touches of sentiment and chivalry which ennoble even the barbarous chieftain who fights for honour and glory, and who does not steal men and women for the mere purposes of trade. Indeed the Turkomans can scarcely be said to have a history. Their lives are the same century after century; and will continue so until brought under settled rule, and compelled to abandonNORTHERN REGION :—TURKOMANIA. 119 A. D. 1600. their predatory and slave-stealing avo cations. At occasional intervals, liow- ever, they have been coerced into some sort of allegiance to Khiva or Bokhara; and at distant periods, when Persia has been ruled by a potentate like Shah Abbass the Great in the sixteenth century, or like Nadir Shah in the eighteenth century, they have been taught to respect the Persian frontier. But for more than a century they have been a scourge and a terror to every village within reach of their marauding bands, and to every caravan of merchants or pilgrims that attempted to make its way from the Persian city of Meshed to the remote capitals of Balkh or Bokhara. Kurd settlement established by Shah Abbass on the Khorassan frontier about 1600.—Shah Abbass the Great was the first sovereign 7 of Persia who appears in modern times to have shown a far-seeing policy in dealing with the Turkomans. The main object which he kept in view was not the establishment of a formal suze rainty over these predatory tribes, but the maintenance of a barrier which should protect the Khorassan frontier against their plundering and slave-steal ing inroads. Accordingly, he attempted to establish a permanent and hostile bulwark against the Turkomans, by adopting the old Asiatic system, which dates back from times primeval, of transplanting a warlike and trouble some people from a distant quarter of his empire to the eastern frontier, for the purpose of defending the provinces in which they were settled as strangers. With this view he transplanted several thousand families from the mountains120 TURKOMANS, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. of Kurdistan, in the western frontier of liis dominions, to the northward of the province of Khorassan, between Astrahad and Meshed, with orders to guard the frontier in that direction against the ingress of the Turkomans. This settlement of Kurds in Khorassan seems to have tranquillised the border during the life of Shah Abbass, and perhaps as long as the Suffavean dynasty lasted; but there was subsequently a change in the relative condition of the tribes, which rendered the policy of Shah Abbass of no effect, and which consequently requires special considera tion.* Connivance of the Kurd Chiefs with the depre dations of the Turkomans, 1747.—The suc cess of the transplantation policy of 8 Shah Abbass mainly depended on the continuance of an antagonism between the Kurds and Turkomans based upon a conflict of interests; for so long as Kurds and Turkomans regarded each other as mortal enemies, so long tran quillity would be maintained upon the Khorassan frontier by the mere force of mutual fear. But during the wars and distractions which followed the down fall of the Suffavean dynasty, the Per sian Government was scarcely able to maintain its hold upon the western provinces, and was wholly unable to pay any attention to its eastern border, ^sadir Shah for a brief period re-estab lished the supremacy of Persia in that direction; inasmuch as he virtually fixed his capital at Meshed. But after his death in 1747, when Zend and Kajar were fighting against each other, or amongst themselves, for the possession A. D. 1747. seq. The * Ferricr's Caravan Journeys, p. 83 et policy of Shah Abbass was identical with that pur sued by Assyria twenty-five centuries previously, when the latter power transplanted the troublesome people of the ten tribes of Israel to the cities of the Medes on her eastern frontier,NORTHERN REGION :—TURKOMANIA. 121 * Fwrier'!

In consequence of this understanding the Kurdish chiefs on the border ceased altogether to interfere with the expedi tions of the Turkomans ; and it appears to have been the rule that the Kurds who were charged with the defence of the frontier districts, received a portion of the booty from the Turkomans, on condition of leaving the passes open, or keeping out of the way at the moment * Ferrier's Caravan Journeys, p. 86 et seq. Qj[? fray * History of Khorassan under the descendants of Nadir Shah, 1747-1802.—The political status of the Turkomans during the past century may be best gathered from a brief review of the progress of affairs in Khorassan. Por many years after the death of Nadir Shah, Khorassan was in a state of anarchy. Nominally, it was governed by his grandson Shah Hukh, under the suzerainty of Afghanistan; but the authority of Shah Hukh was confined to Meshed and its immediate neighbourhood, and the chiefs of Kho rassan were virtually independent; whilst the ruler of Afghanistan, Ahmed Shah Abdallee, was far too much occupied with his designs against the fertile territories of the Punjab and Hindustan, to pay much attention to the remote tribes of the desert so far to the northward. At this period the g 212£ TURKOMANS,, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. most powerful chiefs of Khorassan were those of Nishapore, Tubbus, Kayn, Turshiz, Turbut-i-Nyderee, Subzawar, Kabushan, Ohinnaran, and Merve. These chiefs lived in fortified towns, and drew a revenue from grain and cattle ; but they were constantly exposed to the attacks of Turkomans or Usbegs, against whom they were occasionally assisted by the Afghan Government. Indeed, from the death of Nadir Shah to the coronation of Agha Mahomed Khan in 1796, the Turkoman tribes ex tended their inroads into the interior of Persia, and troops of Turkoman horse men occasionally ventured within sight of Ispahan. Agha Mahomed Khan dethroned Shah Kukh, but permitted Nadir Mirza, the son of Shah Rukh, to continue to govern Meshed; and-*it was not until 1802 that the dynasty of Nadir Shah was brought to a close, and Meshed was nominally brought under Persian rule.* History of Khorassan under Persian prince gov ernors, 1802-1818.—The subsequent his- tory of Khorassan under the prince io governors of Meshed, who ruled or attempted to rule the province after the downfall of the dynasty of Nadir Shah, may be best gathered from the following table :— P rince G overnoiis of M eshed. 1.— m ahomed v eli M ieza. :buled about: This prince governor treacherously put to death Isaak Khan, the chief of Turbut-i-Nyderee in open durbar, and was consequently recalled by the Shah 1802-1814 H assan A li M ieza.

Abbass Mirza reduced the Kurd chiefs to a temporary submission, and appears for a short time to have taken posses sion of the Turkoman city of Sarrakhs; but after his death, in 1833, the sub mission of the Kurds was only nominal, and they frequently joined the Turko mans in their depredations 1830-1833 4.—Allah Yae Khan, known as the Au- suf-tjd-dowla.

The Gene ral observes that from the death of Abbass Mirza in 1833 to the year 1845, when he himself travelled through the country, the submission of the Kurds was only nominal, and they frequently joined the Turkomans in their depreda tions. Occasionally a force of militia was sent against the Turkomans, on which they retired into the desert; and the Persian soldiers contented them selves with plundering the Turkoman124 TURKOMANS^ CHAR E1MAKS, AND SE1STAN. camp, and carrying away such women and children as they could capture as hostages. When the Persian force had retired, the Turkomans renewed their raids; and if they cared to recover their wives and children, they could easily do so by surrendering a part of the spoil to the border chief who was supposed to guard the frontier. General Perrier recommended that the defiles should be held by regular troops, and added that the passes were so well guarded by nature that a small force would suffice for the purpose.^ History of the Turkomans.—It will now be necessary to review, as far as may be, the progress of affairs amongst the five 12 tribes of Turkomans already mentioned, namely, the Ersari, the Salor, the Sarik, the Tekke, and the Yomuts. For the sake of clearness it may be as well to premise that the Ersari are tributary to Bokhara; that the history of the Salor, Sarik and Tekke is chiefly connected with that of the two famous Turkoman cities, known as Merve and Sarrakhs ; and that the history of the Yomut is chiefly connected with that of Khiva. The Ersari Turkomans on the Oxus, between Chardjui and Balkh.—The Ersari Turko mans on the left bank of the Oxus, 13 between Chardjui and Balkh, call for little special remark, beyond the bare statement that in the present day they are tributary to the Ameer of Bokhara. Captain Conolly, however, in the manu script journal of his route from Herat to Merve, furnishes a curious account of the wanderings of a branch of these Ersari Turkomans, which is of consider- able value, inasmuch as it illustrates A.

Migration of a branch of Ersaris to Murgab: pay allegiance to the Jamsheedhis,—At some date wholly unknown, excepting 14 that it must have been prior to 1820, a branch of the Ersari Turkomans on the Oxus left their usual haunts, and migrat ed towards the south-west, and ulti mately settled in the district known as Pinjdeh, on the upper course of the river Murgab. There the new arrivals found themselves in the immediate neighbour hood of two powerful tribes, the Jam sheedhis and Huzaras of the Hindu Kush, who belong to the Char Eimaks, and occupy the second or central re gion of the border country.^ In the first instance the Ersaris paid allegiance, and perhaps some kind of tribute, to the chiefs of the Jamsheedhis, who were at that time more powerful than the Huzaras; and in return for this payment they enjoyed the privilege of using the valuable pasturable and agricultural resources of the district of Pinjdeh. f Ersaris transfer their allegiance from the Jam sheedhis to the Huzaras.—This state of af fairs continued for an unknown number 15 of years, but about 1820 the neighbour ing Huzaras began to assert a superior ity over the Jamsheedhis; and the Ersari colony was consequently induced to transfer its allegiance from the Jamsheedbis to the Huzaras. Subse quently, however, the Huzara chief exacted more than his due, and the Ersari Turkomans therefore marched h 2126 TURKOMANS^ CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. away towards their original homes on the Oxus; but they were closely followed by Rustum Khan, the chief of Shibar- gham, who hoped to persuade them to settle in his territory. The Ersaris declined his invitation; whereupon Eustum Khan fell upon their encamp ment, and carried away many of their sheep and camels.* Transfer allegiance to Bokhara, then to Khiva, and finally to Bokhara.—The Ersaris then prayed to the Ameer of Bokhara for 16 protection and redress, and he sent an army against Rustum Khan; but Miz- rab Khan, the chief of Maimana, in terfered, and the Bokhara commander deemed it expedient to withdraw, on the condition that he should be allowed to carry away as many sheep and camels as would save his military reputation and the dignity of the Ameer. The Ersaris now saw that they could expect nothing from the ruler of Bokhara; and accordingly they listened to the pro posals of Rustum Khan, and settled in the neighbourhood of Shibargham. Subsequently war broke out between Shibargham and Siripool, and the Ersaris found that many of their cattle were carried off by the Siripoolees, and they consequently moved out of Shibar gham into the territory of Maimana. There however they suffered from the exactions of Mizrab Khan, the chief of Maimana, and accordingly marched away to their old quarters at Pinjdeh on the Murgab. But here their former troubles were renewed. The Huzara chief repeated the oppressions which had previously driven them from Pinj deh ; and the Ersaris, having had latal experience of the weakness of Bokhara A- D- 1820 to 1840.

The Khan appears to have listened to their prayer, and put a stop to the extortions practised by the Huzaras, and merely levied a moderate duty from the Ersaris in return for his protection. After Captain Conolly's visit in 1840 the Ersaris seem to have returned to their old homes on the Oxus, and to have again paid allegiance * Conolly's Journal, MS.; Vambery's Travels, to the Ameer of Bokhara.* p. 303.

Turkomans is in like manner one of 17 migrations. In the present day, or rather in 1863, when Mr. Vambery travelled in Central Asia, these tribes were located on the river Murgab, in the neighbourhood of Pinjdeh, where the Ersari Turkomans had been located some quarter of a century before. But prior to 1855 the Sarik Turkomans were chiefly in possession of the ancient city of Merve, whilst the Salor Turkomans I 5 were in possession of the city of Sar- raklis; and it was chiefly from these localities that the Turkomans issued forth to pillage the caravans between Persia and Bokhara, or to carry out their plundering and kidnapping operations on the Persian border. Ac cordingly it may be advisable to glance at the history of these two famous cities of Merve and Sarrakhs, and at the revolutions which led to the migration of the Sarik and Salor Turkomans to the upper course of the Murgab. Neither city has been much visited by Euro peans. Captain Burnes passed through128 TURKOMANS^ CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN, the neighbourhood of Merve in 1832, but does not appear to have even obtained a distinct view of the place, for he furnishes neither a history nor a description. In 1839-40, however, both Colonel Abbott and subsequently Cap tain Conolly visited Merve en route to Khiva, and have left some curious in formation respecting the locality. Again, about 1833, Caj^tain Burnes resided some days at Sarrakhs disguised as an Afghan; but the place was never reached by Abbott or Conolly. In later times neither General Ferrier nor Mr. Vam- bery attempted to visit either Merve or Sarrakhs. Indeed death or hopeless slavery Vould have almost been certain, whatever might have been the disguise adopted.* History of old and new Merve.— The old town of Merve was one of the most ancient cities in Asia. It was situated is in a plain, and watered by a canal from the Murgab. It was founded by the old fire worshippers, and the remains of their fort are yet to be seen in the neigh bourhood. In the glorious days of the Suffavean dynasty, the city of old Merve was included in the Persian em pire, which extended at this period to the banks of the Oxus. It must, how ever, have been always exposed to the attacks of Usbegs and Turkomans, and perhaps has changed masters as often as any city in the world. The new city of Merve is said to have been founded bv ^adir Shah. During the oiVil T ' i • i « n , s 6 C1V1 * wars winch followed the death of that adven turer, new Merve belonged either to the urkomans, or to one or other of the neighbouring principalities. Ultimatelv it seems to have been held by the Ameer A D 1855. » Burtie's Bokhara, Vol. 11, pp. 23-37 49.66 • nal MS Nurrative ' Chaps - 11 and 111 ' Conolly' 8 Jour!northern region :—turkomania. 129 A. D, 1840. - ol Bokhara; but during the decline of the power of Bokhara, that is, during the reign of Haider Turrah, it was captured by the Khan of Khiva, and formed one of the most important districts in that principality. Mean time the ancient dam of the Murgab was neglected and carried away, and the old city became uninhabitable and was abandoned. Subsequently the dam was again set up, and the lands brought once more under cultivation; but the ancient site continued to be a deserted ruin, whilst the new town grew up. In 1840 this new town was merely an as semblage of about a hundred mud huts, but a large and important bazaar was held there, and became the most con siderable mart in a circuit of several * Abbott's Journey from Herat to Khiva, Vol. I, hundred miles.* In 1855, as will be p. 47 , Vol. ii, p. 321. seen hereafter, the city of Merve was inhabited by twenty thousand families of the Sarik, Tekke, and Yomut tribes of the Turkomans. * Burne' tin Captain Conolly's description of Merve, 1840'— As regards the social condition of Merve, a graphic description is fur-19 nished by Captain Conolly in the manuscript journal already' quoted. The governor of Merve, who appears to have been appointed by the Khan of Khiva, was a mere savage of the desert. When Captain Conolly was visiting him, a party of Tekke Turko mans unceremoniously entered the courtyard, bearing three blackened human skulls upon the points of their lances, and leading thirty bound Per sians whom they had captured at Khelat-i-Nadir, together with thirty-six horses. These bandits reported the success of their expedition, and then i 2130 TURKOMANS, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. gave the governor two men and two A. D. 1840 to 1855. horses for his share; exeusing them selves from paying the full proportion of one in ten, on the ground that they had lost or injured some of their own horses. They then presented the heads of their victims, and received five tillas for each, and were ordered to parade the heads in the bazaar. Captain Conolly rode into the bazaar afterwards, and saw the heads on a pole. He thus describes the place:—'The camel and horse fair was conducted on level spots outside the streets of standing shops, in which the necessaries of life were displayed among a few luxuries by the resident traders. At the doors of many shops young females of dif ferent ages were placed for show, trick ed out in good clothes put on them for the occasion, and having their eyes streaked with antimony to set off their countenances.

Changes in the Political relations of Merve, 1840-1855.—It has already been seen that, prior to the subversion of the Sulfavean dynasty at the commence ment of the eighteenth century, Merve was included in the Persian empire. Subsequently it fell into the possession of J&gt;okhara, but in the earlier part of the present century it was transferred to 20NORTHERN REGION :—TURKOMANIA. 131 Khiva, under whom it still remained until 1840, when Abbott and Oonolly visited the place. In 1841 the people of Merve revolted from the Khan of Khiva, and invited the Ameer of Bokhara to rule over them. The Ameer accordingly sent a garrison and took possession of the city; and, at the re quest of the inhabitants, he appointed a certain Soofee enthusiast to be governor of Merve. In March 1855 the place was visited by Putteh Mahomed, a Kuzzilbash resident at Cabul, who was engaged by Sir Herbert Edwardes to make a journey through Turkistan. Eutteh Mahomed stated that Merve was still subject to Bokhara, and under the government of the same Soofee enthusi ast who had been appointed in 1841. Old Merve was this time entirely deso late, but the Turkomans encamped there occasionally. New Merve contained twenty thousand families of the Yomut, Sarik, and Tekke tribes. The inhabitants were such desperate slave-dealers, that if a man or woman were incautious enough to go to the river alone, he or she were sure to be seized, and carried Punjab off into slavery.* Temporary occupation of Merve by the Persians, 1855-56. —Early in 1855 Merve was occupied by the Persians. 21 Sultan Murad Mirza, the prince governor of Khorassan, marched an army from Meshed to Merve; on which the Turko man tribe of Sarik, who had fought against the Persians the year previously, fled away from Merve to Chardjui and Andkho to escape their vengeance. This occupation, however, was only temporary, for during the Persian siege of Herat in 1856 the city of Merve again fellTURKOMANS,, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. into the possession of the Turkomans.* But before proceeding further with the history of Merve it will be necessary to glance at the contemporary progress of affairs in the city of Sarrakhs, which belonged to the Salor Turkomans, and was situated further to the south. Description of Sarrakhs, 1855; raid of the Salor Turkomans The city of Sarrakhs is perhaps less known to Euro- 22 peans than even Merve. It was how ever visited by Captain Eurnes in 1832, on his way from Chardjui to Meshed. Captain Burnes describes the Turkoman settlement at Sarrakhs as a small and weak fort, almost in ruins, situated on a hillock, under cover of which most of the inhabitants had pitched their tene ments. There were a few mud houses which had been built by the Jews of Meshed, who traded with these people; but the Turkomans themselves lived in their felt-covered khirgahs. At that time Sarrakhs was inhabited by two thousand families of the Salor Turko mans, the noblest of the race. These Salors paid a sparing and doubtful alle giance to Khiva and Persia; and it was only when threatened by the advance of an invading force from either side that they could be induced to tender their submission. When Burnes was at Sarrakhs, the Salor Turkomans had confined a Persian ambassador and put him in chains; and at the same time they refused to grant a share of the transit duties to the Khan of Khiva although in the previous month, when the Khan was in their neighbourhood, they had promised to pay him the required amount. These incidents are sufficiently illustrative of the virtual A. D. 1832. * Despatches of Sir H.

D, 1832- independence of the Salor Turkomans as regards either Persia or Khiva, when they were not overawed by a large force. At Sarrakhs the Salor Turko mans were ruled by twelve Aksahals, or ' greybeards,' the heads of the different families; but they acknowledged no par ticular allegiance to any individual per son. The country round Sarrakhs was well watered by aqueducts from the rivulet of Tejend, which was a little brackish, but its waters were usefully employed in fertilising the fields. The soil was exceedingly rich and well ad apted for agriculture, and the harvest was reaped without a tax. Whilst Capt. Burnes was still residing at Sarrakhs, a party of three hundred and fifty Turkomans returned from a foray on Meshed. They had suddenly descended upon Meshed four days previously, about ten o'clock in the morning, and rode up to its walls without any attempt being made to arrest their progress. On their return they found they had captured a hundred and fifteen human beings, two hundred camels, and many cattle. They set aside a fifth of the spoil for the Khan of Khiva. All this while the Persian army under Abbass Mirza was encamped within two days' journey of Meshed. The frontier post in this direction was Moozderan or Durbund, which is situated about forty-four miles to the westward of Sarrakhs. At Dur bund, Captain Burnes saw a force of irregular soldiers, who were the first sub jects of Persia whom he encountered. The place was once peopled, but the Khan of Khiva some years previously had seized its inhabitants en masse and eCes,™' Tri ' v8ls i,lt0 Bokl ' ata ' yo1 ' rl&gt; ' 50 ' razed the defences.*134 TURKOMANS, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SE1STAN. Visit of Futteh Mahomed to Sarrakhs, 1855 — In 1855 the same Eutteh Mahomed who visited Merve paid also a visit to Sarrakhs, and furnished a narrative of the progress of affairs in that local ity to Sir Herbert Edwardes. Accord ing to his account Sarrakhs was occupied by the Salor Turkomans, and properly belonged to Khiva; but like Merve it had frequently broken out in rebellion, and called itself a dependency of Bokha ra. In reality it was independent of either power. In 1855 the place passed into the temporary occupation of the Persians, but before describing this event, it may be as well to glance at the previous progress of affairs in the Khanate of Khiva, which introduces us to the fifth tribe under review, namely, the Yomut Turkomans.* Retrospect of the history of Khiva, 1747-1855.— In former times the Khanate of Khiva was in the hands of the Usbegs, but 24 was conquered by Nadir Shah. After the advent of Nadir the country was ruled by the Kirghis of the 'Small Horde,' known as the Cossacks of the upper Yurt; but about the end of the last century, an Usbeg chieftain, named Mahomed Ameen, defeated the reigning Cossack ruler, and established himself on the throne of Khiva. The follow ing table will perhaps sufficiently indi cate the progress of affairs in this state:— A. D. 1747 to 1855. * Despatch of Sir H. Edwardes to the Punjab Government, Gth September 1855.

As regards these two tribes, however, a new power appeared upon the scene in 1855, namely that of Persia, who was already projecting the capture of Herat. The Yomut Turkomans were perhaps more immediately dependent on Khiva; and they took an active and im^ portant part in the revolutionary changes which, about 1855, took place in the Khanate of Khiva. Revolutions in Merve, Sarrakhs, and Khiva, 1850-1856.— It has already been stated that in 1855 Sultan Murad Mirza took 39 possession of Merve, and projected the capture of Sarrakhs. At this time Mahomed Ameen Khan, the Second, was ruler of Khiva. This monarch, on account of his early conquests, is regard ed as the most glorious of all the modem rulers of Khiva. Unfortunately a Z sension arose between the Yomut Turkomans and the Usbegs, and the Khan of Khiva ordered that the chief of the Yomuts should be hurled down from the top of a lofty tower. This actMHWJIM — —— NORTHERN REGION :—TURKOMANTA. 137 A- D. 1855 1856- 18 not of much lit excited the enmity of all the Yomuts against Mahomed Ameen Klian. Mean time Mahomed Ameen Khan undertook the reduction of Merve and Sarrakhs, and marched against those places with a considerable force, when he was suddenly slain by treachery. Vambery attributes this act to the Yomuts; but Futteh Mahomed, whose narrative has been already quoted, relates the following story:— Revolution in Khiva affairs: temporary occupa tion of Sarrakhs by the Persians, 1855-56.— When the Khan of Khiva was advancing 27 against Sarrakhs, Merve was already in the possession of the Sultan Murad Mirza, the Persian prince governor of Meshed. At the same time twelve Turkoman chiefs of Sarrakhs had been taken prisoners by the Persians. Accord ingly Sultan Murad Mirza informed the people of Sarrakhs that if they would entrap the Khan of Khiva, he would not only release these twelve chiefs, but place Khiva itself under their rule. The Turkomans of Sarrakhs then wrote to the Khan of Khiva, inviting him to come and receive their submission. The Khan accepted the invitation and arrived at Sarrakhs with a small force and encamped in a little plain without the city, where he was hospitably entertained. Meantime the prince gov ernor of Meshed sent a force of ten thousand horse, with ten guns, to capture the Khan ; and after a desperate battle the Khiva army was cut to pieces, and the Khan was carried off prisoner to Meshed and put to death. The prince governor of Meshed then directed an officer named Mustapha Khan to start for Khiva, L 2138 TURKOMANS; CHAR E1MAKS, AND SEISTAN. accompanied by the men of Sarrakhs, to place Abdulla Khan, the nephew ol tlie deceased Khan, upon his uncle's throne. This Abdulla Khan was in the Persian interest, and at the bottom of the whole plot; and the result of these proceedings was that Merve and Sarrakhs w r ere annexed to Persia; and then, to use the expressive language of Putteh Mahomed, ' the Turkoman fools discovered that they had shaken off a Sunnee ruler and obtained a Shiah tyrant instead.'^ About the same time a Persian officer named Niaz Beg took military occupation of the district of Piujdeh, which lies to the south-east of Sarrakhs, and half-way between that place and Maimana. It was said, how T - ever, that Pinjdeh w r as not formally annexed to the Persian empire.f Persians at Herat: progress of affairs at Merve and Sarrakhs, 1856-57—The Persian oc cupation of Merve must, however, have 28 been of very short duration, whilst Sarrakhs never seems to have been occupied at all. The progress of affairs is, however, somew r hat obscure. In 1856 the Persians were engaged before Herat, and in the autumn of that year a man of the Huzara tribe, named Khan Sowar Khan, was governor of Merve, apparently in behalf of the 1 ersians. A civil war was raging about this period between the Huzaras and the men of Sarrakhs. The latter had carried away a hundred and fifty families from Huzara; and Sultan Murad Mirza proposed to bring about a set tlement of the matter by sending a hundred and fifty families of the Sar rakhs, who had been taken as hostages, A D 18561867. * Despatch of Sir H.

Large bands of Tur komans from Merve and Sarrakhs are said to have plundered the supplies of grain which were being brought from Meshed to Herat for the use of the Persian army; and on one occasion an escort to the number of fifteen hundred men were carried away into captivity. About the same time a body of Turko mans surrounded the city of KhafF, and carried away the whole of the in habitants, as well as all their property and cattle. The Huzaras being more or less Persians, and in favor of the Per sians, attempted to aid the people of Khaff; but they not only failed to rescue the prisoners, but lost fifteen hundred of their own men.f These outrages con tinued to prevail to a still greater extent after the retirement of the Per sians from Herat. Persian intrigues in reference to Herat, 1857-58.—It would be a difficult and perhaps a needless task to attempt to 29 unravel all the intrigues which were carried on by the Persians at this period in reference to Herat. By the treaty of the 4th March 1857, the Shall of Persia engaged within three months to with draw all his forces from the territory and city of Herat, and from every other part of Afghanistan; and to relinquish all claims to suzerainty in this quarter. Before, however, the Persians withdrew from Herat, they installed Sultan Ahmed jges,140 TURKOMANS; CHAR E1MAKS, AND SEI6TAN. Khan, a refugee nephew of the Ameer A- D 1858- Dost Mahomed Khan, as ruler of Herat. At this proceeding the Ameer expressed great indignation, and proposed to the Punjab Government to send his son Gholam Haider Khan against Herat. Meantime, the Sepoy mutiny broke out in Hindustan, and all communication be tween the Punjab and the Government of India was cut off. Accordingly Lord Lawrence, who was at that time Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, could only discourage the Ameer from undertak ing the proposed expedition. At a subsequent period, when the military revolt was crushed out, the ^British Government saw no reason why Sultan Ahmed Khan should not be recognised as ruler of Herat, and consequently declined to interfere between Herat and Cabul. But meantime Sultan Ahmed Khan was accepting the suze rainty of Persia, and was coining money, and reading the khutbah in the name the Shah. # Memoj -andum on Afghanistan Affair^ para. 216 et seq. Utter defeat of the Persian army by the Turko mans of Merve and Sarrakhs, 1858.— In 1858 intelligence arrived from Major Lums- den, who was at that time on a mission to Candahar, that a Persian army, under the command of the prince governor of Meshed, had been for abng Le engaged in the siege of Merve, and was reduced to great straits. All communi cations with Meshed were cut off by the Turkomans, and the scarcity of provisions was so great, that the besiegers were compelled to feed on the flesh of donkeys At length in June 1858, it was reported that the Persians had met with a signal disaster. Eemforcements had reached 30nouthern region :—turkomania. 141 A. D-1858, Meshed, but an escort was required to enable them to reach Merve; and accordingly the prince governor directed the Turkomans of Sarrakhs, who had been behaving submissively for some months, to furnish an escort of four thousand horsemen. The people of Sarrakhs then despatched the horse men to Meshed; and the reinforce ments subsequently left Meshed in company with the Turkomans. On reaching the Durbund Pass, which was the old Persian outpost on the border, the Turkoman escort suddenly broke out in rebellion, and attacked the Persian column, and after a considerable slaugh ter carried away all the survivors in captivity, and plundered all the stores. When the news reached Merve, the Tur komans there closed round the besieging army, and being speedily joined by the men of Sarrakhs, their united forces fell upon the Persian army and utterly defeated it.

Expedition of the ruler of Herat against the Turkomans, 1858 .'At this juncture. Sul tan Ahmed Khan, the ruler of Herat, 31 undertook an expedition against the Turkomans, partly to show his attach ment to Persia, and partly to punish the Turkomans for having committed some raids on Herat territory.

Turkomans; and the latter offered to serve him, and s^ive up all the captives ^nd bootv thev had carried awav from Herat, provided he would engage in a war against Persia, and forbid the issue of Persian coin and reading of prayers in the name of the Shah.

The force consisted of some forty thou- sand men and forty guns, and caused great distress to the Tekke Turkomans. Accordingly the Tekke Turkomans offered to abandon Merve, and to migrate to any locality the Persian prince might appoint, provided that during the interval the Persian army would remove to a distance so as to cause no annoyance to their wives and families. The Persian prince agreed to these terms, and prepared to move their camp on the following morning.

Accordingly they applied to Mahomed Afzul Khan, the governor of Afghan-Turkistan, to assign them a place in his province, in which they might reside as subjects of the Ameer of Cabul. They represented that they had utterly defeated the Per sians, and that although Persia was not very sensitive in such matters, still the Shah would certainly make an attempt at retaliation. On their part they felt equal to the contest, but war had its chances, and they might be weakened by feuds; and if Mahomed Afzul Khan would only accede to their request, they would engage to furnish their quota of militia whenever required, and to do anything except pay revenue, f Defeat of a Persian expedition against Sar rakhs, 1861.—Meantime the Persian Gov ernment appear to have been aroused 34 by these disasters, to which they had been subjected ever since the evacuation of Herat in 1857. The prince governor, who had fled to Herat, was confined in the citadel on his subsequent arrival at Meshed. Preparations were at the same time being made for sending an expedi-144 turkomans, char e1maks, and seis'ian. tion against the Turkomans under the conduct of Sultan Ahmed Khan, the ruler of Herat, with the view of avenging the defeats which the Persians had re ceived, and of annexing Merve and Sar- rakhs to the territory of Herat, which at that time was virtually a province of Persia.* This design however does not appear to have been carried out; Sultan Ahmed Khan being apparently fully occupied by his quarrel with Dost Maho med Khan of Cabul. In September 1861 it was reported that the Persians had renewed hostilities against the Turko. mans, and had met with another heavy disaster. Their object on this occasion was to capture the city of Sarrakhs, and with this view a Persian army advanced from Meshed. On the road, however, the Persians were suddenly attacked at night by a force of five thousand Turko man horse, and were completely surprised and overpowered. Many were killed, and the rest fled, leaving all their pro perty behind. The Turkomans appear to have been singularly exasperated at this advance against their own city, and they threatened that if the Persian Government did not abandon all claim to Sarrakhs, they would never cease to work all the mischief in their power upon the subjects of the Shah.* Rupture between Herat and Cabul; attitude of the Turkomans, 1862.— Meantime the me morable breach had taken place between 35 Sultan Ahmed Khan, the ruler of Herat, and Dost Mahomed Khan, the Ameer of Afghanistan, which ended in the annexation of Herat to the Government of Cabul. The quarrel arose from Sultan Ahmed having actively espoused the cause of the Taymooni chief of Gour, A.

Political complications between Persia and Herat as reg-ards the Turkomans, 1862-63, Here it is curious to note the political com- 36 plications which arose between Persia and Herat on account of the Turkomans. Sultan Ahmed Khan was avowedly a nominee of Persia, although he was a nephew of Dost Mahomed Khan. But this subordination of the ruler of Herat to Persia was by no means agree able either to the Afghans of Herat or to the Turkomans; most of whom were bigoted Sunnees, and imbued with a bitter hatred against the Persian Shiahs. It has already been shown that Sultan Ahmed Khan, as a dependant of Persia, had engaged in active operations against the Turkomans; and that a Persian expedition was under preparation at Meshed, which was to have been placed under his command. When, however, Sultan Ahmed Khan found himself drifting into hostilities against Cabul, he requested the assistance of the Turko mans ; and the Turkomans agreed to assist him with their forces, provided only that he should cease to coin money or read public prayers in the name of the Shah; and that he should not put a stop to the 'Allamans,' or plundering raids, which they carried on as a profes sion. Meantime the Persian Govern ment was by no means satisfied with the independent proceedings of their vassal at Herat; and Sultan Ahmed Khan K 2146 turkomans; char eimaks, and seistan. received a letter from the prince governor A. D. 1863. of Khorassan, to the effect that he had been ordered to assist in the operations acrainst the Tekke Turkomans, but that instead of doing so he had engaged in hostilities against Cabul without any real cause; and that he must now ab stain from making any attack on Cabul, and hold himself in readiness to join the expedition against the Turkomans.* k * ^ly 'isfS 1168 ' 21stto 27th april; 28tha p ril to It would thus seem that the Persian Government fully anticipated what would be the result if the ruler of Herat en gaged in a war with Dost Mahomed Khan; and the war did eventuate ex actly as was expected. Sultan Ahmed Khan exasperated the Ameer beyond all bearing by the capture of Furrah in March 1862; and from that moment the doom of Sultan Ahmed Khan was sealed. In the following June the Ameer recovered Furrah; and in the following July he commenced the siege of Herat. In May 1863. Herat was taken by the Ameer, and was hence forth regarded as an integral part of the dominions of the Ameer of Afghan istan; and, indeed, was the only pro vince that remained faithful to Shere Ali Khan throughout the recent war.t + Memorandum on Afghanistan Affairs, paras. 236 ' * et seq. Tekke Turkomans apply to Dost Mahomed Khan for protection against Persia, 1863.— In 1863, whilst Dost Mahomed Khan 37 was engaged in the siege of Herat, the Persians were preparing a large army at Meshed, ostensibly for the purpose of reducing the Tekke Turkomans, but probably with the view of making a demonstration against Dost Mahomed Khan.

In 1863 Mr. Vambery visited him at Herat in the disguise of a dervish, when the prince, after looking at him in a bewildered manner, cried out,—'My God, you are an Englishman!' In re turn Mr. Vambery professed to be offended, and quoted the traditional saying of the Prophet,—' He who takes, even in sport,the believer for an unbeliever, is himself an unbeliever.' Mahomed Yakoob Khan then apologised by saying that he had never seen a Hadji from Bokhara with such a physiognomy; but Mr. Vambery explained that he was not a Bokha- riot, but a Stambuli, and the explanation was accepted. —Vambery's Travels, pp. 277, 278. renewal of hostilities, and the chief of the tribe paid a visit to the camp of the Ameer, before Herat, accompanied by two thousand horsemen, but was only allowed to approach with sixty of his head men. He presented a nuzzur of three or four horses to the Ameer and his son Shere Ali Khan, and asked for help against the Persians, as other wise he must tender his submission to the Shah. Dost Mahomed Khan of- ferred to give him a lakh of rupees if he would guarantee that the money should be spent in hostilities against Persia; but this was beyond the power of the Turkoman chief, who was accord ingly dismissed with a few presents.* Correspondence between Persia and Herat res pecting' the Turkomans, 1863—The capture of Herat in May 1863 was followed by 3s the death of Dost Mahomed Khan in the following June.

The prince governor threatened that if the ruler of Herat could not stop these raids, the affairs of the Kohistan must be taken in hand from the Meshed side.148 TURKOMANS^ CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. In reply, Maliomed Yakoob Khan simply denied the facts, but added that he had renewed his orders to his officers to stop all predatory expeditions, and to restore any cattle or other property which might have been brought over the border from Khorassan.* It would appear, however, from Mr. Vambery's ac count, that the charges brought against the Herat Government were substantially true. He states that the chief of the Jamsheedhi tribe was the guardian of Mahomed Yakoob Khan ; and that this chief had an understanding with the Turkomans, who extended their depreda tions to the neighbourhood of Herat, f Turkoman raids, 1864-69—During the fratri cidal war which was carried on between the sons of the deceased Dost Mahomed 39 Khan for the throne of Afghanistan, there are but few allusions in the Cabul diaries, beyond occasional notices of raids. About the end of 1864 the Yomut and Goklen tribes in the neigh bourhood of the Caspian were defeated by the Persians, and the Tekke Turko mans in their alarm sought the protec tion of the ruler of Herat. Mahomed Yakoob Khan did not, however, commit himself in any way, but merely re ceived the deputation with kindness, and dismissed them with presents.^ Subsequently they were said to have committed raids on Maimana and the neighbouring Usbeg states; and after the earthquake of 1865, which seems to have reduced the cities of Shib- argham and Akcha to ruin, both places were plundered of all that was left by bodies of Turkomans. || A.

Division of the central region.—The central region of tlie border territory under review lies between Persia and Afghan- 40 istan, and is bounded on the north by the Salor and Sarik Turkomans of the upper Murgab, and on the south by the Belooch country of Seistan. This region comprises three territories, which politically may be regarded as form ing a province of Afghanistan, but o 2150 turkomans^ char eimaks, and seistan. wliich geographically may be considered as forming three distinct divisions, namely:— 1st. —The conntry of the Char Eimaks and Hnzaras. 2nd. —Herat proper. 3rd. —Ghour. Origin of the terms 'Eimak' and 'Huz- ara.'—It has been already stated that the Eimaks and Iluzaras are apparently the 4i same people, having a Mongolian origin, considerably modified during the last few centuries by Persian influences. It should now be added that the terms ' Eimak' and ' Huzara' do not indicate a distinction of race, but are mere arbi trary appellations, which might have been applied to different branches or divisions of the same people. Thus, the term ' Eimak' is a common term among all Tartars of the north and east for a division or a tribe.* The term * Elphinstone's Cabul, Vol. II, p. 204 'Huzara' again signifies a thousand, and the old Tartar army used to be divided into a certain number of Iluzaras or regiments; and it is possible that some of these bodies, which may ori' ginally have been left by the Tartar con querors to occupy part of a conquered country, are really the ancestors of the ,, VAXXkJ XC^Vyt/ d-LLVl —VV.^. w* — two other Persian-speaking tribes of Afghanistan and the neighbouring countries, known as the Tajiks and Kuzzilbashes. This distinction may be roughly stated as follows. The Char people now called Huzaras.f f Elphin stone's Cabul, Vol. II, p. 208 Perrier's Caravan Journeys, p. 191. Distinction between the Eimaks, the Tajiks, and Zuzzilbashes.—In describing the EiTnnlcs. nr TT itzqvqc ! f «« «CENTRAL REGION :—THE CHAR EIMAKS, &amp;C. 151 Eimaks are Tartars by descent, and the Persian dialect they speak is distin guished by a considerable admixture of Turkee words and roots. The Tajiks, on the other hand, are Sunnees, and are descendants from the ancient Persians ; whilst the Kuzzilbashes are Shiahs and modern Persians, who were established * Beiiew's Journal, pp. 14 et seq. at Cabul by Nadir Shah.* The Kuzzilbashes are of some political import- ance, as they have had some influence in Persian- izing the Afghan country, especially as regards Definition of the term ' Char Eimaks ' A P. manners. This is m some measure due to the _ influence of the Kuzzilbash ladies. A Kuzzilhash COrding to Mr. Elphinstone, the ' Char will often give his daughter in marriage to an ■ L Afghan, who readily accepts the Shiah beauty; -CiimakS, Or tc lOUT tribes,' Originally 43 he comprised the Teymoonis, the Huza- Tartar, scarcely interior to an infidel. rag, the TeymOOreeS, and the ZoorCCS ; but this description has long ceased to hold good. Under the name of Huza- ras Mr. Elphinstone included the Jam- sheedhis and Firuzkuhis, who are now regarded as separate tribes of the Char Eimaks. No trace can be found of the nature and extent of the changes which have taken place since Mr. Elphin stone collected his information sixty years ago; and perhaps it will suffice to say that the current idea of the Char Eimaks in the present day is that they comprise the four following tribes:— (1).—Eiruzkuhis. (2).—Jemsheedhis. (3).—Huzaras. (4).—Teymoonis. Distinction between the Sunnee Huzaras and the Shiah Huzaras.—Before proceeding to describe these four tribes of Eimaks, it 44 will be necessary to lay down the distinc tion between the Huzara Eimaks speci fied above, and the Huzara tribe, which must be regarded as a distinct and separate people. The Huzara Eimaks are Sunnees, who occupy a western152 TURKOMANS, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. district in the neighbourhood of Killa No; but the Huzara tribe are Shiahs, who occupy the eastern range of the Hindu Kush, the Paropamisus of classical antiquity. The Sunnee Huzara Eimaks and the Shiah Huzaras are originally the same people, but they separated under the following circumstances. The Huzaras are a Tartar people. As far back as the thirteenth century, they were brought by Chenghiz Khan from their ancient seat in Mongolia to the southern part of Central Asia, and set tled in the country between Herat and Cabul. About the latter end of the sixteenth century, when the Persian empire extended over Cabul and Can- dahar, they were converted to the Shiah faith, chiefly, it is said, through the interference of Shah Abbass the Great. At the same time, they began to lose the Mogul language and to speak a dialect of the Persian. A century afterwards, about the time of Nadir Shah, a branch of these Huzaras migrated northward and settled in the neighbourhood of Killa No, and were converted by their neighbours to the Sunnee faith; and from this circum stance, the Sunnee Huzaras of Killa No are still separated from the Shiah Huzaras of the eastern portion of the Hindu Kush between Herat and Cabul.* * Varabery's Travels in Central Asia, p. 263. Character of the Char Eimaks.—The Char Eimaks, as distinguished from the Shiah Huzaras, live almost entirely in camps. 45 They have felt-covered tents, like the khirgahs of the Turkomans; but some prefer the black tent of the Afghans They keep many sheep, and rear a small but active and hardy breed of horses.A. D. 1808 to 1810. * Elpliiustone's Cabul, Vol. II, pp. 206, 207. f Elphinstone's Cabul, Vol. II, p. 207- CENTRAL REGION:—THE CHAR EIMAKS, &amp;C. 15:3 Their food is the same as that of the Afghans, excepting that they eat horse flesh, and make their bread of the flour of an oily sort of nut mixed with that of wheat. In war they exhibit a savage ferocity, throwing their prisoners down precipices, shooting them to death with arrows, and drinking the warm blood of their victims, and rubbing it over their faces and beards.* Political status of the Char Eimaks, 1808-10 — The political status of the Char Eimaks at the time of Mr. Elphinstone's mis- 46 sion to Peshawur in 1808 is thus des cribed by that gentleman :—'The Ei maks,' he says, 'have always been dependent on Herat, and the greater part of them still acknowledge the suze rainty of the ruler of Herat, to whom they furnish troops when required, and at whose court they either attend in person, or keep a near relative. The Huzara Eimaks differ from the other Eimak tribes in having the features, dress, and manners of the Usbegs. They are proud of this resemblance, and their chief carefully keeps up a connec tion with the court of Bokhara.'f Mr. Elphinstone adds that two of the Eimak tribes westward of Herat were subject to Persia, but his statement must be received with some reservation. The appearance of the Persians in this quarter only commenced about the time that he visited Peshawur, namely, 1808, when Feroz -ud-deen, the full brother of Shah Mahmood of Cabul, was indepen dent ruler of Herat. Accordingly the suzerainty of Persia over any of the Eimaks, if exercised at all, was alto gether temporary and exceptional. P 2154 TURKOMANS, CirAIl EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. Distinction between the Char Eimaks and A. D. 1808 to 1810. Shiah Huzaras.—In addition to the dis tinction of religion, there appears to be 47 some difference in the civilisation of the Char Eimaks and that of the Shiah Huzaras. The Eimaks are mostly nomades, living in tents and moving their encampments at will. The Shiah Ilnzaras on the contrary live in thatch ed houses in villages. Country of the Char Eimaks and Shiah Huzaras. —It is difficult, if not impossible, to describe the exact localities of the Char 48 Eimaks and Iluzaras. The political changes have been very frequent, and whole tribes have been often trans planted from one locality to another. Again, the face of the country seems to partake of the changing character of the inhabitants. The transplanting of tribes has been accompanied by the turning of the courses of rivers, and the destruction of old towns and rapid creation of new ones. Under such circumstances, the most correct descrip tions which could be gathered from local sources are often only true for a comparatively limited period. The Char Eimaks, however, may be said to occupy the western region to the north, west, and south of Herat; whilst the Shiah Huzaras inhabit the eastern range of the Hindu Kush between Heiat and Cabul. T-he whole region may be described as a large natural fortress, seated in the centre of the Asiatic table-land j and in this mountain, stronghold the rude tribes of Char Eimaks secure themselves from their neighbours in the plains, and occasion ally issue forth to plunder a caravan or solitary traveller. Geographically, asCENTRAL REGION THE CHAR ETMAKS, &amp;C. 15 already stated, the country belongs to Afghanistan; but it is only at intervals that the Eimaks or Iluzaras render al legiance to ftither Cabul or Herat. The ITuzaras, however, have a peaceful phase in their character which is worthy of notice. During the winter months, they emerge from their fastnesses in thousands, and spread themselves over Afghanistan and the districts bordering on the Peshawur frontier in search of labour. In the capacity of servants, they are considered to be faithful, docile and trustworthy; but in the in dependence of their mountain homes they are savage and inveterate enemies of the Afghans.* Historical notices of the Char Eimaks: (1) the Firuzkuhis.—The Eiruzkuhi Eimaks are of Persian origin.

(DFiruzkuhis near Killa No under Mowdood Kuli Khan, 1836-1845.—The first clan of Fi- ruzkuhi Eimaks was posted close to Killa so No in the immediate neighbourhood of the Sunnee Huzaras, under a chief named Mowdood Kuli Khan. According to Lieutenant Pottinger, Mowdood Kuli Khan had been forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the Huzaras of Kila No. When, however, the Persians ad vanced in 1837 under Ausuf-ul-Dowla, • ; the governor of Khorassan, Mowdood Kuli Khan shook off the yoke of the Huzaras, and made terms with the Persian Government through the chief of certain Piruzkuhis who were posted at Kishapoor, and were considered as part of the so-called Eimak tribe. The result was, that the Shah of Persia gave Mowdood Kuli Khan the title of Sirdar, and sent him rich presents of investiture. He was very popular with his tribe, and bore a high character for courage, activity and intelligence. He had a blood feud with Shah Pasund Khan of Derzay, who had slain his father.* When General Perrier nassed » ^ ^ ,, i ji . , 1 Pottinger s Memoir, MS. through the neighbourhood in 1845, Mowdood Kuli Khan again acknow ledged the authority of Kureem dad Khan, the chief of the Sunnee Huzaras at Killa No .f + r, • ' ^ t iq « T -rerner s Caravan Journeys, p. i9o.

He married a daughter of Shah Pasund Khan, but his wife quarrelled with him on account of his indulgence in a name less vice. On one occasion the lady took advantage of his absence to murder all his minions, and then marched the clan off to her father's country. The result was a feud between Ibrahim Khan and Shah Pasund Khan. Firuzkuhis at Chekcheran and Dowlut Yar.— Of the two Piruzkuhi clans at Chekcheran and Dowlut Yar, no information is 53 supplied by Lieutenant Pottinger or General Eerrier beyond a bare statement of names. Some particulars respecting Dowlut Yar will be furnished hereafter in connection with the hostilities be tween the Eimaks and Huzaras described by Captain Conolly. (2) The Jamsheedhi Eimaks described by Pottin ger, 1839 The Jamsheedhis are describ ed by Lieutenant Pottinger as occupy- ^ ing the valley of Khooshk. In 1839, when he wrote his memoir, the Jam sheedhis numbered about 12,000 fami- Q2158 TURKOMANS^ CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. lies. They were said to derive their A. D. 1839 to 1851. name from the Perso-Arabic expression Jumashoodah, i. e. ' collected/' as they comprise refugees from all quarters, but principally from Seistan. They however claim to be descended from Jemsheed, the fabulous king of the genii. They were not so warlike a tribe as the Sunnee Huzaras, and probably could not have brought so large a number of good cavalry into the field. Prior to Pottinger's visit, their chief was Mahomed Zeman Khan, a proteg^ of Yar Mahomed Khan, the ruler of Herat, who tried to set him up as a counterpoise to the ruler of the Sunnee Huzaras. Por a while the attempt failed. A good understanding was main tained between the chief of the Jam- sheedhis and the chief of the Sunnee Huzaras, and the latter betrothed his sister to Mahomed Zeman Khan. The chief of the Sunnee Huzaras however died before the marriage was completed, and his successor refused to permit Mahomed Zeman Khan to consummate it. Accordingly, the chief of the Jam- sheedhis was alienated from the Sunnee Huzaras, and again became a tool in the hands of Yar Mahomed Khan; ^ but his tribe was much disaffected towards him, and many refused to acknowledge his authority.* _ * Pottinger's Memoir, MS. subject to Herat in the reign of Tar Mahomed Khan, 1839-1851— General Ferrier fur nishes some additional particulars re-55 specting the Jamslieedhis.

CENTRAL REGION THE CHAR EIMAKS, &amp;C. 159 1839, about the time that Pottinger was passing through the country, they murdered a Heratee envoy who had been sent by Yar Mahomed Khan to induce them to return to their alle giance. Accordingly, Yar Mahomed Khan marched an army against the Jamsheedhis and defeated them, and transplanted five thousand of their families to Herat; a measure which served to re-people Herat, and furnished hostages for the future good behaviour of the remaining families of the Jam sheedhis in the Khooshk valley. The latter, however, met with a worse fate than their brethren in Herat; for shortly after the departure of Yar Mahomed Khan, a body of Usbegs from Khiva appeared in the valley* and carried off all the remaining men, women, and children into slavery in Turkistan.* Subsequent condition of the Jamsheedhis — The above account is to some extent confirmed by Mr. Vambery. Accord ing to the latter traveller, however, 56 the Jamsheedhis were not sold into slavery, but merely transplanted from the right bank of the Murgab to the left bank of the Oxus. Mr. Vambery states that the change was for the better ; but that the irresistible attach ment of the Jamsheedhis to their old mountain homes soon led them to return to their former haunts, where they were still settled in 1864! in no very brilliant circumstances.'}* Subjection of the Jamsheedhis to Herat, 1860. The subsequent history of the Jam sheedhis can only be gathered from a few 57 scattered entries in the Cabul diaries, and travels of Mr. Vambery. In I860,160 TURKOMANS^ CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. when Sultan Ahmed Khan was ruler of Herat, his son, Shah Newaz Khan, made an expedition against the Jamsheedhis of Khooshk, to punish them for some raids which they had recently committed on the Huzaras. Meantime, the Firuzkuhis assembled to support the Jamsheedhis against the Heratee army; but went over to Shah Newaz Khan and put him in possession of the fort on the upper Murgab. The Jamsheedhis, however, were there joined by other tribes from Pinjdeh, and inflicted a severe defeat on the Heratee army, and applied to Dost Mahomed Khan for protection. Ultimately, it was reported that the Jamsheedhis agreed to become the sub jects of the Herat ruler, and to furnish militia, on the condition that they received the same allowances that were paid to their tribe in the days of Yar Mahomed Khan.* Description of the Jamsheedhis by Mr. Vambery, ]864—As regards the present political ^ condition of the Jamsheedhis, Mr. Vam- 58 bery remarks as follows :—' In dress, manner of life, and character the Jamsheedhis resemble the Turkomans; their forays are just as much dreaded as those of the Turkomans; but they cannot be so frequent on account of the inferiority of their numbers. At present they have two chiefs,—Mehdi Khan and Allah Kuli Khan, who are notoriously vassals of the Afghans, and well recompensed as such by Mahomed Yakoob Khan, the young governor of Herat. The Afghans, even in the time of Host Mahomed Khan, took every possible step to win the Jamsheedhis to their side, in order to set up a barrier against the incursions of the rulers ojf A.

In return, Mehdi Khan, the chief of the Jamsheedhis, rendered such essential service to the late Dost Mahomed Khan at the siege oi Herat in 1862-63, that he gained the entire favor of that Ameer and the present sovereign, Shere Ali Khan. Accordingly, when Shere Ali Khan, on his accession to the throne of Afghanis tan in 1863, placed the government of Herat in the hands of his young son, Mahomed Yakooh Khan, he appointed Mehdi Khan to be his guardian.' Mr. Vambery is of opinion that the exten sion of the territory of Afghanistan to the Murgah is very precarious, for the Jamsheedhis may at any time break out into revolt, as they do not admit that the ruler of Herat has any right to their allegiance, and would deny it altogether if any hesitation or delay occurred in the liquidation of their pay.* (3). Huzaras: Distinction between the western and eastern Huzaras.—A distinction has been already drawn between the western 59 Huzaras of Killa No, who are Sunnees, and the eastern Huzaras between Herat, Maimana and Cabul, who are Shiahs. The western Huzaras are also distin guished by the name of Huzara Zeid- nats; whilst the eastern Huzaras are known by the name of Huzara Pusht Koh, or Huzaras from the other side of the mountain. Country of the western Huzaras described by Conolly, 1839.—The western Huzaras, who are Sunnees, appear to reside chiefly eo at Killa No; but they have occasion ally occupied the districts of Murgab and Pinjdeh; and indeed it is impossible163 turkomans^ char eimaks, and seistan. to say where the Huzara encampments end and those of the Turkomans begin. A general sketch of the country be tween Maimana and Merve is furnished by Captain Conolly in 1839 in the manuscript journal already quoted, from which the following particulars are ab stracted :—Eive marches from Maimana, Captain Conolly encamped on the river Murgab at the ford of Karaoul Khana, a few miles below the ford of Bala Murgab. This portion of the route lay through hills of a light clay enclosingmany well-water ed valleys and glens, in which cultivated wheat, barley, millet, sesame, flax and cotton, vineyards and gardens flourished about the villages. Brisk little fairs were held twice a week at the principal villages for the convenience of the people round. The country was very fruitful, and only required more inhabi tants to be very valuable. The road to Karaoul Khana was safe, but vigilantly watched by patrolling parties detached by the Wullee of Maimana, the Jam- sheedhi tribe, and the Sunnee Huzaras of Killa No. Several Cafilas passed on the road to Bokhara with merchandise, or to Maimana with grain, and single Turkomans were taking horses to Mai mana to exchange for slaves. Captain Conolly passed the ruined fort of Koer- mash, the ancient border mark of the Jamsheedhis; and here he was met by a young chief of the Jamsheedhis, who complained that he had been driven from his home by his powerful rival Maho med Ameen Khan. Captain Conolly forded the Murgab at Karaoul Khana, and moved along the left bank for eight marches to Merve. Many mud pillars, which were formerly used by watchers A. D. 1839- ml .A.

CENTRAL REGION :—THE CHAR EIMAKS, &amp;C. 163 of crops, were still standing among the weedy bushes that had overrun the chief portion of the deserted valley; and many traces still remained of the indus try with which the land had previously been irrigated. In some parts high reeds had sprung up thickly, where flood water from the Murgab had been allowed to settle; and the stagnation of this water was apparently the cause of the malaria which rendered the district uninhabitable during the heat of sum mer. The next wide break of the Murgab valley formed the head of the Pinjdeh division, extending twenty miles down to a point where the stream of Khooshk joins the Murgab. This region contained a reedy vegetation in standing water on one side, but never theless was well inhabited by Turko mans, who were evidently in a flourish ing condition. These Turkomans bred many horses for export, and also found pasture for large flocks of sheep and herds of camels, and cultivated part of their range of the valley with jow- aree, wheat, and barley.* Independence of the western Huzaras as des cribed by Pottinger, 1839.—Lieu tenant Pottinger, who journeyed from Herat ^ to Cabul in 1839, furnishes a clear ac count of the western Huzaias. Killa No,' he says, ' belongs to the Sunnee Huzaras. They are a branch of the Shiah tribe of that name. Their numbers. are rated at 4,800 families, besides a number of petty Eimak tribes subject to them for military service, such as the Eowtees, and part of the Kipchaks, Tymoorees, Teymoonis, Piruzkuhis, and Moguls, who are sure to swell their number.164 turkomans^ char eimaks, and seistan. These men are well mounted and armed. They carry a sword and a gun, and in the use of the latter are extremely expert. They ride well and are capital cavalry for foraging, in which their time is chiefly spent. Their chief, who has the high title of Beghubegi from the Herat govern ment, has complete authority over them, and is very jealous of the inter ference of the inferior chiefs {i. e., the Khet Khordas of clans). He could raise on an emergence two thousand very good cavalry, and pro bably three thousand indifferently mounted and disaffected. The chiefs name is Kureem dad Khan. He has three brothers now alive younger than himself, viz.:— Mahomed Hussein Khan, Abdul Aziz Khan, Ahmed Kuli Khan. Ahmed Kuli Khan is, however, by a different mother, and has no authority in the tribe. The petty chiefs of the tribe are said to be disaffected, and intriguing to sow dissension among the brothers. None of the family have much courage, and the second brother, Mahomed Hossein Khan, is a positive coward. The Beghubegi, Kureemdad Khan, is a man of sense, of a most pacific disposition, and inclined to do justice, but the excesses of his brothers prevent the latter; to this, and the haughtiness with which they tieat their clansmen, may be traced the cause of their unpopularity. The tribe, as well as its chief, distrust and fear Yar Mahomed Khan, the ruler of Herat, and are anxious to A D. 1839. j Memoir o# JS.A.

They have the most bitter hatred to the Persian Government, which, however, is always trying to bring them over. The Khiva Government is also trying the same; but they will agree to neither, as their doing so would at once destroy their independence.'* Subjection to Herat as described by Ferrier, 1845—General Ferrier, who travelled through the neighbourhood in 1845,62 furnishes a description which corres ponds with that of Lieutenant Pottinger, whilst bringing down the description to a later date. He speaks of Killa No as occupying an advantageous position on the spot at which the principal roads of Turkistan and Afghanistan meet. As regards the four brothers specified by Pottinger, he says that the jurisdiction of the chief Kureem dad Khan extend ed over twenty-eight thousand tents; and that he could at any moment have under arms five thousand excellent horsemen and three thousand indifferent; and that in case of need he could treble the number of his cavalry. Of the three brothers, Abdool Aziz Khan governed the district of Murgab, and Ahmed Kuli Khan that of Pinjdeh; but Ma homed Hussein Khan resided at He rat with twenty-five chiefs of rank, who remained there as hostages for the fidelity of their relatives to Yar Ma homed Khan. Meantime, however, a change had taken place in the political status of the tribe. In 1839 Kureem dad Khan was an independent chief, who followed the noble profession of robber. He plundered caravans, and extended his forays to the south of x 31863 166 turkomans, chae eimaks, and seistan. Persia in the district of Ghayn, where A. D 1845 to 1863. he sacked the villages, and carried off • the people to sell them to the Usbegs. His depredations were so frequent, and o-ave rise to so many complaints, that Ausuf-ud-Dowla, the Persian governor of Khorassan, represented to Yar Ma homed Khan that, unless he could keep his vassal in order, it would be neces sary to march a Persian army against him. Yar Mahomed Khan had no desire to see the Persians violate his territory, and was determined to remove every excuse for their doing so; and accordingly marched in force against Kureem dad Khan, vanquished him, and obliged him once again to acknow ledge the sovereignty of Herat which he had previously thrown off.* * FemevV Caravan Journeys, p. 191. Subsequent history of the western Huzaras, 1845-63.—In 1845 Kureem dad Khan could not have found the yoke imposed by r,3 Y&amp;v Mahomed Khan very heavy to bear. He paid no tribute, for although he sent every year a few choice horses to the ruler of Herat, yet he received a return present of Cashmere shawls and Euro pean goods, which exceeded the value of the horses. His brother, Mahomed Hussein Khan, and the twenty -five minor chiefs who lived at Herat were all in the possession of good appointments ; and the only obligation under which Kureem dad Khan could be said to labour w as that of furnishing a contin gent of troops whenever the ruler of Herat was engaged in war; and even in this respect he was amply compen sated by the protection which he re ceived from the ruler ot Herat against his neighbours and old enemies the Usbeg Khans. Nevertheless, Kureem ICENTRAL REGION:—THE CHAR EIMAKS, &amp;C. 107 dad Khan yielded but a very dubious allegiance to Herat. He maintained a secret correspondence with Ausuf-ud- Dowla, the Persian governor of Klio- rassan, and promised to assist him if the 1 ersians would once again renew the siege of Herat, which they had been compelled to raise in 1838. About the latter end of 184^ Ausuf-ud-Dowla, the old enemy of Yar Mahomed Khan, was removed from the government of Kho- rassan. Ever since 1833 this personage had counteracted the ambitious designs of Yar Mahomed Khan, and had not only prevented him from extending his rule over the western Khanates of Afghan-Turkistan, but had materially checked his legitimate authority over the western Huzaras. Accordingly, in 1817, when Yar Mahomed Khan ascertained beyond a doubt that Ausuf-ud-Dowla had departed for Teheran, he marched against Kureem dad Khan, with the view of fully establishing his supremacy over the western Huzaras, and ultimately reducing the Char Walayats between the Hindu Kush and the Oxus. Kureem dad Khan, however, was determined on resistance, and a sanguinary conflict ensued which lasted for nine hours. At length the Huzaras were completely crushed, and Kureem dad Khan was compelled to fly with a single horseman into Persian territory. Yar Mahomed Khan then collected ten thousand fami lies of the western Huzaras and trans planted them to the banks of the river Heri-rood in that part of the Herat district which lies between Obeh and Ghorian. The subsequent history of the western Huzaras may be told in a few words. After the death of Yar168 turkomans; char eimaks, and seistan. Mahomed Khan, Kureem dad Klian re tained Killa No, and gave considerable trouble to liis successor on the throne of Herat up to the time when the revo lution broke out in 1855; but from that date little further information has been obtained of him or his fortunes. Mr. Vambery visited Killa No in 1863, and found that the town and fortress were in ruins, but the place was still surround ed by a few tents of the Huzaras, who appeared to be even poorer than the Jamsheedhis. According to Mr. Vam bery, Killa No had been fifty years previously a flourishing town, which had served as a depot to the caravans proceeding from Persia to Bokhara. But the Huzaras became overbearing and presumptuous, and engaged in a struggle with Herat which terminated in their own downfall. At the same time they made enemies of the Persians by their predatory excursions into Khorassan, in which they rivalled the lurkomans. Mr. Vambery reached Killa No in the latter part of 1863, when Shere Ali Khan had just suc ceeded Dost Mahomed Khan as Ameer of Afghanistan, and was probably still at Herat. At that time Baba Khan was chief of the Huzaras of Killa No, and it was supposed from his poverty and weakness that he would still acknow ledge the supremacy of Herat which was only two days' journey distant. Baba Khan, however, assumed the air of an independent prince, and scarcely had the caravan settled down in the ruins of Killa No than he appeared in person, and demanded his customs. The head ol the caravan, however, soon brought him to his senses by threatening toAnte A- D. 1845- * Ferrier's Caravan Journeys, pp. 193, 194; History of Afghanistan, p. 486; Vambery 's Travels in Central Asia, pp. 263, 264. t Price's History of Mussulman Empires, Vol. IT, p- 453; Elphinstone's History of India, Book V, Chap. 4; PeiTier's Caravan Journeys, p. 242. General Perrier visited the ruins of Zerni, the ancient capital of Ghour, which he found in utter ruins. The population consisted of twelve hundred Sooris and Teymoonis and a few Guebres or fire- worshipperg. CENTRAL REGION THE CHAR EIMAKS, &amp;C. 169 send an express to Herat to complain of the demand; and Baba Khan then withdrew liis claim to customs, and contented himself with a sum which 'w as exacted under the name of ee whip money,' which was ostensibly giv^en in return for the secret which he was supposed to have supplied.* (4) The Teymooni Simaks of Ghour.—The Teymooni Eimaks occupy the strong country of Ghour in the mountains east 64 of Herat, a territory which is still famous in national tradition. The mountains of Ghour are regarded by the Afghans as their earliest seat, and it appears certain that, in the early period of the caliphat of Bagdad, the territory of Ghour was occupied by the Afghan tribe of Soor. These Afghan Sooris were converted to Islam in the eighth cen tury. In the eleventh they were over thrown by Mahmood of Ghuznee; but in the twelfth they arose again, and not only destroyed the house of Ghuz nee, but established an empire which extended from Khiva to the mouths of the Ganges. But the dynasty of the Sooris of Ghour shared the fate of all the evanescent empires of early Mus sulman history. It blazed but for a moment, and was then supplanted by a dynasty of Turkee slave kings.f Since then the Sooris of Ghour have been reduced by civil wars, and their country has been occupied by the Teymooni Eimaks, who succeeded in forming a government under the protection of the sovereigns of Herat; but as late as 1845 there were four or five thousand families of Sooris in the north-west of Ghour. The Teymoonis, like the other170 turkomans, char e1maks, and se1stan. Eimaks, have always been more or less dependent upon Herat. When Herat- was at peace and in possession of an army, the Teymoonis paid a small tri bute in kind, of grain, cattle, or horses ; but whenever Herat was weakened by agitation, the Teymoonis appear to have dispensed with this duty.* Modern history of the Teymoonis.—The Tey moonis of Ghour are so completely out of the route of ordinary travellers, that 65 few notices can be found respecting them. According to General Eerrier, the tribe was divided into three branches under the three following chiefs :— Ibrahim Khan at Teivereh with 1,000 horse and 700 foot. Mustapha Khan at Deria-dereh with 200 horse and 3,000 foot. Mahmood Khan in the valley of Jevedj with 1,000 foot. Ibrahim Khan was the nearest to Herat, but had been devoted to the cause of Shah Kamran, the nominal sovereign of Herat, as opposed to that of the Vizier Yar Mahomed Khan; and when Shah Kamran was murdered in 1842, Ibrahim Khan refused to acknowledge the usurped authority of Yar Mahomed Khan, and gave an asylum to certain refugees of the family of the deceased ruler. Yar Mahomed Khan, however, made war against him, and about the end of 1844 transplanted half the popu lation from Ghour to Herat, where he converted the men into militia. So Ion'- as Yar Mahomed Khan lived, the Tey moonis were probably kept sufficiently in order.

These people are divided into tribes, of whom the four following are the most consider able, namely:— Deh Zingee. Deh Koondee. f Elphiustone's Cabul, Vol. II, p. 211. Elphimfcone's Cabul, Vol. II, p. 207 et A. D. 1808 to 1810. Janghooree. Polandeh.f General character of the Shiah Huzaras.— Every chief of the Shiah Huzaras is absolute in his own tribe. He adminis- 67 ters justice, imposes fines, imprisons, and even puts to death. In general these Shiahs live in villages composed of from twenty to two hundred thatched houses, half sunk in the slopes of the hills. Each village is defended by a high tower, capable of containing ten or twelve men, and full of loop-holes. In each tower there is a kettle drum, and in times of peace a single man remains in the tower to sound an alarm if necessary. The women main tain a considerable ascendancy, and are loose in their manners. In the more civilised parts of the country they pros titute themselves for money when their husbands are out of the way. In other parts a depraved hospitality prevails by which the husband lends his wife to his guests. { Political status of the Huzaras, 1808-1810.- According to Mr. Elphinstonc, the Huzaras were subject to the Ameer es173 turkomans, char eimaks, and s ei stan. of Afghanistan, and in general were divided between the governments of Ghorian and Bamian; but at the time of Mr. Elpliinstotfie's visit they could scarce ly be said to be under either government. They were constantly engaged in wars against their neighbours, and against the Eimaks; and they also opposed the agressions of Khilich Ali Khan, the o o great Usbeg chief in Balkh, who had reduced many of the nearest Huzaras under his authority. Sometimes the chiefs united to rebel against the Ameer of Afghanistan, but such confederacies were soon broken up. A curious story was told to Mr. Elphinstone by a man who was employed to collect the revenue under the government of Bamian, which illustrates their inability to form a useful or solid confederacy. The man was sometimes called into an assembly of six or seven of these Huzara chiefs, who would inform him that they were determined not to pay tribute, and that he might go about his business. The same night one chief would come and declare that he had no share in this contumacy. Next morning one or two more would come, and the whole confederacy would dis solve. When it once came to blows, they would often hold well together; but they were always quelled in the end.* Subsequent independence of the Shiah Huza ras.— The status of the Shiah Huzaras, as described by Mr. Elphinstone, seems 69 to have continued with but little inter mission down to the present day. The same picture of lawless independence appears in the narratives of every travellerCENTRAL REGION :—THE CHAR EIMAKS^ &amp;C. 173 who lias either penetrated to the neigh bourhood of this mountain stronghold of barbarous clans, or has been in a position to collect authentic informa tion. Sir Alexander Burnes, who passed over the Hindu Kush in 1832, on his way to Bokhara; Lieutenant Pot- tinger, who traversed the same neigh bourhood on his way from Herat to Cabul in 1839; Captain Conolly, who jour neyed the same year from Bamian to Khiva; General Eerrier, who struck through the Huzara country in 1845 ; and Dr. Bellew, who collected most valuable and authentic information during his stay at Candahar in 1857 ; all tell the same story of the lawless outrage and practical independence of every surrounding power. Mr. Vambery never penetrated the Hindu Kush, but merely visited Maimana and Balkh, and then proceeded to Herat via Killa No; and therefore does not add to the stock of information previously available. Burnes' notices of the Shiah Huzaras, 1832.—It will be remembered that Burnes pro ceeded to Bokhara in the guise of a 70 mendicant Persian; and one evening alighted upon a Huzara family who received him, under the circumstances, very kindly. His account of the Huza ras is more domestic and pleasing than that of any other traveller. 'We had here,' he says, ' an opportunity of see ing the Huzaras in their native state among the mountains; and were re ceived by an old lady in a miserable flat-roofed house, partly below ground, with two or three openings in the roof as windows. She was taking care of her grandchild, and bade us welcome174 TURKOMANS^ CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. by the lordly name of 4 Agha.' I called her 'mother;' and the old dame chatted about her house and family matters. We were taken for Per sians ; and since the Huzaras are of the same creed as that nation, were honoured guests. Our mendicant garb could lead to no discovery that we were Europeans. The old woman assured us that the men prevented them from stirring out of their houses for six months in the year (for it never rains), and that they sowed the barley in June, and reaped it in September. These people have no money, and are almost ignorant of its value. We got everything from them by barter, and had no occasion to show them gold, by which Englishmen are so soon found out in any country. A traveller among them can only purchase the necessaries of life by giving a few yards of cloth, a little tobacco, pepper, or sugar, which are here appreciated far above their value. The Huzaras are a simple-hearted people, and differ much from the Afghan tribes. In physiognomy they more resemble Chinese, with their square faces and small eyes. They are Tar tars by descent, and one of their tribes is now called Tartar Huzaras. There is a current belief that they bestow their wives on their guests, which is certainly erroneous. The women have great influence, and go unveiled. They are handsome and not very chaste which has perhaps given rise to the scandal among their Sunnee neigh bours, who detest them as heretics * Were their country not strong, they would soon be extirpated, for they LiroiiillotlmVol. I. p*^ 3 I D. 1840. * Elphinstone referred to this depraved hos pitality as an actual tact.

TI tq it i « , . i he peaceful character of this descrip tion of the Shiah Huzaras is accounted foi by the subsequent explanation that, about this period, a false prophet had appeared among the Huzaras, who had impressed his followers with the belief that he could raise the dead and pass through fire without injury, and had induced them to adopt many odious customs including that of the commu nity of women, and the performance of bacchanalian orgies in the dark; and their proceedings had so wounded the orthodoxy of the Huzaras that they were engaged in a crusade against the f Burnes' Travels into Bokhara, Vol. I, page 180. blaspheming heretics.'}' A D- 1840 Captain Conolly's journey through the Huzara and Eimak country, 1840.—Captain Conolly's manuscript journal of his pro- 71 gress from Eamian to Merve, on his way to Khiva in 1840, furnishes some curious illustrations of life amongst the Eimaks and Huzaras. A safe passage from Bamian to Maimana had been negotiated by Agha Hussein, a native of Herat, who had long traded with the clans. Accord ingly Captain Conolly was escorted through the Huzara country by eighty Huzara horsemen under the command of Meer Sadik Beg, a chief of the Deh Zingee; and subsequently was conducted through the country of the Eimaks by a force obtained from the Piruzkuhis. Captain Conolly carried letters from Shah Shuja, the newly restored Ameer of Afghanistan, to the various chiefs in that quarter. The first adventure was with a chief of the Huzaras in the valley of Yaikoling, named Meer Mohib. This man is des-176 TUKKOMANS, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. cribed by Captain Conolly as a vulgarian of the coarsest order. A letter from Shah Shuja was delivered to him, which he put to his head with a fair show of respect, and then paid a visit to Captain Conolly, who gave him a suitable pre sent. Captain Conolly thus describes the interview:—' Having taken leave, he (Meer Mohib) sent to beg my furred cloak, and on my giving him a note which would procure him one from Bamian, he sent to say that he must have my girdle shawl and a thousand rupees before he would per mit us to depart. We were too many to be bullied here. We therefore replied that the Meer seemed to mis understand our condition, and marched away at once.' Captain Conolly then proceeded westward along the course of the Herat river until he reached the fort of Deh Zingee, when he had an interview with another chief, named Meer Sadik Beg, which he describes as follows :— 44 Meer Sadik Beg is a vulgar but well disposed man, who treated us very hospitably. Neither he nor his sons could read the letter of Shah Shuja [which Conolly delivered to him] ; but having heard it perused, he stuck it in the top of his turban, and declared that he was His Majesty's servant to do anything that lay within his limit ed ability. We remarked that the chief service which His Majesty re quired from Huzara Meers was to keep their people loyally quiet. To this Sadik Beg replied that he should be truly glad to be quiet, both on the king's and his own account, if some of his Huzara neighbours and those dogs of Eimaks would only let him.'CENTRAL REGION:—THE CHAll EIMAKS, &amp;C. 177 Captain Conolly remonstrated with the chief, Meer Sadik, upon the disunion ^ hich prevailed amongst the Huzaras. He showed how, by uniting amongst themselves, the chiefs would he able to defend their respective possessions, and increase their cultivation and cattle. He also urged that they should col lect only fixed and moderate cus toms, which would induce traders between Herat and Cabul to take the direct route through their country. Meer Sadik acquiesced, and said that with God's blessing upon the benevo lent disposition of Shah Shuja, all that was desired would come to pass; and if Shah Shuja would only make him governor-in-chief of all the Huzara country, and send him a regiment of infantry and two cannons, he would keep the country between Herat and Cabul more open than it had been since the days of Mahmood of Ghuznee. War between the Eimaks and Huzaras.—At Deli Zingee Captain Conolly expected to have been joined by an Eimak escort 72 which Mahomed Azim Beg, the Atalik of the Firuzkuhi Eimaks, had agreed to furnish to Agha Hussein. The Atalik however had meantime engaged in a war against the Huzara chief of the Deh Koondees, and for some time the escort was not forthcoming. At length Captain Conolly was conducted by the son of the Atalik to a camp of the Eiruzkuhi on the right bank of the Hcri-rood. On the opposite bank, about half a mile off, was the fort of Dowlut Yar, surrounded by the tented camps of Teymooni Eimaks. Captain Conolly states that the Eiruzkuhi Eimaks had w 2178 turkomans^ char eimaks, and seistan. the advantage of the Huzaras in their personal appearance. They lived after the nomade fashion of the Turkomans and Ushegs, but in their features they resembled Persians rather than Tartars; and indeed claimed descent from a colony which was exported from Piroz Koh in the Persian province of Mazan- deran. Origin of the war.—Meantime the war be tween the chief of the Firozkuhi Eimaks and the chief of the Deh Koon- 73 dee Huzaras was brought to a close. The story of this war is worth relating as illustrative of the constant feuds which were being carried on in this quarter. It appears that it originated in an act of violence committed nine years before. Agha Hussein, the very man who was accompanying Conolly, had been plundered by the Eimak chief of Dowlut Yar whilst carrying a stock of goods from Herat to Cabul. This outrage was intended as a punishment, inasmuch as Agha Hussein had prefer red the quarters of the chief of the Firuzkuhi to those of the chief of Dowlut Yar. The chief of the Firuz- kuhi was unable to revenge this outrage on his guest, and permitted Agha Hus sein to call upon his Hazara friends for succour. Accordingly the chief of the Deh Koondee Huzaras marched against Dowlut Yar, captured and razed the fort ress and killed its chief, and then gave the old man's wife to his own brother, and took his daughter to himself. The result was that Agha Hussein recovered much of his plundered property. The re putation of the Eimak chief of the Piruzkuhi, however, suffered consider-A- D 1840- CENTRAL REGION:—THE CHAR EIMAKS, fee. 179 ably. Accordingly the latter tried to retrieve his character by supporting the son of the chief of Dowlut Yar, and helping him to rebuild the fortress, and then by making an attack on the Huzara chief of Deh Koondee. The quarrel, however, was accommodated in a way which soothed the wounded pride of the Eimak. The chief of Deh Koondee restored the arms which had been taken from Dowlut Yar, and finally closed the blood account by giving two or three daughters to the young heir of Dowlut Yar and his re latives. Agha Hussein then went to Dowlut Yar with a Koran, and solemnly absolved the young chief from all obligations to repair his former losses ; and the young chief swore in the same solemn way that bygones should be bygones. Signs of slave-dealing—The adventures of Captain Conolly on his road to Mai- mana refer either to the politics of the 74 day, which are now somewhat obsolete, or to encounters with robber chieftains, which are of mere personal interest. Some miles before reachingMaimana, he observed a sign that he was approach ing a slave mart, for an old man rode out of a small encampment and offered his horse for sale, saying that he would take a young male slave and a pony in return. Conolly remonstrated with him ; but he replied that he did not require an actual slave, but only the value of one; thus showing that men were a standard of barter just as sheep were among the Huzaras. The old man added that Heratees were a drug in the market, owing to the number180 tuukomans, char eimaks^ and seistan. which had been sold by Yar Mahomed Khan after the siege of Herat by the Persians ; that Huzaras were not in good demand; and that the only captives who fetched a good price were the young men and girls of Kaum or Ber- jend, or real Kuzzilbashes. Notices of the Shiah Huzaras by later tra vellers.—The accounts furnished by later travellers are little more than corroborations of what has been already stated. When General Ferrier tra velled through this neighbourhood in 1845, the most powerful chief of the Huzaras was named Hussan Khan ben Zorab. The authority of this chief was acknowledged by three separate tribes, and he could assemble five thousand horse and three thousand foot, and even double that number incase of emergency. ' It is not astonishing,' says General Ferrier, ' that these tribes should furnish so many soldiers, because the armed force simply signifies every adult male. All are capable of bearing arms, and in time of war no one remains in the camp but the old men, women, and children. The Huzaras of Hussan Khan ben Zorab are con stantly divided amongst themselves, either by the intrigues of subalterns, or by family quarrels. They are always scheming and plotting one against the other, and thus are ever exhausting that strength to their own detriment, which, if consolidated and well directed, would render them terrible to the Afghans, with whom they are constantly at war. Their country is difficult to invade, its natural defences being excellent; they could emergeA.

Such, how ever, is their disunion, that the Afghans always contrive to get through their passes and attack them on their own ground; but they cannot occupy the country permanently, and content them selves with carrying off as good a booty as possible. By this constant hostility, such a lively hatred is maintained between the Afghans and the Huzaras, that a lonely traveller venturing into their mountains would assuredly be assassinated.'* i m i : 1 1182 CHAPTER III.

Authorities for a history of Seistan.— Two Office Notes have already been drawn up on the relations of Seistan 76 with Afghanistan and Persia; namely, one, dated 20th December 1867, by Mr. Under Secretary Girdlestone, and the other, dated 17th Pebruary 1868, by myself. Since then the works of Perrier, Elphinstone and others have been carefully examined, and the results of the whole will now be incorporated in the present chapter. Face of the country.— Seistan is a flat country interspersed with low hills. It is situated on the banks of the Ilel- 77 mund, and comprises an area of not more than five hundred square miles. One-third of the surface is composed of moving sand, whilst the other two- thirds consist of a compact sand, mixed with a little clay, but very rich in vegetable matter, and covered with woods of the tamarish, saghes, tag, and reeds, in the midst of which there is abundant pasture. The lake of Seistan is formed by four rivers, namely, theSOUTHERN REGION :—SE1STAN. 183 A D-1800 Caravaa Journoys, pp: 396-401. Caravan Journeys, pp. 426-432. Karoot-rood, the Furrah-rood, the Khash-rood, and the Helmund. The hanks of these rivers are fertilized by yearly inundations and well cultivated ; whilst the rains accumulate in the low grounds, and furnish sufficient pasture tor the flocks of the nomade tribes who pitch their tents in this quarter during the winter season.* People of Seistan.— The greater part of the population consists of Belooches; the remainder is composed of Afghan 78 tribes and Arabs, with a few Turkish families and even Konds, who have been thrown hither by the waves of revolu tion and intestine feuds. The Belooches are independent savages always on the move. They have no written laws, but are governed by ancient usages and traditions. The authority of the chiefs is slight, and consists solely in settling the quarrels and misunderstandings that continually occur between the members of the same kheil, village, or encamp ment ; in selecting a camping ground; or fixing the relations which are to be maintained between the tribe and its neighbours. With these exceptions every Belooche is absolute in his family, t Political status of Seistan prior to 1800.—Previously to 1749 A. D., the province, equally with Afghanistan, 79 formed part of the Persian dominions. But in that year it was added to the new kingdom of Afghanistan by Ahmed Shah, the founder of the Sudozai dynasty. During the long reign of Ahmed Shah it remained subject to his authority; and it was only towards the close of the184 turkomans, char eimaks, and sei8tan. reign of his successor, Timoor Shah, that it attempted to shake off its allegi ance. On Timoor Shah's death its independence was complete, and it remained for many years unmolested either by Persia or Afghanistan. 'When in 1796 Aga Mahomed Khan subdued Khorassan and annexed that country to Persia, he left Seistan in undisturbed enjoyment of its freedom; and later, in 1810, when Captain Christie travel led through the province, he found it still governed by independent chiefs. Political status of Lash Jowein. To the north of Seistan lies the small district of Lash Jowein, whose history so and fortunes are intimately connected with those of the larger principality. When Seistan belonged to Persia, Lash Jowein was also Persian, and it appears to have been included with it in the new kingdom of Afghanistan by Ahmed Shah. In later days, however, it would seem not to have established its indepen dence so thoroughly as Seistan, for within the last thirty years there is proof of its having paid tribute to Herat, Progress of affairs under independent Chiefs, 1800-1834.—It appears from in formation obtained from Taj Mahomed, si the ex-chief of Seistan, who was a pri soner at Teheran in 1867, that in 1800 there were three chiefs in Seistan Bahrain Khan, Ameer Khan, Khan Jan Khan. Of these Bahram Khan was the most powerful, and the other two paid him homage, but no tribute. He assumed A D- 1800-1834. *SOUTHERN REGION :—SEISTAN. 185 A.

Mr. Elphinstone states that this Bahram Khan was descended, or reputed to be descended, from the an cient Persian kings of the Kaianian dy nasty, which included Cyrus and Darius. Bain am Khan,' he adds, cc is very ' sensi hle of the glory of so illustrious a descent,' and Mr. Elphinstone also alleges that these chiefs of Seistan paid a light tribute, and furnished a contin gent to the Ameer of Cabul.* Jellal-ood deen, Chief of Seistan, aided by Herat, 1834.—Jellal-ood-deen Khan, son of Bahram Khan, succeeded his 82 father. Subsequently he was expelled from Seistan, and sought assistance from Kamran, chief of Herat, who restored him to the throne, and carried off 10,000 people of Seistan as prisoners to Afghan istan. Ultimately the people again rose against Jellal-ood-deen; and Mahomed Beza Khan, son of Ameer Khan, ob tained his territory, and thus became chief of all Seistan, except the terri tory northward of the Helmund, which was held by the family of Khan Jan Khan. Hahomed Eeza Khan, independent, 1836.—This took place apparently in 1836, when Herat was besieged byss Mahmood Shah of Persia, and pre vented from assisting Jellal-ood-deen. When the English troops withdrew from Afghanistan after the Afghan war, Mahomed Beza Khan assisted Kohendil Shah in regaining Candahar. Also he aided the Ameer of Kayn against Persia. His brother, Ali Khan, was his minister. Y 2186 turkomans^ chae eimaks^ and seistan. Lootf Ali Khan prior to 1851.—Lootf A p i85i_i863 Ali Khan, son of Mahomed Reza Khan, succeeded his father.

He obtained Seistan by the assistance of Kohendil Khan of Candahar. Eor some years he is said to have reimed as an indepen- kter ibm P- dent chief. At length was he induced to place himself under the protection of Persia, and proffer allegiance to the Shah. He was ambitious of being connected by marriage with the royal house of Persia, and was invited to Teheran, and received with favor, and married to a Persian princess. Sub sequently on returning to Seistan he was accompanied by a Persian agent, and struck money in the Shah's name; print and a regiment was raised and drilled by a Persian instructor. These proceed ings rendered him unpopular with his people, and he was seized and murder ed by Taj Mahomed. Pretensions of Persia to the suzerainty of Seistan, 1853-1863.-—The proceed ings of Persia at this period are detailed 86 in Mr. Girdlestone's note as follows :—■ ' About the time of the English ex pedition into Afghanistan the Persian Government took advantage of the Afghans attention being diverted else where to renew their pretensions to sovereignty over Seistan * In 1853 • Sea sir h. g^'s letter No. 1326. the Persian standard was hoisted at the 2 3 ' at p ' ot tlle correspondence, capital, and the protection of that powerSOUTHERN REGION :—SEISTAN. 187 * See Mr. Watson's letter above quoted, p. 14 of the printed correspondence. f See his letter No. 60 at p. 1 of the printed correspondence. admitted at least by one or more of the chiefs. Kohendil Khan, at that time the ruler of Candahar, despatched an envoy to the Persian Court by way of remonstrance; bnt during the nego tiations which ensued Eohendil Khan died, the subject was dropped, and the Persian flag retained its position. It is probable that the claims of rival chiefs in Seistan made interference more easy by enabling the Shah to espouse the cause of one or other, in the hope of eventually re-establishing the old supre macy of Persia. Indeed,* in 1858 we learn that one aspirant after power pro cured the assistance of two Persian re giments on condition that, if successful, he should rule in the Shah's name. Unfortunately for the latter's object, the chief was put to death in the same year, but since that event the Persian Govern ment have never allowed any long interval to elapse without re-asserting its claim, Mr. Thomson, f Attache at Teheran, writing to the English Govern ment in June 1863, considered that the Persian Government had never taken upon themselves any direct interference in the local government of Seistan, nor had they exercised any real authority over the country, but had limited their efforts to a certain amount of indirect influence over the reigning chief by giving him pecuniary aid, and bj^ occa sionally conferring dresses of honor on subordinate chiefs who acknowledged his title. Subsequent events, however, seem to imply a very decided wish on the part of the Shah to establish a footing in Seistan under cover of protecting Taj Mahomed Khan, the reigning chief.188 TURKOMANS^ CHAR EIVEAKS, AND SEISTAN. from the inroads of the Afghans.* Taj Mahomed Khan has held the reins of gov ernment since 1861, having succeeded to power by killing his uncle, All Khan, the former chief, in a rebellion. His tendencies are evidently towards Persia, and as without external aid he has difficulty in maintaining his territory intact, he looks to Teheran for support. His greatest rival at home is Ahmed Khan,t governor of Lash Jowein, who has enormously increased his interest and influence in Seistan and Beloochistan during the last few years by marrying the daughter of Ibrahim Khan, a Belooche chief, whose prin cipal estates are on the eastern and southern sides of the Seistan Lake. Originally Ahmed Khan was also an ally of Persia. In 1856-57 he ac quiesced in the Lash fort being stored with grain by the Persian Govern- ment. t But his relations changed in time, and for some years he has thrown in his lot with Shere Ali Khan.' * See Mr. Thomson's letter No. 60 at p. 1 the Meshed agent's letter, 28th November 18fi4, at p 5 aud Sir H.

Recent progress of affairs in Seistan, 1863-68.—The subsequent progress of affairs in Seistan is fully related in ^ Mr. Girdlestone's memorandum, and it will only be necessary in the present place to submit a brief outline of events. In 1863 Taj Mahomed Khan was afraid that Seistan would be annexed by Dost Mahomed Khan, who had already cap- tured 1 urrah and was now laying siege to Herat; and at this moment the Shah's government re-asserted its claims to Seistan. In July 1863 it was ru moured that an Afghan force had march ed on Seistan and captured two forts;SOUTHERN REGION :—SEISTAN. 189 and in February 1861^ it was Reported that a Persian force would be stationed in Seistan to keep the roads open. It was not known until 18G6 that the force was actually sent, and then Taj Maho med Khan of Seistan, and Ahmed Khan of Lash Jowein were deputed to Teheran. In 1867 a further Persian force entered Seistan and erected a fort at Dustuck on the north bank of the Helmund, and at a little distance from the eastern shore of the Seistan Lake ; and it would then appear that the Persian suzerainty # Mr. Girdlestone's memorandum, passim. over S e i s tan Was thus finally asserted.* Action of the British Government- It appears that as far back as 1859 Mr. Murray remonstrated with Persia 88 on its interference in Seistan ; and that Lord Malmesbury alluded to it as an aggression; but that subsequently the Secretary of State for India regretted that Persia's claim on Seistan had been opposed. In 1863 Earl Eussel informed the Persian minister that Persia must settle with the Afghans about Seistan by force of arms. Taj Mahomed, 1861-1867: detained at Teheran—Meantime Taj Mahomed had succeeded Ali Khan. Being threatened 89 by Dost Mahomed, he applied to Persia for assistance; and it seems to have been understood that Persia con sidered Seistan to form an integral por tion of her dominions, and would resist any claims of the Afghans. Prom Mr. Alison's note submitted in April 1868, it would appear that the people of Seistan are opposed to Persia; that Taj Mahomed had a war with some Belooch chiefs; that Persian troops were sent z 2190 TURKOMANS, CHAR EIMAKS, AND SEISTAN. to his assistance; that Persia subse quently suspected his good faith, and invited him to Teheran, and detained him as a prisoner, where he still remains. The chief of Kayn is now in posses sion of Seistan ; and Kayn seems to be a part of Persia.* J. T alboys W heeler.

IN THE NAME of hoi who is ever necessary, who is all-sufficient, who is ever lasting, and who is the only protector. In these times distinguished by felicity, the Excellent Ambassador, Sir Harford Jones, Baronet, Member of the Honourable Imperial Ottoman Order of the Crescent, has arrived at the Royal City of Tehran, in quality of Ambassador from His Majesty the King of England (titles), bearing His Majesty's credential letter, and charged with full powers minuted with the Great Seal of England, empowering him to strengthen the friendship and consolidate the strict union subsisting between the High States of England and Persia. His Majesty the Kino' of Persia (titles) therefore, by a special firmaun delivered to the said Ambassador, has appointed the Most Excellent and Noble Lords Meerza Mahomed Sheffeeh, qualified with the title of Moatumed-ed-Dowlah, his first Vizier, and Hajee Mahomed Hossein Khan, qualified with the title of Ameen-ed-Dowlah, one of the Ministers of Record, to be his Plenipotentiaries to confer and discuss with aforesaid Ambassador of His Britannic Majesty all matters and affairs touching the formation and consolidation of friendship, alliance, and strict union between the two High States, and to arrange and finally conclude the same for the benefit and advantage of both kingdoms. In consequence whereof, after divers meetings and discussions, the aforesaid Plenipotentiaries have resolved that the following Articles are for the benefit and advantage of both the High States, and are hereafter to be accordingly observed for ever. A rticle 1. That as some time will be required to arrange and form a definite treaty of alliance and . friendship between the two High States, and as the circumstances of the world make it neces sary for something to be done without loss of time, it is agreed that these Articles, which are to be regarded as preliminary, shall become a basis for establishing a sincere and everlasting definitive Treaty of strict friendship and union; and it is agreed that the said definitive ^Treaty, precisely expressing the wishes and obligations of each party, shall be signed and sealed by the said Plenipotentiaries, and afterwards become binding on both the o High Contracting Parties, A rticle 2. It is agreed that these preliminary Articles formed with the hand of truth and sincerity shall not be changed or altered, but there shall arise from them a daily inciease of Tien s up, ® . n , P rene Kin-s, their heirs, successors, their sub- which shall last for ever between the two most seiene ivm 0 b, jects and their respective kingdoms, dominions, prov.nces and countries.

In case His Majesty the King of England should make peace with such European power. His Britannic Majesty shall use his utmost endeavours to negotiate and procure a peace between His Persian Majesty and such power. But if, which God forbidj His Britannic Majesty's efforts for this purpose should fail of success, then the forces of subsidy, according to the amount mentioned in the definitive Treaty, shall still continue in the service of the King of Persia, as long as the said European forces shall remain in the territories of His Persian Majesty, or until peace is concluded between His Persian Majesty and the said European power. And it is further agreed that, in case the dominions of His Britannic Majesty in India are attacked or invaded by the Afghans or any other power, His Majesty the King of Persia shall afford a force for the protection of the said dominions according to the stipulations contained in the definitive Treaty. A rticle 5.

A rticle 8. It is acknowledged, the intent and meaning of these preliminary Articles are defensive. And it is likewise agreed that as long as these preliminary Articles remain in force, His Majesty the King of Persia shall not enter into any engagements inimical to His Britannic Majesty, or pregnant with injury or disadvantage to the British territories in India. This lieaty is concluded by both parties in the hope of its being everlasting, and that it may be pioductive of the most beautiful fruits of friendship between the two most serene Kings.

Their Majesties the Empeioi of Russia and the King of Persia, actuated by their affec tions towards their respective subjects, are anxious to commute the present hostilities so repug nant to their disposition to an amicable understanding. With this view Lieutenant -General Ritischeuf, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief in Georgia, the line of Caucasus, Laghoor, and Astrachan, and Commander-in-Chief of the Caspian Fleet, Knight of the Order of Alexander Neuski, of the 1st Order of St. Anne, and 4th of the Military Order of St. George, and of the Sword of Bravery, is fully empowered to treat on the part of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia. His Excellency Mirza Abul Hussein Khan, late Ambassador to the Courts of Constanti nople and London, of noble descent, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., is appointed Plenipotentiary on the part of His Majesty the King of Persia. The Plenipotentiaries having met at the Russian camp on the banks of Zurion near Gnlistan in the District of Karabagh, and having exchanged their credentials in the name of their respective sovereigns whom they severally represent, hold themselves bound religiously to observe for ever the articles and conditions here entered into. Article 1. After the conclusion of this treaty the hostilities which have hitherto existed between the States of Russia and Persia shall cease, and peace shall be established between the respective sovereigns and their allies for ever. Article 2. The status quo ad presentem having been agreed on as the basis of treating in virtue of this arrangement, the several districts hitherto possessed by the respective States shall remain under their subjection, and the frontier is determined in the manner under written. The line of demarcation is to commence from the plain of Aduna Bazar, running direct towards the plain of Moghan to the ford of the Anas at luln Bulook, up the Anas to the junction of the Capennuk Chace at the back of the hill of Mekri; from thence the boundary of Karabagh and Nukshivan is from the mountains of Alighuz oi Dualighuz, and thence the boundary of Karabagh, Nackshivan Erivan, and also part of Georgia, and of Kuzah and Shums-ud-deen-Loo is separated by Eishuk Meidaun; from Eishuk Meidaun the line is the chain of mountains on the right and the river of Humya Chummun, and from the tops of the mountains of Alighuz it runs along the village of Shoorgil and between those of the village of Mystery until it reaches the livei of Arpachahi, and as the district of Talish during the hostilities has been partially subjected by the contending parties for the purpose of strengthening mutual confidence aftei the conclusion of the tieaty, Commissioners shall be appointed respectively, who, in concurrence with each other and wit the cognizance of the Governors concerned, shall determine what mountains, rivers, lakes, villages, and fields shall mark the line of frontier, having first ascertained the respective possessions at the time of making the treaty, and holding in view the status ^ ^ presenter as the basis on which the boundaries are to be determined. If the possessions of either the High Contracting Parties shall have been infringed on hy the above mentioned boundaries, the Commissioners shall rectify it on the bas.s of the quo ad presentem.xv111 Article 3. His Majesty the King of Persia, in demonstration of his amicable sentiments towards the Emperor of Russia, acknowledges in his own name and that of his heirs the sovereignty of the Emperor of Russia over the Provinces of Karabagh and Georgia, now called Elizabeth Saul, the Districts of Shekie Shirivan, Kobik, Dirbund Bakoobah, and such part of Talish as is now possessed by Russia, the whole of Daghistan, Georgia, the tract of Shooragib Achook, Bash Gooreea, Mingula, Abtichar, the whole country between the boundary at present established and the line of Caucasus, and all the territory between the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. Article 4. His Majesty the Emperor of Russia, actuated by similar feelings towards His Majesty of Persia, and in the spirit of good neighbourhood wishing the sovereign of Persia always to be firmly established on the throne, engages for himself and heirs to recognize the Prince who shall be nominated heir-apparent, and to afford him assistance in case he should require it to suppress any opposing party. The power of Persia will thus be increased by the aid of Russia. The Emperor engages for himself and heirs not to interfere in the dissensions of the Prince unless the aid of the Russian arms is required by the King of the time. Article 5. The Russian merchantmen on the Caspian Sea shall, according to their former practice, have permission to enter the Persian harbours, and the Persians shall render to the Russian Marine all friendly aid in case of casualties by storm or shipwreck. Persian merchantmen shall enjoy the same privilege of entering Russian harbours, and the like aid shall be afforded to the Persian Marine by the Russians in case of casualties by storm or shipwreck. The Russian flag shall fly in the Russian ships-of-war which are permitted to sail in the Caspian, as formerly ; no other nation whatever shall be allowed ships-of-war on the Caspian. Article 6. The whole of the prisoners taken either in battle or otherwise, whether Christians or of any other religion, shall be mutually exchanged at the expiration of three months after the date of the signature of the treaty. The High Contracting Parties shall give a sum to each of the prisoners for his expenses, and send them to Thara Ecclesia; those charged with the superin tendence of the exchange on the frontiers shall give notice to each other of the prisoners being sent to the appointed place, when they shall be exchanged; and any person who either voluntarily deserted or fled after the commission of a crime shall have permission to return to his country, or shall remain without molestation. All deserters who return to their country shall be forgiven by both contracting parties. Article 7. In addition to the above Articles, the two contracting sovereigns have been pleased to resolve to exchange Ambassadors, who at a proper period will be sent to their respective capitals, where they will meet with that honor due to their rank, and due attention shall be paid to the requests they may be charged to make. Mercantile agents shall be appointed to reside in the different cities for the purpose of assisting the merchants in carrying on their trade; they shall only letain ten followers; they shall be in no ways molested; they shall be treated with respect and attention, as parties of either nation injured in the way of trade may by their interference have their grievances redressed.xix Article 8. With rGg'ard to tliG intercoursG of caravans, the mercliants of either country must be provided with a passport that they may travel either by sea or land without fear, and indivi duals may reside in either country for the purpose of trade so long' as it suits their convenience, and they shall meet with no opposition when they wish to return home. In regard to mer chandise and goods brought from Russia to Persia, or sent from Persia to Hussia, the proprie tors may at their own discretion either sell or exchange them for other property. Merchants having occasion to complain of failure of payment or other grievances will state the nature of their cases to the mercantile agents; or, if there are none resident in the place, they will apply to the governor, who will examine into the merits of their representations, and will be careful that no injustice be offered to this class of men. Russian merchants having entered Persia with merchandise will have permission to convey it to any country in alliance with that State, and the Persian Government will readily furnish them a passport to enable them to do so. In like manner, Persian merchants who visit Russia will have permission to proceed to any country in alliance with Russia. In case of a Russian merchant dying in Persia, and his goods remaining in Persia, as they are the property of a subject of a friendly State, they shall be taken charge of by the proper constituted authorities, and shall be delivered over, on demand, to the lawful heirs of the deceased, who shall have permission to dispose of them. As this is the custom among all civilized nations, there can be no objection to this arrangement. Article 9. The duties on Russian merchandise brought to Persian ports shall be in the proportion of five hundred Dinars (5 per cent.) on property of the value of one Toman, which having been paid at one city, the goods may be conveyed to any part of Persia without any further demand of duty being made on any pretence whatever. The like percentage, and nothing more, will be paid on exports. The import and export duties from Persian merchants in Russia will be levied at the same rate. Article 10, On the arrival of goods at the seaport towns, or such as come by land carriage to the frontier towns of the two States, merchants shall be allowed to sell or exchange their goods without the further permission of the Custom House Officers, because it is the duty of Custom House Officers to prevent all sorts of delay in the prosecution of trade, and to receive the King s customs from the buyer or seller as may be agreed between them. Article 11. After the signature of this treaty the respective Plenipotentiaries shall immediately announce the peace to the different frontier posts and oidei the suspension of hostilities; and two copies of this treaty being taken with Persian translations, they sha je signed and sealed by the respective Plenipotentiaries, and be exchanged. They must t ion jo ratified by the signatures of their Majesties of Russia and Persia, and the ratifications sha be exchanged in the course of three months.

The boundary of the two States being here marked by the ridge of the mountains, it is agreed that their declivity on the side of Talische shall belong to Russia, and the opposite declivity to Persia. From the ridge of the heights of Djikoir, the frontier shall proceed as far as the summit of Kamar Konia, the mountains which separate Talyche from the District of Archa. The ridges of the mountains forming the separation on both sides, the course of the rivers shall determine here the frontier line in the same manner as is above indicated in regard to the distance com prised between the source of Odinabagar and the heights of Djikoir. The frontier line shall then proceed from the summit of Karma Konia, the ridge of mountains separating the District of Gouvant from that of Archa, to the limits of Weikedge, always conformably to the principle laid down respecting the course of the rivers; the District of Gouvant, with the exception of the portion situated on the opposite side of the apex of the said mountains, shall thus fall to the share of Russia. From the limits of the District of Welkedo-e, the frontier line between the two States shall follow the summits of Klopontz and the principal chain of mountains which intersect the District of Welkedge as far as the northern source of the river called Astara, always observing the princi ple regarding the course of the rivers; thence the frontier shall follow the bed of that stream to its embouchure in the Caspian Sea, and com plete the line of demarcation which shall hence forward separate the respective possessions of Russia and Persia. A rticle 5. His Majesty the Shah of Persia in testimony of his sincere friendship for His Majesty the Em peror of all the Russias, solemnly recognizes by the present Article, in his own name and in that of his heirs and successors to the throne of Persia, the appertainment for ever to the Empire of Russia of all the countries and islands situated between the line of demarcation indicated by the preceding Article on one side, and the ridge of the Caucasian Mountains and the Caspian Sea on the other, as also the wandering tribes who inhabit those territories.

It is agreed between tbe two high contracting parties that the amount of this indemnity is fixed at ten crores of tomans, or thirty millions of silver roubles, and that the mode, time, and guarantee in respect to the payment of this sum shall be regulated by a separate arrangement. Article 7. His Majesty the Shah of Persia having deemed it expedient to nominate as his successor and heir presumptive hi? august son, the Prince Abbas Mirza, His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, with a view to afford to His Majesty the Shah of Persia a public testimony of his amicable disposition, and of his desire to contri bute towards the consolidation of this order of succession, engages to recognize henceforward in the august person of His Royal Highness the Prince Abbas Mirza, the successor and heir pre sumptive of the Crown of Persia, and to consider him as the legitimate sovereign of that kingdom from the moment of his accession to the throne. Article 8. Russian merchant vessels shall enjoy as former ly the right of navigating in freedom the Caspian Sea, and of landing on its coasts. They shall find in Pei'sia aid and assistance in case of ship wreck. The same right is granted to Persian merchant vessels of navigating on the ancient footing the Caspian Sea, and of landing on the Russian banks, where in case of shipwreck the Persians shall receive aid and assistance recipro cally. With respect to ships-of-war, those carry ing the Russian military colours being ah antiquo the only vessels which have had the right of navigating the Caspian Sea, that exclusive pn- vilege is for this reason now equally reserved and secured to them, so that, with the exception of Russia, no other power shall be able to have ships- of-war in the Caspian Sea. Article 9. His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias and His Majesty the Shah of Persia cordially desirous of drawing closer by every means the bonds so happily re -established between them, have agreed that the Ambassadors, Ministers, and Charges d ; Affaires who may be reciprocally dele- o-ated to the respective high courts, whether on a temporary mission, or for the purpose of residing there permanently, shall be received with the honors and distinctions due to their rank, and suited to the dignity of the high contracting parties, as well as to the sincere friendship which unites them and the usages_ of the countues. In this respect the ceremonials to be observed on both sides shall be agreed upon by means of a special Protocol.XXV Gouvernemens reciproques tombes en captivite a quelque epoque que ce soit, seront tous librement rendus dans le terme de quatre mois, et apres avoir ete pourvus de vivres et autres objets necessaires, il seront diriges sur Abbas Abaci pour y etre remis entre les mains des Commissaires, respectivement charges de les reeevoir et d'aviser a leur renvoi ulterieur dans leurs foyers. Les hautes parties contractantes en useront de meme a regard de tous les prisonniers de guerre, et de tous les sujets Russes et Persans reciproquement tombe's en captivity que n'auraient pas ete restitues dans le terme sus -mentionne, soit en raison de Teloigne- nient ou ils seraient trouves, soit par toute autre cause ou eirconstance. Les deux Gouverne mens se reservent expressement le droit illimite de les reclamer en tout terns, et ils s^obligent a les restituer mutuellement a mesure qiv'il s'en presentera, ou a mesure quails les reclameront. A rticle 14. Les hautes parties contraetantes n'exigeront pas ^extradition des transfuges et deserteurs qui auraient passe sous leur dominations respectives avant ou pendant la guerre. Toutefois, pour prevenir les consequences mutuellement prejudiciables qui pourraient resulter des intelligences, que quelques-uns de ces transfuges chercheraient a entretenir avec leurs anciens compatriotes ou vassaux, le G ouverne- ment Persan s^engage a ne pas tolerer dans ^es possessions, situees entre FAraxe, et la ligne formee par la riviere dite Teh an, par le lac d'Oronmiah, par la riviere dite Djikaton, et par la riviere dite Hizri Ozane, jusqu^a son confluent dans la mer Caspienne, la presence des fhdividus, qui lui seront nominalement designes maintenant, ou qui lui seraient signales a Tavenir. Sa Majeste PEmpereur de toutes les Russies pro- met egalement de son cote, de ne pas permettre que les transfuges Persans sMtablissent, ou res- tent k demeure, dans les Khanats de Karabaugh et de Nacktehivan, ainsi que dans la partie du Khanat d ; Erivaii situee sur la rive droite d TAraxe.

Pour ce qui coneerne la masse de la population dans les deux pays, il est convenu entre les hautes parties contractantes que les sujets respectifs, qui auraient passe, ou qui passeraien't a Pavenir (Pun dtat dans I'autre, seront libres de sMtablir, on de sejourner partout ou le trouvera bon le Gouvernement, sous la domination duquel ils se seront places. may have fallen into captivity at any period whensoever, shall all be freely delivered over within the term of four months, and after having been supplied with provisions and other neces 0 - sary articles, they shall be sent to Abassabad to be there made over to the Commissioners respectively deputed to receive them and to take measures for their conveyance to their homes. [u S h contracting parties will adopt the same course in regard to all prisoners of war, and all Russian and Persian subjects reciprocally found in captivity who may not have been restored within the term above-mentioned, either bv reason of the distance at which they may have been, or owing to any other cause or circumstance whatever. The two governments expressly re serve to themselves the unlimited right of claim ing them at any time, and they bind themselves to restore them reciprocally as soon as they shall present themselves, or shall be claimed. Article 14. The high contracting parties shall not demand the surrender of refugees and deserters who may have passed under their respective dominations before or during the war. With a view however to prevent mutually the prejudicial consequences which might result from the communication which some of these refugees may maintain with their old compatriots, the Persian Government engages not to tolerate within its possessions situated between the Araxes cind the line formed by the river called Tehan, the Lake of Oroomiah, the river of Djikaton, and by the river named Higil Ogane, as far as its confluence with the Caspian Sea, the presence of the individuals who shall be _ designated by name now, or who may be so indicated here after. His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias promises equally on his part not to permit Persian refugees to settle in the khanats of Karabagh and'Nacktehivan, as well as in the portion of the khanat of Erivan situated on the right bank of the Araxes. It is understood, however, that this clause is not, and shall not be, obligatory except in regard to individuals invested with a public character, or of a certain dignity, such as Khans, Begs, %nd Spiritual Chiefs or Mollahs, whose personal example, instigations, and elan- destine communications might have a prejudicial influence on their old compatnots. As fai as concerns the mass of the population in the two countries, it is agreed between the high eontract- ino&gt; parties that their respective subjects who might have already passed, or who may hereafter pass from one State into the other, shall be free to settle or sojourn wherever the government under whose authority they may place themselves shall deem proper.xxvi * Article 15.

Signed by the Plenipotentiaries of the High Contracting Parties, Camp Tur- komanchia, the 21st February 1828. Article 15. With the benevolent object of restoring tran quillity to their States, and removing from their subjects all that can aggravate the evils inflicted on them by the war to which the present treaty has so happily put an end, His Majesty the Shah grants a full and entire amnesty to all the inhabi tants and functionaries of the Province called Azerbegan. None of them, without any exception, shall be persecuted or molested for his opinions, acts, or conduct, either during the war or during the temporary occupation of the said Province by the Russian troops. There shall be granted to them farther the term of one year from this date to remove freely with their families from the Persian dominions into the Russian States, to export or to sell their property without the slightest opposi tion on the part of the government, or the local authorities, or the imposition of any duty or fee on the effects or articles sold or exported by them. With regard to their immoveable property, a period of five years shall be granted to them for its sale or disposal, according to their pleasure. From this amnesty are excepted those who may be guilty, within the period above-mentioned of one year, of any crime or misdemeanour liable to penalties inflicted by the tribunals. Article 16. Immediately after the signature of the present treaty of peace, the respective Plenipotentiaries shall lose no time in transmitting to every quarter the necessary advices and instructions for the immediate cessation of hostilities. The present t^paty drawn up in two parts of the same tenor, signed by the respective Pleni potentiaries, impressed with their seals, and ex changed between them, shall be confirmed and ratified by His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias and His Majesty the Shah of Persia, and the solemn ratifications bearing their own signatures shall be exchanged between their Plenipotentiaries within the term of four months, or earlier if possible.

Article 6. His Majesty the Shah of Persia agrees to relinquish all claims to sovereignty over the territory and city of Herat and the countries of Afghanistan, and never to demand from the Chiefs of Herat, or of the countries of Afghanistan, any marks of obedience, such as the coinage, or ' khotbeh,' or tribute. His Majesty further engages to abstain hereafter from all interference with the internal affairs of Afghanistan. His Majesty promises to recognize the independence of Herat and of the whole of Afghanistan, and never to attempt to interfere with the independence of those States. In cases of differences arising between the Government of Persia and the countries of Herat and Afghanistan, the Persian Government engages to refer them for adjustment to the friendly offices of the British Government, and not to take up arms unless those friendlv offices fail of effect. The British Government on their part engage at all times to exert their influence with the States of Afghanistan, to prevent any cause of umbrage being given by them or by any of them, to the Persian Government: and the British Government, when appealed to by the Persian Government, in the event of difficulties arising, will use their best endeavours to compose such differences in a manner just and honourable to Persia. Article 7. In case of any violation of the Persian frontier by any of the States referred to above, the Persian Government shall have the right, if due satisfaction is not given, to undertake military opciations for the repression and punishment of the aggressors ; but it is distinctly understood and agreed to, that any military force of the Shah which may cross the frontier for the above-mentioned purpose, shall retire within its own territory as soon as its object is accomplished, and that the exercise of the above-mentioned right is not to be made a pretext for the permanent occupation by Persia, or for the annexation to the Persian dominions, of any town or portion of the said States.

The high contracting parties engage that, in the establishment and recognition of Consuls General, Consuls, V ice-Consuls, and Consular Agents, each shall be placed in the dominions of the other on the footing of the most favoured nation; and that the treatment of their respective subjects and their trade shall also, in every respect, be placed on the footing of the treatment of the subjects and commerce of the most favoured nation.xx1s A rticle 10. Immediately after the ratifications of this treaty have been exchanged, the British Mission shall return to Tehran, when the Persian Government agrees to receive it with the apologies and ceremonies specified in the separate note signed this day by the Plenipoten tiaries of the high contracting parties. A rticle 11. The Persian Government engages, within three months after the return of the British Mission to Tehran, to appoint a Commissioner, who, in conjunction with a Commissioner to be appointed by the British Government, shall examine into, and decide upon, the pecuniary claims of all British subjects upon the Government of Persia, and shall pay such of those claims as may be pronounced just, either in one sum or by instalments, within a period not exceeding one year from the date of the award of the Commissioners. And the same Commis sioners shall examine into, and decide upon, the claims on the Persian Government of all Persian subjects, or the subjects of other powers, who, up to the period of the departure of the British Mission from Tehran, were under British protection, which they have not since renounced. A rticle 1^. Saving the provisions in the latter part of preceding Article, the British Government will renounce the right of protecting hereafter any Persian subject not actually in the em ployment of the British Mission, or of British Consuls General, Consuls, A ice-Consuls, or Consular Agents, provided that no such right is accorded to, or exercised by, any other foreign powers; but in this, as in all other respects, the British Government requires, and the Persian Government engages, that the same privileges and immunities shall in Persia be conferred upon, and shall be enjoyed by, the British Government, its servants and its subjects, and that the same respect and consideration shall be shown for them and shall be enjoyed by them as are conferred upon, and enjoyed by, and shown to, the most favoured foreign Government, its servants and its subjects.

POPULATION. The population and general resources of this country have always been over-estimated. Extending for 700 miles from north to south, and 900 miles from east to west, Persia contains an area of 648 000 square miles; but an immense extent of its superficies is absolute deseit, an the population is everywhere so scanty that it only gives about seven inhabitants to the square mile In some parts it is even much less than this. TaHng Kerman, for mstauce which i one of the largest provinces in the south of Persia, we find that it_ contoins about 73,000 square miles with a population of only 207,000, which gives something less than three i - V, K't nt, to the square mile/ It is a difficult matter to reconcile the extravagant statements habitants to q conflicti OI)in;ons advanced by Europeans, respecting the number 7 , I aTv ^cu district. To those who have travelled through Persia, and especially of inhabitants ^ ^'om the ordinary Hues of traffic, it must be obvious, however, in such parts re ^ t _ The calcu l a tion B made by natives are for the that great mls ®'® ep 1 from xq ^ OO ^ OO to estimates which are preposterous, most part worthless.

Allowing- 150,000 more for the other small towns, we have 1 ,000,000 as the total population of all the cities and towns in Persia. More than half of the remaining population belongs to the Turkish, Lek, Koordish, and Arab tribes which are spread over the whole of the Persian territory. In some provinces, such as Khorassan, and in the districts contiguous to the Turkish and Russian frontiers, nearly the entire population belongs indeed to one or other of these numerous tribes. A full account of them is given in Sir Justin ShiePs published JVotes on Persian Eelyats; and, according to that paper, they amount to about 340,000 families, or 1,700,000 souls. This is a liberal computation of their numbers, as Persians themselves admit; and if for -the rest of the inhabitants we add an equal number, we have for the whole population of Persia :— Inhabitants of cities ... ... &lt; j qqq qqq Population belonging to tribes ... ... ... 1 700 000 Remaining inhabitants ... ... ... t IjVoo'ooO T otal ... 4,400,000 The general accuracy of this calculation may be tested thusThe population of the Province of Kerman is known with tolerable certainty. In an official return lately furnished to the Persian Government by the local authorities there, a full report is made on the condition of the province. It is divided into twenty-five districts, and each district is described in detail with reference to its position, climate, produce, and population. According to this document, the total number of inhabitants, not including Persian Belooehistan is 207 000 The amount of revenue paid annually is 210,000 tomans, which gives about 1 toman for'each individual. It may reasonably be assumed that the rate of Government taxation is pretty much the same all over Persia, though the amount actually raised in different localities by illeo&gt; a l exactions doubtless varies considerably; but in order further to verify the above estimate I have made inquiries respecting the authorized taxes collected from several villages in dif ferent provinces, and I find that they average from 500 to 600 tomans in cash for 100 families^ which allows about 1 toman for each person. The aggregate revenue of Persia paid in money being about 4,361,000 tomans, it would therefore appear that the entire population cannot be much m excess of 4,2o0,000, as stated above. It is true that the majority of the inhabitants of the principal towns in Persia pay no taxes. These may be reckoned at 500,000; but the amount of revenue derived from the Customs, which is 536,000 tomans, has to be deducted on the other hand, as it is not levied from the provinces by direct taxation. REVENUES. During the reign of the present Shah the revenues of Persia have been increased by nearly 3i crores of tomans, or 694,000/. They now amount to 4,361,660 tomans, or 1 744 664/ m money, besides payments in kind, consisting of barley, wheat, rice, and silk valued at 550,840 tomans, or 220,336/, making the total revenue of Persia equal to 4,912,500 tomans or 1,965,000/. 3 'xxx111 The following- return shows the revenue demanded present year :— Ispahan Pars Kennan Yezd Mazanderan Ghllan Cazveen Khemseh Azerbijan Koordistan and Gerroos Khorassan, with Shahrood and Bestain Asterahad Kermanshah, with Looristan and Nehavend Arabistan Booroojird Gulpaigan Cashan Koom Tehran and adjacent districts...

The Shah does not, however, receive the whole of this revenue. From Khorassan, for instance, nothing is paid to the Royal Treasury, owing to the heavy disbursements made in that province for military service, and for the protection of the line of frontier by a large body of irregular troops employed in repelling the inroads of Turkoman marauders; and during the last year, in consequence of the failure of the silk crop in Ghilan, the revenue of that province has been reduced by more than 100,000 tomans. The provincial Governors, moreover, are frequently defaulters to a large amount. When appointed, they undertake to account to the Central Government for the sums specified above; bat it often happens that at the end of the year's tenure of office there is a large deficit which they declare they have been unable for some reason or other to collect from their districts. A fee is then paid to the financial author ities in Tehran; and the Shah is persuaded to remit a large portion of the deficit which has in reality been received from the peasants, and is eventually shared by the defaulter and his protector at Court. SOURCES OF REVENUE. The revenue of Persia is derived from the following sources 1 —Imposts on Crown lands and private landed property. These, so far as they are established and authorized by Government, may be considered on the whole fan- and moderate.

This is not exacted from the inhabitants of towns, who may be said to be exempt from all direct taxation. 5.—Rates levied upon shop-keepers, artizans, and tradespeople, which are fixed at about 20 per cent, on their annual profits and duties, exacted for all provisions brought to market in the principal towns. In theory, these are the taxes authorized by the Persian Government, but in practice a very complicated and irregular system of taxation is pursued, the main feature of which appears to be that it is designed solely with a view to take as little as possible from the wealthy and influential classes, and to get as much as possible from the hard-working peasant. The object, indeed, of all Persian Governors and their subordinates, as well as of the land owners generally, is to avoid simplicity; for the more intricate and uncertain the method employed for levying taxes, the greater are the opportunities afforded for extortion and all sorts of illegal exactions. Instead, therefore, of simply adhering to the above rates, by which the revenue is made to depend upon the actual produce yielded from the land, a sum, often arbitrarily fixed, is demanded from each village, without any reference to failure of crops, insufficiency of water for irrigation, disease amongst their flocks, or other losses to which the peasant may be subjected. The amount to be demanded is determined from time to time by Government assessors, momeiyez,' who are despatched to the various districts to assess the taxes whenever the authorities may feel disposed to alter their amount. The assessor is supposed to perform this duty in accordance with the rates authorized by Go vernment, but great injustice is done on such occasions, as he invariably demands a large fee befoie giving his decision, and over-estimates the taxes if it is refused, or undervalues them when liboially paid. If the land belongs to an influential person, when taxed at all, the amount is made very trifling, and, in numerous instances, villages which have not been assessed for many} ears continue to pay only a nominal sum, though they may have increased in size and wealth, simply on account of the proprietor's high position, while others, which have become impoverished, are compelled to pay all the taxes imposed under more prosperous''■Ml HI* XXXV conditions. Nothing can be more nnfair than this system, for Persian villages undergo rapid changes, caused not nnfrequently by oppression, and often from the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient supply of water for irrigation. But even when, for the reasons just stated, the taxes are highly assessed, the peasants gain nothing unless they are the owners of the laud themselves, for the full imposts are exacted and ultimately paid either to the local author ities or to the proprietor of the village, or to the person who may hold it in teule or fief, if Crown property, from the Persian Government. In such cases the Government is, in reality, the loser. Under a more rational system the Persian revenues might be greatly increased, with less hardship to the peasants, whose taxes are now so irregular and uncertain that they scarcely know from year to year what their liabilities are. Scarcely any of the inhabitants of towns, or persons of rank in Persia, are called upon to contribute towards the expenses of the State. None of the Princes, Officers of State, or employes of the Government pay any direct taxes. They maintain immense establishments in town, and possess large houses and gardens in the country, and yet pay no share of the Government expenditure, nor do owners of caravan serais, baths, mills, houses, or shops contribute anything either to the Royal Treasury, or on account of municipal taxes. A deduc tion of 20 per cent., it is true, has for some years been made on all Government salaries, but this is not so much a tax as a reduction of the public expenditure. The same may be said of a stamp duty of 21 kerrans which is exacted on all receipts given for salaries paid by the Government. Both these charges bear heavily upon the poorly paid employe and are not felt by the higher Persian officials, whose incomes are chiefly derived, not from fixed salaries, but from illicit fees and perquisites. It is evident, therefore, that the burthen of taxation falls upon the agricultural and poorer classes, who are systematically oppressed on account of the revennes and illegal taxes, whilst not a fraction of the sums extorted from them is expended on public works, likely hereafter to benefit the nation at large, and private individuals alone profit by the present unjust system of financial administration. /? xi ^ j It is impossible to discover what the people really do pay m excess of the fixed assessment. Some pretend that the irregular exactions amount to a sum eqnal to the legal assessment, and there docs not appear to be any reason for supposing that this is an exaggeration. An idea may be formed of the extent to which they are carried with the connivance of the Government, from L-r that the Governor of Fars is authorized to demand over and above the usual revenue for Ss II use 75,000 tomans a year, and the Governor of Ispahan 60,000 tomans as ' Hek e Hekoomeh' or Governor's fee. The former likewise pays 60,000 tomans and the lattei 40, torn! under the name of ' Pceshkesh,' or an offering made to the Kmg for their appoint- merits and by these payments they no doubt consider that they have purchased the right to i-'S'i.-i—•'-i topn. rebellion, few inquiries are made as to how their duties are discharge . •, 4 Revenue paid by Mahometan, all the revenue of Persia is contri u e y ie Mahometan subjecte of the Shah.

When the Russian troops withdrew from that city in 1828, the Christians resolved to accompany them to Georgia, but the English Envoy persuaded them to remain on the promise of exemption from all taxation. A Firmaun to this effect was issued by Abbass Mirza, which has been renewed by the present Shah and the heir-apparent. Revenue paid hy Jews.—There are about 16,000 Jews residing in different parts of Persia.

Said to be much oppressed. Much more has been exacted for'many years, but last summer their condition was improved. In all the provincial districts the Jews are more or less persecuted, and in places where the taxes are light, it is owing more to their extreme poverty than to the forbearance of the authorities. As a general rule all over Persia, as much is taken from the Jews as can possibly be extorted from them. In Meshed, twenty-five years ago, the Jews were all forcibly con verted to Islamism, and many were massacred in the struggle which then took place; ^ and in Barferoosh, in 1866, a number of Jews were cruelly massacred, and an attempt, which was nearly successful, was made to force them to become Mahometans. In places where they are not protected by the presence of European officials, they are liable at any time to be subjected to similar acts of violence and outrage. Revenue mid hy Caeires.—The Guebres, or Parsees, in Persia, number 1,200 families, or 7 193 persons They reside m Yezd and Kerman, where they are well treated by the inhabi tants and authorities. A sum of 907 tomans is paid annually to the Government in Tehran by their agent for the taxes due by the whole community, and no other demands made upon them. The Christians, Jews, and Guehres in Persia are exempt from all military service. ^^.-Small as is the revenue of Persia, it is in excess of the expendi ture as will be perceived from the following statement of disbursements; a sm plus at least 1 crore of tomans, or 200,000;., is left annually, which is paid into the Sha s own Treasury.XXXV111 A nnual E xpenditure.

The Persian army, according to the official returns in the Office of the Minister for War, is said to consist of— Regular Cavalry ... ' 500 Artillery Infantry Irregular Cavalry 5,000 70,000 30,000 T otal ... 105,500 Of the above troops, however, only about one-third are employed on active service, and the standing army of Persia may, therefore, be more accurately described as consisting of— 500 10,000 Artillery Infantry Irregular Cavalry T otal ... 30,000 Infantry. The remainder form a kind of reserve. The men are allowed to reside in their own villages and districts, where they arc, for the most part, engaged in agricultural pursuits, and subject to no drill or military discipline; the infantry and artillery being, indeed, usually disarmed when placed on this footing. They, ^ well as the Irregular Cavalry, are at t.Vt 0Ut atany moment; ' andit ma y be repeatedly, on the requisition of the Minister for Mar. The usual period during which they are required to serve is three years, u is is not strictly adhered to. Each regiment is supposed to muster 1,000 men. I lira* j Sultans amT, no Sergejntxxxix officers and soldiers included, though the number of privates rarely exceeds 600 in reality. While not employed on service, the Persian Government allows to each soldier half his nett pay, or 3i tomans a year, which is seldom, however, paid to him, and the officers above the rank of Sultan or Captain receive full pay, and, in some instances, their allowances also. The late Ameer-i-Nizam raised the Persian army about nineteen years ago to 94 regiments of infantry, and of these, one-third was usually on active service, but after a few years the force was reduced to its present strength. The infantry is now composed of 70 regiments. Each regiment is commanded by a Third Serteep... ... Colonel. 1 or 2 Serhengs ... ... Lieutenant-Colonels. 2 Yavers ... ... Majors. 8 Sultans ... ... Captains. 1 Adjudan ... ... Adjutant. 8 Nayebs ... ... Lieutenants. 8 Second Nayebs ... ... Second Lieutenants. Exceptions with respect to the first of these officers are sometimes made, and a regiment may occasionally be commanded by a Second Serteep (Brigadier-General), a First Serteep (Major-General), or even by a Serheng, if he belongs to an influential tribe. In the Persian army, no one below the rank of Serheng occupies the social position enjoyed by officers of similar standing in Europe. They are, for the most part, men without education, and would not be permitted to seat themselves in the presence of one of the Shah's Ministers or any Persian official of rank. All regiments on active service, if they have the full complement of men, are further composed of— 32 Corporals. 1 Jevrali (Surgeon.) 1 Colour-bearer. 4 or 8 Sergeant-Majors. 5 Colour Sergeants. 32 Sergeants.

No soldier or labouring man can subsist in Persia on less than 8 shahees (4c?.) a day, or 15 tomans a year.xl A Second Serteep commands two regiments and receives 980 tomans pay with the usual allowances; and a First Serteep commands five regiments and receives 1,200 tomans nett pay, besides allowances. Ten regiments form a division, which is commanded by an Ameer Toman, whose pay is 2,400 tomans a year. In each division, the first regiment is composed of Grena diers, ' Behaderan,' and the tenth of Chasseurs, ' Mokhberan' These regiments are organized by provinces, tribes, or districts. A province furnishes several regiments ; a tribe gives one, and sometimes two ; and a district contributes one batta lion to the army. The commanding officers are almost invariably selected from the Chiefs of the tribe or district from which the regiment is raised. Every appointment in the Persian army, from that of a General to the promotion of a Corporal, is disposed of to the highest bidder. The amount received for the more important post is either paid to the Crown or to the Minister for War, while the sums demanded for inferior appointments constitute a small portion of the emoluments of the commanding officers. For all the higher grades in the regiment, the Chiefs of the tribe to which it belongs are sure thus to have the preference, as it is easier for them than for a stranger to enforce payment of unauthorized exactions in their own dis tricts, and they can, therefore, afford to pay larger sums for their places. They have no diffi culty in reimbursing themselves, for when the regiment is raised, or recruits are required for the ranks, the commanding officers have full power to call for any number they please, and, by exempting all those who can pay, a very considerable amount is at once obtained, though' the consequence of this must necessarilv be that the regiment is formed from the most worthless characters to be found in the tribe. Besides few regiments on service anywhere but at the capital have more than 600 men (privates) on duty, if so many, the remainder being permitted to absent themselves by the Colonel, wdio then draws their pay and allowances from the Gov ernment on his own a ccount. There are many other abuses of the same nature which are tolerated, and even openly connived at by the Persian authorities, but it would be tedious to enumerate them. They are common to all the other departments of the Persian Government and are not likely to be abolished unless the whole system of administration in Persia is^ however, altered and reformed. The Persian soldier's pay is usually in arrears, though it is eventually paid to him while he is on active service, some small deductions being occasionally made by the Colonel of his regiment. His allowances for rations are paid with tolerable regularity. The force now on duty in various parts of Persia consists of— In Tehran „ Khorassan „ Asterabad ,, Tabreez „ Ispahan ,, Sheeraz 6 regiments. 3 3 2 1 regiment. 1 In Kermanshah... ... ... 1 regiment. Kerman ... ... ... i 0 Seistan ^ ... ... ... 2 regiments. On special service ... ... 2 „ T otal ... 22 The Persian troops are armed with old-fashioned French muskets, which are purchased in Pans for about 2a francs each, old muskets purchased in England twenty years ao-o and a few thousand which have been made in Tehran. Each soldier receives annually two unifoims, one of coarse woollen, and the other of coarse cotton cloth. Staff. There is a general staff at Tehran composed of Generals, Colonels, and Majors, but their appointments are icgulated more by payment and favor than by merit. The officers, generally, in the Persian army are said to be most ignorant and inefficient. The soldiers.ccmarasEsfl no i. xli however, are described as being obedient, sober, intellig'ent, and capable of enduring' great fatigue.* For infantry drill and manoeuvre, the system adopted in Persia is that used in France, with certain modifications. The only books which they have for the instruction of the troops are translations made from l^uropean works by the French officers who were employed here from 1857 to 1863, and by the Italian instructors, three in number, who are now in Tehran. Cavalry. —It is impossible to ascertain the number of Irregular Cavalry which the Persian Government could muster on an emergency. During ordinary times each tribe has to furnish a certain number of horsemen whenever they are required, and, while employed on active service, each receives from 15 to 25 tomans a year from the Government. The following is a list of the force which is thus available under the requisition of the Minister for War :— P ersian I eeegttlae C avalet.

The men are armed with such weapons as they can procure ior themselves. Most of them carry the long -barrelled Persian flint gun, mounted on a thin, awkwardly made stock, or lances, and many have swords and pistols besides. Artillery. —It is said that there are large numbers of cannon stored in the Persian arsenal, but it is probable that there are not more than a hundred in the whole country mounted and fit for service. With the exception of eight rifled guns (carrying a 41b. ball), cast and bored in Tehran on the model of a small Belgian rifled gun brought to Persia five years ago, these cannon are all smooth-bored, and of small calibre, varying from 6 to 12 lbs. Zembooreks. —There is also a small detachment of Zembooreks which ought perhaps to be noticed as forming a part of the Persian military force. They are mounted on camels, and are armed with light swivel 21b. guns fastened to the pack saddles on winch they ride. Some * Persian soldiers marcb twenty-four and twenty-six miles frequently wben merely changing stations. Last summer wben travelling witb tbe Shab 's camp in Kborassan, I saw several regiments perform stages of twenty-four miles for davs together and on one occasion they marched thirty-six miles over a sandy desert in the pUin of Tankhas ^^. ^p rf wller oa the road, and under a burning sun. when the thermometer stood at 102° m a double-fly Indian tent.xlii years ago this camel artillery numbered 600 men, but they are now reduced to 200. They are perfectly useless as at present armed, and are only intended as an escort for the Shah; but if they were furnished with the long rifles (Shamkhals) used by the Afghans, they might be formidable when employed against the Turkomans, or any irregular troops. COMMERCE. The whole external trade of Persia may be roughly valued at 4,000,000^. sterling annually, of which 2,500,000/. may be taken as the value of the imports, and 1,500,000/. as that of the exports, a diminution in the latter to the extent of nearly 1,000,000/. sterling having taken place within the last three years, owing to the failure of the silk produce of Ghilan. This is, of course, stated only approximatively, for statistics, as understood by Europeans, do not exist in Persia; the Government itself even being without any precise information as to the extent or value of foreign or internal trade, which has, therefore, to be obtained from persons employed in the Custom House, or from European merchants, and their statements are not always to be relied upon. The imports from Europe and India to Persia consist of cotton manufactures, cloth, silks, cotton yarns, cochineal, sugar, tea, jewellery, cutlery, china, crystal, glass-ware, iron, brass, and copper in sheets, tin, paper, indigo, and firearms; and the exports, of raw silk, raw cotton, tobacco, opium, wheat, gall nuts, wool, furs, madder root, dried fruits, shawls of inferior quality, and coarse calico for the Kussian and Turkish markets. Trade with Europe from Azerhijan. —The merchandise imported from Europe through Tabreez by way of Trebizonde and Georgia in 1866-67 was as follows:— Imports. A eticles. Value of each case or package.

The importations of woollen cloths are also reported to have fallen from 900 bales to about 700 bales, which are valued at 70,000/. On the other hand, there is a considerable trade carried on with Georgia m dried fruits and articles of small value which are not included in the above list, and the quantity of refined sugar imported has greatly increased. For the present year it may be estimated at 22 000 cases, which are valued at 90,000/. With these exceptions the import and export trade from that province has undergone little ehange during the past twelve months and may he estimated at about 4,250,000 tomans, or 1,700,000/., for the maports; and 1,-.50 000 tomans, or 500,000/., for the exports. An extensive contraband trade is carried 011 a on g the Russian frontier, by which European manufactures are introduced into Georgia, gohl and silver coin being remitted to Persia in return for this, as well as for the dried fruits expoito from Azerbijan to Russia. Caspian Trade.-ln 1866-67 the exports to Astrakhan and Georgia from ^e ports on the Caspian Astera, Enzellee, Mesbed-i-Ser, and Asterabad, were as follows :-l lour, 1000 tomans ■ furs, 2,160 tomans ; miscellaneous articles, including gall-nuts, madder root spices, &amp;c flToO tomans ■ fish 200 tomans; cotton, 250,000 poods , 675.000 tomans; dried frm s and sundries, 200,000 tomans; silk, 18,000 tomans; caviare, 60,000 tomans* nee coarse ^ wool and miscellaneous goods valued approximatively at 134,640 tomans ; in all about 800,01 0 000/ This information is derived from the published returns given y rin Mercantile Company, by whose steamers most of the exports are conveyed on the Caspian, and from the statements of Persian merchants engaged in this trade. The imports from Astrakhan and Georgia consist of iron, steel, bronze, brass and copper^ 'r r rr::::: tomans annuaUy, or 180,000/. ' The difference between the value of imports and exports is remitted to Persia in gold. v • r 7f Trade —A considerable increase has taken place of late years since a regu ar Peman Gulf _ establislied betw een Kurrachee and the Gulf, in the trade of Bushire line of ^ tit of cotton manufactures imported last year at the former port and Bundu Abtess. q ^ . g i ^ the importat , ons of raw 13 valu ! d « r toBushire in 1862 were valued at 90,000/.

It is calculated that in Yezd, Ispahan, Cashan, Koom, Mazanderan, Ghilan and Cazveen, 80,000 Tabreez mans, of 6| lbs. each, are produced annually. Of this quantity about 1,500 boxes, containing 25 mans each, are sent from the ports in the Persian Gulf to Batavia, and thence to China. Siti. Until five years ago, the balance of trade with Europe in the northern provinces was in favor of Persia, and large sums were annually received through Russia in gold and silver coins, which were current in most parts of the country. Since then, while some of the imports from Europe have increased, the principal item in the exports has been withdrawn by the failure of the silk produce in Ghilan. The quantity of raw silk annually exported in previous years was about 20,000 ballots of 751bs. each, valued at 3,500,000 tomans, whereas now the whole quantity produced in Ghilan is estimated at only 2,000 ballots, of the value of 360,000 tomans. There has thus been a reduction of 18,000 ballots, valued at 3,240,000 tomans, in this the most valuable article which Persia has to contribute to the European market. Merchants have therefore been obliged to remit a large portion of the value of their imports in specie to Europe, and this has caused a heavier drain of bullion from Persia than her limited resources can bear. The exportation of gold was, consequently, prohibited for more than a year, but, as it was then found that silver was becoming extremely scarce, this measure was lately rescinded, and'the exportation of all silver coin strictly prohibited, to the great inconvenience of the mercantile community in Persia. Several experiments have been made in Ghilan with a view to save that province from the utter rum wrth wh.eh it is threatened by the total failure of the silk erop. A nuantitv of silkworms' eggs were imported from Japan last year by the Greek and other European Houses engaged m the silk trade. They succeeded admirably, and have produced a very superior quality of silk The Pers.an Government also brought silkworms' eggs from Sebzawar, in orassan, and from the frontier of Herat, where the disease has not yet made its appearance but the quantity imported was insufficient, and the quality of the silk which it produced was not good. This year a larger importation has been made from Japan both by the Persian Government and by the European merchants, which will probably yield at least 2,000 ballots and this, with the produce of a large quantity of silkworms' eggs brought from those districts in the east of Persia whence the best Khorassan silk is obtained, it is hoped, will, for the pre sent at least, extricate Persia from the serious difficulty in which she finds herself placed owinff to the heavy loss which her export trade has suffered, and the scarcity of gold and silver caused thereby.
