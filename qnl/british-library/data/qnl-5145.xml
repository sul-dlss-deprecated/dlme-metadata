A fav/ days ago tha Patrol Bngine of (^o, supplies water from the one well in tha Consulate premises containing drinking xa^saxaii iggsdiz water brokejjf down. Bvary /, possible effort was made to get tha Bngina rejpaired locally including tha assistance of the local H.d’s workshops but with out success,, According to expert opinion the repair of tha engine is hardly feasible and in fact not worthwhile for it is now nearly 4 years old, was never sufficiently powerful for the purpose and may be considered as definitely worn out. 2. ^ ah mentioned in the preceding paragraph the whole of the Consulate Staff and their families consisting of some 85 persons are solely dependent for drinking water on this well whicn is unusually deep and water from which has to be pumped out if sufficient xaaHxt quantities are to ba obtained.' At the present moment wii4 great difficulty and some expense small supplies are being pulled up by hand, but the quantity is not ono U 0 h w. and quiije inadequate for the needs or the Consular garden which is also dependent on this, well supply. for it’s water be obtained: There are two means by which sufficient water can (a) by provision of a new Angine to pump up water from the existing well; and (b) to obtain water from the Railway. . As regards (a) it is presumed that owing to the economic situation due to the War the provision of a new Angine would be a matter of sxxxsacsK extreme xi difficulty, and in'anv case would in all probability dc£ mean a long delay. It would appear therefore that the only practicable alternative is (b). 3. Before the Railway was withdrawn to Nok Kundi in 1930 the Consulate in fact obtained all its water from the railway well and a portion of the underground pipe line connecting it with the Consulate is still in existence and in good repairTne distance between the nearest point of the existing Railway pipe and the Consular tank is approximately 250 yards and the installation of a pipe would be the only initial cost to be met. NO 3 J4. Duriag my recent visit to srQuetta I discussed the question of obtaining water with the Divisional Cuperin- • i tendent, Northwestern Railway, Quetta, who informed me that / he did not consider from the Railway point of view that there / would be any difficulty in giving the Consulate the amount of f water asked for i.e. 2,000 gallons daily. Formal sanction he stated would however have to be obtained from the Greneral Manager, North Western Railway, Lahore, to whom he is making a reference on the subject. 3. t Under Railway regulations, it appears that a Pumping charge of Re. A 3 * * * 7 - ijkx per' 1000 gallons is made when water is supplied from Railway sources to other Departments. Thus the total monthly cost for supply of water to the whole Consulate including that for the upkeep of the Consulate &amp;kks garden would amount to 60/- per mensem. Owing to the increase in the price of petrol, lubricating oil and wages of mechanics, the' cost of running the Consulate Water Pump Angina for the 12 months preceding it ! s breakdown was Rs. 800/-. It will thus be seen that to obtain water from the Railway would actually be more economical.i 'i ii - 0 - . f *r*. ** * ■ v^ •*+&lt;* * *. . • k 6. Aa tlie matter is urgent I would request you to telegraph to Government of India yo.r support of this proposal and if sanctioned request that the necessary piping may be arranged for through the s Stores Department and despatched to Zahidan as.early as possible. 7.

The issue of the above has been authorised.D.O.jno: 293-21/2. British Consulate ieneral for , , Khorasan, Zabul, the 14th December 1937 My dear Hay, Will you please refer to paragraph 4(i) of my demi-official letter &gt;T o; 264(21/2), of the 27th October 1937 about the Zahidan Vice-Consulate buildirg. 2. I spoke about this case to Sanaa when I was in Delhi and suggested that perhaps it might be possible for an M.E.S. Officer from Baluchistan to be sent to Zahidan to advise about the building. I should be very grateful if this could be arranged as I do not feel myself competent to advise whether the present building can be utilized and added to with safety or whether it would be better to pull it down and use the materials for a newer and better house. 1 f an Officer could be sent before the end of February this would enable me to meet him myself and discuss the whole case with him. Plans and estimates could then be prepared during the summer of 1938 with a view to applying for funds in the following year. 3. If an officer could beVent from Baluchistan he would have to leave Quetta by the Monday train and : could return on the train of the Friday week, i.e,, he would be away 12 days in all. 4. I am afraid I cannot gaurantee at present that I shall be able to pay the cost of his Travelling Allowance from my existing budget grant as I do not know for certain if I am to g et officers to replace O’Connor and Fry during the present financial year but the cost of a Gazetted Officer’s travelling allowance(lst class) should not be more than Rs.450/-.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, LONDON. Dated Simla, the I June 1936. Subject:-Retention of the Vice Consulate at Zahidan on a permanent basis. Sir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the Secretary of States' telegram No.2110, dated the 8 th July 1935, and to forward a copy of a letter from His Majesty's Consul General for Khorasan, No.35/E/37, dated the 3rd January 1936, containing a proposal for the permanent reteit tion of the Vice Consulate, Zahidan, after the 30th June 1936. His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, who has been consulted in the matter, strongly supports the proposal - vide enclosed copy of his despatch No.102, dated the 28th April 1936. This post has now been in existence on a year-to-year temporary basis for thirteen years, and the Government of India cannot but agree with His Majesty's Minister and the Consul General, Khorasan, that the neces sity for its continuance on a permanent footing has been fully established. They are further of opinion that a decision should not be further post poned by considerations of the impending re-organi sation of the Political Department or of the question of the advisability of the continued employment of officers of Indian services in Consular posts in Iran. So long as posts of an essential character continue to be filled from the cadre ....cadre of the Political Department, they should he included on the permanent strength of that Department, if the very real difficulties expe rienced in filling them from the small deputation reserve available are to be avoided. One of the results of failure to observe this principle was that, when this particular post fell vacant a year ago, it was found impossible to fill it from the Political Department cadre, and a military officer had to be appointed direct from the Indiar Army. Resort to such expedients is unsound and in the case of Iran in particular is open to obvious objection. 2 . I am accordingly to request the sanction of the Secretary of State to the permanent reten tion of the Vice Consulate, Zahidan, with its existing establishment and scale of expenditure which at present amounts to about Rs.41,000 per qnnntn and is equally divisible between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, and to the inclusion of the post of Vice Consul in the Political Department cadre. If the pro posal is accepted, a draft of necessary amend ments in the Superior Civil Services Rules will be submitted in due course.

Subject:-Retention of Zahidan Vice Consulate. I have the honour to refer to Foreign and Political Department Express letter No.D.2327-E/35, dated the 12th July 1935, sanctioning the retention of the Zahidan Vice Consulate until the 30th June 1936 and to submit that the Zahidan Vice Consulate has been in existence for m^y years and there seems no likelihood at all of our being able to dispense with it. In the circumstances I beg to suggest that it may be put on a permanent basis and the necessity for annual application for its retention may be obviated.&amp;/?/36} ' BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN: 28th April, 1936. My Lord, With reference to Your Excellency's telegram No.350-E of the 7th April, I have the honour to furnish my views on the proposal advanced by His Majesty's Consul-Gneeral for Khorrasan that His Manesty's Vice-Consulate at Zahidan should now be established on a permanent basis. 2. As I h 4 understand it, the existence of the Vice-Consulate has only been sanctioned in the past on a year to year basis because it has hitherto alxx always been felt that Zahidan was a place with a precarious future and that it might prove at any time that either it was unnecessary to have a Consu late in that part of the country at all or that it would be preferable to move it to Mirjawa on the actual frontier. I think it may now, however, be -- said with some approach to certainty that a Consulate is necessary in Mekran and that Zahidan is the best place to have it. I therefore strongly support Colonel Daly's proposal. 3. The reasons in favour of this proposal, as I see them may be grouped under two headings: (a) the importance of Zahidan as a centre and (b) the extent of British interests there. I will deal first of all with those which fall under (a). 4. In the first place Zahidan is now the capital of the province of Mekran and the headquarters of the Governor-General. Efforts are being made develop it; much building is in progress or under contempla tion and, so far as one can foresee, there is little 1 or no likelihood of the centre of activity in that part of the country being shifted elsewhere, e.g. to Mirjawa. From the point of view of communicatAons it ...2 . it occupies an important position, being at the junction of the roads to Meshed, Kerman, Nok Kundl and Khwash and there is even a project to extend the road to Khwash on to the sea at Charhar. This would have a strategic value and is I consider more probable that opening up the Charbar - Kerman route recently referred to by Colonel Daly* With the gradual development of the south-east part of the country much traffic is therefore likely to pass through Zahidan and, if the railway is ever reopened, trade with India via that route is likely to increasa Even without the railway it seems probable that there will be more rather than less trade with India passing through Zahidan in future, as that route is one which the Iranian Government profess to be anxious to develop. I would venture to suggest too , that from a military point of view it is desirable L to have a Consulate in that area and that Zahidan is the most obvious place as being the nearest town to the headquarters of the newly constituted 9th (Mekran)- Divislon at Khwash. 5. The chief argument under (b) above is the size of the British community which according to the latest figures to have reached me amounts to seven Europeans and some six hundred and forty Indians. These figures compare with a total of six hundred and eighty British Subjects and British Protected Persons at Meshed, sixty British Subjects at Birjand and one hundred andthirty five British Subjects and British Protected Person at Zabul. There is also a branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran at Zahidan, whereas there is not at either Birjand or Zabul. 6 . The conmunity at Zahidan is composed chiefly of traders and lorry drivers. The former as Your Excellency will be aware, still carry on quite a considerable ...3. considerable business as importers and exporters, while some seventy of the latter are permanently engaged on transport work between Zahidan and Nok Kundi. During the course of the past two years these lorry drivers had need of our protection both against subsidised Iranian transport concei’ns desirous of operating to Nok Kundi and against the military authorities when the latter have comnandeer- ed them and subjected them to quite improper treat ment. Though obstacles are now being put in the way of their trade, it should beffitx borne in mind that Iranian commercial and economic policies are change able. 7. It is difficult for me to give details of the actual volume of consular work arising at Zahidan but, judging by the number of cases which reach the Legation, more work appears to originate there than at any other Consulate in East Iran. Apart from the volume of passport and visa work which the Consul has to perform there is the no mean task of extricating members of the Indian community from the difficulties in which they frequently become involved with the authorities. 8. There is undoubtedly less political work at Zahidan than at Meshed and many other Consulates in this country; but I should nevertheless judge it to be of greater importance in this respect than either Zabul (though this may have a greater potential importance) or Birjand. Despite the fact that the discussions which began at the beginning of last year at the request of the Iranians with a view to ensure a closer system of cooperation on the frontier, were never concluded. His Majesty’s Vice- Consul at Zahidan is nevertheless often asked by the Governor-General of Mekran to use his good offices to secure the restoration of stolen camels ebc.,carried off by brigands across the frontier; and given a more reasonable spirit on the part of the Ministry of War cooperation with His Majesty's Vice- Consulate at $ Zahidan might be far closer than it ’ is. In view of the fact that the Baluchi tribes who inhabit the border have affiliations sii on both sides of the frontier it would in any case seem desirable to have a Consulate in that area and Zabul would appear to be too remote and too isolated to be able adequately to keep an eye on the tribes. 9. The fact that in recent years no suggestion has been made that the Vice-Consulate at Zahidan should be closed is surely evidence that the necessity for its continued existence is recognised. A prolonged temporary existence rarely leads to improvement or even maintenance of quality. I believe it to be ^ important that each Consulate in this country should stand out for excellence in its own district, especially now when their number has been consider ably reduced; and in addition to the reasons enu- merated above I would advocate the establishment of the Zahidan Vice-Consulate on a permanent base in the interest of developing its own standard of excellence. 10.

Dear George, 1 enclose a copy of a despatch from Daly to the Government of India advocating the establishment on a permanent basis of the Zahidan Vice—Consulate. 2. As the despatch is addressed to India, we are not saying anything ourselves officially unless we are asked for our views. But as Daly has raised the question 1 have written privately to Metcalfe and send you a copy of ay letter with its enclosure. 3 . Daly has also taken the opportunity to write to tell us that Zahidan possesses no ’’British Vice-Consulate” plaque and to ask whether one could be supplied. Keif, our Office of ’*orks representative here, is inclined to think that if the Consulate is to be permanently established, the Office of forks will send out a more pretentious affair than otherwise. In these circumstances we cannot very well make a definite request at the moment, but 1 mention the matter now as perhaps the best plan would be for the Department to get in touch with the Office of toorks when a decision is taken on the main questions and ask them to supply whatever is considered appropriate.

Subject:- Ketention of Zahidan Vice Consulate. Sir, I have the honour to refer to Foreign and Political Department Express letter No.D 2327-K/36, dated the 12th July 1936, sanctioning the retention of the Zahidan Vice Consulate until the 30th June 1936 and to submit that the Zahidan Vice Consulate has been in existence for many years and there seems no likelihood at all of our being able to dispense with it. In the circumstances I beg to suggest that it may be put on a permanent basis and the necessity for annual application for its retention may be obviated. I have, etc., Sd/- C.K. Daly, Lt. Colonel, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's consul General for Khorasan. 0&gt; !No. 205/5/56 7th February, 1936. Will you please refer to Daly^ despatch to you N0.35/PV37 of the 3rd January, in uhich he recommends that the Vice-Consulate at Zahidan should be established on a permanent basis? 2 . I presume that you *ill let us know if you would like to have our views officially on bely's proposal. Meanwhile you may care to see the enclosed extract from Loxley’s report on his journey back from Delhi, through kast Iran (the whole report has not yet been typed). I hardly feel competent to express any views of my own as yet but Pybus, who is the only member of the staff besides Loxley to have visited Zahidan, is in general agreement with what he says. Summerhayes, our Consul, is equally inclined to judge from the volume of semi-consular work which reaches us from there that the establishment of a permanent Consulate is now desirable and the size of the British Indian colony, amounting to eight hundred and ninety (these are the 1934 figures. tte cannot A / for the moment lay our hands of the later ones), would certainly seem to support this view. 3. If and when it is decided to agree to Daly’s proposal, the question of accommodation and rebuilding could perhaps best be considered in connection with the Iranian Government’s demand for the payment of two taxes known as Kaq-ul-Arz and iiaq-us-Sabt ^see the minister’s despatch No.226 Sir H.A.F.

I am sending a copy of this letter end of Daly’s despatch to Rendel. (Signed) N.U. Butler.ZAHKDAN yi(;a^ONSUi,ATK . ihe ^on.su itself consists of a nuribei* of houses set round a barrack square and is entirely unenclosed. On ! the side next the barracks a wall runs along part of its length but for the rest it has only a barbed wire fence to keep people out and not even that on the side facing the road where only a series of stone pillars marks the boundary of the property. The houses themselves stand well back from the road and the part in front is quite useless to us; &gt;noreover, soldiers coming from the barracks find it a s ort cut into the town and a regular right of way seems to be establishing itself across it. The Consul s house has a completely enclosed garden at the back with its proud array of trees and the tennis court also stands within its four wells; but otherwise there is no privacy to be found anywhere and no possible way of stopping people wandering in end out if they choose to do so. l presume that the reason why the Consulate is left as it is, is because its continuance as a post is only sanctioned on a year to year basis. The view had been gradually forming in my mind during the past year, however, that the volume of work emanating from Zahedan was such that we ought perhaps to consider placing the post on a more permanent basis. Now that I have been there and had the chance to discuss things with Campbell, and later with Daly, feel rtrongly that this should be done. Daly holds similar views and is, i know, going to take an early g o tun t to express them. Uncertainty has hitherto held us back, uncertainty as to the attitude which the Iranian Government were going to adopt towards the place, as to the future of trade, of the Indian community there, of the railway and of the flow of passenger traffic. At one time itit seemed that we might even do tetter to move to Mirjawa. Now, however, I feel that we might well take a definite decision .i ihe moat Important facts that support this view is that the ranians are now quite clearly set on developing the place;;It I Is the headquarters of the Governor-General of Mekran, a great deal of building is nw in progress there and grandiose schemes of development are under discussion. Viewing the matter now from our angle, it may be said that Zahedan is the headquarters of a not inconsiderable Indian trading community and of the Indian lorry drivers who operate on the international road to Nok Kundi. we consequently have an appreciable volume of business to transact with the Governor-General and I don't 4 think that I shall be wrong in maintaining that there is more wor there than at the great majority of our Consulates in this country. *■ Now if the Consulate is to be established on a permanent basis, : would urge most earnestly that something must in humanity be done to make it more attractive than it now is. Nothing can alter the tedium of daily existence in the middle | of a desert where the only other Kuropean resident is the i manager of the Imperial Ban of Iran; but a great deal could be done to improve the amenities of the Consulate. At the moment j they consist of the walled garden with its few trees, a tennis J court and a squash court and a minute tank in which it is Just ' possible to bathe; and the Campbells and the Bank Manager are with great enterprise improvising a very sporting golf-course in the desert. it is not so much the lack of things to do that j is irksome; it is the general lack of privacy and of anything the eye can rest on with pleasure, the barrack-like waste of the H vhole compound and the general feeling that it is only a camp improvised out of a few war-time buildings. My own remedy would be to abandon about half the compound, build a wall round the re.t, im rove the houses and investigate the possibility of 11 increasingincreasing the water-8Ui&gt;ply so as to have enough to plant more trees and sow some grass. I am not sure whether much could be done even with a better water-supply f for the water itself is terribly salt* But the other proposals would all maice the place more habitable and if it did prove possible to have more green, it might even become something approaching pleasrnt. At the moment the Campbells are certainly treating the place in the right spirit. They have their two small boys there and a god-daughter of nineteen and another girl staying with them, and the Bank manager comes across X’or all his meals. And they play squash, tennis and golf, and generally try to mefce life there a good joke instead of a thoroughly bad one. But it would be quite impossible to ask them or anyone else to stay there very long. Former Consule, I understand, used to find a certain divei sion in meeting the little bands of people who used to motor from and to India in the spring and autumn; but from all accounts the popularity of this route for English travellers has now seriously waned on account of the petty troubles and annoyances that have to be met with from Iranian officials, and I was only the second Englishman to have passed through in the two months the Campbells had been there* To revert to the possibility of giving up a large part of the compound and rebuilding the rest; The question is now becoming topical on account of the demand which reached us this last sumner for the payment of two taxes on the property, called Haq-ul-Arz and Haq-us-Sebt* We have sent despatches about them to the Foreign Office and to India, so I need not go into details now; it is enough to say that the magnitude of the annual tax which we are called upon to pay is such that the alternative of abandoning a large partof the epee which we occupy at present seems worth serious consideration* After discussing the matter at some length* rV ■ _ MJm. Colonel Daly and I left it that he would prepare estimates for the rebuilding and would take the opportunity to express his views on the question of establishing the Consulate on a permanent basis* I do not wish to anticipate his detailed opinions but have felt it right to set down the above in order to express my own personal view that the Consulate should be made permanent and to urge that* if this view is accepted* it is essential that the place should be made more habitable.k.

A safe of this kind would certainly appear to be less secure than a key-lock safe and it seems a matter for consideration whetner a new one should not now be installed. Hitherto the retention of the Vice- Consulate has only been sanctioned on a year to year basis but Colonel Daly has recently recommended to the Government of India that it should be peramently established (see my letter to Mr. Rendel of the 7th February, Ho. 206/4/36). I mention this because it occurs to me that if this proposal is sanctioned, it would appear to provide a further argument in favour of the installation of a really modern safe.

The following infonsaJHcan has been obtained from 2&amp;hidan y much of it having been obtained unofficially from the Chief of the aevenue Department there 1• On the recommerulation of the local Governor submitted to Tehran in 1933 the following orders were finally passed :• (a) All land at gahidan is Grown land. (b) such land can be sold to Iranian subjects * only. (c) The sale of unoccupied land to foreigners is |j normally prohlMted f but applications from foreigners to purchase land already held by the© on the tax system will he considered on their merits. If sanctioned the area purchased ©ay not exceed 1500 square aars. (d) 3ale of the land occupied as the Vice- Conaulate under (c) is strictly prohibited and it can only be occupied on the tax system.

(It should be noted that whereas the Iranian authorities in Tehran have demanded payment of Haq-ul- jra from 1917, the looal authdrities who used to collect It from 1926, have recently collected only with effect from 1931.; foreigners may retain on the Tax System the whole of the land occupied when the town was founded even if this exceeds 1600 »&amp;rs, but must pay Haq-ul-sabt and Haq-ul-Ara from 193* ^on»ul«f- la ! i ? n w 2 U i£ ^ the Vl^ insulate, sale of the land to us having heov especially prohibited. *2» His Majesty's Vice-Consul reports that the majority of British auhjeots at z&amp;hidan have not paid arrears of Baot-ul-uaht, Dpt that payment has frequently been demanaed of them* In cases in which they desire to sell property the Revenue Office decline to register the sale until double the tax due has been paid e»g« one payment on behlaf of the vendor and one on behalf of the puroh&amp;aer* 3* as regards Kaq-ul-.rz the situation is some what different. Moot British subjects have paid retrospectively from 1920 but some have paid noth ing. The Iranian authorities appear to have altered their demand, and call upon persons who have not paid to do so with effect from 1931, although no question of refund to those who have pa: paid from 192b appears to be entertained. 4. The rat© for Eaq-ul-aabt is five shehis per squar© zar and for Baq-ul-Ara two sha his per square ear. 5. as the Consulate land cannot be sold to us no question of purchase price arises, but land is said to sell at shahis ten to Bials twenty per 6. I attach a comparative statement shewing the figures as shown in your despatches and those forwarded by His Majesty's Vice-Consul at £&amp;hid&amp;n. The differences are due to the following :- square zar according to situation. (a) A slight difference in the area of the Vice Consulate land &amp;s now reported. His Majesty's Vice Consul states that it i* * it 12*2 SSJt* 1 '® JBmr ® which should be adaed 3,P50 square zars for the Hebate Office aaicing &amp; total of 114,H33 square zars. that arrived at in Tehran. case the ate t o. ) j.!■&gt;*? (o) KaQ-ul-,rg - The annual sum es shewn fcy the /laeConsul varies slightly from the Legation estimate inasmuch as it j^rovides for the Hebate Office* The gross amount payable appears to he £667-15-0 (at Rials d6 to the £) instead of £2300 f based on the fact that in no other cases do the local autnorities demand payment for the period prior to 1^31, whereas the Legation•© calculation is with effect from 1917. 7. hie Majesty # s Vice-Consul states that no official demand for payment of either tax has been received f although the matter has been mentioned verbally and unofficially on several occasions, fc. The •;3ebate Office* is maintained solely in the interests of Iranian trade and enables traders to have their Imported goods Inspected and to obtain drawback of Indian Customs duty on the spot and without delay. It is a small building constructed of mud and sleepers(one of the old station buildings) and in my opinion, in view of the advantage to Iranian subjects of our maintaining a Rebate Officer at 2ahidan, any attempt to collect either tax should be resisted. 9. It appears to me that it would be practicable to greatly reduce the area of the Vice-Consulate which consists of a number of scattered buildings, and I have made suggestions to the Vice Consul in this respect. I await information concerning - (a) The cost of demolishing and re-erecting certain buildings. (b) The exact area of the reduced enclosure which would result* t?ith this information available it should be possible to decide whether it be more eoonomicAto retain the present buildings and pay higher taxes or to reduce the area occupied (necessitating non-recurring capital expenditure) and so decrease the amount of annual taxation.
