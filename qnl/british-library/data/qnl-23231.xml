SHARIFF HAS SUM &amp; CO. Telegraphic Address; M SILV2RLINK ,, BOMBAY. No. G/3712. The Secretary to tne Government of India, Foreign Department, DELHI. Sir, We have the honour to place the following facts before the Government of India with a fervent hope that tne same will receive the Government’s kind consideration. This Contpany is registered in Bomoay under the Indian Companies Act 1913. One of the steamers of this Company, tne s.s. M AHMu,DI' sailed from Bombay on tne 18th October 1932 for Bahrein and Cjair in the Persian Gulf via Karachi with general merchandise. The vessel after loading cargo at Karachi for the said ports sailed from there direct for Bahrein on the 23rd October 1932 and arrived at Bahrein at 10-10 A.M. on the 27th October 1932. Before the vessel’s departure from Bombay we had written to our Bahrein Agent Mr. Yusoof Bin Ahmed kanoo, who has worked as this Company’s Agent since many years, about the fixture of the vessel for the port of Bahrein and Cjair, and after the vessel’s departure from Karachi we wired to our said Agent at Bahrein about the same and also informed him of the expected arrival time of the vessel au Bahrein. Immediately on receipt of our telegram our Bahrein Agent replied by wire expressing his regrets for his inability to act as our Agent without assigning any reason. This telegram was despatched and received oy us on the 24th Octooer 1932. On the same day we sent a telegram to Messrs Muetaffa Bin Abdul Latif a well known firm of Bombay and Bahrein appointing them as our Agents at Bahrein. Lateron the 25th October 1932 we received telegram from Messrs Mustaffa reading ; 'SORRY ADVISE YOU WIRE AGENCY ALAJAGl'. On tne 26th October 1932 we wired to Messrs. Mohamed Abdul Aziz Alajaji &amp; Bros, at Bahrein to act as our Agents and further informed them that the vessel was expected to arrive at Bahrein on the 27th October 1932. As up to the 28 th October we did not receive any news from Messrs. Mohamed Aodul Aziz Alajaji &amp; Bros, regarding tne vessel’s arrival at Bahrein and the progress of discharge of Bahrein cargo, we sent a telegram to them on the 28th October 1932 requesting them to wire us the vessel’s arrival and waen sue should be sailing for Ojair. On the 28th October 1932 we received a telegram from Messrs Mohamed Abdul Aziz Alajaji and Bros., informing us that they had accepted our Agency but that the Bahrein Government had refused them permission to become our Agents. For the first time v;e came to know that the reasons for refusal of our Agency by Mr. Yusoof Bin Ahmed Kanoo and Messrs Mostaffa Bin Abdul Latif was the refusal of the Bahrein Government to grant them permission to act as our Agents* On the 28th October 1932 we received a telegram from the Master of the s*s. 'AHMBD1', dated the 27th October 1932, informing us that he arrived at Bahrein on Thursday the 27th October 1932 and that the Bahrein Government would not allow the discharge of the Bahrein cargo unless 2 /* duty was paid on Ojair cargo. Immediately on receipt of the above telegram from tne Master we sent a wire to HIS BRITANNIC aMAJESTY’S CONSUL at Bahrein acquainting him with the above facts and requesting him to intervene and do the needful, but regret to state that so far we have not even received a bare acknowledgement from him. The vessel was detained at Bahrein upto the 31st October 1932 and had to sail away to a place called ”RASTABOORA” to discharge the Bahrein and Ojair cargo. During the period of the vessel’s detention at Bahrein she was completely isolated and no one was allowed to go on board and even fresh provisions were not allowedto be taken on board. As a result of tnis ban on our vessel at Banrein, we have suffered considerably besides we have had to pay Rs. 1000/- as condensation to the Charterers for the vessel’s late arrival at dasrah where she was to arrive before tae 5th Uovember 1932 to load dates. Tnus we have suffered a loss of about Rs. 6000 /- i.e. Rs. 5000/- for detention at Bahrein and Rastanoora to which latter port the vessel was compelled to proceed to discharge her cargo where discharging facilities were nil, and Rs. 1000/- paid to the Charterers as compensation for the late delivery of the vessel at Basrah to the Charterers. We most respectfully submit that the order of the Bahrein Government was quite illegal and unjustifiable, and therefore the Bahrein Government must compensate us for the loss we have suffered, not to speak of the indignities that were offered to a British ship. We send herewith copies of correspondence passed between the Bahrein Authorities, our Agent and Uaster of the s.s. ’’AHMiSDl ” in support of our case. As will be seen from the copies of correspondence between the Bahrein Authorities and the -iaster of the s.s. “AHMSDI M the said ban was imposed by the Bahrein Government only for our snip shortly before her arrival at Bahrein and we cannot for a moment understand the reasons for the said ban on our vessel. V.e now fervently hope that the Government of India will take effective steps into the matter and compel the Bahrein Government to compensate us for the loss '-’c have suffered on account of the unlawful ban imposed on our steamer, and that in future no such oostacles are put in the way of a British Ship by a foreign Government. v.e have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servants, Sd/- Shariff Hassum &amp; Co.

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of today’s date written on board ray ship s. s.’’Ahraedi' in Bahrein Roads in which you inform ms that I am not allowed to land any cargo from ray ship for this port unless and ad-valorem duty of two percent on Ojar cargo be paid first to Bahrein Government. I beg to point out to you that when I kkx loaded these cargoes at Bombay and Karachi there was no such thing as prohibition of landing lawful cargo at Bahrein from these ports, otherwise, my Owners at Bombay would not have accepted the Charter and in support of the above statement, I may state that copy of the Sundry Miscellaneous regulations sanctioned 1924/1342, is dated the 24th October 193&lt;-, a'mm© ll a day after I left Karachi for Bahrein. My ah ip was then on the high eeaa and» therefore, the above regulations were not in force nor in existence when I left Bombay and Karachi, otherwise my Owners would have taken steps to obtain the necessary permission from your Government before loading these cargoes. I therefore request you to exempt my ship from the provisions of the above regulations for this voyage and allow me to start discharging my cargo for Bahrein. As for the two percent duty claimed on the Ojar cargo I suggest that you should claim this from the Owners of the cargo or the consignee as they are solely responsible to pay all custom duties on all import cargoes, not myself nor my Owners or their representatives. Further I beg to apply permission to act as Agent for my ship and that I may be allowed to appoint a sub-Agent to deal with ray import cargo for Bahrein. Hoping that you will take my letter in consideration and give me permission to land my cha rgo for this port without delay, I remain,Sir, Yours truly, Sd.R.Pa rcou, Comma nde r© /&gt; Govermnent of Bahrein. Copy of letter addressed to the Captain S. S.Ahmedi at Bahrein by Office of the Adviser to the Governroent of Bahrein dated 29th October 1932. i have the honour to inform you that the Government of ^ Bahrein is prepared to allow your ship to discharge subject to the following conditions. 1. The 2% duty liable to Cover nine nt of Bahrein on the cargo on board your ship destined for Ojair shall be lodged in the l«a stern Bank Ltd. » Bahrein» in the name of h.B.IT a Political Agent, Bahrein, to whom any reference can be made by you on his return. 2. You are at liberty yourself to act as agent for the Bahrein cargo provided that you employ the Bahrein Landing Compa ny,( The Mesopotamia Persia Corpora tion Ltd) to land your Bahrein cargo. Bills of landing will be produced by you, or the Bahrein consignees, to the Director of Customs, who will then give delivery. f• • • • (3 IS Copy of letter from Capt. R.Pa rcou, Commander of 3s. n Ahmedi' dated 23th October 1932 addressed to the Adviser to the Govern ment of Bahrein, 1 have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of today's date and 1 thank you for allowing me to act as agent for my vessel and that 1 could discharge my cargo, provided I employ the Bahrein Landing Company, The Jesopotamia Persia Corporation Ltd., to land my Bahrein cargo. I am prepared to comply with your recommendations, but 1 am unable to comply with the deposit on the Ojar cargo as the provisions of my Charter-party and Bills of Lading do not specify anything of the sort. I have to deliver this cargo at Ojar where, I believe the consignee will take delivery and comply with all Custom regulations and pay all Custom Duties according to Law. I have seen Messrs Abdul Aziz Bhasam and they say that they will answer you direct. 1 again pray that you will not delay me permission to land my cargo for Bahrein any longer as the consignees here are pressing me to land their cargo immediately. *Copy of letter from the Government of Bahrein dated 29th October 1932 addressed to the Managert Bah re in Landing Co, » Me ape rs. This is to introduce Captain R.Parcou, Commander of s, s. 'Ahmedi' to whom i t ha s been suggested by the Government of Bahrein that your Landing Company should be employed to unload certain cargo for Bahrein now on board s, s. 'Ahmed i w • I diall be obliged if you could n^ke an arrangement with him for the landing of his cargo. Please understand that Captain Parcou is writing as his own agent and it is not intended that you should act as steamer's agents, but as Landing Company’s only. Yours faithfully, Sd.C. Dalrymple Belgirve. P.S Until certain formalities have been concluded, i.e. connection with this Government's claim for Custom on Ojar cargo no cargo has been permitted to be landed by order of this Government, when these formalities have been completed you will loe notifiedCopy of letter received by the eastern Steam Navigation Co. Ltd., from the Captain of s. s. M Ahmedi w from Bahrein dated 30th October 1932. I arrived here on Thursday at 10 a.m. Port Doctor boarded my ship immediately and given us free pratique; afterwards the Director of Customs came on board and informed me that I am not allowed to discharge my Bahrein cargo unless 2% is paid to Bahrein Government on Cjair cargo as an ad-valorem duty. I immediately went ashore and discuss the point with the Adviser to Government, 1 pointed out to him all clauses of Merchant Shipping Act and other marine regulations and customs in other foreign ports, but I could not persuade him to allow Alajaji to act as agent, so I told him on the spot, to take notice that I shall be my own agent at Bahrein, as you did not accept tue man wnom my owners employed therefore all o ther * shipping agents are afraid to apply for fear of being refused again. However I am sending you copies of ail correspondence passed between myself and the Bahrein authorities, you will see that I have done all I could to discharge cargo for Bahrein but without success, if the Political agent was here, I would have won my fight long ago, but he is at Bushire, X have wired to him but no answer, I expect that I shall be allowed to start discharging Bahrein cargo today as the adviser has given me a letter allowing the Bahrein landing cargo to land my cargo provided certain formalities have been complied with, regarding Ojair cargo, but the consignee has sent for the Director of Customs at Cjair who is arriving here at 8 a.m. today to discuss the matter, he says that if this man tell him to pay deposit as suggested, he will iianediately deposit the amount in tne Bank (Rs.2121;. I shall wire you the result today, dont worry 1 am doing the needful, the only drawback is that the Political Agent is absent and the Indian Assistant who is here cannot do much to help me. I think that the Ahmedi willT / be too deep to reach at Ojalr, the pilot suggested to bring her in another place where there are plenty of water and land the cargo in the boats there; he said that the tfagervik was drawing only 10 feet of water and I shall be drawing 17^ after landing Bahrein cargo. Anyhow I will try my utmost to go as near as I could discharge Ojair cargo. Copy of letter from Capt. R. Parcou, Commander of s.s. “AHMEDI rt dated Bahrein 30th October 1932 addressed to the Political Agent, Bahrein. The s.s. n AHMSDl H under my command arrived here on Thursday the 27th October 19 32 at 10 A.I*I. and the Director of Customs boarded my ship and informed me about the undermention ed order from the Government of Bahrein and handed over to me a copy of Miscfcilaneous Regulations for the port of Bahrein regarding the passengers and cargo and the last paragraph is dated the 24th October and runs as follows rt Copy of Government Proclamation Bo. 28/1351 24 Jamal A1 Thany ^ 1361. I. The public are reminded that no one is permitted to become an agent for a Shipping or Air Company in Bahrein or agent of any ship that loads or unloads cargo or passengers in Bahrein without obtaining permission from the Government. II. No one is allowed to load or unload passengers or cargo in Bahrein waters unless he obtains permission from the Government to do so • III. All applications should be in writing and submitted to the Director of Custom and Port Officer.' As this para relates only about permission to become an Agent and the loading and unloading of cargo arid passengers it seems that this proclamation was framed for my shinship only, because, the agent wnoni my Company employed could not secure the necessary permission from the Govern ment to act as agent for my ship and also I am not allowed to discharge my cargo for tni s port. Under these circumstances I beg to point out to you that I failed to understand why my ship would not be allowed to discharge her cargo for this port after I have reported my arrival and deposited my manifests Doth for Bahrein and Ojar cargo on the day of my arrival at the Custom House and therefore made the entry of my ship inwards according to law and regulations at Bahrein* You will understand that my ship is under British Colour and that there is nothing in these regulations which 1 can see to prevent me from landing my cargo except that I must obtain permission from the Government, out in every port when a ship has been entered inwards and manifests, passenger lists and crew list has been deposited with the Custom Authority it is a sure understanding that the vessel ii free to land her passengers and cargo for the port where she has actually made her entry inwards. In the case of my vessel I was allowed to land passengers but not the cargo* Another steamer of the City line came in alter me ard was allowed to discharge all her cargo and passengers and left the same day. I consider that, this is not legal and that the orders passed on my ship by the Bahrein Govemraent is detrimental to my Owners alone, as other vessels which enter this port were not subjected to the same unlawful orders* I strongly protest against the actions of the Bahrein Government with regards to my snip at Bahrein ana reserve all my rights to render this Government responsible for the great delay and losses that my Owners may suffer through delaying me to discharge my cargo for this port illegally* Further, I noticed that my ship is considered as an undesirable in Bahrein as no one from the shore is allowed on board except Custom Officers who keep watch on board since my arrival, my crew is deprived of fresh provisions and no boatsboats are allowed to board tbe vessel under any circum» stances. 1 have personally tried to get a boat to bring me on board on Friday afternoon but they all refused for fear of bein^ fined by the Director of Customs. Hoping you will take trie necessary steps to redress the wrongs which my vessel and her crew have sustained during her stay at Bahrein and inform my Owners at Bombay the result of your enquiries, I remain, Sir, Yours truly, Sd/- ft. Parcou Commander, s. s. Copy of telegram sent by the Eastern Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. to the Captain s.s. rt AHM*DI* »t Bahrein dated 3lst October 1922.

Dear sir, Re:- Our Ag ency et Bahrein . We beg to inform you, in scttare-rdynefc consequence of the Basra merchants making an agreement with us to the effect that all the dates would be shipped from Basra to Karachi and Bombay per our vessels only provided we give them steamers et Basra at intervals of 10 days, we had to re-establish the Persian Gulfl steamer service and this service commenced with our s.s.Haideri, You will be glad to note that the Basra merchants did not ship a single packages of dates or any other cargo from Basra by the B.I.Vessels after the agreement was made with us although the B*I# have reduced their rate of freight from Ra.il/- to Ra.3/- per ton.. Agency at Bshre in. You will remrember that when our s.s. Ahmedi had last called at Bahrein in November 1932, when we had approached you to act as our agents, which you didmnot accept and being under the impression that due to your numerous engagements you would not accept our agency and (now understand was due to the vessel going to Ojair,) therefore we had no other alternative btt to appoint Mr. M.Akil Khoomji as our Agent at Bahrein, ^e informed him about his appointment by our letter of the 13th August 1934. The s.s.Haideri left for Karachi^ on the 7th instant night for Bahrein and was due to arrive at Bahrein on the 12th instant. All of a sudden on the 10th inst. we received a telegram from Mr. Khoonji that the Bahrein Government had refused to grant him license for landing the cargo and that he had applied to the Political Agent for permission. As this telegram was received by ihisus on the night of the 10th inst and as the vessel was to arrive at Bahrein on the morning of the 12th inst. and the telegraphic line to Bohrein being interrupted, we were in a great fix and if the cargo was not discharged ?t Bahrein it not effected our future business but would have been put to a greet loss of money and prestige. We therefore sent e telegram to the Political Agent at Bahrein on the 12th inst. and requested him to do the needful and on the 12th inst. we received his urgent telegraphic reply to the effect that the Bahrein Govern ment’s objection was only to the appointment of Mr. Khoonji and that the Captain of the vessel on arrival at Bahrein could rta± appoint any suitable agent. This information gave us heart and allayed our fears and anxiety because we came to know for the first time that the objection raised by the Bahrein Government was in respect of the appointment of Mr. Ehoomji and that there was no other objection. e therefore had no other alternative but to approach you once again, that under the circumstances you will not refuse this time and accordingly we sent you a wire on the 12th inst. reading:- 'HAIDERI DUE YOURS TODAY APPOINT YOU AGENT PLEASE DISC AHRGE fUBT SAIL BASRAH IMMEDIATELY IF DETAINING SUFFERING HEAVY LOSSES Ht ?IRE SILVER!INK M and received : our reply to the seid telegram on the 13th inst.
