There is also a note from Maynard dated 25 October 1873 confirming that the instructions have been undertaken.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023593365.0x00000f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
