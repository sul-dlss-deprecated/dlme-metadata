A knowledge of the manners of dif ferent nations qualifies domeftic prejudice, and enlight ens the mind; but the fubjects of Britain derive from it a fingular benefit; they fee through a comparifon that communicates a fond pleafure to the heart, the unri valed excellency of their laws, conllitution and govern ment ; they fee thefe rare gifts brightly reflected on their national character, which ftill avowedly maintains its pre-eminence amongft the nations of the European world. Were a man to form a judgment of the bias of Vol. I. b hisT X PREFACE. his own genius and difpofition, (on the merits of which he is, perhaps the leaft qualified to decide, (I would un- refervedly fay, that in the courfe of my journey, I felt no impulfe of partiality for any fedt or body of men. It is of ferious concern to letters, that many a man of ge nius and fcience has fixed a difcredit on his works, by a wilful adherence to fome favourite fyftem, which alluring to its ftandard a various train of affeftions, and ideas, he becomes involuntarily incited to facrifice to it the principles of truth and reafon. Travellers ftand accufed, even, on proverbial au thority, of adopting a figurative and loole ftyle of defcrip- tion ; and as I have been thrown into tracks, removed trom the eye of European obfervation, I am prompted to earncftly folicit the confidence of the public in behalf of this work, and to fay, that however vi tiated by the errors of judgment, it has no tendency to difcolour or mifreprefent truth. The curfory differ- tation on the former and prelent ftate of Bengal, may have fome claim to favour, from the confideration that I vifited that province in the defcription of a paflenger; through i—n pi i'h wtm ¥P R E F A C E. xi though but a fmall portion of local knowledge might have been acquired, effential advantages arofe from this temporary reiidence. Guided by no views of intereft, nor impreffed by any frown of power, I was enabled to examine the objects that came before me through a difpaffionate medium. The letter on the mythology of the Hindoos, fome copies of which were publifhed in 1785, has been corre&amp;ed fince my return to India j but from the va rious intricacy of the fubjedt, I am apprehenfive it may yet contain errors and apparent inconfiflencies. Invefti- gations of the religious ceremonies and cuftoms of the Hindoos, written in the Carnatic, and in the Punjab,, would in many examples widely differ; yet the Hin doo religion, in all parts of India* Hand on a common balls ; nor does the vaft fuperftrudlure, when the view is infpected with attention, ellentially differ in its compart ments. The oftenfible diilimilarity arifes, perhaps from the manners of the fame people, varying in Northern and Southern regions. A native of the lower Carnatic is mild, h 2 tempe-temperate, and generally timid ; he performs the or dinances of his religion with a zealous and fcrupulous attention ; and the bramin of that country, with many of the other fedts, is confined ftricHy to the ufe of vege table diet. How firong the contraft appears in the in habitant of the Punjab; thofe even of domeftic and la borious profeffions, are brave, daring, and often cruel. Bramins are the ufual foldiers of the country, many of whom eat flelh meat ; and they never leave their home, even when not employed in military fervxce, without weapons of offence. The merchants and mechanicks, when they go but a few miles abroad, are all ftrongly armed ; and in fome of the Northern provinces, parti cularly in Bundilcund, the hufbandmen carry a fpear into the field they are cultivating. This difference of difpofition has produced oppofite manners in the fame tribes of people, as w~ell as oppofite cuftoms, which if not attentively inveftigated, would afford a fpecious be lief, that the inhabitants of the North and South of India were not connedted by any national relation. I have to exprefs with pleafure, great obligations to ColonelPREFACE. xu. Colonel Polier, of the Honourable Company’s fervice, for having furnifhed me with large hiftorical trads of the Sicques, and of the life of Shujah-ud-Dowlah. On every application to that gentleman for other information of Indian hiftory, his papers and opinions have been liberally fupplied. I am alfo much indebted to Mr. Briftow, of Bengal, for a valuable manufcript memoir of Shujah-ud-Dowlah, from which I haveextraded curious and ufeful matter. The prefixed chart of the road, calculated according to the reckoning of my journal, was conftruded by Mr. Wilford, of the Bengal corps of engineers, a gentleman of extenfive geographical knowledge. Science can receive but a fiender aid from the mate rials of the following work. The manner in which I tra velled, precluded the ufe of any inftrument to afcertain the diftance and bearings. The one I noted from obferv- ing the courfe of the fun; the other is agreeable to the common computation of the country, which is not often found widely erroneous. My limited knowledge oi bo tany prevents, alfo, any accurate defcription of various clafies'T elafles of trees and plants, which I faw in Kaflimire and Perha.

On the 23d of May, I left Calcutta, and on the next day ar rived at Sookfagur, a valuable and riling plantation, the property of Meffrs. Crofts and Lennox, Thefe gentlemen have eflablifhed, at this place, a fabrication of white cloth, of which the Company provide an annual inveftment, of about two lacks of rupees. They have alfo, founded a raw filk manufactory, which, as it bears the appearance of increafe and improvement, will, I hope, reward the induftrious and eflimable labours of it’s proprietors. In this plan tation, a large quantity of fpirituous liquor is made, refembling, in an inferior degree, the American rum, which, fince the com mencement of the Dutch war, has become in great demand. Being applied to all the ufes of the Batavia arrack, a confiderable benefit is expedled to arife to the Bengal province, from a current fale of this commodity. In juftice to thofe who enrich their country by an introdudfion of valuable manufadhires, the Government is called upon to yield them every protection, and grant them every fair indulgence ; it is, likewife, the duty of the man of obfervation, to circulate the fuccefs of fuch works, that an emu lation may warm the breads of his fellow citizens, and that thofe who projedt them, may receive the tribute of applaufe, due to ge nius and induftry. It mud not be omitted that this new eda- blifhment, hath been noticed by the particular attention of the Government of Bengal, which, on many other occafions, has evincedFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 3 . 4 evinced a zealous difpofition, in encouraging and promoting ufeful undertakings. The Engliili (hould no longer account themfclves fojourners in this country| they arc now, virtually, it’s lords paramount, and their policy fliould not be that of a day ; but, confidering the opulence and wealth of the fubjtfft as clofely tending to enrich the common flate, they fhould, at large, fupport his wants, and encourage his labours, A conduft equally wife and profitable, would conduce to the increafe of public, and private, profperity, and operate as a compenfatory retribution for fome actions, which' cannot bear the teft of invefligation; and which have, already, involved the national charadter in difgrace* In touching on this fubjedf, I am neceflarily led into refledtions on the commerce of Bengal, interior and foreign, and on the common want of fpecie, throughout the province* Previously to the sera in which the Englifh became poffefled of Bengal, the different nations who vifited it were obliged to give ♦ .. ,'. r fpecie for the greateft portion of the commodities they purchafed ; there being but a fmall proportion of articles taken in barter by _ «■ r “ r * * ^ .... the natives. This fpecies of commerce, fo lucrative to India, and which mufl have depofited a large amount of gold and filver, con tinued for upwards of a century^and an half. But, after the En glifh Government was eftablifhed in Bengal, the necefiity of this commercial fyflem no longer exifled ; the amount of the revenues became fdfficient to purchafe the cargoes of the country, and to A 2 defray4 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. defray the public expenditures: here, one channel of the influx of fpecie into Bengal was flopped, and it will be found, alfo, that the revolutions, which in that quarter, advanced the fortunes of the Englifh, have materially leflened the like imports of the other Eu ropean nations, who traded to Bengal. For, exclufively of finding a current fale for their commodities, they have been enabled to procure, from the Englifh, large fums of money, for bills on Eu rope, An important change has been alfo effe&amp;ed on the interior commerce of Bengal, by the extindlion of the Mahometan domi nion. The native princes, and chiefs of a various defeription, the re tainers of numerous dependants, afforded a conftant employment to a vaft number of ingenious manufa&amp;urers, who fupplied their maflers with gold and filver fluffs, curioufly flowered, plain muf- lins, a diverfity of beautiful filks, and other articles of Afiatic lux- ury j the ufe of which, wealth, and a propenfity to a voluptuous life, naturally excited. Thefe Mahometan, or Hindoo, chiefs, have either been removed, or being no longer pofleffed of their former refource, have fallen into poverty and decay 5 and the artizans, who had been fupported in their profeffions by thefe powerful and wealthy maflers, were, on their expulfion, obliged, from a want of fubfiftence, to quit their profeffions, or the country. Hence, many branches of rare manufadure, evidently declined ; and fome of the mofl precious are now no longer known. The difliaded and im- poverifhed condition of the Moghul and Peiiian empires, hath con tributed^FORSTER’S TRAVELS 5 tribute^, confiderably, to leflen the great demand which was made by thofe Rates, for the produce of Bengal, when Dehli and Ifpahan enjoyed reigns of grandeur and vigour. Wheri it is confidered, that the Moghul court, whether in it’s fplendour or wealth, exceeded that of all other nations 5 that the numerous governors, interfperfed throughout the provinces, adopted the manners of fovereign princes and that all their more luxurious articles of drefs were fabricated in Bengal ; we mull conclude, that the difcontinuation of fuch a traffic has produced ftrong effefts. In defcribing this commercial event, which has brought an evident change in the quality of the trade of Bengal, I am not authorized, by any fpecific knowledge, to fay, that a general injury has been felt by the country 5 prehaps, the Ioffes which have been fuftained are counterpoifed by the aug mentation of the cargoes, though of a different fpecies, which arc now tranfported, annually, to Europe. Having already noticed the large influx of European fpecie, or bullion, in this country, and the caufe of the ceffation of this traf fic, I will offer fome defultory fentiments, on the fubje6t of the di minution of the coin in Bengal, of which, grevious complaints have long exifled. During the Mahometan admi niff ration, private wealth was ufually expended on the fpot vvheie it had been ac quired j and though feverity and oppreffion might have been ex- crcifed in the accumulation, yet, by it’s quick circulrticn, through the many channels of luxury, the count!y at large was improved and embdliihed, without any decreafe of the general currency. It may6 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. may be urged, that the expenditure of Europeans, in their public and private buildings, has, adequately, fupplied the wants of the artizan and labourer. - But, I am led to hazard an opinion, that this amount falls much flioit of that applied by the preceding princes to the conftrudlion of mofques, baths, Hindoo temples, grand refervoirs of water, fpacious gardens, together with a variety of coldly private edifices. Thefe modes of expence are neither adapted to the genius, or inclination, of Europeans, who have no religious paflion to gratify, nor are they impelled, by patriot zeal, to raife monuments of grandeur in India ; but holding themfelves the moveable tenants of the day, they are eager to reach their na tive home, that they may there enjoy the fruits of their labour. As the remittance of Englilh property to Europe could not be fufficiently attained, by means of public bills, the fervants of the Company, and private merchants, have been often driven to the neceffity of exporting fpecie, though fuch a medium be, attended with heavy lofs; or they are induced to throw their cafh into fo reign funds, whereby their enemies, or at leafir, their rivals, are en riched. The injurious tendency of this limitation of public remit tance, having been fo feverely felt, and repeatedly reprefented to the fuperior Government in England, it is to be expected that the chan nel of conveying property from India, will be opened in fo efficient amanner, that the neceffity of purfuing, in future the dellruc- tive alternative of exporting gold and filver, or employing foreign agents, will be, wholly, obviated. As the private calh taken up in India &lt; w ■FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 7 India will be invefted in Indian produce, and fent to Europe, for the exprefs purpofe of difcharging the bills drawn ; the pofition is clear, excepting in the event of unforefeen calamity, that the Tales of the cargoes, in Europe, will enable the Eaft India Company to difcharge the requifite payments. In teftimony of the vaft inherent refource of Bengal, it is neceffary to obferve, that the wealth of this province, which has fupported, by its millions, the Coromandel and Malabar coafts, foreign and domeflic wars, and the trade of China and Bencoolen, mull; have been accumulated in the fpace of fixty or feventy years. From the period of Arungzebe’s death,* until nearly the date of our territorial eftablifhments in India, when the Moghul Empire ftill preferved a large pofleffion of its power, the balance of the re venues of Bengal, was pundtually conveyed, in fpecie and*f- Bills, to the Imperial treafury. The remittance of this amount has been known to caufe fo great a fcarcity of money, that many perfons, polfeffed of even large property, have incurred difficulties, in de- fraying their domeftic expences. Though the maritime commerce of Bengal does not maintain the vigor which accompanied it, whilft the Europeans were confined to the coafls of India, and exercifed fimply the profeffion of merchants, a brilk and important trade is yet carried on at Calcutta. The advantageous traffic that fub- * This Prince died, A.

Though thefe branches of commerce, filver bullion, gold-dufl: and precious Tones, were introduced into Bengal ; from whence, in return raw and wrought filks, coarfe cotton cloths, opium, and fait petre, were exported. It hath alfo been alledged, that, within thefe late years, the maritime trade of Bengal has received a check from an embargo, or, what is tantamount, an excefiive high duty laid on the importation of foreign fait. This reflri6lion has reduced the number of fhips, and leffened the confiderable exportation of grain, which, before that period, annually took place at the port of Calcutta : yet, though it may have injured the exterior commerce, the revenue of the Ganges fait has been increafed, by this reftri&amp;ion, to an amount never produced at any former period. It is painful, per haps not jufl, to expatiate on the defeats, or the misfortunes of a country, and hold them out to public view ; without propofing lemedies for the ihs that are exhibited. The fcantinefs of my local knowledge, will only permit me to fay, that as the welfare of the Britifh dominion in India, ultimately depends on the prolperity of Bengal, no labour fhould be thought irkfome, no rational plan left untried, which may improve its revenne, or encourage its trade. On the 29th of May I arrived at Berhampore. In this canton ment, whicn is large and commodious, are Rationed three regi ments of fepoys, and a battalion of Europeans. On the 15th of June,FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 9 June, made an excurfion to Moorefhedabad, and it’s environs, that I might view the theatre on which thofe interefling fchemes had been agitated, which, after a feries of intrigue and blood-fhed, ad vanced the Englifh to the dominion of a wealthy kingdom. At the diftance of a mile below the city, and on the oppofitc bank of the river, Rands the burying place of Ali Verdy Khan, known alfo in India by the name of Mahobut Jung 5 a man, who, by his abilities as a foldier and a flatefman, raifed himfelf from a private condition, to the Subahdarry of Bengal. He maintained an obftinate war with the Mahrattas, for the fpace of eight years, and was, after an obftinate ftruggle, obliged to cede to them the dif- tricls of Kuttack. Not far from the tomb of Mahobut Jung, lies interred his nephew, Seraje-ud-Dowlah, well known in Englifh hiftory, by his capture of Fort William, and afterwards, confining the unfortu nate garrifon in a clofe dungeon ; where moft of them died from the feverity of their fituation. The fate of this young man was fimilar to that of many an Eaftern Prince j of fuch, efpecially, who experience a reveife of fortune.—Seraje-ud-Dowlah was betrayed by Meer Jaffier, at the battle of Plaftey, and affaflinated a fhort time after, by his order. Were the condudt of Meer Jaffier to be tried by the law of natural affecftions, or by the rules of private honor, it muft appear tainted with a die of deep hue. Mahobut Jung, thinking to fecure to his fucceffor the attachment of Meer Jaffier, beftowed on this officer, the higheft office of Government, y° L ’ B with10 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. with his fifter in marriage $ and on his death bed, in the moft ear ned: manner, delivered the young Nabob to his tutelage and pro* te6lion. Mahobut Jung fliould have known, from fuccefsfu! experience,^ that no ties are fufficiently coercive to reftrain the wild force of ambition ; particularly that fpecies of it found in an Afiatic bread, which is feen to break down every fence. The Mollahs, who are employed here to offer up their prayers for the dead, faid, that the widow of Seraje-ud-Dowlah, frequently comes to this maufoleum, and performs certain ceremonies of mourning, in memory of her deceafed hufband. Moorefhedabad, which now bears the various marks of poverty and decay, an evi dent refult of the removal of the feat of Government, is a city of « no old date; as the refidence of the fubahs of Bengal, who, not many years ago, kept their court at Rajah Mhal, about one hun dred miles further up the river. The prefent Subahdar, Mubarick- ud-Dowlah, grandfon of Meer Jaffier, and fon of the Nabob Mirun, who was faid to have been killed by lightening, receives an annual ftipend of fixteen lacks of rupees, from the Company’s trea- fury : having never been veiled with the power, or poffeffed of an afpiring temper, he is the lefs reftlefs, in his prefent fituation. As the Britifh nation, in the acquiiition of their pofleffions in Bengal,, have been materially aided, by the family of Mubarick-ud-Dow- lah, they fliould not, from any narrow feheme of ceconomy, recede * He had made a fuccefsful ufe, in his attainment of power, of the various inftruments ©f intrigue and treachery,. fromFORSTER’S TRAVELS. ** from their engagements with this prince, who, though flattered by the mod indulgent attention, mu ft dill have mortifying moments, unlefs he is wholly bereft of the fenfe of feeling, or the faculty of reflection. No buildings of note are feen in the city of Moore- fliedabad: that which moft attraCls the attention, is the cemetery of Meer Jaffler, his begum, and the Nabob Mherun :* few things are more efficacious, in reprefling or mocking vanity, of which af fection fo ample a fhare has fallen to our lot, than, difpaffionately, to view the repofitory of thofe who in their lives have been termed great men, who, cc before they fliuffled off this mortal coil,” in flamed by pride, avarice, ambition, thought empires too narrow for their fcope, and that mankind were only created to become the indruments of their mad defires: thefe once towering crea tures, are now, per force, lodged in very moderate apartments*, where their turbulent fchemes fleep in quiet, and their names are often buried in their allies.—A tomb is one of thofe few appendages of a great man, in the pofieflion of which none envy him. On the 23d of June, I embarked in a boat at Moorefhedabad, and with a frefli eaderly wind, failed up the river about 30 miles. The boatmen, generally Hindoos, faden the boat to the fhore in the evening, that they may eat and refrefh themfelves $ it not being the ufage of their fed to prepare viCluals on the water. * I have been alfo informed that Mherun was interred at Rajemhal, It is not ufual among the Mahometans to ere6t cenotaphs.

The Ganges, which at Sooty,* is full four miles acrofs, was that day roughly agitated by a ftrong wind, which heaving the waters into a fhort breaking wave, gave it the appearance of an arm of the fea. The riches of Bengal, with a large portion of the conveniency of it’s inhabitants, are, in an effential degree, derived from this river, which, with its numer ous branches flowing through and interfering an extenfive fpace of country, tranfports fpeedily, and at a moderate expence, the various produ£l of diftri&lt; 5 ls, towns, and villages, to places, where they are immediately confumed, or colledled for the fupply of more diftant marts. The Ganges alfo affords a grand aid to the Englifh, in all military operations within their own territory 5 whilft their armies on the Coromandel and Malabar Coafts, are, from a want of pro- viftons and ammunition, cramped and impeded in their motions 3 and are frequently,, for the obtainment of thde fupplies, compelled to retreat, on the moment of reaping the full fruits of victory.

In the evening, arrived at Rajah Mhal, a former refidence of fome of the Bengal fubahdars. Ah Verdy Khan, in the beginning of his ad mini ft ration, which commenced in 1742, removed the feat of Government from this place to Moorefhedabad. I could not learn the caufe of this preference ; although not deficient in en quiry. The natives of India, are not much addidled to curious in- veftigation, and are generally inattentive to the hiftory of their own country. It would feem that their chief happinefs is centered, in enjoying the prefent hour, which abforbs every retrofpe6V of the pall, and care of the future. Their pleafures are even indolent and languid, and partake of the mild influence of their climate, and the eafy produce of a fertile foil Ali Verdy Khan probably removed his capital to Moorfhedabad, that he might keep a more vigilant watch over the adlions of the Englifti, whom, it was faid, he fear ed ; and alfo more conveniently profecute the war againfl: the Mahrattas, who had invaded his country, on the fide of the Kut- tack. Rajah Mhal bears at this day an impoverifhed afpe£t; and were it not for the heaps of ruins interfperfed through the town and its environs, which have now mouldered into a Rate of deep decay, it would be difficult to difcover, that this place had been, fo lately, the principal city of a powerful and opulent chief. Sauntering amongft the ruined building:, I ftrayed into a fnidli gar den adjorning the bank of the river whure perceiving an old man,.F OR STE R’S T R A V EL S. 14 employed in digging, I entered into a converfation with him. Hap pening to be more intelligent than the common clafs, and agree ably to the period oi his life, very narrative, he afforded me much amufement in his relation and' remarks. Tliis old Cicerone ob served, that the very fpot which he was then cultivating, was the iite of the Nobet Ghah ; or the muiic-hall of the old palace ; and that within his recolledtion, a capacious garden had extended in front of his little inclofure, which the Ganges had now fwept away. The inffability of the monuments of human grandeur can not, in any region of the globe, I apprehend, be more faithfully, or more grievoufly exemplified than at Rajah Mhal j yet I muff exclude from this range of ruins the convenient and hofpitabie houfe of Mr. Cleveland, which formed a part of the Subahdar’s palace. On the 26th, paffed, with a frefh eafterly wind, the village of Sickergully, (where a heavy fwell had nearly overfet the boat) and obferved near it a neat building, which had been ereSted by Mr. Cleveland, for the accomodation of paffengers. 27th.—Saw the town of Pointee, near which, on an eminence, Rands an Hindoo, or Mahometan manfion j and a mofipue, now apparently in difufe.

The fequel of this event fets forth, that the fervants of the Sultan Banque were difcovered in forming another confpiracy, with thofe Maho metans, who have been already noticed, and that the King being now violently exafperated againft this unfortunate family, ordered it to be extirpated ; nor did any branch remain, excepting the Princefs, whom he had efpoufed.* Cassum * I have been the more induced to infert this relation of the fate of Sultan Shujah, as it places the conclufion of a curious hiftorical paflage, in a point of view, different fromtl FORSTER’S TRAVELS.

The numerous ruins of public and private edifices, fcattered through the town of Patna, and its environs, indicate a former grandeur and extent, which now no longer exift. An ancient name of this place, flill known to fome of the more intelligent inhabitants, and bearing an affinity to that given, by Strabo and Pliny, to the fuppofed capital of India, has fuggefted an opinion, that Patna occupies the fituation of the celebrated Palibertha j which is farther fubftantiated by the geographical obfervations of Major Rennel.—Curiofity, and the defire of the moment to indulge a melancholy idea, led me to the fpot, where the Englifh were maffacred by the order of Caffum Ali. The former buildings are removed, and a well proportioned monument has been eredted in commemoration of that dreadful event, though without any in- fcription. Perhaps it had been confiflent with founder policy, that no fuch memorial had been fixed ; but as it was judged expedient to record, thus publicly, an a£t of treacherous cruelty, the caufe, I think, fhould have been explained.

A few days after the engagement, Mherim died, ftruck, it was faid, by lightening. The father believed that his fon had been cut off by an affaflin, and he loudly accufed Caffum Ali of the murder. The event having removed a flrong bar to Caffum’s ambition, and there alfo ap pearing fome fufpicious circumftances, attending the alledged caufe of his death, Meer Jaffier may be juftified in believing, that his fon had been taken off, by an avowed rival, who was feen at a fubfe- quent period, indulging an implacable and fanguinary temper.

This com mercial advantage, may be afcribed to the rigid fyflem of cecono- my obferved by the Dutch in all their operations, and to a perfe- vering attention to bufinefs, with which that people feem confti- tutionally endowed. On the 12th of Auguft, left Choprah, and on the 17th arrived by water at Buxar.

A gentleman of curious refearch on the coaft of Coromandel, informed me, that at Chilemberum, about 20 miles to the fouthward of Cudalore, he faw a religious Hindoo edifice, plain, and without any interior figure, which was devoted to the worfhip of “ the Invifible God,” and was never approached but with tokens of profound awe and reverence. termsFORSTER'S TRAVELS, 35 terms may not in literary ftridtnefs, comprife the precife meaning of ih’ Englifh text, they convey it virtually, and in the ampleft fenfe.

In this note, it may not be uninterefting to introduce a tenet of the Egyptian theological philofo- phers, which correfponds with the idea I have formed of the akajh of the Hindoos, and alfo, certain opinions entertained by them of the formation of the world, and the creation of animated bodies. Thefe philofophical priefts, who profefled the tenets of Menes, their firft law-giver, (whom they had deified and entitled, Ofiris, or the fun), laid that fire, or rather, a refined Ipirit, which they diftinguilhed from the elemental fire, was difFufed through all nature, and compofed the efience of that being, who firfl gave form and order to matter. They believed that five elements — the mind, fire, air, earth, and water, conftituted the entire world : they called the mind Jupiter, which fignifies the fource of life, and they confidered him the father of all intelligent beings. The fire they termed Vulcan, who they alledged, contributed chiefly to the produdlion and perfe&amp;ion of all things. Earth, being as it were the bofom in which all things re ceive the principles of life, was known by the defignation of Mother. The water was called Ocean, to which they gave the name of the Nurfing Mother. The air was denominated Minerva, and believed to be the daughter of Jupiter, fprung from his brain, and always a virgin, as this element is incorruptible and rifes to Heaven.— The Egyptian philofophers fuppofed, that all the original matter of the univerfe had been immerged in a chaos, and was gradually feparated from it by fermentation ; that the air was in continual agitation ; that the fire, liberated from the grofier matter, had afcended, and formed the fun and liars, the highefi: obje&amp;s of the univerfe; that fpirit, or the mind, the moft fubtile part of fire, was difperfed through all parts, to animate life, and impart voluntary motion.

It was neceflary to give reafons, why nature had flopped in her primary operations, and did not form many more animal creatures, as the manner of formation had been fo Ample and eafy. Syftematic philofophy, even in its infancy, did not want refource; and that of the Egyptians has met the obje&amp;ion, by urging, that nature had originally infpired every fpecies of animals with the inftindf of propagation ; having fagely forefeen, that when the fun and the winds had entirely dried the earth, it would be incapable of producing perfect animals.— See Mr. Labbathier’s Hiflory of Ancient Nations, tranflated by Mr. Stockdale. * The writers of the Hindoo mythology, have given various and diffufe defcrip- tions of the origin of the world, and of the human and animal race, but unite in blending them with a feries of extravagant and difgufting fables. f There is in India an aboriginal race of people, who are not clafled in any of the fe£Is, and confined to the moft menial offices.

It fhould feem, that the genuine race of the Glittery has for a great length of time been extin£f f and that its place is now occupied by a fpurious tribe. The Hin doos compofing thefe caffs and claffes, are ultimately branched in two divifions s the one denominated Vyftnow Bukht ; the other, Sheva Bukht. The followers of the former deity are ufually dif- tinguifhed by a longitudinal mark on the forehead, whilfl thofe of the latter draw a parrallel line on that part. Vyftnow is worfhip- ped under the reprefentation of a human figure, having a circle of ✓ heads, and four hands; emblems of an all-feeing and all provident Being. The figure of a fabulous bird, on which he is fuppofed to ride, and denoting the velocity of his motion, is occafionally placed in front of this image. Sheva, or Eifhwer, and as he is often denominated by the Hindoos, the Mhah Deve, is ufually repre- fented by a compound figure, defcribing the male and female parts of generation, and defigned as the fymbol of procreation and fe cundity : thefe faculties, or qualities, being claffed amongft the choiceft bleffings of the Hindoos, and the deprivation of them deemed a fevere reproach and misfortune. Facing this defignation of Mhah Deve, is fometimes feen, in a fuppliant pofture, the fta- tue of a cow, or bull: an animal faid to have derived his facred qualities, from having been chofen by this god, as the favourite medium of his conveyance.

Another figure reprefents Sheva, with four hands, holding dif-* ferent emblems of his power; and five heads, four of which are diredled to the cardinal points, and the fifth is placed with the face upwards, in the fuppofed a£t of contemplating the godhead. This deity who occupies numerous forms, is figured alfo with three eyes, one of which is placed in the forehead. In gratitude for the fervice which Brimha has performed on earth, it would reafonably be fuppofed, that the thankfgiving of his people would in fome degree be proportioned to his works. But the Hindoos have not dedicated one temple to his honor ; nor have they eftablifhed a fingle feftival, in remembrance of his deeds. It would redound but little to my credit, did I infert in this place the reafons alledged in their religious trails, for the negledt of Brimha. It is a tale framed to amufe the credulous Hindoo, and procure a meal to an artful prieft. The oftenfible want of atten tion to the memory of Brimha, may on a more abftra&amp;ed ground be afcribed to an opinion, that the powers of procreation having been primarily fet in a&amp;ion, and operating by a law impulfive * Mlik and butter compofe a great part of the aliment of an Hindoo. and40 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. and undeviating, whole immediate benefits exift, and are con- fpicuoufly difplayed in its effects, no ritual necehity called for the commemoration of its firfl caufe, or the propitiation of its future influence.

It will then be feen, that the genius of the Hindoos was happily led on 5 and that their bent of difpofition was aptly regulated and attempered by the rules eftablHhed for the performance of their feveral profeffions, A precifion which re pelled the encroachments of error or defign, prefcribed to them their refpe&amp;ive duties in the ftate, and in fociety, and wholly pre cluded any other fe£t from infringing on the privileges of another.

The importance of thefe offices muil have given to the Bramin great fway in a community where a knowledge of religious worth ip, from its complex variety, be comes a talk of arduous labour; and where, at the fame time, a performance of the rites of his religion, is deemed an obligation indifpenlably incumbent on the Hindoo, in his acquifition of fu ture happinefs. Thefe employments were judged of fufficient mag nitude to occupy the whole attention of the Bramin, and he was {briefly interdicted from all temporal affairs. The authority of ex- ercifing the functions of royalty, feems to have devolved without referve on the Chittery or Rajah, and his poffeffions were held here ditary in the line of legitimate male primogeniture. The youngeft branch of this race were employed in the army, and entrulted with the charge of the forts and ftrong holds of the country. The occupation of a merchant, with the tranfaCtions of traffic,, was committed to the Bhyfe, or Banian, and it was declared unlawful for the other tribes to engage in commerce. The huf- bandman, the artifan, the private foldier, and the labourer, compofe the Looder, or the fourth caff of Hindoo; and each of thefe refpeCtive profeffions was exclufively purfued.

From the examples which have been brought for ward for the explanation of fome of the moft confpicuous parts of the mythology of the Hindoos, and to demonftrate the probable antiquity of that nation, it may feem, that I favour the belief of Egypt’s having received a portion of her ftock of fcience and reli gion from India. With a deference to popular opinion, and de claiming all fabrication of fyftem, I muft avow an inclination to this opinion. One fa6I amongft fome others, afforded me a fair proof of the high antiquity of the Hindoos, as a civilized nation, and marks a ftrong difapprobation of a foreign intercourfe.

They were alfo, either forbidden from embark ing on the ocean, or they were deterred from undertaking marine expeditions, by the difficulties incurred in procuring at fea, the requifite diet for a Hindoo. The probability therefore is not ap parent, that any part of a people, fenced in by this refiridlion, and who were fo proudly centered in themfelves, as to rejedl with abhorrence, the admiffion of profelyes, would have emigrated into a diftant country, and brought from thence a fyflem of religious worfhip ; nor does any probable tradition authorife the belief of an Egyptian colony having been eftablifhed in India. The capa cious fpace which Hindoflan occupies on the face of the globe, the advantages it derives from foil and climate, and from its nu merous rivers, fome of them of the firlt clafs of magnitude, may be adduced as reafonable arguments of its having been peopled at a more early period of time than Egypt, which does not poffefs the like local benefits. If the degree of perfection which manu factures have attained, be received as a criterion to judge of the progrefs of civilization, and if it be alfo admitted as a teft: of decid ing on the antiquity of a people, who adopt no foreign improve ments, little hefitation would occur, in bellowing the palm of pre cedence on Hindoftan, whofe fabrics of the molt delicate and beau tiful contexture, have been long held in admiration, and have hi therto flood unrivalled.

Thefe re- fiedlions which have been furnifhed by experience and various in formation, will perhaps afford more fatisfadtion, than the laboured and perplexed proofs of dates and etymology, which are often framed, as they moft commodioufly accord with fome favourite hypothefis. Amongst the Hindoos, marriage,* when it can be performed with any degree of conveniency, is deemed an indifpenfable duty, and it is believed, that propagating the fpecies in that Rate, enti tles parents to fmgular marks of the divine favour.

It is to this inftitution, which is ftrongly recommended, and, I may Tay, even enforced, that the generally extenfive population of Hindoftan, and its fpeedy recovery from, the calamities of war and famine, may be largely afcnbed. The entire fyftem of domeftic ordinance and ceconomy of the Hindoos, is founded on a firm, yet, fimple bafis ; from which arife effects, happy in themfelves, and powerfully operative in uniting the bonds of fociety. By the ancient laws of the country, the wife depends for the enjoyment of every pleafure, as well as for moft of the or dinary accommodations of life, on the immediate exiftence of her hulband j and it becomes her invariable intereft to preferve his health, as much of her happinefs is centered in his living to an old age.

But this ufage has not fo generally prevailed in latter times.

Conformably to the Rate of fubordination in which Hindoo women are placed, it has been judged expedient to debar them the ufe of letters.

MY DEAR SIR, O N the 3d of this month, I made an ex- curfion to Bidgi-ghur,* a place rendered famous in the Bengal an nals, from a large amount of plunder acquired there by the Eng- lifh troops. On the firft day, I arrived at Lutteef-ghur, about iB miles to the fouthweft of Bernares. The fort was entirely deferted, and the paflage approaching to it is almoft choaked up by brulh- wood, and the projedled branches of trees. Lutteef-ghur ftands in the centre of a circular range of hills, from the fummit of which, a thick, and in mofl: places a high wood, reaches to the walls of the fort. The, air of this fpot being deprived of a quick circulation, has acquired a malignant quality, and ^communicates its pernicious influence to all animal bodies. It is in thefe fitua- tions, where as it is termed, the hill fever is produced : —a difeafe, which pervading every part of the animal ceconomy, contaminates » Bidgi and Idgi, according to the mythology of the Hindoos, keep watch at the gate of Paradife 5 Ghur, in the Hindoo, is a fortrefs or ftrong hold. theFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 63 the whole mafs of blood, and will only yield to the power of mer cury. The water alfo in fuch places partakes of the like baneful property :—it ihould feem that the air infufes into this element, a certain portion of that peftiferous quality, with which the climate of woody and confined countries in India is ever pregnant. The falling of the branches and leaves into rivulets and refervoirs of water, may likewife increafe the noxious effedt. Having fre quently witneffed the ill effects of a confined air, I am the more emboldened to hazard thefe conjedtures which I will clofe with noticing to you, that wherever I have obferved an impurity of air the water has been equally pernicious. At the gate of the fort, had taken up his lonely refidence, a Mahometan Faquir, who bore on him, poor man! evident proofs of the deftrudtive climate of Lutteef-ghur ;—he was meagre, wan, and nearly con fumed by the violence of a fever and ague. When I deiired him to leave fo melancholy a ftation, and go where he might recover his health, he fliewed little attention to the advice, and prefeied, he laid, an exiftence in this place, under a load of mifery and the precarious charity of paffengers, to the rifk of ffarving in places where he might be wholly unknown. On the 4th, after a Journey of about twenty miles, I arrived near the foot of Bidgi-ghur hill, where I flept, and in the morning walked up to the fort, which is a circumvallation of the crown of a rocky hill, meafuring from the immediate bale to the fummit, a little more perhaps than two miles. The64 TO R ST ER ? S T R AV ELS, The artificial fortification is neither ftrong, nor is it compofed of fubftantial materials, as is feen by a fiffare of the wall, caufed by the rains of the lafi year, and alfo by a breach that was made during the fiege; which fliew that the wall is chiefly compofed of rough Rones cemented with clay. This ftrong hold owes its im portance folely to its height and fteepnefs; and had it been de fended with a common fhare of condudl and fpirit, the capture would have been attended with much difficulty and bloudflied. It has been faid indeed, that exclufively of the hazardous attempt of taking Bidgi-ghur by ftorm, the greater part of the troops would have been deftroyed by fevers, had they remained in that quarter a month longer. Three deep refervoirs, excavated on the top of the hill, plentifully fupply the garrifon with water. Some of the baflions on the eaftern fide are fupported by branches of the rock, which projeffing horizontally eight or ten feet from the fummit, holds out in the air a folid foundation. The profpedf around is diverfified and pldturefque, but when you throw the eye on the deep and rugged precipice beneath, the view is infinitely grand, though not diverted of that horror, which naturally affedls the mind in contemplating obje6ls from fo abrupt a height. The rifing and fetting fun at Bidgi-ghur exhibits a magnificent feene, and excites a train of ideas ftrongly imprefled with a grateful admiration of the firft caufe of nature.

The village of Mow, fituate at the bottom of the defcent, which before the capture of Bidgi-ghur was well peopled, and poffefTed a confiderable commerce, is now deferted and in ruins. This village, whofe lofs is feverely felt in many parts of the coun try, afforded the only mart on that quarter for fupplying the wants of the bordering mountaineers, who reforted thither, and bartered their wares for the produce of the low lands. Since the depopulation of Mow this commercial communication has ceafed, and the Benares traders maintain little connexion with the inha bitants of the hills, who are a hardy a6live race of men, and were they encouraged like thofe of Bauglepore to enter into our fervice, an ufeful body of foldiers might be acquired. They are not, it is faid, fubjedt to that fpecies of fever incident to a hilly country, which has operated fo fatally on the health of our troops; nor do they entertain thofe prejudices in their mode of living which affedl the higher ranks of the Hindoos, and which have been found to embarrafs military operations.

Lucknow is a large and populous city, but wholly inelegant and irregular. The flreets are narrow, uneven, and alrnoft choak- ed up with every fpecies of filth. The Goomty, running on the .north fide of the town, is navigable for boats of a common fize at all feafons of the year, and falls into the Ganges between Benares and Ghazepour. A line of boats, extended acrofs the river, forms a convenient communication with a large fuburb.

Before I leave the territories of A (Toff- / ud-Dowlah, or, as he is often entitled from the rank he holds, the Vizier of the Empire, I will throw together for your perufal fome brief remarks on the Oude government. This country is bounded on the north, by parts of Napaul and Siranagur ; on the eaft, by the Engliftr poffeflions ; on the fouth, by the Jumna ; and on the weft, generally by the Doab, and the Ganges. The Oude territories, generally flat and fertile, are watered by the Ganges, Jumna, Gograh, Goomty, and Gunduck, exclufive of many rivulets. Thefe rivers flow through moft of the principal towns, and interfea a large fpace of the country ; moft of them being navigable for boats, in all feafons of the year. The Englifti armies may be plentifully fupplied with proviftons and ammunition, ni the event of executing any military operation in that quarter.

The Vizier’s provinces, which yield, it is faid, at this period, a revenue of about two mil- lions-86 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. lions fterling, have greatly decreafed in produce fince the death of Shujah- ud-Dowlah. It would be prefumptuous in me to attempt an explanation of fuch decreafe. It was fufficiently mortifying, to obferve the common effedls of a deifrudtive adminiflration. The inhabitants fay, that the population of the country is diminifhed, and that the commerce, which in former periods was important and ex ten five, has fallen to decay. Thefe evils which have con- ' tribated to the ruin of the mod powerful dates, and are now precipitating the ruin of Oude, can only be eradicated by the dre- nuous exertions of a jud and wife governor : a character devoutly to be wiflied for in Oude. It appears, that a large portion of the amount now paid by AfibfTud-Dowlah into the Company’s trea- fury at Lucknow, is tranfported from thence in fpecie to relieve the neceffities of Bengal, now urgent in the extreme. Much of the wealth alfo, which has been accumulated by the fervants of the Company redding in this country, has been conveyed in a fimilar mode ; and the mifchief gathers drength from the tenor of our pre- ieiiL connection with Afioff-ud^Dowlah. The channels of commerce operate too tardily for meafures which require difpatch, and em brace only the objedt of the day. If treafure can be procured, no fe- condary aids are called in 5 no fuccedaneurn is fearched for. Thefe drains, unfupplied by any native fource, mud foon exhaud the vigour of a country, where in addition to the grievance, commerce is loaded with monopoly, and influenced by the hand of power. The demand for bills on Bengal, which has been prefling and con tinued,FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 87 tin tied, gave them often a value of feventeen and an half per cent* on the Lucknow amount; a profit which enabled the bankers to export the value in ftlver.* — The refumption of the Jaguir, or alienated lands, has not been productive of tne promifed benefits. The officers, who enjoyed thofe benefadlions, were many or them men of expenfive manners ; they promoted the confumption 01 valuable manufactures, and polieffing rank and diitmcfion, they maintained a numerous body of dependants. Whether from a fucceffion of oppreffive managers, or that the inhabitants go not experience the fruits of former liberality, it is evidently feen, that the refumed diflriCls are ill cultivated, and tninly inhabited. Little remains to be faid of the Vizier s military eftahlifh- ment; it being only ufeful in affiihing the collection or die levenue, enforcing the obedience of the leffer vaffals, or furnifhing a guard for his perfon. The defence of the country wholly reds on the forces of the Englifh, which are fuppiied according to emergency. The troops at this time, amount to about eight thoufand fepoys, and five hundred Europeans, with the requifite train of artillery. The treafury of Aflbff-ud-Dowlah is now low, but it is faid, that he has nearly paid off the refidue of a large debt, which had been accumulating fince the period or his father s death.

Hnoondy Khan, a nephew of Alum Khan, who probably came to Rohilcund about the fame period, was alfo much favored by Ali Mahomet. Actu ated more perhaps by the defire of conqueft, than letahatmg former difgrace, Ali Mahomet invaded Cummaioun, which he over-run, and compelled the chief to take refuge in the Serinagur country.^ He amaffed a large booty in this expedition, which was concluded by the exaftion of an annual tribute 5 and Rohilla troops were Rationed in the forts of Cafhipour and Rooderpour, dependencies of Cummaioun, which he kept poffeffion of, to re cord, it is faid, the revenge that had been taken for the murder of his father.

Setting alfo at defiance the power of Sufdah Jung, the Subahdar of Oude, he plundered a large quantity of valuable timber that had been cut down for his ufe in the northern parts of Rohil- cund.

Ali Mahomet, aware of his inability to refift the King’s army,, and feeling perhaps a relu6lance to face his Sove reign in the field, had retired into the woods of Banghur^-f* the fkirts of which were defended by a chain of forts that had been ere6led by the Rohillas at a former period.

During the refidence of Ali Mahomet at Sirhend, his party, which had been joined by a body of two or three thoufand marauding Afghans, was computed at ten thoufand cavalry, and fifteen or twenty thoufand infantry of various denominations. The Rohilla did not take any part in the Durany war jf* but whilft the Moghul and Afghan armies were approaching to a&lt;ffion, he quitted the Punjab and retired to Hurd- war, from whence he penetrated in 1747 into Rohilcund, which he rapidly conquered.

As a fhort hiftory of the life of Shujah-ud-Dowlah will be annexed in which the principal events of the Rohilla war are noticed, a difcuffion of them in this place becomes unneceffary. The form of government adopted by the Rohillas in India, of near affinity to that which exifts in their native country, may be denominated feudal.

Born and reared to manhood in a country,* where its people are taught to confider a military as the only laudable profelfion, and that the fword conveys an ir reproachable title to every acquifition, Hafiz Rhamut, confli- tutionally brave, became an enterprifing foldier. His govern ment was founded on the common bafis of an active fyftem ; but flourifhed from the knowledge he poflefied of its refources. He feems to have maintained a general good faith in public tranfa6tions, and though in the attainment of power he tram pled on another’s right, his genius and valor preferved the al legiance, and perhaps the love of his people 5 who favv in him a matter, whofe hand was equally prompt to indulgence or protec tion.

The Rohillas, efpecially the lower claffes, w'ere, with but few exceptions, the only fe6t of Mahometans in India who exercifed-the profeflion of hufbandry ; and their improvements of the various branches or agriculture, were amply recompenfed by the abundance, and fuperior quality of the produaions of Rohilcund.^ The addons of Najeb Khan, thofe efpecially which occupied the latter periods of his life, bearing a clofe relation to the hif- tory of Rohilcund, I have given them a feparate place in the treatife; which as it reprefents him in a more confpicuous light, will afford me the fenfible pleafure of offering up a tribute of re- fped and applaufe, to the memory of a brave liberal foldier, and a ftatefman of diflinguifhed ability.

Frafer fays, « Before I relate the treacherous correfpondence * carried on be- tween Nizam Saadut Khan, and Nadir Shah, the invitation they “ gave him to march towards Hindoftan, which was the princi- ic pal motive that encouraged him to undertake the expedition, I &lt; £ fhall,” &amp;c. — And in the other part of the book it is mentioned, that on Nadir’s approach towards the capital, Saadut Khan received orders to join the Dehli army, and that he had already eroded the Ganges, when he was directed to return to Oude.

This Omrah was required to undertake the charge, but an ill Rate of health at that time detained him in Oude. He arrived in February 1739, in the camp of Mahomet Shah, who receding from his former determina tion, had joined the army. On the day of Saadut Khan’s junc tion * with the imperial forces, his camp was attacked and plun dered by a body of Ferfian troops, who flew many of his attendants. Saadut Khan, on receiving information of the difafler, left the King’s apartments, where he had been in waiting, and haflened to the affiflance of his party. Khan Dowrah, the imperial general, marched to the relief of Saadut Khan, and in a fliort time, moft of the imperial officers of Mahomet Shah, who commanded fepa- perate bodies, came into adlion. Nadir Shah, feeing the conteft become ebflinate and ferious, appeared himfelf at the head of his troops, who then were irrefiflable, and a complete vidlory was gained over the Dehli army, which fuffered a fevere lofs in men and officers. Khan Dowrah was mortally wounded : his eldefl fon, with many Omrahs, were flain ; and Saadut Khan fell into the hands of the enemy.

On the contrary, it is feen* that Saadut Khan fuffered feverely in the adtion of Karnal, and was fubfequently treated with much rigour. Sufdar Jung, who refided at Oude at the period of Saadut Khan’s death, fucceeded to the Government; an appointment, ac cording to the tradition of the family, conferred on him by Nadir Shah: yet I am induced to believe, from the liberal condudl of the Perfian to Mahomet Shah, that Sufdar Jung received the promotion at the hands of his own fovereign. Sufdar Jung, ^fter the march of the Perfian army from Dehli, came to court, where he obtained the office of Meer Atufh, or grand mafter of the ordnance. In the year 1746, Ahmed Shah, the Duranny, invaded Hin- doftan, and had advanced to Sirhend, where he was fuccefsfully opw pofed by the Dehli army, in which Sufdar Jung had a confider- able charge.

He is accufcd of commit ting many enormities and wanton adls of violence during the fiege, particularly of cannonading the palace, the deftraction of which could not have facilitated the capture of the fort. The court of Dehli was compelled to accede to the terms of the rebel, who re quired a formal grant of the provinces of Oude and Allahabad, for himfelf and his heirs.—Sufdar Jung died in the year 1754, during the reign of Alumguir Sani, and was fucceeded in the fubahdarry of Oude, by his fon Shujah-ud-Dowlah,J* then about twenty-five years of age.

Ghaze-ud-Dein, who had in 1753 depofed and deprived of fight Ahmed Shah, raifed to the throne Alumguir Sani, whofe eldeft foil Aly-Ghohir, fearing the treacherous difiiofi- tion and ill defigns of the minifier, fled from Dehli.^ This prince ? accompanied by a fmall body of Mahrattas, levied for a few months, a fcanty contribution in the diflridts lying to the fouthward of the capital. But being foon involved in embarrafiments from fo fien- « der a provifion, he folicited the aid of the Rohilla, Najeb Khan, who refufxng to engage in his caufe, he retired into the territory of Shujah-ud-Dowlah. The prince was treated for a certain time with hofpitality and refpedt at Oude, but could not obtain any military aid : and being at length civilly difmifled, he proceeded to Allahabad, which was then held by Mahomet Khuli-Khan, a na tive of Perfia, and a coufin-german of Shujah-ud-Dowlah. Ma homet Khuli, readily entering into the fchemes of the prince, which were diredted at the redudtion of the provinces of Bahar and Bengal, the joint forces crofled the Caramnafla, and were, after various fuccefles, defeated in 1761, by the Englifh troops, at Suam The honourable and humane treatment which Aly-Ghohir expe rienced during his refidence in the Englifii camp, created a jealoufy in Caflum Ali Khan, who from the recent teftimony of the prince’s hoftility to his interefts, and feeing alfo the Englifh ’ * This event happened In 1758* officerFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 141 officer much attached to his perfon, expreffed a virulent diflike of the connexion. The prince accufed Caffum of fomenting thofe diffentions in his army, which ultimately produced a de- fperate mutiny 5 when he probably would have fuffered much in dignity, had he not been protedted by the Englifh army. This event induced Ally-Ghohir to retire into the dominions of Shujah- ud- Dowlah, who received the fugitive king * in a manner expreffive of zealous attachment, and avowed himfelf the champion of the royal caufe. To illuftrate an event in the hiftory of Shujah-ud~Dowlah, we muft advert to the annals of a former period, and notice its origin. Sufdar Jung had appointed to the command of Allahabad, his ne phew Mahomet Khuli Khan, who on the acceffion of Shujah-ud- Dowlah, feems to have wholly withdrawn himfelf from the autho rity of the court of Oude. Aware of the popularity and military abilities of this officer, Shujah-ud-Dowlah did not profecute any diredlly hoftile meafures againft Allahabad. During his expedition into Bahar, Mahomet Khuli had placed the government of his pof- feffions in the hands of Nudjef Khan ; the chief, who at a future period became fo confpicuous in the upper parts of India.

Nudjef Khan would not Men to the requeR, but waited the inftrudlions of Mahomet Kindi, who directed, that Shujah-ud-Dowlah’s family fhould be admit ted into the fortrefs with a certain number of domeRic guards. It is faid, that Shujah-ud-Dowlah introduced into the female equipages a body of armed men, who rufhed on the garrifon, and took the fort without any effufion of blood. This capture, which happened about the year 1761, rendered the affairs of Mahomet Khuli def- perate, and obliged him to become a dependant on the bounty of Shujah-ud-Dowlah $ who, in the courfe of a few months, threw him, on a charge of Rate crimes, into prifon. Mahomet Khuli, from his valour and liberality, was held in high eRimation in the Oude army, which in loud murmurs, and in comparifons not fa vourable to their Prince, warmly lamented his misfortunes. Nudjef Khan, on the capture of Allahabad, had entered into the fervice of Shujah- ud-Dowlah, and exerted himfelf with a zeal that endan gered his own fafety, to procure the releafe of Mahomet Khuli f* but * Mahomet Khuli was cut off at the fort of Tillalabad : — this example difclofed an evil, which is ufually/een to pervade Afiatic Rates. A defpotic Prince cannot always impartFORSTER'S TRAVELS. H3 but this officer had become an objedt of fuch dread at the court of Oude, from the rumours inceffantly circulated in his favor, that the fears of Shujah-ud-Dowlah were not allayed until the deftruc- tion of his prifoner had been compleated by afiaifination. Shujah- ud-Dowlah obtained from the King the appointment of Vizier - y and being now poffeffed of a numerous army, and the imperial perfon, he might juftly be confidered the moll powerful chief in Hindofian. In the year 1763, the war broke out between the Englifh and CaiTum Ali Khan, which after a diverfified train of fuccefs and difaflers, terminated in Caffum’s expulfion from the province of Bengal, and his retreat, in the latter end of the fame year, with impart fo full a force to his fyftem of tyranny, as to fhape to the fpirit of its edicts, the minds and language of his fubjedts. Without the compendious favage aid of the dagger, the road to conqueft and empire, would not perhaps have been fo widely opened to a Timur, a Nadir Shah, or, in our day, to a Hyder Ali. When Shujah-ud-Dowlah had formed the refolution of cutting off Mahomet Khuli, he had not yet confoiidatei * the frrudture of his government. The officers of his army, Perfians, Moghuls, or Afg hans, were daring turbulent men, and had large claims of pay. They faw in Maho met Khuli, a brave foldier, of diftinguilhed birth, of liberal and popular manners. They had witnefied the former treachery of Shuj.ah-ud-Dowlah to him, and fufpedted his future purpofes. Though this Prince dreaded the formidable qualities of Mahomet Khuli, he equally dreaded a formal indulgence of his wiflies. Had he fummoned this officer to a trial, or publickly ordered his death, the danger of a revolution would have been incurred : for the low (fate of his treafury, a long arrcar, and an inherent defi ciency of military genius in the Prince, had flrongly operated in diminilhing the fu- , bordination of the army. But fuch was the barbarous neceffity of the' meafure, the mi- ferable policy of a demi-armed defpot, that he was. compelled to maintain the fafety of his perfon, and the government of his country, by the fecret flab of a poignard. theJ44 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. the remains of his troops, and a large treafury, into the dominions of Shujah-ud-Dowlali. The Bengal Government, which had been long duped by the evaiive replies of the Vizier to the repeated rempn(trance of his fuccouring their enemy, difcovered that he had drawn his army to Benares^ and was preparing to invade Bahar, in conjunction with Caffum Ali. A letter which he addreffed to the government of Bengal, peremptorily avowed his intentions. In arrogant and contemptuous language he fays, “ that the Englifh, f‘ abufing the favours conferred on them by the Emperors of Hin- u doflan, have fomented diiturbances in the empire ; and that in- ftead of limiting their exertions to trade, as became merchants, &lt;c they interfered in the imperial affairs, exalting and depofmg at plea- cc fure, the fervants of the crown. He calls upon them to jultify “ their actions, and to withdraw forthwith, all their people from V the King’s dominions ; and in the event of difobedience, threatens tc them with the royal difpleafure, which he denominated The type of &lt;c God's wrath” Though Shujah-ud-Dowlah had buoyed up CafFum Ali with the promife of reinflating him in the provinces, we cannot eafily believe, that the man who has been recently feen betraying and cutting off his kinfman, who held both the claims of friendfhip and affinity, would without a manifeft and great advantage, incur the rifk of fortune and life, in the caufe of a flranger. Had the arms of the Vizier prevailed in the courfe of the war, the general tenor of his adlions fupports a fair conjecture, that’he would without a fcruple have annexed the conquered country to his own dominions. InFORSTER’S TRAVELS. r 45 VOL. I. T part In the courfe of the year 1764, intelligence was received at Calcutta, that the forces of the Vizier and Caffum Ali, with fome few troops attached to the King, had penetrated into the vicinity of Patna ; whither our troops, on the approach of the combined army, had precipitately retired. The enemy being afterwards repulfed in aftaulting the European trenches, retreated towards the river Soane, where the Vizier made pacific advances to the Englifh officer, who had been authorized to negociate, but pointedly directed to demand, in the preliminary articles the furrender of Sombro, and the Euro pean deferters.* The purpofe of the Vizier, in the defire he had fhewn of obtaining a peace, was only to procure a ceflation of hoflility, that he might recruit his army. It has been even faid, that he endeavoured to bring over to his caufe Jaffier Ali Khan, whom the Englifh, on the expulfxon of Caffum, had a fecond time advanced to the government of the provinces. The Vizier, at a future period, did not difavow this fuppofed correfpondence, which appears to have been conduced on the part of Meer Jaffier, by Nundocomar, who gave the Vizier an affurance of his mafler’s in clination to form a feparate treaty.

Shah Alum, in a condition ill fuited to the title he bore, fought an afylum in the Englifh camp, and loudly accufed Shujah-ud-Dowlah of having forced the royal authority into becoming an inflrument of his ambition, and a fandlion of his hofliie defigns againfl the Englifh.

The flrength of the Viziers army, confifting of cavalry, and a cumbrous body of artillery, was compofed of many nations and tribes, but chiefly of Moghuls. Thefe men, naturally violent and licentious, ill-brooked the failure of payment, and on every demand of arrears, either caufed dangerous tumults, or forced expedients that were injurious to the civil government of his country. Orders of payment were granted on the farmers, or managers of diftridls, on whom thefe foldiers lived at difcretion, until the amount was difcharged ; giving a loofe to every fpecies of diforder, and barely leaving a fum fufiicient for fupplying the other exigencies of the Rate.

After the battle, he with drew himfelf from the Vizier, and having effe£led an accommoda tion with Colonel Munro, he joined the Englifh army : but, alarmed at the repulfe of Chunar-Ghur, and the Vizier’s approach, he fuddenly deferted Benares, and his new connexion.

The revenue department was committed to the charge of men of ability and credit, who in the fpace of a few years enabled him to difcharge a large debt, and to accumulate a fund for the fnpply of public exigencies. On his arrival at Oude, after the Allahabad treaty, he called together, it is faid, his principal officers, and making known to them the engagements he had made with the Englifh, he defired their aid in performing the obligation. Through this mode of requifition, which is often pradlifed by the princes of India in time of need, the Vizier obtained fome aid; though far fhort of his neceffities.

The defeat at Buxar, having relieved the Vizier from the maintenance of a turbulent crowd of cavalry, he began to intro duce in his army, a fyflem of order and regular payment. He had feen that the excellency of the European troops confided in difci- pline, the quality of their arms, and the fkilful management of artillery. He therefore made drenuous and unceadng efforts in forming a body of infantry, with its requifite edabiifhment of cannon, after the European manner. The undertaking was ar duous, and fuch as few Adatic princes could have executed. But the genius, activity, and perfeverance of Shujah-ud-Dowlah, fur- mounted the various obdacles, which rooted prejudice and con- ditutional habit had raifed to oppofe him. Under the direction of fome Frenchmen whom he had invited into his fervice, an arfenal was founded at Fyzeabad, where guns, mufquets and diot, with other military dores, were fabricated with dull and expedition.— From this new magazine, about ten battalions of infantry, and a fmall train of artillery, were equipped. Though this body was formed at the expence of large fums, and much labour, fuch ju dicious arrangements had been adopted for the government of his country, that fufficient funds were created to defray the charge, and to produce a refpedlable treafury.

InFORSTER'S TRAVELS. *59 In the year 1772, a Mahratta array, coramanded by the chiefs, Scindia, Halcar, and Hurry Punt, penetrating into Hindoftan, laid wafte the Duab, and pofibffed themfelves of the Etajoh dif- triels, together with all the territory of Ahmed Khan Bungifh, ex cept the town and environs of Furruckabad. An invafion fo for midable had alarmed the Rohilla chiefs, who, on the approach of the Mahrattas, folicited the Vizier to procure the aid of an Englifli brigade 5 for which they offered the fum of forty lacks of rupees. The Vizier, anxious for the fafety of his own country, on the con fines of which the enemy were already encamped, accepted, with out hefitation, a propofal that would enable him to defray the ex- pences of a body of troops, from which he himfelf would derive an efFential benefit; and he, fome time in the year 1772, applied to the Engiilli Government, for a fupply of forces to defend his dominions againfl the threatened invafion of the Mahrattas.

Hafiz reprefented, that the Rohillas had not received the ftipulated aid, which, if furnifhed in the preceding year, might have prevented the injuries done by the enemy; and that the pre- fent campaign had been maintained by the Rohilla troops : yet he faid, that though the other chiefs fliould withhold their quota of the claimed amount, he would difcharge his proportion to the ex tent of his ability. * At Ramgaut, a ford of the Ganges in Rohilcund,—Vide Rennell’s map.

In promoting and extending his fchemes of conqueft and grandeur, the Vizier muff have ever been expofed to the counteracting power of the Rohillas, who were all foldiers, and fo far from refpe6ting his military capacity, they treated it with contempt and derifion.

Since the period of the treaty of 1765, Shah Alum had re mained at Allahabad, where he had enjoyed a fplendid and a quiet retreat; but his wifties feeming to be centered in enjoying the re- fidence of his capital, he proceeded thither in 1771 : — facrificing, at once, the fubftantial benefits which had been conferred on him Vol. I.

This furrender, to a power deemed hoftile to the welfare of Ben gal, afforded a plea, equally founded on the rights of conqueft and good policy, to affume the relinquifhed territory : and the Vizier, who had with regret made the facrifice, expreffing, after the King’s departure, an earned: dehre of recovering the dis membered country, his requeff, with certain qualifications, was granted.* . . . . _ X 2 In ® The treaty of 1773, contains little important matter, nor would I fatigue the reader with its perufal, did I not apprehend, that fome ferious reflections will occur, in comparing it with the events of the fucceeding year.

That he might the more effe£lually prevent Englifli merchants or their agents from redding or negociating in his country, the Vizier obtained permiflion at this time to impofe large duties on the importation of Bengal, and European merchandize. He had witneffed the rapacious monopoly which the fervants of the Com pany had exercifed in Bengal, and knew that many of the cala mities which had befallen that country, might be juftly afcribed to the European aflumption of its commerce, which had been con- dudfed on terms lb partial to themfelves, that almofl every other trader was obliged to purchafe an European name to cover his property.

The Vizier, to induce the neutrality of the Patans of Furruckabad, during his Duab expedition, promifed in the event of the Mahrattah expulfion, to redore to Muzzuffer Jung all the territory that had been podeded by Ahmed Knan.

Happily for this chief and the refidue of his nation who have now fertilized and made populous a large tracl of country, a powerful advocate came forth in their behalf, who though the leader of a fubfidiary body, affumed in an honourable caufe, the efficient power of protection. The Vizier, in an acri monious complaint preferred againft this officer, obferves, “ that “ as it had been his abfolute determination to extirpate the Ro- Villas, and for that purpofe requefted the affidance of the Eng lifh troops, was it not highly improper in the commanding office!, to enter into fuch a correfpondence without his per- miffion ?

At the clofe of this general defcription of the progrefs of the Englifh arms in Rohilcund, [for the aids afforded by the Vizier can fcarcely claim a notice,] I will infert fome obfervations on the ten dency and effedts of our engagements with the Vizier in the reduc tion of that territory. It is manifeftly feen, that the Government of Bengal were either unacquainted with the virtue and extent of their compact with the Vizier, or that they avowedly affifted him in dripping one of their allies of his hereditary poffeffion. It was roundly agreed to inveft the Vizier with the dominion of Rohil cund, the limits of which were carried to the mountains on the north, and to the river Ganges on the weft. Yet a large tradt of the northern divifion of Rohilcund, was held by Zabitah Khan,* with whom the Englifti were at this time in alliance, and bound by a treaty u to confirm to him his ancient dominions, to confider u him as a dependant on their favor, and that their friends and £C enemies fliould be mutual.” The Vizier, previoufly to the invafion of Rohilcund, had brought over to his interefts Zabitah Khan; who though of the Rohilla fedt, and of near affinity to many of the chiefs, united * The Ton of Najeb-ud-Dowlah. withFORSTER’S TRAVELS, with the Vizier againft the caufe of his nation. But he was fe- verely punifhed for his treachery, and the diftionorable connec tion he had formed j for the Vizier, after the completion of the conqiieft, aiferting that Zabitah Khan had during the war main tained a correfpondence with the enemy, feized on all his terri tory eafl of the Ganges 5 and it remains at this day annexed to the Government of Oude. The conduft of the Vizier alfo to the family of Mohubullah Khan,* evinces that every fentiment of honour and faith fell before the impulfe of his ambition. This chief, who held the town and diftrifts of Biffouly, either from having been involved in a domeilic conteft with thofe Rohilla Rates who appeared in arms againft the Vizier, or from other motives, did not engage in the war. Before the army moved into Rohikund, he fued the Vizier foi piotedbion in behalf of his family and property f which the prince, in ftrong and unequivocal terms, pledged to preferve in fafety and honour. On this faith, Mohubullah Khan remained during the campaign at Biffouly ; but on the Vizier’s airival at that place, he was, with his family, thrown into a rigorous confinement, pillaged of every article of value, and his women were treated with a difgraceful feverity. In an addrefs of Mohubullah to the Englifh commanding officer, in which were alfo inclofed the original letters of the Vizier, granting an unre- * The fon of Dhoandy Khan, who has been already noticed in the Rohilla {ketches, fervedFORSTER'S TRAVELS. *75 ferved prote6lion, he writes, tc The Vizier has deprived us of our ts country, of our riches, and even of our honour j and, not con- £e tented with that, he is going to fend us prisoners to Fyzeabado u We defire no country, no riches, no houfe; but at Biffouly are tc the tombs of our family — near them, and under fome fhade, we beg permiffion to pafs, as mendicants, the remainder of our u days.

The caufe fpecifically held out by the Vizier for making war on toe Rohillas, was their with-holding payment of the fum which they had offered for the fervice of an Englifli brigade. It has been fhewn that the brigade did not arrive in Rohilcund at a due feafon : for the Mahrattas had, in two fucceffive years, com mitted wide devaluations in that country, and were leaving it when the Englifh troops appeared. The arguments ufed by the Vizier, in fupport of the invafion, were weakly maintained, on either a principle of equity or reafon : and his purpofes might have been effedled without the exhibition of fo wretched a cloak. In coun tries where the paths of reflitude and honour are more precifely deferibed and adhered to than in Hindoffan, the political ufage of princes does not widely deviate from the condud purfued by Shu- jah-ud-Dowlah in infuring fuccefs to his fchemes of ambition. But what can be urged in vindication of the Englifh, who, to giatify a rapacious ally, and without even acquiring an adequate benefit to the Rate, effeded the deftrudion of a nation, againft whom they could not fabricate a fpecious caufe of complaint ? The fubjed of the Rohilla war hath already been fo widely dilated by thofe who promoted, and thofe who have condemned, the meafure, that I am fearful of giving difguft by any further enlargement j nor does the difeuffion properly belong to the pur- pofe of this effay : yet I cannot refrain from pointing at the ill policy of the Englifh, in annexing Rohilcund to the dominion of the Vizier. The injuffice of the ad, with the fevere effeds that followed,FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 177 followed, are now admitted by mod: clafles of men 5 and has im printed a deep Rain on the Britifh name in India. The Government of Bengal, in afiigning a reafon for invefting the Vizier with the poffeflion of Rohilcund, afferted, that the more powerful this prince became, the greater advantage would accrue to them from his al liance. The difpolition of Shujah-ud-Dowlah mu ft have been ill known to the Englilh, or they would not have urged fo frail an argument. Jealous of authority, and infatiably ambitious, he had already felt a keen refentment at the encroachments of Bengal 011 his prerogative, and national power, the prefervation of which had long directed the Ipirit of his councils, and the a6tions of his go vernment. The Rohilla nation formed a weighty counterpoife to the real ftrength and reftlefs temper of the Vizier, who finding himfelf checked by a people naturally interefted in keeping a vigi lant watch over his actions, lead: they ftiould fuffer by too great an increafe of his power, mud: have been neceflitated to depend on the Englifti, to repel the encroachment or attacks of the Ro- hillas, and the other northern dates. Our podeffions in India, virtually acquired by the fuperiority of arms, and the eminent abi lities of Britidi officers, can only be preferved, after maintaining that fuperiority, by a fteady adherence to the principles of juftice and public faith,—virtues which did not confpicuoudy diftinguifti the lad: negotiation with the Vizier: nor were the disrates of com mon policy confulted, unlefs the axiom becomes raanifeft, which yoL. l z evenFORSTER’S TRAVELS. even the moil vifionary politician would ftartle at, that nations may be linked together by the bonds of gratitude and friendfhip. Shu j ah-ud-Dowlah was yet employed in arranging the affairs of the conquered province, when a diforder which had for fome time affli&lt; 5 ted him, broke out with fuch violence, that he was obliged to retire to Fyzeabad, where he died in the month of Ja nuary 1775, at the age of 46 years. His death was occafioned by a venereal tumour, that had been unikilfully treated by a French furgeon, who adminiffered to him fo large a quantity of mercury, that his ftrength, then nearly exhauffed, was overpowered by the force of the medicine. The violence of the complaint had been - removed by a profeflional gentleman of the brigade, who ferved in the Rohilla expedition ; but being called into the provinces, the cure was not completed. The difputes of the Vizier and the Engliffi commanding officer, had arifen to fuch a pitch of inve teracy, that though the life of the Vizier was the pledge, and tiltimately the facrifice, he would not folicit the attendance of the field furgeon. Shuj ah-ud-Dowlah died at a period when his thirfl: of do minion had been largely indulged, and his power had arifen per haps to its meridian height. The new members of the Bengal Government who arrived in the preceding year,* were inimical to *FORSTER’S TRAVELS. *79 his public interefts, and feemed even to bear an enmity to his per- fon. The projects with which his mind teemed would foon have matured, and produced the crifis of his fortune 3 when he would either have arifen into powerful independence, or funk into a fta- tkm lefs refpe£lable than that now occupied by his fucceffor. His views were difclofed with fo little referve, and he perfonally gave fuch unequivocal teflimony of his future defigns, that his political charadter was arraigned by all men of difcernment. He frequently told his courtiers, that after the conqueft of Rohilcund, he would penetrate into the territory of the Mahrattas, and take an exem plary vengeance for the ravages they had committed in Hindoftan. He evinced alfo an anxious defire to attain the diredtion of affairs at Dehli, and controul the remains of military power yet preferved to the houfe of Timur. But in this profpedl he was thwarted by Nudjef Khan, who had the office of captain-general, and who had acquired, by his fucceffes in the field, an extendve tradl of country wholly independant of the imperial authority. The Englifh had been taught to believe, that Shujah-ud-Dow- lah, from a principle of felf-interefl, was attached to their nation; that aware of the infufficiency of his own ability, either to encreafe his dominion, or refift the attacks of an enemy, he would ulti mately depend on them for protedlion. However juft their opi nions might have been of the real ftrength and refource of this prince, it would appear that he himfelf held them, (efpecially when augmented by the conqueft of Rohilcund, and other ex- Z 2 pedtedFORSTER’S TRAVELS. T So peered aids), adequate to the accomplithment of purpofes, whiefr bore no relation to an Englifh policy. His pride and ambition, which were exceffive, had been mortified by many a£ts of the Bengal Government and the reRridlions impofed by the Allaha bad deputation, he deemed violently oppreffive, and an infringe ment of the treaty that had been made by Lord Ciive. But con cealing his refentment with an admirable addrefs, he diligently fearelied for expedients to diffolve a connexion which placed him in fo fubordinate a condition. Shujah-ud-Dowlah had felt,, and i-efolved to adopt, the European difcipline. Exclufive of the French who were employed in forming his troops, he had folicited a fupply of Englifh officers to accomplifh his purpofe. But fubfequently to the application, the Government of Calcutta had been new mo deled, and feeing it hoflile to his interefts,, he refufed the fervice of any perfon who held a eommiffion in the Englifh army, I have obtained an information, fupported by documents of fubftantial authority, but which I am not empowered to bring forward, that Shujah-ud-Dowlah, in the lafl moments of his life, was adlively employed in forming fchemes of independence, and even purfuing meafures to extirpate the Englifh power in India. The French officers in the fervice of this prince, improving on his ill humour to the Englifh Government,, reprefented, to him that an alliance with France might be made the effedlual inftrument of emancipat ing his country from controul, and enable him to profecuie with fuccefs his fchemes of conquefl. The Vizier eagerly hearkened, to this.FORSTER’S TRAVELS. i&amp;i this language, and agreed to open the negotiation ; but the keen- nefs with which he commenced it* prevented his feeing the diffi culties which would have obftrudted its purpofe. It was ftipulated by the agents at Oude, that a body of French troops ffiould land on the coaft of Cambay, and marching aerofs the upper part of the peninfula, enter the weftern frontier of Oude. Had the Vizier made the experiment, he would have witneffed the impradlicability of the projefl,. and the vifionary fchemes of thefe French advenr turers. But a miniftry of France,, it is to be prefumed, would have altogether rejefted the meafure, and have forefeen that the attempt of conveying an European force over fo large a tra&lt; 5 t of country, inhabited by powerful military tribes, who entertain a common jealoufy of Europeans, muft have been fruftrated by the furrounding impediments. The faff which is now related, ftands accompanied with fuch a variety of corroborating proofs, that I am induced firmly to believe its authenticity. Shujah-ud-Dowlak who felt the force of the Englifh power both in its open and com- cealed direflions, adted confidently with the ftation he occupied, in endeavouring to remove a preffure fo galling and difgraceful j and had he lived until a later period, when the Englifh nation in India was encountered by a hod: of adailants, and finking under an accumulated load of intedine calamities, we might have been le- verely punidied for having too powerfully armed the hands of this prince. His memory, I trud:, will not be injured, if I place Shu- jah-ud-Dowlah at the crifis adverted to, amongft the foremod: of theFORSTER'S TRAVELS. 1Z1 the enemies of the Engliflij when, to the extent of his abilitieSj he would probably have been feen making ftrong exertions to wipe off his former difgrace, and gratify a private refentment. Hav ing marked the more confpicuous outline of the tranfac- tions of Shujah-ud-Dowlah, I will clofe it with fome defultory obfervations on his character. In treating of the perfonal qualities of this Prince, it mull be noticed, that they pertain to a native of Hindollan, whofe mind, -fettered by religious prejudices and the effefls of a narrowed education, is rarely incited to the fearch of knowledge. The fame actions which are countenanced, and even applauded by a Mahometan, would in the European world be often viewed with difguft, or fall under a fevere reprehenfion of the Law. Under this preliminary fanction, it may withjuftice be faid, that the Prince who has been the fubject of this treatife, pof- fefled a penetrating underflanding, and an active mind. His dif- polition, when no grand object interpofed, had a general tendency to promote the welfare of his fubjects: and he was always averfe to acts of barren cruelty. In the yeai 1765, Shujah-ud-Dowlah’s revenue did not amount to more than one hundred and twenty thoufand pounds, and his army had been fo much reduced by the effe£ts of the defeat at Buxar, that it was incapable of defending his territory; yet at the expiration of ten years, the period of his death, he held a domini on which produced a revenue of three hundred and fixty thoufand pounds; and he maintained in his fcrvice, one hundred thouland fightingFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 1S3 fighting men. When it is admitted, that in the acquifition of do minion, in maintaining an important Ration amongft the Rates of India, and in the falutary government of his country, this Prince difplayed an enlarged genius, it muR alfo be allowed, that he derived a real Rrength, and a large portion of political con- fequence, from the intimate connedtion he had formed with the government of Bengal 5 over which, he feemed, at one period, to have exercifed a prevailing influence. Had Shujah ud-DowIah diffolved his Englifh alliance, the fecurity of his country, and the execution of his fchemes, would have chiefly depended on the force of his army, and the ability of his officers ; for he himfelf was not endowed with the genius of a foldier. He wanted that valour, or courage, which is ever fhewn in the event of common danger, and at every feafon which requires its exertion : but when perfonal Rrength, or fkill, was to decide the combat, Shujah-ud-Dowlah had few equals. He rode, without fear, the moR unruly horfes; he would attack with the fwordj match-lock, or the bow, in the ufe of which weapons he was wonderfully expert, the moA furious animal of the field. This fpecies of courage he feems to have ac quired from his fkill in the ufe of arms, and in the Rrength and adlivity of his body. In fituations of indifcriminate danger; as in the day of battle, he is faid to have been deficient in the ordi nary exertions of fortitude. Though Shujah-ud-Dowlah was fhe oflennble condudlor of the Rohilia war, he evinced throughout the campaign a marked pufillanimity; and in the engagement withFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 1S4 with Hafiz Rhamut, who like a brave foldier had occupied the foremofl rank of the battle, Shujah-ud-Dowlah, fheltering himfelf in the rear, is accufed of betraying evident figns of fear, which were not wholly effaced, until he faw the fevered head of the Ro- hilla chief. Like the men of rank in Afia, he was courteous and affable, had an infinuating addrefs, and accomplifhed manners. Thefe qualifications, united with a large well-formed perfon, and a hand- fome countenance, gave him powerful advantages, as well in his intercourfe with foreign agents, as in the admin iff ration of his own government. With a Toothing flow of language he could calm the moft outrageous claimants, who though aware of the futility of the language, feldom left his prefence but under the impreflion of a momentary pleafure. He had acquired an extenfive knowledge in the practice of every fpecies of deceit, and he could perform with facility every character that was neceffary to conduft the various purpofes of delufion or treachery. Though capable of executing the fubtileft fcheme of intrigue* he was fubjedl to occafional emo tions of anger, which have frequently clouded his countenance at feafons when they were hoflile to his views. In his family, he performed the duties of a mild, indulgent parent, and a kind mailer. When an objeft of policy called for pecuniary diftribution, he could lavifh with a liberal hand; but generofity did not form a fixed part of his difpofition: He was equally rapacious in ac quiring, as fordid in preferving wealth.

DEAR SIR, Before I leave our Indian world, let tne, through you, make an acknowledgment for the many cordial marks of friendfliip, and the kind affiftanee, I have received, throughout every Ration in the provinces.

On the 8th of February, I left Rampour, and arrived at Mo- radabad — ten coffes. This town, Handing on the banks of the river Ramgunga, is fituated in the Vizier’s country, which is fepa- rated from the diftridts of Fyze-ullah, a few miles to the north- weft of it, by the river Ramgunga. Moradabad was once a place of diftin&amp;ion ; but like many other places which once came under that defcription in Flindoftan, is at this v day greatly decayed. Having frequently feen rupees of the coinage of Moradabad, and thofe of a very general currency, I apprehend that an extenfive mint has been, eftablifhed at this place. A hot bath is now amongft the few remains of its grandeur, in which, with great ceremony, I performed the Mahometan ablutions; being received amongft my new brethren, as a Moghul officer, employed in the Vizier’s fervice. Early on the next morning, I left Moradabad, and arrived, under an intenfely hot fun, at the village of Aum.ruah — twelve coffes. On the day of my departure from Rampour, I had a com plete view of the lofty range of northern mountains, whofe fum- mits are covered with perpetual fnows : they extend nearly in a parallel from eaft to weft, and form, I fhould imagine, the north ern barrier between Hindoftan and Thibet. To know the opinion of the people concerning this extraordinary appearance, I enquired of a fellow-traveller, the caufe of fa confpicuous a whitenefs. He 4 ' • ' faid&gt;FORSTER’S TRAVELS, 1^9 faid, that it proceeded from a particular fort of clay, with which the hills in that quarter were covered. I foon perceived that the talk of explaining the real caufe would have been equally arduous with an attempt of making him acquainted with the properties of the magnetic needle ; fo, exprefling my furprize at the Angular quality of the earth, I left him, flattered, no doubt, with the im portance of his communication. The moft flriking object to be feen at Aumruah 3 is the body of a notorious robber, which, fuf- pended by the heels from a tree, affords an ufeful fpe&amp;acle of ter ror. Travelling is by no means attended with danger in this part of India, as may be proved by my example : for in no part of the roads from Benares to this place, though chiefly alone, did I meet with impediment or ill ufage ; and I fliould hold myfelf guilty of an injuftice, did I not unrefervedly declare, that the inhabitants treated me with civility, and, ufually, with kindnefs. On the nth, at Chandpour— 12 coffes. Finding the want of a fervant fubjedted me to various inconveniences, efpecially from the diflike of the Serauce keepers to rub down my horfe, which is I believe, the only fcruple they entertain, I took into my fervice an old foldier, who by his own ftory had been engaged in many a fell encounter : nor did his flgure belye it, for amongfl: the numer ous defperate marks of his profeflion, he bore one on his face which had wholly excavated the right eye.

On the 12th, at Najebabad — eleven coffes. Najeb-ud-Dow-’ lab,* who built this town, faw that its fituation would facilitate the commerce of Kafhmire, which having been diverted from its former channel of Lahore and Dehli, by the inroads of the Sicques, Mahrattas, and Afghans, took a courfe through the mountains at the head of the Punjab, and was introduced into the Rohilla coun try through the Lall Dong pafs. This inducement, with the defire of eftabliftiing a mart for the Hindoos of the adjacent mountains, \ probably influenced the choice of this fpot; which other wife is not favorable for the fite of a capital town, being low, and furrounded with fwampy grounds. About a year after the death of this chief, the fort of Najeb Ghur, which is contiguous to the town, was attacked by the Mahrattas, who had compelled Shah Alum, the reigning emperor, to accompany their army. The garrifon made a good defence, and would not, it is faid, have furrendered, had Zabitah Khan, the fon of Najeb-ud-Dowlah, then lying in the neighbourhood with a refpeftable force, moved to its affiflance. But without offering to face the enemy, or throw any relief into the fort, he croffed the Ganges, and fought fhelter in Ghous Ghur* ^ The chief who has been already mentioned in the Rohilla tradh SinceFORSTER’S TRAVEL!?. *91 Since that period, or rather fince the death of its founder, Najeba- bad has fallen from its former importance, and feems now chiefly upheld by the languifhing trade of Kaflimire. A small karavanferah, the only one in the place, being occu pied, I thought myfelf fortunate in getting admittance into a cook’s fhop, where kabaubs * and ftewed beef were drefled in fa- voury tafte, and all the news-mongers, idlers, politicians, and dis banded foldiers, of the quarter, refort. Whilfl: I was eating my mefs, a boy came in and afked, if any travellers were going to Jumbo or Kaflimire, as the kafilah f would depart on the next day. On enquiring particularly into the ftate of this intelligence, I learned, that about one hundred mules, laden with raw filk, and cotton cloths, and ordinary callicoes, for the Jumbo J maiket 9 had already' moved to the fldrts of the town. Having been fur- niflied with a letter to a banker at Najeb Ghur, who has the ge neral charge of difpatching kafilahs, I was introduced by him to the merchants, who received me without hefltation. When in terrogated on the fcore of my buflnefs, I defcribed myfelf as a Tuik, going to Kaflimire to purchafe (hauls.

After a mature confideration of the perfonal qualities of my fervant, which, poor fellow, had been much impaired by time and adverfe fortune, they were condemned as altogether unfit for the fervice that lay before ns; and one of the pafiengers ill-naturedly obferved, that a man fhould have all his eyes about him who attempted to penetrate into Kafhmire. To fill up this vacancy, (for dreading the difficulties of the journey, he himfelf expreffed a reludtance to proceed), I had the good for tune to obtain a Kafhmirian, who was at all points qualified for my purpofe. He had travelled through a great part of India and Afghapiilan, and I foon difcovered, that together with an infinite refource in every entbarraffment, he poffeffed a fund of curious hiftory, which he did not fail to embellifh with a large fhare of humour and vanity. But I will fum up his eulogy, and at once tell you that he was, take him for all in all, one of the beft lervants I had ever known * and could I have acquired the art of qualifying a rather too redundant fhare of acidity and warmth of difpofition, he would have proved a treafure to me. Being well verfed in all the fcheme of an Indian journey, he made the necelTary prepara tions, and took on him every trouble ; lb I could now freely in dulge my pleafures, which centred chiefly in hearing and telling ftories, and fmoaking my pipe.

I there fore made a purchafe of a large black kummul, or blanket, which being flantingly extended over a flight bamboo frame, compofed of a ridge pole upheld by two- fupporters, and faflened below by* fmall pins, formed a commodious and portable lodging.

The proprietors of the goods, chiefly refidents of Benares, Lucknow, and Furruckabad, had appointed agents to accompany the kafilab, who are not the ultimate venders of the merchandize, but contract to deliver it, and pay the different du ties at fome deftined mart. To flielter the packages from the in clemency of the weather, a fmall complement of tents is provided, as it rarely happens that a kafilah halts at any inhabited place. A plentiful fupply of water, and a plain for the accommodation of the cattle, is all that is fought for. The carriers fay alfo, that a plain more effedtually fecures them againft theft. On the 23d, proceeded 9 coffes further into the foreft, and halted near a large water courfe. This day an occurrence hap pened which involved me in a ferious difficulty. The intenfe heat of the weather, and the fatigue of walking over a tradt of deep fand, induced me, after paffing it, to indulge in my pipe. During this regale, which I enjoyed under the fliade of a tree, the kafilah had gone out of fight. The ground in front being thickly covered with leaves, no appearance of a road was difcernible ; and my horfe, when I mounted, was fo much alarmed, that he would not, but with great reiudlance, move in any diredtion. Whether the animal, from any inftindtive power, perceived the embarraffment of our fituation, or that its organs of fmell were fenfible of the effluvia which is emitted from the body of moft wild beafts, I will not prefume to determine: though I was induced to afcribe its agitation to the firft caufe, having been once placed in a fimilar , B b 2 fituation,i 9 6 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. fuuation, with the difference, that no animals of prey, or of the large fize, were in the neighbourhood* After traverfmg the foreft in various diredlions without perceiving the appearance of tradl or habitation, or the veftige of any creature, except great quantities of elephants dung, I, at length, fell into a narrow path, which leading through a long fpace of woody defart, brought me to a village y whence the people with much kindnefs conduced me to our halting place. On the 24th, at Jumah, a few fcattered houfes — four coffeSo. This hamlet lies within a mile of the Ganges, which, there, has, nearly a fouthern courfe, and is about two hundred yards broad 5 with, a depth of water from ten to fifteen feet. About half a mile, below the place of paffage, is a bed of rocks, extending from the eaft fide more than half way acrofs the river, on which the firearm breaks with fome force. The Ganges doth not here, as in your more happy land, roll its tide through a country fpread with fertile, plains and populous villages, whole inhabitants live in peace and plenty. Here, a thick gloomy forefl, tenanted only by the beads, of the field, fkirts it on the eaflern fide 5 and on the other, an uncultivated flat, over-run with low wood.. On the 25th, eroded the river at the ferry of Nackerghaut &gt;: which is about twelve miles above Hurdwar* the kafilah being to remain fome days at Jumah, I quitted it, and, accompanied by the Kafhmkians, I joined a fmall party of merchants carrying cotton to the town of Nhan.

It was to little purpofe urging that I did not poffefs any property on which duties could be collected, or the juftice of levying a tax on a tra veller. My argument was held wholly inadmiffible, and that of the cuftom-houfe officer being fupported by a party of match lock men, I gave up, with decent refignation, the unequal conteft. When the long roll of galling taxes impofed on other nations, efteemed more enlightened and humane than the mountaineers of Siringnaghur, is confidered, we fhali probably not judge the meafure rigorous, which obliges thofe riding at their eafe to contribute to the relief of a Rate that affords a fafeguard to their perfons by its; falutary government. On the 26th, arrived at the village of Khalfawala — feven coffes. The kafilah halted this day on a pleafant green plain ad joining to the village, and fkirted by a wood, through which a tranfparent flream Rowed in many a winding channel. From its alluring appearance,, though the weather was cold, I was induced to bathe 5 and to prevent interruption, I ffrayed into the thickefli part of the wood, which I found abounding in peacocks, and a variety of other birds, one of which refembled the common fowl, but of a fmaller fize, and of very adtive flight.

The Sicques have an unreidrained accefs into thefe parts through the fouthern hills, which are broken by fmall valleys; and, fearing no oppolition from Zabitah Khan, they can at pleafure penetrate into the lower diftridls of Siringna- ghur. The chief refides at a town bearing the common name of the territory, which lyes, I am informed, about one hundred miles to the north, and by the eafl of Lall Dong. The inadlivity of the prefent rajah has enabled the Sicques to exact from this country a regular tribute.f Of what fuperior courage and re- fource was that chief of Siringnaghur, who, in defiance of Au- rungzebe, the mod: powerful prince of his time, protected the fon f of Bara, hi other of the emperor, and his deadly foe, regardlefs of every menace.

At this place, I faw two Sicque horfemen, who had been fent from their country to receive the Siringnaghur tribute* which is collected from the revenue of certain cuftom-houfes. From the manner in which thefe men w r ere treated, or rather treated themfelves, I frequentiy wifhed for the power of migrating into the body of a Sicque for a few weeks — fo well did thefe cavaliers fare. No fooner had they alighted than beds were provided for their repofe, and their horfes were fuppjied with green barley pulled out of the field. The kafilah travellers were contented to lodge on the ground, and exprefled their thanks for permiffion to purchafe what they required; — fuch is the dif ference between thole who were in, and thofe who were out of power. On the 6th of March crofied the Jumna, and halted on the weftern banks — eight codes. It flows with a clear flream to the fouth-eafl, and has about the fame breadth with the Ganges.* Fifh abound in this part of the Jumna, as I myfelf faw ; but I believe the adjacent inhabitants do not ufe any means of catch ing them. No cultivation is feen in the vicinity of the Jumna, though a fpacious plain extends on the weftern fide, and might be watered without much difficulty from the river. The Siringna ghur territory, which here terminates, is bounded on the north and the north-eaft, by the diftrifts of independent Hindoo Rahahs y ® It is to be noticed, that I crolled thefe rivers at the feafon of their lowed; ebb, on200 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. on the fouthj by Oude; on the weft and north-weft, by the Jumna ; and the fouth-weft, by the dominions of the Sicqnes. From Lali Dong to the Ganges, the country forms with little in terruption a continued chain of woody hills. The elephant, which abounds in thefe forefts, but of a ftze and quality inferior to that found in the Chittagong and Malay quarters, is here only valued for its ivory. From the Ganges to the Jumna, the road lies through an exteniive valley, of a good foil, but thinly inha bited, and interfperfed with wood. The food of the people is vvheaten bread and peafe, the latter being ufually made into a foup ; and, believe me, that in the courfe of my life I never eat a meal with a higher relifh. Vigorous health, indeed, daily labour, and a clear air, will recommend to the appetite worfe things than wheaten cakes and peafe-fbup. The attempt to afcertain the re venue of a country in which I have been fo curfory a fbjourner, would be prefumptuous, I will therefore generally fay, that Sir in gnaghur is computed to give an annual produce of about twenty lacks of rupees. The officer on the weftern fide of the Jumna, taxed me in the fum of two rupees 5 alledging, that being merely a paffenger, and unconnefted with any traiiic from which an advantage would arife to the country, that I was taxable in myfelf. The fame argument being held as at the Siringnaghur .pafs, and efteeming myfelf fortunate at falling under no minuter notice, I paid the fine with pleafure. On the yth, at Karidah — eight coffes: and on the Btb, at Coleroonf FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 201 Coleroon — feven coffes, — hamlets of a few houfes. Here two Kafhmirians, a Sunaffee,* myfelf arid fervant, quitted the kafilah, and on the 9th, arrived at Nhan — eight coffes; the refidence of the chief of a territory of the fame name ; and who on the day of our arrival, made a public entry into the town after a long abfence. A diviiion of the Nban country extends to the fouthward of the head of the Punjab, and bordering the country of the Sicques, they agreeably to a condudt obferved with all their weaker neighbours, took poiTeffion of it. The Rajah armed himfelf to recover the diftridts in quefiiion, but after a defultory warfare in which he ac quired much military credit, he was obliged to fue for peace; nor were the conquered lands reftored until he confented to remit a tribute of two thoufand rupees to a certain Sicque chief. This fum you will doubtlefs deem trifling, and it is fo in your country, where fpecie is plenty, and the mode of living conformably luxurious and extravagant. But amongft thefe mountaineers, whofe manners are rude and fimple, who feek for little elfe than the neceffaries of life, which are produced to them in great abun dance, this amount is important, and to colledt it, requires even oppreffive exertion. The inhabitants, and the foreign merchants of the town, were laid under a fevere contribution for the maintenance of this war; * The name of a Hindoo tribe, chiefly compofed of mendicants \ though I have feen a Sunaflee conducting an extenfive commerce.

The Rajah of Nhan made an entry into his capital, not as Alexander entered Babylon', hut with fome dozen- horfemen, forrily clad, and very flenderly mounted. Had they indeed been better equipped, both themfelves and horfes would have iliewn to little advantage, after clambering up- at lead: fix miles of a-deep mountain, on the fummit of which the fmall, though neat, town of Nhan Rands. This chief, a handfome young man, of a bright olive complexion,, and taller than the middle fize, was dreffed in a veil of yellow filk, and a red turban ; and he was armed with a fabre, a bow, and a quiver of arrows. Though he has made them groan with exactions, he is a great favourite of the people. But he is young and brave, and he liberally dilburfes what he extorts. The joy invariably ex- preffed by the crouds who came to congratulate his fafe return, gave me a fenfible pleafure. They fainted him without noife or tumult, by an inclination of the body, and touching the head with the right hand 5 hailing him at the fame time their father and pro testor. The chief, whilft palling, fpoke to them in terms affec tionate and interefting, which, like a ftroke of magick, feemed in an inffant to erafe every trace of grievance. Such were the advan tages which pleafing manners and a liberality of temper, joined to the other alluring qualities of a foldier, gave to this prince ; and will, unfortunately for their fubjecfs, give to every prince of fimifar endowments■MnMHMKgsr’— 1 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 203 endowments on the face of the earth. Would it not be more productive of the welfare of mankind, that inftead of thefe clin quant virtues, a defpotic ruler poffefled a difpofition thoroughly impregnated with vice ; that with his tyranny, he united cowardice and envy, avarice and arrogance ? The fubjecls of fuch a prince, would be the fooner impelled to break the difgracefui yoke, and by a fuccefsful example, promote the general caufe of civil liberty. A species of fafeination I find has now caught me, and I cannot quit the ground without introducing on it, which I do with a profound reverence for his memory, and entreating forgive- nefs of his {hade for clafiing him in fuch company, the illufixious Julius Cxfar, who may be quoted to confirm the truth of the foregoing pofition. Cato’s fuppofed refiedfion on the charadter of this heroj concludes with imprecating his virtues, for they had ruined his country. No fad! of ancient or modern hifiory, has, perhaps, given more literary pleafure, than the life of Csefar 3 nor perhaps is any record of the ancient annals better authenticated. Had that great man reftored with peace, the liberty of his country 3 had Csefar cherifhed the fire of the Roman fenate, he would have liad no parallel on earth. Yet, “ if Caefar did wrong, he fuf- tc fered grievoufiy for it.”—An exemplary humanity, of rare growth in his day, was the native virtue of Csefar, and is ever the genuine attendant of a great foul. The humane exercife of power throws even a luilre on characters that elfe would deferve our re proach 3 but it adorns the foldier with unfullied radiancy, and C c imparts204 FORSTER'S TRAVELS, imparts to his laurels a bloom, which other wife are viewed with horror, and exhibit only a badge of cruelty and rapine. On the 12th, at noon, I left Nhan, and that evening halting at the village of Saleannah, fituate at the bottom of the hill, and four codes diftant from the town. In this quarter I fir ft faw, ftnce I left Europe, the fir tree,* and the willow, which, as in our country, delights in hanging over a ft ream.

Little danger being now incurred from travelling in fmall bodies, as the moun tains compofe a barrier again ft the depredations of the Sicques or other marauders, our party from this place to Bellafpour was fmall. To affift my fervant I had entertained a Kaflimirian trader in fmall wares, who accompanied me from Najeb Ghur; and he was at all times a ufeful and a pleafant companion. On the 13th. at Sudowra — twelve cofles; a village on a high hill of fceep afcent. The road this day led through a woody and mountainous country, abounding, we were told, with a variety of wild beafts. A tyger had newly marked our path with the im- preflion of his feet, and being then informed that this creature al ways attacks animals in preference to men, I immediately dif- mounted, and led my poor little horfe.

It is faid that a tyger having once tailed human flefh, becomes fond of it, and gratifies his appetite when it can be done without encountering any confpicuous danger. Yet it would appear, that all animals have a dread of man, which proceeding from the novelty of his appearance, or perhaps feme inftindlive fear of his powers of offence, prompts them, when not furious with hunger, to fhun the conteff. — This evening, I was comfortably lodged in the front of a Hindoo retail fhop, where an excellent mefs of peafe and wbeaten cakes was ferved up to us. Pray excufe me for noting this domeffic concern, which is to me of great moment; for by fuch wholefome meals, my ffrength was unimpaired, and my daily progrefs made with vigour. Covered quarters during the night was what we anxioufly fought after, but did not always obtain.

For the benefit of fuch travellers who may come within your knowledge, and be difpofed to purfue my track, you mull inform them that the fliop-keeper at Lawafah is a great rogue, a noify wrangler, and mixes a great quantity of barley with his wheat-meal. As he is the only man of his profeflion in the place, there is no remedy for the evil but laying in a flock at Sudowra, where they will find honefl treatment, and lodging to boot. Though it is not very probable that this recommenda tion will be of material ufe to the honefl man at Sudowra, yet I feel a pleafure in mentioning his goodnefs to me.

In the evening, our little party went to a farmer’s cottage, where we fohcited permiffion to lodge our baggage, and to (leep under one of his (beds. The farmer candidly faid, looking debfadly in my face, which he feemed not to like, that he was apprehendve that an out-fide lodging would not fatisfy us. It was with much diffi culty he would believe that we had fought his houfe only for (belter, and it was not until the Kafhmirian had fnewn him fome fmall wares for fale, that we were differed to occupy the front of his houfe.

On the 19th, at the Village of Tayanaghur — ten cofles. On the 20th, at Bellafpour — twelve codes, the refidence of the Ranee or female ruler of the Kalour territory.

Kalour is bounded to the northward by the Kangrah didridhs; to the eadward by a large tradl of country called Buf- feer * to the fouthward by Nhan; and to the weftward by the Punjab 5 and its revenue is faid to amount to twelve lacks of rupees. On my arrival at Bellafpour, I found the Ranee engaged 3 n a war with the chief of Kangrah, on the limits of whofe country her army was then encamped. It may not edify or perhaps enter tain you to know the caufe of this fell difpute, which however had taken fuch poffeffion of the minds of the mountaineers, and to them was fo important an event, that they feemed to think the hills and foreds of Bellafpour the feat of univerfal war.. The fiege of Troy, and the conflifts on the Scamander, would have appeared as mere fkirmifhes to thefe fylvan heroes ; and they pro bably would have allowed no other degree of comparifon, than that women were the caufe of them both. But as I myfelf became involuntarily intereded in their dory, and having little other matter to communicate, I am induced to intrude a Iketch of it on your patience, To deduce this eventful matter ah ovo, I mud call your atten tion to the Days of Acbar, who is faid to have been the firit Maho metanFORSTER’S TRAVELS. aof itietan prince who reduced the northern mountains of Hindoftan to the obedience of the empire. Towards the northern limit of Kalour, is a flrong hold on an eminence, called the Kote Kan- grah, the redudtion of which detained Acbar, who commanded the expedition in perfon, a whole year, according to the tradition or this quarter. To reward one of his officers who had fignalized himfelf in this ferviee, he beftowed on him the captured fort, with a confiderable fpace of adjacent territory.

The prompt decifion of our councils,, the vigour of adlion, mull in every conteft with: them command fuccefs. This conditutional inaflivity and lan guor of the mind, have been farther promoted by the creed of pre- deflination, and aftrology. A minute attention is fhewn by the natives of India to certain days,, hours, and minutes. On the commencement of any fervice, or in the performance of even the ©rdinary duties of life, their condudl is regulated by the immediate period; and fliould the calculator difcover a reludtancy, or defire of delay in his employer, or apprehend that his own reputation might fuifer in the event, he ufually lays a bar on the Undertaking- Over fuch men what advantage do we not poffefs ?. Yet in fome of the late military tranfadlions of India, we have weakened our claim to thofe natural and acquired powers, which Englifh foldiers in moflof their aflions have difplayed in this country.

Our conduft to one * of them has been as unjuft: as it was unwife, nor do I know whether to attribute the favourable conclulion of the event -f* to good fortune, or to the folly of our enemies. On the evening of the 23d, crofted in a ferry-boat, the Setloud, a narrow deep and rapid river, full of windings, and halted at a fmall village oppofite to Bellafpour, though the diftance from the ferry was nearly two miles from the town. A Tumboo-fhall ka- filah had encamped on the north fide of the town on its way to Dehli and Lucknow, with the proprietors of which, or rather their agents, I formed an acquaintance; and through their influence with the colie6tor of the cuftoms I was permitted to pafs without obftacle.

From the weftern bank of the Setloud, we proceedetbon the 24th of March to the village of Comour Hattee, eight coffes. An Hattee, which in the language of this country lignifies retail (hop, affords the belt accommodation for a traveller, and I always endeavoured to make one my halting place. There I procured wheat, wheat-meal, peafe, and ghee,* of which my common fare is compofed, and by the applying in civil terms, the fhop keeper commonly indulged me with the ufe of the front part of his fhop.

Having refided for the fpace of four months in this fpot under fmall fiieds made of the boughs of trees, you will naturally fuppofe, that the effedls refulting from the fituation could neither have been plea- fant or falutary. In all, were four very ordinary tents, one of which was occupied by the generaliffimo, a brother, and I believe an elder one, of the late chief of Beilafpour 5 for the order of fuccefiion in the line of primogeniture, is not at this day firidlly adhered to in India, either amongfi: the Hindoos, or Mahometans. This perfonage, from age, being incapable of performing any adtive duty, had ap pointed a younger brother to the executive command. The Ranee, with her fon, a youth of about ten years of age, and.a favourite Sunnaflee, had retired during the war to an adjacent fort, where fhe diredled the general operation of the war. Having entered thus far into the hiftory of Bellafpour, I will proceed to explain fome • parts of the Rory of this lady, which as they tend to place female condudl in a diflinguiflied point of view, I embrace the occafion with pleafure. And here permit me to declare with a fervent fin- cerity, and an honourable fenfe of the dignity of charadler to which I afpire, that I am a zealous friend of women, and that as far as the offering of my mite will contribute to their aid, or to a difplayFORSTER’S TRAVELS. ay a difplay of their various merit, it fhali be held forth with a wil ling hand. Quit ting thefe encomiums on myfelf rather than on thefex, I am to inform you that the Bellafpour Ranee, on the death of the late chief, which happened about three or four year ago, declared herfelf the guardian of her fon, and regent of the country. She was oppofed in this purpofe by her hufband’s brother, the perfon who now commands the army; and ftie had alfo to combat the many difficulties incident in this country to her lex, the mod: em- barrafiing of which was a preclufion from public appearance; yet baffling every attempt made to fubvert her authority, die firmly efl:abliflied herfelf in the government. * The e^ent of the Ranee’s fuccefs, brought on the confinement of her competitor; but after a fhort time, during which he experienced a lenient treatment, he was releafed. This dame of fpirit, who hath evinced ftrong traits of a difpofition fitted for conducing either military or civil fchemes and who hath hitherto been fortunate in them, is at this day en thralled by the force of love.

The objedt of this lady’s favour I law, and the choice fhe has made is a proof of good tafte. He is a young handfome Hindoo, of a religious tribe, who, contrary to the ufage of his feft, which is founded on rules almoft as fevere as thofe of the Carthuiians, dreffes gayly, and in the Mahometan fafhion. From a certain levity, though politenefs of manners, fet off by the delicate fancy of his apparel, you at the firfl glance pronounce him a favourite of the women. Such are the changes which love can produce, even amongft a people who obferve their religious ordinances with a fcrupuloufnefs irreconeileable to com mon fenfe, and which in fome inftances border on grofs abfurdity.* Thus much for the Ranee of Beilafpour, to whom be all fuccefs 1 I now learned that my progrefs towards the Kangrah army, would without the proteftion of an efcort, be attended with much rifk. In order to procure fo effential an accommodation I waited on the commander in chief, then fitting under a banian tree, and attended by his principal officers, the greater part of them clad in native buff. Some new levies were paffing in review before him, that had come in from the country, or rather the woods * * Tn the neighbourhood of Benares is a fed! of religious Hindoos, who it is faid for bear making any ufe of their hands, even on the moft neceffary occafions ; but are fed and ailiiled by others. forFORSTER’S TRAVELS. for they bore a ftrong refemblance to the defeription given in hea then Rory of the fatyrs, fawns, and other branches of the fylvan race ; nor do I think that ail the powers of a Pruffian drill fer- jeant, extenfive as they are, could have impreffed on them a com petent knowledge of military difcipline. On approaching the chief, I made him an offering of a rupee, laid on the corner of my veil. You will be pleafed to notice, that the piece of money is, not to be placed on the naked hand, but on a handkerchief, or fome part of the garment held out for that purpofe; and though the fuperior fhall be difpofed to favour the client, yet from mo tives of generofity, or an attention to his condition, it often hap pens, that he does not take the offering, but touches it with his finger. The honour is then fuppofed to be conferred, and the hope of obtaining protedlion or affiffance, if fought for, is entertained. The chief received me with civility, and complied with the requeft, that our party might be permitted to accompany the firft meffenger who fhould be difpatched into the Kangrah camp 5 and he alfo in timated, that fome letters which were preparing, would foon be forwarded. He looked obliquely at my offering, which he touched, but would not receive.

(alfo the aft in g raafter of ceremonies), I was told that I might prefent my offering, which being an Alum Shahee rupee,* a coin of rather an inferior value in this quarter, I was received with a frown, and my money underwent a ftrift examination. Would you not imagine that I had been bargaining with a Jew pedlar, in (lead of conferring with the chief of a country ? Though I was mortified at beholding among us fo glaring a meannefs and want of decorum, yet as a trait of national charadter was difclofed, I received feme fatisfa£fion in obtaining fo unequivocal a teftimony of it. In further proof of the inconfiflency of condu&lt; 5 I, as well as a want of fortitude in the people of this country, I am induced to relate to you an event, (though foreign to the immediate purpofe of this letter) that came within my own knowledge. At the time when the Mahometans were driven from Kattuck, the chief of that territory fled to Bengal, where having expended the amount of the treafure and moveables that had been preferved, he went to the coaft of Coromandel, and was received into the lift of pen- fioners maintained by the Navaub of the Carnatic. During the regular payment of the allowance, this man enjoyed eafe 5 and by the fhew of a palanquin, and a refpedtable retinue, be maintained a certain ftate. The proviso 11 which the Navaub at that time found it expedient to make for penfioners of a higher order, caufed a deduction from the ftipend of his Kattuck dependant* who then • A r»i&gt;ee of the prefect reign. laidFORSTER’S TRAVELS. zzi laid down his palanquin, and purchafed a fmall horfe. This was douhtlefs a mortifying degradation ; but the cup of his forrow was not yet full: for on a greater redu&amp;ion, and at length, a total abolition of the penfion, this poor man lofmg fight of the chara6ter he had fupported, and blinded by a vanity which difcouraged all induftrious exertion for a livelihood, became notorioufly addifted to fraud, and petty-thefts; and was fcarcely faved from an igno minious end. I have quoted thefe examples, thinking them more conclufive in conveying to you a knowledge of chara&amp;er, than any foeculative obfervation. But when the mind at an early period, is not accuHomed to behold and admire examples of integrity and honor, or taught to fhun with horror and contempt the habits of vice; on the contrary, when the inftrudtion given to youth, tends to appreciate the duties of life by the performance of futile ceremonies, and the Rudy of legends pregnant with fable, or violent prejudices, we are not to wonder at fuch afts of depravity. The Hies tormented me fo much in the Bellafpour army, that I could not but with difficulty lecure my food from their vile at tacks. A certain quantity of poifon I believe is contained in the body of an Indian fly, for on fwallowing it, a naufea and vomiting almofl immediately fucceed.

The heat was in the extreme, with a compound of fmells arifing from the filth of the people, that groffiy tainted the air : and I became fo anxious to efcape, that I had determined to embrace any mode of operation which might lead to a change of quarters. This eagernefs had almofi: produced a meafure, which probably would have caufed a material failure of my plan. Two meffengers who were to convey propofals of peace to the Kan- grah camp, promifed to conduel our party thither in fafety, and I had refolved to commit myfelf to their charge, though much op- pofed by my affociates, who decidedly faid, that thefe men would betray us. The chief’s chobedar,* a brother Mahometan, alfo endeavoured to imprefs me with an ill opinion of thefe meflengers. Had they formed any fcheme of mifchief, it was happily fruftrated on the evening previoufly to our intended departure, by the arrival of a drove of affes, laden with iron, who were purfuing our route. On the 29th, the joint party moved, and had arrived at the boun dary of Bellafpour, eight miles diftant from the camp, when our troubles came thick upon us. Two of the Kangrah horfemen ap peared in front, and paffing me, went towards the rear, where they plundered the ironmongers to the amount of one hundred * A perfon who carries a filver flick before men in high flation. rupees.FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 223 rupees, which is accounted a large fum in thefe parts. They feized alfo on a Kafhmirian, who was lagging behind, and were in the adt of Gripping him, when he loudly cried out, which was not true, that he was my fervant, and that I was a perfon of fome diftindfion. This intelligence induced the horfernen to follow me; but on approaching, one of them obferved that I had the appear ance of a balla audimee* and ftiould not fuffer any moleftation; that only ilragglers, and fmgie travellers fell under their notice. Seeing them difpofed to this civil treatment, I procured the Kafli- miriatTs releafe, as alfo that of my own fervant, who had come up during the parley, and had been likewife taken into cuftody. It was, I believe, a fortunate event for the prifoners that I re turned, for our cavaliers Were then in quell of prey, nor did they feem nice in the diftindtions of perfons; for whilil I remained, fome ftray pafFengers were laid under contribution, from one of whom, an afs driver, they took a pair of (hoes.

Imagining our approach to have been that of the enemy, the Sicques were preparing for the fight, to which they loudly exclaimed, in the tone of religious ejacula tion, that their prophet had fummoned them. In token of re- fpecf, I had difmounted, and was leading my horfe, when a Sicque, a fmart fellow, mounted on a active mare, touched me in palling. The high mettled animal, whether in contempt of me or my horfe, perhaps of both, attacked us fiercely from the rear, and in the afTault, which was violent, the Sicque fell to the ground. The aflion having commenced on the top of a hill, he rolled with great rapidity to the bottom of it, and in his way down, left be- v hind him his matchlock, fword, and turban : fo compleat a de rangement I feared, would have irritated the whole Sicque body ; but on evincing the fhew of much forrow for the difafter, and having affiduoully affifted in invefting the fallen horfeman with his fcattered appurtenances, I received general thanks. My good fortune, which had this day repelled a feries of perils, conveyed me in fafety to the camp of the Kangrah, or as he is often called, from a more ancient name of his country, the Katochin chief. We regaled ourfelves this evening with great joy, having fufFered from hunger as well as fatigue, though we had only travelled about fixteen or feventeen miles.

The common road to Jumbo from hence, lay through Nadone, the principal town in the Kan- grab ‘country, and through the diftridf of Huriepour; but thefe places being then overrun by the Sicques, we were obliged to de viate from the ufual track, and proceed to the weflward. It is to be feared that thefe turbulent mountaineers, the diilurbers of their folitary abode, will flir up fuch commotions in their land, as to wholly fhut up this road, the only fecure one from India to Kafli- mire, or render the paflage fo precarious, that no advantage will compenfate the rifk.*' On the 30th, we moved, and joining the kafilah of the iron merchants again, accompanied it to Sooree — fix cofles : — a fmall village, of which moft of the carriers were inhabitants. The halt was made at this village from a defire of the carriers to fee their families, for it was at the diflance of a full day’s journey out of their road.

A continuance of the rain detained us at Bompal until the ad of April, when we arrived at Chumbah — eight coffes: — a fmall village, depending on the chiefship of Jeffoul. At a Ihort diftance from Bompal, we were flopped by the collector of Na- done, who had come three miles from his houfe, in defiance of the troubled Rate of the country, to receive from us a toll duty of a few pence.

This day, our little party which had been joined in the Bel- lafpour camp by the Kafhmirians, refolved, from a dread of the Sicques, who had in veiled the common track, to quit the kafiiah, and through detached paths endeavour to reach Jumbo.

They had been fent to collect: the tribute which the Sicques have impofed on all the mountain chiefs from the Ganges to jumbo ; and, offended at the delay of the payment, thefe high fpoken men were holding to the affrightened Hindoos, that ftyle of language, which one of our provincial magiftrates would diredt at a gipfey, or fturdy beggar. Indeed, my friend, no ordinary exertion of fortitude, no common fhare of philanthropy is required, to wield with temper the rod of power; which, from the frailty of his nature, man is ever inclined to ufe w r ith feverity. Yet furely when he looks into himfelf, he will fee many a ftrong reafon to qualify its ftroke. From a fpirit of impatience, which having long 7 adluated me, I am induced to think is innate, I quitted my companions, and going about a mile in front, fell in with a horfeman, who had much the appear- . ance of a freebooter; but being well armed, and evidently the ftronger man, I did not apprehend any rifk from a rencounter. Seeing me a ftranger, and from the quality of my equipment, a fit fuojedl for plunder, he flopped me, and in a peremptory manner, afked my occupation, and place of abode. My anfwers were neither explanatory nor gracious, and my departure abrupt, though he nad expreffed a ftrong deiire of farther communication ; and feemed offended at the unconcern of my deportment. About a quaiter of a mile farther on, I met a Sicque horfeman, w r ell armed, who was evidently in fearch of adventure.

The perfon whom I firfl faw, had halted, and on the junction of the Sicque, a council was held by them on the fubjedl of my moveables; the refult of which was to return and take them from me. My companions who gave me this information came up while thefe men of the blade were communing on the plan of at tack, and an eclairciffement took place. They difcovered that thefe footmen, four in number, were affociates of him, whofe pro perty they intended to invade ; and naturally concluded, that how ever decided the odds of two to one might have been, fo great an additional ftrength to our party, would manifeftJy turn the chances; and, fvvayed probably by this forcible argument, they gave us no moleftation. On the 4th at Tulwara, — ten coffes 5 a village in the diftridt of Dutar, where the Sicque chief has eredted a fmall fort, and holds the adjacent territory. The country to the fouthward now aflumed a level afpedl, which to me had an effedt inexpreflibly pleating ; for my eye had long been difguded, and, I may fay, imprifoned, by mountain piled on mountain, till the highed pierced the clouds. The diftridl of Dutar, or Dutarah, extends on the interior hde of the Punjab hills, through which our late fouthern inclination had penetrated. In this day’s journey, our party was reduced to the Kafhmirian trader and myfelf; three Kafhmirians, wllQFORSTER’S TRAVELS. *30 who had joined our party in the Bellafpour camp, went on before, and my fervant lagged behind. In the evening, having reached file bottom of a hill, we obferved a body of horfemen defcending in our road. The fight of thefe men, who were immediately known to be Sicques, gave a ferious alarm ; and on their near ap proach, I depofited, unnoticed by my companions, my little pro perty of bills and cafli in an adjacent bufh. But we had formed an unjuft opinion of thefe cavaliers; and I am to think myfelf fingularly fortunate, in being enabled in two inftances to place their condu6t in a favourable point of view. This party, con fiding of about two hundred, many of whom were Mahometans, was then marching into the Hurriepour diftrift. Summoning an affe&amp;ed compofure of countenance, we affefted to fmoke our pipes, from which fome of the Mahometans took a whiff e?i paffaiit, and at the fame time gave us an afiurance of protection againft any ill defigns of their aflbciates ; for notwithftanding the looks we had borrowed, they muff have feen much embarraffment in them. After their departure, I took my valuables out of the bufh without the obfervance of my companion, who was tranfported with joy at the efcape, fwearing, by his beard/ that on reaching, our evening quarters, he would offer up to Mahomet, or to his national faint Mucdoom Saib, two-pennyworth of brown fugar, in thankfgiving for the extraordinary prefervation.

The truth of this remark will be readily acknowledged by thofe, who, from the like adventures, have reached in the evening a fafe re treat. My friend, who faithfully performed the tenor of his pro- roife, reprobated my infenfibility of the providential interpofition that had been made in our behalf. It was in vain to urge the merits of internal prayer, or to affert, that I had already offered unfeigned thanks for our efcape, which I trufted would not be the lefs acceptable from the want of fugar. This being a do&amp;rine wholly repugnant to his creed, which exifted only in noify and oftentatious ceremony, I drew on myfelf a further fevere reproach.

From thefe people I learned, that the chief of Jumbo was much embarraffed in his finances, from a deftru£hve war he had entered into with the Sicques : that to raife fupplies he had levied a general contribution on the inhabitants of the city ; and that his exactions had induced many of the principal merchants to abandon the place. The Sunallees had employed in their fervice two or three Kafhmirians, who are men of an uni- verfal occupation, and endowed with unwearied patience and acti vity in the eaufe of gain. They told me that I fhould incur a ma- nifeft rifk in going to Jumbo, at a time, when the appearance of perfons of any property, attracted the notice of government: an information then more alarming, as my bufinefs at Jumbo required a perfonal attendance. Whilft I am writing of Nourpour, it may not be fuperfluous to mention, that a refpeCtable merchant named Daud Khan, a native of the Punjab, refides in that town.' He had lived many years at Jumbo, but having felt the oppreffion of that government, he has taken refuge in Nourpour, where he en joys, with a moderate fecurity of property, the benefit of a fine air and a plentiful country; and fhould any of our countrymen come this way in the Mahometan character, they may be confi dently allured of deriving conveniency, from an acquaintance with Daud Khan.

About eight miles to the north-weft of Bun- guree, and oppofite to the fort of Biftbuly, crofted the Rawee,^ which is about one hundred and twenty yards in breadth, and very rapid. In the ferry-boat were two Sicques going to the fort, of which, a detachment they belonged to, had taken pofteftion, in confequence of being called in to the affiftance of the Biflbuly chief. Though this be the invariable refult of every connexion made with the Sicques, the infatuated mountaineers never fail to feek their aid when engaged in war. A bordering chief had in vaded the Biftbuly diftridls, plundered the inhabitants, and burned their villages, before any oppofttion was made. The Sicques were called in to repel the enemy, and defend the fort of Biftbuly but after performing the required fervice, they became pleafed with their new fituation, and refufed to relinquilh it. A qjjick progrefs through this country, and avoiding the track of the Sicques, were ftrongly, though unneceflarily, recom mended to us. The boatman at the ferry of Biftbuly, though a brother Mahometan, tmde an exorbitant demand of hire, which was conftderably leflened by the interference of the Sicque horfe- men, who faw the impofition, and had only to make known their will to efifedt obedience.

An obliging houfe-keeper in the village of Plaffee, accommo dated me this evening more agreeably than I could have expedled. His little tenement was compofed of materials that had refitted the late conflagration of the country, and he had, with his family, re fumed the quiet pofleffion of it. Seeing me opprefled and languid, from the effedls of a fever, which had feized me on the road, he procured me a bed, and gave me every nourifhment which his houfe afforded. On the nth, at the village of Buddoo — tencoffes; the re- fidence of a petty chief, tributary to Jumbo. This day an annual fair was held at an adjacent hamlet, which being near our road, we mixed with the numerous fpedlators of the feftival.

My fervant did not arrive this evening, and from having hitherto wholly relied on his fervices, I fuftained a great inconveniency. But a Kafhmirian family at Ruddo, on the fcore of an acquaintance with my com panion, in a certain degree relieved it, by giving us a friendly re- ception, and a {lender fupper. On the 12th at Mancote — eight coffes. A chief depending on Jumbo refided at this village, which Rands on an eminence partially fkirted by a fmall river. Here my troubles branched out anew, and though not deferving a rank in the lift of misfortunes* involved me in various difficulties. My Kafhmirian affociate having by miflake proceeded beyond our place of rendezvous, there was no one to prepare my vi&amp;uals, or to take care of the horfe. Though the Hindoos hold in abomination the performance of any. menial office for Grangers, yet the {hop-keeper at Mancote, from whom I had purchafed the neceffaries of the day, afforded me great affiffance. He gave me houfe-room, a bed, and allb fome of his houfehold utenfils, for holding the horfe’s corn, and my own provifion. From an affociation with thofe who had obviated my* 3 8 FORSTER’S TRAVELS, my various wants, and had even rendered the journey a pleafant one, I was at once deprived of all help. In the firft place, I cleaned and fed my horfe, nor did he deferve lefs at my hands ; for he was a good-tempered, fure-footed, aftive animal. Had he not indeed been thus qualified, he could not have fupported fuch fa tigue, or have clambered over the deep and and rocky mountains that had hitherto flood in his way. After this care, it was necef- fary to remedy the Rate of my own wants, which became urgent and clamorous, for I had not eaten any thing that day. Being told that a mendicant Seid* of eminent fandlity refided in the upper part of the town, I prefented myfelf to him, told my flory, and earneflly entreated his aid. I had imagined that the man who lived on public benevolence, whofe welfare in the world was promoted by a common exercife of humanity, would have chearfully come forward to my fuccour, efpecially as the requeft had no tendency to touch his property. But I reckoned without my hofl. Never did mitred priefl in all the plenitude of his power, rolling amidfl the pluralities of benefice, regard a meagre curate with a deeper contempt of eye, than did this haughty de fendant of Mahomet receive my fuppiieation. Simply fetting forth the lofs of my fervant, and the inability to fupply his place, I requefled that he would dir eft his people to prepare for me a meal, the materials of which were all m readinefs.

After warmly expatiating on the difficulties that furrounded me, throwing in alfo fume flridfures cn his conducf, he grumbled an affent, but with an exprefs provifo that I fliould produce fire-wood. 1 could as eafily have brought him a bulfe of diamonds as a ftick, for it was then dark, and indeed hunger and fatigue had made me incapable of exertion. Turning from him with indignation, I loudly reprobated his violation of what even the rudefl Mahome tans hold facred, the rights of hofpitality ; a ready performance of which, he ought to know, was earneilly enjoined, and that the Divine vengeance was peculiarly denounced againfi: all who tranf- grefs its law. This exclamation, delivered with heat, rouzed the attention of his adherents, one of whom defiring me to be paci fied, propofed to adjuft the embarraffment. He carried me to the houfe of a finging girl, who, on learning the Rory of my wants, tucked up her garment with a fmiling alacrity, and commenced the bufinefs of relieving them without delay.

Yet I affirm to you that it is a genuine Rory, and were Mancote at no further difcance from Lucknow, than Shieck Seray,* you might procure, from this honed: girl, a teftimony of its truth. On the 13 th I arrived at Man fir — eight coffes. The country now became more open, and the vallies better cultivated than any I have feen to the weilward of Biffouly. The journey this day was pleafant, and what in my proceeding was extraordinary, I did not deviate from the road, though alone. In paffing near an en campment of beggars, (a merry troop they were) they defired me to alight and take fome refreffiment: the invitation was thankfully accepted, and I partook of a coarfe, but cordial meal, which was ferved up with frequent profeffions of welcome.

At this village the wife of a Mahometan oilman conducted my culi nary bufinefs, but in a manner far different from that of my late mufical friend : file took moft unwarrantable emoluments out of an ill-dreffed fupper; and her cat, which feemed to have a conge- nial temper, made an attack on my baggage at night, and carried oft the little flock of provifions which I had prepared for the next day’s breakfaft. Lest my arrival at Jumbo fliould excite enquiry, which from the difpofition of the chief might not be favourable, I denominated myfelf an officer in the Jumbo fervice, travelling from the army, which was then in the field, to the city. The road this day lead ing in a fouth-wefl * direction, was the moil dreary one I had ever feen, and became more fo from the want of a companion. On approaching fo large a town as Jumbo, I expecled to have feen a moderately populous country; but the afpedl was altogether the reverfe. Many miles of the road lay through a defile of land, the Tides of which confifl of lofty rocks, and nearly perpendicular.

One of the family fuffered much pain from a lacerated finger, and as all perfons of my colour are in India denominated furgeons, wizards, and artillery-men, I was called upon to adminifter help, which I did gratis to their great fatis fact ion. Towards the evening, I arrived at the lower town of Jumbo, where feeing a retired houfe at which I intended to have fought admiffion, I difcovered a perfon who, about a month before, tra velled for fome days in the fame party with me ; but being em ployed on fome fervice of difpatch, he had left it.

Whatever partiality I might en tertain for my own merits, I was neceifarily impelled to tee that his affiduity proceeded from a belief of the opulence, and the wiili of tranfadling the commercial bufmefs of his gueil. After he had gone through the long routine of my extraordinary qualities and accomplifhments, of whofe excellency he had been advifed by his correfpondent at Lucknow, he congratulated my fingular good for tune in having met him fo early on my arrival for except himfelf, I fliould not have found an honed: man in Jumbo. Such, my friend, is the effervefcence of Oriental fpeech, which if expofed to the colder air of the north, would fubfide into that drain of language fpoken every day in Change Ally and Cheapfide. It was bed: not to undeceive my Kafhmirian, as the chara&amp;er of a merchant is more refpedled here than any other, and under which the lead fufpicion is entertained of a dranger. On prefenting my bill to the banker at jumbo, I found, from its having been twice drenched in water, that the folds adhered together as firmly as if they had been paded. The banker,* with much good nature, foaking the paper in water, and opening the folds with care, was enabled to read, though with difficulty, the contents. Had he been difpofed to piotradt the pay ment, there was fufficient caufe, but holding out no demur, he at once faid the bill was a good one, kindly obferving alfo, that as ^ His name is Juala Naut, the nephew of Kafhmiry Mull, at Benares.FORSTER’S TRAVELS. my jou rney ha I been long and fatiguing, I Ihould have brought an oid r for a larger fum. Jumbo is fituated on the lade of a hill, and contains two dif- t 0(51 diviiions, which are termed the upper and the lower towns. The bottom of the hill is wafhed by the river Rawee,* about forty or fifty yards broad, and fordable at moft feafons of the year. Many water-mills Rand on its banks for grinding corn, which are conifruffed in a neater manner than any I have feen in India, and were introduced by the Kafhmirians, who have greatly improved as well as enriched this town. The fhort Ray at Jumbo prevented me from procuring much fatisfaffory information of its hiRory, or the caufes which have produced its important commerce, riches, and luxury : for Jumbo, even in its decayed Rate, is a mart of the firR note in this quarter of the country.

This obftrudlion diverted the Kalhmirian trade into the channel of Jumbo, which being Ihut up from the Punjab by a fhong chain of mountains, difficult of accefs to cavalry, it has been preferred to the Lahore road, though the journey is te dious, and the expenfes of merchandize mcreafed Runzeid Deve, the father of the prefent chief of Jumbo, who defervedly acquired the char after of a juft and wife ruler, largely contributed to the wealth and importance of Jumbo.

He was fo defirous alfo of acquiring their confidence and efleem, thatFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 247 that when he has been riding through their quarter during the time of prayer, he never failed to hop his horfe until the pried had concluded his ritual exclamations. The Hindoos once com plained to this chief, that the public wells of the town were defiled by the veflels of the Mahometans, and defired that they might be reiln£ted to the water of the river; but he abruptly difmiffed the complaint, faying, that water was a pure element, defigned for the general ufe of mankind, and could not be polluted by the touch of any clafs of people. An adminiftration fo munificent and ju dicious, at the fame time that it enforced the refpeft of his own fubje&amp;s, made Jumbo a place of ex ten five commercial refort, where all defcriptions of men experienced, in their perfons and property, a full fecurity. The articles of merchandize condituting the trade of Jumbo, and Kafhmire, are tranfported by men, ufually Kafhmirians, whofe burthens are heavy, two of them making the load of a drong mule, and the hire is fixed at the rate of four rupees for each car rier.

The other caufe afcnbed, which leems to be more foic.ole, is the ftupendous height and Reepnefs of the intervening mountains, which renders the paiiages dangerous, if not wholly im practicable, to either a horfe or mule. It appears that Jumbo continued to increafe its power and commerce until the year 1770, the period of Runzeid Deve’s death, when one of his foils, the prefent chief, contrary to the intention and exprefs will of his father, feized on the government, put to death one of his brothers, the intended fucceffor, and imprifoned another; who having made his efcape fought the protection of the Sicques.

For defraying the expence incurred by the Sicque troops, the Jumbo chief has made rigorous demands on the native inhabitants of the city, and is now throwing an eye on the foreign merchants; who, dreading his difpofition and neceffities, have taken a general alarm.

In laying before you thefe fcattered pieces of intelligence, I muft not forget to notice, that the courtezans and female dancers of the Punjab and Kafhmire, or rather a mixed breed of both thefe countries, are beautiful women, and are held in great eftimafion through all the northern parrs of India: the merchants eftablifhed at Jumbo, often become fo fondly attached to a dancing girl, that, neglecting their occupation, they have been known to diftipate, at her will, the whole of their property; and 3 have feen fome of them reduced to a fubfiftence on charity ; for thefe girls, in the manner of their profeflion, are profufe and rapacious.

The tenets of Nanock forbid the worfhip of images, and ordain that the places of public prayer {hall be of plain con- flmftion, and devoid of every exhibition or figure. A book, en- titled the Gruntk, which contains the civil and religious iniditutes of Nanock, is the only typical object which the Sicques have ad mitted into their places of worfhip.

The predatory condu£t of Govind Sing rendering him obnoxious to the governor of Sirhend, he was attacked and driven from his place of refidence. Being afterwards difeovered amongft the hills in the northern parts of the Sirhend diftrifts, he was fo vigoroufly preffed by the imperial troops, that abandoning his family and effecls, he was compelled to fave himfelf by fpeedy flight.

A Sicque difciple, named Bunda, who had attended Govind Sing to the Decan, came, after the death of his chief, into the Punjab; where, claiming a merit from his late connedlion, he railed a fmall force, and in va rious defultory enterprizes, eftablifhed the chara6ler of a brave but cruel foldier.

A party of Sicques had at the fame time penetrated the greater Duab, and feized on the town and certain diflri5ls of Saharanpour,* where they flaughtered the inhabitants, or forcibly made them converts to the new faith. Bunda, who had rapidy acquired the poiTeffion of an extenfive territory, was now deferted by his good fortune. He had eroded the river Sutledge with an intention of carrying his conquefts to the weft ward, but being encountered by Shems Khan, an imperial officer who commanded in that quarter, he was repulfed with a great lofs.

The courage and military experience of this officer found an a£Hve employment in curbing the turbulent and rapacious fpirit of the Sicques: but aware of the advantages that would arife from a confederacy with a people whofe * The officer who defeated the Sicques at the battle of Mackavaul. depre-2 75 FORSTER'S TRAVELS, depredations, accompanied with every fpecies of rapine, could not be prevented without continued warfare, Adina Beg made an al liance with the Sicques, founded on a fcheme of combined hoftili- ties againft the Afghans, whofe territories * he invited them to lay wafte, without requiring participation of the booty. Every infringement of the compacl being feverely refented by Adina Beg, the Sicques were rarely feen interrupting the peace of his govern ment. The court of Dehli, having by intrigue and occafional military aids, zealoufly contributed to promote the fucceffes of the Lahore chief, Ahmed Shah brought an army in the year 1756 into India, to recover the pofleflion of the Punjab, and to punilh Ghaze-ud- Dien, the minifter of Alumguir the Second, who had affumed an abfolute authority in the capital. Adina Beg, an adlive fupporter of the minifter’s interefts, which were clofely united with his own, not having a fufficient force to meet Ahmed Shah Duranny in the field, fled into the adjacent mountains, where he remained in con cealment until the departure of the Afghan prince to his northern dominions.

Ahmed Shah, having in conjundlion with the Mahometan chiefs of Hindoflan, routed the combined forces of the Hindoos at the battle of Pannifrett, in the beginning of the year 1761, and driven the Mahrattas from the northern provinces, meditated a full revenge on the Sicques ; who, during a fmall interval of his abfence, had in the latter end of the fame year, feized on the larged: divifion of the Lahore province. Early in the year 1762, he en tered the Punjab, which he over-run with a numerous army, dif- perhng the Sicques wherever they appeared, and difrufing a ge neral terror by the havock which marked his invafion. The Afghan foon became podefied of all the low country, and the Sicques difmayed at his rapid fuccefs, and the cruelties exercifed by his fierce foldiery, abandoned the plains, and fought a fhelter with their families in the Ikirts of the mountains. A large party of Sicques had retired towards the northern diftri&amp;s* of Sirhend, which being more than an hundred miles diftant from Lahore, the Ration of the Afghan army, they were not apprehenfive of any immediate attack.

The Sicques, in their day of fuccefs, having defiled and deftroyed the mofques and other facred places of the Mahometans, compelling alfo many of them to embrace the faith of Nanock, now felt the favage vengeance of their enemies. Amrut Sir was rafed to the ground, and the facred waters choaked up with its ruins. Pyramids were erefted, and covered with the heads of flaughtered Sicques 5 and it is mentioned, that Ahmed Shah caufed the walls of the principal mofques which had been polluted by the Sicques to be wafhed with their blood, that the contamina tion .might be removed, and the ignominy offered to the religion of Mahomet, expiated. Yet thefe examples of ferocious rigour did not quell the native courage of the Sicques, who ftill continue to iffue from their faffneffes, to hover on the rear of the Afghan armies, and to cut off their fcattered parties. Ahmed Shah, in the clofe of the year 1762, returned into Afghaniflan, which being compofed of provinces recently con quered or acquired, and inhabited by a warlike fierce people, de manded a vigilant perfonal attention. A body of his troops, com manded by an officer of diftinguifhed rank, had been Rationed in the Lahore territory, and in the capital, which was ffrongly gar- rifoned. But foon after the march of Ahmed Shah, the Sicques were feen defending from their various holds on the Punjab, which they rapidly laid wafte, and after feveral defultory adlions, in which the Afghans were defeated, they befieged, and what feems extraor dinary.FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 279 dinary, they took the city of Lahore 5 where wildly indulging the enmity that had never ceafed to inflame them againft thefe fevere fcourges of their nation, they committed violent outrages. The mofques that had been rebuilt or reftored to ufe by the Maho metans, were demolifhed with every mark of contempt and in dignation ; and the Afghans, in chains, wafhed the foundations with the blood of hogs. They were alfo compelled to excavate the refervoir at Amrut Sir, which in the preceding year they had filled up. The Sicques, however, keenly adluated by refentment, fet a bound to the impulfe of revenge 5 and though the Afghan maffacre and perfecution muft have been deeply imprinted on their minds, they did not, it is faid, deftroy one prifoner in cold blood. The records of the Sicques give a relation of a battle fought with the Afghans, previoufly to the capture of Lahore: but as its afferted iflue does not correfpond with the feries of fuccefs, which confpicuoufly in India accompanied the Afghan arms under Ahmed Shah, or Hand fupported by any collatoral proof to which I have had accefs, I am neceffarily led to doubt fome parts of the Sicque’s relation. This event is faid to have happened in Odlober 1762, when the colle6ted body of the Sicque nation, amounting to fixty thoufand cavalry, had formed a junction at the ruins of Amrut Sir, for the purpofe of performing fome appointed ceremony, and where they refolved, expecting the attack, to pledge their national exigence on the event of a battle. Ahmed Shah, at that time en campednr / £80 • ^ FORSTER’S TRAVELS. camped at Lah ore, marched with a ftrong force to Am rut Sir,* and immediately engaged the Sicques ; who, roofed by the fury of a defperate revenge, in fight alfo of the ground facred to the founders of their religion, whofe monuments had been deftroyed by the enemy they were then to combat, difplayed, during a bloody contefl, which lafted from the morning until night, an enthufi- aflic and fierce courage, which ultimately forced Ahmed Shah to draw off his army and retire with precipitation to Lahore.- The Sicques, it is alfo faid, purfued the enemy to that city, which they took after a fhort fiege; and that Ahmed Shah, having made his efcape before the furrender, croffed the Indus. Any probability of this event can only be reconciled by a fuppofition, that the army of Ahmed Shah had fuffered fome extraordinary reductions, pre- vioufly to the period in which this occurrence -f is faid to have happened. Without a further difcuffion of this clouded faCt, we will proceed to the common annals of the day, where it is feen that the Duranny returned into the Punjab, in the autumn of 1763, when he retook Lahore, and again drove the Sicques from the low country. The fucceffes of this prince, though decided at the moment, were not followed by either a benefit to himfelf or to the country he conquered ; and could be only traced by daugh ter arid rapine 5 for in the courfe of the following year, during his * This place is about forty miles to the weftward of Lahore. f A total eclipfe of the fun is faid to have happened on the day of a&amp;ion. fhortFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 281 fiiort abfence, the Sicques ravaged the Punjab, expelled the Af ghan garrifons, and purfued their fortune with fo vigorous a ra pidity, that during the year 1764, they had over-run, and feized on, an extent of territory reaching from the borders of the Indus to the diftri6ts of Dehli. Ahmed Shah, in the three following years, continued to maintain a defultory war with the Sicques; but poffeffing no trea sure in India, fearing alfo the effe&amp;s of a remote refidence from his native dominion, he muft have at length flirunk from the dif ficulties of conquering a numerous people, who when driven from the plains, poffefled impenetrable retreats in forefts and moun tains ; and, what was more dreadful to their enemies, an invincible courage. After the year 1767, the period of his laft campaign in India, Ahmed Shah, feems to have wholly relinquifhed the defign of fubduing the Punjab. The Sicques now became the rulers of a large country, in every part of which they eftablifhed an undi vided authority, and raifed in it the folid flru£lure of a religion, in the propagation and defence of which, their perfevering valour merit a common applaufe. Timur Shah, the reigning prince of Afghaniftan, the fon of Ahmed Shah, had made war on the Sicques with various fuccefs. During the interval of his laft campaign in India, he wrefted from them the city, with a large divifion of the province of Moultan ; which the Sicques, contrary to the fpirit of their national cha- Vol. I, N n racier,aSz FORSTER’S TRAVELS. rafter, evacuated after a weak refiftance. This furrender might on the firft view be termed pufillanimous, efpecially when the inaftive difpofition of 1 imur is confidered ; but it feems to have been a natural confequence of their eternal diviiions, and the fears enter-* tained by the body at large, of the encreafe of individual power. The dominions of the Sicques, whofe limits are ever in a Rate of iluftuation, was, in the year 1782, bounded on the north by the chain of mountains that extend in an oblique line acrofs the head of the Punjab j on the eaft by the pofTeffions of the emperor and his officers, which reach to Pannifrett and Kurrwaulj on the fouth- eaft by the Agra difhifts 5 on the fouth by Moultan ; and on the weft: by the Indus, except where the town and independencies of Attock, and fome petty chiefships, are interfperfed. The Sicques have reduced the largeft portion of the territory of Zabitah Khan, leaving him little more than the fort of Ghous Ghur, with a very limited domain in its vicinity. This chief, the degenerate fon of Najeb-ud-Dowlah, has made no vigorous effort in his defence; but thinking to footh them, and divert their en croachments, affumed the name of a Sicque, and oftenfibly, it is faid, became a convert to the faith of Nanock.* It is not feen that he derived any benefit from his apoftacy 5 for at the period of my journey through the Duab, the Sicques were invefting his fort, 1 i 1 ' n &gt; ■: .'

In the beginning of the year 1783, a party of Sicques tra- verfing the Ghous Ghur diflridls, approached the Ganges, where it forms the weftern limit of Rohilcund, with an intention of eroding the river, and invading the country of the vizier. Being at that time in Rohilcund, I witneffed the terror and general alarm which prevailed amongft the inhabitants, who, deferring the open country* had retired into forts and places inacceffible to cavalry. The Sicques, perceiving the difficulty of paffing a river in the face of the vizier’s troops, which were polled on the eaftern bank, receded from their purpofe. This fa£t has been adduced to fliew that the Sicques command an uninterrupted padage to the Ganges.* Thus have I laid before you, according to the mod: fubllantial authorities that I could obtain, the origin of the Sicques 5 their fird: territorial ellablilhment, and the outlines of the progrefs they made, in extending a fpacious dominion, and confolidating the power which they at this day podefs.

N n 2 The284 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. The Afghan war involved them in a feries of ftill more grievous calamity; as they had then laid the foundation of a growing power, and more fenfibly felt the ravages of a formidable foe. They were driven from the fan&lt; 5 tuary of their religion, and perfe- euted with a rage which feemed to keep pace with the encreahng Rrength and inveteracy of their enemy : yet we have feen, that in the loweft ebb of fortune, they retained the fpirit of refource $ that they boldly feized on every hold which offered fupport; and, by an invincible perfeverance, that they ultimately rofe fu- perior in a conteft with the moil potent prince of his age. Grand auxiliary caufes operated alfo in the formation and final eftablifhment of the Sicques* dominion. It hath already been noticed, that the firfl efforts of this people commenced at a time when the Moghul empire loft its energy and vigour; when inteftine commotions, the intrigues of a luxurious court, and the defedlion of diftant governors, had promoted the increafe of in dividual interefts, and a common relaxation of allegiance. The decifive fuperiority obtained over the Sicques, by Meer Munnoo, would, we muft believe, with a judicious application of its ufes, have removed to a farther diftance the rank which this ftate now maintains in Hindoftan. To develope the aftions of men, with whofe hiftory we are trivially acquainted, would be fa bricating too refined a fyftem of fpeculation ; nor would I now inveftigate fo obfcure a fubjedl, were it not to generally obferve, that the prefervation of the Sicques from the effects of Meer Munnoo’sFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 2 £5 * Munnoo’s fuccefs, appears to have been largely promoted by the interference of his minifter Khorah Mul, who being himfelf a Sicque, naturally became a trufty advocate of the fe6t and who, it is faid, completed his afcendancy over the Mahometan, by a confiderable donation. But the diflradled Rate of Ahmed Shah’s Afghan and Perfian dominion, which urgently called on a per- fonal adminiftration, afforded the Sicques the mod favourable oc- cafions of accomplifliing the conqueft of the Punjab 5 and it is probable, that, had the Afghan prince been enabled to prolong his campaigns in Hindoftan, the Sicques would not, during his life, have attained any extenfive degree of national confequence. I find an embarraffment in applying a diftindt term to the form of the Sicque government, which, on the firft view, bears an appearance of ariftocracy; but a clofer examination difcovers a large vein of popular power branching through many of its parts. No honorary or titular diftindlion is conferred on any member * of the Rate, and the chiefs are treated with a deference that would feem to arife only from the military charges they may at the inRant be inveRed with, and from a felf-preferving regard to the fubordi- nation neceffarily required in conducing an armed body. Though orders are iffued in a Sicque army, and a fpecies of obedience ob- ferved, punifhments are rarely inflidled 5 and the chiefs, who * The poflerity of the ten priefts are occafionally denominated purgadabs, that is,, defendants of a faint, or pi ophet. often236 v .

An equality of rank is maintained in their civil fociety, which no clafs of men, however wealthy or powerful, is fuffered to break down. At the periods when general councils of the nation were convened, which confifted of the army at large, every member had the privilege of delivering his opinion; and the majority, it is faid, decided on the fubjedt in debate. The Khallah Sicques, even of the loweR order, are turbulent people, and poffefs a haughtinefs of deport ment which, in the common occurrences of life, peculiarly marks their charadter. Examples of this difpofition I have myfelf wit- nefled, and one of them I think merits a diflindl notice. In tra velling through the Siringnaghur country, our party was joined by a Sicque horfeman, and being defirous of procuring his acquain tance, I ftudioufly offered him the various attentions which men obferve to thofe they court. But the Sicque received my advances; with a fixed referve and difdain, giving me, however, no individual caufe of offence; for his deportment to the other paffengers was not lefs contemptuous. His anfwer, when I afked him the name •of chief, was wholly conformable to the obfervations I had made of his nation. He told me (in a tone of voice, and with an expreffion of countenance, which feemed to revolt at the idea of fervitude) that he difdained an earthly fuperiour, and acknow ledged no other mailer than his prophet!

The grand convention, called in their language Goorimotta y was that in which the army met to tranfadl the more important affairs of the nation 5 as the declara tion of war or peace, forming alliances, and detaching parties on the fervice of the year. The amount of the contributions levied on the public account was reported to this affembly, and divided among the chiefs, proportionably to the number of their troops. They were at the fame time obliged to diffribute a certain (hare of this property to their fbldiers, who, on any caufe of diffatisfac- tion, made no hefitation in quitting their fervice, and following a &gt; more popular leader. Subordinate officers were eftablifhed for re- giftering the political correfpondence of the Rate, and for providing warlike Rores •&gt; and the adminiRration of ecclefiaRical affairs was entruRed to a certain fociety of religeufe, compofed chiefly of the defendants of their original prieRs, but they did not poffefs any influence in the temporal regulation of the Rate. Thefe were the principal ordinances enabled by the firff chiefs, when the people were united, and a common objebl governed their public con- dubf. The dominions of the Sicques, now widely extended, have been fmce divided into numerous Rates, which purfue an inde pendent intereff, without a regard to general policy. The grand aflembly is now rarely fummoned, nor have the Sicques, flnce the Afghan war, been embarked in any united caufe.

A Sicque horfeman is armed with a matchlock and fabre of excellent metal, and his horfe is flrong and well formed. In this matter I fpeak from a perfonal know- ledge, having in the courfe of my journey Ren two of their par ties, each of which amounted to about two hundred horfemen. Flicy were clothed in white veils,* and their arms were pre- fcived in good order: the accoutrements, coniiiling of priming hoi ns and ammunition pouches, were chiefly covered with Eu ropean fcarlet cloth, and ornamented with gold lace. The pre- diledtion of the Sicques for the match-lock mufquet, and the conilant ufd they make of it, caufes a difference in their man ner of attack from that of any other Indian cavalry; a party, tioiu fotty to fifty, advance in a quick pace to the diflance of a catabine fliot from the enemy, and then, that the fire may be given with the greater certainty, the horfes are drawn up, and their pieces difcharged; when, fpeedily retiring about a bundled paces, they load and repeat the fame mode of annoy ing the enemy.

But it is not by this mode of combat that the Sicques have become a formidable people. Their fucceffes and conquefts have largely originated from an a&amp;ivity unparalleled by other Indian nations, from their endurance of exceffive fatigue, and a keen refentment of injuries. The perfonal endowments of the Sicques are derived from a temperance of diet, and a forbearance from many of thofe fenfual pleafures which have enervated the Indian Maho metans. A body of their cavalry has been known to make marches of forty or fifty miles, and to continue the exertion for many fucceflive days* The forces of this nation muft be numerous, though I am not poffeffed of a»y fubilantial document for afcertaining the amount. A Sicque will confidently fay, that his country can furnilh three hundred thoufand cavalry, and, to authenticate the aflertion, affirms that every perfon, holding even a fmall pro perty, is provided with a horfe, match-lock, and fide-arms. But in qualification of this account, if we admit that the Sicques when united can bring two hundred thoufand horfe into the field, their force in cavalry is greater than that of any other Rate in Hindoftan. A paffage which I extradted from a memoir,* written at Dehli in 1777, exhibits a lively pidlure of this people in tjieir military capacity. “ The Sicques,” it reprefents, “ are * I believe it was written by Colonel Folier.

The chiefs are numerous, fome of whom have the command of ten or twelve thoufand ca- “ valry ; but this power is confined to a fmall number, the in- cc ferior officers maintaining from one to two thoufand, and many “ not more than twenty or thirty horfes; a certain quota of which fC is furnifhed by the chief, the greater part being the individual fic property of the horfemen.” From the fpirit of independence fo invariably infufed amongtt them, their mutual jealoufy, and a rapacious roving temper, the Sicques at this day are feldom feen co-operating in national concert, but adluated by the influence of an individual ambition, or private diftrutt, they purfue fuch plans only as coincide with thefe mo tives. An example of their forces being engaged in oppofite in- terefts, has been noticed in the cafe of Mhah Sing, who fuccourcd the Rajah of Jumbo, againtt the Sicque party, which had invaded his country. Before the chiefs of the Mountaineers country, at the head of the Punjab, were reduced to a tributary ttate, fevere depredations were committed on them by the Sicques, who plun dered and deftroyed their habitations, carried off the cattle, and, if Q o 2 ttiongFORSTER’S TRAVELS. ftrong and well formed, the male children, who were made con verts to the faith of Nanock, But fince the payment of a fixed tribute has been flipulated, which does not amount to more than five per cent, on the revenue, the Mountaineers are little molefted, except when the Sicques have been called in to adjuft their domeftic quarrels. The extenfive and fertile territory of the Sicques, and their attachment and application in the midft of warfare to the occupa tions of agriculture, muft evidently produce a large revenue. The diftridls dependant on Lahore in the reign of Aurungzebe, pro duced, according to Mr. Bernier, a revenue of two hundred and forty-fix lacks and ninety-five thoufand rupees $ * and we are naturally led to fuppofe, from the induftrious fkill of the Sicques in the various branches of cultivation, that no great decreafe of that amount can have taken place fince the Punjab has fallen into their poffeffion.

In the event of no moleflation being offered to people of this defcription, the efcape is ever fpoken of with a degree of joyful furprize, and a thankfgiving is offered to Provi dence for the Angular efcape. This conduCf, inimical to the pro- grefs of civilization, and an impediment to the influx of wealth, proceeds from an extreme jealoufy of Grangers, added to a rapa city of temper, which make them averfe to the encouragement of any fcheme in whofe fuccefs they do not immediately participate. The Sicques are not rigorous in their flipulations with the Mahometan profelytes, who, if they abftain from beef’s flefb, (which is held in equal abhorrence by the Sicques as by the Hin doos), and perform the more oftenfible duties, as burning their dead, and preferving the hair of the head, an indulgent latitude is granted in all the other articles of the creed of Nanock.

The Mahometans are alfo prohibited from announcing their ftated times of prayer, which, conformably to their ufage, is proclaimed in a loud tone of voice. A Sicque who in the chace fhall have (lain a wild hog, is frequently known to compel the firil Mahometan he meets to carry to his home the body of the animal; and, on being initiated into the rites of their religion, the Sicques will fometimes require a Maho metan convert to bind on his arm the tufk of a boar, that by this aft of national impurity, he may the more avowedly teftify a re nunciation and contempt of the tenets of his former faith. Thefe faffs will fufficiently mark the haughty and infulting demeanor, which, with few deviations, forms a prominent feature in the charaffer of the military Sicques; but we may alfo afcribe a certain portion of their fevere and contumelious treatment of the Maho metans, to a remembrance of recent injuries. The difcordant intereffs which agitate the Sicque nation, and the conftitutional genius of the people, muff incapacitate them, during the exigence of thefe caufes, from becoming a formidable offenfive power ; nor are they invefted with that fpecies of execu tive flrength which is neceflary to advance and effablifii a diflant conqued.

A aflomire^ April, 1783- O N the 17th of April, I left Jumbo; and, accompanied by a Kafhmirian fervant, who carried my baggage, I reached the fmall village of Dunfhaulah, after a painful journey on foot, of ten coffes. A review of my feet, too plainly fhewed that they had not been proof againft the fteep and rocky roads I had clambered over; indeed they had fuffered fo feverely by bruifes and excoriations, that I could fcarcely walk. Having bound up my feet with bandages foaked in oil, I reached, on the 18th, though with difficulty, the village of Na- grolah — five coffies. During thefe two laft days, I paid, at the different cuftom-houfes, certain fmall fees of office, which were not authorized charges; but being known to be a ffranger, and apparently in a condition to fatisfy the demand, I was feldom permitted to pafs a cuftom-houfe unmoleffed. Though the la cerations in my feet gave me much pain, efpecially at the firff fetting off, I purfued my journey in good fpirits, being pro- Vo l, I.

The firft night, we were received into a retail (hop, at Dun- fhaulah, where I flept on my large blanket, and fupped on fome fpiced meat and bifcuits, which my Jumbo hofl had pro vided : and at Nagrolah we were accommodated by a Maho metan family, who fupplied me with a {landing bed. On the 19th, at Luttere—eight coffes. The latter part of the journey led me up a high and fteep hill, and the fun, then at its meridian height, had nearly overpowered me; when, on a fudden, I found myfelf on a fummit, where fome charitable Hindoo had erefted a fmall, but a cool, building,* plentifully fupplied with pots of water. Under this hofpitable {hade, I was permitted^ though a Mahometan, to reft during the day, and to fleep at night. Many Hindoos came in for the benefit of the water and {hade, and obferving that I was lame, they treated me with an attentive kindnefs, and difpenfed with my riling when any of their principal people entered.

On exclaiming againft this a6t of ejedlion, he was told, that though the houfe was eredted for the puipoie of common accommodation, with no view of excluding any nation or fedl; yet in fome cafes, as in the prefent, an obfer- vance of precedency and deference was neceffary. This anecdote will ferve to generally delineate the native difference betwixt the temper of a Hindoo and a Mahometan. What do you think would have been the reception of a Hindoo, particularly of a reli gious order, had he come into a karavanferah, in a Mahometan country, and throw his brafs pot, his rice, or peafe, into an apart ment which Mahometans had previoufly occupied ? Could the Hindoo have adled with fuch indifcretion — his punifhment would have been more difgraceful and fevere than death. From long obfervation, I can with confidence fay, that the Hindoos are a more temperate people, and much more ufeful in the various relations of life, than any clafs of Mahometans that have come within my knowledge. At the vicinity of Nagrolah commence the *diftrfets of the Chinnanee chief, a dependant on Jumbo, who poffeffes a revenue of about a lack of rupees.

On the 20th, at Chinnanee; a neat and populous town, fituate on the brow of a hill; at the foot of which, on the eaftern fide, runs a rapid ftream paffing to the left. This channel is paffed by means of two ftout fir beams, one of which reaches from the fhore to an infulated rock in the centre of the current, on which it is faftened by wooden ftakes ; and the other extends from the rock to the oppofite bank. The velocity with which the water was preci pitated, its roaring noife, and the narrow fhaking bridge, gave full occafionfor the ufe of my eye, and the fteadinefs of my head. At Chinnance, I was taxed in the fum of a rupee for permiflion to crofs the river Chinnaun, which forms the vveftern limit of this chiefship. ' On the 21ft, at Dumomunjee—feven cofles. A few fcattered houfes, in one of which I was accommodated by a Kafhrhirian fa mily, who had taken a farm in that quarter. The approach to this village leads through a valley, covered with luxuriant herbage, and interfperfed with fome of the moft beautiful fhrubs I ever faw.

This day croffed the Chinnaun, ufually deno minated at this place, from the mode of eroding it, the Chickah. The manner of conveying paffengers and all forts of property over this dream is curious, and deferves explanation. The Ohinnaun is about feventy or eighty yards broad, and, like the rivers of this part of India, from the declivity of the country, very rapid. On the oppofite banks are fixed ftrong wooden pods, of about four feet in height, on the upper ends of which a flout rope is tightly extended, and is joined below to a fmaller one, by hoops of twilled ofiers. — In the centre of the fmall rope, to which only the hoops are firmly attached, hangs a vehicle of net-work, for the convey ance of merchandife and paffengers, which is fupported from the main rope by a wooden Aider, in the form and fize of a bullock’s yoke, to whofe ends the vehicle is fadened ; and a fufficient length of both ends of the final! rope permits it to be landed on either fide of the river. It appears that the feat, or as it is termed in this county, the Chickah, is by mutual agreement kept on the Kiflitewer fide, during the night. In defiance of my pafsport, the officer at the Chinnanee limit, taxed me in an additional fee; and I was alfo compelled to buy my way through an inferior tribe of make a deviation from the more dire&amp; track.

Anxious to arrive at the end of the ftage, being both hungry and tired, I endeavoured to pacify their clamours; but other demands were yet againfl; me : for this extraordinary race of ferrymen, having conveyed my fervant and our little baggage over half of the river, kept them Twinging there, and declared that they fliould be detained until a fecond payment was made. Though this impediment materially affedted me, I could not refill laughing at the aukward pofition of the unfortu nate domedic, who bawled out to me, from his flack rope, that they were a pack of hardened rogues, and that he would rather be kept hanging all night, than confent to give them a farthing more. But the neceffities of my fituation cooled my refentment, and obliged me to purchafe his releafe. At Naufman, I waited on a Mahometan of fome diftinclion, who was travelling into Kafhmire, and I requefted permiffion to travel in his fuite, that I might with more fuccefs, I informed him, repel the dreaded attack of the cuflom-houfe officers ; who, fince my departure from Jumbo, had extorted a larger fum than was proportioned to the date of my finances. At the diflance of every ten or twelve miles from Jumbo to the Chinnaun river, one of thefe petty tyrants takes his ftand; and on the payment of a fli- pulated fum to the government, colledls the public duties, as well as enforces every fpecies of private exa6lion ; and fuch taxes have be come the more grievous to the merchant, by their being equally levied on the tranfportation of goods through a diflrift, as at the aftualFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 3^3 a£tual place of fale. From Kafhmire to Lucknow are not lefs than thirty Rations at which a duty of three and four per cent, is levied on every quality of merchandize : this charge, with the expences neceffarily incurred in the courfe of a tedious and diflant land-con veyance, largely enhances the price of {hauls in the lower part of India. Zulphucar Khan, the perfon whom I had addrefTed, rea dily offered me affiflance, and admitted me, without referve, into his party. This Khan had lately ferved the chief of Jumbo, and had been employed in the management of a diftrift which that chief holds in Kafhmire. But on the charge of fome default the Mahometan was recalled ; and, after undergoing a rigorous con finement, as well as fevere tortures, the effect of which had de- flroyed his right hand, he was permitted to retire into Kafhmire, where his family now refides. On the 23d, we proceeded, fix coffes, and halted on the fummit of a fteep and uninhabited mountain: the air, in itfelf bleak, was made painfully cold by the fall of a heavy rain, which did not ceafe during the night. It were almoft fuperfluous to fay, that the perfon who makes this journey fhould poffefs a ftrong. and vigorous conftitution, and he fhould alfo endeavour to cordially wean himfelf from the defire of every luxury.

Ha v 1 n g now brought you to a near view of this land of pleafure, I am urged, that the defcription may be more explanatory, to call back your attention to the country and people I have lately vifited. —From Fall Dong to the Ganges, the face of the country forms a clofe chain of woody mountains, and did not one or two miferable hamlets feebly interpofe, you would pronounce that divifion of Si- ringnaghur fitted only for the habitation of the beafis of the forefh Elephants abound there, in numerous herds j but are not to be feen, it is faid, on the weft fide of the Jumna.

From Bellafpour, fertile vallies, though not wide, extend to Biffouly, where the country is again covered with high hills, which, with little varia tion, ftretch to the limits of Kafhmire. The boundaries of Kifli- tewer, except to the place of my entrance and departure, are not fpecified ; nor is the amount of the revenues r an omiffion caufed by my inability to procure any fubftantial authority. The road from Lall Dong to Kafhmire, as accurately as could be afcertamed, from an obfervation of the fun s courfe, tended generally to the north-weft, weft-north-weft, and w r eft by north ; except where the deviation is otherwife noted. The lides of the inhabited mountains produce wheat, barley, and a variety of the fmall grains peculiar to India. The cultivated fpaces project from the body of the hill, in feparate flats, in the form of a range of femicircular flairs: with a broad bafe and a narrow fummit. The ground, which is ftrong and productive, has been propelled, it fhould feem, into thefe pro- je&amp;ions by the aftion of the rains, which fall among thefe moun tains with great violence, from June till Oftober; and is now pre- ferved in this divided and level ftate by buttreffes of loofe ftones, which bind in the edge of every flat.

It was once my opinion, that the Hindoos had fecluded them from the public view that they might not be expofed to the intemperance of the Mahometan conquerors; but after per ceiving the ufage adopted amongft the fequeftered Mountaineers, and alfo amongff the various independent Mahratta Rates, I am in duced to think that the exclufion of women from fociety, prevailed in India before the period of the Afghan or Tartar invafions.

It is neceffary to inform you, that Sree Mun Narrain, the Su preme Deity of the Hindoos^ together with his indivifible affoci- ates, Mhah Letchimy, and the Snake, for the purpofe of corre6Hng certain evils which had at that time deranged our terreftrial world, found it expedient to perfonify human creatures : Narrain affumed the form of Ram, a renowned foldier* Letchimy became his wife, under the name of Seetah Devee ; and the Snake was transformed into the body of Letchimun, the brother and companion of Ram. It is feen that thefe perfonages mixed freely in the focieties of the world, nor does any part of the hiftory notice the retirement of Seetah : fhe is, indeed, reprefen ted coming forth on every occafion which could, with propriety, permit the interference of her fex. A fervice of importance calling upon Ram’s individual exertion, he configned Seetah to the charge of Letchimun : the lady and her guardian remained fome time in fecurity and quiet; when a famed magician, inftigated no doubt, by the devil, who is ever on the watch to draw aftray mortals, particularly the female divifion of them, came that way, faw Seetah, and became violently enamoured. This fubtle man, having difcovered, it is fuppofed by his fpells and incantations, that the eyes of women are the fooneft enfnared, let fly, full in the fight of Seetah, a bird of brilliant and beautiful plumage.

Letchimun, now convinced of the inefficacy of argument, and the neceffity of ac~ quiefcence, went in qued of the bird; but previoufly to his depar ture he drew a magic circle around the fpot where Seetah dood, and told her, that within that fpace no calamity could enter. Let chimun had no fooner gone, than the plotting necromancer, adum- ing the appearance of an old man, approached, with a feeble and decrepkLdep, the place where Seetah dood, and, through an ap parent excefs of weaknefs,-extended himfelf on the ground.

The humane, but ill-FORSTER’S TRAVELS. ill-fated, Seetah, felt the force of the old man’s prayer, and, with a bofom overflowing with benevolence, (he flepped, unmindful of her fafety, beyond the prefcribed bounds, and fell that inftant into the power of her betrayer. Here the Rory wanders into a wilder field of fable ; where I fhouid reap little credit, or you improve ment. I will, therefore, content myfelf with mentioning, that after Ram had recovered Seetah, he ordered, for the removal of certain fufpicions which had crept into his own bread, and for ef fectually fhutting the mouth of flander, which began to open, that file fhouid be judged by the ordeal trial. Seetah, eager to banifh every doubt from the mind of her lord, and to exhibit to the world a public tefl of her purity, joyfully heard the mandate; and, without fhew of dread, walked over the burning iron. But the feet of Seetah, fays the Rory, u being fhod with innocence, the “ fcorching heat was to her a bed of Rowers.” Pardon me for the intrufion of this EaRern tale, which might juflly be deemed a trifling one, did it not indicate that the women of rank, among the more ancient Hindoos, were not excluded from the public eye, and that this people were acquainted with the trial by fire at an early period of time.
