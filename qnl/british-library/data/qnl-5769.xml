The ambassador however, thought he identified Jezirat Abu Ali as the island referred to, in which he apparently was wrong, as this island is iminhabited. r' —CONFIDENTIAL No. 1727 dated Bushire, the 4th (received 12th) August 1912. From —Lieutf.nant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C I E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to refer to the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 26th July, calling for evidence demonstrating the control over tribes exercised by Shaikh Mubarak within the limits referred to in Mr. J. G, Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. 2. A reference to the Political Agent at Kuwait on the subject has been necessary, and on receipt of his reply Government will be addressed by telegraph. Meanwhile I have the honour to state that a careful study of records since 1897 bearing on the question of the limits of the Shaikh’s effective influence, inclines me to the view, as I shall proceed to explain, that, if it is still possible to arrange for the adoption of a slight modification of Mr. Lorimer’s line, it would be expe dient to do so. I would explain in this connection that both when telegraphing to the Government of India on 26th March 1911 and on 6th July 19*2 (No. 690), I was absent from my headquarters and archives and had to reply without reference to them. 3- I may commence by inviting reference to the line which Captain Shakespear indicated, in a report on his tour in the Kuwait hinterland, as being in his opinion the boundary of the principality. It is somewhat less extensive, but to the southwards, a good deal more definite, than that indicated by Mr. Lorimer, upon such scanty information upon the subject as was available to him. It, however, includes Anta’a (Nta’), a group of villages of considerable importance, which Captain Knox’s reports of 1908 give good grounds for regarding as within the domains of Shaikh Mubarak; and the statement of the Porte that it is part of the vilayat of Basrah is presumably on all fours with their claim that Kuwait is also in that province. Its headman in 1908, at any rate, was a nominee of the Shaikh of Kuwait. No. 153 of 23rd March JQio, forwarded to Gov ernment of India under Resident’s letter No. 977, dated 14th April 1910. Vide map of the Kuwait hinterland, Survey of India, June 1910. 8 miles «=*i inch. Rifaat Pasha’s Memorandum of May 6th, 1908, received under Foreign Department endorsement No. 2191-E.B., dated 19th June 1908. 4. It will be seen that Captain Shakespear also includes within the limits of Kuwait district, Jazirat ’al Amayir, an island inside Musallamiyah Bay. This No. 138, dated 25th March 1908, forwarded to is identical with the Bay of Balbul, which Po7:3.'a' , 5t'Ap% un , d 9 'i. R .nd d N^ £: e d£d was described by. Mr- J- C. Gaskin, in his 23rd May 1908, forwarded to Government of India report to the Resident on 6th September under Resident’s No. ,8.4, dated8th June .908. i897j as the Southern Boundary of Kuwait. This report, it would appear, was not forwarded to Government, though an account of the results of Mr, Gaskin’s visit, in connection with which the report was made, will be found in Residency letter No, 90 of 20th September 1897 1 ° th e Government of India. This testimony, given at a date considerably anterior to our assurances, is of considerable value. It is true that the Political Resident expressed doubts as to the validity of the Shaikh’s claim to the island when forwarding it to the Govern* Resident to Foreign, No. 95, dated 26th April ment of India in 1902, but he gave no I902, reasons for doing so, and the fact that the attempt of the Turks made about that time to place troops on the island failed, would seem to give us ground to include the island within the principality. There are no Turkish troops on the island at the present time. In making these observations, however, I do not overlook the fact that the view has been expressed by His Majesty’s Foreign Office and concurred in by theForeign Office to India Office, dated 16th March Ip'i, received under Foreign Department endorse ment No. 1159-E.A . dated 21st Juneipii (enclo sure 10). India Office that the Shaikh’s claims cannot be sustained so far south as Musal- lamiyah Bay. I do not know precisely on what evidence or absence of evidence that decision is based, but I realise that it may not be possible at this stage to consider the inclusion of that feature. 5. The next point after Anta’a mentioned by Captain Shakespear is A 1 Safah. In a country where water is a precious commodity, to be found only at certain spots, often many miles distant from each other, the inclusion of such wells within the boundaries of a principality is of the greatest importance, and as these wells appear, from Captain Shakespear’s report, to be used exclusively by the tribes under Shaikh Mubarak’s control and to have at no time been touched by Turkish influence, there seems every ground to include Safah within the prin cipality. 6. We next come to Hafar. The strategic importance to the Shaikh of Kuwait of this point will be apparent from a glance at the map. It is a half-way house to Buraidah, Riyadh and Hail, and has a constant supply of water. It is a well known outpost, and its possession by Shaikh Mubarak a id the tribes under his control never seems to have been serious^ questioned. During the troubles that took place in 1901, he used the place as a rallying point for his forces and claimed it as in his territory, and was greatly incensed with Bin Rashid, who had Resident to Foreign, No. 14, dated 26th January camped there for a time and consumed the 1901. pastures of Shaikh Mubarak’s tribes. The latter laid a formal complaint before the Resident of the action of Bin Rashid i i Telegram, Resident to Foreign, dated 2nd Nov* letter dated 22 nd October 1931, an ember 1901 : - extract from which is quoted in the margin. 'Bin Rashid is at Hafar, which is distant3 The statement regarding Hafar was days’ Journey from Kuwait; our own cattle and , , • ,,1 • •__.* those f ou tribesmen are prevented by him f om repeated incidentally m 3. communication grazing; we have cons-quentiv suffered great Iosj. from the Shaikh to the Resident dated ..... We, as directed by you, are quite in our own , . , country and are uc’er the shadow of y -ur protec- I y tn INOVemDer IQOI. tion. It is ther fore m cessary that Bin Ra hid should be made to quit these places which are in out boundaries. 7. From Hafar the boundary line assigned to the Kuwait district alike by Mr. Lorimer and Captain Shakespear is the Batin, a broad low depression in the See Mr. Lorimer’3 Gazetteer, Volume 11, page desert, in which water can generally be a81 - found at no great depth, and which contains excellent grazing. Beyond it stretches desert, almost uninhabited and quite unfertile. The Batin is a well known and well marked boundary and a tract o£ great value to Bedouins. There seems no reason to think that it has been inhabited, except spasmodically, by tribes other than those under the influence of the Shaikh of Kuwait, 8. It may be parenthetically remarked here that whereas Mr. Lorimer had to rely upon the word of the Shaikh for his description of the boundary to the westward, it has now been personally examined by Major Knox and Captain Shakespear, with the results mentioned above, which generally speaking tend to confirm the Shaikh’s claims. 9. The position of the northern boundary alone has been subjected in the past to close examination. Captain Shakespear makes the well-marked Ar Ratq Ridge the north-western corner of the principality ; the point seems a suitable one for the purpose and will, I trust, be adopted. Thence it has been held to run through Jabal Sanam, another prominent point, to the sea immediately south of Umm Kasr. 10. The Shaikh’s claims to Safwan are, I think a good deal stronger than has generally been thought, and might have been supported with good reason, but it seems probable that as regaids this point we are committed vts d vis the Porte to recognise it as beyond the limits of Kuwait; the Shaikh's influence^ however, is without doubt unquestioned up to the walls of the fort at Safwan and this fact should receive recognition when the boundary is fixed. Mr. J. C. Gaskin in his repoit of bth September 1897 gives Safwan as the northern boundary of the principality and it has always been a camping ground of his tribes. HisTf* 3 Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, reported in 1902* that in his opinion the Turkish Government never thought of exercising authority over either Safwan or ruary 1902! and he further said to the Senior Naval Officer who interrogated tion to him. 11. When discussing with me, a month ago, various newspaper reports suggesting that the Baghdad Railway was likely to find its terminus at Umm Kasr, under the aegis of Turkey, Shaikh Mubarak made it evident that he felt strongly on the subject of that point and emphatically claimed it as his own possession. Probably in reality his claim has as much validity as those of the Turks who, previous to 1901, had never shown any interest in the place. But His Majesty’s Government have decided 10 years ago that they would not support his claim to this outpost and I presume that they will not alter that decision now in any case; fortunately the place loses much of its strategical value if Warba and Bubyan are retained by the Shaikh. In regard to these islands we have, 1 think, every reason to insist on the Shaikh’s rights, both on their instrinsic merits and as a matter of political expediency. Major Knox’s reports on the rights of the Shaikh and his tribesmen in regard to them were submitted to Government in 1908—-wafe enclosure to Gov ernment of India Despatch No. 168 Secret—External, dated 10th September 1908. 12. As regards other islands, I presume His Majesty’s Government will be able to provide for the recognition of the Shaikh’s ownership, or at all events his predominance, in those mentioned by Mr. Lorimer. 13. There remain one or two other points not directly referred to in the Secretary of State’s telegram under reply, to which I would invite reference. Firstly, i presume that the phrase “ town, harbour and immediate surroundings” used in India Office telegram dated 1st July, includes the whole of Kuwait Bay from Sabiyah to Ras-al-Ardh, together with Jahrah, the possession of which is a Military Repo-t on Kuwait, 1903, by Captain h. marginally noted Military Report, which h. Lowding, ..b , India, pages 22-23. describes very well the attitude of the Shaikh to the possession of Jahrah and the importance of its retention in connec tion with our Kadhamah concession. 14. The conclusion to which the considerations set forth in the foregoing paragraphs bring me, subject to confirmation or modification, on receiving the report wffiich 1 await from Captain Shakespear, is that if it is still possible as between ourselves and the Turks, to work in a slightly different line to that des cribed by Mr. Lorimer, it will be both in the interest of the Shaikh and at the same time more palatable to the Turks, if we can arrange for recognition of the line (subject to the slight modifications mentioned below') indicated by Captain Shakespear ; which, while conceding a broad strip of territory to Turkey, effec tively safeguards the Shaikh’s rights and influence over his tribes at strategic points and at the same time has the substantial advantage of affording a well defined frontier, a consideration which the Shaikh will, I have no doubt, appreciate. 15. The modification which I recommend is that the boundary on the coast should be arbitrarily held to be at Jabal Manifah and from thence to proceed south-west to include Anta’a and thence along Captain Shakespear’s boundary via A 1 Safah, Hafar and A 1 Batin as indicated on the accompanying copy of the most recent map. In order to save time I have sent a copy of this communication to His Majesty’s India Office. * Telegram from Consul, Basrah, to Ambassa dor, No. 21,dated 25th February 1902.

The boundary that Shakespear would have advocated as the result of his past enquiries and as representing the claims of the Shaikh, would have been as follows:— Starting from junction of Khor Sabiya and Khor Zobair boundary wotild pass along waterway of latter so as to include Soof Island opposite Umm Kasr in latter Khor. The line would then pass north of Umm Kasr wells and north of Safwan wells and Jabal Sanam to the Ratk ridge ; thence south-west along the Batin as far as and including Hafar wells. From Hafar it turns south-east towards Safah and includes the wells ; passing thence south-south-east, for about 25 miles, it includes A 1 Gara’a wells ; and from thence proceeds due east passing south of VVabrah and Anta’s Wells and so on until it cuts coast at southern shore of Mussalamiyah Bay which with its islands is claimed by Shaikh. As regards Umm Kasr, Safwan and Mussalamiyah, Shakepear remarks that whereas Shaikh has always specifically claimed these points when mention of them has arisen, we have never informed him that we questioned his claims and he will consequently be greately disappointed when he learns that they have been arbitrarily excluded from his territory. Basis of boundary arrived at by Shakespear is the actual control of wells by tribesmen owning allegiance to Shaikh Mubarakh and this of course is the main test of territorial possession in desert countries inhabited by nomads; document ary evidence in such cases is never procurable. Following evidence or considerations are advanced in support of particular points. As regards Umm Kasr, until present occupation of Turks, wells w'ere habi tually frequented by Kuwait Arabs and all disputes arising there were referred to2 Kuwait and not to Zobair, although former is three times as distant. Same remarks apply to Safwan. The line connecting Safwan with Ratk marks the northern boundary of the grazing grounds used by Kuwait Arabs. Batin is universally recognised as dividing line between adherents of Shaikh Mubarakh and those of Ibn Rashid. If latter’s tribesmen cross it they are regard ed as raiders. As regards Hafar and its position in regard to Ibn Rashid—see paragraph 6 of my letter 1727 abovementioned. The wells of As Safah and A 1 Gara’a occupy similar position vis d vis Bin-Saud. Wabrah wells are within the recognised sphere of the Umtair tribe who have always been subordinate to Shaikh Mubarakh. Properly speaking their sphere also includes the Summan district to the southward. As regards Anta’a, see Residency telegram 437, dated 6th June 1908, to India and enclosure to letter 1814 of 8th June I9°8* The line Hafar, Safah, A 1 Gara’a, Wabrah and Anta’a forms the limit within which the Shaikh is responsible for safety of caravans. As regards Mussalamiyah. The bay is the headquarters and main pro visioning base of the Kuwait pearling fleet. Any disputes arising there are referred to Kuwait and the locality is not used by other pearling boats. The islets of Qaru, Umm al Maradim and Kubar are all uninhabited and waterless but are frequented by Kuwait boats for purposes of catching fish and turtle and gathering fuel, and are generally recognised as appertaining to Kuwait. Failakah is inhabited and governed by Shaikh Mubarakh’s brother. Shaikh leaves “ zikat ” or tibes on the following tribes roaming over tract in question, viz :— Awazim, Umtair, Ajman and Bani Khalid with the exception of a few unim portant and distant sections. Telegram (P.) No. 44, dated the 16th August 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The India Office, London. Please refer to my telegram No. 843 and insert the following as conclud ing paragraph:— Begins : The above evidence holds equally good, so far as it applies, to the line adopted by His Majesty’s Government. Both the ;line advocated in my letter No. 1727, dated 4th August, to the Government of India, and that now proposed by the Political Agent at Kuwait, comprise an area smaller than that enclosed by the line adopted by His Majesty’s Government. For this reason it is hoped that it may perpaps still prove practicable to substitute, in the interests of the Shaikh, during the course of negotiation, a the southern boundary advo cated by Captain Shakespear, or, failing that, the line advocated by me in my above letter.

A. T. WILSON. Captain, Abblbtant Rebident3 ^ CONFIDENTIAL / No. C. Q.-52, dated Bushire, the 21st July (received 3rd August) 1914. From— Major S. G. Knox, C I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India Foreign and Political Department, Simla. In amplification of my telegram No. 812, dated 21st July 1914 to your address I have the honour to forward herewith the promised draft agreement and notification which I propose when duly authorised by Government to do so, to endeavour to obtain from Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani. 1 he draft has been prepared from the material at my disposal in Sir Percy Cox’s despatch to the Government of India dated 22nd June 1913 on this subject and Government of India telegram dated 1 ith September 1913 to the Marquess of Crewe together with the considerable light, thrown on the attitude and intentions of the A 1 Thani family by Sir Percy Cox’s earlier despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No. 755, dated 2nd March 19&lt;3. 2. It appears to me to be a matter for considerarion on the spot whether the Treaty should be made with the natural head of the family only, Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani or whether the other sons of old Shaikh Jasim should sign also. It would no doubt be preferable to deal with one man, if only to pre vent family squabbles in regard to the distribution of the subsidy l propose should be granted, but the local situation may render this unsatisfactory. Some latitude should also, I venture to submit, be given to me in regard to the amount of the subsidy and possibly with regard to the question of the settlement of a compassionate allowance to Salih al Mana, the Qatar owner of the dhow, men tioned in Foreign Department telegram No. S-497 dated 26th August to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in case that question is raised. 3. It will be noted that the draft agreement falls naturally into three por tions, of which the &lt;st and second must be secured, if we are to have anything tangible from the Shaikh of Qatar in the way of a Treaty. The third portion contains several clauses that might be dropped if the Shaikh objected to them. I have enclosed these portions in brackets. It would howev* r seem a pity net to try and obtain them if possible, and 1 do not imagine that the Shaikh will make difficulties over what will appear to him to be comparative trifles in respect of the to him serious obligations of stopping the arms traffic, slavery clauses and receiv ing a British Agent. Draft Agreement between the British Government and Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim bin Thani, Shaikh of Qatar. I, Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim bin 1 hani, undertake that I will, as do the friendly Arab Shaikhs ol Abu Dthabi, Debai, Ajman, Ras-ui-Khaima and Umm- al-Qawain, co-operate with the High British Government in the suppression of the slave trade, piracy, and the Arms Traffic. To this end, Major Knox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, has favoured me with a printed copy of the Treaties and engagements, entered into between the Shaikhs above mentioned and the High British Government and I hereby declare that I accept and w 11 abide by each and all of the obligations imposed on the aforesaid Shaikhs by those Treaties and engagements aforesaid and will observe the same faithfully. On the other hand, the British Government undertakes that I and my sub jects and my and their vessels shall receive all the immunities, privileges and ad vantages that are conferred on the friendly Shaikhs, their subjects and their vessels. In token whereof, Major Knox has affixed his signature with the date thereof to each and everyone of the aforesaid Treaties and Engagements in the copy granted to me and I have also affixed my signature and seal with the date thereof to each and everyone of the aforesaid Treaties and Engagements n two other printed copies of the same Treaties and Engagements that it may not be hidden. And, in particular, I, Shaikh Abdulla, have further published a proclamation, forbidding the import of Arms into my territories of Qatar and all its ports and islands. It is understood, however, that the British Government will arrange to grant me facilities to purchase and import, from the Masqat Arms Warehouse or such other place as the British Government may approve, for my personal use2 and for the arming of my influential friends and dependents for their personal use and protection, such arms and ammunition as I may need and apply for in such fashion as may be arranged hereatter, through the Political Agent, Bahrein. The number of arms, thus annually imported shall not exceed i,ooo rifles per annum with 400 rounds of ammunition per rifle and two pistols shall, for this pur pose, be considered as equivalent to one rifle. The British Government, on its side, in consideratron of the undertaking into which 1 now enter, agrees to pay me a subsidy of Rs. 1,000 per mensem, to be paid regularly to me, or to my duly authorised agent at Bahrein through the Political Agent, Bahrein. I, Shaikh Abdulla, further, in particular, undertake to receive, should the British Government deem it advisable, an Agent from the British Government who shall remain at A 1 Bidaa for the transaction of such business as the British Government mav have with me and to watch over the interests of British traders, residing at my Ports or visiting them upon their lawful occasions. The Customs import dues upon British Goods shall not exceed those levied from my own subjects on their goods and shall in no case exceed 5 per cent ad valorem. British subjects and their goods shall be liable to the payment of no other dues, taxes, or service of any other kind whatsoever beyond that already specified. I, Shaikh Abdulla, further undertake that I will not have relations nor correspond with nor receive, the agent of any other Power without the consent of the High British Government ; Neither will I without such consent, cede, to any other Power or its subjects, laid either on lease, sale, transfer, gift or in any other way whatsoever. I also declare that, without the consent of the High British Government, I will not grant any monopolies, concessions or cable landing rights to anyone whomsoever. On their pxrt, the High British Government, in consideration of these Treaties and Rngagements that I have entered into with them, undertakes to protect me and my subjects and territory from ail aggression by sea and to do their utmost to exact reparation for all injuries that I, or my subjects, my suffer when proceeding to sea upon our lawful occasions. They also undertake to grant me good offices, should l or my subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar. It is, however, thoroughly under stood that this obligation rests upon the British Government only in the event of such aggression, whether by land or sea, being unprovoked by any act or aggression on the part of myself or my subjects against others. In token wdiereof, I, Major S. G. Knox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and I, Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim bin Thani, have respectively signed and affixed our seal to this original document and four copies thereof. Dated at Signatures. DRAFT. Qatar Proclamativn } prohibiting the Traffic in Arms. Be it known to all who may see this ; Whereas it has become known to us that the traffic in Arms into Brftish India, Persia, Kuwait, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast is prohibited, I, the undersigned, Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani, Shaikh of Qatar, have decided to do all in my power to assist the British Government in putting a stop to this illegal traffic and I hereby declare that, from the date of this proclamation, the impoitation of Arms, Cartridges and all munitions into our territory and the exportation of the same to other places are absolutely prohibited. All Arms and Ammunition, imported into Qatar territory or exported theretrom, will, in future, be liable to seizure, and confiscation. That it may not be hidden. Date CSgFD—44-11 -S-i^—GCBP Simla. Signature.CONFIDENTIAL• From Kayoa # Bahrain* To Knox, Bunhira* No. 25-C Dated the 9th September 1914. From the attaohad iridopandant aooount of the quarrel between shaikh Abdullah and hie cousins, it appears that v uauf Kanoo has perhaps exaggerated the tension between tham. Shaikh Abviullah does not appear to be a man of any strength of charac ter. It was with difficulty that ho was persuaded to undertake the duties of Chief of Doha after the mi^er of Shaikh Ahmad as he prefered pearl dealing to responsibility; and ho more than onoe during hia father’s life time threatened to reairn owinr i to Shaikh Ahmad’s sona not treating him with proper considera tion* His present petulant attitude shows that ho has not gained strength with responsibility. Shaikh Khalifah not Shaikh Abdullah is Shaikh Jasim’a eldest, son. My records do not show why Shaikh Jasim nominated him as his successor. The recent quarrel has ostensibly been settled, but there is no doubt that Bin Saud would find a considerable following from the malcontents among the Qatr Shaikhs, although the majority of oomnon people apparently favour Shaikh Abdullah. The news in my No.24-C as to Bin Sand’s Intervention having been invoked was obtained from Shaikh Muqbil, and I think that there is no vdoubt that he is being egged on from Basrah to realise hia old ambition of absorbing Qatr. Consi dering Shaikh Muqbil*o relations with Bin Saud I am inclined to think that the information was in the nature of a ’’ballon d'essai* • It was in the form of a message and I made no reply. It would be convenient for mo to 1mow C-ovemmont ’s in- the tentions in the matter. Unless you diroot me to^contrary, I propose, if Shaikh Muqbil raises matter diroctlv, to say thati (B Bin Baud having accepted the Waliehip io a Turkish subject, and that an the Turks have renounced all claims to Qatr he should not concern himself with that country* I think that Shaikh Abdullah is feeling his way through</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00000e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/67</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00000e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/67</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'XXII/17 Boundary between Koweit &amp; Katif Territory'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1905/1914</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-07-19T22:12:06</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (36 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 38; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
