The first paper, bearing the reference number (48)1 (ff 4-8), deals with a range of generalised issues (responsibilities, finance, administration, supply, briefing and telecommunications) without any specific reference to the airfields at Bahrain or Sharjah. The second paper, reference (48)2 (ff 9-10), specifies airfields covered by the joint-user plan, including air traffic control authorities and the authorities responsible for telecommunications facilities, and specifies whether these will be under RAF or civilian authority (the latter being the case for Bahrain and Sharjah). The third paper, reference (48)4 (ff 11-14, with revisions on ff 17-18), is a detailed plan of telecommunications staffing and facilities for Sharjah and Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Civil Aviation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muharraq Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Telecommunications</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000347#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
