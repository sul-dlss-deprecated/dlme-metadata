Sheil asks Samuel Hennell to establish the truth or falsehood of these claims. Sheil also encloses a letter (not included) which is apparently addressed by the Agent to the Persian Prime Minister [M카rz훮 Taq카 Kh훮n, known as Amir Kabir], although Sheil suspects that it is a forgery. Sheil concludes by requesting that Hennell fine the Agent twelve tomans for his disobedience and disrespect in response to an order given by Sheil.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x00001d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
