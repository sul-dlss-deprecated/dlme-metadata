Carpenters working with native woods thus had to develop complicated joinery techniques to build large objects like coffins and furniture. For expensive luxury items they used timbers such as ebony, cedar, and juniper, imported from Nubia and Punt to the south and Syria and Lebanon to the northeast. Ancient craftsmen used tools that would be familiar to modern carpenters, including adzes, chisels, reamers, and saws. Many ancient Egyptian wooden objects left in tombs as funerary offerings have survived remarkably well. Undisturbed tombs maintain extremely stable climatic conditions, slowing the effects of repeated expansion and contraction that are so damaging to wood. Egypt&rsquo;s relatively dry climate also discourages the growth of mold, insects, and microorganisms that feed on wood. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAncient Egyptian ivory used for carving came from the tusks of elephants and hippopotami. Elephants had probably disappeared from Egypt by the end of the Predynastic Period (circa 3100 B.C.E.), so their ivory had to be imported from Nubia. Hippopotami remained common in the lower Nile Valley until the seventeenth century C.E. Some antiquities mistakenly said to be made of ivory are actually made of the bones or antlers of cattle, sheep, goats, and antelopes. Egyptians used the often ideally shaped leg bones of these animals to create the handles of tools or weapons.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-03-01", "date_added": "2016-04-04 20:55:14", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "49.58.1-.2", "object_id": 3538}, {"accession_number": "37.253Ea-c", "object_id": 3994}, {"accession_number": "37.275E", "object_id": 4007}, {"accession_number": "37.434E", "object_id": 4038}, {"accession_number": "37.612E", "object_id": 4060}, {"accession_number": "37.620E", "object_id": 4064}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.56.19_NegA_print_bw.jpg", "id": 134036, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.56.19_NegA_print_bw.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.56.19_NegA_print_bw.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 57}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 115}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 230}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 461}, {"size": "4", "width": 1290, "height": 775}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.56.19_NegA_print_bw.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Cosmetic Dish in Form of Bound Oryx and Miniature Frog</em>, ca. 1390-1279 B.C.E.
