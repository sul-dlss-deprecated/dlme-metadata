BA./. © ^ f No. 5-B. CONPIBENTIAL. British Residency and Consulate- General, Bus hi re, the 28th January 1944. 3ir, I have the honour to give some details of my recent tour to Bandar Abbas Jask and Chahbar which may be of interest. This tour would not have been possible without the co-operation of the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, who kindly flew me to Sharjah, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who arranged for a ship to take me from Sharjah to Bandar Abbas and for smother vessel to take me to Muscat, Chahbar and Jask. I returned by the first vessel to Bahrain, and was compelled perforce to leave ray office and staff behind, but Mr. Rogers accompanied me from Bandar Abbas on the further portion of my tour. This Residency is hamstrung without a vessel, and I have made repeated representations to be supplied with adequate touring facilities. In the absence of any ship both I and ray officers have been obliged to make^ a number of dangerous and highly uncomfortable journeys by launch, which so far as I know do not fall to the lot of civilian officers in any other part of the world. 2. I made the initial arrangements for this tour with Mr. Rogers who flew with me in a B.O.A.C. flying-boat from Sharjah to Jiwani on ray recent visit to India, when he was taking this roundabout but rapid method of visiting the furthest limits of his jurisdiction. I wanted him to accompany me as he was in close touch with the Biyaban and Mekran Coasts, and also to take him to Muscat as there were a number of coast watching problems which involved both the Persian and Arab shores. 3. On arrival at Bandar Abbas I paid a visit to the fish canning factory. The Senior Naval Officer is disturbed at the presence of neutrals so close to a vital zone, more especially as the antecedents of these men have never been fully elucidated. He v/as anxious that we should organise some form of supervision in the factory, but after discussion with Mr. Rogers I came to the conclusion that it was unlikely that any hostile activities could take place in the factory but that the activities of the Kuropean employees outside would require careful attention and this is being done. There are at present three Banes in the factory and a fourth is shortly due to arrive. There is, in addition, a Persian manager in charge, who has not yet taken over duties. The Danes do not put to sea in the three hired launches which bring the fish from Qishm. These vessels usually ply at night and land their catch between 8 and 9 in the morning. The area within which they may ply has been fixed in consultation with the Haval Officer in charge Korrauz, and should any suspicion arise it would be open to tne *aval authorities to place men on these launches. There is fo course ^ possibility that the Banes may have fifth-column short-wave wireless transmitting sets but these can only be detected by the Service autn.^JJ. ties themselves. There are no Buropean women in Bandar Abbas, and the. Danes' families are in Tehran. The factory itself t r emar „ ably ent, and it was interesting to see the tins being built up from the a tinplate, and the fish being prepared and cooked for t-.sxr receptacles. The tinning plant involves a large number of extremely sh arp le ouerating at a high rate of speed which are entirely unprotected, in fact there can be few factories with so much unguarded machinery lying in wait for the fin; ere of the employees. The Danes however assured. ; me that no accidents had taken place. Curiously enough it is difiicult to purchase the tinned fish locally as it is all exported to the north. The fishing vessel, Sang Sar, which had recently been returned It* the Uavy, had new aerodrome which was at that moment ’ , being developed by the H.A.F. Anti-Locust Flight, and passed tne area in which the rubber growing plant, Euforbia Larica, grows p “ widespread growth of this plant has been reported Md samples have been to the M.E.S.C. Mr. Rogers took me part ol e wa Y and we completed the rougher portion of the journey in a Jeep belonging to the Locust party. The latter part of the road was appalling, in His Majesty^ Minister, British Legation, TEHRAN.2 fact on our return we stuck in a stony river bed and only extricated our selves with the help of some local inhabitants, Mr. Hogere went to Minab last Bpring along this track in his own car, this -being a very serious risk for a new vehicle, but brought it back to Bandar Abbas by dhow. I feel that officers in these out of the way places should not be compelled to risk valuable passenger cars under such circumstances, which they cannot replace except at x fantastic prices, and that Service vehicles uould be provided for them instead. At the aerodrome I found some officers of the South African Air Force who were enthusiastic about the newly discovered aerodrome which has an entirely natural surface and run ways of over 1400 yards in length with flat approaches. Mr. Lean pointed out some locust droppings to me which showed that the area had been heavily frequented in the past year. He doubted whether the invasion would mature on the scale which had been anticipated but was naturally relaxing no precautions. I enquired from him whether the zeal of the ubiquitous Russians was entirely inspired by an interest in locusts, or whether they had other objects as well. He replied that he thought that the interest was equally divided between the locusts and reconnaissances of a wider nature. It is interesting to speculate what reply we should get if the Government of India proposed to send locust parties to the Russian frontier. 5. The Trans Jordan Frontier Force was due to arrive that afternoon * and a site for their camp had been selected by Mr. Rogers and the Locust Officer. I had seen a dump of their stores at the jetty. The intimation of the ship’s arrival only came the same night that it arrived, there was no announcement that the ship was bringing a party to guard the stores, and no intimation whatever regarding the officer in charge of them. Mr. Rogers had some difficulty in persuading the Customs authorities to allow them to take charge of an area outside the Customs and keep their goods there. The officer in charge of the stores had no authority to select a camp site, an important question with a unit of this size, and this, as I mentioned above, had to be done for them. In addition it had been arranged by Paiforce, without consulting this Residency, that the Consulate would use a wireless telephone lent them by the Navy as a link for passing messages from the Trans Jordan Frontier Force through Naval authorities to the R.A.P. at Bharjah and Paiforce. This would have been completely beyond the slender resources of this post and I immediately informed them that it was out of the question. It is difficult to describe the dislocation caused by the despatch of a large military body without adequate consideration to areas in which they are entirely dependent for their local contacts on a small post. We have had an unfortunate experience at Bushire during the past year of the amount of work in which we are willynilly involved, without, I may say, receiving thanks from anyone. 6. On my retiim to Bandar Abbas I examined the Consulate buildings and out houses. These are in a deplorable condition and have deteriorated very seriously since Dr. Richardson’s day. Mr. Rogers informed me that he had already expended his annual grants but that he had not yet succeed ed in even completing the repairs to the roofs. I instructed him to place the matter in hand without delay and said that I would go into the financial question on my return to Bushire. It will be recalled that the Residency Engineer was permitted to return to India, his duties being undertaken by the Secretary. I am afraid that in the state of chaos into which oufc public works organisation has drifted it will not be easy to arrange lor the essential repairs to be dene, and the work will now have . to be paid for at famine prices. 7. As I arrived in Bandar Abbas in the morning and had to go on board at 3 p.m. there was little time to complete ray inspection or to have given as much time to security questions as I should have wished. Bandar Abbas was vacant when Sir John Dashwood made his precent tour and he therefore did not visit it, but Mr. Rogers was present at Bushire at the time and is fully aware of his methods and requirements and is doing his best to bring Bandar Abbas up to the standard of other posts. The room in which confidential work is done requires some structural alteration which he is putting in hand as soon as circumstances permit. 8. A Hindu temple here bears mute witness to the former existence of a prosperous Indian coraraunity, and thetr departure Irora Kerman and Bandar Abbas has had a very serious effect on the economic situation. They conducted a specialised export trade and had connections with India which Persia could not replace, and with their passage the province sus tained a loss which it could ill afford. Before...mm 3 Before leaving Bandar Abbas I raet the British subjects and also two members of the Gellahdari family but had ncytirae for anything nore than a few words. Messrs. Gray Kackenzie, the British India Agents, have complained for many months past of the lack of landing facilities and constant delays to steamers and the merchants of the town sent a representation to Tehran on the subject last year. hr. Rogers has investigated the matter but does not think that for the present traffic ^the•arrangements are entirely unsuitable and will take up the matter the port shows signs of being used to greater capacity. The lack of ~shipping has largely killed the trade of the place and what remains has been ruined by the shortage of motor transport to the interior. 9. It will be recalled that Mr. Rogers v/as taken over by the Navy to Khor Rakkan on the Batinah Coast to interrogate a survivor from the submarine destroyed near there by the B.A.F. An account of this has been sent to the senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, separately. It is interesting; to note that the Shaikh of Khor Fakkan, Shaikh Abdullah al Hamadi, is a recent emigre from the hinterland of Lingah, a territory which is almost entirely inhabitsXed by perrons of Arab origin. Curiously enough Khor Fakkan is in an enclave of Jawaaimi territory and affiliated to Sharjah and so under the Bahrain Agency and not, as might have been anticipated, under Muscat. 10. We then proceeded to Muscat, and an account of this portion of the tour has been recorded separately. Vie arrived at Chahbar on the 1st of December and went ashore shortly after sunrise. I was greatly struck with the derelict state of this town, which I had last seen as a flourishing port in the year 1916, and was more than ever surprised that it should have been considered as an appropriate site lor a Vice-Consulate I first of all visited the aerodrome, which has now been deserted for a landing strip further away and parallel to the seashore- It was on this landing strip, then entirely unmarked, that the Russian pilot had put down Mr. Rogers on his recent visit from Jiwani. The Russian planes are able to land on the smallest possible space, but have a short radius, and carry reserve petrol tins strapped about the machine. A Russian plane was expected that morning and came in after we had returned to the ship and its extremely low landing speed was clearly noticeable even from a distance. 11. The Persian bureaucracy appears at its worst in these outlying areas, and since no departments can ever agree amongst themselves, every thing has to be referred to Tehran who know nothing about the local conditions. In an area which would barely support one well paid officer, each department must have its separate representative and, for example, the Police and Gendarmerie are everywhere represented by separate offici als whose interests both pecuniary and otherwise very frequently clash. I observed that although the vast majority of the inhabitants were in rags, some of the women being scarcely covered, yet there was cloth in the raonox&gt;oly shop but, apparently, as at Bushire, only for show, for as the manager said 'there was no order for its sale'. Officials who are posted to these areas are sometines lost sight of for years and the local medical officer is an instance in point. »e passed this officer’s house and dispensary on our way back from the aerodrome and found an aged Armenian obviously more than a little cracked, find looking for all the world like a medaeval alchemist, living in the filthiest conditions and with a fly-blown dispensary which contained only a few empty bottles. As this part of the world is threatened with a cholera epidemic the opinion of the local officials regarding his inadequacy was loudly expressed. They clato) that he refuses to supply them with any essential drugs and he in his turn stated that they only wished to secure a free supply from him in order to resell it themselves. The local inhabitants do not of course receive any treatment whatever. 12. The coast line of the Bandar Abbas Consulate area covers about 550 miles or roughly the area from Ushant to the German border, and extends as far as but not including Jiwani. Mr. Rogers has been at con siderable pains to link up his coast watching organisations with those in Gwadar andBritish Baluchistan, and has covered some 10,000 miles since lust March. The main difficulties here, as on the Batinah, consist of slow coiomuni cat ions, and unless and until an adequate launch is provided t^e work cannot be fully effective. This has been 'taken up separately. \ I n the meantime it is hoped that by establishing close relations with the local sardars and headmen timely information will oe received of enemy agents attempt to secure a footing on shore. 13. The following morning we arrived at Jask and were met by Captain.4 Captain Ahmed, the officer of the Indian Signal Corps now in charge of the wireless station. We proceeded to the lines of the R.A.3. Levies who appeared to me surprisingly smart and apparently well content with their work. Thercmen are almost entirely Baluchis from British Mekran, and are officered by Arabs from the Iraq. Levies, which is not a very happy arrangement. None of the British officers speak Baluchi or Brahui and I suggested that they obtain the loan of one or two officers from the ekran Levy Corps. . This unit had given some trouble by marrying local omen, contrary to Persian law, but the officer in charge of the unit informed me that it had now been prohibited. The R.A*P. had contemplated posting a second Company here from unite that were being disbanded on the Trucial Coast, and this has now been agreed to on the understanding that the men will wear pugrees and net Arab dress. Actually they will be main ly of Persian origin which is very helpful in collecting information regarding the surrounding country. So far these Levies have lost no rifles, and it is to be hoped that their good luck will continue. 14. I then returned to the town where Captain Ahmed had invited the local officials to meet us. Their complaints regarding supplies had been met by the recent despatch of grain from Bushire, which curiously enough crossed or very nearly crossed some grain despatched up Culf from Chahbar. They complained bitterly of the absence of rice, and I suggest ed to Mr. Rogers that this might be sent from Bushire. This has now been arranged. The same shortage of piecegoods existed here, and equally the prohibition upon their sale, in fact trade was at a standstill. Jask, curiously enough, has no medical officer whatever, and if anyone is taken ill he has the choice between death or an early transfer to Bandar Abbas. A recent epidemic of smallpox in this area nad been dealt with by an R.A.F. doctor who was flown over from Sharjah to carry out mass vaccination, and his visit had been greatly appreciated. 15. I then went to see the wireless station which was under Captain Ahmed’s charge. He had been supplied with comprehensive orders by Captain Keen, when he was at Bandar Abbas, instructing him how to proceed, and it was clear from his remarks that he was suffering from a alight excess of zeal. He complained bitterly of the dishonesty and incapacity of the local Persian officials and appeared very anxious to set the administration right, but I advised him to proceed slowly and stick to the duties outlined for him which were to control the wireless station and supply us with what information he coui.d secure. He is, however, a very promising young man, with quite a respectable knowledge of Persian, and I have every hope that under Mr. Rogers’ direction he will prove entirely satisfactory. He controls the wireless station by the simple process of locking the door of the place and taxing the key away with him and did ® ^ ^ ^ A 1 -? o rw=&gt;r*V iTPi ncr his £lticL» • • • •5nd caused untold misery to thousands, in fact there can be few areas, apart from Central Europe, which will have paid so great a price for the ultimate Allied triumph* In 1941 I met many colonies of Persian emigres on the Batinah, and numbers have sold themselves into slavery in order to eat. Last Spring the Political Agent Bahrain saw hundreds of destitute Persians who were crovdlng into the Trucial Coast, and counted ten corpses on the beach at Sharjah in a single morning. 18. The attitude of the Persian Government could not be more lous. They take no interest whatever in these areas that they adk^'nister so badly, and the sole oeject appeal's to be to extract the maximum revenue in return for* the minimum service. Every fresh law or decree is slnply an excuse for further extortion and another nail in the coffin of this coast. These tecritodes are too remote from the Gapttal to attract attention or secure redress, and the Garrasiri is a shabby relation whom the plateau Persian likes to forget except at election time# A travelling inspector occasionally makes a quick swoop to relieve some lesser &gt;ird of prey of a portion of his ill-gotten gains, but for the most part as£ the local officials are left to themselves. In fact, it is very probable that mere is known about this area by ourselves than the fernIan Government, and any effort at improvement has certainly emanated from us and not from them. 19. It may be said that these areas should have had their own shipping and fended for themselves# At one time they did so, but the bulk of their carrying trade was ruined by the cu^t-throat competition of the British India Steam navigation Company, and I well remember the late Sir Hugh Biscoe describing their monopolistic activities in Bandar Abbas in the early years of this century. The decay of their economy is now viciole and our share in it plain, but it is not so easy to prescribe a remedy and impossible to do so in a brief compass. One thing however is clear, namely that until shipping restrictions are lightened and import and export trade facilitated little can be done. There is no life because there is no trade, no trade because there are no ships, and no ships because there is no trade that will benefit us. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India and His ^lajasty's Consul at iBandax* tbbas, and the Secretary ol of,ate xor India. I have the honour to be.

At the end of November and the beginning of December the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf visited Bandar Abbas, Jask and Ghahbar, ports in Persian l.lekran^ under the jurisdiction of the Vice Consul at Bandar Abbas. The Political Resident,who does not fail togocrijgt out the difficulties created by his lack of ©«§lc±ad touring facilities and the need for a launch for the Vice Consul, Bandar Abbas, deplores the decline of these ports which he attributes partly to the corruption and inefficiency of the Persian administration and partly to the rise of Dubai and Sharjah on the Arab coast, and wartime restrictions on shipping, While at Bandar Abbas Sir Geoffrey Prior visited the Fish Canning Factory which is managed by Danes, and the new Aerodrome being developed at Sarkhan by R.A.F. and Russian Anti-Locust Units, where the impending arrival of a battalion of the mechanised regiment of the Transjordan Frontier Force was causing Mr* Rogers, Vice Consul at Bandar Abbas, some trouble. At Bandar Abbas itself the Poltical Resident inspected the Consulate buildings which he reports to be in a dilapidated condition and went into the question of cypher security etc. Sir Geoffrey Prior arrived at Chahbar on December 1st and saw the deserted aerodromeand the landing strip now used by Russian ’planes. He was struck by the decay of what had once been a flourishing port. At Jask the Political Resident paid a visit to the R.A.F. levies who appear^ surprisingly smart and apparently well content with their work”. He alsomet some of the local officials. He then inspected the Wireless Station now under the charge of Captain Z. Ahmed of the Indian Signal Corps, whom he considers'h very promising young man' 1 who 'has shown a conplete ascendancy over his area without, as x’ar as I can ascertain, any objections being raised'. In view of the callous attitude of the Tehran Government towards this area and the decline of trade and shipping to the South Persian ports, it is doubtful whether anything can be done to restore ary measure of prosperity to these places, at any rate until it is possible to lighten shipping restrictions and facilitate trade.

Sir, I have the honour to give eoroe details of my reoent tour to Bandar Abbas Jaak and Ghahbar which may be of Interest. This tour would not have been poaslble without the co-operation of the Air officer Commanding Iraq who kindly flew me to Sharjah, and .the Senior Naval Officer, J-ersian Gulf, who arranged for a eh ip to take roe from SharJCah to Bandar Abbae and for another vest el to take roe to Muscat, Jhahbar and Jask.

In the absence of any ship both I and my officers have been obliged to make a number of dangerous and highly uncomfortable journeys by launch, which so far as 1 know do not fall to the lot of civilian officers in any other part of the world. 2.

On arrival at Bandar Abbas I paid a visit to the fish canning factory. The Senior Naval Officer is disturbed at the presence of neutrals so close to a vital zone, more especially as die antecedents of these men have never been fully elucidated. He was anxious that we should organise some form of supervision in the factory, but after discussion with Mr. Rogers I came to the ooncluslon that it was unlikely that ary hostile activities could take place in the factory but that die activities of the European employees outside would require carvful attention and this is being done. There are at present three Danes in the factory and a fourth is shortly due to arrive. There is, in addition, a Persian manager in charge, who has not yet taken over his duties. The Danes do not put to sea in the three hired launches which bring the fish from ,JLshm. These vessels usually ply at night and land their oatch between 8 and 9 in the roorniiig. The area within which they may ply has been fixed in consultation with the Baval Officer in Charge Hormuz, and should aqy suspicion arise it would be open to the Naval authorities to place men on these launches. There is of oourse a possibility that His Majesty f e Minister, British Legation, TSHHAH . / the* the Danes ro«y have fifth-column short-wave wireleee transmitting sets but these can only be detected by the Service authorities themselves. There are no Suropean women in Bandar Abbas* and the Danes* families are in Tehran. The factory itself is remarkably efficient* and it was interesting to see the tins being built up from the raw tinplate* and the fish being prepared end cooked for their receptacles. The tinning plant involves a large number of extremely sharp shears operating at a high rate of speed which are entirely unprotected* in fact there can be few factories with so much unguarded machineiy lying in wait for the fingers of the employees. The Danes however aseured me that no accidents had taken place. Curiously enough it is difficult to purchase the tinned fish locally as it is all exported to the north. The fishing vessel* Sang Bar, which had recently been returned by the Navy* had not yet arrived. 4. 1 then visited new aerodrome which was at that moment being developed by the K.A.F. Anti locust Flight* and pasted the area in which the rubber growing plant* guforbia larica* grows wild. The widespread growth of this plant has be. a reported and samples have been sent to the tf.S.ii.c:. Ur. Rogers took me part of Ihe way in his oar, and ws completed the router portion of the journey in a Jeep belonging to the locust party. The latter part of the road was appalling* in fact on our return we stuck in a stony river bed and only extricated ourselves with the help of some local inhabitants. Kr. Rogers went to Minab last Spring along this track in his own oar* this being a very serious risk for a new vehicle* but brought it back to Bandar Abbas by dhow. I feel lhat officers in these out of the way places should not be compelled to risk valuable passenger oars under such circumstances* which they cannot replace exftept at fantastic prices, and that Service vehicles should be provided fbr them instead.

Gray Maokensle, the Britith India Agents, have complained for many months past of the lack of landing facilities and constant delays to steamers and the merchants of the town sent a representation / tojHMHH - 4 - to Tehran on the subject laet year* inr* hogers has inveeti- gated the matter but doe* not think that for the present traffic the arranges.exii£ are entirely unsuitable and will take up the matter if the port shows signs of being used to greater capacity* The lack of shipping has largely killed the trade of the place and what remains hat been ruined by the shortage of motor transport to the interior* 9* It will be recalled that Mr* Rogers wae taken over by the Ha^y to Khor Fakkan on the Batinah Coast to interrogate a survivor from the aubroarinw destroyed near there by the R.a*F* An account of this hae been sent to the Senior flfcval Cfficer, Persian Oulf, separately* It is interesting to note that the Shaikh of Khor Fakkan, Shaikh Abdullah al Hamadi, ie a recent emigre from the hinterland of lingah 9 a territory which is almost entirely inhabited by persons of Arab origin* Curiously enou^i Khor Kakkan is in an enclave of Jawaslmi territory and affiliated to Sharjah and eo under the Bahrain Agency and not 9 as might have been anticlpated 9 under Muscat* 10* We then proceeded to Muso&amp;t, a nd an account of this portion of the tour has been recorded separately* We arrived at Ch&amp;hbar on the 1st of December and went ashore shortly after sunrise* I was greatly struck with the derelict state of this town which I had last seen as a flourishing port in the year i9i6» and was more than ev&lt;?r surprised that it should have been considered as an appropriate site for a Vice Consul ate* I firct of all visited the aerodrome, which has now batn deserted for a landing strip further away and parallel to the seashore* It was on this landing strip, then entirely unmarked, that the Ruesi&amp;ft pilot had put down Ur* Rogers on his recent visit from Jiwanl* The Russian planes are able to land on the smallest possible apace, but have a short radius, and cany reserve petrol tine strapped about the machine* A Russian plane was expected that morning and came in after we had returned to the ship and its extremely low landing epeed was clearly noticeable even from a distance* 11* The Persian bureaucracy appears at its worst in these outlying areas, end since no departments can ever agree amongst themselves, every thing has to be referred to Tehran who know nothing about the local conditions* In an area which would barely support one well paid officer, each department must have its separate representative and, for example, the Jtollce and Qendarmerle are everywhere represented by separate officials tfioee Interests both pecuniary and otherwise very frequently clash. I observed that although thfc vast majority of the inhabitants were in rags, some of the women being scarcely covered, yet there was cloth in the monopoly ehbp but, apparently, as at Bushire, only for show, for as the manager said “there was no order for its sale** Officials who are posted to these areas are sometimes Id*t sight of for years and the local medical officer is an Instance in point* We passed this officer's house and dispensary on our way back from the aerodrome and found an aged strmenian obviously more than a little cracked, and looking for all the world like a mediaeval alchemist, living in the filthiest conditions and with a fly-blown dispensary which contained only a few empty bottle s* As this part of the world is threatened with a cholera epidemic the opinion of the local offiolale regarding his inadequacy was loudly expressed* They claim that he refuses to eupply them with any essential drugs and he in his turn eta ted that they only wished to secure / *- 5 . a free supply from him in order to Besell it themeel'veB* The local inhabitants do not of course receive any treatment whatever* 12* The coast line of the Bandar Abbae Consulate area covers about 550 miles, or roughly the area from Ushant to the German border, and extends as far as but not including Jiwani. Mr* Rogers has been at considerable pains to link up his coast watching organisations with those in Cwadur aid British Baluchistan, and has covered some 10,000 miles since last March* The main difficulties here, as on the Batinah, consist of slow communications, and unless and until an adequate launch is provided the work cannot be fully effective* This has been taken up separately* In the meantime it is hopad that by establishing close relatioiiS with the local sardars and headmen IttMg timely information will be received of aiy enemy agents attempt to secure a footing on shore* I'dm The following morning we arrived at Jask and were met by Captain Ahmed, the officer of the Indian Signal Corps now in charge of the wireless station* we proceeded to the lines of the IUA*F* levies who appeared to me surprisingly smart and apparently well content with their work* The men are almost entirely Baluchis from British Kekran, and are officered by Arabs from the Ira&lt;i levies, ehich is not a very happy arrangement* Hone of the British officers speak Baluchi or Brahul and I suggested that thqy obtain the loan of one or two officers from the Mekran levy Corps* This unit had given some trouble by marrying local women, contrary to Persian law, but the officer in charge of the unit informed me that it had now been prohibited* The R*a*F* had contemplated posting a second Company here from units that were being dis banded on the Truoial Coast, and this has now been agreed to on the understanding that the menwlll wear pugrees and not Arab dress* Actually they will be mainly of lersian origin Which is very helpful in collecting Information regarding the surrounding country* So far these levies have lost no rifles, and it Is to be hoped that their good luck will oonti nue« 14* I then returned to the town where Captain Ahmed had invited the local officials to meet us* Ifreir complaints regarding supplies had been met by the recent despatch of grain from Bus hire, which curiously enough crossed or very nearly crossed some grain despatched up Gulf from Chahbar* They complained bitterly of the absence of rice, and 1 suggested to Mr* Rogers that this might be sent from Buehire* This has now been arranged* The same shortage of piece goods existed here, and equally the prohibition upon their sale, in faot trade was at a standstill* Jask, curiously enough, has no medical officer whatever, and if aqyone is taken 111 he has the choice between death or an early transfer to Bandar Abbas* A recent epidemic of smallpox in this area had been dealt with by an R*A*F. dootor who wae flown over from Sharjah to carry out mass: vaccination, and his visit had been gre&amp;tly appreciated* / 15/ 18 . 6 15* I then went to eee the wireleefc fetation whicii was under Japtain .-dimed'e charge* He had been supplied with comprehensive orders by Jap tain Keen, when he was at Bandar .dibas. Instructing him how to proceed, and it wag clear from hit remarks that he was suffering from a slight excess of zeal* He complained bitterly of the dishoneety and incapacity of the local iersian off id alt ana appeared very anxious to set the acta inis tr&amp;tl an right, but i advised him to proceed slowly and stick to the duties outlined for him which were to control the wireless station and supply us with what information he could secure* K* ie, however, a very promising young man, with «|ulte a respectable knowledge of tertian, and i have every hope that under &gt;r* Rogers' direction he will prove entirely satisfactory* He controls the isdrelesc station by the simple process of locking the door of the place and taking the key away with him md did not consider it was possible to immobilise the macnineiy during his absence, but was &lt;iuite certain that his method was fully effective* the actual work of transmission is supervised by him personally* He has, however, made certain other arrangements to keep himself informed of the Telegraph Master'a actions* « I than visited the light house and inspected Its me onanism and m quite convinced that my original diagnosis of it a irregular! ty was correct, ly that it had not been signalling; to ax. 13 submarines but that the personnel had been misappropriating the fbel for the lamp* • 15* It is coca si anally suggested that Persians cannot abide Indians in a position of authority *nd that it is out of the question to utilise them in this country* while it is oleai that a Dravidian coolie is not likely to have much influence, 1 have never found that there is any objection to Indians of good status, especially those from Northern India, and I have frequently recommended their employment* 1 was much impressed by the success attained by dap tain Ha»san in the Kerman f 1 district, in a post that brought him into conflict with vested interests, and it is interesting to record that Captain Ahmad, who is almost straight from college, has at.t^lned a complete asowdanay over his area, without, so far as I could ascertain, any objections using raided* 17* My distinguished predecessor, the late Sir Percy Cox, prophesied that the raising of customs dues and the extension of Persian bureaucratic control would lead to the decline of the south Persian ports, and that Sharjah and Dubai would rise in their place* this has largely come to pass thanks to the Pahlavi regime, but the war has greatly increased their difficulties* _ The restrictions upon exports to and imports from India, Iraq and the T&gt;*S*a*, the diversions of shipping and the dislocation of internal security have had a deadly effect and caused untold misery to thousands, in fact there can be few areas, apart from Central Europe, which will have paid so great a juries for the ultimate Allied triumph* In 1941 I met many colonies of Persian emigres on the Batlnah, and numbers have sold themselves into slavery in order to eat* Last Spring the Political Agent Bahrain saw hundreds of 4 destitute Persians who were crowding into the Truoial Coast, and counted ten corpses on the beach at Sharjah in a single mornir^i •7 (2) 18. Th« attitule of the lereian Gtoirernioent could not be more callous. They take no interest whatever in theee areas that thqy administer so badly, and the sole object appears to be to extract the maximum revenue in return for the minimum service. livery fresh law or decree is simply an excuse for further extortion and another nail in the coffin of this coast. These territories are too remote from the Capital to attract attention or secure redress, and the Gann sir! is a shabby relation whom the plateau Persian likes to forget except at election time. A travelling inspector occasionally makes a quick stoop to relieve some lesser bird of prey of a portion of his ill-gotten gains, but ibr the most part the local officials are left to themselv es. In fact, it is very probable that more is known about this area by ourselves than the lersian Government, and any effort at improvement has certainly emanated from us and not from them. 19. It may be said that these areas should have had their own shipping and fended for themselves. At one time they did so, but the bulk of their carrying trade was ruined by the cut-throat competition of the British India Steam Navigation Company, aid I well remember the late Sir Hugh Biscoe describing their monopolistic activities in Bandar Abbas in the early years of this century. The decay of their economy is now visible and our share in it plain, but it is not so easy to prescribe a remedy and impossible to do so in a brief compase • One tiling however is dear, namely that until shipping restrictions are lightened and import and export trade facilitated little can be done. There is no life because there is no trade, no trade because 1 there are no tfiips, and no &amp;ipe because there is no trade j that will benefit us.

Political Resident’s tour to Muscat in February, 1940. £5 SEEM POLITICAL CCMM1TTE FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. Colonel Prior, political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in a letter to India of which a copy is submitted, has written a detailed and interesting account of a tour which he took in Muscat in February last. He has enclosed some photographs which are not first class ; but serve to illustrate his journey. On his way to Muscat Colonel Prior passed a day at Kuwait, and also put in a little time with the Senior Naval Officer at Khor Kuwai where he indulged in big game fishing, a comparatively new form of sport for political officers in the Gulf. The chief interest of the tour centres around Muscat, however, where thanks to the Political Agent, Captain/ (11844) Wt.29201/P.295 2,000 9/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685Captain HickinlDotham’s arrangements^the Political Resident was able to see a great deal in a short time. Colonel Prior at a private visit had an opportunity of congratulating H.H. the Sultan on the progress he had made in re-establishing control over his dominions and assured him that he could rely on the fullest support in attaining this object. His Highness alluded to the good relations existing between Muscat and H.M.G. and spoke of the ’'nice treaty” which they had with us. A tour of the Muscat coast as far north as Shinas was undertaken through difficult motoring country abounding in hazards such as quicksands and mud creeks. Several places of interest were visited among which was the great fort of Hazam. Colonel Prior is convinced that a launch is most essential for Muscat where the only means of transport along the rock- bound coast for the Political Agent is by open rowing boat. His chief comment is that Muscat has great possibilities and that if the Sultan can consolidate and extend his control there should be much improvement in trade, principally with India. The report is of peculiar interest^for a month later a tour along the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf and the Muscat Coast was made by Sir Basil Newton, H.M. Ambassador, Bagdad, and his report and comments are submitted simultaneously on a separate file. For information. SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE''.ft 1ITTEE CONFIDENTIAL.

Our return was a little more difiioult as oui host tried to take a short out by the west side of the fortress to the left of the pioture, which involved Jumping a stream which had been bridged with large blocks of stone. Our sump got caught on ons of these blocks of stone, but after much grinding of the clutch we finally passed over with the assistance of 10 or 15 men, leaving our exhaust pipe behind. l mention these details to show the treatment that cars may expect in this territory. Our host then insisted upon reversing the Isti^beO, and accompanying us on our way, but the long Buffering oar was seriously wounded and *fter steaming away like a aamovar and firing upon a steadily decreasing number of cylinders, it finally came to an uncompromising halt. ©thing deterred, oui host sprang out and bundled me into another car, and drove on until he felt that honour was satisfied, when he allowed us to say goodbye. 37, The next day we left for 2 oh&amp;r, and the pilot, uuj. became more than ever neoeesary as the road lay along the unending shore of the Batineh, with occasional incursions inland to avoid the mouths of the wadis running down to the sea. v hen inland, the track was narrow and there was only just room to scrape pact the thorny trees end bushes.
