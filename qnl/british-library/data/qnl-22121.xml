Office of the Camp, Bahrain, Belgrave told me today that during the war the n. Shaikh has been supplementing the allowances paid to his He now finds himself short of money and wishes to reimburse himself by drawing from the State treasury a sum of Rupees four or five lakhs which is roughly what he has spent on these additional allowances. He also wishes to increase his Civil List by about Rs 50,000/- to be distributed amongst the various recipients in dearness allowances which it is his intention to reduce or withdraw according as dearness allowances paid to Government servants etc. are reduced or withdrawn. 2. Belgrave told me that he had not informed the Shaikh that he is mentioning the matter to me arti that for the present he is trying to choke him off.

Bahrain receipt,f CONFIDENTIAL . D.O.No.C/910. The political Agency, Bahrain. Dated the 17th August, 1946, \ (%) Dear Colonel Hay, Will you please refer to your demi-official^ letter No. C/533 dated the 24th July, 1946. W &amp; 2 . as early as 1935 Government seems to have succeeded in establishing the principle,..vide correspondence ending with Residency letter No. 1018-S*dated the 20th December, 1935, that the oil royalties were to be divided in the proportion of one third to the Ruler and Ruling Family and two thirds to the Bahrain Government. It was subsequently laid down by the political Agent on the instructions of the Political Resident that no additions should be made to the Civil List estimates and that any extra expenditure in this connection should be met from the one third share oi the oil royalty, which was declared to be a contribution towards the Civil List, please see in this connection the attached copies of letters exchanged by this Agency with the late Ruler and^ r; Belgrave.^, f 3 # In view of the above I am strongly averse to allowing His Highness to draw any additional money from the State treasury or to make any further additions to ohe civil List. During the last six years he has received an average of Rs. 13,20, 000 a year from the Oil Royalty and the Civil List, enough to leave him a very handsome balance after paying the A1 Khalifah allowances and meeting his other expenses. He receives in addition 6]f on the value of every goat, sheep, and cow brought into the Island, and has besides a private income of between Ss. 120,000 and 150,000 a year from his town properties and other investments. I should add here that Shaikhs Mahoramed bin Isa and Abdullah bin Isa are also in receipt of comfortable private incomes and that these two Shaikhs between them receive no less than one third of all i, j the allowances and bonuses His Highness pays the Ai Khalifah, P vide the enclosure to this Agency demi-official letter Ro. C/187 dated the 11th February, 1943. In view of this perhaps the best answer to His Highness would be that suggested in Sir Geoffrey prior’s demi-official letter No. 130-S dated 1 3 - the 13th February, 1943. 4 . sir Geoffrey speaks of Shaikh Salman as living well within his income, and all that I hear of His Highness confirms this. It is not understood how he now claims to be short of money, unless we accept his view that the whale of the one third share of the oil royalty belongs to him and that he should be reimbursed for any payments he makes from it to other members of the Ruling Family. Apart from the question of principle involved his one third share of the royalty is a very large sum indeed which, in view of the Bahrain petroleum Company’s mounting production, is likely to increase still further. It will be seen from correspondence ending with Mr. , Weightman’s demi-official letter No. C/757-10/1 dated the 7th -d' October, 1940 that it was at one time contemplated that the one third share of the oil royalty would eventually be reduced to a fifth or even a tenth, ard that this proposal was discussed with Shaikh Salman himself.

I suggest, there!ore, tnat wnen Diuxxzvai returns to the attack Belgrave should inform him that in I suggest, therefore, that when the Shaikh view of the correspondence referred to in paragraph two of this letter he must consult me regarding His Higlmess^ suggestions, and that I should then be authorised to write to Belgrave and inform him that we cannot agree to His Highness^ proposals for the reasons I have stated above. Yours sincerely,I have made some confidential enquiries about the properties of H.ii., his uncles, and brothers, which are as follows 3 vegetable markets at Manama 1 public vegetable scale at Manama 1 yard n-^r Manama Municipality 1 plot of ground for selling firewood. Wednesday market ? , 120 shops. Amaras and 1st floor rooms Yard at Muharraq. The above are called , Haewan property* which are only inherited by the Ruler of Bahrain from the ex-Ruler. In the past the income of the above was collected through the Manama Municipality. Only this year they have been given for a yearly contract of Rs.57,000/- to Hassan bin Abdul Rasul bin Rajab, which is said to be in partnership with J.E. Khudhuri. Besides H.H. has personal property of gardens. The total income of H.H*s property is between Ks.120,000/- and 150,000/- per annum. He also owns a building of shops and coffee-shops near Muharraq Baladeya. The following belong to him Meat market, fish market, vegetable market, in one compound, given by contract for Rs.6000/- per year to Haji Sanad Al-Gasab. 2 big gardens still in his name, otherwise all the rest of his gardens has been distributed amon^his sons during his life time. The personal income of ^he above markets and is estimated at fc.30000/- pe~ year. 2 gardens &amp;HAIKH ABDULLA The above Shaikh Abdulla Is the wealthiest person of al Khalifah family with the exception of H.H., because he has occupied his mother*s and sister’s properties. It Is estimated that he is getting between Rs. 70/80000 per year. The brothers of H.H. have incomes from their private landed properties and gardens which is estimated to be not more than Rs. 12000/- each.COftFinSITTIAL A.d.viserate, Bahrain, August. 15, 1946. (/• I wish to rotor to the question of His Highness’s Privy purse and the State Civil List which came into existence when the late ruler, T • I • Shaikh Hamed, became Deputy Ruler. The civil list was intended to cover the Ruler’s personal expenditure and to provide salaries to members of the Ruling Ramily, The civil list, in which I include an item then described as 'Religious Festivals and Summer Moves' which was also paid to the Ruler, was as follows year civil list total revenue 1344 4,40,000 10,62,000 1345 4,53,500 11,92,000 1346 4,62,000 12,40,000 1347 5,04,000 12,16,000 1348 5,08,000 11,34,000 { m : 1348 the civil list was limited to not more than 5,' 00,000 and in 1349 reductions of 1CK were made in many cases owing to,the financial situation.) 1349 4,88,500 8,18,000 1350 4,34,700 7,96,000 1351 4,13,800 6,84,000 ( Shaikh Isa, who was in receipt of an allowance died in 1351.) 1352 3,76,700 7,26,000 ( In 1352 there was a further 2^ cut in the civil list.} 1353 3,79,000 8,87,000 1354 3,92,000 13,43,000 ( Cuts in the civil list were restored.) 1355 4,34,600 16,47,000 1356 4,45,700 43,36,000 1357 4,45,700 48,11,000 1358 4,38,000 45,78,000 1359 4,34,000 49,00,000 1360 4,34,000 44,32,000 1361 4,28,000 39,81,000 ( E. H. Shaikh Hamed died in 1361.) 1362 4,24,000 54,74,000 1363 4,24,000 55,00,000 1364 4,24,000 64,00,000 ( His Highness receives 12,500 per month from the civil list.) It will be seen from these figures that at a time when the revenue of the State was very much less than it is now the civil list was about 75,000 higher. His Highness now considers that in view of the increased7 - 2 - increased revenue of* the State, apart from the Oil royalty, the civil list should be increased. My own suggestion is that it should revert to 4-^ lakhs or 5 lakhs. If this were done there would be no change in the allowances which are drawn by the Ruling Family, the amount which is now drawn by them is almost as much again as the civil list, the difference being made up by His Highness from the one third of the oil royalty which he receives. If the civil list v\/ere increased it would relieve His Highness a little of the large monthly payments which he makes to his relations. ty- All His Highness'-,personal accounts are kept uy me and all payments are made by me on behalf of His Highness through his account and there is no doubt as to the facts about his financial position. Out of his proportion of the oil royalty vis Highness pays allowances to all those of the Khalifah who were not civil included in the original/list. He also pays a bonus of two months salary, twice yearly, on receipt of the oil royalty, to all persons on the civil list and pays every wear 40,000 to both Shaikh Mohamed and Shaikh ii.bdulj.d.* For some years he has paid a cost of living allowance of 30^ of salaries to all of the Khalifah who are in receipt of allowances. In addition His Highness gi^es away monies that over a year amount? to a large sum to innu merable people outside the family who as^c his financial help. The reputation which His Highness has acquired of being miserly is in fact one which is entirely un justified. lA His Highness’s share of the oil royalty is approxi mately 10 lakhs, out of this he makes the regular payments which I have enumerated above, they amount to about 3^ lakhs per annum. ^ Supplementary civil list, to cover pei oOiio not-3- i not included in the civil list and adjustments in various allowances^- Es 1,22,580 Half yearly oil bonus 1,58,200 Cost of Living Allowance 65 f 500 5,46,100 ^ His Highness f s own expenses have increased greatly since the war and he feels that while his family’s high cost of living has been partly compensated for by extra allowances no consideration has been given to his own situation. The extra allowances v/hifth his family receive are paid out of his own income which has therefore diminished while at the same time his expenses have risen. His Highness was unwilling to take any steps in this matter during the war but he now feels that something must be done. At the end of last month he had nothing to his credit in his bank account. ^ For many years during the rule of the late Shaikh Earned I opposed his desire to increase the civil list and I was eventually successful in trying it down to : ’_ts present size. At that time the position was different and the revenue was small in comparison to what it is today. For all these years I have been an opponent of increasing the payments to the Ruling Family, sometimes at the cost of much unpleasantness / but conditions have changed, it cannot be argued that the State is not wealthy and His Highness Shaikh Sulman is a very different person, where money matters are concerned, to his father. In my opinion His Highness has some cause for complaint, many of the payments to the family were instituted by his father and it would be difficult at present to put an end to them. His argument that his costs of living have increased is quite true and it is true that he helps the family to the extent of certainly not less than one third of his own income from the oil money. My suggestion is that the civil list-4- / list should be increased to 5 lakhs a year and that TTis Highness should be paid 4 lakhs to compensate him for the oxtra payments which he has been making to the family during the war. He has agreed that as soon as other cost of living allowances are lowered he will reduce or do away with the allowances to the Khalifah family. \ This matter is urgent, I have for several months been endeavouring to temporise but His Highness has informed me that something definite must be done before the end of Ramadhan, therefore I should be grateful for your views on the matter Captain H.D.H.Ranee, K. B. M T s political Agent, Bahrain.CONFIDiCIIIIAL . D.O. No.C/911, 18th August, 1946 Dear Belgrave, ^ Please refer to your. _ demi-official letter No. 1750-9A dated the 16th August, 1946. 2.

(\&lt; Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/910 dated the 17th August 1946. 2 . I have spoken to Belgrave about this case myself. I pointed out that Bapco production has recently increased from 20,000 to 23,000 a day which will mean a corresponding increase in the royalties and the Shaikh^ share of them. I suggested to Belgrave that if the Shaikh again approached him with a request for additional funds he should advise him to rest content with what he will shortly begin to receive in the way of increased royalties. 3. When Bapco's production still further increases and the cost of living falls we may have to consider the possibility of persuading the Shaikh to accept a smaller share of the royalties. Generally speaking however I am opposed to too rigid a control of Privy Purses in the Gulf Shaikhdoms and agree with the views expressed by my predecessor in his letter No. 172-S dated the 6th February 1945 a copy of which was forwarded to the Political Agent, Bahrain, under Printed Letter No.185-S dated the 8th February 1945.

The increases in the allowances of those on the Civil List require your approval, and I feel that they should not have been brought into effect in anticipation of the Bahrain Government (I understand it is -/12/- a day for worKing days only) and the increase in Dearness Allowance from 35f to 50t for persons drawing less than Rs.300/-p.m. are, in my view, justified. An increase in the wages paid to labourers was inevitable; and the Bahrain Government were having difficulty in recruiting and retaining any but the least employable clerks on their previous scales of pay. 4. The increases in the higher paid posts and in the allowances of those on the Civil List are also justified by the general increase in the wages of servants and in the cost of living generally that will result .from the Arabian American Oil Company’s action in increasing wages. 5. The additional purchasing power released by the Bahrain Government (and other employers will have to follow them) will increase the demand for goods already in short supply; and, with the increase in the cost of food, will aggravate the present inflation in Bahrain. It constitutes, therefore, an argument against undue relaxation of internal price controls: but the release of new purchasing power itself has been dictated by the action of the Arabian American Oil Company over which the Bahrain Government have no control. 6.

The total cost to the Government of this raise without the labour wages will be around Rs. 5,50,000/- per year. This does not include the Electricity Department and the Food Control Department because these departments pay their own revenue so the amount involved by the raise in dearness allowances will be met from the revenue of two departments.

C.Zb/f ^li . 2. Regarding the condition of^labourera and artisans in Bahrain I was of the opinio^'! vide paragraph 4 of my demi-official letter No.0/958, dated the 11th ::epter.bcr, 1947 - that the Bahrain Government saould endeavour to retain their artisans in their employment by paying reasonable wages and by endeavouring to provide - by good administration - attractive living conditions in Bahrain r^thor than by restricting emigration in search of more profitable employment. 3. You jrtll have seen from my demi-official letter Ko.c/939 dated the 1st October, 1947, that the Bahrain Government have now decided to Increase the wages of all their employees and that Smith estimates that this will cost the Bahrain Government an additional 5i lakhs a year excluding additional disbursement's by the electricity and Pood control Departments. 4. At the same time I have received fron the Acting Adviser a proposal to abolish price and export controls on all commodities other than those for which quotas are allotted from India, or for which foreign exchange is granted by the Agency. A copy of his letter is enclosed. 5. The increase in wages to oe made by the Bahrain Government - which will also have to be made by the Residency, the Agency, and other employers In Bahrain - will add considerably to the present excessive purchasing power which is already chasing Inadequate supplies of consumer goods; and, in spite of controls, will contri bute directly and Indirectly (through blacknarket opera tions) to the inflationary spiral in Bahrain. 6. While, therefore, I am in general sympathy with the desire of the merchant community for freedom from controls, t cannot Ignore the increase in the cost of living of labourers, artisans, and clerks which would occur if there were a sharp rise in the prices of essential and semi*essential commodities in Bahrain. To permit such a rise by the removal of price and export controls would discount the increases in wages now being made, and would considerably diminish the present favour able ratio between wages and the cost of living, upon /which The Hon*ole Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., political Resident In the Persian Gulf, Bahrain .which the Hahrain Government uni the companies here largely depend - or should depend - to retain their labour forces, 7. The merchants* argument that the removal of controls would Induce them to import goods more freely and in larger juantities, and would reduce prices through the effects of competition, is one thao can be supports by some examples, but many instances could be adduced to show that removal of controls has else where resulted in sharp rises in prices; because, however strong the merchants* desire freely to import large quantities of goods, many of the ;oods required here are just not available for export in sufficient quantities. For instance: there are a number of firms importing British textiles Into Bahrain and none can get more than occasional token shipments of goods. 8. T have therefore carefully gone through the details of the Bahrain Government*s proposal and have amended the current Order relaxing price controls on a large range of goods while retaining export controls and price controls on commodities which are essential to those in the lower income groups, and which are still in short supply. These changes meet most of the merchants' objections; and I have not gone further because I consider that the need to maintain stable prices for essential consumer goods (as a means of retaining the labour employed by the OH Company on which the btute depends) outweighs , \ the desirability of meeting In full the merchants* demand J : '''f. for freer trading. jZ is/i 9* I enclose for your information a copy of Order^yo.8 of 1947 which superseies Order No. 7 of 1947 sent to the Residency with Agency printed Letter Bo. 2314 dated the 12th of July, 1947. / Yours sincerely, 3d./- G.N.

I would also ask you to confirm the presumption that the present increase in the cost of living allowances or in the salaries themselves - whichever it may be -, together with the cost of living allowance of 30# on the Civil List salaries mentioned in the third paragraph of your letter No. 1750-9A dated the 15th'^ August, 1946, are being met from the Shaikh’s share of the Oil Royalties, which has now risen to Rs.13,00,000 per annum, and not from general revenues. Yours sincerely, °le Ih C.D. Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. D.O. No. 1 Adviaerate, October 29, 1947 'bc«A- With reference to your D.O. No.C/1054 dated 28th October 1947, on the subject of the Civil List increases. 2. The increases were made, during my absence, by His Highness f s orders. His Highness considered that this action was necessary owing to the fact that Bapco raised all wages by about one third. In the past it has been the custom for employers of laboufc to meet together in order to discuss matters such as this but I understand that there was no general discussion or agreement between the employers of lab out in Beth rain when this action was taken. 3. Regarding the questions in your letter; the increase of 20$ was made on the original salaries in the Civil List, the increase is not an increase of the basic salaries but it is an increase in the dearness allowance which in the case of the Civil List has now risen from 30$ to 50$ of the basic salaries. The dearness allowance is liable to be reduced or withdrawn as the cost of living decreases. 4. The increase of 30$ on Civil List salaries was made by His Highness some years ago and was paid by him out of the third of the oil royalty. His Highness has now increased the dearness allowance by 20$ and has ordered that all dearness allowance, i.e. 50$ of basic Civil List salaries, shall be paid not from the one third oil royalty bu^ ~ general revenue. 5. Our letter No. 2234-22 dated 20th September 1947, indicated this fact. In para 2 it stated that the total cost to the Government, not the total expenditure | from the third royalty, was about 5$ lakhs per annum. 6 . The first payment on the new scale was made last month. G.N. Jackson, Bsquire Jackson, Bsquire, M.B.E., H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Confidential.d. o. no. c/iofri POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN.

Indeed, he has stated that His Highness has now ordered that the whole dearness allowance at the rate of 50# of the Civil List salaries is to be paid from general revenues. The first payment at the new rate was made from them last month. ^ o 3. You will observe from the correspondence referred to by .■II-K In his letter No. c/910, dated une 17th August, • &gt; ( i !. 1946 - and particularly from prior’s demi-official letter No. 150-S dated the 13th February, 1943, and Weightuan's -f; ' demi-official letter No.C/757-10/1, dated the 7th October, 1940 - that this is a question that has for some years past considerably exercised former Political Agents, and Residents, and that a great deal of patient and sometimes unpleasant work has been done both to keep the Rulers’ privy purse within its present limits and to prepare the ground for an eventual reduction in the Ruler’s share of the Oil Royalties from the third that he at present enjoys. 4. It is apparent also that there are occasions in our dealings with the Rulers of Bahrain when some one has firmly to say ’No’ to the ever-recurring demands for increases in their share of the State's income; and, in my view, this occasion is one of them. By arbitrarily increasing the Civil List salaries at the expense of the State’s general revenues the Ruler has disregarded all the principles that have been established by much patient work over a period of years; and, if this is condoned now, the wliole basis of the present administration of Bahrain - which has been built up to certain standards by the expenditure of the major portion of the State's Income on the administration, rather than by allowing the Ruler to spend it on himself and the Al Khalifah - will be undermined. 2. I regret to have to say that Belgrave has not con- /There is a The Hon'ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bahrain.- 2 - There is a limit to the extent that Belgrave, who is the Shaikh's own servant, can check him in this respect; and the responsioility Tor doing so rests (as long as it is His Majesty's Gov eminent' s policy to concern themselves with the administration of the State in the interest of our defence and other commitments here) with the Political Agent, and, ultimately, with the Resident. • 5. Nor should we ignore, or omit to prepare for, the iact that some day the people of Bahrain may insist on taking an increasing share in the administration of the State. When public opinion develops and becomes more vocal - a condition that will result from education and increasing contacts with the outside world - it is likely to be directed against defects in the administration; against the personal affluence of the Ruler and the A1 Khalifah; and, by analogy, against us because we have per mitted these things. The facts that the Ruler's personal income exceeds some £120,000 a year, free of tax, and that, in addition, certain of his personal expenses and the allowances to his family are paid from the general revenues will not then be lost upon informed members of the public. Indeed, they are not now. Also, His tlajesty's Government have, I understand, already directed their Middle East Office to ?/ork for the wider distribution of wealth in the Arab world. Thus, any relaxation of our efforts to keep the Ruler's share of the State’s income within its present bounds, or any acquiescence in increases in the A1 Khalifah's allowances at the expense of the general revenues, would appear to be not only a retrograde rather than a forward step towards the emancipation of the people of Bahrain, but contrary to His Majesty's Government's recently formulated policy. 6« I would urge, therefore, that the Political Agent be authorised to inform the Ruler that His Majesty's Government are now, as in the past, strongly averse to the increased allowances on the Civil List salaries - which were sanctioned by the Ruler without consulting the Political Agent - being charged to general revenues; and that he should meet them from his share of the oil royalties, or from his own reserves.

Fcufinstance Belgrave in his demi-official letter No.l750-9A dated the 15th August, 1946, tries to make out that the Shaikh really cannot afford to pay the allowance from this source. Can we counter Belgrave’s arguments ? 4. My view at present is that the grant of dearness allowance at 50$ on Civil List salaries is reasonable under present conditions and that it is only the source from which it should be paid that is in issue. If you do not agree with this view you will no doubt let me know. 2 .

No.C/341- l.b/7 dated 17th August, 1933). Beyond this letter no formal undertaking was given by him but the convention was well estab lished by 1935 vide Sir. Trenchard Fowled letter No.lQlB-S dated 20th December 1935 (copy sent to Bahrain under P.L. No.1019-S dated 20th December, 1935), and has been referred to in subsequent correspondence with the Ruler. In 1940 the Political Agent, Mr. Weightman, discussed (D.O. No.0/757-10/1 dated 7th October, 1940) with Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Sslman the desirability of reducing the Shaikh 1 s 1/3 share tg l/5th or less but no conclusion was arrived at. t U t' 1 ' &gt; In his demi official letter No.C/77-4/1, dated the 16th February 1936 to the Adviser Colonel Loch, the Political Agent intimated that the intention underlying an earlier letter of 1934 to the Shaikh was that no further increase should be made in the Civil List and that r^y new allowances to the A1 Khalifah family should be met from the l/3rd of the royalties allotted to the Ruler. This was apparently acquiesced in at ^ the time - x In 1941 Shaikh Hamad wrote (vide his letter dated 13th Safar 1360 to the Adviser) desiring to help himself to 2 lakhs from the 1/3 royalty credited to State general revenues (the remaining 1/3 being credited to the Reserve Fund), 1 lakh to me^t the cost of entertaining and 1 lakh to supplement the allowances to the A1 Khalifah family. In his reply N0.183-S, dated the 10th April 1941' (copy sent to Bahrain under P.L. No.187-S dated 10th April, 1941) the Political Resident, Sir Geoffrey Prior, informed the Shaikh (paragraph 6) that he had always thought that the 1/3 share enjoyed by His Highness was excessive and was about to ask His Highness if he could see his way to reduce it; also (paragraph 7) that he hoped that if His Highness wished to increase the emoluments of the A1 Khalifah h he hoped that His Highness would do it from the l/3rd of the royalties enjoyed by His Highness or the amount' His Highness spent on bedouin. In his reply dated the 8th Rabi-al-Thani 1360, Shaikh Hamad appreciated the Political Residents advice but Merely agreed that the State reserve should not be touched. No undertaking was given by Shaikh Hamad or has been given by Shaikh Salman that post-1934 increases in the allowances of the A1 Khalifah family would be met from the Ruler f s 1/3 share of royalties, and the latter’s action summarised in S.No.55 (P.R’s demi official letter No.l783-S dated 13th October, 1947, to Ivir.

Dear Sir Rupert, please refer to the correspondence ending v/ith your demi-official letter No. 2022-s, dated the 26th November, 1947. on the subject of the Bahrain Civil List. 2. X have had several conversations with Relgrave on the subject, and he is quite as disturbed as we are by the Shaikh’s action and, indeed, before I had read the papers, he asked me what we were going to do about it. He said, and I believe him, that this would never have happened if he had been here. He explained that what has actually happened is that ^he Shaikh has increased the Civil List from Rs.4,20.000 to Rs.6,30,000. in round figures this two lakhs' increase which Jie budge- ha s to bear is made up of (a) 1 lakh which the Shaikh formerly paid himself from his share of the oil royalty (b) 1 lakh increases in the cost of living allowance. Belgrave agreed with me that whatever excuse there migiit be for adding (b) to the State budget, there is none whatsoever for similar action in respect of (a). It seems to me largely academic to argue as to whether -here was a ‘’principl* that increases in whe cost of living allowances of the Al Khalifah should be met from the Ruler’s 1/3 share of the royalties. But 1&lt;- is clear from past correspondence that we were consulted, expected to be consulted, gave advice, and that the advice was taken in questions concerning Bahrain government finances, andespecially in those concerning the allowances of the Ruler and Lis family. The Shaikh has now flouted our authority as exercised in the past in this way; it seems to me in keeping with this attitude as described in ray demi-official letter ’o.C/619, dated the 24th of Ff ay, 1947, though whether one regards this as ”deterioration n In the local position is, I suppose, largely a matter of a point of view. / 3. X am...... The Hon’ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.H., C.S.I., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.3. I arf rather at a loss for any suggestion as to what we should do. The changes were made nearly three months ago and a protest at that range will have little effect. The fact too that, as I understand, the Shaikh's orders have, of course, been acted upon since he passed uhem makes it exceedingly difficult if not impossible for him to change them, even if we should ever persuade him to consider doing so. Still, as I anticipate similar moves in future, it will be better to protest against this one. Such a protest might, I suggest, take the form of a letter from you in which a chief point should be that out of a revenue of 86,00,000 per annum, 19,00,000 (12 lakhs oil royalty and 6 lakhs Civil List) go to the A1 fhalifah. 4. I am inclined to agree with your view tha* an allowance at 6C per cent on Civil List salaries is reasonable in present conditions. ?vly view that we have not heard the last of such increases is based on the fact that, as emphasized by Jackson in his demi-official letter o.C/99G, dated the 2nd October, 1947, the f *inflationary spiral” has, after our successful avoidance of it during the war, at last appeared in Bahrain.

I note that Belgrave has agreed that there is no excuse whatever for the Shaikh’s decision that the one lakh contribution which he previously paid to the Civil List from his share of the oil royalty should noto be paid from general revenues. Belgrave is the Shaikh’s financial Adviser and it is for him to point out to the ShaiKh in the first place the impropriety of his action. It is not clear whether he has done this or not. If he has not, would you kindly suggest to him, if you see no objection, that he should take action on these lines now and let you know the result. 3 . My own view is Inclined to be that as the Shaikh’s share of the royalty has increased from 10 lakhs to over 11 lakhs he should contribute not only the lakh which he previous ly paid but also the further lakh required to cover the recent increases in cost of living allowance. I am still however at a loss to know how the Shaikh expends his very large share of the royalty.

Dear Belgrave, You may remember that about a .fortnight ago we discussed the increases made by His lighness in the Civil List. You explained to me that what has actually happened is that the Shaikh has increased the Civil List (in roun 1 figures) from over four lakhs to over six lakhs, i.e. by two lakhs made up of (a) 1 lakh which the Shaikh formerly paid himself from his share of the oil royalty, and (b) 1 lakh increases in the cost of living allowance these two lakhs being now charged on the State budget.

These figures account for about 5 ^ lakhs per annum, but there remains a balance of the present oil royalty (13 lakhs) of lakhs. Can you giv me up-to-date figures indicating how this is spent?

No. Adviserate, February 12, 1948. P.eforring to your No. c/lo3 dated 25th January c* ^' 1948, I had a long talk with His Highness on the subject of the Civil List and the increases and changes which were made while I was away. His Highness did not appreciate my bringing up the subject and would not budge an inch. He produced the following arguments. 2. (a) The increases were made with the knowledge of Galloway who, ho said, was aware of all that was done. He also said that a letter was written to the Political Agent by the Acting Adviser, Smith, in which it was clearly stated that some payments previously made by His Highness were to be met from State funds not from the Privy Purse. I have seen the letter and the wording of it is perhaps liable to cause a misunderstanding though if the letter is studied carefully the fact emerges that payments / made by His Highness were to be met in future by the State. (b) The arrangement about oil royalties, made when Loch was Political Agent, was discussed in the presence of Loch, Shaikhs Mohamed, Abdulla and Shaikh Sulman and myself and it was agreed that 1/3 of the royalty was to be paid to the Ruler and one third was 2/— Confidential'0 - 2 - to be for the Ruling Family, the other third was to be spent on the State. I told His Highness that this was incorrect. He continued to say that the original arrangement was as he stated. (c) If he is the Ruler of Bahrain he has the right to allocate the revenue to whatever purpose he wishes, if he is restricted in financial matters he is not the real ruler of the State but merely the chief of the Khalifah Family with control over one third of the oil royalty. This, he regards, as an impossible position. 3. His Highness appeared to be willing to discuss the matter with you and the Resident, he said that the matter should either be discussed or should be the subject of an exchange of letters. He also saic that if in future he had not a free hand with the revenue he would refuse to approve and sign any 7 budget. He also mentioned that in other States in the Gulf the Rulers were not questioned about the manner in which they disposed of the revenue, he quoted Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, 4. Our talk lasted for over two hours and His Highness was extremely angry. I think that this matter should be discussed as soon as possible but that before any discussion takes place the records which you have regarding the disposal of the oil royalty should be looked into, I am quite certain, as I told His Highness, that it was agreed that the Ruler should receive one third of the royalty 3 /—and that two thirds should be utilised on the State. Another point which he stressed was that the Civil List should depend upon the revenue of the State, other than the oil royalty. Before oil produced any revenue the State had a maximum income of 13 lakhs per annum, now it has an income of twice this amount so therefore, he contended, the Civil List should be allowed to increase, in proportion to the revenue (other than from oil).

Dear Sir Rupert, nelosed Is a copy of Bolgrave’s ic’uUcr No*758-22/9A dated the 12th February, 1948, which is the result of my speaking to him about the Bahrain Civil List increases as you asked me v/O do in your demi-official letter No.136-3 dated the 20th January, 1948. 2. My comments on His Highness’s ’’arguments” are as follows:- £ f/ T have no record, of the Shaikh having refer red to G&amp;llo'vay, and presumably you have none. The letter written by smith to which helgrave refers was presumably the enclosure to Jackson’s demi-official letter HO.C/S39 dated the 1st October, 1947, to Galloway. The letter was far from clear on the question of the incidence of the increases sanctioned by the Shaikh, and it would have needed a clairvoynt to discover that as well as sanctioning cosu of living allowance the Shaikh was going to charge a lac to the Soate budget which he formerly paid himself. 3. The argument^ at (b) contradicts by implication chat at (a), i*e. if the arrangement about oil royalties was as stated by the Shaikh then where was no necessity to refer to the political Agent. I don’t want to add to the considerable noting and correspondence on this point, but ' eightman’s view of it as late as 1940 (vide ^ * his demi-official letter No.C/285-4/1 dated the 6 th April, 1940, to prior - paragraph 4) is interesting .—J £ /&lt;f ■ A. 4. As to argument (c) the poin&lt;-, i thixm, is as made in paragraph 2 of my letter tfo.C/ilDl dated the 14th December, 1947. We have been consulted in the past and past precedent in the matter should be acted upon. The correspondence about the allowance for Shaikh Da’ij (Political Agent’s le-ier NO.C/4X3-4/1 dated th® 21st April, 1934, to the Kon’ble the poliuical Resident refers) is a remarkaole instance of the extent to which vre ’ere consulted. 5 . I propose, if you agree, to discuss the ohaikh’s action with him to counter his arguments in the manner /in iicated The Hon’ble L*--Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C»1*F., C.S.X., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.indicated above, and 10 point ouo 10 him that our advice to him regarding his personal expenditure is in his own interest since the time has come when it is no longer free from public criticism. His threat about refusing to sign *he budget as mentioned by fcelgrave in paragraph 3 of his letter is, I think, only one of his usual histrionic efforts. If he mentions Kuwait to me, I imagine that the reply is that the finances need controlling though naturally I would not venture to give it. .’he comparison to d^udi Arabia is inappropriate and ridiculous. yours sincerely,CONFIDENTIAL D.Q.N0.638-S PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY Dated the 23rd March, 1948 Please refer to your Demi-official letter No.C/277 dated the 17th March, 1948 about the Bahrain Civil List. 2 . I fully approve the line you propose to take. I suggest that you should lay emphasis on modern democratic tendencies and the scandal that will be caused in the world at large when the very large proportion of the State revenues (including oil royalties) which is devoted to the Al-Khalifah becomes knov/n especially as most of them give no return what ever for the expenditure. 3. If the Shaikh mentions Kuwait you can say, with truth, that so far as we are aware the Shaikh is reserving the whole / of the oil royalties for local developments. 4. You will no doubt realise that this is not a matter in which we can give anything in the nature of an 'order' to the Shaikh. Your general attitude should be that you are offering him adviee for his own good and that of his State. ^fou can if necessary remind him of what he owes to His Majesty's Government's protection and refer to the displeasure likely to be felt by His Majesty's Government when the matter is reported to them. 5. With reference to paragraph 2 of your letter we have no record of any reference to Galloway. I think it quite probable that the Shaikh may have mentioned to him his proposal to increase his Civil List dearness allowances in general terms but most unlikely that he made specific reference to the transfer of liability for a portion of these allowances from his share of the oil royalties to general revenues.

N0.638-S, dated the 23rd March, 1948, with the Shaikh yesterday. 2. I tried to make the point that it is not the Shaikh’s expenditure on his family that we are questioning, but the incidence of that expenditure on the State Budget. As usual, the Shaikh avoided the real issue by saying that he had to increase the allowances because prices have gone much higher - a proposition which it was impossible to contradict* He went over (for about an hour) more or less the points he made to Belgrave, though he did not say that the increases were made with the knowledge of Galloway. When he mentioned Kuwait, I said that Kuwait ought to take Bahrain as an example, and he should net argue that Bahrain should follow Kuwait’s example - he avoided this argument. I then told him that the light of publicity shone upon Bahrain and there was bound to be public criticism if a dis proportionate amount ofthe'State*» income is spent on the Al-Khalifah. He said that he only disposed of one-third of the royalties and that the other two-thirds are devoted to State purposes. This is important. He did not argue that one-third of the royalties should be paid to the Ruler and one-third to the Ruling Family. I hope that if he contemplates a further move of this kind that he will refer to us in future; and at this late stage that is all we can hope for.

'f * t Dear Sir Rupert, I have just heard that the Shaikh has raised the allowances to the A1 Khalifah by Rs.2,SO,000/- per annum. His uncles are to get Rs.2,000/- per month, brothers and cousins Rs.1,000/- per month and the rest an increase of Rs.4,000/- per month divided amongst them. This will probably have repercussions, the chief being a demand from all Bahrain Government employees for increases which will doubtless react on employees in businesses and possibly on those in the oil company. 2. I do not know yet whether the Shaikh proposes to pay for these increases himself though, of course, I suspect not. He has, however, just approved the budget in which no allowance is made for these extras. Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.S.O.No.C/L-26 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 13tb January, 1949 Dear Belgrave, Thank you for your personal note dated the 2?nd December, 1948, telling me about the increased allowances made to the A1 Khalifah by H.H.

No. » -SS/t A ““ His Highness has recently ordered the payment from State funds of Rs.80l/- per month, an adjustment in the salaries in the Civil List of a number of persons in the family who were receiving very small monthly salaries and also a payment totalling Rs.600/- per month, from State funds, to four young men of the family who have lately married, one of them being his own son Isa. 2 . There are at present a number of young men of the Ruling Family who will shortly be married. It is the custom of the family that until they marry their fathers support them but after they marry they receive an allowance from the Civil List. 3. I have talked to His Highness about these increases to the Civil List on several occasions, his view is that new allowances such as these should be paid by the State. The fact that married members of the Khalifah family automatically come onto the Civil List is an incentive to early marriage and I think it is likely that during the next few months several more near relations of His Highness will marry and His Highness will give orders for allowances to be paid to them. 4. In view of a conversation which I had with Burrows when he was here, about the feeling at home that the rulers of oil States were getting too large a proportion of the oil royalties and, in some cases, not spending 2 /— L-/2S- 3*7 &gt;9 U?./ - 2 - enough on the countries, I think the question of the Civil List should be considered. It is an extremely difficult matter to deal with but if nothing is done I foresee considerable additions to it in the near future.CONFIDENTIAL . S.0,No.C/R-228. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 31st May, 1949. Dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to the corresponden ending with my semi-official letter No.C/R-27, Belgrave which is self-explanatory. Before taking up the question with the Shaikh I should like to know if there is any control exercised on the allowances to the Al-Sutah or on the disposal of the oil revenues in Kuwait. The Shaikh is almost certain to compare his own position with that of Shaikh Ahmad who, as you know, is here now.

I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Galloway about the Kuwait Civil List. It will be seen that the expenditure in Kuwait on this account is much smaller than it is in Bahrain. Further, so far as I know, no portion of the oil revenues has been set aside for the Shaikh personally nor for mem bers of his family. Up to date we have not exercised any control over the allowances to the Subah nor over the disposal of the oil revenues, though I think it is likely that sooner or later we shall offer advice to the Shaikh on the latter subject. 3. The constant increases in the Bahrain Civil List are to be strongly deprecated. No reductions ever seem to be reported on account of deaths. Why is this? I think we shall have to take up the matter with the Shaikh in due course and suggest to him that some, at any rate of the junior branches of the A1 Khalifah should learn to make their own living and not depend on allowances, but the matter will, I think, have to await Belgrave^ return from leave.

(b) How many are in the Civil List?

Confidential D.C* N0.1377-2A Advisenate, March 23, 1950 V \ / With reference to your No 9 C/L-110 dated 22nd March 1950, the Civil List in Bahrain amounts to its. 6,43,000 per annum. His Highness, as you know, receives one third of the oil royalty but he dist ributes about 34$ of this amount to his relations in monthly and bi-annual payments. 2. The Civil List consists of 168 men and women. 3. His Highness gives small allowances to about 164 Bedouins. Many of these allowances came into being when the Bahrain Arabs left Zubara. Whether or not the payments will be continued now, I cannot say. In the past the payments to Bedouin were probably very considerable but when the State organised a regular Police Force, originally a Levy Corps, it was considered unnecessary to sub sidise Bedouin tribes.

The Shaikh was paying Al,Khalifah Rs.1,33,663 a year in monthly payments in 1942, and around Rs.1,19,954 a year ( the estimate is on the generous side) in six monthly instalments from his portion of the oil royalty, vide page 137 of 4/l-iv. This gives us a total of Rs. 2,53,622 spent on the Al Khalifah. Stretching our conception of Shaikh Salman’s generosity we may allow an increase of Rs.2,50,000 in these payments between 1942 and 1945, bringing them up to 5,00,000 a year. To meet this the Shaikh received annually from-the Civil List and the• oil royalty an average of Rs. 13,20,000 a year. Other sources of the.Shaikh’s income are given in Mr Belgrave’s lett er at page 176a of file 4/l-iii. Many of them have considerably appreciated during the war and K.H’s investments are now reported to bring him in between Rs. 120,000 and 150,000 a year. Sef’H.M’s Note dated 6/3/46 submitted below. The Shaikh has also certain expenses to meet and a rough idea of them is given .by the payments shown at page 132 of file 4/l-iii. In roungl figures the Shaikh seems to be meeting a total expenditure of Rs.10,00,000 a year from a total income of Rs. 14,00,000 a year. It is not understood therefore how he could possibly be short of- money as he is reputed to be exceedingly parsimonious and very niggardly in Ms rewards* It is nrobably truer to say the Shaikh is anxious to reimburse himself for every penny he has given the Al Khalifah from the l/3 share of the oil royalty and that his proposal to pay them dearness allowance arises from his desire to avoid continuing remittances to them from the oil money. It is for consideratinn whether we are prepared to accept this view,, and to regard, the l/3 share of the oil v oyol as being paid into the Ruler’s privy purse. In this connection please see correspondence at page 177 seq, 215 217 and 235 of 4/l-iii. If the Ruler is to differentiate between himself and the Al Khalifah in this way and hold that he alone should spend any part of the very large sum M receives from th oil royalty he may be met with trie proposal that we reduce his share of the oil royalty to a fifth or even a tenth. Regarding the dearness allowance Shaikh , Salman proposes to pay the Al Khalifah the following comments may be made: Those members of the Al Khalifah employed by .by the Bahrain Government, vide page 131 of 4/l-iv are already paid desrness allowance. (b) Shaikh Mohammed and shaikh Abdullah, the uncles of H.H., receive l/3 of all monies paid*the A1 Khalifah and would doubtless receive a corresponding dearness allowance. They are however in receipt of' very comfortable private incomes from their properties and investments, vide H.M* s Note below* • ' (c) If the Al Khalifah are unable to subsist without a dearness allowance at a time when the civil list ( and the oil royalty) have been greatly increased how will they be able to subsist fcktn the revenue from oil begins to fall ? It is surely not intended that the State should continue to Subsidize the Al Khalifah up to their present standard of living despite reductions in State revenue. Along with these arguments we may point out to Shaikh that oil production is increasing, vide S.90 of 10/8, the oil field is good for another 40 years, vide 3.36 of3V 7 and that he should soon be able to make up any deficit he feels he has suffered in his personal fortune. We may also point out that any attack by him on the State’s revenueC and reserve) will seriously interfere with the Bahrain rehabilitation scher^ which*are now at last in hand, and comment unfavourably on the fact that after cutting down expenditure on education by withdrawing the Bahrain students from Kgypt he has no qualms in saddling the State with his own debts. We may go on to remind him of the unfavourable comment, both local and foreign, his proposals v/ill arouse if put into practice, referring him in this connection to the extract--from the Al ^aida pamphlet that we sent the Adviser, vide S.-16 of 4/7. -and if H.K. really is short of money we may suggest that the State lends him money but on the condition that he repays it at the beg ginning of’ the next financial year* as was the practice of his father, Shaikh Hamad. • , , - . ltd.

No. 2499-22 dated the 29/10/47 from Adviser, B.G. Please see previous correspondence on this // file, especially our demi-official letter to P.R. at -&gt;.2 and noting under S.l. We have now to determine whether (a) those / members of Al Khalifah who.receive civil list payments a r *0 entitled to c a 50 ^dekrtiesS allowance on‘those -avraents and (b) whether,.this .dearness allowance is to be met from the Shaikh's 1 0/3 share of the oil royalty or - from 'eneral revenues. Vi/e have not worried very much hitherto about the need for paying Al Khalifah dearness q^ fowances because we have assumed that tne Shaikh should meet these allowances from his l/3 share of the oil royalty as he did from 1942 onwards, but if the Bahrain Government emnlovees are to be paid a 50 % deames^ allov/ance then Presumably Al Khalifah are also entitled to the same dearness allowance and , prima facie, if the Civil uist is chargeable to general revenues, dearness allowance on Civ il List payments should alsosbe chargeable to general •revenues. Further justification for this view is* provided by the fact that the Adviser has made it clear that the increases made are only in dearness allowances an d not in basic payments made to Al Khalifah on the Civil List, and by the fact that the dearness allowance of the Bahrain Government employees is paid from general revenues. In fact, from this point of view, the^ Shaikh was acting magnanimously in meeting the original^ dearness allowance payments from his 1/3 share of the oil royalty and within his rights in ultimately having these payments charged to general revenues. It is only to be regretted that we allowed him to make one change in so 'highrhanded a manner. If this view is accepted we should see to it that no unauthorised increase is made in the original Civil List, c.f. para 3 of S.3.and we may ask Adviser for the names of those Al Khalifah who are now to^ be supported from the Civil List and the amouhts in oivil List raiments and dearness allowance that individually and collectively they are going to cost the State.* in this connection it should be pointed out that the present budgeting chaos lends itself to further unauthorised deductions from general revenue, and that we reminded the Adviser to send us his revised budget estimates for • 'Z1366JJr* /i/z/Vf? When the Shaikh's proposals first came before the P.H. in 1946, vide s.l, they involved Ca) the reimbursement to the Shaikh from State Funds of a sum of 4 or 6 lakhs of rupees which he claimed he had paid in additional allowances to A1 Khalifah over a number of years, and Cb) an increase of about Ps. 60,000 in the Civil List in dearness allowances. Col. Calloway and P.H., vide s. 8 - 10, eventually agreed to let the Shaikh appropriate a sum of Rs. 4 lakhs from State Funds. We did not however agree to the increased dearness allowances, and the matter was taken up with the Adviser, vide s. 13 - 16, on receipt of Mr. Smith's memo - presumably this is the letter to which the Adviser refers - forming enclosure to s.ll. If the Shaikh's proposals are to be taken seriously they would entail the following. a) i share of oil royalty to go to the Shaikh. There is a steady increase at present in the amount of oil royalty paid by Bapco. b) i share of oil royalty to go to A1 Khalifah. c) 3 share of oil royalty to go to Bahrain Govt. d) All Civil List Payments (and dearness allowance) to be made from State Revenues. e) The Civil List Payments to increase with the increase in general revenue excluding the oil royalty. f) The Shaikh to have absolute power to allocate State Revenue to any purpose (or persons) he wishes. In 1933 it was proposed to Shaikh Hamad that the oil royalty should be divided in the proportion of t to the Ruler and $ to the State. He seemed to have welcomed the suggestion, vide page 136 of lO/l-II, to have mentioned it in negotiations with Bapco, vide page 146 ibid, and to have stated to Col. Loch in the presence of the Adviser and Shaikhs Mohd., Abdullah, and Salman that he would adopt it. This was however only a verbal agreement, and Shaikh Salman is not the first to have come round to the view that the Ruler and A1 Khalifah were each to receive $ of the oil royalty, vide page 4 of 4/l-IV. The principle was first put into force in the State Budget for 1363, vide page 78 of 4/1-1, and though no actual convention was signed, vide pages 86 and 86 ibid and page 4 of 4/l-IH, it continued to be adopted for the Budget for the following year, vide page 94 of 4/l-I, and later Budgets. The principle has also formed the subject of correspondence between the Ruler and the P.A. and P.R. It was mentioned inter alia in Col. Loch's letter to Shaikh Hamad at page 36 of 3l/8 (please see in this connection page 33 seq ibid). The Shaikh's reply at page 43 we have only in the English translation. Mr. Belgrave's comments on this letter are at page 48 ibid.
