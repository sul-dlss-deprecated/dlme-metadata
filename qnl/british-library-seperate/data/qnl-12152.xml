In particular, the volume's papers contain instructions from the Government of India to the Political Agency in Muscat on the precise parameters of wartime censorship in multiple languages, including Arabic. This includes information on sailing dates of British shipping, the surveillance of the letters of Germen citizens, and the removal of all mention of British naval movements from telegrams and written communication. Other aspects of the regime of censorship instituted at the beginning of the war include the elimination of languages other than English, Arabic, and Guajarati from all communication with the Political Agency in Muscat and the treatment of undesirable printed material from overseas.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Censorship</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000f6#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000f6#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000f6#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
