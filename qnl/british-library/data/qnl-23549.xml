The Qpdis have now written to H. E. Shaikh Hamad asking that he^should instruct his courts to recognise the ohera rulings in tnis matter. Incidentally ohaikh Abdul Latif bin Saad assured me lately that the Agency Court always accepted the view that property of ex slaves dying intestate^should revert to their former owners or to the heirs oi tneir former owners. My own opinion is that although such a rule is correct according to the ohera Law. it should not be enforced by the State Courts, of which the bhera Court is one.

The five slaves are entirely destitute and have been sent from Shargah at the expense of His Majesty's Government to ensure their safety. I would be glad,therefore,if the passport fees could be waived since they'would fall on His Majesty T s Government. Equally if the launch was specially hired to bring these slaves to Bahrain I would be glad if the Bahrain Government would waive the Port dues. If,however,the Nekhuda brought other passengers and cargo and these slaves merely formed a portion oi his loi he should clearly pay the full amount to which a foreign launch is liable.

( Copy to The Political Agent, Bahrein.) — REFUGEE SLAVES FROM SHARJAH Sir, I have the,honour to report, on the occasion of the visit of H#M.S. 'HASTINGS' to British Basnidu on the 30th March, v /ith H.B.M. Consul for Bander Ahhas on board, I observed on the beach a small 'Bagarrah' of the type peculiar to the Tracial Coast, and on enquiring into the reason for its presence there found that five Negro Slaves, Refugees from Sharjah, had arrived in this boat eight days before (22nd March). 2. The boat is the property of one Salem Bin Sultan Hamur of Sharjah as is also the apparent leader of the runaway Slaves. It appears that the Slaves left Sharjah by night v/ith the intention of reporting themselves on board H.M. Ship at Henjam, but were carried out of their course by the v/eather and made Bashidu instead. 3. After interrogating the five refugees, summaries of whose statements are attached I have embarked them in H.M.S. 'HASTINGS' pending instructions as to where they should be discharged when granted Manumission. I have placed the stolen 'Bagarrah' under the charge of the care-taker (Moyn) at Bashidu and propose informing the owner of its whereabouts on my next visit to Sharjah (Snd April).
