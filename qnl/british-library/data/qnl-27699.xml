No.C.317-14/1. From R.l. Hallows, Esquire, Political A(»ent, MUSCAT. POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, Dated 13th April 1946. The Hon’ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E. Sir, ku 'y* 6 C M - ^ 1 have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with India Office telegram No. 6957, dated the 5th April, 1946, on the subject of the exploration of Muscat territory by P.C.L. and to say that Mr. Baker, the Company's chief geologist, and Mr. Lermitte of their Bahrain office, arrived at Muscat on the 10th for discussions with His Highness. 2. The object of their visit was to ascertain from His Highness the areas to which surface parties could be given access. Both had hoped that the political conditions in the Interior would have improved sufficiently to permit some pe netration of Oman. Apart from the coastal strip, His Highness was, however, only able to agree to the exploration of parte of the Dhahirah area, the Balad Beni Bu Ali and territories south and west of it, and the province of Dhofar. The Sultan also agreed to flights being made over the whole of his terri tories provided, in the case of the interior, that air craft flew reasonably high (i.e. beyond the range of a rifle). 3. Mr. Baker informed His Highness that for the 1946-47 season, he would consider recommending to his company geo logical work in the province of Dhofar by a land party and, If experiments with new instruments for use in aircraft proved successful, the geophysical examination of parts of the in terior from the air. Mr. Baker did not rule out the pos sibility of a surface party being sent to the Batinah coast, but pointed out that such an examination could not be expected to yield much in the way of results as the party would be unable to proceed far enough inland to observe the stratigraphy of the foot-hills. 4» I may mention here that Mr. Baker appeared to consider that from the information at his disposal, the chances of find ing oil in either of the two concession areas were far from good, and on one occasion expressed the view that it might not be • •••••. / 2 - 2 - not be in His Highness* interest for the company to accelerate the assessment of the value of their con cessions. In view, however, of the very limited explo ration which the company lu-s so far been able to under take, I find it difficult to take this statement seriously. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, I Political Agent, Muscat.

P.C.L. activities in Muscat. ^ |( ^ v ) There is no one more anxious to see Muscat's oil resources developed than Sultan himself. In circumstances which have been fully described in my letter No.S 1126 of 19th August, 1945 it is obviously impossible for him to give access to P.C.L. parties to ohe territories under Imam. In these territories he can him self make no arrangements for security of parties and could only permit oil company to negotiate direct with Imam. This, besides recognising the authority of the Imam, would enormously increase his prestige at a moment when Sultan is most anxious to avoid this. • Tn my view, only method of giving oil company access to the interior is to make available to Sultan assistance he Cku 8iv) requires to enable him to consolidate his authority throughout his territories.

LEilTED, My dear Donaldson, I refer to your letter of 8th April and to the meeting at which you were good enough to receive us on 30th April. fir. Baker, our Chief Geologist, and Mr. Lermitte, Deputy Manager on the Persian Gulf, visited the Sultan of Muscat at his capital in the second week of April, with the results which we detailed to you verbally at our meeting; in effect, the Sultan was unable to promise us access to any major part of those areas of his nominal territory which chiefly interest us from the oil point of view. Indeed, he seemed to make even humbler claims, as regards the extent of his own effective sway, than he made in 1937/38. The exploration programme which the Company would wish to carry out, beginning in the autumn of this year, is as follows: £ c 4 (1.) Geological ground examinations of a) Khabura to Yanqul, Dhank and Ibri b) Jabal Akhdhar c) Muscat to Izki through Wadi Samail d) The coast near Ras Abu Daud to Ibra (not Ibri) via Wadis Tayin and Khabbah e) Sur to Wadi Batha via Wadi Falaij f; Wadi Batha area from Jumaila (Ghina) to Ibra g) The west forefront of the Oman Range from the coast south of Ras al Hadd up to Jabal Hafit //u\h) In addition to the foregoing we would carry out ground surveys to whatever extent the geology warrants over areas from Dhofar along the coast to the northeast. (2) Geophysical Surveys by land 'Uid/or, if. practicable, by air over a) The v/est forefront of the Oman Range from the coast south of Has al Hadd to the Persian Gulf b) The coast and hinterland between Has al Hadd and Dhofar to whatever extent geophysical results of reconnaissance flights would indicate. c) The Batinah Coast between Muscat and Sohar. We should be very glad to have your comments and those of the Political Resident on the feasibility of this programme at the date suggested. If, as I hope, we shall receive from Bahrain a report on the non-technical aspects of our officials’ visit to Muscat, I will let you have it. Yours sincerely, (Sg3.)

Note of a Meeting at the India Office on 30th A pril, 1946^ The following were present:- . _ _ , Ivir. Donaldson m the Chair Mr, Harrison * India Office Brig. Longrigg) Mr .Wheatley ) P.C.L. Mr. Baker ) Ivlr. Stock and Mr. Goss.. M.F.P. 2. Mr. Baker gave a brief account of the discussions which^he^ 31 ^_^ Mr. Lermitte had with the Sultan of Muscat on April 10th to 13th last. He had, with the Sultan, gone over a map of the whole area and indicated the areas in which P.C.L. were interested. The discussion was not at all promising from the P.C.L. point of view, and the bultan had not gone as far even as he did in 1937 in promising the Company access to the areas in the interior which they desired to survey. He could only promise them access on the ground up to a line about 20 kilometres from the coast, as far south-east as Ras A1 Hadd, and from there south-west a strip of about 30 kilometres from the coast. . The Company were interested in the oil prospects of the whole wide hinterland south-west of the Oman range. In order for them to assess the prospects of this area it was desirable for them to examine the formations of the range itself (particularly the western face) but the Sultan could not promise them safe access to this. It would be of assistance to the Company in determining the areas in which they were most interested it they could carry out an aerial survey of the west side of the Oman Range and of the hinterland area with an aircraft fitted with a magnetometer (which they hope to be able to obtain shortly from the U.S.A.). The Sultan had indicated that this would be possible, though he said that the aircraft should fly high. Mr. Baker had had a long talk the Political Agent before he left, and recounted to him his discussions with the Sultan. 3. Discussion followed about the possibility of assisting the Company to obtain access to the interior. There were obviously strong objections to any approach to local chiefs by the Company’s representatives direct, but it was suggested that a visit to 3 o Qo localities by the Political igent accompanied by a representative of the Company might e of some assistance in preparing the ground. It was, however, agreed that it was desirable to await the comments of the local political authorities in the first instance. 4. As regards the Trucial Coast area, Mr. Baker said that the Company's party had last winter done some useful work in the Jebel Faiyah area, and established themselves at Baraimi. There was more that they cou ^ a usofully do in this area next season. They had, however, encountered . a certain amount of opposition from the tribesmen, and on one occasion their party had been fired upon. 3. It was agreed that the Company should let the India 01fice have a statement of their present requirements so that the comments of the Political Resident could be obtained on what could best be done to help them. The Company wished to be in a position to draw up their future programme as soon as possible, / 6 .m 6. Mr. V/hcatley mentioned as a separate point that ho understood that certain representatives of the Koweit Oil Company had recently arrived in Koweit with the intention of discussing the Koweit-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone with the Sheikh. He mentioned P.C.L's interest in this area and enquired what the Sheikh’s present attitude was. He was informed in reply that, before the arrival of these members of the Kov/eit Oil Company in Koweit, the Sheikh had informed the Political Agent that he did not intend to enter into negotiations on the Neutral Zone, and that we had heard nothing since. The India Office assured the Company that their interest in this area was appreciated, and would be kept fully in mind.Repeated Crovemraen No. T/202.

This must be accepted, but are, as you know, anxious to do what they can to help your Company in the early development of Muscat’s oil resources.

If anything comes of this we will of course let you know. Meanwhile there appears to be no objection to your Company carrying out next season the aerial surveys to which you refer in (2) of your third paragraph.

Fotroleun Gompalty, Lainited, Ling House, Dominion Street, London, £« C« 2« 17th October, 1946. My dear Donaldson, We spoke at our recent meeting at the India Office of exploration in Oman, and it appeared that the Sultan lia ^ oomnunioated to the Political Resident a ratoer more optijnistio yiew of his abUitiea as 'opeaer^up' of territory to our exploration than he did to our representatives a fee months ago. This was, of oourse, welcome news and it remains to be seen how far we oan utilise the new position - if suoh it proves to be. Along the western face of the main mountains we have been operating in recent months in areas, including Baraimi, whion were oreviously more or less closed to us and we intend a aeoplysioal party in that area this winter, in addition to the wide belt 0 /the Trueial Coast which our programme also includes. It will not be possible to send a Geophysical party down to tne well South of Baraimi, in which the Political Resident mentioned that the Sultan would have no objection °ur maidng . our own arrangements “f ^TinSf the is to provide a small field Geological party and send it in wit a money-bag of moderate dimensions, and tell it to do tne °® 3 ■ 1 + ftfln It will of course, be accompanied by someone used to making* t hat ^ sort of° contact. The procedure of paying moneyto rnaiojig i ao allegiance to the Sultan would, one oan ^ ’oS^la of ^y Serous extension, sinoe we ‘mve in theory already paid the Sultan for the whole territory. /The , Donaldson, Ssq. , India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1. /which we had planned for this winter, unfortunately cannot take place because the instrunent is unobtainable, in spit of great .efforts made by our Chief G-eolegist in America, This is a great disappointment. As regards Dhofar province, we explored geologically a certain area around Sal ala and the other settled or semi— settled regions, in 1938* Results were negative. To penetrate further to the North and West - up to the sands . 10 rtaward, and right into the Mahra country westward, has for some time been one of our objectives, &lt; The Sultan was quite discouraging about this some months ago, but now seems to have changed his mind, Meanwhile, our winter programne 1 has not allowed for it. Nevertheless, we would make great efforts to send in a party based on Dhofar if fuller enquiry shows that the 'no objection' is valid, and above all that such party would be physically safe. On the latter point, one feels certain doubts: the tribes both North^nd West of Dhofar are extremely wild and under absolutely no control and I gathered a discouraging impression of these areas from Thesiger, Before sending Europeans into them we should, I think, want rather more than an 'all clear' from the Sultan who does not, of course, control them: we should want a fairly definite opinion from the Political Resident that the parties would be safe. If it were &amp; question of providing a small paid escort, from the people themselves, we oan do this. I mentioned on Tuesday that we were sending a - representative to the Hadhraaaut shortly after 1st November to ascertain Idle actual explorability of the Eastern Hadhramaut, which again is Mahra country continuous with the Western region of Dhofar, This representative will hope to visit Salala, and we should hope that while there he would both put our point of view to the Sultan and obtain the latter's.

Is it possible to give any definition of the western boundary of the Dhofar Province ? 3.

Dear Longrigg, Will you please refer to my letter No. EXT.7936/46 of 4th November, 1946', about Dhofar. 2. We have now heard from the Political Resident that the Sultan agrees that your representatives may travel anywhere in the coastal areas of Dhofar province from Shuwaimiyah to Ras Dharbat Ali and that he is prepared to undertake responsibility for their security. His only doubt as to his ability to ensure protection concerns the border of Dhofar province and the Aden Protectorate, where there is some possibility of interference by inhabitants of Mahra territory. The Sultan seems unwilling to define the inland limits up to which he can arrange security and would prefer to wait for an approach from your company giving details of the areas they wish to visit. The Political Agent, believes, however, that security can be arranged to many places to a distance of over 100 miles inland, subject to water supplies being available. As you may know, Thesiger recently travelled from Salalah to Ramlat ^ughsin under security arrangements provided by the Sultan without any difficulties. 3. It will no doubt be well for your representative to discuss the matter further with the Sultan near Christmas. Yours sincerely, Sd. F. A. K. Harrison. Brigadier S. H. Longrigg, Copied.

R. Hay, C.S.I. C.I.E., Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf. four 0.0. Wo. 1216-S, of the L 8 th December enclosing an extract to P.A., Muscat, on the foahra country. 1. The Mahra are not confined to the Aden Protectorate, at least elements of the iiahra tribe range freely in the steppe in the hinterland of the Dhofar Province as far west as 56 20 ' and there are small settled elements in the mountains. The following extract from a published work of mine in the Proceedings of the British Academy, Vol. xxiii may help. (Incidentally their tongue, which I have written a short grammar of, vide above, is, according to A1 Idrisi (circa AD. 1100) a survival of Himyaritic . Quote : 'The Mahra, who number many thousand men, extend from Has iSus and Jabal Zaulaul westwards through the borderland of steppe and mountain to kadi Rama, coming down to the coast at Jadhib and beyond. Although speaking the tongue Mahri throughout, east and west wings of the tribe spring from two distinct ancestors, and today there is no paramount shaikh of the Mahra with undisputed lineal title as is the case with many tribes. Each section has its customary headman, though one of these, by name Bir Afrair (Bir * (Ar.) Bin, in the Hadara tongues), has a unique prestige and exacts tribute from all except nomadic elements. The eastern wing of the Mahra - Beduin mostly, who in the harvest season become frankincense pickers - claims descent from one Bir Boki, and this branch is known as HasarTt. The western Lahra are largely settled, the coastal elements are often fishermen, and a few merchants and sailors are to be found among them.' 2. As regards boundaries you will find a short historical sketch of Dhofar on pp. 10 seq. of my 'Arabia Felix'. The somewhat fortuitous way Dhofar came into the Muscat Sultan 1 s hands 70 years or so ago probably means that the Western boundary was always ill-defined, if indeed it was defined at all. Before the arrival on the scene of European oil concessionaries, dotted lines on maps had. as you know, little interest for Arab rulers who thought in terms of revenue-producing-ports, or the habitats (especially water-holes; of beduin tribes owing them allegiance. The Mahra.tribe is scarcely a political entity but the beduin elements in the Eastern ranges in the oultan of Muscat's territory of Dhofar do not, so far as I know, owe allegiance as do their settled elements in the West to the Aden Government. I remember exploring the Southern coast with the late Sultan of Muscat in our state-ship 'A1 Sa'id' as far West as what we then considered the boundary, but I cannot for the life of me remember the name of the point though I have got an idea it was to the West of Rakhiyut. I must have a note-book and sketch map somewhere in my belongings either in Tangier or in storage in London, and if I get a chance of getting access to them sometime I will remember to send you along a note of anything of relevant interest.

I will endeavour to trace, and torv&amp;rd to you, a c^py of this letter on ny return to Muscat. 3* The Sultan states that the ifehra country is all to the west of this boundary and that the Ifehras have no tribal rights or land in Dtjcfar though they are occasionally to be met in the province 4 4* When Altounyan visited the Sultan in January, he ap parently promised the Sultan that the Petroleum Concessions Limited would send a party of geologists to explore Dhofar in October this year. The Sultan is confident that he can make adequate arrangements for their protection in most parts of the province but that provided he is told of the places they wish to visit before they go, he will indicate to them whether or not his protection will be effective. 5* Sir Cyril f’qx's verbal report has ao encouraged the Sultan that if the Petroleum Concessions Limited do not start serious exploration in this area soon, be will certainly assume that it is because t|hey have no real desire to develop their concession. v ours sincerelv, The Hon'ble Lt Political Resident S.5 • Col* W.R.; Hay, C.S.I., C.X.E., ssldent, P«|r aian Gulf, MFP—228 S&amp;P—6767-A—(M-636)—]3-7*45—200,000 Pad«.G.

In India Office letter No.P.Z.3643/33 of 29th June, 1933, to the Government of India (a copy of which was sent to Bushire) it was stated that H.M.G. agreed that the claim of the Sultan of Muscat that Has Dharbat All is the boundary of his territory might be admitted and that the Sultan might be informed accordingly. Apart from this there seems to have been no precise definition of the boundary, and it appears from correspondence here with the Colonial Office in 1935 that there was doubt even as to which side of the headland of Has Dharbat should be regarded as forming the boundary. According to a report made by W.H. Ingrams in 1935 (papers forwarded to Bushire under P.Z.4374/35 of 12th July, 1935) local opinion held that the frontier runs on the west side of the Has - apparently the headland once belonged to Qishra but was bombarded and captured by the Sultan of Muscat some time past, and he 'made some mark upon it'. The Frontier is also shown as being on the west side of Has Dharbat All in a Survey of India map of southeast Arabia 1:2,000,000, but on what authority this was done is not known. According to Ingrams, from Has Dharbat All the boundary is said to run as follows: From Has Dharbat All to Arhqiyut From Arhqiyut to A1 Halta From A1 Halta to Wadi A1 Hana From Wadi A1 Hana to Fiza From Fiza to 'Aful From *Aful to Maghsil From Maghsil to Fadkhut 1 hour 3 hours 1 hour 2 hours 2 hours 1 hour 1 hour. r^ 3. I am afraid that this does not assist very much in solving the question of responsibility for the security of oil exploration parties in the neighbourhood of the frontier, but it is possible that Reilly (who is now working at the Colonial Office, and v/hom I am consulting), may be able to shed some more light on the subject. 0 4.

JX' fj-; OOV'ftFID (1) '* tUDI&amp;AHiUJT - HAHRA iUdMd Starting from Itukalla, a general reconnaissance survey is requested to be conducted along the south coast of the iladhramaut to the east and north to as close as is practicable to the Dhofar frontier. Extending inland fVom this base route, lateral excursions should be mode to examine the geologic structure and* stratigraphy of the area, * After completing the coastal area to the vicinity of the Dhofar frontier, the party should be returned to ISHftIBTF and follow a. proxinakely the route taken by Mi', Altounyan in late 1546, proceeding .•estward to a point to be decri.ded in the fj.eld, based on geolo deal and political conSicterat ‘ ons. From the point decided the examination is to be carried southwestwtird to the V/Af&gt;I MAiilLA and thsnqe down the wadi to SABOT. Along this route indicated as in all other routes it is requested that lateral excursions be made wherever geological conditions afford opportunities of adding new knowledge to the stratigraphy and structure of the drea. • ■ ^'Voia faihut the survey should return either along the cx&gt;ast or along an interior route to the Shihr-Tarim road and thence northward to Tarim, If practicable the return to the coast should follow another route, presumably the Tarin-...ukalla road. Both the latter and the Shi hr-Tarim route we believe are x^assable to auto traffic. The areas and routes indicated are designed to cover several crosa-seotians o,f the region of chief interest, namely the structural area lying westward from RAli FAPTAK, However, the routes are to be modified in accordance with security of the party and geological necessity for an evaluation of the region. « (2) DHDPAR It is requested that after completing the Hafihramaut and Mahra areas/ the Survey be continued from SALALA in'DHOFAH, From Salala examinations should be made along the coast to the west as far as the DifOFAh-iIA^HdAIAJLJT frontier; and to the east to the vicinity of HAS HAS; in both instances adding inland excursions to the extent/'V 1» — -3- extent that aepurity 3 and essential geological knov/ledge demands^ tlortlrv/ard from 3AL'1A the survey should be carried as * far north as KAIvlLAir AL HANA3II, subject of course to political and geological conditions. On completion of tills part of the survey* the party will return to Company Geological Headquarters in Tripoli, Lebanon, unless otherwise directed* FURF03S OF THE oURYKY AITD HATURE OF THE milDTATION It is requested that tills geological reconnaissance survey be conducted with the purpose of securing sufficient knowledge of the stratigraphy and structure of the region that a conclusive opinion of its oil possibilities can be formlatccl* Purthermore, it is anticipated that the* stratigraphic knowledge obfcraned rd.ll oe sufficient to add materially to the knowledge of basinal conditions in tills sector of the depositional trough surrounding the Arabian dhield. The geologic knowledge thus to be secured is both for an evaluation ox local oil possibilities, and for additional stratigraphic knowledge of the broader geologic province. ' Xn order to accomplish the purpose indicated, it is requested that the following data be acquired. (1) Lithologic and palaeontologic information of the sedimentary rocks of the area* * (2) Estimated thiclmcss of respective age group; , v i.e, thickness of major division of the Jurassic, Cretaceous and (2-viaicns of the Tertiaries, ani other formations* (3; Potentialities of the sedimentarj.es os to source, reservoir and cover rocks for rocks for oil generation and accumulation* ( 4 ) fxtent of inetamorpldsn and disturbance by vuleanlsm* (5) IVcsence of unconformities and possible stratigraphic traps for oil aooqmulation. * (o) 3ize and type of geologic structures with estimates of amounts of closure; . and an indication of relative positions within the depositional basin* (?) All evidence of oil or gas within the areas. (3) Collection of sufficient rock samples t-&gt; afford laboratory determinations of ages and lithologic characteristics* It is realised that the number v rock samples will have to be kept to a bare mini mum due to difficulty of tr ana art* It is thought that the area to be covered offers the key to the general oil possibilities of south-central Arabia. It is for that reason .t this expedition is being sent, in order to amplify knowledge previously gained there in the field. It is hoped, therefore, that the new knowledge will be adequate to conclusively evaluate the oil possibilities of this sector of the basinal area flanking the basement core of central Arabia.

Dubai. 20th February 1248. Dear Sir Rupert, The Company have entrusted me with looking after their affairs in the area west of the Jabal Akhdar and it is in that capacity I am writing to you now. 2) I hope to leave here vithin the next few days for Baraimi where I shall meet one Mohammed bin Murad, who might be described as factor to Shaikh Suleiman bin Himyar, and with his and Abu Dhabi's help hope to be able to meet Shaikh Suleiman in Ibri. Ultimately I propose trying to persuade Shaikh Suleiman to take me to Tanuf, where his car recently arrived, as also to let me see the Imam (and if at all possible vShaikh Saleh bin Isa) but I do not expect him to co-operate to that end and imagine he will, in fact, oppose the suggestion. 3) My Company consider their concession covers the whole of Muscat and Oman including the territory controlled de facto by the Sultan as also that appertaining de jure to him i.e. the Jabal and westwards to the limits of his territory. We are, however, almost certain to be faced with a demand for a separate agreement by one or other of the de facto rulers in the Jabal and its neighbour hood. ^ (F, U. \\e should, therefore, be glad if you would confirm that there has been no agreement or understanding between the Sultan and the Oman tribes which limited the Sultan's sovereignty in Oman; in particular, the Treaty of Sib in 1921 (?) presumably did not contain any clause of that nature? mm If there is no objection, could we be given details of the relevant clauses of that Treaty? 4) I rather anticipate that Shaikh Suleiman will not allow me to go beyond Ibri and will demand a decision on the question of a separate agreement before permitting the Company geologists to work: in the Ibri area. In that event, I propose going by road to Muscat with the object of giving the Sultan the gist of my talks with Shaikh Suleiman and would ask the Political Agent if he could do anything to facilitate an agreement between the Sultan and Shaikh Suleiman. Yvould you kindly let me know whether you see any objection to these plans? 5) I have given a copy of this letter to the Political Officer Trucial Coast. Yours sincerely, (SOD.) RICHARD BIRD. Lt.

Dated 11th March, 1948. I acknowledge with thanks receipt of your letter Ro.DO/SA.14/5667 dated the 8th March 1948 on the subject of bird's letter of the 20th February. 2. I have already discussed both your own and Bird's letters fully with you and summarise the results below. 3. I understand that you are the local representative of P.C.L. so far as their operations in the Gulf Gtates and Muscat are concerned and in these circumstances I shall expect to receive communications relating to Bird's activities from you and not direct from him. 4. I have no objection to Bird's addressing the Political Agent Muscat direct when he is in a position to communicate with him quickly. For the present however I would suggest that any communications intended for the Political Agent Muscat should be passed through this Residency. 5. So far as I am aware there is no change in the attitude of the Sultan of Muscat towards the Company's plans as outlined in this Residency letter Ro.l645-S dated the 15th September 1947. 6. In view of the Sultan's attitude towards your plans I recommend that you should not inform the Sultan direct regarding Bird's programme. I am asking the Political Agent to do so verbally if he sees no objection. 7. With regard to Bird's letter the Treaty of Sib was made between the Sultan of Muscat and the Oman tribes and in the circumstances I do not feel myself at liberty to communicate its terms to you without the Sultan's agree ment. I am asking the Political Agent if he has no objection to ascertain whether the Sultan is agreeable to a copy of the Treaty being given to you. 8. With reference to para 4 of Bird's letter at first sight I see no objection to his plans except that I think he will find it very difficult to implement them, but I would suggest that he should consult the Political Agent before making any approach to the Sultan. I think it is unlikely that the Sultan will wish to take official cognisance of any of the Company's operations in Oman which are not carried out under his auspices. 9. I am expecting Stewart here about the 19th or 20th March and he will probably be staying till the end of the B. H. Lermitte, Esquire, Manager, Petroleum Concessions Limited, Bahrain.of the month.

Major u tew art and I agreed that the Company could pursue this course and await the Sultan’s reactions if any. r, ^ 2. ^e did not discuss paragraph 1 of S.99 with Mr. Lermitte. I have told Major Stewart that I can give him no information aoout the future currency of the Gulf and that he v must assume that for the present we shall carry on with Indian (and not Pakistani) rupees. Major Stewart showed me the letter referred to in the last sentence of the paragraph. It is one from the Company to the Sultan enquiring whether they should make payments to the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, instead of the Eastern Bank, Karachi, in future. 3. Mr. Lermitte did not ask for any written reply in continuation of S. 95 (my letter No.560-S dated 11th March 1948). I suggested that if he wished to he should forward me a summary of our discussions and ask me to confirm it. 22nd March 19 48. Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, the 23rd March, 19 48.

It seemed most likely that payments would continue to be made in the Indian Rupee. 2. Regarding this question of the Pakistan and Indian Rupee, the Sultan said that he was going to watch events, but unless there was a financial agreement between Pakistan and India he had it in mind to publish a notification that for official purposes only the Indian Rupee would be accepted in Muscat - i.e. for payments into Muscat Treasury or payment of Muscat Customs duties etc. Ye said that if no bank opened in Muscat he hoped that the Reserve Bank of India and not the Reserve Bank of Pakistan would do something about turning over the currency in circulation in Muscat. ltd.

Jackson, MBE, Political Officer, Truclal Coast, Sharjah, to Mr. C.«ff&gt;. Felly, OBE, Political Ager.t, Bahrain. Para 5: I did not gather from Bird that he contemplated making a formal agreement with the A1 £u Shamis or any other tribe. My impre:sion w s th&amp;t he is not authorized by his Company to make formal agreements with anyone; but thrt, because he thinks that they are more likely to honour written promises than verbal ones, he proposed to ask them for their permission in writing for the Company to explore in their area for the next three years in return for stipulated ad hoc payments. Bird realizes that there is a risk of their dishonouring even written promises; but Shaikh Zayid, whom Bird consulted in Bursimi, thought that they would honour them. Also, Bird considers it better to try to get N them to commit themselves now for three years in ad vance rather than that the Company should have to ne gotiate an entrance fee afresh every year. For the Company to hrve to do so would, he thinks, put the tribes in a position to increase exorbitantly their de ands as the Company became increasingly committed. Their be haviour up to da'e certainly supports this view. For the season 1946-46 Lermitte paid the Al Bu Shamis Shaikhs about Bs.2,000/- for permission to mate © geological survey - which the Company made. In 1947 Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahmah asked Rs.10,000/- for permission to do a geophysical survey of a very smell part of his area - involving about 2 hours* work -; and this year he asked at first Rs. 1 lakh a year for permission to survey and has now reduced the demand to Rs.26,000/- a year, without as yet committing himself to this figure for three years. It appears unlikely that the Sulten would object to these payments, which are not being deducted from the Company*s payments to him, end which, indeed, relieve him of the responsibility for obtaining entry for the Company into country which he may claim but over whicn he has no control whatsoever. indeed, the Al Eu Shamis absolutely deny that the Sultan has any suzerainty or even i; fluence over them, and they are contemptuous of his pretensions. XXX XXX 5. According to the Shaikh of Fujairah all the Zakat of the #adi Samall is collected by the Imam arid the area directly administered by him. Unless the Company could reach an understanding with the Imam, therefore, it would be impossible for them to re?ch Izki or Ibri by this route. By entering from the North-west, however, the Company hope at least to gain access to the Dhahirs area (containing Dhank, Aflaj Beni Qitab, Mazam etc.), which is not under the Imam or Suleiman bin Himyer, and possibly to Ibri, in which Sulaiman bin Himyar has great influence. Bird hopes to meet Sulaiman bin HAmyar in Buraimi to ascertain his reactions to the Company's overtures. Further, this area is contiguous to the area they have have already surveyed from the Trucial Coast; and to survey it next is the logical and convenient continuation of their present operations. For thesg reasons, I understand, the Com; any regard the Wadi Sairail as at present the more difficult of the two possible approaches to their objectives.E / Please refer to your letter No.C218-14/1 dated the 25th.April 1948, I shall be grateful if the following reply is sent to Mr.Bird of Petroleum Concession$(Trucial Coast) Ltd. ^ 'Received your message.Regret unable to accede ■ \ v ^ ^ x- v ^ s * * ^ to your request.Shall be pleased to see you in Muscat.Best wishes.SAID' Mr.B.D.Stobart, H.B.M* sACTING CONSUL / MUSCAT. oc/xjl, ^ cky 4^ 'U) y'/s'i ^.v. ^ ^ o, a O- Telegram From To No.C 172 Dated the 12th '.lay, 1948.

Bird has arrived imscat and reported to the Sultan on the results of his work in the interior. I understand privately that the Sultan is slightly afraid lest the partial success of Bird's private negotations with Sheikhs should overshadow his own prestige such as it is, in the interior. I also understand that the Sultan is not happy about the payments made by Bird to aL BU SxJii-IIS. 4. I have asked Bird not to raise any fundamental issues of policy without reference to you and he hopes to visit Bahrain before the end of ;iay to speak to you. Political. asr. MEf I huve already given you verbally full detnilo regarding ay talk a with the Multan during the laat few daya and am writing thia letter in confirimtion. 2. I cane here with the intention 01 letting the Sultan know whet I had been doing in BARA22H* I told Ma that I &gt;ieci riegotiateci with the AZ, HU ShA!0S and BU KHUBAZBAN ( MUM ) to allow the Conpaiy to explore their la tide. I told his Highness that I hod paid / thee© two tribes and had taken from them letters confirming their underatamiiig that the Corjpaiy would be allowed to explore for 3 years extendable at the Cospany's option to 5 years and stipulating the eua which would be paid to the sheikha yearly in token o£ their agreement* I explained that no replies had been given by me to the Shaikhs * letters which were designed prinarily to prevent then increasing their derwrids m each year and which would be considered as receipts rat) er than con* tracts since they were letters fron ono party only. 3. The Sultan was extr&lt; nely perturbed hy the towpany's direct approach to the tribes and maintained that he lied never agreed to that procedure. I explained timt. we liad been given to understand that he would say nothing if the Coapttny approached the tribes direct but would f of course f retain the rigit to object at a later date if he considered it necessary. The Sultan flatly denied that h© liad ever given hie consent, t&gt;acit or otherwise, to such a course which he considered was in direct violation of /article 12 ( I think ) of the Concession which stipulated flat the Company would enter only those areas which he declared aafo. his highness then explained that in 1939 ho bad informed the Cmjpany tlusit he could and would arrarvre for their entry to ti*» rKAHUtA but had been usxtble to agj*ee to the use of cars. The position, he maintained, was.....ms in 194 th# oai?je as In 1939 i*©. h© could and would, if asked by the CoirajAny, arrange for their entry into the Hid IKA. The Sultan » / declared tJait he hart not been told of the Company*e intentions to which he would never }jave agreed and he said tiiat the nisunderstanding arose heosusc what he actmlly said to the Consul in 1946 v«s that if the Ccrepany chose to enter the DLAhIRA ( under hie auspices ) by car they could do so at theiTr own risk. he \v.a 9 t rrfore, exi.refielj' worried about the effect8 of the Conpany 1 * direct ei^roaci; to the tribes, and he feared that the *1. FU x»gotation8 would tend to ©ncourare ©very tribe in the DFAhlft/* to assert its Independence by dealing direct with us. This, then, the position I discoverer, on arrival here after y first meeting with his highness. He told rse, later, that he had intended invoking the f olit5cal Resident's mijiport to step our work in the CI:aH 1HA sine© it violated the C oncessions kv&gt; weuld th^w NiVB demonstrattdjhis authority to the tribes there. He would then have forced the;t to work with him, but, fortunately, we i^ve avoided things coming to that pass. 4. I teve, as you know, had long talks with hint every day since ray arrival and w© have fi nally agreed as follows t (a) Since I liave already settled with the *L BO ShAtfIS, who haive not been on good terns with the Saltan for about 2 years now, the latter will not. try to chastise their Sheikh, JCIiA MD PIN S4L§IkN, but will, in due course, call him in to ftusc&amp;t when I have gone fron EAIiAIMI and will take the line that he, Mohaoned, has been greedy, that the Sialtan when he agreed ( sic ) to the Company's paying the Sheikhs direct a sweetener * had not intend ed that Ms subject© should oppose the Company as he, Moharmed, had done., etc., etc., etc.. In effect, be will show r4ohanmsd that he had given his consent to the direct approach ( as indeed 1 had already told the sheikhs In the genuine belief that that was so ) and will win him Vack to the fold. I have warned him against tlir^ten- ing os* chastising Mchaswed who v/ill, I know, imediately’ take rofiige with the AL &amp;V. f 1'VuJt' • The letter Ha rved hae given me will stand. (b) The iiultan is not particularly concerned about the B1J KKVTAIFAN and will adopt the same jjrocedure with then. (c) The KHA'ATI, AH T D AS SALF, wrote to his highness ( I was Shown the letter ) telling him that they were his faith ful subjects and that they bad shot, up the Christian (me ).'WV The Multan will send for AL &amp;P AS S^LF fit onco 9 and tell hin he is to neet ne in BAR&amp;H find agree witli m ro^rding presentc. SJ-iETKIi MUfiii AS SALF and indeed all the other shaikhs will be allowed to £ive s» letters on the fi^nie lines as I have already taken off the AL PU SHAUIS and BU KHUREIBAH. (d) The Sultan will call in UBAID BIX JUMk of the BAK2 KjUB at the sane tine as AKMAD AS SALF aid will five hi» the sarae instructionn • (e) His Highness will instruct SIuJilt wAgft of the hA'IU in on the sarao lines as also the RANI CJTTAB, R#J,UCh aixl UiAi^ people • The tfoner&amp;i idea is that in 8 - 10 days time these people neet nm in BARAIMI and settle with ^e having had the til tan* s jarior orders to do ao. This my all sound a bit ambitious and gives rather a &lt;lifferent picture to what I had conceived in BARaim where &gt; the Sultan’s influence appeared to be so negligible, lie has f . , , howewr, sl'cwm me about i00 Arabic letters collected over ' i) the last 10 years or so, end many of very recant origin, !&lt;jUflin which all those people affirm their loyalty and obedience Uit j think he is right in claiming that they are Ids , LA'* ^subjects and with the usual Bedou duplicity they pmt fi . ^ ‘ A — rl4 ci f\n ^ Vva btKavi t.4' at Miu t'n H 4 a +»_ . . A different aspect on the question when at &amp; safe distance from Muscat. Vi&gt; XAAWVv b 5« t . fcjwy- — Ij; The point is, however, tint the Pultun is convinced that thej' will obey his wishes and I must give it a try. i*V I asked tlio Sultan whether he would open the flkDl JIZZI to oars since it was the obvious route to RA?.AIi£l from the RATIt&amp;ii and was an infinitely better route for the Conpeny to week than those from the TRUCIAL COaSI over the HAZAA BaUSJi or tU 1U«T ANAIJ auntie, he was, at i first, opposed to doing so more out of pique at the course we had adopted tl*m for any other reason I think but after srich persuasion he has seen the wisdom of opening the WaPI and providing the Company with a short, accessible and easy route to the interior. 1 o has promised to do every thing he can without delay and asks that the torapary should assist him ; I tl*:Ink he wants material rather tlian financial support as for example ce lent to luild watch towers and gunpowder to blast the 15 yard (?) gap wldch blocks tliO Y;ADI to motor transport. ( It ie, I understand, onl^^ a short distance which requii'ee levelling )• I have inf armed Mm tint I was sure the Comrxuiy would aosi^t him and that I would refer the miter to London as soon as possible. 6. I hjtve discussed the prospect a of the Company's entering the HLCF APXAurea ( it 10 not a t^adl as a^iown on the ifuscat %siro l/l nillion sheet Korth P 40 ) • He su^^eeted we should enter from JaaLAN with HU ALI escort ( he Is sweet with the HU All ) and nove by canel to .JEE 2 BX^tAHUT on the coast picking up x&amp;bia' ( guides ) from there fron the 1 reraonat rated agalntt this devioriS not hod of approach and said ws would like to land at J&amp;HUT or sonaewhere near, build up a base canp there for water since t-iero is none In the HUGT area, and operate with not or trans port • I said we would take as escort ary one he wished. He Infomnd me there were no important Sheikhs from whom we could obtain guards hence his suggestion to employ the DU All. The Sultan is going to consider this question and has promised to let me know as soon as possible wtat he considers the best way would be to work that area. 7. I have explained broadly to the Sultan the areas in which we are interested and he has offered to give rae letters to the LRJ1D • shaikhs who are, theoretically, and in practice, subordinate to their TAKZNfcH SHEIKH HOUJ&amp;flD BIN TIMA. The Sultan suggests I contact them in due course and move with then anywhere 2 like in their country or in any country bordering on the sands in the S.W.corner of O&amp;M as long as I keep away frot« habitations of other tribes. ' This was a most weloooe invitation and although he has probably little authority to offer it, I do at least know that this scheme which I had been cento rapist ting for next winter will will net meet with his opposition. I consider it can be done and have already lad indirect overtures from the OtJiU *. We should then obtain access to an area we are anxious to see and the Sultan assures roe that none of the Dig Three would object or could oppose the DUHN 1 . In conclusion, the Sultan*a reactions are interesting. He la oil hungry but ravenously so in so far as iliOFAH is concerned. He oven remarked that he hoped that SHOFAR would be able to drain all the oil fro \ the Concession if you think there is no oil ?' 2 told him we were doing the Fast l.s. from O&amp;AM 1 He grasps at every little thing that leads him to hope for results in EKOFAR and said to me ' ?&lt;by dont you give up i our best and he should rely on our geologists and not pay too much attention..Attention to Sir Cyril Fox*® report because the letter mis not an oil geolofrist although probably very competent ih hie own line, lie ie happy to hear from hie .ALI BAMND in iTHOF/Jl that our gedogiats were intereeted in certain parte of the country thore and is feverishly hoping for result e.

Sultan informs me that Ahmed as Saif is unlikely to agree to see you at Buraimi. Sultan claims that Saif is difficult and will probably require that future Geological party should be escorted by Sultan*s people and work from Muscat territory. 3 . Sultan recently sent me for no reason a reminder of Article 2 of the treaty which deals with the safety of foreigners in the interior. This suggests that Saif may have denied Sultan*s authority and that Sultan wishes to cover himself in case of trouble. 4 .

The following are some subsequent developments which may interest you. A 2 . In para 4 (c; of his letter to me dated 12th lay (sent as an enclosure to ray D.O. under reference), Bird stated that the Sultan would instruct Shaikh Ahmed As Saif to meet Bird at Buraini for discuss ions. Ahmed as Saif arrived in Muscat on the 22nd and left on the 3rd June for Buraimi. 3 . I gather from the Sultan that Ahraed as Saif was not as amenable to persuasion as had been hoped and it appears likely that he will refuse to see Bird on his return to Buraimi, that he will insist that any future exploratory or geological parties be escorted by the Sultan’s people, that they should approach from the Muscat and not the Trucial Coast side. For this purpose, I believe the Sultan is doing something about opening the Wadi Gizzi to motor vehicles ( see para 5 of Bird’s letter under reference )• 4 . I suspect that the Sultan may have endoctrinated Ahmed as Saif to take this attitude in order to try to turn Bird’s expedition into an officially sponsored effort, operating from the Sultan's territory. I know that the Sultan is anxious to try to keep all oil explorations in liuscat and Oman under his eye, even at the expense of going back on his word given to Bird. 5.

The Shaikh of Dubai arrived here today, and I am wondering whether there is any connexion between his visit and Pird^ activit ies, I have asked Jackson for any news which he may have, 7. Almost a propos of nothing, the Sultan mentioned to me the other day that he wished Article 2 of the 1939 Treaty to be observed, ( This refers inter alia to the movements of foreigners in the inter ior ), I asked him to be specific, but he simply said that the reminder was intended in a general way. He confirmed this in writing and a copy of his letter No.S/35 dated the 26th May is attached. He also told me that the Imam had sent him a letter stating that he was disturbed by the prospect of Christians entering the interior, I am pressing him for a copy or at allevents an excerpt from this letter. The Sultan denies that it refers specifically to oil development, but I feel certain that it does. 8 . I consider that nothing can be done to clarify the present state of affairs until Hird returns from Buraimi, when he will no doubt be seeing you, 1 would only suggest that P,C,L, be told that the Sultan has reminded us of Article 2 of the treaty and that any penetration of the interior without his backing must necessarily be at the persons own risk.

W.R.H. 16/6/48CONFIDENTIAL. &lt;L ■ Dubai, ^C/ 6 th June, 1948 / \ * V&gt;^ 9 ^ a * Dear Jackson, ^ v ^ \ ' 5.i»7 The position regarding my work down here as it was when I returned about mid-May is explained in my letter of the 12 th May to Stobart a copy of which I sent you. 2 . I have since then been unable to come to any agreement with Ahmed al Saif of the Khawatir because the Sultan detained him un til the 4th June in Muscat, The only information about the result of the Sultan* s efforts that I have received is contained in the telegram No.C/196 of the 5th June from the Political Agent, Muscat from which I draw the following conclusions which may or may not be correct. ^ rt X. Unless the Sultan has bribed Ahmed Al Saif very heavily, I do not believe he will be unwilling to meet me; he may be unwilling to meet me in Baraimi itself and might wish me to go to Hafit. Again, subject to the same proviso as above, it is wishful thinking to suggest that Ahmed al Saif will require the geologists to work from Muscat territory; that is what the Sultan wishes and seems to have reverted to in spite of the fact that I explained at some length during my recent visit that we could not enter the Hafit or Baraimi area from Muscat territory by car until he opened up the Wadi Jizzi. The Sultan is well aware that he would be placing very serious restrictions on our operations if we were forced to operate from Muscat territorybefore that were done. If Ahmed al Saif has been bought over to the Sultan’s side, it means that there is going to be trouble amongst the Naim and Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan has already told me that he would at once stir up every conceivable difficulty not stopping short of fight- | ing if Al Saif went over to Saiyyid Said. That, then, is the position as I see it and, to put it bluntly, the Sultan has either succeeded in queering his own pitch or ours. The Sultan’s re ference to Article (ii) of the Treaty is not understood by me but his concern not to become involved in any responsibility for the safety of foreigners is merely part of his well-known mania on that subject asis very well demonstrated in Dhofar to this day; I don’t think it has any real significance. 3. Mohammed bin Ali bin Awwad of Hafit was due to arrive in Baraimi the day after I left and I deliberately avoided him so as to give the Sultan a chance of seeing what he could do on his own; I could easily have settled with him myself I am quite certain. 4. Regarding the Bani Kaab. I did not realise until I went to Muscat that the Sultan had any serious pretensions to.those people and I said nothing when ] he stated he would call Shaikh Obaid to Muscat and tell him to settle with me. The latter came into Baraimi about ten days ago and I asked him if he had had a letter from the Sultan. He ad mitted he had and said he would not be leaving for Muscat for some days. I told him the Sultan wished him to agree with the Company to which he replied at once that, while he was prepared to discuss thefts of camels etc. he was notprepared to talk about oil with the Sultan since it did not concern the latter. It would have been a physical impossibility for Obaid to have returned from Muscat in time for me to settle with him before I left Baraimi and unless I could bring in some other largish tribe before leav ing I would have been unable to have told the company that therewas sufficient work for this next wintei'; I felt justified, there fore, in settling with the Bani Kaab before Obaid had received his orders from His Highness (which he would not have accepted). To the best of my knowledge the Bani Kaab are a long way from being con sidered as Muscat subjects and if he raises any objection the point would then be at issue; if a decision were adverse to Saiyyid Said it would have unfortunate repercussions everywhere. 5. The A1 Bu Shamis are squabbling over the proceeds of the money they will receive from the company and I quite expected them to do so. It caused me some trouble because I was unable to move south to Suneinah which was my original plan. I am not particularly concerned about this domestic argument and I think Shaikh Zaid and Bin Rahroah will settle It all right but the Hamasah people will come out of it with very little; to my mind they deserve no more for many reasons and they are already intriguing with Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan. 6 . There now remains the Naim tribe less the Eu Khureiban who have come in. Shaikh Saqr was extremely agitated when the news '—- reached him that the Bani Kaab had agreed with me and I knew he would be. He has been a twice-daily visitor every day since and claims to be able to answer for all the Naim including Ahmed al Saif, and the Al Bu Shamisl His self-delusion is unlimited and on one oc casion when I remarked that it might be better for him to agree with the company before Shaikh Suleiman bin Hamir succeeded in seizing Dhank as he very nearly did last year he told me that Shaikh Suleiman was really afraid of him and that he was continually being approached by all the Ghafiri tribes to evict Suleiman from Ibril A Duru’ Shaikh was in Baraimi the other day and I had a long talk with him during which he told me that Shaikh Saqr had instructed him to refer any approach made by the Company to them to him and that he would answer on their behalf; I gathered that he was left under few delusions what the Duru f answer was to that proposition*. Shaikh Saqr is remarkably like the Stiltan in appearance and is of exactly the same stature; they ere similar in many other respects one being that they both seldom ev r move out of their residences. They were torn within a fews weeks of each other and I have heard many of the bedou commenting on the extraordinary resemblance in every way. 7. Eumeid bin Abdur Rahman is causing me some concern. His recent refusal to allow the company’s motors to move on the road is all part of his intention to discomfort the company and he is being encouraged by the Hamasah Al Bu Sharais. He is intriguing against Bin Rahmah and trying to cause troubife with the Aulad Ali. ^ Heowns a few date gardens in Suneinah and makes them the excuse for visiting that place. I understand he has been told that he is a de pendent of Sharjah but, because he is a potential danger to our work down there, would you consider telling him direct yourself that if he does not mend his ways you will write to Shaikh Shakhbut and Bin Rahmah asking them to forbid his entry into their lands. This suggestion emanates from Shaikh Zaid who believes it would put a stop to ik his activities and who is very willing to help us because he also does not want any outside interference in these parts. I hope you will agree to this suggestion because this man is definitely a nuisance and has no right to cause trouble in Oman. 8 . I am sending a copy of this letter to Lermitte. Please excuse my typing. Yours sincerely, (SGD) RICHARD BIRD.r (fg^ \ CONFIDENTIAL . Political Agency 9 Muscat* No.C 291-14A dated the 4th July, 1948* Will ypu please refer to correspondence resting with your note dated 16th June, 1948, and Bird^ letter to Jackson dated the 6 th June, sent under endorsement No.M/57 (86/61 ) dated the 18th June, concerning P.C.L. Explorations in Muscat territories ? ^ /j»7 One naturally cannot express any definite opinion about the oil situation without possessing the full facts and with out a much more complete knowledge of the complicated affairs of Buraimi than I am ever likely to have. 3* The Sultan did remark, however, in conversAtion recently, that he considered Bird had let him down by starting direct negotations again in Buraimi after having agreed to work through the Sultan ( vide para 4 (e) of Bird^ letter to me, copy of which was forwarded under cover of my D.O. No.C 247-14/1 dated the 17th May ). ^ 4« I know that Bird does not hold a very high opinion * of the Sultan, and I feel that sometimes his attitude may be somewhat too hostile. He no doubt has his reasons, but I should imagine that he would make greater progress by a more friendly approach. Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim is now in Buraimi and I believe there is every prospect of the Sultan being able to open the Wadi Jizzi without much trouble. I gathered this impression from the Wali of Khaburah during my tour. Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. asr'1 I ■ 81/61 The Sultan sayu the P.C.Au geological survey party has completed its explorations in Dhofar, and has asked me to ascertain i 1 possiole, whether they found anything, I will .na^e enquiries from Mr r Lernitte, Put up on return.Please refer to correspondence ending with your demi-official letter No.C.291-14/1 of the 4th July 1948 about P.C.L. explorations in Muscat territory. \ I enclose herewith a copy of a note I recorded after my conversation with the Sultan on this subject. I have shown the note to Lermitte and after having consulted his records has been forced to admit that Bird has double crossed the Sultan on the matter of Obaid bin Juma. Please, however, do not say anything about this to the Sultan. 3* Lermitte has promised to go and see the Sultan before Bird resumes negotiations with the tribes in the autumn. Would you kindly inform the Sultan accordingly if you see no objection. It Might be convenient to both if Lermitte were to arrange to see the Sultan when the latter visits Dubai in October. Would you kindly put this suggestion to the Sultan and let me know his reactions. / 4. I also told Lermitte when I saw him that the Sultan was most anxious to know the result of the Company's recent geological survey of Dhofar, vide my minute of the 6 th July 1948. Lermitte is telegraphing at once for information about this. P.D. Stobart, Esquire, Political Agent, MUSCAT ii 'LB'The Sultan talked to me at considerable length on this case on the 6 th July. He said that although he had never given his approval to Major Bird's visits to Oman, the latter had told the tribes that he was visiting them with his consent. He said he had discussed the matter with Major Bird during the latter's visit to Muscat, and reached an amicable settlement, but since then Major Bird had broken the understanding reached by entering into an agreement with 'Obaid bin Juma of the Beni Ka'ab and had also told the Shaikh quite incorrectly that his dealings with him had the Sultan's prior consent. The Sultan said he could make arrangements to take the geologists where they wanted to go in the area concerned, and ended up by objecting to members of the Abu • I Dhabi family being used by Major Bird as intermediaries in negotiations with the tribes. 2 . The next day, on board the 'Wildgoose', the Sultan produced a letter which he had just received which showed that Major Bird had written direct ot Shaikh Isa (or his successor) of ± the Sharqiah. He admitted that this letter was written before his -talk with Major Bird, but said he considered it improper for Major Bird to make approaches of this nature to his tribes. 3. I told the Sultan that I would discuss the whole matter with Mr. Lermitte and suggest to the latter that it might be a good thing if he were to go and see the Sultan before Major Bird resumes his negotiations with the Omani tribes. ltd.

Ihe representatives of the Petroleum Concessions can aimys communicate with me direct as in the past. His Britannic M«ge8ty*s consul, Muscat. Miief. B,L/L Lius cat November 'Ibith, 194 S* /y I am writing this letter to give you the resiilts of iny talks over the last few days with His Highness the Sultan. 1 bad been given to understand that His Highness was incensed at ray having come to an understanding with SHAIKH GEAID BIN JTJMA of the BAN! KA f AB towards the end of ray stay in BARAIMI last winter. I, there fore, expressed apologies to the Sultan at our first interview and explained again that I had come to an agreement with the BANI KA , AB with the sole object of ensuring that enough country should be open to us for this v/inter to make a visit by the geologists worth their while. The Sultan was perfectly contented with the proffered apology and explanation and seemed to bear no ill will v/hatsoever on that or any other account which was a more auspicious start to our talks thaKI had anticipated. 3* as you know, His Highness lias not been idle during my absence between mid-June and the end of October. He has employed a number of people to clear a passage for cars in the NADI JIZZI which is now open to traffic and through which one or two cars have already passed. Security arrangements are, he tells me, adequate provided cars are accompanied by his representatives but unrestricted traffic is not yet advisable and he will ultimately have to build one or two towers to guard the narrowest and most vulnerable portion of the ViADI. 4* SAIHID API'ED BIN IBRAHIM has visited the DHAHIRAH area and has reconciled the AL BU SHAillS and all other sub-sections of the NA f IM liith SHAIKH SA«^R BIN SULTAN of BARAIMI who will, in future, act as chief spokesman on behalf of them all as also that of SHAIKH OEAID BIN JUI.A and the BANI KA’B. His Highness has had all the Shaikhs in whom we are, at present, interested in to Muscat including those of the BANI QITAB of ATLAJ andthe EALUCK of MA’ZAIJ and ARRAQI and they have all signified their allegiance in writing to him and an intention to abide by his orders. 5* These developments are most satisfactory/ and, if arrangements work in practice, we should be able to do quite a lot of work this winter in the DKAHIRAH. The only snag that I can see at the moment is that SHAIKH SA^iR BIN SULTAH of BARAIIvII has not yet come in to see His Highness and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that he will try to assert his independence or, at least, refrain from committing himself any further and so disrupt these plans at the last moment. The Sultan is confident that that will not happen. I told His Highness that we expected two geologists to arrive in early January and would like to start work as soon after their arrival as possible. We agreed that the party should enter BARAIMI fromSOHAR via the WADI JI2ZI accompanied by ALI BIN MUBHAFFAR as the Sultan*s. representative. We shall use motor transport and ALI'S party shall not exceed 3 o** 4 persons. The Sultan has agreed to give me a letter for SHAIKH OBAID of the BANI KA*B instructing him to do whatever we ask him in the RA'IAT ANAIJ area. We hope to survey a route for cars which will avoid the big sands there and plan to do this before the geologists arrive. 7* I have reached agreement with the Sultan regarding presents to be distributed to the various Shaikhs and His Highness has promised to do his best to enable us to explore as far south as the BANI QITAB country inclusive. In short, as I have said before, we shall be able to cover quite a large expanse of territory/ in the BBAKIRAH provided everything proceeds according to plan. 8„ You my remember that I told you that the Sultan had received a letter from the IMAM mentioning that foreigners were beginning to '* interfere ,l ( or some such word ) in Oman and expressing his hopeML -v*n that he would remember that religious interests should take precedence over material considerations e The Sultan showed me this letter and his reply designed to allay AL KHALILI 1 S fears. I only mention these exchanges because they confirm once again the opposition of the priestly faction of Oman to the opening up of that country. The Sultan is confident that we have nothing to fear from them in the DHAb-IRAH up to and ( I gathered ) including IBRI but agrees that the SKAR^WYAH and NIZWA areas will be out-of-bounds for a long time yet. His Highness appears to be confident as ever that his influence is increasing all over Oman and, I think, still has designs on the Imamate when AL KHAI.TI.I 'dies which, by all accounts, he may be expected to do in the not too distant future. The picture one gets on the other S3.de of the hills is very different byt I suppose it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the Sultan might succeed in buying the votes of the n college of electors ” and securing his own election as AL KhALILI’S successor ; knowing the intrigues and duplicity of the people, though, I should be very surprised if he succeeded. From the Company^ point of view we should, of course, be delighted if there were one supreme authority throughout the land because it would simplify the problem of opening up the country enormously. 9. Our geologists would like to spend about a week in the SIKH HATTAT area, which is a short distance from Muscat and is approached by the V/ADI ADAI. The Sultan has no objection andthey will arrange details with SAIYID ARMED BIN IBRAHIM on arrival here. SIKH KATTAT ifi on the road to QURYAT and I nyself have passed through it on more than one occasion in the past. The geologists, two in number I believe, expect to arrive in Muscat sometime in January 1949.No. C 418(14/1) Confidential , HIS Majesty’s Consul at 'uSCat presents his compliments to The Political Resident, and has the honour to transmit to him the u documents.

I gave the Political Resident a copy of ilajor Bird’s letter, and he talked it over with the Sultan. No special comments.6 th December, 1948. I have the honour to report that the Sultan appears to have learned that Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited, as a result of their recent geological survey in Dhofar, are of the opinion that there is little pnospect of oil being found there. He has accordingly requested that, if the com pany have no intention of proceeding further with the survey for oil there, they should abandon their concession in order that he may endeavour to interest another company in the area. He mentioned that before he granted the concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited, he had been approached by an American company, I think the Standard Oil Company of California. 2 . I am of the opinion that if Petroleum Concessions Limited do not intend to carry out further operations in Dho far at an early date, it should be suggested to them that they should abandon their concession, though if they agree to do so, I would certainly propose to press the Sultan to give British as well as American companies a chance of taking their place. Dhofar is very much beloved by the Sultan and he is most an xious for its development. Ihe failure of Petroleum Concessions Limited to find any reasonable prospect of obtaining oil there, which I believe to be the case though I have not heard it officially confirmed, must be a bitter blow to him, and it is only reasonable that he should be allowed to try his luck with other companies. 3 . I am telling Mr. Lerraitte, the General Manager of Petroleum Concessions Limited at Bahrain, that I have written to you in this sense and he will no doubt inform his princi pals • 4 .
