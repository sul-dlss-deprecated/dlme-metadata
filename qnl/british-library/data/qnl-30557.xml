December the 4th, 1939. © j\. f i \ Please refer 'to my Printed Letter No. C/524 dated the 2nd December 1939. 2 . The Sultan was anxious to know what active opposition to Germany^ armed forces would be expected of him in the event of a landing being attempted on his coast. He envisaged the possibility of a ’’pocket” battleship slipping past our navy and possibly demanding supplies from Dhofar, Sur or Muscat. He felt that in the face of such overwhelming force he would be unable to take effective action and that active resistance would only lay his country open to reprisals without achieving any appreciable result. I said that in my opinion he should do every thing in his power to prevent the enemy from attaining their object whatever it might be. It was impossible to lay down hard and fast rules of conduct as each situation would have^ to be considered upon its merits. ATiere there was a ^ reasonable chance of success, I thought, he should certainly offer active resistance. Where it was manifestly imposs^ ible for him to offer armed resistance, then he should put every obstacle in the intruder's way that the Arab mind could devise. After some further discussion we agreed that it was impossible to legislate for such eventualities now. The Sultan said that he would consult the British f i \ / Representative at •he Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Kuwait.2 © yi \ Representative at Muscat before deciding on his course of action. 3# The Sultan is not worrying about damage to Muscat or Matrah but is afraid of harm coming to Dhofar and his question was intended to clear his mind of such doubts as he may have had before sending instructions to the Governor of Dhofar.D.O.No.C/529. SECRET You will see from my Printed Letter No. C/524,dated December the 4th, 1939. the 2nd December 1939, that the question of a public declaration of his position after accepting the Subsidy has been raised by the Sultan. In his view no advantage is to be gained by a public declaration of war or antipathy to Germany. He considers that such a declaration by a State of the size of Muscat would make him ridiculous in the eyes of the world, and would not be understood by his subjects. He asked my advice. I said I had had no instructions on this subject and was therefore not in a position to offer official advise. I told him that the only advantage that would be gained by a public declaration would be a political one and I had no idea what weight would be given to a declaration from Muscat and whether it was desirable politically for such a declaration to be made. I said that I would seek your advice. The Sultan is not at all inclined to make any open move and I personally consider that it would be better for him to show by his actions rather than his words that he is whole heartedly on the side of His Majesty 1 s Government.

A* I knew that the Sultan intended to leave for a tour of the Batinah Province, I at once informed him that I hoped to be able to make an important communication to him almost immediately. On the 29th 'p tf© November His Highness informed me that he proposed T -.o lea/e for Uusannah early the following morning. Between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the 29th November I received your telegram Ho. T/535 dated the 28th November. I immediately informed the Sultan and asked him to delay his departure and grant me an interview at 9-30 a.m. the next morning. His Highness agreed. At the interview 1 presented him with the communication which you had instructed me to make and also a letter Ho. C/515 “ r ‘ e 30 th November 1939 regarding the possible mi stake ia ^raiis- mission of the first word in para 2 (f) (3) of the Government of India telegram No. 2178 dated the 25th November 1939. Copies of these documents have been forwarded to you under my Printed Letter No. C/519 dated the 1st December 1939. At this interview the Sultan asked whether any points that he / had raised V w£ •ly had ralsad at his intsrvisw with me on th« 30th August had bsen overlooked. He stated that he had not kept any record of that interview and was uncertain of what actually took place. In order to make it quite clear that no points had been overlooked I read to him By telegram Mo. 260 dated August. 30th. The Sultan then stated that he would consider the cosimunication that I had been instructed to make to him and also his reply. He asked if I would be prepared to receive him to discuss the draft of his reply. I replied that I was at his disposal at any time. At midday on November 30th the Sultan wrote to me to the effect that as he wished to leave early the next morning for Musen n ah he would like to see me during that afternoon. At 4 p.m. the Sultan called and read me his draft reply. I informed him that I considered it adequate. In regard to the request contained in para 4 of my letter No. C/614 dated the 30th Hovember 1 S* 39 , he stated that he had drawn up rough state ments designed to show hew the Subsidy was to be spent. He showed me the statements and we discussed them generally. Later in this report I will comment in detail on these statements. Various ether points relating to hie general attitude were dis cussed and they are noted in the -notes' on my interview which I have forwarded to you under my Printed Letter No. C/624 dated the 2nd December 1939. Such of these points as have a direct bearing on the question of the Subsidy will be dealt with later in this report. The Sultan left the Agency at 6-30 p.m. and his written reply was handed to me at the Agency at- --a- -••m the same evening. The Sultan left Muscat at daylight on the 1st December. 2 . The actual reply to the communication appears to me to he adequate and the statements,which form enclosures to it, are as satisfactory as can be expected. 3 . The first enclosure to the Sultan's letter dated the / 30th Novembex3 inf 30-tii November 1^39 »hows how the amount of Ra. 60,000 is to be expended- Generally the allotment of funds to the various towns appears to be satisfactory. I am not, however, in a position to make any comments on the adequacy or otherwise of the sum alio ted to Dhofar. In view of the fact that the Sultan has an especial fondness for that province, 1 am inclined to believe that Rs. 6,000 is an over estimate. The amounts to be spent on the two forts at Muscat, Mirani and Jalali, appear to be unduly large and I have little doubt that the Sultan intends to carry out extensive repairs. He has wished to do this for yeare but funds have not been available. I advised him not to apond too much money on archaeological restoration. He replied that ■irani would be used as a magazine and plmae of refuge and also that it was to be fortified in accordance with the 'Muscat Defence Scheme', a copy of this scheme was sent to you under my letter f No. C/307 dated the 12th September 1939. I presume that the ^ actual supervision of repairs will be in the hands of individual Governors with occasional visits of Inspection by the Sultan himself and his State Sngineer, a man who was until recently an overseer employed by our Public Works Department. The onxy possible way to ensure that the money is being properly spent is by tours by “the Politrical Agent*# The second statement deals with irregular troops. It A ’ is not proposed to enlist these extra men at once. In theory this is partly because there is no immediate need for them .they require no training) and partly because the Sultan wishes to make a careful selection. In practice it is probable that their enlistment will not be hurried ao that tha funds alloted for their pay may accumulate and ba made use of for some other purpose. I asked what would become of this money* The Sultan was vague and said that he must have some money in hand for eventualities. / 6 . The third4 5 * The third statement shows how the monthly Subsidy will be spent* It is proposed to raise an additional force of two hundred locally recruited men. These men are to be properly trained and will be amalgamated with the 150 bevies now at Bait- al-Falaj. The items in this statement are by no means accurate. This is not because the Sultan intends to make use of the money for purposes for which it is not intended but because he has no one capable of advising him on the proper allotment of the funds. This statement will have to be carefully revised after a thorough examination of the needs of the trained armed force. 6 . The Sultan raised the question of obtaining the services of a British Officer to command his trained troops. He asked my advice and I told him that 1 considered it essential both to ensure the maximum efficiency of the troops and also to supervise expenditure. The Sultan asked me to consult you. He said that he was prepared to pay Hs. 1,200 a month as salary. I told him that I thought that the officer appointed should be of the rank of Major. His Highness said he was prepared to pay up to Hs. 1,400 a month. This will not include passage and pension contributions. The officer selected will be required to command the regular troops. He will be responsible for raising and training the additional force of two hundred men. He will have to supervise the preparation of defence positions. He will deal with all questions of administration. He will be assisted by three serving Indian Officers of the Indian Army and one locally recruited Indian Officer. I am assuming that the Government of India will be able to provide the two Indian Officers mentioned in their telegram No. 1718 dated the 2nd October 1939. While dealing with this question I wish to suggest that instead of two Indian Officers as instructors in mountain gunnery it would probably be better to have only one mountain gun expert and one / Indian5 y Mi Intiun Officer or Warrant Officer for an infantry battalion. Fro® this very brief survey of the work to be oone it Kill be seen that an individual of exceptional organising ability ia required. 1 suggest that the Government of India be approached ae soon as possible and be asked to make a suitable individual available. Until he is appointed progress with the defence programme will be delayed. I will give the Sultan all the assis tance that I can in the meantime. 7 . Although the Sultan has not raised the question of the actual payment of the Subsidy I am sure he would like it to commence as soon as possible. He will probably wish it to be paid r»n t.hi y ia Muscat in silver. I have sufficient cash in the Indian Government Treasury here to pay the initial payments of Hs. 1,00,000 and the monthly payments of Hs. 20,000 for at least six months and possibly longer. I suggest that I be instructed to these payments} funds will presumably be made available by the Currency Officer, Bombay to maintain the balance in the Treasury at a reasonable level.

Initial expenditure on uniforms for the men, equipment for men and animals will be found from the arears of Subsidy now due but upkeep or such portion of it as fall upon the State will be found from the monthly allotment of Rs. 9,000. The Sultan has asked if the money due to him can be 5. retained in the Treasury for safe custody and issued to him when required.

I have asked whether the balance of this advance ( Rs. 28,800) will be paid here or in India and on my receiving a reply I will at once communicate with you. His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman.My dear friend, Thank you very much for your v which I am replying to at once. Firstly, I wish to assure you that ; there is no question of lack of confidence. The Government have undertaken to fulfill certain conditions and in return you have agreed to grant certain and to carry out c^tSin^security measures. As you say in your letter you have confidence that the Government will honour their side of the agreement and I am sure that the Government have confidence in your honouring you part of the agreement. The para in my letter that you allude to is by no means an unusual clause in an agreement of this nature and it is not inserted with any intention °f • gi i M- ja of implying lack/confidence in the ruler of Muscat. I myself feel sure that all measures for the security of the State will be carried out. I am and always have been willing to give you any asoistance / ^—y that I may be able to. I particularly wish to avoid giving any yl impression tnat I was anxious to interest myself in matters which are ^ strictly speaking not my concern. As regards the raising and training of the new force I shall be only too happy to give such advice as you ask me for. I am sorry that the misunderstanding over the Qhofar money has arisen. The amount of the Subsidy has been set on one side | together with the special grant and that part of the Zanzibar subsidy which I have so far been instructed to pay. They are at your di^pos- a i and can be removed from the Government Treasury at any time and all I require is a formal receipt. You informed me that you would like the money to remain in the Treasury for safe keeping. I raised ■ no objection. This morning I understood you to mean that you would remove some part of the money and purchase dollars when the market was favourable. I further understood that you proposed to return the dollars to the Treasury for safe keeping until such time as you were ready to send them to Dhofar. I therefore suggested that they should be kept in sealed bags with your seal on them this would have made it unnecessary for the individual coins to be counted. I hope that I have made the position clear. If you desire the money to remain here it will be paid to your representative for receipt taken2 I will then accept custody of the sum on your behalf and give you a formal receipt and you will be at liberty to remove it from my custody at any time on returning my receipt or may take any part of it at any time the amount removed being noted on my receipt held by you. I am sorry that this misunderstanding should have arisen and yet I feel that the frank exchange of letters which it has occasioned will strengthen the cordiality of our personal relations. If there is any point which I have not made clear 1 shall welcome an opportunity to endeavour to remove any doubt on the subject. Your sincere friend, Sd./ T.Hickinbotham.nOTJFIDENTIAlj* i°{0 D.O.No. C/561. December the 10th, 1D39. I am* enclosing copies of private letters which have passed between the Sultan and myself. 2. This exchange of letters took place during the exchange of letters regarding the publication of the ’•Eeneral' Alan and the ’’Trading with the Enemy” Alan. In this connection please see my letter No. C/559 dated the 10th December, 1939. 3 . I believe that the Sultan’s letter was inspired by the fear that he had, during our interview earlier in the day by being unwilling to make his position clear and his pro-British and anti-German attitude generally known, given a false impression of his general attitude to His Majesty’s Government. I also believe that it was the bultan’s intention to draw a considerable sum of money and send it to Dhofar, much more than would be justified by the estimates that he has furnished me witli, and he was under V ' _ the impression that I wished the dollars retarned to the Treasury and would thus be aware of exactly how much he was sending to Dhofar. /# le Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Kuwait.Telegram From To No. Dated TELE GRAM. - Political Agent, Muscat. - Political Resident, Bahrain. - 562 - December the 10th, 1939.

Sohar is of considerable Importance and communication between Muscat and Sohar is subject to delay. 1 suggest fi'f that a car be provided for the official use of the Wall. It would probably be good training to station one of the new lorries for Bait A1 Falaj at Sohar with a crew of six or seven men.

MAO Your Secretary, Kiian Bahadur Shubaily brought me the plan of the suggested new buildings at Bait Al Falaj on Monday January 8th and asked me to examine it and let you have such remarks as I might consider it desirable to make • 2. The following are my commentss- (a) Garage plan * I consider that this is essential. (b) Ho'soital . These repairs are most essential and should be carried out as soon as possible. (c) Indian Officers Q uarters. The normal complement of Indian Ofticers is three. They can be adequately accommodated in the Fort. It is proposed that a fourth Indian Officer shall be appointed aa an Instructor in Gunnery. He can also be found accommo dation in the Fort. Certain small alterations will be necessary such as the erection of wooden partitions on the j I verandahs and the provision of two small bath rooms. The outside wood work of the Fort badly needs painting. Unless this is done the wood will be unprotected from the sun and rain and will in time have to be replaced at considerable cost. The British Military Advisor can be Lb Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, 1 Sultan of Muscat and Oman.- 2 - MW found accommodation in Museat• (d) Cook Houses * I advise that these are not built of cement concrete. I consider that it will be necessary to have a firm floor of cement concrete, but the walls and roofs should be constructed of mud brick or stone and mud mortor. This should reduce the cost considerably and I suggest that Cook houses be built for the whole Force. I think that the suggested plan can be enlarged to provide another cooking range and Cook house accommo- dation as I have roughly sketched. It is necessary in my opinion to have more than two stores that is one for each platoon. (e) Barracks for Mobile Units * I am afraid that this is too ambitious. Much as I would like to see all the barracks made on this scale I fear that I cannot advise the expenditure that it would entail. The barrack for the Mobile Unit's personndlle should be situated in the neighbourhood of the garages and should contain accommodation for at least 30 men with two stores for equipment and two N.C.O's quarters. The place should be of a semi permanent construction but must have a properly laid concrete floor. It should be well ventilated and be provided with verandahs as protection from the summer heat. The verandahs should also have concrete floors. 3. I would like to draw your attention to the state of the other barracks. Some of them are in need of repairs and all of them in my opinion should be provided , with cement concrete floors. These floors are essentia for the good health and cleanliness of the men. 4. I suggest that the question of the provision of j||| wash places for the men be considered. I have notenquired myself and there may be-already sufficient washing place accommodation for every body and if there is not then concrete floors should be laid and provision made for the supply of water and for the drainages of the wash houses. 5. I do not know if any arrangement has been made for the storage of patrol. A store should be constructed at some little distance from the living quarters of the men so as to guard against risk of damage from fire or explosion of the petrol.NOTR h'2&gt; Squlnment.

I have examined the ground and think your suggestion is the best one. This road will indeed be most welcome. 3. As regards the alteration to Bruj al Rih. I have only one comment to make and that is that it will save at least half the cost of expenditure on the tower if you knock down the top of the tower and mount the gun on the first floor instead of second. By mounting the gun at a lower level there will not be any loss of effectiveness. There may however be sentimental reasons for retaining the tower in its present state. As far as I can see the suggestion by your Engineer is adequate and there should be no risk of the tower and gun falling down the hill.

His Highness has no objection to receiving half of the Subsidy in India which he says .may be paid to his bank in Bombay (Imperial Bank of India). He however stated that in the event of an urgency he should be allowed to draw the full amount in Muscat and for this he would give us a due warning. I told him that he could easily sell his cheque in the bazaar but it appeared that he did not like this idea for the reason, I think, that he does not want any one to know that he is drawing funds from his bank reserve.

The Omanis are worried and to a lesser degree the Sultan le worried and has, so Pettyfer tells me, been discussing the possibility of eir attack from Kussla end Hussia's attitude generally. This fear on the part of the Omanis may bring them into closer contact with the Sultan’s Government and as far as that goes no harm will be done in fact the reverse,but fear la a dangerous element end is liable to e get out of control imlees checked in time and th«n no on*.- forteli what will happen* The Sultan himself is worried, exactly to what extent I find it difficult to decide as he is remarkably good at disguising his feelings, and I think that it is thee jhatjke ima afcle to see for himself that there are still British ships of war afloat end in the Persian Gulf. The absence of British ifcip of ar no, MMMt waters is largely responsible for t*o Omani attitude and a visit •van for a fee hours would have a ooothing offset on their nervous system.

The Political Agent &amp; H.H.M 1 s Consul, mus c at• bir, Herewith i enclose a report on the training and equipment of the Muscat infantry, for your information. I have the honour to be, sir, Your most obedient servant, Military Adviser to n.H. The sultan of Muscat « Oman.SECRET Details of Training and equipment of the Muscat Infantry, for the year 1940. 1. ORGANIZATION . The strength of the Force has been increased to 4 Indian ufficers and 350 other ranks. This is divided into a neadquarter Company consisting of 4 platoons, viz. signalling, Artillery, machine Gun and Administrative, and two rtifle companies each of 3 platoons. The rifle platoon strength is 30 other ranks under the command of a havildar. 2. ARMS, in addition to rifles the Force is armed with 2 2.75 , ‘ Mtn. guns. 3 3 pdr. Q.F. guns. Maxim Machine gu. Lewis guns. 1 vickers Berthier gun. It was hoped to obtain two more v.B. guns to complete them to one per platoon of the second rifle company, but these are not available from india. There are also a quantity of obsolete rifles and other assorted weapons which are not in use. 3. wEfTRUITTEMT . During the first three months of the je ar when the increase of strength was first sanctioned a .great many local men from Muscat and matrah were enlisted, some of them of rather doubtful fighting quality. Latterly recruiting has been slower and the majority enlisted from Gwadur, where a more suitable type of man is obtainable. The rorce is now upto strength, though fifty recruits are still under training. These should be ready to join their companies early next year.- 2 - u-vl&gt; 4, TRAINING . Individual and Collective training has been carried out, though this year it has had to be done under certain difficulties. The best of the n.C.Os. had to be employed on the training of recruits and palace bervants, and in general the knowledge of the w.C.Os. is very weak, it was considered that sufficient time could not be spared for living adequate instruction to the N.C.Os. first, though as many lectures and exercises without troops as possible were arranged. Another difficulty, which will take a considerable time to overcome, if it ever can be, is the complete lack of education among all w.C.Os. and men. A short battalion camp was held at uoshar from the 9th to 20th November and as this was quite a new experience to the old as well as the new men, a great many useful lessons were learnt regarding camp routine and protection as well as training in the field. 5. q-rtiwaT.T.TNfl . Men selected as Signallers .ver° organized into a separate platoon and a signalling navildar was appointed in April, nine than Hat training ... po..iM« has been e.rried out and con.ld.rlng the lack of „uip«.»t and poorn... of .donation, ,«». ..tl.f.otor, progr... b.e been .la. * signalling anatruot.r fro, a»di, ha. arrived and he abould very quiekly be able to r.i.o tbe standard to tbat required, and in addition Introdue. nethod. „f communicating -itb aircraft, -bleb » considered esaentaal. ■rhe signalling equipment on charge os quite insufficient and unfortunately tbe majority of appl« ^ fro.

The carriage of the guns on camexs is still in the exper mental stage, though it is considered that it will prove to be adequate. The saddlery is as yet incomplete and it is taking some time to make it up. The three 3 pdr. guns have been mounted on concrete bases, one in jwirani rort and two at cait-al-Jp’alaj . These have been tested and found to be very accurate. 7. MACHINE GUNS, under instruction from Lance uaffadar jan rtohd the machine gunners have completed their training and the results are very satisfactory, xhe three maxim guns are kept for Post defence, one being in iviirani Port and two at bait-al-Palaj. uf the four vickers guns, one section is transported in a lorry and the other section on donkeys. Xhe pack donkey section is working very well and it is proposed to purchase five more donkeys early next year so as to make the borry section pack also. This will enable both methods of transport to be used for the complete platoon as required. 8 . WEAPON TRAINING . (a) Rifle . 1 'his year all men except recruits, fired for the first time the same rifle course as the Indian Army. The results were, on the whole, good there being only 6 who failed to become service shots. 161 recruits have fired and issed the necruits uourse. ,b) . d g bt. Machine ^un . all men of Rifle Companies ader the rank of havildar and ^th more than one year-s service ere to have fired a short course with the cewis or V.B. gun. ne company, armed with three uewis ffins, completed this, but he results were not good, xhe other company did not fire more ban a few men owing to the non-receipt of two more V.B. guns, rhich it was hoped would arrive in time, as it is doubtful rhether more V.B. guns will be received it is proposed to give ■ 11 _ „ more thorough training with uewis guns next year.^0) Machine ffuns . Men of t,he Machine uun platoon firei the course for 1 st year gunners with good results, rart ill of the course v.rire orders with hall ammunition) and Part Iv (Field firing scheme) were both carried out. ^d) Field firing , ihis will be done in December. Night firing . This was done by both rtifle companies and was apparently their first experience of it. v f) Anti -Aircraft , instruction in this has been given but no range course has as yet been fired. This will be done in December. There is one newis gun a.A. mounting on charge and this is kept in readiness on the roof of the rort. A mounting for the V.B. gun is being made up. Ig) Grenade . A certain amount of dummy grenade instruction has been given. Fractice with live grenades for a few selected men will, it is hoped, be done next year after a few w .(J.Os. have been given sufficient instruction to teach this subject more thoroughly. ,h) revolver. All Officers and men armed with the pistol have fired the course laid down for the Indian Army. 9. tfQIIIPMBNT . Personal equipment has been made up requirements and is in good condition.

The balances shown are considered sufficient, but another 40 boxes .SOS* 1 hall have been indented for as the saving on the annual budget allowed for this and also bundle packed ammunition for machine guns was required. The tracer ammunition is very old and was found to be useless as such. The balance will be fired off as soon as possible and replacement asked for. A large quantity of .22 was also found to be unserviceable through age and had to be condemned, 12. TRANSPORT . (a) Motors, rhe four new Chevrolet lorries are working well and found to be most suitable. A Ford station Waggon was sanctioned by nis Highness and recently purchased for the use of the Commandant. The old Leyland lorry and the two old Chevrolet trucks have had their day and are unlikely to be of any further service. The previous civilian driver was enlisted and made Transport Havildar. ne and one other driver have been in India doing a course of instruction at Chaklala, from. 'There they have just returned. It is hoped that now they will be able to improve the standard of driving and, if possible, render one of the PhPvrolPt trucks fit for some further service.- 6 - Animal , nineteen camels with five sarbans are attached to the Force, seventeen of these are used for the carriage of the 2.75 il guns and two for conveying wounded. Five donkeys have been purchased for one of the machine gun sections. There are two more on order, one to carry signalling equipment and one for nospital panniers, next year it is intended to purchase five more for the other machine gun section, and four for carrying Lewis and v.B. guns. Two horses are maintained, one for the commandant and one for the gunner officer. 13. MSDICAL . equipment is complete and more than sufficient. The Medical officer has given the bandsmen a course of instruction in first aid and stretcher Drill. There are two v?»ard orderlies. The general health of the rorce is good. All men are given l£ lbs. of atta a day; but the question of increasing this ration will be taken up next year, as without proper feeding and supervision the men, particularly those whose homes are in M atrah, are inclined to underfeed themselves and consequently are not really fit enough to undertake any strenuous work which they might be called upon to do. 14. ti UILDCTlS . During the year considerable alterations have been made to the hospital. The flooring of barracks has been cemented, larages and a building for horry personnel have been constructed. A magazine is under construction. «ext year it is proposed to build an extension on the Hospital for a Medical inspection boom and to convert the present cook-House so as to make it cleaner and fly-proof.

Rifles . The thirty rifles which the Sultan asked you to indent for are required for Dhofar as replacements for old weapons and to increase the armament of modern weapons as the difficulty of obtaining supplies of Martini Henry ammunition has reduced the effectiveness of his Dhofar armament. If you can find thirty rifles from your reserve without unduly weakening that reserve then he is prepared to withdraw his request for additional weapons from India. 6. Jemadar Mir Baz . In view of the unsettled position in the Dahirah the Sultan is not prepared to approve the grant of leave to Jemadar Mir Baz until he has had an opportunity of discussing the situation with you. 7. Sftivid Tarik bin Taimur . The Sultan has decided that Saiyid Tarik should receive pay etc. according to the work that he is doing and that the expenditure will be met from your budget. Should you consiaer him equivalent to a Jemadar or a Hawaldar he will receive the pay etc. of that rank. These emoluments will not be considered in any way to constitute an increase in any allowance which His Highness's half brother is at present in receipt of and will cease on his ceasing to be employed with the Muscat Infantry. 8. Military Budget Surplus. The surplus from last year is at your disposal. You should draw what sums are necessary by debit on the Treasury and the Sultan will reconcile the amount on his return.
