            Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā, Prince at Sheraz [Shiraz], received by the Resident on 28 June 1822.
            The firmaun summons the Resident to Sheraz, in order that he may obtain the
            'objects' he may require.The letter notes that the Resident has not requested such a
            meeting, nor does he know what the 'objects' the firmaun refers to are, though
            the Resident intends to find out. It further explains that while the Resident
            understands that he should not quit his post without the authorisation of Government, he
            intends to travel to Sheraz anyway, as non-compliance is likely to cause great
            offence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x000058#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
