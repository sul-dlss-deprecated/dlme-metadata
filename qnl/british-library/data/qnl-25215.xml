As \ our Excellency is aware, the Bahrein Order-in-Council was published in the ‘ l London Gazette ” in August 1913; but its further promulgation was postponed pending the completion of negotiations then in progress with Turkey and other Powers interested in the Persian Gulf. The question, however, has recently been reconsidered by His Majesty’s Government, who have decided that, in th® wholly different circumstances now prevailing, there is no longer any objection to the Order being brought into immediate operation. You are accordingly authorised, as you were informed by my telegram of the 12th January 1915, to publish the text of the Order foithwith in the “Gazette of India,” and to take the necessary steps, as pi escribed in Article / 9 (1), to bring its provisions into force. 3. You should at the same time instruct the Resident in the Persian Gulf to issue a King’s Regulation, under the powers conferred upon him by Article 70 (c) of the Order, making such alterations as may be required with respect to Bahrein in the Indian Pilgrim Ships Act (Act XIV. of 1895), which has been included in the Schedule of “ Indian Acts applied ” appended to the Order m Council* I would invite reference in this connection to Sir T. Holder- ness’s letter to the Foreign Office, No. P. 438, dated the 18th February 1913, a copy of which will be found among the enclosures of this despatch. You will I. 2)*.doubtless consider whether similar action is called for in respect of any other of the enactments included in the Schedule. 4. A\ ith regard to one other question dealt with in the correspondence with the Foreign Office, viz., that of slave trade jurisdiction, I have been in commmunication separately with lour Excellency’s Government, see the correspondence ending with my Political despatch No. 69, dated the 10th July 19 Id.

Foreign Office, 3rd February 1913 Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo, asking for his observations on a proposal of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire that, in view of a recent incident, a clause should be included in the new Bahrein Order in Council to empower him to act as a British Slave Court under Slave Trade Acts of 1873 and 1879. 2. I am to observe in reply that, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, a preferable course would be to allow the Bahrein Order to come into force as it stands, and to deal, if necessary in a separate Order, with the question of whether the Court under that Order should be given slave trade jurisdiction. 3. Sir E. Grey is aware that the Muscat Order of 1867 contains such a provision, but I am to call your attention to the fact that that Order is one of an obsolete type and that no clause of the kind appears in any modern Order promulgated under the Foreign Jurisaiction Act. 4. It further appears to Sir E. Grey anomalous that Sir P. Cox should be given slave trade jurisdiction in Bahrein when he does not possess it under the Persian Coasts and Islands Order, and I am accordingly to suggest that if an amending Order, such as that alluded to above is issued, it should be made to apply to that and to the Muscat Order as well as to the Bahrein Order. 5. I am to state, however, that Sir E. Grey is not satisfied that any need exists for the issue of such an Order, and that he would be glad, before considering the question more closely, to receive fuller information as to the incident which prompted Sir P. Cox’s suggestion. G. I am accordingly to propose that he should be instructed to furnish the necessary details by mail. 7. With reference to the further suggestion contained in the telegram from the Government of India of the 23rd ultimo, copy of which was enclosed in I. 29*. B *4 your letter of the same date, that the (Indian) Pilgrim Ships Act (14 of 1805) should be included m the Schedule of the Bahrein Order, I am to inform you that, m fell- it,. 0rev s opinion, the better course would be to apply this Act by a Kmg s Regulation.

Foreign Office and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. ; March 5th, 1915 Immediate. Sir:- I an directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th. ultimo elative to the Bahrein Order in Council and to transmit n which it is proposed to put it into operation. I an to point out that Article 8 (2) has been amended at the beginning to meet the objection raised by the Government of India in their telegram of July 6th. last and that a new sub-article (7) has been inserted at the end of the same article containing the words suggested in the marquess of Crewe’s despatch No.41 Secret of November 15th. (paragraph 5) and accepted by the Government of India in by the omission of the comma after the word 'foreigner &gt;}&lt;■ o you herewith printed copies of that paper in the form their The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(8C66/13) their telegran of December 28th. The word “prescribed* 1 has also been substituted for the word “presented' in Article 56 in deference to the wish of the Government of India expressed in the same telegram. In Article 11 (3) “Article 70' has been substituted for “Article 78“ which appeared, through an error, in the draft of the Order and 'K. G.' has been inserted after Sir E. Grey’s n&amp;ne in its last paragraph. It will be noted that these alterations are in addition to those agreed on in earlier correspondence which have been already introduced into the draft Order. As regards the second paragraph of your letter under reply, I an to state that the reasons which led Sir E. Grey to propose that the Indian Pilgrim Ships Act should be applied by a King’s Regulation rather than by inclusion in the schedule of the present Order have already been communicated privately to a member of your Department. They are that if the Act is applied by a King’s Regulation any modifications necessary to adapt it to local conditions (such- ■ ( 8066 / 15 ) (such as were required in the Persian Gulf and Muscat) can be made in the Regulation itself, whereas if the Act is included in the schedule a King's Regulation would also be necessary to provide for the modifications, and that this might cause .further delay in the promulgation of the Order. In view, however, of the preference expressed in your letter for the latter mode of procedure (for which however no specific reason is given) and of the opinion stated in the last paragraph that no further delay is likely to result from it, Sir E. Grey is willing to waive his objection to the inclusion of the Act in the schedule, notwithstanding the fact that in all other where it has been applied this has been done, so far as Sir E. Grey is aware, by a King’s Regulation. It will be observed that the necessary insertion has been made in the schedule to give effect to Lord Crewe's wish. I am to state that, subject to any further observations which Lord Crewe may have to offer on this question, Sir E. Grey would propose to submit the Order,( 8066 / 13 ) in the for/n in v» T hich it is now enclosed, to the Lew O fficers of the Crown and, on receipt of their approval, to forward it to the Privy Council with a view to its promulgation with the least possible delay.

No. * and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. February 3rd, 1913. Sir:- I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt ol your letter of the 10th ultimo, asking for his observations on a proposal of His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire that, in view of a recent incident, a clause should be included in trie new Bahrein Order in Council to empower him to act as a British Slave Court under Slave Trade Acts of 1873 and 1879. g) I am to observe in reply that, in Sir E.Grey’s opinion, a preferable course would be to allow the Bahrein Order to come into force as it stands and to tion of whether the Court under that Order should be given slave trade jurisdiction. tion to the fact that that Order is one of an obsolete deal, if necessary, in a separate Order, with the ques type qqPY ' ‘l A The Under Secretary of State 7 FEB 1913 SECRETARY'S N2 6type and that no clause of the kind appears in any modern Order promulgated under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. It further appears to Sir E.Grey anomalous that Sir P.Cox should he given slave trade jurisdiction in Bahrein when he does not possess it under the Persian Coasts and Islands Order and I am accordingly to suggest that if an amending Order, such as that alluded to above. Is issued it should he made to apply to that and to the Muscat Order as well as to the Bahrein Order. I am to state however that Sir E.Grey is not satis fied that any need exists for the issue of such an order and that he would he glad, oefore considering the question more closely, to receive fuller information as to the incident, which prompted Sir P.Cox’ suggestion. I am accordingly to propose that he should oe instructed to furnish the necessary details oy mail. With reference to the further suggestion, con- ) tained in the telegram from the Government of India of the 23rd ultimo, copy of which was enclosed in your letter of the same date, that the (Indian) Pilgrim Ships(1424/13). Act (14 of 1895) should he included in the Schedule of the Bahrein Order, I am to inform you that, in Sir E. Grey's opinion, the better course would be to apply this Act by a King's Regulation. I am.

Proposed Order Bahrein. in Council for * Letter to Foreign Office, dated. 16th August 1912 (without enclosures). Letter from ditto, dated 29th August 1912 (with enclosure). Letter from ditto, dated 26th October 1912 (with enclosure). t Comma here omitted. My Lord, M ith reference to correspondence ending- with Your Excellency’s telegram of the 30th July last regarding the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein, I enclose for your information copy of later correspondence*' with the Foreign Office on the subject. 2 . It will be seen that, in the absence of any specific delegation from the Sheikh of the necessary powers, no provision has been made in the draft Order, as now revised, for the deportation of foreigners, but provision is being made, in deference to your recommendation, for the registration of other persons besides British subjects, although as pointed out by the Foreign Office such an extension of the system of registration is in some degree anomalous and not altogether consonant with the practice elsewhere prevailing. 3. As regards the construction and wording of Article 8 , sub-article (2), to which attention was drawn in paragraph 3 of your letter of the 20 th June last, the comma to which allusion was made by the Political Besident in his letter of the 15th May last has now for greater clearness been omitted, the passage running: “ Foreigners! with respect to whom the ^ Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed,” &amp;c. This provision, which appears in nearly all Orders in Council under the Foreign Jurisdic tion Act, secures the exclusion of the Arabs referred to in your telegram of the 6 th July last, since they are foreigners in Bahrein whom the Sheikh has nob placed under British jurisdiction. No amendment, as suggested in that telegram, of the definition of “ foreigner ” in the draft Order, is in the circumstances required. But if Your Excellency apprehends that the wording of Article 8 , sub-article ( 2 ), may lead to friction with the Sheikh, and to claims by him that particular persons or classes of persons have not been put under our jurisdiction, it has been suggested to me that the point might be met by the insertion, as a new sub-article at the end of Article 8 , of the following words, which are more or less on the same lines as Section 4 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, and are S. 184.J analagons to provisions that are found in other Orders in Council, viz., “ If any question arises “ whether the subjects or citizens of any country, “ state, or tribe have or have not been placed “ under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agree- “ ment with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of “ Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the “ Political Resident, and a certificate under his “ hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question, “ and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.” 4. With regard to Article 21, sub-article (1), it will be observed that it has now been made to read: “Where .... any British subject “ .... is intriguing within the limits of “ this Order against His Majesty’s power and “authority,” &amp;c., instead of: “Where . . . . “ any British subject .... is intriguing “ against His Majesty’s power and authority within “ the limits of this Order,” &amp;c. * \ . 5 . I observe that notice is drawn, in paragraph 2 of the Resident’s letter of the loth May last, to the omission, in later drafts, of Article 16 of the draft of the Government of India. Tfie Article in question was a textual reproduction mutatis mutandis of Article 15 of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. But whereas the latter Article was in place as a provision for the enforce ment of warrants that had been issued in inland Persia, the Article as drafted in the Bahrein Order was inapplicable, since no reason exists why authorities in Bahrein should back their own warrants. 6 . I shall be glad to be informed by telegraph whether Your Excellency's Government agree to the issue of the draft Order in the form now trans mitted, which differs from that previously sent only in Article 8 , sub-article (2); Article 21, sub-article (1); Articles 51-59, and the table in Article 3 ; or whether you would desire the insertion in it of the new sub-article referred to in paragraph 3. In order to avoid delay, copy of this despatch is being communicated direct to the Political Resident. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, Signed) Crewe. \Sir, to ditto, dated 16th July Enclosure No. I. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 16tli August 1912. With reference to your letter \ T o. 10,753, of the 12th March last, State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of the correspondence* noted in the margin regarding the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. It will be seen that the Govern ment of India desire that provision should be made for the deportation and registration of foreigners. As regards the former, it seems clear that it cannot be effected by executive order ; and while it is no doubt desirable on general grounds to provide for it in the Order in Council, the Marquess of Crewe is inclined to agree with Sir P. Cox that it is inexpedient to ask the Sheikh for a specific delegation of powers for that purpose. His Lordship is not aware of the reasons for which your department preferred to limit the registration of non-Bahreinese to British subjects, and, unless there is strong objection on international grounds, he would suggest that it should be compulsory on all persons to whom the Order will apply. I am, &amp;c., 1 am directed by the Secretary of * Letter No. 73, Secret, from Govern ment of India, dated 20th June 1912. Telegram from ditto, dated 6th July 1912. Telegram 1912. Telegram from ditto, dated 30th July 1912. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. R. Ritchie. Enclosure No. 2 . Foreign Office to India Office. No. 35,018. Foreign Office, Sir, 29th August 1912. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant relative to the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. Sir E. Grey notes that the Marquess of Crewe does not support the recommendation of the Government of India that provision should be made in the Order for the deportation of foreigners, and this point will accordingly not be dealt with in the present letter. As regards the extension to foreigners of the registration provisions of the Order, which is also desired by the Government of India and advocated by Lord Crewe, I am to state that the reasons which led Sir F. Grey to suggest the limitation of these provisions in the case of non- Bahreinese to British subjects were, first, that registration is irksome, and it seemed better not to subject foreigners who are not British to an unnecessarily vexatious regime until British jurisdiction had become firmly established ; and, second, that it is desirable that Foreign Jurisdiction Orders in Council should be kept uniform as far as is reasonably possible, and that the registration provisions of the usual S. 184. A 2type become almost meaningless when they are extended to foreigners of every nationality. . . . The register of'British subjects is not merely a list of the individuals who are subject to the British Court in the particular foreign juris diction. Registration and the possession of a certificate of registration is evidence of British nationality, and the possession of such a certificate counts like a passport and entitles the holder to British diplomatic protection. It appears therefore to Sir E. Grey to be inconsistent with the character of the whole system of registration that a certificate issued at Bahrein should be quite different in its effects to a certificate at Basra. The Zanzibar Order in Council contains no registration provisions at all, and Zanzibar is the close parallel of Bahrein, because in both places all foreigners are subject to the British Court. Registration at Zanzibar is a voluntary matter, and the register which is maintained at the Consulate (or Agency) is limited to British subjects. The French Consul no doubt keeps a similar register of his nationals. In consideration however of Lord Crewe’s concurrence in the opinion expressed by the Government of India and of the arguments advanced by Sir P. Cox in 1910, Sir E. Grey is prepared to waive his objections to the extension to foreigners, other than British subjects, of the registration provisions, and I am to transmit to you herewith a revised draft of the articles dealing with this question which, with His Lordship’s approval, it is proposed to insert in the Order in the place of the existing Articles 51-67. It will be observed that it is intended that the revised articles should apply only to individuals, and that the provisions for a register for British companies have been eliminated as these cannot yet be required in Bahrein and it would be difficult to enforce compliance with them by foreign companies. I am to observe in conclusion that if these revised articles are inserted in the Order it will become necessary to re-number the existing Articles 68-87 as 60-79 respectively and to introduce a corresponding alteration into the table in Article 3. 1 am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State Louis Mallet. for India. Annex. 51. A register of persons to whom this Order applies shall be kept in the Political Agency. 52. Every person to whom this Order applies being of the age of 21 years or upwards, or being married, or a widower, or a widow, though under that age, shall register himself at the Political Agency within three months of the commencement of this Order, if resident within the limits of this Order at that time, or, if arriving within the limits of this Order within one month after such arrival. Provided that a person who fails to register himself within the time limited by this article may be registered at any time if he excuses his failure to the satisfaction of the Political Agent. 53. The registration of a man shall comprise the registration of his wife, or wives, if living with him ; and the registration of the head of a family shall comprise the registration of all females and minors, being his relatives in whatever degree, living under the same roof with him at the time of his registration. 54. Registration under this Order shall be renewed annually in the month of January.55. Every person who has not previously been registered applying to be registered under this Order shall, unless excused by the Political Agent, attend personally for that purpose at the Political Agency, but no person applying for the renewal of his registration need attend personally unless directed by the Political Agent so to do. 56. Every person registering himself under this Order may obtain, if he so desire, a certificate of registration in such form as may be presented by the Political Resident. 57. If any person to whom this Order applies neglects to register himself under its provisions he shall not be entitled to the protection, assistance, or good offices of the Political Agent, and shall be liable to a fine not exceeding Rs. 25 for each instance of such failure, but he shall, although not registered, be subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts established by this Order. 58.

To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. Lord, With, reference to correspondence ending with Your Excellency’s telegram of the 30th July last regarding the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein, I enclose for your information copy of later correspondence'^' with the Foreign Office on the subject. 2. It will he seen that, in the absence of any specific delegation from the Sheikh of the necessary powers, no provision has been made in the draft Order, as now revised, for the deportation of foreigners, but provision is being made/in deference to your recommendation^ for the registration of other persons besides British subjects, although as pointed out by the Foreign Office such an extension of the system of registration is in some degree anomalous and not altogether consonant with the practice elsewhere prevailing. 3. As regards the construction and wording of Article 8 , sub-article (2), to which attention was drawn in paragraph 3 of your letter of the 20 th June last, the comma to which allusion was made by the Political Resident in his letter of the 15th May last has now for greater clearness been omitted, the passage running: “ Foreignerst with respect to whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed,” Ac. afrion placed-by Sir P. Cox- on the passage ^s^&amp;cgtprinted, viz., that it applied to all foreigners, wasMolffinlended by the Foreign Office, •mrl Jlio which appears in nearly all Orders in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, secures the exclusion of the Arabs referred to in your telegram of the 6 th July last, since they are foreigners in Bahrein whom the Sheikh h^s not placed under British jurisdiction. No amendment, as suggested in that telegram, of the definition of “ foreigner ” in the draft Order, is in the circumstances required. But if Your Excellency apprehends that the wording of Article 8 , sub-article ( 2 ), may lead to friction with the Sheikh^ and/claims by him that particular persons or classes of persons have not been put under our jurisdiction, it has been suggested to me that the point might be met by the insertion/as a new S. 184. 'fvste. t Comma omitted. ,iOV 9,2 am v \ A Willi ‘■pitssub-article at tbe end of Article 8 , of tbe following words, which are more or less on the same lines as Section 4 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, and are analagous to provisions that are found m other Orders in Council, viz., “If any question arises “ whether the subjects or citizens of any country “ state, or tribe have or have not been placed “ under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agree- “ ment with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of “ Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the “ Political Resident, and a certificate under his “ l iail d and seal shall be conclusive on the question, “ and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.” 4 . With regard to Article 21, sub-article (1), it will 'be observed that it has now been made to read: “Where .... any British subject “ this Order against His Majesty’s power and “authority,” &amp;c., instead of: “Where . . . “ any British subject .... is. intriguing “ against His Majesty’s power and authority within “ the limits of this Order,” &amp;c. 5 . I observe that notice is r drawn,.in paragraph 2 of the Resident’s letter of the 15th May last, to the omission/in later drafts^of Article lb of the draft of the Trovernment ot India. TUe Article in question was a textual reproduction vnutcitj/ts mutandis of Article 15 of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council/ Jtat/thftt- Article was m (j place in the-Order as a provision for the enforce ment of warrants that had been issued in inland Persia/ ^he Article as drafted in the Bahrein why authorities in Bahrein should back then uwn warrants.

It seemed to us that the interpretation of Article 8 (2) was clear. It refers to those foreigners whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has placed under our jurisdiction and not to all foreigners, which is the interpretation placed on it by Sir Percy Cox. If it did, the sub article would simply consist of the word ''foreigners”. It is possiblepossible tiiat the comma after 'forei^ers” would be better left out, and if it is thought worth while to make so small an alteration, this can be done. As regards (3) the exclusion of the Arabs referred to in the Viceroy’s telegram of 6th July, 1912, is already secured by the wording of Article 8(2) and no further amendment is required. They are foreigners whom the Sheikh has not placed under our jurisdiction, but they are foreigners in Bahrein and not Bahrein subjects, and therefore the proposed alteration of the definition of Bahrein subject so as to include them would be quite wrong - and in view of the provisions of Article 8 (3) would introduce some confusion. As regards (2) the Amendment which Sir Percy Cox i. desires can be made but there should be no commas beforeand after the phrase W within the limits of this Order We concur in the procedure suggested in the last two paragraphs of your letter. 7 Ctfy dear I 7 omun, India Office. Oth September 2922. Your letter 30, 028 $ 29th Ancust, as to v ahrein Order in Council. I have read since coming back to the India Office the letter of the Couemmmt of India dated 20th June 1922 and subsequent correspondence, but though a decision seams to have been reached as regards the question of (2) the deportation and dp) registra tion of foreigners, there appear to he three points still remaining open, vis:- QJ The arrangement and punctuation of Article 9, sub-article (2), Vid ® para. 4 of Cox's letter of 10th lay 1912 and para. 3 of the India letter; (2) The wording of article 22, sub- article (1), llisle para. 7 of Cox's letter and para.3 of the India letter; (3) The definition of 'foreigner' Kida Viceroy's telegr am of 6th July 2929. Could you tell me whether the foreign Office would propose, when they prepare the Order in its final shape, to incorporate the suggestions made by Cox on all three points? °erhaps your legal Advisers have considered, them, but so far as I can see, they have fallen out of view. It occurs to me that the simplest course would be if we could send out to the Government of India a revised draft of the Order yon would propose to issue, imd say briefly:- 9 ! propose to concur. A? you agree?*, ktould it be much trouble to yon to let us have this 9 In sending the revised, draft we miaht explainexplain in what points it differs from tha J sent with vour letter of the 12th 'arch last (to save India the long and wearisome process of reading the tioo drafts together). Yours sincerely.Iji aiiy-ftirlTicx com^jmca on tms^subject, pleWi-qiioteV.- no. 35018/12. ;uid address— \he Undef^Seckstary of State. Forbign-OtHCC, \o ation ndon. f 2 . put away Sir:- m ! v ^ August , 1912, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th. instant relative to the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. Sir E. Grey notes that the Marquess of Crewe does not support the recommendation of the Government of India that provision should be made in the Order for the deportation of foreigners and this point will accordingly not be dealt with in the present letter. As regards the extension to foreigners of the registration provisions of the Order, which is also desired by the Government of India, and advocatea by Lord Crewe, I am to state that the reasons which led Sir E. Grey to suggest the limitation of these provisions in the case of non-Bahreinese, to British subjects, were first, that registration is irksome and it seemed better not to L(35016/12) subject foreigners who are not British to an unnecessarily vexatious regime until British jurisdiction had become firmly established and second, that it is desirable that Foreign Jurisdiction Orders in Council should be kept uni form as far as is reasonably possible and that the registration provisions of the usual type become almost meaningless when they are extended to foreigners of every nationality. The register of British subjects is not merely a list of the individuals who are subject to the British Court in the particular foreign jurisdiction. Registration and the possession of a certificate of registration is evidence of British nationality and the possession of such a : certificate counts like a passport and entitles the holder to British diplomatic protection. It appears therefore to Sir E. Grey to be inconsistent with the character of the whole system of registration that a certificate issuea at Bahrein should be quite different in its effects to a certificate at Basra. The Zanzibar Order in Council contains no registration provisions c &lt;(35018/12) provisions at all, and Zanzibar is the close parallel of Bahrein, because in both places all foreigners are subject to the British Court. Registration at Zanzibar is a voluntary matter, and the register which is maintained at the Consulate (or Agency) is limited to British subjects. The French Consul no doubt keeps a similar register of his nationals. In consideration however of Lord Crewe’s concurrence in the opinion expressed by the Government of India and of the arguments advanced by Sir P. Cox in 1910, Sir E. Grey is prepared to waive his objections to the extension to foreigners, other than British subjects, of the registra- tion provisions and I am to transmit to you herewith a revised draft of the articles dealing with this question which, with His Lordship's approval, it is proposed to insert in the Order, in the place of the existing articles 51-67. It will be observed that it is intended that the revised articles should apply only to individuals and that the j:'l J(35018/12) the provisions for a register for British companies have been eliminated as these cannot yet be required in Bahrein and it would be difficult to enforce compliance with them by foreign companies. I am to observe in conclusion that if these revised articles are inserted in the Order it will become necessary to renumber the existing articles 68-87 as 60-79 respectively and to introduce a corresponding alteration into the table in Article 3. I an, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,.. 51. A register of persons to whom this Order applies shall be kept In the Political Agency. 52. Every person to whom this Order applies being of the age of twenty one years or upwards, or being married, or a widower, or a widow, though under that age, shall register hlmsel f at the Political Agency within three months of the commencement of this Order, If resident within the limits of this Order at that time, or.

Result lias been gradual increase m popularity of Agency Court, and recourse to it by all who can mauage A on account of more effective justice obtainable. As'a consequence of this development, Sheikh has occasionally demurred of late to treatment of paiticulai individuals at Agency Court, and on my recent visit he made specific appeal to me m this connection, saying that when he ceded juris diction over foreigners he had only intended the word to cover subjects of recognized Powers and not the dependants of petty Arab potentates in Gulf with some of whom he claims to have special arrangements providing for reciprocal acceptance of each other’s direct jurisdiction. I informed him that, if he could produce agreements and if the other parties on being referred to acknowledged their validity, I thought we should be prepared to recognize them. We should doubtless have to intervene ultimately if appealed to on account of flagrant denial of justice, but, short of that I imagine Government will wish to accede to Sheikh’s wishes. In that case the definition of foreigner in Order in Council will require to be modified. I would suggest after the words ‘ Bahrein subject ’ the following words be added, ‘ or the subject of an Arab principality having a reciprocal juris- ‘ dictional agreement with Sheikh of Bahrein specifically recognized by British ‘ Government,’ or words to that effect.” The proposal has our support.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. }C bREIGN DEPARTMENT. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. SECRET. General. To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUIS oe CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 20th June 1912. My Lobd Marquis, % With reference to Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 2nd April 1912, we have the honour to forward, for the consideration and orders of His Majesty’s submitting his views on the final draft of the Bahrain Order in Council. 2. We concur generally with the opinion expressed by Lieutenant- Colonel Sir Percy Cox, and recommend that, in view of the explanation furnished, some provision be made for the deportation of a foreigner found to he undesirable. We leave it, however, to His Majesty’s Government to decide whether this could best be effected by executive instructions, as suggested by our Political Resident, if it is still considered that the necessary authority cannot suitably be given in the Order in Council itself. We also request reconsideration of the decision whereby the Articles providing for registration have been restricted to British subjects, and support the proposal that they be made applicable to “ every person to whom this Order applies ”. 3 . The alterations suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox in the construction and wording of Article 8 , sub-article (2), and Article 2i, sub article (1), respectively, of the draft Order are submitted for consideration. * No. M. 48, dated the 15th May 1912.

Froni —Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram No. M. 47 of the 15th May, I have the honour to submit my views on the final draft of the Bahrain Order in Council, which it is proposed to accept. 2. I Would note in the first place that Article 16 of the Government of India’s draft has been omitted. No explanation of the omission is offered in the Note on the amendments by His Majesty’s Poreign Office, but I presume it has been held unnecessary to make special provision for the powers therein provided. 3 . As regards the other amendments, I have nothing to urge against the acceptance of the majority of them, for, as stated in the said Notes, they merely tend to simplify the language or adapt it to that employed in other Orders in Council; but there are certain important exceptions to this category which affect the spirit and working of the Order fundamentally, and in regard to these I beg to offer the following observations. 4. Article 8 , sub-article ( 2 )—“Foreigners, with respect to whom the Shaikh of Bahrain has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty.” It is noted that the reference in the Government of India’s draft, to “ the Sovereign or Government whose citizens they are” is omitted, and a comma has been inserted after “ Foreigners ”. I therefore presume that the effect of this Article now is— “ Foreigners; the Shaikh of Bahrain having agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of juris diction over them by His Majesty.” If this presumption is correct, I would suggest that the words alter “ Foreigners to the end of the sub-article be enclosed in brackets, when the clause would FCOrd thus— “ Foreigners;—(with respect to whom the Shaikh of Bahrain has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty).” If this is not done, it would appear possible for the Shaikh to argue from the sub-article, as at present worded, that the discretion rested with him as to whether jurisdiction over a particular foreigner should be exercised by himselt or by us. 5 . Liability of foreigners to deportation.—In Articles 18 and 19 of the Government of India’s draft we took power to deal with “ persons to whom the Order applies”, whereas under Articles 21 and 24, as amended by the Foreign Office, we can only deal with British subjects. If the case of the Bahraini in regular British employ is considered of sufficient moment to necessitate some modification of the words “persons to whom the Order applies”, the provision might be limited to British subjects and foreigners”, but 1 strongly deprecate the exemption ot foreigners from the liability to deportation. If His Maiesty’s Government hesitate to contemplate the deportation or European foreigners, evea in flagrant cases without their express consent previously obtained, instructions might be issued by letter to the effect that the Political Resident before exercising his powers m such cases must obtain the preliminary sanction of the Governor-General m Council or ot His Majesty’s Secretary of State. Instances of the kind, however, would be of extreme rarity.On the other hand, it must be remembered that “ Foreigners ” will include subjects of Turkey, Persia and other non-Christian Powers, dependents of petty Muhammadan Rulers of the Coast and Hinterland of Arabia and natives of Qatar and other semi-independent tracts not eniovino* British nro tection outside Bahrain. J ° ^ I 0 14 '' s these denominations that the worst characters in Bahrain tall and while it is in practice very difficult to deal with them otherwise than hy deportation, owing to the lack of efficient police, the act of deportation is genera ly regarded all over the Gulf, among such communities, as a most natural, convenient, and humane factor of criminal -jurisdiction, and is con- stanUv resorted to by native rulers. Not to equip the Political Agent, Bahrain with this power in the case of these categories will be to deprive him of a most useful weapon for the maintenance of order, and one which is not in the least likely to be resented m its application. I therefore strongly advocate the employment of the wording “ British subjects and Joreigners ” wherever indicated in this connection.

DRAFT BAHREIN ORDER IN COUNCIL. Notes on Amendments suggested by the Foreign Office. THE majority of the amendments are merely verbal, and have been introduced either to sim plify the language or to adapt the phraseology to that employed in other Orders in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. Some of the definitions in Article 4 (for merly 3 ) have been omitted as unnecessary, the words being already defined in the Interpreta tion Act. Article 8 (formerly 6 ) has been rearranged; sub-Article ( 2 ), which was copied from the Zanzibar Order in Council. 1906, is un necessarily elaborate for Bahrein, where jurisdic tion over foreigners is claimed by His Majesty’s Government under the grant from the Sheikh, and not under arrangement with the foreign Governments concerned. Sub-Article 5 has been divided so as to relegate ships to a separate sub-Article ( 6 ), and this sub- Article has been made to apply to British subjects and foreigners only. It is scarcely reasonable to deprive the Sheikh of jurisdiction over his own subjects, except to the extent that they are within the bond fide domestic service of persons subject to the Order, and this scarcely applies to their ships. Article 10 is new, but similar provisions are to be found in the Ottoman and China Orders. Article 11 (formerly 8 ) was taken from the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1897, which was altered in 1903. The language in sub-Article (2) “ are hereby made applicable ” was found to be ambiguous, as it was not clear whether the enactments referred to applied automatically or required some further official act to bring them into operation. Further or future Indian enactments were made applicable to Zanzibar by King’s Regula tions instead of by Order of the Secretary of State. [168 a]As the system introduced in Zanzibar in 1903 was found to be more convenient than that of the earlier Order, similar changes have been made in the Bahrein Order. A slight alteration in Article 12 (1) has been made, and the powers of the Magistrate under the Acts scheduled to the Boreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, conferred on the District Court, i.e. T the Political Agent, so as to avoid the delay consequent on a reference to the Political Kesident. In Article 12 (4) (d), the area of the groups under Part II of the Pugitive Offenders Act, 1881, has been extended so as to prevent incon venience. Article 14 (2), formerly 11, is new, and is based on a provision in the Morocco Order in Council, 1889, viz., Article 11 (1). It would be exceedingly inconvenient if the Political Besident had to visit Bahrein before he could exercise any functions conferred upon him by the Order in Council, and as the Morocco provision has stood unquestioned for over twenty years and is certainly con venient, it is desirable to adopt it in Bahrein. Articles 17 and 18 (formerly 13 and 14). The language has been amended, so as to make it quite clear that Article 17 only applies to Bahrein,,and that the machinery of section 7 of the Poreign Jurisdiction Act must he made use of if a sentence of imprisonment is Ao he carried out elsewhere. Articles 21 and 22 (formerly 18 and 19) have been made to apply only to British subjects. Orders of, prohibition or deportation against Bahreinis would not be' reasonable, and until British jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein has become firmly established, the deportation of foreigners would be almost certain to cause friction with foreign Powers. Purthermore, the grant of jurisdiction over foreigners from the Sheikh seems scarcely to cover such a proceeding as deportation. Article 32. A similar Article is now inserted in all Orders prepared in the Poreign Office. Article 35 (formerly 31). The draft of this Article departed from the usual type (e.g., Article 28 of the Persia Coast and Islands Order), but the reason for the change was not explained. The elasticity, which was apparently all that was desired, will now be given by sub-Article 5 of Article 11 , and accordingly the Article has been3 brdught into line with that in force on the Persian side of the Gulf. Sub-Article 2. See note on Article 14 (2). Article 3S. The Foreign Jurisdiction Admi ralty Order in Council has been applied instead of applying certain sections of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890. (See India Office letter of the 24th July, 1911.) Articles 39, 41, 42, 43. The duties prescribed by these Articles have been conferred on the District Court, as the Political Uesident can scarcely be expected to attend to matters of this kind. Article 40 has been amended, so as to bring it into line with the more modern form. The old Article 40 has been struck out as being unnecessary; the matter is covered by section 2 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code, 1908, which applies in Bahrein. Articles 51—67 have been substituted for the Articles formerly numbered 47—50, as the modern type of provision on the subject of registration of persons. The register of companies was intro duced in the Ottoman dominions by the Order in Council of 1910. Articles 75 and 76 are new. The former is taken from a similar provision which was in force in the East African Protectorates, where there were no Consular officers, and the lattef w r as suggested by the India Office letter ot the 2 dth July, 1911. Article 78, formerly 59, has been slightly amended, because of the amendments in Article 11 (formerly 8 ). The Article numbered 64 in the draft has been struck out as unnecessary, there having been no previous Order in Council in Balnein which is being replaced by this Order.Y *-+L- f confidential.

The Right Hon’ble the EARL of CREWE, K.G., Mis Majesty 9 s Secretary of State for India. Simla; the 8th June, 191L s My Lord, With reference to Lord Morley’s Secret despatch, No. 11, dated the 21st May 1909, we have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty’s Government, the correspondence detailed in the annexed schedule in regard to the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. 2. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has procured from the „ Sheikh of Bahrein a request in writing » e enc ©sure o. . that he may be relieved by the British Government of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his territory. We consider the document valid enough for the purposes for which it is required, as it distinctly surrenders all civil and criminal jurisdic tion over foreigners in Bahrein to the British Government. We, therefore, recommend that the Political Resident may be empowered to inform the Sheikh that following thereon, the needful provision has been made by His Majesty’s Government. 3. We also submit, for Your Lordship’s consideration, a draft of the proposed Order, and would draw attention to the following specific recommend- , ations made by our Political Resident Vide enclosure No. 4. • xu t&gt; • — ri n? • m the Persian Gulf, vis .:— (a) the definition of the expression “ Foreigner ”, (&amp;) the need for a set of regulations for Registration, and (&lt;?) the necessity for the Court of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf being constituted the “ Chief Court ” for purposes of Appeals under the proposed Order. As we agree in substance with the views expressed by the Political Resident the Order has been drafted to include provision covering the points detailed above. But in respect of the grant of the powers of a “ Chief Court ” to the Political Resident, in preference to subordinating the Bahrein Courts to the High Court at Bombay, we would, in drawing attention to the views expressed on a similar consideration in connection with Somaliland in paragraph 4 of Lord George Hamilton’s Political despatch, No. 28, dated the 8th April 1897, mention that the Political Resident will be instructed by letter that when exercising these powers he must hold his Court within the limits of the Order. Similarly the Judicial Assistant to the Consul-General for Ears and the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf, and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to whom special powers are to be given, will hold his Court,2 when required, within the limits of the Order. We do not consider that any inconvenience will arise by the adoption of this course as it is not likely that either of the officers will be absent from Bushire together, or that they will he required to hold their respective Courts in Bahrein frequently. . 4s. The Political Besident in the Persian Gulf has further intimated that it would he advisable, if possible, to extend the provisions of “ The Foreign Jurisdiction (Admiralty) Order in Council, 1910 ”, to Bahrein. The point is accordingly submitted for the orders of His Majesty’s Government, as also are the views expressed by the same officer, in his telegram No. 357, dated the 19th Tr ., , „ K April 1911, that the Political Agent, Vide enclosure No. 6. -r» , • i i i i -i , ® ’ Bahrein, should be empowered to perform the functions of a Notary Public, as was recommended by the Government of the Bight Hon’ble the Earl of Minto in paragraph 5 of their Secret despatch No. 188 (External), dated the 14th November 1907. We have the honour to be, Mr Lord, Tour Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) HABBINGE or PENSHUBST. „ O’M. CBEAGH. GUY FLEETWOOD WILSON. J. L. JENKINS. B. W. CABLYLE. S. H. BUTLEB.

From—The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To— Majoe P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to the correspondence ending with yonr telegram,* dated *No. 465 of secret e., Feb. 1908, Nos. 464-466. the 5th January 1908, I am directed to tTo secretary of state.

India regarding the proposed Order m Council conferring on the Political Agent at Bahrein jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in Bahrein. 2. I am to request that, as directed by the Secretary of State the Political Agent may he instructed to approach the Sheikh, with the object of obtaining from him, as a necessary preliminary to the issue of the Order in Council, a request that the British Government will relieve him of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in the Island, and that the result may be reported to this Department at an early date. No. 1863, dated Bushire, the 31st July 1909. From— Majob P. Z. Cox, C.SJ., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In reply to Poreign Department letter No. 1350-G., dated 15th June 1909, I have the honour to submit a copy with translation of the letter furnished to the Political Agent, Bahrein, by Sheikh Esa, asking Government to relieve him of responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners. 2. The text of the letter down to the words »foreigners only are con cerned,” is practically what was recommended to him by the Political Agent. The reservation contained in the remaining words is an addition ot the Sheikh s own. But as its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the Joint Court and gives foreigners the same treatment that British subjects now receive, there seems no need for exception to be taken to it, and I trust the letter as now received will be considered to suffice. If at any time the procedure in regard to British subjects is modified, by the same analogy foreigners would be covered by such modification. 3. The Sheikh’s indirect allusion to the Joint Court, however, makes it advisable for us to consider carefully in bringing out the Order m Council, the effect which the grant to the Political Agent of regular civil Powers will have upon the working of the machinary at present employed for the disposal of ffivil claims in Bahrein ; and the extent to which those powers if granted need be published for the present. . It would, however, be more convenient to go into this question with ot lers when considering in detail the terms of the Order in Council, when its issue is finally decided upon. Translation of a letter dated the 16th July 1909 (28th Jemadi II 1327), from Sheikh Esa bin Ali At Khalifa to Captain C. F. Mackenzie, Political Agent, Bahrein. (Received with Political Agent’s letter No. C.-2, dated 17th July 1909.) After compliments .—It is not hidden from you that I have had consider able trouble in many cases (that arose) in my territory m which foreigners were involved. For this reason I wish that I may not be held responsible in ftese cases and I would be grateful to ^ British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me. I mean that it (the British Gov ment) should exercise authority in all cases in which the foreigners only are concerned, but not in other cases; and in cases that occur between foreigners and my subjects, it is necessary that you and I should settle them jointly.2 ^£&gt; ■r No. 1-G. ; dated Fort William, the 16th November 1909 (Confidential). From—The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To— Major A. P. Trevor, in charge of the current duties of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. With reference to Major Cox’s letter No. 1863, dated 31 st July 1909, I am , , directed to enclose for favour of examina- tion and such alteration as may seem necessary a proof * of a draft of the proposed Bahrein Order in Council. The draft is based on the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907, with certain modifications taken from the Zanzibar Order in Council f of 1906 and the Somaliland Order in Council f of 1899. These modifications are indicated in italics. I am to request that you will kindly revise the draft and alter it so as to provide for any local peculiarities that may exist and specially with reference to the exercise of jurisdiction over foreigners, and in cases where the parties are of different nationalities. 3. You will observe that that part of the Persian Coast and Islands Order which deals with Registration has been omitted, since the Political Agent in Bahrein does not exercise Consular powers. I am to enquire whether you concur in this course. f Copies attached, vide — (i) pages 3345-3353 of The London Gazette, dated 15th may 1906, and (n) pages 440-447 of The Gazette of India, dated the 21st July 1900, Part I, (copies of both Gazettes enclosed. To he returned). No. 3134, dated Bushire, the 27th November 1910. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Officiating Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 1-G., dated 16th November 1909, enclosing a preli minary diaft of the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein, for examination and comment. 2. With concurrence of the Foreign Department, the subject was held oyer pending my return for leave in the Spring and subsequently the dissec tion of the draft disclosed so many points requiring full discussion between the Political Agent and myself that a great deal of time has necessarilv been expended and I am only now able to submit the result to Government for favour of further scrutiny. It comprises the joint views of myself Captain Mackenzie and Major Prideaux, who, as Agent at Bahrein from 1904 to 1909, has been chiefly and creditably identified with the marked consolida tion of our position winch has taken place since the presentation of the Ulti matum to Sheikh Esa in February 1905. i t \ 111 A 1 ! 11 1,( t remarked ^ liat a g° od many alterations have been suggested but 1 trust that I am not mistaken in thinking that in forwardino &gt; the draft for comment the Government of India realised that considerable modifications might be necessary in order to meet peculiar local conditions ; and in that belief I have ventured to regard the draft rather as having been sent us as a working basis than as a definite assertion of the views of Government, even in regard to fundamental points. ° 4. As regards most of the alterations suggested, I beg that the annotated copy now submitted with this letter may be accepted as in itself supplvin'- the needful explanation of our views in points of detail. There are certain primary questions however which it is necessary that I should touch upon here including the two subjects specially referred to in the Foreign Department communication above mentioned, namely, the question of the position of foreigners as regards jurisdiction under the order, and the need for Registration. 5. In the Foreign Department draft the definition of “Foreigner” was worded, A subject or citizen of a State in amity with His Majesty, other thanBahrein. It is now suggested that it bo altered to ee Any person not a subject of Bahrein ; the reason for the suggestion being that there are denominations among the inhabitants and frequenters of Bahrein of whom it can hardly be said that they come within the former category. Tinder present conditions the term “ Foreigner ” in Bahrein embraces ^ the following denominations in practice :— (i) Subjects of Christian Powers. (ii) Subjects of Turkey and Persia and other non-Christian Powers. (Hi) Dependents of petty Mohammedan Bulers on the shores or hinter land of the Gulfs of Persia and Oman, such as the Trucial Coast Shaikhs and the Iluler of Koweit, enjoying a greater or less measure of protection from the British Government. (iv) Natives of Katar or other semi-independent tracts not enjoying any measure of British protection outside Bahrein. Since the events of the winter of 1901-1905, ending with the Ultimatum to Shaikh Esa and the deportation of his nephew Shaikh Ali bin Ahmed, the protection or good offices of the Agency have been extended, when asked, to persons of all the above categories, and the usage has so far received the recogni tion and acquiescence of the Shaikh, that his officials are now in the habit of bringing members of them spontaneously to the British Agency for the investigation and adjustment of their claims. This development operates greatly in our favour, as enhancing our good name and influence among the trading classes of the Gulf and enabling the latter to obtain a measure of even-handed justice which otherwise they could hardly hope to get. It operates especially in favour of the diving fraternity, an oppressed and deserving class, who can now count upon getting fair treatment at the hands of the Salifah Court, which, but for our good offices, would often be denied them. It will be understood, however, that under this comprehensive definition of the term foreigner, the onus of protection which has gradually been forced upon us and of which we can hardly now divest ourselves, becomes a somewhat heavy one, and necessitates in my judgment, the provision of a system of Begistration for the restriction and control of it. On these grounds a set of regulations for Begistration has been included, under which a foreigner, while in any case subject to adverse jurisdiction of the Agency when necessary, will not be entitled to claim it unless registered. In paragraph 2 of the Foreign Department communication under reply it was stated that reference to Begistration had provisionally been omitted on the ground that the Political Agent does not exercise Consular powers, but as my opinion was asked on the subject, I presume that the application of regulations for Begistration by a Political Agent is not considered wholly impracticable on any technical grounds. 6. The third fundamental modification which has been suggested and which needs explanation here concerns the quarter to which Appeals shall lie from the Court of the Political Agenr. at Bahrein. In this connection it will be noted that in my Utter No. 76 of 25th February 1906 and in Government of India letter No. 1-G., 188 (Secret External) of 14th November 1907 to His Majesty’s Secretary of State, it was suggested that the District Court at Bahrein should he subordinate to the High Court at Bombay. The close examination of this question, however, from all points of view, has brought the Political Agents and myself to the unanimous opinion that it . will be against the interests of the Bahrein community, and our political interests, that Appeal should lie to the High Court, and it is therefore hoped that the Government of India will see their way to recommend that the Court of the Besident in the Persian Gulf be constituted the “Chief Court” for purposes of Appeals under this Order. I submit that the grounds in favour of the adoption of this course are cogent.firstly, it may be claimed under Article 4 of friendly Convention of 1861 with Bahrein, and by right of well-established usage since, that disputes between British subjects and dependants (now including foreigners since the Ultimatum of 1905), and Bahreinis on the other hand, are subject to the decision of the Political Resident should the British Agent and Local Authori ties fail to settle them satisfactorily. Secondly, the general understanding prevailing among the Maritime Arabs is that the Resident is the Chief Authority empowered to settle all their disputes in the Gulf. Reference to the Bombay High Court with the contingent possibility of the Resident’s decision being upset will tend to lower the prestige of the powers of intervention which he exercises by dispensation from Govern ment. The High Court is greatly disliked by Gulf Arabs on account of the long delays involved in settlement of suits therein ; the heavy expenses entailed by the employment of Pleaders, and the practical impossibility for principals to attend in person. The distance separating Bahrein and Bombay and the slowness of communication would inevitably militate against the ends of prompt justice which is the only form of the commodity which the community appreciates. Great difficulty, expense and loss of time would be incurred by sending witnesses and parties from Bahrein to Bombay. In fact it would very often be practically impossible to obtain the attendance of witnesses. Appeal to the High Court might not be so fraught with objection were British subjects the only people involved, as the Hindoo Firms often have representatives in Bombay, but it is undesirable to force such procedure on Bahrein subjects and foreigners, and were it done, the native public would undoubtedly prefer the crude and uncertain jurisdiction of the Shaikh to our own. 7. In dealing with the section of “ Bahrein subjects and Tribunals ” it has been no easy matter to devise articles which will, w r hile locally workable in practice, be compatible with the exigencies of an Order in Council. I need only say here that the articles now suggested are the result of much deliberation between the Political Agents and myself and will, we believe, meet requirements. Respectfully commending the draft now submitted to the wise consideration of Government.Enclosure No. 5. Telegram, No. 357, dated the 19th April 1911. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. Your telegram No. S.—243. I strongly advise equipment of Political A^ent at Bahrein with powers of Notary Public either by the terms of the Order in Council itself or by separate notification pursuant to it. British subjects and European foreigners are steadily increasing in numbers, and it (both) has proved in the past, and continues to he a great inconvenience to them that, whereas they cannot have Consular officers of their own to perform notarial functions for them either final or provisional, yet the British Gov ernment provides none. Such common requirements as the attestation of signatures to certificates of fact, &amp;c,, are constantly required.T (DRAFT) ORDER IN COUNCIL. At the Court at Buckingham Palace, the day of , 19 .
