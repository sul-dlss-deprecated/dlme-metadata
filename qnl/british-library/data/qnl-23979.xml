The Political Agent was in full dreff white. 3. On going on board the Political Agent was received with a Guard-of-Honour,which presented arms. He is not entitled to this compliment,but it was made,no doubt,because the guard /hr Sh+ifsA*, was already drawn up the-Ship and it would have been invidious to accord -the Siiaikh higher compliments tnan tne Political Agent. 4.

I would suggest that the official calls should be exchanged the next morning, though I see that it is uunday and you may prefer to put then off till Monday. 4. n the afternoon of the 20th January the .Shaikh will, think, be holding a kind of informal recs^ption in honour of his accession anniversary, with Arab dances and so on. He would, I jtnow, be very pleased if you would be present for a short time. 6. n the 21st January there will be the accession day aports, and I would propose to be 'At Home* on the ground, so that your Kxcellency will have a chance of meeting in informal circumstances the diaikh and his relatives, the rest of the British and American com unities and also certain of the leading notables and merchants* a ^cellency Vice Admiral F.F* Hose, C.B*, Naval Commander-in-chief, H.a.

The Shaikh will, I think, wish to invite you and a party of officers to dine with him in Arab fashion one night. ! t U ■ 8. I am afraid that this is rather a full programme, but time is short and the accession days are a time of rejoicing and both the Shaikh and the local people would greatly appreciate your being present. 9. It would add enormously to the gaiety of the occasion if you would allow your Band to play during the sports on the 21st January* 10. I hope that you and the Senior Naval Officer will stay with me on shore durin?: your visit and I will arrange for the Flag Lieutenant to stay nearby. 11.

Dated the 29th December 1934, i A small point has arisen in connection with the forthcoming visit to Bahrain of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief,that is the order of dress for orth, as he only possesses hot weather political uniform. 2. vorth tells me that in Bengal it is customary for members of the Indian Civil Service to attend official functions by day in dark blue lounge suits even when His Excellency the Oovemor is present and he has no morning coat with him. I do not know what is done by officers of the Indian Civil Service in, for example, the North-west-Frontier Province before they get their political uniform. 3. Fortunately .orth has appeared in uniform during the \ hot v/eather, so that his lack of uniform will not be so remarked locally as it might otherwise have been and I hope that His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief will agree to his c&lt;*nforming to the practice in Bengal on this occasion, as I certainly think that he should accompany me. 4. I am drawing up my programmes on the assumption that y/orth will accompany me, but I should be grateful, if you see no objection, if His lExcellency 1 s wishes could be ascertained and telegraphed to me before the final programmes issue to the Dhaikh and others about ten days before his arrival. ¥ fhe Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel r.C.

If they call on you first on board and Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah accompanies them I see no objection to your giving him compliment of interview. If however he does not call on you on board like the rest or if arrangement is that all the Shaikhs meet you on shore without first calling then I would be grateful if you would refuse to meet him. His attitude has been unsatisfactory for some years and besides recent removal of flag from Tumb Island he nas consistently refused to call on His Majesty^ Ships ( mut. ) Political officers including Resident.
