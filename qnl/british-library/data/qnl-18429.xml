The movements of vessels suspected of being used in the slave trade are being monitored by the British Government's Native Agent at Sharjah, Moollah Houssein [Mullā Husayn]. Hennell includes an English translation of a letter from Sultan ben Suggar, dated 17 December 1849, in which the Sheikh says that he has punished those of his subjects that Hennell (writing in an earlier letter) claimed were importing slaves from Zanzibar and Berbera.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100028714542.0x000010#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
