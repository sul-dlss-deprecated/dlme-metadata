She tells of her education and how she came to Egypt, marrying into a prominent Egyptian family, and of being hired at AUC in 1955 to teach philosophy courses and then English literature. Shoukri covers major changes at the university in her first decade, from the secularization of the university and the fading of its Christian missionary identity, to its evolving academics under Presidents Raymond McLain (unstable departments giving way to multi-disciplinary divisions) and Thomas Bartlett (hiring of more PhD level faculty members, recognition of departments by the Egyptian government, increasing emphasis on Arab culture and Egyptian identity). The emergence of the Department of English and Comparative Literature is covered (along with her parallel efforts to build the library’s literature holdings).  Shoukri speaks about the leading literary figures (like Angus Wilson, John Updike and John Cheever) whom the department hosted from the 1960s onward as part of the Distinguished Visiting Professor program that she initiated. She offers a portrait of AUC students, including the talented, cultured students (many of them from local ethnic groups) Shoukri taught in the 1950s, the multi-lingual women attending college in the 1960s after marriage and motherhood, 1970s female students who made up the majority of enrollment and who saw AUC as a place to find a spouse, and recent undergraduates less committed to their education. The case she and others made for retaining AUC’s liberal arts focus in the face of the professional business and engineering education introduced to attract more male students, and students’ and parents’ changing career preferences, are also discussed. Shoukri describes AUC during times of crisis in Egypt, first her departure to Switzerland during the 1956 Suez Crisis, and then the university during the period after the 1967 war (when she was the only foreign faculty member permitted to remain in Egypt), including how AUC operated during its period of sequestration by the Egyptian government (mentioning the beneficial impact of sequestrator Hussein Said). Effects of the Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak regimes on AUC, from student activism to reduced restrictions to a prominent 1990s censorship case, are also covered, as is the waning role of faculty involvement in AUC’s administration. </dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>oral histories</dc:type><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017; American University in Cairo.
