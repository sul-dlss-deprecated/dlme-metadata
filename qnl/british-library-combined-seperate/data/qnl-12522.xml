Many of the letters discuss the internal affairs of Persia and British policy regarding that country, mostly from the perspective of British officers and diplomats who are residing or have visited there. Reference is also made to Curzon's recent book,
                           Persia and the Persian Question, and the correspondence includes suggested revisions for future editions of the book. Notable correspondents include Albert Houtum-Schindler, Benjamin W Stainton, and John Richard Preece, British Consul at Ispahan.Also included in the file is a first proof of a paper by Captain Percy Molesworth Sykes entitled 'Recent Journeys to Persia', which was read at the Royal Geographical Society on 28 June 1897.The file concludes with a copy of a printed report entitled 'Persia: Biographical Notices of Members of the Royal Family, Notables, Merchants, and Clergy', dated December 1897 and compiled by Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Philip Picot, Military Attaché at Teheran [Tehran] for the use of the British Legation.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Benjamin W Stainton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>John Richard Preece</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Albert Schindler</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Military Attaché, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Percy Molesworth Sykes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002af#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002af#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002af#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
