With reference to our conversations during my recent visit to Bahrain regarding Shaikh Hamad’s accession. Shaikh Hamad as Ruler and, as arranged, you have doubtless formally informed him accordingly. I think, however, that it would be suitable if this intimation of recognition could be followed by a Kharita of congratulation from His Excellency the Viceroy, which I could present to Shaikh Hamad at a Durbar, say, in January. I enclose a copy of a pro posed Kharita modelled on the one sent by His Excellency to His Highness the present Sultan of Muscat. The Kharita would doubtless please the Shaikh, and its formal presenta tion by the Political Resident in open Durbar would mark the accession with the ceremony that is expected on such occasions. 5.

I pray that Your Excellency may live long to rule over your people, and that the State of Bahrain may advance in prosperity under your guidance.

It is to be regretted that - as I pointed out in my letter of l?th December last, ho.926-u - His . xcel.ency lacks those qualities which would smke him respected mad feared as a shaikh in addition to being liked as a man. 4. In the course of the speech which I made before presenting the Hharita, I took the opportunity, beside® cenve^xn^, to the atiaikh assurances of tne friendship of the Government of India arid of myself, of reviewing briefly the financial and general position of the utaW, of congratulating Hi a xceliency on certain economies which he had recently effected, and - with out being unduly pessimistic - of emphasising the fact that even further economies might be necessary in the future. It is an unfortunate fact that the number of individuals outside the Al Khalifa family who realise tne seriousness of the financial position of the htate is small* Both Colonel ' och and i there fore considered that some remark &amp; of this tenor would be bene ficial as likely to strengthen the hand of the Bimikh with regard to such economies as he had already' effected, or which it might be necessary for his Government to carry out in the future, .... i mmmmfuture, and would carry the more weight ae being delivered on a public occasion. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, ¥ ur most obedient oervant, sd/~ T.

I understand that at a recent interview between the Secretary to the Kon'ble the Political Resident (Captain Gastrell) &gt;: and the Governor of Bushire,the Governor said that he had heard a good deal about the ceremonies at Bahrain and enquired whether itvwas true that the status of the Shaikh had been altered,as he understood that the word ? melek T had been used in the speeches. | Captain Gastrell assured him that no alteration had been maae in the status of the Shaikh. 2. The word ’melek* was not,of course,used in the Hon T ble the Political Residents speech but it was usea in the course oi Shaikh Muhammad’s speech. The word is,however,not uncommonly used by local people in referring to the Shaikh. B. What the Governor may have got hold of is the fact that Shaikh Muhammad quoted in his speech an extract from a long poem of him,regarding the expulsion of Persians from Bahrain. 4.Another curious matter about which we must obtain full iniormation is the fact that it has got about in certain quarters, j amongst others the Shiah Wadhis,that the Ilon’ble the Political ^esiaent had said in his speech that the Government had agreed to forego the annual subsidy which was paid to them by the Bahrain Government and that it would no longer be paid, it is quite obvious that the basis of this idea is the reference to the customs duties,but it seems necessary to take steps to combat the idea of Bahrain ever having paid a subsidy or tribute. I have given Mr.Belgrave a copy of the Arabic of the Hon’ble the Political resident’s speech to show to the Shiah wadhis. h. I should like the Indian Assistant to make discreet enquiries as to whether this idea is at all widespread. b. The Indian Assistant should see this Note in confidence 2S-2-iyo3. P .A.
