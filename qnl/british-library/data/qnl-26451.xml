Jedda Report for December 1937. I .—Internal Affairs. 470. The King arrived in Mecca from Riyadh after Ramadhan and came to Jedda for a two-day visit almost at once (13th-15th December). He received the foreign representatives formally, and had a private conversation with His Majesty’s Minister and also, it is believed, with the Italian Minister. He seemed in very good health, though not in very good spirits. The visit made what is described as a “ season ' in the bazaar. Not only was all the fish and bread bought up for the royal party but the hangers-on, who seem to be paid with greater regularity than the State officials, made purchases of piece-goods, &amp;c., on a scale which caused a distinct movement in the sluggish trade of the town. 471. The Amir Baud, on his return from Bahrein (see below), landed at A1 Khubar on the 23rd December and in response to an invitation from C.A.S.O.C. went to Dhahran to see the oil wells. 472. The Amir Faisal came to Jedda on the 13th December for a few days, the main purpose of the visit being to receive the credentials of the new Egyptian Charge d‘AfTaires. He seemed less languid than usual, and in a chat with His Majesty's Minister showed unusual animation in finding subjects of conversation and in dealing with them when found. 473. Fuad Bey and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who came to Jedda with the King, both had business conversations with His Majesty’s Minister. Fuad Bey staved on for a few days after Ibn Sand’s departure. He had, while in Jedda, an attack of what he describes as a long-standing heart trouble. He certainly seemed very ill. 474. Sheikh Abdullah-al-Fadhl has been appointed assistant to the Viceroy of Mecca, the Amir Faisal. He retains his position as Vice-President of the Legislative Council. 475. The difficulty experienced in keeping track of the very numerous members of the Saudi Royal Family is illustrated by the fact that although neither the Amir Muhammad nor the Amir Khalid, brothers of the Amir Sand, accompanied him on his trip to Bahrein, the party included two Amirs Muhammad and two Amirs Khalid. 476. Except for an air display to celebrate the King’s arrival, and the rehearsals for it, no flying has been done this month. Six machines took part [230 d—1] 62 in the display, four being piloted by Saudi flight-lieutenants. Two of the Saudis flew Italian instructional machines, one the French monoplane, the Caudron-Renault, and one a three-engined Caproni. None of them, however, did anything but straight flying of the simplest kind. The two pilot-instructors also took part in the display, the Russian on the Bellanca and the Italian on a three-engined Caproni. 477. The “purely formal visit of Mr. Wallace, of the California Texas Oil Company (paragraphs 396 and 442) ended in his undertaking, after his interview with Ibn Sand, to supply the Saudi authorities at once with certain quantities of petrol and other oil products out of stocks now in Kenya. His story is that this represents an advance on account of quantities which C. A.S.O.C. will have to supply to the Saudi Government free when the Hasa wells begin to yield oil in commercial quantities. If this is correct it cannot in all probability be considered as an infringement of the contract between the Saudi Arabian Government and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company (Sudan), Limited, as agents for “ Shell” for the supply of all the requirements of the Government, those of the semi-official motor transport combine included. The area of the Gellatly, Hankey concession is not mentioned in the contract, but is tacitly understood to be the Hejaz. Mr. Lenahan represents the oil products from East Africa as a means of diminishing the Saudi Government's disappointment at the failure of C.A.S.O.C. to find oil in commercial quantities in Hasa. 478. Dr. Ghulam Mirza Rasul and Sub-Assistant Surgeon Ghulam Husain were shown the local hospital in Mecca by the Acting Director of Health. Their report shows that some advance has been effected. The X-Ray Department seemed to be working satisfactorily under a Syrian trained in Paris, the operating theatre was clean and tidy, and though the instruments were few they were at least in glass cupboards, and, moreover, there was a high-pressure steam steriliser. 1 he surgical cases appeared, however, to be all of a simple type. There was a modern disinfecting plant for patients’ clothing. About a hundred patients were waiting in the outdoor dispensary, but there were only eight patients in the medical ward, and the eye, ear and throat ward was empty owing to the absence of the doctor in charge. There was a laboratory, also under a Syrian, which was “ understood to be working properly.” 479. While the establishment of a system of wireless telegraph stations throughout the country does credit to Ibn Sand's spirit of enterprise and is an important factor in the maintenance of order, the skill of the operators is not always equal to the demands of western script, C.A.S.O.C., pending the establish ment of private wireless communication between Jedda and Hasa, suffer great inconvenience and sometimes serious delay from this cause, while the Riyadh wireless route for communication between His Majesty's Embassy in Bagdad and His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda was found, after a few experiments, to be hopeless, and had to be abandoned for the more expensive but more accurate route via Egypt, Confronted with European figures the wireless operator in Riyadh tended to treat them as boustroph ed onic , but as he was not consistent even in error the product of his industry was indecipherable. 480. The Saudi authorities have been thrown into consternation bv the death of the Indian who for years ran the Jedda condenser. This shows the scale on which the Saudi Government operates. The Minister of Finance, who is in charge of the condenser as of a hundred other miscellaneous duties, has appealed to Mr. Gusman, of the Legation staff, for assistance, and the essential service of the provision of water for Jedda is at present partly dependent upon the honorary spare-time work of a member of a foreign legation. 481. Heavy rain fell on Christmas day, a few days after the Jedda people, anxious at the unusual drought, had gone out in procession and prayed for rain. Even the miserable desert that comes up to the town gates usually produces some vegetation in winter, but none had appeared this year. The Jedda goats, always content with waste-paper, have been seen eating strawboard from packing-cases. 482. “ Progress ” is exemplified in a surprising wav by the regular appearance of advertisements for wireless sets in the Mecca newspaper, Saut-al- Hejaz. The wireless is still supposed in theory to be used for the reception of news or readings from the Quran, but these knobs are tricky things. Recently a car was noticed travelling in the desert near Jedda, crammed with armed Bedouin retainers of the Governor of Jedda, while from the wireless set inside[230 d— 1 ] b 2 came the voice of one of the B.B.C. ladies, spreading with the aid of a cuckoo clock the soft influence of the Children’s Hour. 483. The position of women is not affected by Saudi progress, and several well-educated Moslem ladies, wives of foreign officials, who follow European customs in their own country (India or Egypt), are mewed up in their houses in Jedda out of deference to the susceptibilities of Ibn Sand. One of these ladies, who was married in Egypt by proxy, came to Jedda by air (Misr Airwork) to join her husband. 484. The Amir Saud seems to have divorced the daughter of Nuri Sba’lan (paragraph 159 of 1936) a few days after his return from England. She is reported on very good authority to have left Riyadh with a new Buick car, a considerable sum in gold, the carpets of the house she had inhabited, and so on. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 485. The Amir Saud left Riyadh for the long-planned visit to Bahrein on the 9th December. At Hasa he was met by representatives of the family of His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein. He landed in Saudi Arabia again, after his visit, on the 23rd December. 486. It was announced that M. Martel, the French High Commissioner in Syria, was to pay a visit to Jedda in January. Fuad Bey informed His Majesty’s Minister that it was a purely private visit, and that it had arisen out of a wish expressed by M. Martel when he met Sheikh Yusuf Yasin during the latter's recent visit to Syria. (Later—The visit has been postponed.) 487. Two events have given occasion for references to Saudi Arabia and Syria as part of the great Arab world, viz., the floods in Syria and the so-called adhesion of the King of the Yemen to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance. A subscription for sufferers from the Syrian floods has been opened. The King contributed five hundred pounds gold, Fuad Bey and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin the equivalent of over thirty pounds each. The total raised so far is over £1,500. This has called forth a telegram of thanks from the President of the Syrian Parliament. The announcement that the King of the Yemen had ratified his adhesion to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance brought a telegram to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin from the Syrian Parliament, expressing gratification at the news and the hope that other Arab countries will eventually be included in it. The Saudi representative in Damascus also telegraphed, reporting demonstrations and messages of enthusiasm on the same subject. 488. The Saut-al-Hejaz publishes a leading article calling for subscrip tions to the fund for the relief of sufferers by the floods in Syria as a mark of “ brotherly sympathy for the great Arab community.” It reinforces the appeal by pointing out that even Palestine, though “ suffering from the activities it is undertaking, and striving with all its strength against the dreadful danger of Zionism,” has contributed to the assistance of ‘‘a member of our Arab fraternity.” 489. The local press has published a spate of treaties with the Yemen : — (1) Ratification by the King of the Yemen of his adhesion to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance. (2) Annex to the Saudi-Yemen Treaty of Taif of 1934, defining the frontier. (3) An agreement about the settlement of disputes which may arise between the Saudi and Yemeni subjects. The first of these instruments does not, strictly speaking, constitute adhesion to the original treaty, but (paragraph 255) is a new treaty concocted by the King of the Yemen by amending the old one as he pleased. The other two instruments are being examined. Ibn Saud has, however, ratified the instrument. 490. The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires hears that money was distributed broadcast in the Yemen on the occasion of the signature of the Italo-Yemen Treaty, to the extent that some Yemenis wrote, after the Italian negotiator had left, to complain of having received nothing, or less than so-and-so. 491. References to Iraq, Palestine and the Yemen by Ibn Saud in conversa tion with His Majesty’s Minister are recorded in the next section.III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 492. In his conversation with His Majesty’s Minister on the loth December, Ibn Sand referred to several matters of common interest: Iraq, the Yemen, the Italians, Saudi aviation, and the supply of arms and Palestine. 493. Iraq. —The King began with Iraq. This seemed surprising at first, but the immediate cause of anxiety was found to be that certain persons in Iraq (Nuri Pasha was referred to later) were supposed to be preparing schemes for settlement of the Palestine question “not in the interests of His Majesty’s Government or of Palestine, but from personal ambition.” The King also referred to the state of instability in Iraq. But he admitted that officially the Iraq Government had always behaved correctly, even in the time of Hikmet Sulaiman, whose Government, however, he was evidently glad to have seen the last of. 494. The Yemen. —After the conclusion of the Italo-Yemen Treaty, said Ibn Sand, he wrote to the Imam asking whether there was anything behind the treaty. The Imam assured him there was not, and Ibn Saud accepted this state ment, knowing the Imam to be a wide-awake man; but he would not answer for the Imam’s sons, nor for the Yemeni officials. 495. Arms. —Ibn Saud said that as His Majesty’s Government knew he did not want Italian arms, but did not want to offend the Italians. He refused the offer of Italian rifles on the ground that his forces were equipped with Mausers and he did not want to introduce another type, but the Italian Legation then offered to provide Mausers from Germany or Austria. The King pleaded poverty, but was assured that very easy terms would be arranged. Keeping to his delaying tactics the King said that if samples could be supplied he would study the matter, and there the question rested for the moment. Had he done right ? What would His Majesty’s Government say? His Majesty’s Minister replied in terms which had already been used at the Foreign Office in conversations with the Saudi Minister. His Majesty’s Government had supplied all the arms they could spare. Ibn Saud was the sole judge of his needs. It would evidently be safer to buy from neutrals rather than from a Government like the Italian which, as the King himself said, was not actuated by pure affection for Saudi Arabia; but if in the end he could not escape the Italian offer he would at least be acting with his eyes open. Ibn Saud said that he would continue to delay as long as possible, but there usually came a moment in such cases when a decision could no longer be postponed. It may be mentioned here that according to Fuad Hamza, who thought that arrival of a supply of arms from British sources (paragraph 382) had stimulated the Italians to greater efforts, the Italian Legation had offered to sell Italian guns, anti-aircraft guns, in fact any war material that Ibn Saud might want. 496 Saudi A viation. —Ibn Saud said again that he wanted to get rid of the Italians. He realised that to replace them by British or French might be awkward, but that would not apply to replacement by Moslems. Could His Majesty's Government recommend some suitable man from Egypt or Iraq? It was found that he had in mind a sort of chief of staff to advise him on all arms or, failing that, an expert to take charge of aviation. There are obvious objections to the proposal, but His Majesty’s Minister has recommended it as a means of eliminating the Italians and pleasing Ibn Saud. 497. Palestine. —Ibn Saud spoke with anxiety of his own position as dependent upon that of His Majesty’s Government, which was endangered by Zionism. Sir Reader Bullard noticed that, whereas in March it had seemed to Ibn Saud amusing that Mussolini should wave the sword of Islam, he now expressed astonishment at the extent to which, in spite of the notorious ill-treatment of Arabs in Libya, Mussolini had been accepted by the Arabs as their champion. The King could not agree that partition offered a hope of final settlement, but on the contrary considered that it would be a dangerous irritant; but he evidently could not believe that it would ever be effected. He seemed to think that alternative schemes were being examined without his knowledge, and expressed the hope that His Majesty’s Government would always communicate to him as early as possible any important information about their Palestine policy. On this last point Sir Reader Bullard was able to reassure him. To administerconsolation on the main issue was more difficult, but Ibn Saud was brought to admit the extraordinary difficulty of the situation of His Majesty’s Government by a question, to which he at once said “yes,” whether, in his rise from being ruler of Nejd to his present proud position, he had not found, at every stage in his progress, that political questions became more complicated as his points of contact with the outer world increased. 498. Throughout the conversation the King was friendly and reasonable. No reference, however, was made to the question which always touches him on the most sensitive spot, viz., the frontier of Saudi Arabia with Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhs, a subject on which a note had been sent in by His Majesty’s Legation a short time before. 499. The news that C.A.S.O.C. were showing signs of an intention to prospect in the Salwa region compelled His Majesty’s Government to make a com munication to Ibn Saud in order to forestall any attempt to prospect in the area in dispute. The communication, which was sent in by His Majesty’s Minister on the 4th December, was drafted, in accordance with Foreign Office instructions, so as to have as little as possible the appearance of an ultimatum. The note referred to the activity of C.A.S.O.C. near Qasr-al-Salwa, said that His Majesty’s Govern ment assumed that the company would not overstep the frontier proposed by His Majesty’s Government so long as no final agreement had been reached between the two Governments, professed readiness to reopen negotiations for a settlement on the lines already indicated, and suggested that a joint Anglo-Saudi commission should be appointed to clear up doubts as to certain topographical features. The note described again what His Majesty’s Government considered to be the rightful frontier. While this note was still awaiting a reply His Majesty’s Minister had an opportunity to meet both Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Fuad Bey. Sheikh Yusuf said that the basis of the King’s claim was that it was he and not the Amirs in the Persian Gulf who controlled and administered the area in dispute. He added that the King had referred to the note that morning and had asked whether the British wished to treat him as the Italians had treated Ethiopia and the Japanese China, and there is no reason to regard this as exaggerated, since the statement agrees with the protest which Ibn Saud made at the time of Mr. Rendel’s visit against what he describes as the “ hemming-in ” policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment on the Persian Gulf. Fuad Bey informed Sir Reader Bullard that C.A.S.O.C. had been told about the disputed territory, and that we need not fear they would take action in it. He, however, said that the oil company from the Gulf side had sent people into the disputed area, though he seemed to refer only to a survey of the position of Safaq (Sufuk), and he stuck to the Saudi position, the old arguments being repeated on both sides. He said that since the parties could not agree on principles the despatch of a mission would have no point, but Sir Reader Bullard said that we believed the Saudi claim to be based in part on faulty topographical information, and we wanted all doubt in this respect to be removed. Fuad repeated what is always Ibn Sand’s attitude on this topic : His Majestys’ Government always give him fair words, but never anything else. Sir Reader Bullard recalled to Fuad Bey several questions which had been settled in a sense favourable to the Saudi Government, and reminded him that the frontier they proposed represented enormous concessions beyond what His Majesty’s Government believe to be the Saudi Government’s legal frontier. Fuad Bey talked about compromise, but was unable to make any practical suggestion, even privately, for such a compromise. Nor could Sir Reader Bullard hold out any hope that His Majesty’s Government could make any further concession. 500. The frontier question was not mentioned at the interview which His Majesty’s Minister had with Ibn Saud on the 15th December. The Saudi reply, dated the 19th December, was received a few days later. It welcomes the suggestion that negotiations should be reopened, but asserts that if they have been abortive hitherto that is entirely because His Majesty’s Government “ do not agree to the actual situation of what is in reality in the possession and under the influence of His Majesty the King.” It enquires whether His Majesty’s Government do not agree that before sending a topographical mission it would be advisable to come to a final settlement of the frontier, by specifying either places or co-ordinates. Unfortunately, the portion of the note which dealt with the question of prospecting was badly drafted. It said that the Saudi Arabian Government had explained to C.A.S.O.C. about the points in dispute, and did not6 believe that it would “ go beyond what (the Saudi) Government believe to be within their territories,” and assumed that the companies operating in the Arab Amirates concerned would not cross the line as defined by the Saudi Arabian Government. The words quoted in inverted commas cover the disputed territory as well as what His Majesty’s Government are prepared to regard as Saudi territory; they do not agree with the sense of the paragraph as a whole, and they are at variance witb x what Fuad Bey had said. His Majesty’s Minister suggested to Fuad Bey that the ambiguous words should be corrected, but instead of adopting that simple way out of the difficulty Fuad Bey wrote a letter, in which he said that provided that the Arab Governments concerned would agree to abstention from the disputed area until an agreement should be arrived at, the Saudi Government were prepared to inform the C.A.S.O.C. of the necessity not to encroach on that area. This, in effect, gives an ultimatum to His Majesty’s Government. At the end of the month the attempt was still being made to return to the more seemly wording of the note of the 19th December, except for the amendment of the words quoted above which are obviously incorrect. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Minister is still for a policy of delay. The Jedda manager of C.A.S.O.C. has confirmed Fuad Bey’s statement about the instructions given to the company by the Saudi Government as to the territory in dispute. 501. It appears certain that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin tried to read some encouragement into a colourless statement about the Hejaz Railway (para graph 451) which was made to him by Jamil Mardam, President of the Council in Syria. The President appears to have said that while he was in favour in principle of the reopening of the line if it could be repaired, it had always been considered at Damascus that the Hejaz Railway was State property, and that each successor State inherited that portion of the line situated in its territory, and was responsible for any expenses relating to that portion. He even seems to have said that the Syrian Government had no intention of taking the initiative in embarking on negotiations on so delicate a question. His Majesty’s Government, after consulting the French Government, informed the Saudi Minister in London that they would not object if Ibn Saud thought a statement desirable. The Minister stated subsequently that the King had decided against the issue of a statement, but had asked for an early reply to the note of the 28th January, 1936. 502. This note of January 1936 about the Hejaz Railway does not appear to have been mentioned in the Jedda Report at the time. It was addressed to the British and French Governments, through their representatives in Jedda. It summarised the work of the Haifa Conference of October 1935 (paragraph 368 of 1935), and noted with regret the decision on item 3 on the agenda :— “ While recording the proposal of Fuad Bey Hamza to the effect that the reconstruction of the damaged sections should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole, the conference regretted that it had not been able to reach an agreed resolution on this important question. In these circum stances, the conference could only commend the matter to the consideration of the Governments concerned.” It drew some comfort from a statement by the representative of the Syrian section, who was described as saying that contribution by this section to expenditure on other sections had been envisaged by the Lausanne (Bompard) Declaration, though so far the Syrian section had, in fact, been working at a loss. Finally, the note declared that in the opinion of the Saudi Government the only possible solution was that the line should be considered as one and should bear as a whole the expenses to be incurred on the damaged sections south of Maan. The note invited the two Governments to accept this principle as a preliminary to a discussion regarding the method of raising the money for repairs. 503. His Majesty’s Government have under consideration the Saudi note of January 1936, but they consider that it will hardly be possible to give an early reply. Some of the complications of the subject were brought out a year ago when the Foreign Office instructed His Majesty’s Minister to give his views on a suggestion which had been made that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps l&gt;e justified on political grounds in considering the possibility of bearing them selves the cost of repairing the Saudi section of the Hejaz Railway. The viewsrecorded by Sir Reader Bullard, which received the approval of the Secretary of State, can be summarised briefly thus :— “ The railway is not necessary, and if it were rebuilt the Saudi authorities could never keep it running properly for more than a short time, i His Majesty’s Government are under no moral obligation to pay for the rebuilding of the line; they would get little credit if they did pay for it; our help would weigh for little in the mind of Ibn Saud, among other important considerations, and would be forgotten if the railway did not pay its way and became a burden; it is not to the advantage of His Majesty’s Govern ment that Ibn Saud should be saddled with another financial obligation; and the possibility of our being allowed to use the railway in time of war is so remote as to be, by itself, of very little weight.” Sir Reader Bullard added that some of the arguments he had adduced against the proposal would fall to the ground if it could be shown that railway receipts would cover the cost of maintenance and renewals, and that they would be used for that purpose. He was doubtful whether the receipts would suffice, and feared that the receipts would be swept into general revenues and the railway starved. 504. M. Sillitti, the Italian Minister, returned from leave on the 7th December. According to reliable information, the former interpreter to the Italian Legation, Muhammad Ali Dafer, is to reside permanently in Mecca, while M. Pastacaldi (paragraph 359), who hailed with such joy his transfer to Jibuti in September, is to be recalled to Jedda. The Italian shipping agency, Messrs. Lazzarini, which was formerly established in a house in the centre of the town, has moved to a house on the edge of the town, next to the Italian dispensary. Thus, within a distance of about 100 jmrds there are now four Italian buildings all sporting Italian flags on tall flagstafls as often as possible : the Legation, the Chancery, the dispensary, and Messrs. Lazzarini. 505. M. Delicata, the Italian mechanic attached to the Italian Legation, has applied for the post of condenser engineer (paragraph 256 of 1936). The Amir Faisal is reported as having said that in no case should Delicata be employed, as they “ had enough Italians already.” 506. The Japanese victories in China have attracted much attention in Jedda. In the more consciously C£ Nationalist ” circles they are represented as a victory of Asia (the Arabs being identified with Asia for the moment) over Europe. This conclusion is reached by supposing that Japan is only trying to save China from evil influences, and that one of the results of the war will be the elimination of Great Britain and America from China. In this version Italy and her friend Germany are, of course, on the side of Asia. 507. On the last day of the month His Majesty’s Minister received instruc tions relating to the communication to Ibn Saud beforehand of the terms of the despatch to Palestine defining the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the proposals of the Royal Commission of 1937. IV .—M iscellaneous. 508. Saiyid Lai Shah, Indian vice-consul, visited Mecca, where he w r as received with great amiability by Ibn Saud. The registration of Indian pilgrims is proceeding without friction and Saiyid Lai Shah has found the Saudi officials helpful, and has not been asked, as it was feared he might be, to communicate only with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 509. The air service between Jedda and Medina is to begin earlier this year—some five weeks before the hnjj. The return ticket will cost £9 gold. 510. An Indian company, the Scindia Steam Navigation Company (Limited), propose to enter the pilgrim-carrying trade this season, and they have appointed an agent (a British Indian) in Jedda and also sent a representative to reside here for the present. It is understood that they propose to bring two ship loads of pilgrims, and to send tvx&gt; ships after the pilgrimage for the return journey. This may lead to trouble, as not all the pilgrims who come by a given steamer can complete the visit to Mecca, which many of them wish to include, by a given date, since the supply of motor transport is limited and irregular and some do not travel by car, but by camel, or even on foot.8 511. It is reported from Bagdad that a number of Indian pilgrims have arrived there with the idea of going on to Mecca overland either by Nejef and Hail or, if that route is rendered too bad by rain, by Basra and Riyadh. 512. Wonderful things are told of the hotel at Mecca which has been built by the Banque Misr. It has, according to the taste of the narrator, 75, 100, 200, 250 rooms. It is certainly large, and affords better accommodation than any th r ‘Tm exists at present. There is a lift, and a bath-room with hot and cold water 'to each pair of rooms. It is not understood how the hotel can pay when the season is so short. 513. A long silence that followed the departure of the Soviet Minister on leave obviously aroused uneasy speculation in the minds of his staff in Jedda. It is now learned, however, that he has not joined Messrs. Karakhan and Krestinski, but merely fell ill on his way home, and is now recuperating in the Caucasus and “ spitting on the ceiling ”—the Russian equivalent of dolce far niente. 514. A respectable, pious Javanese pilgrim ran amok in Mecca on the 30th December. He attacked several people, walked quietly through the court yard of the great mosque, and then attacked several more. Fifteen persons were attacked (none of them British) and four are dead.In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. and address —not to any 'person by nam*, but/o— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S \ i: ' ■ . 1 . * G0NH1DENT1AL 3 0 9 \ ®&gt; THE Under-Secretary of State for foreign ^ffairs presents his compliments to and, by directum oi the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop-/ of the under-mentioned paper.

I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for November 1937. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list in paragraph 67. I have, &amp;c. 433. The rumour that the King would come to Mecca during Ramadan proved to be unfounded. It is now stated, though not officially, that he is coming to Jedda about the middle of December. 434. The Saut-ul-Hejaz of the 9th November announces that Muhammad- bin-Abdurrahman-al-Suweilim has been appointed Amir of Qunfada, and has already left for his post. 435. The local press announces the arrival at Mecca of Abdul Aziz-bin- Musaid, the Amir of Hail, for the performance of the Umra ceremony. He remained for a few days at Mecca and then left for Medina on the 17th November, on his way to Hail. 436. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was not drowned in the floods in Syria (para graph 378), but arrived back at Riyadh from Bagdad about the 16th November. 437. The Amir of Tebuk, who was recently in the limelight in connexion with rumoured military preparations against Transjordan, is said to have been seen at Jedda. Somewhere about the 15th November four cars were seen at the barracks, having brought four occupants, including the Amir and a Turkish gunner. After spending the night at the barracks they left at dawn, under conditions of great secrecy and in haste, the following day. They are said to have gone to Tebuk. What the explanation of this mysterious and very circuitous journey from Riyadh to Tebuk may be is unknown. 438. The Umm-ul-Qura of the 29th October mentions that Sheikh Taiyib- us-Sasi, having been granted a pardon by the King, has returned to Mecca and been received by the Amir Faisal. The sheikh was the editor of the Qiblah newspaper during the Hashimite regime; he fled to Aden, and subsequently to Lahej, on the fall of the Shereef. He is of Moorish extraction. 439. The Banque Misr collect an inclusive charge from every Egyptian pilgrim to cover not only the journey to and from the Hejaz, but also transport changes in the country and Saudi koshan dues. Against the koshan proceeds, it is under stood, the bank allow the Saudi Government to draw cheques up to £65,000 during the pilgrim season. This arrangement is perhaps responsible for rumours that Banque Misr was to be the State bank and to hold all State revenues on behalf of the Government. 440. Tenders for the construction of the road from the foothills near Jedda to Mecca have to be submitted to the Ministry of Public Works in Cairo by mid- December. That portion, it is announced, is to be asphalted, whereas the sandy stretch from Jedda to the foothills is to be treated by the Shell “ mix-in-place” method which has been tested with success on a short piece of road near the Medina Gate in Jedda; the surface sand is treated with crude oil, with which R.’ W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Jedda Report for November 1937. I .—Internal Affairs.T ■■Mm 2 it unites to form a hard crust. It is announced that all material needed for the road will be admitted customs-free and that a certain amount of foreign labour may be employed if indispensable. 441. According to Mr. Lenahan, of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, none of the drillings in Hasa have reached oil in commercial quantities, but none of them have gone beyond about 2,000 feet, whereas a very profitable well has been found in Bahrein at 4,000 feet. It is therefore intended to make a trial boring up to 4,000 feet at a place in Hasa, where the geological formation closely resembles that at the point in question in Bahrein. 442. Mr. Wallace, of the California Texas Oil Company (paragraph 396), has not yet seen Ibn Saud. He proposes, however, to stay on for a while. Outside sources credit him with the desire to obtain the monopoly for the supply of oil to the Saudi Government from Bahrein, and to oust the Shell Company, whose contract is about to expire. 443. A Misr-Airwork aeroplane, A l Boraq, arrived from Egypt on the 19th November carrying as a passenger the Amir Fahad-bin-Faisal, a member of the Saudi Royal Family and brother of the Amir of Buraida. It left three days later with Dr. Muhammad Ali Bey-al-Shawwaf, who is to represent the Saudi Government at the conference on trachoma at Cairo. 444. A Workmen's Compensation Act, apparently in draft form, has been circulated to the foreign concession companies by the Saudi authorities. As is usual in cases where the employers are foreigners and the employees local subjects, the compensation provided for is immensely larger than the local Government would ever pay—if indeed they paid anything. The compensation is stated to vary from £9 for a finger to some £300 for a major disability. The text has not appeared in the press. 445. On the 2nd October the period of one year, during which slave-owners were required by the Saudi regulations to register their slaves, expired. Efforts have been made since that date to ascertain, by unofficial enquiries, exactly what steps have been taken to implement the various provisions of the regulations. I he result of those enquiries is as follows (it must be regarded as provisional only, and liable to revision) :— 446. 1 he Director-General of Police at Mecca has been appointed Inspector of Slave Affairs, and his assistant deputy inspector (article 13 of the Saudi Instructions'); the police throughout the Saudi Arabian Kingdom are the competent authorities for the purpose of the registration of slaves (article 9); no six-monthly report (article 14) has been heard of ; licences to certain slave-brokers have been issued, notably to two persons at Jedda; one or two slaves only have been registered at Jedda, but a good many have been registered at Mecca. There is no reason to believe that any slaves in any other parts of the country have been registered. A large number of slaves in this country have therefore the right to present themselves before the competent authority and to “demand a certificate of freedom (article 10), but it seems improbable that any slaves, if they ever learn of this right, will take advantage of it. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 447. On the last day of the month a telegram which has yet to be studied was received from the Foreign Office, regarding the activities of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in the Salwa region (paragraph 395) and the effect of such activities on the question of the Saudi Arabia-Qatar frontier. 448. Muhammad Shaiko, a junior official in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who acts as private secretary to Fuad Hamza, went to’the Yemen in October and returned recently. It is understood that he was sent to the Iman by Ibn Saud in connexion with the Treaty of Arab Friendship and Alliance. 449. The Damascus newspaper Office Arabe gave an interesting report on the 25th October on Sheikh Yusuf Yasin's activities in Syria. A local committee invited him to a reception and he addressed them in the following terms: People used to think that the Arab nation had been wiped out, but God had willed other wise. He had been engaged in negotiations with the Syrian Government with a view to a Treaty of Friendship. He had come in no haggling spirit, but as a brother who meets with other brothers in one house and for one object. They could not look upon the two Governments as two, but as one Arab Government.He hoped that the endeavours made to uphold Arab unity would prove successful notwithstanding the long and difficult path leading to that end. 450. The Saut-'id-Hejaz gives what is perhaps another version of the speech published in the Office Arabs. It says that the speech was given by the Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at Damascus at a banquet given in his honour by the ‘ ‘ Society of National Affairs.” Arab unity, said Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, is the goal. Every Arab is thinking of it. The way is long, difficulties seem insurmountable. The crusades 700 years ago did not crush the Arabs. The Arab nation had not been annihilated; the Qur’an still existed, and the Arab language. He did not come to negotiate as with a foreign Power. The Government of Syria and the Saudis were brothers. Their interests were the same and they must therefore work together towards the common goal. 451. Further darkness was shed on Sheik Yusuf Yasin's activities in Damascus by the Saudi Minister in London on the 27th October. The Minister started by referring to a previous conversation about the agreement reached with Syria, concerning the Hejaz Railway. He afterwards telephoned to say that there had been a misunderstanding and no definite agreement had been reached between Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and the Syrians. He subsequently explained in writing that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, while in Syria on holiday, was informed by the Syrian Government that they were prepared, if the Saudi Arabian Government agreed, to issue a declaration to the effect that both Governments had already agreed to negotiate with the French and British Governments for the repair of the railway. King Ibn Saud, however, had abstained from agreeing to this agreement to agree before finding out what the British Government thought of the matter. The following points seem to emerge : (1) Sheikh Yusuf Yasin probably negotiated nothing definite in Syria, and (2) the King has been very cautious in dealing with whatever agreement he tried to negotiate. 452. Many rumours about arms and about new developments on the northern frontiers of this country have been reaching Amman lately. On the 8th November it was reported that the King intended to visit Tebuk shortly and drive along the frontier. No confirmation was forthcoming at Jedda; it appeared improbable that the King would make such a journey of inspection during Ramadan, and in fact the journey was not made. At this distance it seems likely that the following elements enter into the Saudi activity on the frontier :— (1) Continuance of the policy of pushing forward in order to find out where we think the frontier is. (2) Increase in the number of machine guns, out of consignments known to reached Saudi Arabia recently. (3) Slow increase in the number of “regular” troops on the Transjordan frontier as elsewhere in Saudi Arabia. (4) Greater truculence of Saudi posts, due partly to the Palestine question and partly to the discovery that the Transjordan authorities have not challenged their occupation of certain points, e.g., Tutun. 453. The Saudi Arabian Government were informed, in reply to their remonstrance (paragraph 350), that the Transjordan frontier post in question had been withdrawn. The post was at Sharia, not, as stated in paragraph 350, at Tutun, which is admitted to be in Saudi Arabia. Sharia is apparently quite close to the frontier. The Transjordan authorities believe it to be on their side, but do not wish to enter into an argument on the point at the present time. 454. The Mecca press has been restrained on the subject of Palstine. The reports perhaps pay more attention to attacks on Arabs than to attacks on Jews, but it is not more biased in that direction than the English press is the other way. One article stated that the Secretary of State for the Colonies was mistaken in believing that there was any “ moderate ’’ Arab elements in Palestine, if by that he meant Arabs in favour of partition. III.— Relations with Powers outside A rabia. 455. Four Arab horses (two stallions and two mares) have been despatched to England as a present from the Amir Saud to His Majesty King Geroge VI, as the result, it is understood, of a conversation between His Majesty and the Amir Saud at Ascot. At the same time, and at very short notice, three milch camels and a male camel were sent to Jedda for despatch as a present to the [180 ee—1] B 2London Zoo. In this case the motive power behind the gift is believed to be the passion of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Minister in London, for camel’s milk. The despatch of these eight animals by one small Pharaonic steamer, and with the limited resources of Jedda, presented great difficulty, but they were eventually shipped, and successfully transhipped at Port Sudan on to a British India steamer. 456. The Umm-ul-Qura reports the forthcoming establishment of a British broadcasting service in Arabic, and quotes an article from the News Chronicle, saying this is a regrettable necessity, forced upon His Majesty’s Government by anti-British propaganda by certain wireless stations, and that the object will be to give accurate news, and not such broadcasts as are made by certain Governments. 457. On the 6th November the doorkeeper of the Italian Legation left with one of this Legation’s servants a little pamphlet addressed to Ismail Effendi, the 11 translator of the English Legation.’’ The pamphlet is a translation in Arabic of the preface to a book by General Adriano Alberti, giving an account of the activities and victories of the Italian troops during the Great War, and trying to prove that Italy displayed during that trying period both bravery and a sense of justice. 458. Mme. Ghersi, wife of the Italian doctor, who. with her husband, lives above the Italian Legation dispensary, stated, in the course of a casual conversa tion, that the floor intended for beds for patients was still vacant; she did not know why. This may mean that the Saudi authorities still refuse to allow the establishment of anything like a foreign hospital in the Hejaz. 459. Abdul Hamid Bey Munir, who has been Egyptian Charge d’Affaires in Jedda since the Egyptian Legation was created, has been transferred, and. according to the Egyptian press, a certain Elias Ismail Bahrawi is to succeed him. Nominally, Egypt has a Minister at Jedda, but the holder of the post, Abdul Rahman Bey Azzam, has never appeared here, and the staff of his Legation state that he is not expected to come. 460. The Mahmal is not to come even as far as Jedda this year, but to stay at Suez, though the Holy Carpet will be sent to Jedda to be forwarded to Mecca. It is not known whether this is a consequence of the shabby reception given to the Mahmal at Jedda last season, or whether it was provided for in the Saudi-Egyptian agreement, and last year’s arrangement was a half-way stage to save the face of the Egyptian Government. 461. The Indian newspaper Nizam of Karachi, published in its issue of the 1st October last the following statement, which seems very improbable ; “ News from Bagdad. On the initiative of Kemal Ataturk, the Turkish Parliament has sanctioned the despatch of ten anti-aircraft guns to Medina and Mecca for the protection of the Holy Places from aerial attack in the event of war.” IV .—M iscellaneous. 462. Sir Reader Bullard returned from leave on the 24th November. 463. H.M.S. Londonderry (Captain W. K. D. Dowding, D.S.C.) visited Jedda for the first time on her new commission from the 7th to the 12th November. The formalities were observed as usual. The kaimakam provided some comic relief by visiting the ship just twenty-four hours before the time appointed for his visit. He at once acknowledged his mistake, tapped his forehead, mui’muring: “ It’s due to the Ramazan fast,” and went away, to return at the right time and receive his proper honours in great good humour. 464. Rumours of the Nizam of Hyderabad’s intention to make the pilgrimage this year, accompanied by a large suite of some 400 persons, have caused great pleasure. His Exalted Highness is said to be coming via Syri,a and Iraq. ' * 465. The Indian vice-consul, Saiyid Lai Shah Bukhari, paid a visit to Mecca, where he was received by the Amir Feisal and certain other heads of departments. He was accompanied by the new Legation doctor. 466. The wife of His Highness the Raja of Perlis, one of the Unfederated Malay States, arrived here for the pilgrimage on the 21st November. No official intimation of her coming has been received by this Legation, but the Malay pilgrimage officer paid her a formal visit to assure her that all proper assistance would be rendered to her by this Legation.5 ill 467. The local press announces that nearly 17,000 pilgrims from overseas have already arrived in the Hejaz. 468. A sous-directeur of the Ottoman Bank at Cairo, Mr. I ewfiek Aboucassem, visited Jedda during the month. He had previously been at Jed da, some twenty years ago. His mission was to collect a few debts outstanding from the time when there was a branch of his bank at Jedda, and to make a report for his bank on the economic condition of the country. He stated that he had hopes that a branch of the Ottoman Bank would again be opened here. He realised that the local Government would probably do their best to raise a loan from such a branch, and he considered that such a loan would be possible if based on the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s royalties. Mr. Aboucassem thought that the Banque Misr was not popular with the Saudi Arabian Government, who consider that that bank cheated them over the Egyptian trust funds, on which they had hoped to lay hands, but which the Banque Misr received direct from the Egyptian Government for expenditure on development in the Hejaz. Other points dealt with by Mr. Aboucassem were (1) the quality of the local wool, which he thought was very good; (2) the attempt by the Polish Legation in Cairo to collect from the Saudi Arabian Government a debt of about £3,000 for arms supplied; and (3) the fact that the Saudi Arabian Government are heavily indebted to the Netherlands Bank, and consider that the bank charges interest at too high a rate. 469. In the absence of M. Khakimoff on leave, the Soviet Legation is run by an ingenous Kirghiz youth, Ali Fattahoff. He often reveals his simplicity, but he surpassed himself in a conversation which he had with Mr. Trott of this Legation a few days ago. He was complaining that the servants in Jedda were bad, and that a servant employed in the Soviet Legation had decamped with a considerable sum of money belonging to his master. Fattahoff: “ It wasn’t so much the money I minded. But you know we have cyphers! Trott: “ Not really ! ” Fattahoff: “ We have, indeed, and I carry the keys in my pocket. He might have stolen them ! And if I lost the cyphers they’d shoot me.” Trott: (A very sympathetic noise). Fattahoff: “ They would. They’d say I had sold them.”THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTIT’OT 1 *P'« 8 tiTANN.JC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT * • JLA - EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. 1938 November 29, 1937. Section 1.

Apart from that interlude, he seems to have spent the month at Riyadh, attended by Fuad Hamza. Certain tribesmen visited the capital in accordance with the usual practice, in order to collect their subsidies from the King. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin visited Damascus in October, and on the 28th October left Damascus for Bagdad; according to an unconfirmed report, he was drowned in the Damascus floods on the way. The lack of confirmation of this rumour probably indicates that it emanates from one of his many enemies. 379. Practically nothing has been said in the local press on Palestine. The vested interests connected with the pilgrimage are much too busy spreading propaganda designed to show how admirable are the arrangements for pilgrims to devote their time to arguments about the Palestine Arabs. They know well that trouble in neighbouring countries means fewer pilgrims. 380. Information from the office of the High Commissioner for Palestine states that on the 1st October certain notables of Gaza addressed a telegram to Kings Ibn Saud, Ghazi and Farouk. saying that His Majesty’s Government was pursuing an oppressive policy of terrorism; the president of the Supreme Moslem Council had been deprived of his offices and many persons arrested. ‘ k Your sons the inhabitants of Palestine appeal to your Majesty to rescue them from these oppressions. History will record what the Arab Kings will do in this decisive hour to rescue the Arabs of Palestine.” Ibn Saud does not appear to have made any reply, and no reference to this appeal appeared in the local press. 381. The King seems to have spoken with a double voice on the question of Palestine. His Majesty’s Government explained to him through two channels the reasons for the recent action taken by the Palestine Government in the interests of good government and public order. One channel was a note addressed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The other channel was an oral communica tion on the same lines made to Sheikh Hafez Wahba by Mr. Rendel at the Foreign Office on the 5th October. His Royal Highness the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied on the 13th October in very mild terms; the Amir Faisal hoped that His Majesty’s Government would succeed in finding the best solution for the establishment of public order and peace in a form which maintains the prestige of Government and secures the interests of the natives of the country. ...” It is almost inconceivable that the King did not approve and sanction this reply. But on the previous morning the Saudi Minister called on Mr. Rendel and spoke to him in very different terms: ‘‘the King felt strongly that in arresting these [155 ff— 1 j B'1 ms® r persons we had punished the innocent and not the guilty. There was no evidence to show that they were responsible for the murders .... the Arabs were convinced that our main object had been to get rid of the leading critics of our policy of partition ” It is permissible to wonder how much of this emanated from the fertile and biased minds of Yusuf Yasin and Fuad Hamza, and why the written word had been so different from the spoken. *182. 1 he arrival at Jedda on the 17th October of the arms and ammunition recently purchased from His Majesty’s Government seems to have given rise to an extraordinary crop of rumours. A German ship had recently supplied arms; an Italian ship had landed 1,000 camel loads secretly at Ruess (a village near Jedda), whence they were secretly transported to Mecca; Ibn Saud was preparing to make war on Iraq, on the Yemen, or on Transjordan; all the other Arab countries were going to make war on him because he is too pro-British; he was mobilising 60,000 troops at Riyadh, and so on. Actually, what happened was that the steamship Tabaristan began to land the munitions at Jedda on the 17th October; a half-hearted and absurd attempt was made to keep the matter secret by dumping all the cases on the shore north of Jedda instead of at the usual quay; and what must have been a record number of camels was impressed to transport the heavy cases, &amp;c., to the interior, assisted by a few lorries. It took them several days to move the whole consignment. 383. Local rumours continue to say that the King, contrary to established practice, will visit Mecca during Ramazan, and will therefore probably visit Jedda, too; and that he will visit Medina, for the first time as a King. 384. A dispute between the Amir Saud and the Amir Faisal is also- reported; their father is said to be trying to act as mediator. 385. Colonel and Mrs. Dickson from Koweit paid a private visit of a week’s duration to King Abdul Aziz at Riyadh, leaving Koweit on the 23rd October. 386. Abdullah Suleiman seems to have stayed at Mecca during the first week of October. The Ministry of Finance transferred its headquarters to Mecca, with the Ministry for ioreign Affairs, early in the month. Abdullah Suleiman visited Jedda towards the end of the month and had many conversations with the Dodge agents. 387. According to the press, His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal passed most of the month shooting at a place named Soja. His Ministry, so far as it functioned at all, seems to have confined itself to moving its offices io Mecca from Taif. He himself left his summer residence at Taif on the 26th October and proceeded to Mecca. 388. The Egyptian newspapers during this month seem to have been very hard up for copy, and to have supplied the deficiency of news by inventing sensational reports about Aqaba and the Transjordan frontier. 389. The Cairo journal Al Masri on the 5th October, for instance, quotes from its Jedda correspondent a long story about the sinister designs of His Majesty’s Government on Aqaba. It seenis that Major Jarvis’s article in the Morning Post of the 28th September, 1937, has been the source of inspiration. A railway is to be built from Aqaba to the north of Maan for strategical reasons. Haifa will thus be connected with Aqaba, and an alternative to the Suez Canal will be opened. But, the editor remarks, we do not think that this project is likely to be realised except by friendly discussion with Ibn Saud, and even then only the year after next, when the Treaty of Jedda expires. Ibn Saud, however, is apprehensive about the plan, not only on account of its bearing on his sovereign rights, but because it may lead to a still further plan, viz., the linking of Maan with Basra, by rail, leading to another route to India.” 390. The Al Ahram of the 12th October has the following message from its “private correspondent” at Amman, who is careful to state at the beginning that, though he believes the report to be true, he sends it with all reserve. New military posts are being established by the Saudi Arabian Govern ment on their northern frontiers at five places : one near Aqaba, a second near Zat-ul-Haj, a third at Al-Masheetiyah, 2 miles from Mudawwara station, a fourth at Al Tsawiyyeh in the Wadi Sirhan, and the last near Al Amri fort. The names of two new detachment commanders are given. Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid, the Amir of Hail, was reported on the 10th October to have arrived at the Transjordan frontier in order to command a large force. These activities caused the Transjordan authorities a great deal of anxiety, to such a3 degree that the commander of the Arab Legion took up his Mudawwara, and aeroplanes were moved from Amman to - T J d force having occupied Masheetiyah, it withdrew on the appioach ot the detachment n ^ 15th 0ctober however, the Umm-ul-Qura wuntlly &lt;lemed these rumours of mobilisation on the Transjordan frontier saying that y absolutely without foundation; and as for the Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid, ne had been' at Riyadh all the time and was still there. , , , , v ; s ; t ed 39-2. Haji Abdul Majid, the Malay pilgrimage officer who had lately vts t Mecca, reported on the 13th October that when the mema supporting tl^ protests of their brethren in Egypt proposed a jehad Jf e K I'f,’ t if g th e manv local hot-heads in Medina, laif and Mecca volunteeied tc g , King would pay their expenses.

[155 ff—1] B * 2III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 399. The Dutch Charge d 5 Affaires. M. C. Adriaanse, arrived back at Jedda on the 4th October. He was accompanied by a Dutch bacteriologist, named Van der Hoog. 400. M. Kerim Khakimoff, the Soviet Minister, left Jedda for long leave in Russia on the 13th October. He left M. Fattahov in charge of the Soviet Legation. &gt; 401. The Saudi Charge d'Affaires in F,gypt, Sheikh Fauzan-al-Sahiq, arrived at Jedda on the 26th September and left for Taif and Riyadh to see the King. 402. The Tripoli newspapers in mid-October arrived at the Italian Legation by bag. Any visitors to that Legation, who appear likely to be interested, received these newspapers gratis. In this way the local employee of the telephone office, who calls at the Legation every month to collect the telephone bill, brings away a few copies of such papers as the Adi of Tripoli. He recently received No. 506 of that paper, dated the 16th September; it contained a long article entitled : “ The methods of European colonisation.” which set forth in some detail the manifest advantages of the Fascist system over the bad methods of colonisation practised by the British and the French. The British, says the paper, are embezzling the wealth of their colonies to supply their own luxurious needs. Hence demands for secession from Ireland. Canada, India and South Africa. 403. Towards the end of October the Italian Legation was again receiving Tripoli papers through the local post, and its Abyssinian servant, named Bata or Batha, has been to Mecca armed with a large batch of the Adi and Shard-Libyd newspapers. The paper the Rac/ib-ul-Atid has not recently arrived; its editor and proprietor having died, it appears to be defunct too. 404. An Italian sloop named Panthera arrived on the 21st and left on the 26th October bound for Massawa and Jibuti. 405. A local pilot, named Ibrahim, complained that he was owed nine sovereigns for pilotage, and that when he applied to the Italian Legation he got nothing. 406. The pilot also said that the Italian ratings had one or two brawls in the bazaar, taking goods without paying for them; and that one shopkeeper actually hit one of the ratings for stealing a cigarette lighter from his stall. It appears that certain ratings were allowed shore leave all night; and that they were greatly incensed at the absence of places of entertainment in Jedda suitable for seamen. 407. M. Bachir, a Tripoli Arab who has had previous experience of Jedda, returned hither on the 12th October to take the place of M. Bellini at the Italian Legation, who will not return from Rome. 408. Colonel Ciancio, the Italian aviation adviser, left Jedda, to his own great relief, on the 20th October. He handed over his duties as instructor and supervisor of the Italian mechanics to Brevet-Major Ciccu, who has been in Jedda in similar employment before. IV .—M iscellaneous. 409. Haj propaganda continues to dominate the local press. Sheikh Ibrahim-Us-Shoora, a member of the Haj propaganda bureau, came from Egypt at the end of September. Optimistic estimates of bumper pilgrimages from Tunis, Algeria, Morocco and Java are given by the Umm-ul-Qura, while its rival the Saut-ul-Hijaz estimates the Javanese pilgrimage this year as likely to reach 20.000, and to include “ the Prime Minister, Raja Ahmed,” with his family. 410. Pilgrims from the Netherlands East Indies have begun to arrive, the first steamer being steamship Polyphemus, which left Java on the 28th August. Twelve vessels have been chartered for this traffic, as compared with four last year; this remarkable increase reflects economic revival and the improved purchasing power of the native population of Java, particularly in the outer islands. The number of pilgrims last year was about 4,000; this year many more are expected. On the other hand fears that the Chinese war will spread to Java and the fall in the price of rubber have tended in the opposite direction.411. The North African pilgrimage will probably be adversely affected by the fall in the exchange value of the franc; pilgrim dues have to be paid in gold or the equivalent. 412. A large Nigerian pilgrimage is expected. 413. The Hejaz Bureau of Pilgrimage Propaganda has been very busy during the month. Its notices in the papers have emphasised the peacefulness of the country, the prodigious numbers of new cars (the number is given as 360) which have recently been imported for the comfort of pilgrims, and the obligatory nature of the prophet’s directions to perform the pilgrimage; 4,788 pilgrims were stated to have arrived already at Jedda up to the 8th October, and 9,578 up to the 22nd October. 414. Ismail Ghuznavi's agents in India have also been busy. The Lahore paper Zamindar puts the number of pilgrims expected at Mecca at 100,000. 415. The Indian pilgrimage proper began by the arrival of the steamship Jehangir on the 25th October. She brought 616 pilgrims, 523 of whom were Indians. A nephew of the ruler of Bahrein, named Sheikh Hamid-el-Khalifa, was on board; he was escorting the wife of the eldest son of the ruler. 416. News reached Jedda during the month that Sir Firoze Khan Noon, High Commissioner for India, performed the naming and launching ceremonies of a new pilgrim ship at Glasgow on the 22nd September. She is called El-Medina, of 4.000 tons, with accommodation for 850 passengers, and she was built for the Scindia Steam Navigation Company. 417. A new overland route for Syrian pilgrims is announced in the Saut-ul-Hijaz of the 19th October. Transport companies in Syria, we are told, are discussing the development of a pilgrim route from Damascus via Amman, Tebuk and Medina. 418. The same paper says that the Mecca-Jedda and the Mecca-Arafat roads will be paved soon, the work being commenced in the month of Ramazan (i.e., in November). 419. A recent number of the Saut-ul-Hijaz publishes a lengthy article on the amenities of Jizan. No reference is made to the vexed question of postal communications between that port and Kamaran, but various improvements in the port and in educational and economic matters are described, in the form of a “ question and answer ” debate between the editor and one Seyyid Muhammad-el-Hadi, a school teacher of Jizan, who spent some time recently at Mecca. 420. A school for teaching English is being opened at Mecca on the 1st October, according to the local press. 421. The Egyptian Government, according to the Umm-ul-Qura of the 8th October, recently invited the Saudi Arabian Government to appoint a repre sentative to attend an international conference on trachoma, to be held in Egypt early in December. The Saudi Arabian Government have appointed Dr. Muhammad Ali-al-Shawwaf to represent them. 422. The Minister of Finance is spending a good deal of money on the “ fort ” petrol and oil store at Muwaih, on the road from Mecca to Riyadh The original building is being enclosed by a masonry wall some 18 inches thick by 9 feet high. The area now enclosed is approximately 50,000 square feet. 423. A new garage and service station is to be built at Jedda by the local Dodge agents; construction began during October. 424. Two German mechanics have been at Jedda for some time, engaged in erecting and testing the newly received Mercedes-Benz and Krupp Diesel lorries for the Saudi Arabian Government. One of them left for Germany during the month. 425. The Minister of Finance gave a banquet at Mecca early in October in honour of Abdul Aziz-al-Nooti, the Egyptian date-packing expert, who was due to leave for Egypt soon after. 426. The opening of a new telephone line between Mecca and Taif is recorded with pride in the Umm-ul-Qura of the 15th October. It is said to work perfectly, which is incredible. 427. The Ministry of Public Works at Cairo on the 15th October called for tenders for the macadamising of the two roads from Mecca to Jedda and Mecca to Arafat. As the adjudication was not to take place till the 13th December, there will not be a great margin of time left if the roads are to be ready for the pilgrimage early in February.6 4*28. Seyyid Lai Shah Bukhari, M.A., who succeeds the Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, M.B.E., as Indian vice-consul, arrived at Jedda on the 25th October. 429. The new Indian medical officer, Dr. Mirza Ghulam Rasul, M.B. r D.F.H., arrived by the same boat. Dr. Abdul Hamid, his predecessor, left for Bombay by the same steamer on its return journey. 430. * Dr. Rasul has obtained from the Saudi Arabian Government a licence to practise only in his two dispensaries, at Jedda and at Mecca. The question whether a fresh attempt should be made to obtain from the local authorities a licence to have a private practice at Jedda is under consideration. At present Dr. Rasul is actually treating private patients in Jedda who request his services, in the same manner as Dr. Abdul Hamid used to do; so far no difficulties have been encountered. It is understood that the new Italian doctor, Dr. Ghersi, has a licence for his dispensary only, and that he has applied, hitherto without success, for a licence to practise privately, although the Soviet Legation doctor has a licence for private practice. 431. The steamship agency of the German “ Hansa ' line has been transferred from the firm of Fadhl Arab to that of Alireza. 432. A new broadcasting service, in Arabic, from Jerusalem was started on the 17th September; it is called the “ London-Jerusalem Direct News Service.” The Kaimakam of Jedda says that he listens to it occasionally, and thinks it is quite good. On being questioned as to the suitability of the particular form of Arabic used, he replied that the language of the announcer was excellent. rTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). , — _ October 29, 1937. / 1 ' ■ X CONFIDENTIAL. 1 _ _ Section 1. i / / 94 1 [E 6387/S80/2S] L IS5 7 Copy No. Mr. Trott to Mr. Eden.—{Received October 29.)

I have, &amp;c. A. C. TROTT. Enclosure. Jedda Report for September 1937. I .—Internal Affairs. 333. The King has remained at Riyadh during the month. Mr. Ousman r who was employed there most of the month (see paragraph 267), reports that His Majesty followed his usual routine. Towards the end of the month the tribes came to Riyadh for their annual subsidy. The King has been hunting on several occasions and was intending to hunt again when Mr. Ousman left on the 26th September. 334. The Royal council which was held at Riyadh at the beginning of the month included Sheikh Hafez Wahba, Saudi Minister in London, who had flown specially from London to attend it. Fuad Hamza and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin were also present. Palestine was an important item of discussion, and the Minister to London on his way back thither said to the British Embassy at Cairo that the King was in a very embarrassing and dangerous position owing to pressure from the ulema urging him to declare himself openly against partition. Such evidence as is possessed by this Legation does not lend much support to this alarming view. The King himself sent a message to His Majesty’s Government saying that he had dissuaded Sheikh Kamil-ul-Qassab and his fellow-agitator from holding a Moslem conference at this stage, and had also persuaded them not to go to the Yemen. The King was not, however, able to prevent the Bludan Conference from being held. It was noticed by all that no representatives from Saudi Arabia were sent to that conference, and the general impression at Jedda is tlmt the King intends to take no action in the Palestine controversy at present. Judging from recent issues of the two important local papers, the inhabitants of Mecca and Medina have accepted the Royal lead, and are devoting themselves to energetic propaganda for the coming pilgrimage. 335. Sheikh Hafez Wahba has again emphasised his opinion that British help in the formation and training of a Saudi air force is urgently needed, and he expressed the view that the best way to start would be to send out a British officer to Jedda to make a personal examination of conditions there. His Majesty's Government are, however, examining a scheme whereby a certain number of selected Saudi mechanics could be trained in Egypt. 336. The favourite wife (a Turkish lady) of the Amir Feisal has given birth to a son. The stories which circulate about the gifts distributed by the delighted father bring to mind the classical stories of the generosity of Hatim Tai. His servant, who was the first to bring him the good news, received from His Royal Highness a nearly new Nash landau. The same man then went to Hamed Suleiman, demanded a present from him too, and got 60 gold pounds in cash Sheikh Muhammad Suroor and Sheikh Abdullah-el-Fadhl each contributed 400 riyals. The fortunate announcer, now well in his stride, returned to the Amir and demanded a real gift this time, preferably something by which he could [130 ff-1] ' ' Bremember the event for all time; and received 10,000 date trees, free from Government tax and zakat. So runs the story. 337. The Amir is, however, due to visit another wife, his cousin, in Riyadh, shortly. 338. AbdullaJh Suleiman, the Minister of Finance, has been active. For the first part of the month he was at Hasa; then at Riyadh; and he has been in Jedda '''N once or twice. The Kaimakam of Jedda gave a party for him on the 24th September, and he was again here for a day or two at the end of the month. Rumour speaks of an attempt on his life, the motive being personal rather than political. 339. During a short visit to Jedda in the middle of the month he received the Indian pilgrimage clerk Mr. Shahjehan Amir Kabir, who was able to talk to him in a general way about the coming Indian pilgrimage. The Minister of Finance said that certain Indian mutawwifs had themselves suggested that the old system, whereby they came freely to this Legation to facilitate the accomplish ment of the formalities connected with the pilgrimage, should be reintroduced this year. He made no definite statement of policy, but said that he quite agreed that it would be in the best interests of Indian pilgrims if the Legation and the Saudi Arabian Government co-operate wdth one another to avoid difficulties. 340. It is a good sign that the few Indian pilgrims who have already arrived have been registered in the normal way, and their mutawwifs have co-operated satisfactorily with this Legation. Further references to pilgrimage arrangements will be found in Part IV of this report. 341. Rushdi Malhas, called by the Saut-ul-Hejaz the director of the Political Section of the Royal Office, together with Assad Bey A1 Faqih left Jedda for Syria on the 8th September. The latter is to complete his legal studies. 342. The Umm-al-Qura on the 10th September takes up the cudgels on behalf of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. It reproves its rival, the Saut-ul-Hejaz, for saying that Rushdi Malhas was the director of the political section of the Diwan of His Majesty; the truth being that he was merely the assistant in that section, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin being the director. 343. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin is reported to have left Riyadh on the 6th September for Syria via Iraq; his business being concerned with Palestine. His family travelled from Jedda to meet him in Syria. 344. Mr. E. D. Pridie, director of the Medical Services of the Sudan Government, visited Jedda for a few hours during his return journey from leave on the 26th September. His purpose was to enquire generally into local pilgrimage arrangements with a view to co-ordinating action in the coming Haj. Several questions of mutual interest were discussed with the Legation doctor and Mr. Courtenay of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., notably the exact arrangements at Suakin. The local authorities did not respond with any marked enthusiasm to a suggestion that they might care to discuss pilgrimage questions. The kaimakam, however, invited Mr. Pridie to drink coffee and introduced the quarantine doctor, Dr. Adham. The friendly party in the kaimakam’s office was rudely interrupted by the town idiot, a madman whose usual amusement is to waltz around the streets dressed only in a sack. The unexpected and uninvited guest, who always receives the tolerance accorded in the east to those possessed by jinns, upset the coffee and was only expelled by a stratagem. Mr. Pridie confined himself at this party to generalities, raised a laugh by saying that he did not see how microbes could live in the heat of Jedda, and left. His visit was very helpful to the Legation and several questions were discussed with profit, 345. Mediaeval conditions at Riyadh are well shown by a trial for witchcraft which took place while Mr. Ousman was there. The unfortunate accused was condemned, by a Shariah court, for bewitching a boy in such a way that he died. The man was condemned to 300 lashes, which he duly received in the public market place before an interested audience which included Fuad Hamza, K.B.E. The body, when borne away, resembled pulp but was said by some to be still alive. 346! There has been more flying activity this month than in August, as the oil has arrived. The Russian pilot believes that the reason why the whole air force was without oil for about three months was because someone forgot to order it. and when it was ordered from Suez someone forgot to send it. The noise of Capronis flying low has disturbed the morning slumbers of Jedda on several days towards the middle of the month. Schemes of reorganisation of the Saudi air force are in the air; a skeleton formation of two squadrons made up from✓ 3 the Wapitis and the Italian planes respectively, is suggested. Meanvv hile Lieutenant-Colonel Ciancio is anxious to get away his successor Captain i (who was here before) being already overdue. The four Italian niechan resigned to doing very little. Petrol stocks are sufficient for a good deal of ny g. II.- -Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 347 The Yemen military mission having completed its course in the Iiaq military school, left Iraq for the Yemen about the 19th August, according to tne Saut-ul-Hejaz of the 24th August. ^ ^ „ t a T&gt;ari rp- 348. News was received during the month that Mr. B. H. Lerm , P sentative of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) succeeded m commg ° agreement with the Sultan of Muscat at Karachi during the month of July. i£e Sultan gave the company two concessions, one for the 1 rovince oi Dho other for the remainder of his territories in Arabia. 349. The Javanese population of Mecca, which appears to be considerable, has had the enterprise to obtain (after much difficulty) permission U) P ut) “ s a monthly review in Javanese and Arabic. The third issue of this pubhcatio , which is named Nida-ul-Islam, and is edited by Mustafa Andarqin, contains a variety of articles. All are religious propaganda, designed to encomage Moslems of Java to make the pilgrimage. One article quotes with appro the remarks of Thomas Carlyle on the prophet Mahomet and an( ?ther quoted Bernard Shaw as saving that a time would come when Islam would spiead to the west, as western nations would find that their political and economic difficulties could not be solved save by Islam. 350 A reasonably worded remonstrance has been received from the baudi Arabian Government to the occupation by Transjordan forces of a place named Tatan. or Tutun. which appears, in truth, to be on the baudi side of the tiont e . A reply has been requested from the Transjordan authorities. Ill—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 351 The Umm-ul-Qura published on the 10th September the text of messages exchanged between the Syrian Committee for the Defence of Palestine and the Mecca Committee, the president of which is Mahomet Naseef. 1 he latter savs “Arabs and Moslems are not satisfied with the decision concerning partition; Palestine is an Arab territory and the sole duty of every Moslem and every Arab is to protest against that unjust decision; we associate ourselves with the Arabs of Palestine in their disapproval of it „ 352 The same paper mentions that an invitation from Nabih-ul-Azma, trom Syria, informing the Mecca Committee of Defence that a conference was to be held at Damascus on the 8th September, was only received on the 6th September, so that there was no time to send delegates. r I he Mecca Committee therefore contented itself with sending a sympathetic telegram confirming their adherence to the programme of the conference. 353. The agenda of the Bludan Conference was announced m the local press on the 14th September. Sheikh Kamil-ul-Qassab and his fellow- propagandist Khalid Bey-ul-Halim passed through Jedda on their return journey early in September, but appear to have been too late to attend the Biudan C on f GrcncG 354. On the 16th September the religious paper Al Medina-al-Munawwara contained an article called “ Palestine and the Arab world of Islam in which the proposal to partition Palestine, the “ heart of the Arab countries, is deprecated; the British Government, by taking that position, has antagonised the whole Arab world and lost their friendship. Apart from the articles and notices mentioned above, the press has kept surprisingly clear of the Palestine question; and at the end of the month pilgrimage propaganda was its chief theme. Egyptian and Syrian propagandists are, however, by no means idle m this country; a pamphlet, printed in Cairo, and containing lehgious texts disparaging the Jews, was discovered at Jedda during the month. In one passage it abused the Jews and the British for their designs on the holy evil of Islam. 355. A report of the 16th September says that the Italian Legation now receives its newspapers through their official bag instead of through the local post. The last consignment, however, was not distributed to the inhabitants of [130 ff—1] B 24 Jedda gratis, perhaps for one of the following reasons; the supply was too small, or the messenger, named Bata or Bahta, an Abyssinian, has left for Massawa. 356. It appears that in the past such newspapers have been sent to Mecca also; they were distributed by the caretaker in charge of the Italian “ rubat” at Mecca. 357. Strong rumours that arms and ammunition had been landed somewhere near Aqaba were heard in the local bazaar on the 18th September. These rumours, which may be connected with certain shipments of Italian arms from Massawa in June, are being investigated; the latest indications are that the arms have been delivered to the Saudi posts in the northern frontier areas. 358. M. Bellini, the senior interpreter to the Italian Legation, has been definitely transferred to Rome. He has had about thirty-eight years’ service already and felt very humiliated when a new secretary,' the Marquis Paveri Fontana, came to Jedda and became senior to him. M. Bellini’s successor is to be a certain M. Bachir, an Arab from Tripoli. 359. M. Pastacaldi the chancelier at the Italian Legation left, with his wife, on transfer to Jibuti on the 22nd September. His chief, M. Sillitti. left on leave, at last, seveyn days later, after spending almost the whole summer here endeavouring to get four months’ leave. He will have to be back, he said, early in December for the Massawa pilgrimage. IV .—M iscellaneous. 360. Mr. C. Ousman, pro-consul at this Legation, returned to Jedda from Riyadh on the 29th September. In spite of many exasperating difficulties he succeeded in installing the King’s electric plant, and left when the first test gave successful results. The wiring in the Royal palaces, however, is not of good quality; such supplies were furnished by Mr. Philby’s firm Sharqieh. Mr. Ousman received from the King his thanks, two abas, a dagger and a Bombay wrist-watch which has since stopped. He was glad to return to Jedda after nearly three months’s absence in very trying conditions. 361. It is hard to refrain from comparing the meagre acknowledgment of Mr. Ousman s hard work with the ridiculous liberality extended to the man who announced the birth of the Amir Feisal’s son. Reports concerning the latter event, however, may be exaggerated; and means may be found to squeeze out of the man that which he obtained so easily. It would be wrong to conclude that the Royal family value an addition to the large company of Royal offsprino- so much higher than an electric light installation. 362. Haji Abdul Majid, Malay pilgrimage officer, returned to Jeddaa from Singapore on the 26th September. ^ 63 - , Dr - Mahmud Hamooda, Director-General of the Health Department, left for Syria the previous week, and is to attend the International Health Conference at Paris as a representative of the Saudi Arabian Government. ui- 3( ? 4 i The Mecca Municipality are displaying great zeal. A notice has been published warning the Meccans that a committee has been formed with the object of inspecting ruined houses and taking any necessary measures for safeguarding them from falling down. Some houses have been condemned to be demolished as they are unsafe. 365. The L mm-ul-Qura of the 3rd September announces the opening of a new hospital at Taif, furnished with an adequate number of beds appliances and surgical instruments. Operations and treatment were due to beo-in on the 4th September. &amp; 366. It was i eported last month that a number of lorries, lorry chassis and passenger cars had been imported and landed at Jedda. A full list’of these cars to the middle of September is said to be as follows :— (1) Lorries and lorry chassis :— 22 11 Bussing Nag ” lorries (Diesel). 15 “ Mercedes Benz ” lorries (Diesel). 20 “ Chrysler ” trucks. 28 ‘ ‘ Chrysler ’ ’ truck chassis. 100 “ Ford ” truck chassis. 5 “ Krupp ” lorries (Diesel, air-cooled).(2) Passenger cars :— 11 Chrysler and Dodge cars. 100 Ford cars. 4 Pontiac cars. j** 367. The Dodge Company, through its Syrian agents, is said to be about to open a service station here, with the intention of making a serious attack on this market; fifty-nine Dodge units are said to have been imported this season, and the total is expected to reach 100. The local representative of the Sharqieh Company has explained that that company receives only 25 per cent, in cash for the Ford units which it imports for the Transport Company. The balance is recovered gradually by the receipt of a half-share of the pilgrim dues collected by the Government. 368. Rumours have been heard that the Saudi Arabian Government contemplates introducing new legislation concerning the ownership of land. A fixed land revenue is to be collected, and foreigners are to be allowed to own land after all. But nothing tangible has been reported hitherto. 369. The usual annual appeal to the Moslems of the world to come to the next pilgrimage was published in the Umm-ul-Qura on the 3rd September. It is in the form of a circular from the Mecca office of Haj propaganda. The Hejaz is peaceful and secure; multitudes of new cars and lorries have been imported for the pilgrims’ benefit, and no pilgrim should miss this opportunity to combine religious duty with touristic pleasure. 370. A report from Mecca says that the road between the two hills Safa and Marawah, begun about a year ago, is still under construction, the expenses being provided by a rich Egyptian. 371. The poor house of Mehdi Bey, turned last year into an orphanage, is still doing useful work, the boys being educated and taught trades. Non-Saudis, who were originally excluded, are now admitted, provided they are residents of this country. 372. The Saut-ul-Hejaz publishes a notice saying that the roads between Mecca, Jedda and Medina are to be paved during this year for the comfort of travellers and pilgrims. 373. Seyyid Ghulam Muhiuddin-al-Afghani-al-Ghaznavi is reported to have arrived in Jedda about the middle of August in connexion with arrangements for the coming pilgrimage. 374. The Umm-ul-Qura of the 17th September, in the course of a lengthy series of propaganda articles designed to attract pilgrims, says that charges for letters, both ordinary and registered, will be lower this year than last; money orders for abroad will also be charged 1 per cent, instead of last year’s rate of 1^ per cent. Details of the postal reductions are as follows :— Ordinary letters :— 1937. 1938. Piastres miri. Addressed abroad, each 20 grammes ... H 3 Addressed to internal addressee If 1 2 Registered letters abroad 3i 3 375. The kaimakam’s attempt at the degoatisation of Jedda has failed. The goat-owners have won. They presented to the kaimakam a petition pointing that, if the goats were not allowed on the streets, they must be kept in the owners’ houses, which would mean that the lower stories of most of the houses of Jedda would be polluted. The innovator saw the logic of this argument, and withdrew his order. 376. Dogs, however, are in a different category. They are unclean anyhow, and the local police have had some rifle practice at the pariahs of Jedda with good results. Although the local breed of fox-head pi-dog is not extinct, 312 are said to have been shot recently. 377. Mr. H. J. Wratislaw arrived on the 19th September to resume charge of the affairs of the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) Company at Jedda, taking over from Mr. Ball, who left on leave a few days later.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER!

The offer of His Majesty’s Government in respect of the former s evidently welcomed by the King. As for aeroplanes, it appears that Ibn ' re f’ ar(is t [ iem as necessary for the proper control of his unruly tribes Tj at i\/r ed ° Xe l the enori n°us areas of his country. But it is equally plain that is Majesty has no real idea of the difficulties or the expense which the upkeep of a satisfactory air force m Saudi Arabia would involve P P [105 dd—1] B301. It may be that the King is feeling old and realises the difficulties which his successor would have with the tribes of Nejd, and still more with the Hejaz, which might easily become indifferent or hostile. ,,f mnst 302 The question of Palestine has been uppermost in the minds of most Arabs in the last few weeks. The opinion of the calmer elements seems to be thaU^ the King must decide what is best to do. The younger Arabs, w ^° ; been skilfully primed with the falsehood that the Holy PJaces of Palestine were to be handed'to the Jews, talk about uniting with the Yemen and Iraq and having a glorious jihad. Telegrams have continued to reach Riyadh expressing abhorrence at the prospect of losing any Palestinian territory, and a shmkh of a small tribe near the Transjordan border said he was ready for a Motf. No doubt the King is being urged to take the present opportunity to proclaim himself tl e leader of all the Arab world, and to defeat the Hashimite Abdullah. The local press on the 26th August recorded the arrival in Jedda of two re P^ e ' the Palestine and Syrian Arab Committees, named Sheikh Kamel-ul-Qassab and Khalid Bey al Hakim. They left for Taif and Riyadh and were received y Ibn Sand. ' Their proposals were that an Arab congress should be summoned at Damascus or Jerusalem to discuss the question of Palestine; and bheikh Kamel-u- Qassab proposed to go to the Imam of the Yemen to invoke his assistance m Saud. however, informed His Majesty’s Government that he had dissuaded the sheikh both from bis visit to the Yemen and from the idea of an Arab congress 111 th 303 ear Sheikh e Hafez Wahba was urgently summoned to Riyadh and left London by air on the 26th August. The King has stated that after seeing him he proposes to submit a new proposal to His Majesty s Government. 304 The Palestine partition proposal caused curious reactions; at one time it appeared that His Majesty’s Government, Philby were mundum. Mr. Philby’s frank expression of approval has resulted in his being disowned by Sheikh Hafez Wahba. 305 The Saut-ul-Hejaz of the 10th August records a meeting at the Municipality of Mecca five days previously of certain respectable officials and residents, with the object of forming a “Committee for the Defence of Palestine. \ certain Sheikh Muhammad Naseef was elected president. Similar committees are to be formed at other places; the Jedda committee appears to have been 306. Fuad Bey Hamza has been at Riyadh during the month Sheikh Yusuf Yasin returned with the princes and went to Taif aud Rivadh without delav The sheikh does not seem to be in good odour locally; the local newspapers, which published lengthy accounts of the arrival of the princes, omitted the sheikh’s name altogether, and rectified the omission by a small insertion m their next issue: “ We are sorry to observe that we omitted to announce in our last issue the return to this country of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin.’’ 307 The new Qaim-Maqam, Sheikh Ibrahim-bm-Muammar, who conlesses to finding the climate of Jedda somewhat trying, has not lost much time m trying to make it cleaner. Rubbish-boxes are being fixed in the streets He has summoned all the heads of quarters in the town and warned them not to allow cows sheep, or goats to wander about in the streets m future; the two innovations are complementary as the domestic animals referred to used to devour a good deal of the offal. Six goats are reported to have been impounded and ordered to be destroyed, one being saved at the last moment on appeal from the owner, who Avas one of the servants of this Legation. i T jj • k + 308. Sheikh Ibrahim Muammar’s efforts to wake up the Jeddawis have not been confined to anti-litter campaigns. He summoned all the bakers and told their sheikh, with much emphasis, that Jedda bread was dirty and of short weight. Money changers have been warned not to try to debase the nyal. The dhowmen have been warned not to trespass on the duties of the porters, who must be allowed to earn their fair wages. And on the 30th August Muammar, at the opening o the new “ Amir Faisal ” Street, with its brand-new shops, made an impressive sneech on progress. The whole world was progressing, except the Hejaz. Stern measures were essential to enable the Hejaz to keep up with modern progress. A dormant nation could not be awakened from its lethargy save by drastic 309 The Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, is reported to be coming back to Jedda from Hasa.II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 310. Zubara Dispute .—The Vmm-al-Qura on the 23rd July has an article headed “ Is it true? ” followed by a quotation from the Al Nida newspaper of Beirut, to the effect that war has been declared (by the Government of Bahrein) ^ against the Government of Qatar, and that the former Government had issued orders to their subjects to return from pearl fishing. The dispute, says the Beirut paper, concerns a town named Zubara. The Meccan paper makes no comment. 311. The answer to the newspaper’s enquiry was provided by the informa tion received during the month that the Zubara dispute, which threatened at one time to have repercussions in Saudi Arabia, had been settled, Sheikh Rashid of Naim having entered into an agreement with the Ruler of Qatar to obey him as long as he resided at Qatar. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 312. The French Minister, M. Maigret, departed on leave on the 25th August for Beirut. His passport bore visas for Aden, the Y emen, Palestine, Syria and Cyprus, which seems to indicate an extensive tour before Jedda sees him again. He expects to tour the Red Sea in a French sloop, visiting Hodeida and Jibuti before returning here. 313. The Italian Minister, M. Silitti, has not left Jedda iov his long-desired leave. A special law granting the post of Jedda four months’ leave per year has to be passed, but apparently M. Silitti cannot venture to leave at all until that takes place. Meanwhile, he complains bitterly of having nothing to do, and consoles himself by playing golf. The hot weather is slipping by and his Excellency wishes to be here for the beginning of the pilgrim season, so that he can tell Massawa exactly what to do and how to do it. 314. Copies of Arabic newspapers from Benghazi are still being distributed in Jedda. A paper called the Berid Barca, containing a very emphatic leading article on the delights of fascism for the Arabs and the fine intentions of Mussolini in helping peoples such as the Egyptians to realise their independence, was distributed towards the end of August. 315. The technique of distribution is not quite clear, but it is thought that it works as follows : Parcels of papers arrive at the Jedda Post Office addressed to the Italian Legation. The Legation cavass opens them in the Post Office and gives some copies to the postal employees. The rest he distributes in some way in the bazaar. 316. The Italian aviators are not at all happy. Colonel Ciancio did not pilot an aeroplane on the 1st August when the Amir Saud arrived back in Jedda; he was said to be ill, but the truth appears to be that he had taken offence at bad treatment. The Amir Faisal is said to be wont to reprove the Saudi commandant of Jedda, Said Bey Kurdi, for treating the Italians too well. But there is still very little oil and the aeroplanes are scarcely ever flown. Four mechanics, having served here for some months, left Jedda to their great relief in the middle of the month, each man receiving a gratuity of £10; and four other Italians arrived to replace them. Colonel Ciancio talks of leaving Jedda in disgust as soon as he possibly can. ^ m , . . _ . 317. The recent visit of Sheikh Abdur Rahman-al-Tabashi to India was the occasion of a reception at Bombay by Ismail Ghuznavi, and merits a short comment in this report. The sheikh is responsible for the supply of food, clothing and other personal needs of the Royal household at Riyadh. He normally employs two agents, one at Bahrein and the other at Jedda. The latter is said to ha\e charged £500 for one winter suit for the King from Syria, and other items have been similar ; the sheikh has therefore, according to our reports, gone to India via Koweit with the object of arranging some more economical method or supplying the needs of the palace direct from India. 318. Early in the month of August it was observed that the weekly Khedivial Mail steamer was flying the Egyptian flag instead of the British. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., the local agents, invited several Jeddawis to a reception on board the mail boat to celebrate the change of flag. The ship’s doctor took charge of the proceedings and appropriate speeches were made. The Jeddawis were not, however, impressed by the new name “ Pharaonic Mail Line ” which, it seems, is the title of a new holding company for which, in the [105 dd—1]Red Sea at any rate, the Khedivial Mail Line is still to act as managing agents. Whatever the word “ Pharaoh ” may connote to the Egyptians, at the centre of Islam it immediately calls to mind the only Pharaoh mentioned in the Koran, who oppressed Moses and is considered the very personification of wickedness. 319. Ibn Sand having advised the Syrian papers to maintain the best possible attitude towards Turkey, His Majesty complained that the Turkish newspapers were maintaining an anti-Arab attitude, to which he took exception. His Majesty’s Ambassador to Turkey reported that he had not seen any example of such an attitude in local papers, but communicated to the Turkish Government Ibn Saud's complaint; the Turkish Government stated that they appreciated Ibn Saud’s gesture with the Syrians, and would act in the sense indicated. IV.— Miscellaneous. 320. One of the chief events of the month at the port of Jedda has been the arrival of a large number of cars and lorries for Government account. The forty Dodge cars referred to in paragraph 235 of the Jedda report for May have arrived; fifty Krupp Diesel lorries and 200 Ford units, 100 lorries and 100 miscel laneous passenger cars arrived by a German boat. 321. The unloading of this large number of units taxed the resources of the Jedda port to the utmost and for some time after there was a shortage of lighters. The channel from the roadstead to the shore is at one place very shallow and appears to be silting up; with the low water-level prevailing now the number of lighters which stuck there on the way to the quay was remarkable. The firm of Alireza and Co. intend to propose to their confreres in the shipping agency business that the Saudi Government should tackle the problem of dredging the worst part of the channel; the present serious congestion would then be avoided. 322. The local press has published less and less about Palestine as the month has progressed. The principal item about Palestine now is the correspondence between committees of defence of Palestine founded at Mecca and Medina, with similar bodies in Syria, Jerusalem, Egypt and Iraq. 323. The Medina paper Al Medina-al-Munawwara reports that a local company is proposing to import from Belgium a machine for digging artesian wells there. The total cost of the machine and parts will be £1,000 gold. Shereef Muhammad Tahir is reported as subscribing half that amount and as volunteering to bear all the risk of importing the machine. 324. Lady Abdul Qadir (see paragraph 288 of the Jedda report for July) spent most of the month of August at Medina, where she found the air much more pleasant than at Jedda. She was accommodated in a private house. She returned to Jedda on the 25th August and went to Mecca for two days. Miss Clements spent an uncomfortable month waiting for permission to visit the holy places of the religion she professes, but technical difficulties were in the way and it became quite evident that permission would not arrive for a long time. She found accommodation in the house of a “ wakil ” very trying, ran away once to a slightly more comfortable but less reputable house, but was evidently extremely glad to be able to leave Jedda with Lady Abdul Qadir and party on the 29th August for Port Sudan. 325. It is reported that the Saudi Arabian Government have made a definite contract with the Banque Misr, which will shortly begin to construct or repair certain roads in the Hejaz. The road from Jedda to Mecca is to be made and prolonged to Arafat; a few bridges and culverts will be built where floods are likely. The section of the Medina road from Jedda to Rabigh will not be made up as it is considered sufficiently passable already, but the section from Rabigh to Medina is to be improved. The Banque Misr is also to arrange for the supply of electricity to Mecca, and for a water supply. The total cost of these public works is estimated at £250,000, the Saudi Arabian Government and the Egyptian Government bearing the expense jointly by annual payments of £20,000 from each party. The Egyptian instalment is to be paid from the Egyptian waqfs. 326. Four Indian men and one Indian woman are said to have been arrested on the Medina road by the Saudi authorities and put in prison in Jedda; their offence being that they had no papers of nationality and were destitute. 327. The Umm-ul-Qura reports great activity by the Legislative Assembly ; about thirty-seven decisions were made, and amendments to the present regulations about passports, nationality, labour and companies were considered.5 g) (?) 328. An editorial discusses the question of giving names to the streets of the metropolis, and of planting trees along them. 329. The 1 mm-ul-Qura on the 13th August reports that an Egyptian date expert named Abdul Aziz Effendi Hasan-al-Nooti arrived a week previously and • went to Taif and Medina, where he will make investigations in methods of date cultivation. 330. Planning ahead is not one of the specialities of those responsible for the internal economy of Jedda. At the beginning of August rumours of a shortage of coal for the condenser water-supply caused some apprehension; and the price of condensed water suddenly rose on the 9th August from 4 piastres to twice that amount per “yoke.” Demand was not greatly affected and the condenser water-supply gave out in the afternoon, thus sending up the price of the only substitute, the water from Waziriyeh. It is believed that coal was hastily brought over from Port Sudan in sambuks. 331. The ice-machine also broke down for several days owing to a lack of ammonia, and ice was even imported, at an enormous price, from Mecca. 332. I he long-standing claim for arrears of wages claimed by the Malay chauffeur Mohammad-bin-Yusuf has been settled. He had served the Govern ment motor car company as a chauffeur for forty months, and under his contract he was entitled to £15 (gold) per month, making £600 (gold). After much correspondence the Finance Department made him an offer ; they estimated the pound at ten riyals (which is the official rate for Saudi payments, though it is otherwise when cash has to be received) and then deducted 25 per cent, from that, making about £400 sterling instead of £600 gold. It appears that Saudi officials and other chauffeurs are treated in the same way, and Mohammad-bin-Yusuf was recommended to take what he could get lest even that offer should be withdrawn. It appears that he did so.16th 6eptjtmb»?&lt;; ; '77 P. 2 In r«ply to your letter of the 14th August ;5o# i:•4673/680/26, I am QOfnmanded by ^y Lord* -oi.:-'ion^rs ot the Admiralty to ao^ualut you for the information of the oeoretary of state for Foreign ffairs that they hare no objeotion to the proposal &gt;o discontinue the praotloe of printing and distributing the Jedda Monthly Beports* 2.

Jedda Report for July 1937. I .—Internal A ffairs. 267. Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Ousman, pro-consul, left for Riyadh on Saturday, the 3rd July. Full details of their journey had not reached Jedda by the end of the month, owing to difficulties of communication. A fuller account will therefore appear in next month’s report. The party is believed to have arrived at Riyadh, after some vicissitudes, on the 6th July; and to have left Riyadh, accompanied by Fuad Bey Hamza, for Khobar, on the Hasa coast, and Bahrein on the 9th July, arriving at the last-named place on the 13th July. The journey to Khobar was not pleasant. The cars had to be pushed by hand a good deal, and the water nearly ran out. Mr. Ousman returned (with Fuad Bey Hamza) to Riyadh, where he is to erect an electric lighting plant for King Abdul Aziz, on the 19th July. 268. The King’s reactions to the Palestine report were mixed. After the initial shock, he seems to have been chiefly alarmed at the prospect that the Amir Abdullah would have untrammelled control of the new Arab State. He said that he did not mind Abdullah with a mandatory Power to keep him in check, but an independent Abdullah was quite a different thing ; he would in that case insist on his claim to Akabah and Maan, and he would require a corridor allowing his tribes to communicate direct with Syria. 269. The King’s only published reply to the many telegrams, which were sent to him by Hejazis and subjects of other Arab States protesting against the partition of Palestine, was extremely cautious. 270. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin's views are that the establishment of a Jewish State will be a great danger to the Arab States bordering it; for the Jews, being rich, will purchase expensive armaments and attack their neighbours. 271. The Umm-al-Qura of the 9th July published a carefully composed communique reporting His Majesty's Minister’s arrival at Riyadh and his audience in which he “submitted to the King, in the name of His Majesty’s Government, the report of the Committee on Palestine ; there followed discussions connected with matters concerning relations between the two countries, in an atmosphere filled with the spirit of amity and friendship.” 272. The Umm-al-Qura and the Saut-ul-Hejaz have had much to say about the Palestine Report. The latter published a good deal of the text 'of the “Summary ” of the report; the cuts were made more from the point of view of space than from any desire to publish a misleading text, though the omission of some of the headings made the Arabic a little difficult to understand. But the whole idea of “ partition ” appears to be anathema. 273. The first indication of the feelings of the Jeddawis on the subject was seen on the 19th July—a Monday, and therefore the day after the arrival of the weekly mail bringing the Egyptian papers. Bands of youths, older men, [80 z—1]2 porters and schoolboys from the Government schools paraded the town shoutin^j^ such slogans as: “Down with the Jews! ' “ Palestine belongs to the Arabs. “ Long live our King ! ” “ There is a God ! ” “ Let not Palestine be partitioned ! Each little band had a leader, the most vociferous being the head porter of the custom-house, who was used to encouraging gangs of coolies to push new cars in crates out of the custom-house to the agents’ garages. The din suddenly diedj^ down about 11 a.m.; one theory is that the local deputy acting kaimakam, taken by surprise, telephoned to the Government at Taif and received orders to stop the processions, another that the demonstrators had by then become bored and thirsty. So far all the agitation appears to come from the Hejazis. 274. Mr. Ousman, who returned to Riyadh from Bahrein on the 19th July, reports that he is housed in one of the better class residences of that town. It belongs to the local Minister of Finance, who the pro-consul says can neither read nor write; but it is a filthy, fly-ridden place. The streets in Riyadh being about 2 yards wide, Mr. Gusman’s first task has been to knock down some houses which are in the way of the lorries which are transporting his electric light plant. The heat is terrific. Riyadh strikes Mr. Ousman as one huge prison; there is a curfew at 10 p.m., and no one is allowed to enter the town after that hour. 275. Telegrams of congratulation were sent by the Legislative Assembly to the King and to the Amir Feisal on the occasion of the escape of the heir apparent from injury in a slight motor accident in England; the press reports indicate that the accident took place while the Amir Baud was travelling either from or to Scotland towards the beginning of July. 276. The hot weather has not prevented a good deal of acrimonious discussion about motor transport. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman left the cool breezes of Taif for the heat and quarrelsome atmosphere of Mecca to attend a meeting of the Motor Transport Company on the 10th July. Complaints of maladministration by Muhammad Suroor and others appear to have been before the meeting, but everyone was whitewashed. Sheikh Abdullah announced to the meeting that the Government had decided to open a grand garage at Mecca, and to change the bodies of the company’s buses so as to make them similar to those of the Iraqi companies. Objections to the latter proposal on financial grounds were over ruled, and 400 buses were ordered to be brought up to the new standard. The directors proposed that motor-bus fares for the journey to Medina from Mecca should be raised from £g. 7^ to £g. 8; but Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman showed reluctance to increase the cost of the pilgrimage. 277. The Amir Feisal is reported to have visited Rakbah and Samuda on the 10th July on a hunting trip. 278. The Amir Saad, son of the late Amir Abdullah-bin-Jiluwi, and Governor of Hasa, came to Taif from Riyadh about the 3rd July, and is reported to be on his way to Egypt for treatment for his eyes. 279. Sheikh Ibrahim-bin-Muammar, late Saudi Charge d’Afiaires at Bagdad, arrived in Jedda and took over the duties of kaimakam on the 31st July. He has evidently made an exchange of posts with Sheikh Muhammad Id-al- Rawwaf (see paragraph 258.) 280. Preparations for the impending arrival of the Amir Saud and his brother the Amir Muhammad at Jedda were in full blast at the end of July. The Amir Feisal, accompanied by a large number of the King’s sons, nephews, grand children, and retainers arrived in Jedda on the 28th July. Dancing round fires in the streets, the erection of triumphal arches decked with green and white, and much carpet-spreading and cleaning up in the customs-sheds and quays, where the heir apparent will land, were noticeable signs of national rejoicing. 281. Hardly any flying has been done during the past month. Shortage of oil and petrol has been the explanation. 282. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate ((Limited) have recently been prospecting at Madain Salih for coal, which would be useful to them in smelting or extracting the gold at the Mahd-ed-Dhahab mine. The coal which was said to be at Madain Salih, however, turned out to be nothing but lava and certain old gold workings there were not worth developing. The prospectors therefore turned their attention to a place named Muraighib (or Muraikib) 70-80 miles from Yanbu, where ancient workings for gold have been discovered. It is reported that samples from Muraighib have been found to contain promising percentages of gold; the road from Yanbu to Muraighib has been made passable for cars; hopes3 ^ of a real Eldorado are in the air; and the syndicates shares are said to be going up. 283. The northern area and Wejh have now been finally abandoned by the syndicate 284. Mr. Twitchell left for London on leave the 21st July. 285. A German mechanic, named Halama, representing the Daimler-Benz Company of Stuttgart, has been in Jedda for the past three weeks. His task has been to try to explain to the local pundits the workings of the Government's stud of twenty Merc6dks-Benz Diesel lorries (cf. Jedda report (April), paragraph 164). 1 he Alireza family are said to be importing a Merc£dks-Benz Diesel-engined private car (55-h.p. German rating) for their own use. II. —Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 286. The new Italian hospital has received permission to function, though not as part of the Italian Legation; it is to be run as a private hospital, though the doctor (an Italian) is paid by the Italian Government. The Italian nurses, who were said to be coming, have not arrived. III.— Relations with Powers Outside Arabia. 287. M. Maigret, the French Minister, suddenly returned to Jedda from Syria on the 18th July. He refrained from advising his colleagues of that fact, but contented himself with calling on them a week later; he explains that his return is only temporary and that he hopes to go back to Syria early in August. 288. Lady Abdul Qadir, wife of Sir Abdul Qadir, member of the (Council of the Secretary of State for India, arrived at Jedda with one son on the 28th July. She is accompanied by Begum Sarbuland Jung (widow of a high personage in the Government of Hyderabad) her son and granddaughter, as well as an Englishwoman named Miss M. M. Clements. The latter says she became a Moslem in England thirteen years ago, and hopes to visit Medina and Mecca with the Jung party, finally going to India with them. She found, however, that, as is usual here, the Qadhi of Jedda, the Grand Qadhi of Mecca, as well as other authorities had first to pronounce on the genuineness of her conversion to Islam. The Jung party found that a day and a half of Jedda in July was enough for them, and left for 'Medina with Lady Qadir and her son, leaving the unfortunate Miss Clements to wait here for her Islamic “ bill of health.' 289. Mr. Philby seems determined to do his best to antagonise as many people as possible. The brawl at a recent Royal Central Asian Society meeting about Shabwa was in his usual vein. But his advocacy of the Palestine Com mission's report (announced in the Observer of the 11th July) seems likely to damn him in Hejazi eyes. From recent press articles it is very unlikely that many Hejazis will agree that the Royal Commission’s proposal was the only possible solution, or that it satisfies Arab demands. 290. Mr. H. M. Eyres left Jedda for the last time, on the conclusion of his service here, on the 28th July, travelling, via Suez, to England on leave. 291. On the 29th July the Egyptian Charge d’Affaires, M. Abdul Hamid Monir gave a tea-party in celebration of the coronation of King Farouk. A loan of coloured lamps from this Legation increased the brilliance of the decorations and earned his gratitude. IV.— Miscellaneous. 292. The Posts and Telegraphs Department announce that wireless messages can now be accepted for Beirut from the station at Riyadh at the rate of 4 -95 piastres gold per word (about hd.). 293. A sort of round robin having been received from forty-eight persons at Mecca complaining that they, British subjects, were being compelled to allow their beards to grow, His Majesty’s Minister wrote a personal letter to the Amir Feisal at the end of June. He said that many men from British Malaya are naturally without beards; that many others are accustomed to shave their chins; and that the application of the new order to such men, or to any British subjects, might lead to misunderstanding. The Amir Feisal was not amused, and sent an uncompromising reply; the Shariat is the Shariat and all who live at Mecca must obey it. But pilgrims, temporary visitors, and non-Moslems who live outside the boundaries of the Harim are exempt. It seems difficult to get any farther in this4 delicate matter ; if British subjects will go and live at Mecca under the Wahhabis ^ they must not shave their beards. The Amir Feisal made no attempt to deal with the difficult question : “What if they have no beards to shave? A young man of 20 wrote from Mecca saying that he, a Malayan British subject, had come to live in Mecca as a Moslem in order to “ study religious knowledge,’ but was ignorant of the laws of the country as to beards. His religious and secular knowledge on the subject of beards bias now made progress. 294. H.M.S. Londonderry (Captain H. R. Jacomb, R.N.) visited Jedda from the 15th July until the 20th July. The usual ceremonies, visits and parties took place. Twenty-two officers and men were stout enough to play cricket one after noon with the shade temperature about 95 degrees. Each side played an innings and the last wicket fell at sunset with the last ball which could possibly be bowled, the winners having scored 100 against 97. A beer party followed. From Jedda’s point of view it is sad to think that H.M.S. Londonderry is paying off, so that the present officers and crew will not come to cheer up the Jedda community again; the point of view of the officers and crew is probably different.79041/37. . - _ Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th August B.4673/580/25 and in reply to request you to inform Mr. Secretary Eden that he wishes to raise no objection, so far as the Colonial Office is concerned, to the proposal to discontinue, as from the end of the current year, the practice of printing and distributing the Jedda Monthly Reports. Copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office, the Dominions Office, the Admiralty, the War Ofiice, the Air Ministry, the Treasury, the Board of Trade, the Department of Overseas Trade, the Petroleum Department and the Ministry of Health.

C. TROTT. Enclosure. Jedda Report for June 1937. I .—Internal Affairs. 237. Ibn Saud has remained at Riyadh throughout the month. r I he movements of the Amirs Saud and Muhammad in England, and the minor opera tions they have undergone, have been fully recorded in the Mecca press, which fixes their departure for home via Paris for the beginning of July. 238. Fuad Bey is still in Riyadh. Another Syrian, who holds a senior post in Jedda, told a member of the Legation staff that Fuad was in very bad odour with the King, who suspected him of receiving money from the Italians and was keeping him at Riyadh out of harm’s way. Asad-al-Faqih, after spending two or three weeks in Jedda as the local embodiment of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, disappeared without warning in the direction of Taif. The only difference this makes is that you now receive replies from that office in Arabic, instead of French, to the effect that nothing whatever is known about the matter, but enquiry will be made. The Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs have maintained on various occasions, as a circumstance extenuating their absence in Mecca or Taif, that an urgent message from a foreign mission would always be sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by a special car. This boast was put to the test this month, when an urgent communication from His Majesty’s Minister required to be sent, and, after being badgered for some two hours, the authorities in Jedd'a did, in fact, produce a car to take it to Taif. 239. Ibn Baud’s “Back to Religion” proclamation (paragraph 202) was followed up by two regulations tending in the same direction. The first was an order, issued through the town crier, forbidding Moslems to shave the beard. Employees of foreign missions in Jedda are apparently not expected to comply with this order, and the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires has been assured by the authorities that the regulation is not applicable to foreigners. Towards the end of the month information was received from certain British subjects in Mecca that the order was being enforced against foreigners, some British subjects having been fined and imprisoned. The Legation are taking up the question. The second regulation, which was issued by the Ministry of Finance, prohibits the importation or sale of what were at first supposed to be statuettes, but turn out to be any representation in three dimensions of a living creature, from Mustafa Kemal to a rabbit. It seems that children have been found playing with dolls in Mecca. It seems strange that a ruler who allows photography in his realm and has even permitted a film of the pilgrimage to be taken for exhibition in Egypt should boggle at teddy-bears, since drawings and the making of three-dimensional figures are alike forbidden by the religious authorities. But perhaps the responsibilitv for photographs, which are the effect of light, can be shuffled off on to Allah. 240. According to information from a good source, there was this much justification for Ibn Baud’s annoyance at the formation of the Society of the [55 dd—1]2 Friends of the Hejaz (paragraph 205), that one of the Hejazi students in Egypt was found to be in communication with Salama Musa with a view to the ventila tion of Hejazi grievances. It is stated that this young man was recalled, discovered very conveniently in the act of writing incriminating letters, and imprisoned. ^ 241. According to the Umm-al-Qura, its article attacking the use in the w v Hejaz, in connexion with marriage ceremonies, of customs which are not sanctioned by religion (paragraph 216) has met with general approval, and an official committee has asked that a degree should be issued abolishing all such customs. Praise is given to Italy and those other European countries who are trying to encourage the admirable social institution of marriage. No one can deny (though the newspapers do not use this argument) that in Saudi Arabia the ruler of the country sets a good example in the matter of contracting marriages and founding families. 242. The aviation oil (paragraph 209) does not seem to have been ordered, and there is cause to believe that this is a device to squeeze out the Italian air mission. At any rate, the only machine that has been up—and that at rare intervals—for some weeks is the Bellanca, for which there is still left a little of the oil that was handed over with her by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. It is reported by a member of the syndicate that, at the time of handing over, their excellent pilot took up first Lieutenant-Colonel Ciancio, the head of the Italian mission, and then the Russian refugee, M. Naidyonoff, to show them how to fly it, and that whereas M. Naidyonoff flew the machine quite easily, with a few instruc tions, and made a perfect landing, Colonel Ciancio was too nervous to do more than fly straight ahead and was not allowed by the American pilot to make the landing. In any case, it is always M. Naidyonoff who flies the Bellanca. The Italians are deliberately neglected by the Saudi authorities to such an extent that, although their quarters are 2 miles from Jedda, no transport is ever given them. Colonel Ciancio seems to feel that he may not be here long, and has been heard to say that he wished he could get away, 243. The spare parts for the Wapitis have arrived, and M. Naidyonoff and his two Russian mechanics (a second arrived recently) have begun the work of putting them in order. The work has, however, been interrupted by the Minister of Finance (Deputy Minister of Defence), who has taken away the mechanics to fit the engine of one of the discarded De Havilland aeroplanes into a motor boat. 244. When the Saudi aviators were christened “ eagles,” Mr. Philby cruelly suggested that the meaning of the word (“ nasr ”) was vulture rather than eagle In his famous Arabic grammar Wright uses the word in a quotation which he translates : “ The kite in our country becomes a vulture,” i.e., our geese are all swans. Vulture or eagle, the proverb seems to fit the case. 245. In a paragraph about the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, the Daily Telegraph says : “ Water supply difficulties are now believed to have been over come, and it is therefore probable that the directors of the syndicate will shortly proceed with the formation of an operating company.” Information to this effect was received early in June, when Mr. Park, who represents the interests of the prospective operating company, left for England. It is not known how near the water is that has been discovered and to what extent pumping will reduce the profits. 246. A local newspaper tells the Hejazis that the wretched state of the country is due to the lack of enterprise of their predecessors, who preferred to live on charity and legacies rather than to develop the land they lived in. The article states that there are many fertile, well-watered valleys only waiting for the application of brains to bring in a rich return. The reply to this is that capital as well as brains is required, and that, in the absence of communications, the increased produce could not be disposed of to advantage. 247. According to an Egyptian newspaper, the Government of Egypt are lending the Saudi Government a date expert, with an overseer, to advise on the improvement of the cultivation of dates in Nejd. The travelling expenses of these two men to Saudi Arabia are to be paid by the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture. 248. The voluntary subscription contribution of one month’s pay to the Defence Fund by the employees of certain departments (paragraph 161) resolves itself into the definitive retention of the arrears of pay of all officials for the month of DhuT Hijja (mid-February to mid-March). It appears that this has been effected on orders by the Minister of Finance in the face of opposition by the Amir Feisal, who had issued instructions that the pay should not be withheldX 3 unless the official concerned offered in writing to renounce it as a subscription for defence. 249. All reports agree that it was not by the most civilised procedure that the murderer who was executed recently (paragraph 170) was brought to book. ^ It seems that suspicion was narrowed down by the beating of a large number of men, and that the murderer was induced to confess by a promise that he would only be imprisoned. Moreover, it appears that Ibn Baud had threatened to punish the police and the head men of quarters very severely if they failed to discover the murderer. However, since we began by talking about civilisation, it may be mentioned that several Europeans, among them at least one Englishman, took photographs of the act of decapitation. 250. A number of Saudis are to be sent abroad to learn the trade of printing. 251. Hope of some improvement in the water supply of Jedda is held out by the report in the Saut-al-Hejaz that the King has given a plot of land near the quarantine station for the installation of a tank for water from the Waziriya spring. 252. The press announces that Dr. Fuad Abu Ghazaleh has been appointed by the Department of Public Health as a travelling medical officer (para graph 217), and that he left Mecca for a tour of inspection in the northern districts, beginning with Rabegh, on the 21st June. Similarly, Dr. Taufiq IT Qiseibani is to proceed to the south at a later date. 253. The press announces that the National Car Company has decided to import 200 new lorries and fifty cars for pilgrimage traffic during the coming season. A training school for chauffeurs is also to be founded. 254. A number, understood to be about a dozen, of Mercedes-Benz four- cylinder Diesel-engined lorries of about 3 tons capacity has recently arrived in Jedda for the use of the Saudi Arab Government. Presumably they will be used for the transport of pilgrims in the season like the Bussing-N.A.G. lorries mentioned in paragraph 219 of the May report. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 255. The Saudi press have published without comment the text of the treaty signed by the Imam and the Iraq delegates (paragraph 221 ). There seems to be a general opinion that the signature of this treaty by the Imam cannot be considered as adhesion to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty, and that anyhow it is little more than a gesture on the part of the Imam. 256. It seems probable that the Saudi proposal as to the procedure for the final delimitation of the frontier between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia (paragraph 119 will be acted upon. 257. At a meeting between the Officer Commanding Desert Area and the inspector of the Saudi frontiers, which was held on the 14th March, Abdul Aziz-bin-Zaid produced what appeared to be a formidable list of outstanding claims, but was found to be a hotchpotch consisting mainly of dead or fantastically exaggerated demands which appeared to have been put in to justify his new appointment. It is pleasant to record Major Glubb’s opinion : “ The fact of the matter is that things are now so amicable on the frontier that professional diplomats must be hard pressed for occupation.” 258. Sheikh Ibrahim-bin-Muammar, the Saudi Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad, who had become persona non grata to the Iraqi Government, has been “ transferred elsewhere,” and is being succeeded by Sheikh Muhammad Id-al- Rawwaf, who has been for two years deputy kaimakam of Jedda, and before that was for several years Saudi consul in Damascus. Sheikh Muhammad is not a man of action, but, so far as the experience of the Legation goes, he is a decent official and capable of behaving with the dignity and official correctness which his predecessor in Bagdad is stated to have lacked. He left for Iraq on the 30th June. 259. As was expected (paragraph 224), there are not many Bahreinis in Saudi Arabia. So far as our information goes, there is only one person in the Hejaz of Bahreini origin, and he prefers to use Saudi papers. It is said that there are a few Bahreinis in Nejd, but we have no exact information on this score. The Legation have suggested that the information on which to base a study of the question could perhaps be obtained more easily in Bahrein than in Jedda.III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 260. Ibn Saud accepted with obvious pleasure the proposal of His Majesty’s Government that the findings of the Royal Commission on Palestine and the decision of His Majesty’s Government as to their Palestine policy should be communicated to him personally by His Majesty’s Minister before the date fixed**; for publication. He also agreed to a proposal that, in order to save nearly a week, copies of the report should be brought to Jedda by two Royal Air Force aeroplanes. He added that this was very difficult for the Saudi Government, but that the friendship existing between Saudi Arabia and His Majesty’s Govern ment and the importance of the matter enabled him to be obliging on this point. At the end of the month His Majesty’s Minister was only awaiting the receipt by telegraph of the details of the Palestine policy of His Majesty’s Government to set out for Riyadh, whence he will proceed on leave via the Persian Gulf. Iraq and Palestine. 261. The two Royal Air Force aeroplanes, under the command of Squadron- Leader N. Moreton, bearing the report duly arrived in Jedda on the 27th June from Hurghada and returned to Cairo on the following day. The Saudi authorities proved most helpful and arranged for the aeroplanes to be housed in the Italian hangar. Their arrival immediately gave rise to a story that they were a present to Ibn Saud from His Majesty’s Government. 262. Such Arabic propaganda newspapers as have been distributed by the Italian Legation recently are remarkable not for their contents, to which His Majesty’s Government could hardly take exception, as for the manner in which they reached the public. A less blatant and more ingenious method than distribution in the streets by the messengers of the Italian Legation has been found. It appears that the papers are handed—presumably with a small tip—to the Saudi postmen when they call at the Legation, and are delivered by the postmen at various houses. Copies of the monthly programme of all Italian broadcasting stations are being distributed in Jedda free. Copies in French have been seen by the Legation, and it is reported that copies in English and in Arabic are also being distributed. 263. The Umm-al-Qura denies rather sharply a piece of news published in the Saut-al-Sha'b newspaper of Bethlehem and repeated by “ a European wireless station ” that during the pilgrimage some pilgrims from the Spanish Zone of Morocco indulged in propaganda in the mosque at Mecca and prayed : “ O God, grant victory to Mussolini and defeat his enemies.” The newspaper says that, according to ” a high authority,” there is no truth whatever in the allegation. 264. Mme. Fattahov has returned to the Soviet Legation, armed with the mathematics diploma which was the object of her journey home. Our worst suspicions are confirmed : when referring to Paris she spoke of frocks spontaneously and of ancient monuments only under questioning. Mme. Litvin refused at the last moment to go on leave. The fact is that Jedda offers one thing not included in the amenities of Russia—freedom—and all the Soviet staff and their wives seem to appreciate this. The new doctor, Stepukhov, a proletarian, who, in spite of the correctness of his origin, arrived looking crushed and apprehensive, is perking up a little and borrowing Russian refugee newspapers secretly from the Russian pilot. M. Khakimoff borrows them openly, but will not allow his staff to see them. IV.— Miscellaneous. 265. The Italian steamers in the Red Sea recently raised their fares between Jedda and Suez by about 50 per cent. The increase was based on the theory that passengers travelling the whole way between Suez and Massawa would be squeezed out by those booking at or for the intermediate port of Jedda unless the fares of the latter were raised, but there was no basis for the change in fact, for there is always plenty of room on the Italian boats for anyone who wishes to travel by them. The decision to raise the fares has, however/been rescinded. 266. Early in June the Saudi authorities asked the Legation to agree to the deportation to India of a man whom they suspected of being a Hindu. The man had been arrested in Mecca, forcibly circumcised and sent tc&gt; Jedda under arrest. After interrogating the man the Legation agreed to his being sent to India at the expense of the Saudi authorities. He admitted that he was of Hindu origin, but claimed to have become a Moslem some ten years ago when his parents were converted to Christianity.I uieir wivey seem lo appT^ciate tins: i he new doctor, StepukTiov: a proletarian, ^ who, in spite of the correctness of his origin, arrived looking crushed and apprehensive, is perking up a little and borrowing Russian refugee newspapers secretly from the Russian pilot.

S.w.l 14 th August, 1937 Sir With reference to the letter from this department of the 10th July (E 3363/580/25) enclosing copies of the Jedda Monthly Report for May, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to state that he is considering the desirability of discontinuing the practice of printing and distributing these reports as from the end of the current year, unless there is any desire on the part of the departments at present in receipt of copies that distribution should continue. 2. All information of importance contained in these reports is in any case reported separately and earlier, by despatch and copies of any such despatches are sent to the departments interested. There would accordingly seem to Lord Halifax to be little advantage in continuing the distribution of this information a second time in the form of a monthly report which is compiled by His Majesty’s Legation primarily for their own record, in a form which is not always entirely convenient for wider distribution. 3. It is, however, not proposed that the local distribution to adjoining posts from Jedda of roneo-ed copies/ The Under-Secretary of State India Officecopies of the reports should he discontinued. 4.

Copies have been distributed as in the list in paragraph 67. I have, &amp;c. R, W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Jedda Report for May 1937. I .—Internal Affairs. 200. Ibn Saud arrived at Riyadh about the 10 th May. The Amir Feisal accompanied his father part of the way on a shooting expedition, returned to Jedda for a Coronation dinner at His Majesty's Legation, and then left for Mecca. He has now moved the Government offices to Taif for the summer. The Amir Saud is expected back from England very soon. 201. Fuad Bey returned suddenly from leave (paragraph 157) on the 5 th May. On the 18th May he left Jedda without warning, and he telephoned to His Majesty’s Minister from Taif to say that he was leaving for Riyadh and hoped not to' have to stay there more than a fortnight. Rumours of his unpopularity with Ibn Saud continue to circulate, and one which was brought to a foreign company in Jedda on pretty good authority attributes that unpopularity to indiscretions of which huad Bey is alleged to have been guilty when on leave in 1936. Personally, Fuad seems to be, if anything, more bouncing and self-assertive than ever. But then he perhaps need not fear unemployment, having, if all reports are to be believed, a magnificent house at Beirut to retire to, built on one of the best sites and furnished with things that must have cost a fortune. This only shows what a Saudi official can save in ten years or less, if he is careful. The Cheshire cat of Foreign Affairs made a hazy appearance on the 27th May, when a junior official, As’ad-al-Eaqih, telephoned to say that he had arrived and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was now functioning in Jedda. Useless as As’ad-al-Faqih is, except as a telephone clerk, his presence is a recognition of the principle that there should always be a representative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Jedda, and as such it is welcome. 202. Ibn Saud has come out strong as a fundamentalist. In the Umm-al- Qura of the 30th April appeared a proclamation in which, after a religious exhortation, he attacked the Saudi youth who are demanding modernisation, progress, civilisation, liberty and what not. They have been misled, he says, by the devil. Particularly reprehensible is the association of women with men under the cloak of “ progress,” and their abandonment of the proper roles of wife and mother and housekeeper. Such people are taking the very path which by the admission of many right-thinking occidentals is bringing the West to moral ruin. 203. This proclamation came as something of a surprise, as nothing had been heard of any movement for reform, and enquiries made since have discovered little to justify Ibn Saud’s alarm. The young Syrians, and the few Saudis who have been educated in Egypt, may sigh for the cinema and stronger drinks than pink lemonade; the Italian-trained pilots are said to give themselves European airs; and one rich young merchant uses his position as an honorary consul to frequent places where greater freedom of speech and refreshment is possible thanin any Saudi house; but it doesn't amount to much. As to the feminine revolt, the only sign has been the appearance of parties of Moslem ladies, wearing the pre-war Turkish ladies' dress in place of the shapeless garments of the native Arab woman, and walking by themselves on the sea-shore in the cool (if any) of the evening. But perhaps there is some connexion between the proclamation and the “ Society of the Friends of the Hejaz,” whose alleged formation wa^i mentioned in paragraph 158. The economic discontent in the Hejaz may have a slight penumbra of social reform to its nebulous programme, though the Saudi Government deny that there are any Hejazis in the society. 204. It was noticed that the proclamation was addressed to Hejazis, Nejdis and Yemenis. It appears that “ Yemeni ” is not incorrectly applied to the inhabitants of Asir and Najran, who are Saudi citizens, but it was perhaps unwise for Ibn Saud to use a name which might offend the Imam and could easily have been avoided. Perhaps it was for this reason that a later number of the Umm-al- Qura stated that the proclamation was addressed only to Saudi subjects, though it may be because the proclamation was not well received (so it is said) in Egypt and Syria. 205. According to information supplied by His Majesty's Embassy in Cairo, the Society of the Friends of the Hejaz is not to be taken very seriously. The society has no premises, but frequents the office of a review’ run by Salama Musa, a journalist who seems to have no interest in the society except for any news value it may possess. The moving spirit is a Hejazi named Sheikh Yusuf-al-Zawawd, Avho obtained Dutch nationality in Java and is apparently using it as a shield behind which he can safely express his fanatical hatred of Wahabi rule. 206. Ibn Saud is believed to have addressed a severe warning, on the eve of his departure for Nejd, to a meeting composed of the members of the Legislative Council and other notables of the Hejaz. The warning is believed to have been to this effect:— “ O people of Mecca, I am very angry with you. In spite of all the favours I have shown you, you ungrateful creatures are still engaged in mischievous propaganda against me. This Musa Salama is merely an instrument in your hands. I know everything that happens; I have spies even over your wives. The only real Hejazis are the Quraish (the Prophet’s tribe) and the Sharifs. The Quraish are camel-drivers, the Ashraf (i.e., Sharifs) ought rather to be called Ashrar {i.e., the wicked), while the rest of you are outsiders—Indians, Egyptians, and what not. Once again I warn you to abandon your evil machinations, or by Allah I will bring down on you the might of the merciless Nejdis, and there will be nothing left in Mecca but your decapitated heads. This is my last warning.” 207. There are signs that Ibn Saud has been obliged to take into account the discontent in the Hejaz, which is due in the main to poverty. The indications that the Hejazis are to be allowed a freer hand with pilgrims have been mentioned more than once. Another and an important sign is the issue of a regulation in the press on the 11 th May stating that between the middle of Safar and the middle of Jumadi-al-Thani, that is for a period of four months from about the end of one pilgrim season to the beginning of the next, Saudi subjects who wish to go to Mecca or Medina will be exempted from payment of the tax known as Koshan which was hitherto levied all the year round. For a single journey to Mecca this will mean exemption from taxation amounting to 4 rivals or something like 7s. sterling. For a journey to Medina and back the exemption amounts to £2 gold, or £3 8s. approximately. 208. An English chaplain working in Somaliland and other Red Sea countries under the direction of the Bishop of Egypt and the Sudan has written to the Legation suggesting that he should pay a visit, personal rather than pastoral, to Jedda, but it has been necessary to inform him that no priest or other teacher of a non-Moslem religion is now allowed to land in the Hejaz. In this respect there is less toleration than, in 1925, when the applicant was at least able to land and to walk through the town. 209. The Bellanca monoplane (paragraph 160), which had been offered to the Saudi Government by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate for £2,000, was eventually handed over as a present. It was taken over by senior Saudi officials with ceremonious gratitude, which was in striking contrast to the studied indifference which was shown when the last two Capronis arrived to complete the[31 x—1] b 2 3 Italian present. The training of pilots which began at the beginning of April has fallen oh greatly in intensity. This is due to a desire for economy and, in particular, to a shortage of oil: but more oil “ is to be ordered. One of the h^e discarded pilots has been taken on again for training. Under the orders of the Italian colonel of aviation, the pilots, who are already sufficiently confused, are ^ffteing trained indifferently on a Caproni, the French monoplane, the Bellanca and a Wapiti. M. Naidyonoff, the Russian pilot, says that all the maps of the interior which they have are inaccurate, but that this does not matter so much as none of the Saudi pilots know how to read a map in any case. 210. M. Naidyonoff has a theory that Ibn Baud wishes to use aeroplanes as a cheaper means of keeping the tribes in order than the payment of subsidies. He says that at the great gathering of sheikhs which is held at Ashaira every year, Ibn Baud’s presents to the sheikhs have decreased steadily, and last year they were very small. On one occasion M. Naidyonoff, on orders from Ibn Baud, flew from the Hejaz to Tebuk, and he states that he acquired great credit in the eyes of Ibn Baud because a circle or two of his aeroplane over a recalcitrant area near the Transjordan frontier brought the people there to submission. 211. Muhammad Ali Reza, one of the partners in the leading Saudi firm in Jedda, informed His Majesty’s Minister that he had been authorised by Ibn Baud to try to find some foreign firm to take up a concession for minerals (not oil) in some area or areas outside that covered by the concession granted to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. This disposes of the rumours (paragraph 113) that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate had secured a supplementary concession. Mr. Ali Reza stated that a German group was interested in gold-mining prospects in Saudi Arabia, and produced a telegram from Egypt purporting to bear out this statement. He proposes to visit England and to see whether the Department of Overseas Trade, to whom he has been given a letter of introduction, can put him in touch with some British company or companies who might be interested. 212 . One of the semi-official Saudi companies, the Arab Export Company, has produced a report for the first fourteen months of working. The only articles of export have been sheep and goat skins, of which the company claims to have exported 109,058 and 8,348 respectively. It is claimed that the quality of the skins has been so greatly improved by the action of the company that the price has risen from half a riyal to one rival, but it seems likely that any increase of price there has been is attributable partly to a general rise in world prices and partly to the fact that Messrs. Besse of Aden have been buying here to fill a shortage in supplies which has resulted from their expulsion from Ethiopia, The company claims to have made a profit of nearly 50,000 rivals, which amounts to about 24 per cent, of the paid-up capital. This profit they propose to distribute roughly as follows : three-fifths to the shareholders, one-fifth to the board of directors, one-tenth to charity and the rest to reserve. 213. Ibn Sand’s Indian chauffeur failed to establish the proposed transport company (paragraph 9), and the concession has now been granted to Muhammad Tawil, Director of Customs in Hasa. The most important of the conditions appeared in the Saut-al-Hejaz of the 25th May. The name of the company is to be the Nedji Car Company. The capital consists of £15,000 gold in 3.000 £5 shares. The functions of the company are the transport of pilgrims from ports in Nejd to the Hejaz and back, and the carriage of passengers between the Hejaz, Nejd and Hasa and between one Nejd town and another. The concession is for twenty years. No other company or person may carry passengers (? and pilgrims) for hire. 214. On one voyage this month the Khedivial steamship Talodi arrived carrying a considerable quantity of explosives which had been consigned from Suez to the small Egyptian port of Ras Ghulam, where the Talodi was to call after touching at Port Sudan and at Jedda (twice) and other Saudi ports. The Saudi authorities have no regulations on the subject, but, acting on the analogy of vessels which bring petrol from Aden and on such occasions are not allowed to carry more than twelve passengers (under the Indian Shipping Act), they refused to allow the vessel to embark more than twelve passengers for the Sudan instead of the much larger number who wished to travel by her. Eventually, the Minister of Finance allowed the Khedivial agents to leave all the explosives on a dhow in the outer harbour, and to pick them up on return. The problem arose again, however, when the Talodi wished to embark seventy passengers for Wejh. The agents were finally allowed to put the explosives on board again and to embarkall the passengers on giving a sort of guarantee to be responsible for anything that might happen. They believe that this guarantee did not increase the responsibility which was already incumbent on the owners under the law of the vessel s nationality (British). 215. The obligation to register slaves (paragraph 409 of December 1936) has been brought again to the attention of the Saudi public by a notice which^b appeared in the Umm-al-Qura of the 21st May. The text of the Saudi regulation is reproduced in full, and the particular attention of readers is drawn to articles 9 and 10 , under which the owner of a slave is required to register him within one year from the date of the regulation, and if he fails to comply with this provision the slave can demand a deed of manumission from the competent authorities. The Legation has not heard of any case where a slave has been registered, but there is still over four months to run, and the notice mentioned above is the first warning the public have had that there was any serious purpose behind the regulation other than that of freeing the country from the detested British right of manumission. 216. The Umm-al-Qura repeats its attack (paragraph 378 of November 1936) on the Hejaz custom of requiring excessive dowries with brides and on spending far too much on wedding ceremonies and feasts, and calls upon the younger generation to break with this harmful tradition. It would be interesting to know whether these articles were prompted by puritan feelings alone or were intended in part as a reminder to Hejazis restless under Nejdi taxation that an easy way of economy lies open to them. 217. The press announce the arrival at Mecca of one of the “travelling doctors asked for by the Department of Public Health,” and the return of another doctor, from whom much is expected, who has been touring the capitals of Europe for eight months studying the latest therapeutical methods. A grateful patient of the doctor attached to the Soviet Legation managed to get a paragraph inserted in the Saut-al-Hejaz thanking friends for condolences on his illness and praising the doctor for his skill, care and nobility of character. As no one has ever expressed gratitude to any doctor in Saudi employ in this fashion, it is expected that this paragraph will cause trouble. “ The new doctor at the Department of Public Health ” has been pilloried in the Umm-al-Qura for writing a prescription in a language other than Arabic. 218. Orders have been issued by the Amir of Jizan that in the matter of circumcision the tradition of the Prophet is to be followed. Boys are to be circumcised at an early age, and the practice is to be abandoned by which the ceremony was postponed until the age of 30 and the subject was then flayed in public, as a test of courage, from the scrotum, inclusive, to the navel. “ The tribes have met this order with welcome and without hesitation.” 219. The correct name of the Diesel motor-lorries which were acquired recently (paragraph 164) is Bussing-nag. 220. The Umm-al-Qura of the 28th May quotes the Egyptian newspaper A l Jehad in the following terms :— “A committee has recently been formed under the presidency of his Excellency Osman Muharram Pasha with the object of improving the road from Jedda to Mecca. The work of enlarging and paving the road is to be accomplished before the next pilgrimage. The committee has also decided, in agreement with the Saudi authorities, that one-half of the value of the wheat which the Egyptian Government send every year to the Hejaz will be ear marked for this object; the Saudi Government will also contribute a sum of £E. 20,000, collected from pilgrims during the last season. The total sum at the disposal of the committee will amount to £E. 50,000. In addition to the construction of the road, it is proposed to construct at Mecca one plant for the supply of water and one electric power station. Steps are now being taken to engage the necessary technical staff.” II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 221. The Iraq mission which went to San’a to try to secure the adhesion of the Imam to the Iraq-Saudi Treaty of Friendship and Alliance arrived in Jedda on the return journey on the 6 th' May and left for Bagdad via Egypt on the 9 th May. They gave'the Saudi Government a copy of a document signed by the Imam, and Fuad Bey eventually communicated to His Majesty’s Legation con-5 fidentially a copy of that copy. The Imam was to send to Ibn Sand a copy direct, but when the latest news was received from Riyadh it had not arrived. It is a question whether the Imam can be held to have adhered to the treaty. ITe as made many small changes in wording, and one or two major amendments, amendment to article 1 (b) he tries to limit the consultations referred to m ic ^•Ipreamble to matters relating to the “ ties of the Islamic laith and ot the 1 ia race.” As was expected, he has tried to evade any obligations under the Loyenant and the Kellogg Pact and the Anglo-Iraq 'treaty, but it is not certain that ms efforts to achieve this end have been successful in all cases. Article 4 (c), which defines certain acts which are not to be considered acts of aggression, has b eel J struck out, but the effect of this may be to involve the Imam in more instead ot fewer responsibilities. r t 222. The Saudi complaint (paragraph 413 of December 1936) that a hsriti^h aeroplane crossed the Transjordan frontier near Haditha on the 22nd Novembei has been disposed of by the Transjordan authorities. No British aeroplane new at all on the 22nd November, which was a Sunday, and none crossed the frontier between the 22nd November and the date of the complaint. 1 wo British aeroplanes coming from the north landed at Hazim during that period, and it is possible that the position of one of these was miscalculated. In transmitting the reply His Majesty’s Legation reminded the Saudi Government that it is extremely difficult for an observer on the ground to calculate the position of aircraft m the air with reference to any given point on the ground. . , , 223 During the conversations on the occasion of Mr. Rendel s visit (J ectfla report for March), Ibn Saud showed himself particularly sensitive about the Qatar frontier, and in general about the hemming-in process to which he alleged himself to be subjected by His Majesty’s Government on the Persian Gull. It seemed to His Majesty’s Legation that it would be better to leave the frontier discussion open for the present, and. as the next step (to be taken in the winter), to show some representative of Ibn Saud that Jabal Nakhsh is part ol Jabal Dukhan, and that the Saudi picture of the country thereabouts, as recorded m a Saudi note of the 3rd April, 1935, is quite wrong. His Majesty’s Government, however, both on general grounds and because the Qatar Oil Company may wish to prospect for oil in the disputed area shortly, consider that it may be necessary to make a unilateral declaration to Ibn Saud on the subject, and the question how this could be done with the least offence to Ibn Sand’s feelings is being considered. The question of the southern boundary has been reconsidered by the Government of Aden and the Colonial Office, and they have decided that the maximum concession that could be made would be to withdraw the line proposed by His Maiesty’s Government to the edge of the desert, which would mean abandoning to Saudi Arabia a belt of desert about 20 miles wide and more than 300 miles long. Any further concession, they point out, would introduce the influence of Ibn Snud among the tribes who belong indisputably to the south, and in teriitoiy which is never visited by Saudi tribes. i • p t i i 224. In connexion with recent legislation about the ownership ot land by foreigners in Bahrein, the position of Bahreinis in Saudi Arabia in the matter of the ownership of land is being examined. It is believed that few, if any, Bahreinis resident in the Hejaz claim the benefit of their foreign nationality. 225. A certain Salih-al-Din-al-Bakri has published the second volume of a Political History of the Hadhramaut. The Legation had not heard of this work before. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 226. To celebrate the Coronation of His Majesty King George VI, some 200 persons attended a reception at His Majesty’s Legation on the 12th May, amon 0, them most of the Saudi notables of Jedda and Mecca. On the 14th May His Royal Highness the Amir Feisal came to dinner at the Legation, with the Minister of Fmance, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs (Fuad Bey), and other leading Saudi officials. In typical May weather the Coronation festivities would have been damped by clammy heat, but a cool spell made us almost forget that we were in Jedda. The Legation did its best to live up to the standard of illumination and entertainment set at the Silver Jubilee. In paiticular, the picnic and party were not forgotten, and over eighty British children repeated the gambols and gorgings of 1935, whose memory had remained fresh in their minds.&lt;r 6 227. The question whether the discrimination against British subjects (as against other foreigners) in the Koshan regulation, mentioned in paragraph 207 above, is permissible or not is being considered. During the four slack months of the year, a British Indian merchant, for instance, who wants to go from Jedda to Mecca must pay a tax of about 7s. sterling, from which his Saudi neighbour is exempt, and if he goes to Medina the sum is about £3 85 . The only 4 ^ treaty provision having any bearing on the subject is article 5 of the Treaty of Jedda, which says that “ the principles of international law in force between independent Governments shall be respected,” and that is rather vague. 228. On the morning of Coronation Day His Majesty’s Minister received a letter in which the Italian Minister said that he would unfortunately be unable to attend the reception to be held that afternoon at His Majesty’s Legation. The whole of the Italian community, who had been expecting to attend, stayed away, to the amusement of the other foreigners, and, it seems, to their own personal regret. On the next occasion on which he met His Majesty’s Minister, M. Sillitti looked extremely self-conscious and confused. 229. The staff of the Italian Legation has been increased by the appointment of a first secretary, the Marchese Alberto Paveri Fontana, transferred from Vienna. It is apparently not intended ever to leave the Legation again in the charge of M. Bellini, the Levantine Italian vice-consul. This is just as well for Italy, as M. Bellini, who may be good enough at propaganda, is inclined to throw Mussolini’s weight about unsuitably. He has distinguished himself this month by behaving on an Italian vessel in such a fashion towards the quarantine doctor, who had done nothing that was open to reasonable criticism, that the doctor to the Italian Legation told him it was surprising that the Saudi did not punch him on the nose. 230. The Soviet Minister informs His Majesty’s Minister that, after months of negotiation, he has succeeded in reaching a settlement of the debt to the Soviet Government to the extent of obtaining an order from the Minister of Finance on the Banque Misr for the payment of the amount in twelve monthly instalments. M. Khakimoff is by no means convinced that there will be money in the bank when the dates of collection come round, but he says that the order will be discounted in London, and the Soviet Government will thus get at least something for the oil products which they supplied. 231. Mr. A. C. Trott arrived on the 3rd May to take the place of Mr. Calvert as His Majesty’s consul and first secretary. Mr. C. A. Gault, who is to take the place of Mr. Eyres shortly, arrived on the 20th May. Mr. Judd went on leave on the 16th May. 232. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah departed on the 16th May on long leave pending retirement, and the Legation loses, in the person of its Indian vice- consul, one of the best-known figures in the Hejaz. Hundreds of distinguished pilgrims have enjoyed his lavish hospitality (and none of them ever succeeded in inducing their host to accept even a small present in exchange), and, what is more important, thousands of undistinguished pilgrims are indebted to him for help and advice. Changing conditions in the Hejaz, e.g., the growth of chauvinism and the growing poverty of all those who live by the pilgrim trade, which makes them desperate and inclines the Government to give them a freer hand, have helped to make his position difficult for the last two or three years, and it is possible that a new man with all the diplomatic qualities may adapt himself with greater ease to the new circumstances; but that we shall ever find an Indian vice-consul who will spend his energies so generously in the defence of the interests of Indian pilgrims is hardly to be expected. Perhaps it was a fault that he had too high a standard for this country. He expected Indian pilgrims in the Hejaz to be safer from exploitation than the Wigan cotton operative on holiday at Blackpool. But it was a fault on the right side. IV .—M iscellaneous. 233. The Soviet lady doctor to the Royal ladies at Riyadh, Amina Alimbek, has gone home to recover from a serious illness. Mine. Fattahov (paragraph 48) is coming back. Her husband states that she is a great friend of the Albano- Turkish wife of the Amir Feisal, and that she expects to be invited to stay with the Amira at Taif. Mine. Fattahov, who, like her husband, is a Kirghiz, know's7 Turkish, and she visited Arab ladies assiduously during her short stay in Jedda and learned a good deal of Arabic. Mme. Litvin, wife of the second secretary, has left for Russia for a holiday. 234. The owners of the steamers which carry pilgrims between India and ^Ltejaz have informed the Government of India that the informal arrangement in “^pforce for some years by which the Saudi authorities allowed them to carry infants in arms without counting them as passengers has been denounced, and have asked that steps may be taken for its continuance. Since 1933, when the arrangement in question was made by the Legation, the Saudi authorities have adopted, for purposes of domestic legislation, a number of articles of the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1926, among them article 100 , which defines the number of passengers which may be carried on a pilgrim ship. Now the exclusion of children under one year from the count of passengers is legal under the definition of “ pilgrim ” in the Indian Shipping Act, and it is of advantage to pilgrims in that, since the children do not displace other passengers, the company can take them without charge; but it is contrary to the provisions of article 100 of the Paris Convention, and the Legation therefore deprecate the proposal that the Saudi authorities should be asked to make a concession on this point, on the ground that it would weaken our attempts to hold the Saudi Government to the convention in other respects. The proposal is all the weaker because the companies carrying Far Eastern pilgrims have decided not to ask for this derogation from article 100 . A correct attitude is all the more necessary because there are signs that the quarantine authorities would allow any number of excess pilgrims, even up to 50 per cent., to be carried, if only their palms were crossed by a given number of gold pounds. These authorities, however, should not be despised too severely by those whose salaries are paid on the nail. 235. The agents of the Dodge Car Company (paragraph 199) have sold forty cars to the Saudi Government and received 25 per cent, of the price in cash. They propose to open a service station here, but as for some time their chief clients will be the Government, who will expect their repairs to cost next to nothing, it is not expected that the station will pay for itself. 236. Colonel Etherton has aroused the not unreasonable anger of the Saudi Government by publishing in The Passing Show a catchpenny article about the Hejaz which is as offensive as it is in some respects untrue. He describes a non-existent slave market in Jedda, and relates an apocryphal incident, when referring to Ibn Saud’s many wives and children, of a meeting between Ibn Saud and a pretty girl and of his discovery, when he desired that she should be presented to him, that she was his daughter. If Colonel Etherton was taking revenge for his failure to obtain a concession, he was doing so at the expense of his country to some extent, for although the appearance of the article will prevent the writer from ever obtaining a Saudi visa again, it also damages the reputation of the British in general for veracity and good taste.J 1 ‘V &lt;$&gt; .... any further communication on this subject, please quote and address —not to any person by name, but to— / “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i.

Later, at the King’s invitation, His Majesty’s Minister called to present Commander Bowen, R.N., commanding H.M.S. Weston. On this occasion Ibn Saud was in a most genial mood. He mentioned the names of some of His Majesty's ships that he had seen or been in in the Persian Gulf, and, finally, stated that he liked sailors; in fact, preferred them to soldiers. This remark was well received by at least one of his hearers, to whom it was necessary to explain afterwards that while the navy might perhaps deserve the golden apple the contest was not a fair one, since Ibn Saud had only met sailors socially, whereas that ‘ ‘ hemming-in ’ ’ process on the Persian Gulf, of which he considers he has cause to complain, has had to be carried out by a distinguished line of British officials nearly all holding rank in the Indian army. 154. The Amir Saud, who returned from his visit to Iraq early in the month, also came to Jedda on the 20 th April. On the 21st he received the foreign representatives in turn (he received Commander Bowen with His Majesty’s Minister), and that evening he gave a large and fortunately open-air banquet to the foreign representatives, Commander Bowen and two other officers of H.M.S. Weston, and some thirty or forty amirs and notables. 155. The Amir Saud left for Suez, in H.M.S. Weston, on the 22 nd April, on his way to England for the Coronation, With equal ingenuity and self- sacrifice Commander Bowen had made room on his sloop for the Amir and three other persons, viz., Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, the Amir s private secretary and a servant, when almost at the last moment Ibn Saud asked whether room could be found for his son the Amir Muhammad, whom he wanted to send to England for medical treatment. Room was found, the size of H.M.S. Weston did not allow of the reception on board of all who considered it their duty to see the Amir Saud off (many hundreds), so a large (and very well-organised) reception was held at the custom-house, and the Amir was accompanied on board onlv bv some twenty other amirs—many of them apparently brothers, but some uncles oi cousins. The Amir Saud was obviously pleased with the generous accommoda tion provided for him on board and for his handsome reception there. It was a highly successful occasion, though a shadow was thrown over it for one observer by the presence of the large flock of sons and other relatives of Ibn Saud who seemed to live rather expensivelv on this poor country and do little for it in return. [6 t- 1 ] B1 r-r- ■ ■Hal 2 156. The King left Jedda for Mecca on the 22nd April, and left the Hejaz for Riyadh on the 26th. Probably he will not be seen again on this side of Arabia for another nine months or more. 157. Fnad Bey Hamza has not returned from the leave on which he departed rather mysteriously on the 6 th March (paragraph 107). Stories are current in Jedda that he has fallen from favour. Now that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin has gone to England with the Amir Saud, there is no one in the country able to deal with foreign affairs except the King. It is true that the King runs foreign affairs in any case, but at least Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, still more Fuad Bey, could talk about them to foreign representatives. The staff in the Ministry is now reduced to one or two very young Syrians and a lumpish Hejazi, who is reputed to have been put there as a make-weight. Whether the Amir Faisal does much as Viceroy or not, it is believed that he knows nothing about those foreign affairs for which he is nominally Minister. According to the Turkish Charge d'Affaires the Amir Faisal, when 'M. Palsay tried to discuss with him some eight or nine current questions, became more and more uncomfortable as he asked, with regard to each in turn, that it might be made the subject of a written communication. 158. According to the Saut-al-Hejaz, a Copt named Salama Musa has published in the Egyptian newspaper Misr an article reporting the formation in Egypt of a society entitled “ The Friends of the Hejaz,’' and having for its object, to ventilate Hejaz grievances and to work for the independence of the Hejaz. The Saut-al-Hejaz suggests that this heretic and unbeliever should mind his own business, and asks by what authority he has formed such a society. An angry article on the same subject has appeared in the Umm-al-Qura, and from a private source it is learned that the Saudi Government were so much disturbed by the article that they protested to the Government of Egypt, who, however, replied that the press in Egypt being free they could not take any action. The Hejazis have a grievance, viz., that most of the income from the pilgrimage, which was formerly their perquisite, now goes to Nejd, and a minor grievance that nearly all the important posts, whether in Nejd or in the Hejaz, are held by Nejdis. The news of the formation of the “Friends of the Hejaz’’ society, even if baseless, is not likely to check a regrettable tendency which the Legation notices in official Saudi circles, towards giving the Hejazis a freer hand with foreign pilgrims. 159. Early in April the Caproni aeroplane began to appear nearly every day for a short flight. Five of the ten Italian-trained Saudi pilots have now been discarded, but the remaining five are being given lessons on the Caproni by an Italian pilot, and it is stated that the training is to be completed by lessons given by the Russian refugee pilot, M. Naidyonoff, on a Wapiti and then on the French monoplane, which is described as the most difficult machine to fly. One of the Wapitis is working, and spare parts for the other three are on order. According to M. Naidyonoff, only one of the Saudi pilots has any air sense. The Amir Saud and some of the other amirs went up in the Caproni. It was reported that they were taken up by Saudi pilots, but in fact an Italian pilot was at the duplicate control and effected the landings. The other two Capronis, to complete the Italian gift, arrived from Rome on the 27th April. The Saudi authorities gave them a scurvy reception. The only persons who went to the landing-ground to meet them were the Commandant of Jedda and a customs official. The Italian Govern ment are providing military personnel for the gift aeroplanes by a system of six-monthly reliels. Ihe personnel for the one Caproni and the two remaining instructional machines was two pilots (one colonel, one captain) and four mechanics; other pilots and mechanics arrived with the other two Capronis. It is believed that the salaries of the personnel are paid by the Italian Govern ment, and that the Saudi Government contributes nothing but food and lodging. 160. The excellent Bellanca monoplane which the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have used for exploration and survey purposes has been offered to the Saudi Government for what is said to be the low price of £ 2 , 000 , but the offer has not been accepted. This machine has shown great reliability, but then the pilot and the mechanic, both Americans, seem to have been of unusual skill and experience. 101 . The employees of “ certain departments ’’ are stated by the press to have volunteered to contribute one month's pay towards the work of the Ministry of Defence and for aviation. It is not stated whether they have merely written of! some of the arrears of pay due to them, or have renounced their pay for some3 future month. Lists of contributors for this purpose, some of whom appeal 1 to he foreign pilgrims, have been published from time to time, but no total has been given. Sardar Syedna Taher Saifuddin, leader of the Bohra community (followers of the Agha Khan), contributed £1,000 gold for Saudi aviation, but then he and his large retinue had been living as guests of the Saudi Government throughout the pilgrimage. 162. The party that was prospecting for the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) in the northern half of the concession area has now left for London to report to headquarters. No definite statement of the result of the work has been made, but the impression left on the Legation is that not only have this party not found oil, but that their report will be so pessimistic that it is not certain that a more detailed examination of the ground will be made. 163. It is now known that Mr. Twitched has not succeeded in obtaining from the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate the concession which Colonels Etherton and Micklem sought to secure last November. The King has authorised Muhammad Ali Reza, one of the heads of the important firm of Haji Zainal, to try to obtain offers for a concession for certain areas which are apparently not identical with those for which Colonel Etherton tried to secure a concession. A member of the staff of the syndicate states that another gold mine has been discovered at Araiq, north of Teima, and that a nugget was found there which yielded seven ounces of gold. 164. Twenty Diesel-engined lorries arrived for the Saudi Government towards the end of March, and it is believed that fifteen more are to follow. A German Jew, who claimed to be a nephew of Ballin, came to Jedda to show the local people how to run the lorries. He spoke Arabic well and appeared to be well acquainted with the East. The makers of the lorries are said to be (?) Businach, and the price £350 gold apiece, payable on what has been described as a “ deposit-cum-Inshallah ” basis. 165. Messrs. Sharqieh have recently imported seven wireless telegraph j transmitting sets costing £4,000. These are not to replace any existing sets, but &gt; are additional to them. A report in the local press speaks of eleven new sets, some I of which are to be installed on the northern frontier between Tebuk and ! Qaryat-al-Milh. 166. The Amir Abdullah, one of the King’s brothers, who is described as an enlightened man with a great interest in mechanics, has recently imported from Egypt a number of water-wheels of the type which can be worked by one animal by means of a beam which turns geared wheels operating an endless string of buckets. These water-wheels are to be installed in Nejd. 167. The first annual balance-sheet of the Saving and Economic Company (paragraph 333 of 1936) shows a sum for distribution as profit which works out at 37 per cent, on the capital. I nfortunately, the balance-sheet shows the capital as part of the gross revenue, and is in other ways difficult to follow, so it is possible that the proposed dividend is not what it seems. 168. The 1/ mm-al-Qura reports the establishment of a medical centre at Hail for the double purpose of giving medical treatment to the local population and watching the health conditions of the pilgrimage route from Nejef. From private sources it has been learned that incoming pilgrims were watched by an Indian sub-assistant surgeon, formerly employed from time to time in the Leo-ation dispensary at Mecca, whom the Saudi Government engaged temporarily for the purpose. A dispenser formerly employed by the Legation states that he is now working as dispenser, dentist and surgeon at the Government hospital at Medina His dental knowledge he acquired in Egypt in eighteen months; his surgical knowledge is such as a dresser acquires from watching operations. 169. The press announces the formation of a limited liability company which is to build a large chemist’s shop where the public can purchase medicines at reasonable prices. This scheme is believed to have resulted from a fit of annoyance to which the King gave way recently about the lack of essential dru°*s. u ma u ny P ro . mi . nen ! persons, among them the Amir Faisal, are putting monev iiRo the scheme, it is not certain that the prices will be reasonable. An unpleasant lumour has reached the Legation that the promoters of the scheme foresee a time when the foreign missions which maintain dispensaries for their pilgrims will not be allowed to import drugs, but will be compelled to purchase their requirements from the company’s shop. 170. An Arab convicted of the murder of a boy was decapitated in public this month. 1 [6 t— 1 ] B o4 II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 171. The mission from Iraq to the Yemen (paragraph 122) left Jedda lor Hudaida on the 8 th April. According to the Saudi Government, the delegation will try to induce the Imam to accept the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Friendship and Alliance as it stands, and, if he refuses, will suggest that he should sign it with a ^ ! reservation disclaiming obligations to any country not a party to the treaty. Ibn Baud, who is bound by article 17 of the Covenant of the League and by the Kellogg Pact, thought it hard that Iraq should be prepared to offer more generous terms to the Yemen than to him. but considered it beneath his dignity to say so to j the delegation. 172. On the departure of the Iraq delegation the Saut-al-Hejaz published an article on Arab unity, which it described as no longer a thing of the imagination, but a tangible fact. ' The article concluded : “ We pray for their success in their work, and take the opportunity to reassure the Arabs of the different parts of the peninsula as to the future of their problem. For this young kingdom and its Iraq colleague, in spite of the weight of their burden, will continue to strive to that end with all their strength.' 173. Ibn Baud seems to have been touched by the splendid reception which was accorded to the Amir Baud in Iraq, where he spent some nine days, from the 27th March to about the 5th April. 174. Ibn Baud has raised again the question of the exploitation of any oil that there may be in the Koweit Neutral Zone. Having got himself into a hole by giving an option over his share to the Standard Oil Company, he is asking for the advice of His Majesty’s Government as to the best way of getting something done. The raising of the question at this moment may give colour to the fears expressed by the sheikh, two or three years ago, that Ibn Baud might use the blockade as a means of blackmail to ensure the exploitation of the oil in the neutral zone, but probably Ibn Baud’s lack of money and the disappointment attending the search for minerals and gold in Saudi Arabia are sufficient to explain his appeal to His Majesty’s Government, though the recent visit of certain London and New York directors of the Standard Oil Company may have had something to do with it. 175. The latest Saudi proposals regarding the Koweit blockade have been sent to all concerned, but without much hope of a settlement on that basis. The Saudi Government have dropped three of their proposals, viz., that every caravan from Saudi Arabia should be accompanied by a Koweit or a Saudi official, that such caravans should only leave on specified days, and that no Bedouin should be allowed to shop in Koweit unless in possession of a Saudi permit specifying what and how much he might buy. On the other hand, they say they feel compelled to insist that Saudi subjects making personal purchases should only leave in parties which should conform to the procedure applicable to caravans, and that “ Bon-Voisinage ” and Extradition Agreements should come into force (paragraph 114) at the same time as the trade agreement. 176. Thanks to the receipt of information from the High Commissioner at Jerusalem, the Legation was able to inform Ibn Saud, before he had heard the report published in a Damascus newspaper that there was a Jewish plot to assassinate the Mufti, that the report was baseless. 177. Mr. Daniel Oliver, a Quaker schoolmaster well known in the Lebanon, spent a few days at Jedda this month. Owing to his attitude towards the Palestine question, he had been recommended to Ibn Saud by Fuad Bey. Ibn Saud came down to Shumaisi to meet him. Mr. Oliver professed to be well satisfied with the interview, and to be convinced of Ibn Baud’s good sense and moderation in regard to the problem of Palestine, but he said that Ibn Saud did not disguise the gravity of the crisis. Mr. Oliver had intended to make an attempt to see the Imam, but abandoned his plan for lack of time. His Majesty’s Minister conveyed to the Saudi Government a warning that Mr. Oliver had no authority to speak on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. 178. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin referred with satisfaction to a recent meeting to discuss affairs in general between Major Glubb, Officer Commanding, Desert Area, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Zaid, the Saudi Frontier Inspector. 1 179. At the end of the month news was received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of trouble between Bahrein and Qatar as to the allegiance of the Naim tribe at Zubara, and of the possibility that the Naim, who appeared to5 have been invoking the name of Ibn Sand against the Sheikh of Qatar, might emigrate to Saudi Arabia. Colonel Fowle considers that the Naim should be allowed to migrate to Saudi Arabia if they wish, and that it is unlikely that a force which is alleged to have been sent towards Qatar by the Amir of Hasa will encroach on Qatar territory. These views coincide with those of His Majesty s Legation in Jedda. III .—Relations with Poivers outside A rabia. 180. The local newspapers have published two further lists of foreigners who are stated to have acquired Saudi nationality. No information is given beyond the names, but an analysis of one list of about 120 persons suggests that about 10 of them are of Indian origin, over 40 are Hadhramis and nearly 20 are Sudanis or Takrunis. The procedure which Fuad Bey once said he supported, whereby whenever a foreigner became naturalised as a Saudi subject the Jedda representative of his Government should be informed, has not been followed. His Majesty’s Minister asked Sheikh Yusuf Yasin whether any of the naturalised persons concerned were in possession of British passports, and requested that in such cases the passports should be transmitted to His Majesty’s Legation without delay. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin admitted that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were in possession of some British passports handed over by certain naturalised British subjects, but said that they were in a difficulty because the Italians objected to the grant of Saudi nationality to certain categories of Italian subjects, e.g., Libyans, and the French had similar views about some of their subjects, and if the Saudi Government handed over the British passports to the British Legation they would have to act in the same way towards the Italian and French Legations, and that would be awkward. The question is being pursued. 181. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin raised with His Majesty’s Minister the question of British help in securing arms (paragraph 126). He did not produce the expected list of requirements, but said that Ibn Saud thought it would be better that His Majesty’s Government, since they considered that their interests and those of Saudi Arabia in regard to the Red Sea were identical, should state what help they could afford so that Saudi Arabia might be as well prepared as possible for self-defence, It appeared that what Ibn Saud had in mind was payment by easy instalments, reduction in price and “ in general any help ” that could be afforded. The most urgent need was stated to be rifles, guns, machine guns and “ tanks.” When asked whether it was really tanks they wanted and not armoured cars, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said both or either. 182. Ibn Saud sent His Majesty’s Minister a message (adding that he begged His Majesty’s Government not to think that he was trying to play one country off against another) to the effect that the Italian Minister had informed the Saudi Government that the Italian Government were prepared to sell them either German or Italian rifles or machine guns. The Saudi Government would be prepared to buy some German rifles if they could get them cheap (they do not want Italian), but the price mentioned by the Italian Minister is not low enough. 183. The departure of the heir apparent for England to represent his father at the Coronation is referred to in paragraph 155. 184. It is not only in connexion with the booking of pilgrims’ return passages (paragraph 144) that the Legation has had difficulty. There is a general tendency among Saudi authorities (though this is complicated by personal considerations of a temporary character) to disregard representations by the Legation and to demand that British subjects should be left to deal with the local authorities as best they can. This attitude, which might be reasonable elsewhere, is out of place as applied to pilgrims who do not know the country or the language, are here for a very short time, and are in the hands of their guides. Nor is confidence increased when the Saudi Government ask that complainants should be referred to the proper authorities mentioned in their guide for pilgrims, and it is found that of the five committees appointed by the Saudi Government to help pilgrims and hear their complaints three are composed exclusively of guides, one is the Pilgrimage Commission at Mecca, which has quite different functions, and the fifth is a committee at Jedda consisting of men so unimportant that it is considered that their price would be over-estimated at 5 rupees a head. When the Legation applied to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on behalf of an Indianpilgrim who claimed that his wife had disappeared in Mecca some weeks before and was asked to refer the complaint to the proper authorities, it was possible to inform the Ministry that, according to the man’s complaint, he had already applied to the police, orally and in writing, and had then sent a written petition to the Viceroy (who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs), and that no action had been taken. 185. The Italian Minister asked Sheikh Yusuf Yasin whether the despatch of the Iraq delegation to the Yemen (paragraph 171) had not been instigated by the British. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin replied in the sense of statements made by him and Fuad Bey to the Italian and French representatives at the time of the signature of the treaty in 1936. He said that the treaty was a purely Arab affair, and that not only was it not promoted by the British, but many observers thought it was directed against the British, e.*/., in regard to Palestine. According to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, this reasoning appeared to satisfy M. Sillitti. 186. After an interval of about five months the Italian Legation resumed on the 24th April the distribution of propaganda newspapers from Libya. Most of them were full of articles about Signor Mussolini’s visit, and one contained the notorious proclamation in which Marshal Balbo said : “ The Duce is the protector of Islam.” But one article, published in the Barid-al-Barea of the 8 th March, was violently anti-British and slightly less anti-French. It cleverly classed the Arabs with the Romans and the Fascists as enlightened colonisers, as opposed, e.q., to the British, under whom the population of Australia has been reduced from 20 million to 25.000 by massacre, exile and neglect, while wealthy India has been brought down to poverty and misery bv colonists who suck her blood while people die of hunger. 187. A message to Ibn Sand from His Majesty’s Minister, that the appre hension about Italian designs which he had expressed on more than one occasion should have been laid to rest for ever by the appearance of Signor Mussolini as the protector of Islam, is said to have entertained him, and at the same time to have stimulated a flow of remarks which would have given the Duce little pleasure had he overheard them. A character in Roman history whom Signor Mussolini '° es boast about is Galiguia, who would have placed a statue of himself in the Holy of Holies at Jerusalem if he hadn’t died first. 188. Reports that there is to be an Italian hospital in Jedda continue to circulate, but Sheikh Tusuf Yasin says that they are unfounded The Italian dispensary is, however, to be reopened. The destitute Italian pilgrims (para graph 130) were at length shipped off. 6 VF 18J. The staff of the Italian Legation is to be reinforced by the appoint ment ot a first secretary, who is being transferred from Vienna. A very prominent inhabitant of the Italian Legation is a Frenchwoman, whom the new Minister refers to as the “ femme-de-chambre,” and as the Minister is a bachelor tins has given rise to the malicious rumour that this is a high Roman retort to the lad\ with an absent Italian husband who keeps house for the French Minister 190. r l he Turkish Charge d’Affaires did not go to Sana (paragraph 32). It appears that the intention was that M. Palsay should spend about four months ot the year in Jedda and four at Sana, and his appointment as Charge d’Affaires to the Yemen was gazetted, but the sudden death of Mme. Palsay upset this arrangement for this year. It is puzzling to a foreigner that the Turkish Uovernment should have sent to this post, where they have almost no interests an official who has held several of the highest positions in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Angora The aim seems to have been to make handsome reparation for the scandals referred to in paragraph 91. M. Palsay carries reparation to extremes by refusing to take advantage of his diplomatic immunity in the matter ot customs dues. i V .—M isceuaneous . m It was found that about twenty-five Indian pilgrims were being prevented from leaving the country because they could not pay the fees due to their mutawwifs. A private letter was sent to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin by His Majesty s Minister, expressing sympathy with the mutawwifs, who were thus deprived of their dues, but maintaining that once the Saudi authorities allowed such people to land in Jedda and to perform the Haj, to prevent their return home was inflicting needless hardship upon them without benefit to the mutawwifs. The destitutes were allowed to go by the next boat. The difficultyis in the first place the fault of the pilgrims themselves, who set out with just enough money to purchase their return tickets and arrive in the Hejaz without means to pay the Government dues and the fees of the mutawwifs. But the Government are also responsible, in that through fear of hostile propaganda in India they will not adopt the only effective measure of sending back to India as soon as they arrive all pilgrims who come by sea without money to pay the dues and fees. Moreover, the Saudi Government have recently cancelled the discount of so much per cent, that was formerly allowed to the mutawwifs to compensate them for a certain proportion of destitutes, and this has induced the mutawwifs to be more strict with the pilgrims in the hope of getting at least a little blood out of these unprofitable stones. 192. An official communique announces that in future additional fees amounting to 50 piastres will be collected by the Treasury from the estates of deceased pilgrims to cover certain burial expenses. 193. Mr. Maxwell Darling’s plans to include the crossing of Arabia in his tour of investigation into the breeding places of the desert locust were approved by the Saudi Government (paragraph 434 of 1936), but were wrecked by the incompetence of the semi-official Arabian Car Company. The Legation had been led to believe that the Saudi authorities would provide transport at Uqair and charge for it in the ordinary way, but as the time approached they were informed that no transport was to be had on the Persian Gulf side and that the Legation should arrange with the car company in Jedda to send cars from here. The car company then said that they had no cars to spare (the pilgrimage rush was over, but the car casualties must have been enormous), but were prepared to purchase cars in Bahrein and hire them out to Mr. Darling. After much telegraphing to Bahrein the Legation learned that Mr. Darling was prepared to pay the terms demanded for two cars, viz., £100 gold plus payment for any petrol used in excess of 240 gallons. The company then stated, however, that the price of the new cars was higher than had been expected, and that the charge would be £150 gold, and Mr. Darling rejected this proposal and decided to return by another route. 194. Mr. Philby left for England on the 2nd April. He has his new book to write, and he is due to give two lectures on his recent journey in London in November. He has resigned his position as Jedda correspondent of Great Britain and the Near East. He was the only Englishman in Jedda who was free to express his opinions, and as he never wished to express any opinion that was displeasing to the Saudi authorities he got on very well. It will be difficult to find a successor for him. 195. Mr. Lefevre-Arnold, whom Mr. Philby tried unsuccessfully to secure as an assistant (paragraph 141), returned to Jedda to take up an appointment with the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. Mr. James (British) has also joined the staff of the syndicate. 196. The oldest foreign resident in Jedda, M. Achilles Evlogimenos, died suddenly this month. He was noteworthy for many reasons. He was the only non-Moslem to keep a shop in Jedda. Until he managed to secure Greek papers he for a long time had no nationality (unless it was Ottoman), for he was a Cypriot who left the island before the date of its annexation. Although an Ottoman Greek he married a Jewess. Finally, although a Greek grocer he was apparently generous and confiding, and lent money freely to people who could never repay it. His death raises the question whether his Cypriot assistant, or his widow, will be allowed to carry on the business. It is believed that the Saudi authorities are opposed in principle to the presence of non-Moslems in the bazaar, and only allowed Achilles to carry on in virtue of a permit he held from the days before the Saudi regime began. They are at present acting in a highly exclusive manner in the matter of the deceased’s estate, and the French Legation, which is in charge of Greek interests, is not being allowed to intervene in any way. 197. On the 13th April the Legation received a telegram from Aden signed “ Stevens Lewis Farago,” asking that permission be obtained for them to land at Jizan and proceed overland to Jedda. As the Legation had no information about these people, no action was taken on this singular request. It appears from paragraph 6373 of the Aden Intelligence Summary No. 531, that they are journalists employed by the Keystone Press Agency, and that they had made an unsuccessful attempt to go to Sana. The party reached Jedda by sea and left after a short stay. They did not make themselves known to the Legation, where their nationality is still unknown.■ I'wa 8 198. According to the Saut-al-Hejaz a certain Professor Mustafa Andarqiri and a group of educated young men propose to publish for a time a monthly magazine in Arabic and Malay entitled The Voice of Islam, which will deal with religious, literary and social matters in Saudi Arabia. The object of the magazine will be “to serve the relations between the Arabs and the Javanese.” (N.B.— “ Javanese ” includes British Malays in ordinary parlance in this country.) 199. An American, representing the Dodge Car Company, spent a few days at Jedda with two Syrians, who are apparently agents for the company in Beirut. It is understood that they propose to open an agency here, and that they are confident that they can secure important orders.EASTERN (Arabia). May 4, 1937. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 2437/580/25] Copy No* 1 2 (S Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received May 4.) No. 55. Secret.) Sir, Jedda, April 1 , 1937. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for March 1937. 2 . Copies have been distributed as in the list in paragraph 67. 105. HIS Majesty King Abdul Aziz came to Jedda without warning on the 13th March, and received the foreign representatives the same day. He left the detested dampness of Jedda for Mecca on the 24th March. He seemed to be in very good health, in spite of the fatigue which the pilgrimage season must involve for him, and also in very good humour. 106. His Highness the Amir Saud left Riyadh for Iraq on the 23rd March. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, who was to accompany him as far as Bagdad, whence he will return to his post in London, left Mecca on the 22nd to overtake him. His Highness will return to Saudi Arabia, and will leave for England, for the Coronation, on the 22nd April. 107. Fuad Bey Hamza left hurriedly on the 6 th March, giving as his reason the illness of his only child, whom he was taking to Beirut. The information from other sources does not support his statement that the child was very ill. His abrupt departure immediately before the arrival of Mr. Rendel naturally gave rise to speculation. One reason is probably his intense jealousy of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Minister in London, who was accompanying Mr. Rendel throughout his tour in Arabia and would naturally be present at any conversations with the King that might take place. . 108. The limitation of rents is foreshadowed in an article in the Saut-al- Hejaz. The Legislative Assembly has drafted a regulation on cruelty to animals. A tribesman who attacked another and cut off his hand has had his own cut off as a punishment. 109. The question of foreign Haramain Waqfs, i.e., properties abroad dedicated to Mecca and Medina, has come to the front again, and the Association that exists to study the matter has been holding meetings. 110 . I hirty candidates for the Military School are required. The course is for two years, and students will receive a salary during their training. Those who pass out first class will become second lieutenants; those who get a second will be given “ the rank next below that of second lieutenant.” 111 . The press has had several articles and paragraphs about Asir. The inhabitants are represented as having been in a parlous state until taken over by the Saudi Government. The hand of every man was against his neighbour’s. The men were idle creatures, refusing to ply a trade to supplement their agricultural work, and therefore starving in bad years, while their womenfolk, who could vie with the beauties of Andalusia, would carry firewood on their heads a distance of four hours. Things are much better now. The Amir of Asir, Turki-al-Sudairi, is set upon the improvement of agriculture, and the police authorities have ordered that fruit trees should be planted in front of houses and shops. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Jedda Report for March 1937. I .—^Internal Affairs. [6 d—2] B112. That these accounts of Asir are not exaggerated is supported by what Mr. Philby says about Najran, which he visited in the course of his recent journey. He says that it is difficult to believe that this province, where there is now perfect tranquillity, was until recently one of the most disturbed areas in the world. He spoke highly of the Amir Nashmi, the Amir of Najran, to whom he attributed much of the credit, and hoped that rumours of his removal were baseless (the press has since announced that the Amir Nashmi has “ resigned ”). One defect of Saudi administration was its lack of confidence in good subordinates. Mr. Philby said that nowhere in Saudi Arabia, throughout his journey, did he hear a shot fired, except by his own party for specimens or for the pot. He had been able to mark the whole of the Saudi-Yemen frontier with the help of the tribal sections concerned, except at one point where the inhabitants, who were in disgrace with Ibn Saud for refusal to pay blood money for two murders, mistook his party for Government people and retreated to the hills. 113. During the King’s stay in Jedda, Mr. Twitchell had interviews with him which seem to have been satisfactory, and it is supposed that he may have received permission to prospect outside the area of the present concession. Colonel Etherton (paragraph 14), also a bidder for mining concessions, did not appear again. One engineer of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate has gone north towards the Transjordan border, and before he went he spoke of the possi bility of finding coal in the limestone country there. Nothing that has been heard about the Cot of Gold mine leads one to suppose that the water to work it on a paying basis has yet been found. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 114. I he question of the Koweit blockade, which seemed at one moment this month to be more hopeful, now seems as far from solution as ever. For one thing, it has been discovered that Ibn Saud regards it as essential that an agreement of Bon-yoisinage ’ ’ and an extradition agreement with Koweit should come into force simultaneously with the proposed arrangement about the resumption of trade, whereas it had been believed that negotiations for these agreements would be begun after the resumption of trade. The Saudi Government consider that they are losing one-third of their revenue in the Hasa Province by smuggling, and refuse to believe that the resumption of trade with Koweit, by increasing normal opportunities of profit, would diminish smuggling. Moreover, there is Ibn Saud’s deep personal distrust of the Sheikh of Koweit. The sheikh regards himself as an innocent person robbed of his legitimate trade by Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud says, confidentially but quite plainly, that the sheikh is the director of smuggling from Kqweit into Saudi Arabia and makes money by Ibn Saud’s loss. His Majesty’s Minister has also been informed by the Saudi Government, confidentially, that several men have recently been executed by them for smuggling. This information was imparted as a proof that the prevention of smuggling is a vital question for Saudi Arabia. 115. In one of the conversations held during Mr. Rendel’s visit, Ibn Saud spoke of his anxiety about Palestine, not only on account of the Arabs, but on account of His Majesty’s Government, too. He referred to the difficulty of his own position in the matter, and indicated that there were limits to the help he could afford in the maintenance of peace. A few days later he heard on his wireless that His Majesty’s Government had empowered the High Commissioner for Palestine to commute to some lesser penalty the death sentences passed on certain Arabs for crimes committed during the recent disorders, and he asked His Majesty’s Minister to convey to His Majesty’s Government his thanks for this politic act of clemency. 116. Mr. Philby reports that he recently asked Ibn Saud for a statement about Palestine which he could publish if he wished : Ibn Saud talked about the matter in a general way, but, two days later, in open Majlis, he made a careful statement to this effect:— (1) The presence of Jews in Palestine is not in the interests of His Majesty’s Government. ( 2 ) In case of war, His Majesty’s Government would have to keep a large force in Palestine to repress any possible Arab rising.3 (3) If things went on like this, a massacre of Jews by Arabs was inevitable. Mr. Philby then asked Ibn Sand, he said, whether he considered the Zionist policy right (“ haqq ”) or wrong (“ dhulm ”= tyranny, injustice), and Ibn Baud replied, without hestitation : ‘ ‘ dhulm. ’ ’ 117. While it is true, as was stated in paragraph 79 last month, that the Mufti of Palestine made no reference to the Palestine question in public, it has been ascertained that several of the speakers at the meeting at Muna expressed sympathy with the Palestine Arabs, and that at least some of them were applauded. 118. Ibn Baud showed great anxiety about Iraq, which he considers to be in the hands of pro-Turks. The recent replacement of men whom with all their faults he considered Arabs has revived the fear of Turkish encroachment on Arab lands which he has always feared, and the Turkish policy concerning Alexandretta has not tended to calm those fears. Ibn Baud has, however, been greatly touched by the splendid reception which the Amir Baud is reported to nave been given in Bagdad. 119. For some time the Saudi Government have refused to continue the discussion of the lie of the frontier between Transjordan and Nejd, on the ground that they required more information. They were apparently intensely suspicious of His Majesty’s Government in this matter. A discussion with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin during Mr. Renders visit (paragraph 92) ended in a suggestion from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that a joint commission should make a survey and a map, and that the two parties should then try to come to an agree ment by discussion on the basis of the old map and the new one. It was pointed out to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that at least this would involve a greater expenditure in time and money, since there would have to be a delimitation commission after the discussion, but it was finally decided to recommend the proposal to His Majesty’s Government as the one most likely to lead to a settlement, and as being free from any fundamental objection, since it seems certain that in any case the frontier will eventually be delimited according to the places shown on the old map. 120. It is reported in paragraph 6336 of the Aden Summary that notice of the impending arrival of the three sons of the Imam at Jedda (paragraph 77) had been sent to Ibn Baud in advance, and that they were therefore disappointed and angry to find no one to meet them and to have to land with the ordinary pilgrims. It is true that they were not met, but it seems that the message announcing their arrival had gone astray. The Saudi Government were much concerned at the misunderstanding, and throughout the stay of Saif-al-Islam Husain and his two brothers they did their best to eft'ace the memory of the unhonoured arrival by showing them the greatest courtesy and lavish hospitality in Mecca, Medina and Taif. 121. The Legation have secured a copy of an open letter which is stated to have been distributed widely in the Yemen, calling upon the Imam to replace his son Ahmad by Husain as heir apparent, and saying that otherwise civil war must occur before the Imam’s honourable coffin has reached the cemetery. The Saudi Government seem to hold similar views. They regard the Yemen as seething with indignation against the foreign Minister, a Turk believed to be in Italian pay, and his protector, Saif-al-Islam Ahmad, the heir apparent, and consider that unless Ahmad and Raghib are removed from their positions civil war will break out on the death of the Imam, or perhaps before. Their attitude if this should happen would be neutrality; they withdrew after the Saudi-Yemen war, and they are not going to change their policy in that respect. If both parties appealed to Ibn Baud he would consult the rest of the Moslem world as to the best means of putting an end to the conflict. 122 . The mission from Iraq, headed by Jamil Madfai, which is on its way to Sana to invite the Imam to adhere to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty, reached Jedda via Egypt on the 30th March. 123. In return for his kindness to Mr. Philby the Sheikh of Shabwa was invited to come on the pilgrimage and to stay with Mr. Philby in Mecca. He did so. According to Mr. Philby the Imam of'the Yemen, excited by Mr. Philby’s journey, which he took as an attempt by Ibn Baud to secure fresh adherents, wrote to various sheikhs, including the Sheikh of Shabwa, urging them to come under his rule. The Sheikh of Shabwa is said to have replied : “ First there came [6 d 2 ] B 2I Feisal-al-Saud, and now Philby (i.e., Ibn Sand) has come, and we don’t want / anyone else.” The force of this was diminished by another remark made by / Mr. Philby, who quoted Ibn Saud as saying that you could not do anything for the Arabs because of the Arabs themselves and that he once received all sorts of assurances from the Sheikh of Qatar, and was then shown by the British assurances in exactly the same sense from the sheikh to the British Government. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 124. His Majesty’s Minister was received by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz on the 18th March, when he presented fresh credentials, in the name of His Majesty King George VI. 125. In the course of their tour Mr. and Mrs. Bendel reached Uqair on the 6 th March. They made short stays at Hufuf and Riyadh, and reached Ashaira, where they were met by Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Eyres, on the 14th. After a night spent in a mountain village where they had been overtaken by nightfall while the tents pitched for their reception were still two hours away, and a night at Taif in a charming villa built by an official of the Ministry of Finance out of arrears of pay, they reached Jedda on the 17th March. The Saudi Govern ment made the most generous if not the most efficient arrangements for their journey. One night they slept in a regal tent so enormous that it proved too much ior its transport and was never seen again, while the kitchen arrangements were on such a scale that they either made the desert blossom like the Ritz or else left the travellers, by the breakdown of the transport, to dine on biscuits and water. In Jedda a programme of entertainment had been prepared which seemed likely to give an undesirably official character to the visit. Mr. and Mrs. Rendel were to be the King’s guests, and dinners were to be given by the King, the Amir Feisal, and the Minister of Finance, Abdullah Sulaiman. The authorities were persuaded to allow their guests to stay at His Majesty’s Legation and to turn Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman’s dinner into a tea-party, and although the King came to the party its private character was emphasised by the presence of Mrs. Rendel, for whom Ibn Saud made a very rare exception to his rule not to receive European ladies. At his own dinner and at this tea-party the King was in great form laughing at highly curious tales and animal habits, teasing Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who is something of a butt, for his alleged greed, and pulling the leg of Mr. Philby for being able to live on nothing for long periods when supplies are short and at other times eating all the food in sight. 126. Mr. RendeTs visit was by no means entirely occupied with feasting. His Majesty’s Minister and he had four interviews with Ibn Saud of an average length of about two hours. Ibn Saud always goes through the whole history of his relations with His Majesty’s Government whenever he gets hold of a new British Minister, and this time he had also a member of the staff of the Foreign Office as a listener. Although Mr. Rendel’s visit was unofficial, and although the more important statements he was able to make had already been made to the Saudi Minister m London and by Sir Andrew Ryan to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs here, to hear them in a voice that breathed from Downing Street evidently gave them a quite different value. The interviews were of the most fi iendly chai acter, and the King talked quite violently about his detestation of the Italians and his suspicions of their intentions. No progress was made with the question of the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia, which Mr. Rendel had studied on the spot with particular care. Some of the subjects discussed are mentioned elsewhere in this report. The King spoke of a scheme of aviation for which he wanted British assistance, and His Majesty’s Minister has since been informed that they would also like help in securing favourable terms for the establishment of a cartridge factory at Riyadh and for the purchase of o-uns, shells and machine-guns. The aviation scheme turns out to be rather ambitious! The Saudi Government wish to begin with ten military aeroplanes complete with workshops, &amp;c., and Saudi pilots. 127. To add to the slight embarrassment caused by the rather too official character given to Mr. Rendel’s visit by the Saudi Government, there appeared at Jedda during the visit a retired officer of the Royal Air Force, Squadron- Leader James, who was acting on an invitation from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. When it is added that Mr. Philby fresh back from his mysterious journey wasD at all the festivities, all the elements of a secret service novel are present. However, His Majesty’s Minister was able to inform the Italian Minister that one of the last things Mr. Rendel had done in London was to have an interview with M. Crolla, the Italian Charge d'Affaires, in which both parties confirmed their adherence to the Rome Understanding of 1927 about the Red Sea Coast of Arabia, &amp;c. 128. Signor Luigi Silitti (paragraph 84) arrived on the 10 th March to take up his appointment as Italian Minister at Jedda, presented his credentials to Ibn Saud on the 13th and was entertained at dinner by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin the following day. It appears that he has never seen Sydney, where he had only just been appointed when the post at Jedda fell vacant. He spent many years in consular posts in the United States. Signor Silitti seemed disappointed with his first call on Ibn Saud. He informed His Majesty’s Minister that he found Ibn Saud very guarded, and concluded that he was a very clever fellow, who would never give himself away. 129. The press made no further references to the Eritrean (? Ethiopian) pilgrims mentioned in paragraph 85. A private report, however, says that at the meeting at Muna a Somali got up and made a speech in favour of Italy and against the Negus. Ibn Saud told His Majesty’s Minister that the Italians tried hard, but without success, to induce him to say something in favour of their pro-Moslem policy. Reports from Medina state that a Moslem employee of the Italian Legation went there with the Italian pilgrims and hired several houses, where they were provided with free lodging, light and water. Among the pilgrims, it is stated, were some forty Somali non-commissioned officers and men in the Italian forces, and they were said to have been told that the Italian Government were going to send a similar party every year. The Italians are said to be intending to buy a house, or houses, at Medina for their pilgrims. 130. As a contrast to the subsidised Italian pilgrims, hundreds of destitutes from Italian Somaliland are drifting about the streets of Jedda waiting for repatriation. Members of the staff of the Italian Legation state that they constitute a serious problem, as it is extremely difficult to obtain transport for them. One of them, in reply to a question, said that it was not in the power of the Italian Government just to order a shipping company to send a ship for the destitutes; the companies required payment on a high scale. Meanwhile, the Italian Legation have been forced to give relief to the destitutes—at the rate of a dollar a head a day. 131. It seems that the Italian vice-consul recently revived the proposal to build a hospital here. He told the Director of Public Health that the Italian Government would like to build a hospital for the Saudi Government, and described the plan. And then, the Director enquired, the hospital would be handed over to the Saudi authorities to run ? M. Bellini asked whether it would not be a good thing to have an Italian doctor in charge, but the Director said that they could have nothing to do with such a scheme. Not long afterwards, the Royal Palace at Mecca was startled to hear a broadcast from Bari stating that Ibn Saud had agreed to build a hospital at Mecca for Italian subjects. 132. The Italian journalist, “ Aponte,” who was in Jedda recently (para graph 393 of 1936), has published in the Corriere della Sera an article containing a slightly anti-British paragraph which is attributed to Euad Bey by name and an untruthful and rather more anti-British paragraph based on information, some of which almost certainly came from Fuad Bey. This is not the first time that Fuad Bey has done on his own account some political propaganda in the press that his master might not approve. 133. M. Palsay, the Turkish Charge d’Affaires, has been finding amusement in a report written by one of his predecessors, Lutfalla Bey, who some years ago paid the first officiaf Turkish visit to the Yemen since the war. Lutfalla Bey relates that, when he was waiting at Massawa for a steamer to take him to Hudaida, an Italian official from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Rome who happened to be there attached himself to him, and eventually, without giving any reason for his journey, went to Hudaida with him in the same ship and to Sana in the same car, and refused to be shaken off throughout the visit. 134. The pilgrims from Spanish Morocco were the subject of two references in the Umm-al-Qura. One reports that they were headed by a delegation which included the Minister of Justice of the zone and brought with it a letter to Ibn Saud from the Khalifa, presents for the King, decorations for the King,the Amir Feisal and various high officials, and 20,000 fr. for the poor (the figures given last month as the sums given in charity and the value of the presents were perhaps exaggerated). The second reference reports a visit by the head of the delegation and some of his companions to the office of the newspaper, and a propaganda speech by the leader, in which he praised General Franco for the facilities granted to the pilgrims, and Ibn Saud and the Saudi officials for their kindness and hospitality. Little more was heard of these pilgrims, who were treated in the same way as the Libyans by the Italian Legation and were shipped off on the Maghrab-al-Aqsa, which had retreated to Massawa and waited there until the last moment. 135. The “ Mission of Honour ” from Egypt departed amid a shower of telegrams and other messages exchanged with the King and high Saudi officials. According to one shocked observer, the chief result of the renewal of the despatch of the Kiswa to Mecca was the appearance of some of the ladies of the mission unveiled at Arafat, and even in the Holy Mosque at Mecca. This made the judicious grieve (among them our informant), and turned the hearts of the less judicious to smoking kebabs. 136. In accordance with the Saudi-Egyptian agreement about waqf expenditure, it has been decided to distribute a sum of £E. 13,500 to the poor of Mecca and Medina, and to spend the balance of £E. 15,000 on useful projects to be decided upon by the two Governments. 137. The Afghan Minister left on the 18th March, having been at his post about six weeks. 138. The Persian Minister and his clerk left on the 8 th March, having been at their post about three weeks. 139. The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires went on leave on the 24th March after nearly dying of blackwater fever. IV.— Miscellaneous. 140. Messrs. Sharqieh (Limited), and the Ford Company, who, through them, supply the cars for the public transport company, are well satisfied with their season. Their satisfaction applies rather to the recovery of the price of their cars than to improvements in transport from the point of view of the public, though they consider that improvements have been effected. They hope to sell 300 to 350 vehicles next year, as against 168 this year and 250 in the best year hitherto. 141. Captain Hunt (paragraph 44a), after being in the service of Sharqieh (Limited) for about two months, left almost immediately after Mr. Philby’s return to Jedda, claiming to have been misled about his position by Sharqieh’s agents in London. Mr. Philby engaged in his place a young Frenchman (half English) named Lefevre-Arnold, who happened to be in Jedda on behalf of M. Besse, of Aden, but Mr. Arnold seems to have withdrawn almost immediately. With the exception of an Indian manager who has struck to him for years, Mr. Philby’s assistants do not stay with him long. 142. Health conditions in the Hejaz continued to be very good, and the pilgrimage was declared to be “ clean ” by the Egyptian Quarantine Board. By the end of the month the great majority of overseas pilgrims had left the country. 143. The chief complaint this year has been on the score of delay in the supply of transport, especially for the journey from Mecca to Medina after the Hajj. Since the transport was not sufficient to take all the pilgrims at once, and since the bad state of the roads causes the journeys to take several times as long as they would otherwise do, it is inevitable that some pilgrims should have to wait considerable periods for their return. But there is strong belief that the Indians were sacrificed this year to the Egyptians and the Moroccans, who were given preferential treatment, though whether because they paid more, or for political reasons, is not known. When asked by His Majesty’s Minister on what system the motor transport was allotted, Fuad Bey admitted that it was a mystery which he had never been able to fathom. ^ 144. The difficulties described in paragraph 116 of March 1936 have by no means diminished. As the result of intrigues (though rudeness by the Indian vice-consul to a pilgrim guide was later advanced as the pretext) the Jedda wakils of the guides for Indian pilgrims suddenly ceased to come to the Legation with the pilgrims’ passports to collect the embarkation tickets. It was supposed7 that the Legation would then be flooded by hundreds of pilgrims with whom would be unable to deal individually, but a system was organised by which the passports were collected by leaders of parties, and not only did the wakils lose the tips they sometimes get for pretending to help on these occasions, but they saw the work going at least as quickly as before. The authorities thereupon issued orders to the shipping agents in Jedda not to issue tickets except to the wakils, alleging later as a reason for this order that if the pilgrims received the tickets direct the wakils would not have time to carry out the formalities of registration and so on. At the instance of the Legation the order has been rescinded for the short remainder of the season, but the incident has caused much unpleasantness and left a difficult problem behind it. 145. The procedure applied to pilgrim ships for the Far East, whereby the first pilgrims to reach the Hejaz have the right to leave first, was upset by the leading pilgrim guide, who sent down to Jedda to be booked by one of the first ships some 160 Philippines who had arrived by one of the last ships. The reason was that they were his own pilgrims. After a long struggle the authorities agreed to detain these pilgrims and to replace them by earlier arrivals. It is said that even the King was annoyed at the preferential treatment which the guide tried to get for his own pilgrims, but it has not been heard that any punishment has been inflicted. 146. The Saudi statistics show fifty-five Turkish subjects as having made the pilgrimage this year. Had they come in the regular way, they must all have reported to the Turkish Legation in Jedda for a return visa, but not one of them has appeared there. The Turkish Chargd d’Affaires states that it would be difficult for a Turkish subject to take out openly enough foreign currency for the pilgrimage, if he declared his object to the authorities, and assumes that the Turks who managed to come on the pilgrimage either pretended to be going to Syria or Iraq, or else crossed the frontier surreptitiously. He has information that some of them deposited their Turkish passports with the Syrian authorities and on payment of half a Turkish lira in gold received Syrian passes for Saudi Arabia, which they will return in exchange for their passports when they get back to Syria. 147. Reports from Transjordan that intending pilgrims from Syria have been crossing the desert from Syria to Saudi Arabia to evade the passport and quarantine regulations is supported by the appearance at the French Legation in Jedda of scores of persons who claim to be Syrians but have no papers. It is most improbable that they were subjected to any proper sanitary control on arrival in Saudi Arabia. It is unlikely that the highest authorities in this country have much faith in preventive medicine, and, in any case, they would never impose such sanitary measures as would discourage pilgrims. It is partly on grounds of vanity, but partly because of fear lest the flow of pilgrims should be discouraged thereby, that they object to the quarantine stations in Egypt and at Kamaran. The Umm-al-Qura gives a prominent place to an article from the Muqattam, which says that many people advocate the abolition of the Egyptian Quarantine Board as useless. It is true that the reason given is that it is the Egyptian Ministry of Health (formerly the Health Department) and not the Quarantine Board which has protected Egypt against infection by returning pilgrims, but the article also pays a quite undeserved tribute to the public health work in the Hej az. The opinion of the Quarantine Board on this work was referred to in paragraph 397 of November last. The second comment, which dropped out in the print, may be reproduced here : “II est regrettable de constater que les bulletins sanitaires du Hejaz son irr^guliers, imprecis, discontinus et parfois absents.” Nevertheless, the Saudi authorities seem to hope that their demand for the abolition of all quarantine control of the pilgrimage in Egypt and Kamaran will be approved. 148. The lack of decent accommodation for pilgrims in Mecca has led some prosperous Indian pilgrims this year to state that when they return to India they will raise funds to buy or build premises to house Indian pilgrims while they are waiting in Jedda. 149. In paragraph 352 of October 1936 reference was made to the arrival from Singapore of two pilgrim ships carrying more “ souls ” than the Paris Convention allows. It has been found that this was due to an oversight: the Singapore authorities made a concession about the number of passengers that might be carried by passenger ships in general, not realising that the automaticapplication of the concession to pilgrim vessels entailed a breach in the Paris Convention. This was at once remedied by the steamship companies in practice, and it has now been remedied in law. 150. Two Indian “ Yunani doctors are believed to have impressed the King favourably by their treatment of some of his wives, and to have been invited by him to establish themselves in this country. One is the chief Yunani medical officer of Bahawalpur State, the other a prosperous hakim of Delhi. The first says that he will return in order to be revenged on an Indian intriguer with whom he has fallen out, the other says he intends to accept the King’s offer in order to raise the status of the medical profession which he considers has been degraded in the Hejaz by the mercenary doctors from Syria. 151. Mr. Rom Landau, a Polish subject living in England, who is the author of God is my Adventure and has been commissioned by his publishers to write “ a comprehensive survey of the spiritual undercurrents influencing the cultural, political and religious life in Europe and the Near East,” came to Jedda at the invitation of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, whom he had come to know in connexion with the International Congress of Faiths. He arrived on the 2 nd March and stayed six days. He was depressed to find that his sponsor had gone to Uqair, but he was able to see Ibn Saud, who came down to Shumaisi to meet him. Mr. Landau seemed very ingenuous. He expressed surprise that his request to be allowed to pursue his enquiry in Soviet Russia did not secure him a visa immediately, and that the rector of A1 Azhar did not give a direct answer to any single one of his doubtless searching list of questions. Mr. Landau has gone to Egypt, Palestine and Turkey. A recent number of the Muqattam contains a paragraph which clearly refers to Mr. Landau. It reads :— There is in Egypt to-day a European scholar who recently paid a visit to Arabia and who met and spoke with King Abdul Aziz and acquainted himself with his achievements. This man has returned full of admiration for what he saw and heard, and he is convinced that this Arab King is of the flower of the products of Arabia, and that if God grants him long life he and his people will have a great influence on the affairs of the Near East and its destiny.” 152. Ibn Saud has been at some pains to prevent the exhibition of films of Mecca in London and elsewhere, and it is therefore surprising to see, from an advertisement in the Sudan Daily Herald, that a film of the pilgrimage is being shown in Omdurman. The advertisement reads: tc Pilgrimage to Mecca. The first Arabic talking religious film in the world, revealing the magnificent sacred buildings, traditional garbs, ceremonies, habits, and observances of the pilgrims. Spectacular scenes never caught by the camera before.” If only it revealed all the doings of the mutawwifs it could rank as a gangster film, for in spite of the greater control by the Government, this fraternity manages to compress a lot of villainy into a short season.any further communication on this subject, please quote No - A /SO Q /S'0 /x&lt;~ and address —not to any person by name, but to— ' ** 1 The Under- ” ^ ^ ’ ^ ' ,7 C' / '* r &gt; Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.Wj i. v )- THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to ^ transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper and, by direction of the (Secretary of State, Foi'eign Office, , my. si /t&gt;. iZe^Cc^ Reference to previous correspondence : ■*-» £ S'f-a /f~yc&gt; Ay- y V f /*.. s?2 yTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

The Amir Saud returned to Riyadh early in February, after his visit to Mecca to see his mother, who was ill. According to the press he will stay in Riyadh until mid- March, when he will proceed on the promised visit to Iraq. Fuad Bey informed His Majesty s Minister that the Amir’s departure for Bagdad had been postponed in order that he might be in Riyadh to receive Mr. Rendel (paragraph 92 below). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, Saudi Minister in London, who arrived at Mecca via Iraq recently, is to meet Mr. Rendel at Uqair. He came to Jedda for a few hours on the 24th February to talk to His Majesty’s Minister about several matters. 69. The piastre scheme (paragraph 8) occupies about five-sixths of a twelve-page special number of the Saut-al-Hejaz, published just before pilgrimage day in a determined effort to get money out of the pilgrims. It even contains an appeal in English, beginning : “ Here is a golden occasion to show the unanimity of Mohammedan corps and their co-operation elevating the value of the Mohammedan wholy lands and their natives successfully to 'economical projects.” There is also an advertisement appealing to pilgrims to buy Medina dates, packed in half and quarter-kilog. boxes, under the piastre scheme, to take home as “ A Present from Medina.” The profits of the scheme are to be used for the establishment of a date-packing factory. The advertisement at least is up to date, in that it urges the reader to “ avoid imitations ” and to “ seize the chance before it is gone.” 70. It is a sign of financial stress that the Saudi Government owe the Eastern Telegraph Company (Limited) over £2,000 on the telegraph account. They paid £1,000 in January, but left the balance outstanding. Some of the telegrams covered by this account were despatched as long ago as October. In j spite of the receipts from the pilgrim traffic, officials are still five months in arrear j with their pay. One official, who is in a position to know the facts, asserts that. \ nevertheless, the King’s bill for walnuts and pistachio nuts alone for his last ^hunting trip was 8.000 riyals (about £650). 71. Another sign of shortage of money is the determined effort made to induce pilgrims to subscribe for various charitable and other schemes. One Eritrean pilgrim (Italian propaganda, this) is reported in the Umm-al-Qura as subscribing 2 pounds gold to the Aviation Society, 2 to the Asylum for Orphans and Aged Persons, 2 to the Charitable Society and 1 to the piastre scheme Mutawwifs are now being given books of 1-riyaftickets for the Aviation Society, the number of tickets being calculated according to the number and reputed wealth of their pilgrims. They have to pay for the tickets, and to pass them on to the pilgrims if they can. But no complaint of these activities has been received from any British pilgrim. Pilgrims reckon to spend what they can in charity [956 y 3] * Bwhen they come to the Hejaz, and if the money was not taken from them in one way it would be taken in another. Direct collection of money for Ibn Sand’s pistachio nuts would arouse criticism, hut these discreeter methods of increasing the revenues of the country are not likely to arouse objection. • / 2 . The Moslem Bank of India (Limited), whose head office is at Lahore, have applied to Ibn Baud for permission to open a branch at Jedda or Mecca for the convenience of Indian pilgrims, and have mentioned by way of testimonial that the proposal has been welcomed by Ismail Ghaznavi. Ihn Saud would probably look with some suspicion at a financial establishment recommended by this shifty if useful intriguer, and in any case he will not be impressed by the resources of a bank whose chairman and secretary ask him for a free trip to Mecca for the purpose of dismissing the foundation of a branch in his realm. 73. Rumours are afloat that the Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, and Tar at Pasha Harb have concocted a scheme whereby the Banque Misr would become the Saudi State bank, issuing notes, holding all sums collected as revenue, paying the officials, and so on. The rumours are not confirmed from any authentic source, nor does it seem likely that any bank of experience would care to keep for the Saudi Government an account which would probably be permanently overdrawn. 74. The prospecting party sent northwards by the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) has not yet seen anything that would suggest the presence of oil. It is now moving still farther north, towards Akaba. The southern party is on its way back, and the Jedda manager of the company fears that this early return foreshadows a pessimistic report from that section also. 75. The press reports the construction of short-wave wireless telegraph stations at A1 Hafr, near Koweit, and at Liniya [ ?] on the Iraqi pilgrim road. II. —Frentier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 76. On the 1 st February His Majesty’s Legation received a written protest from the Saudi Government against an alleged encroachment on Saudi territory by a Transjordan patrol. The incident, if it ever happened, seemed so trivial, and the adoption of the written protest as a method of dealing with it seemed in such striking contrast with the assurance given by Sheikh Fuad to His Majesty’s Minister a few weeks before, that the Saudi Government had by no means abandoned the method of direct co-operation provided for in the Bon-Voisinage Agreement of 1933, that His Majesty’s Minister felt entitled to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, before he sent on the protest for enquiry, he would be glad to be informed whether the Saudi frontier officials had tried to settle the matter with the officials on the Transjordan side of the frontier. No reply has been received, and there is some ground for hope that the complaint will not be heard of again. 77. Three sons of the King of the Yemen, Abdullah, Husain and Qasim, came on the pilgrimage. As they arrived without notice it was thought at first that they might have come without their father’s permission, but it seems that he wished the journey to be considered as a religious and not an official one. They were, however, received in Mecca by Ibn Saud with Royal honours. Saiyid Abdullah-al-Wazir, Governor of the Tihama, with his brother Muhammad and several other prominent Yemenis, also came on the pilgrimage. 77a. Mr. Philby was interested to hear that the King of the Yemen had complained that he had visited Jauf and Marib. He said that he had not, in fact, visited Marib, but had taken photographs and bearings from a height overlooking it, but he did not reply to a question whether the height itself was in Yemen territory. A report which must be based on statements by Colonel Depui, honorary Belgian consul at Sana and Jedda, represents the King of the Yemen as prepared to throw himself into the arms of His Majesty’s Government, to escape the proffered Italian embrace, if only the Palestine question could be settled in a manner satisfactory to the Arabs. 78. We learn from the Aden Weekly Summary that Saiyid Abdullah-al- Wazir reports the settlement of all difficulties which had arisen out of the Yemen-Saudi frontier delimitation. 79. The Saut-al-Hejaz reports the arrival “for the pilgrimage and to present compliments to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz ” of “ the Syrian leaders,” Saiyid Amin-al-Husaini, the Mufti for Palestine and President of the Moslem Higher Committee, and four others, who were “ received with honour and4' -r * 3 welcome, and were entertained as guests of the Government by His Majesty the r .Aaxn’fHng to a message sent to His Majesty’s Minister by the King, the I'-jufti appealed to His Majesty for help, hut was told that, while the King would help in legitimate ways, the Mufti would do well to assist in the main- tennnce of order and to await the report of the Royal Commission. At the gatherings at Mecca after the pilgrimage the Mufti made no reference to the Jralestme question in public, not even at the annual meeting of the Young Men’s Society which was held at Muna. Ill -—Relations with Powers outside A rahia. ■ , notes about the 1 reaty of Jedda and connected subjects which were 0n Stoker will have been published in London on the h February. I he Saudi Government have been informed, but they may elect to take no action, partly because (paragraph M'2 of October 1936) they published a ne time a summary so full that the complete text would add nothing to the knowledge ot the public, and partly because the summary attracted little or no attention. +k r\^ H ; S M . a j est y s Minister and Fuad Bey turned from the deadlock over | tne Ontar frontier (paragraph 28) to see whether any progress could be made with the southern boundary, where the proposed Saudi line lies considerably to the south of that suggested by His Majesty’s Government. Fuad Bey had no infoimation about the four wells Iving in the belt of territory in dispute viz. Sanau and Thamut, in the Hadhramaut hinterland, and Tadhau and Shishur (or Shisur), in the hinterland of Oman, but admitted that they were not on the list of Murra wells which he drew up in 1935, and that they had never been claimed by name. It was found that neither the Legation nor Fuad Bev could even say how the names were written in Arabic. It is probably safe to say that theie is no better information about these wells to be had than is contained in Bertram Thomas’s Arabia Felix, which shows that Sanau, Thamut and Shisur all he to the south of the desert and in the steppe country which rises gradually t 0 u- u coasta l ran ge, and that they are frequented mainly by tribes which Ibn baud does not claim as his. Tadhau is not mentioned by Thomas, but it appears on his map as lying south-west of Shisur and even farther from the edge of the sands. 82. Mr. Philby (paragraph 414, December 1936) returned from his nine months journey just in time for the pilgrimage. In a conversation which he had wdh His Majesty s Minister he confirmed the statement of the Saudi Government that they had no responsibility for his expedition, which he planned and financed himself. As was expected, he returns in his most aggressive and self-righteous mood. His attitude is this. He has been attacked for making a harmless scientific expedition, and he therefore intends to fight back. His visit to Shabwa is on all fours with Bertram Thomas’s crossing of the Ruba-al-Khali (smack at Philby Enemy No. 1 ). The Aden Government are trying to expand at the expense of the Arabs, and are thus violating the promises'made by His Majesty’s Government (Philby Enemy No. 2 ) in the McMahon correspondence, and in view of the attitude they have adopted towards his journey they have become Philbv Enemy No. 3. and will be suitably trounced in his forthcoming book. 83. The visit of Mr Leland B. Morris (paragraph 39 ), the United States consul-general at iVlexandria, had to be cut so short that he saw nothing of the country outside Jedda. He collected from His Majesty’s Legation detailed replies to a long list of questions. He did not appear to favour 'the proposal of Mr Twitchell that the United States should have a representative in Jedda 84. The appointment of Signor Luigi Silitti, Italian consul-general in Sydney, as Italian Minister in Jedda has now been announced. He succeeds M. Persico, who has been transferred to Havana. &lt;&lt; x* 8 ?-' H ?Y, many of the 1 ' 900 Ethio P ian s whose pilgrimage was to be • facilitated by the Italian authorities actually came on the pilgrimage is not ! yet known. The official statistics of the Saudi Passport Office show 619 pilgrims 1 from Ethiopia and none from Eritrea. On the other hand, the Umm al-Qura I publishes a piece of Italian propaganda in which it is stated that there were about 1,000 Eritrean pilgrims on one boat. This statement is attributed to the Eritrean who subscribed so freely for charitable purposes (paragraph 71 above) He is also represented as grateful for the progress and prosperity of the Heiaz [956 y 3] ' B 94 and the provision for the comfort of pilgrims, and then as praising “ the Govern ment of his country ' for help given to pilgrims from Eritrea and the facilities afforded them, which included, he says, material help to the extent of 10,000 fr. a head. The Umm-al-Qura cruelly says: “His Excellency expatiated on this theme.' The paragraph appears to be a Saudi compromise. The reader feels that it was not possible to refuse to print the propaganda, and, indeed, Ibn Saud and the Hejaz could not but be grateful for the arrival of pilgrims from a fresh source; but to diminish the force of the propaganda reference is made only to Eritrea, not to Ethiopia, and the Italian authorities have to be content with being described as the Government of Eritrea. 86 . Dr. Fea, the ex-naval surgeon, who until last summer was doctor to the Italian Legation (paragraph 424 of December) is again in Jedda. According to statements which he made to another foreigner here, he has a mission from the Lloyd Triestino to inspect and report on the sanitary condition of their vessels plying to Arabian ports and to Bombay. It is hoped that this is not a prelude to an attempt to compete for the carriage of Indian pilgrims. Dr. Fea also said that he was to establish a dispensary and a well-equipped hospital, but this conflicts with a statement made by the Italian Charge d’Affaires that Dr. Fea was to be replaced by another doctor. Moreover, the Saudi policy towards foreign medical services would have to be modified fundamentally to allow the Italian Legation to embark on such schemes. 87. General Franco also used the pilgrimage for propaganda purposes. He gave free or greatly reduced passages to Jedda to a number of pilgrims, estimated at about 250, from the Spanish Zone of Morocco. They travelled on the Maghrab-al-A qsa, a vessel flying the flag of the Burgos Government. She called at some port or ports in Libya and took on about 200 more pilgrims. It is stated that Fuad Bey gave a lunch for the leaders of the Spanish Moroccans; he certainly received them at the Foreign Affairs office in Jedda. It is credibly reported that they brought with them 150,000 fr. (in pesetas) for charitable purposes, besides presents for Ibn Saud (a Chrysler car, Moorish daggers, carpets and stuffs, and some diamond rings) to the value of about 450,000 fr. Reports from Mecca state that the pilgrims were loud in their praise of General Franco, but a reliable Jedda notable, who saw some of them, depicts them as saying what is probably nearer to their real opinion, viz., that the Spaniards are less civilised than the French and the Italians, but are to be preferred as being less avaricious and more easy-going. The Umm-al-Qura makes the guarded statement that a number of Moroccans saw King Abdul Aziz, and one of them made a speech to which His Majesty replied. 88 . The pilgrimage from Spanish Morocco was used for a demonstration of Italian solidarity with the insurgents. Legally, the inhabitants of the Spanish Zone of Morocco are under French protection outside the limits of the zone,( l ) since the French Government are in charge of the foreign affairs of the whole of Morocco, and such Spanish Moroccans as have made the pilgrimage hitherto have gone to the French Legation in Jedda for a return visa. On this occasion, how ever, the Italian Government claimed to represent General Franco, and informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the vessel, which would take on pilgrims from Libya, would be under Italian protection, and that the interests of the pilgrims would be in the hands of the Italian Legation. After landing her pilgrims the vessel retreated to Massawa, on the pretext that Jedda harbour was unsafe The pilgrims are not likely to need any protection, and the matter is mainly of interest in that General Franco, in placing the pilgrims under the protection of Italy, is evading French rights. But he could hardly be expected to leave the pilgrims free to apply to the French for visas, and his action may be dictated by practical considerations and not intended as a breach of the Franco- Spanish Treaty relating to the Spanish Zone of Morocco 89. There is a great contrast between the ceremonies which attended the departure of the Mahmal from Egypt and its reception in Jedda. A considerable crowd collected on the quay when the Mahmal was landed at Jedda, but the authorities were only represented by the A.D.C. to the Amir Feisal and by a few police to keep the crowd back. The Umm-al-Qura says that the “ Mission of * * Departmental Note .—This description of the position of natives of the Spanish Zone when abroad is not quite accurate. See article 22 of the Franco-Spanish Convention of the 27th November, 1912, under which natives of the Spanish Zone of Morocco when abroad are placed under the protection of Spanish diplomatic and consular officers.5 /* Honour ” from Egypt was received at Jedda with fitting ceremony and respect, but does not mention the word “ Mahmal.” The same paper records the formal taking over of the Kiswa in Mecca by the Director of Waqfs, the Keeper of the Kaba Keys and the president of the Haram Committee. It states that “ speeches suitable to the place ” were exchanged, but a member of the Legation +* * *** staff reports that there was no crowd present and that the Kiswa was taken over with little ceremony and at once hurried into the Haram. Later, however, the mission was received by the King, and its President delivered a speech which was published in the Umm-al-Qura. It will be interesting to see whether the Egyptian Parliament will consider that they have had a fair return for the sum of over £E. 30,000, which they voted for the mission this year. 90. The Iranian Legation was reopened only three weeks before the Hajj, when the secretary arrived from Egypt for the purpose. His chief only arrived a few' days before the Hajj. The secretary, who may be supposed to have been voicing official opinion, spoke of the journey of Iranian pilgrims to Mecca as a dead financial loss to their country. Only twenty-one Iranian pilgrims are shown in the Saudi statistics as having entered the country via Jedda, but the full number of Iranians will not be known until the figures for the Najaf-Medina route are published. 91. The Turkish Charge d’Affaires finds that he has to live down various scandals created by his military predecessor, Celal Arat, who imported duty-free “ enough petrol to run his own car for fifty years ” and supplied large numbers of residents in Jedda, most of them Moslems, with duty-free whisky. Celal Arat also confounded his Italian colleague by alternately displaying with emotion the photograph of his wife in Turkey, who is “ the most this and the most that,” and so conducting himself towards a lady of the Italian community that her husband beat her over the head with an electric torch appropriately named “ Ever-ready.” Celal Bey is now a Deputy in the Turkish Parliament. IV.— Miscellaneous. 92. Mr. Rendel, of the Foreign Office, and Mrs. Rendel, who are to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia in response to an invitation conveyed by the Amir Saud when he was in England in 1935, are expected to reach Uqair from Iraq about the 6 th March. Accompanied by the Saudi Minister in London they will cross Arabia to Jedda, staying a day or two at Riyadh, and perhaps at Hofuf and Taif, on the way. 93. It is with great regret that we record the departure, on transfer, of Mr. A. S. Calvert, who has been the mainstay of two successive Ministers for four years, and has been in charge of His' Majesty’s Legation for periods amounting in all to over eighteen months. 94. Mr. Philby (see also paragraph 82) returned from his expedition to the south on the 17th February. Regarded merely as a physical feat, the journey must be considered remarkable. Fatigue and illness would have carried off many a man less obstinate than Mr. Philby. He has acquired a great deal of information, which, if only the writing could be done by someone else, would make an extremely interesting book. In his articles in the Times, Mr. Philby mentions a German explorer, Hans Hellfritz, as having visited Shabwa before' him. This visit is recorded in an excellent French translation : “ Au Royaume de Saba,” published, with very good illustrations by Grasset (Paris), at 18 fr. 95. H.M.S. Londonderry paid a visit to Jedda which lasted from the 19th to the 25th February. Thirteen of the Somali members of the crew were able to make the pilgrimage. 96. A 32-foot yacht, the Idle Hour, in which a young American named Dwight Long is sailing round the world, spent a few days in Jedda Harbour in February. Mr. Long is not attempting to vie with his illustrious predecessor. Captain Slocum, by travelling alone. He had carried from Ceylon as crew two Englishmen, Mr. Milton, a tea-planter, and Mr. Collins, a student. 97. The pilgrimage on the 20 th February is reported to have been a complete success. The number of pilgrims who arrived by sea was just under 50,000 (49,597), i.e., some 17,000 more than last year, and to this must be added some who travelled via Iraq. It had been stated that the King had invited the Nejdis to come on the pilgrimage and that 40,000 were coming, but the number who came was 8,000 to 10,000 at most. The Indians kept the lead with over6 10,000, but the Egyptians were only a few hundred less numerous. The number of Yemeni pilgrims was noticeably small, perhaps because, of the restrictions placed by the Saudi authorities on pilgrims travelling from the Yemen by land. iHealth conditions were excellent. There were no signs of any epidemic disease, Sand no cases of infectious disease calling for exceptional measures. The Saudi authorities declared the pilgrimage to have been clean, and as this was confirmed / from less interested technical sources, His Majesty’s Legation was able to exempt I southward-bound pilgrim ships from the obligation to call at Kamaran. It is well that no strain was thrown on the Saudi Health Service, for this organisation, in so far as it can be said to be organised, is clearly based on the belief or the hope that no epidemic is likely to occur. Some hopes had been placed on the new first-aid society, and, indeed, their agents, mounted on ambulances and motor bicycles, were seen about among the pilgrims; but it is stated on good authority that these good Samaritans explained to any sick who appealed to them that the rule was no pay no treatment, and refused help to the destitute. 98. Not only were those persons disappointed who hoped that a Moslem congress would be held in Mecca after the pilgrimage, but this year the King did not even give the customary banquet to the leading pilgrims of all countries together, but divided the guests up into four parties, his object being, he said, to get into closer touch with his visitors. The four banquets are stated in the press to have been for : ( 1 ) Indians; ( 2 ) Egyptians; ( 3 ) pilgrims from the Arab countries; and (4) pilgrims of various nationalities, among them pilgrims from “ China, the Sudan, and North, South and West Africa.” No 'mention is made of the Javanese or Malayan guests, but it appears that, from diffidence or some other cause, the Javanese and Malayans rarely accept invitations to the Royal banquets. At the Indian dinner the King made a religious speech which included a defence of himself as a Hanbali and, therefore, an orthodox Moslem, and a declaration that he was not opposed to the rules of the other three sects! Hanafi, Shafai and Maliki. The speeches at the other dinners also seem to have been entirely non-political. At the great durbar which was held on the second day of the festival, the King had with him the three sons of the King of the Yemen, the Mufti of Palestine and the leading Egyptians. The chief feature of the occasion was that, for the first time during this reign, a band played for the review of the army. In the course of an interview which he gave to His Highness the Khan of Kelat, the King again defended his orthodoxy, claiming to be a good Sunni and follower of the Imam Hanbal, but full of repect for the other three Imams, some of whose teachings he claimed to have adopted. 99. Among prominent British pilgrims this year have been His Highness the Khan of Kelat, His Highness the Amir of Kaiio, a brother of His Highness the Sultan of Perak, the mother of His Highness the Sultan of Pahang and the widow of a former Sultan and two daughters of His Highness the Sultan of Kedah. ^ he first regular, if seasonal, air service in Saudi Arabia was established on the 8 th February, when the Misr Airwork aeroplane Heluan took on foi Medina with five pilgrims and the mail. I he service is one machine dailv wa y* dining the peak of the pilgrim season, [he return fare was fixed by the Saudi Government at £20 gold, half of which was to go to the State as koshan. I he Airwork Agency suggested that the charge was too heavy for most people, and that the koshan should be reduced to £5 gold, but the most the Government would do was to reduce their charge to £9 gold on condition that Misi Airwork did the same. At £18 gold for the return trip, the aeroplane never had a full complement of passengers. Among the patrons of the air route to Medina was His Highness the Khan of Kelat. 101 . The belief expressed in paragraph 455 of December last that the Office international in Paris had not agreed that the pilgrim quarantine stations outside the Hejaz were no longer necessary is confirmed by the receipt of a report showing what was actually said on that occasion. It seems that the Office is fully aware ot the health conditions in the Hejaz, and of the fact that a worthless hospital can be made to look very much like a good one in a photograph. 102. 1 he project mentioned in paragraph 51 under which large Italian steamers were expected to call at Jedda seems to have been abandoned, but the existing service is being improved. In future there will be four Italian steamers a month each way instead of two, i.e., the same number as that of the Khedivial steamers. %- 7 103- The annual pilgrimage regatta passed off this year without friction, i he captain of the only French ship in port got as far as subscribing to the funds, though he said that his ship’s boats were not such as to allow him to compete honourably. Had his men competed, they would probably have been beaten in most of the pulling races by the Egyptians, as our British Indians were. 104. I he last manumission case (paragraph 66 ) may occupy the attention of the Legation for years yet. It was found that the owner, who had returned from the Sudan, had no authority to answer for the others. He has produced a deed of manumission which has extinguished his property rights in the four slaves, but they still belong in part to the other owners. The over-worked word Gilbertian could be used appropriately for people who might be described as three parts groaning in chains and one part free as air.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). i — ! 668 February 22, 1937.

W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Jedda Report for January 1937. I .—Internal Affairs. THE Amir Feisal came to Jedda on the 4th January for the accession celebrations and left again for Mecca on the 9 th January. Fuad Bey gave a dumer in his honour, and invited various Saudi officials and notables and also the only foreign Ministers then in Jedda, Soviet, French and British. The wire less was turned on after dinner, and produced from Jerusalem, very appropriately, the news that the Arab Higher Committee had decided to co-operate with the Royal Commission. The usual dinner was given to all the world on Accession Day, the 8 th January. The most remarkable guest was the eldest child of the Amir Feisal, a handsome boy of about ten named Saud. 2. The Amir Saud hurried from Riyadh to Mecca, where he arrived on the 14th January, to see his mother, who was ill. The Royal progress was well advertised in the press. 3. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, Minister of Finance, returned from his mission in Egypt (paragraph 427 of 1936) on the 3rd January. 4. A report has been received which, given the source it came from, ought to have some truth in it, to the effect that there is serious trouble in Asir, and men and arms are being collected secretly in great haste to be despatched to the scene of the disturbance. No confirmation of this report has, however, been obtained. 5. There was a quarrel between the police at Mecca and some of the Royal slaves at the beginning of January. It arose out of the refusal of a slave, who was driving one of the King’s cars, to stop when the police, who allege that he was exceeding the speed limit, signalled to him to stop. It seems that the police officer in charge ordered his men to fire if the slave refused again, that the slave did refuse and was fired at, and that in the ensuing battle two bystanders were killed. The leading persons on both sides, including the officer who* gave the order to fire, are believed to have been imprisoned. The Royal slaves are verv independent, not to say insolent, and they would probably regard themselves as above any such foolish regulation as a speed limit. 6 . The announcement in the Mecca press last June that the former Deputy Amir of Medina, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Ibrahim, had been appointed a member of the Standing Committee of the Council of Ministers, drew attention to a body whose existence had hardly been heard of. His Majesty’s Minister learns from Fuad Bey that the council has only two other ‘ members, himself and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, that it has no well-defined duties, and that it hardlv ever meets. ,v on i 7 r Tw ° hu ih dred cases of new silver coin for Saudi Arabia arrived on the 20 th January. These coins are believed to have been minted in Birminoffiam and to amount to 1 million riyals. There are some signs of a shortage of rivals ea the Government have been paying their debt to the Saudi Arabian Minin? 9070 [931 y—3] 5Syndicate (paragraph 407 of 1936) partly in gold. Yet by some unfathomable means the riyal is pretty steady, in spite of the presence of large numbers of pilgrims. The shortage of small change, however, is so acute that it sometimes costs 2 piastres out of 22 to change a riyal. Apart from the seasonal demand resulting from the pilgrimage, there will presently be a regular demand from the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, who expect to need 30,000 riyals a month for wages soon, and from Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) Ltd., who, if they find oil, will need nearly as much. 8 . Collections for the piastre scheme, which was mentioned in paragraph 243 of 1936, continue. A 1 -piastre stamp has been produced for the purpose, though care has been taken to make it clear that it is only the minimum sub scription which is 1 piastre, not the maximum. The stamp indicates by a rather crowded picture some of the objects of the fund : smoking factory chimneys and an anvil represent industry, palm trees agriculture, and a three-funnelled steamer that Saudi merchant navy which is to be created. The details of the scheme are vague, but the collection of money is quite definite. Pilgrims are badgered to subscribe to the fund, and when they leave Medina for Jedda or Mecca the authorities, who collect from them 1 piastre as municipal tax, also collect, as though it too were a tax, a piastre for the piastre scheme. 9. Ibn Saud’s Indian chauffeur claims to have been granted a concession for a motor transport service from Uqair to Mecca, and to have secured adequate financial support from leading Saudi officials and others. He says that he has concluded an arrangement with a Swedish company for the supply of motor vehicles (nothing whatever remains to be settled except the terms of payment), and that Messrs. Thomas Cook have agreed to take the agency for India for the company to be formed, though they appear to doubt (with some reason) whether the Government of India would approve the booking of pilgrims from India by that route. Ibn Saud’s aim is assumed to be a desire to establish a land route lying wholly in Saudi territory. 10 . Nine of the “eagles” have been receiving further instruction in flying this month. The Italian pilot has been using two of the Italian instructional machines for this purpose (the third is at Taif, a complete wreck), and the Russian pilot the French monoplane (paragraph 84 of 1936). One of the ten has left the country and abandoned flying for good. Some reports say that he would never have made a pilot, others that he was seen eating during the daytime in Ramadan, but the possibility that he was both incompetent and impious is not excluded. It is believed that a fresh batch of about fifteen young Saudis will begin training as aviators soon, and that spares have been ordered to enable the Wapitis to be repaired for use as training machines. In fact, the indications are that no more Saudis are to be sent to Italy for training. But the training of students here is not without its difficulties. Perhaps the chief is the inability of the authorities concerned to realise that you cannot learn to fly without using petrol, oil and other stores, and they cannot face the expense of regular practice. The latest issue of the Umm-al-Qura contains two statements which accord ill together. One describes the Saudi pilots as returning from abroad with certificates as military pilots, and the other considers it a subject for boasting that four of these pilots have made flights of a quarter of an hour over Mecca. The handsome Italian hangar is approaching completion, but the Caproni aeroplane still does nothing; two of the three carburettors are broken, and spares are awaited. The other two Capronis, according to the Italian Legation, will not be sent until the hangar is readv to protect them from the exposure to which all other Saudi aeroplanes have hitherto been subjected. 11 . The Arab Aviation Society which had been collecting subscriptions for some time published an appeal to pilgrims to subscribe to this fund for encouraging the art of aviation and teaching it to the sons of the holy places, the homeland of Islam, the object of the hopes of all Moslems. The appeal describes aviation as one of the greatest arts for the defence of one's fatherland, and reminds the pilgrim that his fatherland is the Holy Land of the Hejaz. A later notice says that one of the most important aims of the society had been to purchase machines for the members of the mission who had returned from Europe with military flying certificates, but finding that the Government had already provided the aeroplanes for that purpose they decided to participate in the encouragement of aviation in another way, viz., by handing over to the Govern ment the sum of £E. 1,500 already collected, to assist the Government's project to build a scientific hangar on the Jedda aerodrome. It will puzzle the Italians to3 ^ find any satisfaction in this bland statement, which ignores completely the part which they have played in encouraging this art in the Hejaz. 12. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs have furnished the Legation with a copy of the Saudi regulations regarding flights of foreign aircraft to and from Jedda—the only place of arrival and departure for aeroplanes in the country. Application for permission to fly to Jedda must be made beforehand in each case, and the Saudi Government reserve the right to reject any application. The use of aeroplanes for pilgrims has increased slowly during the last two or three years, and even more pilgrims are expected to come and go by aeroplane this year, but it is unlikely that non-Moslems will easily obtain permission to travel to or from Jedda by air. The refusal of the application of Colonels Etherton and Micklem will be remembered (paragraph 372 of 1936). The only exception recorded hitherto was the occasion when a Royal Air Force aeroplane was allowed to come to Jedda to take Sir Andrew Ryan to Egypt. But it was in the interest of Ibn Sand that Sir Andrew Ryan should travel by air since he was hurrying home to be present during the visit of the Amir Saud to England. 13. The preceding paragraph had just been written when a letter was received from Misr Airlines, wdiose headquarters are in Cairo, announcing their intention to inaugurate a regular air service between Jedda and Medina during the pilgrimage season. It is assumed that the Saudi Government have approved this scheme, but it has not been referred to in the press. 14. It is believed that Colonel Etherton is returning, and it is even alleged that he has been invited to return by the Saudi authorities. If this is true, Mr. Twitchell (paragraph 406 of 1936) has not secured the additional mining concession he hoped for. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s aeroplane has now ceased to fly, all the air-survey work (presumably on the original concession) having been completed. 15. The Jedda office of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company intend to establish wireless telegraph communication with the oil-field in Hasa and are carrying out preliminary experiments. Reception here has been rather poor, and it is believed that the transmitter is not strong enough. At present the set in Jedda is only for reception, but it is expected that a transmitting apparatus wdll be installed in a few months. 16. It was believed that Mr. Philby’s firm, Sharqieh (Limited), had the monopoly for the supply of tyres and other spares to the public transport company, but if it has, the monopoly is being infringed. Tyres are being imported for this purpose by several other firms. 17. Sharqieh (Limited) have recently imported seven more Marconi wireless telegraph installations for the Saudi Government. This is interesting for two reasons. It suggests that the company must have been paid at least a considerable proportion of the cost of the sets supplied before, and it makes even more difficult to understand the tale reported (paragraph 375 of 1936) that the Saudi Govern ment had secured two wireless telegraph apparatus of a new type, unaffected bv atmospherics, and proposed to obtain more of the same kind. 18. Official^communique No. 18, dated the 25th Shawwal, 1355 (the 8 th January, 1937), remedies, very late in the day, a defect in the Saudi regulation on narcotic drugs which was pointed out to them privately by His Majesty’s Government. The regulation, which appeared in September 1934 (see paragraph 223 of that year), did not prescribe the procedure to be followed by a person wishing to import such drugs from another country into Saudi Arabia, though it laid down the procedure for the contrary case, which must be far less common. The communique fills this gap. 19. The fire on a sambuk which destroyed cases of kerosene (paragraph 337 of 1936) scared the Jedda authorities into deciding to build a depot for kerosene and petrol outside the town and to land all such inflammable products at a little jetty near by, so that they may not even pass through the town on their way to the store. Work on the building has begun. 20 . The Umm-al-Qura has published an article refuting with indio-nation the charge, made in an Egyptian paper, .4/ Jihad, by a certain AbdufGhani Salama, that pilgrims are prohibited by the Saudi Government from kissin^ or touching or prostrating themselves before the Black Stone, and are beaten' by^the police if they disregard this prohibition. The Umm-al-Qura declares that the traditions quoted by Abdul Ghani are held by the Saudi authorities to be valid and that the accusation is refuted daily by tens of thousands of pilgrims who kiss [931 y 3] ' B 2■■■Ml 4 the Black Stone. It says that, if there are police in the precincts of the mosque, they are placed there to protect pilgrims and their property, and that, in view of the particularly dense crowd which collects round the stone, a policeman is stationed there to prevent congestion and to ensure that pilgrims may be able to kiss the stone without disputing with one another. According to the Legation’s information, the kissing of the Black Stone is one of the traditional rites which are recognised by the Wahabis and has never been interfered with, except with the object of keeping the crowd moving. For instance, many pilgrims making the “ tawwaf” or sevenfold perambulation of the Kaba would like to kiss the Black Stone every time they pass it, but in the busy season they have to be content with kissing it after the seventh circuit, and if a pilgrim causes a block in the crowd by disobeying this reasonable regulation, the police may belabour him with sticks to remind him that not every time’s kissing time. II.— F rontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 21. His Majesty’s Minister was informed by Fuad Bey Hamza on the 2nd January that the Palestine delegation which had gone to Riyadh had left, convinced by Ibn Saud’s arguments in favour of co-operation with the Royal Commission and resolved to recommend that course to the Arab Higher Committee. Their advice seems to have been sent by telegram, since the decision of the committee to co-operate was taken on the 6 th January. The Umm-al-Qura represented the delegation as leaving Riyadh with the “ instructions and recommendations ” of King Abdul Aziz. 22. His Majesty’s Government have received assurances from Ibn Baud, through the Saudi Legation in London, that he will never allow Fauzi Qauqji to enter Saudi territory. 23. Ibn Saud has been receiving telegrams from all parts of the Arab world urging him to do something about Alexandretta, and he sent a message to His Majesty’s Minister, through Fuad Bey, asking for the advice of His Majesty’s Government. He did not wish to disturb his good relations with the Turks, but what was he to do? Should he appeal to the Turks? His Majesty’s Minister, speaking personally, recommended that the Arab world should await the result of the Franco-Turkish negotiations. It was for the King to decide whether to approach the Turks or not, but such an approach might make them more difficult. They would ask what standing Saudi Arabia had in the matter. It would be exceedingly dangerous to use the expression “ Arab world in the sense of a political unit called upon to take action in every matter affecting Arabs wherever they might be, and a great mistake to suppose that action deemed appropriate during the recent troubles in Palestine was applicable in all cases and would always be as well received. Fuad Bey admitted that he held much the same opinion, but he had to have a reply for the King. The language held by His Majesty’s Minister was approved by His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Minister has gained the impression' that the attitude of the Turks in the matter of Alexandretta has given both Fuad Bey (a Druse, it may be recalled) and his master a salutary shock. The great year for pan-Arabism is hardly over when a situation arises which affects Arabs closely and, in particular, that home of pan-Arabism, Syria, and Ibn Saud has to admit to himself that the solution of the dispute depends mainly upon France and Great Britain, and not at all upon himself. Turkish intransigence will have had its uses if it imparts to men like Fuad Bey and to Ibn Saud, too, a sense of proportion. 24. ' The Saudi Government have at last, by a communique published in the Umm-al-Qura on the 15th January, performed their part in the reciprocal abolition of visa fees for merchants crossing the frontier between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia. 25. Saiyid Ibrahim-al-Bassam arrived from Beirut on the 3rd January to take up his post as Iraqi vice-consul attached to the Iraqi Legation here. It is suggested that his transfer was part of a scheme to break up a centre of possible opposition to the new Iraqi Government in Beirut. 26. We learn from Koweit that Dr. Naji-al-Asil, who went to Riyadh wearing the Iraqi costume of suit and “ sidara ” cap, returned wearing Arab head-dress and cloak, and that he informed the Political Agent that this was because of a remark by Ibn Saud about the necessity for foreign diplomats to wear Arab clothes when in Central Arabia. This agreeable story recalls the time during the siege of Jedda in 1925, when Dr. Naji stated from his b tel in London that he proposed to go to Jedda to “ use his influence ” with Wahabis, andthe British agent of the time wished that he might see the meeting between Ibn Sand’s wild Ghut-Ghut and this “ mincing boulevardier '—as he was then. '27. At the.end of the month instructions about the Koweit blockade were received which will perhaps enable another step to be taken towards the settlement of this thorny question. 28. It has now become quite clear that Ibn Saud will not renounce his claim to Jebel Naksh, and as His Majesty's Government have said that they regard it, as well as Khor-al-Odeid, as essential, no settlement on this point is to be hoped for at present. But Ibn Saud sees no harm in leaving that portion at least of the frontier in doubt, in view of the excellent relations, and so on Nor does His Majesty’s Minister, since the views of His Majesty’s Government on the point have been made very clear to Ibn Saud on more than one occasion. His . Majesty’s Minister and Fuad Bey are considering whether there are any other parts of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers about which they could make joint proposals that might appeal to their respective Governments. It may be mentioned that in reiterating, on Ibn Sand’s instructions, the Saudi claim to Jebel Naksh, Fuad Bey said nothing of economics, but claimed the hill on general grounds and for patrol purposes. His Majesty’s Minister was moved to enquire whether he had heard aright, or should the word have been “petrol”? Fuad Bey professed with a bland smile that this consideration had no weight with Ibn Saud, though it might be important to His Majesty’s Government, but he spoiled the effect a little by saying that he didn't think there was any oil in Jebel Naksh. 29. The promulgation by His Highness the Sultan*of Mukalla of certain reforms, notably the one requiring that, with the exception of the old ruling families, all classes of the population, sayids included, shall pay taxes, is claimed b\ some of the Hadhramis in Mecca as a victory of the Irshadi party in the Hadhramaut, and attributed by others to pressure from Ibn Saud, who, they naively say, threatened to annex the Hadhramaut unless the Sultan gave satis faction to the Irshadi, i.e., Wahabi, demands. The British authorities are oiven credit for having also insisted upon the adoption of the reforms—and for having threatened to hand over his territory to Ibn Saud if he refused. * 0W ? t0 t ^ ie ^ en Intelligence Summary the news that the Governor ot Hodeida is said to be going to Jeizan to discuss matters in dispute between the lemeni and Saudi Governments. Saiyid Muhammad Zabara (paragraph 416) aiii\ed back at Mecca from Riyadh about the 3 rd January. What his mission from his master the King of the Yemen was is still not known. HI -—Relations with Powers outside A rahia. ^I- ^he FiemTi Minister, M. Maigret, left for Hodeida on the French sloop d Iberville on the 28th January on his way to Sana to exchange ratifications of the commercial agreement which he signed on the 23rd April, 1936. While the vessel was at Jedda the admiral was entertained at lunch by Fuad Bey. i pA I he J urklsh Charge d’Affaires, M. Palsay, is*due to leave for Sana about the 1st March. It is thought that he also has an agreement of some kind in mind. 33. The honorary Belgian consul, Lieutenant-Colonel Depui, has returned tor a short period after a long absence. His cards announce him to be a Sherif which is untrue, and an envoy plenipotentiary, which has this much truth in it that he has received authority from the Belgian Government to negotiate a commercial agreement with the Saudi Government such as he concluded recently with the King of the Yemen. J e - 34 a 7 h . e marriage of the Princess Juliana was celebrated in Jedda by a lom? senes of festivities at the Netherlands Legation. The most distinguished was l lunch at the Legation which was attended by the Amir Feisal- but the most remarkable was an entertainment in which everything, from the Javanese dancing- and n pilgr h ims Cene ' Pamtmg a “ d jaZZ band ’ WaS the work of Javanese employee's fi pA i he E gyP tlar J consulate in Jedda becomes a Legation with effect from MinW th AKu Uaiy u and !v he cons . ul m char g e a first secretary. The Egyptian Minister, Abdurrahman Azzam, is to arrive shortly, to present his credentiVk in!? Gharge cTAffaires. U pthflLvemSK [931 b 3chief, M. Mujaddidi. It will be remembered (paragraph 192 of 1936) that M. Mujaddidi was on very had terms with the Saudi authorities when he left, and this fact, coupled with his long absence and his secretary’s ignorance of his movements, led to a belief that he would not return. The belief was coupled with hope, for by his rash quarrel about the house at Taif he may have queered the pitch for other foreign representatives who might like to go to Taif sometimes for a change of air. However, M. Mujaddidi returned on tne 31st January. 37. The Italian authorities in Eritrea, who make great difficulties about admitting even Italians, have been so considerate as to find room at Massawa for the notorious^ Afghan or Indian swindler, Ghulab Shah, who travels about under the alias of Saiyid Ghalib with a young Damascene named Muhammad Fuad-al- Abbasi who ran away from home with him. Ghulab Shah, who arrived in Jedda recently with his companion, lived at his ease in a hotel without ever paying a penny, and imposed on the Afghan Charge d’Affaires, from whom he “borrowed' eleven pounds. The Saudi authorities ordered the pair to be deported, and eventually placed them on board an Italian ship bound for Massawa. The kindness of the Italians, which only the malicious could attribute to the anti-British sentiments which Ghulab Shah is always prepared to admit, squares with the report which was received some time before, that Ghulab Shah had written to the ex-King Amanullah, asking him to obtain permission for him to enter Italian territory. 38. In an earlier paragraph ( 11 ) it has been shown how the Arab Aviation Society managed to refer to all the manifestations of Saudi activity in the sphere of aviation without mentioning Italy. A similar reticence was noticed in a verbatim report published in the l 1 mm-al-Qura of a lecture in Egypt given by a Hejazi on the subject of progress in Saudi Arabia. The speaker said that two missions had been sent abroad for training, one in aviation, the other in X-ray work. It is expressly stated that the latter went to Egypt, but the account of the aviation mission, which speaks at length of the prowess of the pilots, does not mention Italy as the place of training. 39. In response to repeated requests from Mr. Twitched, of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, that the State Department should appoint a repre sentative at Jedda to safeguard American interests, the United States consul- general in Alexandria, Mr. Morris, has been sent here to investigate and report. Mr. Morris, who arrived on the 31st January, expects to stay about a week, and to include a visit to the Cot-of-Gold mine in his enquiries. 40. Three Japanese who are believed to be connected with Japanese Moslem intrigue are making the pilgrimage this year. Two or possibly all of them have been here before. 41. Q. “ Has the Soviet Minister collected £30,000? ” A. “ No, but the Albanian grandfather of the wife of the Viceroy has sent 10 kilog. of dates to M. Stalin.” This is not a model sentence for a new Ollendorf, but a plain statement of fact M. KhakimofTs journey to Mecca (paragraph 426 of 1936) brought the payment for Soviet oil products no nearer. Set a Wahabi to catch a Tartar. 1V .—M iscellaneous. 42. The French sloop, the d'Iberville, arrived on the 26th January and left for Hodeida, with the French Minister, on the 28th January. The admiral was on board. 43. Mr. Philby has extended his tour to the Farsan Islands. He may have undertaken this journey to fill the time while waiting for cars from Jedda to replace his foundered transport. His company sent one car from Jedda to meet him, but it too broke down. 44. Mr. Lenahan, manager of ther* California Arabian Standard Oil Company, returned from the Persian Gulf on the 27th January. 44a. Captain J. S. Hunt, I.A. (retired), formerly in the Albanian gendarmerie, arrived on the 17th January to join Sharqieh (Limited). 45. Mr. Mudarris, of the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited), who was concerned in the negotiations by Avhich the concession was secured, left on the 13th January. Mr. T. Hutton and Mr. F. A. Ball have joined the staff. 46. Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. The Islamised Hollander, M. van de Poll, who resigned recently, left on the 20th January, with Mr. Wells,7 lo\ a the syndicate's American expert on tractors. Mr. McConachie, a British engineer w formerly employed in the Sudan by Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., arrived on the 17th January to take up employment with the syndicate. 47. M. Teurier, a French official of the Credit jfoncier d'Algerie et de Tunisie, arrived on the 20 th January to deal with banking operations for pilgrims from French North Africa. 48. Mme. Fattahoff, wife of the Kirghiz secretary at the Soviet Legation, left for Soviet Russia on the 24th January to sit for a diploma in applied mathematics. She expressed satisfaction that her route would take her through Baris where she would spend eight days in order to see the ancient monuments. A reasonable deduction from what is known of Mme. Fattahoff leads to the belief that she might be found searching for ancient monuments in the Rue de la Paix. 1 he wife of the other secretary, Mme. Litvin, who has been here about two months, wanted to leave at the same time, not with mathematics in view, but because Jedda does not provide the cinemas and other bourgeois attractions that she likes. She has, however, been detained by M. Khakimoff, w T ho besides using persuasion has refused to give her a passport. After all, he says, there must be someone to run the house. Similar methods have been used, he states, with the Russian lady doctor in Sana, who had been importuning him for permission to leave and for a passport for the purpose, on the ground that she needed a rest, that the place was unbearably lonely and so on. 49. One of the departures this month was that of a German nurse who came I, to Jeddah with the Fuad Hamza family in November. Two months was enough for her health and her endurance, though there has been no bad weather since she arrived. Fuad Bey is looking for an Englishwoman as nurse to his child. It is to be hoped that any English nurse who is thinking of taking such a post in Jedda will ask official advice before deciding to accept. 50. Mme. Palsay, who had arrived with her husband, the Turkish Charge d'Affaires, only about two months before, died on the 11 th January, and was buried in a Moslem cemetery near the town. When M. Palsay went to see the grave the following day he was stopped at the cemetery gate by an armed sentry, wffio informed him that he had strict instructions not to allow any person to visit the graves. This is in accordance with Wahabi tenets. M. Palsay has now obtained official permission to visit the cemetery whenever he wishes, but as there is only one key, which is kept by a senior official, he usually enters the cemetery, with the aid of the sentry, by climbing the low wall which surrounds it. 51. It is understood that the two small Italian steamers of the Tyrrhenian Line, which have maintained a fortnightly service between Egypt, Jedda and Massawa for some years, are to be taken off, and that in future fortnightly calls at Jedda will be made by larger Italian steamers on the East African run. 52. It is reported that during December and January consignments of Roumanian Redeventsa kerosene, imported by a local merchant from Hamburg, were put on the markets at 12 piastres per case less than the Shell product; 12,000 cases are said to have arrived, and further shipments of kerosene, and possibly of petrol, are expected, *o the perturbation of firms importing brands which have hitherto enjoyed an almost complete monopoly of the Hejazi market. But there is no definite news of another consignment, and the unusual character of the first suggests that it was due to a sudden need for foreign exchange and was not an economic venture worth repeating. 53. The three Egyptian schoolmasters selected by the Egyptian Ministry of Education at the request of the Saudi Government to teach Natural Science, Mathematics and English have arrived and been posted to the School for the Preparation of Missions, i.e., the school for preparing students for higher education abroad. A preparatory section is to be attached to this schoorfor students who need training for a year ~ enable them to enter the school proper. The school is also to have a boarding nouse for students who cannot afford to pay fees. 54. It is announced that the Egyptian Ministry of Education has decided to send a teacher for the Najah school at Medina at is own expense. 55. A periodical entitled the Manhal is to appear in Medina shortly. It will deal with literature, science and economics. Not. it will be noted, politics. 56. The Saudi Government announce their intention to be represented at the Fifteenth International Ophthalmic Conference, which is to be held in Cairo next December.f 8 * mm 57- Saudi Arabia is rich in locust experts this year. No sooner was Mr. Maxwell Darling’s expedition arranged for (paragraph 434 of 1936) than news was received of an Egyptian anti-locust expedition, consisting of three or four experts, who are travelling from YYejh to Jedda by camel. Discreet enquiries tend to show that the ‘ ‘ practical difficulties '' which prevent the Saudi authorities from allowing Mr. Darling to visit the Dawasir are not likely to disappear soon, and that they probably indicate nothing more definite than a general unwilling ness to have a foreigner ferreting about in that region. 58. We record with satisfaction a great reduction this year in the number of destitute pilgrims arriving overland. It is reckoned that there are only about forty, which is a tenth of the number last year at this season. Some are believed to have come via Iraq, others via the Yemen. Most pilgrims who have gone to Medina have gone by camel, and the demand for camels has been so large that the drivers have had to supplement their trained camels with untrained ones. The attempts to collects money from pilgrims for various charitable or other objects are determined. The Piastre Fund and the Aviation Fund have been referred to elsewhere. In addition, there are many charitable objects to which pilgrims are pressed to subscribe. Some protection is afforded to Indian pilgrims, to whom the Indian vice-consul explains the purely voluntary character of these schemes. The mutawwifs also, though enthusiastic for the funds in public, advise in private against subscription. The pilgrim news that aroused the greatest interest this month was a report from Spanish Morocco that a steamer provided by General Franco to convey Riffian pilgrims to Jedda at cheap rates had been bombarded by a French warship, by a Spanish Government aeroplane—anyhow, by something. Among the distinguished pilgrims who have arrived this month are near relatives of their Highnesses the Sultans of Perak. Kedah and Pahang, and the Sultan of Dar Masalit, Darfur Province, Sudan. 59. r l he Government of India dispensary was opened at Mecca for the pilgrim season on the 1 st January. 60. Eight thousand to 10.000 Egyptian pilgrims are expected this year as against 5,500 in 1935. The Zamzam arrived on the 20th January and the Kawsar on the 31st, each with about 1,600 pilgrims. 61. Lnder the title “ foreign Medical Missions ” the Mecca press publishes for the first time the names of the foreign doctors and dispensers who will be working in Mecca at the time of the pilgrimage. The object of the announcement is obviously to be able to say in print that “ the Government has agreed to issue temporary licences for the present season, authorising them to discharge the duties entrusted to them by their Governments in accordance with the law of the 4th Rajab. 1354 (2nd October, 1935).’' The numbers are as follows :— “ Mission accompanying the pilgrims ” from— Egypt. India. Java. Afghanistan. Doctors ... ... ... 4 2 1 1 Dispensers ... 3 Assistant dispensers ... 2 ... ... 1 The figures for the Indian “ medical mission ” are wrong, as we have four licensed dispensers. Figures for the other missions are probably incorrect. But the appearance of the list at all is worth mentioning as a novelty. 62. It is announced that the authorities are thinking of building a hospital at Arafat and are considering the estimates. Hitherto the only hospital provision at Arafat has been a camp hospital set up for the occasion. 63. The Director-General of Public Health, Dr Mahmud Hamdi, visited a British steamer which had brought pilgrims from Bengal, and picked out a pilgrim at random to see whether he really had been vaccinated and inoculated against cholera as his certificate said he had The Legation doctor, who was present, reports that not only did Dr. Mahmud look for the vaccination mark, which was reasonable, but he also looked for signs of the inflammation due to the inoculation, though such signs had naturally disappeared during a voyage of eighteen days. However, Dr. Mahmud made no comment except to ask whv the pilgrim had not been inoculated against typhoid also. He was informed by the Legation doctor that typhoid inoculation was not compulsory for British pilgrims It is hardly unfair to Dr. Mahmud to say that his desire to pick holes in the sanitary services of Powers discharging their duties under the Paris Convention is keener than his interest in the public health of the Hejaz.9 64. The public health authorities have shown a spurt of energy in having soldiers and school-children vaccinated, and in warning the public in Jedda by town crier to take precautions against foot-and-mouth disease, which is said to have attacked cows and goats. An Indian “ Yunani ” doctor (a sort of herbalist) who is employed in the Saudi Public Health Service, caused consternation by granting a death certificate at Taif stating the cause of death to have been cholera. He was compelled to withdraw the certificate and to issue another one giving “ pernicious malaria ” as the cause of death. Dr. Abdul Hamid, the Legation doctor, who made a careful enquiry, is quite certain that the authorities were right in insisting that the cause of death was not cholera, though whether it was a case of pernicious malaria and not rather food poisoning is another matter. 65. A Hindu who was brought out as a specialist in ferro-concrete work died after being operated on by two Hejazi doctors for alleged appendicitis. The authorities took him to the European cemetery for burial, but. on being told by the keeper that no one could be buried there without the permission of the British Legation, which has been in charge of the cemetery for some years, they buried the body in the desert. It is noteworthy that, although they have such strict Puritan views about their own cemeteries, they have never tried to interfere with the European cemetery, which contains a number of the tombstones and inscriptions which the Wahabis find so offensive. 66 . One of the owners of the four slaves who were at the Legation at the time of the exchange of notes on the 3rd October (paragraph 437 of 1936) returned from the Sudan recently. When asked by the Legation whether he would not like to free these slaves, he announced himself as a Sudani and a “ British subject” and cheerfully promised compliance. He has not yet produced the deed of manumission. Two slaves came to take refuge at the Legation, but could only be referred to the Governor of Jedda. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has not found anything to support the tale told in paragraph 399 (1936) of the alleged enslavement of a boy belonging to Dhubai. It is believed here, how ever, that the story cannot be without foundation, and an attempt to obtain more information is being made. A Sudani girl who was set free in February 1936 at the instance of the Legation and who then wanted to stay in this country was repatriated on the 31st January. The former owner, a member of the well-known Qabil family, seems to have been emboldened by the change in the arrangements relating to slaves to begin to harass the girl with charges of theft and immoral conduct and indirectly to annoy her present employer, an employee of the Legation, against whom Qabil has a mean and baseless grudge. The Legation was able to bring pressure to bear upon Qabil so that the girl might be able to leave without having to apply for permission under article 8 of the Slavery Regulations and perhaps to meet in the courts charges fabricated by Qabil. 67.

Jedda Report for December 1936. I .—Internal Affairs. 400. The King seems to have spent most of the month at Riyadh, where Fuad Bey had much business with him. He was to leave for Khafs on a shooting expedition towards the end of December. The Amir Feisal returned to Mecca from Riyadh on the 10 th December. The Minister of Finance, after completing a tour of inspection in Qatif and Hasa and reporting to Ibn Sand in Riyadh, came to Jedda on his way to Egypt. 401. Fuad Bey Hamza returned from Mecca on the 1 st December, but left again for Riyadh on the 5th December. From then until the 25th, when he returned to Jedda, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Jedda was reduced, like the Cheshire cat, to a grin—that of Saiyid Ali Taha, the frightened chrysostom who is occasionally used as a channel of communication with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and is so crushed by the responsibility of his position that on one occasion when he transmitted some harmless message to a foreign representative he said he had no authority to accept a reply. However, Fuad Bey declares that instead of living at Mecca and making occasional visits to Jedda he proposes to live in Jedda, where he has established his family (with a German nursemaid), and only to leave when he is obliged to visit Mecca or Riyadh. But so many schemes promising normal contact between the foreign representatives and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs have been adopted and abandoned, that this announcement of Fuad’s is regarded with scepticism. Fuad Bey returned to Jedda from Mecca towards the end of the month. 402. December has been a quiet month for aviation. The only machine which has been seen in the air is the one belonging to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. The hangar which has been sent from Italy in sections (paragraph 376) is being erected by a group of ten Italians who are also preparing the new Kandara aerodrome with the aid of all the spare Takruni labour in Jedda, The Russian aviator states that the hangar is not a present from Italy, but is being sold to the Saudi Government for the very low price of £2,000. He also says that Ibn Sand does not wish the Italian airmen to remain in the country unless they agree to take service under the Saudi Government and cease to be employed by the Italian Government. It is believed that aeroplanes are to be used even more than last year for the transport of Egyptian pilgrims, but Colonels Etherton and Micklem (paragraph 372) failed to get permission for a Misr Airwork aeroplane with a Moslem pilot to come to Jedda to fetch them, though Fuad Bey saw no harm in the proposal and submitted it to higher authority for them. 403. Two prospecting parties belonging to Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) set off on the 19th December, one for Lith and the other for 9035 [906 cc—2] Bwammm 2 Yanbu. It will be remembered that the country between these two towns, which marks the Holy Places, is excluded from their concession. Both parties arrived, the Lith party with great difficulty. The manager complains of the size and cost of the escort which the Saudi authorities compel each party to take with it, usually seven men, an n.c.o. and two guides. The company have to give each man eight rials a month and his food, and to pay the Government in respect of each guide five gold pounds a month and each other man three gold pounds. It is believed that the men see little of the payments made to the Government, which are perhaps credited to the Treasury as overhead charges. 404. 1 he California Arabian Standard Oil Company are working under a concession granted by the Saudi Arabian Government to the Standard Oil Company of California, which confers exclusive rights in an area bounded on the south by a line which it would be difficult to place exactlv on the map. The western boundary, viz., the western edge of the Dahna, is' clear, but as to the southern boundary article 2 of the concession says “ from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahna, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south 30 degiees east to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia. According to one view this leaves almost none of the Ruba-al-Khali to the south of ^the concession aiea, but the Legation has suggested that this interpretation is perhaps unnecessarily favourable to C alifornia Arabian Standard Oil Company. From Mr Philby’s The Empty Quarter, p. 344 and the first of the two end maps, it would appeal* that the Dahna proper ends somewhere—perhaps a considerable distance to the north of his 1934 route. It is true that the Rumailah, through which Mr. Philby passed, is described by him at p. 344 as “generally regarded as a southerly continuation of the Dahna ” and on the map as “ sand tract similar to Dahna,” but it is clear from his words that it is not called Dahna, and both the statement at p. 344 and the map indicate that there is a gap between the Dahna and the Rumailah. If this view is correct, there is an area in the south eastern portion of Saudi Arabia which is not included in the California Arabian Standard Oil Company's concession, though the extent of that area depends upon the result of the frontier negotiations between Saudi Arabia and His Majesty’^ Hoc eminent. Ihe extent of the area might be of importance to oil companies. 405. Colonels Etherton and Micklem failed to secure the mining concession for which they were applying, and they left on the 6 th December. Colonel Micklem professed to be rather relieved that their offer had not been accepted, on the gi ound that the transport difficulties involved in working the concession would have been immense, there being 200 miles or more of desert between the coast and the eastern boundary of the concession area. 406. It is presumably because the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s present concession marches with the area now up to offer that the syndicate was able to upset the plans of Colonel Etherton. Later, Mr. Twitched visited Riyadh with a geologist and a transport expert to treat for the new concession, which is believed to include the promising Jebel Hilit district and possibly the legendary Najadeh gold mine. According to a reliable informant he offered, as part of the pi ice, to consti uct a first-class motor road from Riyadh to the Hejaz with road making machinery which the syndicate already have in the country. Work on the syndicate’s jetty at Jedda has been begun, and a Decauville railway has been constructed to carry stone from the “ bluffs ” near by. 407. What was believed to have been an advance made to the Saudi Govern ment by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (paragraph 300) was, in fact, a loan. The authorities are finding some difficulty in collecting the money for the monthly instalments by which the loan has to be refunded. It is noticed that most of the rials are old and, as these have a much larger silver content than the new, it is assumed that there was no foundation for the belief which was held that the Saudi Government had in hand a large stock of new rials to be released at the height of the pilgrim season. 408. The engineer, Muhammad Bey Hasan, selected by the Egyptian Government at the request of the Saudi Government to report on the roads in this country, has arrived and begun work. The Egyptian Government (paragraph 427) is said to regard the macadamisation of the roads from Jedda to Mecca and Medina as the most worthy object of Waqf expenditure after the repair of the two mosques. A passage from a Najaf paper is quoted in the Umm-al-Qura saying that the Iraq authorities are busy repairing the pilgrim road from Najaf to Rahba, and that many more pilgrims, especially Indians? are3 expected to travel by that route this year than last. Meanwhile, the King’s chauffeur, Muhammad Siddiq, claims to he getting on well with a scheme, for which the King has given him a concession, for transport across Arabia from some port on the Hasa coast of the Persian Gulf to Mecca. He says that he has raised most of the necessary capital from other people, and in particular from ^Muhammad Surur, to have been in correspondence with Messrs. Thos. Cook and Son in India, and to be in treaty for the purchase of Swedish cars for the cross-desert service. The making of a good road from Riyadh to the Hejaz is reported (paragraph 406) to be one of the inducements offered by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate in exchange for another concession. The Political Agent at Bahrein reports that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company are now constructing a road ftom Ras Tanura to A1 Khobar, and that develop ments are projected to enable steamers to make Ras Tanura a port of call. 409. Official Communique No. 16. published in the Umm-al-Qura of the / 11 th December, reports that the Director-General of Police at Mecca has been / appointed Inspector of Slave Affairs and his assistant Deputy-Inspector, and that j the police throughout the Saudi Arabian kingdom will be the competent/ authorities for the purpose of the registration of slaves (see articles 13 and 9 of/ the Slavery Regulation attached to the Jedda report for October). 410. There has been a series of burglaries in Jedda after some years of immunity from this form of crime. Among the sufferers are two Indian dispensers attached to the Legation, who lost clothing and considerable sums of money in this way. Various suspects are under arrest. The authorities can be counted upon to do their best to discover the burglars, for Ibn Saud is known to pride himself upon the freedom of his realm from theft and robbery. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 411. The Legation have received copies of the comments of the Sheikh of Koweit on the draft regulations which are designed to put an end to the Koweit blockade, and of his counter-draft (paragraph 282) of article 1 , but the observa- j tions of the British authorities concerned have not yet arrived, so the matter has not been taken up again with the Saudi Government. 412. References to Ibn Saud’s attitude towards the troubles in Palestine have been few in these monthly reports, as communications on the subject between Ibn Saud and His Majesty’s Government are always conveyed through the Saudi Legation in London. Ibn Saud cannot be expected not to have one eye on pan- Arab aims, but, subject to that proviso, he did his best, in co-operation with the other Arab rulers, to induce the Palestine Arabs to put an end to the strike and the disorders, and he is also using his influence against the refusal of the Palestine Arabs to give any evidence before the Royal Commission. The Palestine delegation which visited Iraq to consult about the Royal Commission was reported from Bagdad to be leaving for Riyadh via Basra and Koweit on the 24th December. 413. On Fuad Bey’s return from Riyadh the Transjordan questions mentioned in paragraph 380 were taken up again. He brought categorical assurances from Ibn Saud that the lodging of complaints in writing at the British Legation in Jedda about alleged frontier violations did not indicate any change in the resolve of the Saudi Government to pursue the method of co-operation between the frontier officials provided for in the 1933 agreement, Fuad Bey said that sometimes questions of principle were involved which justified a more formal communication through the Legation, but His Majesty's Minister said that this did not apply to all, if to any, of the written complaints in question. At the beginning of the month a written protest was received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that a British aeroplane had crossed the Transjordan frontier into Saudi Arabian territory near Haditha on the 22 nd November and after getting back to Mecca, Fuad Bey telephoned to say that he had received several other complaints of violations of the frontier by British aeroplanes between Haditha and Hazim. He probably did not like to put on paper any protest referring to Hazim, which the Transjordan authorities have always held to be on their side of the frontier. The complaints have been forwarded to Transjordan for examination. They were used by His Majesty’s Minister as yet one more argument in favour of a settlement of the Transjordan frontier \fter seeing [906 cc 2] B 24 Ibn Saud, however, Fuad Bey could still say nothing except that the Saudi Government wanted more information. His Majesty’s Minister gained the impression that the Saudis were making, or intended to make, a survey of their own, but he did not say anything on that point lest the Saudi Government should think that His Majesty’s Government had anything to fear from such a survey. 414. In the absence of Fuad Bey at Riyadh it became necessary to follow up the conversations with him about Mr. Philby’s visit to Shabwa (paragraph 382) by a letter to the Amir Feisal. The reply received was not a good one. It repeated, unnecessarily, the Saudi disclaimer which had already been accepted b Y .His Majesty's Government, and advanced several arguments which had obviously been provided by Mr. Philby in order to minimise his offence—and to annoy His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Minister has had what he hopes will be the last word on the subject in a conversation with Fuad Bey, which was confirmed in writing on the more important points. It has been made quite clear that Mr. Philby’s excuses about having to enter the Hadhramaut for spares and stores do not apply to Shabwa, which he obviously set out with the intention to visit. His Majesty’s Minister represented to Fuad that in securing an armed force (or escort) from the Saudi Government for the purpose of topographical work in Najran and stealing off without their knowledge and taking it into the Aden Protectorate, Mr. Philby was playing a nasty trick on the Saudi Govern ment, who ought to tell him so. Ibn Saud may be annoyed at the dust kicked up by Mr. Philby, but he will never understand why we do not ourselves punish a British subject if we have cause of complaint against him, and he may be flattered if Mr. Philby reports, as he probably will, that with the aid of Ibn Saud s name and escort he was able to enter in security a town which it is not easy to approach from the Aden side. And Mr. Philby will be delighted to have drawn the fire of His Majesty’s Government, which will enable him to appear l Jl bis favourite role of martyr. His Majesty’s Minister prophesies that ^ r - * bnby will dramatise himself as Prometheus returning from Shabwa with archaeological knowledge, with His Majesty’s Government in the part of /eus, and His Majesty's Minister as the vulture' with nothing better to do tlian to peck Mr. Philby’s long-suffering liver, already deeply pitted from similar heroic experiences in India, Iraq and Transjordan. . , 415 - . T1 ? e . of tlle Yemen complained to Ibn Saud as well as to the Aden authorities of the entry of Mr. Philby into Yemen territory, viz., Jauf and Marib, with a Saudi force. According to Fuad Bey the Saudi Government gave Fn.,i n' 1 “ r j P ' y S m 'lr r to th , at whtch they gave to His Majesty’s Government. ,^ SaK t0 H ,V S s ^mister, however, that perhaps the Imam only thought the places Mr. Philby went to were parts of Jauf and Marib. q • • } ^ i e t m r n-ul-Q ura of the 18th December announces the despatch of i-aiyid Muhammad Zabara, a Councillor of State in the Yemen, by His Majesty the Imam Yahya, to King Abdul Aziz on a private mission. This is the'man (paragraph 214) who was said by the Sa last June to have gone to G h6 adheS1 ? n ° f 1 the y emen t0 the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. Somf colour is lent to the rumours referred to last month (paragraph 381) about Ibn Saud’s of X Polie ega h dlng the ^ emen ', b -r t l' e fact that Talat Wafa - the Director-General of 1 olice, who is m command of the regular Saudi forces in Najran and Abha has not been allowed to take the leave which had been granted him after a lono’ absence, but was ordered back to his post immediately after his arrival in Mecca'’ nou-sstoT ° f wSr® 1 ar ! ng s application for permission to visit the mixiefy (paragra P h 434 &gt; can Perhaps be taken as another indication of this 4 ? 4 * * 7 - announced, rather long after the event, that when the Iraqi Minister for foreign Affairs visited Riyadh recently, he transmitted to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz the insignia of the Hashim'ite Order which had been conferred upon the King by His Majesty King Ghazi.

Muhammad Surur, in his capacity as representative of the Saudi Arab young men, telegraphed congratulations to Hashim-al-Atasi and Jamil Mardam on the success of their efforts (in the negotiations with France).V 9 5 419. The Umm-al-Qura claims to have received private information from Bahrein that Colonel Fowle, “ chief of the British consuls in the Gulf,” has been authorised to hold at Bahrein, at the beginning of 1937, a special British conference to decide about the political status of “these amirates ” and their unification in matters of communications and customs dues. The interest of this canard is considerably increased by a misprint which represents our opposite numbers on the other side of Arabia not as the consuls (“ qanasil ”), but as the bombshells (“ qanabil ”) of the Gulf. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 420. M. Maigret, the French Minister, returned from leave in Syria on the 20th December. 421. M. Persico, the Italian Minister, departed on leave on the 11 th December. He hopes to obtain a transfer and seems to think that he will succeed. He mentions Tehran and Havana as possible posts. The Legation has been left in the charge of M. Bellini (paragraph 407 of December 1935). 422. Fuad Bey returned to Jedda full of geniality towards His Majesty’s Minister. Several things he said suggest that he had had instructions at Riyadh in this sense. According to one statement he made, Ibn Saud said to him that never had he felt that his relations with His Majesty’s Government were so satisfactory as at present. Apparently he feels that his attitude in regard to Palestine has convinced His Majesty's Government of his sincerity and his desire to be helpful. On the other hand, there was a faint suggestion in Fuad’s words that Ibn Saud felt that he had now more than paid for the concessions made to him in the matter of the Treaty of Jedda. In spite of Fuad Bey’s geniality, no advance was made with the two major questions discussed with him—the Transjordan frontier and the eastern and south-eastern frontiers. 423. The Saudi mission at the Coronation next May will consist of the Amir Saud, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, and a “ secretary ” not yet selected. 424. In paragraph 223 reference was made to a grandiose plan said to have been formed by the doctor of the Italian Legation in the first flush of the Italian victories, for the establishment of a magnificent Italian dispensary in Jedda and the importation of a lady doctor and several nurses. There seems to be little doubt that Dr. Fea did in fact propose to open a large dispensary in the town, and there may be truth in the rest of the rumour 'too. The Saudi Government have, however, discouraged any extension of Italian medical activities in Jedda, and this may have been why the Italian Minister telegraphed to Rome, as he told a member of the Legation staff he had done, to ask that Dr. Fea should not return. 425. A report that the Italian Minister had informed the Saudi authorities that the journey of a large number of pilgrims from Ethiopia would be facilitated by the Italian Government this season was regarded with some scepticism by the Legation, because of the expenditure of foreign currency which such a project would involve and the consequent derogation from the Italian regulations in force in Ethiopia. However, the Saut-al-Hejaz now reports that 1,900 Ethiopian pilgrims are coming to Mecca this season and that the Government of Italy are affording all facilities. 426. The Soviet Legation has been strengthened by the arrival of a new secretary, M. Litvin, with his wife. M. Litvin studied the economics of the Arab States at the feet of M. Khakimoff, when the latter, after seven or eight years in Jedda and Sana, became a lecturer at some propaganda institution in Moscow. M. Khakimoff left for Mecca on the 23rd. He informed a member of the staff of the British Legation that he was going to see the Saudi authorities about their debts to the Soviet Government, dating from 1930, for the supply of petrol, kerosine and other commodities. This news is surprising, as it was supposed that even Moslem representatives of foreign States were expected to confine their business conversations to Jedda. 427. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, Minister of Finance, accompanied by Khalid-al-Qarqani, left for Egypt on a mission on the 16th December. It is understood that he is to discuss Waqf payments with the Egyptian Government and certain pilgrim matters also. According to reports' from Egypt, the Egyptian Government propose, as an alternative to the former procedure whereby6 after the repair of the Mecca and Medina mosques the balance of the Waqf receipts were distributed to “ the poor and the Bedouin,” that the balance should be devoted to the execution of these three projects :— ( 1 ) Macadam i sat ion of the Mecca-Jedda-Medina road. (2) A proper water supply for Mecca. (3) An electric light system for Mecca. It is apparently intended that the Egyptian Government shall not disinterest themselves in the schemes when these have once been carried out, for it is proposed that the revenue which may accrue to the Egyptian Government from their financial share in the schemes should be distributed to the poor. The newspaper report says that the new generation in the Hejaz is understood to welcome these proposals. Tbn Sand’s attitude is not mentioned. I V. — Miscellaneous. 428. H.M.S. Weston left for Port Sudan on the 2nd December. 429. Colonel and Mrs. J. Wikeley arrived on the 16th December to stay with His Majesty’s Minister. This is perhaps the first occasion when Jedda has been able to pose as a winter health resort. 430. Dottore Salvatore Aponte (paragraph 393) left for the Sudan on the 6 th December. 431. Mr. P. J. Dunckley, who has resigned from the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (paragraph 371), left for the United Kingdom on the 16th December He lived in Addis Ababa for many years, until business losses drove him out not long before the trouble between Italy and Ethiopia began, and it is believed that he will endeavour to get back to Ethiopia. • ^ rs : Mountain (paragraph 371), who works the ground wireless with which communication is maintained with the aeroplane which her husband pilots for the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, returned from sick-leave on the 16th December. 433. Over 2,000 British Malayan pilgrims have already landed at Jedda. as against under 1,000 tor the whole of the last pilgrim season. 434. In reply to the request for facilities for Mr. Maxwell Darling’s locust researches (paragraph 396), the Saudi Government raised no objection to his visiting the Hofuf region and proceeding from there across Arabia to Jedda, but. said that practical difficulties ' made it impossible for him to visit Dawasir. Of the various explanations of this cryptic phrase which have been suggested, perhaps the most probable is that anyone visiting the Dawasir might become aware of the measures of precaution taken by Ibn Sand in the direction of the Yemen border. 435 ” Quarantine stations and the pilgrimage : Action of the Office inter national d Hygiene pubhque in Paris ” is the caption appended in the Umm-al- Qma of the 11 th December to a statement alleged by a Damascus paper to have been made by Dr. Mahmud Hammuda, Director-General of Public Health in Niudi Arabia, after attending the meetings of the Office in Paris. Accordim- to this statement the Office, after studying Dr. Mahmud’s report, admitted that the state of health in the Hejaz was every day in every way getting better and better, and thanked King Abdul Aziz (standing) for his activities in this respect, and congratulated his representative (still standing) on the progress achieved. 1 i 6 . re P or ^ P a y a ccurate, but when Dr. Mahmud goes on to say that the Otnee admitted his contention that the pilgrim quarantine stations outside the Hejaz were no longer necessary, it may be assumed either that Dr. Mahmud is talking to please Ibn Sand rather than to state the truth, or that the Damascus newspaper has not reported him correctly. The remarks attributed to Dr. Hamuda end with the statement that the Health Office is to ask the States concerned, z.^., those who have Moslem subjects,” to furnish their comments on his report m time for the matter to be settled at the meeting of the Office next year, and that, meanwhile, the Saudi Government wiH communicate with each of them on the subject. 436. On the 27th November there was published in the Umm-al-Qura a supplement to the Regulations for the Registration of the Effects of Deceased Pilgrims (for a translation of these regulations, see the appendix to Jedda Reportfor November 1927). The main provision is in article 1 , which reads: “ To appoint an executor is a general Shara right. Should any pilgrim desire to change his executor, whose name is written in his pilgrim pass, he shall have the right to appoint whomever he may choose. This is to be deemed valid if legally proved in the Shara courts.” Article 2 has an ominous reference to “every subject of the baudi Arab kingdom, whose appointment as executor by the deceased has been legally established, whether during the lifetime of the testator or after his death ’ Hitherto, the estate of a deceased pilgrim was protected to some extent by the inscription of the name of his executor on his pilgrim pass (to say to some extent is correct, since if the executor was not close at hand at the time of death some of the property might stick to the fingers of the mutawwif), but now any Saudi subject who can persuade a Saudi Shara court that a deceased pilgrim appointed him executor can be approved in spite of the nomination of some other person, usually a relative or friend, by an entry in the pilgrim pass. This provision obviously opens the way to abuse, but unfortunately it rests on good Shara law, and all that the Legation can do is to watch what happens in practice. 4^7. The last manumission case involving the Legation has been disposed of finally, it is hoped. The slaves covered by the reservation made on behalf of His Majesty’s Government at the time of the exchange of notes on the drd October (paragraph 363) consisted of a middle-aged woman, her two daughters of 20 and 17, and her son of 14. This last case under the old dispen sation presented several difficulties. To repatriate the slaves would have been easy, but they wished to stay in the country. To induce the owners to manumit them and gain religious credit rather than see them lost by repatriation without kudos would probably have been no more difficult than in many other cases which have been disposed of successfully, but the owners could not be traced. And the younger of the daughters was due to have a baby at any moment. Eventually the slaves left the Legation under a guarantee from the Saudi Government that they will be allowed to live freely in this country and that, if the owners return and claim rights of ownership over the slaves, the Government will do their best to induce them to set the slaves free, even if that necessitates payment of some compensation. The slaves cheerfully accepted these terms rather than leave the country. The case is being watched.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for November 1936. 2 . Copies have been distributed as for the report for July last. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. 364. After an absence of over seven months Fuad Bey Hamza returned to Jedda on the 22nd November. He left for Mecca on the 25th, for a short visit. 365. A coming man appears to be a certain Abdullah Khuwaitir, a Nejdi, who began as a friend and protege of Abdullah Suleiman and is said to be setting up as a rival. He is a sort of director of Government purchases, and one of his more successful deals is said to be the buying up at very low prices of the clothing and headdresses which Ibn Saud distributes and which the recipients promptly sell, and their resale to the Government at a profit. A comment made by the Legation s informant probably fits the case of Khuwaitir and that of many another Saudi official too. ‘ 1 Khuwaitir is doing a good service to his Govern ment, but at the same time he is not missing his own interests, please.” 366. i he Ministry of Finance seems to be collecting its share of the charges levied on pilgrims from the mutawwifs even earlier than usual. Another sign of shortage of cash in the Government till was an attempt made by the authorities whether it succeeded or not is not yet known), to compel the Mecca mutawwifs to despatch a large camel caravan of pilgrims to Medina early in Ramadan. The object was to ensure that pilgrims should not spend all their money in Mecca and be unable to go to Medina and contribute to the exchequer by means of the heavy This policy was very unwelcome to all the inhabitants of Mecca who live by the pilgrimage, especially those who sell the kind of things that pilgrims may be expected to buy during Ramadan and the subsequent feast. From the point of view of the pilgrim it does not matter much which course is followed, since he will hardly get away with any money in his pocket in any case, but the direction of the pilgrim traffic by the State into those channels which secure the largest possible share of the profits for the treasury cannot fail to cause discontent among many persons whose sole source of income is the pilgrimage. 367. It is announced that the training of the first batch of twenty young Saudis in^ the police school established last year has been completed.' The Director-General of Police returned from a visit to Iraq with a copy of the Police Regulations which he laid before the Saudi authorities. He brought with him also articles which might have been, from the context, traffic signals, or, from the root of the Arabic word, ointment to rub on the foreheads of little children. The strange word turns out, however, to be the Mejdi Arabic for drums. The damnable iteration of some of these instruments was heard daily at practice under the Legation windows, until the nuisance, which had lasted for two or three weeks, was brought to Fuad Bey’s notice, whereupon it was transferred to a more suitable place. Fuad Bey points out, as a proof of the evolution which Saudi Arabia is undergoing, that a year or two ago not even drums were allowed 8974 [881 ee—1] B EASTERN (Arabia). . December 28, 1936.

The Umm-al-Qura seizes the occasion offered by the completion of the training of the first batch of police officers to urge upon the youth of the country to take advantage of the local opportunities for vocational training for the police, the army and aviation, not to mention the school to fit students to follow courseij in institutions in foreign countries. The appeal would have been more attractive if it had been accompanied by an official guarantee that in future the custom of keeping official salaries several months in arrears would be discontinued. A later newspaper paragraph reports the nomination of two teachers from Egyptian colleges by the Egyptian Ministry of Education, at the request of the Saudi Government, to train Saudi students who are to go abroad to study science. 369. A leading article in the Umm-al-Qura calls upon Hejazis to free themselves from dependence on the pilgrimage by embarking upon industrial enterprises, and holds up the history of Japan during the last century as an example. To say that Japan had natural resources is no excuse; all countries have resources if the people are energetic. Centuries ago the Hejaz could export its surplus agricultural produce, but now through the laziness of its inhabitants it is dependent on other countries even for its food supplies. 370. Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) are about to begin prospecting in the area covered by their concession. Four geologists have arrived for the purpose : Messrs. Owen (British), Pomeyrol (French) and Wofford and Pike (American). The work is likely to be delayed by the unsuitability of the transport provided by headquarters in London, who seem to have chosen it without reference to local conditions. The tyres are too small for desert work, and the trucks themselves are too few in number, and so small that, according to the manager, they can hardly carry their own petrol. It seems to have been overlooked that even one geologist must take with him not only spares and large quantities of petrol, but also heavy tents, and finally the escort, which is fixed by tlie authorities at ten men. 371. Ihe Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) continue to put up permanent buildings at their terminal near Jedda, and have marked out a line for a pier over a mile long, tor which it is understood the material has already been ordered. Mr. Dunckley, an Englishman, who is manager in Jedda for the syndicate, aveis that the expenditure on the buildings and the pier is still unjustified, the water discovered being insufficient for the working of the Cot-of- Gold mine. Mr. Dunckley has always been dissatisfied with his position, and has now resigned and is to leave shortly, so he is a hostile witness; but Mr Twitchell whose optimism is responsible for the speculative expenditure, though he recently spoke of the discovery of more wells to His Majesty’s Minister, did not claim that enough water had been found to make the mine workable. The syndicate’s aeroplane, which is now based on Jedda, has made frequent flights for the surveying and photographing of the reefs over which the pier must pass to reach deep water. The aeroplane has lost its wireless operator, Mrs. Mountain wife of the pilot, who has had to leave through illness. With the approval of the Saudi authorities, H.M.S. Weston took soundings, to supplement and confirm oi correct those on the Admiralty chart, off the point where the seaward end of the pier would he, and she is to receive from the Mining Syndicate, in exchange for these figures, copies of the aeroplane photographs of that part of the coast with its reefs. j? 7 , 2 - Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Micklem, C.M.G., one of the directors of the Select Trust (Limited), arrived with Colonel Etherton (paragraph 171) on the 25th November. They are interested in a mining concession which Colonel Etherton seems to have tried to secure during his previous visit. They had proposed to travel to Jedda from Cairo by air, but owing, according to Colonel Etherton, to his failure to make the circumstances clear to the Saudi authorities the proposal was rejected. They flew to Port Sudan and reached Jedda later than if they had travelled from Egypt by steamer. They find the Saudi authorities lukewarm and elusive. This is probably because Mr. twitchell is after the same concession for his syndicate. One of their difficulties is that they cannot get into direct touch with any official of consequence. All their negotiations so far have been through (one cannot say with ”) Najib Bey Salha (see paragraph 268), a clever young Beirut-trained Egyptian who was a clerk with Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company a few years ago and is now Director of Public Works. ^ ’3 373. It might iiave been thought that the appointment of a committee for the improvement of the roads in the liejaz (paragraph 33 o) was mainly a pretext lor the levy of a new tax on pilgrims, and tne appointment of a sub-committee to look at the roads, and the issue of orders that the steam-rollers lying in tne work- ^^shops should be made ready did not necessarily mean that anything serious was being done. But the Egyptian Government have been asked to nominate a road engineer for employment in the Hejaz, and the sub-committee claim to have found a better road from Rabigh to Medina (the Rafsa Road, which runs by Raisa to Bir Anna, near Medina) and a small diversion by which the sandy patch on the Jedda-Mecca road from Alam to Shamisa can be avoided. Mr. Twitched, of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, states that the Saudi authorities have shown great interest in the work on the road to the Cot-of-Gold, and have been attempting more or less efficient imitations in some places. 374. The concession for the supply of electricity to the town of Jedda, which had been granted (paragraph 89) to two local merchants, is stated to have been cancelled. It is difficult to believe that the concession was of value, except as a speculation to people who wanted something to sell at a profit, for it is unlikely that an electricity enterprise for the town would pay for itself, still less earn profits. The foreign Legations and firms have private installations which they would be reluctant to exchange for the vagaries of a Saudi plant; the State and the municipality would expect electricity for nothing; and most of the local population are too poor to pay the price which would have to be charged by a commercial enterprise. 375. According to the Saut-al-Hejaz, two new short-wave wireless stations, which are unaffected by atmospherics, have been established at Abha and Riyadh. The authorities, the report continues, are trying to obtain a number of such sets for installation in various places. Sharqieh (Limited), who represented Messrs. Marconi when the contract for Marconi sets was obtained, state that the new sets are not Marconi’s. It is believed that a German was here some time ago trying to sell wireless sets to the Saudi Government. 376. The only aeroplane which has been seen in the air during the last two’^j or three weeks of November is the American machine belonging to the Saudi ] Arabian Mining Syndicate. It might be thought that Ramadan, which coincided I with the second half of the month, had something to do with this inactivity, but \ other causes are believed to be responsible. Xhe only one of the three Italian inst ructional machines which was in order at the beginning of the month ceased tcTappear very soon afterwards, and it is understood to be disabled in some way. On the 4th November a three-engined Caproni arrived as a present from the Italian Government. The local press describes it as a Caproni DC 101 eight- seater, and says that it flew from Rome via Tunis, Cairo, Asmara and Massawa, travelling 7,000 kilom. in thirty-five hours—apparently including stops. A reception to celebrate the arrival of the aeroplane was given at Kandara Palace, near the Kandara aerodrome, which was used for the first time when the Caproni arrived. The new machine flew every day for several days, often flying low over the town as though to make the greatest possible impression, but a breakdown j of some kind condemned it to immobility while spares were obtained from Asmara. ? The Italian Minister related, with a mixture of chagrin and amusement, that when the spares arrived the customs refused to admit them free of duty, while the Italian mechanics are said to be complaining that it is only with great difficulty that they can induce the authorities to give them even a little petrol for cleaning purposes. Two foreigners in Jedda, who are expert pilots, state that the Caproni is by no means of the latest type. They also say that while the popular opinion that the machine is a bomber is incorrect, it could easily be converted into a bomber. The machine is fitted with a wireless apparatus which, according to the local press, enabled it to communicate direct with Riyadh on arrival. T he Italians are supplementing their present of aeroplanes by presenting ahcTerecting a steel hangar which is to be bought out in sections. This must be the hangar which the Commandant of Jedda has spoken of as about to be erected to contain fifteen or twenty aeroplanes. The Russian pilot employed bv the Saudi Government, M. Naidyonoff, told His Maiesty’s Minister that the Wapitis were in excellent order and “ good for another five years.” but that they could not be used because it was a condition of Italian assistance in aviation that none but Italian aeroplanes should be used. This information, which is considered [881 ee— 1 ] b 2reliable, would also account for the fact that the machine which the French Government gave to Ibn Sand is never seen or heard of. 377. The belief that the Saudi eagles” trained in Italy would be less likely to cleave the empyrean with bright wing than to make a mess in the eyrie is confirmed from no less important a source than Said Bey-al-Kurdi, CommandanH^- of Jedda. During a courtesy visit which was paid to him by Commander Bowen of H.M.S. Weston, the conversation turned to aviation, which Said Bey said would be of the greatest use to Saudi Arabia, both for ordinary administrative purposes and as a means of controlling the tribes. He then broke out into a violent tirade, which, although nominally against all young Arabs educated abroad, was obviously aimed at the newly-returned “eagles.” Such people, he said, were good for nothing but to live a life of luxury and try to teach their grandmothers to suck eggs. They expected pay, food,'clothes and servants on European scales, but to work as men work in Europe was the last thing they would do. He declared that he disapproved entirely of the despatch of young Saudis to foreign countries to be educated or trained; he thought it much better that foreign instructors should be brought to Saudi Arabia. 378. The Saut-al-Hejaz continued in a recent article its attack (para graph 338) on heavy dowries as a hindrance to matrimony, and referred to measures taken in other countries to encourage marriage by penalising the unmarried and rewarding the others for their “ humanitarian and patriotic zeal.” II .—F rentier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 379. Saudi Arabia was wondering whether the change of Government in Iraq would mean a change of policy towards this country, but. as if to calm such apprehensions, the new Iraqi foreign Minister, Dr. Naji-al-Asil (referred to in the Saudi press as “ Saiyid ” Naji), went to Riyadh almost immediately, and on the 13th November exchanged ratifications with the Amir Feisal of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance. On the 16th November an agreement on the subject of passports and laissez-passers was signed by the two foreign Ministers. Commenting on the ratification of the treaty, the Saut-al-Hejaz proposes that there should also be ‘ 1 economic unity, with the organisation of the industrial, agricultural and commercial relations which that would involve.” 380. During 1936 the Saudi Government have sent in several written complaints of alleged violation of Saudi territory by the armed forces of Transjordan. In replying recently to one of these complaints, the Legation suggested that better results would be attained if the frontier officials would use the method of direct communication provided for in the Bon Voisinage Agree ment of 1933. The suggestion was repeated to Fuad Bey by His Majesty’s Minister, who said that, on our side, we had frequently had grounds for serious complaint, but had preferred to leave it to time and experience to convince the Saudi authorities of the good faith of the Transjordan frontier officials and their readiness to co-operate with the officials of Saudi Arabia, On the apparently simple point of local co-operation Fuad Bey showed an inability or unwillingness to understand that suggests the presence of some deep suspicion of our motives, or of the motives of the Government of Transjordan. A similar impression was conveyed by Fuad Bey’s manner when the discussion turned to the question of the line of the frontier between Transjordan and Nejd. Not long before he left. Sir Andrew Ryan summed up the negotiations on this point in a letter to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, which showed how close together the opposing views had been brought. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had promised to reply in writing, but eventually said that the matter required further study. According to Fuad Bey, he himself was in favour of the despatch of the written reply prepared by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, but Ibn Sand suppressed it, and, after communication with Riyadh, Fuad reports that the Saudi Government still require “certain information ” before they can continue the discussion. 381. There seems to be much bazaar talk about the Yemen, but it is difficult to decide how much of it is based upon information, correct or incorrect, received direct from the Yemen, and how much upon reports in Egyptian papers founded upon a recent article in the Times. There is a general belief, however, that Ibn Saud is keeping a close watch upon events in the Yemen, and it is even reported that he will leave Riyadh early this year and stay at Ashaira until the beginning5 of the pilgrimage month of Dhu’l Hijja, nominally because the drought in Nejd had dried up or spoiled the water in his favourite wells, but, in reality, because he wishes to be near at hand if there should be trouble in the Yemen. 382. The journal of the Royal Geographical Society records with satisfac tion the news of Mr. Philby’s expedition to Najran and Shabwa. The writer of the note was not to know that Mr. Philby visited Shabwa without warning with a strong Saudi escort, though Shabwa is well within the Aden Protectorate. His Majesty’s Minister spoke of this matter to Fuad Bey Hamza as soon as he returned and asked for an explanation. Fuad Bey said that the only information he had was that published in the Egyptian papers, though he knew that Mr. Philby had talked about visiting Najran and also Shabwa, which Miss Stark and a German had failed to reach. In any case he could never have replied on a matter of such importance without reference to Ibn Saud. By the time the reply was received His Majesty’s Minister was able to inform Fuad Bey that His Majesty’s Government were now being reproached by the Imam for the entry of Mr. Philby into the Yemen with the Saudi armed party. The reply was not received by the end of the month, but to complete the record it may be stated that Ibn Saud declares that he did not know Mr. Philby was going south of Najran, and throws on him all the responsibility for his excursion outside Saudi Arabia. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 383. The new Turkish Charge d’Affaires, M. Palsay, presented his credentials on the 7th November. Either M. Palsay or his Government is easily satisfied, for the credentials were presented not to the Amir Feisal, who as Viceroy receives the foreign representatives on first arrival if Ibn Saud is away at Riyadh, but to Sheikh Hamad Suleiman, who was described in the Umm-al-Qura on this occasion as “ acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,” but so far as is known to the Legation had merely been authorised (paragraph 330) to sign letters from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the absence of every other official of consequence from Mecca. The Turkish consul, Talaat Acar (i.e., Ajar) left on the 4th November, nominally on leave, but it is believed that he will not return. Since M. Palsay’s arrival the Turkish Legation, which began a year ago (paragraph 347, October 1935), to fly the Turkish flag on Sundays, instead of Fridays, now flies its flag both on Sunday and on Friday. 384. The journey from Bagdad of the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires to Iraq and Saudi Arabia, M. Adriaanse, ended at Jedda on the 15th November. He saw Ibn Saud at Riyadh on the 8 th November, and, according to the Umm-al-Qura, sent him the next day “ a present from Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands, viz., the highest class of the Order of the Netherlands Lion.” He received from Ibn Saud the present of an Arab mare. He returns from the active social life of Bagdad with feelings divided between gratitude for the hand some hospitality that he enjoyed and relief at sinking back into the peaceful, if primitive, life which the foreign community lives in Jedda. 385. On the 18th November Nahas Pasha and Fuad Bey Hamza exchanged in Cairo notes embodying the results of the friendly negotiations provided for in article VI of the Treaty of Cairo of May 1936 for the settlement of outstanding questions. The points dealt with in the notes are three in number :— ( 1 ) The sending of the Mahmal and the Kiswa from Egypt is to be resumed with effect from the forthcoming pilgrimage. The Mahmal is to remain in Jedda, where the Eiswa will be taken over by the Saudi authorities in ceremonial fashion. The Kiswa is to bear an inscription saying that it was presented to the Holy Kaaba in the reign of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz-al-Saud, King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. (2) The distribution of alms to the poor of the Hejaz and the distribution in the Hejaz of the surplus of the Waqfs of the two Holy Places are to be resumed with effect from the forthcoming pilgrimage. (3) Egyptians who were resident in Saudi Arabia when the Hejaz Nationality Law was promulgated and Saudis who were resident in Egypt at the time of the promulgation of the Egyptian Nationality Law are to have the right to opt, within six months from the date of the exchange of notes, for Egyptian or Saudi nationality.«386. ihe Hejazis, who regard themselves as most worthy objects of the chanty of the Moslem world, have hailed with great satisfaction the prospect of the return ol the stream of L-gyptian trust funds to its old bed, which has been n u S ° me y ears - T ^ e Saudl Government have failed in their desire to collect all the arrears also, but, on the other hand, they have won a victory in persuading the Egyptian Government to be content with sending the Mahmal as far as Jedda 387. The Italian Legation celebrated the birthday of King Emmanuel on the 11 th November by a party, which was perhaps larger than usual, in order to mark the arrival of the Caproni aeroplane and the presence of its crew. The official reception of the aeroplane and the puff about it in the press may have been flattering to Italian feelings, but the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 376 might well give one cause to fear the Saudis even when they accept gifts The manner of M. Persico suggests that he has few illusions about the efficacy of the policy of present-giving. 388. When speaking to His Majesty’s Minister about M. Tuimetoff, Soviet trade agent at Sanaa (paragraph 392), the Soviet Minister said : “ We don’t do any business in the Yemen now, and we shan’t do any more business there We sold our goods on credit, then the crisis came, and Tuimetoff is now trying to collect the money due to us. Fortunately, these small markets like the Yemen and the Hejaz mean little to an export business the size of ours.” IV.— Miscellaneous. 0 &gt;_ , H.M.S. W eston (Commander J. H. Bowen) arrived on the 27th November for a stay of five days. 390. Mr. H. M. Eyres returned from leave on the 25th November. 4 , o 39 . 1 '.. Col &lt;r' Mackie. late I.M.S. (paragraph 356), returned to jedda on the 3rd November from his investigations at the Mahd gold-mine and at Taif and left for the Lnited Kingdom on the 11 th November. 392. Yusuf Tuimetoff, formerly a clerk in the Soviet consulate in Jedda and now Soviet trade representative m the Yemen, arrived from Hudaida by dhow about the 31st October (see Aden Intelligence Report No 507 paragraph 6064), having taken five days on the way. He staved a few days with his former chief, the present Soviet Minister in Jedda, and then left for Russia on leave. 393. Dottore Salvatore Aponte, an Italian journalist representing the Corriere della Sera, arrived on the 29th November—from Aden, it is believed. At the end of the month he was expecting to visit the Sudan for “ touristic ” and professional purposes. 394 The interest with which Ibn Saud follows foreign news on the wireless is well known. According to his wireless operator, the travelling wireless set presented to him by Sir Andrew Ryan at Riyadh is his great hobby. The same informant states that Ibn Saud now listens in to songs by Egyptian women but can’t abide the male singers. 395. The customs authorities have been more reasonable in the examination of pilgrims luggage than they were last month (paragraph 354 ). As a result, apparently, of the complaints that were lodged, the Saudi authorities issued what seems to be a very reasonable interpretation of the customs provisions relating to the importation of food and clothing by pilgrims. 396. Mr. Maxwell Darling (paragraph 108) hopes to continue his researches regarding the desert locust by visiting Hofuf and the Dawasir next sprint and the assistance of the Saudi Government, which was afforded generously this year has again been requested. J ’ 397. The Saudi Government can have found little satisfaction in the re p?P tl0 : n accorded by the Egyptian Quarantine Board to the communication which the Saudi Government sent to the International Sanitary Office in Paris in January last, setting forth its objections to the articles of the Paris conven tion in respect of which it had formulated reserves as being unnecessary a hindrance to pilgrims, harmful to the economic interests of Saudi Arabia 'and unwarrantable interference in Islamic religious affairs, and so on. On only one point does the board’s decision make a concession to the Saudi thesis, viz, in stating that the presence of a delegate from the Saudi Government on the board would be useful. Ihe board agree politely that the Saudi Government have made7 great efforts to improve the hygienic conditions of the country, but refuse to admit that the results justify the claims advanced in the Saudi note. Two comments made by the board may he quoted here :— Malgr£ son adhesion a 1’Arrangement de Rome, le vaste Royaume aiabe seoudien, qui s etend du golfe Persique a la mer Rouge, reste, au point de vue samtaire, un pays ferm 6 .” s l Jlve s mentioned in paragraph 363 as having been on hand at the ime 01 the issue of the Saudi Slavery Regulation under the exchange of notes i^ ve ij 0im .

According to information received, there is at Taif, living in slavery, an 11 -year-old boy named Khumais, who is alleged to be the son of one of the eading merchants of Dhubai and to have been stolen and sold for 400 rupees to the Director of Wireless Operators at Riyadh.

Ibn Saud, who was reported last month to be slightly indisposed, is now restored to health, and at the end of the month Sheikh Yusuf Yasin stated that the King was away from Riyadh and engaged in the hunting expeditions which normally occupy most of his time at this season of the year. Almost at the same moment the Umm-al-Qura announced that His Majesty had left Riyadh on the 30th September “ to inspect the affairs of his subjects ” in the north. The Amir Saud is staying in Riyadh, where he is being joined by the Amir Feisal. 294. The Amir Feisal came down from Taif to Jedda on the 21st September and left again the following night. The main purpose was to receive on behalf of Ibn Saud the letters of credence of Sir Reader Bullard, the new British Minister, and of Hamdi Bey Sadr-al-Din. the new Iraqi Charge d’Affaires, who had arrived on the 6 th September. On the 22 nd he gave a dinner to celebrate the arrival of His Majesty’s Minister. In deference to the court mourning it was confined, like the farewell dinner to Sir Andrew Ryan, to members of the British Legation and a few Saudi officials and notables. The moment it was over the Amir made for the hills, whither his British guests who, after a heavy meal on a sticky evening, had become “ dem’d damp, unpleasant bodies,” would have been glad to follow him. 295. In the absence of Fuad Bey Hamza abroad and of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at Riyadh, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Taif showed no activity. On the last day of the month, however. Sheikh Yusuf came down from Taif, where he had just arrived from Riyadh, to suggest a programme for the publication of the proposed Saudi Slavery Regulation and for the exchange of notes with His Majesty’s Legation regarding the Treaty of Jedda. At the end of the month it was understood that Fuad Hamza had reached Egypt via Syria, and was kicking his heels there awaiting the return of Nahas Pasha from Europe on the 12 th October, presumably to confer over the Palestinian situation. 296. (Reference paragraph 204 of report for June.) Muhammad Id- Rawwaf, the Deputy Kaimakam of Jedda, returned from leave in Syria on the 20 th September. 297. Aerial activity has been more restricted during September, one machine only being used for morning exercises, and that irregularly, but the Amir Feisal. during his brief visit to Jedda of the 21st-22nd September, was present at the2 inauguration of the aerodrome and ££ Arabian School of Aviation.” as it is called, at Kandara (see paragraph 266 of the report for last month). I he new landing ground has not yet come into use, however. 298. The appointment is reported of Aziz Bey as Commandant of the Mecca garrison, in place of Tahsin Bey. He is an Iraqi, who played a role here in Shereefian days, hut early turned his coat on the Wahabi invasion of the Hejaz. His predecessor in this post. Tahsin Bey, by origin a Turk, has, it is stated, been given the position of principal secretary to the Deputy Minister for Defence, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. 299. It appears that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have not yet found the water without which the gold discovered at Mahd-ad-Dhahab might as well be so much sand. The Swedish geophysicist hold out no hope of their finding water within an economic radius of the ore. The water-diviner, however, declared that water was to be found at a spot within that radius, and the company are apparently prepared to drill there. But the diviner left, refusing to go to Wejh to repeat his experiments there, but whether he was unwilling to stay until his assertion has been put to the test, or whether he was merely scared at the death of Lieutenant Thomas from heat stroke in the car in which they were travelling together to the mine, is not known. The syndicate have now established their own landing grounds (their only aeroplane is ait present, it will be recollected, based on Wejh), at Jedda, Mahd-ad-Dhahab, Wejh. Yanbu, Dhiba and Taif. 300. The Jedda manager of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in Hasa states that the company have recently made a loan to the Saudi Arabian Government. He did not mention the amount. It is supposed that the sum is part of the advance of £50.000 that is due to the Government upon discovery of oil in commercial quantities, and that, although the output attained does not yet fall within the definition of “commercial quantities” laid down in the concession, the company’s confidence in the future of the Hasa wells justifies their being more generous than the letter of the concession requires. I he manager also states that an advance has been made to the Saudi Government by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, and gives it as his opinion that with these two advances and the sum paid by Petroleum Concessions (Limited) for the oil rights in Western Arabia, the Government should have a gold reserve sufficient to maintain the Saudi rival at its par rate of 20 to the gold pound. This may be true, but it is difficult to believe that orthodox economics have made such headway in this country that a large sum in gold would be kept for the sole purpose of maintaining the value of the local currency. It is useless to talk Bagehot to, for instance, royal wives who spurn Fords and insist on Buicks. 301. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin spoke to His Majesty’s Minister with satisfaction about the quality of the oil now being extracted in Hasa, which he said was very much higher than that of the Bahrein oil. He added that the Saudi Government had not yet granted a concession for what was probably the richest oil area, the Wadi Sirhan. This is a surprising statement, as hitherto the Wadi Sirhan has not been mentioned as a possible oil-field. 302. The manager of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company had a visitor for several days, viz., an American named Pinckard, who represents the Texas oil interests, and is said to be their marketing manager for China. The object of the visit is believed to be to fill in the details of an arrangement already concluded, by which Mr. Pinckard’s firm will market the oil extracted by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in Hasa and possibly in Bahrein too. It is suspected that Mr. Pinckard has his eye on the Sudan and Egyptian markets. 303. According to a report, which seems to have some foundation, a considerable number of policemen took advantage of the presence of the Amir Feisal in Jedda to demand an interview, so that they might request payment of the heavy arrears of wages owing to them. It is reported that the authorities, fearing that some violent demonstration might be made against the Amir, brought other police down from Mecca, who. when the malcontents had been disarmed by a trick, escorted them, in their underclothes and bareheaded, up to Mecca, where they have been put in prison. 304. Some two or three years ago a tax on merchants and shopkeepers was imposed, the maximum being £2 gold per annum and the minimum ££ gold. It seems that there was much opposition to this tax on the score of unfair grading, and that many persons withheld payment pending an appeal to the King. Orders have now been issued that the tax is to be collected, with all arrears due.[856 b—3] B 2 II .—F rontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 305. The situation in Palestine continued to absorb the attention of the politically-minded, but real interest is limited to a relatively small circle in the Hejaz. Both Meccan newspapers have maintained complete discretion on the subject during the month, and this may be taken as an index to the Royal policy. s Mr. Calvert, on the 8 th September, under instructions, communicated unofficially to Amir Feisal, His Majesty’s Government’s communique issued to the press in England on that date. 306. I he new Iraqi Charge d'Affaires, Hamdi Bey Sadr-al-Din, to whom a reference is made at paragraph 294. arrived on the 8 th September. Ill -—Relations with Powers outside A rabia. 307. Sir Reader Bullard arrived in H.M.S. Londonderry on the 14th September to take up his duties as His Majesty’s Minister in succession to Sir Andrew Ryan. He presented his credentials to the Amir Feisal on the 21 st September. 308. ^ No matters of importance came up for discussion between His Majesty s Legation and the Minister for Foreign Affairs until the last day of the month, when Sheikh \usuf Yasin came to Jedda from Riyadh and proposed that the Saudi Slavery Regulation should be published in the Umm-al-Qura on Friday, the 2 nd October, and that the exchange of notes regarding the Treaty of Jedda should be effected as soon after as possible. It may be mentioned here, in anticipation of the October report, that the programme proposed was adopted and that the notes were exchanged on the 3 rd October. 309. The Saudi Government intend to be represented at the coronation of His Majesty King Edward VIII by a high personage, but before deciding whom to designate, they propose to find out what sort of delegations are to be sent by “ other Arab States,” e.g.. Egypt and Iraq. 310. The Imperial Airways air-liner Horsa, referred to at paragraph 283 of the last report, was successfully repaired and returned to Bahrein on the 12th September. Notice of the forced landing had been sent to the Saudi authorities, but it could be argued that this was not necessary, since the region where the Horsa landed, viz., 40 miles due south of Salwa Wells, lies outside°the territory admitted by His Majesty’s Government as belonging indisputably to Saudi Arabia and in an area which has for some time been a subject of discussion between the two Governments. 311 Another case of forced landing occurred in the Persian Gulf when two R.A.F. machines were obliged to make an emergency landing on the 29th September on the Hasa coast, near Ras-al-Khanliya (or Khaliya). about 60 miles north-west of Bahrein. The aircraft were able to take off again a little more than one hour later, after the necessary repairs had been effected. The customarv official note expressing regret was addressed to the Saudi Arab Government. 312. An article appeared in the local press expressing satisfaction at the conclusion of the Franco-Syrian Treaty as another step on the road to the indepen dence of Arab territories and eventual Arab union. The article appeared in the Saut-id-Hejaz, which official pretence alleges to be unofficial, and it was signed by a name of no importance, but like everything else that is published in the local press it can be taken as the official view. No reference is made in the article to the Palestine problem, which the Saudi newspapers have consistently ignored except to the extent of publishing lists of sums collected for sufferers in Palestine. Indeed, His Majesty's Government even come in for a compliment, for having granted the Egyptians more favourable terms than the French have granted to the Syrians. But the article is of general application and the Arab reader will naturally ask why what is good for Egypt and Syria and Iraq should not be good for Palestine. 313. M. Persico, the Italian Minister, left suddenly for Eritrea on the 30th August, without informing his colleagues. He returned on the 18th September. He told His Majesty’s Minister that he had had an interesting motor-car trip of some 400 miles with the Governor of Eritrea, from Asmara into Ethiopia. He stated that the Moslems looked contented, but the Coptic priests sulky. The sulks he attributed to loss of income due to recent events, but his vice- consul, M. Bellini, hastened to explain that the Italian authorities would sub-4 sidise the Coptic priesthood in the same way as the Roman Catholic Church. M. Persico said, with a leer, that the local women were mad on the “ white troops, who, he implied, put up the feeblest resistance. This was sad hearing for a foreigner who had read of the Duce s assurance that miscegenation in Ethiopia would not be allowed. 314. Early in September the Italian Legation distributed broadcast in Jedda copies of two Arabic newspapers, the Band Barqa of Benghazi and the Al Adi of Tripoli. These contained, for the most part, news of Italian progress in Ethiopia, where the Arabic language was to be employed at Harrar in the law courts, and illustrations of Islamic institutions in Italian North Africa. 315. Italian shipping in the Red Sea, as far as it can be observed from Jedda, remains much the same as usual. A shipping agent here recently expressed the view that during the past six months, there had been, if anything, a falling off in numbers of Italian ships calling at Jedda, 316. The treaty of commerce between Italy and the Yemen, which was signed on the 2 nd September, 1928, has been extended, but only for eleven months.' 317. On the 4th September the T J mm-al-Qura published an official com munique announcing the appointment of Sheikh Fauzan-as-Sabiq as Saudi Arab Charge d’Affaires “ to the court of His Majesty the King of Egypt,” and consul- general in Cairo, to date from the 25th August, 1936. IV.— Miscellaneous. 318. H.M.S. Londonderry, which arrived with His Majesty’s Minister on the 14th September, left for Malta on the 18th September. ? b -i ect ^ be j°u rn ey from the Hejaz to the Hadhramaut, which Mr. Philby has just performed, is still obscure. All that the Jedda manager of his hrm seems to know is that Mr. Philby proposed to return via Najran, when he has received the motor spares for which he is waiting at Mukalla. 320. Saudi hostility to the International Quarantine Board and to its sanitary control of pilgrims, to which reference was made in paragraph 230 of the June report, was again voiced in an article in the l mm-al-Qura, which claimed as an all) the Egyptian newspaper Al Balagh. The T 1 mm-al-Qura alleged that a reply made to a question in the Chamber of Deputies by the Egyptian Minister of the Interior was based on false information supplied by the administration of the Quarantine Board. 321. Motor transport for pilgrims is to receive its annual reinforcement, Messrs. Sharqieh (Limited) have imported this month 150 Ford vehicles, mainly trucks, but including a number of de luxe touring cars. It is to be hoped that pilgrim transport this year will be more adequate and less disreputable. 322. The prohibition of the carrying of passengers in private cars has been published again, in the Saut-ul-Hejaz of the 1 st September. 323. The devaluation of the French and Netherlands currencies came as an unpleasant shock to the Saudi authorities as likely to diminish the number of pilgrims from North Africa and the Dutch East Indies. The pilgrims from funis, Morocco and Algiers are never very numerous, but some 7,000 Javanese were expected to make the pilgrimage this time, and if the purchasing power of their money is to be reduced, as against charges and prices in the Hejaz, which are based on gold, by perhaps a quarter or a third, some may be unable to come and those who do come will have less to spend. 324. The Saudi press announce the creation of a Pilgrimage Propaganda Bureau at Mecca. Its activities are to be superintended by a council, under the presidency of the Minister of Finance. 325. The Saudi authorities were greatly disturbed during the last pilgrimage by the large number of destitute Indians who landed on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf with the intention of making the Hajj. They are a little relieved to learn that the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Muscat authorities have devised means for preventing the departure of such persons from Gwadur this year, and for watching the Batinah Coast, which is the objective of most of the destitute pilgrims, to prevent the landing of such persons in Muscat territory. 326. The discovery is announced of a spring of water at Umm Salem on the Jedda-Mecca road. Much appears to be expected of this, and there is talk of leading the water via the Wazirieh conduits to Jedda, but on the face of it this project does not seem promising.5 327. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the Legation during September was as follows : — On hand at the beginning of the month : 3 males and 4 females. Took refuge in September : Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : 1 female. Locally manumitted : Nil. Left voluntarily : 2 males. On hand at the end of the month : 1 male and 2 females. 328. The two slaves to whom reference was made last month in para graph 292, solved what might have been a difficult question by disappearing from the Legation. As they had first persuaded the doorkeeper to absent himself to buy them something in the bazaar, it is clear that their disappearance was not only voluntary, but premeditated.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

The Amir Feisal, who was visited at Taif by the Amir of Jauf, Abdul Aziz-al-Sdayri, at the beginning of October, left for Riyadh soon afterwards. 330. Sheikh Fuad Hamza is still abroad. He is believed to be in Egypt, where he is perhaps watching the Palestine situation. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin left for Mecca and thence for Riyadh as soon as the exchange of notes regarding the Treaty of Jedda had been effected and the date for a simultaneous communique by the British and Saudi Governments had been fixed. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman was authorised to sign documents on behalf of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but in a few days he also left for Riyadh, and, it is believed, for a tour of inspection to Hasa, and the authority to sign was conferred on his brother Sheikh Hamad Suleiman. 331. Various scraps of news tend to show that the Saudi treasury is not too full. The consolidated pilgrim tax is slightly higher this year than last The police, who demanded the arrears of wages (paragraph 303), are said to have been imprisoned in Mecca and severely beaten. One of the quarantine doctors at Jedda complained to a European that his pay had been reduced from £37i gold a month to £20 gold, and his chief’s from £50 gold to £25 gold. A “ medical aid ' stamp of J piastre now has to be affixed to all letters and documents in addition to the postage and revenue stamps. The 150 cars and lorries imported by Sharqieh (Limited) this year are all that the Ford Company would give credit for. The Saudi Government wanted 200 , but the number was cut down to 150. They had to pay something like cash for eighteen additional cars which they needed. The first two batches of pilgrims from the Far East have been subjected to a customs examination of unprecedented rigour, conducted by the Director of Customs in person, and duty has been charged on articles and small quantities of food such as had hitherto escaped assessment, 332. A rumour that a Registration Department is to be set up in Mecca and is to make a census of the male population has inevitably led to the general belief that conscription will follow. At present the small' regular forces are employed in the towns upon what are little more than police duties, and it is unlikely, even if Ibn Saud could afford to maintain a considerable regular army, that it could ever take the place of the tribal levies which won victories for him against Hamid-bin-Rifada and Feisal-ad-Dawish and the Imam of the Yemen. 333. The “ Arab Saving and Economy Company,” to whose mysterious activities reference was made in paragraph 243, is declared by the Saut-ul-Hejaz to be making suits of clothes at the rate of 90-100 a day and to be employing about sixty workmen. This clothing appears to be part oi a contract for army 8920 [856 aa—1] B2 uniforms which has been secured by Sheikh Muhammad Surur for the company, and this is represented as a victory for local enterprise over a company which was formed by Husain-al-Uwaini (who. by the way, returned to Jedda on the 3rd October), with Fuad Hamza and Yusuf Yasin as shareholders, and obtained a contract for the importation of uniforms and civilian clothing. There is nothing improper by Saudi standards in the participation of officials in^0 company which sells its goods to the State. On the contrary, it appears that Ion Sand has ordered all the leading officials to take shares in the company, which has obtained the concession for the supply of electricity in Jedda. 334. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) has formed a separate company for the exploitation of the Red Sea Oil Concession, under a complicated title, which m said to lie Petroleum Developments (Western Arabia) (Limited). The Jedda ok.cc is being opened by Mr. H. J. Wratislaw (British) and Mr. S. Mudaris (Syrian), who arrived on the 25th October. They are wondering how they are to staff the office with Saudi employees, for the terms of the concession forbid the company to bring in a foreigner for any post which can be filled by a Saudi. However, they interpret the clause as meaning that they are free to look outside the country for employees if they try local candidates and find them unsuitable. It may he mentioned that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have a similar clause in their concession, and find it exceedingly onerous in operation. 335. A committee for the improvement of roads in the Hejaz has been formed and has opened an office in Mecca. A road tax is being levied on pilgrims this year. It is incorporated in the consolidated pilgrim tax. 336. It is said that two of the three aeroplanes which were presented to the baudi Government by the Italian Government have been slightly damaged Certainly not more than one has been seen in the air at one time for some weeks I he three Italians who accompanied them are still here. 337. A fire in Jedda harbour, which consumed a dhow and 300 cases of kerosene and which the authorities tried vainly to extinguish with the aid of two or three extinguishers borrowed from European houses, has led to the issue ot a municipal order prohibiting the storage even of small quantities of kerosene or petrol on private premises; all stocks must be kept at the municipal store So tar the regulation has not appeared in the press, but has onlv been made known through the town crier. SSS. The Saut-ul-Hejaz of the 27th October publishes a leading article which perhaps foreshadows legislation on the subject, protesting against the hindrance to marriage and the consequent “ anarchy in morals ” resulting from following the ancient custom whereby excessive sums are demanded as dowries and unnecessarily large expenditure is incurred on marriage ceremonies and entertainments I he article says that such expenditure is beyond the reach of the youth of to-day, and asks that a law be passed to obviate these evils. II- h i ontiev Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. th. The calli ^-° ff the disorders and the strike in Palestine unmuzzled the attmks P iT\°V he Suh ^f- , lhe ^ tldes were mild enough, compared with the attacks in Arab papers elsewhere, but, m that they appeared in newsDaoers which are closely controlled bv Ibn Sand, they were noFwithout signSce the Saut-ul-Hejaz printed a violent telegram from the Palestine Arabs calling f r\n da y of , lnte '; ces fon on their behalf, and promising to shed the last droS of their blood in the defence of the A 1 Aqsa Mosque. Its comments were ouiet hut with a definite pan-Arab tinge, and ended with the statement that all Arab countries were united as to their grievances and their desiderata. The Umm-al- Qura neutralised the pan-Arab tinge of its leading article to some extend by inserting a vaguely-worded but quite definite dig at hfuri Pasha for having rushed m and apparently accomplished nothing. &amp; 340. It is understood that the Iranian protest to the Saudi Arab Oovern m rArY he B /Yy n A g reement (paragraph 218) has drawn forth a reply to which His Majesty s Government, who were consulted beforehand saw no reason to object, stating that the Saudi Arab Government have no knowledge of'anv Iraman rights m Bahrein, and saying that, on the contrary Bahrein used to belong to the ancestors of Ibn Sand, but that the Saudi Arab' Government ha!e PrincipaUty. Sheikh ** Amir of the Bahrein3 HI- Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 341. As was reported last month, in paragraph 308, the Saudi Slavery . guiation was published on the 2nd October. A translation of the regulation _ ls a ^ a . ed to this report. It will be a long time before one can safely draw f 10 - abo ut the effect of this regulation. The most diverse comments have ^ eI1 heard, from prophecies that slavery will now gradually disappear, to state ments that for the first time for years the former wealthy inhabitants of Mecca aie p nil sing Jbn Saud as having at last done something for them by sending up the value of their slaves. ' 342. Sheikh usuf Yasin was intensely anxious to publish the news about e signature of the agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and even to P u j ear P® s t possible moment. The inference drawn was that Ibn Saud felt that the limelight had been diverted from him by the Syrian and Egyptian Treaties and by Nuri Pasha’s activities in Palestine,' and wanted to bring ^ back by showing what a favourable agreement he could wrest from His Majesty s Government. Out of deference to the practice of His Majesty’s Government whereby treaties are not published in full until laid before Parlia ment, the Umm-al-Qura published only a summary of the agreement, though it might almost have published the full text, since the summary mentioned all the provisions, viz., the extension ” of the Treaty of Jedda. the manner in which pilgrims effects are to be dealt with, the recognition of the Arabic text of the treaty as of equal value with the English, the reservation of rights on both sides t?• re ?/? r - ^°,^ ( l aba an d Ma an, the renunciation of the right of manumission by His Majesty s Government, and the conditions governing the purchase of arms m Great Britain by the Saudi Arab Government. A leading article in the same number of the l 1 mm-al-Qura took pains to point out that there w r as no more in the relations of 8 &gt;audi Arabia with His Majesty's Government than with any other State, and congratulated the Government on the policy which it had adopted “ in the interest of Islam in general and of the Arabs in particular.” 343. His Majesty’s Minister has received a private letter from Sheikh Yusuf i asm saying that Ibn Saud is thinking of sending missions of young Saudis abroad to study aviation, and asking him to ascertain whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to receive and assist such missions, and, if so what help could be given and what would be the terms and the expense. Some ten to fifteen students would be sent every year, for training in civil and/or military aviation. His Majesty’s Minister, who does not believe that any good could come o such a pioject, ha.s sent an interim reply which, while as sympathetic as possible, lemmas sheikh Yusuf Yasin that His Majesty's Government are at present, so fully occupied with the reorganisation and expansion of the Royal Air Force that they may be unable to grant the facilities without which the result coulu not be satisfactory to either party. Of all the reasons which may have prompted this request the most probable seems to be that the Italians are offering to train more Saudi “eagles” (doubtless without charge), and to deliver the other three aeroplanes, that the Saudi Government, from fear of Italy and pleasuie at getting something for nothing, are disposed to accept, and that to lorestall any criticism on our part they have made a proposal which if accepted b y B-is Majesty s Government at all, could only be accepted on financial terms which Ibn Saud could reasonably say were too heavy for his purse. 344. The Italian Legation continues to distribute regularly copies of Arabic newspapers from Italian North Africa which are full of their propaganda To the Band Barca and the Adi, which have been familiar here for some time has i )een acb * e( ^ f be R a &lt;lib-al-'Atid of Benghazi, which in its issue of the 10 th September prints an anti-British article in the usual vein. The hypocritical British, while pretending to defend the poor Abyssinians against Italy, are Topping hie on the heads of Indians, killing poor people in Palestine, and under mining Arab freedom in the “nine districts of the Yemen ” (an allusion to the rulers within the Aden Protectorate). It goes on to represent the British Empire as terrified by the Italian threat to its communications, and as using Palestine as a pawn in its scheme of imperial defence. 345. On the 20th October the influence of Italian propaganda on the local press was noticed for the first time, when the Saut-J-Hejaz reproduced two items of news from Arabic newspapers distributed by the Italian Legation. One reported the lelease of all who had opposed the Italians in North Africa and [856 aa—1]4 the restoration of their confiscated property, the other reproduced a speecli made at the opening of a new mosque, in which a Qadhi told of the deep affection in which Moslems are held by the Italians. The Saut-ul-Hejaz is a dull rag, and the editor may merely have welcomed fresh material for his scissors and paste; but since the paper is closely controlled, and since the comments on Palestine (see paragraph 339) have been a little stronger than they might have been, is tempted to believe that the Italians are now requiring some return for free aeroplanes and munitions and the training of Saudi “eagles.” 346. M. Adriaanse, the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires, who is now accredited to the Iraq Government also and called at Bagdad, presumably to present his credentials, on his way back from leave, is travelling from Bagdad to Jedda by way of Bahrein, Hasa and Riyadh. By the end of the month he had reached Hasa. It is assumed that he will be received by Ibn Saud in Riyadh. 347. The return from leave of the Turkish Charge d'Affaires, Celal Arat, was expected, but on the 25th October an official from Angora, Muhammad Muhiuddin R. Palsay, appeared without notice in his place. M. Palsay describes himself on his card as “ Representant diplomatique de la Republique turque,” but from the circular announcing his arrival he appears to bear the same title as his predecessor, viz., Charge d’Affaires. He is extremely flowery and effusive in conversation, but appears to be well-meaning. He adduces, as proof of pro- British leanings, the fact that his only son has gone to study electrical engineering in London. 348. Muhammad Ali Ridha, honorary consul for Czechoslovakia, returned from a longish visit to Europe on the 12th October in good time to give a generous if fly-blown tea-party on the national day of the country which he represents. 349. The French Minister, M. Maigret, departed for Syria on leave on 4he 7th October. 350. M. Ilario Marinangeli (paragraph 278, August 1935) is said to have left during the month and to have been replaced by another Italian (civil) engineer whose name, however, has not been reported. IV .—M iacellaneous. 351. The first pilgrim ship of the season was the Blue Funnel steamer Teucer, which arrived on the 19th October from Singapore with pilgrims from Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies. By the end of the month the number of pilgrims landed from British Malaya was 792. Pilgrims who have arrived from or via India number about 254 up to the present. 352. The Jedda quarantine authorities, on the arrival of the first two pilgrim ships of the season from Singapore, asserted that the International Sanitary Convention of 1926 had been infringed in that infants under the age of one had not been included in the computation of pilgrims and that every two children from one to twelve years of age had been counted as one person. The masters and the Jedda agents of the vessels pointed to Singapore legislation as authorising this practice, but the quarantine authorities maintained that the practice was ruled out by article 100 of the convention, which prescribes that the accommodation on pilgrim ships is to be so much per person regardless of age, though in fact it would seem that the penalties laid down in the convention in article 157 are only applicable if masters of pilgrim ships contravene article 113 (1) and bring more pilgrims than are specified in the certificates granted at the ports of embarkation. The Saudi Arab Government are, of course, sensitive about quarantine matters and might enjoy placing a European Government in the pillory for infringing the convention, and the matter is being taken up with the authorities at Singapore and with the Foreign Office. There is reason, however, to connect the objections raised by the quarantine doctors with recent reductions in pay and their failure to receive even the reduced pay on the appointed dates. 353. The Pilgrimage Propaganda Bureau whose creation was announced last month (paragraph 324) has set up in separate premises opposite the Grand Mosque at Mecca. The president is Sheikh Ibrahim Shura, an Egyptian who was formerly Director of Education, and he is said to have several paid assistants or agents. The bureau has just issued a long notice to pilgrim guides, officials, merchants and the general public, telling them how to treat pilgrims. One of its duties is believed to be to invite prominent foreign pilgrims to the bureau and there to instil pro-Saudi propaganda into them as well as propaganda for the5 Haj, and also to invite them to subscribe to various objects represented as benevolent. On the other hand, it appears that the Central tlaj Committee in Mecca is to be improved. Formerly it was composed exclusively of the leading pilgrim guides, but now it is to have representatives of the Advisory Council, the Ministry of Finance and the police among its members, and a member of the Advisory Council is to preside at its meetings. 354. The extraordinarily thorough customs examination referred to in paragraph 331 led to many complaints, particularly by the pilgrims from the Netherlands East tndies, that they had been subjected to unreasonable delay. In the end an arrangement had to be made for one member of each family or party to remain in Jedda to deal with the customs formalities while the rest went on to Mecca. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is said to have promised to remedy the grievances, but in any case it would be impossible to conduct such a rigorous examination at the height of the season, for even with ordinary despatch the congestion in the custom-house is very great. 355. The pilgrim tariff for the coming pilgrimage, which has now been published, differs very little from that of last year (paragraph 275, August 1935). Such changes as there are, are nearly all increases. One of the changes is the imposition of the road tax referred to in paragraph 335 above. 356. Disturbed at their heavy sick-list and the loss of two employees by death, the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have brought out an expert in tropical diseases from the Ross Institute, Brevet Colonel F. Percival Mackie, C.S.I., I.M.S., to advise them. Pie arrived on the 11 th October with Mr. Twitched, who, it had been reported, would not return. He spent about a fortnight in Jedda, partly in a vain search for the anopheles mosquito. He should have greater success a month hence, foi* the anopheles hatches out after the first rains. He was well received by the health authorities, and shown the hospitals and the schools. He examined a considerable number of school children for signs of past malaria and found only about 10 per cent, with enlarged spleens. The doctor of the Italian Legation found about 86 per cent, among the people he examined, and it is assumed that he either restricted his examination to the sick or multiplied his figures by a Fascist coefficient for the production of bigger and better statistics. Colonel Mackie has now left for the Cot-of-Gold mine, and irom there he will go to Taif. He has promised to give the Hejaz authorities the benefit of his researches, but even so the warmth of their welcome is remarkable. It is attributed to the fact that Colonel Mackie is here on behalf of a private firm, and one out of which the Saudi Arab Government hopes to make a large revenue. M. van de Poll, the Islamised Hollander, is said to have resigned from the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. The syndicate’s aeroplane was seen at Jedda twice during the month. It is believed to*be based on Yanbu’ now, instead of Wejh. 357. Ihe Jedda “ winter (it has sometimes been cool enough to sleep under a sheet during this month) was inaugurated by the closing down of the local ice machine until next summer, and confirmed by two or three rains—one of them heavy and all preceded by fierce dust-storms. The cooler months are less welcome than might be expected, as there is much more sickness then than in the summer. 358. Mr. C. G. Hope Gill, His Majesty’s consul at Addis Ababa, called at Jedda on the 19th October on his way home. He stated that in the course of a visit which he paid to the Yemen on his way to Jedda two persons of importance, one of them a Minister of State to the Imam, asked him why there were no broad casts in Arabic from England as there were from Italy. 359. Mr. J. A. Smith, general manager in the Sudan of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), visited Jedda for a few days about the middle of the month and then left for Egypt. 360. Mr. Axler, of the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, in Egypt, (para graph 229), paid another and rather longer visit to Jedda this month. He left on the 25th October, having done little or no business with the Saudi Government. 361. Mr. Daimpre, of General Motors, paid a short visit to Jedda in October. General Motors have such small interests here, owing to the concession held bv Ford s through Sharqieh (Limited), that they rarely send a representative to Jedda, but leave their interests for long periods in the hands of their agents Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited). 362. Reports forwarded from Aden suggest that Mr. Philby did some log rolling for Ibn Saud when he was in the Hadhramaut, but the absence from thet) Hejaz of all the Foreign Affairs officials of any consequence has so far prevented the Legation from taking up the matter in a manner which would suit the circumstances. There is evidence, provided by Mr. Philby’s engineer in Jedda, that archaeology was one object of the journey. It seems that the Amir Saud, during the campaign against the Yemen, came across vestiges of antiquity in Najran, which he brought to Mr. Philby’s notice, and that Mr. Philby sent tj* the British Museum from Naj ran part of a bronze lion which was discovered there. Mr. Philby is now at Najran, on the return journey, and is expected in Jedda at about the middle of November. 363. There is no change in the slave return since last month. The slaves now at the Legation, which consist of a woman and her three children, are owned by two brothers who are somewhere in the Sudan, and whom the Sudan Govern ment are endeavouring to trace, so that they may be called upon to manumit the slaves. The agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia, which was signed on the 3rd October, was concluded subject to the reservation on the part of His Majesty's Government that any slaves on hand at the time of signature would be dealt with under the old manumission procedure. Enclosure 2 . Provisional Translation of Regulations concerning Traffic in Slaves, issued by the Saudi Arab Government in the Umm-al-Qura of October 2, 1936. Part I. ABTICLE 1 .

[E 5932/486/25] September 21, 1936. Section 1. Copy No. Mr. Calvert to Mr. Eden.—(Received September 21 .) (No. 257.) ^ r ’ Jedda, September 1 , 1936. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for August 1936. 2 . Copies have been distributed as for the report for last month. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure. Jedda Report for August 1936. I .—Internal Affairs. 262. Ibn Saud, according to a reliable informant, has been slightly indisposed recently and appears to have been feeling the effects of the heat, which has been unusually trying this year at Riyadh. He has not indulged in his customary hunting expeditions quite so often lately. 263. Amir Feisal visited Jedda on the 14th August from Taif, arriving to find the town stickily enveloped in a heat mist. He remained until shortly after midnight of the following day, when he retreated again to the hills. .He received the French Minister in circumstances described at paragraph 282/below. His \ isit aioused a peifect storm of rumour, connected chiefly with the Italians from whom, it was said, he had come to receive a further consignment of aeroplanes which weie to be brought here in an Italian warship. It is probably true, and is scarcely a matter for great astonishment, that he had certain exchanges with the Italian Minister during his brief stay here. 264. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Taif continued to be run on a caretaker basis. Fuad Hamza, who is abroad, was understood to be taking a cure at Carlsbad and was not expected to return before November. His brother lewfik Hamza, has, however, now returned to this country. Yusuf Yasin has remained with the King at Riyadh all the month. 265. There have been no disturbances of the general security and peace of the country. Such small military forces as are stationed in Jedda have been displaying somewhat more professional activity, and are now certainly more soldierly in dress and show improvement in march discipline. The barracks at Taif are being repaired. 266. The Saudi Air Force reappeared from Taif during the month at the time of the Amir Feisal’s visit to Jedda. Two machines have been in evidence here most mornings since, except for several days after a slight mishap which happened to one of them on landing, when the plane stood firmly but gracefully upon its nose The Saudi pilots are now being trained to make somewhat lono-er flights, and the Saut-ul-Hejaz announced triumphantly on the 25th that “ Arab r: agl fi %^ Mecca ’’—the first time that that sacred air had been so visited. It added that the purchase of machines from abroad was to be expedited Work on the preparation of a new landing-ground near the Kandara villa is in progress so it w °uld appear that there is some truth in the particulars given at paragraph 207 of the report for June. 8 at 267. (Reference paragraph 238.) The second shipment to London of the Saudi currency now being superseded was of 125,000 rivals, consisting of some 1 rival pieces, but mainly of half and quarter riyals. The Government have 8822 [806 x —11X.' mm ■i -r- m 2 shown great caution in introducing the new currency, and local banking circles attribute the comparative stability of the riyal to that caution. One informant expressed the opinion recently that the Saudi Government had now accumulated a satisfactory gold reserve, sufficient to support the riyal at the par rate of 20 to the gold pound, having received loans, &amp;c., from the various concessionary concerns working in this country. I 268. The Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman, was as active as ever. His brother, Hamad Suleyman, returned from leave abroad at the end of the month. A new Director of Finance for Hasa was appointed in the person of Sheikh Abdullah Qadi, whilst the appointment, one of considerable interest, was also announced of Najib Ibrahim Salha, the English-speaking secretary of Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman, to be Director of the newly-formed “ Office of Public Works,” established as part of the Ministry to deal with the growing number of foreign concerns in this country. 269. The preoccupations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) over the discovery of an adequate water supply at the Mahd-ad-Dahab have not been relieved (paragraph 237). Amongst a number of newcomers in the personnel of the syndicate is a Swedish geo-physicist (receiving, it is stated, the gentlemanly salary of £300 a month), and, a more recent arrival, an English water-diviner. The syndicate, therefore, are taking their problem very seriously. They appeal* to be equally concerned for the health of their personnel, for there has been a considerable amount of sickness amongst members of the staff for some months past. It is understood that a Colonel Mackie, of the Ross Institute for Tropical Diseases, is due to arrive here shortly in order to investigate health conditions for European members of the staff at the Mahd and at Wejh. The death of Mr. Ballard in May (paragraph 168) has been followed, at the end of August, by that of an Englishman, Mr. W. I). Thomas, lieutenant, R.N. (retired), who only arrived in Jedda on the 26th as shipwright and head carpenter, and who, it was learned to the general regret, died on the 28th en route for the Mahd, where he was buried. Details are lacking, but it is stated that he died from the effects of the heat. 270. (Reference paragraph 239.) The text of the Red Sea oil concession was published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 7th August. Premises have already been taken in Jedda for Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and a manager is expected to arrive in October. 271. The Jedda office of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company has been reinforced by the arrival on the 9th of Mr. W. Burleigh (American) as assistant to Mr. W. J. Lenahan, whom he is ultimately to replace on Mr. Lenahan’s departure. 272. The Umm-al-Qura of the 14th announced that the Legislative Assembly had now drawn up the Constitution, consisting of 140 articles, of the Saudi Arab Kingdom. This production was to be submitted to high authority (presumably the King) for sanction. 273. The Government announced by an official communique, published on the 7th August, their ratification of the International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture, &amp;c., of Narcotic Drugs, signed at Geneva on the 13th July, 1931. The communique emphasised that the provisions of the convention not only accord with, but indeed fall short of, what is already enjoined on Islamic authorities by the Sharia Law. 274. Other appointments announced are : Sheikh Abdurrahman-bin- Ibrahim-al-Mubarak to be x\mir of Qunfida in the room of Muhammad-bin-Abdul Aziz-bin-Madhi, who has been transferred to Jizan. Talat Wafa to be officer commanding police forces of Asir and Najran. 275. More evidence of attention to education has been noted during the month in the announcement that nine new schools, in different centres in the Hejaz and Nejd, are being established, and that a night school for the teaching of English is to be opened in the spring of 1937, the teacher to come from Bagdad. The Education Department has decided, it is stated, to recruit three teachers in Egypt, one for English and two for mathematics and physics. There is said to be a demand for the teaching of English, probably set up by the requirements of British and American oil and gold companies for English-speaking local personnel, and though the above may be steps taken to cater for it, there have been signs, nevertheless, of a tendency on the part of the Saudi authorities to suppress private teachers of English.276. A variety of improvements reported during the month deserve to be chronicled. A new meat and vegetable market, constructed under the supervision of the Public Health Department, has now been opened in Jedda. Mecca, too, is reorganising the arrangements in force there in regard to the killing of animals and transport of meat. Electricity has ousted kerosene from the streets of Taif. 277. Health, generally, has not been satisfactory, and disturbing reports have been received from Asir of the prevalence of malaria. Doctors were sent from Taif, but it is not known how far they have been successful. Rumour alleges a lack of medicines and that some at least of the doctors have given the task up as a bad job—or through fright. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 278. The Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed a note to the Legation on the 16th August alleging transgression of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier by a Transjordan patrol car on the 5th July last in the Mudawwara area, and lodged an official protest. The matter has been referred to the British authorities concerned. 279. Events in Palestine have not so far occupied much of the attention of the local press (reference paragraph 247). In August there have been fewer references to this subject than ever, and even publication of particulars of subscriptions to the fund for Arab sufferers in Palestine have more or less ceased. Indeed, it is stated that considerable difficulty has been experienced in inducing people here to subscribe, pressure having been brought to bear in some cases. This is scarcely surprising in the Ilejaz, where the large elements in the urban population of Indian, Javanese or African origin take little interest in the cause of Arab nationalism. It is, of course, far different in Northern Hejaz and Nejd, and one is impressed with the description, given in a recent Transjordan Intelligence Report, of the “ passionate interest ” taken in the present situation in Palestine by Arabs in the northern areas of Saudi Arabia. 280. The Saut-ul-Hejaz of the 25th August published a brief paragraph to the effect that the Yemen had adhered to the Saudi-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance (reference paragraph 214). The King of the Yemen, however, is stated to have asked for further explanations both of the Government of Iraq and of Saudi Arabia, so it may be that his adhesion is not yet complete. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 281. Sir Reader W. Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., His Majesty’s Minister, was expected to leave England about the end of August. He is due to arrive at Port Sudan on the 13th September, and is to cross to Jedda by H.M.S. Londonderry, arriving the following day. 282. (Reference paragraph 251.) Sheikh Yusuf Yasin replied from Riyadh by personal letter, suggesting a modification to article 1. of the Koweit draft regulations and accepting the remaining nine as a basis for discussion. He made certain other proposals on the subject of relations with Koweit, which are now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government and other British authorities concerned. 283. On the 29th August the eastward-bound Imperial Airways air liner Horsa forced-landed some 40 miles south of Salwa wells, south of the Dohat-as-Salwa. The machine, with its occupants fortunately unhurt, was located on the 30th, and at the end of the month arrangements were being made for the removal of the passengers and for dealing with the plane, which was slightly damaged. 284. M. Maigret on the 14th August presented fresh letters of credence to the Amir Feisal, in his capacity as Viceroy of the Hejaz, this time as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. It was only as recently as the 25th February last that he presented his letters of credence to King Abdul-Aziz as Minister Resident. He is now alone in his Legation, as his Algerian vice-consul proceeded on leave during the month. 285. The Italian Minister remains to share the summer heat with the rest of us. He was joined by Comm. L. F. Bellini, his vice-consul, who returned from leave on the 9th. Reference has already been made to the spate of rumour aroused by the visit of Amir Feisal to Jedda, according to which a high Italian4 personage was to come here on an Italian warship to present Italian three engined aeroplanes to an allegedly Italophil Amir. Jedda, however, waited in vain, and local pot-house politicians are believed to be nonplussed by the grant of the Red Sea oil concession to a British company, when Italian interests were only too eager to compete, at least for the Farsan Islands, and at a time when the Italo-Saudi relations are apparently so cordial. IV.— Miscellaneous. 287. (Reference paragraph 254.) The French warship D'Iberville arrived on the 5th August and embarked the body of M. Biraud, leaving for Suez the same day. 288. Mr. H. M. Eyres went on leave on the 5th August to the United Kingdom. 289. (Reference paragraph 259.) The name of the Turk who arrived here last month from Ethiopia has been given as Ahmad Sayam-bin-Muhammad Kemal-ud-Din. 290. (Reference paragraph 196.) Mr. Philby has been reported from Aden as having entered the Hadhramaut via Najran with a party of about thirty men and at the end of the month to be at Mukalla. 291. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the Legation during August was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Three males, four females. Took refuge in August: One male. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. Left voluntarily : One male. On hand at the end of the month : Three males, four females. 292. Two cases on hand are those of slaves against whom the Saudi authorities have preferred accusations of robbery of money and property belonging to the ex-owners. The Saudis have demanded delivery of the two slaves for trial, but the Legation, dissatisfied with the bona fades of the charges preferred, has refused. No solution of the difficulty has yet been reached.1 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 5365/486/25] August 25, 1936. Section 1. Copy No. Mr. Calvert to Mr. Eden.—(Received August 25.) (No. 229. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, August 1, 1936. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda Report for July 1936. 2 . Copies have been distributed as in the list in paragraph 41 of the report for January, with the exception that the Commander-in-chief, East Indies Station, has now been omitted from the distribution list at his request. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure. Jedda Report for July 1936. I .—Internal Affairs. 232. July was a comparatively uneventful month. The King and Amir Saud remained at Riyadh; Amir Feisal as usual at Taif. 233. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance were actively engaged during the first part of the month in negotiating at Taif the Red Sea oil concession with representatives of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) (vide paragraph 239), shortly after the conclusion of which Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was at last able to leave Jedda for Riyadh. Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman remains here, however, and will be available for the transaction of business on more important questions with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. 234. The internal situation was one of unbroken tranquillity, as far as was known in Jedda. The Saudi Minister in London early in July informed the Foreign Office, in the course of conversations regarding present events in Palestine (paragraph 247 below), that Ibn Saud had received reports that certain tribal elements in Saudi Arabia (it was not stated which) were threatening to take action and demonstrate on behalf of the Arabs in Palestine. Nothing was heard in Jedda of any such tendency, in respect of which, it was added by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, Ibn Saud had issued orders to local Governors that any further developments were to be suppressed. 235. (Reference paragraph 206.) No announcement has yet been made here concerning the new Amir of Tebuk, but Major Glubb, in a recent intelligence report, stated that the name of the new official had been given as Saud-bin-Sad-al- Hedhlul. 236. There is little to report concerning the embryo Saudi air force. Early ihorning training proceeded daily until about the 18th, when it was stated the centre of activity had been transferred to 1 aif. This is, of course, in accordance with the practice of the past year or two. Further subscriptions for the purchase of machines to bear the names of the four principal towns of the kingdom were announced in the press from time to time during the month. 237. I he work of the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate continues to progress. It is understood that one of the main preoccupations of the moment concerns the effort to find an adequate water supply at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab to enable operations to go forward. Water has not yet been tapped in any quantity, and boring has not gone beyond 100 feet, whilst the syndicate are prepared to drill to 2,000 feet for, to quote an official of the syndicate, “ no water, no mine.” It is of interest to mention that the same official related that as the American drillers and machinery had not proved altogether satisfactory, two British drillers had been sent out and had already been able to improve considerably on the efforts of [781 bb— 1 ]2 the Americans. British machinery is now also being installed, 'there have been a number of new arrivals, but as some of these pass through Jedda for the mine without stopping, it is difficult to keep check on all the syndicate’s personnel. 238. It was reported towards the end of the month that 250,000 rials, entirely half and quarter pieces to a value of £13,000, of the old currency now being superseded, had been shipped to London via Suez on or about the 26th. A similar amount is expected to be shipped by the next Khedivial ship. 239. As related at paragraph 210 of last month’s report, negotiations over the Red Sea oil concession took place at Taif. They lasted until the 10th July, when the Umm-al-Qura announced the successful conclusion of the discussions and the negotiators returned to Jedda. The concession is for the whole of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia to a depth of 100 kilom., and includes the Farsan and other islands and territorial waters, but excludes the area between Rabigh and Lith (very possibly in deference to Islamic sensitiveness over foreign penetration into the Holy Land). Mr. Longrigg, who. with M. Mudarris, left Jedda on the 12th July, anticipated that Petroleum Concessions (Limited) would open an office in Jedda later in the year. M. Biraud, who is now thought to have been the only French oil representative here since no other Frenchman has come to light, was seriously ill at Taif and, in consequence, took no part in the negotiations. He died suddenly two or three days after his return to Jedda (paragraph 254 below). The Saudi Government made a further announcement respecting the concession by publishing in the Umm-al-Qura of the 31st July the Royal decree confirming the result of the negotiations at Taif, and ratifying the agreement, which was to come into force from the date of the publication of the decree. 240. (Reference paragraph 212 .) The Saudi Government replied to the Legation’s enquiry concerning the surtax of 6 centimes on all telegrams that it had been imposed under the terms of article 30 of the Madrid Convention of 1932, and that it had been in force since the 13th February, 1936. It is typical of Saudi administrative methods that no public announcement should have been made on the introduction of this surtax. 241. (Reference paragraph 230 of last report.) It now appears that on the 27th January last the Saudi Government addressed the French Government, through the French Legation here, a note in which they declare their readiness to ratify the International Sanitary Convention of 1926, of which Saudi Arabia is already a signatory, if other Governments concerned would agree to this being done on the basis of numerous reserves (vide paragraph 245 of the report for October 1934). The matter is now being studied by the Governments concerned. Meanwhile, the Umm-al-Qura of the 31st July announces that Dr. Mahmoud Hamdi Hamouda, the Saudi Director-General of Public Health, has left for Europe to attend, as usual, the October meeting of the International Health Office at Paris. 242. Among other movements of officials reported were the departure of Sheikh Hamad as Suleyman of the Ministry of Finance and brother of the Minister of that department, for Egypt, and of Sheikh Khalid Abdul Walid and Sherif Muhammad Sharaf Ridha for Riyadh, of whom the former was one of the Saudi negotiators at Taif over the Red Sea oil concession. 243. There have been sundry announcements during the month concerning the “ piastre ” scheme, initiated last year, but which appears now to have been put on a new basis, also of an even more ambiguous project entitled “ The Arab Saving and Economy Company,” whose objects are successfully concealed in imposing statutes consisting of forty-four articles. 244. Education has received some attention this month. The press announced, inter alia, that the Department of Education had decided to establish a school for the preparation of students who were to proceed to Egypt on special courses of study. The appointment of Sheikh Abdul Hamid Hadidi as inspector of schools was published, and the establishment of a semi-educational institution in the form of a “ club for gymnastics ” was also an item briefly recorded. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 245. On the 1 st July the Saudi Arab Government informed the Legation that the Amir of Tebuk had reported that on the 24th June, at 7 a.m., two aeroplanes from Transjordan flew over Saudi territory in the neighbourhood of Alqan. The note made an official protest and asked for an investigation and3 punishment of those guilty of the trespass. The Government of Transjordan in due course replied that although on the date mentioned two R.A.F. machines flew near the frontier in the Rum area, they were careful not to cross the frontier. The assurance that every precaution is taken to avoid violation of the frontier was renewed, and at the same time attention was called to the ease with which ^.Whe actual position of aircraft flying at a height can be misjudged. 246. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin informed Mr. Calvert on the 11 th July of his desire to return to Riyadh as early as possible, and in the same breath mentioned the forthcoming visit of Seyyid Nuri-as-Said to Riyadh for the purpose of exchanging ratifications of the Saudi-Iraqi Treaty and his (Sheikh Yusuf’s) desire to be present. It was assumed from this that Nuri would be visiting Riyadh very shortly, but it was later gathered from Bagdad that the visit will not take place until October or November next. 247. Events in Palestine have been given considerably more attention by the Saudi authorities since reference was made to this subject at paragraph 216 of the last report. Ibn Saud instructed his Minister in London to approach His Majesty’s Government with the suggestion that, if agreeable to them, he would take the initiative in concerting action with the rulers of Iraq and the Yemen to urge on the Arabs of Palestine the advisability of the cession of disturbances. Later this was extended to include the ruler of Transjordan. . Sheikh Hafiz Wahba represented Ibn Saud as being inundated with requests from all sides to intervene on behalf of the Arabs of Palestine, and even asserted that the bedouin of Saudi Arabia had threatened to make sympathetic demonstrations (what form these might take is a little difficult to imagine), but these were being sternly held in check. In the event, the Kings of Iraq and the Yemen agreed to co-operahe with His Majesty’s Government, subject to certain conditions concerning the cessation of immigration, which His Majesty’s Government found it difficult to accept. Ibn Saud, less insistent than the others, expressed the hope that immigration would be suspended, but, on receiving the views of His Majesty’s Government, agreed to continue to exercise moderating influence on Arab opinion. 248. Locally, the Mecca press has very largely confined itself to publishing lists of donations and totals subscribed in the several towns of the Hejaz for the relief of Arab sufferers in Palestine. The Saut-al-Hejaz of the 21st July announced that a sum of £E. 500 had been remitted to Palestine for distribution amongst the afflicted. Arabic broadcasts from Jerusalem are now received here in satisfactory condition. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 249. On the 17th July Sheikh Yusuf Yasin telephoned to the Legation to enquire concerning the attempt of the day before on the life of King Edward, and expressed his horror at the outrage. His enquiry was suitably acknowledged by the same means. 250. Mr. Calvert had meetings with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 11 th and 16th July, when a number of subjects were discussed, including the Red Sea oil concession, Transjordan-Nejd frontier, the forthcoming exchange of notes respecting the prolongation of tfle Treaty of Jedda, and two other subjects which will be given separate mention in the following two paragraphs. 251. (Reference paragraph 217.) The Koweit draft regulations were sent to Sheikh Yusuf on the 9th July by personal letter. Upon his return from Taif he took up the question generally with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, expressing the personal opinion that the regulations were satisfactory, but would have to be studied further by the King and his advisers. He appeared to find the absence of any provision for checking smuggling from Koweit via Iraq a matter of difficulty. Mr. Calvert, on the 16th July, informed him that such smuggling was not the concern of the Government of koweit, but added that he understood that the Government of Iraq had instituted for the past year special anti smuggling measures on the Koweit-Iraq frontier. Sheikh Yusuf continued to cast about for other difficulties to raise, but finally agreed to the suggestion that he should first consult Ibn Saud. 252. The second question related to the protest by the Iranian Government against the Bahrein Transit Dues Agreement (paragraph 218). Sheikh YTisuf stated that his Government had received the protest through the Iranian Minister in Egypt (who is also accredited to Ibn Saud), and read over the text to Mr. Calvert. He similarly read out the terms of the Saudi Government’s draft4 reply and asked for observations. Mr. Calvert made certain comments, but further views are being sought from His Majesty’s Government, to whom the matter has been referred. It was interesting to hear so cautious a person as Sheikh Yusuf Yasin express the view, at the close of the conversation, that the Iranian claim to Bahrein was rather a “ joke, 5 ' and confess to being highl y^ amused whenever he heard it advanced. 253. The Saut-al-Hejaz announced on the 14th July that the Egyptian Government had decided to raise their representation here from a consulate to a Legation, and that Abdurrahman Azzam, who is already accredited to Iraq and Iran, was to be Charge d’Affaires in addition to his other capacities. 254. The French Legation are understood to be having some difficulty with the Saudi authorities over the effects of M. Biraud (paragraph 239), which the Saudis wish to examine. It is believed that the Saudis are in possession of the baggage, but that the French have the keys. 255. The Dutch Legation is still in charge of the Javanese vice-consul, who left on an official visit to the Yemen on or about the 9th July. 256. The Italian Charge stated towards the end of the month that he had recently had three or four cases of the repatriation of ex-slayes to Ethiopia. Enquiry elicited the fact that the individuals concerned are Ethiopians enslaved in this country, but freed here by their owners before being repatriated by the Italian Legation. Signor Persico quoted the case of a benevolent old Javanese master, who not only freed his slave, but handed £40 to the Italian Legation to defray the cost of repatriation. Signor Persico declared that whilst the Eritrean authorities made no difficulties over cases of the sort, it was far otherwise with Italians who wished to go to Eritrea. A member of his colony here, who had recently proposed to go to Asmara, was refused permission on the grounds that he had not definite employment to go to in Eritrea with a company who had formally asked for permission for him to enter the country. This stringency is apparently designed to obviate unemployment in Eritrea. IV .—M iscellaneous. 257. After an unsually cool May and June temperatures began to climb, particularly towards the end of July, when, with a southerly wind blowing, minimum night temperatures, for example, reached 87^ degrees. It can now definitely be said that “ Summer is i-cumen in.” 258. The first two ships for the next Haj will leave Singapore, according to the Umm-al-Qura, on the 8 th October and the 2nd November, with Javanese pilgrims. 259. A Turk, said to have come from Ethiopia and there to have been chauffeur to the Negus, arrived on the 26th July in search, it is said, of emplovment. 260. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the Legation during July was as follows :—* On hand at the beginning of the month : 2 males. Took refuge in July : 2 males, 4 females. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. Left voluntarily : 1 male. On hand at the end of the month : 3 males, 4 females. 261. A slave of Abyssinian origin, claiming to have been born at Addis Ababa, took refuge with the Legation. As repatriation in the present circumstances of Ethiopia appeared likely to present difficulties, telegraphic correspondence with Addis Ababa and the Foreign Office took place, but it was eventually unnecessary to come to a decision in this particular case as the man left the Legation premises voluntarily towards the end of the month, whilst the matter was still under consideration.In any further communication on this subject, please inote N ” s and address —not to any person by name, but lo— I “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign (f)tEce, London, S.W. 1 CONFIDENTIAL THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his £t vt compliments to 'f of- and ’ b y di •esents his direction of the Secpbtary ! of State, transmits herewith cop Foreign Office, of the iindeu-iheiitijmed paper. i ' ■ ' 1 ' &lt;' v ’ / 'I I ^ vj ' f J Reference to previous correspondence : AiL m.

Enclosure. Jedda Report for June 1936. I .—Internal Affairs: 201. THE King and the heir apparent remained at Riyadh during the month. Early in the month a curious report was received by the Legation from the Persian Gulf, according to which an attempt on the life of Ibn Saud was made on or about the 22nd May by his nephew Khalid-bin-Muhammad, with one of Khalid's brothers and five accomplices, whilst the King was encamped at Ashaira. No rumour of this reached Jedda, and as the King was reported to have left Ashaira on the 18th May it may fairly safely be dismissed. Khalid appeared to be in favour when Ibn Saud was last in Jedda. 202. Amir Feisal came to Jedda from Taif on the 3rd June, when he received Signor Persico, who presented his credentials as Italian Minister (see paragraph 223), and, later the same morning, Sir Andrew Ryan. The Amir remained in Jedda until the 5th June in order to entertain His Majesty’s Minister to an informal farewell dinner-party and to receive him in farewell audience (see paragraph 219). 203. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in spite of his personal desire to leave for Riyadh after the 14th June, remained on in Jedda by the King’s orders. He had a number of business and other meetings with Sir Andrew Ryan and. later, with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman, as usual, divided his time between Jedda, Mecca and Taif and, together with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, left for Taif on the 28th June in connexion with negotiations for the Red Sea oil concession (see paragraph 210 ). 204. The Deputy Kaimakam of Jedda, Muhammad Id-Rawwaf, left by sea on the 17th for Damascus, where he is to spend three months’ leave Sheikh Ali Taha, as usual, is acting during his absence. 205. One of the more highly-coloured items of gossip retailed in Mecca has centred round Sheikh Muhammad Seroor, the Minister of Finance’s influential assistant. Young Hejazis of Mecca are said to be so dazzled by the wealth and liberality of Seroor, whose hospitality (equalled only by his rapacity) is a byword in the Holy Cities, that hopes are now being nourished in youthful breasts of a Hejaz Republic, under his leadership, severed from a Nejd, which has drained the Holy Land of its wealth. 206. Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd (paragraph 165 of last report) left for his new post on the Transjordan frontier about the 8 th. The new Governor of Kaf is Abdul Kerim-bin-Zeyd. A new Governor of Tebuk would appear to have been appointed in the room of Sheikh Abdullah-as-Sdayri, now Governor of Medina, but no announcement has been made and his name is not yet known. 8740 [756 u—1]2 207. (Reference paragraph 167 of last report.) There has been considerable aerial activity during the month. One of the three Italian instructional planes took the air on the 17th, since when one or two of these machines have flown daily. The new Italian instructor (paragraph 187 of last report), who arrived early in June, is stated to be superintending the further training of the Saudi “ Eagles ” in these small, but handy, machines. On the 24th, the two planes capsized in a strong wind whilst on the ground—little damage could have been done as they were up again the following day. The White Russian air mechanic, Nicola Nadenhofl, and his wife, left Jedda by sea on the 24th on leave. Further subscriptions for the purchase of aeroplanes to be named after the four cities of the country are still coming in, and it has been gathered from a reliable source that an up-to-date aerodrome is to he made at Kandara near Jedda, and that a chain of landing-grounds is to be established between Jedda and Riyadh, the intermediate stations to be one between Taif and Ashaira, others at Muwaih and Dawadmi. 208. (Reference paragraph 168 of last report.) Messrs. Twitched and Laycock arrived from Taif on the 11 th, and left two or three days later by air for Wejh in the syndicate’s plane. From another member of the staff, who had done considerable prospecting in that area, it was understood later in the month that Taif had proved disappointing and would be abandoned. On the other hand, a very promising find had been made near Wejh, where there are traces of ancient workings. Wejh now has a white population, it is stated, of nine. Mr. Twitched left on the 24th for the United Kingdom, not on leave, but, he said, “ to work,” and it is thought in some quarters that he may not return (but that has been thought so often of Mr. Twitched). Mr. Park, American, is now the reigning general manager in this country. The road from Jedda to Mahd-adh-Dhabab is now through, and a useful road-report was recently drawn up by a member of the Legation. 209. A further consignment of new rials, mentioned in paragraph 170 of last report, is believed to have arrived during June. On the 23rd the Saut-ul-Hejaz announced that as from that date the old half- and quarter-rial pieces would be withdrawn, payment being made at the rate of 20 rials to the pound gold, during a period of two months only. 210 . The Red Sea oil concession came in for a good deal of attention during the month. The Frenchmen, M. Biraud and another, were here all the month, but did not appear to be very active. The Societe francaise des Petroles is a member of the Iraq Petroleum Company consortium, and when Mr. S. H. Longrigg (accompanied, as in 1933, by Mr. Mudarris—see report for March 1933, paragraph 34 (c)) arrived on the 24th June to clinch, if possible, on behalf of Petroleum Concessions (Limited), the negotiations already initiated by Mr. Ydlibi and Colonel Ftherton, British and French oil representatives were to work together. They left together for Taif on the 28th, where the negotiations were to take place, with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin professed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires to be eager to come to terms with Petroleum Concessions (Limited). The Italian Minister, about the 22 nd, had requested the Saudi Government to defer the grant of the concession until Italian interests had had time to enter the field, particularlv in regard to a concession for the Farsan Islands, the chief Italian objective. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin asserted that he had tried to head the Italian Minister off, and was, therefore, all the more anxious to come to a successful understanding with Mr. Longrigg as soon as possible. 211. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin informed Mr. Calvert with great satisfaction on the 27th that a message had been received by telephone that No. 2 Welkin Hasa had come into commercial production and was yielding 500 tons a day. 212 . It came to the notice of the Legation that the Saudi Government were to impose a tax of six centimes on all telegrams sent from Saudi Arabia from the 1 st July. As no official announcement of this new tax has been seen, enquiries as to its nature are being made of the Saudi authorities. 213. The names of the shareholders of the £ ‘ Arab Press and Publications Company,” referred to at paragraph 174 of the last report, have now been published and include that of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. A further minor economic project has been given a certain publicity in the National Company for the Construction of Artesian Wells at Medina. It rejoices in regulations of twenty-six articles, but has very doubtful prospects of success.3 II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabid. 214. r lhe Umm-al-Qura of the 19th June contained an article on the Iraqi- Saudi Arab Treaty, the theme of which was that the treaty was entered into spontaneously by the Governments concerned and was neither inspired by nor aimed at any foreign country. It had not been brought about by British influence, as some French and Italian journalists were inclined to suggest, nor was it an Arab alliance with an anti-British bias, as some British commentators appeared to think. A few days before this article appeared, the Saut-ul-Hejaz announced that Seyyid Muhammad-bin-Muhammad Zabara, a Yemeni palace official, had left Sana for Iraq via Aden as the King of the Yemen’s representative to negotiate with the Government of Iraq the adhesion of the Yemen to the Saud-Iraq Treaty. 215. The Iraqi Legation here has been in charge of a subordinate for over a year. No appointment of a Charge d’Affaires has yet been announced, but it is thought that it will not be long deferred. Seyyid Nuri-as-Said may pay a visit to this country later in the summer, possibly on his way back from Europe to Iraq. 216. (Reference paragraph 178.) There has been evidence of greater interest in events in Palestine during the month under review. Whilst the press has refrained from comment on the course of the crisis, a fund has been opened for the relief of Arab victims in Palestine. Amongst the subscribers are Amir, Abdullah Feisal, Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. 217. The Koweit proposals (paragraph 145 of the report for April) arrived at the end of the month. It is hoped to discuss them with the Saudi authorities in the very near future. 218. It is understood that the Iranian Government have formally protested against the agreement with the Saudi Arab Government regarding transit dues, concluded in November 1935 by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Bahrein (see paragraph 17 of report for January). The Saudi press has paid a certain amount of attention to the Sheikh of Bahrein's visit to the United Kingdom. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 219. Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan left Jedda on the 14th June by the sloop H.M.S. Londonderry for Port Sudan. They were given an official send-off at the quarantine quay, where a guard of honour was mounted, and where a numerous gathering included Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, the Deputy Kaimakam, and many other Saudi notables, foreign colleagues and other foreign residents. As has already been mentioned, the Amir Feisal came from Taif on the 3rd and received Sir Andrew, who presented Mr. Judd, the same day. On the 4th His Royal Highness gave an informal dinner-party to Sir Andrew, which was attended only by certain members of the Legation staff and a limited number of Saudi officials and other personages. The Amir quite readily agreed to the informality of the affair in view of Court mourning for King George. On the 5th Amir Feisal again received His Majesty’s Minister, who was accompanied by Mr. Calvert, when Sir Andrew formally took his leave of His Royal Highness. Other and less official entertainments occupied the ten days prior to Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan’s departure, all of an informal character, when expression was given to the great and affectionate regard in which they were held by all their friends and colleagues in Jedda. There was the customary exchange of telegrams between His Majesty’s Minister and the King and Amir Feisal on the actual day of departure. 220. Mr. A. S. Calvert returned from leave on the 3rd and assumed charge of the Legation on the 14th. 221. In the course of business conversations with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin before his departure, Sir Andrew Ryan on the 6 th referred once more to the question of Saudi indebtedness to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, and on the 9 th to that of facilities for British aircraft on the Hasa Coast, concerning which he made a general statement of the conclusions reached by His Majesty’s Government following on the exchange of views with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer. 222. Mr. Calvert had meetings with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 20th, 23rd and 27th, when, inter alia, the Red Sea oil concession question was discussed (seeparagraph 210 ), and various pilgrimage matters of a somewhat contentious nature were mentioned by Sheikh Yusuf. 223. (Reference paragraph 188 of last report.) It has already been mentioned that on the 3rd June the Italian Charge presented his credentials as Minister to Amir Feisal in the King’s absence. Dr. Fea left for Rome on the 17th on leave. It is rumoured in the town that he will be accompanied on his *+ 1 ^ ^ return by an Italian lady doctor and nurses, and that it is intended to establish a resplendent Italian dispensary at Jedda. Other items relating to the Red Sea oil concession and Italian aeroplanes have been already dealt with at paragraphs 210 and 207 respectively. 224. On the 16th June the Saut-ul-Hejaz published a notice by the Italian Legation, in which persons holding Italian bank-notes were requested to deposit them at the Italian Legation before the 10th July. Owners would be credited with the value of the notes, without interest, but would not be able to realise on the amount so deposited, except by the purchase of goods or property in Italy. 225. The Afghan Minister, Muhammad Sadiq-al-Mujaddidi, whose relations with the Saudi Arab Government have not been too happy recently (see paragraphs 192-4 of last report), left for Alexandria on the 24th. He expected to return in October. IV.— Miscellaneous. 226. The sloop H.M.S. Londonderry (Captain H. B. Jacomb, R.N.) arrived on the 11 th and left with Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan on board on the 14th for Port Sudan. 227. The French sloop d'Iberville arrived on the 18th and left on the 22 nd. 228. The Saut-ul-Hejaz of the 9th gave a gratuitous puff to a book by one Amin Said, published in Cairo, entitled The History of the British Domination of Arabia. From the brief review the book would appear to include Egypt and the Sudan in its scope, as well as Iraq. Palestine, Transjordan, the Yemen and the Persian Gulf. This is, we are told, the first volume. 229. The representative in Egypt of the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company. Mr. Axler (see paragraph 70 of report for February 1935), arrived on the 17th. He left again on the 24th June. 230. The Umm-al-Qura came out on the 26th June with a lengthy leading article, headed : “ The Hejaz and Quarantine Stations in Egypt,” addressed to the Egyptian Minister of Health, and attacking the International Quarantine Board and the arrangements made annually in connexion with the Haj. The article was very probably inspired by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, whose antipathy to the board is well known. A similar attack was launched last year after the pilgrimage. 231. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the Legation during June was as follows : — On hand at the beginning of the month : One male. Took refuge in June : Two males. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : One male. On hand at the end of the month : Two males.INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote n ° ^ and address—»o£ to any person'oy navje, but to —• “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to an ^’ by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the'IThder-mepUdhed paper. !■ * » /„j k Foreign Office, 193^ R 1 II 8 Reference to previous correspondence : P Description of Enclosure.

Jedda Report for May 1936. I .—Internal Affairs. 159. Ibn Saud remained in camp at Ashaira (paragraph 120 of the last report) until the 18th May, when he left for Nejd without returning to Mecca. He did little or no hunting from there but may have got some on his leisurely progress to Riyadh, where he did not arrive until the 26th May. His Heir Apparent, who had left about the same time as his father with various other princes, reached Riyadh some days earlier. There was some gossip at the beginning of the month about his marriage with the second Sha'lan girl. He had looked forward to it greatly and had been at pains to provide a worthy house for. her in Mecca, first trying unsuccessfully to get hold of one occupied by the Minister of Finance and then falling back on one belonging to his uncle Muhammad. He was disappointed, however, to find that the lady was ‘ £ an ugly-looking fat woman with green tattooed marks all over her face like those of the Bedouin w T omen,' unlike the sister originally destined for him, who, arriving first, was given to the King and who is described as very beautiful. The Amir, unable to remedy a political marriage by divorce, was said to have taken to loose and lonely ways, displeasing to his father. Whatever the truth of these tales, the Prince slipped off to Mecca on the 1 st May. On the following days he inspected the police head quarters and the barracks, but where he spent his evenings is not stated. 160. The Amir Feisal, now again Viceroy of the Hejaz, seems to have spent most of his time at Ashaira until the King left, when he went a good part of the way with His Majesty. He is now settled at Taif. 161. Ashaira is a very agreeable spot and Ibn Saud had plenty of society there, both male and female. His official preoccupations, however, followed him and the charms of the camp were a little diminished not only by snakes and scorpions but for a short time by rain. On one wet night the King had to assemble all the ladies in the only tent in their separate camp which was weatherproof and to retire himself to the male quarters. 162. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, having installed his family in the new quarters of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Jedda (paragraph 82 of the last report), has spent most of his time here since the 19th April, one of his principal objects being to continue intensively conversations with His Majesty’s Minister, which will be mentioned below. 163. No news of importance has been received regarding the interior, but a report from Bahrein dated the 31st March speaks of great discontent in Hasa over heavy taxation, including customs duties and a tax in lieu of military service. There may be some connexion between this and the dismissal of Sheikh Muhammad Tawil, who was mentioned in paragraph 127 of the last report. The new Governor of Medina, theoretically acting for the King's son Khalid, was installed with some ceremony in May, when an official from Mecca read a Royal rescript,enjoining docility on the population and promising them justice, &amp;c. It may he that Medina is to be modernised. A certain gentleman went to Egypt in May to buy a printing-press, with which to start a paper there. 164. Breezes in the Central Government were rumoured during the month. The most substantial of the stories related to a quarrel between At-Tabaishi, the King’s chamberlain and a man of power, as he looks after the comforts of the King and his ladies, and the Deputy Minister of Finance, who is the brother of the Minister. The Deputy Minister is said to have been disgraced, but to have been begged off by Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman, who humbled himself on this occasion but who remains very influential. 165. More importance attaches to information given to Sir Andrew Ryan by Sheikh Yusuf Yasm on the 23rd May regarding a new administrative system for the whole of the northern frontier. It is to be divided into three sectors, to be managed by inspectors with wide powers. 1 his interests His Majesty s Government, more particularly as regards the frontier area adjoining Trans jordan, where the inspector, directly responsible to the Yiceroy of the Hejaz, is to be Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd, a man who in the past has had good relations with Major Glubb. This arrangement promises well, especially as a new Governor has been appointed to Kaf, in succession to one who lost no chance of outraging the feelings of the authorities of Transjordan. 166. Abdul Hamid-al-Khatib, yet another of the Hejazi exiles who were so actively intriguing abroad against Ibn Saud some time ago, has made his submission and returned to the fold. He was a leading personage in anti-Saudi circles in Egypt. 167. Developments connected with aviation (paragraph 132 of the last report) continue to merit attention. It appears that the “ eagles ' who returned from Italy in April numbered eight only. They came back full of admiration of Italy but they have done little here since their return, have lost much of their initial smartness and are said to be very discontented with their low pay and general treatment, being regarded as little more than chauffeurs. It has been ascertained that the “ White Russian air personnel now consists of one pilot and two mechanics. Subscriptions for the aeroplanes to be named after towns are still being collected and Medina has joined its sister cities in this movement. Fuad Bey seems to have interested himself greatly in Cairo in enquiries as to the types of aeroplanes best suited to Saudi requirements and resources; but it is improbable that any decision has been taken. Meanwhile, Italy has come to the help of the Saudi Government with the gift of aircraft which will be dealt with in paragraph 187 below. 168. The aeroplane imported by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate has been sent to Wejh, complete with a lady wireless operator, the pilot’s wife. The syndicate is very active in various directions, and has made further additions to its personnel, including an Indian doctor. It has suffered one severe loss by the death in Jedda on the'3rd May of Mr. H. Ballard, whose remains were interred in the European cemetery next day. This event caused much painful emotion in local European circles. Mr. Ballard had been working principally on the new direct road to the Mahd-adh-Dhahab mine, which is now nearly complete. Mr. G. F. Laycock. a director of the syndicate and of various companies interested in it, arrived in Jedda on the 27th May and is visiting the areas in which the syndicate is operating. 169. A notice published on the 28th April explained that the new licence duties on tea and sugar are not payable until after the goods have arrived. This tends to confirm the view that it is not intended to restrict imports, but merely to levy a disguised surtax (paragraph 88 of the report for March). 170. The new rials mentioned in paragraph 134 of the last report are now in circulation, but no steps have been taken to call in the old, and though the silver content of the latter is nearly double that of the new coins, both circulate side by side. No general rate of exchange has been fixed officially, but the market rate tends to approximate to that fixed for transactions with the Government, viz., 20 to the gold sovereign. The Government are said to have opened a shop in Mecca where silver can be exchanged for gold. This may be a means of drawing old rials into the Treasury, with consequent profit, when new rials are issued in their place. The whole position is still, however, very obscure. 171. No one has yet got the Red Sea concession (paragraph 135 of the last report). Mr. Ydlibi left on the 1st May. Colonel Etherton, still optimistic,[731 z—1] b 2 o 3 followed on the 27th May. Both gentlemen hoped, if successiui, to maiket the concession to Petroleum Concessions (Limited), a new concern formed under tne auspices of the Iraq Petroleum Company and practically identical with it in composition. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have now, however, decided to send out a representative of their own. INot one, but two, h renchmen, said o ^ represent the Societe francaise des Petroles, arrived on the 2 nd May in the icnc i sloop Bougainville, and have the backing of the French Government tor a con cession in the Farsan Islands. They are still here, but Ibn Saud professes giea eagerness to do business with British interests or, failing an all-British concern, with the Iraq Petroleum Company group. 172. The California-Arabian Standard Oil Company has made turther progress in Hasa. Well No. 2, which had reached a depth ol 2,175 teet about the middle of May, is yielding about sixty barrels an hour of what is said to be an oil of unusually high quality. • at n 173. Some progress has been made with the urban developments in Mecca and Jedda (paragraph 55 of the report for February). Mecca is said now to possess a beautiful and prolific public garden, made by the Minister ol Finance, with the help of Indian experts and money. The large space between the custom-house in Jedda and the town is being actively laid out as a square, which will be overlooked by the house of the Minister of Finance, a Treasury office, which is under construc tion, and the house now occupied by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 174. Minor economic items must again be passed over, but mention may be made of the grandiosely named “ Arab Press and Publications Company (Limited),” formed about a year ago with a capital of 22,000 Saudi piastres, half paid up. The company published its first report on the 28th April, showing a handsome profit, but the shareholders were asked to pa.y up the other moiety and a new issue was to be made, all with the object of buying one new printing-press. The principal business is the production of the Saut-al-Hejaz newspaper. 175. The long-awaited X-ray plant for use in Mecca arrived early in May. As regards the provision of expert personnel, see paragraph 191 below. II.— Frontier' Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 176. Little need be said about Saudi-Iraq relations in view of the lull which has followed the conclusion of the Saudi-Iraq Treaty (paragraph 140 ff. of the last report). The Legation received in May from His Majesty s Embassy in Bagdad the text of an agreement, previously unknown to it, regarding the exchange of wireless messages between Iraq and Saudi Arabia {cf. para graph 126 of the report for April 1935). The agreement was signed in Bagdad on the 6 th October, 1935, and was presumably completed subsequently in Mecca. It was to come into force on the 14th October. 177. An amusing story came from Ashaira early in the month. 1 he King, it was said, produced an astrological prophecy of the deaths of the Kings of Egypt and the Yemen within the year. Having seen this half fulfilled, he spoke with great friendship of the Imam Yahya, whose demise he would regret; but he is stated to have expressed indiscreet joy at that of the late King Fuad and to have consigned him confidently to eternal perdition. Meanwhile, the King of the Yemen is reported to have despatched presents of horses for Ibn Saud and the Saudi princes. 178. There are few signs of any active general interest in the Hejaz in the situation in Palestine. A belated mention may be made of a confidential con versation between Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and His Majesty s Minister on the 29th April, when the former produced a telegram from Haj Amin Huseini to Ibn Saud informing him of the Arab strike in Palestine and invoking his help for the Arab cause there. Sir Andrew Ryan urged the importance of no action being taken by the King, which might excite hopes of his concerning himself with the affairs of Palestine. 179. The Koweit proposals (paragraph 145 of the last report) had not reached Jedda up to the end of May. 180. Attention has been drawn to a mistake in paragraph 75 of the report for February, in which it was stated that two sons of the Sheikh of Bahrein had come on pilgrimage this year. The party, in fact, consisted of the widow of the present sheikh’s father accompanied by two second cousins of the sheikh.III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 181. The appointments of Sir Andrew Ryan to His Majesty’s Legation in Albania and that of Mr. R, W. Bullard to succeed him as Minister in Jedcla were officially announced on the 21st May. Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan expect to leavo Jedda on the 14th or 15th June. Mr. Bullard has had much Arabian experience having been employed in Iraq from 1914 to 1921, and served as Agent and cousin in Jedda from 1923 to 1925. He will probably arrive in Jedda in September. 182. Sheikh Yusuf Vasin and Sir Andrew Ryan had no less than fourteen meetings from the 22nd April to the 30th May to discuss Anglo-Saudi questions, besides meeting three or four times for more private conversations. Ihe impoitant outstanding questions discussed officially so far have been those of the extension of the validity of the Treaty of Jedda and connected matters, notably slavery, on which an agreement was reached, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, on the 23rd May, the Transjordan-Nejd frontier and the eastern and south eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, two subjects regarding which no conclusion has been arrived at. 183. The local press reported in May that a committee to promote the stud) of English in primary schools had been formed in Mecca under the auspices of Jamil Baud, the new assistant to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (see paragraph 2 of the report for January). . . 184. The French Minister returned from Sana on the 2 nd May m the Bougainville, having concluded the Franco-Yemen Treaty (paragraph 147 of the last 'report), but without apparently having induced the Imam to discuss other matters in which the French are interested. Since his return he has been \eiy little in evidence in Jedda. . , 185. The Italian Charge d’Affaires. who had been absent during the king s visit to Jedda this year, applied insistently after his return for an audience. According to Sheikh Yusuf, Ibn Saud was very unwilling to receive him, but consented under pressure. M. Persico left Jedda on the 9th May and returned early on the 11 th, having spent two nights on the road and a few hours only at Ashaira on the afternoon of the 10th. when he had an audience. Arrangements were made as for a formal reception with princes and others present, but the Italian Charge made various statements to the King about Italian policy and received, according to Sheikh YMsuf, who was instructed by the King to give Sir Andrew Rvan confidentially an account of what had passed, very guarded replies. 186. Rumours again gained some currency in May that a close understand ing or alliance between Saudi Arabia and Italy was in contemplation. Fuad Bey Hamza’s name has again been mentioned in this connexion (paragraph 24 of the report for January). All the serious indications are, however, that Ibn Saud is determined to stick to his neutrality, technically as between Italy and Ethiopia, but really in what he conceives as a struggle between Italy and Great Britain. The Saudi Government appear to have been very guarded in their reception of an intimation by M. Persico, made orally at first and confirmed later in writing, regarding the Italian annexation of Abyssinia. It is understood that they invoked their neutrality orally and returned no written reply. 187. One transaction, however, affords ground for surmise as to its true nature. Some little time ago the Italian Government undertook, spontaneously according tO'Sheikh Yusuf, to present six aeroplanes to the Saudi Government, three for training purposes, three for civil use. They sought nothing in return and, again according to Sheikh Yusuf, represented the gift as being inspired solely by their interest in the development of aviation, to which they had already contributed by training Saudi students in Italy. The offer was accepted “ in order not to offend the Italians.” Three instructional aircraft arrived in cases from Massawa on the 29th May. It is not yet known who came with them; possibly the two remaining Saudi students from Italy, who were known to be on their way back; possibly two Italians, who have appeared in Jedda and may have come to assemble the aircraft; possibly all four. As for the Italian pilot mentioned in paragraph 132 of the last report, he was to serve as an instructor, but he contracted jaundice and had to be sent home. A substitute is being arranged for. 188. It became known on the 31st May that the present Italian Charge d’Affaires had been promoted to the rank of Minister. The choice of this moment may be significant, but it was understood, when M. Persico came, that he would5 be appointed in due course to the higher rank. There are signs of disintegration in the lower ranks of the Italian Legation. The senior member of the staff left as soon as possible after M. Persico’s return, hoping never to come back. r ^ w p married juniors are also craving to depart for good. Incidentally, M. Barattini, the Italian mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 66 of the report for February, left on the 3rd March. 189. In the third week of May the Italian Legation again distributed free copies of the Tripolitan paper Al Adi (paragraph 408 of the report for December) and a pamphlet showing the atrocities committed by raiding parties of Abyssinians on peaceful Italian workmen before the outbreak of the war. The pamphlet is copiously illustrated by gruesome photographs. 190. A treaty between Saudi Arabia and Egypt was signed by Fuad Bey Hamza and the Egyptian Prime Minister on the 7th May, and was published in a special number of the Umm-al-Qura on the 9th May. Both parties were eager and agreed to postpone difficult questions, including that of the Sacred Caravan. The most important provisions in the treaty are as follows : By article 1 the Egyptian Government recognise Saudi Arabia as a sovereign and independent State. Under article 5, the Saudi Government agree to the reconditioning by the Egyptian Government of the mosques at Mecca and Medina and to their undertaking other works in the interest of pilgrims, including road construction, the lighting of the mosques and the provision of water. Article 6 contemplates the conclusion of further agreements on customs, postal and maritime matters and the settlement of other questions of common interest. 191. A Saudi mission of four persons left for Egypt early in May to study the use of Rontgen rays. 192. There has been serious tension between the Afghan Minister and the \ Saudi Government. The Minister, who is of great religious consequence in Afghanistan as one of the chiefs of the Nakshibandi sect of dervishes, is a very devout Moslem and seemed at first to be no more than an “ amiable pietist ” as he was called in one report from the British Legation. He has, however, proved pretentious and fussy over protocol. What is worse, he appears to have given great offence to the Saudi Government by his attitude in pilgrimage matters, especially by one vigorous note in which he contested on religious grounds, with texts in support of his thesis, their right to hold up a party of Afghan pilgrims who could not or would not pay their dues. 193. The worst quarrel has been about a house. The following account of this affair cannot be guaranteed in every particular, but is correct as regards the main facts : The Minister rented a house in Taif, without assuring himself that the Saudi Government would allow him to reside there. He took possession and moved in some furniture, then went off to fetch his family. The Saudis staged a comedy, which consisted in a hunt for a house for the father of the Amir Feisal’s favourite wife. The hunt ended at that which the Afghan Minister had rented and the Amir’s servants incontinently occupied it. This may have been the Amir's revenge for the offensive note. Anyhow, the Minister was treated with no consideration and got no satisfaction when he protested. He was told that the Government had a prior right to the house and that the owner was aware of the fact; also that foreign representatives were not allowed to reside elsewhere than in Jedda. 194. The Minister magnified a more general grievance, which is reasonable enough in itself and which he shares with all his colleagues. He was inclined to claim liberty of movement for diplomats, and tried hard to involve His Majesty’s Minister, as doyen, .without telling him the whole story of the house. Having failed, he apparently means to go to Egypt. If he should not return, it will at least have the advantage that he will not himself succeed to the post of doyen, which normally involves very little responsibility in Jedda, but in which a man at once so ignorant and so self-important as M. Mojaddidi might easily make himself a great nuisance. IV.— Miscellaneous. 195. The French warship Bougainville returned to Jedda on the 2nd May bringing the French Minister and the two oil-concession hunters mentioned above' She left next day. 196. Mi. 1 hilby (paragiaph 156 of the last report) started for Abha about the same time that the King left Ashaira. When in Jedda shortly before he wasreticent as to his plans, but it seemed probable that he will visit Najran and perhaps explore further south. He may run into a party of Egyptian archaeologists, who were reported recently to have proceeded to Hodeida and to contemplate research in Najran. 197. The unsatisfactory health conditions in Mecca, referred to in paragraph 157 of the last report, caused considerable alarm, and for a time a somewhat heavy death rate. It was stated early in May that the supply of labour had been affected and there were complaints that the King had made things worse by taking too many doctors to Ashaira. Little has been heard of the sanitary situation since the first week in May; nor have there been any further signs of abnormal disease among pilgrims, the great majority of whom have now left the country. 198. New regulations on mutawwifs or pilgrim guides were promulgated in May, but it has not yet been possible to study them in the Legation. 199. An Indian notable is said to nave offered 25,000 rupees for the construction of a mosque on the site of the Prophet’s birthplace in Mecca. It is stated that this offer was refused, but that the King promised that the Saudi Government would themselves build a library on the spot. On the other hand, the Saudi Government have accepted the offer of the Government of Hyderabad to light the Haram at Medina (paragraph 117 of the report for March) subject to the consideration of certain questions, notably that of the cost of future upkeep. The Legation has not so far taken up with the Saudi Government the more delicate question of the enclosing of tombs. 200. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the Legation during May was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Took refuge during the month : 1 male. On hand at the enclof the month : 1 male.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia;. j . . _ June 3, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. ! 5663 I Section 2.

IBN SAUD left Jedda on the 2nd April, but stayed in Mecca only until the 19th April, when he moved with a large party, including his heir, to Ashaira (an early stage on the road to Riyadh) for country air and hunting. He apparently intended to make that place his base for some weeks and make extensive excursions therefrom. It is uncertain whether he will in due course proceed to Riyadh without revisiting Mecca. Anyhow, he attended a farewell party in Mecca on the 15th April as though he were leaving for Nejd. He made a speech at this banquet, consisting mostly of religious exhortations, but he spoke also of his wish for closer contact with his people in order that they should express to him their desires and know about his acts and intentions. He gave an open invitation to all and sundry to visit him any time, or, in his absence, the Amir Feisal, at a stated daily hour. The press recorded later what may have been another speech of the same character or a further version of the same. In this he preached concord. 121. Taken in conjunction with the announcement mentioned in paragraph 86 of the last report, and with the prolonged stay of the heir apparent in the Hejaz, these Royal utterances have some significance as indications of the King’s desire to popularise his regime and perhaps even to broaden its basis, although autocracy is still essential to its preservation. It is stated that the Amir Saud has become very affectionate with his relatives, and that his (Baud’s) visit to Europe has greatly broadened his outlook. He has had private cinema shows in Mecca and very audible music from the wireless close to the Haram. These proceedings cause some little scandal to the unco’ guid, but may increase his popularity with the local inhabitants. 122. The most important Royal statement was an interview given by the King to the correspondent of the Cairo A hram and published in the local press also on the 16th April. He expressed high hopes of the beneficial consequences to the Arab nation of the recent Saudi-Iraq Treaty (paragraph 140 ff. below). He hoped that other Arab countries would join the alliance. The correspondent added a gloss to the effect that he understood the King to be referring to Egypt, Transjordan, Palestine and Syria. As regards the present international crisis, the King hoped that “ wisdom would overcome recklessness.” He advised Arabs to keep calm and not to meddle in matters of no concern to them. He applauded the wisdom of the French Government, his friends, in negotiating with the Syrians. Turning to a completely different subject, he defended his action in giving a concession to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. 8659 [731 c—2] ’ B123. There was much talk over a year ago about dissension between the King and his sons and his brothers and their families (paragraph 4 of the report for January 1935). The situation seems to have eased. The King’s brother Muhammad appears to live remote but unambitiously, much concerned with religious interests. This brother’s son Khalid was one of the Royal party which came to Jedda in March (paragraph 79 ff. of the last report). There has been a rapprochement between the King and his perhaps more ambitious brother Abdullah, with whom His Majesty had definitely quarrelled, although Mr. Philby attributes the breach to a quite minor dispute. 124. The second granddaughter of Nuri-ash-Shalan (paragraph 114 of the last report) arrived early in April and was duly married to the Amir Baud. Both sisters and their brother Fawwaz seem to enjoy great consideration. Fawwaz left Jedda by sea on the 15th April. 125. The Amir Feisal stayed in Mecca after the King’s departure for Ashaira. He has since moved the seat of Government in the Hejaz to Taif, the summer capital, looking in at Ashaira on the way. 126. Fuad Bey Hamza left for Egypt on the 14th April in the circumstances to be described below. His place is taken as usual by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who reached Mecca from Bagdad on the 9th April. This great little Arab nationalist has since shown symptoms of swelled head, due no doubt to his success in Iraq and to his having heard much hot gospelling in Syria during the pause in his negotiations. 127. Various administrative changes were announced in April. The most important were the supersession of Sheikh Muhammad Tawil (paragraph 328 of the report for October 1935) by a new Director of Finance (the official appointed last year to look after the' business of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company), and a new Director of Customs in Hasa; the retirement on grounds of health of the fanatical “ acting ” Governor of Medina, who went back there contrary to expectation last summer and autumn (paragraph 184 of the report for June 1935); and the appointment in his place of Abdullah-as-Sdayry, which should increase the King’s hold on the key-posts in his dominions, as the Sdayry family are closely connected with His Majesty by marriage. 128. Wahhabism still has some kick in it. On the 29th April, it is said, the Committee of Virtue in Jedda, incensed by a recrudescence of veneration for the tomb of a Yemeni holy man and reputed miracle worker, who died many years ago, razed it to the ground and removed the skeleton to a common cemetery. 129. The establishment of a new wireless station at Qariya in Hasa was announced in April. That at Uqair seems to have been suppressed, but at what date is not known. 130. A project of the Director-General of Police to establish a school in Mecca for destitute and disabled children from 8 to 15 years was announced on the 24th April. The curriculum is to include industrial training. 131. Some attention has been attracted by the arrival in Jedda not long ago of a party from Jizan, who were conveyed in an unusual manner to Mecca. This appears to have been responsible for a rumour that an important member of the Idrisi family had been surrendered or had submitted to Ibn Saud. It now seems probable that this Idrisi has been in Mecca for some considerable time, and that the other party consisted of important Asiri sheikhs concerned in a quarrel between the local inhabitants and the Saudi authorities at Jizan. 132. Air matters’ continue to excite interest. The “ Eagles ” from Italy duly arrived in Jedda on the 4th April, all but one or two, who are said to have remained behind. Those who returned were warmly feted in Jedda and Mecca. The King and his elder sons received them and gave them much good advice. They have not yet had much chance of showing their quality, as they are apparently not to fly the Wapitis of the Saudi Air Force at present. They, however, made a good many short flights over Jedda on the 27th April ff. in the new French monoplane (paragraph 84 of the last report) under the supervision of the Russian pilots, or pilot, for it is thought that only one remains besides a mechanic in Jedda. Fuad Bey Hamza is understood to be arranging for the purchase of two aircraft for training. A subscription has been opened in certain towns to finance the purchase of three further machines, to be called Mecca, Jedda and Riyadh. The sums collected up to the 28th April were stated to be approximately £gold 540 for Mecca, 1,000 for Jedda and 1,200 for Riyadh.3 The Italian Government may also lend a hand in providing aircraft for training purposes and civil aviation, but this information is at present most confidential. An Italian air pilot arrived in Jedda by sea on the 29th April. 133. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have been allowed to import an aeroplane for their own use, which was brought in parts from the Lnited States and assembled in Egypt. Piloted by a Mr. Mountain, it arrived in Jedda on the 29th April and landed on a private ground laid out by the syndicate near their compound outside the town. It is a Bellanca monoplane similar in type to the machine presented to Ibn Saud by the French Government, but bigger and better 134. A portion, if not all, of the rials minted for the Saudi Government in Birmingham (paragraph 88 of the last report) would appear to have arrived in Jedda about the end of the month. It remains to be seen how they are to be floated and whether the Government can call in the existing rials and stabilise the new ones at twenty to the gold pound. If they can get back any considerable quantity of old rials, they should make a handsome profit, as the respective silver contents would appear to be *642 ounces in the old rial and -346 ounces in the new coin modelled on the Indian rupee. 135. The rivalry for the Red Sea Oil Concession (paragraph 90 of the last report) continues. The eternal optimist, M. Ydlibi, has more than once postponed his departure but was still confident on the 21st April, when he called on Sir Andrew Ryan for the second time. Colonel Etherton broke finally with Mr. Philby on the 14th April and has since been negotiating direct with the Saudi officials, increasing his offers for the Red Sea concession to figures which sound extravagant and eliciting even more extravagant demands. His prospects of success seem poor and his prospects of a gold concession even poorer. Nothing more of a definite kind had been heard up to the 30th April about the Frenchman who was to visit the Farsan Islands. There is no reason to suppose that the Standard Oil Company of California are interested in the Red Sea area, although Sheikh Yusuf Yasin appears to have tried to get them to nibble and to have told M. Ydlibi that they were, in fact, nibbling. 136. Work proceeds at the two wells in the Jebel Dhahran (paragraph 93 of the last report). Superabundance of gas has again created great difficulty at well No. 1 but No. 2 is going fine, according to the Jedda representative of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. 137. Nothing more has been heard of Colonel Etherton’s interest in transport or of his combined grenade thrower, machine gun and revolver. Other parties in England seem to be interested in the possibility of a transport monopoly in Saudi Arabia, among them the Dunlop Rubber Company, who have been in touch with Abboud Pasha of Egypt and whose representative, a Mr. C. H. Tancred, visited Jedda in April but only for a few days. He was also considering the possibility of a monopoly for tyres, which would appear to be barred by the Sharqieh concession, and of marketing out-size tyres in which Dunlops specialise. 138. Meanwhile, the existing native monopoly (paragraph 148 of the report for May 1935) has published a statement of accounts for its first year of working. It shows a net profit of 793,595 gold piastres, a figure which would be more impressive were not 309,466 gold piastres of the receipts shown as being due by the Government. The administration proposed to pay a dividend of £gold in cash on the 5,000 £10 shares, to hold a substantial sum over for repairs in the following year, and to pass 110,000 gold piastres to reserve plus a further 220,000 gold piastres credited to reserve out of sums due by the Government. 139. Minor economic matters must be passed over but attention may be drawn to the increasing tendency to float small native companies for various purposes. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 140. Even before it had been approved by the Iraqi Parliament, which, however, accepted it unanimously on or before the 9th April, the conclusion of the Saudi Iraqi “Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance,” signed at Bagdad on the 2nd April (paragraph 94 of the last report), was widely advertised by both sides, with special reference to its importance as a great step forward towards the union of all Arabs. The text was made public in Mecca and Bagdad on the 6 th April and was communicated the same day by the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the foreign missions in Jedda. [731 c—2] * b 2141. No full account of the treaty can be given here but the following are the main heads of what was agreed upon : ( 1 ) Neither party to enter into any commitment towards a third Power which might preiudice the interests of the other. (2) All disputes to be settled by friendly negotiation, or failing this, under the new arbitration protocol to be negotiated in due course. (3) Joint efforts to be made to settle peacefully any dispute between either party and any third party, involving danger of war. ( 4 ) Joint efforts to be made to repel any aggression against either party. Definition of aggression. ( 5 ) Stated measures to be taken by each party in the event of disorder m the territory of the other. ( 6 ) Efforts to be made to secure the accession of the Yemen to the treaty. More general provision for the possible accession of any other independent Arab State, at the request of such State. (7) Exchange of educational and military missions. ( 8 ) Each party to be free but not bound to request the othei to undeitake its diplomatic and consular representation abroad. ( 9 ) Caveat in favour of Iraqi obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. Both parties to carry out the provisions of article 17 of the Covenant and to observe the principles of the Kellogg Pact of 1928. . . (10) Either party to be free to denounce the treaty without notice, in the event of aggression by the other against a third party. Friendship not to be impaired by such denunciation. (11) Preservation of previous treaties between the two parties, where they do not conflict with the present treaty. (12) Negotiation of subsidiary agreement on stated subjects to be begun within one year. . , , (13) (14) Treaty to come into force on exchange of ratifications and to remain in force for ten years and a further similar period, failing notice of termination one year before the expiration of the first period. 142. The definition of aggression under (4) is modelled on that in the Turco-Iraqi-Iranian Pact of Non-Aggression initialled at Geneva last autumn. The Saudi Government have no present intention, however, of joining m that pact. Special interest attaches to the references to the Covenant of the League ot Nations in the definition of aggression and at (9). Fuad Bey Hamza told Sir Andrew Ryan on the 13th April that the two Kings were informing the King of the Yemen that day of the conclusion of the treaty. He did not feel assuied that the Yemen would eventually accede to it, as the Imam Jahya might hesitate over certain clauses, e.g., those referring to the Covenant of the League 143 The celerity with which the treaty with Iraq was negotiated renects the eagerness of certain Arab statesmen to get their countries together in a bloc which might take advantage of trouble in Europe. The Saudi negotiations with Eo-ypt (paragraph 150 below) have been expedited in the same spirit, which is further reflected in the recent unrest in Syria and Palestine and m such minor events as the despatch of Yemeni students to Iraq the tours of Iraqi Members of Parliament, &amp;c. Most of these matters are outside the scope of this report but it is significant that on the 29th April Sheikh Yusuf Yasm consulted Sir Andrew Ryan confidentially under instructions about a telegram from the President of the Supreme Moslem Council in Palestine, invoking Ibn Saud s support for th latest Arab anti-British movement there. Sheikh Yusuf expatiated on the King’s eagerness to avoid anything which might embarrass His Majesty s Government or cloud his relations with them; but he spoke in the same breath of the importance to his master of maintaining his prestige m the Arab world. Sir Andrew Ryan said all he could to dissuade the King from encouraging hopes that he would concern himself in Palestinian affairs. rp 144. No further clashes between patrols have been reported from the i ra ns- iordan frontier. The Saudi complaints (paragraph 95 of the last report) still remain unanswered. The general question of the frontier is dealt with m paragraph 146 below.r 5 145. It has now been arranged that the Koweit Government shall formulate their own proposals for giving effect to the desiderata expressed by Fuad Bey to Sir Andrew Ryan in November (paragraph 96 of the last report). III. —Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 146. Various reasons prevented Fuad Bey and Sir Andrew Ryan from resuming their official conversations (paragraphs 98 and 99 of the last report) before Fuad Bey left for Cairo. A fresh start had to be made with Sheikh Yusuf Yasm. Although he is notoriously a difficult negotiator, it is fair to say that he showed much greater keenness to get on with the work than Fuad Bey had done. A fresh series of official conversations began on the 22nd April and is still continuing. I hey have related principally to the connected questions of slavery and the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda, but in the first conversation Sir Andrew Ryan pressed Sheikh Yusuf strongly to produce an agreement which, according to a statement made by Fuad Bey at Riyadh in November, was concluded between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Qatar before the date of the Anglo-Qatar treaty of 1916 and which Fuad Bey invoked in support of the Saudi claim to the debel Vakhsh (paragraph 400 of the report for December). On the 28th April Sir Andrew Ryan addressed a long personal letter to Sheikh Yusuf stating u 6 ,~^ es ^ Proposals of His Majesty’s Government for a settlement regarding the Transjordan—Nejd frontier, ihe position in regard to the Koweit blockade question is mentioned in paragraph 145 above. Certain other matters have been left m abeyance. tt • The French Minister was absent most of the month, having left for Hodeida in the Bougainville on the 17th April in order to complete his treaty negotiations at Sana. Italian Charge d’Affaires at last returned to Jedda on the 16th April, i he Odello ladies had left on the previous day and M. Persico now speaks freely of the difficulties which Odello created for him before they both left in January. He had arranged in Rome that Odello should not again get a visa or Jedda, but there is no confirmation of reports that Odello has been run in at home on charges of peculation. M. Persico’s relations with the Saudi Govern- ment appear to be friendly. 149. The horses for the Queen of the Netherlands (paragraph 102 of the last report) sailed m the same ship as Fuad Bey on the 14th April. Opinions varv greatly as to their quality. The Dutch Charg 6 left three days later. 150. On the 8 th April Fuad Bey informed Sir Andrew Ryan privately tnat, as a result of telegrams between Cairo and Mecca, negotiations for a settle- ment of all outstanding questions between Saudi Arabia and Egypt were about P., 6 - . apparently sudden development was made public on the 10 th April and Fuad Bey, with a small staff, left for Cairo on the 14th April there appears to be no longer any obstacle to the recognition of Ibn Saud by the King of Egypt and it seems probable that this may be accorded, whether the treaty negotiations succeed or fail. 1 hese appear to be proceeding satis- lactonly but the vexed question of the Sacred Caravan presents difficulty and judging by a recent observation by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Sir Andrew Ryan it may prove to be an even greater difficulty than would appear from telegrams from His Majesty s High Commissioner in Cairo to the Foreign Office. Nevertheless the Saudi Government are now extremely eager for a complete settlement with gypt- Ihe implications of this attitude are glanced at in paragraph 143 151. The news of King Fuad’s death on the 28th April created little apparent emotion in the Hejaz, but the Amir Feisal telegraphed condolences to the. Prime Minister of Egypt, and Sheikh Yusuf was one of the first callers at the Egyptian consulate in Jedda. 152. The ^audi Minister in London was among the representatives of States, not members of the League of Nations, to whom the Foreign Office communicated early in April the recent London Naval Treaty The Saudi Government might take the opportunity of drawing attention to their admirable record as regards the limitation, both quantitative and qualitative of naval armaments. ’6 IV.— Miscellaneous. 153. The French warship Bougainville arrived at Jedda on the 11 th April to convey the French Minister to Hodeida (paragraph 147 above). He left on the 17th April. Courtesies were exchanged on this occasion between the ship and the British Legation. Lady Ryan attended a reception on board on the 14th ^ April. The officers and the French Legation party visited the British Legation next day. It was noticed that the officers included one of apparently equal rank with the commander, viz., a chef de bataillon de Tinfanterie coloniale. 154. Various European visitors to Jedda have been mentioned earlier. The only name that need be added is that of Mr. V. Hadkinson, the export manager in Egypt of the British-American Tobacco Company. His visit was apparently connected with the new arrangements in the office of Messrs. Lazzerini (para graph 66 of the report for February), who act as intermediaries between the company and their native distributors. Mr. Hadkinson spoke of the market for cigarettes in the Hejaz as good, the per capita consumption being greater than that of Egypt. 155. Mr. A. C. Oppenheim, His Majesty’s vice-consul, left Jedda for good on the 16th April after over three years of most meritorious service in the Legation. His place is taken by Mr. J. B. T. Judd. 156. Other departures have been fairly numerous. Mr. Philby followed the King to Ashaira. It is strongly rumoured, but not yet confirmed, that he is about to undertake another considerable journey of exploration, perhaps in the south-west of the peninsula. His wife went home in April. 157. The dispersal of the pilgrimage proceeded normally during the month and is now nearly complete. General health conditions in the Hejaz, especially in Mecca, have deteriorated since the pilgrimage, but on the whole natives seem to have been affected more than pilgrims. There was no evidence whatsoever in support of a rumour of cholera in Mecca. Smallpox has created some little anxiety, owing especially to the death of several Sudani pilgrims, who developed the disease on the road from Medina. All were, however, from the same place in the Sudan and formed part of a single party. There are no signs of a general epidemic, but the situation is being watched carefully. 158. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the Legation during April was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : One female. Took refuge in April: Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : One female. On hand at the end of the month : Nil.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT % EASTERN (Arabia). May 4, 1936.

After his return from Jedda to Mecca on the 26th February, Ibn Saud was busy with the pilgrimage until some little time after Haj Day, which fell on the 3rd March. It appears to be true that unusual precautions were taken to prevent any repetition of the incident of last year and that unauthorised persons were kept at a distance. Otherwise, however, the King seems to have observed his usual routine. He gave his usual dinner for notable pilgrims on the evening of the 29th February. Admission was to be by invitation, but gate-crashers considerably augmented the 350 guests who were said to have been invited. The King’s speech as reported in the press presented few features of interest. He preached unity among Moslems, and particularly Arabs; reproached them with talking much but doing little, and suggested that they should not, like Jews and Christians, let their conduct belie their words; and made a friendly reference to Iraq. Ismail Ghuznavi (paragraph 116 below) translated the speech into Urdu. 79. The Amir Feisal was to come to Jedda on the 20 th March to meet the French aeroplane (paragraph 84), and the King was to follow on the 21st March to receive the French Minister and the officers detailed to bring it to Jedda. Owing to a delay in the arrival of the aeroplane, both high personages were left goose-stepping in Mecca for five days, but in due course the Amir arrived on the 25th March and the King on the 26th. Although the visit of His Majesty was not official, he brought an unusually large train, including two or three of his wives, and a posse of princes headed by the heir apparent. What with the King in his palace, the ladies at the Kandara villa and the two eldest sons at houses in the town, Jedda saw much of royalty. Even the desert swarmed with princelings, and it was difficult to play golf or even to putt mildly on the little course reserved for that purpose without being watched by them and their retainers. According to Fuad Bey, Hamza Ibn Saud now has twenty-five sons, the number having increased of late at the rate of two or three per annum. Some must be babies still, but the number of sons and grandsons in Jedda was impressive. On the afternoon of the 28th they were taken for short trips in the new aeroplane. 80. The Royal party was gay. It is said that on the 26th March an evening party at the Deputy Governor’s, where the Amir Feisal was staying, ended like a bump supper, so numerous were the daggers and chairs that flew about. The senior princes and other personages dined with Mr. and Mrs. Philby on the 28th March. All the European ladies who could be mobilised were present and 8598 [706 d—41 Bsome diplomatic representatives. There were nearly forty guests and a good time was had by all, despite the absence of the British Legation party owing to mourning. 81. The senior princes returned to Mecca after the Philby party, but on the 31st March the King, his ladies and several of his younger sons were still in Jedda for the sea breezes, which blew abominably from the north on that day afte^pt blowing even more disagreeably from the south during the preceding days. It says much for Ibn Baud’s kindness as a husband and father that he has stood the climate for longer than he has done for several years. 82. Fuad Bey Hamza was in Jedda from the 14th to 18th March and from the 23rd March to the end of the month. He appears to be au mieux with the French and spent the night of the 15th March aboard the French steamship Sinaia. On the 28th March he installed the Jedda branch of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the former Persian Legation, a roomier house than its previous squalid habitation, but in a very inconvenient position in the south of the town. Fuad Bey has had two or three recurrences of the liver or heart complaint from which he has long suffered. He was to leave for Syria in April and to go on to Europe for a cure, perhaps at Karlsbad, though he also thinks of Harrogate. His programme was altered early in April to include an important visit to Cairo to negotiate the settlement of all outstanding questions. 83. Important aerial developments occurred during the month. On the 29th February an aeroplane arrived from Egypt to take the Princess Khadija Halim (paragraph 75 of the last report) back after the pilgrimage. She left Jedda on or about the 7th for Medina. Three smaller aeroplanes arrived from Egypt on the 1 st March, the survivors of a party of four which had left Cairo with two cadets of the Egyptian Royal Family and some others. One machine, and it is thought one cadet, got no further than Wejh or Yanbu. Thus the pilgrimage by air is an accomplished fact, but for Egyptians the gilt is a little taken off the gingerbread owing to the enforcement of quarantine at Tor, which makes the return journey nearly, if not quite, as long as that by sea. 84. The crowning glory, perhaps, was the arrival on the 25th March, five days behind the advertised date, for some unknown reason, of the aeroplane presented by the French Government to Ibn Saud (see paragraph 64 of the last report and paragraph 79 above). The machine is a Caudron-Renault Pelican four-seater, apparently an ambulance refitted for Royal use. 85. The student aviators sent to Italy last year left Naples on the 7th March and were expected here before the end of March, but their return via Massawa was delayed and they did not actually arrive until the 4th April. It is more than ever the'fashion in the press to acclaim these lads as “eagles.” Mr. Philby suggests that the word used more properly means “ vultures,” but the balance of evidence is that the local journalists know their own language even better than Mr. Philby. 86 . The Advisory Legislative Council completed another session on the 23rd March and was reconstituted for a further period as from the 24th March, the beginning of the Moslem year. The King opened the new session on the following day and foreshadowed legislation for the creation of an assembly of representatives from every district in the kingdom, to meet annually at pilgrimage time, with a view to strengthening the relations between the people and the Government. This recalls the experiment of June 1931 (paragraph 19 of the report for May-June of that year) when the King convened a council of representatives of the Hejaz towns. That also was to be held annually, but this council was somewhat censorious and the experiment was not repeated. 87. The most interesting new appointment to the Legislative Council was that of Abdur-Rauf Sabban, who was one of the most active conspirators abroad some years ago, but who made his peace with the King last year after the proclamation of the “ amnesty ” of January 1935. Two other repentant ex-conspirators of note were rewarded at the same time : Tahir-ad-Dabbagh with the post of Director of Education, and Muhammad Sadiq with that of Assistant Director of Awkaf. 88 . Fiscal measures of considerable importance were announced in the press on the 27th March, in the almost casual manner in which so much Saudi legisla tion is promulgated. Three notices appeared under a general heading stating that they had been sanctioned by high decree. One imposed a licence system for the importation of tea and sugar, which aimed apparently at assigning quotas to3 merchants, but was suspected by some to be a step in the direction of a monopoly. Another effected important changes in the customs tariff. The third provided for a 5 per cent, tax on rents, payable by the landlord, subject to an exception in favour of owners occupying their own property. A separate notice published by the Ministry of Finance made the Saudi silver riyal exchangeable for transactions ^“^with the Government at the rate of 20 to the English gold pound and effected certain other changes in the currency system. On paper this meant a devaluation of the riyal to half its former legal value of 10 to the gold pound, but as that rate had long ceased to be effective, the change amounted to little more than a belated adaptation of the previous legal situation to conditions already prevailing. For a day or two there was emotion in Jedda and Mecca, but when it was discovered that the stabilisation was for Government purposes only and that market transactions were not affected, the emotion quickly subsided. The new riyals (paragraph 48 of the last report) do not seem to have yet arrived. 89. There has been again much talk of new economic developments. A concession for electricity in Jedda has been given to two local merchants who appear to be in touch with M. Ydlibi of Manchester (paragraph 112 of the report for April 1935). 90. This is the first recent occasion on which an important concession has been given to local interests. The concessionnaires realise that they will need foreign capital and technical assistance, but it is understood that the proportion of foreign capital is to be limited to 45 per cent. M. Ydlibi himself arrived in Jedda on the 29th March. His main objectives this year are to make a fresh effort to secure the oil concession for the Koweit Neutral Zone, and to get the other oil concession of which he spoke hopefully last year (ibidem) for the whole Red Sea littoral. For the latter purpose he and his associates are now working on behalf of Petroleum Concessions (Limited), a new company similar in composition to the Iraq Petroleum Company. 91. Another notable concession-hunter is Colonel P. T. Etherton. of Central Asian fame. He came out ostensibly in connexion with a scheme for organising transport in Saudi Arabia, which was the subject of a puff preliminary in the Times of the 10 th March. He seems to have, in fact, looked into the transport proposition after his arrival on the 22nd March, but with unpromising results. He has been pursuing larger ideas of an oil concession, apparently for the same area as that which M. Ydlibi has in view, and a gold concession, apparently outside the limits of the prospecting area of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. As a side-line, he is interested in trying to market a curious weapon invented by an officer who took part in the Mount Everest expedition, wdth which Colonel Etherton was associated some time ago. Colonel Etherton professes to be repre senting a powerful group in England, but little is known as to the true nature of his backing. Although he came out under the auspices of Mr. Philby and was that gentleman’s guest over the end of the month, their relations have been singularly strained. 92. French groups, of which much less is known, are also interesting them selves in Saudi Arabia. One known as Mekpel ran a large pilgrim ship, the Sinaia, for North Africans in 1935 and again this year. They are understood to be still interested in the Mecca-Jedda Railway project (paragraph 112 of the report for April 1935) and in some sort of irrigation scheme. Fuad Bey told Sir Andrew Ryan on the 30th March that a representative of another French group was expected to visit the Farsan Islands in connexion with oil. 93. Meanwhile, the two established concerns, the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, are still going strong. Oil wells Nos. 1 and 2 in Hasa (paragraph 51 of the last report) had on the 14th March reached depths of 2,655 and 1.207 feet respectively and an encouraging showing of oil was discovered during the previous weeks’ drillino- at well No. 1 . II. —Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 94. The negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq were resumed on Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s return to Bagdad on the 26th March. Notwithstanding the remarks by Fuad Bey quoted in paragraph 56 of the last report, they proceeded with such celerity that the treaty, described as one of “ Arab Brotherhood and Alliance ” was expected to be signed on the 30th or 31st March. There was a [706 d—4] b 24 slight delay, due apparently to some last-minute hesitation on the part of Ibn ^aud, but the treaty was in fact signed on the 2nd April. It will be dealt with further in the report for April. 95. On the 1 st March the Saudi Government formulated a fresh protest (c/. paragraph 59 of the last report) regarding alleged violations of their territory by 1 ransjordan patrols. The places claimed by both sides are so marginal that disputes can only be avoided by a settlement of the general question of the lie of the frontier, which will be referred to below. No reply has been returned so far to the specific complaints of the Saudi Government. 96. On the 29th February the Political Agent in Koweit telegraphed that the sheikh had accepted in principle the proposals made by Fuad Bey to Sir Andrew Ryan at Riyadh in November (paragraph 399 of the report for December). J uad Bey was so informed in due course, but the question of further procedure to give effect to the proposals is still outstanding. 97. Ihe Legation has had confidential access to a tracing of the map prepared by the Saudi-Yemen frontier commissioners (paragraph 60 of the last report). As a geographical document it is quite valueless, but it contains a wealth of names on either side of the boundary shown in it and should, therefore, be useful for the solution of any future differences. III .—Relations with Powers Outside A rabia. 98 Sir Andrew Ryan called on Fuad Bey on the 16th March and made a series of statements to him regarding the most important questions outstanding between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government, viz., (a) the future of the Treaty of Jedda and the questions connected with the proposal to extend its operation for a term of years, the most important of which are that of slavery and a new formula regarding the trade in arms from the United Kingdom; (5) the eastern and south-eastern frontiers ; and (c) the Transjordan-Nejd frontier. The question of the Koweit blockade (see paragraph 96 above) was also discussed, and Sir Andrew Ryan adverted to that of air facilities on the Hasa Coast, which has been left in abeyance pending the discussion of other questions. He further threw out feelers regarding Saudi-Italian relations and the latest attitude of the Saudi Government in regard to a possible entry into the League of Nations. 99. luad Bey s reactions were for the most part very guarded, but the conversations were continued on the 28th and 30th March. Some progress was made with the subjects at (a) and (c) above, but the general impression left in Sir Andrew Ryan s mind was that the Saudi Government are no longer keen on expediting the settlement of any of the major questions pending a clarification of the European situation. 190. The pi esentation of an aeroplane to Ibn Saud by the French Govern ment has been recorded above. The press announced during the month that a sum of 50,000 fr., apparently the revenue of Haramayn Wakfs, in Tunis had been forwarded to the Hejaz with a letter from the bey. 101 The Italian Charge d’Affaires remained absent throughout the month. He would appear to have won all along the line in his struggle against Shnior Odello. It became pretty clear during the month that Signor Odello would not return. His ladies hung on, but their house was relet to the Afghan Legation as from the 24th March and mother and daughter receded into a small portion of it, pending their departure. There has been no sign of any development in Saudi- Itahan relations. The Saudi Government seemed to be determined to adhere to the pohcy of neutrality defined in their note of the 28th January to the League of Nations (paragraph 65 of the last report). It may be mentioned that in that note they laid special stress on their position as a Moslem Power and custodians of the Holy Places, as making it incumbent on them to maintain friendly relations with all Powers having Moslem subjects. 102 . Arrangements were made in March for the despatch of a stallion and three mares as a gift from Ibn Saud, or theoretically, it would appear from the Amir Saud, as a gift to the Queen of the Netherlands. PP 103. The Diplomatic Corps in Jedda continues to dwindle. The Turkish representative left on the 1 st March, the Iranian on the 25th March. The Belgian consul went oh to Brussels on the 20 th March. A young but enterprising local merchant, Muhammad Abdullah Alireza, h-* 3 ' Vcome honorary Czechoslovakian consul.o 104. The Saudi Government declined politely on the 29 th February an invitation from His Majesty’s Government to attend the Chemical engineering Congress of the World Power Conference to be held in London m June. IV.— Miscellaneous. 105. H.M.S. Londonderry, Captain H. B. Jacomb, visited Jedda from the 1st to the 8 th March. Twelve Moslem ratings were given the opportunity oi making the pilgrimage. , , , i i ** ™ 106. The French warship d'Iberville arrived on the 4th March and lett o the 8 th March. , r ^ s + 107. The annual Haj Regatta was held on the 5 th March. lor the hrst time in recent years the aggregate of non-British ships in port exceeded that oi British ships, of which there were only three. The others included the r rench ships Sinaia (see paragraph 92 above) and the Ville de Beyrouth, which, however, was chartered by the Khedivial Mail Line and officered by them. Only the British ships took any effective part in the regatta, but the French Legation, inspired doubtless by its rise in life and the presence of three vessels flying the French flag, passed remarks of some acerbity about the organisation of the regatta. 1 he incident was liquidated in a quick orgy of reconciliation, and Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan were among the guests at an informal but sumptuous lunch on board the Sinaia on the 7th March. It then came out that, although the d Iberville b a fl arrived too late to put boats in the water for the regatta and the Sinaia had professed inability to do so, they had had their own rowing races before the luncheon. French victories were thus assured. 108. Mr. Maxwell Darling (paragraph 71 of the last report) left for Jizan on the 17th March and, to anticipate, returned on the 1 st April after an instructive investigation of the locust position in the coastal region. Fuad Be\ Hamza was extremely helpful in obtaining the King s permission for this for a European—unusual journey and in connexion with the motor transport arrange ments for Mr. Darling and his servants. Mr. Darling left Jedda for Cairo on the 3rd April to attend the postponed Locust Conference there. 109. Pilgrimage Day fell on the 3rd March. According to the published statistics the total number of sea-borne pilgrims this year was 30,966 adults and 1 035 children. These included from India, 8,231 adults and 208 children; from the Dutch East Indies 5,109 adults and 337 children; and from Egypt 5,617 adults and 106 children. 1,829 pilgrims were stated to have used the overland route from Nejef. including a still uncertain number of Indians and 200 Afghans. It is estimated that from 60,000 to 70,000 persons were present at Arafat on the threat day. The overland contingent from the Yemen is thought not to have exceeded 1,000 to 1,500. Contradictory accounts had been received before the pilgrimage’of the attitude of the Saudi authorities towards intending Yemeni piffirims, especially as regards the route which they would be allowed to follow. Certain restrictions would appear to have been enforced, but it is not clear whether they were due to police precautions or to the new policy of discouraging pilgrims without means to pay dues, &amp;c. . .. . 110 . Rain fell in Mecca on the evening of the 2nd March and pilgrims were incommoded at Arafat by a violent dust-storm on the afternoon of the 3rd Match, which was followed by more rain and a climatic improvement. The sanitary state of the pilgrimage left nothing to be desired, w’ith the result that ships returning southward were again exempted from calling at Kamaran, and the Alexandria Quarantine Board pronounced the pilgrimage clean on the 18th March. The defects of the motor transport service provided under the new arrangements described in paragraph 148 of the report for last May gave rise to numerous complaints. Camels were also said to be in short supply at Mecca. Congestion and mismanagement at Jedda, when the first ships were lea\ing, also caused a t&gt;'ood deal of trouble and some clashes between pilgrims and the local authorities for two or three days. Generally speaking, however, the conditions of the 1936 pilgrimage were good. HI The Saudi Government furnished the Legation on the 31st March with the names of five Punjabi pilgrims who lost their lives in the floods inland from Rabight (paragraph 73 of the last report) and next day they added two Bahreinis to the list.6 112 . The Egyptian pilgrim ship Kawsar, which ran aground on a reef on the 28th February, was refloated by a salvage vessel on the 10 th March after abortive eftorts by the Zamzam, also owned by the Misr Navigation Company, to get her off.. Her bottom was not seriously damaged and she was able to go to sea again on the 16th March. 113. The initiation of the pilgrimage by air from Egypt is described paragraph 83 above. No general service has been started so far. 114. Several other pilgrims of some distinction came on pilgrimage, including h awwaz-bin-Sha lan, whose sister married Ibn Saud some months ago. The other sister, lauza, who was said to have jibbed at a Royal alliance, would appear to have relented and was to leave Damascus on the 30th March to become the wife of the Amir Saud. 115. The King himself reversed the decision mentioned in paragraph 76 of the last report regarding would-be pilgrims recently converted to Islam. Mrs. Sterling was its only victim. The King’s new attitude enabled Mr. MacBryan and two other Europeans, a Pole and a Hungarian (not a Greek, as previously stated), to go to Mecca. It is proposed in future to require pilgrims of this kind to sojourn for three months in Jedda under the tutelage of a religious committee, whose favourable report will be considered to qualify them for access to the Holv Places. Mr. MacBryan, by the way, is not Scotch, but a native of Bath of Irish origin. He still resides in Sarawak as a stockbroker. 116. The Saudi authorities refused to take part this year in the informal committee, which has sat annually for some years under the presidency of the Indian vice-consul, to assign return passages to Indian pilgrims. This was attributed to the activities of that fanatic and ill-conditioned Indian Ismail Ghuznavi, who serves as a Saudi pilgrimage propagandist in India. He denies this particular charge, but he has been in many ways an unmitigated nuisance for some time past. Sir Andrew Ryan, at the instance of the Government of India, made strong representations about him to Fuad Bey Hamza on the 16th March. This produced a partial change in Ghuznavi’s own attitude and a disarming reply from Fuad Bey on the 30th. 117. Another matter of interest in connexion with the Indian pilgrimage is a project of the Government of Hyderabad to light the Haram at Medina by electricity and to enclose certain venerated cemeteries there, perhaps also at Mecca. The Legation is concerned in these matters, but the Hyderabad Govern ment also sent a surveyor on pilgrimage to look into the practical aspects of the matter. 118. The Saudi Government, who remain invincibly hostile to international sanitary arrangements connected with the pilgrimage, sent a doctor of sorts to Tor this year to study the conditions there. 119. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the Legation in March was as follows : — On hand at the beginning of the month : One female. Took refuge in March : Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : One female.[656 gg—1] B 'V—\ * 1 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). rj' ' 1 March 30. 1936.

Enclosure. Jedda Report for February 1936. I .—Internal Affairs. 41 a. As stated in the last report, Ibn Baud arrived at Koweit on the 30th January. He had an illness on the road thither, but was, according to the new political agent, in a “ romping ” and jovial mood during his stay. He got back to Riyadh on or about the 9th February. He left again for Mecca on the 19th and arrived on the 22nd. Early on the 25th he came to Jedda for the inside of two days, mainly for the purpose of receiving the credentials of new Ministers (see below). He received most of the foreign representatives in corpore on the morning of his arrival and appeared to be in good health and spirits. He expatiated on the excellence of the rains throughout his northern dominions. Next day he received various foreign representatives in private audience. These included Sir Andrew Ryan, who presented to him Mr. Maxwell Darling, an officer of the Sudan Department of Agriculture, now engaged in locust research under the auspices of the Economic Advisory Council. His Majesty discoursed about locusts with great liveliness. He adheres, as a good Moslem, to the traditional belief that they originate in the interior of a fish, which spews them out on to an island or islands, whence they fly to the mainland; but he had a good word to say for modern science. 42. The heir apparent left Riyadh a day after the King and accompanied him to Jedda. He, too, received the foreign representatives on the 25th February. It is noteworthy, as a sign of his enhanced position, that he did not hold his reception at the King’s palace, but independently at the Kandara villa, which is often used for ceremonies, &amp;c. The Amir Feisal and some of the junior princes were also in attendance on the King, but none of His Majesty’s brothers apparently. 43. Fuad Bey Hamza paid few visits to Jedda during the month. Sheikh Jamil Daud (paragraph 2 of the last report) has taken up his duties at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 44. No news of importance reached the Legation regarding the situation in the provinces. The Mecca and Jedda authorities continued to pursue actively and with some harshness the measures against potential undesirables, which were mentioned in paragraph 6 of the report for January. Late in February reports were afloat of the movements in various directions of suspect Yemenis. These reports and the prospect of a large Yemeni attendance at the pilgrimage (see paragraph 73) created a good deal of uneasiness among the inhabitants of Mecca. The gossips also reported the King to be nervous and full of precaution, but there is no present reason for believing this talk.2 45. There have been signs of considerable rivalry between the Amir Feisal and the Minister of Finance. The struggle appears to turn partly on the wish of each of them to control both the army and the police. The reorganisation of the former is at present in the hands of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman as Deputy Minister for Defence. The police are under the Amir as Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. The roots of the quarrel probably go much deeper. 46. Nothing was seen in Jedda of the Saudi Air Force. It is reported the student aviators in Italy have completed their training and are coming back. It is also said that the Saudi Government or the Arab Aeronautical Society (paragraph 81 of the report for March 1935) intend to buy two aeroplanes for civil flying, which, with that presented by the French Government (see below), will make three available for this purpose. 47. Two ‘ crimes passionnelswere reported from Mecca. In one case a pilgrim woman from the Punjab was stated to have been the victim of a murderous attack by a fellow pilgrim, a rejected lover. The other was that of a Syrian friend of Fuad Bey Hamza, who was alleged to have murdered his wife and taken refuge with Fuad Bey. Very embarrassing for a junior statesman, if true. 48. A local merchant, likely to be well informed, stated on the 11 th February that the new rials ordered by the Saudi Government (paragraph 10 of the last report) were to be similar in everything except the superscription to the Indian rupee. He added that they would be exchangeable at 20 to the gold pound. He thought that the quantity ordered, 1 million rials, would suffice for all require ments, and that the present rials would probably be withdrawn. 49. Early in the month there were further rumours of mishaps, &amp;c., to the prospecting parties of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (paragraph 7 of the last report). All of them, including that of the death of the Islamised Dutchman Van de Poll, proved to have been false or exaggerated. Mr. Twitched goes his energetic way regardless of everything. It appears that the prospecting party which he sent to Taif early in February is to investigate the whole of the southern portion of the conceded area. 50. The hostility excited in certain quarters by the granting of the mining- concession to a non-Moslem syndicate has had repercussions in India. Ibn Saud’s action has been criticised in the press there and by a body called the Ahrar-al- Islam, who decided to send a deputation on pilgrimage to lay their views before the King. There appear, however, to be differences of opinion among the persons in India who have interested themselves in the matter. When the Ahrar deputation arrived in Jedda on the 27th February, there were on board the same ship others who had come to combat their efforts to convince the King of the wrongness of “ selling the Holy Land to the British.” 51. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company, having resumed the work on their first well in the Jebel Dhahran, had reached a depth of 2,365 feet just before the 24th February. The second well, mentioned in paragraph 8 of the last report, lies 1,800 metres south and 900 metres west of the first in the same Jebel, which is not a single peak, but an “ anticline ” measuring roughly 10 miles by 5. This well had reached a depth of some 700 feet by the end of the month. 52. The French group mentioned in paragraph 112 of the report for April are said to be still interested in the Jedda-Mecca railway scheme. 53. The account of Talaat Pasha Harb's projects, which was summarised in paragraph 11 of the last report, appears to have been exaggerated or, at least, premature. The enterprises most definitely in view are now believed to be the provision of electricity and a house-water supply in Mecca. The Pasha has not been able to arrange this year for his hoped-for air service for pilgrims between Jedda and Medina, but four or five aeroplanes, probably carrying pilgrims, were expected to arrive in Jedda from Egypt on the lst&gt;-2nd March. 54. Talaat Pasha Harb was stated in February to have given two cars, a motor cycle and other gifts to the Saudi First Aid Society (paragraph 261 of the report for August). 55. Little progress has been made with the urban development of Jedda mentioned in paragraph 13 of the last report, but some levelling, possibly to provide the site of a cafe, was done at one end of the “ Champs Elysees ” and it looked on the 29th February as though preparations were being made to prolongthe avenues at the other. Work on the new buildings on the quay (paragraph 24- of the last report) continues desultorily. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 56. Full information is not available in Jedda regarding the treaty negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The draft mentioned in para graph 14 of the last report was modified in a manner which removed many of the British objections to it. It is not clear, however, how far both sides were parties to the new draft communicated to Sir G. Clerk Kerr on the 4th February. Anyhow, Fuad Bey Hamza informed Sir Andrew Ryan on the 26th February that no final agreement had been reached and that as none could now be reached before the Moslem festival beginning on the 4th March, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had been given leave to proceed to Syria. The treaty could not, therefore, be concluded for some time; “ if ever 'or “ if at all ' Fuad Bey added significantly. The idea that Nuri Pasha should visit the Hejaz for the pilgrimage has lapsed, not necessarily because of the delay in the negotiations so much as because of injuries sustained by his son in a flying accident, which caused the Pasha to desist for a time from official work and finally compelled him to take his son to London for treatment. 57. The Saudi press stated on the 21st February that 1,054 pilgrims had arrived by the Nejef-Medina motor route. It is not known how much the track has been improved in Saudi territory. The brother of the Nawab of Rampur (see paragraph 75 ) was so much impressed by the difficulties of the route that he contemplated taking his party back to India by sea. Another pilgrim compared the Saudi rolling-stock from Medina on very unfavourably with the Iraqi cars used as far as Medina. 58. According to information from Koweit Ibn Saud’s visit to the sheikh was a great success and his lavishness was much appreciated. He is said to have married two new wives there, including the lowly but beautiful daughter of his own commercial agent. It was learnt from Saudi sources that the King was greatly pleased with his reception, and had instructed his Ministry for Foreign Affairs to do everything possible to expedite a settlement of the blockade question. According to a telegram from Koweit dated the 29th February, the sheikh is prepared to accept in principle the Saudi suggestions made to Sir Andrew Ryan in Riyadh (paragraph 401 of the report for December). 59. There have recently been signs of trouble in regard to the lie of the frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz. On the 6 th January the Saudi Government complained of visits by the Transjordan Desert Patrol to various places, which they alleged to be in their territory. The Legation could not identify these, blit they seemed to be in the Jebel Tubaik area. The Saudis again pro tested on the 1 st March about alleged encroachments at two places even more difficult to locate. On the other hand, information was received from Transjordan during the month regarding the proceedings of Saudi authorities at various places in territory claimed as Transjordanian, more particularly in the area east of Aqaba. 60. It was announced on the 21st February that the commissions appointed to delimit the Saudi-Yemen frontier (paragraph 395 of the report for December) had completed their task. It is understood that the delimitation applies to the whole frontier laid down in article 4 of the Treaty of Taif and that maps have been prepared, although they are probably more in the nature of sketches than of real maps. The press announcement emphasises the complete harmony which prevailed. This is borne out by private information, except that one of the commissioners told a member of the Legation that there had been much difficulty in adjusting claims and counter-claims by inhabitants of the frontier area. The same informant was eloquent about the fertility of Najran, but deplored the sloth of the inhabitants. He stated that the authorities there were interesting themselves in archaeological research. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 61. No progress was made during the month with the negotiations of any of the major outstanding questions between His Majesty’s Government in the United [656 gg— 1 ] .24 Kingdom and the Saudi Government. The w^ ^ ess of maU,^ a ^ for the opening of the Government of on the 9th February, completed early m the monthand th e t0 Fua d Bey Hamza On the 3rd February Sir Andrew %&lt;«• .poke strong to the dilatory about the attitude of the Saudi Goveinmen aut horities after His Majesty s and apparently obstructive «« ltude , of ‘^^^%“ tn r e&lt; ru i a tions (paragraph 19 Government had accepted the application , j^ge^g t0 have produced of the last report). .

IV.— Miscellaneous. T i in paragraph 64 the French sloop Bougainville arrived in Jedda from Kodeida on the 11 th February. She left next day. . ■ ® climate of Jedda was very variable during the month. Parts of it were excellent, e.g., after another great rainstorm on the 2 nd February. The unusua rams ol this winter have made the wilderness even more verdant than last &gt;eai. i any or the elements of a positively pastural scene can be observed within d or 4 miles of the town. A/r at num h er of huropean visitors during the month included Mi\ Maxwell Darling (paragraph 41 above), who arrived on the 21st February am is s aymg m the Legation. He hopes to explore the coastal area southward as tar as Jizan and perhaps further. 72. On the 21st February the Umm-al-Qura put the number of sea-borne pilgrims up to date at 20,414. No later figures have appeared in the press, but the total should well exceed 25,000. As regards arrivals by the motor route rom iMejef, see paragraph 57 above. Twenty-five Indians are known to have Ta\e led by it and there may have been more. According to information from -Bagdad DO Afghans were waiting at Nejef towards the end of January to use the route. P^£&gt; iams ’ especially those of the poorer class, have encountered unusual difficulty this year. Apart from the measures mentioned in para graph 44 above the baudi authorities have enforced rigorously the rule against proceeding to Medina on foot and the rule that the bulk of the charges for the pilgrimage must be paid before leaving Jedda. The enforcement of the rule against pedestrianism seems to have led to one serious fracas at or outside Rabigh late in January. Various versions of the affair gained currency, but the suggestion that some pilgrims had been shot down was probably exaggerated. Floods on the road from Rabigh to Medina also caused difficulty and probably some loss of life, but the details are not certainly known. The Legation had to deal with one case of six pilgrims in Jedda who were unable or unwilling to pav dues and were held prisoner for some days by the local agent of their pilgrim guide. 74. Yemeni pilgrims are expected to be numerous this year. It was stated at one moment that the use of the inland route had been prohibited by Ibn Baud and that all pilgums must collect at Jizan. It was said later that permission had been given for 7,000 to travel overland from Khamis Musheyt near Abha. 75. The most notable pilgrim of the year is the Princess Khadija of Eowpt sister of the late Khedive and widow of the late Abbas Halim Pasha, formerly well known in Constantinople. This lady was a passenger on board the Kawsar of the Misr Navigation Company, which ran on to a reef when attempting to enter the harbour at Jedda on the 28th February. The pilgrims were brought ashore, but the ship was still stranded on the 1 st March. Princess Khadiia'is to proceed to Medina and thence home to Egypt by air. There are a fair number of important, but less conspicuous, pilgrims, including a brother of the Nawab of Rampur, Fawwaz-ash-Shaalan, now the King’s brother-in-law, two sons of the Sheikh of Bahrein and a sister of the Prime Minister of Iraq. 76. It is confirmed (paragraph 36 of the last report) that stringent rules have been adopted to prevent occidentals professing Islam from goino-^to Mecca without satisfying the authorities that they have been JVloslems and practised as such for a stated period. Permission was refused to Mrs. Sterling, who seems to be an unbalanced woman and who left Jedda towards the end of the month Mr. Abdur Rahman McBryan was kept on tenter-hooks until the last moment but was finally authorised to proceed. The European Moslems have included a Greek and a Pole, who, after pestering half the foreign missions and vowin^ that he was neither Jew nor Moslem, was seen gaily starting for Mecca in ihram. 1 &amp;t 77. The position as regards the manumission of slaves was as follows : On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 female. Took refuge in February : 1 female. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : 1 female. On hand at the end of the month : 1 female. The Legation has had to concern itself with the unusual case of an attempt by the former owner of a slave locally manumitted under the auspicies of the Legation to prevent her from marrying the man of her choice. I he case was still pending at the end of the month.indexed In any further communication on this subjecy. please quote &gt;- A No ^ /4/0 md address —not to any person by name J)utw — / “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. r~r /it . 2292 ^ ''V\h DIRFCt II w B THE Under-Secretary of State for FoWifflu—A-ifrtire- -presents his compliments to &lt;&lt;? and, by direction of the Secretaryof State, transmits herewith cop 4 ^^of the under-mentioned paper.

Jedda Report for January 1936. I .—Internal A (fair*. IBN SAUD left Riyadh for Hasa on the 31st December. He returned on the 14th January, but left again for Koweit on the 26th (see below). Apart from a false rumour that the heir apparent was to visit Bahrein, there is nothing to record about the other members of the Royal family, except the Amir Feisal. This prince visited Jedda twice; once when he came for the celebration of the King’s accession on the 8 th January, held receptions, including one for the foreign representatives, and presided at a dinner, to which also they were invited; and again on the 22nd January to present to His Majesty’s Minister the condolences of the Saudi Government on the death of His late Majesty, King George V. Fresh rumours reached the Legation in January of friction between the Amirs Sand and Feisal, especially when the latter was in Riyadh in the late autumn. Inter alia, it is said that the heir apparent is pro-Italian, and that Feisal has gone against the Syrian element and is pro-British. Such tales are worthy of little credence. There may be more truth in a story that Feisal having in the end married the daughter of Nura (paragraph 4 of the report for January 1935), was very discontented when his new mother-in-law came to Mecca, as she made him wait on her like a slave, took her daughter back to Riyadh, and told him he must live three months a year there in future. 2 Fuad Bey Hamza visited Jedda four times. Early in the month it was still thought in certain quarters that he was cast for the role of Governor, combining it with his present post. Fuad Bey himself reacted almost resentfully to this suggestion when Sir Andrew Ryan mentioned it to him at dinner on the 8 th January. There are indications that all is not well between him and the Amir Feisal. It is possible that he is disgruntled over the appointment as legal adviser or assistant in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of a Hejazi, trained in Egypt, named Jamil Daud, which is attributed to the Amir’s influence. 3 The Saudi aircraft made no appearance in Jedda during January. 4. The Saudi Government seem to be still interested in samples of arms, &amp;c. News was received in January that a small parcel of 800 Astra cartridges had been shipped at Antwerp by a Spanish firm of Guernica. 5. A rumour was current early in the month in Mecca that 7,000 troops had been despatched to reduce rebellious tribes in the highlands of Asir. If there is any truth at all in this, it is probably greatly exaggerated. 6 . The Mecca police were very active during the month in measures to reduce the number of possible undesirables and persons without papers, including pilgrims, who have made their way irregularly to the Holy Land. This may be part of a general policy (cf. paragraphs 304 and 340 of the reports for September and October), or it may be due to a desire to obviate any repetition of the attempt on the King’s life on the 15th March. 1935.2 7. Mr. Twitchell, of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, set in motion early in January the four prospecting parties mentioned in paragraph 388 of the report for December. One of them was reported later to have got into trouble, but whether with a car or with Bedouin or with the sticky Amir of Medina is not clear. At the end of the month it was learnt that an English expert, who had been working at the Cot of Gold Mine, was to proceed to Taif, a move which suggests that Mr. Twitchell still has hopes of that area, which was investigated long before he got his concession (see paragraph 167 of the report for May and June 1932), but seemed to have been abandoned. 8 The California Arabian Standard Oil Company (paragraph 389 of the last report) hope soon to start another well not far from the first at Jebel Dhahran. Although the first well has given promising results, the working of it is hampered by difficulty resulting from the relative positions of layers of gas and petroleum. 9. Talaat Pasha Harb (paragraph 390 of the last report) arrived by air on the 9th January, preceded by nine experts who had come by sea and accompanied (at least as far as Wejh, where one of his two aeroplanes broke down) by more. While he was in Mecca, from the 10 th to the 15th January, his aeroplane flew to Medina and back with the Egyptian consul as a passenger. It left Jedda on the 12th and returned on the 14th. An aerodrome had been prepared just outside the town. This first civil flight to one of the Holy Cities of the Hejaz marks an epoch in the history of aviation in Arabia. On the 17th Talaat Pasha himself flew to Medina, accompanied by the Saudi Minister of Finance. He returned to Egypt on the 20 th, leaving behind Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who went off presently to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s gold mine. 10. When Talaat Pasha called at the British Legation on the 16th January, he was not very communicative about his plans generally; but gave Sir Andrew Ryan one or two interesting bits of information. He considered road-making too costly to be undertaken on any great scale in the near future, although the worst parts of the road to Medina might be repaired. He was considering, therefore, the use of vehicles with outsize tyres on the existing roads. He stated categorically that an order for new Saudi riyals (see paragraph 392 of the report for December) had been placed in Birmingham through the inter mediary of his bank and the National Bank of Egypt. 11 . It seems probable that Talaat Pasha’s larger negotiations have advanced considerably. It is doubtful whether agreement has actually been reached on all the subjects enumerated in the Cairo Ahram of the 21st January, although that paper represented them as having been definitely settled, and some of the projects as being already in process of execution. The list is sufficiently interesting, however, if only as a programme, to make the heads worth repro ducing briefly as follows: ( 1 ) Water supply for houses in Mecca; (2) electric lighting of Mecca; (3) workshop in Mecca for various industries; (4) repairs to the sacred precincts at Mecca, with the participation of the Moslem world; (5) asphalt roads between Jedda, Mecca and Medina; ( 6 ) cars with specially adapted wheels; (7) hotels at Mecca and Medina; ( 8 ) air service between Egypt and the Hejaz; (9) air service between Jedda and Medina; (10) orphanage at Medina; (11) hospital for surgical work at Medina; (12) date packing factory at Medina; (13) electrical plant for Medina; (14) supply of silver coinage of fixed value under the joint auspices of the Saudi Government and the Banque Misr. It was stated that work had already been started on (1), (2), (3) and (5); and that ( 10 ) to (13) inclusive would be financed by charitable funds collected in Egypt for the poor of Medina. 12. The Amir Feisal is said to have called for a report on the operation of the legislation against the holding of real property by foreigners in the Hejaz. Little has been heard of this since paragraph 305 of the report for September was written. The Amir would do better to let this sleeping dog lie if it cannot be buried. 13. Urban development is in the air in Jedda. We are promised two new boulevards, and Fuad Bey Hamza, our premier advocate of modernity, is said to have even larger schemes. Meanwhile, January witnessed one achievement, the creation of miniature Champs Elysees, without the trees, outside the Medina gate. Two parallel roads, 200 or 300 yards long, marked out with oil drums and neatly bordered with drains, were made to carry traffic, one-way of course,to and from the desert. They were oddly set with reference to the gate and the} have not so far been surfaced, hut they are. in the words of the Michael and George motto. A uspicium melioris cevi. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 14. It became known at the beginning of the month that, in pursuance oi a recent agreement between the two Governments, Sheikh \usuf Yasin was to proceed from Riyadh to Bagdad in connexion with the Saudi-Iraqi negotiations mentioned in paragraph 394 of the report for December. He reached Bagdad about mid-January. This speeding up of negotiations, which, it was previously supposed, were not to be resumed until Nuri Pasha-as-Said should visit the Hejaz for the pilgrimage, seemed significant enough in itself. Its significance was greatly increased by the receipt of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad, a copy of w T hich reached Jedda on the 19th January. Nuri Pasha had shown to Sir A. Clark Kerr on the 6 th January a draft treaty which, if concluded, would not only create a strong alliance between the parties, but provide for the possible accession of other States, for a good deal of intermeddling in the affairs of other Arab countries and for joint efforts to promote Arab national aspirations. Sir A. Clark Kerr expressed his intention of drawing Nuri Pasha s attention without delay to various grave objections to such a treaty. His Majesty’s Government endorsed his views and pointed out still further objections which should be brought to the notice of the Iraqi Government, without the appearance, however, of any attempt to stand in the way of a legitimate rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The Legation in Jedda is not yet aware of the progress of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s negotiations, or of the reaction of the Iraqi Government to His Majesty’s Government’s remonstrances. 15. It also became known on the 6 th January that Ibn Saud intended to visit Koweit. Such a visit has been vaguely contemplated in principle since the Sheikh of Koweit visited Riyadh in March 1932. Considerable surprise was caused, however, by the sudden announcement that it was to be made at this juncture, and, so far as any British authority knew, at such short notice as to make the King’s attitude seem cavalier. The King, as stated above, left Riyadh on the 26th January. When Fuad Bey informed the Legation of this he said that the King would go easy and would not arrive at Koweit before the 1 st February at the earliest. He, in fact, arrived on the 30th January and was warmly received. No further details of the visit are yet known in Jedda, but it has been made clear that it is to be regarded as one of a private nature. 16. The Legation received on the 12th January translations of letters exchanged in November between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit regarding the enforcement of the local tribal law known as Arafa for the settlement of frontier disputes about camels. It was Ibn Saud who broached the subject and his reasons for doing so were not clear, as the customary law is well- known and commonly applied (cf. paragraph 30 of the report for March—April 1931). The sheikh agreed to the King’s proposal. 17. The Saudi Government published on the 17th January, with the consent of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Bahrein, the notes exchanged on the 16th-l7th November regarding transit dues and connected subjects. HI.— Relations with Rowers outside Arabia. 18. Sir Andrew Ryan had business conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 2nd and 11 th January. At the first meeting he gave Fuad Bey such further reassurance as was possible, without committing His Majesty’s Govern ment to anv definite future course of action, regarding the view they would take^of any attempt by the Italian Government to establish themselves on the Rea Sea coast of Arabia. Fuad Bey again asseverated on behalf of the King that His Majesty had never had and still had not any intention of selling himself to the Italians; but he intimated, more clearly than he or Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had previously done, that the Saudi Government had committed themselves definitely in the autumn to supply the whole of the 12,000 camels mentioned on various previous occasions, and that they were now being subjected to strong Italian pressure to complete the execution of the contract. Both on the 2nd and 11th [631 aa—1] b 24 January the question of a possible Saudi candidature for membership of the League of Nations, which Fuad Bey had broached in earlier conversations, was the subiect of some further discussion between His Majesty s Minister and Fuad Bey, but all discussions so far on this subject have been non-committal on both sides and merely exploratory. . ^ , 19. On the 4th January Sir Andrew Ryan informed Fuad Bey by a peisonal letter that His Majesty’s Government were willing to accept the application ot the regulations mentioned in paragraph 337 of the report for October to the Government of India dispensaries in the Hejaz, but he raised certain points ot detail with the object of making the future position slightly more secure, and more especially of' facilitating the transition from the old system to the new. During the remainder of the month the Saudi Government showed themselves unexpectedly dilatory and almost obstructive, with the result that on the 31st January urgently required medical supplies were still lying in customs and the way was not yet clear for the opening of the no less urgently requited btancn d 1S Pj n a pleasing contrast with the attitude just described, Ibn Saud and his Government manifested the utmost concern and friendly solicitude in connexion with the illness and death of His late Majesty King George V, and the utmost Goodwill towards our new Sovereign. The various courtesies need not be enumerated in detail, but it is deserving of record that, when the Amir Feisal came specially from Mecca on the 22nd January to offer condolences, he came o the Legation'attended by several other high official personages. The visit was returned the same day with equal ceremony, Sir Andrew Ryan being accompamec by all his career staff and all heads of special sections of the Legation. 21 The Saudi Government addressed a note to the British and hrench Legations on the 28th January regarding the means of overcoming the difficulties in connexion with the reopening of the Hejaz Railway as a through line, which were revealed at the conference held at Haifa in October 1 , T 22. The French Charge d’Affaires returned to Jedda on the 18th January, but left again on a quick trip to Sana on the 26th January. He now has the rank of Minister, and will probably present his letters of credence when the King returns to the Hejaz late in February. He will then doubtless notify his colleagues officially of his promotion and of the new status of his post (paragraph ^47 of the report for October). He is to present to the King the Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour, and also, it is less certainly reported, an aeroplane. 23 Apart from the matter of the camels, mentioned m paragraph 18 above, no new'development in Saudi-Italian relations came to the notice of the Legation in January On the 24th January the Italian Charge d Affaires left at shoit notice for'Cairo As M. Persico dislikes Jedda and has for some time shown signs of moral as well as physical discomfort, there is no present reason to suppose that he undertook this journey except to get a ‘’ breather.’’ 24. More importance may attach to the departure for Asmara on the 2bth of M Odello, the Italian contractor and buying agent mentioned on several previous occasions. During the preceding days he had had at least one confabulation with Fuad Bey Hamza, who is widely believed m Mecca and Jedda to be hand in glove with the Italians, despite the assurances to the contrary which he lavished on Sir Andrew Rvan in Riyadh in November. It is ess certainly suggested that Odello’s object in going to Asmara was to get building material needed to carry on work at the Jedda quay, where he is putting up new buildings; also that he will go on from Asmara to Rome. His intention to return to Jedda mav be inferred from the fact that he has left behind his wife and daughter, whose name bv the way, is Ninny, so spelt on his visting card. , 25 News has been received from the Government of British Somaliland through the Foreign Office that Caro Caglieri, who left Jedda in October or earlier (paragraph 351 of the report for that month), aridwassupiioseillo be toil,a- to Berbera had not reached British Somaliland up to the 29th November S 26 Colonel Ibrahim Depui, the honorary Belgian consul returned to Jedda after a very long absence (paragraph 95 of the report for March) on the 24th 2 J 7 a „ U The new Minister of the U.S.S.R. (paragraph 411) arrived in Jedda on the 21st January with a new secretary, also a Moslem like himsell M. Khakimov. who had in the past the name of being remnant, has not yet had time to make himself felt.28. The Egyptian experts, mentioned in paragraph 412 of the report foi December, were doubtless part of Talaat Pasha Harb’s party (paragraph 9 above). As regards quasi-official Saudi-Egyptian relations, it is said that, although the Egyptian consul did not attend the Amir Feisal’s reception for foreign lepie- sentatives on Accession Day and did not fly his flag, he had a long private interview that morning with the Amir. He was present at the dinner at which the Amir presided in the evening, an occasion which is regarded as not strictly official, and was treated in the same way as other foreign heads of mission o minor rank. . , , , 29. Talaat Pasha Harb’s party (paragraph 9) included a bacteriologist, who is said to have been lent by the Egyptian Government to test the water supplv at Mecca and report on means of improvement. 30. The late Persian Minister, who left Jedda last May without oiheially announcing his departure, and who was later known to have been appointed to the new Persian Legation to the Balkan States, at last regularised the position in Jedda by writing from Bucharest to his colleagues here on the 7th January, expressing regret that he could not take leave of them in peison. It was understood last summer that the Legation in Jedda was to be made a dependency of that in Cairo. The late Minister referred in his circular to his successor, “ His Excellency Rad,” but it is not known whether this is the Minister in Cairo, or. contrary to expectation, a new titular of the Jedda post as such. 31. The Ethiopian delegates, poor men, had to pass through Jedda port again on the 8th-9th January, having found at Port Sudan no convenient steamer for Aden other than one that was to call here (see paragraph 414 of the report for December). They did not land. IV .—M iscellaneous. 32. The universal sorrow caused by the death of His late Majesty King George was generally shared in Jedda and in informed circles in Mecca. Among the expressions of sympathy received were many from Indians in both places. The increased use of wireless made it possible to follow the late King s illness closely and to hear the reading of the proclamation of the new King at St. James’s Palace on the 22nd January. No religious service could be held in Jedda, but most of the Legation staff, some members of the European British community and the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires gathered at the British Legation on the 28th January to hear the broadcast of the funeral service at 33 Dr \bdul Hamid, the Indian medical officer of the Legation, returned on the'5th from a period of study-leave in the United Kingdom where he completed a short course of some three months at the School of I ropical Medicine in the University of Liverpool. It is recorded with pleasure that he obtained a well-merited diploma of tropical medicine. 34 The French sloop D’Iberville arrived in Jedda on the 18th January, with Rear-Admiral Rivet on board, but stayed only a few hours after landing the French Charge d’Affaires and a secretary, whom she had brought as passengers from Port Sudan. „ , , . , ,. , - T .- 35 On hearing of the serious illness of the doctor of the Italian Legation on the 4th January, the British Legation offered good offices to facilitate his removal to the Port Sudan hospital if he could not be sent to Massawa. He left for Port Sudan on the 5th January, with the kind consent of the authorities in the Sudan. £ ul . opean visitors of importance are known to have come to Jedda in January A French official of the Credit foncier d'Algerie et de Tumsie arrived for banking purposes connected with the North African pilgrimage, in accordance with standing arrangements. Two unusual pilgrims armed: an American ladv named Sterling from Tangier and a Scotsman named McBryan, who has a Malay wife and is said to have been formerly in the Sarawak sei \ ice Ibn Saud. who has never seen the Islam of Woking and Wandsworth, is reported to have grown even more suspicious than before of converts bound for Mecca, and to have made a new rule that applicants must have been Moslems foi not less than four years and produce a certificate of having lived virtuously in the faith during that period. This is not confirmed.37. The total number of overseas pilgrims up to date was given in the press on the 31st January as 11,003. Three shiploads arrived from India in January, bringing the total carried up to date to 3,835 Indians and non-Indians. Two hundred and sixty-nine Malays have arrived so far. 38. On the 3rd January, as the result of an exchange of views with the Legation, the Saudi Government published an official dementi of a peculiarly pernicious report published in India, to the eftect that Ibn Saud had invited 1,000 Indians to make the pilgrimage as his guests and had promised to pay all expenses from landing to re-embarkation. This was taken up by the organisers of the Khaksar movement, encouraged by Ismail Ghuznavi. and presumably other seditionists. The propagators of the lie persisted in it after the Government of India had published a denial based on the result of oral enquiries in Jedda some time ago. Hence the need for a completely authoritative further contradiction. 39. A movement, not yet very coherent, is on foot to merge the golf course at Jedda, which is not officially a club, in a general sports club with European and some native participation. The idea of a social club even has been whispered. These signs of the growing community spirit in Jedda must be regarded with misgiving in view of the sad fate of the Jedda club founded for recreational purposes in 1930 and liquidated, to the relief of all concerned, in January 1932. 40. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Took refuge in January : 1 male, 1 female. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. Left voluntarily : 1 male. On hand at the end of the month : 1 female. 41.

Ramadan, which had begun on the 28th November, lasted until the 2 /th December. Ihus the ensuing Moslem festival followed immediately on Christmas, a fact which intensified the general holiday feeling in Jedda. These facts contributed to the calm which prevailed throughout the month. So far as is known, the King and the Heir Apparent did not stir out of Riyadh. The Amir leisal stayed there, contrary to expectation, until after Sir Andrew Ryan s departure, but he left early in the month and got back on the 9th to Mecca, where he has since remained. Fuad Bey Hamza also left Riyadh early in December, but he visited Hail and Medina and did not arrive in Jedda until the 20 th, having been delayed on the road from Medina to Jedda by heavy rains He stayed in Jedda until the 22nd and then went on to Mecca. He did not return up to the end of the month, but his voice was heard on the telephone. There is joy in the Hamza family over the birth of a son to Fuad Bey at Beirut on or about the 17th December. 385. No internal events of political importance came to the notice of the Legation during the month. It is expected that, when the King visits Hasa early m January, he will confirm Sand, the son of the late Abdullah-bin-Jiluwi (paragraph 359 of the last report) as successor to the governorship. He was Acting Governor when Sir Andrew Ryan passed through in November, and created on him a most unfavourable impression, but, as this was due partly to a horrible squint and partly to manners which may have been due to awkwardness, it is too soon to judge of his capacity. 386. A Saudi aeroplane from Taif visited Jedda at the beginning of the month, but stayed only a few days. 387. It was reported on good authority early in the month that the Saudi Government had received by a ship which arrived on the 11 th December samples of pistols from the Steyr- 8 olothurn Waffen-A.G. of Zurich. It was suggested that these would be followed by samples of rifles and machine guns. 388. The December calm'did not infect Mr. Twitchell of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (paragraph 362 of the last report). He dashed hither and thither with amazing energy during the greater part of the month, reinforced from the 11 th December onward by his wife, who arrived in Jedda on that dav Mr. Van de Poll returned from leave on the 15th December, and at least three new experts also arrived during the month. It is becoming urgent to determine the areas which can be worked profitably, as they must be fixed, and subsidiary exploitation companies formed, within two years of the coming into force of the original concession. It appears to be intended to form a subsidiary in the near future for the Mahd adh-Dhahab. where some twenty-five Europeans or [606 dd— 1 ] BAmericans and over 700 workmen are already employed. I here is much prospecting to be done elsewhere, and at the end of the year arrangements were being made for four distinct units to explore the districts of ejh and Y anbu, and two others more difficult to identify. There is reason to believe that difficulty ha» arisen with the Saudi authorities over at least one of the latter, owing to a doubt as to whether it is in the area covered by the original concession, in defining which there was apparently some error due to a miscalculation of the position ox the Mahd. 389. The local papers continue to publish optimistic accounts of the progress of the oil-diggers in Hasa. One of the authorities quoted is Seyyid Hashim (paragraph ’223 of the report for July), who has recently been back in the Hejaz. 390. Tala at Pasha Harb (paragraph 325 of the report for October) is expected to revisit Jedda, again by air, early in January. It seems fairly certain that his conversations with the Saudi Minister of Finance, when the latter visited Egvpt, have led to business. The Pasha himself said in a statement to the Egyptian press, published in A l Ahram of the 13th December, that arrangements had been made to repair certain roads, notably that between Safa and Marwa in Mecca, and to build an embankment there to protect the Haram from floods, and that permission had been given for the conveyance of pilgrims to Medina by air. He referred also to new financial arrangements for Egyptian pilgrims, but not to a concession, which he apparently hopes to obtain, for the provision of a public electricity supply at Mecca. . . . 391. ' The further parcel of 400.000 rupees mentioned m paragraph 364 of the last report duly arrived from India in the first week of December. The purchase in India is understood to have been financed by Haji Abdullah AH Reza and Co. 392. The value of the Saudi rial has been fairly well sustained since para graph 290 of the report for September was written. It declined somewhat in the course of Ramadan, contrary to the usual movement. Nothing more has been heard of the proposed importation of £90,000 worth of rials from London, but there are rumours of new rials being provided by the Banque Misr or by the Italians. . . . ^ _ T ~ 393 . The new 7 X-ray plant mentioned in paragraph 221 of the report tor July was on its w 7 ay to Riyadh when Sir Andrew Ryan's party passed through Ashaira on the 2nd December. II —Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 394. A report from Cairo that a treaty of alliance had been concluded between Iraq and Saudi Arabia was promptly contradicted in Bagdad, where it was admitted that negotiations of more moderate scope were in contemplation. See the Times of the 3 rd and 4th December. It was known from more confidential sources that Nuri Pasha was thinking of visiting the Hejaz in February-March, but the fact that on the 31st December Sheikh Yusuf Yasin unexpectedly applied for a visa for Palestine, with a view to proceeding thither via Iraq, suggests that it may be intended to conduct the next stage of the negotiations at Bagdad. 395 The one commission known to have proceeded to the Saudi-Yemen frontier (paragraph 366 of the last report) to take part in the delimitation of it consists of Sheikh Muhammad Suleyman and Talaat Wafa. They weie apparently in Najran on the 27th December but no news of the progress made with the (delimitation is available. , . . . , 396. Further enquiries have convinced the British authorities concerned that no aircraft from Transjordan can have entered Saudi Arabia in August as alleged by the Saudi Government (paragraph 331 of the report for October). The Saudi Government are being so informed. , ^ , i 397 . As regards Saudi relations wuth Koweit see paragraph 401 below. HI .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 398 As no full information regarding Sir Andrew Ryan's proceedings was available when paragraph 367 of the last report was written, a summary account is oiven here. Leaving C airo on the 11th November, he was conveyed in airciaft of°the R.A.F. to Bagdad, arriving the same evening; to Koweit on the 14th November; and to Bahrein on the l(th November. At all these places heexchanged views on matters of common interest and at Bahrein he conferred with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who had come from Bush ire. He crossed to Uqair on the 20th November in a launch provided by the Saudi Government and reached Hofuf by car that evening. He stayed that night in the citadel at Hofuf and, though received very scurvily by the Acting Governor, Saud-bin-Jiluwi, was excellently looked after by Sheikh Muhammad-at-Tawil, Director of Customs, &amp;c., in Hasa. The three days’ car journey to Riyadh was arduous and damaged Sir Andrew Ryan slightly, though Captain de Gaury, who accompanied him throughout the journey from Cairo to Jedda, arrived iniact. 399. The Minister and his party, reinforced at Riyadh by Mr. A. C. Oppenheim and Mr. C. Ousman, from the Legation in Jedda, stayed in a new annex to the Badia Palace some four miles from Riyadh, from the 23rd to the 29th November. They were treated with the utmost consideration by the King, the Crown Prince and the other Saudi personages, who included the Amir Feisal, Fuad Bey Hamza and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. On the 25th November Sir Andrew Ryan presented to Tbn Saud in an official manner the Insignia of an Honorary Knight Grand (Toss of the Bath. The King expressed his gratitude in cordial terms. At two other audiences, the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers was discussed, but Ibn Saud left the details of that question and all other business discussion to Fuad Bey. 400. Sir Andrew Ryan was authorised to lay before the King a new and generous proposal by His Majesty’s Government for the settlement of the frontier question. His Majesty recognised the good spirit animating this proposal but rejected it and asked for more. He was peculiarly insistent on his claim to the Jebel Naksh in the south-west of the Qatar Peninsula. 401. Two other questions outstanding between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Government were the Koweit Blockade (paragraph 335 of the report for October) and a proposed settlement regarding slavery, which would pave the way for a prolongation of the validity of the Treaty of Jedda. It need only be recorded that Fuad Bey abandoned the position that a guarantee by the Koweit Government to prevent all smuggling must be a conditio sine qua non of any agreement to terminate the blockade. He asked for other guarantees in addition to those already offered by Koweit. 402. On the 28th November Fuad Bey engaged Sir Andrew Ryan in a long conversation about the position of Saudi Arabia vis-a-vis Italy and Great Britain respectively. The essential part of what he said was that the Ita^an Government had made a proposal to the Saudi Government, amounting to the offer of a very- large gift, mostly in the shape of arms; that Ibn Saud suspected Italian policy profoundly and had no mind to accept unless he must do so for safety’s sake; but that he needed reassurance under stated heads as to what support he could expect if Italy menaced Arabia, i.e., as was later elucidated, menaced Saudi Arabia directly or indirectly by action in the Yemen. 403. The Legation party left Riyadh early on the 29th November and reached Jedda without difficulty on the 3rd December. The only incident worth recording in a short summary is that the Minister of Finance, who was still in charge of Fuad Bey’s post at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, came out from Mecca to Sharayya to greet the Minister. 404. This unusual journey did much both to emphasise the special nature of Ibn Sand’s relations with His Majesty’s Government, in spite of all differences, and to increase personal touch between British authorities on both sides of Arabia. 405. The results of the business conversations at Riyadh were reported in a comprehensive series of telegrams and despatches to the Foreign Office after the return of the party to Jedda. The most immediate subject for consideration has naturally been that mentioned in paragraph 402 above. The assurances desired by Ibn Saud would, if given, amount to an undertaking to protect Saudi Arabia and the Yemen against an Italian menace in all contingencies. This could not be given, but on the 22nd December Sir Andrew Ryan made, under instructions, a statement to Fuad Bey designed to reassure the King as far as possible and to warn him of the danger of committing himself to the Italian Government. 406. Fuad Bey gave as a reason for delaying his return to Jedda his wish to postpone any reply to the Italian offer until His Majesty’s Government had had time to consider the King's representations. There was,’ in fact, no sign during December of any developments in Saudi-Italian relations. [606 dd— 1 ] B 2m nm 4 407. The staff of the Italian Legation was strengthened on 22nd December by the arrival of Comm. L. F. Bellini, a senior member of the dragoman service of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, a gentleman who, after long service in Egypt and Tunis, has been employed for five years at Bagdad. 408. On the 24th December the Italian Legation distributed tree copies of an Arabic paper appearing in Tripoli. Al-Adl of the 23rd November. This is noteworthy as a first example of overt local propaganda in Jedda. 1 he issue circulated by the Italian Legation contains matter designed to glorify the treat ment accorded to Islamic institutions, including schools, in Libya, and also contains a strong and calumnious attack on British policy in Egypt. 409. It may be observed that the Italians in Jedda have been at pains to maintain punctilious relations with the British. We never speak about war or Geneva. There are perhaps slight signs of fundamental reserve on the part of the Italian Charge d'Affaires, but the Odellos are all things to all men. If Mr. Odello is not an inspiring figure on social occasions, his wife and daughter are very much in the picture and are cultivated by all without political prejudice. It is even said that one non-Italian young gentleman has been questioned by Mme. Odello as to his intentions in regard to her daughter ; but it must be admitted that he is the citizen of a State which does not belong to the League of Nations. 410. The French Charge d'Affaires still tarries in Syria. It is probably for this reason that no official announcement has been made locally of the elevation of his consulate to the status of a Legation, although this was provided for in a French law of last July. 411. The Soviet Minister, accompanied by his wife, left Jedda for good on the 15th December, bequeathing the sinecure of doyen of the diplomatic body to Sir Andrew Ryan. Of all the Russians enumerated in paragraph 29 of the report for January, only one male remains to sweep and garnish the Legation for M. Khakimov, who preceded M. Turakoulov as consul-general in Jedda and who after an absence of eight years is now to succeed him as Minister. 412. The local press announced on the 24th December the arrival at Medina early in Ramadan of a party of Egyptian experts to carry out repairs in the Ha ram. 413. That very devout Moslem, the Afghan Minister, moved to Mecca for Ramadan, soon after the arrival recorded in paragraph 376 of the last report. 414. Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned to Sir Andrew Ryan at Riyadh the negotiations with Ethiopia referred to in paragraph 372 of the last report and earlier. It appeared that the Saudi Government were inclined to place relations with Abyssinia on a treaty basis by an exchange of notes, if not by a treaty of friendship, subject to some doubt lest this should be construed as an unneutral act. Meanwhile, the Ethiopian delegates were kept waiting in Jedda until Fuad Bey got back. They are an amiable but uncommunicative pair and it is not yet known what passed after Fuad Bey's return. They left Jedda on the 29th December. IV .—M iscellaneous. 415. H.M.S. Weston, Commander J. H. Bowen, arrived in Jedda on the 4th December and left on the 6 th. A French warship, the sloop Bougainville, arrived almost simultaneously with H.M.S. Weston on the 4th December, but stayed one day longer. 416. Lady Ryan returned to Jedda, via Port Sudan, on the 11 th December. Captain de Gaury left the same day on termination of his appointment as honorary attache. 417. Mr. and Mrs. Philby reached Jedda on the 10th December, thus completing a very remarkable car journey from England, via France, Spain, Tangier and overland to Egypt. Damascus, Hail and Riyadh. Some anxiety was felt regarding their safety, when it was thought that they were several days overdue at Hail, but Mr. Philby scouts the idea that there was any real delay. 418. The annual handicap Golf Tournament for the “Agent's Tankard/' presented by Mr. W. L. Bond, when he held the post of agent and consul in 1929-30, was played on the 19th December and the three following days. Several of the sixteen entrants were hampered by the rule that no handicap may exceed 36, but the Dutch Charge. M. Adriaanse, one of the 36-men, won the cup, with Lady Ryan (24) as runner-up.419. December was marked by some very hot weather and by unusual rain storms, one on the 18th December, following on dust storms and generally unsettled weather, another on Christmas night and Boxing Day. The rains were followed by very pleasant cool spells but the earlier part of the month did much to justify the following quotation from Doughty on the Legation Christmas card :— “ I asked what were the heat of Jidda? ‘ Ouf,’ he answered, 1 insuffer able. ‘ Khalil hast thou not heard what said Saud-bin-Saud when he laid siege to Jidda (1803), and could not take the place : ‘ I give it up then, I cannot fight against such a hot town ; surely, if this people be not fiends, they are nigh neighbours to the devil.’” 420. 1 he remains of an elderly Italian passenger were landed for burial in the European cemetery at Jedda on the 28th December. Mr. A. C. Oppenheim represented His Majesty’s Minister at the funeral, a gesture for which the Italian Charge expressed no little gratitude. 421. I he local press announced on the 27th December that the number of pilgrims who had arrived by sea up to date was 6,420. It is thought that the total number of overseas pilgrims to stand on Arafat on the 2nd or 3rd March will fall short of that of last year. It is noticeable that the Indian ships have brought far fewer pilgrims from Afghanistan and Central Asia, who are apt to be early comers, than had arrived at the same period of the season in recent years. Rumours of war do not, however, seem to be affecting the movement of pilgrims towards the Red Sea as much as might have been expected. 422. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Took refuge in December : Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : Nil. oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). ^ 1 r r JL « • December 23, 1935. _ CONFIDENTIAL. v 7 9 Q Section 2.

I bn Saud, who had been hunting early in November at Rumah, Mawahiya and the Dahna, received as his guest on the 23rd November Sir Andrew Ryan, who remained in the Nejdi capital until the 28th. His Majesty’s Minister, whose movements are recorded in greater detail below (paragraph 367), conveyed to Riyadh and presented to Ibn Saud the robes and insignia of the G.C.B., conferred by His Majesty King George. 357. Amir Feisal remained in Riyadh during the month in order to be present during the visit of Sir Andrew 'Ryan. Fuad Bey Hamza, who returned from abroad on the 4th November by Italian ship, left Mecca for Riyadh on the 17th November, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. accompanied by Tewfik Hamza (who was to meet His Majesty’s Minister on his arrival at Uqair in Hasa) having preceded him by a week or more. 358. During the absence of virtually the entire staff of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Riyadh, the Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who himself had visited Riyadh early in the month, was left in charge in Mecca. 359. The death of Ibn Jiluwi, the Amir of Hasa (paragraph 313), evoked numerous expressions of sympathy. Condolences were expressed by the Legation on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, the Government of India, Sir Andrew Ryan, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein. No announcement has yet been made as to Ibn Jiluwi’s successor, although rumour designates either one of the King’s sons or a son of the late Amir. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires early in the month, mentioned the latter possibility. 360. The internal situation calls for little comment. Four new police posts were established at (a) the junction of the roads between Ru-al-Kuhl and A1 Jahum; (b) Qoaz-al-Makasa on the Lith road; (c) Zima; and (d) Kar, for the purpose of frontier control and the control of illicit arms traffic. No untoward incidents have been reported during the month. The prices of food-stuffs, which recently rose considerably as a result of disturbing news of the Italo-Abyssinian situation, have now returned to normal, it is somewhat prematurely claimed in the Mecca press, owing to the action taken by the Saudi authorities. 361. (Paragraph 228 of the report for July.) Sheikh Abdur Rauf-as- Sabban is believed to have returned for a while to Iraq. Meanwhile, an even ; more notorious anti-Saudi intriguer, Seyyid Muhammad Tahir-ad-Dabbagh, is reported in the Umm-al-Qura of the 22nd November to have made his peace with ! Ibn Saud, under the amnesty to political offenders of last January. [581 z—2]- --r- mmmmami 2 - ^ 8 eyyid Muhammad lahir recently visited the King at Riyadh and was said to, have been received with kindness and hospitality. 362. The development of the operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining ?/ 11 C ri ca ^ e ’ recorded last month at paragraph 321, continues apace. Mr. Twitched s British, American and Swedish confreres have been joined by a Dutchman, a Greek with a certain Russian background, and a German, accompanied by his dachshund. The Swedish diamond-drillers are now working mgln and day; further work on the road is in progress; a site of some 300 yards by 150 yards has been secured by the syndicate about a mile north of Jedda, where work on the construction of a walled compound to contain dwelling-houses! store-houses, garages, &amp;c., has already commenced. A pier, not far removed from this site, running out to deep water, has also been planned. Further changes have taken place in the local representation of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company during the month. Mr. W. J. Lenahan returned from Hasa on the 24th November via Egypt, and Mr. R. Lebkidker left on the 28th by the same route for a few weeks’ visit to Hasa before returning to Condon early next year. Mr. Lenahan stated that the prospects of winning oil in Hasa in commercial quantities appear favourable, as at the present stage o/boriim- 100 barrels a day are being obtained, whereas when at the same depth of boring in the adjacent successful wells in Bahrein only a smear of oil was obtained 364. A further consignment of 30,000 rupees (vide paragraph 323 of the last report) arrived from Bombay on the 13th November, making a total of 1,630,000 rupees imported through Jedda since May last. A further consignment of 400.000 rupees is expected shortly. 365. The following items of legislation have been published in the press r, &gt; j, , dlirin £ the month : (^ Regulations concerning the prohibition of the import, sale, &lt; d (c t n carrying and possession of arms, other than sporting guns; (b) regulations / . concerning the practice of medicine in Saudi Arabia; (c) regulations concerning 1 ^5 ID 0 T 1 S 0 r s.

The Umm-al-Qura of the 22 nd November contained an announcement that, m accordance with the provisions of article 4 of the Treaty of Taif arrangements had now been made for the delimitation of the Saudi-Yemeni frontier Two commissions had been appointed by the Saudi Arab Govern ment, and would work jointly with similar bodies appointed by the King of the \ emen. One of the commissions had already left for the frontier area. No names of the members of these commissions have as vet been made public. ypr ri v-A HI -—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 367. Sir Andrew Ryan, after travelling by air from Egypt via Bagdad, Koweit and Bahrein, as stated in -paragraph 334 of the last report, arrived at Riyadh by way of Uqair, where he was met by Tewfik Hamza, brother of . uad Bey Hamza, on the 23rd November. He left Riyadh, where he was joined hy the Legation party from Jedda, which had arrived on the 20th, on the 28th and is expected to reach Jedda on the 3rd December. During his stay of five days as Ion Saud s guest, His Majesty s Minister was to engage in conversations on some of the more important questions outstanding between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arab Government. 0 . .^ s already recorded above. Fuad Bey Hamza, Saudi delegate to the Hejaz Railway Conference (paragraph 338), returned to Jedda at the beginning of the month. His technical advisers returned several days later. So far no official account has been received here of the proceedings of the conference. ^b9. (Reference paragraph 340.) On the 4th November the Political Resident at Bushire reported that 409 destitute Indian pilgrims had arrived at Bahrein from Hasa, and were to be evacuated to Karachi on the 11 th. As nothino- further has since been received on this subject, this has presumably been successfully carried out. 370. Conversations regarding the draft notes embodying the results of the Bahi cm Conference (paragraph 341 of the last report) were continued during the month with Sheikh 1 usuf Yasin, and, upon his return from abroad, with3 Fuad Bey Hamza, regarding certain minor questions of interpretation. After a further reference to His Majesty’s Government for instructions, the exchange of notes took place, by Legation and Saudi notes, dated the 16th and 17th November respectively. * 371. The more sinister hypotheses that were built, in the local imagination, j on the developments in regard to the Italian consignment of munitions of war, \ described at paragraph 342 of the last report, were not realised, for the Italian mechanics returned to Jedda within a day or two and left for Massawa on the 4th. It would appear that a demonstration of the capabilities of the munitions was , staged at Ashaira for the benefit of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and Saudi officers, j who, it is stated, were well pleased with the performance of a fast light tank, apt over any sort of rough going, a four-barrelled anti-aircraft gun, light field guns, I and smaller arms. A less happy impression was created by the huge Fiat truck and trailer, which spoiled the Roman triumph by experiencing considerable difficulty over the rough going of the Saudi desert, and which, incidentally, is now employed in Jedda busily carting stones, after rumours had been current that it had been acquired by the Mecca Municipality as a refuse vehicle. The j report of the imminent shipment of 1,000 camels from Yanbu, referred to in last month s report, was premature. They were, indeed, assembled, but remained, like Kipling’s camel, “ ’scruciating idle for nearly three weeks, until finally shipped by the steamship Mouna on the 20th November. It is stated to be strongly rumoured at Yanbu that no further shipments of camels will be permitted. 372. h uad Bey Hamza informed Mr. Calvert on the 11 th November that a communication had been received from the Co-ordination Committee of the League of Nations by the Saudi Government, who had so far found themselves unable to reply. Fuad Bey confessed himseli greatly perplexed by the situation, which he described as one of great uncertainty. He expressed doubts as to whether the Ethiopian mission, at present in this country (paragraph 345), would receive much satisfaction from the Saudi Arab Government, and appeared impressed by the strong protest recently addressed by Italy to Egypt. The Ethiopian mission, indeed, in spite of the desire of Blata Ayeule Guebre to conclude his affairs expeditiously and return to his own country, was still here at the end of the month, awaiting Fuad Bey Hamza’s return from Riyadh. The latter had seen Blata Ayeule Guebre twice before leaving for Rivadh, and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had given an official dinner-party in honour of the mission shortly after its arrival here. The junior member of the mission, described as secretary, is Seyyid Muhammad Mehdi. a young French-university-trained Moslem. 373. The Saut-al-Hejaz of the 26th November contained a communique, received from the Italian Legation, announcing the withdrawal of lira bank-notes for 1.000 and 500 lire. 374. The Italian Legation flew its national flag at half-mast on the 19th, / 20 th and 21 st November, presumably as an expression of Italian feeling at the * imposition of sanctions. 375. The chancelier of the Italian legation, Dottore Mario Ardizzone (paragraph 305 of report for September), left Jedda on the 29th November His successor was expected to arrive on the 1 st December from Bagdad. 376. Other diplomatic moves during the month included the arrival of the Afghan Minister, Muhammad Sadiq-el-Mujadadi Khan, and two secretaries one named Abdel Rahman Raoufi, from Egypt. It would seem that the Afghan Legation here is to be a more parmanent institution (the Minister brought a laroe quantity of luggage with him), and that he has ceased to be accredited to Eo-ypt as well as Saudi Arabia, the Afghan Legation in Cairo having been temporarily closed. M. Ismailoff, secretary in the Soviet Legation, returned from five months’ leave about the 20 th. IV .—M i serf la neons. 377. Mr. H. M. Eyres returned from leave on the 13th November. 378. Pilgrim ships have arrived fairly regularly during the month, chiefly from Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies. Numbers of pilgrims are sh far satisfactory, the total number ot Malay pilgrims registered in the Legation at the end of November being 679, or 62* in excess of the total number from4 Malaya last year. There are reports that this year Banque Misr contemplate sending an aeroplane of Misr Airwork to Jedda, for the purpose of conveying pilgrims Jedda-Medina and back. 379. It is reported that Seyyid Othman-bin-Muhammad-al-Amudi, the president of the Irshad party of Surabaya, arrived here early in November. 380. Signor D. Odello was stated to have secured a number of minor contracts for works of construction locally, and the Fiat truck was most probably engaged in work in connexion with these schemes. 381. It is stated that the decision has been taken by the Saudi authorities to run a second telephone line between Taif and Jedda. This should be useful next summer, as this year the excessive frailty of the single wire has been exasperating, and called forth mild expostulations from His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires to members of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 382. Mr. G. T. Twemlow, of the Shell Company, visited Jedda from the 27th November to the 1 st December, staying with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), Shell agents here. 383. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male. Took refuge in November : Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : 1 male.

Copies have been distributed as in the case of the report for August 1935. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure. Jedda Report for October 1935. I .—internal Affairs. 312. The movements of Ibn Saud have again not been written up in the press, but, according to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, the King has spent a considerable part of the month hunting. Little has been heard of the Amir Saud, except that he is said to be taking lessons in English, and delights to air his few words of that language in conversation with his friends; and Amir Feisal had not returned to Mecca from Riyadh at the end of October. 313. To anticipate the report for next month, on the 1 st November the Legation received a telegram from the Saudi Ministry for Foreign iVffairs fj announcing with regret the death of Abdullah-bin-Jiluwi, the Amir of Hasa and cousin of Ibn Saud. The passing of this trusted kinsman and comrade-in-arms of his early days robs the King of one of the most powerful of his leaders, and one whose legend has been perhaps second only to that of Ibn Saud himself. Upon Hasa and further afield along the Persian Gulf the effect of the withdrawal of this stern and dreaded personality will certainly be far-reaching. 314. Sheikh Abdullah-al-Fadhl was appointed, by Royal decree, to act. during the absence of Amir Feisal, as President of the Council of Ministers, a post he has held on previous occasions. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin continued in charge of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and divided his time between Jedda and Mecca. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman returned from his visit to Egypt and Syria (paragraph 286) on the 20th October, and was accorded a very flattering welcome, especially in Mecca. With the return of his principal assistant, Sheikh Muhammad Surur-as-Saban, a few weeks earlier, the Ministry of Finance is once more at full strength. Sheikh Muhammad Surur was also given a most cordial reception—such is the magic of the Treasury in this little world. 315. Fuad Bey Hamza (paragraph 300) attended the Hejaz Railway Conference at Haifa (see paragraph 338 below), from the 10th-19th October, as Saudi delegate, and was expected by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to return to Jedda early in November. 316. Internally, the situation has remained untroubled. A further shipload of stores left for Jizan by the Al Fath towards the end of the month, but the only movement of troops to come to notice was the arrival of 130 soldiers, in ten motor- lorries, from Medina on the 5th, and their departure for Mecca the following day. There has, however, been much marching, counter-marching, early mornincr tactical exercises and what not. by the small uniformed force forming the Jedda garrison. 317. A well-known Hejazi personage, in conversation here recently immediately upon his return from Riyadh, where he had been the guest of the King, gave an interesting glimpse of 'ibn Sand’s views on the development of a military organisation in this country. The account, which is given for what it [556 s—1] Bis worth, showed the King in a braggart mood, in which he boasted of his power to summon to his court the remotest and most powerful chieftains in his realm by a slave bearing a simple message. He extolled the ease and speed with which he eould mobilise and demobilise, and asked whether anywhere else in the world could an army be assembled so quickly and at so little cost to the State. Why, therefore, should he concern himself to organise his forces on modern lines, as many had urged upon him, and spend millions of rials to little purpose! 318. If there has been any aerial activity, it has been confined to the skies of Taif. One of the White Russian pilots recently went to Egypt and has now returned, having, it is thought, tried to buy spare parts for the W apitis, but with little success. A wrecked plane whose identity is at present doubtful (save that it is apparently not a Wapiti) was brought in to Jedda by lorry from the direction of Rabigh towards the end of the month. It may be an old He Havilland. The Saudi student pilots are still in Italy, the first batch now having graduated as ‘ aviators.’ The Italian Charge d'Affaires admitted in conversation that he had been criticised in Italy for sending them, as apparently the Italians are not impressed. Signor Persico, himself, was rather crushing, for, he said : “ II faut du courage pour voler.” One only had shown any real aptitude. The student pilots, too, were at odds amongst themselves, and had indulged some time ago in an unseemly fracas. 319. Local prices of food-stuffs (paragraph 302 of last report) again rose both in Mecca and Jedda, due to uneasiness at the situation between Italy and Ethiopia. The authorities once more intervened, and a Royal decree was issued, but not published, setting up in each centre a local committee invested with powers to control prices, fix rates of profit, and with judicial powers to inflict punishment. Jedda merchants appealed to Ibn Sand for the cancellation of the decree, and were informed in reply that the operations of the committees would be suspended. In the meantime, the Umm-al-Qura had announced that prices were returning to normal. As a result of the issue of the decree, however, local merchants, it is stated, have cancelled orders for cereals, &amp;c., placed in India. 320. Commencing with the 14th October, the 11 mm-al-Qura has issued daily, except Fridays, a bulletin, at one-half Saudi piastre a time, containing telegraphic news of the situation created by the Italo-Ethiopian conflict. 321. (Paragraph 255 of report for August.) The operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) made considerable strides during October. On the 6 th Mr. Twitchell returned to Jedda accompanied by two Englishmen. Messrs. T. P. Larken and D. L. Gibbs, and six Swedes, the latter having been engaged as expert diamond-drillers. Later, the personnel of the syndicate received further reinforcement on the arrival of two more British employees, Messrs. Dunckley and McDermott, and two Americans. Mr. Larken is understood to be the manager at the mine and Mr. Dunckley to be in charge of the Jedda office, while Mr. McDermott, who is the son of the director of that name (paragraph 229 of the report for July), is a survevor. Mr. C. L. W. Bindloss, the engineer on the Jedda staff of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), has also been given a post under the syndicate. M. van de Poll went on leave on the 9th, and Mr. Bishop, who has been at the mine during the summer, left Jedda on the 23rd on termination of his engagement. A considerable quantity of vehicles, machinery and stores arrived during the month, and great activity has been displayed in transporting much of this material to the mine. Mr. Twitchell has taken a house in Jedda as the permanent headquarters of the concern. Progress has also been made in road-making operations on the alignment Jedda- Asfan-al-Birka-Mahd-adh-Dhahah, but a difficult section beyond Asfan remains to be dealt with. Houses are being built at the mine of local stone. The position of the mine, according to revised estimates, is now thought to be roughly 23 degrees 30 minutes North by 41 degrees East. A company is stated to have been formed and to have been granted an area of one square mile bv the syndicate to prospect. 322. Further references have appeared in the Mecca press that oil has been struck in Hasa. On the 1 st October the Saut-al-Hejaz announced that the daily output was estimated at 116 barrels, and that the company had agreed to commence boring a second well. The same newspaper on the 22nd stated^that the well (the first) had reached a depth of 2,000 feet and that it only remained to bore a further 40 feet. The local staff of the California Arabian’ Standard Oil3 Company recently were understood to consider that the oil so far obtained was not in commercial quantities. 323. (Paragraph 290 of last report.) A consignment of twenty-five cases of silver coins (rupees), estimated to be about 100,000 rupees, was discharged here by the steamship Islami from India on the 8 th. There has been a certain return movement of specie from time to time, but in very small amounts. 324. The Saudi Government have decided to have a condenser plant installed at Jizan, a project which has been under consideration, it is believed, since the late Saudi-Yemen War. Messrs. Gellatly. Hankey and Co. have tendered for the supply of the plant, but the manager recently appeared to think that the practical difficulties of handling and landing the bulky machinery, including a large boiler, i at Jizan would prove a problem. 325. (Paragraph 286 of last report.) On the 1 st October one of the small vessels of the Societe Misr de Navigation maritime landed a consignment of fifty-four barrels of Shell asphalt, intended for an experimental stretch of road way in the vicinity of Jedda. A Greek engineer and an Egyptian, said to represent Talaat Harb Pasha, arrived by the same boat, and a Khedivial Mail vessel also landed, on behalf of the Banque Misr, a mixing-machine for use in road-construction. This development would appear to be the first-fruits of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman s recent activities in Egypt. The two representatives of the Egyptian concern lost no time in getting to work and quickly laid down, immediately outside the Medina Gate of Jedda, a length of about 100 yards of asphalt, without any special preparation of the foundation as far as could be observed. The Greek engineer left again for Egypt a week or ten days later. 326. A proposal has been approved by the King for the collection by a committee of local merchants of one-half piastre miri on each package of merchandise imported through Jedda. The proceeds of this tax are to be devoted to the support of the “A1 Falah ' schools of Jedda and Mecca, hitherto maintained by the AH Ridha family, having been founded, with the help of donations from India and elsewhere, by Hajji Muhammad Ali Ridha. former Kaimakam of Jedda. 327. The Saudi Institution in Mecca intends to include the teaching of English in its syllabus, and the press contained a notice inviting teachers with a knowledge of the language to apply for the post. 328. (Paragraph 291 of last report.) Sheikh Muhammad Tawil returned to Hasa at the beginning of the month, taking with him the newly-appointed personnel recruited in the Hejaz. 329. According to the Saut-al-Hejaz of the 5th October, a Royal commission, including Khalid-el-Qarqani, has been appointed to carry out a thorough investigation of the Posts and Telegraphs Administration. They are stated to have embarked upon their labours. II .—F rentier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 330. (Paragraph 233 of report for July.) The incident of the transgression of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier in July by an officer of the Transjordan Frontier Force, Captain Chamberlain, was closed during the month when His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, in accordance with a promise originally given to the Saudi authorities, informed the Saudi Arab Government of the disciplinary action taken by the authorities in Transjordan. A reply expressing appreciation was received in acknowledgment. 331. The alleged infraction of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier at Alqan by aircraft of the Royal Air Force (paragraph 299) was the subject of further exchanges. The Transjordan authorities, after investigation, replied that no Royal Air Force machine had flown south of Ma'an on the 15th, 16th or 17th August, but the Saudi authorities, not satisfied with this explanation, stated that an aeroplane, although perhaps not Royal Air Force, actually crossed the frontier and requested further enquiries. The question was. therefore, again referred to Transjordan. 332. About the 9th October, Ibn Sand despatched a caravan of motor-cars via Qarayat-al-Melh to Damascus for the purpose of escorting to Riyadh two ladies of the family of Nuri Shaalan. Colonel Mackereth reports that they are the daughters of the late Nawwaf Shaalan and so grand-daughters of Nuri, and adds that the younger is to wed the Amir Feisal (see paragraph 312 above) and [556 s- 1 ] B 2-sr' - ‘i the elder, whose uncle is Sheikh Mithkal-al-Faiz of Transjordan, is to marry Ibn Sand. Reports here mention the Amir Sand rather than the Amir Feisal as the prospective bridegroom of the younger girl. The alliance, entered into with a view to cementing relations with this powerful Ruwalla family, has considerable political significance. 333. Relations with the Yemen call for little comment. The Saudi press, however, continued to reproduce reports regarding the attitude of the Yemen to the Italo-Ethiopian war, and the defensive measures the Yemeni Government are reported to be taking in fortifying certain points on their coast. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 334. Sir Andrew Ryan left England on the 25th October. He is returning to Jedda by way of Riyadh, where he will remain as the guest of the King from about the 22nd-26th November, and will travel from Egypt via Bagdad, Koweit and Bahrein by air. He will be accompanied from Bagdad by Captain de Gaury, and will be met at Riyadh by a party from the Legation consisting of Mr. Oppenheim and Mr. Ousman. Sir Andrew will have a number of questions of importance to discuss with Ibn Saud, further to the conversations which took place in London during the summer with Fuad Bey Hamza. 335. The note to the Saudi Government on the subject of the Koweit blockade, outlined in paragraph 296 of last month's report, evoked a reply as rigidly unyielding as before. Whilst they agreed to the closure of the incident of tlm armed incursion, they rejected the attempt to fasten upon them respon sibility for the present situation. That responsibility must fall on the Koweit Government, for the Saudi Government had in no way sought to interfere in the internal affairs of Koweit. On the contrary, Saudi interests were suffering from the action taken by Koweit. The Saudi note maintained that their demands at the conference were reasonable, and involved sacrifices which the Saudi Government were prepared to face in the interests of a settlement. But no settlement could be contemplated that did not afford an absolute guarantee by Koweit of the entire cessation of smuggling from her territory. The terms of this communication were being studied by the authorities concerned at the end of the month. 336. (Paragraph 297 of last report.) Sheikh Yusuf Yasin replied on the 15th October to His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires' letter regarding the questions of the Qatar oil concession and of the frontier with Saudi Arabia. He was unable to admit that Ibn Saud was bound under the Treaty of Jedda to refrain from direct correspondence with the sheikhs of the Persian Gulf, and his Government could not recognise the legal rights to which His Majesty’s Govern ment now laid claim. The Saudi Government therefore reserved their rights completely, but were prepared to discuss a settlement of the frontiers question in a friendly spirit. To this Mr. Calvert replied suggesting that the matter be reserved for discussion with Sir Andrew Ryan, who was returning from leave shortly with new proposals, a suggestion to which Sheikh Yusuf Yasin agreed. 337. The draft regulations regarding foreign dispensaries, &amp;c., referred to at paragraph 298 of last month’s report, were promulgated on the 4th October, and were to come into force one month after that date. 338. The Hejaz Railway Conference at Haifa (paragraph 300 of last month’s report) opened on the 10th October, with Fuad Bey Hamza as the Saudi delegate. The inspector arrived at Haifa in time for the conference, through the co-operation of the Transjordan authorities, and other Saudis present included Muhammad Kenan, Jedda municipal engineer, and (from newspaper accounts, it would appear) Khalid Bey A1 Hakim. Little news reached Jedda of the fate of the conference, but Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that it had come to an end on the 19th, was pessimistic. He attributed failure to the intransigence of the French author ities and spoke appreciatively of the assistance afforded Fuad Bey Hamza by the authorities in Palestine.’ M. Maigret left Jedda suddenly on the 5th October in response to an urgent summons to be present at Haifa during the proceedings. 339. (Paragraph 303 of last report.) The Saudi authorities still preserve a complete silence over the unofficial Haramayn Waqfs mission. The two members representing Medina who some time ago went to J aif, preparatory it may be5 supposed to leaving for abroad, returned to Medina early in the month. It does not, therefore, appear likely that the mission will be leaving just yet. 340. The number of destitute Indians in Hasa (Paragraph 304 of last report) grew during the month to about 500. The Government of India agreed to their repatriation via Bahrein, and at the end of the month measures were being concerted direct between the Politicai Agent at Bahrein and the Saudi authorities in Hasa for their shipment to India. 341. (Paragraph 158 of the report for May.) The form to which the results of the Bahrein Conference were to be reduced was discussed with Fuad Bey Hamza in London, and Subsequently draft notes were drawn up in the Foreign Office. These were submitted to Fuad Bey, at his own request, after he had left England, for his personal concurrence, but this eventually he felt unable to give. After this unlooked-for delay, His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires was instructed to submit the draft notes formally to the Saudi Government, which was done on the 14th October. On the 19th, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin orally raised one or two points in the draft notes, and at the end of the month further instructions had reached Mr. Calvert in regard to these. 342. (Reference paragraphs 301 and 302.) The month witnessed some piquant developments in the local reactions to the Italo-Ethiopian crisis. On the 3rd October, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, under instructions, informed Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that His Majesty’s Government could not be expected to answer hypothetical questions regarding the effects of closing the Suez Canal, an event which there was no reason to suppose would come to pass, nor was it anticipated that shipping and particularly pilgrim ships would be interfered with in the Red Sea or in the Canal. On the 6 th, the sheikh visited Mr. Calvert to inform him that a consignment of munitions had actually arrived the day before by Italian ship from Italy via Massawa. He represented their arrival as a complete surprise to the Saudi authorities who had been filled with consternation on being informed on the 4th by the Italian Legation of the imminent arrival of the consignment. It was true, said Sheikh Yusuf, that during the Amir Sand’s visit to Italy the subject of a supply of arms had been discussed and that the Saudi Government had agreed to see some samples. But the moment was obviously unpropitious and the Saudis had allowed the matter to drop, until they were so abruptly reminded of the subject by the Italians. The consignment was, after urgent reference to Ibn Saud, allowed to be landed, but was to remain in the Jedda Customs, and a party of nine Italians accompanying the consignment was also permitted to come ashore. The arms, which were consigned by an Italian firm (believed to be Fiat) to Signor Odello, would be regarded as being imported as part of a purely commercial transaction. The sheikh pitched this yarn with something less than his customary self-assurance. Indeed, as the projected arrival of the party of Italians had been rumoured in Jedda several days before they appeared, and as accommodation for them was said to have been reserved in advance in the Government-owned hotel here, and as a number of sambuqs had also been standing by twenty-four hours before the Italian Legation sprang their surprise on the unwitting sheikh, the story did not entirely carry conviction. On the 16th, a large motor-truck and trailer (of Fiat make) arrived by Italian ship from Massawa with, it was reported, two attendant mechanics, and this monstrous vehicle, of a bilious yellow colour, was soon seen and heard in the streets of Jedda. On the 26th. three weeks after being landed, the consignment of munitions was removed from the Customs Department and loaded upon the truck and trailer, and sundry other vehicles, which on the following day took their departure, together with the Italian mechanic-instructors, for a destination which report variously gave as Riyadh and Taif. The truck and trailer, which had some difficulty owing to bad going, returned to Jedda on the 31st, but the personnel, it is believed, remained either at Taif or went on further towards Riyadh. 343. There seems some ground for the conjecture that Ibn Saud was at first unwilling to permit the Italian munitions to be landed, and that he finally yielded to the persuasions of some of his advisers. Opinion in Nejd is stated to be opposed to a policy of traffic with the Italians, as it is in the Hejaz, and members of the Royal family are said to be strongly averse from permitting the sale of camels. Be this as it may, no camels have as yet been seen in Jedda, but j large droves have been reported up-country in the neighbourhood of Shariya and lmmmm T ■H (5 rumours of the embarkation of about 1,000 at Yanbu on the 29th are current. It is of interest to note, however, that one fairly good source, as this report is being penned, states that orders have been issued cancelling this shipment of camels. Whether true or not, it would seem fairly certain that Saudi official circles are at present the prey of very divided counsels. Meanwhile, the Saudi Government have caused to appear in the Egyptian news-sheet, the A hram, a positive statement of this country’s strict neutrality, attributed to an anonymous but well informed source in Mecca. Sheikh Yusuf foreshadowed a declaration of this nature in conversation with Mr. Calvert on the 6 th October, and may be presumed to be the father of this declaration. 344. Popular sympathy locally with Abyssinia is stated to have become vocal on occasion, notably when a crowd listening to a wireless amplification of news of the course of hostilities in Abyssinia could not forbear to cheer the reports of Abyssinian successes. The Italian Charge d’Affaires was thereupon moved to protest to the Saudi Government against this demonstration as contrary to the friendly relations subsisting between the two countries, Saudi Arabia and Italy, with the result that the headmen of quarters received orders to prevent \ any similar occurrence in future. Official frowns, moreover, have been directed . at some of the younger boys of Jedda who, having discovered an exciting new game involving desperate encounters between Abyssinians and Italians, had turned the streets of Jedda into an Ethiopian battlefield. All might have been well if the principal rule of the game had not been that the Abyssinians always won, but this was too much, it was stated, for the Italian Charge d’Affaires, who again appealed to the authorities and sanctions were applied. 345. In view of the statement of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 25th August, recorded at paragraph 268 of the report for that month, that the treaty negotia tions with Abyssinia were being suspended, it was surprising to learn on the 30th October of the arrival of an Abyssinian mission in Jedda. The mission, headed by Blata Ayeule Guebre, has been in the Yemen for the exchange of ratifications of the recently negotiated Yemen-Ethiopian Treaty and has come overland to Taif. Their presence was reported by the Umm-al-Qura of the 31st October. They are being accommodated for the time being at the Kandara Palace, as the guests of the Government. 346. The proposal of the Saudi Government, recorded at paragraph 306 of the report for June, for a postal service between Jizan and Kamaran, has met with the approval of the Posts and Telegraphs Department of the Government of India, and on the 31st October His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires addressed the Saudi Government putting forward certain conditions on which such a service might be established. 347. As already described M. Maigret left on the 5th October to attend the Hejaz Railway Conference at Haifa, and was still away at the end of the month. The official stationery of the French mission here now bears the device '‘Legation de France,” although no official announcement of the change of status has yet appeared. The Netherlands Charge returned from leave on the 27th October. The Turkish Legation has now taken to flying the Turkish national flag on Sundays instead of on Fridays as heretofore, and the Charge has taken unto himself a surname nouveau style. 348. The Egyptian consul has now completed the distribution of Egyptian charity (reference paragraph 242) to the poor of Medina, who have each received a quantity of wheat and a small sum in cash. IV.— Miscellaneous. 349. The first pilgrim ship of the season, to anticipate the report for next month, arrived on the morning of the 1 st November. She was the Teiresias from the Netherlands East Indies and the Straits Settlements, with 558 pilgrims on board. 350. A new Italian doctor Mario Fea arrived in Jedda about the 10th October. 351. (Reference paragraph 309). It has now been learnt that Signor Caro Caglieri has left the country. 352. Government administrations during the month have packed up and returned from Taif to Mecca. Rains are reported from both Taif and Medina.7 3 * 353. The Amir Baud was reported to have commenced laying out a race course at Riyadh, upon the most approved European lines. 354. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male. Took refuge in October : 1 male, 2 females. Manumitted and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : 2 females. Left voluntarily : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : 1 male. 355. The Legation has had the satisfaction of manumitting and repatriat ing a youth, enslaved years ago, whose mother has for some years come regularly from the Sudan on pilgrimage with the object of finding her son. Hearing of this the boy managed to escape to the Legation and, the woman having been traced, the boy has been returned to her. *» oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for September 1935. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the case of the report for August 1935. 284. 1 he King welcomed the Amir Saud upon his arrival at Riyadh, where the Crown Prince was given a warm reception, on the 1 st September, after an absence of more than three months on his European journey. Subsequently, little was heard of the royal movements, and, indeed, reports reached Jedda from Taif that Ibn Saud, for a period, had been indisposed. The Amir Feisal left Taif for Riyadh on the 23rd, after twice postponing his departure. The hardy rumour that he is going there to be married again cropped up, whilst other sources stated that a family conference, similar to one held before the Saudi—Yemen war, had been convened to consider the position of this country vis-a-vis the Italo-Ethiopian crisis. 285. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, apart from two short visits to Taif, remained at Jedda the whole of the month. He had numerous meetings with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, to which more detailed reference will be made later in this report, and was seen in both the more and the less engaging moods of his Syrian soul. He appeared to occupy the position of Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in the continued absence of Fuad Bey Hamza in Syria. 286. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, during the month, moved on from Egypt to Syria. A report in the Saut-al-Hejaz lent some confirmation to reports of his interest in the construction of pilgrim hotels and metalled roads in this country, mentioned in paragraph 253 of the last report. His brother Hamad Suleiman continued to act in his absence as Minister of Finance. 287. The internal situation remained generally tranquil. No further reports of trouble in Najran were received, so that the position there would appear to have been effectively stabilised. Troops, however, were moved south into the Asir Tihama, a mixed force, with supplies, leaving Jedda by the Saudi vessel Al Fath on the 13th for Jizan, or according to one report, for Qunfidha. The Saudi soldiers spent several days in Jedda before their departure, and their new khaki uniforms, of an unfortunate shade of green, attracted some attention. No further contingents are known to have followed, and undue significance is not at present attached to this movement of Saudi forces. 288. The appointments were announced during the month of Sheikh Ahmad- al-Haya as Amir of Turaba in the room of Ibrahim-an-Neshmi, the veteran Saudi soldier, who was appointed Amir of Najran. and left shortly after for his new post. Tahsin Bey, formerly commandant of police in Jedda, was appointed head of the administration of the Ministry of Defence. EASTERN (Arabia). October 14. 1935.-; — CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2.

Mr. Allen White (reference paragraph 254 of last report) left for Hasa by way of Egypt and Syria on the 25th September, ten days after the arrival from London of Mr. R. Lebkicher, a geologist of the Standard Oil Company, who, it is understood, will remain in charge of the office of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company here for several months. The Mecca press contained further references to reports that the company had struck oil in Hasa. ^ 290. The selling rates for Saudi silver rials (paragraph 259 of last month ^ report), remained fairly steady during September at 18^ and lOf-llf for gold and Egyptian pounds respectively. The manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), at the end of the month, had heard nothing further regarding the consignment from London of £90,000 worth of silver rial pieces. A further importation of rupees from India (reference paragraph 145 of the report for May), amounting to 112,000 rupees, arrived on the 10 th from India by l the steamship Jehangir. 291. Sheikh Muhammad Tawil, Director-General of Customs, Hasa, remained at Taif on leave. He made a clean sweep of most of his subordinate officials, the new appointments, of no individual interest, being announced in the press during the month. 292. The Waziriya water supply has been a source of some anxiety during the past three or four months. The present supply is barely sufficient for a once daily distribution, and plans for its increase are at present under consideration. II. —Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 293. The recent developments in the Yemen, in connexion with the reported appointment of the Saif-ul-Islam Ahmad as Regent and the proposed reorganisa tion of the Yemeni army on modern lines, has been given some publicity by the Mecca press. The Saut-al-Hejaz offered its congratulations to the Yemeni Crown Prince. 294. Various questions concerning foreign relations in Arabia arose during the month, but as British interests were primarily concerned, they will be treated under the next section. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 295. (Paragraph 267 of last report.) By command of His Majesty the King, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires called on Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 4th September to express His Majesty’s appreciation at the message of thanks from Ibn Saud and the Amir Saud for the hospitable welcome given to the latter during his recent visit to England. 296. (Reference paragraphs 265 and 270 of last report.) The Saudi note foreshadowed by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 27th August, in regard to the Koweit blockade, was received on the 1 st September. It was found largely to cover the ground traversed by Sheikh Yusuf orally, and declared that, pending a settlement of the question along the lines suggested by the Saudi delegates to the recent conference, a drastic intensification of blockade measures against both goods and unauthorised persons attempting to enter Saudi Arabia from Koweit would be enforced. It repeated the allegation that a large increase in smuggling from Koweit had taken place subsequent to the episode of the armed incursion into Koweit and to the break down of the conference. Acting upon instructions, Mr. Calvert addressed on the 15th September a further official communication to the Saudi Government stating that His Majesty’s Government now regarded the incident of the armed incursion as closed, and expressing surprise at the alleged increase of smuggling from Koweit and the intention of the Saudi Arab Government to restrict intercourse with Koweit still further. His Majesty’s Government regretted that no consideration had apparently been given to the Legation’s previous note, and warned the Saudi Arab Government that they must assume sole responsibility for the continuance of the present unsatisfactory situation if they maintained their insistence on impossible conditions. No further exchange had taken place on this matter at the end of the month. 297. On the 6 th September Sheikh Yusuf Yasin informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that information had reached Ibn Saud that the Sheikh of Qatar had granted, or was about to grant, an oil concession in Qatar. As no4 B55m merit. Until the situation clarified itself, the Saudis would, however, treat the Italians with customary courtesy, but if hostilities were unfortunately to break out they would follow His Majesty’s Government. The sheikh stressed the financial importance to this country in these times of economic depression of a deal in camels with the Italians, who were also ready to promise them, in addition to money and arms, guns and aeroplanes. Subsequent to the statement of His ^ Majesty’s Government’s views, he had given permission for the sale of a number of camels to the Italians. He might impose limitations on their numbers later on. Sheikh Yusuf’s statements led to a further oral communication on the 16th September by His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires regarding the views of His Majesty’s Government, and another conversation on the subject took place on the 19th, when the sheikh discussing the general situation personally enquired what would happen to shipping, postal services, &amp;c., in the Red Sea if the Suez Canal were closed, an event he appeared to expect. He felt sure that His Majesty’s Government would not wish, as a great Moslem Power, to see harm or loss befall the Hejaz, but would act as in the Great War, when His Majesty’s Government helped ito alleviate the hardships suffered by that country. 302. It was understood from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that Odello, the Italian self-styled merchant, had paid a lump sum in advance for the purchase of camels, and that a broker had been despatched to collect the animals. No invasion of Jedda by camels for Eritrea had taken place up to the end of the month. No further shipments of live-stock, fruit or vegetables to Massawa took place in September, the reason given being that, owing to the disorganisation in that port and consequent delay in unloading, the fruit and vegetables perished and had to be thrown overboard, and the animals suffered severely. As Saudi merchants were to be paid for their goods “ landed Massawa,” they suffered in some cases total loss in consequence. The experiment is therefore not likely to be repeated. Generally, the Italo-Ethiopian situation is followed with the closest interest, facilitated by the rapid increase in the number of wireless sets being imported. Rumours during September were responsible for some panic and a rise in the local prices of food-stuffs in the “ suq,” but the municipality took certain measures, and the receipt of further news of a more reassuring nature helped to restore confidence. 303. (Paragraph 274 of last report.) The unofficial Haramayn Waqfs ; mission had not left for abroad at the end of September. The Umm-al-Qura of the 27th reported the resignation of one of the delegates, Sheikh Abdullah-ash- 4 Shaibi, on account of pressure of other duties, and the appointment in his stead of Sherif Ridha. Other reports were not lacking that the mission would not leave at all, for, it is said, as regarded Egypt, Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman had done all that could be done; from Palestine, certain monies had been received from the Grand Mufti; and India was definitely unfavourably disposed towards / the mission. 304. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 19th that some 244 destitute Indians had arrived in Hasa and had been prevented from proceeding further into the interior. He suggested that they should be returned to India and drew attention to the undesirability of destitutes using the overland routes to Mecca, 'these unfortunates had arrived in Hasa via Muscat, Oman and Qatar. The matter was under consideration at the end of the month. 305. 1 he Italian and Turkish Charges d Affaires returned from leave during the month on the 1 st and 22 nd respectively, and the Soviet Legation's dentist, M. Miron Merson, accompanied by his wife, left for Europe via Port Sudan on the 8 th. Signor Persico expressed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires his dissatisfaction with the junior official, Signor Ardizzone, left in charge of the Italian Legation dui mg the summer, for not only had he bungled the arrange ments for the visit of the Italian flotilla-leader Pantera (see paragraph 208). but he had been guilty of the gaffe of missing the Amir Saud on his return to Jedda. As the Crown Prince arrived in an Italian ship, Signor Ardizzone took launch to go aboard to welcome His Royal Highness before he landed, but, unfortunately, the Italian representative arrived too late, the Amir had left the ship, and when the unfortunate Ardizzone returned to shore the reception at the quay was over. Celal Bay, it is expected, will be preoccupied with the effects on Turkish interests in this country of the Saudi Law on Immovable Property (reference paragraph 241 of the report for October 1934).IV.— Miscellaneous. 306. (Paragraph 246 of the report for July.) It was stated that all restrictions on mutawwifs proceeding to India, Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies have been withdrawn. The embargo remains as regards “ sabees.” 307. The American missionary, Dr. Storm (paragraph 280), after a visit to Yanbu, left for Jizan en route for Aden on the 13th. 308. Captain H. A. Symons, the representative of a British firm dealing in military equipment, arrived from Port Sudan on the 4th September and left for the same place on the 8 th, intending to make for the Yemen. 309. Signor Caro Caglieri left Jedda for Berbera (paragraph 278), it is believed, early in September. 310. Rains fell during the month at Taif and at other places in the interior. 311. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. look refuge in September : 1 male, 1 female and infant. Locally manumitted : 1 female and infant. Left voluntarily: Nil.

Little or nothing has been heard of the movements of Ibn Saud. who presumably passed the month at Riyadh. Amir Saud returned from his visit to Europe, Egypt, Palestine and 1 ransjordan on the 25th August and, on landing at Jedda, was given what amounted to a popular welcome, a cheerful contrast to the absence of enthusiasm that marked his departure. He travelled from Egypt in an Italian ship, and was greeted on board on arrival by certain chosen individuals, and at the Quarantine Quay by the Amir Feisal and a number of other princes, foreign representatives, members of the foreign community, notables, officials, school- children and a considerable crowd. He was saluted on the arrival of his ship and on coming ashore by two Saudi aeroplanes which had flown specially from Taif for the occasion, and a guard of honour was mounted at the quay. A short reception was held at the quay, when laudatory and congratulatory speeches were delivered and songs were sung by the children. The town itself was gailv beflagged and the route taken by the procession was decorated as far a? the Medina Gate with bunting, streamers and at least one triumphal arch. The streets were agog with sightseers most of the day and celebrations continued into the night. I he Amir Saud left for Mecca on the evening of the 25th and for Taif a day or so later. 251. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin came from Riyadh to be present at Jedda on the Crown Prince's return. He alone did not return to Mecca and Taif with the Royal party, as he had certain matters to discuss with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, as will be described below, and other foreign representatives. He left for Taif on the 29th August, intending to return to Jedda a few days later to resume the conversations. 252. Fuad Bey Hamza did not return with the Amir Saud. He left the Royal party to spend a period of leave in his native Syria. His brother. Taufiq Hamza, however, joined His Royal Highness’s suite and returned to this countrv with the Amir. 253. The Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, left for Egvpt on the 21 st August, ostensibly proceeding to Turkey for reasons of health. &amp; He had intended to travel to India, but had postponed his departure until too late in the season, in view of the expected arrival of the first pilgrims in October for the next Hajj. Various reasons are advanced here for the visit to Egypt inter alia, that he proposes to negotiate with Talaat Pasha Harb and the Banque Misr concerning a project to reconstruct the Jedda-Mecca road. He is also said to be interested in the purchase of lighting plant for Mecca and for the Governmenf hotels maintained at Jedda and Mecca. ^uv eminent [506 q 2] B2 254. Mr. Alan White arrived here from Hasa on the 4th August to take charge of the Jedda office of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in the absence of Mr. Lenahan (reference paragraph 223 of last month s report). He travelled via Egypt. The Umm-al-Qura came out on the 30th August with the information that on the 23rd oil had been struck by the company at the borings at A1 Habr, in Hasa. This would appear at least premature, as the company’s representatives in Jedda know nothing of so important a development. 255. During the absence of Mr. Twitchell, M. van de Poll has been in charge of the operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate in this country. He has been back and forth between Jedda and the mine, taking a circuitous route, during August, whilst Mr. Shanks has been busy with a party of some sixty labourers roadmaking along the direct alignment Jedda-Mahd-adh- Dhahab now decided upon. He is making fair progress and it is understood that the surface of the road will ultimately be treated with oil to bind and “ seal the loose top sand. The soil is expected under this treatment to “ pack well, and it is hoped the method will prove as satisfactory as it is stated to be in other parts of the world. It is gathered a pier out to deep water may be constructed by the syndicate some 3 or 4 miles north of Jedda. 256. The two aircraft which flew down from Taif to welcome the Amir Baud returned on the 29th August. It was reported in the press that earlier in the month they had flown at Taif and had taken up certain Government officials. The Saut-al-Hejaz stated that the Saudi students in Italy have now completed their training as pilots. Ibn Baud, however, was less optimistic on the subject in conversation with Captain de Gaury (reference paragraph 243 of last month’s report) early in July. The King said that his air force was not progressing quickly enough ; that two aircraft had already been “ written oft’ ” by the students in Italy, and that it would probably be necessary to extend their course from one year to eighteen months, until, in fact, they could be made efficient. Ibn Baud spoke of using his two best pilots in a weekly air-mail service he proposed to establish between the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, via Hasa, Riyadh and Taif. American aircraft appear to be favoured at present. 257. Reports have been received over the past two months of an impending reorganisation of the Saudi military forces. Details are lacking, but certain draft regulations have been drawn up and are understood to be under Royal consideration. The wearing of uniform has been prescribed for certain elements in the forces, an unpopular decision with tribesmen. 258. The internal situation has remained undisturbed, except for definite signs of a determination of the authorities in Mecca to infuse new vigour into their Committee of Virtue (reference paragraph 195 of report for June). An active official with considerable powers has been appointed, and the backsliding Meccan, unless he would be scourged, is now condemned once more to the old routine of Islamic piety. Jedda has felt less noticeably the effect of Virtue Resurgent, but the use of the radio may, it is said, be limited to reception of the news. Virtue might well be roused by that nightly violation of the ether which passes here for music. 259. (Reference paragraph 231 of last month’s report.) The selling rates for Saudi silver riyals during the month gradually rose from 16,8 to 17,16^ and from 10,1 to 10,11 at the end of the month for gold and Egyptian pounds respectively. Hoarding was more definitely reported, and the manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) here stated confidentially that the firm’s London office had recently been approached by the Saudi Arab Legation there regarding freight rates on a consignment of £90,000 worth of nyal, half- and quarter-riyal pieces. This consignment was expected to arrive here shortly and would be followed by others. Local speculators may therefore find their exploitation of the temporary shortages of silver currency cut disastrously short. It is understood from London that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate were also approached by the Minister of Finance for a loan of 1 million silver riyals, but were unable to comply. 260. The Umm-al-Qura of the 3rd August contained an announcement by the Ministry of Finance that all private car-owners must submit to the Ministry at the end of each month a statement showing quantities of petrol, oil, grease, spare parts, tyres and accessories used in respect of each car, the statement to be supported by invoices and receipts. Private owners were, furthermore, forbidden to carry any fare-paying passengers, only members of the owner’s family to be[506 q—2] b 2 3 excepted. This obscurely worded decree is probably designed to check illicit sales of petrol, &amp;c., and to give the monopolistic motor-car company a closer control of passenger traffic. It is not expected to be observed save in the breach. 261. The establishment of a First-Aid Society for this country is contem plated, and regulations are now being promulgated in instalments in the press. A committee has been appointed. 262. According to the Umm-al-Qura, two new primary schools were opened at Mecca during the month. 263. Sheikh Muhammad Tawil, the Director of Customs in Hasa, arrived early in August at Taif, where he remained at the end of the month. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 264. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in the course of a ceremonial call on His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 29th August (see paragraph 267 below), requested that the cordial thanks of Ibn Saud and the Amir Saud be conveyed to the Acting High Commisioner for Palestine and the people of Palestine for the warmth of their welcome to the Amir Saud during his recent visit to that country. The message was duly transmitted. 265. (Reference paragraph 232 of last report.) Under instructions from His Majesty’s Government His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires replied to the Saudi Government on the 5th August regarding the incursion of armed retainers of the Amir of Hasa into Koweit territory. The note stressed, but in conciliatory terms, that the conduct of the party themselves was responsible for the impression that their object was to bring pressure to bear on certain tribes to leave Koweit territory in order that “ zakat ” could be collected from them by the Saudi authorities. The party was treated with courtesy and allowed to return at once to their own country. As to the practice to be followed in regard to movements on the frontier, both His Majesty’s Government and the sheikh remained of the opinion, previously expressed, that there was no reason to modify the local practice followed hitherto in regard to persons crossing the frontier for ordinary purposes of intercourse. On the 27th August Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in the course of a long conversation with Mr. Calvert on the subject of the Koweit blockade (see paragraph 270 below), reverted to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government over the armed incursion, and stated that in a note, which would shortly be received by the Legation, Ibn Saud had laid down that, whilst subscribing to the principle of freedom of movement on the frontier in accordance with the age-long practice, he proposed to prohibit Koweitis from entering Saudi Arabia, except upon previous permission being obtained, upon pain of the severest punishment. This was due, stated Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, to the intensification of smuggling from Koweit since the breakdown of the conference and the armed party incident, and was a provisional measure pending the settlement of the blockade question. 266. Reports, as yet unconfirmed, have recently been received from Taif i that the situation in Najran is again causing the Saudi authorities some anxiety, j It is said that a Saudi collector of the “ zakat” tax was recently killed by Najran tribesmen, a number of whom promptly took refuge in the Yemen. There upon forty lorries containing soldiers were despatched to the south and the situation restored. The actions of the Imam are, it is averred, being closely watched, and the recent importation of munitions of war into the Yemen (vide Aden intelligence summaries) has not passed unnoticed here. A ‘‘ jihad tax is being collected at Taif, a further report states, and collection is being enforced ruthlessly by the Amir, Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, the erstwhile Amir of Jedda of pleasant manners. That Saudi eyes are again turned on their southern defences may not be unconnected with the present Italo-Ethiopian crisis, for Ibn Saud fears that an Italy victorious in Abyssinia would, with an army on the spot, next turn her attention to the Yemen (see paragraphs 268 and 269 below). III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 267. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin paid a ceremonial call on His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 29th August, and conveyed, by command, Ibn Saud’s most grateful thanks to His Majesty the King and to His Majesty’s Government for the exceptional welcome and hospitality shown to the Amir Saud during his recent visit to England. Sheikh Yusuf added that the Amir Saud desired that his own4 thanks be conveyed similarly to His Majesty and His Majesty s Government. Mr. Calvert made suitable acknowledgment of this communication and under took to convey it at once to its high destination. . , 268. On the 25th August Sheikh Yusuf Yasin called on His Majesty s Charge d’Affaires charged with a message from Ibn baud for His Majesty s Government concerning the present Italo-Ethiopian crisis. He spoke at great length and described the delivery of the message as the real reason for his visit to Jedda. Ibn Sand had maintained correct relations with the Italian Govern ment during the Saudi-Yemen war and since, and now, particularly in view of the hospitality shown to the Amir Baud during his visit to Italy, he was anxious to preserve those relations. He had, therefore, decided to suspend, until the present crisis was over, treaty negotiations with Abyssinia which had been going on since the delegation from that country was here in the spring (reference paragraph 128 of the report for April). Ibn Saud wished to avoid creating the impression of taking sides, and for that reason had refused an Italian request for permission to recruit labour here for Eritrea. This request had been preferred by the newly-arrived Italian merchant, Odello (reference paragraph 240 of the report for July, &amp;c.). Odello had thereupon requested permission to purchase and ship to Eritrea 10,000 to 12,000 camels, and asked to be allowed to interview the King at Riyadh. Ibn Saud refused to see Odello and referred him to his Minister of Finance. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman eventually agreed to the export of 200 to 300 camels a month, but so hedged the concession about with conditions as virtually to nullify it. Odello then renewed his request to see the King, and, on this occasion, Ibn Saud consented to receive him. He saw the King twice and Sheikh Yusuf at least once. In the course of conversations with the latter he declared himself to he no merchant, but an Italian military officer sent specially to this country to purchase supplies for Eritrea. Sheikh Yusuf further professed that Odello conveyed to him veiled threats of Italian retaliation soon or late should the Saudis’ fail to show compliance. He offered good prices for camels, was prepared to pay £ 10,000 cash down in advance, and offered, moreover, to supply the Saudi Government with arms and ammunition. Sheikh Yusuf declared that Ibn Saud maintained the attitude that as a government they were unable to enter into any arrangement of the sort with Odello, but placed him in touch with certain private individuals, who would assist as go-betweens in the purchase of camels. Sheikh Yusuf concluded by putting certain specific questions, on behalf of Ibn Saud, as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government to the Italo-Abyssinian situation, and as to what would be their attitude if Saudi Arabia found herself menaced from “ the south.” He was remaining in Jedda in order that the reply, when received, might be communicated to him. Mr. Calvert, in undertaking to convey the message, pointed out that certain of the questions put to His Majesty’s Government were hypothetical, and observed, speaking personally, that His Majesty’s Government’s constant aim was the maintenance of peace. 269. Certain further reactions to the present Italo-Ethiopian situation (paragraph 240 of last report) have been observed locally during the month. Early in August, preparations were made by Messrs. Haji Abdullah Alireza and Co. to export a consignment of cattle, sheep, fruit, vegetables and similar local produce to Eritrea. The shipment was forbidden by the Saudi Government, but a week later they revoked their previous decision and allowed a consignment of sheep and produce to be shipped to Massawa, where prices are said to rule high, taking care to levy an export tax. It is not known whether further consign ments have been sent. In any case, public sentiment is opposed both on the grounds that supplies in this country are none too plentiful and prices here are likely to rise if stocks are reduced by export to Eritrea, and on grounds of pro-Ethiopian feeling. This sentiment finds religious sanction in the well-known tradition that kindness and support were afforded by Abyssinia to Moslems in the early days of Islam. Signor Odello's activities, in conjunction with Messrs. Lazzarini, in search of camels had become public property, owing to the large amount in gold being bought by the Italians, before Sheikh Yusuf Yasin saw Mr. Calvert. Odello visited Riyadh, accompanied by a member of the firm of Lazzarini and the half-caste dragoman of the Italian Legation, about the 17th and returned to Jedda about the 28th August. 270. Upon the breakdown of the Koweit Conference (paragraphs 202, 203 and 237 of reports for June and July) His Majesty’s Government decided, in5 view of the unreasonableness of the Saudi attitude, to maintain pressure on the Saudi Government. Acting under instructions, His Majesty s C barge d Affaires addressed a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs enquiring whether the Sauui Government were in a position to state their view in the light of further conversa tions which had taken place in London with Fuad Bey Hamza, who agreed to refer the question again to his Government for their renewed consideration. On the 27th August Sheikh Yusuf Yasin broached the subject orally with Mr. Calvert in a lengthy statement, in which he asserted that Koweitis had no real desire to terminate the present situation of a brisk and lucrative smuggling trade and alleged that dues were officially levied at the gates of Koweit on goods it was common knowledge were to be smuggled into Saudi Arabia. He outlined the measures to prevent Koweiti smugglers from entering this country (see paragraph 265 above), which would be contained in the Saudi note now on its way to the Legation. After Mr. Calvert had emphatically restated the views already expressed in writing, Sheikh Yusuf stated that he was authorised to discuss the question further in a personal exchange of views. Mr. Calvert replied that he had no instructions to discuss the question and suggested that it would be best to await the Saudi note. He could give Sheikh Yusuf no encouragement that an early reply could be expected. *271. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at the meeting of the 27th August referred to the question of the proposed conference on the reconditioning of theJGejaz Railway (reference paragraph 59 of the report for February). On the 15th August, the Legation and the French consulate had addressed identic notes to the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs in which they notifted their Governments acceptance of the Saudi proposal for a technical conference on this question; took note of Saudi reservations and restated their own; proposed an agenda; and suggested that the proposed conference should assemble at Haifa on the 10th October next, under the presidency of the chief Palestinian delegate. Sheikh Yusuf, after some discussion of the agenda, informed His Majesty s C harge d Affaires that the Saudi Government were prepared to agree to the proposals contained in the identic note. A Saudi note to this effect would shortly be received. 272. (Reference paragraph 204.) The question of the Government of India dispensaries also came up for discussion in the conversations with Sheikh Lusuf Yasin of the 25th and 27th August. He was, of course, aware that the matter had been discussed in London bv Sir Andrew Ryan with Fuad Bey Hamza, but was firmly of the impression that draft Saudi regulations, intended for early promulgation, were to be further considered by himself and His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires, whereas Mr. Calvert was equally firmly of the impiession that Fuad Bev, in London, had been strongly urged to defer promulgation until after Sir Andrew had had an opportunity of further discussion of the issues involved during his forthcoming visit to Riyadh—and that the matter had been left at that. The apparent misunderstanding lias been reported to His Majesty's Government but Sheikh Yusuf strongly represented the question as one for the unfettered decision of the Saudi Government and declared that the promulgation of the regulations could no longer be delayed . „ . , . , t}- jw 273. To complete the tale of the burden of affairs brought from Riyadh to Jedda by this attorney-minded counsellor of Ibn baud, the questions of slavery, the Bahrein Conference Agreement and Sir Andrew Ryan's visit to Riyadh were mentioned, but more briefly and quite uncontentiously. 274. (Paragraph 238 of last report.) The names of the members of the unofficial mission to various countries in connexion with the Haramayn Waqfs were communicated by the Minister for Foreign A flairs on the 14th August. They are the following four individuals :— Sheikh Abdullah-ash-Shaibi, Seyyid Muhammad Shata, Sheikh Bakr Daghestani, Seyyid Ubeyd Medani, while Sheikh Yusuf Zeynal will accompany them as adviser. No exception can be taken to any of these persons, all of whom are of highly respected families. They have not'yet left this country, but further information as to the date of departure and programme has been promised. On the 25th August, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires drew Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s attention orally to the possibility that the arrival of this mission in India might be expected to arouse some anti-Saudi agitation in Moslem circles in that country.6 IV.— Miscellaneous. 275. The Saudi pilgrimage tariff for the 1936 Hajj was published, in its Arabic and Malay versions, during the month. The various British Governments interested are being informed of the charges that have this year been introduced. Upon the dispersal of the 1935 pilgrimage the local Hajj Committee distributed leaflets in which a reduction of 25 per cent, on all Saudi dues and transport charges was promised. As far as transport charges in the Hejaz are concerned the promise has been carried out, but a number of other items have now been consolidated in one item, the charge levied slightly exceeding the aggregate of the individual items now merged. 276. The customary press propaganda for the next Hajj is now in full spate. A newspaper the Hajj is reported to have been founded at Delhi by Sheikh Omar-al-Bastawi. Entirely misleading accounts of the medical organisation in this country are often circulated in this propaganda, the truth being that hospitals here are ludicrous caricatures of the normal institutions elsewhere, and medical personnel and equipment are inadequate and inefficient to a degree. 277. The sloop H.M.S. Penzance (Commander E. C. Longsdon, R.N.), visited Jedda in the morning of the 29th August, in response to an urgent call to convey to hospital in Port Sudan the second translator of the Legation, who was critically ill. She remained here about two hours. 278. Signor Odello, of whom much has been related in earlier paragraphs, was joined towards the end of the month by a compatriot. Caro Caglieri, who is to represent his chief in a business enterprise at Berbera, concerning which the Governor of British Somaliland has raised no objections. This gentleman is Signor Odello’s second associate, the first, Ilario Marinangeli, having already been noticed at paragraph 245 of the last report. 279. The Italian Dr. Brunelli and his wife (paragraph 162 of the report for May) left Jedda during the month after a disagreement with their Legation over the terms of service on which the doctor conceived he had come to this country. He was given short notice by the Charge d’Affaires to clear out and went. 280. Dr. W. H. Storm of the American Mission at Bahrein arrived in Jedda about the 22 nd from laif, where he had been for some weeks after crossing Arabia via Riyadh. 281. Other travellers during the month have been M. Paul Klein (French), and M. Georges Robert Naly (Swiss), who passed through Jedda at the end of the month, proceeding via Port Sudan to Jibuti. A M. Julius B. Vago (Hungarian) floated along from Addis Ababa, with a letter testifying to his good character from the Seventh Day Adventist Mission at that place, which he hoped might help him into a job with Mr. TwitchelTs Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. He is still about somewhere. 282. No report on this month of grace August 1935 would be complete without a reference to the weather. Heat and humidity have remained at unusually high levels; heavy clouds have lent oppressiveness to day and night; for two days the world was enveloped in a mist which reduced visibility to half a mile or less; a ship of the Ben Line vainly searched for Jedda for the whole of a day and pilots from shore were equally unable to find the ship; two other days were enlivened by sudden and severe sandstorms which left quantities of desert on desks and in dossiers. One cannot altogether agree, whether politically or climatically, with a member of the French consulate who described this month as “la saison du calme.’’ 283. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Took refuge in August: Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. Left voluntarily : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : Nil. One female took refuge in the Legation for a few days, but, it becoming quickly apparent that she was not a slave, she left voluntarily with her husband. oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

Jedda Report for June J935. I .—Internal Affairs. 180. The King passed the month in Nejd, where he may be expected to remain for the rest of the year. It is sufficiently unusual to deserve mention that his movements have remained completely unrecorded by the Saudi press during June. 181. F&lt;\r otherwise those of the Amir Saud, whose European journey has been copiously written up and whose progress from banquet to review and on to banquet, through Italy, France, Holland and Belgium to England, where he arrived on the 17th June, has been carefully chronicled. 182. Amir Feisal remained at Taif and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was as much in the hands of the caretaker as at the end of .May (see paragraph 139). 183. It was reported that another of the sons of Ibn Saud, the Amir Mansur, recently met with an accident whilst motoring. It was said that he was standing beside a stationary car when a second car, passing too close to the first, ran over his feet. It is not known how serious was the injury, but Ibn Saud's rage was such that the offending driver would, it is stated, have paid for the accident with his life if it had not been for the magnanimous intercession of Amir Mansui himself. 184. The administrative changes foreshadowed in paragraph 140 of the report for last month were announced during June. The post at Jedda of kaimakam, it is true, was not filled and Sheikh Muhammad Id Ar-Rawwaf's position, according to a correction issued in the Saut-al-Hejaz of an earlier communique, is that of deputy kaimakam only. The changes include :— Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Muammar, from Amir of Taif to Amir of A1 Aflaj in the Wadi Dawasir, and Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, from Amir of Jedda to Amir of Taif. The Acting Amir of Medina, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Ibrahim, was reported early in June to have returned there and resumed charge (reference paragraph 141). 185. The Umm-cd-Qura announced on the 28th June the death of the Amir of Jizan, Sheikh Hamad Ash-Shuwayir. He was carried off by a fever. The same issue contained a high decree sanctioning the appointment of Sheikh Saud Ash-Shuwayir as deputy Amir of that place. Little was known of Sheikh Hamad Ash-Shuwayir, except that he occasionally came to notice in connexion with Asir and the military operations there of last year (see paragraph 189 below). 186. The Saudi Government have decided to establish police posts at Tebuk, Dhaba and Umm Lejj under the following officers : Seyyid Naji, Murad Effendi A1 Turjaman and Muhammad Eft’endi Nijmi respectively. These officers are expected to proceed shortly to their posts from Mecca. [456 p—2] I B187. Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman, the Minister of Finance, visited Jedda on the 21st June to preside at the official inaugural ceremony of the new Jedda customs building. Local notables and Government officials composed the assemblage and speeches laudatory of Ibn Saud were delivered. No foreign representatives were, as far as is known, invited. The new building is said to be commodious and a great improvement on the former premises. 188. The Minister of Finance, in his other capacity of Deputy Minister of Defence, is said to have been active during the month in effecting the concentration of stocks of ammunition and other Government munitions in Taif. Consignments of ammunition are reported to have arrived from Asir, but these reports are a little difficult to reconcile with recent prevalent rumours of the situation in that province. 189. On or about the 26th June some 300 Saudi soldiers left Jedda by the launch Riyadh for Qunfidha and Jizan. In official circles this movement was represented as a normal one of garrison relief in Asir. Rumour, however, was persistent that trouble had recently arisen over the collection of “ Zakat ” from the tribes and that Saudi tax gatherers, to the number of fifteen, had been killed by the Beni Malik or the Abadil. The same rumourists would have us believe that the late Amir of Jidan, Sheikh Hamad Ash-Shuwayir (vide paragraph 185 above) did not die of a fever, but met a violent end at the hands of the Masariha tribe. 190. The Umm-al-Qura of the 7th June contained particulars of a new project, the “ Mashru-al-Qirsh,” the piastre project, on the model of a recent Egyptian experiment. The funds collected by this enterprise were to be devoted to objects of national concern. The article was suitably vague and it is doubtful whether the project will ever amount to anything. 191. Mr. Twitched arrived in Jedda by sea from Yanbu on the 30th June, accompanied by Mr. E. D. McDermott, a director of the syndicate, and a Mr. Shanks, of whom the former is believed to be leaving for England by next boat; It is credibly reported that a subsidiary company to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate is about to be formed. 192. A recent feature of considerable economic significance has been the steady appreciation of the Saudi silver rival over the past few months. The selling rates of exchange for rials per £ gold during the last three months have been as follows :— April 1 May 1 June 1 June 30 Rials. 21 20i 20 17, 18 Whether the rise may be attributed to a tendency to hoard silver currency by the inhabitants of this country with the object of taking advantage of a better rate on the approach of the pilgrimage season, an explanation which it is difficult to accept, or to the rise in the price of the metal in the world’s silver markets, or to some undetected economic influence, the effect on the cost of living of foreign residents in this country has already become appreciable. (In this connexion, vide paragraph 145 of the last report.) 193. Regulations were published on the 21 st June and were communicated separately at the same time to the Legation by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs containing a list of the Red Sea ports of Saudi Arabia to which sailing vessels, plying on these coasts, were to be restricted. The measure, which is designed to check smuggling, is virtuous enough though, as far as remoter stretches of coast are concerned, it will probably be impossible of application by the present jejune Saudi preventive administration. 194. Two schools are reported to have been established during the month, a school at Riyadh which, by Royal permission, is to bear the style of the Amir’s School, and a primary school at Medina. 195. The narrower austerities of the Wahhabi creed have never flourished in the alien soil of the Hejaz. Observers have recently not been slow to note an increasing latitudinarianism, even beneath the sacred walls of the Holy Haram itself. Committees of Virtue are said to be in process of dismemberment, and the merchant of Mecca and Jedda now devotes himself more sedulously to his com mercial than to his religious exercises. Townsmen smoke freely in the streets of Mecca, and solace their hours of ease in the coffee-houses of their choice withhubble-bubble and a quiet game of “damana.’' Vocalists are ready at any hour to render such favourite Arab airs as “ Dana dana,” and gramophones, now that wireless sets have achieved official respectability, are, alas! less muted than before, whilst gramophone records are hawked in the streets. One observer of life in Mecca over many years describes the change over a mere two months as little short of miraculous. In Jedda quarantine officials find it necessary to visit ships in full force, and have been seen to display a healthy, if undiscriminating, taste in beer. Whether this new licence is essentially an expression of release from the toils of a repugnant “Calvinism ” no longer for the moment officially enforced, or is due in part to a feeling that better and larger pilgrimages are ahead and the economic depression has now done its worst, one may be permitted to speculate on its permanence. Committees, even of less durable stuff than virtue, die hard. 196. The Saut-al-Hejaz of the 25th states that arrangements have been made for a weekly broadcast in the form of a lecture on the subject of Ibn Saud. The newspaper omits to state the station from which the lectures will be broad cast, but private enquiries indicate some station in Java. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 197. The Saut-al-Hejaz of the 18th June contained a short article, “ received for publication,' but from an unspecified source, in which the rumours of Seif-ul-Islam Ahmad of the Yemen's complicity in the attempt on the life of Ibn Saud, in March last, were denied. It was perhaps rather fanciful to feel that the language of the article lacked a little in emphasis. It went on, however, to denouce the mischief-makers responsible for these idle tales and characterised Saudi-Yemen relations as being those of friendship undimmed. 198. The Yemeni found in possession of three bombs (vide paragraph 152 of the report for May) is still in the custody of the police and is reported to have been sent on to Riyadh. The man appears to be of a great age, infirm and sick and even hard-boiled police officials are moved to compassion at his senility. There is a disposition to believe his story that he found the bombs, and no great significance is being attached to the matter. It is reported that a strict watch is being kept on all Yemeni residents in this country, and stories are not lacking of high-handedness and brutality by the police authorities. Certain Yemeni suspects are still said to be under lock and key. 199. Another dementi appeared in the press when the Umm-al-Qura of the 14th June denied a report published in the Muqattam that Dhafir tribesmen of Nejd had attacked and looted a number of motor cars in Koweit territory. 200 . The Saudi rejoinder to the protest against the armed incursion into Koweit territory, referred to in paragraph 153 of the report for May, was considered by His Majesty’s Government, and a reply authorised which whilst firmly maintaining the position taken up in regard to Zakat was couched in language calculated to reduce the risk of having to pursue the question further. This reply was addressed to the Saudi Arab Government on the 9 th June by Mr. Oppenheim, who was in charge of the Legation during the interval between Sir Andrew Ryan’s departure and Mr. Calvert’s arrival, and was made simul taneously with action taken with the Saudi authorities in connexion with the Koweit Conference (see paragraph 202 below). III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 201 . Sir Andrew Ryan left for Cairo by a Royal Air Force Victoria in the early hours of the 7th June, arriving there the same day. The machine had arrived two days earlier, also making the flight in one day. Her officers, Squadron-Leader P. H. Mackworth, D.F.C., F/Lt. J. P. Domvile and F/O. M. Sorsbie were given civic receptions at Wejh and Yanbu, but only quarantine And passport officials turned out to greet their arrival in Jedda. On the 6 th June the plane was refuelled to the tune of some 300 gallons of petrol, the proceedings being interrupted by a soldier anxious to refuel his cigarette lighter. A cocktail party in honour of the officers was held at the Legation house the evening before departure. [456 p 2] B 2202. After reconsideration of the question of the Koweit Conference {vide paragraph 160 of last month's report), His Majesty's Government, desirous that the conference should meet and be able to conclude preliminaries by the 12th June and seeing less serious objection to armed retainers, provided their numbers were restricted, than to “guards,” authorised the Legation to inform the Saudi Arab Government that there would be no objection to a party of fifty armed retainers accompanying the Saudi delegation, but that the number was larger than expected and a reduction would be welcome as they were to be the guests of the Sheikh of Koweit. This communication was made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 9th June, simultaneously with that described in paragraph 200 above. 203. The conference assembled at Koweit on the 16th June, the Saudi delegates being accompanied by no less than eighty odd retainers instead of fifty. The proceedings of the conference soon showed, in spite of a satisfactory beginning, that there was the slenderest hope of success. The Saudi delegation's tone became dictatorial and offensive and the Koweiti proposals for a system of customs posts and manifests, referred telegraphically to Ibn Saud, evoked the reply from Riyadh that the only possible condition under which the Saudi Arab Government would adopt the system was for Koweit to give a written guarantee that not a single smuggler from Koweit would cross the border. The inability of Koweit or His Majesty’s Government to give so sweeping an under taking led to little modification of the Saudi terms, and their delegates were expected to leave on the 30th June. Ibn Saud could hardly, it seems, have steered the conference more deliberately on to the rocks. 204. (Reference paragraph 161.) The further supplies of medical stores for the Legation dispensaries arrived early in the month and, upon the refusal of the Jedda customs authorities to allow clearance under diplomatic immunity, customs duty was assessed and paid under protest pending the general settlement of the whole question. 205. (Reference paragraph 126.) The text of the agreement, together with annexures, between the Sudan and Saudi Governments and the two companies, in respect of the cable and wireless services of this country, was published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 21st June, 1935. 206. On the 12th June the Ministry for Foreign Affairs addressed the Legation stating the desire of the Saudi Arab Government to establish postal communications between Jizan and Kamaran. A thrice-monthly service, by sambuq, was suggested for ordinary and registered letter mail. The question has been referred to His Majesty’s Government. 207. (Reference paragraph 93 {d) of the report for March last.) A note was addressed to the Saudi Arab Government on the 25th June in which they were informed that, subject to certain definite reservations, the Saudi nationality law may now be considered applicable to British subjects and British-protected persons, a further extension of six months to allow of submission of proof of foreign nationality having helped to remove the objections previously entertained by His Majesty’s Government. 208. The Italian flotilla leader Pantera {vide paragraph 162) visited Jedda on the 29th June, remaining until the morning of the 1st July. The circumstances surrounding the visit were highly curious. Early in the morning of the 29th she was observed to be lying at anchor in the outer anchorage, an unusual place, where she remained until about 3 p.m., when she entered the inner anchorage, exchanging the customary salutes with the battery on shore. It transpired that early in the morning the captain, accompanied by two stewards, had come ashore in a ship’s launch and had landed, the stewards proceeding to the bazaar and the captain enquiring the direction of the Italian Legation. He was, however, prevented from leaving the quarantine quay by the authorities there, as apparently the Saudis had received no official intimation of the ship’s visit. The stewards were recalled and after several hours had been spent at the quay, during which time the Italian vice-consul arrived there, it seems that arrangements were made for the ship to come in to the inner anchorage, be subjected to the usual quarantine formalities and exchange a salute of guns. Whatever may be the explanation of this curious episode, and one report accounts for the visit by the alleged interest of the Pantera in a Swedish ship in Jedda roads at the same time believed to be carrying munitions of war (later reports state for the Yemen, not for Abyssinia), it is clear that there was a bad Italian blunder somewhere. The Saudi authorities appeared to have acted with great reasonableness.5 209. Foreign representation here showed small changes during the month. The Soviet Minister and Mme. Turakoulov left on the 30th June for Asmaia on sick leave. It is not yet known who has been left in charge. The Egyptian consul, Abdul Hamid Monir Bey, arrived after a delay of many months on the 2nd June, and Hasan Abou Alam left for Egypt a few days later. IV.— Miscellaneous. 210. Lady Ryan left Jedda for Aden on the Jehangir on the 10th June. 211. Mr. Calvert returned from leave on the 12th, assuming charge from Mr. Oppenheim, who had officiated since the departure of Sir Andrew Ryan on the 7th June. . , ^j 1 e ^\ 212. Captain G. S. H. V. de Gaury, M.C. (vide paragraphs 132 and lo7), left on the 28th for Koweit by car, travelling via Riyadh. r I he Saudi authorities had acted well up to their promises to facilitate arrangements for his journey. 213. The Saut-al-Hejaz published on the 4th June what purported to be the terms of a treaty between the United States of America and the Yemen. It was a short document of five articles providing for recognition of the Yemen, mutual trade and other facilities. It was to remain in force for ten years. 214. The Eastern Telegraph Company’s cable ship, Lady Denison Pender arrived at Jedda on the 13th to repair a break in the cable to Port Sudan. She left on the 17th. . 215. A rumour unusually fantastic but persistent that five Englishmen have recently been murdered in Mecca continues to reach the Legation. It appears to have originated in Vienna, later appearing in the Echos of Damascus, the Wahdat of Delhi and the Balagh of Cairo. It is a fine specimen of the canard viennois. 216. (Reference paragraph 135.) The refusal of the Saudi authorities to allow mutawwifs to proceed to the Dutch East Indies has been considerably modified, if not withdrawn, and no similar restrictions have been imposed on mutawwifs proceeding to India, nor is it believed that such are now contemplated. The matter is, however, receiving further attention. 217. The wife and three children of Odello, the Italian merchant mentioned in paragraph 162, arrived on the 30th. This augmentation of the Italian colony makes it a close rival, in point of numbers, of the British colony. 218. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Took refuge in June : Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. Left voluntarily : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : Nil. o'-vTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT P.Z. * 1 EASTERN (Arabia). 6772 August 19, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. , 1935 J Section 1. [E 5011/557/25] Mr. Calvert to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received August 19.) (No. 222. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, August 2. 1935. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for July 1935. 2 . Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for January. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure. Jedda Report for July 1935. I .—Internal Affairs. 219. The month passed almost uneventfully in Jedda. Ibn Saud remained in Nejd, where his activities, whatever they were, again were passed over in complete silence by the Mecca press. The Amir Baud’s prolonged visit to England continued to be reported in considerable detail. We were informed that the Amir was now adding to the cares of the State the acquisition of the English tongue—in his spare time. He left London, with his suite, for Germany and Switzerland on the 22nd July. 220. Amir Feisal spent the first half of July at Rukba on a hunting expedition. He was later in the month reported in the Umm-al-Qura to be indisposed. 221. From subsequent reports it would appear that Amir Mansur (reference paragraph 183 of last month’s report) sustained injuries to a leg. His mother, and, it is said, favourite wife of Ibn Saud, was also reported to be far from well, and was being attended by Dr. Dame, the American mission doctor from the Persian Gulf. She was stated to be suffering from a tubercular abdominal fistula, and that unfortunately the X-ray apparatus at Riyadh had proved useless. The only other available apparatus was one at Mecca, but this, it was ultimately decided, was too small. A large and expensive X-ray machine was stated to have been ordered for Riyadh from Germany, and steps, it is believed, have been taken to expedite its despatch. Meanwhile, it was said that any operation would be postponed until the X-ray apparatus was received. An X-ray plant for Mecca was stated to have been promised by Talaat Pasha Harb, of the Banque Misr, but it had still to arrive. 222. The Saut-al-Hejaz of the 23rd July announced the appointment of Abdullah-bin-Feisal as Amir of Burayda. Beyond the information that he is not a son of Amir Feisal, but is a member of the Royal Family, and was married to, and subsequently divorced from, a daughter of Ibn Saud, little is known of him. By one informant the appointment was stated to be a consolation for the divorce, which was none of the Amir’s seeking. 223. The same newspaper also reported the appointment of Seyyid Hashim Sultan, for long a confidential agent of Ibn Saud’s and employed on missions in various parts of the country from time to time, to be the representative of the Ministry of Finance in Hasa. His task more especially is to co-operate with the officials of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, and to act as go-between in connexion with Saudi and company affairs. As regards the company, Mr. Lenahan, the Jedda representative, left here by sea on the [481 t— 1] b24th July, intending to make his way to Hasa via Egypt and Syria, where he expected to remain on local leave for three weeks. Mr. West remains in charge at Jedda, and it is believed Mr. Miller, chief geologist, will go on leave on Mr. Lenahan’s arrival in Hasa. Mr. Lenahan is expected to return to Jedda at about the end of the year. 224. It was learnt fairly reliably that the newly-appointed Deputy Amir of Jizan, Sheikh Sand Ash-Shuwayir (see paragraph 185 of last month’s report), had been recalled to Mecca, and was unlikely to return, the officer commanding troops there, Ibn Aqil, having been appointed to succeed him. Sheikh Saud’s visit to Mecca is said to relate to an alleged misappropriation of 30,000 rials at his previous post. 225. Troops were stated to have been sent south to Jizan from Taif during the early part of the month, and Amir Feisal’s absence from Taif was attributed less to motives of sport than to stimulation of local recruiting. More emphatic reports were received that the late Amir of Jizan was killed during tribal disturbances in that neighbourhood (see paragraph 189 of last month’s report), but less was heard of these local troubles and troop movements during the latter part of the month. 226. The Umm-al-Qura of the 19th July announced that the Government had established a wireless station at A1 Majma’a in Nejd. The station had been completely installed by the Saudi Posts and Telegraphs Administration. An earlier issue of the same newspaper published an official communique forbidding shipping to use their ship’s wireless whilst in harbour or in Saudi territorial waters. * 227. One Saudi aeroplane was reported to have flown at Taif on the 24th: not a busy month, but the cadets now in Italy are coming along ! One, according to the Saudi press, has flown solo and three others have successfully passed their examinations. 228. Both the Umm-al-Qura of the 26th July and the Saut-al-Hejaz announced the arrival during the month of Sheikh Abdur Rauf-as-Sabban, accompanied by Sheikh Ahmad-al-Mujallid, at Mecca from Bagdad. They had travelled via Riyadh, where they had been received by Ibn Saud, in whose praise Sheikh Abdur Rauf had delivered himself of a speech. This former Director of Education in Jedda under the Hashimites has a long and active past of anti-Saudi intrigue in Egypt, Transjordan and Iraq, where he was associated with the late ex-King Ah, but has now been pardoned by Ibn Saud, as has his less prominent companion, under the terms of the amnesty declared in January last (see paragraphs 6 (c) and 7 of the report for that month). He came to Jedda on the 28th July, but it is not yet known whether he has left the country or not. 229. (Paragraph 191 of the last report.) Mr. E. D. McDermott, the visiting director of the Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate, left for the United Kingdom on the 3rd July. Mr. Twitchell and his Australian associate, Mr. Shanks, a few days later set off in one of the company’s red trucks to explore a more direct route from Jedda to the “ cot of gold ” mine than the present circuitous line of approach, which entails a sea trip to Yanbu and from there a wearisome motor journey, avoiding the Medina area, of about 315 miles. The mine appears to be situated well to the south-east of Medina, almost upon the confines of Nejd, and the prospecting trip, although not wholly successful, encouraged the hope that a route could be found. Mr. van de Poll arrived in Jedda on the 20th, having succeeded in getting through from the mine to the coast at Rabigh, this route being about 240 miles. With the intention of shortening this distance by a more direct line, Mr. Shanks and Mr. van de Poll left again by truck towards the end of the month. Mr. Twitchell left on the 24th for the United Kingdom and hoped to return early in October. He saw Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman before his departure. In conversation with Mr. Calvert before he left he said he had been busy estimating the possibilities of the mine based on the essays already made, and expressed himself as gratified with the results. The mining operations near Yanbu-an-Nakhl, where Mr. Shanks was employed, have now been abandoned. 230. The following items of medical interest may be recorded : (a) Work has been started on the construction of a hospital at Medina, towards which the Egyptian lady Qut-al-Qulut-al-Damerdashiyya has given a donation, whilst Indian philanthropists are interested in the same or a similar project; (b) 6,500 were reported to have been vaccinated; (c) Mahmud Hamdi Bey, the Director- General of Public Health, who left Jedda on three months’ leave on the 31st July,3 during which period he may attend the Paris meeting of the International Health Office, was stated to intend purchasing medical equipment for Saudi hospitals to the tune of some £ 2 , 000 . 231. The steady appreciation of the Saudi silver rival, noted in para graph 192 of the last report, continued, the selling rate of exchange per gold pound touching the high rate of rials on the 11 th July. At the end of the month it had fallen back somewhat to 16 rials 8 piastres. The rate for rials per Egyptian pound varied at the end of the month between 10 rials 8 piastres and 10 rials 1 piastre. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 232. (Paragraph 200 of last report.) The exchanges with the Saudi Government, already recorded, over the armed incursion into Koweit territory were continued by a Saudi reply to the last Legation note. It covered pretty much the same ground as its predecessor in minimising and explaining the affair. It accused Koweit of inaccuracy in its report and of discourtesy towards the Saudis concerned; and denied there was any warrant for the view that Ibn Sand had appeared tb attempt to exercise authority in Koweit. The Saudi Govern ment asserted their desire for friendly relations, but hoped for the views of His Majesty’s Government as to whether the present frontier practice should continue or a new arrangement be sought. Meanwhile, the note concluded, both sides should prevent their officials and other subjects from crossing the frontier without prior permission of the other side. The question was still under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government at the end of the month. 233. On the 14th July an officer of the Transjordan Frontier Force, Captain Chamberlain, left Aqaba in an armed car and crossed into Saudi Arabia. As he failed to return he was followed by a second car, which overtook the first at Haql, some 20 miles south of Aqaba. The first car and its occupants had been arrested, and so was the second party, with the exception of a non-commissioned officer, who was allowed to return to Aqaba to inform the authorities. Lewis guns had been left behind in Transjordan, but both parties were armed with small arms. An urgent note was despatched on the 16th by the Legation to the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs expressing great regret at this singular and apparently wilful transgression, and requesting that urgent instructions be sent to Haql for the release of the cars and the personnel. A reply was received on the 22 nd, expressing regret at this violation, not the first of which they had had to complain, and stating that orders had been given for the release of Captain Chamberlain and his men. This rather mild reaction and the speed with which the release was effected may be attributed to the personal intervention of Amir Saud. who telegraphed from London to his father requesting prompt release. The two cars and their personnel arrived back in Transjordan on the 24th July; and, to anticipate a little, the thanks of the High Commissioner for Transjordan for the prompt response to his request were conveyed by the Legation to Ibn Saud on the 1st August. 234. The Saut-al-Hejaz reproduced an article which, it stated, had recently appeared in the Yemeni newspaper the Iman, denouncing certain elements in the Arabic press which appeared bent on stirring up enmity between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and giving the lie to tendentious reports that the Yemeni Govern ment had recently imprisoned certain sheikhs of the Tihama for aiding and abetting the Saudi forces during the late war. 235. The same Mecca newspaper reported that the Government of the Yemen had acquired three telegraph and wireless installations from Europe, which were to be placed in the palaces of the Imam and “ the Seif-ul-Islam ” (probably meaning Ahmad) and in the house of Seyyid Abdullah-al-Wazir. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 236. Conversations on a number of important subjects, particular!} that of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, took place with Fuad Bey Hamza in London during the month. Sir Andrew Ryan being present. 237. The Koweit Conference (paragraphs 202 and 203 of last report) dispersed at the end of June. Two of the principal Saudi delegates, Hamad-as [481 t—1] B 24 m Suleiman and Khalid-al-Qarqani, were re P°r te d b ? period^of 16th July, rather quaintly, as arriving at Riyadh after passing a penoa six months away, during which they had visited mos o consider th ®£ e a pr ^^ al t0 despatc h a non-official mission /P a [ a | ra P b ^ renort for April last) to various countries m connexion with the levenues ot t e Haramayn Waqfs was referred to the Governments of Palestine and Ind J a : ^ saw no obiection orovided that, among other conditions, the objects ot the mission should not include the collection of money, and that the persons to whose entry into those countries no exception c0 ' d ^^ or other grounds. They must expect no official facilities or support in India. 239 In January last the Saudi Government presented the Legation with a bill of approximately £300 sterling in respect of Force connexion with British aircraft on two occasions, (a) when a Royal An Loire Victoria forced-landed on the 17th April, 1934, near Jmnah Island, Persian Gulf (paragraph 81 of the report for April 1934), and ( 6 ) when three Moth aeroplanes belonging to the Bombay Plying Club were missing in the n “g hb “ rb °^ of Saudi-Iraq Neutral Zone (paragraph 251 of the report for October 1934) Hi. Majesty’s Government and the Government of India decided to meet the bill, and payment was made by the Legation on the 9th July. . , r? ' 240. There has been much speculation locally as to the probable attitude ot the Saudi authorities towards the recruitment of labour for Lritrea. Rumours have been rife of Italian requests to the Saudis to facilitate the enrolment ot chauffeurs but one British Indian chauffeur who presented himself at the Italian Legation was turned away with the information that none was wanted. No other categories of labour are known to have left for Eritrea, and it was stated by a knowledgeable source that the Italian Legation s attitude was to refuse applications. There is otherwise little apparent reaction to the Italo-Abyssinian bituatio return 0 f ^ Soviet Minister, M. Turakoulov, from Asmara, but without his wife, was the only event during the month of any interest, as far as foreign representatives were concerned. The French Charge d Affaires hoped to o-o on leave about the middle of July, but was delayed by the non-arrival of two batches of official mail. The only reason for mentioning this is that the mail was carried by Italian ships from Suez via Massawa, where, having for some reason been put ashore, it was held up owing to the confusion reigning at that 242^ Several months ago a large consignment of wheat was shipped to Yanbu by the Egyptian Government for the poor of Medina. 1 he Saudi Ministry of Finance undertook to transport the whole within a period of twenty days, the Egyptian Government agreeing to pay £E. 6,000 to defray cost of transport. The money was paid, in addition to other sums given for charitable purposes m that stricken city, but so far no more than one-sixth of the wheat has reached Medina, it is understood, and the balance lies rapidly deteriorating at Yanbu. The new Egyptian consul is now finding that the Minister of Finance is difficult to bring to an interview. IV.— Miscellaneous. 243. Captain de Gaury, M.C. (paragraph 212 of last report) arrived at Koweit on the 6 th July, having been accompanied from Riyadh onwards by six armed guards provided by Ibn Saud. . , 244. The American Dr. Dame (see paragraph 221 above) was reported to be attracting patients to Hail and Riyadh from this side of Saudi Arabia. He was accompanied to Riyadh by Dr. Harold Storm, M.D., who came on as far as Taif whence he sent hm passport to the Legation for a visa for Aden, by the hand of a third American of the original party to set off from the Persian Gulf, Mr Robert van Peurson. The latter was a taciturn young man, who left on the 24th July for Egypt and the United Kingdom, probably en route for America on leave. Dr. Storm has not yet blown this way. . 245. An Italian engineer, named Ilario Marmangeh, arrived about the 7th, and was later understood to have entered partnership with the Italian merchant Odello (paragraph 217 of the last report).* 246. Further information was received in regard to mutawwifs proceeding abroad (paragraph 216 of last report). Though no official announcement was made on the subject, it was understood that no restrictions would be placed on mutawwifs travelling to India or the Netherlands East Indies provided each mutawwif produced a reputable guarantor to meet any claims established against him in respect of debts contracted in those countries with pilgrims, &amp;c. No “ sabee,” however, is to be allowed to go to these two countries, except he be designated to represent a mutawwif who is unable to go himself. Mutawwifs desirous of visiting other “ pilgrimage countries ” must take care to return to the Hejaz before the month of Ramadan. 247. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Took refuge in July : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. Left voluntarily : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : Nil. 248. Monthly returns showing certain particulars of individual slaves manumitted are now being rendered for use with the League of Nations Slavery / Committee, and a memorandum has been forwarded summarising such particulars / from the 1 st January, 1930, to the 30th April, 1935. 1THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S G ^YERNfoteN^ EASTERN (Arabia).

The King s hunting seems to have taken up more of his time in April than was suggested in paragraph 105 of the last report. He spent all or most of m Mecca from the beginning of May until he left for Riyadh on the 19th May, arriving there on the 25th. This unusually early departure was put down to the absence from Nejd of the Amir Saud, but it may be suspected that His Majesty was glad of the excuse, as he cares little for any climate in the Hejaz and hates that of Taif, the summer capital. He did not pay his usual visit to Jedda before leaving. i 3 ! 8- heir a PP arent left Riyadh on the 4th May and got to Mecca on the 7th. He came to Jedda on the 13th, attended by the Amir Feisal and embarked next day for Naples in the Lloyd Triestino Victoria, which called specially. Everything was done to mark the importance of the occasion. The prince received the foreign representatives on the morning of the 13th and pre sided at a solemn tea-party at the palace that afternoon. His send-off on the 14th was highly official. His suite, however, was modest, consisting only of the King’s doctor, two secretaries and a servant. Fuad Bey Hamza duly joined the party at Port Said on the 16th May. The principal stages in the tour as far as London were to be, by dates of arrival, as follows :— Naples : May 19. Rome : May 20 for a stay of four days to be followed by three days elsewhere in Italy. Paris : May 28 or 29 for eight days. The Hague : June 8 for four days. London : June 15. The further programme has not been announced, but it is understood that the prince will stay about a month in England, when he will be the guest of His Majesty s Government for the first fortnight, and that he will visit Turkey, Syria and Iraq on his return journey. As regards Transjordan, see paragraph 154 139. The Amir Feisal tarried in Jedda only long enough to see his brother off, and moved into summer quarters at Taif a day or two after the Kins’s departure from Nejd He made himself felt even less than usual, if possible &amp; in foreign affairs, Fuad Bey Hamza having left for Syria on the 1st May (paragraph 107 of the last report), these were attended to by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin [431 aa—1] Bthe announcement of whose appointment as Acting Deputy Minister reached the foreign missions on the 6th May. Sheikh Yusuf did some business in Jedda during three short visits on the 6th-7th, 13th-15th and 20th May. He, too, left for Riyadh on the 21st, and though he still appears to be Acting Deputy Minister the foreign missions have since had to make the best of a little bottle- washer in the Ministry at Mecca. Even this young man went to Taif on the 30th. Then the telephone line to Taif proved to have broken down. 140. No events of importance were reported from the interior. There has been much talk, however, of the proposed administrative changes. The Governor of Jedda faded away, rather than vacated his post, some weeks ago. He was spoken of for Medina, but has been appointed to Taif. There was talk of a Royal prince for Jedda or of Fuad Bey Hamza eventually combining the post of Governor with that of Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. Another alternative which was considered was that of reviving the old system of making a local merchant Governor of the town only with the title of kaimakam. The post was apparently offered to the nephew of the last bearer of that title but was declined. An interim arrangement has now been made under which Sheikh Muhammad id Rawwaf, an Under-Secretary in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, hardly known to the foreign missions, will be Acting Governor. 141. The cruel old Governor of Medina, who was technically acting for one of the King’s sons, was recently summoned to headquarters and has been spoken of for Najran. His position at Medina may have been shaken by reports of poverty and perhaps some disorder in that area. The Legation has had to concern itself with one case, the facts of which are somewhat obscure, but in which a party of Palestinian pilgrims alleged that they had been waylaid and robbed between Yanbu and Medina. 142. A murderer was executed in Mecca early in May. These rare cases of lawful bloodshed in the holy city always attract some attention. 143. An Indian doctor was sent to Najran in or just before May in accordance with the decision mentioned in paragraph 114 of the last report. The difficulty of providing for the medical needs even of places much less remote is shown by the fact that the Government have recently advertised for a surgeon and an X-ray specialist to replace two men who are said to have been discontented because they, being Hejazis, were treated less favourably than the imported Syrians. These still form the bulk of the score or less of Government doctors in the whole of Saudi Arabia. 144. Changes were made in the customs tariff on or about the 14th May. The duty on petrol was reduced from 65 piastres miri gold to 55 piastres miri gold per case. Reduced duties were also fixed for artificial silk, tobacco, perfumes, Indian metal-ware and silver thread. Carbolic acid was exempted from duty, presumably to encourage its use as a disinfectant. The Government refrained from announcing these charges in the press, apparently for fear of attracting too much attention to their tolerance in the matter of tobacco and luxury articles. 145. Two other financial developments deserve mention. One of these, the payment of certain monies to His Majesty’s Government will be dealt with in paragraph 157 below. The other was the importation from India of 400,000 rupees. These would appear to have been purchased for account of Ibn Saud or his Government, possibly with the financial assistance of a local firm which does much business with the Government. This transaction has given rise to various conjectures. The most plausible explanation is that the King has decided to distribute his largesse in Nejd in Indian currency. Saudi riyals have never been popular in Eastern Arabia, and the lack of connexion between the Maria Theresa dollar and any outside currency has increased its disadvantages in official eyes, perhaps also in the eyes of the Nejdi public. 146. Mr. Twitchell’s gold-mining parties (paragraph 111 of last report), are still at work. Early in May they had collected some 400 samples for assay, but news of the result has not reached Jedda. There has been no confirmation of a rumour that a large number of workmen were killed by the collapse of a shaft. 147. Mr. Ydlibi left Jedda on the 1st May in the same steamer as Fuad Bey, with whom he is intimate. Nothing further has been heard of the projects mentioned in paragraph 112 of the last report.[431 aa—1] » 2 3 148. The most important economic event of the month has been the promul gation of a decree relative to the creation of the single motor transport company foreshadowed in paragraph 82 of the report for March. The general idea is to put all commercial transport, but not apparently Government vehicles, into the j hands of the new concern, which will be divided into two sections, with various sub-sections each having its own manager. Existing cars are to be valued, and I shares to the value thereof are to be assigned to the former owners. Details must be omitted, and the decree is obscure in many respects, e.g., as to how the concern j is to provide itself with liquid capital, and how running expenses, &amp;c., are to be financed until it shows a profit. It is also uncertain how, if at all, the new arrangements will affect Sharqieh’s (Limited) monopoly (paragraph 191 of the report for last August). 149. On the 7th May two machine guns, mounted on lorries, were observed in the desert some miles from Jedda, apparently being demonstrated by one or two Europeans. One of the party is understood to have been a Czechoslovak, but he left Jedda soon after and there is no evidence of his having done business. 150. On the 13th May Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., concluded a further contract on behalf of the Egyptian Shell to supply the Saudi Govern ment’s requirements of benzine, &amp;c., for another year. It w^as on much the same lines as that mentioned in paragraph 97 (b) of the report for May 1934. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 151. The Saut-al-Hejaz of the 7th May published without comment a short from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Yemen to Fuad Bey enclosing the report of the special commission appointed by the King of the Yemen to investigate the attempt on Ibn Sand’s life. The commission had been able to obtain some information regarding the antecedents of the assailants and their departure for the Hejaz, but admitted their complete inability to throw any light on their motives or connexions. Their most constructive suggestion was that, as one of the men had spent two long periods abroad, one in Abyssinia and the other in some unspecified foreign land, the plot might have been hatched abroad. “ You know their methods, Watson,’’ one can hear the commissioners saying to each other about those foreigners, and so say all of us regarding Yemeni sleuth work. 152. It was reported on the 21st May that a Zaydi Yemeni had been found in possession of three bombs in Jedda, and to have said that he picked them up outside the town. The affair does not seem prima facie serious, but it is too soon to judge. 153. A Saudi party of six armed persons entered Koweit territory on the 6th May, proceeded to certain places where Shammar and other tribesmen were encamped, and ordered them to move into Nejd. The party had apparently been sent by or under the authority of the Governor of Hasa. They were rounded up and taken to Koweit, whence they were allowed to return to Saudi Arabia. In pursuance of a request from the Sheikh of Koweit to the Political Agent, and with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the Legation addressed to the Saudi Government on the 19th May a protest couched in firm but courteous language, non-committal as regards the responsibility of the Governor of Hasa. The reply of the Saudi Government, very injured and defensive, did not reach the Legation until the 1st June. One intervening repercussion of the affair will be dealt with in paragraph 160 below. 154. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin informed Sir Andrew Ryan on the 15th May, with evident gratification, that the King had received a telegram from the Amir of Transjordan inviting the Amir Saud to visit him on his journey to or from Europe. The King had replied explaining that it was too late to alter the arrangements for the outward journey, as the prince was just leaving, but that he would gladly visit Amman on his way back. Four telegrams which passed between the two rulers were published in the Umm-ul-Qura of the 18th May. 155. The party from Damascus mentioned in paragraph 120 of the last report arrived in Jedda on their return journey on the 7th May having, it would appear, reached Medina on or about the 15th April, and Mecca about the 22nd April. They (or some of them, for some are reported from Damascus to have returned by sea) left a day or two later, intending to explore a shorter and easier route than that by which they had come.156. A report was current about mid-May that the Amir Feisal was to marry a lady of the family of Nuri Ash-Sha alan. This was doubtless the echo of a similar rumour circulated some time ago in Syria, where it had been denied. III. —Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 157. Relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Govern ment have continued to be good, but, in the circumstances explained in para graph 122 of the last report and in paragraph 139 above, little or no further progress has been made towards the settlement of outstanding questions. The Saudi Government have shown goodwill by consenting to the despatch of a R.A.F. aeroplane to convey Sir Andrew Ryan to Egypt in order to enable him to reach London in time for the arrival of the Amir Saud; and by agreeing to allow Captain G. de Gaury (paragraph 132 of the last report) to proceed overland to Koweit or Hasa on 'his way to Bagdad later in the summer. An even more remarkable attempt to please was the payment of the whole of the money due to His Majesty’s Government in respect of the Saudi share of the cost of the MacDonnell enquiry in 1930, and of 10 per cent, of the money due to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India for arms, &amp;c., supplied by the latter to Ibn Saud in 1929. 158. Further discussion regarding the effect of the Bahrein negotiations (paragraph 123 of the last report) and the form to be given to any definite agreement has revealed unexpected difficulties which have not yet been solved. 159. Despite the good state of Anglo-Saudi relations generally, the position in regard to two matters is unsatisfactory. 160. Arrangements had been made for the delegates to the Koweit Conference (paragraph 124 of the last report) to leave Hasa on the 23rd May. On the 26th May the Ministry for Foreign Affairs telegraphed that they would start next day, mentioned for the first time a Qusaibi as one of the delegates and renewed an enquiry which Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had addressed orally to Sir Andrew Ryan regarding telegraphic facilities. Four hours later the same official telephoned urgently that, in view of the protest relative to the incident mentioned in paragraph 153 above, the delegates could not start unless the Saudi Government were assured that the party would be allowed to carry arms. The Minister expressed extreme surprise at this attempt to couple two such disparate matters, but consulted the Political Agent at Koweit as to the acceptability of armed guards to accompany the delegates. The sheikh considered them unnecessary, but agreed, subject to a hope that the numbers would be reasonable. Further enquiries by the Legation elicited the facts that the delegates were to be Hamad Suleiman, Khalid-al-Qarqani and Abdul Aziz Qusaibi, and that it was proposed to send with them fifty attendants, including twenty-eight armed guards. This appeared to Sir Andrew Ryan to be a deliberate counter demonstration inspired by a legitimate protest against a serious violation of Koweit territory, and he' had to resubmit the whole matter to His Majesty’s Government. 161. The question of the Government of India dispensaries continues to be a bone of contention. The discussion contemplated early in the year (paragraph 23 of the last report) was crowded out until the 30th April, when Fuad Bey gave Sir Andrew Ryan the draft of a proposed regulation on medical staff and dispensaries maintained by foreign missions. This gave rise to further inconclusive discussion in May with Sheikh Tusuf Yasin, who is never so contentious as when he asserts the abstract thesis that dispensaries on the present lines are imyerium in irfi'perio. The draft, which, however defensible on that ground, would gravely imperil the position of the dispensaries, has been submitted to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. In the meanwhile, it has been necessary to order further supplies from Egypt, and customs duty on these will probably have to be paid under protest. 162. The Italian Government have made a great fuss over the Amir Saud. So far as the Jedda end is concerned, they not only arranged to divert the ship named in paragraph 139 above, but sent the destroyer Pant era from Massawa to escort the prince out of the harbour. The Italian Charge d’Affaires accompanied the prince, who, on his way out to the Victoria, visited the Pantera. The increase in the number of official and unofficial Italians in Jedda has been a notable feature of the last few months. A Chancelier has been added to the Legation staff. Ther 5 Tripolitan dragoman has been replaced by a half-caste Italian with a white wife and a black sister. The doctor mentioned in paragraph 69 of the report for February is apparently not officially connected with the Legation and has moved with his wife to a home in the town. A merchant named Odello has set himself up in independent general business. 163. Phis Saut-al-Hejaz newspaper, which seems to take a special interest in the subject, continues to receive good news of “ our Eagles in Italy,” as in a happy recent flight it called the student aviators sent to be trained in that country. 164. I wo members of the Soviet Legation left with their wives on the 19th May. One of them, the doctor, was said to have fallen foul of his Minister, a matter worth mentioning only because, according to one version, he had been consorting with the White Russian airmen. The King is said to have added to his household a Russian lady doctor, apparently a Moslem. 165. The local press stated on the 21st May that the Governor of Suez had met the Amir Saud officially on behalf of the Egyptian Government when the Victoria passed through. According to another account it was the Egyptian consul-designate in Jedda who met the prince. Anyhow, he was met, and he is reported to have addressed a message of greeting to the Egyptian nation. These are matters of some interest in connexion with the curious position between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. (Paragraph 96 of the report for March.) 166. Nothing else calls for mention under this head except that by the end of May only three titular heads of missions, the British, the Russian and the French, remained at their posts in Jedda; and that the new Afghan Legation showed its flag for the first time on the 24th May. IV .—M iscellaneous. 167. The Jubilee of their Majesties the King and Queen was celebrated in Jedda as adequately as local conditions permit. Isolated as it is, it is one of the historic meeting places of west and east. For that reason, if no other, the celebration merits some record, although various details must be omitted. 168. A general reception at the Legation on the 6th May was attended b* about 130 guests, including Sheikh Yusuf Yasin who brought special messages from the King and the Amir Feisal, practically all members of foreign missions, many local notables and numerous Indians including some fourteen pilgrims of good standing. The British and Indian staff and the remnants of the European British community dined that evening at the Legation, a party of twenty-four. 169. A party for children, mostly Indian, on the afternoon of the 8th May was a greater tour de force. Every preliminary count differed from the last. Big girls in veils could not meet small boys in skirts. It had to be considered whether a married woman could still be rated as a child. There was whooping- cough about. Despite all these difficulties, Lady Ryan, greatly assisted by the Indian medical officer and others, mobilised about sixty children at a remote part. of the seashore, where they showed great enthusiasm for games and races. Reinforced by the bigger girls, they were afterwards given a cinema show at the Legation, including a film by Mr. Oppenheim recording a journey from Liverpool to Jedda. 170. Three of the Legation houses were illuminated during the three days. The Indian vice-consul’s display shone like a good deed far into the nauo-htv desert. J 171. Sir Andrew Ryan received memorials expressing loyalty from Indians in Jedda, Indians in Mecca and Hadhramis in Mecca. A telegram to the Foreign Office, conveying these and other British congratulations, elicited a gracious expression of the King’s satisfaction. 172. A collection made, as the result of a private initiative, for King George’s Jubilee Trust, with a maximum limit of £1 per individual yielded £44 odd subscribed by 85 persons, European British and Moslem. 173. Mr. Haliburton (paragraph 132 of the last report) was received by Ibn Saud on the Jedda-Mecca road on the 5th May. He asked the King whether, if he embraced Islam, he would be allowed to go to Mecca. The King replied that he was not an authority on religious law. The interpreter fainted after the first quarter of an hour. Mr. Haliburton persevered and got some not unsuccessful photographs He had himself taken in pilgrim garb by a local artist before he left on the 12th May.■iwim JS9£flBK2Eti 6 174. Princess Nigadama de Torhout (variant, Nirgidma of the Torgots), a Mongolian lady, who has lived in Peking and Paris, arrived in Jedda on the 26th May as an envoyee speciale of the Paris Journal. She stayed at the local hotel but only until the 29th May when she left again for Suez. This lady was brought to the notice of Mr. Calvert in England last March by the secretary of the Royal Central Asian Society. She did not, however, call at the Legation. 175. Poets who write up May should be sent to do time in Jedda. This habitually unpleasant month surpassed itself in unpleasantness this year. Spells of great heat and humidity were punctuated by frequent bursts of simoon, hotter though less humid. The insect life was on the wing. The proceedings were varied on the 8th, 11th and 21st May, by three great storms, quite abnormal for the time of year. They brought all the discomforts of wind, rain, thunder and lightning but very little after-refreshment. One of them rounded off the Jubilee party for children on the 8th May. 176. Practically all this year’s pilgrims from overseas had left Jedda by the end of May. The Legation had to repatriate as destitutes 512 Indians during the month. 177. The position as regards the manumission of slaves by the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male. Took refuge in May : 4 males. Manumitted and repatriated : 4 males. Locally manumitted : Nil. Left voluntarily : 1 male. On hand at the end of the month : Nil. 178. One of the slaves who took refuge had fled from the household of the King’s brother Abdullah. In view of the precedent recorded in paragraph 136 of the last report, the usual procedure was followed. On the present occasion Sheikh Yusuf Yasin made a half-hearted attempt to bounce Sir Andrew Ryan out of repatriating the slave, but it was successfully resisted. 179. The ex-slave mentioned in paragraph 73 of the report for February gave birth to a little sherif on the 19th May, 1935. Mother and child are doing well. It is only fair to say that the former owner kept his bargain handsomely, and it is hoped that he will look after the woman as well as the baby.[406 aa— 1] b THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S ^OYERNyiENl EASTERN (Arabia).

Jedda Report for April 1935. I .—Internal Affairs. 105. Ibn Saud returned from Jedda to Mecca on the 4th April accompanied by the heir apparent. His Majesty spent the rest of the month in Mecca except for occasional jaunts into the country for hunting. 106. The King's brother, Muhammad, left Mecca for Riyadh on the 9th April, and was followed by the heir apparent on the 16th April. Nothing was heard of the Amir Feisal, who, as usual, left all matters of foreign affairs to Fuad Bey Hamza. The latter paid several short visits to Jedda, but was incapacitated more than once by a form of heart disease from which he suffers. 107. One of the principal topics of the month was the projected tour of the heir apparent in Europe. (Paragraph 56 of the report for February.) He is to leave Jedda for Naples on the 14th May. He will visit Italy and France and will probably make short stays in Switzerland and Holland. He is due in London on the 15th June and proposes to stay about a month in England. It is under stood that on his return journey he will visit Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Fuad Bey Hamza left Jedda on the 1st May to deposit his wife in Syria before rejoining the Prince at Port Said and attending him on his travels. 108. No internal events of importance were reported during the month. 109. The Saudi aircraft were not seen in Jedda. The additional six student-aviators selected for training in Italy (paragraph 81 of the last report) duly proceeded thither. The Saut-al-Hejaz of the 23rd April announced the receipt of a letter from one of them saying that they had been most kindly received and had been allowed to fly alone in a special aeroplane, after preliminary training. 110. The Saut-al-Hejaz of the 30th April announced the departure of a mission of inspection and administrative reorganisation for Asir. 111. The Dutch Moslem, M. Van de Poll, who has gone in with the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (paragraph 82 of the last report) came to Jedda for a night on the 18th April to collect some assaying plant. He brought news that Mr. Twitched and his companions were busy investigating the tailings left from ancient workings at the Cot of Gold and one or two other places and potential alluvial gold at Yanbu’ Dagh. They had not yet found gold, but were full of hope. 112. Mr. Abdul Ghani Ydlibi (paragraph 122 of the report for last June) arrived in Jedda on the 19th April. His principal objective appeared to be to2 make further efforts to secure the Koweit Neutral Zone Oil Concession for his i^ e assi ^ re d.Sir Andrew Ryan that he had as good as got a concession for the whole Red Sea littoral, including the area in the North-Western Hejaz, Asir and the Farsan Islands. He hoped also to get an option for the construction of a Mecca-Jedda Railway. Little has been heard of this project since the cancel lation ot the Jeelani Concession (paragraph 123 of the report for June), but a French group are said to be interested, and Mr. Ydlibi thought he might as well try to cut them out. He admitted that there were difficulties in the way of the scheme for a bank which he propounded last year, but not that he had abandoned it. He said nothing about another project with which he is said to be associated, viz., the provision by Roumanian interests of bulk storage for oil, &amp;c. at Jedda, Rabigh and Yanbu’. Nor did he refer to an episode in his past, which may now lead to legal proceedings between the Calico Printers’ Association (Limited) and two British shipping lines. The association supplied T ui SOme i VG y earsa g 0 Wlth lar g e quantities of goods which were shipped to Jedda and some of which were cleared by his agents on the guarantee of the latter, without production of the bills of lading. The guarantee was not redeemed. Ihe amounts left unpaid by Mr. Ydlibi are said to exceed £20,000. 112a. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company started their drilling operations at Jebel Dhahran on the 30th April, after some delay due, according re P? rt ’ to iabour difficulties, but, according to their agent in Jedda to difficulties m connexion with the water supply, which have now been overcome, fn 11 v ^{ en ^ on w iP be made later of the most important economic event of the month, the conclusion of a new agreement regarding the external telegraphic communications of Saudi Arabia. ° F 114. Twu. announcements of medical interest were made during' April, viz that a hospital was to be established in Najran and that a doctor was being sent to Jaui to combat an outbreak of some sort of fever in that area. 11 5. The 24th April was a red-letter day in Jedda. On that evening a Marconi wireless receiving set began to make itself heard in the “ Jedda Hotel.” it has attracted admiring audiences, and we can now compete with Tebuk where according to a report from Transjordan, the Governor and his entourage have a set amd have fallen through the ether, for the charms of an Egyptian lady artiste named l mm Kalthan. The Jedda set is very powerful and the Jedda Hotel is next door to the British Legation. II. Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 116. There was again no news from the Yemen frontier. Nothing further has been disclosed of what has passed between the Saudi and Yemeni Governments about the attempt on Ibn Saud’s life in March. 117. Abdul Aziz-al-Idrisi, one of the three important members of the former ruling family of Asir, whom the Imam surrendered to Ibn Sand last year died about the 5th April. • • n j' u Th ^ T J aqi Char g® d’Affaires left by sea on the 7th April, having received the draft agreement mentioned in paragraph 87 of the last report, uncertainty seemed to prevail as to the further course of the negotiations. There was some question of Fuad Bey Hamza going to Bagdad to conduct them, but he himself intimated later in the month that this mission might be entrusted to Sheikh i usuf Yasin. 119 The l mm al Qura published on the 12th April the numbers of pilgrims who had come by overland motor routes. The figures for Iraq were 73 boy scouts and 311 others. These numbers were even more disappointing than had been expected, but the boy scouts seem to have been a success, witness an announcement early in April that the young men of Mecca were preparing a record in book form of the visit, to include all the speeches and poems to which it gave rise. One hundred and six pilgrims were stated to have come by car from Koweit. 120. The nationalist delegates from Syria, who were mentioned in para- graph 92 of the last report, returned early in April to Damascus, again travelling via Bagdad. It is now clear that these were the same delegates whose alleged proposals to the King for the creation of an Arab Empire elicited the denial mentioned in paragraph 90 of the same report. Whatever they were after in[406 aa—1] B 2 3 Iraq and the Hejaz, there is no reason to suppose that they got much encourage ment from Ibn Saud, or that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs is identified with their schemes to the extent suggested in certain circles in Syria. Towards the end of the month a party of merchants and transporters arrived overland from Damascus by car. Their object is to study the possibilities of organising regular motor transport from Syria. They were so long on the road and the scheme is so likely to be frowned upon by the French authorities in Syria that its success must be regarded as very doubtful. 121. Further evidence has accumulated of the activities of Palestinian agitators in Mecca during this year's pilgrimage. On the 18th April, however, Fuad Bey Hamza assured Sir Andrew Ryan that the Saudi Government had warned the distributor of the pamphlet mentioned in paragraph 92 of the last report and seized the remaining copies of it. Fuad Bey declared emphatically that it was the policy of his Government not to allow the exploitation of the pilgrimage for political purposes and foreshadowed measures next year to cope with the problem presented by the annually increasing numbers of intellectuals, politicians, &amp;c., who make the pilgrimage. It was intended not to discourage them from coming but to restrain them from undesirable activities. III. —Relations with Powers Outside A rabia. 122. Some little further progress was made with the negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government for the settlement of outstanding questions. On the 3rd April Fuad Bey handed to Sir Andrew Ryan a statement of the Saudi Government's views regarding their eastern and south eastern frontiers. As was to be expected, their claims are enormous. Sir Andrew Ryan riposted with the offer which His Majesty’s Government had decided to make in the first instance and confirmed the offer in a memorandum on the 9th April. The subject has not been further discussed, as, in view of b uad Bey s approaching departure, it w-as agreed later in the month that the conversations on this and various other questions should be resumed during his visit to London in the summer. 123. I he Saudi delegates to the Bahrein Conference (paragraph 93 (a) of the last report) left the island on the 10th April after exchanging letters with the Bahrein representative, t hese letters appeared to represent an agreement in principle on the various issues discussed, which could be embodied in a formal Anglo-Saudi exchange of notes. A conversation between Sir Andrew Ryan and Fuad Bey on the 30th April suggests doubt as to whether the Saudi Government regard the letters as constituting more than a partial agreement. The situation still requires clearing up. 124. The same Saudi delegates are to attend the Koweit Conference, but they have been slow movers, and seem unlikely to reach Koweit before the middle of May. 125. I he Saudi Government have extended for six lunar months from the 5th April the period within which persons permanentlv resident in the country, who claim foreign nationality, must produce evidence of it. 126. An agreement between the Saudi and Sudan Governments, as joint owners of the Jedda-Port Sudan cable, and the two interested companies (paragraph 93 (e) of the last report), was signed in Jedda on the 17th April. The pi incipal effects of it are (#) to provide for a reduction of the full rate per word transmitted over the cable from 1-50 gold francs to 1T21 gold francs; and {h) to give the companies a monopoly of all the external telegraphic communications of Saudi Arabia, whether by cable or wireless, except as regards countries in the Arabian Peninsula, including Syria and Iraq. The charges for wireless messages will be the same as for those sent by cable. The agreement was made for twenty-five years, but either party may terminate it at the end of each successive period of five years. There is no space for an account of various details, some of which are important. The agreement was signed by Sir Andrew Ryan on behalf of the Sudan Government, subject to confirmation on receipt of the final text of which they had already received an adequate preliminary draft. The deleo-ates left Jedda on the 18th April.4 127. The friendly atmosphere described in paragraph 94 of the last report was maintained throughout April. In particular, great attention was shown to the cable and wireless delegates. The King sent the heir appaien s . e ^ er ^J iunior princes to a party aboard the cable ship on the 3rd April, and he himself entertained the delegates and members of the Legation at dinner that evening. r 128. A small Ethiopian mission arrived in Jedda on the /tn April, bringing rich gifts and proposals for a treaty of friendship, on the same lines, appaiently, as one they had just concluded at Sana. They were well received, and the King gave them an audience and a dinner on the Mecca—Jedda road on the 10th Apul. Nothing important seems to have come of the visit, however, as the Saudi Loiem inent thought the moment inopportune for the conclusion of e\en an anodyne treaty. The mission left for Suez on the 15th. o j- 129. There were no important developments in the relations between Saudi Arabia and other Powers. The Italians are showing their usual eagerness to oblige in connexion with the heir apparent’s tour. An Italian ship will call tor him at Jedda on the 14th May, and he will be accompanied by the Italian Lharge d’Affaires. The Corps diplomatique as a whole is rapidlv dismtegiating as summer comes nigh. The Netherlands Charge left on the 22nd Apiil to take up his additional post at Bagdad (paragraph 95 of the last report), and hoped to go on to Holland for the Saudi Royal visit. The Afghan Minister, who had presented his credentials in Jedda on the 1st April and then gone to Medina, returned to Egypt on the 15th. The Egyptian acting consul was to lea\e on the 1st May, without awaiting the new incumbent of the post, who was appointed last autumn, but has not yet appeared. The departure of the Iiaqi Chaige has already been mentioned. IV.— Miscellaneous. 130. The French sloop Bougainville, a smart new vessel, arrived in Jedda on the 6th April, with Rear-Admiral Rivet, commanding the Naval Dhision in the Levant, on board. She had made an extensive voyage from the Persian Cult and left for the last lap of it on the 9th April. „ 131. Mr. H. St. J. B. Philby, accompanied by his wife, left by car tor Koweit on the 3rd April, intending to go all the way by car to London He was still dissatisfied with the attitude of the Saudi authorities as regards his motor business (paragraph 82 of the last report), but maintains his friendship with the Kino-. He will be away for some time, but there is probably no truth m one story, namely, that he intends to spend two years in England and to stand for ci r 1 1 cLinc n t 132. Captain G. S. H. V. de Gaury, who has for some years been seconded from the army for service under the Air Ministry, joined the staff of the Legation in Jedda as temporary honorary attache on the 22nd April. By the same ship arrived Lord Alington, on a private visit, and a new addition to the staff in Jedda of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. Other Western visitors included a Mr. Haliburton, a United States citizen, who has some name as a writer and journalist. He is a young man of great assurance and a strong sense of the commercial possibilities of the lighter and less accurate literature of tiavel. 133. The majority of the pilgrims had left the Hejaz by the end of April. Hardly any remain of the high personages and intellectuals mentioned in paragraph 100 of the last report. Ihe Badshah Begum of Hydeiabad ^.pd her party sailed on the 22nd April in the steamship Islami, the latest addition to the Turner Morrison fleet. A reception on board this vessel on the 19th April enabled people in Jedda to see for themselves the improvements described m paragraph 324 of the report for December. 134. Some interest attaches to the participation in this year s pilgrimage of four Japanese, who are understood to have recently embraced Islam. 135 The Saudi Government have prohibited the departure to the Dutch East Indies of mutawwifs, i.e., pilgrim guides. They are said to be considering a similar restriction in regard to India. The practice whereby these persons go to the countries of origin to recruit pilgrims leads to various abuses, and it is held in certain Saudi circles that the object of stimulating the flow of pilgrims may be better achieved by intensifying their own propaganda. Various schemes for doing this have been much talked of. One, which has an indirect bearing on the sup] the Legthe subject, is the proposed despatch of a non-official mission, enjoying the moral support of the Government, to urge the claims of the Holy Land to the revenues of the Haramayn Wakfs in various countries. 136. The position as regards the manumission of slaves bv the British Legation was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 2 males, 1 female. Took refuge in April : 1 male. Manumitted and repatriated : 1 male, 1 female. Locally manumitted : nil. Left voluntarily : 1 male. On hand at the end of the month : 1 male. One of the male slaves who took refuge in April belonged to the King’s brother, the Amir Muhammad, but the Saudi authorities have onered no opposition to his being dealt with in the usual manner.

ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for March 1935. I .—Internal Affairs. 74. THE King, having left Rawdat-al-Khafs about four days earlier, arrived in Mecca on the 10th March with a posse of princes. He was preceded by at least two of his brothers, including the Amir Muhammad, with whom he is still believed to have been at loggerheads some little time ago. He was closely followed by the heir apparent, a rare visitant to the Hejaz. An unusually large number of notabilities attended the King's annual dinner to distinguished pilgrims on the 12th March. Ex-King Amanullah of Afghanistan sat on his right, and on his left was Seyyid Abdullah-al-Wazir, who had come last year as representative of the King of the Yemen for the peace negotiations. 75. The event of the month was the attempt on the King’s life three days later. He and the Amir Baud had returned from Arafat early on the 15th and were engaged in the last important rite of the pilgrimage, i.e., the circumambulation of the Kaaba, followed by the Sai or running between Safa and Marwa. They were about halfway through the circumambulation when a man armed with a dagger attacked the King. He was shot down, as were two others who followed on. The King sustained no injury, except a slight peppering in the leg, which was at first attributed to a bomb but afterwards, more plausibly, to splinters struck out of the pavement by the firing of his guards. The Amir Baud, who had come to his father’s assistance, was slightly wounded in the shoulder. Two guards were wounded, and one or both may have lost their lives. Both the King and his heir completed the circumambulation, but apparently gave up the Sai and returned, according to custom, to Mina. 76. Opinion in the King's entourage was greatly inflamed. There could be little doubt that the assailants were Zeydis from the Yemen, and it might have gone hard with the thousands of Yemenis who had come on pilgrimage, perhaps also with other pilgrims in Mecca and at Mina, had not Ibn Baud himself used a restraining influence. With a good sense equal to his courage, he forbade all reprisals. The police naturally made some arrests, but there was no disorder after the first surprise. Abdullah-al-Wazir continued to be treated as an honoured guest. The investigation confirmed the Saudi authorities in the conviction that the assailants were Zeydi Yemenis, and people in Mecca were very ready to believe that they were set on by high personages, not indeed by the Imam Yahya himself, but by others, possibly by his eldest son, Seyf-al-lslam Ahmed, who has been notoriously dissatisfied and restless since the war. The Saudi Government have been very careful not to endorse these suggestions. Ibn Baud himself exonerated the Imam in an interview to journalists on the 19th March. He was more guarded in his reply to an enquiry about Seyf-al-lslam Ahmed, saying that many things were said about many persons and that rumour could not be taken as a guide.2 77. Telegrams of congratulation poured in on the King, one of the first being that from His Majesty King George. It is curious, however, to note how many heads of States, especially republics, who have relations with or have recognised Ibn Saud, ignored the occasion. These defaulters included Messrs. Ataturk, Roosevelt and Stalin. The most interesting telegrams were two from the Imam, who, using all his habitual forms of piety, expressed horror and joy, refused to believe that the assailants were Yemenis and suggested that, if they were, they must have been instigated by some evil hand outside the Yemen. The King’s own subjects were profuse in their loyalty. A Hejazi national tea-party was given in Mecca on the 20th March to celebrate His Majesty’s escape. A smaller party in Jedda on the 31st March was attended by the foreign representatives, and four orators spoke the sentiments of the inhabitants in the presence of the king and the heir apparent. Two of the speakers stressed the note that the crime had been engineered by the enemies of Islam. Their language was very much stronger than the tea. 78. Among the many functions at Mecca during the month was a great parade of Nejdi troops, numbering, it is said, 30.000. The King was present, but the Amir Saud led the sword dance, which, it appears, has been a regular feature of such displays in the capital since its revival in 1931 (see paragraphs 9 and 8 respectively of the reports for January-February and March-April of that year). 79. The King and the heir apparent came to Jedda early on the 30th March. The usual reception of foreign representatives was delayed a day owing to a kingly colic and the remedial measures it necessitated. On the 31st March His Majesty appeared to be in good form, if not so spontaneously lively as he sometimes is. The heir apparent gave a series of separate audiences concurrently with the King. The physical resemblance between them was again noticed both by those who had not seen the prince since 1930, when he was last in Jedda, and those who saw him for the first time. He was very self-possessed and very amiable, but does not impress one as having anything like his father’s personality. 80. Fuad Bey Hamza was in Jedda on the 1st March, on the 24th-25th March and from the 29th March over the end of the month. 81. The Saudi aircraft would appear to have remained in Taif throughout the month. Another batch of six youths were chosen to go to Italy to be trained in aviation, and were stated to have been passed fit after a medical examination in Jedda. If they proceed to Italy, they will bring the total of students up to ten, the maximum number which the Italian Government promised to accept. Little \ more has been heard of the Arab Aeronautical Society, except as the recipient of fairly handsome subscriptions from certain distinguished pilgrims. It may be inferred that its promoters are working hard in Mecca. 82. No new economic developments were’ reported during the month. Mr. Twitched and his colleagues in the service of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (paragraph 44 of the last report) duly started for their possible gold fields in the first week of March, and nothing has been heard of them since. Mr. Philby was extremely dissatisfied with the motor transport arrangements for the pilgrimage and accuses the Government of manipulating the distribution of pilgrims among cars in a manner disadvantageous to Sharqieh (Limited) (paragraph 45 of the last report). He is promoting a scheme for a single transport organisation to supply all the requirements of the Government and the pilgrims, who are catered for at present by four companies under Government auspices and a larger number of private concerns. 83. The electrical plant intended for the Great Mosque at Mecca (paragraph 48 of the last report) is still lying in Jedda. This was a great disappointment to the donor, who himself came on pilgrimage for the first time in a long life and hoped to see the result of his benevolence in Mecca. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 84. No trouble was reported from the Yemen frontier. The courier mentioned in paragraph 51 of the last report would appear to have returned to Sanaa, as one of the Imam’s telegrams to Ibn Saud, after the attempt on the King’s life, began by acknowledging the receipt of a letter the kindness of which had almost broken the recipient’s heart, to quote his own phrase. It is too soon to say whether Saudi-Yemeni relations are likely to be affected by the attempt. No conclusion can safely be drawn from the King’s continued gracious-ness towards Abdullah-al-Wazir with whom he had had personal relations different from those usually subsisting between a sovereign and an envoy. On general grounds, however, it seems probable that I bn Saud will not wish to let the affair affect outwardly his relations with the Yemen. This probability is strengthened by a communique in the Umm-al-Qura of the 29th March denying officially a report in an Egyptian paper that the Saudi Government had addressed a memorandum to the Government of the Yemen regarding the alleged connexion between the criminals and Yemeni officials and had requested them to enquire into the matter and punish the guilty. 85. It is entertaining to read in the same number of the Umm-al-Qura a statement that Seyf-al-Islam Ahmed (paragraph 76 above) had presented 100 sacks of millet for the poor of Medina. 86. Abdullah-al-Wazir was in Jedda on the 25th March arranging for the return by sea of certain Yemeni pilgrims. A day or two later he went on to Medina. 87. The Saudi Government have been following with close attention the evolution of the political situation in Bagdad. They were probably gratified to see Nuri Pasha included as Minister for Foreign Affairs in both the Cabinets formed there in March. One of the first acts of the second of these was apparently to instruct the Iraqi Charge in Jedda to geVyvith negotiations on various matters. These are not in themselves, so far as is known, of high political importance, but they have long been outstanding. The Iraqi Charge was expecting on the 30th March to receive the text of a draft agreement prepared by the Saudi Government. 88. Four convoys of cars are said to have been run from Nejef to Medina under the motor route agreement mentioned in paragraph 53 of the last report- The results of the experiment have not apparently been unsatisfactory from the point of view of the trying out of a new route, but the smallness of the number carried has caused disappointment. Exact figures have not been published, but the total probably did not exceed 450 at the outside, including a party of boy scouts.! 89. The Iraqi boy scouts, many of them stalwart adults, added a new; feature to the pilgrimage. The King himself entertained them in Mecca and made a speech applauding their movement and stressing the importance of Saudi relations with Iraq. The well-grown lads were a conspicuous feature at a reception at the Iraqi Legation in Jedda on the 21st March in honour of King Ghazi’s birthday. They provided a guard of honour to receive the guests. They also sang. 90. In the interview mentioned in paragraph 76 the King allowed the journalists to elicit expressions of his sympathetic interest in various Arab or quasi-Arab countries, viz., Egypt, Iraq/Palestine and Morocco. The omission of Syria may have some significance. In this connexion it may be noted that the official communique mentioned in paragraph 84 above also denied a report in the same Egyptian newspaper that delegates from Syria had suggested to the King the creation of an Arab Empire. 91. The Umm-al-Qura of the 29th March published a sort of encyclical addressed by Ibn Saud to the Moslem world, Arabs generally and his own subjects thanking all those who had manifested sympathy on the occasion of his escape, especially Moslems and Arabs, to whom he ascribed as one motive devotion to the sanctuary which had been profaned. 92. There have been notable signs this year of a tendency to make use of the Hejaz in pilgrimage time for the ventilation of Arab propaganda. Various politicos came from Palestine and a very hot anti-Jewish pamphlet was circulated. There was talk of the formation of a Palestinian pilgrims’ club in Mecca. A so-called delegation from Syria consisting of Dr. Jamil Mardan, Fakhri Bey Barudi and Shafiq Bey Jabri arrived via Bagdad and the overland route from Nejef. HI -—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 93. Some progress has been made with the negotiations for the settlement oi various questions outstanding between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government. The position in regard to several of these underwent no substantial alteration in March, but the following points may be noted :— [381 ff—2] ' B 24 (a) The Saudi delegates to the local conference at Bahrein (see paragiaph 57 of the last report) arrived there on the 9th March. Ihe conference was still proceeding, apparently on promising lines at the end of the month. (b) It is hoped that the same delegates will go on to Koweit in the near future for the proposed local conference, which the Saudi Government have agreed should be held there. (c) Fuad Bev Hamza communicated to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 30th March two documents relative to the future of the 1 reaty of Jedda and to slavery. The objective of the Saudi Government is to induce His Majesty s Government to renounce their right of manumitting slaves in consideration of the promulga tion of regulations on slavery, a draft of which Fuad Bey submitted for consideration; and to arrange for the validity of the treaty of Jedda to be prolonged for ten years subject to certain provisos of which this renunciation would be the most important. (d) His Majesty’s Government approved on the 28th March of the attitude of Sir Andrew Ryan in regard to the question of nationality, as described in paragraph 5 of the appendix to the report for February. (e) Admiral H. W. Grant, C.B., R.N., retired, a director of Cable and Wireless (Limited), and Mr. H. R, Staples, the Port Sudan manager of the Eastern Telegraph Company, arrived in Jedda on the 31st March to negotiate with the Saudi Government regarding the external telegraphic communications of Saudi Arabia (see paragraph 58 of the last report). 94. Few other matters of importance to Anglo-Saudi relations were discussed during the month. The atmosphere has been one of extreme friendliness and desire to appear accommodating on the Saudi side. When the King received His Majesty’s Minister in formal audience on the 31st March he wound up the conversation with an outburst of extreme cordiality, appealing for Sir Andrew Ryan’s services as a “mediator’’ and treating him to the most prolonged Royal handshake that he has ever enjoyed. 95. There is little to record in connexion with the relations of other Powers with Saudi Arabia or their representatives. The French and Netherlands Charges returned to Jedda in March from Syria and the Yemen respectively. The Netherlands representative has now been appointed Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad also. The Turkish Charge left a day or two before the pilgrimage. The new Belgian consul (paragraph 64 of the last report) went to Brussels at the beginning of the month. The Afghan Minister in Cairo (paragraph 66 of the last report) was in the Hejaz for the pilgrimage and attended many functions, but had not presented credentials as Minister in this country up to the end of the month, doubtless because the Saudi Government cling to their doctrine of no diplomacy in Mecca. To anticipate by a day he presented them in Jedda on the 1st April. 96. The relations between Saudi Arabia and Egypt continue to evolve on lines of much unofficial sympathy, the manifestations of which may be the prelude to Egyptian recognition of Ibn Saud. if the factor of King Fuad’s personal hostility to the idea can be eliminated. Although no direct messages could pass on the occasion of Ibn Saud’s escape, the Saudi agent in Egypt (who seems to be treated with increasing consideration) reported expressions of sympathy by high Egyptian personages, including the Prime Minister, as well as by other persons; and a good many of the telegrams addressed to the King came from distinguished Egyptians, including Prince Mohammad Ali, Prince Omar Toussoun and Nahas Pasha “ on behalf of the Wafd and the Egyptian nation.” IV .—M iscellaneous. 97. H.M.S. Penzance, Commander R. H. Bevan, R.N., visited Jedda from the 12th to 17th March. She took part in the usual regatta for the pilgrim fleet, which was held on the 16th. One of the features of this year’s regatta was a new pulling race, for a challenge cup presented by the Central Sports Committee of the Mediterranean lleet. This presentation gave all the more pleasure as it was made expressly to mark appreciation of the almost unique opportunity which the occasion affords for close intercourse between the navy and the merchant marine.5 98. The Pilgrimage Day was fixed for the 14th March, after prolonged discussion as to when the new moon had been seen. Many hoped that the King would accept the view that it had been seen a day late, in which case the pilgrimage would have fallen on Friday, the 15th. His Majesty probably took an honest decision on the evidence, but many were disappointed at being deprived of the special blessing of a Friday Haj. There were some to suggest that he was influenced by an ancient superstition that, whatever the virtue of a Friday Haj for the multitude, it is unlucky for rulers to have two Khutbas or ceremonial religious addresses on one day. 99. It is probable that from 65,000 to 70,000 persons “ stood on Arafat on the 14th. The official estimate of overseas pilgrims was 33.898, including 11,113 Indians, 5,361 Egyptians, 4,609 Dutch East Indians and 2,880 NortE Africans, these being the largest contingents. The improvement on last year’s total was even greater than had been expected. Sanitary conditions were again good. There was no difficulty in accepting the verdict of cleanness passed by the Saudi Government on the 21st March, so that ships returning south to British destinations were dispensed from calling at Kamaran. The Alexandria Quarantine Board declared the pilgrimage clean on the 29th March. 100. This year’s pilgrimage has been remarkable for the number of highly placed personages who took part, as well as for the number of what may be called intellectuals. Ex-King Amanullah of Afghanistan came at short notice, ostensibly to enable his mother to make the Haj, but not without political motives as well. He was much frequented by certain Afghan elements and by numerous Indians. He wept copiously during his receptions and was overcome by emotion at the King’s banquet and during the ceremonial washing of the Kaaba, in which only the highest take part. Luckily his stay was short, as he arrived from Italy only on the 10th March and left for Massawa en route again for Italy on the 24th March, after a quick dash to Medina. The Nawab of Bahawalpur (paragraph 72 of the last report) was followed by the senior wife of the Nizam ■of Hyderabad with a large suite and by a widow of the late Nizam travelling separately. Perhaps the most notable of the other Indians was Colonel Nawab Sir Umar Hayat Khan, G.B.E., &amp;c., an honorary A.D.C. to His Majesty the King. The Glawi, grandest of Moroccan Grand Kaids, also came, but so unostentatiously as to attract little attention. The surfeit of great personages has imposed a strain on the Saudi Government, but has made them very happy as boost for the pilgrimage. They have published a list of sums given for benevolent purposes, headed by the name of a wealthy Egyptian lady named Qut-al-Qulub or Food of Hearts' The Badshah Begum‘of Hyderabad is down for donations to a total of 7.000 rupees, including 1,000 for‘the Arab Aeronautical Society, which has had some other windfalls as well. One English Moslem lady from Egypt, a Miss Wentworth-Fitzwilliam. in Islam “ Aisha,” also made the pilgrimage. 101. The overland pilgrimage by car from India was again attempted in spite of the warnings issued by the Government of India and with results which justified them. The exact facts are not yet known, but parties which travelled via Nejef had to change into Iraqi cars, and one party which travelled via Koweit arrived too late. 102. Dr. van der Hoog (paragraph 69 of the last report) has abandoned all idea of remaining in the Hejaz. He saw no prospect of adequately remunerated official employment, and leaves the bacteriological field clear for a Turkish doctor, very deaf, who has been here for some time. 103. Occidental visitors were less numerous than in January and February. None call for special mention except the cable and wireless delegates already named. _ . 104. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during March was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male, 1 female. Took refuge in March : 1 male, 1 female. Manumitted and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : 1 female.

Fuad Bey 4th January, and is expected to pass Hiro g f ore ign representatives their came to Jedda on the 19th January, thus giving tne io g F b [331 bb—2]2 first opportunity for many weeks of discussing serious business. He returned to Mecca on the 22nd January, and was not again seen during the remainder of the month. 4. The rumours of dissension in the Royal Family (paragraph 298 of the report for December) died down in January. The last which reached the Legation on the 2nd January were, however, the best. The King’s brothers, it was said, had left Riyadh for a strong place not far off, and had declared that they would not accept the Amir Saud as heir. Ibn Saud, to minimise the matter, had put it all down to a rivalry between his son the Amir Feisal, and his nephew Khalid, the son of the Amir Muhammad, for the hand of another cousin, the daughter of Nura, favourite sister of the King. The Crown Prince had quarrelled with Khalid over the matter and had slapped his face. It was, perhaps, to give the lie to these reports that the Amir Muhammad, complete with Khalid and two other sons, came to Mecca to visit the sacred precincts. They stayed a few days and left again for Riyadh about the 12th January. Even now the gossips were not at a loss. The King’s brother, they said, had brought off in Mecca a little marriage with the daughter of an illustrious divine, one of the more fanatical descendants of Abdul Wahhab, the reformer; and this alliance would so increase his influence with the tribes of Nejd that he could raise them against the King any day. No apology need be made for reproducing these stories, so charged with passion and with love. 5. No more was heard of trouble on the Yemen frontier or at Teima, though in January renewed reports, perhaps belated echoes of the old, came from Damascus regarding alleged important Saudi concentrations at Hail and Jauf. Almost the only other news of any consequence was that of a terrific breeze between Ibn Jiluwi, Governor of Hasa and the King’s cousin, and Muhammad Tawil, the important Hejazi, who now directs the financial and economic affairs of that province. A breach between these two might have important repercussions. On the 24th January Sheikh Hamad Suleiman, Deputy Minister of Finance, who was supposed to be standing by to act as a delegate for the delimitation of the Saudi-Yemen frontier, went to Hasa instead. This lends some support to a report that the King had ordered an investigation on the spot. 6. Fuad Bey Hamza brought back from Riyadh three important announce ments, which were duly published in the latter part of January after the first two had been officially communicated to the foreign missions on the 18th January. They seemed to indicate a victory for«moderate counsels in the King’s entourage, but a victory the value of which is diminished by ambiguity, due perhaps to compromise or perhaps only to slovenly drafting. They were as follows :— (a) A communique prolonging by two months the time allowed for producing proof of foreign nationality (see paragraph 284 of the report for November 1934). (b) A communique purporting to interpret in a reassuring sense the Regu lations on Real Property promulgated last October (see paragraph 241 of the Report for October 1934). In terms it goes but a little way to remove the objection raised in foreign circles to the regulations. (c) A Royal proclamation sanctioning the return to Saudi Arabia of Saudi subjects previously excluded for political reasons. 7. The last of these announcements is described in the heading as an amnesty, but the text does not grant pardon for political offences. Its true effect can only be shown by the event. It may facilitate the return of certain members of the Shereefian family and possibly some tribal personages. One does not yet, however, quite see people like the Dabbaghs dashing back with joyous shouts of Dulce Domum. 8. Fawwaz, the grandson of Nuri-bin-Shalan, left Jedda by sea on the 2nd January after staying with the King at Riyadh. According to a subsequent report from Damascus, he went back well pleased with an arrangement he had made regarding the future of the Ruwalla tribe in the Jauf area. 9. The activity of the two Saudi aeroplanes noted in paragraph 301 of the report for December and earlier has continued intermittently on the same limited lines. 10. There were no new economic or financial developments during the month. Reports of doubtful authenticity were received of urgent demands for gold to bea sent from the Hejaz to Riyadh. The following paragraphs deal with projects and concessions mentioned in earlier reports :— 11. Abdur Rahman Qusaibi left for Europe on the 9th January, having apparently abandoned all hope of making anything out of his concession 101 pearl-fishing in the Red Sea (paragraph 302 of the report for December). 12. Mr. Twitched (paragraph 304 of the last report) is still away. Tie was last heard from at Rutba, in Iraq, and had shown interest in a gold m J ne 1 . n country, which has been talked about for years. He is now understood to inten to visit England before returning to Saudi Arabia. It was confirmed early m the month that he had enlisted the services of the Islamised Dutchman, van de Poll, for prospective prospecting. M. van de Poll left for Medina early in the month. i „ . . 13. The Iraqi Charge d’Affaires gave a good deal of information to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 30th January about the projected motor route from Nejif to Medina (paragraph 305 of the last report). He confirmed previous information to the effect that Iraqi cars will undertake the transport all the way to Medina and said that, while no special company had been formed in Iraq and no monopoly had been given, five existing concerns had registered themselves with a view to working the route. The Charge anticipated that it would be used by large numbers of Iraqi and Persian pilgrims, besides some 250 Indians. He put the possible total of users as high as 4,000 persons. He did not name a figure for the actual cost of transport, which a writer in the Tunes of the 15th January put as low as £5 for the run from Iraq to Medina. He said that it would be quite cheap but for the avarice of the Saudi Government, who wanted to make money out of benzine, road taxes at the rate of £3 gold per pilgrim and a registration tax of £10 gold per car. He spoke as though there were still some minor points outstanding with the Saudi Government, but not as though they would prevent the route from being used this year. 14. Sharqieh’s car business still seems to be going to the satisfaction of Mr. Philby (paragraph 306 of the last report). He mentioned in conversation on the 15th January that he had recently got a payment of £7,000 in this connexion from the Government. He remarked on the fact that it had taken the form of a draft on the Banque Misr. 15. Mr. L. N. Hamilton, the London representative of the Standard Oil Company of California, arrived in Jedda from Hasa via Riyadh on the 12th January, accompanied by Mr. Miller, the principal geologist of the company in Hasa, and a young American, who looks after the cars and who also flies. This young man returned overland with the cars on the 15th January, leaving Messrs. Hamilton and Miller to proceed by sea to the Sudan and Egypt on the 20th. They confirmed previous reports that drilling is to be started at Damman, on the west side of the Gulf of Bahrein, in the near future. They seemed hopeful. They professed to have no difficulties at present with the Saudi Government, but one casual remark suggested that At Tawil (see paragraph 5 above) was not always easy. i tt u j 16. Nothing more has been heard of the projects of Talaat Pasha Harb and the Banque Misr. Mr. Philby’s remark quotedi in paragraph 14 is,^however, interesting. One of the two small vessels mentioned in paragraph 276 of the report for November again called on the 29th January. 17 Two persons were put to death at Mecca on the 11th January. Phis appears to have been the result of a casual affray between smugglers and preventive men near Sharaya, in which two of the latter were killed. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 18. Nothing definite was heard in connexion with the delimitation of the frontier contemplated in article 4 of the Treaty of Paif (see paragraph 309 of the last report and cf. paragraph 5 above). Relations with the Yemen seemed to be perfect. The Umm-al-Qura of the 11th January denied that the Saudi Government were in any way interested in the case of a certain Muhammad Said-as-Saqqaf, about whom reports had appeared in the Egyptian press to the effect that he had been put on trial (according to one account as a British spy) or even executed at Sana, and that the Saudi Government had made representa tions, as he was a Saudi subject. This man may possibly be identical with the [331 bb—2] b 2' 4 As Saqqaf who has been variously mentioned as Japanese representative at Sana and more recently (paragraph 316 of the last report) as having een appom Japanese consul in Saudi Arabia. The identification is, however, mos uncer am. 19. The same Umm-al-Qura of the 11th January recorded a meeting ot Saudi and Iraqi representatives to discuss frontier questions at Kamadni. is announcement seems to relate to a meeting known from other sources to ha/ve followed soon after the Palmyra Conference (paragraph 249 of the report lor 20. ^ The position regarding the Nejif-Medina motor route is described in paragraph 13 above. In the conversation there mentioned, the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires stated that the present relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq were in the main good, and much better than they were some little time ago. 21 The Umm-al-Qura of the 11th January announced a projected meeting at Dhat-al-Hai in Saudi Arabia between the Officer Commanding, Desert Patrol in Transjordan, and the Amir of lebuk. A similar meeting took place in Transjordan territory in June 1934, but the Legation in Jedda has not heard of the further meeting from any other source. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 22. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom definitely approved in Januarv of the proposal, which had emerged from the conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza in London last September, that an attempt should be made to arrive at a comprehensive settlement of all major questions outstanding between them and the Saudi Government on the basis that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to consider making some concession in regard to Ibn Saud s eastern and south-eastern frontiers, without too much regard to strict legal considerations, if other questions could be settled satisfactorily. Important instructions were issued to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 17th January, and he had long conversations with Fuad Bey on the 20th and 21st January. He enquired definitely whether the Saudi Government were on their side prepared for the attempt at a comprehensive settlement, and whether they would produce a more positive statement of the King’s desiderata regarding his eastern and south eastern frontiers than they have hitherto done. Fuad Bey approached the latter subject, rather startlingly, in the private part of the conversation, from the point of view that His Majesty’s Government had promised to recognise the independence of Arabs, and that this should be applied in the case of Ibn Saud’s neighbours in the Persian Gulf. He reserved his official reply to both Sir Andrew Ryan’s questions. He intimated officially that the King was now more favourably disposed towards the British proposal that the Bahrein transit question should be examined in the first instance by a local conference, but would like to have a list of suggested agenda. He invited His Majesty’s Government to formulate proposals for a settlement between Ibn Saud and Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are still considering these and various other matters which would or might come into the proposed negotiations (see paragraph 311 of the last report and previous reports passim). 23. The supplies for the Government dispensaries (paragraph 312 of the report for December) were cleared from customs without difficulty in January, and the Mecca branch was opened without incident on the 12th January, though on receiving an unofficial intimation that this would be done, the Saudi Govern ment showed extreme anxiety to safeguard their position in the proposed discussions with Fuad Bey on the whole subject. These have not yet begun. 24. Several missions in Jedda are greatly concerned over the questions of real property and nationality (see paragraph 6 (a) and (b) above), especially those principally interested in persons now their nationals who were formerly Ottoman subjects and had therefore a clear legal right to acquire real property in the Hejaz, when persons, who were already aliens, could do so only by a tolerance in favour of such as were Moslems. The French Charge, acting on behalf of Syrians, and the Turkish and Iraqi representatives are all in the same boat. 25. No official announcement has yet been made regarding the conversion of the French consulate into a Legation or the promotion of the present Charge d’Affaires (paragraph 313 of the last report). M. Maigret left for Hodeida,5 en route for Sana, on the 21st January. His journey appears to have no political significance. 26. The Italian Charg6 d’Affaires continues to cultivate his garden. The creation of this pleasaunce on a strip of ground outside his Legation, with another strip across the road to serve as nursery, has been about the greatest diplomatic achievement of any during the past year in Jedda. 27. The Netherlands Charge, accompanied by the late manager in Jedda of the Netherlands Trading Company and the same engineer from Holland who was of the party a year ago, left for Sana via Hodeida on the 21st January. This visit has now become an annual event. The Dutch may hope to nurse i market in the Yemen, but there is nothing to suggest any definite political object. 28. Arising out of an incident at the important Sultiyya School at Mecca, founded by Indians and frequented by Moslems of many nations, a new school for Dutch East Indians and Malays was started there in January. Two teachers and over a hundred students of those nationalities had walked out of the Sultiyya School in November owing to the alleged offensiveness of the Indian director. The new school has probably as little connexion with the Netherlands authorities as the Sultiyya with any British authority. 29. There is nothing worth recording about other Powers and their representatives, except that a member of the Soviet Agency at Hodeida was in Jedda for a few days early in the month, and that the staff of the Russian Legation has been temporarily strengthened by the presence of another commercial representative named Guertik. He appears, however, to be merely on a mission of inspection in the Red Sea. The regular staff of the Legation consists of the Minister, a vice-consul, a doctor and a dentist. They are all married, and all their wives live with them. They all live together, and they mostly walk out together in the evenings. The ladies take the housekeeping in turns. Whate^ er may be said of Bolshevists elsewhere, they are an example to all of us m Jedda, though the Moslems are perhaps a bit weak in their Islam. IV .—M iscellaneous. 30. An unusual number of occidental visitors appeared in Jedda in lanuary. The most important have been mentioned in various connexions above. Fhe others included yet another Dutch savant from the Dutch Last Indies, Dr. A. H. Cense and two officers on leave from the Iransjordan Frontier roice, vho came ashore for a few hours. . _ , . . . . 31. Mr. Philby spent a good part of the month m Jedda, partly owing to lis wife’s illness, but left on the 28th January for Medina and Riyadh, intending ■o return shortly before the pilgrimage. He intends to go to England soon after •he pilgrimage and to stay until next winter. W hat then, of the business of iharqieh (Limited) ? Still inspired by genius, it will have to be actually run by i newly-imported British accountant and an engineer lent by the Ford Company 32. The coolth recorded in paragraph 321 of the last report did not last. Fhe New Year came perspiring, and most of the month was hot and sticky. Fhere were, however, one or two better spells, and a twenty-four hours cold wave Drovided the most exhilarating topic of conversation at the Accession Day dinner. Seventy souls shivered in unison in the garden of the Khuzam Palace. T e imner 3,18^6 ^ f ore jg n community (paragraph 322 of the last report) ms improved but illness delayed the progress of the Jedda Golf Tournament, XiclXgan on the 16th January. American and Dutch competitors have been di^rwithout international ill feeling. The British Legation, who have still to compete, will play in the final against a nember of the staff of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. , p T 34 The number of pilgrims already in the country at the end of January s estimated at 3 211 Dutch East Indians. 2.178 Indians, and perhaps 971 &lt;=&gt;t other Nationalities* 1 It may he noted that a Dutch ship whtch amved on the 30th Tanuarv brought onlv Chinese, to the number of some 137. ifie •enatriating the large numbers of British West Africans, who had accumulated N the Heifz from previous years and could no longer support themselves, was Nracticallv completed by a shipment of fifty-two of them to Massawa on the 27th January. The total number of those repatriated has been 1,466.Cl t) % 35. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during January was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month, one female. Took refuge in J anuary, three males and one female. Manumitted in January and repatriated, nil. Locally manumitted, one female. On hand at the end of the month, three males and one female. The unusual case mentioned in paragraph 326 of the last report still presents difficulty, but hopes are still entertained that it will be disposed of on the lines there foreshadowed. 36.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for February 1935. I .—Internal Affairs. 36. Ibn Saud remained in camp at Rawdat-al-Khafs, except for at least one outing in the neighbourhood, throughout the month. It is stated that, apart from constant visitors, no less than 3,000 people have been settled in an encampment of some 500 tents. Rosalinds and Celias are not lacking in this Arabian Forest of Arden, for the Saudi Minister in London told Sir Andrew Ryan roguishly on the 17th February that there were two camps, one for the ladies. 37. Nothing of interest was heard during the month about the other members of the Royal family and their alleged dissensions, but it seems certain that there was at least a breeze between the King and his brother Muhammad. The Amir Feisal kept his state at Mecca, as Viceroy. His Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs came twice to Jedda. He had important conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan on the 6th and 7th February. On the second occasion, Fuad Bey’s objects included the meeting of his wife, who arrived from Syria on the l9th, and the seeing off of the Saudi Minister in London. The latter had arrived in Jedda from Rawdat-al-Khafs via Mecca on the 17th, and left for London via Egypt on the 19th. Fuad Bey found time for a further interview with Sir Andrew Ryan on the 20th. 38. No events of importance were reported from the country near the Yemen border, Hasa or any part of the interior. As regards the Governor of Hasa and Muhammad-at-Tawil (paragraph 5 of the report for January), it now seems doubtful whether they have quarrelled, but certain that Tawil has been at logger- heads with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, and that his position is shaken. 39. The Umm-al-Qura of the 1st February gave prominence to loyal addresses to the King by Hejazi notables and pilgrim guides, a promos of the measure of clemency mentioned in paragraph 6 (c) of the last report and to the King’s gracious and self-justifying reply. As was anticipated there has been no spectacular homeward rush of exiles, but the press has announced the return of i j two persons. One is a certain Lieutenant-Colonel Muhammad Sadiq. of whose II presence in India the Saudi Government complained in 1933, and in whose move ments His Majesty’s Government have since interested themselves. The other is one Sheikh Omar Saleh Seyrafi, of whom the Legation knows nothing, but who is said to have been expelled from Mecca some eight years ago and to have now returned from Lahej. 40. Liberalism has had another triumph. A circular from the Saudi Government to the foreign missions, dated the 12th February, confirmed previous information to the effect that the existing ban on wireless apparatus had been removed. The regulation reserves the general rights of the Saudi Government in [356 s—3] BJ mam - 2 their territory, territorial waters and air. It provides in principle for the authorisation by special Royal decree of transmission stations in certain cases. Receiving sets may be imported and installed in certain areas which are not specified, but whicn are understood not to include Mecca, under annual licence. The duties are, however, very high; an import duty of 60 per cent, ad valorem on transmission sets; £5 gold import duty on receiving sets up to a value of £10; £10 gold on sets valued at £10 to £20; £15 gold on sets valued at more than £20; 60 per cent, ad valorem on all spares, &amp;c.; and £2 gold annually for the licence to use a receiving set. 41. This is a step in the right direction, but a small one. Gramophones, alcohol, parsons, &amp;c., continue to be prohibited, though gramophones and alcohol abound. There is talk of a relaxation of the restrictions on the latter in favour of European business houses. Football is another of the acid tests of tolerance and intolerance in the Hejaz. The press announced that the overland pilgrims from Iraq (see paragraph 53) would include certain young men keen on athletics, and that a football match might be arranged for them in Mecca. 42. The aircraft mentioned in paragraph 9 of the last report ceased early in the month to haunt the Jedda air. They are understood to have been moved to Taif. The most interesting development in aviation was the departure on the 9th February of fourteen students to be trained in Italy. It had been arranged for the sake of economy that they should undergo their medical examination at Massawa. Only four passed; the others returned to Jedda on the 22nd February. The Italian Charge states that the initiative lay with the Saudi Government, who had been offered two of the bourses reserved in Italy for oriental students, had declined them, and had then said they would like to have potential aviators trained instead. 43. Great enthusiasm for the air marked the send off of the fourteen lads, wFo were loudly clapped and whose path was strewn with flowers. The episode gave a renewed impetus to the work of the Arab Aeronautical Society, which had attracted no general attention since the publication of the report mentioned in paragraph 73 of the report for January to March 1932. The promoters have now again met, made speeches and launched appeals. 44. The concession granted to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (para graph 12 of the last report) was published on the 15th February. The general lines are those foreshadowed in paragraph 304 of the report for December. The syndicate is allowed three months to get to work, a year for general prospecting and another year for further research in selected areas, after which mining leases for fifty-eight years will be granted to it or its subsidiaries for areas chosen for definite operations. Mr. Twitched returned on the 17th February, having collected two more mining engineers, British and American, followed by an Australian on the 27th February and a British clerical assistant. Four areas are to be prospected in the first instance. Mr. Twitched is full of hope and hustle. The syndicate’s cars are the wonder of the town. They are painted a bright pillar box red and inscribed conspicuously S.A.M.S. As the enterprise is now so largely British, it is to be hoped that the bad little Badu boys will not be misled by Mr. Twitched’s American aspect into scrawling “ Uncle ” behind those letters. 45. The total of lorries imported under the arrangement with Sharqieh (Limited) (paragraph 14 of the last report) was at the end of February close on 1100. It is doubtful, however, whether that company will make much money out of it. They were said (by a rival) in February to be owed £20,000. There has been trouble in customs owing to the wish of the local authorities to asure themselves that the cases contained lorries only and not wireless sets. Certain cases were opened by the customs officers and were found in due course to have been robbed of portable parts like headlamps, &amp;c. 46. Talaat Pasha Harb and the Bank Misr (paragraph 16 of the last report) are again going strong. Their first pilgrim ship arrived on the 18th February, with some 1,149 pilgrims and a first consignment of the wheat mentioned below. The pilgrims were landed in a special barge drawn by a tug, both of which had been brought from Egypt. The group have presented' a sum of over £2,000 gold for the benefit of certain named Saudi hospitals. The Pasha has ventilated publicly a scheme for an air service between Jedda and Medina, which would enable the devout to get to Medina and back for their visit to the Prophet’s Tomb in one day or two. The attitude of the Saudi Government is not known, but the «ra of the potted pilgrimage may be in sight.fe:3!r~-j2 1 3 47. A smaller and more local enterprise commended itself to the notice of pilgrims on the 4th February in an announcement of edifying modesty. Its authors admitted that the quality of the cloth was poor and its price high. They urged, however, that the price was not enough to cover expenses, and suggested that the cloth might be bought for presents from the Holy Land, shrouds, pilgrim /^\ garb and servants’ clothes. 48. An electric lighting plant for the sacred precincts at Mecca, presented by Sir Muhammad Muzammil-Ullah Khan, K.C.I.E., O.B.E., of Bhikampur, Alighah, arrived from India on the 12th February. 49. Ihe Saudi authorities, anxious to remedy certain nuisances in and about the sacred precincts at Mecca, have provided a refuge capable of accom modating some 1,500 poor people, without beds, but with free food. 50. There is no truth in a report published in the Moscow Daily News of the 28th November, and perhaps in other papers, that Russian engineers have installed an automatic telephone service in Jedda. The Soviet Government did piesent twenty-five instruments and a central instrument to Ibn Baud last summer and sent experts. No other apparatus is known to have been imported since. The presentation outfit is installed in the Royal palace at Taif. II -—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 51. luad Bey Hamza assured Sir Andrew Ryan on the 20th February that there was no trouble of any sort on the \ emen frontier. He said that a delimita- tion of the frontier (paragraph 18 of the last report) was in view, but that it was not for that that the Deputy Minister of 1 inance and Khalid-al-Qarqani had been standing by. It had been intended to send them on a mission of adminis- trative organisation only. Fuad Bey mentioned the presence at Riyadh of a 1 emeni emissary, who had taken over forty davs to get there overland with a letter, apparently, from the King of the Yemen/ 52. Incidentally, Fuad Bey said that the alleged spy and the alleged Japanese representative mentioned in paragraph 18 of the last report were distinct persons and the resemblance in their names merely superficial. The first, he said, was a man named Skaf (or “ Cobbler ”), who was born in Svria, had spent some time in the Hejaz and had got into trouble in the Yemen last year over some business involving the use of forged seals, for which he had been sentenced to two years imprisonment. This may afiord a sidelight on the most highly coloured story yet circulated in this connexion, namely, that the failure of the Yemeni troops to counter-attack last year, when they seemed fully prepared to do so, was due to orders issued by this Skaf, at Saudi instigation, over a perfect leplica of the seal of the King of the \emen. As for the other man, Fuad Bey said that he belonged to the well-known Saqqaf family, who have large interests m the Dutch East Indies and elsewhere. t aP - The Saudi . ^I inist er of Finance and the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires in Jedda signed a provisional agreement on the 12th February regarding the motor route for pilgrims from Nejef to Medina (paragraphs 13 and 20 of the last report), the press had already announced the arrival of the first pilgrims by this route, but the report may have been premature. In a conversation early in February the Iraqi Charge was even more eloquent than he had previously been (paragraph 20 of the last report) about the improvement in Saudi-Iraqi relations, which he dated from about two months earlier. The Saut-al-Hejaz newspaper of the 11th February referred in particular to the friendly intercourse of tribes on the frontier. Finally, on the 20th February, Fuad Bey Hamza spoke to Sir Andrew Ryan of the expected visit of an Iraqi delegation,^ which might be headed by Nun Pasha-as-Said, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. This will probably be delayed by the fall of the Iraqi Cabinet in the last days of February. JNeyertheless the indications of a political rapprochement between Saudi Arabia volume aq&gt; ° f WhlCh FUad BGy SP ° ke in London in September, are gathering 54. The sudden death at Bagdad on the 13th February of King Ali seemed to create no emotion among his and his father’s former subiects The Iraoi Charge when announcing it naturally gave the deceased his titles but verv correctly mentioned his relationship to King Ghazi, thus making it a matter of Iraqi Royal mourning. This minimised any delicacy there might have been about mourning in Jedda. The British Legation and most of the other foreign missions [ 356 s—3] gduly half-masted their flags. Ibn Saud sent telegrams of condolence to King Ghazi and the Amir of Transjordan. 55. Certain matters affecting Transjordan, Koweit and Bahrein are reserved for the following section as they closely concern Anglo-Saudi relations. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 56. Following on earlier consultations of an informal kind, the Saudi Government were informed by Sir Andrew Ryan on the 6th February that His Majesty’s Government would welcome a suggested unofficial visit by the Saudi Heir Apparent to England next summer, if this comes off, the Prince will also visit France and probably Italy. 57. Fuad Bey intimated to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 7th February the King’s distaste for general negotiations on the lines indicated in paragraph 22 of the last report, adding, however, a strong affirmation of his wish to get as many questions as possible settled on their several merits. His Majesty’s Government have acquiesced. Some progress has already been made with two questions, Bahrein transit dues and the Koweit blockade. The King has agreed that in each case the position should be examined by a local conference of delegates in the hope of their being able to submit agreed recommendations. His Majesty’s Government have informed the Legation of their readiness still to offer certain concessions to 1 bn Saud in regard to his eastern and south-eastern frontiers, but they wish the advance to be made more slowly than if the possibility of a comprehensive settle ment of major questions were in view and they would like to get the Koweit question settled first. They are still studying the subject of attempting to secure a satisfactory clarification of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier, a matter to which the Saudi Government reverted independently in February to the extent of reasserting after a long silence their claim to Thaniyya Taraif (paragraph 250 of the report for October). 58. Various other questions have been discussed with Fuad Bey, including the possibility of an agreement between the Saudi Government and Cable and Wireless (Limited), at a conference at Jedda, which has been agreed to in principle; the question of real property legislation; and the question of the Saudi nationality regulations. A note on the present position in regard to the last named is attached for the benefit of British authorities, whom it has not been possible to keep informed of all the stages. 59. Mention should have been made in the last report of an identic note to the British and French missions in Jedda, in which, on the 18th January, the Saudi Government proposed a technical conference to arrange for the recon ditioning of the Hejaz Railway, without prejudice to their views as to its owner ship and alleged Wakf character. They had assured themselves beforehand of a generally sympathetic attitude on the part of the British and French Govern ments, but details still require consideration. 60. The French Charge d’Affaires returned to Jedda from Sana on the 10th February, but left within a few days for a short holiday in Syria (para graph 25 of the last report). 61. The Italian Charge has again shown no special activity, but see paragraph 42 above regarding the despatch of would-be Saudi airmen to Massawa. 62. The Netherlands Charge has not yet returned from Sana (paragraph 27 of the last report). News was received from London in February that he had been appointed Dutch representative at Bagdad as well. 63. M. Guertik (paragraph 29 of the last report), whose card reads “ Agent general pour le Commerce de 1’U.R.S.S.,” left for Istanbul, his headquarters, on the 10th February. It now appears that he had already been in Hudeida before he arrived in Jedda on the 7th January, and that he paid a previous visit to Jedda in 1931. 64. The dream of Lieutenant-Colonel Sherif Ibrahim Depui has come true (paragraph 314 of the report for December). He was appointed Belgian consul by a Royal decree of the 30th January. He disclaims all interest in politics, and states that he is severely restricted as regards personal commerce. Studv he savs is the lure. 65. The Egyptian Government have given 20,000 ardebs (about 3,800 bushels) of wheat for the poor of Medina, and a collection of money for their relief has been started in Egypt. These developments may be connected with the efforts5 &gt;■ of Talaat Pasha and the Banque Misr to stimulate Egyptian interest in the Hejaz, other indications of which are mentioned in paragraph 46. 66. The agrement of the Afghan Minister in Cairo for the additional post of Minister in Saudi Arabia was announced in Mecca and Bagdad in February. He comes on pilgrimage in any case every year. The usual small-scale Afghan Medical Mission arrived during the month. IV.— Miscellaneous. 67. H.M.S. Hastings, Captain the Hon. C. P. Hermon-Hodge, D.S.C., visited Jedda from the 9th to 13th February. 68. Mr. A. S. Calvert, who was promoted to the rank of His Majesty’s consul on the 1st January, went on leave on the 10th February. 69. Ur. van der Hoog, the Dutch bacteriologist mentioned in paragraph 320 of the report for December, arrived in Jedda on the 3rd February. It now appears that he became a Moslem before he last left, but had not qualified for access to Mecca by length of service in the faith. This is now all right, and he left for Mecca soon after his arrival. He appears to be well versed in his science, but to be somewhat of a cheery eccentric. He claims, inter alia, to possess the secret of a really remarkable hair tonic. Another European doctor named Brunelli arrived in Jedda on the 27th February, to act as medical officer of the Italian Legation and at the same time engage in private practice. 70. Other occidental visitors have included the Hon. C. C. Farrer, of the Department of Overseas Trade, and Mr. G. H. Selous, senior commercial secretary at Cairo, who rounded off an official tour in the Sudan with a short stay in the Legation; a Mrs. Edwards from the United States of America; a swiftly- passing Dutchman named Axler; and a young German journalist from London named Marcus, who came on from Massawa because he had been refused permission to land there; the representative of a French North African bank, who will stay over the pilgrimage for the benefit of pilgrims; and lastly, Mr. Dickerson, commercial secretary of the United States Legation at Cairo, who arrived on the 27th February. Even this list is probably incomplete. 71. All thoughts are turning towards the pilgrimage, as Arafat day will fall on the 14th or 15th March. The prospects are distinctly better than last year. It was announced on the 22nd February that the total of overseas pilgrims up to date was 16,425. An analysis of the complete figures is reserved for next month. 72. His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur arrived on pilgrimage, with considerable state, on the 3rd February and stayed two nights in the Legation before proceeding to Medina. The Saudi Government have done him great honour, and even greater honour to the senior Begum of His Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad, who arrived less ostentatiously on the 27th February. Nawab Wali-ad-Dawlah, a Minister and near relative of the Nizam, who had arrived on the 1st February, died of pneumonia at Medina on the 22nd. Other notable pilgrims this year up to date include a brother of the Sheikh of Debai and the chief of the Hadehdowa tribe in the Sudan. The Glaoui, the greatest of the Moroccan Grand Kaids, is expected. 73. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during February was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 3 males and 1 female. Took refuge in February : 1 male, 1 female. Manumitted and repatriated : 3 males. Locally manumitted : 1 female. Left voluntarily : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : 1 male, 1 female. The case of the enceinte slave woman referred to in paragraph 35 of the last report was at last disposed of by an arrangement that she should be locally manumitted, housed with a relative of the former owner pending confinement, and visited regularly by the Indian medical officer with her host’s consent.** — Appendix. Note on the Present Position in regard to Persons claiming British Nationality or Protected Status in Saudi Arabia. 1. This note is intended to be read in conjunction with the consolidated ) text of the Saudi regulations on nationality appended to the Jedda report tor January and February 1931, and Sir Andrew Ryan s despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 193 of the 19th June, 1934, copies of which were distributed to the British authorities most likely to be concerned. , T . • 2. The Saudi Ministry’ for Foreign Affairs forwarded to the Legation on the 7th July, 1934, an advance copy of a communique, which was in due course published on the 13th July. This communique fixed a period ending the 5th February, 1935, within which persons claiming foreign nationality weie to present proof of it. The language of the communique suggested that it was meant to apply only to persons long settled in the country. The consequences of fai ure to produce proof of foreign nationality were not specified in the communique itself, but the evident intention was to regard defaulters as being Saudi subjects in virtue of article 10 of the amended regulations on nationality. The b rench consulate understood orally from the Saudi authorities that failure to furnish such proof within the time allowed would entail loss of the for eign nationality in the case of persons (a) born in the Hejaz of foreign parents, (b) born abroad, but resident for a number (unspecified) of years. , , ,, . 3. The Secretary of State issued instructions on the 10th October to the ettect that no objection should be raised to the terms of the Saudi communique. He anticipated, however, that the time allowed might prove inadequate for the verification of applications, in which case the Legation was to uige that a further period should be allowed. The Saudi Government were also to be informed privately that British subjects and protected persons resident in Saudi Arabia would not, even in the absence of papers, lose such status merely by reason of their acquiring Saudi nationality under article 10 of the Saudi regulations but that His Majesty’s Government would not claim to afford such persons, protection while they remained in Saudi territory. Mr. Calvert acted on these instructions in a personal letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 15th October and asked him to consider favourably “a further extension to be announced oi general information on more than one occasion so that all may be aware of the matter and have adequate time to produce their proofs of nationality. 4 No reply was returned to Mr. Calvert’s letter, but on the 18th January the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs forwarded to the foreign missions a further communique of the same date extending the period for the production of proof of foreign nationality to the end of the Moslem year, until the 5th April 1935. This was published in both the Mecca papers. 5 It is probable that knowledge of the situation created by the communiques is fairly widespread, and that the paucity of applications for passports by British subjects and protected persons who may be affected, is due less to ignorance than to a very natural fear of the eventual consequences of asserting claims to foreign nationality. There may be cases of complete ignorance and there are probably more in which British subjects and protected persons have only vague ideas as to the consequences of not taking out proper papeis. Nevertheless, it is difficult to contest the right of the Saudi Government to object to foreigners residing in their territory indefinitely without regularising their positiom Sir Andrew Ryan therefore informed Fuad Bey Hamza on the 20th February that he would have preferred the prolongation of the period o, grace to be greater, but that he would be personally satisfied with the position created by the latest communique? if - (a) The period were further prolonged in the case of persons producing evidence that they had applied for documents establishing then- foreign character, but that the formalities had not been completed; cind ^ (b\ The Saudi Government would undertake to consider on their merits cases arising in the future in which the interested persons claimed to have been ignorant of the requirements of the Saudi Government.7 , ■ re ply °f Fuad Bey and the views of His Majesty’s Government on e suggestions made by feir Andrew Ryan, as from himself, are awaited. 7. Attention must be drawn to a particular question which arises in the case or persons born in the Hejaz of foreign parents, when the Ottoman Law on Rationality was in force. As that law treated such persons as having been born toreigners, His Majesty s Government do not admit that they can now be claimed as Saudi subjects merely by reason of birth in the Hejaz or Nejd. The Secretary ot State has, however, approved of the suggestion in paragraph 12 (d) of Sir Andrew Ryan s despatch No. 193 of the 19th June, 1934, i.e., that Saudi nationality should not be contested in the case of persons of Arabian origin, not being British subjects, who were born in the Hejaz before the promulgation of the Hejazi regulations on nationality, which was issued in 1926 and amended inJ^OJEXEq, I In any further communication on this subject, please quote ^ No. ^ ^jy,/C£ry /*Z'&gt;' k and address —not to any person 1A) narM,Y&gt;\it to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W t / 6 8 INDIA DIRECT^ § p I (93^0Ntj|IDENTIAL THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to an&lt; ^’ direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop^x of the under-mentioned paper.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for December 1934. I .—Internal Affairs. 295. Ibn Saud remained at Riyadh throughout the month. The Amir Feisal who was also there at its outset, stayed on until the 25th December, when he left for the Hejaz, getting back to Mecca on the 29th December. luad Bey Hamza, who, as stated in paragraph 267 of the last report, returned from leave on the 2nd December, visited Jedda on the 7th December, and had a conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, but three or four days later he proceeded from Mecca to Riyadh, where he remained in attendance on the King up to the end of the month. . . . , T . 296. The absence of these high personages at Riyadh reduced the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to a shadow and deprived the foreign representatives in Jedda of any opportunity of dealing with affairs requiring personal intercourse. The stillness of the diplomatic air was intensified by the fact that the fasting month of Ramadan, always a period of slackness, began on the 6th December. 297. The assemblage at Riyadh was to be reinforced about the end of the month by the arrival of the Saudi Minister in London, who left England on the 3rd December and arrived in Egypt on the 13th December. He left Cairo, apparently by air, on the 18th December, and when last heard of had got to Bagdad. , , . ^ . 298. There was no news of any further development m the leima area (paragraph 271 of the last report), or of any important happening towards the Yemen border. It was freely rumoured in Jedda, however, that a grave situation had arisen in the Royal circle at Riyadh, with a reflex in the form of tribal unrest in the central area. 299. These reports were almost certainly much exaggerated and are not worth reproducing in detail. Their central features were that the xAmir Feisal was supposed to be an unwilling guest, detained in Nejd for political reasons, and that an acute quarrel had occurred between the King and his brother Muhammad who was said at one moment to have been put to death. There were many variants on the current stories, and other princes were named as rebels or potential rebels. So far as the Amir Feisal is concerned, he left Riyadh, as already stated, on the 25th December, but the rumourists, not to be defeated, then put it about that he had tarried at Shaqra, presumably to deal with the tribal unrest. 300. Mr. Philby’s reaction to the rumours was that no importance need be attached to tales of dissension in the Royal Family, but that all the bigwigs at Riyadh were “ in a great muddle,” a state of affairs which he attributes to [306 bb—1] Bthe King's failure to keep his old firm grip on the affairs of his country, and to some extent to His Majesty's increasing obsession with sport. This, from so great an admirer, is significant, and it may well be that jealousy, e.g., between the heir apparent and his brother Feisal, and criticism of Ibn Saud, even in his own circle, are affecting the machine of Government at the centre. Mr. Philby, it may be noted, tends to be increasingly critical of Saudi ways and persons in private conversation, though he gave a fairly glowing account of Saudi affairs in the Egyptian Gazette of the 11th December, and a very similar article in the Near East of the 20th December. Incidentally he puts the King’s cash payments to tribesmen in the autumn (paragraph 266 of last report) at about £2,000 gold per day for some two months. 301. The Saudi Air Force (paragraph 272 of the last report) has continued to show some activity, mainly, however, in the form of flights in the immediate neighbourhood of Jedda, where two Wapitis, marked S.4 and S.8 have been kept parked by the roadside outside the town on the inner edge of the piece of flat coast used as an aerodrome. They were moved into hangars on the 27th December. It is still uncertain whether a third machine is in working order and, if so, where it is. It is possible that the machine which crashed at Taif on the 5th July (paragraph 152 of report for July) has never been reconditioned as was supposed, but is still there. 302. The pearl-fishers, referred to in the report for October, paragraph 240 (/) and earlier, who have been operating under the Qusaibi concession in southern waters of the Red Sea, returned to Jedda early in December. They were favourably impressed with the potentialities of the Southern Saudi shores, but at present shells were too small and the waters over-fished. Sheikh Abdurrahman Qusaibi informed His Majesty’s Minister that he had so far lost money over this enterprise. It is stated that he proposes to urge Ibn Saud to impose a close season for pearl fishing. Meanwhile, the Venezuelan divers were making preparations for departure at the end of the month. 303. The Minister of Finance was active in spite of Ramadan. He is said by some to have gone Sufi, and his devotional fervour in Mecca has attracted attention. This piety has not, however, prevented him from constantly dashing down to Jedda or caused him to relax his hold on the purse-strings. It was reported about the 21st that all payments to officials had been suspended, though they were promised something at the after-Ramadan festival in January, and that drafts on the customs were no longer to be accepted in part payment of duty on newly imported goods. Orders in the latter sense would appear to have been issued, but they may be of merely temporary operation. 304. The negotiations for an agreement between the Saudi Government and the mainly British group, represented by Mr. Twitchell (paragraph 277 of the last report), viz., the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), were completed on the 23rd December. Full information is not yet available, and the agreement has still to be ratified. It is understood that the syndicate are to have exclusive rights, over an area comprising the Hejaz and a good part of Asir, of prospecting for minerals other than oil and other liquids, gold being the principal bait. The Government are to get 15 per cent, of the shares in any company formed to exploit particular concessions, 5 per cent, of any gold, &amp;c., extracted, and customs duty at a flat rate of 10 per cent, on all material, &amp;c., imported. Mr. Twitchell left for Egypt and Syria on the 26th December, and is believed to be already making active preparations for his prospecting campaign. 305. The Minister of Finance was also busy with the scheme for an overland pilgrim route between Najaf and Medina (paragraph 278 of the last report). Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman is not thought himself to favour this enterprise, but the Iraqi survey party visited Mecca and Jedda during December, and, when they left overland for Iraq about the 27th December, it was understood that the matters had been advanced sufficiently to enable the route to be used for the forthcoming pilgrimage. It is said, however, that the charges will be very high. 306. Mr. Philby’s firm, Sharqieh (Limited), have imported something like ninety Ford vehicles under the agreement referred to in paragraph 279 of the last report and earlier. The arrangements for paying for cars supplied to transport companies seem to be satisfactory. Mr. Philby has had to go easier with the Government themselves, but he claimed early in the month to have extracted from £2,000 to £3,000 from them. The Government have taken8 advantage of a saving clause in the agreement with Sharqieh to buy some twenty-five cars of other makes through Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., whose business is, however, adversely affected by the agreement. 307. The zeal of the Jedda Committee of Virtue in driving citizens from caf6 to mosque at the outset of Ramadan produced a fracas, in the course of which two minions of the committee were beaten. This fracas led to the arrest of numerous citizens, as many as eighty, it is said. Most of them were released within a few days, having been beaten, but a small number were kept in gaol. 308. The Umm-al-Qura took the trouble on the 21st December to deny a report that a niece of Ibn Saud had arrived in Cairo and entered a school for the daughters of shereefs. II. —Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 309. Reference has already been made in paragraph 305 to the proceedings of the Iraq survey party, which visited Mecca and Jedda in connexion with the proposed Najaf-Medina pilgrim route. There is little else to record in this chapter, except that the Saudi-Yemen situation appears to be satisfactory, if stationary, as regards the frontier delimitation contemplated in article 4 of the Treaty of Taif. It is stated that the Deputy Minister of Finance, Hamad-as- Suleiman, and Sheikh Khalid-al-Qarqani have been selected to serve as the Saudi Commissioners for this purpose, but they had not left up to the end of December. III.— Relations with Powers outside A rabia. 310. By a note dated the 28th November, Ibn Saud offered to His Majesty the King his congratulations and good wishes on the occasion of the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Kent. On the 2nd December His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, by command of the King, transmitted to Ibn Saud His Majesty’s 311. When Fuad Bey Hamza called on His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 7th December, as stated in paragraph 295 above, he expressed the personal view that it would be an excellent plan, if the proposed negotiations on questions outstanding between his Government and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could be conducted in Riyadh. It would probably be impracticable from a British point of view to conduct systematic negotiations there, but it is possible that Sir Andrew Ryan may receive, early in the New Year, an invitation to Riyadh, which was somewhat definitely foreshadowed at the time of his visit to Taif last July. Meanwhile, Sir Andrew Ryan has had no personal intercourse with the Saudi Government since his return, excepting an exchange of personal telegrams with Fuad Bey Hamza, who intimated on the 21st December that he expected to be detained at Riyadh until the end of Ramadan, but hoped to see the Minister immediately after the ensuing festival, which should end on the 5th January. 312. The Saudi Government agreed, in a note dated the 25th December, to \ exempt from customs duty the medical supplies for the Government of India dispensary (paragraph 283 of the last report) to be imported for the forthcoming pilgrimage season, but they made it clear that they were making the concession for this occasion only, without prejudice to their views on the various issues, in regard to the medical organisation attached to the Legation, which are to be discussed in due course, when Fuad Bey is available. 313. The French consulate in Jedda is to be raised to the status of a j Legation on the 1st January, and the present Charge d’Affaires is to have the 1 rank of Minister Resident. M. Maigret professes to have no ambition other than that of ending his career in Jedda and makes no secret of the fact that he owes his retention here, with a higher rank, to the good word which Fuad Bey said for him in Paris in the autumn. He is about to proceed to Hodeida en route for Sana and proposes after a brief visit to the King of the Yemen, apparently of a complimentary nature, to go to Syria for a short time. 314. Major or Colonel Ibrahim Depui (paragraph 114 of the report for June) the French ex-officer who apes the Lawrences and Philbys of Arabia, again arrived in Jedda about the middle of the month. He distinguished himself on [306 bb—1] b 2this occasion by putting it about that he had come as Belgian consul, apparently on the ground that he once held that position and had never lost it. The French Charge d'Affaires not unnaturally declined the request by Depui for delivery of the Belgian archives in the French consulate, which has long looked after Belgian interests. There is no present reason to suppose that the Belgian Government are behind this move, but Depui himself may desire an official status for the furtherance of commercial schemes. 315. The Persian Minister returned to Jedda on the 10th December, smiling as hard as ever. 316. There is no confirmation of a rumour circulated some time agp in Egypt that the Japanese Government intended to appoint a certain As Saqqaf as consul in Saudi Arabia. It has been denied in Tokyo. IV.— Miscellaneous. 317. His Majesty’s Minister and Lady Ryan returned to Jedda on the 13th December. This restored the Diplomatic Body proper to its full strength of eight heads of mission, but the new Egyptian consul is still awaited, the German consulate is still vacant and the Afghan representation more than nebulous. 318. The French sloop Vimy arrived in Jedda on the 13th December and left on the 15th. It is worth mentioning, because it is so unusual, that her commander and two officers lunched at the British Legation on the 14th December, following on meetings when Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan were in Port Sudan. The Vimy brought as a passenger Mrs. Bennett, wife of the Director of Customs in the Sudan, who stayed at the British Legation for three days. 319. A Dutch official from Java, M. Pfeffer, stated to be an Arabic scholar, stayed for several days at the beginning of the month with the Dutch Charge d’Affaires before leaving for Egypt. It is believed he intends to spend some time touring Arabic-speaking countries. 320. A Dutch bacteriologist, M. Van der Hoog, who ran a useful laboratory in Jedda some years ago, is expected to return in the near future. In the interval he has embraced Islam, apparently in order to increase his opportunities for scientific work. 321. Copious rain is said to have fallen in Riyadh (paragraph 292 of the last report) towards the middle of December and there was a further fall in Jedda about the same time. These early rains give promise of a good winter and spring throughout all the northern parts of Saudi Arabia. The country round Jedda has been positively verdant. Varied, if uninspiring, wild flowers can be gathered by those prepared to affront the harsh winter winds which blow when the thermometer falls to 70 degrees and even lower. 322. Despite these favourable climatic conditions about a third of the European residents in Jedda were stricken with diseases, mostly sharp fevers, in the last ten days of December. This unusual wave of illness must be set down to the treachery of the climate and the mosquitoes, not to dissipation. Indeed, the British community, though afflicted, has suffered less in proportion than others despite considerable revelry on the evenings of the 24th and 25th December. 323. The approximate number of pilgrims who had reached Jedda from the principal countries of origin up to the end of December was as follows :— From the Straits Settlements :— Steamship Poelairoebiah 1,083 Steamship Alcinous 373 From India :— Steamship Jehangir ... 430 Steamship Islami 835 324. A new addition to the Turner Morrison fleet, the steamship Islami, arrived in Jedda on the 31st December. She is a vessel of 5,878 tons built on modern lines for the pilgrim traffic, with inter alia increased accommodation for pilgrims of the richer class.5 325. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during the month of December was as follows:— On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 female. Took refuge in December : 2 males and 1 female. Manumitted in December and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : 1 female. Left Legation voluntarily : 1 male. On hand at the end of the month : 1 female. 326. One of the above cases presents the peculiar feature that the woman is enceinte by the son of a well-known shereef. Fortunately the woman herself does not desire repatriation, which for reasons of religious feelings and others would present great difficulty. The Legation is trying to arrange for local manumission, with adequate guarantees for the woman’s safety, pending confinement. o^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT * EASTERN (Arabia). 4 iA' December 17, 1934.

Ibn Saud continued during November to receive at Riyadh visits from detachments of Nejdi tribesmen, of whom, it is stated, there has been a daily average of about 4.000 receiving the King’s bounty. This has taken the form of one large meal a day for three or four days, rations of tea, sugar and the like, and an £ ‘ annual allowance ’ ’ in cash per man. This hospitable treat ment, before the days of economic depression said to be an annual occurrence, has been resumed this year, but has been limited strictly to those who saw active service in the late war. It must nevertheless have cost Ibn Saud a pretty penny, and it would be interesting to know where the money came from. The number of fresh arrivals was daily diminishing about the middle of the month, and probably ceased soon after, as the King left for a week’s hunting expedition to the west of the Dahna on the 20th. 266. Amir Feisal left for Riyadh on the 10th, leaving Sheikh Abdullah-al- Fadhl to act as Viceroy and President of the Council of Ministers. He was still absent from the Hejaz at the end of the month. 267. Fuad Bey Hamza had not returned at the end of November, but, to anticipate the report for next month, he arrived on the 2nd December by Italian steamer. He was met on board by a representative of the Amir and by the Italian Charge d’Affaires, and, generally, his return was not so solitary an event as was his departure last July. 268. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman also left for Riyadh early in November, but returned within a few days to Mecca, where, on the 25th, he gave a dinner to Muhammad Talaat Harb Pasha (see paragraph 275). He visited Jedda during the last four days of the month. 269. Other arrivals in Riyadh were Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Misaid, Amir of Hail, who arrived from his post about the 28th October, and Khalid-al-Qarqani from Mecca a few days later. The presence of Amir Feisal and these various notables on visit to the Nejdi capital lends colour to the rumour that the King has been holding an important conference. 270. (Reference paragraph 237 in last month’s report.) Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, Amir of Jedda, returned on the 11th, after an absence of more than two months in Taif and Mecca. 271. The situation in the Teima area is still obscure. It is stated that the trouble arose through the refusal of Abdul Karim-bin-Rumman to pay “ zakat ” and the murder of some Saudi tax-collectors. Ibn Saud is said to have sent a force of 400 men under Amir Muhammad to deal with the malcontents. Another informant, recently arrived from Riyadh, categorically denied the existence of any trouble whatsoever, either in Teima or elsewhere (for unconfirmed reports had [281 r—1] /represented discontent to be wide-spread amongst the tribes, particularly in Hasa amongst the Ajman). He did not appear to connect Ibn Misaid’s visit to Riyadh with the situation at Teima; on the contrary, the Amir of Hail had gone to Riyadh “ on leave, and was still there.” This informant is usually reliable, but it is difficult to accept so flat a contradiction of many other circumstantial reports. It is, however, equally difficult to accept the persistent stories current here of Wapiti aeroplanes, loaded up with bombs, leaving Jedda for a northern destination. 272. These Saudi aircraft have, it is true, shown a certain increase in activity. It still is doubtful whether the third of the three more or less serviceable machines has yet taken the air. Two more Russians, said to be “ White,’ named L. Kouchlausky and V. Makovetzky, arrived from Suez on the 18th, to join their compatriots Nadenhoff and Maximoff. It is thought that of the four, two are pilots and two mechanics. The Russian lady referred to at paragraph 261 of last month’s report is believed to be Mme. Nadenhoff. 273. Both Mecca newspapers published towards the end of the month two announcements by the Ministry of Defence, one setting forth conditions of entry and service in the army for those desiring to enlist, and the second announcing the establishment, as from the 16th January, 1935, of a military school at Mecca, where candidates for commissioned rank are to take a three years’ course of training. 274. The reorganisation of the administration of Asir has been in progress for some little time. The principal Saudi official concerned, Seyyid Hashem, returned during the month to Jedda, and was understood to be satisfied with the progress made. He stated that tribal leaders were appointed (actually very few changes being made), boundaries and responsibilities fixed, and the oath of allegiance to Ibn Saud administered. 275. The visit of Talaat Harb Pasha, foreshadowed in paragraph 240 (g) of last month’s report, was delayed apparently, for he did not arrive until the 22nd November. He was accompanied by Midhat Yeghen Pasha, chairman of directors of the Banque Misr, Fuad Bey'Sultan and Ismail Bey Jad Barakat, members of the directorate of Banque Misr, Kemal Bey Aloui, manager of Misr Airwork, S.A.E., and Muhammad-al-Masiri Bey, manager of the Egyptian Steam Navigation Company. The party arrived in two machines, a de Havilland Dragon and a Tiger Moth, and made the journey from Egypt in one day. They motored up to Mecca on the 25th, were entertained to dinner by Sheikh Abdullah _ , Suleiman, returning on the 27th, leaving the following morning by air for Yanbu, whence they motored, as on their visit of last year, to Medina. They were to resume their flight to Egypt on the 1st December. The visit was briefer this year than last, though the personnel was more numerous. It is yet early to ascertain the objects of the visit, but it is believed they chiefly concerned preparations for the reception of Egyptian pilgrims during the forthcoming Haj, the Banque Misr, and an Egyptian shipping service. Talaat Harb Pasha’s liberality to charities this year is said to have proved disappointing to the Saudis, but it is stated that the Saudi Arab Government obtained a small loan from him, probably secured upon pilgrim dues to be paid by Egyptian pilgrims coming to this country. The pasha was anxious to fly to Riyadh, but permission was refused, a fact which may have disgruntled him somewhat. 276. The steamship Mariut and the steamship Manzaleh have called in at Jedda during the month. These two small vessels, flying the Egyptian flag, have plied experimentally, it is reported, between Suez, Jedda and Port Sudan. The Egyptian mission is understood to propose to follow up these trial runs, should thev prove successful, with a more regular service. ' 277. (Reference paragraph 240 (d) of last report.) Mr. Twitchell returned from Taif on the 7th and left for Port Sudan on the 11th, returning here on the 14th. He stated towards the end of the month that his concession had been approved, subject to minor alterations, and he was daily expecting to receive definite news. , , 278. The Najaf-Medina overland pilgrim route (reference paragraph 242 of last report) is now being examined jointly by Saudi and Iraqi representatives, who met recently, the Umm-al-Qura of the 30th announced, at Jemeyma. The survev is to be carried out particularly between Jemeyma and Medina. Mean while, M. Van De Poll confirmed that he had been approached, whilst in Taif during the summer, to take up a concession for the transport of pilgrims over3 this route by car. He was unable to follow up the suggestion, as he had too little information on certain material points, saw a number of formidable snags in the proposals and, further, regarded the conditions imposed by the Saudi Arab Government as too onerous. 279. (Reference paragraphs 191 and 230 of the reports for August and 'September.) Mr. Philby arrived from Riyadh on the 17th. At the end of the month he stated he expected 220 motor cars to arrive here for his firm. On the 18th Mr. Fearns, the Ford motor engineer who had been with Mr. Philby here before, returned to Jedda and resumed work with Sharqieh (Limited). 280. The announcement by the Saudi Arab Government in regard to the International Sanitary Convention of 1926 recorded at paragraph 245 of last month's report did not constitute a ratification, but, stated a representative of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, signified the adoption of the convention, with certain specific reserva tions, as a piece of Saudi domestic law. II.— F rontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 281. (Reference paragraph 250.) No further exchange took place during the month over the alleged violation of Saudi territory at Shaib Thanniya Tarif (the Saudi version of the name appears to be correct). Royal Air Force aero planes were, however, involved in another incident, this time in the Persian Gulf. Three planes forced landed on Jinnah Island on the 26th October, leaving again the same day for Bahrein. The Embassy in Bagdad were apparently not notified by the Royal Air Force of this unavoidable violation of Saudi territory until the 15th November. Not unexpectedly, the Saudi Arab Government received the regrets of this Legation very coldly, and declared their desire for a discussion on the whole subject “ in order to arrive at a final settlement.' 282. Saudi-Yemen relations appear, on the whole, happy, in spite of vague reports of frontier difficulties and smouldering bellicosity in some of the Imam’s sons. The Umm-al-Qura of the 23rd November reproduced an article published in the Sana-al-Iman denying that anything had occurred to ruffle good relations between the two countries, or that troops were being concentrated on the Saudi- Yemen frontier. The Mecca paper took up the refrain, hailing with rather heavy fancy, first, the crescent, and, ultimately, the full moon of peace which now irradiates the Arabian landscape, and thanking God for the Treaty of Taif, in which the spirit of Arab unity and brotherhood is enshrined. III.— Relations with Powers Outside A rabia. 283. (Reference paragraph 254.) The Saudi authorities have now formally , agreed to conversations on the subject of Legation dispensaries taking place with | Fuad Bey Hamza, but have so far proved unyielding as regards the exemption, 1 from customs dues, as hitherto, of medicines required for the forthcoming Haj. 284. No reply to the Legation’s note on the Saudi Nationality Law was received from the Saudi Arab Government during the month, the French I consulate applied early in November for instructions to make representations j in much the same sense as those of this Legation summarised at paragraph 255 I of the last report. IV.— Miscellaneous. 285. Mr. A. C. Oppenheim returned to the Legation from leave of absence on the 14th November. . , , , 286. Mr. Wiles, of Messrs. Turner Morrison and Co., arrived by the steam ship A lam on the 26th from Bombay and left the following day. He is making a tour of ports in the Red Sea. , , , , ^ ^ 287 Heer Riesenbach, a director of the Nederlandsche Maatschappij N.V., and his wife, arrived on the 18th and left for Egypt again on the 21st. It is understood that he inspected the Jedda branch of his firm. 288. Mr. Axel, of the Standard Oil Company of New York, arrived from / Egvpt on the 25th, and stayed here with Mr. and Mrs. Philby. To anticipate next month’s report, he left on the 2nd December for Massawa.4 289. (Reference paragraph 258.) The number of pilgrims and pilgrim ships for November were :— From India : One ship, 477 pilgrims. From Straits Settlements: One ship, with 346 pilgrims.^ ^ + 290. (Reference paragraph 262.) During November over 500 East Africans were repatriated, either by Suakin or Massawa. It is estimated that approxi mately 1,000 remain to be dealt with. 291. (Reference paragraph 259.) The official tariff of pilgrim dues was issued in Mecca early in November in Urdu, Javanese and Persian and has been duly forwarded by the Legation to British Governments interested. No version in Arabic has, however, yet appeared. 292. Rain fell on the 7th fairly generally all over the Hejaz to as far north as Dhiba. In Mecca a fall of -35 inch was recorded. Further heavy rains fell on the 18th, and it is stated that Nejd, with the exception of Riyadh itself, has had satisfactory rains, too. Temperatures in Jedda have, in consequence, fallen appreciably. 293. (Reference paragraph 271 of the report for December 1933.) The Waziriyeh water supply has, since it was last noticed in these reports, proved of increasing utility to Jedda. Improvements have been made in the pipe-line, and the quality and quantity of the water has shown a marked difference. Not content with bringing the water to the Eidarus reservoir, the local committee have embarked on a scheme of laying water on to various quarters of the town, j j and. most usefully, to the Quarantine Quay for the use of pilgrims. A number Ij of workmen are giving their services, and considerable progress has already been made. It is hoped to complete the work by the end of February. Far from exhausted by their labours during the day, the workmen turn for light refresh ment to intensive merrymaking at night and parade the town almost nightly with a shattering pandemonium of drums and chorussing. 294. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during the month of November was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male. Took refuge in November : 1 female. Manumitted in November and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : 1 female. of/ 3 In any further communication on this subject, please quote nmumcation on tins subject, please quote so. t &lt;e.&lt;\ &amp; 5 \-yv* ^ and address —not to any person by name, hut to— ' ~ “'i'he Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 INDIA DIRECT P.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for October 1934. I .—Internal Affairs. 234. Ibn Saud remained at Riyadh during the month, where he is reported to have received congratulatory visits from large numbers of Nejdi tribesmen. Such gatherings are usual at this season, and between live and six thousand of his subjects have been enjoying the King's hospitality this year. 235. Amir Feisal is said to have gone distinctly gayer since the departure of Ibn Saud last month. During October he has had little outings from Taif to the Wadi Liya and Ashira. Stories are not lacking that the jealousy which is believed to exist between him and Amir Saud has lately grown more marked. During the late war with the Yemen, the comparative eclipse of the heir apparent in the wilderness of Najran contrasted with the almost floodlit victories of his younger brother in the Tihama. Feisal also is said to be gaining steadily in popularity in the Hejaz. He, the travelled member of the family, is to the Nejd mind in constant contact with the representatives at Jedda of foreign Powers, whereas Saud lives in remote unvisited Riyadh where less scope offers to the practitioner in the sweet uses of publicity. Nejd, too, is poor; the Hejaz, on the other hand, reaps a varying, but often rich, annual crop of pilgrim dues—it were a sin if these sanctified offerings were to fall, upon the demise of the King, into the hands of other than the eldest son, and particularly into the hands of so insecure a Wahabi Fundamentalist as Feisal. He is now stated to have been summoned to Riyadh—some say he goes to be married—and is believed to be only putting off his departure for a few days in order to meet Muhammad Talaat Pasha Harb (see paragraph 240 (g)). 236. Ibn Saud has retained Sheikh Yusuf Yasin with him in Nejd, but this Minister’s hand is to be seen in much of the recent legislation of a nationalist tendency, to which references will be made later in this report. Fuad Bey Hamza has not yet returned from his European journey (see paragraph 253), but Taufiq Hamza recently declared that his brother would be back in the course of the next few weeks. If Amir Feisal goes off on a visit to Riyadh His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires will soon have no one in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to play with. 237. The Amir of Jedda (see paragraph 214 of the report for last month) has remained at Taif in the entourage of Amir Feisal, with wdiom he is very friendly. Sheikh Ali Taha has officiated here as usual during his absence. 238. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman (see paragraphs 215 and 216 of last month's report) after spending some time in Aneyzeh travelled from there about the 11th October direct to Medina. He returned to Mecca on the 24th, passing through Jedda, where to those who met him he had much to sav about Yanbu. as a potential fruit-growing district, and the Jebel Radhwa, where he had passedthree days, but less about his stay in Medina itself. This, if not strange, was disappointing, as his visit to Medina, in some minds, had been associated with the reported unrest in Teima. 239. The situation in that northern district is as indefinable as ever. Kumour is still busy but vague, and seems to feed chiefly on press reports from neighbouring .countries. The Saudi authorities still seem unconcerned. 240. The following items of economic or financial interest may be noted :— («) At the end of September the Saudi Government announced their adhesion to the agreements arrived at at the Tenth International Postal Conference, held in Cairo last spring. (b) The Umm-al-Qura of the 20th October announced the establishment, as from the 15th October, of a fortnightly mail and passenger service by car between Mecca and Riyadh. (c) On the 23rd October 6,000 Mauser rifles and three cases of machine guns were landed at Jedda from a Strick boat. They are said to have been consigned from Antwerp and imported by Khalid-al-Qarqani for account of Saudi Government, and are stated to be old and used war- stock, dating from 1916, worth anything from £2 to £3 a rifle. That Khalid-al-Qarqani should have imported this material from an obviously German source gives some weight to reports current that he has joined in partnership with Haji Qasim (formerly ? Machtig), the oi-devant clerk (of Balkan origin) of the late German consul here, Herr de Haas. This partnership is locally said to be making a bid for that phoenix concession : the Jedda-Mecca Railway. (d) Mr. Twitched is reported on good authority to have secured his gold mining concession, and the agreement, it is said, has now been sent to the King for approval and signature. Mr. Twitched, in the mean time, is still at Taif. ; {e) Mr. C. D. Cowper, the representative of Lever Brothers, arrived by Khediviul on the 21st and left by the same boat on the 24th October. He did not cad on the Legation and is said to have been more energetic in pushing Lever Brothers’ French products than Sunlight soap. (/) (Reference paragraph 217 of last month’s report.) Nothing further has been heard of the Syrian-Venezuelan pearl fishers. They have not put in an appearance again at Jedda, and it may be presumed are still at work along the coast. {g) Preparations for another visit to Jedda by air of Muhammad Talaat Pasha Harb, the Egyptian Senator and chairman of the directors of Banque Misr, are being made for early November (see paragraph 254 of the report for November 1933). 241. The Umm-al-Qura in its issues of the 19th and 26th October published the Saudi Government’s “ Regulations in respect of Landed Property in the Hejaz.” These are chiefly remarkable for the declaration that the law obtaining under previous Governments prohibiting foreigners from possessing landed property will be maintained, that ad foreigners who may have come into possession of such property must dispose of the same, and that those contravening these regulations will be liable to certain penalties prescribed, i he question has been referred by the Legation to His Majesty’s Government. 242. (Reference paragraph 221 of last month’s report.) There have been further references in the Saudi press during the month to the overland pilgrim route, which suggests that, while agreement between the Governments of Iraq and Saudi Arabia has not yet been reached, further progress in negotiations has been made. A project to bring pilgrims from the Persian Gulf to Mecca is also reported in the press to have been given the approval of the Saudi authorities. It may have some connexion with larger inland transport schemes already mentioned, but of which little fresh has been heard in October. 243. On the 5th October the Umm-al-Qura published official “ Instructions to Chauffeurs ” partly of a technical nature, which it would probably need special police to enforce. They will therefore probably be largely observed in the breach. 244. The reformist urge which is manifesting itself this summer in such various legislation to which paragraphs 153, 194. 195 and 223 in previous reports, as wed as foregoing paragraphs in this report, bear witness, was again[256 t—1] B 2 3 displayed in the publication during the month of comprehensive regulations against infectious diseases. These regulations are, in themselves, probably blameless and not to be discouraged, but they lack reality in the almost entire absence of reasonably equipped hospitals, clinics, isolation wards, laboratories. X-ray departments with qualified staffs, all of which are implied in the regulations, as well as the money and the knowledge to establish an even modestly ambitious health organisation. 245. The Saudi Government recently announced their adhesion to the International Sanitary Convention of 1926, but with reservations in respect of a number of articles. The first pilgrim ship for the 1935 Haj arrived on the 31st October (see paragraph 258), and no change in established procedure was reported, but the attitude of the Saudi authorities is being watched, and meanwhile the question as to whether this declaration with reservations constitutes a ratification has been referred to His Majesty’s Government. 246. A Wapiti plane was flown from Taif to Jedda on the 27th October, and was still here at the end of the month, though it was rumoured it was intended to be used against the malcontents of Teima. 247. The general economic condition of the country is still as grave as last year. Military expenditure has much more than offset increased revenues from last year’s pilgrimage; officials during the past six months have received less than one-third of their salaries; trade is stagnant and old stocks unliquidated; mendicancy is increasing, and the food and clothing now being distributed as charity in the name of the King are totally inadequate to alleviate the distress. There are certain hopes, perhaps still premature, of a further increase in the number of pilgrims in 1935—it is to be hoped that such optimism is well founded. 248. The following appointments have appeared in the Saut-al-Hejaz during the month :— Sheikh Ahmad-al-Isa as Amir of Yanbu; Sheikh Mansur-as-Saleh- ash-Shahqa as Amir of Wejh; Sheikh Ibrahim-an-Neshmi as Amir of Turaba; and Sheikh Hasan Ibn Duqaithar as Amir of Ranva. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 249. (Reference paragraph 226 of last month’s report.) Abdul Aziz Ibn Zeyd. the Saudi frontier official, left the Qarriyyat on the 3rd October intending to get into direct touch with his opposite number in Transjordan before crossing the frontier on his way to the Palmyra Conference. The Umm-al-Qura later published a short article describing the conference, which was to be attended by representatives of Iraq. Syria and Saudi Arabia, as having been arranged in order to deal with claims of the tribes of those countries in respect of loot. 250. On the 4th October the Saudi Government officially protested against an alleged violation of Saudi territory by two aeroplanes and a number of armed soldiers of the Transjordan Camel Corps at Thaniya Tarif north of Fajr. The note, which affirmed that the place mentioned was within Saudi Arabia, demanded indemnification and that measures be taken to prevent a recurrence of so manifest an aggression. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires replied on the 13th. under direction, that the Saudi Government probably referred to the presence on the 23rd September at Shaib Thaniyya Tarais of an armoured car and two aircraft in the course of their patrol on the regular Transjordan frontier patrol car track, and pointed out that if so, patrols along this track had been carried out as a matter of routine for the past three years, and that the car track on which Shaib Thaniyya Tarais is situated is not in Saudi Arabia but in Transjordan territory. No further exchange had taken place at the end of the month. 251. A further frontier incident threatened, but in the event passed off happily, about the same time when three Moth civil aeroplanes of the Bombay Flying Club lost their way flying from Bagdad to Basra and landed in the desert near Ansab at the western corner of the Saudi-Iraq Neutral Zone. Royal Ai&gt;- Force machines from Basra and armoured cars were used in prosecuting a vigorous search, which appeared almost certain to result in infraction of &amp; the Saudi frontier. The Saudi Government, however, played up extremely well Amir Feisal, to whom His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires telephoned in the first place, ordering the Amirs of Hail and El Hasa to send cars to help in the searchI 4 Hit t and to render all possible assistance. The lost planes were quickly found and ^audi assistance proved unnecessary. The affair terminated with a polite hope on the part of Amir Feisal that no one was injured and a perfect deluge of thanks from His Majesty’s Government, the Government of India, Bagdad and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires himself. k°ut the 24th October trial wireless telegraph communications were successfully exchanged between Riyadh and Basra. The occasion was officially noticed in an exchange of congratulatory telegrams between Nuri Pasha As Said and sheikh Yusuf Y asin, couched in unusually warm terms, and referring to their mutual desire for close collaboration, co-operation, &amp;c. HI -—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. • (Reference paragraph 236.) Fuad Bev Hamza, after terminating his visits to London (where he had conversations at the Foreign Office and was received by the Secretary of State), Paris and Rome, was in Istanbul at the &gt;eginning of the month, travelling thence to his home in Syria. 254. (Reference paragraph 227.) The question of Legation dispensaries and cognate questions were the subject of a conversation between Sir Andrew K\an an&lt; * I u . a( I Be y Hamza in London and of a further note to the Minister for oieign Affairs by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, elucidating certain points and restating the views of His Majesty’s Government on others. A reply from Amir Feisal on the 22nd October was uncompromising, and the matter was under further consideration at the end of the month. 255. As the outcome of further consideration which has recently been devoted to questions arising out of the Saudi Nationality Law of 1926 (the text of which is given as an appendix to the Jedda report for January-February 1931), Mr. Calvert addressed Amir Feisal on the 15th October, urging that the period of grace of six months, viz., to 5th February, 1935, now allowed to claimants to foieign nationality in which to prove their status, is insufficient. The oppor tunity was also taken to acquaint the Saudi Government that, even should British subjects or British-protected persons be unable to produce documents establishing their British status, they would not cease to be regarded by British authorities - , . .- prot ection to these per they remained on Saudi territory. 256. The Saut-al-Hejaz, early in October, published a short paragraph obviously reproduced from the Egyptian or Palestine press, in which similar notices had already appeared, stating that a Japanese mission is reported to intend paying a visit to this country to select a large number of youno- men between the ages of 20 and 25 years, of a certain education, with a view to sending them to Japan to complete their studies. What appears to be an equally lusty canaid also emanated from Egypt, that the Japanese Government have appointed a certain Muhammad-al-Saqqaf to be their representative in Saudi Arabia. 257 Celal Bey, the Turkish Charge and M. Adriaanse, the Dutch Charge returned to Jedda from leave in Europe on the 14th and 28th October respectively! IV.— Miscellaneous. 258. 1 he first pilgrim ship to arrive was the steamship Polyphemus, bringing on the 31st October /32 pilgrims from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. 259 1 he Saudi Government, in spite of several reminders, had not at the end of the month been able to supply the Legation with their official tariff of dues, &amp;c., for the forthcoming Haj season. The Ministry of Finance, however, informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires categorically'that the official tariff for 1935, which was in course of being printed as part of the Pilgrimage Guide published annually in Mecca, was exactly the same as that of last year. British authorities concerned have been, therefore, notified to that effect. 260. A Swiss lady, Mme. Piguet, arrived from Europe on the 21st, and was still here at the end of the month. She is on a visit to the Italian Charge d’Affaires. 5261. By the same boat a Russian lady arrived here to join her husband, one of the two pilots of the Saudi Government’s Wapiti planes (see paragraph 121 of the report for June). 262. Further progress has been made during the month in the formidable task of the mass repatriation of West African destitutes (reference paragraph 182 of the report for July), of whom there are believed to be about 2,000. Prepara- Jfctions have been made for a first contingent of 126 to leave on the 4th November for Suakin. 263. Government Departments and officials are now forsaking the chill altitudes of Taif for Mecca, In Jedda the month has shown high temperatures and considerable humidity. Impossible to rhapsodise over the joys of “ drinking limitless old October” in this climate! It is poor, thin, tepid stuff compai’ed with home-brew. 264. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during the month of October was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Took refuge in October : 2 females and 2 children; 1 male. Manumitted in October and repatriated ; 2 females and 2 children. Locally manumitted : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : 1 male.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT l \ X EASTERN (Arabia). / October 22, 1934 CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 6499/715/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—[Received October 22.) (No. 301. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, October 2, 1934. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for September 1934. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for 212. Ibn Saud left Taif for Riyadh on the 16th September, and evidently travelled in leisurely fashion, for he arrived at his Nejdi capital seven days later. He was accompanied by his son Amir Khalid, his brother Amir Abdullah-bin- Abdurrahman, and his nephew Amir Saud-bin-Saad. 213. Amir Feysal resumed his duties as Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 18th September. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who had paid a flying visit to Jedda on the 8th, when he saw His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, left for Riyadh with the King on the 16th. Fuad Hamza has been travelling in Europe, and was expected in London during September. 214. The Amir of Jedda, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Mu ammar, towards the end of August, left to join Amir Feysal in Taif. He had not returned to Jedda at the end of September. There have for some time been rumours of his transfer to some other post, but they appear to be unfounded. 215. The Minister of Finance, though not yet completely restored to health (see paragraph 189 of the report for August), was fit enough to leave about the 20th for Nejd. Several days after his departure, the Saut-al-Hijaz announced his appointment as Deputy Minister of Defence, a post which Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman is to hold in addition to his present office. 216. The new Deputy Minister of Defence, who has already played the role of War Minister in the recent affair with the Imam Yahva, instead of enjoying a period of recline upon his Yemeni laurels, may soon find himself confronted with a troublesome problem nearer home. Reports are widespread and fairly credible that considerable disaffection exists and has recently been expressing itself in the north-western districts of Jauf and Teima. The loyalty of Abdul Karim-bin-Rumman, the Governor of Teima, has long been suspect, and his attitude towards the central authority is said to have shown increasing truculence recently. Ibn Saud and his advisers are reported to be supremely unperturbed, but, nevertheless, recruiting is stated to be going on unostentatiously in Medina, whilst Transjordan report increased Saudi military forces along their frontier. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s own departure into Nejd, either to Riyadh or to the ; Aneiza, his own tribe, may not be unconnected with these present manifestations of unrest. 217. The foreign community in Jedda was agreeably aroused from its customary summer social lethargy by the appearance at the beginning of September of a Syrian-Venezuelan pearl-fisher, accompanied by a charming lady of Czechoslovakian origin, and a troupe of some seventeen Venezuelan and Chilean divers. They are here, it is understood, as the result of a five-year pearl-fishing concession granted gratis by Ibn Saud to the Qusaibis, to whom he is still heavily indebted. The Syrian bears a somewhat elusive name, but is believed to answer to that of Selim Sekundar. He is variously represented to January. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1.

He is believed to intend to make Jedda his base of operations for about three months, and at the end of September was at Yanbu fishing, without success, in northern waters. Later he proposes to try for pearls in the neighbourhood of Jizan. 218. The King has appointed, according to the L mm-al-Qura oi the 24th September, Seyyid Saleh Shata and Sheikh Khalid Abdul Walid-al-Qarqam to be members of the permanent committee of the Council of Ministers. r 219. The appointment of two officials, Mahsim hffendi Husain and Ibrahim / Lffendi Zare, as directors of the wireless stations at Riyadh and Mecca respectively has also been announced. The new directors were amongst those sent to London in 1930 by the Saudi Government to study wireless telegraphy. 220. The Umm-al-Qura reports the gift of an electric lighting plant for the ^ Haram, Mecca, by the Indian philanthropist, Nawab Sir Muhammad Muzammel \ Ullah Khan. 221. (Reference paragraph 196 of last month’s report.) According to the Umm-al-Qura of the 14th September, discussions between the Governments of Iraq and Saudi Arabia on the subject of the overland pilgrim route between Najaf and Medina, which had been suspended, have now been resumed. I he journal adds that it can be said that “ agreement has been achieved,” and it is expected that the road will be inspected during the months of October and November. Meanwhile, there are strong rumours that a transport company has been formed to conduct a motor service between Mecca and Medina and Koweit, the persons mentioned as being interested being M. van de Poll, the Dutch Moslem, and Muhammad Sadiq, the King’s chauffeur. These reports should be treated with reserve. M. van de Poll, it is understood, was recently refused permission to go to Riyadh at the time of the King’s return there. 222. The attitude of the Saudi Government towards the employment of / foreign chauffeurs (see paragraph 151 of Jedda report for July 1933) has recently been relaxed. Evidence of this was the publication at the beginning of the month of an official communique announcing that chauffeurs would henceforth be engaged irrespective of nationality, but subject to a strict understanding that men so employed would be subject to the orders of the Government to be sent wherever the Government listed. This condition is probably due to the fact that large numbers of Government-employed chauffeurs showed marked reluctance to proceed with their vehicles to the front during the Saudi-Yemen war. 223. The Umm-al-Qura has published, in weekly instalments during the month, new narcotic drugs regulations for the control and regulation of the importation, exportation and use of dangerous drugs. In most countries the new order would be virtuous and enlightened; it is perhaps a little wicked to think the Saudis have adopted these measures partly as a stick with which to belabour foreign dispensaries enjoying diplomatic immunity (see paragraph 227 below). II.—P rontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 224. There have been no echoes here of the tiff between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, recorded in paragraph 201 of last month’s report. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin made no reference to the affair at his meeting with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 8th, and the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires, Seyyid Kamil-al- Gilani, is still here. This young man, who is not so frequently seen by this Legation as were some of his predecessors, appears to find the society of the French consulate congenial. 225. L T nder instructions from His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires addressed the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs officially on the 13th September to ascertain, on behalf of the Imperial and International Communications Company, whether the Saudi Government would be prepared to enter into detailed discussions with the company with a view to the establishment of a wireless telegraph service between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia. It was understood that the company would propose to work with the Saudi station at Uqair. Amir Feysal lost no time in replying that his Government welcomed the proposal, and would be ready to discuss it further after they had had the opportunity of studying the question at greater length. They would suggest that the station at A1 Hasa be used, instead of Uqair, which was not now in working order.3 226. On the 29th. an official of the Minister for Foreign Affairs telephoned from Taif to inform the Legation that Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd, the Saudi frontier official in the north, proposed to travel about a week later to Palmyra to attend a conference, and begged that permission be sought from the Transjordan authorities for him to cross their territory. The following day, the 1 ransjordan authorities signified that no difficulties were anticipated. It seems not unlikely that the visit of this Saudi official to Palmyra is connected with the present discontents in the Jauf-Teima areas, referred to in paragraph 216 above. III .—Relations with Powers outside A rabid. 227. (Reference paragraphs 53 and 80.) During the month the delicate question of the position of Legation dispensaries has occasioned certain further exchanges. Towards the end of August, the Minister for Foreign Affairs circularised foreign missions to the effect that henceforth customs dues would be levied on medicines other than those imported for the private use of the mission. In accordance with instructions, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires stated the views of His Majesty’s Government, and suggested that conversations, which had taken place earlier in the year between Sir Andrew Ryan and Fuad Hamza and which had been interrupted, should be resumed in London, where Fuad Hamza was due to arrive on a visit during September. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin replied uncompromisingly, but undertook to acquaint his colleague and the Saudi Minister in London with this suggestion. The narcotic drugs regulations (referred to at paragraph 223 above), which envisaged stringent control of the importation, use, &amp;c., of narcotics under Government licence and inspection, though probably unexceptionable in themselves, nevertheless constitute a further attack on the present position of Legation dispensaries, which, of course, are not excluded from their scope. 228. Signor Persico, the Italian Charge d’Affaires, who went on short leave to Europe in July (see paragraph 176), returned on the 30th September. IV.— Miscellaneous. 229. (Reference paragraph 206.) The cable ship Retriever was in Jedda Roads twice during the month repairing the Sudan cable, finally leaving on the 24th. 230. Mr. Philby, who was down in Jedda from the 13th-15th September, left Taif for Riyadh about the 16th or 17th. Mr. Twitched at the end of the month was still at Taif rather disconsolately angling for his concession. It is believed he is thinking of giving it up as a bad job. M. van de Poll, since the way to Riyadh was barred to him, has returned to Medina. 231. Taif is now given over to Government departments and Amir Feysal and Meccan notables. There were several days of horse-racing before the King left for Riyadh, with handsome sums in prizes. These glories have now vanished with the Court, and in a few weeks even the Government administrations will be packing up and returning to Mecca. 232. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during the month of September was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 2 males. Took refuge in September : 1 male, 1 female. Manumitted in September and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : I male, 1 female. Left Legation voluntarily : 1 male. On hand at the end of the month : Nil. 233. The case referred to in paragraph 211 of last month’s report, which threatened to become troublesome, was settled by the disappearance of the man, who left the Legation premises of his own free will and without the knowledge of any member of the staff.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia) CONFIDENTIAL.

I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for August 1934. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for January. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for August 1934. I .—Internal Affairs. 184. August was a month of relaxation in Taif, of royal meetings, royal shooting parties, royal marryings and divorcings. As to the former sport, Ibn Saud is credited with a bag of 1,200 gazelle in the past two months; as to the latter, statisticians are not so precise. The King will not remove his Court to Riyadh until, it is believed, the middle of September at the earliest. 185. Amir Saud returned to Taif from Najran on the 10th August. He was met by his father at Rinya on the 8th, and by Amir Feisal and other princes at Thamuda on the 9th. He was given a very festive reception and later visited Mecca for two days, where he was again feted. He left for Riyadh on the 25th, with a train of some nine other princes, issuing, on his departure, a message of thanks to the country for the cordiality of its welcome. 186. Amir Feisal arrived in Jedda from Jizan on the 5th. He was clad in “ ihram ” and was said to be exhausted after a rough journey overland. There was no reception and he left the same day for Mecca and Taif in haste to be in time to meet Amir Saud. He, too, was given a public welcome in Mecca and shared the honours at Taif with his elder brother. 187. Amir Feisal made a later, unofficial and equally rapid visit to Jedda, in circumstances which have attracted attention to a little-advertised incident which took place last July upon the arrival of a contingent of Saudi soldiers from the Yemen by sea. It appears that the customs officials attempted to search the soldiers’ kit for tobacco and other contraband, whereupon a fracas took place, an official was removed to hospital injured, and some seventeen soldiers were imprisoned. The dispute was settled on the 22nd August by Amir Feisal, during this lightning visit, in favour of the Customs Administration, a decision which gave rise to some comment as Ibn Saud himself was believed to favour allowing his victorious soldiery the privilege of customs exemption on their return from the wars. 188. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was with the King throughout the month, both in Taif and in camp, save for a visit to Jedda over the 4th and 5th August in connexion with the return of Amir Feisal. On both the above dates he had interviews with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. 189. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, the Minister of Finance, remained in Taif indisposed during the month. He is understood to be recovering. During his illness his brother Hamad Suleiman acted for him. 190. A certain activity of an administrative character was reported during August. As the result of complaints by the townspeople of Mecca against one [206 aa—3]or two only of the sheikhs of quarters, Ibn Baud rather drastically dismissed the lot. He also despatched a mission of enquiry to Lith to deal with complaints made by the inhabitants against their Governor. A more important Special Com mission, consisting of five members, appointed some months ago to inspect the northern coastal area, from Rabigh to Dhiba, returned towards the end of the month after an absence of two-and-a-half months on their mission. 191. The agreement concerning the importation of motor-cars, tyres, tubes, accessories and spare parts between Mr. Philby’s firm, Sharqieh (Limited) and the Saudi Government was published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 10th and 17th August. The agreement, which supersedes the previous one, is to run for nine years. The company is to import Ford cars for the Government, Government companies and private companies, but private individuals may still import for their own use any make of car they please. The monopoly in the import of tyres and tubes is again assured to the company. The agreement is a longer document than its predecessor, and is more precise and detailed in regard to questions of price and method of payment. It is generally more liberal in its terms, but it still appears to contain provisions which may present some difficulty. Mr. Philby was in Jedda from the 17th to the 30th August, when he returned to Taif. 192. Mr. K. S. Twitchell (see paragraph 151 of last month's report) has been at Taif all the month, but appears to have made little progress towards securing his concession. It is thought Mr. Twitchell has not produced the argu ment that will always convince the Saudi Government—hard cash. 193. The second Wapiti aeroplane (see paragraph 152 of last month's report) was flown up to Taif early in the month and landed there safely. No further aerial activity has been observed in Jedda since. 194. During the month several fairly lengthy lists of foreign subjects who have adopted Saudi nationality have been published in successive issues of the Umm-al-Qura (see paragraph 153 {b) of the report for July). 195. Further instalments of the Coastguards Regulations, referred to at paragraph 153 (c) of the report for last month, have appeared. This is now a formidable document of eighty odd articles and an appendix. 196. The Umm-al-Qura of the 24th contained an official announcement that the Government were prepared to grant a concession for the transport of mail by motor-car between Mecca, Riyadh and Hasa, and between Mecca, Qasim, Hail and Jauf. They were further prepared to grant a concession for the transport of pilgrims to Mecca from the Persian Gulf, and to Mecca or Medina from “neighbouring frontiers.” Tenders are invited, and should be presented within fifteen days, on the basis of a bi-monthly service to Riyadh and Hasa, and a monthly service to Jauf. 197. In July it was announced that the postage stamps then current would be withdrawn, and a new set issued. There was some delay in carrying this out, but most denominations of the new issue were on sale at the end of July. The inscription “ Royaume de 1’Arabic Soudite” remains unchanged (see prefatory note to the report for January). 198. Sheikh Muhammad Tawil, the Director of Customs in Hasa, who had been on a visit to the Hejaz, left for Riyadh early in the month. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 199. The late theatre of war is quickly returning to the humdrum ways of peace. The captains and kings have departed, further sundry contingents of troops and quantities of supplies have arrived by sea from the south, and the Mecca Saut-al-Hejaz proclaimed on the 6th that the tribes along the Saudi-Yemen frontier had resumed their nomadic lives and the peaceful exchanges of commerce. The same newspaper quoted reports from a source outside this country of anti- Italian feeling in the Yemen, and on the 27th reproduced an official communique, issued from Sana, protesting, perhaps a thought too indignantly, against the wicked lies so maliciously invented. Relations with “Their beloved ally’’ were the very pattern of their kind. 200. The expression of regret at the unintentional transgression by a desert patrol of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier near Haditha, recorded in paragraph 166 of the report for last month, evoked a somewhat acid acknowledg-3 ment by the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin later took up with His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires several minor matters the Saudi Govern ment desired brought to the notice of the Transjordan authorities, as, for example, the alleged infraction of the frontier by shooting-parties from Transjordan, and the grazing of camels owned by the Transjordan authorities on the Saudi side of the boundary. 201. There has been a breeze in the Iraqi-Saudi relations. The Iraq Government on the 4th August complained to the Saudi Government, through their Charge d’Affaires here, of the Saudi Charge d’Affaires in Bagdad, Ibrahim-bin-Muammar, on the grounds of subversive activities at Kerbela and Najaf, propaganda for Ibn Saud as King of all Arabia, and the publishing of articles in the Iraqi press containing disparaging remarks about Amir Abdullah. The note, in which this complaint was formulated, demanded the recall of the Saudi Charge. Apparently the heavy-handed and over-emphatic manner in which this note was followed up by the Iraqi Charge stung Ibn Saud into a heated reply. Cooler counsels led the King to seek the advice of His Majesty’s Government, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin interviewing Mr. Calvert on the 5th, when he recounted a number of Saudi grievances against Iraq, and stated his Government would be obliged to ask for the recall of the Iraqi representative if the Iraqi Government persisted in their demand for the recall of Ibrahim-bin-Muammar. It was later understood from Bagdad that the excess and maladroitness of the Iraqi Charge here were recognised by his own Government, and a mollifying communication was to be addressed to the Saudi Government. Nothing further has since been heard. The breeze appears to have dropped. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 202. The Saudi Government are unable to be represented at the forthcoming j Locust Conference to be held in London, and so informed the Legation, through/ whom the invitation had been extended, towards the end of the month. 203. From brief references in the Egyptian press it is gathered that a note has been received from the Saudi Government dealing with a number of matters of mutual concern. These are said to include the question of the Holy Carpet, the problem of religious endowments, and the vexed question of nationality. 204. The Egyptian consul, Hafez Bey Amer, at present on leave, has been transferred to Bagdad as second secretary in the Egyptian Legation there. He is to be succeeded here by Abdul Hamid Munir Effendi, transferred from Madrid. IV .—M iscellaneous. 205. H.M.S. Hastings (Captain the Hon. C. P. Hermon-Hodge, D.S.C., R.N.) visited Jedda from the 2nd to the 6th August. This was the sloop’s first visit here since being recommissioned. A much-reduced British colony joined men from the ship in a practice game of cricket in an almost noon-day sun on the 5th. 206. Mr. W. E. Blackball, of the Sudan Government Cables, arrived on the 10th with two assistants from Port Sudan to examine the Jedda end of the cable. After a brief examination he is understood to have formed the opinion that the cable had been fouled by the anchor of the Saudi ship Nasr. He left on the 12th, but is expected to return later on. 207. M. van de Poll, the Dutch Moslem, passed through Jedda on the 16th from Medina to Mecca and Taif. He drove himself in an open car, clad in “ ihram ” and bareheaded, through the heat of the day. 208. August passes unmourned. The weather closed in even more stiflingly and clammily °than in August of last year (see paragraph 190 of the report for that month). 209. The British Museum, to whom Mr. Philby for some time past has been sending specimens of the wild life of Arabia, announce the classification of an entirely new species of Red-legged Partridge {Alectonns), with a black throat and a light grey head. The identification of a further dozen or so sub-species of various kinds is also claimed.210. The position as regards the manumission of slav6s during the month of August was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Took refuge in August: Two males. Manumitted in August and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil.&lt; j On hand at the end of the month : Two males. 211. The Legation is dealing with an awkward case of a negro man who took refuge as a slawe requesting repatriation to the Sudan, whom the authorities claim to be the son of a local Arab. The claim to paternity is unconvincing and further investigation is necessary.In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. on by name, Hut to— and address —not to any person “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.

His two eldest sons remained in their commands in the south. Fuad Bey Hamza continued to be Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Amir Feisal's absence, but was indisposed for a time, with the result that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin came to Jedda in his stead on the 25th May. 97. No important internal events were reported. The following are the only important economic items :— (a) The 2 million rounds of ammunition bought by the Saudi Government from Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) arrived in the Strick steamship Gorjistan on the 18th May (paragraph 48 (c) of March report) and were sent up to Mecca. Payment was completed next day. (b) About the same time Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) secured for Shell the contract for supplying benzine and petroleum to the Government up to next March (paragraph 71 (d) of last report). This disposes for the time being of Mr. Philby’s efforts to get a general monopoly of import for Sharqieh (Limited). Payment for the Government supplies is to be made by remission of future customs duty. (c) The press announced on the 5th May the formation of an “Arabian Steam Navigation Company ” to trade in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. It is in theory a private trading concern, but it has strong Government support, the manager being the permanent Under secretary in the Finance Ministry, and many prominent official personages having taken shares. The Government have, moreover, guaranteed the company against loss. The promoters recently bought two small vessels in Beirut, formerly under the French flag. One, renamed El Fath, arrived in Jedda on the 21st May, and sailed for Qunfidha and Jizan on the 23rd May. II.—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 98. The fall of Medi on the 26th April was followed by a rapid Saudi advance along the Yemen littoral. Luhayya offered no resistance, and was occupied on the 1st May. Hodeida might have presented more difficulty, but the Yemeni civil administration and military forces abandoned it on the 29th- 30th April, leaving it without any Government except that of certain localnotables, who organised some emergency measures, including the arming of a motor lorry with machine guns. On the evening of the 30th April, tribesmen and the local riff-raff made hay of the Government stores, the treasury, &amp;c., but private property was respected. 99. On receipt of the first news brought to Kamaran by numerous refugees, H.M.S. Penzance proceeded to Hodeida and arrived on the 1st May. The night was disturbed by firing, but nothing serious happened, except a small raid about sunrise, which was repulsed by the local armed lorry. The landing of a party from H.M.S. Penzance on the 2nd May, and other measures taken by her commander, as well as a flight round the town by three Royal Air Force aeroplanes from Aden early on the 3rd May, helped to steady the situation pending the arrival of the Saudi troops. Italian ships arrived on the 3rd and 4th May, and also landed parties rather larger than that from H.M.S. Penzance, but less welcome. The use of Eritrean natives was criticised. 100. The first Saudi troops reached Hodeida on the 5th May, and the Amir Feisal arrived next morning. Amicable relations were established between him and H.M.S. Penzance, but he was less gratified at the presence of Italian ships, and on the 7th May he refused to allow them to bring in a larger party than before, sent to relieve the posts already on shore. 101. The first measures taken by the Saudi authorities to control the situation at Hodeida were eminently satisfactory. They were consolidated by the despatch of the Minister of Finance, with wireless and all the elements of a regular civil administration, to run the town. He arrived on the 11th May. His Majesty’s Government reminded the Saudi Government that the setting up of the new administration did not alter their position as military occupants only, but there was no ground otherwise for complaint in regard to the Saudi action. His Majesty’s Government had at the outset arranged for two ships, as well as H.M.S. Penzance, to proceed to Aden, but it was not necessary to carry out this programme. When H.M.S. Penzance left on the 8th May, having re-embarked the post ashore, she was relieved by H.M.S. Enterprise. The Italians re-embarked their posts on the 10th May, and although they kept their ships at Hodeida, His Majesty’s Government did not consider it necessary to replace H.M.S. Enterprise after her departure on the 19th May. 102. Meanwhile, the Saudis had extended their occupation, still welcome to the tribes, as far as Beyt-al-Faqih to the south and places in the foothills. The Yemenis held Zebid and positions in the mountains, but showed during the first half of the month no signs of intending to counter-attack. The military situation on the eastern front remained, however, obscure, as the Saudi heir apparent disappeared completely from the public eye after the expulsion of the Yemenis from Najran on the 21st April. He might have been expected to attack Saada and the official silence regarding him gave rise to rumours that he had sustained a defeat. There is no confirmation of this. 103. Ibn Saud may have had news of the Amir Saud less happy than that from the Yemen littoral. He may have realised that in any case future military developments might be unfavourable, if the Imam were merely conserving his almost unused forces. He may have feared the disapproval of the Arab world, whose self-appointed representatives remained at his side throughout May, if he should attempt to destroy the independence of the Yemen. He may have feared foreign intervention (see below) in the same contingency. Whatever his reasons, he decided about the 12th May to suspend operations on all fronts and to resume peace negotiations, on the strength of a telegram from the Imam promising immediate compliance with his preliminary conditions, the surrender of the Idrisi, the evacuation of the Beni Malik-Faifa area, and the release of the hostages taken therein. 104. The Imam again failed to keep these promises, but the negotiations were pursued at Taif, and with such success that by the 25th May a complete peace treaty had been signed. It gave Najran to Ibn Saud, and adopted the previous de facto frontier as the definite boundary between the two countries elsewhere. There was only one snag. The King did not tighten up his preliminary conditions, as he had been expected to do and as some at least of his advisers hoped he would do. He did not ask for an indemnity or for the at least temporary retention of Hodeida, but he made the entry into force of the treaty conditional oil immediate compliance with his preliminary conditions as they stood. Indeed, he let it be known that, if they were not complied with by the 29th May, he would^ 3 restart hostilities and had made all preparations for that ^ resumption of hostilities seemed inevitable on the morning of the 29th i a^, u a communique issued that afternoon announced that the King had deci e o prolong the truce “ for a few days ” in consideration of fresh assuiances rom the Imam that he was really getting on with the fulfilment of the conditions, u that difficulties of communication had caused delay. r . , 105. The situation was thus uncertain, both from a military and a politica point of view, at the end of the month. Meanwhile, the situation at Model a was said to have deteriorated, and reports to that effect were confirmed on an after the 25th May, when, as a result of the first disquieting H.M.S. Penzance went back there. The number of Saudi troops at Hodeida itself had been reduced. The control over the troops as a whole seemed to ha\e relaxed. The men were unpaid and ammunition was short. No very serious incidents occurred in the town, but the troops gave trouble in the countryside^ and cases of rape were producing a revulsion of feeling among the tribes. There were, moreover, reports more impressive than before of Yemeni concentrations. The main forces were at Zebid, Menakha and Hajja. I here was, it was said, to be no general advance pending orders from the Imam, but other Yemeni forces held positions on an arc extending from east of Medi to Zebid. There was already frequent skirmishing. On the 31st May the Yemenis from Hajja were said to be threatening Zohra, 20 miles east of Luhayya, and another 1,000 men were said to have arrived at Zebid. It looked as though the Imam s game had been to play once more for time, and as though the prolongation of the truce might no longer rest with Ibn Sand. 106. Gossip has killed off various high personages, the reports of whose death have proved to be much exaggerated. It took many days to explode the rumour, which started in Hodeida on the 1st or 2nd May, that the Imam was dead. His eldest son was another victim, though he seems to be perfectly fit, and to be the heart and soul of the war party in the Yemen. The Amir Baud has also been reported dead or at any rate wounded. ^ , 107. The Saudi Government replied on the 13th May to the British blue line note mentioned m paragraph 77 of the last icpoit. The^ were unwilling to accept the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 as determining the leo-al position. They asserted no definite views as to what they themselves regard as the frontier, but expressed readiness to discuss the subject at any time. The British authorities concerned carried out, without incident, aerial recon naissances, with naval support, round the coasts of Qatar and across the base of the peninsula, which were completed on the 9th May. 108 Careful enquiry in Transjordan has revealed no foundation for the report (paragraph 79 of last report) that Hamid-bin-Rifada’s son is organising an anti-Saudi movement. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 109. The Saudi Government showed great anxiety during the earlier part of the month to ascertain the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Yemen situation, not only as regards its neutral character, which was clearly affirmed, but also with special reference to His Majesty’s Government’s views as to the probability of Italian intervention and the position they would take up if such intervention took place. His Majesty’s Minister was able to allay their fears to some extent and to head them off formal enquiries as to what His Majesty’s Government might do in purely hypothetical contingencies, all the more hypothetical as it was uncertain how far Ibn Saud himself meant to go in the direction of trying to destroy the Imam. 110. Direct approaches by the Saudi Government to the Italians produced fairly satisfactory, if not wholly convincing, results. 1 he Italian Charge d’Affaires in Jedda made a comforting communication to Fuad Bey Hamza on the 12th May, and its effect was enhanced by friendly conversations between the Chargd d’Affaires and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 25th-26th May. The fact remains that the Saudi Government are very suspicious of Italy. They might be more so, if they knew that the Italians, while doing only a little more than His Majesty’s Government at Hodeida, have apparently sent at least one ship and some forces to Mokha, although precise information in regard to their actionthere is not available in Jedda. One particular ground of suspicion has been the anxiety of the Italians to have an agent on shore at Hodeida. 111. The Saudi Government have vaguer fears regarding France and possibly Soviet Russia. The French also sent a sloop to Hodeida, the upshot of foreign naval activity at the end of the month being that there was one British sloop, one Italian sloop and a destroyer, and one French sloop. His Majesty’s Government would have liked to promote the departure of all foreign warships, subject to there being no ground for anticipating danger to foreign interests. The realisation of this ideal has, however, been made more difficult by the latest developments described above. IV.— Miscellaneous. 112. The climate of Jedda displayed its worst features during May, the combination of heat and damp being most trying. The strain imposed on the Legation staff by the Saudi-Yemen crisis was all the more severe, especially during the first half of the month. 113. A French cruiser, the Amiral Charnel, having on board Vice-Admiral Joubert, visited Jedda from the 19th to 21st May. 114. A French journalist, M. Gaston Berthey, representing the Journal des Dehats and the Journal, arrived in Jedda on the 13th May, and went on to Hodeida on or about the 16th May. An Egyptian journalist named Mahmoud Azmy, who has connexions in London and Paris as well as Cairo, and who purports to represent the Daily Express, arrived the same day, but went to Taif on the 14th. The former French consul in Jedda, Major Ibrahim Depui, has also been floating round in the Hejaz. 115. The dispersal of the pilgrimage continued normally, and by the end of the month was nearly complete. The Legation has had to repatriate an unusually large number of Indian destitutes, and is threatened with a formidable problem in connexion with the repatriation of Africans, whose numbers have been steadily growing in Mecca and Jedda in recent years, and for whom there is no longer adequate employment. The problem has been aggravated by the consequences of the fire mentioned in paragraph 90 of the last report, and by the sudden enforcement in Mecca of the regulation mentioned in paragraph 144 of the report for July 1933. 116. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during May was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 4 males, 3 females, 2 children. Took refuge in May : 1 male. Manumitted in May and repatriated : 3 males, 1 female, 1 child. Locally manumitted : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : 2 males, 2 females, 1 child. 117. The Royal slave mentioned in paragraph 94 of the last report was duly manumitted by the Acting Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior on behalf of his father the King, and was embarked for Jibuti, via Aden, under the auspices of the Legation on the 17th May. The case mentioned in paragraph 95 of the last report is still unsettled.[156 s—1] B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for January. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for June 1934. I .—Internal Affairs. 118. Ibn Saud remained in Taif until the 20th or 21st June, when he went off on a hunting expedition. His two eldest sons remained throughout the month in their commands in the south. It is not clear whether the third son, Muhammad, who went to Riyadh several weeks ago to lead reinforcements to the south, actually proceeded to the front, although one outside source represents him as having taken the field with large forces. The fourth son, Khalid, continued to act as President of the Council and as Minister of the Interior, until the promulgation on the 22nd June of a decree merging that Ministry in the office of the President of the Council. Fuad Bey Hamza continued to act as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and visited Jedda twice for short periods beginning on the 4th June and the 21st June. 119. There was again no important news from the interior. On the 26th June the Persian Legation in Jedda gave currency to a rumour of a movement against Ibn Saud at Riyadh. There has been no confirmation of this, and the settlement with the Yemen makes it increasingly unlikely that the disaffected elements which exist in the country will venture to try conclusions with the King in the near future. 120. On the 15th June the Saudi Government announced important amendments in the customs tariff, the general effect of which was (a) to do away with differences between the specific duties previously charged on rice, wheat and flour, which were formerly taxed at rates varying with the quality, but are now subjected to flat rates likely to give a rather higher yield on the total importation; and (b) to fix specific duties for a large range of normal articles which were previously lumped under general headings in the list of goods dutied ad valorem. There has been no public departure, so far as publication by the Central Govern ment is concerned, from the principle that the customs tariff applies to the whole of Saudi Arabia, but it was recently reported from Bahrein that the duties on certain articles in Hasa had been reduced. This may be due to the action of the local Director of Customs, Muhammad Tawil, who has recently visited the Hejaz. This personage, though he has shown himself an active collector of money for Ibn Saud’s purposes, is shrewd enough to realise the detrimental effect of the sudden extension to the Persian Gulf coast last year of the Hejazi system of duties, when the latter were increased as described in paragraph 85 of the report for May 1933. 121. On the 3rd June there arrived in Jedda two airmen, a pilot and a mechanic apparently, whom the Saudi Government had engaged in Egypt. They are White Russians, one or both of whom were employed in the Hejaz in King Hussein’s time. They have held very much aloof from the European life of Jedda. They apparently found the three sound Wapitis in good conditionexcept for lack of tyres, tubes, &amp;c. These were still awaited at the end of the month. 122. No progress has been made towards the grant by Ibn Sand and the Sheikh of Koweit of an oil concession in the Koweit neutral zone. As a result of certain statements made by Mr. Ydlibi in London, Sir Andrew Ryan addressed^, enquiries to Fuad Bey Hamza on the 6th June, the replies to which showed that the Saudi Government had gone a long way towards accepting Mr. \dlibi s proposals (see paragraph 71 (a) of the report for April), but have not formally committed themselves pending their acceptance by the Sheikh of Koweit. Moreover, they now admit an obligation to give the Standard Oil Company of California the first refusal, as far as they are concerned, of any concession which may be contemplated, once terms acceptable to both themselves and the sheikh have been arrived at. This produces a complicated situation for everyone concerned, including His Majesty’s Government and the Iraq Petroleum Company, who have shown interest in the affair. 123. The Saudi Government announced officially on the 15th June that they had cancelled the concession to Dr. Jeelani for a railway between Jedda and Mecca, on grounds of non-fulfilment of the conditions after more than one prolongation of the period allowed (see paragraph 242 of the report for November 1933). 124. Mr. Philby claims to have reached a new agreement with the Saudi Government regarding the importation of cars to take the place of the agreement which broke down last year (see paragraphs 241 and 268 of the reports for November and December 1933). According to a statement which he made to Sir Andrew Ryan in June, the new arrangement is more favourable to Sharqieh (Limited) and therefore more practical, but it was dependent on the acquiescence of the Ford Company. The position as regards this is not yet known to the Legation, and no public announcement has been made. 125. Mr. K. S. Twitchell (paragraph 267 of the report for December) returned to Jedda on the 27th June as the representative of the newly-formed Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limted), a private company with a capital of £20,000. The participants, other than Mr. Twitchell, in this appear to be mainly, if not all, British, and to represent an important backing of varied interests for Mr. Twitchell’s long cherished gold-mining scheme. He is to treat with the Government for prospecting rights in various areas. 126. Ibn Saud was reported early in June to have made grants of ground in Jedda to the Minister of Finance and his brother, to Fuad Bey Hamza and to the gentleman who has succeeded the late Governor of Jedda as local head of the principal commercial house in the place. This appears to be a new departure, and the report is confirmed as regards the merchant, Hajji Yusuf Zeinal, whose firm have long done much business with the Government and have imported unusually large quantities of rice this year. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 127. The Yemeni concentrations described in paragraph 105 of the last report seemed at the end of May to foreshadow a possible attack on the baudi position in the Yemen littoral, the impression that the Imam had merely recule your mieux sauter appeared to be borne out by a report that an Italian ship had arrived at Mocha on the 25th May with 6 million rounds of ammunition, as well as rifles, machine guns and stores. Nevertheless, the Imam surrendered two of the three principal Idrisis, who reached Hodeida on the 3rd June and whose “ family ” of 300 persons were also surrendered. It soon became apparent that the Imam had no intention of fighting and was taking definite steps to complete the fulfilment of the three conditions, to which Ibn Saud had subordinated the coming into force of the peace treaty already signed at Taif. Although occasional skirmishes were still reported from Hodeida, the military movements presented increasingly the appearance of being preparatory to the resumption of control by the Yemenis, and a Saudi evacuation, partly by land but largely by sea, from Hodeida. 128. The detente proceeded rapidly by a series of stages, the most important of which may be briefly summed up as follows : It was officially announced on the 11th June that the Yemeni forces had evacuated the whole of the mountain area, and that the one important Idrisi still outstanding had been sent to Sana[156 s—1] B 2 3 with a view to his being surrendered. Next day, the 12th June, the Imam’s envoy, Abdullah-al-Wazir, left Jedda by sea, accompanied by the mission of Arab mediators, reduced in number by the earlier departure of Muhammad Ali Pasha Allouba for Egypt. A courier carrying Ibn Saud's ratification of the peace treaty y** left in the same ship. It arrived at Hodeida late on the 14th June, and the mediators went to Sana for a few days on the 16th. On the 19th June it became known that the Imam had accepted the treaty and had signed his instrument of ratification. He would appear to have completed also the arrangements for the surrender of Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi about that time, though the date for the actual handing over has not yet been announced. Finally, on the 22nd June the ratifications of the peace treaty were exchanged at Hodeida between the Amir Feisal and Abdullah-al-Wazir. 129. After this everything proceeded smoothly up to the end of the month. Various outlying places were formally redelivered to the Yemenis, and news of the handing over of Hodeida itself was expected at any moment. Several parties of Saudis left by land for the north, and some by sea, though a difficulty over ships made it impossible to ship more than a small portion of the 1,500 troops who were to be embarked on the 29th June. The Saudi Government were looking for transport for much larger numbers, and were understood on the 30th June to have chartered an Indian pilgrim ship to collect the troops from Hodeida. The Amir Feisal was expected to leave on the 1st July. 130. During all this time there has been practically no news of the heir apparent. He would appear to have attacked the Yemenis at Fara towards the end of May, when Ibn Saud was threatening to resume hostilities, but to have been called off. Since then he has been lost to sight and almost to memory. 131. The Treaty of Taif, to give it its official name, proves to have been signed on the 20th May. It is a lengthy document in twenty-three articles, with a protocol on arbitration and six letters annexed. The most important article of the treaty defines the frontier, on the double principle of describing the general trend of the boundary by directions and place names and indicating separately the allocation of various places and tribes. It starts from the sea a short way north of Medi, and gives to Ibn Saud the mountain area which has figured so much in recent events, as well as Najran. Its value is not so much that it adds to his territory as that it confirms his legal title, at any rate for twenty lunar years, the duration of the treaty, to what he has claimed most insistently. The treaty stresses the spirit of Islamic and Arab brotherhood in which it has been concluded between two countries forming “ one nation,” but there is nothing in it to support the view that it amounts to a practical alliance, much less to the establishment of a veiled Saudi protectorate over the Yemen. It gives the Imam, for the first time in Saudi official language, the title of His Majesty the King of the Yemen, and has everv outward mark of being an agreement made on equal terms. There is no provision for an indemnity, and no evidence to support the suggestion made in some quarters that Ibn Saud has got one under some separate arrangement. 132. Hasan and Abdul-Aziz-al-Idrisi reached Mecca on the 25th June, and were to be followed by Abdul-Wahhab. All three will probably be interned at Riyadh, but they are likely to be quite well treated, the King having confirmed his assurances in this respect in published replies to their telegrams of repentant submission. 133. The question of Ibn Saud's eastern frontier, which started as one affecting Qatar, has become so definitely a major Anglo-Saudi question that it is better dealt with in chapter III below. 134. There is nothing important to record in connexion with Ibn Sand’s other frontiers, except that on the 2nd June Fuad Bey Hamza, returning a belated reply to Mr. Calvert’s letter of the 18th November (paragraph 251 of the report for November) about Hazim, enquired, innocent-like, whether Sir Andrew Ryan would supply him with any information regarding the recent survey work at that place. III .—Relations with Powers outside A rabia. 135. On the 15th June the Fegation addressed a short note to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs reaffirming bluntly, under instructions, the view of His Majesty’s Government that the legal position in regard to Ibn Saud's eastern4 boundaries is determined by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-14. This elicited an equally strong note from the Saudi Government, dated the 20th June, in which they rejected this view and which they supported by a memorandum. Their main points were that they contested the locus standi of the 1 urkish Government in regard to the territories involved at any time after Ibn Saud s occupation of Hasa on the 13th April, 1913. and that His Majesty s Government had, by their first treaty with Ibn Saud of the 26th December, 1915, undertaken to recognise the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over the dominions of his ancestors, the limits of which were to be determined in due course. The memorandum made extensive claims in regard to Qatar and the hinterland of the Trucial Coast. The firmness of the Saudi contentions was to some extent mitigated by the anxiety displayed by Fuad Bey Hamza for a friendly settlement, in conversation with Sir Andrew Ryan on the 22nd June. 136. Other questions with the Saudi Government pursued a normal course, but the “blue line' policy of His Majesty's Government and other factors had thrown Ibn Saud into one of his periodic fits of anxiety as to his position vis-d-vis His Majesty's Government. On the 6th June Fuad Bey Hamza conveyed to His Majesty's Government, through Sir Andrew Ryan, an enquiry from the King as to whether His Majesty’s Government would engage in “conversations with a view to a co-ordination of policy. As on previous occasions, His Majesty expressed readiness to meet the views of His Majesty’s Government at all points, if only they would be forthcoming, and he referred darkly to coming dangers, including the danger to the Arab world from the hostility of Turkey and Persia to Iraq in particular and to the Arab cause in general. The reply of Flis Majesty’s Government, which Sir Andrew Ryan communicated to Fuad Bey on the 22nd June, was also, as usual, sympathetic but non-committal. There is no likelihood of formal conversations, but it is possible that Fuad Bey may visit London privately in the autumn, in which case he has been promised an oppor tunity of discussing outstanding questions with the Foreign Office. He contem plates a tour in Europe for reasons of health in any case. 137. British, Italian and French ships continued to keep an eye on Hodeida during the month, the two British sloops taking the duty alternately. The Saudi Government, having decided to evacuate, no longer worried over the presence of the ships. At the end of June it looked, amusingly enough, as though the display of Italian flags on shore might cause trouble between the Italian authorities and the Imam, as soon as the latter reoccupied the town. The prospect on the 30th June was that all the foreign ships would leave simultaneously as soon as it should become clear that no danger to foreign subjects need be appre hended, but His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to tie themselves too definitely to the principle of simultaneous withdrawal, in case the Italians should delay their departure unduly. 138. The Diplomatic Body in Jedda, depleted by the departure for abroad of the Dutch, Persian and Egyptian representatives and the departure for Taif of the Soviet Minister and the Acting Turkish Charge d'Affaires, has been reinforced by the arrival on the 17th June of the new Iraqi Charge d’Affaires and consul- general, Seyyid Kamil-al-Gilani. He has been brought on in the world by his brother, a former Prime Minister of Iraq. Though not very intelligent, he seems to have a good knowledge of Arab politics and politicians and is amusingly frank about such things as his efforts to counteract Saudi influence in Syria, during his recent sojourn in Beirut as consul-general. IV.— Miscellaneous. 139. The King’s birthday was celebrated at the British Legation on the 4th June by a reception attended by about 100 guests of all the usual variety. The local notables included Fuad Bey Hamza and the Governor of Jedda. Mr. Philby, who, as he grows older, grows milder in his attitude towards King and country, if not much less critical of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Arabia, expedited a journey from Taif to Jedda in order to be present. 140. The small trickle of foreign journalists continued in June. An Austrian, M. H. Lechenperg, who arrived on the 3rd June, was allowed to visit Taif. There was also an Italian whose name is unknown to the British Legation. Even his sex was in doubt for a day or two, as some joker put it about that the bachelor Italian Charge d’Affaires was entertaining a lady of the press. Saudi5 r\ Arabia has had the unusual and agreeable senstion for some little time of being in the world’s eye. A Japanese paper has hailed Ibn Saud as the equal of European statesmen, though still the denizen of a desert; a man greater than Hitler, had he but a nation like the Germans behind him. And the Japan Times of Tokyo published on the 7th May a long article by Mr. Philby. 141. Mr. A. S. Calvert returned to Jedda on the 20th June and will take charge of the Legation on the departure of His Majesty’s Minister, probably on the 15th July. Mr. E. J. Powell, of His Majesty’s Office of Works, arrived in Jedda on a short visit on the 29th June. 142. There are few pilgrims left in the Hejaz. The number of Indians who have had to be repatriated as destitutes up to date is 563. The Legation is still faced with the problem of the Africans mentioned in paragraph 115 of the last report. Otherwise the past pilgrimage period has passed happily enough. 143. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during the month of June was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 2 males, 2 females, 1 child. Took refuge in June : 1 female, 1 child. Manumitted in June and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : 1 female. Disposed of by special arrangement: 1 male, 1 female, 1 child. On hand at the end of the month : 1 female, 1 child. 144. The fifth heading above relates to the family mentioned in paragraph 95 &lt;of the report for April. Following on prolonged negotiations with the local authorities and reference to the Foreign Office, the Legation accepted a duly attested and legalised certificate by the alleged owner, which sufficiently established the free status of the two adults and the fact that they were lawfully married; and agreed not to send them out of the country on the strength of this certificate and of arrangements for their being looked after by a highly respectable local family. o[181 u— 1] B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). r p. z. i 1 5755 I LiHi J ■ August 20, 1934.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for July 1934. I .—Internal Affairs. 145. Ibn Saud returned from his hunting expedition in the direction of Thamuda at the end of June, and a month later was still at laif. He has spent much of the month in visits of inspection as well as in sport in the neighbourhood of Taif, and, it is believed, is now anxious to get back to Riyadh, whither his brother Amir Abdullah returned about the middle of the month. Amir Saud remained somewhat disturbingly at the head of certain forces in Najran until the third week in July, when he withdrew to Abha, on his way to Taif; and Amir Feisal, who withdrew from Hodeida at the beginning of the month, at the end was reported to be still at Jizan, or on the point of leaving for Qunhda. 146. The post of Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs changed hands at the beginning of July. Fuad Hamza had been unwell for some time, but latterly had professed to be so completely his own man again, that it was a little surprising to learn of his displacement by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on grounds of ill-health. On the 8th, Fuad Hamza left for Port Sudan en route for Europe, and was seen off by Sir Andrew Ryan at an almost ominously deserted quarantine quay. 147. Two days later Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman returned to this port from Hudeida, rather shaken by the voyage on the steamship ~Nasr, a new unit in Saudi Arabia’s miniature mercantile marine, but jubilant at the successful issue to the trial of strength with the Yemen. He was accorded a welcome as notable as Fuad Hamza’s departure was unhonoured. 148. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin visited Jedda on the 4th and 19th July, when he met Sir Andrew Ryan and His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires respectively. 149. It is reported that the Saudi Government have recently received a further sum in gold from the Standard Oil Company of California in respect of their Hasa concession. In paragraph 169 of Jedda report for August 1933, the arrival of the sum of £35,000 gold was recorded. The latest payment is said to be £20,000 gold, which together with £30,000 gold of the previous sum, is believed to have been received by the Saudi Government as a loan of £50,000 gold. The odd £5,000 gold is probably an annual sum paid as rent. 150. Nothing further has yet been heard of Mr. Philby’s agreement with the Saudi Government. He has remained at Taif, except for a short visit to Jedda at the middle of the month, believed to have been made chiefly with a view to meeting Mr. Twitchell. 151. The latter, whose arrival was reported last month in paragraph 125, left for Taif himself about the 23rd, no doubt with the idea of engaging the Saudi authorities at closer quarters. 152. The pilot and mechanic mentioned in paragraph 121 of last month’s report soon got to work, with the result that one of the Wapitis was taken up for2 trial flights on the 2nd July and succeeding days. On the 5th, apparently having been tested sufficiently, it was flown to Taif, but, unfortunately, on attempting to land there, the pilot, it is alleged, having mistaken a flock of sheep for a landing mark, crashed into a wall and overturned into an adjoining vineyard.. The pilot escaped unscathed to return to Jedda for parts to replace a broken 1 propeller, damaged wings and undercarriage. It is not yet known how far he has succeeded in repairing the wrecked machine, but on the last day of July, nothing daunted, he was taking another Wapiti up at Jedda for trial flights, and she, too, is expected to fly to Taif in a few days. In view of all this aerial activity the Government have decided, the Umm-al-Qura of the 6th July announced, to establish an aerodrome, which is to be at Taif, rather than at Jedda, for climatic reasons. 153. A number of official communiques have been published during the month in the Umm-al-Qura :— (a) One provides for the licensing of merchants and professional men, and imposes a graduated tax of from £2 to 5s. gold per annum in accordance with the apparent importance of the individual. (b) Another is of considerable importance to claimants to foreign nationality as it fixes a time-limit, a date in February 1935, within which such claims should be established. Points arising out of this question are the subject of correspondence with the Foreign Office. (c) Regulations with regard to coastguards form the subject of another. (d) A fourth reprints certain sections of the Registration of Companies Regulations, issued in July 1928, as a reminder of the penalties attaching to a failure of companies to register. 154. New schools are to be opened at Mecca and Medina, the Vmm-al-Qura announced on the 27th July, and a public library is also to be established in Mecca. The project for the foundation of an industrial school there is being studied. 155. Sheikh Kamel-el-Qassab, an ex-Director of Education in the Hejaz, well known both here and, it is believed, in Palestine as a Saudi propagandist, arrived here from Haifa towards the end of the month and proceeded at once to Taif as the guest of Ibn Saud. 156. The Jedda Committee of Virtue, whose moving spirit is perhaps the young Amir, have shown greater activity of late. They sternly called leading members of the Indian Patna Community to account for the heresy of celebrating the “ Maulid-an-Nabi ” (a charge the Indians denied), and have since destroyed in public a number of gramophones. Whilst there may be a good deal to be said against the Jedda gramophone, this urge to purify and regenerate has extended to the game of football, now banned in Jedda, though not, it is understood, in Mecca. The reasons for this veto are rather curious if it is indeed true that local merchants persuaded the Amir to take this course, not because the game was impure or unvirtuous, but because life is too real and too earnest for so frivolous a pastime which is so much a social leveller into the bargain. 157. The Umm-al-Qura of the 20th stated that the Medical First Aid Association propose to establish, at their own expense, a hospital at Taif. This humanitarian project has, it is said, received the sanction of high authority. 158. Mehdi Bey, Chief of Police, has been appointed to take charge of the affairs of the Amirate of Taif, in addition to his own duties. 159. Sheikh Muhammad Id-ar-Rawwaf, First Assistant in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, returned to Taif from leave during the month. II—l \ontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 160. The evacuation of Hodeida by the Saudi forces, which was proceeding at the latter end of June (see paragraph 129 of last month’s report), continued in the early days of July and was complete by the 6th. Contingents were drafted daily north by land and sea, the steamship Alavi, for instance, leaving on the 4th \vith 1,500 men on board. Amir Feisal left by car on the 5th, and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman in the steamship Nasr on the 6th with the remaining troops. The parting of Saudi and Yemeni leaders is stated to have been marked by cordiality on both sides. The Imam’s representative, Ahdullah-al-Wazir,[181 u—1] B 2 3 assumed control of the town, and of Loheya, and gave to the Senior h«aval Oihcei, Red Sea Sloops, satisfactory assurances for the safeguard of British lives and property. The British sloop, H.M.S. Hastings, thereupon left Hodeida on the 7th, French and Italian ships leaving the same day, although one Italian ship had sailed on the day before. Saudi troops continued to arrive in Jedda throughout -.O the month, at first from Hodeida and later from Jizan. Ihey were received undemonstratively by the local inhabitants, and were soon whisked oft m motoi trucks to Mecca and Taif, there to receive largesse in the shape of rice and rials, before they returned to their native deserts. . 161. Amir Feisal made his way from Hodeida to Jizan, where he remained for the purpose, it was said, of overhauling the local Administration. About the 31st July he left, or was on the point of leaving, for Qunfida and is shortly expected at Jedda. The lengthy silence that has brooded over the presence of Amir Saud in Najran was broken on the 13th, when the Urn'm-al-Qura declared that he was still in that province “supervising certain necessary arrangements” and would postpone his withdrawal until the simultaneous withdrawal of Saif-ul-Islam Ahmad, at the time in disturbingly close proximity to the Saudi Amir, could be arranged. The feverish rumours to which this announcement gave rise were speedily dissipated by the subsequent communique of the 27th July, reporting the withdrawal of Amir Saud to Abha en route for Taif. 162. (Reference paragraph 132 of last month’s report) Seyyids Hasan and Abdul Aziz-al-Idrisi have been allowed to remain in Mecca, where the King is placing a palace at their disposal. Seyyid Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi was reported to have reached Taif on the 9th to join his two relatives. 163. Amongst other actors to make their exit from this, it is to be hoped, final scene were the Peace Mission (reference paragraph 128 of last month s report), who finally withdrew from Sana and left the Yemen. 164. Towards the end of the month the appointment was announced of Sheikh Assaf-ibn-Husayn, ex-Amir of Rus, as Amir of Najran and all the territories of Yam. The Saudi authorities, it would appear, are now turning their attention to the administrative consolidation of these territories. 165. During the month congratulatory telegrams were addressed to Ibn Saud by, among others, King Ghazi and Prince Omar Toussoun of Egypt. The message of the former hailed the happy consummation of the struggle with the Yemen in the Treaty of Taif as a step in the direction of unity between Arab nations. 166. On the 17th July the Transjordan authorities informed the Legation that on the 2nd July an armed car patrol unwittingly crossed the Saudi-Trans- j or dan frontier near Haditha. The patrol called at the Saudi post at this place to explain. The Legation expressed officially to the Saudi Arab Government the regrets of the Transjordan authorities at this unintentional transgression of the frontier. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 167. Present cordiality in relations between the British Legation was marked by a Royal invitation to His Majesty’s Minister to visit Ibn Saud at Taif. Sir Andrew Ryan, accompanied by Mr. G. W. Furlonge, left Jedda on the 12th and returned on the 14th July, having been given a distinguished reception and much hospitable entertainment. Ibn Saud was gratified to receive the congratulations of His Majesty’s Government on the successful termination of his dispute with the Imam of the Yemen, conveyed to him by Sir Andrew. He evinced a desire for closer relations with His Majesty’s Government, and in a series of business talks with His Majesty’s Minister discussed a number of the major questions at present under the consideration of the two Governments. 168. Ibn Saud expressed himself with great vigour on the subject of the Qatar boundary of the “blue line” (see paragraph 135 of last month’s report). The King most emphatically denied the thesis that the Turkish Government in 1913-14, had any locus standi permitting them to dispose of his own ancestral rights. Sir Andrew Ryan hopes to discuss this question upon his arrival in London with His Majesty's Government. 169. The King also adverted to the Koweit blockade, and expressed a desire to reach a settlement on terms advantageous to each party.170. Ibn Saud displayed considerable feeling over the question of Bahrein transit dues, an attempt, as he conceived it, to boycott the development of Ras Tanura and other Saudi ports in the Persian Gulf. Sir Andrew Ryan essayed to mollify the King, and undertook to discuss the question upon his arrival in London. 171. Whilst at Taif Sir Andrew Ryan received from Ibn Saud a special message of thanks for the helpful attitude of the commanding officers of the Red Sea Sloops of the Royal navy present at Hodeida during the recent troubles. A suitable reply was returned and the message duly conveyed to the officers concerned. 172. Indeed, not only were the relations between the British sloops and such Saudi personages as Amir Feisal and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman excellent, but so, too, were those established with Abdullah-al-Wazir before H.M.S. Hastings finally left Hodeida on the 7th. 173. The final departure of British, French and Italian sloops has been noted in an earlier paragraph. The Italians were less fortunate in their relations with both Saudi and Yemeni authorities, taking a toss over the flag question, over which they had to yield with as good a grace as they could muster and cease to fly their flag ashore; and departing from Hodeida with a snub and sardonic enquiry from Abdullah-al-Wazir whether the Italian doctors Tazzi and Jemecelli were taking so favourable an opportunity as the departure of the sloop afforded to leave Hodeida too. 174. An Abyssinian mission, headed by a Mr. David Hall, arrived here from Addis Ababa via the Yemen on the 1st July and after a short visit to Taif, where they were entertained by the King, they left for Abyssinia on the 15th. They were the bearers of a letter from the Emperor to Ibn Saud. in which the former expressed his sorrow at the outbreak of war with the Yemen and his hopes for its speedy conclusion. It is believed a similar letter was conveyed to the Imam by this mission. Ibn Saud suitably replied and the royal correspondence was duly published in the local press. It is stated that the mission was also charged with proposals regarding a commercial agreement between the two countries. 175. The Russian dentist here, named Morsen, is stated to have accom panied Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman to Hodeida, but in what capacity is not apparent. He returned with the Minister of Finance on the 10th July and is now back at work again in the Soviet Legation. 176. The Diplomatic Body continued to waste away. M. Persico went on two months’ leave to Europe on the 8th July, and the French Algerian vice- consul and a junior member in the Persian Legation, temporarily in charge, went later in the month. The latter was replaced by a youth named (?) Salah-ed-Din Falah. IV.— Miscellaneous. 177. Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan left for the United Kingdom on leave on the 13th July. They were accompanied as far as Port Sudan by Mr. B. W. Seager, who has now left Jedda, after serving here for some eight years, on transfer to Aden. 178. Mr. G. W. Furlonge sailed from Jedda for Europe on leave pending transfer, after three years at this post. 179. Mr. H. M. Eyres, who has replaced Mr. Furlonge, arrived from Suez on the 1st July. 180. Mr. E. J. Powell, of His Majesty’s Office of Works, left for the United Kingdom on the 4th July. 181. Dr. F. Dowdeswell arrived on the 1st July on a visit on his way from London to Kenya, and left again for Port Sudan on the 8th. 182. The problem of destitute Takrunis, referred to in paragraph 142 of last month’s report, remains. 120 more West African destitutes presented them selves at the Chancery on the 20th, demanding repatriation, but were called off by their sheikhs. The collaboration of the Italian authorities in respect of Takrunis who can be proved to have come to this country via Massawa has been promised, and the Italian Legation here, now in charge of a clerk, is being approached.183. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during the month July was as follows : — On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 female, 1 child. Took refuge in July : 1 male, 1 female. Manumitted in July and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : 2 females, 1 child. On hand at the end of the month : nil.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL.

Ibn Saud remained in Mecca throughout the month except for a visit to Jedda from the 11th to the 13th April, in the course of which he twice received His Majesty’s Minister in formal audience. He appeared to be completely composed in spite of his preoccupations in the south. He opened a new session of the Legislative Council, a body of which very little had been heard for some time, on the 21st April. 68. The heir apparent remained in supreme command in the inland portion of the southern front. The Amir Feisal left early on the 15th April to assume the command in the littoral. Their younger brother, Muhammad, had ahead\ left for Riyadh to lead further troops from Nejd. A still younger brother. Khalid, was appointed Acting President of the Council and Acting Minister of the Interior in place of Feisal. 69. A story of Ibn Saud in merry monarch mood is worth recording. It is vouched for by Mr. Philby, who was present. While in Jedda the King was dining with his courtiers. The company included Ahmed Banaja, a notable of Jedda, who was Minister of Finance under the Hashimite regime, and Sheikh Ali Taha, that pale shadow who combines the functions of Assistant Governor with those of Assistant Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Banaja is a man so noted for his pusillanimity that it is a subject of chaff. The King asked him whether there was anyone present whom he could face up to. Banaja, after some hesitation, said he thought he could take on Ali Taha. The company thought he had chosen well, when the King ordered pistols for two and bade the couple to set to with them. But, to the surprise of all, it was Ali Taha who advanced boldly, while Banaja took cover behind the King s chair, until His Majesty called the duel off. 70. ' The effective direction of foreign affairs was in the hands of the King’s political secretary, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, during the first half of the month. His official appointment as Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs was notified to the foreign missions on the 31st March, but on the 16th April Fuad Bey Hamza returned from Abha and on the 18th April he resumed his duties at Mecca, apparently as Acting Minister. 71. The war with the Yemen overshadowed every other interest during the whole of April. No internal events of any consequence came to the notice or the Legation, nor were there any striking developments in the financial and economic domains. The following items may be noted :— {a) The position in regard to the proposed oil concession for the Koweit neutral zone remained indeterminate throughout the month. It [106 gg—1] b2 should have been made clearer in paragraph 48 {a) of the last report that, although M. Ydlibi delayed somewhat his departure from Jedda. he left without having made definite arrangements in connexion with that or his other schemes. He had got to the length of proposing definite financial terms for the prospective neutral zone concession, but the Government have been tied up in knots over the position as legalds the Sheikh of Koweit’s joint interest and apparently oveil their own position in regard to the preferential right they gave last } ear to the Standard Oil Company of California. (b) Ine only known development in connexion with the possible exploitation m oil in the Northern Hejaz, in which M. Ydlibi and his friends are rvi 0 i, nterested ’ that Dr. Nomland, the geologist of the Standard Uil Company of California, completed his inspection of the area 'f ee 48 M of the last report), and returned to Jedda about tne Idth April He is thought not to have been greatly impressed. inG v i Port Sudan en route for Eastern Arabia on the loth April. {c) The Minister of Finance wrote to M. Ydlibi on the 26th April authorising him to form a syndicate in connexion with his bank scheme see paragraph 48 (a) of the last report), and promising to consider any proposals that might be put forward. The letter was quite non-committal. (d) Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. are in treaty with the Government tor a new contract to supply benzine. There has been talk for some time of Mr. Philby getting a monopoly of import for ■ a up eh (Limited), but the fate up to date of his monopoly for cars of last year is hardly likely to encourage the Government to'entertain ms proposals. \ e ) The Banque Misr (paragraph 48 (e) of last report) is understood to be pin suing its projects, but the only outward manifestation has been the continued employment of the steamship Zem Zem in the pilgrimage trade. A reception was held on board on the 22nd April under the joint auspices of the agents and the Egyptian consul. The Governor of Jedda was the guest of honour and the crowd was enoimous, though other shipping agents were conspicuous by their absence, and the British and Italian were the only forei-n^ repre sentatives to attend. J e II. Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. r m oJ 2 v J; bn Sf !rc has won hands down in the first round of his war with the imam Yahya. I here are two main armies, inland and in the littoral region 15* ADrif^tbfn^f Yr Har adh, where the last fort fell about” the oth April then Medi, the defence of which was abandoned on the 25th April area™ Landis occupied next day. Various fighting is reported from this dlS * c ’ ai m uninterrupted success in this, and appear to have enlisted the support of the tribes along the Yemen coast. When H.M.S. Penzance visited Medi on the 2Jth--28th April (see below) it was thought unlikely that -uhayva would oe defended. The Amir Feisal was said to have 15 000 men under his command and to be expecting 10,000 more from Jizan. The accounts operations mland are difficult to follow owing to the uncertainty of the iIia pG” ° f h&lt; ’ Pf &lt; ;f S , nam ?f. It appears, however, from the communiques that the eastern arm\ had, by mid-April, occupied important positions, was operating in the country north-west and north-east of Saada, and had cut off Najran except on the south, [here has been no further news from the country close to Saada’ bU u t u £ aimerf that , the l emenis were dr iven out of Najran on the 21st April p n hi h K d u been P u . rsued , to the onl ,V open pass leading to Wayla. Little has been published regarding the mountain area of the Beni Malik,' &amp;c It was stated however on the 20th April that loyal tribes had got the upper hand in the area which the Yemenis had occupied, and that Abdul Wahhab al-Idrisi’s forces had been severely defeated inland from Abu Arish. n I 3 ' A he tW0 rule : rs . hav &lt;; continued to send each other long telegrams m baud keeps on insisting that he cannot stay his hand until the Imam has effectively complied with three demands now crystallised as follows : Evacuation3 of Nairan; withdrawal from the mountain area, release of a,ll hostages taken there and cessation of interference therein; surrender of the Idnsis tne imam has gone on expressing complete readiness to comply, asking t a os should be suspended, and pressing Ibn Saud to receive at Mecca e . of the late Yemeni delegation at Abha, with a view to fne S otiat ^ s t The King has consented to receive this gentleman, Abdullah-al-Wazir, subject ^,o a warning that his visit can make no difference until the demands are compile with. It is understood that in a telegram of the 29th April, not ve pu is e , the Imam claimed to have fulfilled the condition in regard to Najran, which he has certainly evacuated under pressure, and asked for ten days m which to fulfil the other two. On the 30th April Abdullah-al-Wazir arrived in Mecca. 74 The war has caused much scandal among outside Moslems and Arabs. Various groups and individuals in Egypt and elsewhere have made belated efforts at mediation. The most active step m this direction has been the formation of a delegation consisting of Haj Amm Husaym, president ot the Supreme Moslem Council in Palestine; the well-known Arab leader ol Druse origin, the Amir Shakib Arslan; Hashim Bey-al-Atasi, a well-known Syrian politician; and Muhammad Ali Pasha Allouba, an Egyptian ex-Mmister and lawyer. These gentlemen arrived in Jedda on the 16th April. They were given an official reception, and have been greatly feted in Mecca, but thev make no difference. They do not seem to have any intention of going on to Sana. 75 It was reported on the 27th April that there were some thirty-six British families at Medi, where the situation still appeared to outside observers to be obscure. Arrangements were made for H.M.S. Penzance to Y 1 ® 1 ^ ^ , P^ ace with the sole object of reassuring and, if necessary, assisting British subjects. It was impossible to warn the Saudi Government before her arrival on the evening of the 28th April, and the Amir Feisal, who had in fact taken possession of Medi two davs earlier, protested. Ibn Saud felt injured by this visit all the more so as he had promised that British persons and interests would be fully safeguarded in any place his forces might occupy. On the 30th April Sir Andrew Ryan expressed surprise at the attitude which the Amir reisal had taken up, and there ensued a friendly exchange of views and explanations between him and Fuad Bey Hamza. It is hoped that this will have cleared the air. 76. A portion of the long announced Saudi Green Book on the Saudi-Yemen dispute was published in the Mecca Umm-al-Qurci on the 27th April, and the whole book appeared on the 29th. 77. For some time past His Majesty’s Government have been considering the question of boundaries in the east of Ibn Sand’s dominions, with special reference to the position in regard to Qatar. Among the reasons which have invested this question with new importance are the grant of the Hasa oil concession to the Standard Oil Company of California last year, uncertainty as to the territorial extension given to it by the Saudi Government, the danger of the American interests finding means to establish themselves in Qatar, and the dubious attitude of the Sheikh of Qatar, who appears, despite his treaty with His Majesty’s Government, to have come to some sort of terms with Ibn Saud. His Majesty’s Government have decided to take their stand on treaty arrange ments made between them and the Turkish Government in 1913 and 1914. The effect of these was to determine the limits of Turkish sovereignty by a “ blue line ” running down south from a point on the west coast of the Gulf of Bahrein to parallel 20 degrees N., and a violet line thence to a place in the Aden Protectorate. It^ does not necessarily follow that the sovereignty of the Sheikh of Qatar and the other trucial rulers extends up to this boundary, which must be regarded as constituting a British sphere of influence^ This view, though strong in law, is unlikely to appeal to Ibn 8&gt;aud, who has in fact exerted influence, if not authority, as well, east of the blue line. Any discussion with him might perhaps have been postponed, had^ not the I nited States Government made enquiries which caused His Majesty’s Government to explain to them their view of the effect of the Anglo-Turkish conventions. This helped to decide the question of whether the views of His Majesty’s Government should be conveyed to Ibn Saud, and afforded a means by which this could be done with the minimum appearance of provocation. On the 28th April His Majesty’s Minister, acting under carefully concerted instructions, addressed a note to the Saudi Government informing them, as a matter of courtesy, of the enquiry by the United States Government, and the reply which had been returned. [106 gg—1] b 278. There has been no development of importance in connexion with Ibn Sand’s other frontiers. It may be noted, however, that one of the moie notable visitors to the Hejaz for the pilgrimage was Fawwaz-bm-Shalan, grandson of and prospective successor to the famous Nuri of that ilk. It appeals that he sat on the King’s left at the pilgrimage banquet on the 22nd March (see paragraph 50 of the last report). It has been stated in the foreign Arabic pres|_^ that his tribe, the Ruwalla, and other Syrian tribes have promised support Ibn Saud on the northern side. 79. (Reference paragraph 52.) Ibn Saud has, however, manifested continued perturbation over the alleged machinations of plotters in adjoining countries. On the 10th April Sheikh Yusuf Yasin brought a message from him to Sir Andrew Ryan to the effect that he believed intrigues to be proceeding between King Ghazi, the Amir Abdullah, other Shereefs, and the Amir Shakir, to foment insurrection in Saudi Arabia, to which Sir Andrew Ryan was able to return a generally reassuring reply to Fuad Bey Hamza on the 21st April; the latter on that occasion produced a further story of activities on the part of a son of Hamid-bin-Rifada near Aqaba, about which enquiries were still proceeding at the end of the month. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 80. Excellent relations have continued to prevail between the British Legation and the Saudi Government. The question of the Indian Government dispensary has been discussed several times, and with some vigour, as Sheikh Yusuf Yasin rejected outright the possible settlement mentioned in paragraph 53 of the last report. A conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 30th April gave more promise of an eventual solution. 81. A Royal Air Force “Victoria” aeroplane made a forced landing on Saudi territory west of Jinnah Island on the 17th April, and stuck in the sand. The matter was at once notified to the Saudi Government with an apology for the unintentional violation of their territory and a request for assistance. The apology was verbally accepted and the local authorities instructed to help; the Amir of Jubail, however, although most helpful, apparently misunderstood his instructions and detained the machine for two days, necessitating a further representation to the Government, before he would allow it to leave. The aeroplane finally left Saudi territory and reached Bahrein on the 23rd April; an expression of thanks for their assistance was subsequently conveyed to the Saudi Government. 82. All friendliness notwithstanding, Ibn Saud has conceived some apprehension as to the state of his relations with His Majesty’s Government owing to the cumulative effect on his mind of various matters mentioned elsewhere in this report, like the “ blue line note ” mentioned in paragraph 77, and some of older date like the rapprochement between Great Britain and the Yemen. There is no foundation for his fear that the fundamental policy of friendship towards him has altered, although somewhat difficult questions call for solution. 83. The new Italian Charge d’Affaires presented his credentials at the Jedda branch of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 11th April, and was received the same morning by the King in the course of the usual series of audiences to foreign representatives. This procedure marked the difference between his status and that of the Persian Minister, who presented his letters to the King the same day. 84. Developments in the south have exacerbated the suspicion with which the Saudi Government view Italian policy in the Red Sea. It is very obviously pro-imam, though not incorrect vis-d-vis Ibn Saud. On the 22nd April the Italian Charge paid his first visit to Fuad Bey Hamza, and urged on behalf of his Government a peaceful settlement between the two rulers. 85. The Saudi Government are also somewhat suspicious of Egypt. The Egyptian consul is perhaps not the ideal person to improve relations. At the Zem Zem reception on the 22nd April (see paragraph 71 (e) above), he made a speech which appeared to contrast the new perfection of the Egyptian arrange ments for transporting pilgrims by sea with the still imperfect arrangements for their comfort in the Hejaz. His remarks do not seem, however, to have been as pointed as they were reported in certain quarters to have been.5 86. (Reference paragraph 56.) The ratifications of the Saudi-Afghanistan Treaty of the 5th May, 1932, were eventually exchanged in Mecca on the 1st April, and the treaty itself was published in the Mecca newspaper Umm-al-Qura of the 18th April. Despite the Saudi attitude towards its being signed in Mecca (see paragraph 211 of the Jedda report for May-June 1932), it |Vas found to contain an express provision for exchange of ratifications in Mecca, (Bid it is possible that their disinclination to stand by this clause was responsible for the delay in exchanging the ratifications. 87. There is nothing else to record in this chapter, except that the Turkish Charge went on leave, greatly rejoicing, on the 6th April. IV.— Miscellaneous. 88. The Commissioner of Port Sudan and Mrs. Red fern stayed at the Legation from the 12th to the 16th April. Mr. Redfern’s visit afforded a useful opportunity for discussing various matters of common interest, notably certain questions connected with the scheme, which has come into operation this year, for the better regulation of the pilgrimage from Nigeria. He was presented to the King on the 13th April. 89. The Dutch engineer, M. Flieringa, who was one of the recent Dutch mission to the Yemen (paragraph 55 of the last report), outstayed his companions to make further researches in that country, including a visit to fealif. He eventually got back to Jedda and left for Holland on the 6th April. M. Jacobs, who has for several years ably managed the “Dutch Bank, ’ left Jedda for good on the 20th April, giving place to a M. Entrop. Mr. J. A. Smith, the managing director of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey’s business in the Sudan, visited Jedda from the 23rd to the 25th April. Mr. Bates, the ornithologist (paragraph 40 of the report for February), left on the 25th April, after haying collected, in collaboration with Mr. Philby, some 300 specimens of Hejazi birds, representing something like 120 species. 90. The worst dust-storm of recent years raged in and around Jedda, both by land and sea, on the 3rd April. Ships were unable to enter the port that day and the climatic conditions ashore were horrible. Two similar, but less unpleasant, days followed. On the third day, the 5th April, a great fire ravaged the African village outside the town, destroying in a few hours an estimated number of some 160 compounds each containing a number of huts. Many British subjects and protected persons were affected, but there was no loss of British life. The Saudi Government are always unsympathetic towards these poor, though industrious, Takrunis, as they are called. They have seemed inclined to push to oppressive lengths measures, legitimate in themselves, to restrict rebuilding close to the town walls. 91. The dispersal of the pilgrimage proceeded on normal lines throughout the month. As always, minor problems have arisen, but they have not presented serious difficulty. The Alexandria Quarantine Board declared the returning pilgrimage clean on the 9th April. 92. It looked at one moment as though the thirty-three motor pilgrims from India (paragraph 63 of the last report) might become a burden on the British Legation, as the pilgrims ‘ ‘ were very unwilling ’ ’ to trust themselves again to the° contractors who had let them down so badly. Steps were taken to impress on the Saudi Government the view that they should deal with the matter, and it seems to have been adjusted somehow. The annual problem of ordinary destitutes remains. 93. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during the month was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male, 2 females, 1 child. Took refuge in April: 4 males, 1 female, 1 child. Manumitted in April and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. Returned to Ibn Saud (see below) : 1 male. On hand at the end of the month : 4 males, 3 females, 2 children. 94. A slave undoubtedly belonging to the King’s household took refuge on the 11th April. This threatened to create a very difficult question, as the6 King still holds that he came to an oral understanding with Sir G. Clayton in 1927 that the Legation right of manumission should not be exercised in regard to his personal slaves and soldiers, while His Majesty’s Government have, since 1931, refused to admit the proved existence of such an understanding. On this occasion it was possible to arrange a friendly deal, without prejudice to principles, under which the slave was returned to be manumitted by the King after an interval sufficient to save His Majesty’s face, and to be then held the disposal of the Legation. A guarantee of good treatment during the interval was obtained. 95. The Legation is still dealing with the very unusual case of a married couple with a child, who took refuge as slaves on the 29th March, but whom the authorities state to be free-born Moslems, the children by slave women of two brothers belonging to a Shereefian family. r* 1&amp;NDt-X£0 Tn anj further cominunication on this subject, please quote 6 ( v lVs\i.i and address —nof to any person bu name, but to— ^ • “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

Ibn Saud left Riyadh on the 16th March and arrived in Mecca for the pilgrimage on the 20th March. He was reported at the end of the month to be very nervous for his personal safety, and to have taken unusual precautions at pilgrimage time to ensure it. The heir apparent remained in command in the south. His brother, the Amir Feisal, less mobile than he had been, seems to have spent the month in Mecca. Fuad Bey Hamza was certainly at Abha and/or Khamis Musheyt during the greater part of the month, though he may have left for Mecca before it actually ended. His brother Taufiq, who acts as private secretary in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was used for messages to the Legation, except on two occasions, when diplomatic business was conducted with the Minister of Finance and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin respectively. The latter had, as usual, returned from Riyadh with the King, who rarely releases him from personal attendance. 46. The Saudi-Yemen situation and the pilgrimage, which will be dealt with below, overshadowed all other interests during March. Such internal developments as are worth recording were for the most part connected with the former. Military activity continued. The Saudi motor craft ran to and fro between Jedda and Jizan. A fire broke out on board one on its way south and caused, according to the official account, six deaths. 47. The financial situation remained unchanged. Its most remarkable recent feature has been that, while money is still short, the Saudi Government / seems to have become more punctilious in the matter of payments in respect of current transactions, even when the goods have been delivered. They have evidently realised that this is essential im cases where they may want to place further orders. 48. The following items of financial and economic interest may be noted : (a) Huseyn-al-Awayni returned to Jedda on the 4th March and was followed by Abdul-Ghani Ydlibi on the 11th March (paragraph 29 (h) of the February report). Mr. Ydlibi called on His Majesty’s Minister on the 17th March, a compleat, though unappetising, Briton. He expressed the confident belief that he would get the Koweit Neutral Zone Oil Concession, so far as Ibn Saud was concerned, and a concession for oil in the Northern Hejaz on the 21st March. He described also an entirely new bank scheme, which he hoped to put through and which he said had the approval of the Minister of Finance. The plan was to create a bank the capital of which would be subscribed equally, or almost equally, by a British bank and the Saudi Government. This capital of £1 million sterling would be applied to the purchase of War Loan, to be2 deposited in London as cover for a note issue on a sterling basis. The new bank would have privilege of issue, the note issue would be a forced currency, the bank and the Government would divide the profits and the bank would do ordinary banking business as well. If the Saudi Government would not put up their share of the capital, Mr. Ydlibi’s friends would lend them the money, but there would be no other loan transaction. Mr. Ydlibi had not yet fixed his Britmlu bank, but anticipated no difficulty as the business would be as safe as hou^Y His hopes of putting his schemes through in time to leave Jedda on the 21st March were disappointed; he left on the 23rd March. (b) Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) put through on the 21st March a contract to supply the Government with 2 million rounds of cartridges. This deal was projected last June (paragraph 130 of report for that month), but languished until, at last, the Ministry of Finance concluded it with all speed. (c) Dr. Nomland, of the Standard Oil Company of California (paragraph 39 of the February report), left for Yanbu on the 22nd March, presumably to assess the oil possibilities of the littoral north of that port. The company imported an aeroplane into Hasa for survey work early in March. They were understood at the end of the month to have obtained, not without difficulty, permission to bring it into use. The survey appears to be planned on an ambitious scale. (d) The Mecca press boomed the formation of an “Arabian Export Company with a capital of £5,000 gold in £5 shares. The list of subscribers includes all the best people in native official and commercial life, headed by the Amir Feisal, who took up ten shares. (e) The Banque Misr group have opened offices in Jedda, with a sign which relates only to the agency for their ships, one of which, the Zemzem (ex-Bibby Leicestershire), made three voyages with pilgrims from Egypt. The offices are situated in a new house, in front of the Soviet Legation, to which it was formerly intended to serve as an annex. II. —Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 49. The evolution of the Saudi-Yemen situation justified the prognostication o± some that the King was only waiting to make sure of his pilgrims to force the pace with the Imam. On the 17th March Taufiq Bey Hamza intimated to Sir Andiew Ryan that the Amir Feisal was doubtful as to whether peace would be preserved. On the 22nd March he brought a formal message from the Amu to the effect that neither the meetings of delegates at Abha nor further direct correspondence between the King and the Imam had produced any result and that the King had ordered his troops to advance, with a view to the recovery ° f j P^ 10 ^ 1 ° f his territor y in th e Faifa-Beni Malik area which had been invaded by Abdul Wahhab-al-Idnsi with Yemeni forces. His Majesty had left the door open for peace, but, if no satisfactory communication were received from the Imam by the time the heir apparent reached the frontier, it might be necessary to cross it. Two days later Sheikh Yusuf Yasin called and’ descanted at length on the course of events and the faithlessness of the Imam. On both occasions Sir Andrew Ryan urged prudence, with special reference to the danger of ci eating an ineparable situation by entering admittedly Yemeni territory 5°. The advance began on the 20th March. The Amir Saud himself set out on the 22nd March. The Kmg*made a speech at his annual dinner for notable pilgrims that evening, in which he vigorously defended his past proceedings and the present action, which had been thrust on him by a man whmn he had regarded as his dearest friend. Everything that was published m the Umm-al-Qura next day and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said to Sir Andrew Rvan next day seemed to indicate that the Saudi Government regarded themselves as committed to war, but a communique published on the 30th March reported that the King was still pursuing his efforts for peace in correspondenc e P with the Imam and added that no armed conflict had yet occurred. This was probablv true, despite rumours in Mecca of fighting and Saudi reverses. There was no news up to the end of the month of any Saudi advance into Najran or towards Medi. J 51. Nothing of importance was reported in connexion with Ibn Saud’s relations with his other neighbours. His Majesty’s Government considered3 another plan for bringing about the projected meeting between Ibn Baud and the Amir of Transjordan in or near Jedda, but for many reasons the whole matter is likely to be shelved indefinitely. The Saudi Government took in good part the accidental violation of their territory by an R.A.F. aeroplane from Transjordan, an apology for which was conveyed through the Legation in J^bruary (paragraph 36 of the last report). ^ 52. On the 11th March Sir Andrew Ryan conveyed privately to the Minister of Finance the result of enquiries regarding the alleged plot mentioned in paragraph 34 of the last report. It was generally reassuring. Taufiq Bey Hamza reverted to the subject on the 17th March in an anxious strain, but his further information was too imprecise to require any urgent action. HI .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 53. Relations between the British Legation and the Saudi Government continued to be most amicable except for one breeze. For a long time past the Saudi Director-General of Public Health has been trying to establish control over the Government of India medical service attached to the Legation, especially as regards the branch dispensary which is opened annually at Mecca at pilgrimage time. The director-general intensified his efforts this year to such an extent that the Legation was forced to take strong action, culminating in a direct telegram sent to the King at Riyadh on the 13th March. This put an end to the trouble for the time being, but the matter is somewhat delicate as the medical service occupies a position which would be anomalous in a less primitive country. A possible settlement, which would give some measure of satisfaction to the Saudi Government, without impairing the freedom and utility of the service, is under consideration. 54. The new Italian Charge d’Affaires, M. Persico (paragraph 281 of the I report for December), arrived in Jedda on the 25th March. He comes direct from a post in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Rome, which he held for a / year after a career mostly spent in Russia, with variations in Istanbul and Cairo. ( He seems amiable, but is unenthusiastic about Jedda. He does not appear to : have any special knowledge of Arabian affairs. 55. The Netherlands mission (paragraph 38 of last report) return from Sana on the 5th March. The Dutch doctor, who had practised in Jedda for a yeai under the auspices of the Legation and the Dutch commercial houses and had accompanied M. Adriaanse to Sana, left for good a few days after their return. 56. It was stated in the press on the 30th March that the ratifications of \ the Saudi-Afghan treaty of the 5th May, 1932, were to be exchanged next day, \ Afghanistan being represented by the Minister in Cairo, who comes on pilgrimage every year. Confirmation is awaited. ' n ■ 57. The humour of the month was provided by the United States Minister in Angora, who planned a visit to Ibn Saud at Riyadh in the course of a trip to Muscat and back. The Minister reckoned without his host, who intimated politely that he was just off to the Hejaz, advanced the date of his departure, and then postponed it again, owing to urgent business, until the day on -which he was originally understood to have intended to start. This adds a new formula to Ibn Baud’s repertory of retorts courteous to gate-crashers in the interior of Arabia. 58. The Saudi Arab Government received a telegram from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Manchukuo on the occasion of the coronation of the new Emperor of that State and asked the advice of His Majesty’s Government, through both this Legation and their Minister in London, as to the attitude they should adopt. They were informed in reply that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government is determined by the resolution adopted by the Assembly of the League of Nations on the 24th February, 1933, under which members of the League were to continue not to accord recognition. 59. There is little else to record under this head except that the new Persian Minister held his first reception in Jedda on the 15th March, in honour of the Shah’s birthday, and did it very well. Champagne flowed freely in that Moslem house, but the Governor of Jedda had first been polished off at a special reception4 IV .—M iscellaneous. 60. H.M.S. Penzance, Commander R. H. Bevan, R.N., visited Jedda, as is usual at pilgrimage time, and stayed from the 22nd to the 29th March. She took part on the 26th March in the traditional regatta, now always held primarily for the pilgrimage fleet at Haj time. Although the tradition has be'~ interrupted, the regatta is known to date from before 1860, when it used to be held on Queen Victoria’s birthday. 61. Pilgrimage day fell on the 25th March. The assemblage was not quite as large as had latterly been hoped, principally because the last shipments from India fell short of expectations. The Saudi Government estimate the total number of people of all origins gathered at Arafat at 60,000. Fifty thousand is probably nearer the mark. The total number of overseas pilgrims, i.e., those landed at Jedda and Yanbu, is officially put at 25,291. This total includes pilgrims embarked in India to the number of 9,937, among whom the number of British Indians was 7,012. 62. The arrangements for the pilgrimage worked normally. Health conditions were excellent. By the 31st March the Saudi Government declared the pilgrimage clean, and the Legation had satisfied itself that this verdict could be accepted provisionally, pending the examination of pilgrims returning northward at Tor. 63. Nine Moslem ratings of H.M.S. Penzance made the pilgrimage during her visit. Yet another Moslem Englishwoman attempted to follow the example given by Lady Evelyn Cobbold last year.f 1 ) The usual number of oriental notables attended, including the Nigerian Amir of Muri, C.B.E., and one of India’s brighter modern women. A party of Indian pilgrims from Delhi tried out the overland motor route travelling via Koweit and Riyadh. They arrived two days late. The King entertained some 600 guests at the banquet already mentioned in paragraph 50, but he did not find room for the Indian vice-consul. 64. Captain H. C. Armstrong’s long-awaited book on Ibn Saud (para graph 102 of the report for May 1933) appeared in London in March under the title Lord of Arabia, Ibn Saud. It does not yet seem to have reached Jedda. The reviewers at home seem to be more impressed by the pace of its staccato sentences than by its other qualities. 65. The Umm-al-Qura on the 2nd February and the 16th February published descriptions of an ancient manuscript entitled History of Medina and its Governors which was recently unearthed in the Al-Mazhariyya Library of Medina and covered a period of some thirty years in the third century of the Hejira. 66. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in March was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 female. Took refuge in March : 2 males, 1 female, 1 child. Manumitted in March and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : 1 male, 2 females, 1 child. (!) But received permission too late to carry out her intention. OTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT No. 60. Confidential.) ■Ur, Jedda, March 5, 1934. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for February 1934. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for 28. The month of February was singularly uneventful, except for the pre parations for possible war with the Yemen, which were pursued steadily but not ostentatiously. The King remained in Nejd. The heir apparent was at his headquarters at Khamis Musheyt, not far from Abha. The Amir Feisal went off to the country north-east of Medina, ostensibly to take the air and hunt, more probably to inspect the camel parks in that area and to stimulate military preparations in the Northern Hejaz. He came to Jedda on the 18th February and stayed four days. Fuad Bey Hamza reached Abha early in the month and remained there or in that part of the world during the remainder of it. 29. There were no important developments in the economical and financial sphere, but the following matters deserve mention : — (a) The Government displayed great eagerness to get delivery of the motor lorries already contracted for, as soon as the importers could assemble them. They placed a new contract with Ford’s for fifty more. (h) Little was heard in Jedda about oil. Huseyn-al-Awayni (paragraphs 5 and 6 of the January report) called on Sir Andrew Ryan on the 8th February and announced that he was leaving for Egypt on the following day. He hoped to meet Mr. Ydlibi there, and spoke of a possible visit of the latter to Jedda when he himself came back in March. Dr. Nomland, the assistant chief geologist of the Standard Oil Company of California, arrived in Jedda on the 21st February. I having travelled overland from Hasa, and stayed two or three days in \Riyadh. 3 Government displayed great anxiety to receive a reply to the enquiries they had addressed to His Majesty’s Government regarding the standing of the Hejaz Development Corporation (Limited) (para graph 7 of the January report). The Minister of Finance came in person to see Sir Andrew Ryan on the 7th February, and was given on the 11th February a guarded warning against placing reliance on the corporation. Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid left Jedda on the 21st February, having, so far as is known, settled nothing. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 30. The quarrel with the Yemen remained intact. On the 2nd February an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was sent post haste to Jedda to show [56 ee—1] EASTERN (Arabia). March 28, 1934.

I .—Internal Affairs.i f Sir Andrew Kyan a number of telegrams that had passed between the King and the Imam, polite but stinging, especially the last, which the King had sent two days earlier. Nevertheless, both rulers were playing the game of expecting peace from the projected conference at Abha, despite all disagreeableness on the frontier. A wave of optimism swept over interested circles outside haudi Arabia^, as a result of a statement circulated by the Saudi Government themselves through its representatives in London and Cairo about the 7th February. It described the situation in terms which were read as meaning that peace by negotiation was assured. One variant appeared in the Times of the 8th February, and the foreign reaction to it was best illustrated by a leading article in the same paper on the 9th February, headed “ Arabia Still Fortunate.” 31 The Minister of Finance sang a different tune in conversation with Sn Andrew Ryan on the 11th February, when he scouted the idea that the conterence could produce a settlement. A few days later the \ emeni delegates, aftei some delay, reached Abha, but up to the end of the month no news had reached Jedda, or even Mecca, it would appear, of the progress of the negotiations. 32. It is possible that both rulers are too averse from war to let the conference end in such a rupture as would make it unavoidable. Nevertheless, it would be rash to assume that the war cloud has been dissolved As already stated, the Saudi militarv preparations continued during the month. there is some reason to believe that the position in the mountainous region over against Saada was easier. There is also some reason to suppose that Ibn baud s attitude m regard to Nairan has, if anything, stiffened. 33. The report that the Iraqi Government had appointed a permanent Charge d’Affaires to Jedda was confirmed. Their choice has fallen on one Seyyid Kamil-el-Gaylani, the brother of a former Prime Minister, whose obstinacy but not abilities' he is reported to share. The news that Dr. Abdullah Damluji, formerly Director-General for Foreign Affairs to Ibn Saud, has again become Foreign Minister in Bagdad, is unlikely to impress Saudi opinion favourably. 34. On the 18th February the Minister of Finance informed Sir Andrew Rvan very secretly on behall of the King that His Majesty had heaid of a plot being hatched by ex-King Ali and the Amir of Transjordan to make common cause with the Imam against him. This kind of scare is familiar at times of stress and there is no reason to take the present one seriously. . . 35 On the 15th February the Legation communicated to the Minister tor Foreign Affairs a new proposal by His Majesty’s Government regarding arrange ments for the projected meeting between Ibn Saud and the Amir of 1 ransjordan (see paragraph 249 of the November report). It was hoped that the meeting might take place on board a cruiser, which will be passing through the Red Sea about the 19th May next, and could bring the Amir and the High Commissioner to a spot outside territorial waters off Wejh. On the 21st February the Amir Feisal took the very unusual course of visiting the branch of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Jedda, for the express purpose of receiving Sir Andrew Ryan and explaining in the nicest possible manner the reasons which would make it impossible for Ibn Saud to proceed overland to Wejh. The King suggested that, unless he could be embarked in the cruiser at Jedda, the matter had better be postponed. - . . _ 36. The Legation, at the instance of His Majesty’s Hmh Commissioner tor Transjordan, sent a note of explanation and apology to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in connexion with the accidental violation of Saudi territory on the 20th February by a R.A.F. aeroplane proceeding to Mudawwara, which missed its destination and'flew 15 miles to the south before the mistake was realised. XU .—Relations with Powers Outside Arabia. 37. The absence of Fuad Bey has almost completely suspended diplomatic business between the British legation and the Saudi Government, excepting the normal routine of notes and the discussion of some special subjects already mentioned, which have given rise to conversations with the Minister of Finance, and on one occasion with the Amir Feisal. Such few other matters as it was possible to deal with in personal discussion are of no general interest. 38. There is still less to be recorded as regards other Powers represented at Jedda. The Netherlands mission to the Yemen duly reached Sana, and had notreturned up to the end of the month. The new Persian Minister visited Mecca and Medina for the first time, but he is still awaiting the King's arrival in the Hejaz to present his letters. 39. The arrival of Dr. Nomland (see paragraph 29 (b) above) provided the occasion for an outing from Jedda so unusual that it is worth recording. Wit the permission and encouragement of the Minister of Finance, Mr. Philby took a party, in which he was the only Moslem, all the way to Sharaya, on the road trom Mecca inland, on the 20th February. It consisted of Mr. Lenahan, the standard Oil of California representative in Jedda, Mr. Bates, the ornithologist (para graph 24 of the January report), Mr. Gent, of the Ford Company, Lady Ryan and Mrs. Philby. Owing to the late arrival of Dr. Nomland, it was decided to stay the night at Sharaya, where the Minister of Finance himself appeared with tents, &amp;c., for the party. The romantic glamour of this red-letter night in the annals of European adventure in Arabia was enhanced by the singing ot the guards to the music of beaten petroleum cans. 40. Mr. Bates remained in Jedda throughout the month, and had by the end of it collected some 300 specimens of birds, comprising nearly 100 distinct varieties, some extremely rare. Mr. Gent was in Jedda on the business of the Ford Company (see paragraph 29 above), and left on the 28th February. Ihe same day there arrived Mr. D’Arcy Weatherbe, to stay a few days at the Legation and inter alia explore the possibilities of Jedda as a place for fishing, in which he is an expert. Mr. D. Black, of Gellatly, Hankey and Co., arrived on the 14th February to take over the management of their local branch from Mr. A. J. Warner, who has been in charge of it for some three years. . . 41. Mr. A. S. Calvert left Jedda on the 4th February, intending to visit the Transjordan desert, by arrangement between the various authorities concerned before proceeding on leave. • , , _ , . ^ , 42. Pilgrimage prospects continue to be distinctly better. Lalaat 1 asha Harb (paragraph 8 of the January report) abandoned a plan for bringing over 100 Egyptian notables on a trial trip to Medina in February, but he is still active m Egypt and it is understood that some 3.000 pilgrims may be expected from that country. There is no local confirmation of the statement in the Near East and India of the 15th February that arrangements have been made to bring some of them by air Persians are expected to be a good deal more numerous than in 1932 and 1933. The most important arrivals of British pilgrim ships in February were • 43. From India three ships carrying a total of 3,853 British Indians and 878 other pilgrims. From the Straits'Settlements two ships carrying a total On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Took refuge in February : 1 male, 1 female. Manumitted in February and repatriated : 1 male.

It was clear from luad Bey s state ment that the King had not committed himself, but Fuad Bey also represented His Majesty as being all for ensuring the British character of future enterprises. The whole delicate subject was referred to His Majesty s Government 7. Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid, who acted or professed to act tor the ex-Khedive in connexion with the State Bank project of last year, reappeare in Jedda on the 9th January. He was not entreated on his arrival as kindly as most concession-hunters, but he quickly got into touch with the Saudi Govern ment He now purports to represent a new company formed in London under the auspices of a firm called J. S. Bartholomew and the name of the He.iaz Development Corporation (Limited). He recited a list of imposing names ot magnates in the City of London, whose support it was hoped to enlist. Among them were Viscount Goschen, Lord Glenconner and Sir E. Mountain. Shedid sought a concession similar to that of last year, with provision for a smaller initial loan to be made up to the larger figure later, and probably with more emphasis on other concessions as a quid pro quo. In this case also fiuad Bey was instructed to consult Sir Andrew Ryan as to the standing of the corporation and the prospect of support from the magnates. , , 8. No important developments are reported at the Jedda end m connexion with Talaat Pasha Harb’s enterprises (paragraph 269 of the report tor December), but he is understood to be busy in Egypt, and to have taken, or to be in treaty, for a house now in course of construction here , t 9. A Polish professor named Wilniewczyc arrived about the 8th January and stayed a week or ten days with Mr. Philby. He c ‘?- me to make a further effort in connexion with the debt of £30,000 still outstanding in respect of arms, &amp;c., supplied to the Saudi Government by a Polish group m 1930 but to have discussed also the possibility of their supplying fuitiei arms, &amp;c., on a large scale. On credit, of course^ ^ , 10. The financial situation of the Saudi Government continues to be most nrecarious. Money seems to have been found to make certain payments to officials and the like in anticipation of the Id, but salaries are still heavily in arrears, and only the most urgent payments are made. When on the 10th January Sir Andrew Ryan followed up Mr. Calvert’s representations (paragraph 279 of the report for December) regarding the debts due to His Majesty s Government •md beueed Fuad Bey to consider most seriously the importance of satisfying their now very moderate demands, Fuad Bey said, under the King s instructions, that in view of the penury of the Treasury, His Majesty would have to consider divine it help out of his personal resources, if His Majesty s Government insisted. Did they, he caused Fuad Bey to ask, wish to put him m such a position ? Considering his relations with his Government, this attitude can only be considered disingenuous.3 * 11. There is little to be said about the general internal situation. Mention has been made above of restlessness at Taif. The situation in Asir has become so much a part of the Saudi-Yemen dispute that it can but be dealt with below. That situation naturally stimulates speculation as to the-future of the Saudi ^gime, but the country seems to be pretty well held. The Vmm-al-Qura of the oth January denied a rumour in the Egyptian press than Ibn Saud intended to place parts of his dominions, e.g., the Hejaz, under the supervision of a “ neutral ” Shereef, meaning, it was suggested, one of the branch whose head, Shereef Ali Haydar, now resides at Beirut. The King would have to be very far gone before he could conceivably contemplate such a step. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 12. The Saudi-Yemen situation dominated everything else in January. The improvement recorded in paragraph 275 of the report for December was not maintained. On the 9th January Fuad Bev told Sir Andrew Ryan that war had appeared imminent some days before, but tfiat the King had made a fresh gesture of conciliation by offering to let the question of Najran stand over until it could be discussed at the conference to be held to reduce to treaty form the agreements reached on other points. The Imam’s reply was, he said, awaited. He telephoned on the 16th January that this was still the position, but he confirmed a report of the previous day that the heir apparent had gone to the front. When this conversation took place the Umm-al-Qura of that morning had already published a very remarkable article, explaining that, although the Imam had telegraphed on the 9th January accepting the King’s proposals, the gravity of the earlier situation had decided the Government to send both the heir apparent and the Amir Feisal (the King’s son, not his cousin the Commander-in-chief at Abha) to the front at the head of forces from Nejd and the Hejaz. On receipt of the Imam’s telegram the despatch of the Amir Feisal was countermanded, but the heir apparent had already left and was, according to the Umm-al-Qura, out of reach of communication. 13. These facts, taken in conjunction with other indications, e.g., the hurried chartering of a Besse steamer to take troops to Jizan on the 16th January, revealed a very definite danger of hostilities, despite the apparent narrowing of the political issues. His Majesty’s Government decided to urge on Ibn Saud in express terms the dangers of the situation and the importance of avoiding an outbreak of war which might be the result of mere misunderstanding on each side of the intentions of the other. These representations were embodied in a personal letter addressed by Sir Andrew Ryan on the 23rd January to Fuad Bey, who arrived in Jedda just in time to receive it. His attitude in ensuing conversations, and still more the contents of his formal reply of the 28th January, written after reference to the King, disclosed more of the true situation than had been definitely known before. The Imam had, indeed, agreed to a conference ; so much so that Fuad Bey was about to proceed to Abha to meet a Yemeni delegate. But, Fuad Bey explained, the Imam’s actions were entirely at variance with his words, especially his actions or those of his subordinates in the mountains forming the backbone of Asir Tihama, i.e., the region north-west of Sada inhabited by the Beni Malik, the Abadil and the Ahl Faifa. In conversation Fuad Bey accused the Yemenis of having actually invaded this area, j and having thus produced the critical situation of the early days of January. ^ He represented the King as having pushed patience to the extreme limit by withdrawing his forces to avoid conflict. In his subsequent letter, however, the accusation was that the Imam’s intrigues, including the despatch into the area of Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi, had produced a revolt of the local tribes, who had expelled the Saudi Governors. Other intrigues among the Masariha, &amp;c., had made it necessary to advance the Saudi forces to Samta. The letter mentioned the risk of incidents and hinted at the possibility of hostilities if the Saudi Government were compelled to defend themselves against attack, though their intention was to await the outcome of the conference. 14. The heir apparent, accompanied by no less than five junior princes, arrived at Abha about the 24th January and took over the command. Fuad Bev left for the same destination on the 28th January. The Yemeni delegation was to have left Sana on the 25th January, but is reported as having delayed its [31 t—1] b 2T departure owing to changes in its composition. Ihe position at the end of the month, as seen from the north, may be summed up thus : (a) There had been no slackening in the Saudi military preparations. In addition to the troops embarked for Jizan on the Januaiy further forces had been shipped in the Government s three motol dhows on the 30th January. The Ateyba, under their chiet, Ibn Rubaiyan, had marched south from laif at some moment previous o the 24th January, when Fuad Bey informed Sir Andrew Ryan of this movement. i T u a n (b) There had been no fighting on the Asir Tihama front, and Ibn baud was still apparently leaving it to the local tribesmen to cope with any remaining Yemeni activity in Najran. The situation in the mountainous region between was very tense. It was not clear that the Imam had intervened directly in that area, but he had evidently fomented trouble there. There were indications that his object was not so much to obtain possession of the country of the Beni Malik, &amp;c., as to &lt;c neutralise ” it in the same way as it had already been proposed to neutralise Najran. , (c) A conference was definitely in prospect, the outcome of which seemed likely to decide the question of peace or war, unless war should break out earlier owing to the strained situation near the frontiei and the massing of forces there. 15. Nothing of importance happened in January on Ibn Sand’s other frontiers The practical arrangements for the working of the machinery contem plated in the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty had not yet been completed, and occasional complaints continue to reach the Legation in connexion with minoi matters. There is a press rumour that the Iraqi Government have appointed a Charge d’Affaires in Jedda, but the Legation has had no confirmation of this. Flags were flown on the 26th January in honour of the marriage of King Ghazi. 16. (Reference paragraph 225 of last year.) The Saut-al-Hejaz stated on the 8th January that the Iraqi Government were proposing to assign reasonable sums” for the opening up of the projected pilgrim road between Najaf and Medina, and that the completion of this project was expected within the next year. HI —Relations with Poivers outside Arabia. 17. Reference is made elsewhere to conversations between His Majesty’s Minister and Fuad Bey Hamza. All intercourse with the Saudi Government was extremelv amicable. Only two other subjects are worthy of special mention. Sir Andrew Ryan had drawn attention on the 29th Hecembei to a repoit fiom Koweit that three State prisoners at Riyadh, including Ibn Hithlayn and Ibn Lami, who had been surrendered to Ibn Saud under certain guarantees early in 1930, had been done to death. On the 9th January Fuad Bey conveyed to Sir Andrew Ryan the King s assurance that these two men were alive, and added, in reply to a question, that the third, the once-famous Sultan Ibn Bujad, was also alive. It seems probable that the prisoners were, in fact, removed some time ago to Hofuf, but when an enquiry about this was passed on to the King, he excused himself from disclosing their whereabouts. On the 24th January Sir Andrew Ryan spoke to Fuad Bey about two of the ad-Dabbagh conspirators to whose presence in India the Saudi Government had taken exception. He had just written to say that these two men, Tahir-ad-Uabbagh and one Sadiq, had been called upon to leave India. He now added orally that they might be expected to appear next in Iraq, a country the access to which could not be denied them by His Majesty’s Government. „ „ ^ . T 18. The Netherlands Chargd d’Affaires left for Sana on the 23rd January for the exchange of ratifications of the Netherlands-Yemen Treaty, which he signed during an earlier visit last year. M. Adriaanse took with him an engineer named Flieringa, who arrived from Holland on the 14th January; M. Andresen, one of the managers of International Agencies (Limited), an Anglo-Dutch concern, whose principal business is the agency of the British and Hutch Blue Funnel lines; a Hr. Hartman, who has practised medicine m Jedda for about a year under the auspices of the Netherlands Legation, International Agencies and the Hutch Bank; and an interpreter. Although this mission is not so imposingas its composition may suggest, its members are doubtless bent on exploring the possibilities of the Yemen for business purposes. Some have thought that, having regard to the Saudi-Yemen situation, the choice of the time of their journey from Jedda to Sana on non-urgent business was unhappy. 19. The new Persian representative, who transliterates his name jhammed Ali Khan Mogaddam, arrived on the 8th January, accompanied by a new secretary. He proves to be a full Minister. His outlook is modern and his French good. He promises to be an agreeable colleague. 20. The Egyptian consulate has been reinforced by a permanent medical officer, Dr. Aly Askar-el-Ghandour. He is to preside over the medical mission sent annually to the Hejaz for the pilgrimage and to conduct a dispensary in Jedda. 21. There is little to record about the other foreign missions in Jedda. Nothing more has been heard of the business on which the French Charge went to Riyadh in December. He and the Italian Charge lived in almost complete seclusion during the month. It is not known whether the latter has kept in touch with the Saudi Government in regard to Yemen affairs, but he has not of late sought or afforded any opportunity for discussion between him and the British Legation.(') Mr. Lenahan, the representative of the Standard Oil Company of California (paragraph 211 of the report for October), is understood to aspire to the position of United States consul. IV.— Miscellaneous. 22. H.M.S. Hastincjs visited Jedda from the 10th to the 14th January. This was the last appearance of the present senior naval officer, Captain C. S. Sandford, O.B.E., whose impending departure from the Red Sea will be regretted. As the Amir Feisal was in Jedda on the day of the arrival of Hastings, His Majesty’s Minister was able to present Captain Sandford that afternoon. 23. An American yacht, the Camargo of (?) Cincinnati, visited Jedda on the 11th January. Its wealthy owner, a Mr. Fleischman, was on board. One of his guests was said to be the mightiest fisherwoman in the States. But they liked Jedda so little, and left so quickly, that she left neither name nor story. 24. An elderly American ornithologist called Bates, who resides near Chelmsford after a life spent in South Africa, arrived in Jedda in January with some sort of credentials from the British Museum. An enthusiastic collector and student, he promises to add considerably to what is known of bird life in the coastal region around Jedda. He is staying with Mr. and Mrs. Philby, who now have so many guests that they have arranged a mess for them in their new home, the Green Palace. Mr. Philby has realised another of his dreams by establishing the exact longitude of Mecca. He claims to have upset the conclusions of a Royal Commission. Fortunately it was a Dutch one. 25. The Id was followed by stormy weather and a cold snap which lasted some days. The temperature indoors fell more than once to about 60 F. in the early morning. This doubtless kept up the spirit of Christmas cheer. Anyhow, the European community in Jedda has gone very, very gay. Ladies are still in short supply, but they go round like anything. It has become quite difficult to compose a dinner-party at a few days’ notice. Picnics, wireless auditions, private cinema shows, and all the apparatus of occidental civilisation, now compete with the rigours of life among the Wahhabis. The one American citizen, Mr. Lenahan, brings more than one man’s quota to this social revolution. The last evening of January witnessed the first real “ hot-dog ” party in the Hejaz. Sausage sandwiches by a moonlit sea were rated one of the happier results of the grant of the Hasa Oil Cgncession to an American group. 26. The outlook for the pilgrimage is rather brighter. The total of overseas pilgrims in 1934 may now be expected to exceed the figure for last year by some thousands, unless war with the Yemen should produce an adverse effect. The numbers of pilgrim ships and pilgrims for January were as follows :— From India: Three ships, bringing a total of 2,029 pilgrims. From Straits Settlements : One ship, bringing ninety pilgrims. ( T ) There is no definite news as to when the new Italian representative will arrive, but M. Tonci ■ hopes to w-et away in March.6 27. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in January was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male. Took refuge in January : 2 females. Manumitted in January and repatriated : 1 male and 1 female. 0^0- Locally manumitted : Nil. Left Legation voluntarily : 1 female. On hand at the end of the month : Nil. The slave woman who left voluntarily had fled from the household of the Amir Feisal. The case threatened to reopen the thorny question of Royal slaves. After His Majesty’s Minister had discussed the case with Fuad Bey and prepared a telegram asking for approval of an arrangement for her manumission by the Amir in agreement with the Legation, the young woman fled, having apparently found the slave quarters in the Legation less agreeable and life there more boring than what she was accustomed to.

Jedda, January 7, 1934. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda Report for December 1933. This report has been prepared by Mr. Calvert, who was still in charge of the Legation during nearly half of the period under review. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for January 1933. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for December 1933. I .—Internal Affairs. 263. Ibn Saud remained in Nejd during the month. From the Saudi press glimpses were obtained of him, early in December, indulging in the pleasures of the chase for ten days at A1 Washm, and later, on the 16th, reviewing at Riyadh a contingent of 10,000 soldiers destined for the Asir front (see para graph 274). 264. Amir Feisal left Mecca for Taif on the 15th, on affairs of State, and returned on the 22nd. His Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey Hamza, visited Jedda on several occasions during the month, and met His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires on the 1st and 10th. He left for Riyadh on the 11th, together with the French Charge d’Affaires, in circumstances which are described at paragraph 280 below, returning to Mecca on the 21st. He had business interviews with Sir Andrew Ryan on the 28th and 29th. 265. Fuad Bey’s brother, Taufiq Hamza, arrived here from Syria on the 10th December, and it was hoped, Fuad Bey informed Mr. Calvert in conversation on that day, to find him a billet in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He had already had a certain amount of experience there as secretary to Fuad Bey, and might be expected to prove useful in the Ministry, the reorganisation of which was now in contemplation. 266. There was a belated echo of the commotion over the designation in May last of Amir Saud as heir apparent (see paragraph 80) in the announcement towards the end of the month that, as from the 1st January, 1934, commemorative postage stamps would be on sale by the Saudi postal authorities. 267. (Reference paragraph 240.) Mr. K. S. Twitchell left Jedda for Port Sudan en route for Europe on the 3rd on leave, but whether he will return or not seems open to considerable doubt. 268. Mr. Philby returned from his unexpected business trip to Egypt on the 4th December (see paragraph 241) and appeared to have succeeded in per suading the Ford Motor Company to reconsider their previous refusal to grant him credit facilities to the extent of providing Sharqieh (Limited) with fiftv Ford cars on easy terms, to be supplied to the Saudi Government. Sharqieh (Limited) are still said to hold the monopoly for the import of tyres, but, according to one informant, that concession is likely to terminate at the end of the present Arabic year. Mr. Philby has imported a large quantity of tyres, of various makes, and was stated to be negotiating with Muhammad Sadiq, the Kino-'s chauffeur, with a view to taking over the latter’s stock of tyres held up in the Jedda Customs. [6 gg—2] B2 269. The aeroplane bringing Talaat Pasha Harb and three other members of the Egyptian commercial mission to this country (see paragiaphs an ) landed on the afternoon of the 3rd December, when Jedda turned out en masse to witness the spectacle. The mission were officially welcomed and were en ei ainec as guests of the Saudi Government for the period of their stay The aeroplane was a De Havilland Dragon, and was piloted by Mr G. J. Mahony of Mi||^ Airwork, S.A.E. Talaat Pasha spent a busy week in Jedda and Mecca, engagtTT both in business conferences and in undergoing a strenuous course ot baudi hospitality. He distributed largesse broadcast in the shape of samples ot goods, especially cheap textiles of Egyptian manufacture, and generously arranged tor large numbers of the local inhabitants of Jedda, where the aeroplane remame during the visit, to be taken for short joy-rides over the town. As tor the business objects of the visit, it was understood that the agency of the Banque M^sr’ as regards its purely banking business, was given for the time being to Messis. Gellatlv, Hankey and Co., although it is believed that the bank intends in due course to establish a branch of its own in this country. Local representation ot the recently purchased Egyptian pilgrim-ships was confided to Messis. Haji Abdullah Ali Ridha, but little precise information had. at the end of the month come to hand regarding the activities of the mission in organising the sale °f Egyptian products. It is believed that the question of the transport of pilgrims to this country by air was also raised, but the impression has been gathered ^Tat the attitude of the Saudi authorities on this subject was unpromising. mission left on the 10th by air for Yanbu, whence Talaat Pasha paid a short visit, by car, to Medina. The flight back to Egypt was resumed on the 13th, and the journey successfully accomplished the same day. 270. The increase in tonnage dues announced in July last (see paragraph 141), and which it was for a time hoped would remain unenforced, is now being levied on all shipping using the Saudi ports of Jedda, Yanbu, Rabigh and Wejh. The effect, in respect of Khedivial steamers, is to double the dues paid by that company, viz., from £3 gold to £6 gold at each port of call. 271. (Reference paragraph 173.) The supply of water to Jedda from the wells at Waziriya has again suffered a setback. Water continues to arrive and the flow is considered satisfactory, but nothing has been done, and to all appear ances is likely to be done, to renew at least part of the 7 miles of conduit from the wells to the town. It has now been established that the pipes in the section nearer to the town are not only rotten but are so full of the accumulated filth of ages that the water, reasonably pure at source, arrives in the town highly contaminated. Europeans, therefore, and even natives of the better sort, eschew it. Meanwhile, the indefatigable Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and the Waziriya Committee labour to extend the old Turkish conduit further back into the catch ment area in the foothills in order to increase the head of water. 272. On the 8th December the Umm-el-Qura announced that certain modifications in charges in respect of urgent telegraphic messages, both foreign and inland, were to be introduced in accordance with the decision of the Madrid International Telegraph Conference. The date of the introduction of these charges was not indicated. 273. (Reference paragraph 214.) The economic and financial situation of the country shows no improvement. In spite of determined efforts to reduce expenditure, efforts which have involved, among other things, default in respect of their foreign and internal debts, and non-payment of the salaries of Govern ment employees, the maintenance of large forces in Asir is proving a serious drain on the Saudi Exchequer. Trade is sadly reduced—large stocks are still held from 1932, and pilgrims are now less numerous and seem very largely to be drawn from the poorer classes. There is a temporary, buoyancy due to the approaching pilgrim season, but, unless numbers of pilgrims prove unexpectedly large, the ensuing period will witness an economic prostration in Saudi Arabia which may, indeed, be serious. 274. The military situation in Asir (reference paragraph 244) has more or less marked time during December. Reinforcements continued to be drafted south, but in smaller numbers, and it may be supposed that the bulk of Ibn Saud’s resources in men and warlike material had been mustered and strategically disposed by the end of the month. Some work on the lines of communication, viz., the road from Taif to Abha, via Qalat Bisha, has been undertaken and motor transport, it is claimed, can now traverse this length of road in five days. Themm 3 King reviewed, as stated above, a further division of troops, estimated in the press at 10,000 men, at Riyadh on the 16th December prior to their departure for the front. The tribes in Asir remained steady during the period. I he uneasiness expressed by Fuad Bey that, provoked by imamic intrigue, they might &lt;l ^ii e cipitate a conflict proved unfounded, but on the 10th Mr. Calvert, under ^instructions, expressed the hope of His Majesty’s Government that Ibn Sand, in his own interests, would make every effort to prevent the tribes from opening hostilities. There had been, according to Fuad Bey, a few cases of individual desertions to the Yemen, chiefly from the Beni Malik and the Abadil. The general situation will be further dealt with in paragraph 275 below, in connexion with Saudi relations with the Yemen. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 275. The sky between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen showed some signs of clearing during the month. Correspondence between the King and the Imam, which had been going on for some time (see paragraphs 245 and 246), continued, and Fuad Bey stated to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 10th that the Imam was prepared to give satisfaction over the “ minor ” point of the disposal of the Idrisi. As for Najran, the King had proposed, as his “ last word on the subject, that this district should be left as a neutral zone. No reply had since been received, but it was understood that Imamic forces were in course of being withdrawn from Najran (they had razed Badr to the ground on evacuating it) and were being concentrated at four points in the Yemen along the Asir frontier. Other major issues between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya were. Fuad Bey declared, still the subject of further long-range elucidation. A day or so after receiving this more encouraging account of the situation, news of a startlingly contrary nature to the effect that an outbreak of war was imminent and that Ibn Baud was proceeding in person to the front was received from a source normally well-informed. Time, however, did not confirm this more desperate view of affairs, and on the 28th December Fuad Bey, who since his last meeting with Mr. Calvert had been away in Riyadh, informed Sir Andrew Ryan that further progress towards agreement had been registered, viz., that (1) the Idrisi was to be removed to Zebid, in the Tihama of the Yemen; (2) the \ Asir frontier, as it exists at present, was to be recognised by the Imam, both in respect of Asir Surati and Asir Tihama; and that a treaty in due course was to be made in affirmation of this; and (3) intrigues in Saudi Arabia by the Imam ; were to cease. The problem of Najran still remained unsolved—the Imam had been notified, however, that upon his acceptance or rejection of Ibn Saud’s “ last word ” proposals hung the issue of peace or war. At the end of December, therefore, though the sky was perceptibly bluer, there remained one large and rather threatening cloud, which it is to be hoped the good sense of both parties will soon contrive to dissipate. Meanwhile the position on the frontier is somewhat obscure. There appears to be no foundation for rumours of actual conflict in the direction of the sea, but it has been credibly reported in one unofficial quarter that a clash took place about the middle of the month between Wahhabi forces acting without authority and the Yemenis in Najran. 276. (Reference paragraph 247.) Fuad Bey on several occasions during the month manifested great interest in the movements and progress of Colonel Reilly’s mission to Sana. His curiosity for the moment had to remain unsatisfied. 277. The exchange of ratifications of the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty took place in Cairo on the 21st December at the Continental Hotel. The Transjordan representative was Sheikh Fuad Pasha El Khatib, personal adviser to His Highness the Amir. He was accompanied by Mr. A. S. Kirkbride, assistant to the British Resident in Transjordan. The Saudi representative in Cairo, Sheikh Fauzan-el-Sabik, acted for the Saudi Arab Government. The text of the treaty was published in the Mecca Umm-al-Qura on the 22nd December. 278. (Reference paragraph 250.) The Saudi Arab Government duly replied to Mr. Calvert’s note regarding the camels stolen by the Beni Atiya, confirming Fuad Bey’s oral statement that the animals had already been returned to the Transjordan frontier authorities on the 25th November. The Saudi authorities, on their part, also brought to the notice of the Legation on the 21st a number of [6 gg—2 ] b 2'-rr- ■■ '■■■ mp .KXiJXl, cases of robbery alleged to have occurred in the neighbourhood of fronUei^of Transjordan.

Fuad Bey, whom Mr. Calvert informed on the 10th of the despatch of this communication, promised to take up the question pei sona \ wi Ibn^Sa^during^is visit to Riyadh. No reply, however, had been received from the Saudi Government at the end of the month. • rptlirnp( 4 on the 9S0 M Maieret the French Charge d Ananes, letumed on : q r d December, accompanied by M. Shukri Tawil, a member of the consulate also returning from leave in Syria.' The reappearance of M. Maigret m Jedda, if is ungreganous colleague can be said ever to appear in Jedda was not for long bp Icf? for Rivadh by car on the 11th, accompanied by Hap Hamdi, ms riena Algerian vice-consul,' and was joined en route by Fuad 1 ^ t ^ e Rividh on the morning of the 15th December, and left again on the ^h Decembe' getting' back to Jedda and ^ [ h TcapTaY ofNefd 91st December The exceptional nature of this visit to the capital ot Aejo, foreshadowed by Sheikh P Abdullah Suleiman some six weeks ear!mr (see paragraphs 228 and 256), aroused considerable curiosity locally. Rumours to effect'that the French Government were offering the Throne of Syria to a Saudi prince, that they were engaging in active negotiations regardmg the ^ture of Hejaz Railway or that they were intervening m the l SDi ^ be dismissed There is strong reason to believe, however, that M Maigi et, despite his bland and seemingly frank assurances on his return that he had gone solely to Ratify his passion for travel and to collect material for a book did discuss matters affecting the relations of France with Ibn Sand and was allowed to go to Rivadh for that purpose as well as to achieve his more personal ambitions, whkh would have suffi as an inducement to M^Maigret himself to undertake thp iournev but hardly to induce Ibn Sand to authonse it. . 281 The Diplomatic Body, apart from M. Maigret, pursued the inevitably even tenor of official existence here. Signor Tonci returned from local leave in Fsvnt bringing his wife with him—a lady who has since maintained an almost omental seclusion. The successor to Signor de Peppo, the Italian Minister who left in the early summer, is Signor Persico, who, however, is only to hold the tank of Char£re d’Affaires. The Persian Charge left on the 15th, but his successor 8 Muhammad Ali Khan Maqdam, has still to arrive. The Egyptian consul was galvanised into unwonted activity during the week of Tala at I asha Harb's visit and, when Sir Andrew Ryan visited him afterwards, had on show in his study a very pretty display of samples. IV.— M iscellaneous. 282. Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan returned from leave m the United Kingdom on the 13th, via Port Sudan.5 283. (Reference paragraph 185.) Mr. A. N. Van De Poll returned from Europe on the 10th. He intends to remain here during*the Haj season, and has already spent part of his time in Mecca. Neither he nor Mr. Philby was averse to celebrating Christmas, it seemed—though most temperately. 284. End-of-year festivities in Jedda were also brightened by the ^^earance of the American Coon family. Dr. and Mrs. Carlton Coon, stated to represent Harvard University—he is rather young for a doctor of philosophy, and an anthropologist to boot—accompanied by Mr. Waldo Forbes, arrived on Boxing Day with the intention of conducting anthropological investigations in Saudi Arabia. They requested permission to travel across to Riyadh and pursue their researches amongst the Bedouin. Their request was not granted, and, to anticipate the Jedda report for next month, they left here for Aden on the 3rd January. Whilst recently at Sanaa they had discovered, they averred, a Yemeni of distinctly Neanderthal type. It is sad to think that owing to their departure one still lacks scientific confirmation of one’s belief that Saudi Arabia can do much better than that. 285. The pilgrimage season has now got fairly under way, a number of ships having arrived. It is still too early to estimate the probable totals, but present indications do not encourage optimism. Few prominent pilgrims have, so far as is known, arrived. Perhaps the most outstanding personage is His Highness Seyyid Sir Taimur-bin-Faisal, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., ex-Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who landed here on the 7th December and was officially welcomed by representatives of the Saudi Government, whose guest he is understood to be. 286. The Umm-al-Qura of the 15th December announced that it is hoped shortly to affix a large clock upon the Government offices in Mecca. 287. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in December was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : None. Took refuge in December : One male, one female. Manumitted in December and repatriated : One female. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at the end of the month : One male. One ex-slave man and one ex-slave woman took refuge fearing re-enslavement. The former left again of his own free will. The latter is still on hand. oNo.]?. 81-N/33.

Ibn Saud remained in Nejd during the month. 234. Amir Feisal returned to Mecca from summering in Taif early in November and almost at once left for Jedda, where he arrived on the 8th. He received His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in formal audience on the 9th and again, this time on business (see paragraph 252), on the 15th. He returned to Mecca on the 17th. 235. Fuad Bey Hamza arrived back in Mecca from Riyadh (see para graph 209) in the first week of November and visited Jedda twice during the remainder of the month. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had a lengthy conversation with him on the 12th, the first since the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs’ return from leave, and again on the 21st. 236. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman continued to flit backwards and forwards between Mecca and Jedda, chiefly occupied with the administration of his depart ments. He is now perhaps less busily employed in organising the despatch of troops and supplies to Asir (see paragraph 244), as Saudi military preparations in the south are believed to be more or less complete. He is, however, bending his energies to intensive deep-sea fishing and generally, nowadays, has some new record to announce. From his activities as Minister of Finance it is not surprising to find him endowed with all the instincts of the born angler. Mr. Calvert was his guest some weeks ago at a late-night fishing expedition. 237. The young Amir of Jedda, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz-bin-Muammar. who left for Riyadh on the 4th August to get married (see paragraph 167) returned to his post on the 30th November. 238. On the 10th November the Umm-al-Qura announced the appointment of Asad Effendi-al-Faqih to the post of assistant in the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He is another Syrian recruit to Saudi officialdom and, as he speaks French, has probably been selected by Fuad Bey Hamza, whose knowledge of that language is elementary, partly on that account. 239. The Umm-al-Qura stated, in its issue of the 24th November, that a municipal administration had now been inaugurated at Riyadh; that royal palaces and Government departments had been linked up by telephone; and that the system had been further extended from the A1 Badia Palace and the royal residence to the Riyadh wireless station. It pointed out with pride that last year a police administration was set up, and added that the lighting of the main streets of the capital is now contemplated. 240. (Reference paragraph 211.) Mr. K. S. Twitched returned on the 15th from the Hasa coast, where he left the Standard Oil Company of California’s geologists at work. 241. Mr. Philby’s difficulties with the Saudi Government over Sharqieh (Limited)’s motor and tyre concession were briefly referred to at paragraph (991 ee—21 b212 in Jedda report for last month. These difficulties had been brewing for several months, and may be attributed to Sharqieh (Limited)’s failure to carry out their obligations under their contract with the Government. ! he latter were in urgent need, for military purposes in connexion with their expeditionary force in Asir, of 200 motor vehicles and a supply of tyres, but Mr. Philby had left for Europe on the 18th May and the vehicles and tyres had failed to 4 materialise. Further, the company’s skeleton staff in Jedda had made no attempt to open up service stations in accordance with the terms of the concession. \\ hilst in England, Mr. Philby got wind of an arrangement under consideration by the Minister of Finance, whereby a consignment of British tyres in the Customs here, imported by Muhammad Sadiq, the King’s Indian chauffeur upon authorisation given, it is said, before the grant of the tyre monopoly to Sharqieh (Limited), was to be taken over by the Government. He telegraphed protesting against the infringement of his concession and was thereupon allowed by Ibn Saud one month in which to return and effect an arrangement with the Minister of Finance and Muhammad Sadiq. Mr. Philby, as was recorded last month, returned in haste and negotiations took place between him, the Minister of Finance, Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., Muhammad Sadiq and a representative of General Motors, a Mr. Daimpre, who had in the meantime also arrived here from Egypt. The result, in brief, was the virtual abrogation of the Sharqieh concession in regard to motor vehicles and the signature of a contract for the supply of fifty Chevrolet trucks with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., as agents, and Sadiq, as sub-agent, on terms considerably less .favourable to the Government than Sharqieh (Limited) had been prepared to offer. The Umm-al-Qura of the 17th November contained an announcement in which the Sharqieh concession in regard to cars was, in effect, abrogated, though the contract in respect of tyres appears to have been maintained, probably in some modified form. Mr. Philby, who still appears to hope to import Fords for pilgrimage and private uses, though only in open competition, left hurriedly for Egypt on the 17th. His journey is said to have been taken in order to make an arrangement with Ford’s to supply cars for Government use and he is believed to have received an advance of money from the Government foi* this purpose. He was still away at the end of the month. 242. The demise of the National Bank scheme (and the Jedda-Mecca Railway project, for the fate of the latter now seems as apparent as that of the former), has seemingly not quenched all hope in this country of a national bank. The forthcoming visit by aeroplane from Cairo of Talaat Pasha Harb, Egyptian Senator and chairman of directors of the Banque Misr, though ostensibly for other purposes (see paragraph 254 below), is considered here to be not unconnected with a possible extension of the activities of the Banque Misr to this country. 243. (Reference paragraphs 168 and 194.) The Hyderabad textile industry scheme at Medina, organised by Dr. Moin-ud-Din, is receiving further supplies from India, a quantity of material, including twelve looms, having arrived here towards the end of the month. 244. There has been no appreciable change in the situation in Asir (reference paragraph 217) during November. Strong rumours were current locally during the first half of the month that Saudi troops had crossed the frontier in the Tihama and after heavy fighting had penetrated as far south as Medi. Both Amir Feisal and Fuad' Bey Hamza categorically denied these reports to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and the Umm-al-Qura published on the 24th an article, of obviously official inspiration, containing a similar dementi of reports alleged to have appeared also in the foreign press. Saudi military preparations are thought to be now complete, but recruiting is believed to be ooing on still, and on the 13th November a further batch of from 400-500 troops Teft Jedda by sea for Jizan. The general situation will be further treated below in connexion with Saudi relations with the Yemen (see paragraph 245). II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 245. There has been no detente in the relations between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya during the month (see paragraphs 219 and 220). In Asir (see paragraph *244 above) the general position remained much the same, save that additional reinforcements continued to be drafted south. In Najran Imamic forces still maintained a .substantial hold on the district and still occupied Badr,3 its principal centre. Latterly, however, according to Fuad Bey Hamza, a sub tribe of the Beni Yam had scored a local success in driving the Yemenis out of and in occupying the Wadi Habuna, in the vicinity of Badr, a fertile and inhabited prolongation of the Wadi Najran. If the military tempo remained moderato sostenuto it was in accordance with strict orders trom Riyadh, and r ^ was due to Ibn Saud’s desire to preserve as favourable an atmosphere as possible for diplomatic exchanges, the tempo of which quickened during the month. On the 2nd November Ibn Saud replied, through Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman, to Mr. Calvert’s representations of the 30th October (see paragraph 220) reiterating his desire for peace, declaring that his overtures to the Imam \ahya had been rejected and denouncing the latter’s territorial pretensions, his military aggressiveness and his intrigues to foment internal trouble in Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud was therefore compelled to take measures for the defence of bis country. A settlement, however, was necessary and he summarised his claims under four heads : (a) Surrender of the Idrisi; (b) evacuation of Najran; (c) establishment of present frontiers; and (d) reaffirmation of the present treaty (of Decembei 1931) between the two countries. On the 12th Fuad Bey r Hamza stated that Ibn Saud had received a communication from the Imam enquiring the reason for the concentration of Saudi troops on the Asir frontier, to which Ibn Saud replied two days later that it was precautionary and was due to similar concen tration in the Yemen. He took the opportunity afforded by this resumption of correspondence of reformulating his demands, his four points, and inviting the Imam s observations on them. Fuad Bey stated that an ultimatum had been prepared, together with a Green Book setting forth the Saudi case, and its issue would depend upon the nature of the Imam ’ s reply to Ibn Saud ’ s last message. Fuad Bey asserted Ibn Saud’s determination to avoid hostilities “ at all costs,” and gave what are undoubtedly two weighty reasons for this attitude—that were Ibn Saud to take the first' step in a fratricidal Arab war he would assuredly forfeit the sympathy of the whole Islamic world; and that a war would prove financially disastrous to Saudi Arabia in the present difficult economic circumstances of the country. Fuad Bey also expressed misgivings as to the attitude of the Italian Government in the event of war, but later in the month he informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires confidentially that he had received friendly assurances’from the Italians, which may help to dissipate Saudi uneasiness on that score. 246. The Imam in due course replied to Ibn Saud s communication, accepting a proposal for a conference, but maintaining silence on the subject of the four points. This elicited a rejoinder that the omission to clarify the principal issues beforehand made a facile acceptance of a conference proposal by no means agreeable to Ibn Saud. The request for the Imam s views was again made, and during the last ten days of November the Imam replied with no less than three telegrams, each one asking for additional information on the four points. Fuad Bey considered the questions were insincere and procrastinating, but Ibn Sand had replied fully in each case. The situation was unsatisfactory and Fuad Bey personally was inclined to believe the issue of the ultimatum could not long be delayed. In fact, he said, the tribes on the Asir frontier might anticipate an ultimatum by coming to blows at almost any day. 247. On the 18th November His Majesty s Charge d Affaires, under instructions, informed the Saudi Government by semi-official letter to Fuad Bey Hamza, of the present situation between the Aden Protectorate and the 1: emeu and of His Majesty’s Government’s intention to send Colonel Reilly to Sanaa to negotiate a treaty with the Imam. The Saudi Government was assured that this step, the outcome of negotiations which antedated the present Saudi—Yemeni imbroglio, implied no change in the feelings of friendship His Majesty s Govern ment entertained for the Saudi Arab Government, but that on the contrary it was hoped that it might present an opportunity to His Majesty’s Government to exercise their influence with the Imam to reduce the dangers in the piesent situation between the two Arab States. On the 27th Mr. Calvert received Fuad Bey’s reply in which Ibn Saud acknowledged and expressed his gratitude for these assurances. The King felt, however, that His Majesty’s Government would discover in their dealings with the Imam that he flattered only to deceive. 248. (Reference paragraph 222.) Mr. Calvert discussed with Fuad Bey the question of the exchange of ratifications of the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty on the 12th November, the first opportunity since the return of the Deputy [991 ee—2] b 24 Minister for Foreign Affairs from abroad. Fuad Bey, on this occasion, or o to press the earlier Saudi proposal of an exchange at Jedda, and sugges e a the formality should take place either in Egypt or at Jerusalem. e ques ion was still under consideration at the end of the month. 249. The suggestion referred to at paragraph 19, that a personal mee mg between the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan and Tbn Baud might prove usetul, further pursued by Mr. Calvert in conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on me 21st November. Fuad Bey promised to refer to Ibn Baud, and °n tne 2 /tn informed Mr. Calvert that the King welcomed the suggestion, but found it dimcult to fix a date earlier than the middle of March, and proposed, further, e should proceed to the meeting, whenever it took place, by embarking at dedda. The matter was still receiving His Majesty’s Government’s consideration at tne end of the month. , , 250. On the 28th November two cases of robbery of camels belonging to Transjordan tribes by members of the Beni Atiya tribe encamped in the Hejaz were brought to the notice of the Saudi Government. Whilst there had been no time for an official replv before the end of the month, Fuad Bey informed hm Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, orally, that he understood a number of camels, which were stolen in July and August last, had already been returned. An official statement is awaited. In this connexion Fuad Bey observed that he gathered that relations between Saudi and Transjordan frontier authorities were cordial. He added that Abdullah-as-Sdayri, Governor of Tehuk, had been recently on a visit to Mecca, and had returned to his post, where his brother (probably Abdul Aziz as-Sdayri) had acted for him, about the 28th November. 251. (Reference paragraph 200.) On the 28th November His Majesty s Charcre d’Affaires addressed Fuad Bey Hamza on the subject of the frontier post of Hazim, stating that the Transjordan Government were unable to agree that this place lay on the frontier line between the two countries, hut that it was situated well within Transjordan territory. The Saudi military post was still in the vicinity of Hazim, but its relations with the Arab Legion post there continued to be friendly. The communication concluded with a suggestion that reciprocal arrangements might he made for the posts on either side to water at Hazim and at Isawiya in Saudi territory respectively. No reply had been received at the end of the month. HI .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 252. In anticipation of the expiration on the 17th November of the Saudi moratorium in respect of their governmental debts, His Majesty s Chaige d’Affaires, under instruction, made oral representations to Amir Feisal on the 15th to the effect that His Majesty’s Government now expected the Saudi Government to make a serious attempt to deal with this long outstanding question. On the 18th His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, in an official note, requested the repayment of the principal of the debts in question. On the 21st Fuad Bey stated that a written reply was in preparation, hut in the meantime stated verbally that, owing to the serious economic situation of the country and lecent political development (alluding to the dispute with the Yemen), his Government found themselves unable at present to liquidate their indebtedness to His Majesty s Government, although plans to that end had been drawn up earlier in the year. The official reply was duly received on the 27th, and was couched in much the same terms. The next step in the matter was receiving careful consideration at the end of the month. 253. (Reference paragraph 151.) There has been recently a decided recrudescence of complaints from British subjects and protected persons, chauffeurs of Government and other motor vehicles, that the authorities were refusing to renew driving licences to all foreign chauffeurs who failed to adopt Saudi nationality. No regulations have been published by the Saudi authorities on the subject, and as many cases of hardship are occurring owing to inadequate notice of termination of employment, Mr. Calvert on the 12th November brought the matter orally to the notice of Fuad Bey Hamza, who promised to make enquiries. He is still enquiring. . 254 During the latter half of the month it became known m Jedda that the Egyptian Senator and chairman of the directors of the Banque Misr, Tala at Pasha Harb (see paragraph 242 above), was expected to arrive here by air early in December, from Suez, stopping en route at Tor, Wejh and Yanbu. On//i o the 19th one of the staff of Misr-Airwork, a ground engineer, arrived here and a landing ground close to the town was eventually selected. With the co-operation of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), as agents, preparations were going actively forward at the end of the month for the arrival of the plane on the 3rd December. The objects of the visit are stated to be (a) the selection of ^ktcal shipping representative for the two pilgrim ships, steamship Zamzam and tSamship Nil, which, it is understood, have recently been acquired by the Egyptian Government for the conveyance of Egyptian pilgrims to and from the Hejaz; (b) the organisation of the sale of Egyptian products in this country, in particular the cotton goods produced by a subsidiary company of the Banque Misr; and (c) to explore the possibility of the Banque Misr extending its activities to this country by assuming the functions of a State Bank. Misr-Airwork, also, may not be indifferent to the opportunity of displaying their aircraft to the Saudi Government, whose guests the members of the Egyptian Mission will be during their stay in this country. 255. The Italian Charge d'Affaires, Signor Tonci, left on the 17th for two weeks’ local leave in Egypt, where he was to meet his wife, whom he proposed to bring to Jedda on his return. Shortly before his departure he informed Mr. Calvert that he still had no news of the nomination of a successor to Signor De Peppo, the late Minister. 256. (Reference paragraph 228.) M. Maigret, the French Charge d’Affaires, did not arrive, as expected, on the 12th, and had not returned from leave at the end of the month. Nothing further has been heard of his proposed excursion to Riyadh. 257. Foreign missions in Jedda, otherwise, are slowly returning to full complement. The Dutch Charge d’Affaires returned on the 5th. His Legation has acquired a new doctor, Abdurrahman, who arrived from Java on the 17th and who will be in charge of the medical work of the Dutch Legation, both in Mecca and Jedda. Dr. Hartmann's contract, therefore, terminates at the end of December, and it is thought he will not be long in shaking the dust of Jedda from his feet. The Persian Charge returned from leave in Syria on the 19th. but expects to be transferred to Tehran within a few weeks, his successor, Muhammad AH Khan Maqdam, having been already named. Habibullah Khan Hoveyda has been given the rank of Persian Minister, but this is not to take effect whilst he is still in this country. 258. On the 10th November the Umm-al-Qura announced that diplomatic notes, relating to commerce, shipping, &amp;c., had been signed on the 7th in London by the United States Ambassador and the Saudi Arab Minister on behalf of their respective Governments. This development follows, it may be assumed, the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to an American company. 259. Telegrams of condolence and acknowledgment were exchanged between Ibn Saud and King Muhammacf^j&amp;f Afghanistan and Amir Feisal and Ghulam Yahya, the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the assassination of King Nadir Shah. IV .—M iscellaneo us. 260. The sloop H.M.S. Penzance (Commander R. H. Sevan, R.N.), arrived in Jedda Roads on the 18th and left for Port Sudan on the 23rd November. 261. The Indian vice-consul and pilgrimage officer returned from leave on the 19th, and the Malay pilgrimage officer arrived on the 21st from Malaya, thus completing the Legation’s pilgrimage staff in readiness for the foi thcoming season. The first pilgrim ship to arrive was the steamship Peisander from Sourabaya, with a matter of some 680 pilgrims on board. She has since been followed by other ships. It is, however, still too early to form a tellable estimate of the size of this year's pilgrimage. . 262. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves m November was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : None. Took refuge in November : None. Manumitted in November and repatriated : None. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at the end of the month : None. o...Mil Notes. Register No. P.2 Minute Paper. # 2 . 0 . 11/33 SECRET.

I .—Internal Affairs. 208 The Kins has remained in Nejd and Amir Feisal at Taif during October. The Amir of Jedda, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, was still absent at the end of the month (see paragraphs 167 and 193). The Mmister Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, was constantly on the move between Taif, Mecca and Jedda, chiefly occupied in organising the despatch of troops and stoies to As (see paragraphs |17 ^ m ^ accompanied t)y lus w if e) returned from abroad on the 9th October by'Italian steamer. He was met at the landing stage by local authorities and notables, and, clad in “ Ihram towels only, presented a some what incongruous figure inspecting (very cursorily) the guard of honour mounted for the occasion. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was present to welcome him. The Deputy Minister left the same day for Mecca and three or four days latei went on*to Riyadh to pay his respects to Ibn Saud. He was expected to return e ' rl5 210 ^Arriving by the same boat as Fuad Bey Hamza, and indeed a member of his party, was Khalid-al-Hakim, an ex-Turkish officer of Syrian or Palestinian ori&lt;Aii whose record may be consulted in this Legation s compilation. • ' Personalities in Saudi Arabia” (No. 56). It is interesting, in view of press I reports that Fuad Bey Hamza’s prolonged leave has not been /with the question of the Hejaz Railway (see paragraph 180), to note that Khalid- I A Haldm accompanied Dr Damluji in July 1928 to take part in the abortive | conference at HaHa on this question. He left with Fuad Bey Hamza for Riyadh Ion the 14th R f paragraph 169.) On the 18th October Mr. W. J. Lenahan, an official of the Standard Oil Company of California, arrived here and proceeded to establish himself as the company’s Jedda representative. He has had no previous experience of this part of the world, having previously been employed L his company, in an administrative capacity, in South America He recently stated in conversation, that five geologists of the company had already arrived in Hasa and were now at work, and that more were expected to arrive there shortlv Mr. Twitchell is believed to be soon returning to Jeclda 212 (Reference paragraph 110.) Mr. Philby, accompanied by his wife, arrived from the United Kingdom via Port Sudan on the IStlc His return, it i» understood, was rather hurried, due to difficulties with the Saudi Government nvpr SWn’ieh Limited’s motor and tvre concession. , ^ , 213 (Reference paragraphs 17i and 1721. The National Bank scheme remains as much as ever a castle in Spain, and the Jedda-Mecca railway project is still darkly incubating in Madras. One suspects the egg. [963 dd—1] -Hi Xmmm 2 214. The general financial situation is far from reassuring. Government employees, who for a number of months past have been receiving their salaries in the form of one-third cash, one-third in kind (flour, rice, sugar, &amp;c.), and one-third carried forward to their credit, have, according to fairly reliable reports, been latterly receiving nothing at all. The Treasury is said to have adopted the simple expedient of making no disbursements whatsoeveijg except to a favoured few. Government debts are ignored. Saudi currency haP weakened. Large sums have been absorbed by military preparations against the Yemen, and the £35,000 gold received as an oil loan (see paragraph 169) has probably been utilised for the purpose. Altogether the picture is not a pleasant one and the bright spots are far to seek. Of these it may be mentioned that the first pilgrim ship of the season left Sourabaya on the 28th October—but next year’s pilgrimage, by all accounts, will be as disappointing as this year’s. 215. Government Departments and officials were returning from Taif to Mecca during the second half of October. Amir Feisal and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are expected to last the month out and return early in November. The Legislative Assembly adjourned at Taif on the 24th and reassembles ten days later in Mecca. 216. (Reference paragraph 141.) Whilst it is still doubtful whether the increased tonnage dues on shipping, which were introduced in July, are going to be enforced, certain new taxes on local craft have been announced, during the month, and are to take effect as from the 24th June last. These are :— Piastres miri per month. Motor-launch ... ... ... ... 15 Sanbuq ... ... ... ... 15 Boat ... ... ... ... ... 5 (Where 110 piastres miri = £1 gold.) The annual tax on a motor-launch, therefore, amounts to about £2 10.9., but, in view of the fact that the amount per annum is not excessive and compares not unfavourably with similar taxes in various ports of neighbouring countries, local representatives of foreign shipping concerns have accepted the new tax philosophically. 217. The situation in Asir (reference paragraph 195) continues to monopolise public attention here. Further concentration of Saudi troops has taken place during the month, until, according to Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, scarcely a soldier remains in Nejd, and he confidently expected that Saudi military dispositions would be complete by the end of October. Amir Feisal-bin- Saad was still Commander-in-chief, with his headquarters at Abha, where he is in constant wireless communication with the King, being accompanied wherever he goes by a mobile wireless set. Saudi resources in respect of communications were further augmented by the arrival on the 29th of two large motor-launches, which had come under their own power from Bahrein, where they had been recently acquired by Ibn Sand. They were immediately got ready for use and, to anticipate next month’s report, left on the 1st November for Jizan with about 500 troops on board. At the end of the month the Saudi force had generally advanced, in Asir, to positions somewhat nearer the frontier, in order to be readily available should its defence become suddenly necessary. The situation in Asir will be further dealt with (see paragraph 219 below) in connexion with relations between the Saudi Government and the Yemen. 218. (Reference paragraph 197.) Abul Walid Khalid-el-Qarqani, Sheikh Hamad Suleiman and Turki-bin-Mahdi, the three members of the recent Saudi delegation to Sana, who were for a short period forcibly detained there by the Imam Yahya, left Mecca for Riyadh on the 14th October. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 219. The tension between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya {ride para graph 196) shows no signs of relaxing. For the first three weeks of October, although military preparations went on unabated, the fact that hostilities did not break out as time went by encouraged the hope that neither side would be rash enough to take the first hostile step and that the situation would remain3 * unprecipitated. A report, attributed to the Saudi delegation to Sana who passed through here early, in the month for Mecca, that the two rulers had agreed to a six months’ truce, gave further grounds for optimism. Hopes of this nature, however, were soon dashed by reports, confirmed shortly afterwards, of renewed fighting in Najran, where the Imamic forces were again captained by Saif-al- .{jdfcim Ahmad, and the fall of Badr. The Minister of Finance admitted to Mj . Calvert on the 19th October that Badr had been occupied by Zeidi troops upon the defection of the Makarimi, an independent sub-tribe of the Beni Yam. a changed tune from his previous one of a Yemeni withdrawal before victorious tribesmen. He gave another ten days before Ibn Saud presented the Imam Yahya with an ultimatum, and expressed his own view that, as, in his opinion, the Imam would reject the King’s demands, war was inevitable. 220. On the 20th the Umm-al-Qura published an official Saudi communique, in which the situation and its recent developments in Najran were outlined, and Ibn Saud’s pacific intentions and rigid determination to defend his territory restated. The communique called on the Imam to pause and reflect, and to exert himself to avoid the shedding of Arab blood. The Umm-nl-Qura on the same day published a leading article on the crisis, in the form of a reply to a recent letter by the Imam to the newspaper Falestin. No ultimatum had been issued by the end of the month, and, acting under instructions, Mr. Calvert informed Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, on the 30th October, that the Italian Government were again urging the Imam to agree to negotiate, and expressed His Majesty’s Government’s earnest desire that, in view of this, every effort would be made by Ibn Saud to avoid hostilities. 221. On the 9th October His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informed the Saudi Government that the survey of the Koweit Neutral Zone was to recommence about the 1st November from Qurain, 17 miles west-south-west of Ras-al-Qaliya. On the 17th the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Saudi Government had no objection to the resumption of the survey. 222. (Reference paragraph 199.) Further communications relative to the exchange of ratifications of the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty have passed during the month between Mr. Calvert and the Saudi authorities through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs’ local representative at Jedda. Fuad Bey Hamza has been in Nejd since his return from leave, but an early opportunity of treating this question with him in person is now in prospect. 223. On the 15th October Muhammad Hamdi-el-Chokhidar arrived here from Bagdad as acting Iraqi Charge d’Affaires and consul-general, in the room of Nasir Bey A1 Gaylani (vide paragraph 155), who has been appointed vice-consul at Kermanshah. Muhammad Hamdi has previously served in a consular capacity at Angora, Kermanshah and Mohammerah. He is pleasant, speaks a little Ensrlish, and seems anxious to be friendly. Abdullah Rashid remains here as consular clerk. 224. Forty days after the death of King Feisal. i.e., on the 24th October, the Iraqi Legation held a commemorative reception. Flags were flown half-mast. 225. (Reference paragraphs 5 and 94.) The proposed motor-road between Najaf and Medina appears to have got no forrader. Enquiries from India led the Legation to ask the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for information on the subject. The Ministry replied, on the 18th, that the matter is still under discussion with the Iraqi authorities. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 226. There is nothing of fresh interest to report as far as Anglo-Saudi relations are concerned—they continue friendly. 227. The Egyptian consul Hafiz Bey Amer, returned from a lengthy leave on the 8th October. 228. Mr. Calvert was informed on the 27th by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, as from Ibn Saud, that the King had recently agreed to allow M. Maigret, French Charge d’Affaires, to visit Nejd immediately upon his return from leave. M. Maigret had met Fuad Bey Hamza in Syria and had enlisted his support for his request. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman emphasised the private and personal nature of M. Maigret’s visit, but, as the latter is to be received by the King in or near4 \ Riyadh, it is a little difficult to be quite satisfied with the bona fides of this assurance. The visit, however, is not so imminent as at first appeared likely: M. Maigret was expected to arrive on the 28th October by a French naval despatch-boat, the Ypres, which had called at Beirut on its way to the Red Sea. The despatch-boat duly arrived, but the French Charge d’Affaires was not on board. His return is now expected for the 12th November, but Fuad Bey Han&gt;^. who had at first intended to await his arrival in Riyadh, was on his way back .o Mecca at the end of the month. IV .—M iscellaneous. 229. Lieutenant-Colonel Ibrahim Depui, M.C., formerly in charge of the French consulate here, and now reported to be employed in the Intelligence Department of the French War Office, arrived on the 20th October by Italian steamer from Massawa, after touring certain Red Sea ports (Aden, Jibuti, Hodeida, &amp;c.). As he is a Moslem, he spent most of his visit to this country at Mecca and Medina; he left for Suez on the 1st November. 230. The French naval despatch-boat Ypres arrived here from Beirut on the 28th October and left the next day. 231. The Saudi Government, in spite of several reminders, have as yet been unable to issue their official tariff of dues and transport charges for the forthcoming pilgrimage season. The Minister of Finance has informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires most categorically that the official tariff for 1934. which was in course of being printed as part of the pilgrimage guide published annually in Mecca, was exactly the same as the 1933 tariff. British authorities ’ concerned have been, therefore, notified to that effect. 232. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in October was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : None. Took refuge in October : None. Manumitted in October and repatriated : None. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at the end of the month : None. oConfidenti al.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for September 1933. I .—Internal Affairs. 193. During the month Ibn Saud remained in Nejd and Amir Feisal at Taif. The Amir of Jedda, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar (see paragraph 167), was absent the whole month, as was Fuad Bey Hamza, whose return from abroad, however, is predicted for the first week in October. The Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, carried on in the latter's absence as intermediary between the Legation and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and visited Jedda twice during September (see paragraphs 195 and 196). 194. Dr. Moin-ud-Din (see paragraph 168) left for India on the 13th by the steamship Jehangir. He proposes, whilst in Hyderabad, to buy a further fifty looms and a quantity of Rangoon teak for spindles for his textile project at Medina, and hopes to be able to stimulate interest in, raise funds and arrange a sales organisation in Hyderabad for the “ihrams,” &amp;c., produced. It would appear that his institution in its present stages is primarily instructional and is intended to promote home industry. 195. As far as can be gathered, the situation in Asir has changed only in regard to the concentration of Saudi military forces in the province against the Yemen. This has proceeded steadily throughout the month. Reports of a conflict at Salla in the Tihamat Asir between Saudi and Yemeni troops, which appeared in the Egyptian press as emanating from Aden, and which were repeated in the Times, were contradicted by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman in conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires on the 29th. He admitted that a minor disturbance had occurred some six weeks ago when Saudi troops were used against a small tribe, whose name he professed to have forgotten, inhabiting a village immediately south of Jizan, who had refused to pay their taxes. They had been suitably dealt with and their leaders thrown into prison at Jizan. The general situation will be further treated below in connexion with relations with the Yemen (see paragraph 196). II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 196. The month opened with relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen (see paragraphs 177-9) hardening and with the promise of hostilities in the air. On the 7th, the Minister of Finance, at a meeting with His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires, declared the situation remained substantially unchanged. His personal opinion was that the Imam would be allowed to gang his ain gait until Saudi military dispositions were complete, when he would be confronted with an ultimatum. On the 11th, over 700 troops (mainly tribesmen) were embarked on the [935 z—2]2 steamship Jehangir for Jizan, and a further 200 left by dhow on the and succeeding days, although the latter were, according to Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, replacements only. Quantities of stores were both shipped and sent overiand by motor transport during the month. Amir Feisal-bin-Saad, nephew of the was appointed Commander-in-chief for the present, with headquarters at Abha^ but might be superseded by the King’s eldest son, Amir baud, should it becom necessary. On the 29th Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman again informed Mr. Calvert that the situation remained much the same. Correspondence between the two rulers had ceased with a curt and platitudinous acknowledgment by the Imam Yahya of Ibn Sand’s telegraphic exposition of his demands. There was no cessation, however, of hostilities in Najran between local tribes and Imamic troops. The Beni Yam had been reinforced by certain kindred tribal elements from the Wadi Dawasir, and were now gradually getting the upper hand and were compelling the Zeidis to withdraw. I he month has, therefore, seen no improvement, and unless the efforts of distinguished Moslem leaders abroad, who are reported to be offering to mediate, are unexpectedly successful, the prospects are not such as to encourage much optimism. 197. Hamad Suleiman, brother of the Minister of Finance, and Khahd-bm- Qarqani, members of the Saudi delegation to Sana, were due to arrive in Jedda from Jizan at the end of September. 198 (paragraph 362 of 1932). The question of transit dues on goods passing through Bahrein for the mainland of Saudi Arabia was carried a step further when His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, on the instructions of His Majesty’s Government, informed the Saudi Arab Government on the 9th September that, in view of Saudi unwillingness to accept a proposal to hold a conference on the matter, the Government of Bahrein could see no alternative but to terminate, as from that date, the customs arrangement of 1920 with Ibn Saud. It was still considered that the proposal to hold a conference offered the best prospects of arriving at a friendly settlement. 199. Informal communications, chiefly through Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, have passed between Mr. Calvert and Amir Feisal during the month regarding the exchange of ratifications of the Iransjordan-Saudi Treaty, signed at Jerusalem on the 27th July last (see paragraph 145). The Saudi Arab Govern ment are inclined to insist on the exchange taking place at Jedda, but are awaiting the return of Fuad Bey Hamza before taking up a final attitude, in view of His Majesty’s Government’s desire to see the exchange take place at Amman. 200. Telegrams were received on the 5th and 6th Irom Iransjordan reporting the presence of a Saudi military post at Hazim, on the Transjoidan side of the frontier with Saudi Arabia. They were reported to be interfering with passers-by and making use of the wells. Urgent representations were made to the Saudi Arab Government, who replied that, pending a demarcation of the frontier, they considered that Hazim lay exactly on the frontier Ji n e- A subsequent telegram from Transjordan announced the withdiawal of the Saudi military post by several miles into what was probably Saudi territory. 201. The Umm-al-Qura of the 15th announced that, upon the death of King Feisal telegrams of condolence were sent by Ibn Saud. Amir Saud and Amir Feisal to King Ghazi and Rashid Ali, Prime Minister of Iraq, respectively, and by Ibn Saud to Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. Suitable replies were in each received. 202 The same issue of the Umm-al-Qura reported the visit of the Amir Abdullah-bin-Qasim-bin-Thani of Qatar to Riyadh. The visit is represented to have been a friendly one, undertaken with the object of congratulating Amir Saud on his proclamation as successor to the throne, and the Amir is stated to have been hospitably met and entertained by Ibn Saud and his family. HI. — Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 203 Anglo-Saudi relations continue friendly. Otherwise there is little of interest to note. The Italian Charge d’Affaires has during the month been endeavouring to obtain from the Saudi Government information on the situation with the Yemen He appears to have had little success so far, and on the 21st he suggested to Mr. Calvert, as from himself, that the Corps diplomatique■a Mi ■ 3 should make a joint demarche. Mr. Calvert was unable to show any enthusiasm, and Signor Tonci admitted he had not succeeded with the doyen, the Russian Minister. Jelal Bey, the Turkish Charge d’Affaires, who returned from leave early in September, was understood to be sympathetic, but inclined to dissociate i^nself from any joint representation, preferring to take his own line. Whether c^Pio this move had official Italian inspiration, it was a complete failure. 204. Signor de Peppo, the Italian Minister, is not returning to Jedda, having received an appointment in connexion with the League of Nations. His successor is not yet known. 205. (Reference paragraph 306 of last year.) Dr. Mahmud Hamdi Bey Hammuda, Director-General of Health, is to represent Saudi Arabia at the forthcoming meeting of the International Health Office at Paris on the 18th October. 1933. Dr. Mahmud Bey, who also attended the meeting held last year, left for France on the 22nd September. IV.— Miscellaneous. 206. (Reference paragraph 170.) Mr. K. S.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for August 1933. I .—Internal Affairs. 165. IBN SAUD remained in Nejd during the month. Early in August the Amir Feisal left Taif, with his family, for Khurma, a village some distance to the north-east, where he stayed for ten days before returning to Taif. 166. Fuad Bey Hamza, who left on the 12th July for the Transjordan Conference, remained abroad during August, and the Jedda office of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at the end of the month professed to have had no word as to the date of his return (see paragraph 180 below). The Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, continued to deputise for him in various matters passing between the Legation and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (see paragraphs 177-9 below). He was in Jedda at the beginning of August and again on the 24th. In between he spent a week in Nejd, where, however, so he informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, he did not see the King. 167. The Amir of Jedda, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, left for Riyadh on the 4th August and was still away at the end of the month. During his absence Sheikh Ah Taha, the joint Deputy Governor and representative in Jedda of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was Acting Governor. Sheikh Abdul Aziz, who is reputed to be that rare bird in Arabia—a bachelor—is popularly supposed to have gone to Nejd to find a bride. Indeed, the lady designated by Jedda Society newsmongers is a recently divorced wife of the King, for whom the young Governor has long entertained an all but hopeless passion. It is also averred, in less romantic circles, that the Amir has been called to Riyadh for a consultation with the King. He broke his journey at Taif, one hears, and accompanied the Amir Feisal on his way thence to Khurma. 168. (Reference paragraph 137.) The material which arrived recently for the Hyderabad textile industry scheme was admitted into the country free of customs duties by order of the Minister of Finance, and was forwarded early in the month to Dr. Moin-ud-Din at Medina. The consignment, it is understood, consisted of twenty-four bales of cotton, ten cases containing a total of 110 spindles and one case containing one hand-loom. It is reported that Dr. Moin-ud-Din has already hired large premises in Medina in which to house his scheme, has engaged about twenty hands, both local subjects and Indians, and has had some eight dozen spindles made locally. Whether he will succeed in his project to manufacture “ Ihrams ” for the pilgrimage arouses a little mild scepticism in some quarters. 169. The rumour regarding the Hasa Oil Concession “ loan ” mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 138 of the report for July proved to be well- founded, for on the 20th August the sum of £35,000 gold in English sovereigns arrived by the steamship Talodi. It was found impossible to land it that day,owing to some confusion over the shipping documents, so the money, contained in seven chests, was carried across to Port Sudan and returned on the 23rd, when it was safely landed and handed over to the Dutch Bank (Nederlandsche Handel- Maatschappij N.V.) here. This sum is confidently asserted in certain quarters here to be a loan, and repayment, it is stated, is to be made gradually against the eventual royalties received by the Saudi Government. This arrangement, if correctly stated, would therefore be provided for in the “ special agreement,” tfB terms of which have not yet been disclosed. Meanwhile, the reports now* circulating that the money has been sent on direct to the King at Riyadh and is being used to pay the troops, wear, at least, the air of possibility. The Royal appetite having been thus pleasantly titillated, Ibn Saud is supposed to have already asked for the payment of the second instalment of the loan in advance. 170. Mr. K. S. Twitched, whose movements recently have been not unconnected with the arrival of the Standard Oil Company of California’s loan to Ibn Saud, left on the 1st August on a mystery excursion in the direction of Medina on behalf of the Saudi Government. It is believed that he inspected old gold-mines in the Hejaz, which, it is considered, are by no means “ worked out.” He returned on the 14th, and at the end of the month was on the point of departure by car for the Hasa coast. He was keenly anticipating, in the intervals of seeking new worlds to geologise, repeating a former visit to the wells, palm groves and other pastoral delights of Hofui. He expected to meet Ibn Saud at Riyadh 171. News of the National Bank scheme (reference paragraph 139) is scanty and, what little there is, conflicting. The Egyptian press reports that the ex-Khedive Abbas has abandoned the project on account of difficulties encountered in trying to interest London financiers, whose participation, so runs this report, has been discouraged by the British Government. On the other hand, it is rumoured here that the Minister of Finance contemplates a visit to London, when circumstances and Ibn Saud permit, in order to put in hand the printing of Saudi bank notes. 172. There is nothing further to report on the Jedda-Mecca Railway scheme, save that status reports on Dr. Jeelani are far from encouraging to those who wish to see the scheme succeed. 173. On the 26th August the work of several months on the wells and water supply at Waziriya {vide paragraph 140) was crowned with success, when once again in their history these wells supplied water to Jedda. The event was celebrated on the 26th by a ceremonial inauguration, at which local dignitaries, the Minister of Finance and a crowd of some thousands were present. The water is brought over the 7 miles from Waziriya and is stored in the reservoir of Idarus on the skirts of one of the poorer quarters of the town. Mr. Twitched states the rate of supply is 40 gallons per minute, and that shortly it will be possible to increase that rate threefold. He estimated present water consumption in Jedda at 38 gallons per minute, but other authorities here would place the figure much lower, probably at about 24 gallons per minute. The Waziriya water is free at the reservoir, and the price paid for it per 4-gallon kerosene tin (from J to 1 piastre Saudi) is the cost of transport only. It is therefore proving itself a great boon to the poorer inhabitants of the town who are able to draw unlimited supplies of water for the mere trouble of carrying it away. It may thus be expected that Jedda s water consumption will increase, and that the sales of condenser water (now retailed at 2J piastres Saudi per kerosene tin) will be adversely affected. The British engineer-in-charge of the condenser plant is inclined to scout this, however, on the grounds that the better-to-do will still buy condenser water for drinking purposes, as Waziriya water, though potable at present, is peculiarly vulnerable to persons of evil intent, and will, it is probably true, be somewhat suspect, as drinking water, for some time to come. 174. The Province of Asir has remained outwardly peaceful (vide para graph 142) in spite of a tense and obscure situation along its southern frontier. As in last month’s report, the situation will again be dealt with in connexion with the situation vis-a-vis the Yemen (see paragraphs 177-9 below). 175. Reports of extreme misery in Medina continue to reach the Legation. This city is the victim of tragic reductions in population and economic circumstances, and the lot of those who remain, few of whom can be far above subsistence level, is indeed an unenviable one. |3 [907 dd—1] b 2 II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 176. The treaty with Transjordan (reference paragraph 145) was first mentioned by the Saut-ul-Hejaz in its issue of the 8th August and at greater length in an article on the 15th August. It is a little curious that the Umm-al- ^ k £ura. usually regarded as the semi-official organ of the Saudi Government, should so far have refrained from any reference to the treaty. 177. The Saudi press has been almost equally mute on the subject of the Yemen (reference paragraphs 148 and 149), whose relations with Saudi Arabia had reached a critical stage at the beginning of August. The detention of the Saudi delegation against their will at Sana, which had further exacerbated Ibn Saud, proved happily to be of short duration, as they were allowed to leave the Yemen on the 3rd August. The Saudi Government, in informing His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires of this on the 6th, attributed the release to the steps taken by His Majesty’s Government, who had requested the Italian Govern ment to make urgent representations to the Imam Yahya. In the meantime (on the 5th) the Minister for Foreign Affairs had addressed a further lengthy note to Mr. Calvert for the information and comments of His Majesty’s Govern ment, setting forth the Saudi desiderata for the settlement of their differences with the Yemen, which included : (i) an apology and satisfaction for the detention of the delegation at Sana; (ii) the Idrisi either to be expelled from the Yemen, or handed over to Ibn Saud, as the shelter afforded him by the Imam Yahya, particularly in such unsettled territory as the Asir frontier districts, was not merely a breach of the treaty, but a token of the Imam’s intention to force a quarrel; (iii) the Imam’s encroachments in Najran were to stop and the frontier there to be delimited; and (iv) all frontiers between the two countries were to be settled. 178. The returning delegation brought with them a letter from the Imam to the King, the contents of which were wirelessed to Riyadh from Jizan. Ibn Saud replied by telegram stating his grievances and the remedies that would satisfy him. At this juncture it was possible to mark a certain detente, in the situation consequent upon the release of the delegation, the apparent absence of any forward movement by Imamic troops in the Xajran, and the resumption of direct telegraphic correspondence between the two rulers. This interlude was interrupted by a report received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Husain-ad-Dabbagh, one of the conspiratorial family of that name, had recently landed at Medi and had joined the Idrisi, taking with him supplies and money, and that a certain Adnan, one of Ad Dabbagh’s followers, had established himself at Kamaran as an Idrisi agent. As the result of enquiries, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was able to inform the Saudi Government that Adnan had left Kamaran on the 16th August. On the 17th His Majesty’s Government replied to the Saudi Government’s request for comments on their desiderata regretting that the position was too obscure and their information too incomplete to enable them to express any opinion. They, however, expressed their pleasure at the release of the delegation and the resumption of direct communication between Riyadh and Sana. 179. On the 25th August Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman called on Mr. Calvert and left with him copies of two telegrams, one purporting to have been received by Ibn Saud from King Feisal, in which the latter, speaking in the name of the Arabs of other countries, expressed the hope that every effort would be made to avoid the shedding of Arab blood and declared his readiness to mediate. The other telegram contained Ibn Saud's reply, asserting equal concern for Arab blood, declaring his desire for peace and summarising his case against the Imam. He expressed his gratitude, non-committally, to Feisal for his offer of mediation. The Minister of Finance dilated, during this interview, on the impossibility of Arab trusting Arab and again sought the counsels of His Majesty’s Government, to whom this information was conveyed, and whose reply was received before the end of the month, but was held up for oral communication, as Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman had, in the meantime, returned to Taif. Before he left Jedda, however, he informed Mr. Calvert at a further meeting that on the receipt of reports, some three weeks earlier, of mobilisation of troops within the Yemen, Ibn Saud had ordered the reinforcement of Saudi forces in the south-west by troops from the north-east. The Minister went on to read a series of telegrams from Ibn Saud4 to the Imam Yahya elaborating, in firm l an ^g , ^ P it is perhaps not month closed, therefore, on a somewhat more martial ™ te , « addr ' gsed F to the altogether fanciful to detect in the language °f ^ ^ ' , precautionary Imam (at the end of the month still unacknowledged) an^ P'k the military dispositions made, a quickening / bn ® r f° procra^inations^o^the (see^ paragraph 166) is causing % certain amount of comment.

The news, which disturbed prices for a day or two, was said unwelcome to e merchants involved, as they were fully insured and over-bought. 189. A Russian ship, the steamship Samaweith (?), arrived on the 30th and left the next day after discharging (both into the dhows and into the sea) a consignment of some 7,000 sacks of wheat, barley and other gram, said to have been brought from Basra. , T jj * j j 190 The climate in August has lived up to usual Jedda standards. Throughout the month, skies have been heavy with clouds and sultry nights have been enlivened by occasional thunder and distant lightning. Showers of ram were recorded on several nights. These atmospherics, unfortunately, have meant no diminution in either heat or humidity. But climate apart, it may be admitted that existence in Jedda compares not unfavourably (it is surmised) with normal prison life elsewhere. k , , . XT 191.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report, July 1933. I .—Internal Affairs. 134. The King remained in Riyadh throughout the month. Emir Feisal, who is summering at Taif, remained there all the month, Taif becoming as usual the headquarters of the Saudi Government during the hot weather, as far as the Hejaz is concerned. Fuad Bey Hamza visited Jedda twice before leaving by the steamship Taif on the 12th July for Egypt en route for the Saudi-Transjordan Conference at Jerusalem (see paragraph 145 below), and Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman, Minister of Finance, paid two visits to Jedda during Fuad Bey s absence, in circumstances which will be described later in this report (paragraph 148). 135. The Legislative Assembly also moved up to Taif at the end of June, and, according to the Umm-al-Qura of the 30th June, was to resume its session, which had been adjourned on the 29th June, on the 8th July in its summer- quarters. 136. A decree was issued at the end of June exempting passengers to Taif by motor-car from road (“ koshan ”) taxes up to the first week in October. 137. The Hyderabad textile industry scheme (see paragraph 58 (d) of the report for April last) rather unexpectedly took a long step forward with the arrival from India by the steamship Jehangir on the 17th July of a quantity of machinery, believed to be looms, and a number of bales of cotton. Further details are lacking of the materials which, at the end of the month, were lying in the customs warehouse at Jedda awaiting permission for entry into the country free of customs duty, a permission the Saudi authorities show no great alacrity to grant. The stuff is addressed to Dr. Moin-ud-Din, who, together with two weavers, is reported to have come on pilgrimage this year and remained on in Medina. It is understood that official permission for their work, the weaving of “ ihrams,” has already been secured. 138. On the 10th July an official announcement was made by Government decree published a little unusually by special supplement of the Umm-aZ-Qura of that date, concerning the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to the Standard Oil Company of California (reference paragraph 109 of last report). The decree appeared alone, and inter alia contained a reference to an agreement; defined the area of the concession vaguely, as “the eastern portion of our Saudi Arab Kingdom, within the frontiers”; and also alluded to a special agreement which was to supplement the main agreement. The terms of the concession were2 published in two instalments in the Umm-al-Qura, of the 14th and the 21st July, and constituted a document of thirty-three articles. The concession, which is for a period of sixty years, is to come into force as from the 7th July, 1933, and active operations were contemplated for the end of September 1933. Payments, designated in the Arabic text “ loans,” are to be made by the company in two lump sums, the first upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, and the 1 second a year later. In addition, an annual payment, termed “rent,” is to be paid, commencing from fifteen days from the coming into force of the agreement, viz., the 22nd July, 1933, and continuing up to the date of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. Royalties are fixed at 4s. gold per ton net weight of crude oil, or the equivalent in United States currency on certain terms, and an annual payment in kind to the Saudi Government of “ about ” 200,000 gallons petrol plus “about ” 100,000 gallons kerosene, free of all charge, is agreed upon. Provision is made for the eventual erection of refineries, termination of the contract, &amp;c. Mr. Hamilton, who stated on his departure for London on the 31st May that he expected to return here in two months' time, is still away and there is little news of his intended movements. Rumour has it, however, that the first instalment of the ‘ ‘ loan '' is to be paid next month, and that arrangements have already been made for the shipment on the 4th August from London (or Holland) of a large sum in specie. 139. (Reference paragraph 82.) Both the National Bank and the Jedda- Mecca railway schemes appear to be in the doldrums, as they have given no signs of life during the month. 140. The activity over the water-supply at Waziriya, noted in para graph 111 of the last report, has continued with some success. The water was led through the old underground water-channel to within about half a mile of Jedda (that is, a distance of approximately 11 miles), where an obstacle was encountered and a stoppage in the flow resulted. It is considered that the set-back is only temporary. Meanwhile, the Indian medical officer attached to the Legation conducted an analysis of the water, which he pronounces to be normally safe at source. 141. By notification direct to shipping agents in Jedda, the Director of the Quarantine Administration announced that as from the 20th July the Saudi Government would increase the tonnage dues in force at this port by 100 per cent, in respect of all shipping calling here. The dues hitherto levied were 4 p.T. per 10 tons for the first 500 tons, p.T. per 10 tons for the second 500 tons, and the balance at 1^ p.T. per 10 tons—registered net tonnage in each case. The increase will involve for example for the Khedivial Mail Line, whose ships calling here average 900 tons, an additional sum of about £2 10s. per visit, or, they estimate, approximately £250 per annum. The agents of the Khedivial Mail Line here have protested, and other companies have followed suit. 142. The misgivings in regard to the situation in Asir vented in the last report (paragraph 114) proved all too justified by events. Although the province as a whole remained quiescent, and although there was no armed clash between Saudi and Imamic forces on the southern frontier, yet the latter were reported to have been actively engaged with the tribes of the Najran district, an area claimed by both Ibn Saud and Imam Yahya. The situation is delicate, and with so many combustible elements involved, the immediate prospects of avoiding a serious flare- up are not very encouraging. The question, which now largely turns on relations with the Yemen, will be treated at greater length below (paragraph 148). 143. Towards the end of the month a decree was issued authorising the formation of a Board of Education, composed of five officials, of whom the most important is the Acting Director of Education, as President. 144. On the 14th July, the Umm-al-Qura published an official decree announcing the Government’s intention to deal drastically with the problem of mendicancy in the Hejaz, particularly in the Holy Cities, where the condition of the beggars, a multitude of unclean, verminous and offensive creatures, was a reproach to all good (and clean) Moslems and a defilement of the sacred places Beggars and the unemployed generally were to depart to their homes, either in this country or abroad. It is not yet known how thoroughly this edict is being followed up. The question, in so far as it concerns British subjects and protected persons, bears a relation to the question of the enforced adoption of Saudi nationality adverted to in paragraph 123 of the June report. The situation, therefore, is being carefully watched (see paragraph 151).II .—F rontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 145. Fuad Bey Hamza had two further conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan in connexion with the Saudi-Transjordan negotiations at Jerusalem (see paragraph 117 of the last report), the first conversation taking place on the 2nd July and the final one on the 11th, the day before Fuad Bey sailed for Egypt on his way to the conference. He was seen off at the landing-stage by Sir Andrew Ryan, other members of the diplomatic body and Saudi officials in Jedda. He was followed on the 16th July by Sir Andrew Ryan, who travelled via Port Sudan. The conference, which was to commence on the 24th, was successful, and the treaty was signed at Jerusalem on the 27th July. A message of congratulation from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom was communicated to the Saudi Government by His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires, and a cordial acknowledgment was promptly received in reply. 146 An echo of the Ibn Rifada revolt of May-June 1932 gave rise to a little uncertainty when it was reported from Jerusalem that Selim Abu Dumeik, a chieftain of the Beni Atiya, who had been removed early in the year to Palestine as a measure of precaution, had evaded surveillance at Beersheba on or about the 10th July, that he was believed to be heading for Transjordan, and that an intensive search was being made for him. The information was communicated by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in a personal letter to Emir Feisal, who replied at once informing Mr. Calvert that Abu Dumeik had already arrived at the Saudi frontier, had sued for and had been granted pardon by Ibn Saud. He has since been lost to view, but his movements appear to cause the Saudi Government no anxiety. 147. About the same time a personage whose activities are viewed with much more concern by Ibn Saud also gave occasion for some enquiry. Khalid-bin-Hithlain, a young and warlike chief of the Ajman who was implicated in the rebellion of 1929, was stated by Fuad Bey Hamza in a personal letter to Sir Andrew Ryan to be making preparations to enter Saudi Arabia with evil intent from Koweit, and it is said that his agents were busy assembling- supplies in Koweit and Bahrein for the purpose. It was soon established that Khalid-bin-Hithlain was somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kerbela, far enough away from the scene of his alleged activities, and that there was no sign of his agents at either Koweit or Bahrein, whose rulers, moreover, readily gave assurances that preventive measures, were they ever necessary, would be promptly taken. This information was conveyed to the Saudi Government and evoked a grateful response. 148. Relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen (see paragraph 121 of the last report) have rapidly and seriously deteriorated during the month. On the 20th July Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, used as a go-between in the absence of Fuad Bey Hamza, called on His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and delivered a message from Ibn Saud for His Majesty’s Government, intimating that negotia tions between the delegations at Sana, opened on the 17th, had immediately broken down owing to the inordinate demands of the Imam. These demands, which included the restitution of the territories of the Idrisi, and the districts of the Beni Qahtan and Hamazan, coupled with the consistently hostile attitude of Imamic forces in Najran, and the asylum afforded the Idrisi in the Yemen, had fired Ibn Saud with feelings of the most intense distrust. He charged the Imam with bad faith, breach of the treaty between them and deliberate provocation Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman alleged that the Imam and the Idrisi were receiving- help in the shape of arms and munitions from “foreign ” sources, and stated he had come to ask for the advice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in view of the old friendship subsisting between the two Governments. He left with Mr. Calvert a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which much the same thing was said in good set terms, the “foreign’’ sources being roundly declared to be Italian, proof of which was in the hands of the Saudi Government. The note also asked for assistance in the matter of supplies. 149. His Majesty’s Government responded, in a note delivered by Mr. Calvert on the 27th July, by urging counsels of moderation and by drawing attention to the risks inseparable from an outbreak of hostilities. At the same time the note made the position of His Majesty’s Government, in the event of hostilities, quite clear as one of strict neutrality. Appropriate steps were also taken through Rome to enlist the co-operation of the Italian Government in a [879 aa—1] B 2mammmmmmm i •i ^ policy of assuagement with the Imam Yahya, a support which was readily promised. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman paid a further visit to Jedda on the 30th July, and saw Mr. Calvert on that day and again on the 1st August, when, to anticipate the report for next month, he had to impart the serious news that the Saudi delegation was being forcibly detained in Sana, and that no communication was permitted between the delegates and their own Government, or, indeed, the outside world. This new development, which had only come to their knowledges the day before through the receipt of a telegram in cypher to an intermediary here purporting to have been sent by Hamad Suleiman, the Minister of Finance s brother and a member of the delegation, through an intermediary in Sana, was characterised by Abdulla Suleiman as contrary to civilised usage and neighbour liness. Ibn Saud, who was further incensed, asked that it be brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government, pointing out the impossible situation into which he was being manoeuvred. The month ended with steadily rising temperatures, at least in Saudi Arabia, and unless some olive branch be oft'ered, and offered quickly, by the Imam Yahya, all the sedative and restraining counsels that can be offered will be of little avail. 150. On the 13th July, a note was received from the Saudi Government to the effect that about the third week in June two men of the Arab Legion in Transjordan seized a number of camels belonging to the Sherarat, grazing at Dair-al-Bid, drove them off and threatened the tribesmen with seizure of camels whenever they grazed in that district. The matter was referred to the authorities in Transjordan for enquiries. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 151. It will be readily understood from foregoing paragraphs that Anglo- Saudi relations continue very friendly. The report at paragraph 123 of last report that pressure was being brought to bear on British subjects and British- protected persons from Africa to adopt Saudi nationality, is thought to have been well-founded, but Sir Andrew Ryan's note seems to have had a salutary influence, as complaints, formerly numerous, have now almost, though not entirely, ceased. A development of this, and of the campaign to clear the country of idle and worthless foreigners (reference paragraph 144), is the refusal to renew the licences of foreign chauffeurs, driving Government-owned motor vehicles. There is a steadily growing volume of complaints on this score. 152. On the 24th July His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad reported that a flying-boat of the Royal Air Force had been forced by engine trouble to alight within Saudi territorial waters, and was lying off the Jinna Islands on the Hasa coast. A spare engine was flown down on the following day in view of the risk to the flying-boat and crew, a second infringement of Saudi sovereignty being involved. The Legation was subsequently informed through the sloop H.M.S. Bideford, which was also standing by, and by the Political Resident, Bushire, that the flying-boat got away safely on the 29th. The Saudi Government was immediately informed of the occurrence, and was notified of subsequent develop ments, but it was not until the 29th that a reply was received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs noting the information, expressing regret at the unavoidable incident and concern for the safety of the machine and crew—an unsually complaisant attitude. 153. The Umm-al-Qura of the 7th July announced that the Saudi Govern ment had received an invitation from the Egyptian Government to be represented at the forthcoming International Postal Conference to be held at Cairo. The invitation is stated to have been accepted. IV.— Miscellaneous. 154. Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan left Jedda on the 16th July on leave of absence. They were to spend a few days at Jerusalem on their way home in connexion with the Saudi-Transjordan Conference. 155. Nasir Bey-el-Gaylani, the Acting Iraqi Charge d'Affaires, went on leave on the 5th July, leaving a clerk in charge of consular work only. 156. On the 2nd July, Sir Andrew Ryan asked Fuad Bey Hamza what the attitude of the Saudi Government would be if an English clergyman wished tovisit Jedda to hold a service for the British community. This problem had engaged the attention of the Legation for some time in consequence of a suggestion by the Bishop in Egypt and the Sudan that such a visit should be paid by a clergyman at Port Said. Sir Andrew Ryan had formed the opinion that ^here need be no objection subject to great discretion as regards the arrangements and provided that means could be found to obtain a visa for entry into the Hejaz some time next winter. The matter was precipitated by the receipt at the end of June of a telegram from the chaplain at Port Sudan offering to come over and hold a service on the 9th July. As this telegram was sent en clair, Sir Andrew Ryan felt that there was no alternative but to put a direct question to Fuad Bey. The latter replied most categorically that no non-Moslem minister of religion could be admitted for any purpose. Sir Andrew Ryan informed the chaplain at Port Sudan accordingly through the commissioner there, and reported the facts to the Foreign Office. 157. The sloop, H.M.S. Hastings, Captain C. S. Sandford, O.B.E., R.N., arrived from Port Sudan on the 6th July and left again for Suez on the 9th. During the visit the Jedda cricket team regained the ashes. 158. The British community in Jedda w^ere grieved to learn during the month that M. van Leeuwen, the Dutch financial adviser to the Saudi Government, who recently left this country on retirement for reasons of ill-health, died at Amsterdam on the 7th July. 159. Messrs. Tallents and Anderson, two members of the firm which manages the Orient Line, paid a flying visit to Jedda on the 9th July on the steamship Talodi. 160. A new doctor, whose name is given as George, arrived during the month from Russia, and is attached to the Soviet Legation in the room of M. Morsen, the dentist, who recently left, it is said, for the Yemen. Dr. George is accompanied by his wife. 161. The Frenchwoman (reference paragraph 127 of last report) acquitted of the charge of poisoning her Arab husband left Jedda by the steamship Taif on the 5th July. Her departure from the landing-stage in the French consulate launch did not pass unnoticed—she was a pathetic figure simply dressed in her widow’s weeds. It is learned that this “femme fatale,” still known to the Levantine press as Mme. d'Andhurin, has since acquired another husband. 162. Salvage work has been proceeding for some time on the French Fabre Line steamship Asia, the melancholy wreck lying on the reefs in the roads of Jedda. So far a little over 300 tons of coal of an inferior quality has been recovered, and will, it is supposed, be the property of the Saudi Government, as any claim to the wreck by those originally interested has been abandoned long ago. 163. A curious case, so far the first of its kind, arose during the month when two girls, aged 16 and 13, took refuge in the Legation declaring themselves to be slaves. The family from which they had fled claimed them through the local authorities as daughters of the family who had never been slaves. The Legation refused to hand the girls over without an enquiry, which, however, when held (without the collaboration of the Saudi authorities), proved the self-styled slave- girls to be imposters and the relatives to be in the right in demanding them back as mere naughty and recalcitrant runaways. 164. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in July was as follows :— On hand at beginning of month : One male. Took refuge in July : None. Manumitted in July and repatriated : One male. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at end of month : None. It has not been possible without fresh evidence to proceed further with the case of the two children of the man in Kamaran (reference paragraph 133 of last report), as the Saudi Government inform the Legation that the daughter is now married and free, whilst the son, who was free, has been resold into slavery.wmm* INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quol No - 6 and address —not (o any person by name,\)ut to — f' f' ’ P'' s'* 5 bob L 'p.zT^l ^ to ^ “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, THE Under-Secretary of State J&lt;§ JofSign Affairs presents his compliments to and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copvjLo of the under-mentioned paper.

He held the usual formal reception, and on the 11th June gave Sir Andrew Ryan a business audience at which the main subject of discussion was the Transjordan frontier negotiations (see paragraph 117 below). His Majesty received his intending biographer, Captain F. H. C. Armstrong, no less than five times and discoursed to him freely for over ten hours in all, not only of war, &amp;c., but of love, also of the many errors into which other writers, including Messrs. Philby and Ameen Rihani, had fallen. Fuad Bey Hamza acted a good deal as interpreter and as sub-inspirer, but the most notable feature of the varying company at the interviews was the frequent presence of Ibn Saud’s brother, Abdullah, on whose memory he seemed to rely for much. The King left Mecca for Riyadh on the 21st June and arrived on the 25th June. He will probably spend the rest of the year in Nejd. 107. The excitement over the appointment of an Heir Apparent has died away, but may be responsible for a report from one source early in June that Ibn Saud contemplated abdication in the Amir’s favour. The King himself spoke to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 10th June of his hope of being able to delegate work, e.g., in regard to Bedouin affairs, to the Amir a year or two hence. 108. The Amir Feisal attracted no attention during the month until he went into summer residence at Taif on the 25th June. Fuad Bey Hamza attended three times at the Jedda branch of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Sheikh Yussuf Yassin returned from leave in Syria on the 25th June, much pleased with the attention he had been shown in Jerusalem, and went straight to Mecca, en route for Riyadh to join his master. 109. There were no further developments in connexion with the economic schemes mentioned in paragraph 82 of the last report. Some regard the National Bank scheme as already dead. The oil negotiations in regard to Hasa seem to have stimulated interest in other oil possibilities. On the 4th June Fuad Bey brought a confidential message to Sir Andrew Ryan from the King to the effect that he had been approached by Italian interests, working through a representa tive in Cairo, regarding the possibility of a concession for Asir and the Farsan Islands. The King intimated that, now as always, he preferred to do business with the British, and asked whether any British group was likely to be interested in this proposition. He was doubtless thinking back to the time when Shell started operations through a subsidiary in the Farsans, but abandoned them in circumstances now only of historical interest. 110. The further instalment of the Umm-al-Qura account of the agreement with Mr. Philby’s company (see paragraph 83 of the last report) threw little further light on it. The Government undertake that during the term of the agreement, which is to be ten years, all cars imported for their use and that of authorised transport concerns, except cars for their special use and heavy lorries, shall be Fords. Sharqieh (Limited) are to have the first refusal of orders for9 cars for special Government use and for lorries on terms equal to those offered by other vendors. Although private persons may import cars of any make, it is provided in this contract that they shall not ply for hire. The company get a monopoly of all import of tyres and other accessories. They undertake to provide service stations at Mecca, Jedda, Medina, Riyadh and other places to be agp*^p upon. Conditions are laid down for the fixation of prices of tyres, &amp;c., but not, in the published summary, of those of the actual cars. The margin over factory prices allowed in the case of the former appears very small to cover overhead expenses, depreciation and profit. All goods supplied to the Government and the transport companies are to be charged to an account payable out of 50 per cent, of the receipts of the Naqaba or Government organisation in control of transport. It is considered doubtful whether the contract is a feasible business proposition, and there is no news up to date of Mr. Philby’s success in his efforts to obtain financial backing. He has gone on from Egypt to England. 111. There has been a revival of interest in the scheme for supplying Jedda with water from Waziriya (see paragraph 167 of the report for May-June 1932). The Government have enlisted the expert, though not apparently, the financial assistance of the capable Ain Zubeyda Committee in Mecca. A leading member of this committee, a highly respectable Indian of Mecca, claims to have discovered an underground stream of fresh water much superior to the brackish well-water raised by Mr. TwitchelTs windmill. In the latter half of June a gang of over 100 labourers from Mecca were employed on the underground works. 112. A regulation prescribing additions to the two schedules of goods subject to specific duties and the goods subject to increased ad valorem duties (see paragraphj£4 of the last report) was published on the 23rd June. 113. There was no visible change in the financial situation in June. 114. The internal situation continued to be peaceful, as far as could be judged. Ibn Musaid, Governor of Hail and cousin to the King, who had been in charge of the operations in Asir, arrived in Mecca on the 13th June and left for Hail on the 24th June. It is claimed that he had not only repressed the rebellion, but had reorganised the Administration. The appointment of new Governors at Abha, to which place Turki-as-Sdayri, a relative on the maternal side of Ibn Saud has been transferred from Jauf, and at Jizan was announced on the 23rd June. The Umm-al-Qura has published much about the present and past of Asir, insisting on the thesis that the theatre of the rebellion was not Asir proper but the districts of Sabya, Jizan and Abu Arish, which are more correctly called Tihamat Asir, the littoral region as opposed to the inland region of Asir proper or Asir Surat. Tihamat Asir, the former territory of the Idrisi, now becomes a province to be ruled by the Governor at Jizan assisted by a council under the general supervision of the Governor at Abha. Although all seems so stable in Asir, a feeling of misgiving persists in many quarters. It was intensified in June by reports that quite important forces were again being sent thither both by land and by sea. A launch, which the Government bought some years ago through Mr. Philby, and which was long thought to be useless, was put into working order some little time ago and has been running to and from Jizan. It is hard to judge whether the forces sent are reinforcements with a view to possible fighting, replacements of casualties and cases of disease or reliefs. It is possible that the despatch of troops is a result of the alleged tension in the hinterland (see paragraph 121 below). 115. Before leaving for Riyadh the King approved of several other appoint ments to provincial governorates, notably in the region near the Transjordan frontier, where there has been a considerable redistribution of posts. He also conferred a title equivalent to that of Poet Laureate on Ahmed Ibrahim-al- Ghazzawi, the Secretary of the Legislative Council and a well-known versifier and publicist. No mention was made of a salary, much less a butt of sack, to inspire his further efforts. Pegasus treads on air, unaided by such stimulants in Arabia. amendment to the existing regulations on firearms was published on the 2nd June It was not as a whole important, but it provided that licences to carry arms should not be issued to foreigners except on production of a certificate froin the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. A regulation on the practice ot medicine pharmacy, &amp;e., by private persons was published on the 8th June. It is not illiberal m conception, but it is too soon to judge of its practical effects, if it should have any.[851 u—1] b 2 3 II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 117. Sir Andrew Ryan s conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza regarding the projected Saudi—Transjordan settlement (see paragraph 91 ot the last report) ^_|vprp continued on the 4th and 20th June with satisfactory results. The question ✓ ,f a working agreement on tribal nationality still presents difficulty, especially as regards the Sirhan tribe. When Sir Andrew Ryan outlined the state of the negotiations to Ibn Saud on the 11th June, His Majesty made light of all obstacles and dismissed the question of the Sirhan as one which could easily be disposed of by a comparison of evidence. It was clear on the 20th June that Fuad Bey’s cue was to get on with the final settlement at almost any cost. He and Sir Andrew Ryan agreed that so little remained for discussion except matters of drafting that the second stage of the formal negotiations might safely be proceeded with, and it was decided in principle to suggest a meeting of delegates in Jerusalem on the 24th July. His Majesty’s Government and the High Commissioner have since concurred in this proposal. In the last days of June Sir Andrew Ryan prepared from copious evidence adduced in Amman a memorandum justifying on historical and other grounds the Transjordan claim to the Sirhan tribe. At the end of the month two or three incidental matters were under consideration, the most important being a suggestion that the actual signature of the texts to be agreed in Jerusalem might take place at Amman. 118. On the 10th June the Saudi Government produced another complaint similar to that mentioned in paragraph 92 of the last report regarding the alleged killing of two persons by men of the Arab Legion on the 15th May. Sir iVndrew Ryan replied that in his opinion it could be assumed that any report of unprovoked killing was unfounded, and asked for various particulars. 119. The principal development as between Iraq and Saudi Arabia during the month was what appears to be a satisfactory settlement of the question of Hashimite properties. A rescript addressed by Ibn Saud to the Amir Feisal orders the removal of the restrictions previously imposed on the properties of all Ashraf, with the exception of the Sherif Khalid, who was implicated in anti- Saudi conspiracies last year. 120. The statement in paragraph 94 of the last report relative to the conclusion of an agreement between Iraq and Saudi Arabia regarding the proposed motor-route from Nejef to Medina was premature. The Iraq Govern ment completed the necessary surveys on their side some time ago, but the Saudi Government have not yet notified the completion of similar surveys on their side. 121. The Saudi mission to San’a had made little or no progress when last heard of owing apparently to the further illness of the Imam. There have been definite rumours of Yemeni military activity in Najran. Fuad Bey told Sir Andrew Ryan on the 20th J une that there was no official confirmation of these reports, but that if they were true a serious situation would arise. He defined the Saudi contention as being that the frontier settlement which, in their view, was reached by the mission that went to San’a in 1927, gave Najran to Ibn Saud and left the bulk of the Beni Yam country which Fuad Bey identified with the geographical area of Jauf to the Imam (see paragraph 93 of the last report, and paragraph 114 above). 122. On the 4th June Fuad Bey told Sir Andrew Ryan that Ibn Saud had written a letter to the Sheikh of Koweit making a proposal which, if agreed to, could subsequently be made official, for the adjustment of their commercial relations. Reports from Koweit show that this letter reached the sheikh on the 16th June and proved to be very obscure. The proposal appeared to be that, if the sheikh would levy the same import duties as those charged in Hasa ports, Ibn Saud would allow the caravans from Koweit to enter Nejd on payment only of a moderate tax to the same amount as one formerly levied by the tribal sheikhs in Ibn Rashid’s time. The sheikh considered the proposal unacceptable, but His Majesty’s Government have suggested that it is worth exploring. No attempt can be made in Jedda to appreciate its true character, but two points are worth noting, viz., (a) the King appears to have suggested to the sheikh that they should settle the matter by a direct deal and not through the British, who could not be trusted; and (b) the reference to Hasa ports suggests that Ibn Saud persists in his hope of developing one or more ports on that coast and cutting out Bahrein. (Cf. paragraph 96 of the last report, the subject of which remains in the same position, so far as the Legation is concerned.)-Mir--' 4 III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 123. Anglo-Saudi relations continued to be eminently friendly under the influence of the strong desire of both sides to let nothing cloud the prospects of a settlement of the Transjordan question. Other questions were discusseij^* in Sir Andrew Ryan’s conversations with the King and Fuad Bej^ but without insistence on either side. Apart from those adverted to elsewhere, the most important was that of landing grounds for air craft on the Hasa coast (see paragraph 378 of the report for November- December), which formed the subject of a most unsatisfactory counter memorandum handed by Fuad Bey to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 20th June. This awaits elucidation and discussion. Just before the end of the month anxiety was caused by reports that pressure was being brought to bear on British subjects and British-protected persons from Africa to adopt Saudi nationality and/or to enlist in the army under pain of expulsion. Sir Andrew Ryan wrote a cautionary note on the subject to the Amir Feisal on the 30th June. 124. Nothing important is known of the proceedings of other foreign representatives in June, except as regards the Iraqi success over Hashimite properties (see paragraph 119). The Soviet Minister was again much in Mecca. The French Charge was more of a hermit than ever, although he did appear at the King’s birthday party at the British Legation. The corps continues to disinteg rate as summer advances. The Italian Minister and the Turkish Charge left according to plan. The former left in charge M. Tonci, an old colleague of the writer in Morocco. He is very impressive in the Fascist vein, but has so far had no spectacular opportunity of showing what he could do if the hair of a single Italian were touched by Saudi Arabs. The Egyptian consul also went on leave, leaving things very much as they have been for a long time past between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The new Czechoslovak consul is favourably described in a letter from Jerusalem, which shows inter alia that he is also consul for Iraq and that he may visit Jedda in the autumn. 125. Enquiries by the Saudi Minister in London led the Foreign Office to address to the Legation on the 17th May an important restatement of the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding the possible entry of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations. The general conclusion from a fresh review of pros and cons was that, if the Saudi Government should again approach the Legation, its attitude should be one of complete but sympathetic neutrality; readiness to help with information; and avoidance of any language tending to minimise obstacles or to encourage the Saudi Government io proceed hastily. As a matter of fact, the Saudi Government have not pursued this question in Jedda for nearly two years (see paragraph 49 of the report for July and August 1931). IV .—M iscellaneous. 126. The reception at the Legation on the 3rd June in honour of the King’s birthday was attended by over 110 persons, a very varied collection of British subjects, members of foreign missions and local notables. 127. The Frenchwoman mentioned in paragraph 101 of the last report was released on acquittal about the 28th June, and has since been a guest in the French consulate pending a departure which it is hoped will end a peculiarly foolish and squalid story. 128. Some attention was aroused by the execution in Mecca on or about the 8th June of three persons for robbery with murder. Torture was said to have been used, and it is alleged that a fourth man died under the lash. It was not usual to inflict capital punishment in Mecca under the Turkish and Hashimite regimes. The Wahhabi view appears to be the better the place, the better the work of justice. 129. Captain F. H. C. Armstrong fell seriously ill in Jedda just after the series of audiences mentioned in paragraph 106 above. He was embarked for Port Sudan under medical advice and under the care of Mr. Twitchell on the 18th June. He is making a good but slow recovery in hospital at Port Sudan. 130. There are some indications of an inclination on the part of the Saudi Government to buy British. Early in the month they were reported to be enquiring about aircraft hangars at about £800 apiece, and about shower-baths possibly for pilgrim sanitation. luad Bey also mentioned to Sir Andrew Ryanw v 5 on the 20th June a proposal to buy 3 million rounds of Lee-hnfield cartiidges / through Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited). 131. The organisers in India of the proposed hastern Olympic Games have made various efforts to interest Saudi Arabian sportsmen in their project through ■^official channels. On the 6th June the Legation forwarded through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a letter addressed by the Maharaja of Patiala to Ibn Saud on the subject. 132. Pilgrimage work during the month consisted principally of winding up odds and ends and preparing the annual pilgrimage report. The Indian vice- consul left for Istanbul on long leave on the 14th June. 133. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in June was as follows :— Males. On hand at beginning of month ... ... 6 Took refuge in June ... ... ... 2 Manumitted in June and repatriated ... 7 Locally manumitted ... ... ... Nil On hand at end of month ... ... ... 1 The Legation has taken up with the Saudi Government a case of the alleged resale into slavery not far from Jedda of a young man and a young woman whose father, now at Kamaran, declares that he and they were manumitted by their owner some years ago. Another case of the alleged sale of an ostensible wife by an Abyssinian pilgrim is under consideration, but the evidence is probably too weak to justify action.In any further communication on this subject, please quote n °- irawt.'* and address —not to any person oy name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for 78. Ibn Saud spent the month in Mecca. He came to Jedda on the 3rd May for two days and the intervening night, and received the Transjordan mission on the morning of his arrival. 79. The Amir Feisal remained in Mecca until the 17th May, when he left with other princes, &amp;c., for Riyadh (see paragraph 81). He returned to Mecca on the 28th May. Fuad Bey Hamza returned to Mecca on the day of the Transjordan mission’s departure, but has since adhered faithfully to his rule of attending the Jedda branch of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs once a week. The Iraqi jurist Muwaffaq-al-Alusi, who entered Ibn Saud’s service last November, was appointed legal adviser to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, quarrelled with Fuad Bey, and became counsellor to the King at Riyadh, left apparently for good in May. 80. The most important event of the month was the designation of the King’s eldest surviving son as Heir Apparent to the throne. This has clearly required much preparation in. the royal family, tribal circles and other milieux, since the date of the decree of the 18th September, 1932, which unified the kingdom and provided, inter alia, for arrangements to be made for the succession. The procedure followed would appear to be the resultant of much study of historical precedents and perhaps of some conflict of principles. Its essential feature was the swearing of a baya or oath of fealty, which assumed definite form on the 11th May, when the oath, in documentary form, was signed by the Amir Feisal as President of the Council, the members of that Council and certain other dignitaries, religious and civil. It received the King’s assent the same day, and was confirmed by the people of the Hejaz on the 15th May, when the Amir Feisal and local Governors received the baya of all and sundry persons of any notability. The Heir Apparent himself was not present at Mecca. 81. On the 17th May the Amir Feisal, with a number of junior princes and certain other delegates, left for Riyadh to deliver the documents containing the Hejazi baya and take part in a further ceremonial there. This took place on the 22nd May, and was generally similar to that in Mecca a week before. It was noted as of special importance that the Amir Muhammad, the King’s slightly elder or somewhat younger brother, was the first to perform the baya. Among the others present were the head of the Araif branch of the family and the Amirs of the House of Rashid. The only important royalty not present was the King’s second brother, the Amir Abdullah, who, however, wrote a loyal letter excusing himself on the ground that the King had ordered him to stay 3469/902/25] EASTERN (Arabia).

The ceremonial included the reading of a letter from the King to his heir amplifying the injunctions and advice which he had already addressed to him by telegraph. f 82. Nothing further was heard in Jedda during May of the progress ol the National Bank and M ecca-Jedda Ra ilway schemes. 1 he battle for the Hasa petroleum concession ended m the last week of the month. In^ representatives of the Iraq Petroleum Company left Jedda at a moment s noti on the 24th May. On the 29th May Mr. Hamilton, the representative ot the Standard Oil Company of California, signed an agreement with the Minister ot Finance, subject to ratification by both sides. No definite information is available regarding the text, which is not to be published until a ^ r but it is stated that the company have agreed to pay a lump sum of £50,000 gold at the outset, a tidy price for rights the value of which is admitted to be still entirely problematical. , 83. Mr. Philby, acting expressly on behalf of Sharqieh (Limited), secured, early in the month, the contract foreshadowed in paragraph 59 of the last report. He left on the 18th May for Egypt and England, to make financial and other arrangements. The first part of a summary of the contract published on the 26th May confirms generally the forecast in the last report. The contract ^ or ten years. As the published summary had not been completed by the 31st May, further particulars are reserved for the next report. 84. A communique published on the 12th May regarding this agreement modified the communique mentioned in paragraph 59 of the last report to t e extent of authorising the importation by individuals of cars of any make tor their private use, but a clause in the agreement with Sharqieh prohibits their being plied for hire. . „ . 85. The Saudi Government brought into force, on the 4th May, a new customs tariff, which was published on the following day. Its most notable feature is the introduction of specific duties per unit on a large range or staple commodities, including food-stuffs, piece-goods, sugar and petroleum products. A d valorem duties, at rates which, in nearly all cases, show a heavy increase, are retained for a limited number of commodities, the most important of which are motor vehicles, perfumes, silk, raw and manufactured cotton and metal goods. Various small surtaxes levied previously have been suppressed. It is difficult, in a market so ill-equipped and so inarticulate, to judge of the effect of the new tariff as a whole, but such estimates as can be made point to an increase, in most cases heavy, practically all along the line. This may be offset to some small extent by the advantage of having to pay duties of known amount m most cases instead of having them assessed on the results of ignorant and perhaps dishonest valuaUon^ithou , the fi nanc i a l situation of the Saudi Government continues to be precarious, money appears to be available to meet current obligations, as opposed to the old debts, payment of which was postponed for a year last November. The Directorate-General of Posts and Telegraphs performed, early in May the tour de force of remitting to the Eastern Telegraph Company a sum more than sufficient to cover the balance due on cable account at the end ot April. Backwardness in effecting the contractual monthly settlement has hitherto been a constant cause of complaint. Official salaries are being paid as to one-third m cash and one-third in commodity, the remaining third being apparently held over. 87 The Dutch financial adviser, whom the Saudi Government engaged tor one vear early in 1932, left Jedda for good on the 18th May, having accomplished nothing during his two sojourns in the Hejaz and having greatly suffered in health There is no room for a European financial adviser in a country the finances of which are run on his own lines by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. 88. There has been no known change in the situation m Asir since paragraph 61 of the last report was written. Two officials of some importance were despatched to that province late in May on a tour of inspection of customs, &amp;c. One of these, Sayyid Hashim, is known as a confidential agent qt the King for certain purposes, and it is suggested that the real object of his mission is to assess the state of tribal feeling. Ibn Musaid Governor of Hail, who was sent to Asir during the rebellion and remained to reorganise the country, has reached Bisha on his return journey, having it is said, completed his task.II -—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 89. The negotiations for a treaty settlement between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan (see paragraph 63 of the last report) were pursued actively in Jedda from the 23rd April to the 4th May inclusive. The main basis of discussion was three drafts of a Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage,” an Arbitration Protocol and an hxtradition Treaty modelled with necessary alterations on the ^similar agreements concluded between Saudi Arabia and Iraq in April 1931. It ^Vas realised that certain other matters would have to be provided for in ancillary texts, notably the question of a working arrangement for the determination of tribal nationality, arrangements of detail for the collaboration of frontier officers and the notes to be exchanged between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government in fulfilment of the promise given by the former to accept responsibility for the performance of obligations entered into by the Amir Abdullah and his Government. 90. It became evident in the course of the negotiations that it would be impossible to negotiate an Extradition Treaty containing the safeguards considered essential by His Majesty’s Government and the Transjordan Govern ment in regard to political offences and judicial procedure. The Saudi delegates eventually agreed to postpone such a treaty indefinitely. This cleared the way for the practical completion of the draft Treaty of' Friendship and “ Bon- Voisinage” and a draft Arbitration Protocol. Ibn Saud appeared anxious that these instruments should be signed before the Transjordan mission left. So much progress was made on the 3rd May, after his arrival in Jedda that morning, that it looked in the evening as though this might be accomplished. By next morning, however, the Saudi Government had decided to go slow, and it was agreed to postpone the proceedings, in accordance with the agreement reached in the earlier diplomatic discussions that if the conference could not reach a final result in Jedda it should be resumed later in Jerusalem. The mission left on the 5th May. 91. The atmosphere of the conference was excellent. The Saudi delegates mastered successfully on the whole their natural tendency towards meticulousness over minor details. They used various devices to try and emphasise the inferior status which they attribute to the Amir Abdullah, but yielded to firm resistance on the other side to anything in the nature of a formal recognition of inequality between the parties. Since the departure of the mission friendly conversations have taken place between His Majesty’s Minister and Fuad Bey with a view to so reducing the number of contentious questions still outstanding as to ensure the success of the second stage of the negotiations, which it has been agreed to hold in the latter part of July, if possible. This should be feasible, subject to an agreement of some sort, which may have to reserve a small number of specially difficult cases, in regard to tribal nationality. The greatest difficulty arises over the Sirhan tribe, who have long been settled in Transjordan, but have certain rights of property in the Wadi Sirhan and frequent a part of it for winter grazing. Their grazing rights have recently been interfered with by the Governor of Qaf, and their rights of property may be endangered if a settlement cannot be reached. 92. No raids were reported from the frontier during May. The Saudi Government complained of the killing of a man earlier in the year bv a Transjordanian police patrol. The incident was already known to the Legation, which returned an immediate interim reply to the effect that the man had lost his life after attacking the patrol in a ravine. 93. Relations between Iraq and Saudia Arabia appear to be normal. The question of Hashimite properties (paragraph 65 of last report) is not so advanced as the acting Iraqi Charge d’Affaires seemed to hope in April. This and the failure of the Saudi Government to send a representative to Bagdad were amono- the more important Iraqi grievances set forth in the Bagdad Saut-al-Iraq of the 19th April, and reproduced with a conciliatory rejoinder in the Mecca Umm-al- Qura of the 15th May. Rushaid Pasha, who was appointed Saudi Charge d’Affaires amd consul-general at Bagdad in 1931, but never proceeded, has now been made Saudi consul in Damascus. A new appointment to Bagdad was made in May, the person chosen being Ibrahim-bin-Muammer, who has°held the posts of head of Divan to the King and the Amir Saud. It was announced in the Umm-al-Qura of the 26th May that representatives of Saudi Arabia and Iraq were to meet at Jauf to discuss various outstanding frontier incidents. [823 ee—1] B om 94. Ihe agreement between the Saudi and Iraqi Governments regarding the motor-route from Nejef to Medina (see paragraph 5 of the January report) is said to have been completed, but details are not yet available. 95. Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen continue to play their diplomatic game, despite all rumours of tension and frontier trouble. Nothing further was heard in May about Hasan-al-Idrisi, nor of the final arrangements in regard to his more important brother, Abdul-Wahhab (paragraph 66 of last report). The latest news in May was that Ibn Saud had sent three officials from Jizan to San?^^ to negotiate a Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage.” The members of the mission are Khalid-al-Qarqani and Hamad Suleiman, who were sent to Asir in November to patch up a settlement there, but arrived too late, and Turki-al- Madhi, Inspector-General in Asir. The official announcement in the Umm-al- Qura was accompanied by an unofficial explanation, in reply to Yemeni criticism, of why the Saudi Government had published the letter mentioned in paragraph 21 of the report for February, and how they had come, owing to mutilation in telegraphic transmission, to omit a passage in which the Imam apparently made his consent to new negotiations conditional on their including a settlement of the frontier. This may give rise to difficulty, as the Saudi view is that the frontier has already been settled in principle and that only some sort of delimitation is needed, whereas the Imam may have pretensions to slices of Asir. 96. After full consideration of the difficulties which have been created by attempts to escape payment of transit dues at Bahrein on goods for Saudi Arabia and which culminated in the affair mentioned in paragraph 362 of the report for November-December, His Majesty’s Government decided to take up the position that the concession made to Ibn Saud in 1920 was unilateral and terminable, but that, as Bahrein and the mainland had a common interest in the trade, the situation might usefully be reviewed in the light of changed conditions at a meeting between Saudi and Bahrein representatives to be held at Bahrein with the participation of the British political agent. It was suggested that the delegates of this meeting should prepare terms of agreement ad referendum. The views of His Majesty’s Government were set forth in a note addressed by His Majesty’s Minister to the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 13th May. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied on the 21st May. The Saudi Govern ment did not contest the statement that the concession of 1920 was unilateral and terminable, but said that the incident of last November had caused them to arrange for direct transport to Ras Tanura, where port facilities had been arranged. They added that they did not wish to limit the freedom of Bahrein as regards transit dues, provided that those charged on goods for Saudi Arabia were not higher than those on goods for other destinations. This reply necessitates a further study of the whole question. 97. The contest in Jedda for the Hasa petroleum concession and the incursion of Major Holmes in April (paragraph 57 (c) of the last report) have helped to bring into prominence the possibility of secret direct negotiations between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud in regard to oil and possibly other matters. It is known that the sheikh received messages in February through a confidential agent of Ibn Saud, and he made two mysterious journeys into Nejd soon after with a party which included Major Holmes’s Arab Jackal. It is suggested that he met some high personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. The speculations which this has suggested to the Political Agent are of great interest, but it would be premature to pursue the subject in this report. In the meantime there has been no relaxation of the Saudi embargo on trade with Koweit, and Ibn Saud has emphasised his adverse attitude by again allowing the Mutair tribe to obtain supplies in Iraq. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 98. There is even less to record than there was last month. The Saudi Government have accepted an invitation to attend the World Economic Conference and have appointed their Minister in London to represent them. The foreign missions in Jedda have not been as a whole very active. The British Legation has been mainly busy with Transjordan affairs and the winding-up of 1 the pilgrimage. The Soviet Minister has been trying to put his trade arrange- ) ment (see paragraph 23 of the report for February) on a firmer basis. The Acting Iraqi Charge d’Affaires has always something on hand (see paragraphs 93o and 94 above). The Netherlands Legation has nearly finished repatriating its destitutes and the Charge went on leave on the 18th May. The Italian Minister and the Turkish Charge were aching to follow him on the 2nd June. 99. Yet another European Power has awoken to interest in Saudi Arabia. It was announced on the 19th May that the Czechoslovakian consul in Jerusalem liad forwarded papers through the Saudi consul in Damascus and had been |®ccepted as consul for Jedda. IV.— Miscellaneous . 100. The Italian cruiser Libia called at Jedda on the 6th May on her way to Italy from the Far East and left on the 8th May. There appears to be no reason to attach political significance to this visit, but the presence of so large a warship in the roads of Jedda is unusual, and the suggestion that she came to this port by arrangement with the Saudi Government to take water and supplies is singular. There were no spectacular demonstrations. 101. The Frenchwoman mentioned in paragraph 72 of the last report languished in a police cell throughout the month, sustained with victuals and Vichy water from the French consulate. It is understood that the police enquiry was terminated and that she would be put on trial before the Qadhi. The Saudi authorities are thought to be embarrassed between jealousy of their sovereign rights and fear lest the condemnation on a murder charge of a European woman however much a Nejdi by marriage, should outrage foreign opinion. The affair will almost certainly end in the woman’s deportation. If she were condemned, the execution of a woman would be repugnant to Moslem ideas, and it is by no means universally believed that she did, in fact, poison her husband. A way out may be afforded by the application of a theory, which would be convenient on the present occasion, however distressing it may be for persons in the married state, that in Moslem law there can be no conviction for such an offence unless two persons have witnessed the administration of the poison; and, adds Mr. Philby, two persons who knew it to be poison. 102. Captain H. C. Armstrong, the author of Grey Wolf, was on his way to Jedda on the 31st May, by appointment with Ibn Saud, to collect material for an account of His Majesty. It was doubtful whether the King would consent to this project, and he drew^ the line at allowing his would-be biographer to stalk him to Riyadh, but the Saudi passion for propaganda seems to have triumphed over any fears that Fuad Bey Hamza’s perusal of Grey Wolf may have inspired. It is not known whether measures have been taken to guard against a strong and modern handling of the King’s love affairs. 103. Jedda grows very hot and sticky, and there was a considerable exodus of foreigners in May. 104. The disposal of this year’s pilgrimage was almost complete by the end of May. The total number embarked for India up to the 31st May was 9,791; for Malaya, about 102. There have been the usual troubles in connexion with destitutes. One hundred and ninety-nine Indian pilgrims of this kind were shipped on the 23rd May, and there was reason to fear that a good many more would come forward. A small but vociferous band of thirty-one destitute Palestinians and Transjordanians proved a considerable nuisance, but were well in the way of final disposal at the end of the month. The repatriation of other destitute British pilgrims presented less difficulty this year. 105. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in May was as follows :— On hand at beginning of month : 3 males. Took refuge in May : 4 males. Manumitted in May and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : 6 males. In two cases the local authorities brought up accusations of theft by the late owners. This always creates difficulty as the charges may be true and cannot be ignored, but they may sometimes be trumped up to impede the action of the Legation. The question of the disposal of slaves who have to be repatriated and are not clearly repatriable to the Sudan continues to create occasional difficulty. oI —mi THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GO^^NMfeNV^^i# EASTERN (Arabia).

He stayed until the 20th April at the Khuzam Palace at Nuzla, a mile outside the town. This is a new house just built by Abdullah Suleyman, who already had a bungalow* near by, ostensibly for his own use. It is not clear whether he retains rights in it, but it appears to have now definitely become the Royal residence in Jedda. It is a house of some pretension, having at least two fine rooms and a good terrace roof, but in its present hardly completed state it produces the effect of poor workman ship in details. It is in open surroundings commanding a good distant view of the sea and is well placed as regards climate conditions, but it is infested with flies and the approach from the towm is bad. 54. The King received the foreign representatives in a series of formal audiences on the morning of his arrival. The subsequent business audiences included one given to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 17th April, when a general discussion took place in connexion with the impending Saudi-Transjordan negotiations. Sir Andrew Ryan, wishing to prepare the King for the probability of a necessary division of the negotiations into two stages, emphasised the difficulty of certain questions which would arise. The King made light of difficulties. He suggested that, as the Transjordan delegates proper would have the backing of a British representative in Transjordan, the Minister in Jedda should back his own delegates. 55. Ibn Saud appeared to be in good health, but he seemed tired and preoccupied during his audiences. 56. The King's speech at his pilgrimage banquet on the 31st March, as reported (it is believed fairly accurately) in the Umm-aZ-Qura of the 6th April, abounded in the usual pious texts and exhortations to Islamic unity, but he was more careful than on some previous occasions to avoid language likely to give offence to Moslems of non-Wahhabi convictions, bpeaking with reference to the idea that he might aspire to the Caliphate over all Islam, he disclaimed any such pretension on the ground that a Caliph must be able to enforce the commands of the Islamic religion over the whole to da 1C W ° r d ’ a thmg which no man lining at the present time was in a position 57. The Amir Feisal came to Jedda on the 24th April. He received the * 1 ransjordan mission that morning and gave a large dinner-party stark wdth Jedda [795 gg—4]4 7 /^ notables, in their honour that evening. He dined next evening at the British Legation. He took no other overt part in the affairs of the mission and returned to Mecca on the 27th April. 58. There has been a lull in the various activities directed towards economic development. The following summary shows the position during the month in regard to the projects, &amp;c., mentioned in the two previous reports, paragraphs 15 and 34 :— (a) Nothing more was heard of the progress of the arrangements to give effec^^ to the National Bank concession. All may be well, but the silence of the ex-Khedive’s agent has created some little doubt in high Saudi circles. (b) A still deeper silence has brooded over the Mecca-Jedda railway project. \c) The negotiations for an oil concession in Hasa had still produced no definite result by the 30th April. The representatives of the Iraq Petroleum Company remained in Jedda throughout the month, but did not seem to make any headway. Mr. Hamilton, of Standard Oil of California, returned from a conference with colleagues in Egypt on the 9th April, and has probably made progress towards an agreement on lines similar to, but not so favourable to the Government as, those for which the Minister of Finance was standing out. Major Holmes, of the Eastern and General Syndicate, arrived in the same steamer as Mr. Hamilton. It appears to be true that he came by invitation of the Saudi Government in the sense that he had himself elicited the invi tation and had been given it in the hope of enlarging the field of competition. He left precipitately on the 12th April having seen the Minister of Finance, but not the King. The extensive and peculiar nature of his interests probably proved an embarrassment to him. As a moving spirit in the Eastern and General Syndicate he is a rover in the world of oil, but in Bahrein he is tied to Standard Oil of California and he is co-interested in Koweit with a separate American concern belonging to the Mellon group, viz., the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. He seems to have come to Jedda with only one avowed object, that of getting Ibn Saud's consent, so far as the Saudi Government are concerned, to a concession in the Koweit neutral zone. He had promised Standard Oil of California not to poach on their preserves in Hasa, but would appear to have had ideas of his own, nevertheless, as to how that field might ultimately be partitioned. It seems fairly certain that he left Jedda with two fleas in his ear, one inserted by the Minister of Finance, the other by Mr. Hamilton. (d) The Hyderabad textile industry scheme has not so far produced visible results at the Hejazi end, nor has anything more been heard of financial help from the Nizam. 59. A communique published on the 8th April announced that hence forward motor vehicles of one type only, not specified, would be allowed to be imported into the Hejaz. There is a close connexion between this and a scheme for standardising all motor transport and giving a monopoly of import to a single person or firm. The hottest competitor for this monopoly is Mr. Philby, who by the end of the month thought he had as good as got it. Stripped of various details the plan is that Mr. Philby or his company should import Ford cars only, to be sold to the Government on credit terms, secured on a fixed share in the receipts of the Naqaba, i.e., the existing Government organisation in charge of the arrangements for transporting pilgrims. The monopoly would include a mono poly for the importation of tyres, not confined to one make, and perhaps other accessories. If he gets it Mr. Philby will have to find capital to finance the purchases from the Ford Company, who have become very shy of themselves selling cars on credit in this country. 60. The Saudi Government have at last taken final delivery of the wireless stations supplied by the Marconi Company. The last remaining station, that at Riyadh, was completed some time ago, but the authorities were very dilatory in facing up to an acknowledgment that the company had fulfilled all their obligations. 61. There was no definite news of further trouble in Asir in April, although there were rumours in Jedda and Mecca that the Government were anxious. Itseems to be true that further troops were sent to Asir, but these may have merely gone to relieve others. It is intended, following on the arrangement regarding the Idrisi recorded in paragraph 66 below, to organise the part of Asir in which he had his being as an ordinary Saudi province to be called Asir Tihama, with a local Governor under a Governor-General or Viceroy at Abha. 62. The Director of Police at Jedda was retransferred to his former-post at ^R-abigh in April, and was replaced by one Khalil Bey, Director of Police at ^Medina, who had held the post at Jedda two years previously. The removal of the late director may have been partly due to the affair mentioned in paragraph 43 of the last report and certain other grievances of the Legation against him r which had not given rise to official action when they occurred, but were ventilated in connexion with the incident of the 4th March. The new man is known to the Legation and not unfavourably. II-—P rontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 63. The arrangements for the mutual recognition of each other by Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah were completed according to plan on the 1st April. The two rulers exchanged friendly telegrams, as had been arranged, next day. This cleared the road for the initiation of treaty negotiations between the two’ Govern ments with the participation of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. A mission from Transjordan arrived in Jedda on the 22nd April. It consisted of Colonel C ox, the British Resident at Amman, who was associated as a British representative with His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda; and Taufiq Bey Abdul-Huda, chief secretary to the Transjordan Government as representative of the Amir Abdullah; with Captain Glubb as expert. The mission was received with great distinction. Its members, and Mrs. Cox, were entertained as Government guests at the Kandara villa. Formal negotiations began on the 23rd April and proceeded actively, in a fairly favourable atmosphere duiing the rest of the month. A summary account of them and of their partial success but temporary failure to produce signed treaty texts will be given in the next report. 64. There was no news of trouble on the Saudi Arabia-Transjordan frontier during April. The only incident worth recording is the arrival at Mecca in the company of the Amir of Tebuk, of one Karayim-bin-Atiya, whom the I ransjordan authorities had decided, in the ’ interests of the Saudi Government, to put out of harm's way in Palestine. After successfully playing a double game, this man made his peace with the Saudi authorities and now seems to be in high favour, all the higher because of the yarns he has spun about the inducements held out to him in Transjordan to work against Ibn Saud. 65. The Iraqi representative scored a partial success durin 0, April in his negotiations regarding the properties of the Hashimite family in the Hejaz. a subject which interests His Majesty s Government as one affecting the personal interests of the Amir Abdullah, but in which they are unwilling to involve them selves officially. The position was discussed during the conference between k.ir Andrew Ryan, Colonel Cox, Taufiq Bey and the Iraqi representative. It was agreed that the former should not intervene for the time beino- beyond inti mating privately to Fuad Bey that he would welcome a settlement and had heard with pleasure that the prospects were good. 66. The Question between Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen regarding the disposal of the Idrisi was settled late in March or early in April by the consent of the former to an arrangement that Hasan-al-Idrisi should remain 1 f 1 ti l e 1 e m en under the Imam's supervision and should receive a pension from the Saudi Government It was hoped, on the Saudi side, that other refugees including Hasan s brother, Abdul-Wahhab, would return under amnesty to Saudi Arabia, but this hope is not known to have been fulfilled. The rumours of trouble m Asir, mentioned in paragraph 61, have had their counterpart in rumours of military preparations under sons of the Imam on the Yemeni side There has been no confirmation of these reports; nor have there been any serious signs of tresh danger to peace between the two Sovereigns. Indeed in April Ibn Saud appeared to contemplate the despatch of yet another mission to Sana to discuss outstanding questions. Qibtuss [795 gg—4] 2III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 67. There is little of interest to record under this heading. The pilgrimage and the predominant importance of the negotiations in regard to re a i° ns e Saudi -Arabia and Transjordan prevented any important subjects other than the latter from being pursued between His Majesty s Government am e au . 1* Government. The French Charge d’Affaires has been almost invisible but is saia to have taken a strong line on behalf of the lady mentioned m paragrap / e 9. * The Netherlands representative has been kept busy, despite the smallness ot this year’s pilgrimage from Java, by arrangements for the repatriation ot over , destitutes, who have been accumulating for some time past and are now being sent home at the joint cost of private contributors to a charitable tund and the Government of the Dutch East Indies. The Persian Charge left Jedda, with his usual joy in terminating his short spells there, on the 25th April. Afghanis an has been in evidence owing to the large percentage of Afghans in a small o\eiseas pilgrimage and the presence among them of several diplomats beside the Atghan Minister for Foreign Affairs. An Afghan consulate has been established m principle in Jedda, and it was announced on the 14th April that Silahuddm fGm 11 Saljuqi had obtained a Saudi exequatur with effect from the 11th April. I is gentleman is also consul at Bombay, and the present intention seenis to be merely to detail him for work at Jedda during the pilgrimage season. He arrived on the 16th March and left for India on the 25th April. IV.— Miscellaneous. 68. Sir Andrew Ryan cleared up with Fuad Bey on the 1st April the affair of the visit of H.M.S. Penzance to the Farsan Islands, which, it proved on a review of previous correspondence, ought either not to have taken place or ought to have been notified to the Saudi Government. I he latter seem to be contemplating t e adoption of general regulations for the visits of foreign warships to other ports. Meanwhile the Farsan Islands’ affair cast no shadow over the visit of Penzance to Jedda from the 1st to 8th April. Several of her Somali ratings made the pilgrimage. j .e ^ 69. The Imperial Airways Hanno, one of the large aeroplanes used tor the Indian service, made a forced landing near Jubail, after having lost its way in thick weather, on the 31st March and got into difficulties in the sand. It was fortunately possible to inform the Saudi Government without delay and their subsequent remonstrance was comparatively mild, but the incident has drawn attention to the difficulty of avoiding at least occasional flying o\er and even landings of a kind which they resent as being violations of territory. The local authorities behaved w T ell and helped to extricate the Hanno from its predicament without awaiting instructions, so that she reached Bahrein safely on the 1st April. 70. Mr. A. S. Calvert arrived in Jedda on the 22nd April and took up his duties as head of the Chancery of the Legation, in succession to Mr. Hope Gill. 71. Lady Evelyn Cobbold returned from the Mecca pilgrimage on the 7th April, exhausted^ and not having met Ibn Saud, but happy in the illusion that she was the first European of her sex to accomplish the pilgrimage. She left for England on the 9th April. A certain relief was perceptible in various quarters, but it was doubtless due to ignorance only that a local paper transformed her name into “ the Lady Zeynab Awful Bubble.” 72. Lady Evelyn had a potential rival in the person of a Frenchwoman with a singular past in Syria, who had conceived the idea of getting to Mecca and obtaining copy for a book by marrying ad hoc a Nejdi sojourner in Syria. The couple were foiled by French authorities in Syria, but were united, it is said, by a Qadhi at Haifa. When they got to Jedda the husband was unable to get per mission for the lady to go to Mecca. Shortly afterwards he died in Jedda, in circumstances which convinced the Saudi authorities that she had poisoned him. Meanwhile the lady had contracted an intimacy with the handsome but ne'er-do- well son of the French Charge dAffaires. This young man has been wafted away, but at the end of the month the lady was still in durance pending a decision as to whether she should be put to death or merely deported.■■■■ 73. The following table shows the estimated number of pilgrims from over seas, the only countries sending more than 1,000 being shown separately :— Indians (British India) Dutch East Indies French North Africa Egypt Afghanistan Bokhara Others Total 7,040 2,415 1,284 1,621 2,403 1,204 4,059 20,026 74. Thus the overseas pilgrimage, despite the increase in certain contingents like those from Afghanistan and Bokhara, justified the gloomiest anticipations. It is not known how many overland pilgrims went to swell the grand total at Arafat, but it is doubtful whether they brought it up to more than 40,000. There were comparatively few from the Yemen, which has sent numerous pilgrims in recent years. 75. The climatic conditions were good and the sanitary state of the pilgrimage was excellent. The Saudi authorities had no difficulty in declaring it clean. The Legation w^as satisfied after making its own enquiries that this declaration could be accepted and that south-bound ships need not be required to call at Kamaran. Special precautions were, however, taken to ensure as far as possible that all pilgrims embarked had been vaccinated for small-pox wdthin a reasonable past period. The Alexandria Quarantine Board also declared the pilgrimage clean on the 17th April after the first examination of pilgrims returning northward at Tor. '6. The regatta for pilgrimage ships held annually during the pilgrimage season took place on the 6th April. It was successful, but the number of the entries for some of the events was small. 77. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in April was as follows : — On hand at beginning of the month : None. Took refuge in April: Four males. Manumitted in April and repatriated : None. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at the end of the month : Four males.INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. 2 2 ^ 2/.?S 5' CO/VJPjr.”. • »..AL. and address —not to any per soft by navjr, out Jo, “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign O ^ DUt to—__ --j ffice, LondjiyS. ^ TPIE Under-Secretary ^.^compliments to Foreign Affairs presents his 1933 / ami, by dll 1 tclTon of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper.

THE King, who had gone into camp at Rawdat-al-Khafs, a place some distance from Riyadh and reported to be delightful, mingled sport with business until mid-March. He returned to Riyadh on or about the 19th March and left on the 21st March. He arrived in Mecca for the pilgrimage on the 27th March, bringing numerous members of his family and other attendants. He gave his annual dinner to notable pilgrims on the evening of the 31st March. Little has been heard of him in Jedda since his return. 33. The Amir Feisal was in Jedda from the 8th to the 11th March. He held no reception, but went to tea with Mr. and Mrs. Philby on the 10th March, where he met a select party consisting principally of Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan, the American concession hunters and their wives, and Lady Evelyn Cobbold. The tea-party was alafranga, the Prince most affable to both sexes/ Fuad Bey ^ Hamza has kept fairly regularly to his new plan of being at the Jedda branch of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on Saturdays. 34. There have been various developments in connexion with the financial and economic schemes mentioned in the last report (see paragraph 15). They may be summed up as follows :— (a) the ex-Khedive’s agent completed his negotiations early in March and left Jedda on the 10th March,' taking with him, it appears, the National Bank Concession, in spite of an eleventh-hour attempt to scotch it on the part of the young Syrian merchant, Hussein Aweyni, who went on behalf of himself and others to Riyadh. Both parties to the concession state that the agreement is definite, but no details have been made public. The particulars given in paragraph 15 (a) are believed to be accurate. The notes are not to be forced currency and are to have substantial gold cover. The bank is apparently not to be for the Hejaz only, but will operate in other Near Eastern countries and will have its headquarters in London. It is rumoured in diplomatic circles that Mr. Philby will be the conseiller. The motives of the promoters continue to be obscure. The “ Amir ” Habib Lutfullah, who obtained a similar concession from King Hussein just eight years ago, had at least the satisfaction of having been made Ambassador in Rome and playing a miscellaneous diplomatic role. (h) The Umm-al-Qura of the 3rd March published a summary of the Jeelani concession for the proposed railway between Mecca and Jedda. The forecast in paragraph 15 (b) was not completely accurate. The loan of 10 lacs is to be paid in five monthly instalments, beginning in October 1933, and to be repayable by retention of 5 per cent. of° the Government s share of the receipts. The loan will apparently be a charge on the capital of 50 lacs. The construction of the line is to [795 c—1]2 begin in October-November 1933- and to be completed in September 1935, subject to a possible extension of time to a date not later than the 23rd March, 1936, in case of delay due to force majeure. The summary gives no particulars of the agreed apportionment of gross receipts or the fares to be charged. {c) There are now two sets of representatives negotiating for oil rights ir Hasa, namely, Messrs. Twitched and Hamilton, representing Standard Oil of California as before, and Messrs. Longrigg and Muderris, who arrived in Jedda on the 12th March, on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company. The Minister of Finance is said to have stood out for £100,000 down and a substantial periodical payment afterwards. Neither candidate has been prepared to accept his terms, but Standard Oil of California are believed to be readier than the Iraq Petroleum Company has so far shown itself to accept the principle of a substantial payment for a pig in a poke rather than a moderate rental in the first instance for prospecting rights only. Mr. Hamilton went to Cairo at short notice on the 23rd March, presumably to consult other parties, including, possibly, Major Holmes and another person connected with the Eastern and General Syndicate, who were about to fly from Ivoweit to Egypt about the same time. It was reported from Koweit that Major Holmes had been invited by Ibn Saud to come to Jedda, a surprising development, if true, as Major Holmes is known to have been in the King’s black books for some years. Messrs. Longrigg and Muderris are playing a patient game, but the former went to Port Sudan for a few days on the 26th March to escape boredom and “ to buy a topee.” {d) The scheme hatched by Hyderabad notables to start a textile industry in the Hejaz seems to have made progress at the Indian end. A certain amount of money, variously put at from 5,000 to 15,000 rupees, has been collected, and looms and spinning-wheels are said to have been ordered in India. (e) Nothing more has been heard of financial help for Saudi Arabia from the Nizam of Hyderabad. 35. The financial and economic developments described above have generated a new feeling of optimism in the Hejaz. Even the Saudi Government have been showing greater readiness to pay out money in respect of minor obligations. 36. There has been no news of further internal commotion in Asir or elsewhere. Notwithstanding this, Ibn Saud has presented an appearance of nervousness, possibly owing to the situation vis-d-vis of the Yemen (see para graph 42 below) and uncertainty as to the strength of his hold on the country as a whole. He may be still suffering from the jolt given him by the Ibn Rifada and Asir rebellions last year, despite his success in represssing them. II.—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 37. Progress was made in March with the arrangements for mutual recognition between Ibn Saud and the Amir of Transjordan. The Trans jordanian and Saudi notes to the High Commissioner for Transjordan and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda respectively were duly written on the 21st March. Though neither followed the exact wording proposed in February, they were similar in substance and were satisfactory. Special arrangements were made to forward certified copies speedily to the Legation and the High Commissioner for transmission to the respective Governments of the other part. All was ready by the 30th March, and it was proposed in Jedda to make the communications necessary to consummate recognition on the 31st March. Although Wahhabis have no objection to Friday diplomacy, that day of the week was considered unsuitable in Jerusalem, and the communication was postponed at both ends until the 1st April. A bsit omen. 38. The completion of the recognition procedure paves the way for treaty negotiations. Ibn Saud demurred to the two-stage proposal mentioned in paragraph 18 (5), but it was hoped at the end of March to get him to agree to a second stage at Jerusalem, in the almost certain event of its being impossible to reach agreement during the stay of the Transjordan delegates in Jedda, which will necessarily be short.3 39. On the 19th March, Sir Andrew Ryan sent Fuad Bey a personal and confidential letter containing a systematic statement regarding measures taken by His Majesty's Government to counteract anti-Saudi machinations in countries under their control or influence. Fuad Bey’s reply was warmly appreciative. 40. There was no trouble on the Transjordan frontier in March, but the T’ojected meeting between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz-ibn-Zeyd again did not come off. Some correspondence passed regarding the recent conduct of the Governor of Tabuk in collecting “commission on loot,” i.e., retaining a heavy percentage of returnable camels. The Saudi Government sent to the Legation on the 14th February a revised version of an earlier and very cavalier answer to a protest regarding intrusions into Transjordan by Saudi officials and soldiers last autumn. Fuad Bey had asked for the return of the first note in deference to representations as to the unfavourable impression it would create. The revised version, though still unsatisfactory, was a great improvement on the first. 41. The Iraqi representative in Jedda has not been happy, less apparently because of any really serious trouble between Iraq and Saudi Arabia than because his Government press him to attempt the solution of too many questions simul taneously. The scheme for a motor route for pilgrims between Nejef and Medina makes slow progress. The Iraqi Government are also keen on a settlement of the vexed question of property owned by the Hashimite family in the Hejaz, a subject which may perhaps engage attention during the projected negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. 42. The arrangements for the surrender of the Idrisi to Ibn Saud (para graphs 21 and 22 of last report) hung fire throughout the month. There has been much reticence on the subject, but there have been no other overt signs of tension between King and Imam. III. —Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 43. Relations between His Majesty’s Minister and the Saudi Government, i.e., Fuad Bey Hamza, were sweeter than sugar throughout the month. The main subject of discussion was the Saudi-Transjordan recognition formulae. Ibn Saud has been accommodating to an extent which affords a further indication of the nervousness mentioned in paragraph 36 above. On the 4th March a local policeman entered the Legation offices in circumstances which necessitated a protest on grounds of violation. After an unsuccessful effort to get an adequate apology from the Governor of Jedda suitable satisfaction was obtained from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Ibn Saud gave a proof of goodwill in March by authorising the return to Jedda of a man, partly in the Legation service, who had been deported last year in consequence of a charge of having made an alcoholic beverage. 44. Fuad Bey gave Sir Andrew Ryan on the 18th March a general account of the position between Soviet Russia and Saudi Arabia since 1931. He stated that no general agreements had been reached on the lines described by the Soviets, but admitted that the Saudi Government had removed the embargo on trade from Russia, subject to its not being started pending the elaboration of machinery for J the marketing of Russian goods. 45. The Netherlands Charge d'Affaires (see paragraph 23) returned from Sana in the last days of March. The French Charge d'Affaires returned rather earlier, stating, not unplausibly, that he had only gone to Syria to have a permanently-damaged eye seen to. 46. The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage on the 6th March and went on a day or two later to Medina. He is understood to be on leave and it is not known whether he had brought the instrument of ratification of the Saudi Afghan Treaty of May 1932. IV.— Miscellaneous. 47. H.M.S. Penzance visited the Farzan Islands on the 22nd-24th March. Owing to a misapprehension in Jedda as to the instruction of His Majesty's Government, the visit was not notified to the Saudi Government by the Legation, with the result that the local sheikhs and Amir, though very polite, demurred to the visit, as not having been authorised by their superior authorities.4 8. Seyyid Ahmed-as-Senusi died at Medina on the 10th March. The 1 appearance of this once considerable figure attracted little attention, r a Hope Gill, the senior member of the Legation staff, left Jedda tor good on the 15th March, on transfer to Alexandria. He had been here since ic drd January, 1930, and had acted no less than five terms as His Maiesty's aige d Affaires. His successor, Mr. A. S. Calvert, is expected in the latt^ part of April. t&gt;0 Lady Evelyn Cobbold (see paragraph 27) has been more successful than was anticipated and a little more successful than she desired, having obtained permission to visit the Holy Cities but having been given to understand that it would be mat vue it, being here so close to pilgrimage time, she did not go the wdiole hog and do the pilgrimage proper, instead of merely making the visit known as (Jmra. Her success has been attributed less to evidence of piety or even to the Hunmore lineage than to the discovery that her son-in-law, Mr. Hambro, was ° f f he Bai i k , En g lan J- Anyhow, she went to Medina on the 2()th March and started for Mecca on the 30th March. If Ibn Saud receives her, her cup of blessings will be full to overflowing. t ‘ Eui&gt; fher arrivals of pilgrims in March brought the total number from Indian ports up to about 10,500, of whom some 7,000 are British India subiects 1 he total of overseas pilgrims may be in the neighbourhood of 24,000. In the absence ot the India and Malay pilgrimage officers at Mecca, accurate estimates cannot at the moment be given. There have again been a good many pilgrims ot important standing, including one picturesque figure, the Amir of Katsina a personage of great wealth and consideration in Nigeria. Mecca will not eni’oy the presence of the well-known Indian agitator, Ismail Ghuznavi, of Amritsar, to whom the Indian Government refused facilities. He is important at the Saudi end as being an ardent Wahhabi whom Ibn Saud has used greatly as a sort of unofficial agent in India. 52. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves was as follows On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male, 1 female Took refuge in March : None. Manumitted in March and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : 1 female. On hand at the end of the month : None.f- INDcXF In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. £/c/Cf &amp;/tfd and address —not to any person oy name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W THE Under-Secretary of State Affairs presents his compliment^ to Jirr ^L^u^cL^tiL. an( ^^ direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper. 1^* Foreign Office, 3^' 193 A Reference to previous correspondence : A 2 -# Plu/Zr ^ a Description of Enclosure.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT f P.Z. 1 EASTERN (Arabia). 1 3198 March 21, 1933.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for February 1933. Chapter I .—Internal A flairs. (Confidential.) 13. I he King remained at Riyadh throughout the month. He is expected to return to Mecca about the middle of March, about three weeks before Pilgrimage Day, which should fall on or about the 4th April. , 14. I he Amir Feisal visited Jedda from the 7ti to the 9th February. Besides receiving Sir Andrew Ryan and Mr. Hope Gill (see paragraph 23), he visited the local hospital, the reconditioning of which was foreshadowed in January, and presented £100 to it. 15. 1 here was marked activity in February in connexion with financial and economic schemes for the betterment of Saudi Arabia. The following were the principal developments— (a) Abdul Hamid Shedid, the ex-Khedive’s agent (paragraph 2), seems to have made considerable progress with negotiations for the creation of a national bank, with a capital of £1 million gold, to be subscribed as to one-half by the ex-Khediye. It is understood that the Saudi Government will have the option of subscribing £250,000, but that, in the almost certain event of their not doim&gt;- so, the promoters have another source in view. The remaining £250,000 will be offered for subscription in the Hejaz. The bank will serve as State bank and receive all revenue on deposit. A loan of £200,000 is to be made to the Saudi Government. The bank will have the privilege of issuing notes, but it is not clear that their use will be made compulsory at the outset. It is not known what, if any, economic concessions have been promised to the ex-Khedive and his associates. The financial basis and prospects on which they are workin 0, are obscure; the possible political motives of Abbas Hilmi Pasha even more so.^ (b) Dr. S. A. K. Jeelani of Madras left for India on the 24th Februarv. after concluding laborious negotiations for a fifty years’ concession to build and exploit a railway between Mecca and Jedda. The Government secured verv favourable terms, including a 50 per cent, share in gross receipts and a loan of 10 lakhs of rupees, repayable in annual instalments. It seemed probable that Dr Jeelani had moral support in India, but had still to get the definite financial backing required. The scheme is almost certainly unsound as a practical economic proposition, but may nevertheless find support on religious Wounds c Ameru : an ’ Mr - Twitched, who conducted extensive surveys for the Saudi Government m 1931-32, returned to Jedda on the 15th Februarv with a Mr. Hamilton, who represents the Standard Oil Company of California.’ He no longei sei\es the Saudi Government, but has interested American concerns in the [739 x—1]I 2 mineral possibilities of Saudi Arabia, notably oil on the Hasa Coast, and perhaps in the Wejh area, and gold, which has been located at various places, notably near Medina. Standard Oil of California seem to be the likeliest competitors for the oil, although the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have also shown some interest. Mr. Twitched himself appears to be acting for the parties interested in the gold. (d) It is understood that Ibn Saud signified approval in January of the textile scheme mentioned in paragraph 341 of last year’s reports, provided it were charitable. (e) There has been vague talk of financial assistance for Ibn Saud from the Nizam of Hyderabad in consideration of the Nizam’s being allowed to recondition the Prophet’s birthplace at Mecca. Nothing definite is known on this subject. 16. On the 2nd February, Fuad Bey Hamza told Sir Andrew Ryan that the King’s cousin, Ibn Musaid, who left Hail some time ago to take charge in Asir, had assumed command at Jizan, but that there was no longer a fighting front. He said that the two principal tribal elements still in revolt, viz., the Masariha and part of the Beni Shubeyl, had surrendered, and that another in the mountains had been reduced. The Idrisi was understood to have crossed the frontier into the Yemen, attended only by a few personal adherents. Although the Saudi claim to have suppressed the rebellion completely may be exaggerated, it is probably true that any serious danger has been averted, unless there should be a later recrudescence. A Saudi communique, published on the 24th February, represented the situation in Asir as having been completely stabilised. In the absence of any other material information from Asir during the month, the main subject of interest was the possible repercussions of the Idrisi’s escape on relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen (see paragraph 22V Chapter II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 17. His Majesty’s Minister left for Jerusalem on the 10th February; arrived there on the 15th February, after a flying visit to Cairo; and returned to Jedda on the 26th February. The object of this journey was to pave the way, in consultation with the High Commissioner, for further discussions with the Saudi Government regarding various aspects of the relations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. After preliminary discussions in Jerusalem, Sir Andrew Ryan proceeded to Amman on the 16th February. He and Colonel Cox lunched that day with the Amir Abdullah, who, in general discussion of a private nature, reaffirmed his willingness to comply in every respect with the wishes of His Majesty’s Government regarding his relations with Ibn Saud. The Amir dwelt on certain of the desiderata, which he had expressed when he agreed last autumn to recognise Ibn Saud. 18. The principal results of Sir Andrew Ryan’s discussions in Jerusalem and Amman, and of an interview between General Wauchope and the Amir Abdullah, on the 19th February, were as follows :— (a) Drafts in English and in Arabic, which will be the language of the official texts, were prepared of the communication to be addressed by the Amir’s chief Minister to the High Commissioner regarding mutual recognition, and of a telegram to be sent by the Amir to Ibn Saud after the completion of the recognition. The Amir accepted the drafts, and His Majesty’s Government approved of them in due course, subject to slight verbal alterations. (b) It was contemplated, subject to the final approval of His Majesty’s Government, that the ensuing negotiations for treaties between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, on the general lines of those concluded in 1931 between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, should if possible be divided into two stages, the first at Jedda in the second half of April, the second at Jerusalem about the middle of June. {c) Tentative drafts of the proposed treaties were prepared at Amman, for submission to higher authority. 19. Among the other subjects discussed were the nature of the Trans jordanian representation in the forthcoming negotiations, a suggestion thrown out by the Saudi Minister in London (in circumstances which left its ultimate origin doubtful) that a personal meeting between Ibn Saud and the3 Amir Abdullah might be useful, and the possibility of further measures to restrain anti-Saudi activities in Transjordan and other countries under British control or influence. Preliminary conclusions were reached on these subjects. It is unnecessary to describe them in detail, as, though important, they are subsidiary to the main purpose. 20. It remains to pursue the above matters in suitable order, beginning with mutual recognition, with the Saudi Government. 21. According to an article in the Umm-al-Qura of the 17th February, Ibn Saud’s envoy to the Imam Yahya had then got back with the Imam’s reply to a letter which he had delivered' on behalf of Ibn Saud. The reply, as reproduced, probably only in part, in the article, is friendly, pious and vague. It, however, intimates acceptance of “ four points ” stated by the King, subject to details added by the Imam, who is said to have asked Ibn Saud to send authorised delegates to conclude a final agreement. 22. i his letter from the Imam must have been written about the beginning of the year. Subsequently, the escape of the Idrisi into the Yemen (see paragraph 16) created a more acute situation. Fuad Bey told Sir Andrew Ryan, on the 2nd February, that there was danger of complications unless the Imam surrendered the Idrisi, as he was bound to do under the treaty concluded in December 1931. Sir Andrew Ryan suggested that, as the Idrisi was stated to have no serious following, the matter should be dealt with as a simple question of extradition, not as a possible cause of conflict. On the 9th February, Fuad Bey said that the King had reached the same conclusion, and that the Imam had now agreed to surrender the Idrisi subject to his being pardoned and well treated, a request to which the King acceded. Secret reports about the same time suggested that the real situation between the King and the Imam was much more strained. Fuad Bey’s version was restated in an amplified form (according to which the King had promised amnesty to all the fugitives in the Yemen), in the official b^audi communique of the 24th February, but there was no news up to the end of the month of the actual surrender of the rebels. Sir Andrew Ryan had friendly conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 2nd February, mainly about Transjordan questions and the Asir Yemen situation (paragraphs 16 and 22). The Amir Feisal came to Jedda on the 7th February. It was currently, though probably falsely, believed that he had come to see the Minister before his departure for Jerusalem. The Prince received him and Mr. Hope Gill very amiably, but seemed listless. /'wi rt t /'l ✓■v V-x 1 .i. .1 _ 1* .i i.. a. Chapter III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia.

The French sloop Diana, with Vice-Admiral Jubert on board, visited Jedda on the 31st January and left on the 2nd February. 27. Lady Evelyn Cobbold, a rich and well-connected widow of 65, a mighty,*^ huntress, and a Moslem since the age of 8, though a pretty lax one, arrived in Jedda on the 26th February to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Philby. She apparently left London with some hope of being received by Ibn Saud, and also with some idea of visiting Mecca. She is not likely to achieve the former object, but may get to Mecca. 28. The Saudi wireless station at Qunfida has been transferred to Lith, and has been replaced by an installation working on a wave-length of 1,100 metres. 29. The efforts of the Legation to interest the Saudi Government in combating locusts (paragraph 347 of last year’s reports) bore further fruit on the 17th February, when an undated but apparently recent report on locusts seen at Wejh was forwarded to the Legation, giving details somewhat on the lines of those asked for and accompanied by two tins of very neatly packed specimens. 30. The principal arrivals of pilgrims in February were as follows :— 3.979 from Bombay and Karachi, of whom 2,638 were British Indians; 314 from Batavia and Singapore, of whom 101 were British Malayans; and 108 from Tangier, all Moors; a total of 4,401 pilgrims. 31.

JAN L ARY coincided almost exactly with the fast of Ramadan and the ensuing festival—times of slackness. Ibn Saud remained at Riyadh. The anniversary of his accession was celebrated on the 8th January, but only in Jedda, where his son, the Viceroy, held receptions and presided at a dinner at which the members of the Diplomatic Body were the principal guests. Fuad Bey Hamza did not attend. He paid three short visits to Jedda and had long conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan on the 5th and 9th January. After that personal diplomatic discussion languished rather, but Fuad Bey dined at the Legation on the 13th January to meet Sir George Buchanan and the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, and gave a return dinner next evening. 2. There was no improvement in the financial situation. On the 15th January Abdul Hamid Bey Shadid. an emissary of the ex-Khedive, arrived in Jedda. It was understood that he would follow up negotiations begun last May regarding a scheme which turns on the creation of a National Bank with privilege of issues, financial assistance to the Saudi Government and economic concessions to be given to the ex-Khedive. 3. The Saudi forces at Sabya and Jizan, having swept down the coast nearly to the Yemen frontier at the end of December, occupied Abu Arish and other places in the interior in the first days of January. The Government claimed that the rebellion was effectively at an end, though it was admitted that certain tribal elements were still in revolt in the mountains adjoining the Yemen and that the Idrisi had escaped. It is probable that the position in the highlands was less rosy than the Saudi authorities represented it to be, but the situation there remained obscure during the rest of the month. The King’s relative, Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid, formerly Governor of Hail, has assumed the command at Jizan. The earlier history of the revolt is given in the report for November-December 1932, paragraphs 363 ff. [711 ee—2]2 II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 4. On the 11th January Sir Andrew Ryan conveyed, in a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the definite proposals of His Majesty’s Government regarding the procedure for mutual recognition between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia and subsequent negotiations for a bilateral treaty, for the execution of^p which by Transjordan His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would be expressly responsible. The Saudi Government's reply of the 22nd January was reasonably satisfactory, but not altogether precise except on the one point that Ibn Saud’s assent was inspired entirely by reliance on the guarantee of His Majesty s Government. British apprehensions regarding a reported concentra tion of Ikhwan near the frontier were allayed early in the month. Ibn Saud admitted that he had taken certain measures earlier owing to rumours of possible incursions from Transjordan, but stated, with apparent truth, that there was no longer any sort of concentration. Mutual assurances of non-aggressive intentions were exchanged. 5. lull information was received from the Iraqi Legation during the month regarding the negotiations for a motor route for pilgrims from Nejef to Medina. 1 he 1 raqi and Saudi Governments have agreed in principle on the trace and all other points except one, i.e., whether there should be permanent buildings to house administrative services on the frontier post. The Iraqi Government are keen on this. The Saudis strongly oppose it and think that tents would do. Even when the agreement is complete, an elaborate survey will be necessary. There is no prospect of the route being opened this year. Incidentally, Indian interests have, of late, busied themselves a good deal with the idea of overland motor transport from India to the Hejaz via Iraq. 6. The situation on the Asir-Yemen frontier threatened to complicate relations between Ibn Saud and the Imam, owing to the proximity of Saudi forces and rebels to the frontier and the presence of Yemeni forces south of Midi. The relations of the two rulers remained correct, and continued to be represented as cordial, throughout January. The representative sent by Ibn Saud direct from Riyadh to Sana some weeks ago left Sana early in January and was said to be the bearer of a new draft treaty. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 7. Relations between the Saudi and British Governments remained friendly. They turned principally on Transjordan affairs, including the embarrassing question of the alleged complicity of members of the Amir Abdullah’s entourage m plots against Ibn Saud. Although the measures taken in various directions under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government to restrict the activities of members of the Dabbagh conspiracy were strengthened, it is more difficult to deal with persons in the Amir's service who are accused by the Saudi Government, like his cousin, the Amir Shakir, and his chamberlain, Hamid Pasha-al-Wadi. 8. Flie incident between the J^audi and Italian Governments over the proceedings of an Italian sloop in Asir waters towards the end of December was closed at the beginning of January by Ibn Sand's acceptance of explanations and perhaps semi-apologies tendered by the Italian Government.

They did not venture to exhibit their local hospital, but the Director-General of Public Health conducted Sir George personally to see the water installation at the Waziriva Wells, 10 miles from Jedda, where there is an American windmill, erected by Mr. Twitchell and a small expenmental garden, to the private house of a Javanese sheikh of pilgrims i&amp;Ei!£3ff£a* '» ***»= - - •&gt;»3 10.

I HA\ E the honour to forward herewith the Jedda report for November and December 1932. This report has been compiled by Mr. Hope Gill, who was in charge of the Legation during nearly the whole of the period under review. 1 have made no material alterations in the report as drafted by him. 2. It has been found in practice that the system of preparing these reports at intervals of two months has not produced the advantages which were anticipated when it was introduced at the beginning of 1931. The labour involved in compiling them from the mass of material which accumulates in a post of varied activities has been heavy, and there has been a tendency to over- systematise the reports in an effort to make them comprehensive. There has consequently been frequent delay in issuing the reports, and I think that they have become too unwieldy for the purposes of some of the recipients, while others are already familiar from current correspondence with the subjects which interest them. 3 Having discussed the matter with your Department while on leave. I propose to return to the system of monthly reports and to make them shorter by dealing only with the salient events of 1 each month in a form resembling a news-letter rather than a systematic account of everything that has happened I understand that this will meet your views, and I trust that it will not diminish the value of the reports to other recipients. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure as usual to Cairo, Jerusalem, Beirut, Damascus, Bagdad, Basra, Bushi re, K oweit, New Delhi, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Aden, Addis Ababa, LigosTKEarfilnr, Port'SudanT' the Senior Naval Officer in Red Sea sloops, and to the Royal Air Force Officer Commanding in Palestine and Transjordan.

(Confidential.) Ibn Saud. I. — Internal Affairs. 334. I HE King continued in Nejd during November and December. Very little news of him filtered out. He seems to have spent his time in and about his feudal castle, which is the sum total of Riyadh, receiving tribesmen and occasionally hunting in the neighbourhood. It is thought that the absence of nis chauffeur, Siddiq, on motor-bargaining business in Egypt, kept him very much at home until mid-December, for he has a marked antipathy to being driven by anyone other than this graceless Indian, whom, for reasons known to himself, he trusts. 335. Special favour seems to have been shown by Ibn Saud during these two months to leaders of the Ajman and Mutair tribes who paid homage to him at Riyadh. Elis bounty to them was remarked as exceptional. It served the purpose of encouraging others of these tribes, who had avoided Nejd since the failure of their 1929 rebellion, to consider a return to their former allegiance. Ibn Saud sent out invitations to this end by emissaries to the Mutair in November. His solicitude seems to derive either from gratitude for their behaviour during the Ibn Rifada revolt, when they gave no trouble, or from a desire now to placate them and buy them back; the tribes affect to believe the latter. 336. For the greater part of December Ibn Saud entertained at Riyadh Sheikh Kamil-al-Qassab, Syrian Nationalist and Istiqlal party leader. The Saudi Minister of finance is believed to have paid a considerable sum to this partisan before he left the country—which he did on the 3rd January—to carry on the good work in Palestine and Syria, also no doubt in the Pan-Arab Congress which may be held in Bagdad. It is of interest to record that a member of the Legation staff remembers seeing Sheikh Kamil begging bounty in Mecca from the Sharif Husain with tears in his eyes and gross flattery; then, disappointed at his meagre dole of Maria Theresa dollars, turning to rend him in the Palestinian press. If he now receives reward from Ibn Saud it is in good gold sovereigns, taken from the Hejaz, withheld from the King’s creditors, and used to further his ambitions. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 337. Ihe diplomatic diary records but few and brief contacts between Ministry and Legation in the past two months. On the 14th November the Lnder-Secretary visited Jedda for two days. He asked His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires to call on him on the 16th, when current matters were discussed and three Saudi memoranda, on the Asir situation (paragraphs 363-6), the Dabbagh conspiracy (paragraph 351) and Bahrein transit dues (paragraph 362) were presented. On the 20th November the Saudi Minister in London landed at Jedda on “ leave,” but went straight through to Mecca. He went on to Riyadh on the 2nd December, spent a fortnight with his King, and arrived back in Mecca on the 19th December. fuaH Bey Hamza had, meanwhile, visited Jedda again from the 1st to 4th December, but did not inform or get into touch with^the Legation. On the 22nd December the Amir Feisal came to Jedda, accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and followed the next day by Fuad Bey Hamza Having received no official intimation of the arrival of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Under-Secretary, His Majesty s Minister, who had returned from leave3 2^l the previous day, confined himself to leaving cards on them on the 24th December at the local “ Foreign Office ” building. Hafiz Wahba, however, lunched that day at the Legation in response to a previous invitation while at Mecca. Fuad Hamza called on His Majesty’s Minister on Boxing Day to discuss Asir and connected matters, entertained him and Mr. Hope Gill to lunch in the “ Foreign ()ffice ” to meet the Amir Feisal, and left with the latter and Hafiz Wahba for ^Hecca on the same afternoon; Hafiz Wahha was met with again at a picnic luncheon tabled in his honour before forty guests at Wadi Fatima, a palm-grove 15 miles from Mecca, by the Indian vice-consul, a friend of long standing. On the 30th December this sole Saudi Minister Plenipotentiary sailed again for London by way of Egypt, land of his birth. Finance. 338. In paragraph 290 of the last Jedda report it was suggested, not very hopefully, that the Saudi “ Debts Chest ” might, after all, have something in it. November, however, confirmed the ruling pessimism as to its contents, when the Government issued an obscure memorandum, in which they sought to explain what endeavours they had made to meet their creditors and why it was that they ! had failed. They claimed, nevertheless, to have issued 14 million Amiri piastres’ worth of drafts on Customs. In the “ Debts Chest,” they said, they had enough cash to pay 5 per cent, interest on the remainder of their debts; that is to say, j the bulk. This memorandum was circulated to all the Government’s creditors in Jedda, whom it convinced of the Government’s dishonesty. It was sent out a few days before the return to his post of the Government’s financial adviser. M. van Leeuwen had not been consulted in any way in its preparation, and was not even told of it officially nor given a copy when he returned. The same circular was sent to the British Legation with a brief intimation that it would apply to the debts due to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, a cavalier proceeding considering the past history of their claims in respect of arms supplied to Ibn Sand by the Government of India in 1929 and the cost of the MacDonnell! enquiry. 339. The Cairo A hr am' $ Jaffa correspondent was reported in the Egyptian Gazette of the 28th December as having stated that, among the ex-Khedive Abbas Hilmi’s financial schemes, was the opening of an Hejazi-Palestinian bank with a capital of a million pounds, to which he would contribute half, Ibn Saud a fifth, from a loan which Abbas Hilmi would make to him, and the United Kingdom, French and Italian Governments a tenth apiece. It was also suggested that, in order to further one of his political ambitions-—namely, to secure for himself a throne in Syria, or a throne in Palestine, or the Caliphate—in the Hejaz, the ex-Khedive was ready to render further financial assistance to Ibn Saud, and thereby purchase his support. 340. An error and an omission vitiated the summary of Saudi external indebtedness given in paragraph 290 of the last report. As far as can now be ascertained, this indebtedness stood at the end of December approximately as follows :— Creditor. £ Gold. Service. The Poles 50,000 1930 arms. Government of India 30,000 1929 arms. The Soviets 30,000 1931 oil. The Qusaibis ... ... • 25,000 (at least) Loans, &amp;c. Mr. Philby 20,000 Fords, machinery, &amp;c. “ Shell ” 15,000 1931 oil, stolen. * ££ Standard Oil ” 15,000 Ditto, partly stolen. *“ Marconi’s” 15,000 (at least) Wireless stations. ^German firms 10,000 Telephones, &amp;c. The “ Dutch Bank ” 5,000 Loans. The “ E.T.C.” ... 2,500 Current account. His Majesty’s Government 1,700 MacDonnell investigation 219,200 (at least) The bills for items marked “ which fell due in November, were not then met and have not yet been replaced by any new arrangement. Possibly they also, [711 o —2] b 2I&gt; 4 in the Saudi Government’s view, are covered by the circular described in paragraph 338. Economics. 341. A proposal has been made to Jbn Saud by some leading Nawabs ami other wealthy men of Hyderabad State to start, at their own expense and b;^'* sending experts from India, a cotton-spinning and weaving industry in the Hejaz. They hope by this means to counteract some of the helpless poverty which so shocked them when they were on pilgrimage last spring. The scheme owes much to the initiative and advice of the Indian vice-consul, and he was entrusted with the delivery, on the 17th December, of the promoters’ letter to Ibn Saud through the hand of the Minister of Finance. If the scheme can he made to show profit to either of these last two, its political objections may, perhaps, be outweighed. 342. A railway scheme is reported in paragraph 346. Legislation. 343. The “Regulation respecting the Ministry of Finance’’ completed publication in the local press. A “ Regulation governing Motor-car Drivers ’’ was similarly published in November. It enacts, amongst other necessary rules, that, “ if camels are dismayed at the voice of the horn, the driver must stop the voice of the horn and the motor until they have cleared from the way before him.” A “ Decree concerning the Departure of Debtors,” a busy instrument, was also published in November. On the 25th November, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informed the Saudi Arab Government that, in view of the local “ Coastal Fisheries Regulation of July 1932,” in which Saudi Arab territorial waters were defined as extending 4 miles from shore. His Majesty’s Government must reserve all their rights in international law in respect of waters outside the 3-mile limit. Nationality Law. 344. Having discovered by their summer census (see paragraph 237) who in the Hejaz claimed foreign nationality, the Saudi Government set a committee to work in Mecca in late October and early November to summon those people and demand documentary proof of their nationality. Since the committee was reported to be holding on to such passports as were presented and giving those who had none only fifteen days in which to get them, failing which, they were told, they must either adopt Hejazi nationality or quit the country within three months, His Majesty’s Charge d'Aft'aires enquired of the Saudi Government as to the true nature of the committee's powers. Whereupon the matter was referred to Riyadh and Mr. Hope Gill was assured by Fuad Bey Hamza, on the 16th November, that as far as he knew the report was incorrect. Be that as it may, the committee has not resumed work. Waqfs. 345. The “ Auqaf-al-Harameyn' Association pursued in November, through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Legation, the matter of a valuable Waqf bequest, which is said to be immobilised in Rangoon. Communications. 346. An Indian doctor from Madras, named Jeelani, who, while on pilgrimage earlier in the year, became imbued with ideas of the need for and commercial possibilities of a railway from Jedda to Mecca, returned in December with a cut-and-dried scheme raised by a firm of Madras engineers on the basis of a 1917 sketch-map^which omitted Mecc^jl 1920 pilgrimage figures, and contem porary Indian costs of labour and construction. The doctor seeks a concession from Ibn Saud to build and run this railway, and is ready to give the latter a share in the profits. The latter is holding out for a share in the gross receipts instead. When he gets the concession, Dr. Jeelani will look for the capital, to the tune of 40 lakhs (£300,000). Fie is already a very old man.o Locusts. 347. The friendly arrangement for the reporting of swarms, mentioned in paragraph 296 of the last report, bore sterile fruit once in November. The information was so meagre as to he valueless, nor could more he extracted. II. —Frontier Questions. u j- Transjordan. Hawing. 1 348. Only one raid was reported, made on the 6th November by Beni Atiya from over the border on the Transjordan Howeytat, camped eastward of Bayir. In reply to the Legation’s representations, the Saudi Government stated that the raiders had been arrested and that the camels would be returned to Captain Glubb’s representative on demand. It is supposed that all went well. Beni Atiya. 349. After a preliminary scare had died down, raised by a report that Ibn Baud’s Ikhwan—a name to conjure with in the tribelands—were waiting across the frontier to eat up the Beni Atiya as soon as they emerged into the Hejaz, the eviction of the majority of this troublesome tribe from Transjordan was carried out with precision and success by the desert police. It was completed by the 20th November, when 110 tents had crossed into Saudi Arabia. Ibn Farhan, the leader of the rebel contingent of this tribe, which had gone to join Ihn Rifada, was caught on the Transjordan side of the frontier on the 18th November and was condemned to a year’s imprisonment. Hashimite Intrigue. 350. On the 8th November the Amir Abdullah began what was at first intended to be a tour of his Transjordan corridor, made with the supposed but unavowed intention of meeting with Nuri-ash-Sha lan, paramount chief of the Ruwalla. He was to be accompanied by the tribal sheikhs of Transjordan, among them Selim-abu-Dumeyk, of the Beni Atiya. Observers in Transjordan foresaw, rightly or wrongly, an alliance between Transjordan tribes and the Ruwalla against Ibn Sand. The tour, however, degenerated into a “shooting trip to Asraq,” which the Amir suddenly left on the 15th November for Bagdad, to visit his sick brother Ali. He returned on the 24th November direct to Amman, having apparently not been accompanied in the first instance by Abu Dumeyk, nor having met in the end with Nuri Shalan. 351. On the 16th November the Saudi Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs handed to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires a lengthy memorandum of the previous day describing ramifications of the anti-Saudi plot which has come to be known as the Uabbagh conspiracy, from the name of its most obvious members. The memorandum connected them with the Amir Abdullah and others of the shereefs in Transjordan. Fuad Hamza supported the accusation, which is no new one, with a bulky file of what he described as intercepted correspondence, from which he drew at apparent random five specimens for Mr. Hope Gill's perusal. The memorandum itself concluded with an appeal to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom as allies and friends to prevent territories under their control from being used as bases for anti-Saudi activity. 352. In reporting the gist of this memorandum by telegraph to His Majesty's Government, His Majesty Charge d'Affaires stated that the particular specimen documents were not very convincing, but he expressed the view that neither the probability that the Saudi case was a good one, nor the possibility that the conspirators would cause more active trouble, could rightly be ignored. He enquired whether the Saudi Government might be informed in reply of the steps already taken at Aden to deny use of that centre to the conspirators, and be furthermore assured of the authorities' continued surveillance there and extended surveillance in the Hadhramaut. Mr. Hope Gill also asked whether there was any information which could be added regarding measures taken in Transjordan to incapacitate the plotters there, having in mind the evidence accumulated in British hands against the Amir Abdullah’s immediate entourage, if not against the Amir himself, as well as against minor and outlying native officials in Trans jordan. and having no knowledge of anything having been done since the Ibn6 Rifada revolt ended either to investigate and punish complicity in Transjordan or to guard against similar abuse of British-controlled territory in the future. 353. On the 23rd November, upon receipt of telegraphic confirmation from Aden that the rising in Asir (which is reported in paragraphs 363 to 366 below) was being fomented by the Dabbaghs, and in view of the importance given in the intercepted plans of these conspirators to simultaneous risings in north and- south. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires made telegraphic enquiry of the HigP Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan whether there was any danger of the conspirators’ associates in these countries trying to foment another revolt in the Northern Hejaz. General Wauchope replied that, although there were no indications of any such attempt, it could not be said that there was no possibility of associates in Transjordan communicating with their friends in the Hejaz; watch, however, was being kept. His Majesty’s Government had meanwhile informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, on the 25th November, that, as regards the Saudi memorandum of the 15th November, it might be preferable not to answer, but that, as regards possible action against anti-Saudi conspirators in Transjordan, the High Commissioner was being requested to expedite his views. Saudi Reaction. 354. On the 25th November, however, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had had cause to telegraph home the gist of a circumstantial local report received from a confidential source, to the effect that a letter from the Amir Abdullah to one of the Dabbagh fraternity had been captured by the Saudi forces in Asir, and that this had decided Ibn Saud to concentrate forces of his Ikhwan near the Transjordan border, preparatory to demanding of His Majesty’s Government the Amir Abdullah's dismissal. On the 27th November His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires received a second Saudi memorandum, dated the 26th. It was briefer and more incisive in tone than the first and bore signs of having emanated from Ibn Saud himself at Riyadh. It referred to reports from the northern frontier and news from southbound travellers into Nejd, which pointed to unusual activity on the part of the Shereef Abdullah (cf. paragraph 350). It repeated that participation by the shereefs and their associates in the rebellion of Ibn Rifada was established. It recalled the indignation aroused in Nejd by Transjordan intrigue and encouragement of Ibn Rifada’s attempt, and also the difficulty which the Saudi Government had then had in restraining their tribesmen from attacking Transjordan. It ended by pointing out the danger of the tribes of Nejd getting finally out of hand if decisive action were not taken in Transjordan to put an end to anti-Saudi activities. 355. In telegraphing the substance of this memorandum to His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires observed that something fairly serious must have occurred to cause Ibn Saud to threaten His Majesty’s Govern ment with the uncontrollability of his Ikhwan. He attributed it to a combination of bad news from Asir, disquieting news from the Transjordan frontier and the absence of evidence of any effective measures taken in Transjordan itself, which had determined Ibn Saud to take his own measures to forestall yet another vicarious aggression by the Amir Abdullah. Mr. Hope Gill expressed the view that if Ikhwan were, in fact, being moved northward, no mere words would restore Ibn Saud’s confidence in His Majesty’s Government to the point of making him check the movement. Once it developed, His Majesty’s Government could only resist it. He submitted the advisability, before it developed, of taking radical action in Transjordan, at least against the Shereef Shakir, who seemed richly to deserve it, if the Shereef Abdullah himself could not, in the interests of major policy, be punished with dismissal. He finally recorded the conviction that in the long run His Majesty’s Government must choose between the Amir Abdullah and Ibn Saud. British Intervention. 356. A serious view of the situation was taken in London. Jerusalem was informed on the 3rd December that the continuance of the position, in which His Majesty’s Government were unable to deny the accusation of hostile activities made by Ibn Saud against the Amir Abdullah and his associates, was embarrassing and ignominious. Unless radical steps were taken in the near7 future to remedy this position, prejudice, not only to relations with Ibn Sand, but to British interests throughout the Middle East were to be foreseen. The High Commissioner was asked to consider the possibility of really strong representations to the Amir and of immediate drastic action against conspirators in 1 ransjordan, especially those in the Amir’s entourage, the Amir Shakir in ^mrticular. If this were done, there would then be material for reply to *bn Baud. 357. General Wauchope interviewed the Amir Abdullah on the 7th December. The latter’s reply ended with the statement that he had already promised not to work against Ibn Saud, and he would keep his promise. It appears that he had already dismissed in October one member of his entourage, namely, Abdurrauf-as-Sabban, who was to be relegated to Bagdad. Action has been taken in Transjordan to curb the activities of certain other conspirators from outside, but the principal persons in the Amir’s entourage who have been accused of anti-Saudi activities remained in office at the end of December. His Majesty’s Government were anxiously considering the whole matter. In the meantime no formal reply has been returned to the Saudi memoranda of the 15th and 26th November. The Ikhwan movement has not yet assumed sufficient proportion to cause local anxiety, if, indeed, it has ever started, which is indeterminable, though reports which at one time reached Transjordan from Jauf alleged the arrival there of Ikhwan with many standards. Some fire there probably was. 358. On the 28th December, after taking stock of the situation on his return from leave. His Majesty’s Minister informed His Majesty’s Government that he did not consider an official reply to the Saudi memoranda to be urgent, provided he were given authority to discuss their contents with the Saudi Under-Secretary. He stressed the desirability of securing mutual recognition of their status between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah. Mutual Recognition. 359. 1 he draft of a note to the Saudi Arab Government on the subject of this mutual recognition and of the treaty negotiations which should follow, it was prepared in London in November, and sent to the High Commissioner for Transjordan on the 24th for his observations or concurrence. Iraq. 360. The Iraqi-Nejdi frontier seems to have been quiet, for no echoes have been heard. Koweit and Bahrein. Survey of Koweit Neutral Zone. 361. Instructions were received at Jedda in December to notif} T the Saudi Arab Government that a ground and air survey of the Koweit neutral zone would be undertaken in January. To effect this purpose His Majesty’s Minister awaited the occasion of personal contact with the Saudi Under-Secretary as offering the best method of approach. Bahrein Transit Dues. 362. On the 16th November the Saudi Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs handed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires a memorandum entitled “in respect of treatment accorded by the Bahrein Customs Administration to a shipment of cargo for Uqair.' The incident arose from the necessity imposed upon a British ship, apparently by the Bahrein authorities, of unloading all its cargo, including that consigned to Bahrein, on the Hasa Coast. It was 'utilised by the Saudi Arab Government to raise the whole dormant question of customs duties and transit dues as between Bahrein and the mainland. The memorandum was being considered in December. A sir Revolt A sir and the Yemen. 363. A full-scale rebellion broke out in the Idrisi Province of Asir in the early days of November, and gave considerable concern to the Saudi Government8 ■p 1 1 for two months. Its origins are still obscure. They are thought to lie primarily in the resentment of the Idrisi family and Asiri tribesmen against the final incorporation of their country in that of Saudi Arabia, which the renaming of the Kingdom in September had implied and which was manifestly one of its objects. Contributory causes seem to have been (1) serious friction between the Saudi Governor of the province and Seyyid Hasan-al-Idrisi, its nominal ruler^ friction which the Saudi Government have been at some pains to define a^w personal, but which probably owed much to their policy; (2) advances and promises of support to the Idrisi made by the Dabbagh fraternity, the active southern-Red Sea members of the anti-Saudi “ Hizb-al-Ahrar-al-Hijazi ” or Hejaz Liberal party; while (3) there was no doubt a certain degree of encourage ment from the Yemen, although the astute Imam himself has maintained a studiously correct attitude throughout, graced by frequent expressions of Arab sympathy and brotherly advice, dispensed to Ibn Sand by telegraph. Yet. although the Imam Yahya and Ibn Saud furthermore exchanged identic views, also by telegraph, on the untrustworthiness of foreigners and their territorial designs, they have watched each other like cat and dog. During the course of the rebellion, one of the Imam’s sons lay at the head of a large concentration of Yemeni troops on the northern Yemeni frontier. 364. Jizan was the rebel’s first objective. It fell to the Idrisi on the 6th November, after only two days’ siege, and the Saudi Governor became his prisoner. Asir was negligently held, the Saudi garrisons being small and unsupported; other centres fell at once to the rebels. On the 17th November, however, Saudi reinforcements, hurried from the Hejaz, retook Jizan. Reinforce ments to the number of about 2,500 passed southward from Jedda. both by sea in sanbuqs and a chartered German steamer, and by land in all the lorries which could be mustered. They formed a coastal expeditionary force which, by about the end of December and after what seems to have been considerable fighting, subdued the whole coastal region as far south as the Yemeni border. The Idrisi himself and his remaining adherents were apparently driven into a pocket in the highlands backing on the Yemen. Meanwhile, a second expeditionary force under the Saudi Amir of Khurma, Khalid-bin-Luwey, known for his sacking of Hashimite Taif, had set out southward from that region, gathering tribal contingents of camelmen on the way until it was some 5,000 strong. It reached Abha in northern Asir about the 25th November, and after some fighting moved on southward to Sabya. Khalid-bin-Luwey died on the way of illness, said the official communique. He was replaced by his son Saad, while Abdul Aziz-bin- Musaid, Governor of Hail and cousin of the King, was designated Governor- General of the province with headquarters at Abha. A third force, composed of Nejdi Ikhwan under the Amir Khalid-bin-Muhammad, nephew of Ibn Saud, was reported to have set out from Riyadh for Asir and to have started operating there at about the same time as Khalid-bin-Luwey’s force, but it has since disappeared from view. It seems possible that it is lying in reserve in case trouble eventuates with the Yemen. 365. By early January the Saudi Government seemed to have most of the situation in hand again. Seyyid Hasan-al-Idrisi was in his retreat in the Asir highlands, and had not responded to the Saudi invitation to surrender and receive pardon. The Saudi Government claimed that the majority of his tribesmen, however, had submitted within the period of grace allowed. 366. Ibn Saud sent an envoy to the Imam Yahya in December. The person chosen, one Muhammad-bin-Dhawi, is a subordinate employee in the King’s divan at Riyadh, and seems to be of little personal importance. International. HL-Foreign Relations. 367. The Saudi Government announced in the local press in November that they had been invited to take part in the World Economic Conference in London. It is not yet known whether they have accepted the invitation, which was not. in any case, conveyed through the British Legation. Great Britain. 368. Relations were neither close nor disturbed to any unusual extent. The Transjordan and Asir situations caused a certain activity, described inChapter II. The question of emergency landing grounds for aircraft on the Hasa coast was carried a stage forward, as recorded in Chapter IV. Money claims were in no way advanced, save only by the signing of another and perhaps final agreement in November by the Ministry of Finance with the local agents of “ Egyptian Shell ” to pay for the oil stolen by the Saudi Government in 1931. N 369. His Majesty’s Minister returned from leave of absence on the ^Ist December, but was unable to do any business of importance with the Saudi Government before the new year. Italy. 370. The new Italian Minister displayed great interest in the course of events in Asir, and was in heavy telegraphic correspondence with Rome throughout. Italo-Saudi relations were ruffled by an unannounced and unwelcome visit paid by an Italian naval vessel to the Asiri coast in December, while the revolt was in full swing (see paragraph 383). The Netherlands. 371. M. Adriaanse, Charge d’Affaires. returned from leave on the 20th November, bearing yet another letter from Queen Wilhelmina, which he is to deliver personally to the Imam Yahya. This correspondence is beginning to embarrass him. (It may here be noted that, in paragraph 129 of the printed version of the April report, “ from Queen Wilhelmina ” was a misprint for the original words, “ for Queen Wilhelmina.”) Turkey. 372. A new Charge d’Affaires, Djelal Bey, arrived on the 18th December, but without credentials. He was, nevertheless, received by the Amir Feisal on the 23rd December. He was preceded on the 4th December by the two Turkish artillery officers mentioned in paragraph 315 of the last report, disguised for some obscure reason, and quite ineffectually, as journalists. Their visit is further recorded in paragraph 380. Persia. 373. M. Hoveida also returned from leave on the 18th December, and once again shouldered the task of being Charge d'Affaires. Iraq. 374. Despite the correctness of the relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and the readiness shown last summer in high Saudi circles (see paragraph 269) to acclaim King Feisal as a good neighbour and a sterling Arab, there were indications in November that the King of Iraq, while more prudent than his brother Abdullah, may continue to be equally hostile to the continuance of Ibn Saud’s rule in the Hejaz. 375. The Iraqi Charg^ d’Affaires elect having been enrolled in the new Cabinet as Minister of Defence, and none being yet named to Jedda in his stead, the previous Charge d’Affaires’ first secretary, Nasir Bey-el-Gaylani, returned to Jedda on the 6th November as Charge d’Affaires ad interim. One of his first duties was to attempt to safeguard the immovable properties left by the Hashimites in the Hejaz from what appears to be the Saudi decision to confiscate them in punishment of the Sharif Abdullah. Egypt. 376. Hafiz Amer Bey, consul, left Jedda on the 10th November, on what he described as short leave to see his family, but remained absent during the remainder of the year. Saudi Arab Air Force. IV.—Am Matters. 377. The air mission to Angora has not yet materialised (see paragraph 380). Emergency Landing Grounds. 378. The Air Council’s desiderata were received in November for communi cation to the Saudi Arab Government. They concerned British military aircraft10 only, and comprised the provision of three emergency landing grounds and seaplane anchorages on the Hasa coast for the use of service aircraft whenever needed, the selection and preparation of the sites in consultation with experts of the Royal Air Force, their maintenance in proper condition by the local authorities under expert advice, their quarterly inspection by Royal Air Force officers, permission for service aircraft to fly along and over the coast-line, byi^ not inland, at any time, with a view to familiarising pilots with the terrain^ permission also for relief machines to use the grounds and anchorages, and, finally, the conclusion of an agreement embodying these desiderata, valid for five years, and terminable by either Government at six months' notice thereafter. Prior to addressing the Saudi Government on these lines, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires raised certain points for His Majesty’s Government’s consideration in connexion with civilian aircraft, particularly those of Imperial Airways flying the Far East route. It was not thought necessary to make provision for the former, while, as regards the latter, the Air Ministry considered the likelihood of four-engined aircraft, which are flown under a policy of avoiding undue risk, having to land on the Hasa coast as extremely remote. Their desiderata, confined to service aircraft, were therefore conveyed to the Saudi Government in a note dated the 13th December, which added that, in the improbable event of any Imperial Airways machine having to make a forced landing, His Majesty’s Government relied on the humane Saudi Arab Government to secure its safety. .4 erial T res pass. 379. On the 5th December the Saudi Government protested against the flight of a British aeroplane over Jubail on the Hasa coast on the 27th November. It was eventually established that an Imperial Airways machine, obliged to fly by night, had lost its way and flown over Jubail to get bearings. Regret has been expressed to the Saudi Arab Government, who have been informed that Imperial Airways were being warned scrupulously to avoid flying over Saudi territory. . V.— Military Matters. Mihtary M ission. 380. The arrival of the two Turkish military officers foreshadowed in paragraph 315 of the last report has been noted in paragraph 372. It is not yet definitely known whether delivery of the 100 rifles and two mitrailleuses was made at the same time. The Saudi military and air mission to Angora for instructional purposes has not yet been finally formed. It is learned that the two Turkish artillerymen, besides expressing disappointment at the lack of facilities given them to inspect the old Ottoman pieces in the Hejaz, also expressed surprise that the mission would consist of only ten to fifteen students. They seem to have expected fifty. It is believed that the Turkish Government are, furthermore, prepared to meet all expenses, other than the cost of the journey; nevertheless, there seems to be a hitch somewhere, for the mission is materialising unaccountably slowly. It may be because of an uneasy feeling that Wahhabi youth will be corrupted in Allahless Turkey. General. 381. Measures to crush the revolt in Asir and a supposed concentration of Ikhwan northward in the direction of Transjordan have been reported in chapter II. ^ . 7 VI.— Naval Matters. British. 382. No visits were paid by His Majesty’s ships to Saudi ports during November and December. On the 17th November, H.M.S. Hastings {Captain C. S. Sandford) altered programme to visit Kamaran to get a somewhat closer view of the troubles in Asir, but to avoid the Farsan Islands which lie off the Asiri coast. Foreign. 383. The Italian navy was less tactful. Either on instructions from Rome or Asmara, or on the commander’s initiative, one of the coastguard vessels stationed in Eritrean waters visited Jizan on the 21st December without the formality of previous warning and in the middle of the Asir revolt. After i r11 causing some local stir and being in effect warned off by the local Saudi officials, the vessel proceeded to Farsan and thence down the coast to another Asiri “ port,” Madhaya. Mecca was indignant and registered strong protests with the Italian representative in Jedda. M. de Peppo explained that, as the Saudi Government themselves had left everyone so much in the dark about the true ^course of events in Asir, the Italian authorities had had to probe matters for themselves, in the interests of their trading community in Eritrea, which was heavily hit by the unrest in Asir. The Italian Government are said to have admitted a breach in the international practice governing naval visits, but they assured the Saudi Government of the Italian Government’s entirely friendly feelings. Anyhow, the explanations offered sufficed to end the incident. r 7 . VII.— Pilgrimage. Indian. 384. During November the Legation was required to supply the Government of India with material for reply to a number of questions asked in the Legislative Assembly regarding conditions of the approaching pilgrimage to Mecca. The Government of India published on the 26th November the tentative estimate of the cost of this pilgrimage prepared by the Legation. There has so far been no sign of a repetition of last season s controversy as to costs (see paragraph 95), the nearest approach being some slightly misleading press statements made in India by Jamal Pasha-al-Ghazzi, who styled himself Saudi Minister for War until called to order by the Saudi Government. He has now let the Indian press know that he is a private individual, but in reality he and Ismail Ghuznavi, the agitator, are paid propagandists of the Saudi Government. The former is also receiving Rs. 500 (£37 10.-?.) a month from Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co., who hold an effectual monopoly of the Indian pilgrim trade, to boost the pilgrimage for them. . . VIII.— Slavery. M anumissions. 385. One Sudani male slave, who had taken refuge in October, and one Sudani male and two Sudani female slaves, who took refuge in November and December, were freed and repatriated during this period. Two Abyssinian male slaves took refuge at the end of December. Enslavement of Pilgrims. 386. The suspected case reported in paragraph 332 was, after investigation by the Saudi Government, found to be not proven. The Legation referred the results of the enquiry to Lagos for such check thereon as might be possible. ^ . IX.— Miscellaneous. Deportations. 389. Mirza Suleiman Ahmed (paragraph 109) was at length permitted to return after an expiation of nearly a year in exile. A Nigerian, employed for long years jointly by the Legation and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey, albeit in one of the meanest of tasks, was sentenced by the Sharia Court in November to deporta tion for distilling alcoholic liquor. In view of his joint allegiance he could not be afforded Legation protection, but he was enabled to leave in the guise of a free man and with some hope of return. Staff. 390. His Majesty’s Minister returned from leave on the 21st December. Mr. Gamble left jedda on the 31st December on transfer to Tehran.[655 f—1] b / 1,2.9^ 9 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL.

King Abdul Aziz (Ibn Saud) returned to Nejd in the beginning of September, having spent just five busy and critical months in the Hejaz—the first two devoted to pilgrimage and civil affairs, the last three to quelling rebellion. He left Taif, the summer resort of his western capital, on the 6th September andmBS'SHH! vmmbr ■■■■■■ 2 arrived at his eastern capital, Riyadh, on the 8th September. He was accom panied by his three surviving brothers, sons numbers 4, 7, 9, 13, 15 and 16, a couple of nephews, and the usual ex-enemy Rashidi young. Sons 1 and 3, the Amirs Sand and Muhammad, met him at Riyadh, son 2, the Amir Feisal, remained in the Hejaz as his Viceroy and apparently in charge of his seven other little brothers. The family removal this year seems to have been less complete* and to have been attended by much less pomp and expenditure than in 1931 (vide duly report, paragraph 1). Nor did it receive the same press attention. 281. It seems that before leaving Taif, Ibn Saud convened a family conference to discuss succession to his throne. He himself wished to name his eldest son as heir apparent. His elder brother Muhammad apparently agreed, thus belying or abandoning the stubborn claim to the succession which he was believed to have upheld for so long. The King’s second and younger brother, Abdullah, appears to have been more interested in making sure that the family allowances would continue to be paid. His second son, Feisal, is said to have raised no objection to Sand’s inheritance of the throne. And so it was agreed, according to hearsay, which may in fact be no more than intelligent guesswork. But the information given in paragraph 287 below confirms the result, if not the steps by which it was reached. 282. It is further said that the King has now made over his political diwan ” to the Amir Saud, watching his methods, guiding his actions and retaining for himself only a reduced Royal “ diwan ' headed by Sheikh Yussuf Yasin and manned by a few clerks. It is too soon to be able to state whether this is strictly true or not, but it is not altogether improbable, although even the enlightened Philip of Macedon did not go quite so far in the kingly education of Alexander the Great. 283. Ibn Saud was more given to deeds than words during the months which passed after his Meccan oration of May (vide paragraph 155). He granted the more readily, no doubt, if he did not actually command, an interview with the rising Mecca newspaper, Saut-al-Hijaz, or Voice of the Hejaz, which was published just after His Majesty left for Riyadh. It contained much rambling, indecisive comment on the Ibn Rifada rebellion and Arab unity, reported in Legation despatch No. 399 of the 23rd September. Change of Title. 284. As from the 22nd September the title of “ the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies ’’ was changed by Royal decree to that of “ Saudi Arabia.” There is sometimes much in a name. Here is Ptolemy’s 2nd century “ Arabia Deserta ” —that geographic, nomadic interval between provincial “ Arabia Petraea ” in the north and the verdant, settled southern fringes called “ Arabia Felix ”— taking 20th century form and individuality as “ Arabia Saudiya.” Between whiles, this same space produced one of the great brotherhood religions of the world, which divided the world at large and failed to unite even its own faithful. It has since thrown up military chieftains of its own and suffered invasions and partial occupation by others, but none have left their mark. Recently, it has bred a king, who for thirty-two years now has combined religious fervour with military force and political activity, to impose himself and effective unity on its inhabitants, and finally to mark its map with his name. 285. Time has begun its test. The first reaction has been vainglorious. The Government press has tried to make believe that the change of title was made in response to an Arabia-wide appeal, which sprang spontaneously from the heartfelt conviction that Hejazis and Nejdis are brothers. There is every reason on the contrary to believe that the response was decided upon before the appeal was engineered. It was then launched simultaneously, telegraphically and by wireless, from all over the country on the word from Mecca. The press has also been claiming foi* Saudi Arabia the premier position in the pan-Ai’abia to be. This attitude is, no doubt, calculated to impress the politicians of Bagdad, news of whose preparation for a pan-Arab conference this winter, coupled with evidence of King Feisal’s penchant to embrace Syria, has not been welcome to some of their Arab brothers further south. So the Mecca press has been lauding the past glories of Arabia Deserta, which only faded when unity was lost, and boasting of the present unity and strength of Arabia Saudiya, affirming that Allah ordained the peninsula as the centre of all Arab union, a country geographically apart and militarily secure, so that he who holds it must needs be[655 f—1] B 2 3 strong and able to protect his neighbours. It looks as though Ibn Sand is now setting himself to win hegemony. 286. In this connexion, it is worth noting that at the beginning of September propaganda on behalf of Ibn Sand was being spread in Palestine by leaders of the Istiqlal party and Syrian Nationalists, with whom both Sheikh Yussuf Yasin and Fuad Bey Hamza appear to be closely connected. New Constitution. 287. The Royal edict decreeing the change of title also charged the Council of Ministers with the task of drawing up a new Constitution to replace that of 1926, and of establishing the succession to the throne. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 15th October that the drafting of the Constitution would take two years, and that the succession to the throne would be vested in the King’s eldest son. Ministry for h'oreiyn A ffairs. 288. The Under-Secretary, who had come to Jedda on the 29th August, and then received from His Majesty's Minister his own and the Amir FeisaFs Grants of Dignity in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, had a final inter view with Sir Andrew Ryan on the 1st September and returned to Taif the same day. The Amir Feisal came to Jedda on the 23rd September in his capacity as Viceroy to attend the local celebration of the previous day’s Id at Tauhid—Union Day (see paragraph 284). He returned the next day but was back again on the 27th September, in the same capacity, to receive the new Italian Minister’s credentials. The only contact made on foreign affairs was when the Under secretary visited Jedda from the 13th to the 18th October. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had some talk with him on the 15th. The Foreign Ministry’s Assistant Secretary still functions in Jedda as an animated telephone connexion with the seat of Government. His quality may be judged by the tale that, when asked by way of polite telephonic overture to business how he is, he is apt to reply precipitately that he must ask his Government. Finance. 289. Throughout October a new “ Regulation respecting the Ministry of Finance ' has been given piecemeal to the public in the press and is still appearing in serial form. It makes dull reading. Of more moment is the chronic constipation of the Treasury. To shift the metaphor a little further on, the Treasury would seem to have all the properties of a septic tank if it were not for the strong suspicion that, not only are the drains defective, but there is also a lucrative overflow, set very low, into a royal reservoir. While it is said by those “ in the know ' that the tank contains two trapped compartments in the shape of safes, labelled “ Reserve Fund ” and “ Debts,” built in by the “budget ” of 1931 (see November-December report, paragraph 4), and now filled with liquid gold, nevertheless officials' salaries are still five months in arrear (except the Director of Customs, who has managed to get some months ahead), all foreign creditors have whistled themselves dry (including the Soviets, who started whistling last), such drafts on Customs as have been accepted by local creditors, e.g., officials, are being passed in Mecca at 34 per cent, of their face value, the market rate of the riyal is 18J to the gold £ as against the official rate which is still 10 (thus involving the original holders of drafts given for gold debt in a final loss of about 80 per cent.), and, even more noteworthy, the Finance Minister has had to raise a private loan of £1.100 in order to humour the Amir Feisal and eke out his £200 deposit for a new Isotto-Fraschini, delivered strictly for cash against documents. There was no apparent difficulty, however, in producing £1.500 similarly required for the King's Isotto. Nor is it thought that the Finance Minister fails to draw the 12,000 rivals or some £675 a month, to which he is stated on good authority to be entitled from the privy purse, or reservoir. All of which goes to show where the money goes and where it does not, how the Finance Minister is the King’s man and no one else's, but how also he will avoid bad blood and oblige the Viceroy, if it can be done without tapping the tank. He probably has as little compunction, however, in keeping the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs short of money as he evidently has in keeping spies to watch him, butthen “ it's all fair pulling.'' Meanwhile he is building himself a country seat near Jedda. 290. The Government's external debt still amounts to nearly £200,000 gold. It is comprised of some £50,000 owing to the Poles (vide paragraph 70), at least £25,000 owing to the Bahrein Qusaibis, £30,000 to the Soviets, £15,000 to the } Shell Company, £15,000 to the Standard Oil Company, £15,000 to the Marconi Company, £10,000 to the Government of India, £10,000 to German firms, £5,000 the Nederlandische Handel-Maatschappij, £2,500 to the Eastern Telegraph M^Company, and £1.700 to His Majesty's Government. £40,000 worth of these commitments mature finally in November (most of the rest are rotten with age), and £25,000 worth have been discounted and even rediscounted in Europe. Perhaps the safe marked “ Debts ' really has got something in it. Economics. 291. Hejazi merchants placed some £150,000 abroad during the summer, it was reliably learned in October, in payment chiefly for stocks for the coming pilgrimage, about which hopes have run unreasonably high. An all-round increase of customs dues is being considered. In October some £500 worth of contraband tobacco was publicly burned in Mecca; it is easy to smuggle into creeks by dhow, especially to the north of Jedda. It was only burned by the authorities because they found no money in it, the duty on tobacco being 90 piastres a kilog., while this stuff was of a grade which would not fetch at auction more than 35 piastres a kilog. Rather than attempt to sell it retail, they preferred to rid the market of it in the hope, perhaps fond, that importers would now patronise the Customs. Wireless. 292. Saudi Arabia is now knit by a network of twenty-two wireless stations, the last of which is in process of completion at Riyadh; these are supplemented by six mobile sets. The two capital stations, Mecca and Riyadh, are relatively powerful—6 kw. Marconis. The rest are \ kw. installations, nine of them consisting of modern Marconi telegraphy and telephony plant, but with single aerial permitting only one-way communication—namely, those at A1 Ula, Tabuk, Qaf or Qaryat-al-Milh, Skaka, Bureyda, Jubail, Qatif, Uqair and Hufuf; the other eleven are old Turkish-installed Telefunken telegraphy plants, namely, those at Jizan, Abha, Qunfida. Taif, Jedda, Rabigh, Yanbu, Medina, A1 Wejh, Dhaba, and Hail. All these latter, except the last, are relics of the Turkish domination of Asir and the Hejaz; that at Hail is a relic of their association with the then semi-independent Rashidi Amirate. 293. Thus Ibn Saud now has a chain of seven wireless stations in Red Sea ports, a string of six stations a little way inland of these, a line of five stations down the centre of the peninsula and a group of four stations on the Persian Gulf; plus four mobile motor plants and two hand sets. Legislation. 294. Part of a “Regulation to Facilitate Business Transactions” was published in September. A “ Regulation Respecting the Ministry of Finance ’’ began publication in October. {'ommittee of Virtue. 295. As is usual between pilgrimage seasons, this Puritan committee's) soldiers have recently again been maltreating the Mecca population, which from all accounts thoroughly deserves it. Locusts. 296. As a result of a further attempt by Sir Andrew Ryan, made in conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 1st September, to induce some sort of co-operation in the Saudi Government by the observation and reporting of locust swarms, a short memorandum was prepared in the Legation summarising in simple form the kind of information required. This Fuad Bey undertook in October to have distributed in Arabic, with a further promise to furnish the Legation with any reports received from the interior. The Nejd breeding grounds are believed to be of importance.’ • II .—Frontier Questions. Transjordan. Raiding. 297. No raids either way were reported as having taken place during September and October. When the old matter of liquidating the raid oi e 28th September, 1931, and thereby other raids of the past, was resuscitated, tne Saudi Arab Government replied on the 23rd October still maintaining that t e victims, the Atun section of the Huweytat, were their subjects and should have come to them for justice. Aftermath of Rebellion. 298. British military forces were withdrawn from the Aqaba area on the 2nd September, the Arab Legion taking it over. The Transjordan authorities reported on the 3rd September that the economic blockade of the disaffected area had been raised. By the middle of the month between ^0(1 and 30 refugees had been disarmed and dispersed in Transjordan and into Sinai. a part of the Beni Atiya rebel contingent under Ibn Farhan remained unaccounted for in the Hisma country south of the border. All property in the Hejaz of rebels and their sympathisers was confiscated by a decree of the 2nd September. Mutual Recognition. 299. On the 1st September His Majesty's High Commissioner for Trans jordan drew from the Amir Abdullah the promise that in deference to Hl j Majesty’s Government's wishes he was ready to recognise Ibn Saud unconditionally as King of the Hejaz and Nejd. He begged that recognition should be mutual. On the 11th September King Feisal visited Amman and the Arabic press soon afterwards announced that he had persuaded his brother to recognise Ibn Saud. His Majesty s Government’s views as to the establishment of future relations were conveyed to Ibn Saud on the 6th October. His reply of the 13th October announced his readiness to recognise the Amir Abdullah as ruler of Transjordan and to enter treaty negotiations under certain conditions. Beni A tiya. 300. Half-way through October the Acting High Commissioner for Trans jordan decided as a disciplinary measure to remove certain sections of the Beni Atiya, who were still camped at Kerak, back into the Hejaz. At his urgent request His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires informed the Saudi Arab Government of the decision Although they agreed to the move, it was delayed pending a full discussion between the Transjordan authorities and His Majesty’s Government of a number of points of principle as well as detail. Haditha. 301. This place (vide paragraphs 249 and 250) was found in October to be on the Nejdi side of the frontier. So a formula was prepared in which this information was conveyed to the Saudi Government in such a way as not to commit His Majesty’s Government irrevocably. Iraq. 302. News was received in September that a little frontiei fiiction caused by an over-zealous Iraqi official in July had been satisfactoiily removed and the man punished. A somewhat similar case which had also arisen in July, but from the Nejdi side, does not seem to have been settled, nor has anything more been heard of the Judaidat-al-Arar dispute (vide paragraph 252). Koweit and Bahrein. “ Blockade ” of Koweit. 303. Although the practical difficulties raised by Ibn Saud to the dutying of his subjects’ imports over the Koweit frontier do not seem to affect their very [655 f—1] B 36 similar trade across the Iraq frontier, as one might be led to expect, discussion of the blockade, in which this argument might have been used, has not been renewed at Jedda. But it is now clear that argument will take as little effect on Ibn Sand as an appeal to his good nature. There is reason to believe that he is bent on reducing Koweit, by hook or by crook, to a state of dependence on himself, an attitude which it will take some more material lever to correct. Bahrein Transit Dues. 304. Dues recently levied on goods from India delivered overside at Bahrein in transhipment to the Nejdi mainland having been paid by Ibn Saud’s agents without demur, it was decided that it was unnecessary formally to denounce the old concession of 1920 (vide paragraphs 49, 191 and 255). A sir and the Yemen. 305. There has been no disturbance apparent in the one nor impairment of relations with the other. III .—Foreign Relations. General. International Health Bureau. 306. Two Saudi Arab delegates sailed on the 9th September to attend the Paris October meetings for the first time, one a Syrian doctor with a murderous reputation, the other a Syrian jack of all trades, who has hitherto been employed in buying arms. Great Britain. His Majesty's Minister. 307. Sir Andrew Ryan left Jedda in H.M.S. Penzance on the 2nd September for three and a half months’ leave of absence. Mr. Hope Gill assumed the duties of Charge d’Affaires. General. 308. There was a welcome relaxation in relations from the close contacts of the previous three months necessitated by the rebellion. The progress made in matters affecting Transjordan, pilgrimage, and slaverv is reported in chapters II, VII and VIII. Claims. 309. No progress was made, in spite of considerable haggling between the Ministry of Finance and the Shell C ompany s agents, supported by the Legation for the settlement of the benzine debt of a year back. France. 3!0 The French Charge d'Affaires, M. Maigret, went on short leave on the 14th September, leaving the French consulate in the charge of a Syrian clerk. Italy. 311. Commendatore Ottavio de Peppo, first Italian Minister to this country reached Jedda on the 25th September and presented his credentials two days later. He is accompanied by a diplomatic secretary, M. Tonci, who has served in Morocco and Tunis and knows some Arabic. 312. On his passage down the Red Sea to Eritrea in October, the King of Italy exchanged wireless greetings with Ibn Saud. 313. Some more virulent anti-Italian propaganda in Arabic was received during September in the Legation, and no doubt elsewhere, by post from Syria {vide July-August report 1931, paragraph 57).7 Soviet Russia. 314. In spite of a series of conversations held in Jedda in October between the Soviet Minister and the Saudi Minister of Finance supported by Fuad Bey Hamza, no substantial progress seems to have been achieved towards a Soviet loan or facilities for Soviet trade. It is thought that M. Turacoulov has ^ been made to press more insistently than he would have liked for payment for the Soviet benzine supplied in 1931. Turkey. 315. The Saudi Arab Government are arranging to send a mission to Turkey to receive military and aeronautical instruction and a press notice issued on the 16th September called for volunteers. On the 10th October the Turkish Ambassador in London informed the Secretary of State that his Government were on the point of sending two Turkish officers to Ibn Saud with 100 rifles and two mitrailleuses, ordered by the Amir Feisal when at Angora last June, but no ammunition. They would also inspect and repair some cannon dating from the Ottoman occupation. Ferit Bey apparently made no mention of the mission {cf. paragraph 65). Iraq. 316. Frontier relations are mentioned in paragraph 302. 317. On the occasion of Iraq’s entry into the League of Nations Ibn Saud telegraphed to King Feisal that he shared his brother’s and the Iraq nation s delight and pleasure. An equally warm response was wirelessed back. 318. The Iraqi Charge d’Affaires elect seems unready to come to Jedda. One of the first questions which he will have to tackle is an apparent usurpation by the Saudi Government of the revenues of all Hashimite properties in the Hejaz. IV.— Air Matters. Saudi A rob A ir Force. 319. There has been no response to the memorandum regarding a possible Royal Air Force mission which was handed to Fuad Bey Hamza on the 11th August (vide paragraph 270), but, as described in paragraph 315, prepara tions are being made to send a Saudi Arab mission to Turkey for instruction. Emergency Landing Grounds. 320. Imperial Airways began on the 1st October to use the Arabian instead of the Persian Coast for their eastern airway. No arrangements had by then A been made for placing at their disposal the emergency landing grounds discussed in May (vide paragraph 217), nor had the Air Ministry’s statement of desiderata been received at the Legation by the end of October. 321. His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq telegraphed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 26th September the information that on the 10th September a Rangoon flying-boat had forced-landed at Jinna through engine trouble, but that spares had been flown to it the following day, enabling it to proceed to Bahrein. Owing to the lapse of time the Saudi Government were not informed, nor have they remarked on the matter. V.— Military Matters. Military Mission. 322. The proposed despatch of a military mission to Turkey for instructions and the expected arrival of two Turkish officers with arms for Ibn Saud have been noted in paragraph 315. General. 323. The aftermath of the rebellion is reported in paragraph 298. By October all the Akhwan levies collected in the Northern Hejaz and at Taif to deal with Ibn Rifada and any concurrent trouble seem to have dispersed into Nejd.I KBHHHHHHHHHi RSTW' 8 Tribal leaders are said to have collected at Riyadh in some numbers to meet Ibn Saud after his return to Nejd and draw on his bounty. Nothing is known of what, if anything, transpired between them and the King in regard to his promise, reported in paragraph 245, in which he undertook to keep them informed of the progress of his negotiations with His Majesty’s Government vis-a-vis Transjordan. VI. —Naval Matters. British. 324. H.M.S. Penzance (Commander A. R. Farquhar, R.N.) arrived at Jedda on the 30th August and embarked His Majesty’s Minister and sailed for Port Sudan on the 2nd September. 325. H.M.S. Hastings (Captain C. S. Sandford, R.N.) altered programme somewhat in order to lie at Port Sudan from the 22nd to the 26th September, in case naval assistance should be required at Jedda for the embarkation of a slave manumitted by the Legation (vide chapter VIII). Foreign. 326. The new Persian fleet, consisting of six small, diesel-driven coastal units of under 1,000 tons, visited Jedda from the 5th to the 7th October, on their way from Italy to the Gulf. They made a good impression. VII.— Pilqrimaqe. Indian. 327. A large number of questions affecting the Indian pilgrimage has been treated with the Government of India. Consideration was given to a compre hensive memorandum by the Government of India on various matters raised in the Legation’s pilgrimage reports for 1930 and 1931. The Government propose to deal with these reports in future soon after they are received; this should much facilitate the work of all engaged in the Indian pilgrimage organisation. On the 6th October the Legation forwarded to the Government of India a tentative estimate of the cost in rupees of the 1933 (1351) pilgrimage. This was made out in detail for three grades of traveller, first-class steamer and by car, second-class steamer and by bus, and deck passage and by camel. The totals came to (1) 1,700 rupees, or about £130; (2) 1.225 rupees, or about £90; and (3) 570 rupees, or about £45; the expenses being reckoned from home to home. Javanese. 328. The prospects of the coming Javanese pilgrimage, the earliest to start and generally the most numerous of all, are extremely bad. A sum equivalent to 29,000 rupees, or something over £2,000, has been subscribed in Java to enable some of the large numbers of pilgrims of former years, now destitute in Mecca, to return home. The Saudi Arab Government, however, are endeavouring to defer anything like a mass repatriation until after the pilgrimage, from fear of its adverse effect on would-be pilgrims. Propaganda. 329. The Saudi Arab Government are maintaining agents and subsidising newspapers in India, Java and elsewhere to advertise the pilgrimage. This propaganda is likely to be more marked than last year. An enlarged edition of the pilgrimage propaganda pamphlet has been distributed wholesale in various languages. VIII.— Slavery. Manumissions. 330. The two male slaves who had taken refuge in the Legation in August were manumitted and repatriated to Abyssinia in September. One belonged to the Assistant Governor of Jedda, the other to a leading merchant, and efforts were made by the authorities to detain both by charging them with theft ; but thesewere successfully set aside. Another Abyssinian took refuge and was repatriated in October. Local emancipation was secured for a female Abyssinian, who took refuge in September and was willing to return to her master as a free woman, her Sharia document of freedom being bled in the Legation. 331. Four Sudanis also took refuge. Two were got away to Port Sudan without difficulty. One, who had escaped from the King's elder brother, the Amir Muhammad, was claimed by the Saudi Arab Government, on the ground that he was a Royal slave. It looked as though it might be even more difficult to get him away than it proved to embark Bakhit (vide paragraphs 100 to 105), and steps were taken to have a sloop in readiness at Port Sudan to visit Jedda if necessary. But the Saudi Arabs responded to no more than reason, and the man was allowed to embark without incident, accompanied by a senior member of the Legation. The fourth Sudani slave is still in hand. Enslavement of Pilgrims. 332. A case of the alleged selling of his wife into slavery at Medina by a Nigerian pilgrim was brought to the notice of the Saudi Arab Government by the Legation in October, with a request for its investigation and for the release of the woman and punishment of the man, if proved. IX.— Miscellaneous. Staff. 333. Sir Andrew Ryan went on three and a half months’ leave on the 2nd September. Mr. Hope Gill took over from the Minister as Charge d’Affaires. Captain Lewis left Jedda on the 28th September, on resignation after twenty- one months’ service as second archivist. Mr. R. V. Hall joined the staff as second archivist on the 9th October.r / In any fnrtlier communication on thi* subject, please quote £ Lv'UtU »ml address —not to any person by name, but to— ' I be Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

The King remained at Taif, except for short outings m the neighbour hood from the 1st July to the 29th August, when he left for Jedda m order it was explained, to take leave of the foreign representatives before Proceeding to Riyadh. In the ordinary course he would have gone to Nejd much earlier bu he was prevented from doing so by the Ibn Rifada affair and the general situation which it precipitated. On the 30th August he received the foreign representatives in successive formal audiences in the forenoon. Later m the_day he again received His Maiesty's Minister, who presented Commander Farcjuhar ot H.M.fe. “ Penzance ” and then discussed the general situation with His Majesty, but on-mum mum mummmmumuu mum lines so general that the conversation was of no great interest. Sir A Ryan made way after an hour or so for the Soviet Minister. The King appeared to be in much bettei health than when Mr. Hope Gill saw him at the beginning of May. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 230. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin continued to act as Minister until the 3rd Augufli* when he and Fuad Bey Hamza, who had arrived at Taif from Koweit via RiyaSP on the 24th July, announced that the one had handed over and the other taken on he business of foreign affairs. When the Amir Feisal, who had stayed behind at Riyadh, got back on the 7th August, no further move was made. The position appears to be that the Amir has slid back into his post as Minister for Foreign Altairs, but that Fuad Bey is more than ever the practical head of the Ministry. Ijp to the end of the month Fuad Bey continued to sign notes, sometimes saying ducted without saying by whom. There is doubtless some game behind this but its nature is obscure. It may be merely the game of Fuad, who affects m any case the title of “ Deputy Minister,' or there mav be some truth in the suggestion made m some quarters that the Amir is dissatisfied with the confidence reposed by the King in Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and is unwilling to tolerate at gentleman s retention If so, the Prince has had no uncertain answer from his father, as will be seen below. Finance. 231. There have been no public developments in the financial situation. It is a curious thing that one has heard of late much less talk than one used to of the depletion of the Treasury or of poverty among the public generally, and none 'iL p'f 0 1 finan .T stringency interfering with measures to suppress the V mi d a revolt, to subsidise_ the Akhwan, &amp;c. The Government as such is doubtless as poor as ever Unpaid officials, merchants, &amp;c., are probably too . unken m depression to make much noise. The apparent abundance of money for unitary and quasi-military purposes lends support to the idea that the King has long been saving up for a rainy day. ' nn im 3 OQtl T T?i DU f tCh ajfviser, M. van Leeuwen, left for three months i the 29th July, for leasons of health. These were genuine and he showed no on g in hPw lnte, ’ d,n ?. t0 return ' nor any sign whatsoever of intending to stay on in the Hejaz once his contract expires next year. Little is known as to what he has done or been allowed to attempt. a 233. On the 22nd August it was announced that, by tradei Sonie (the old urkish expression for an Imperial decree, seldom heard under the Saudian regime, though apparently not unprecedented), the Wakalat of Finance had been raised to the status of a Wazarat or full Ministry, with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman as Minister and his brother Hamad as Wakfl. i.e„ Under-Secretary “ I-uad Bey Hamza s version, Deputy Minister,” be preferred. Previously there had been only two Ministers called Wazarat, or possibly three including that of ^rson^lhe^Siir FeiiaT. ere ^ PreSidenCy ° f the council in the Economic Affairs. 234. Nothing further has been heard at the Legation of the large economic schemes mentioned in the last report. The dullness was relieved, howfver bv one hi ight gleam from New York. A resident in that city, Mr. L. Lincoln Click' sent to I Bs Majesty s Legation a typed advance copy of a projected paper called'the Congress Advocate, which promises to be a powerful 100 per cent Islamic American organ, and which has already received not only the moral suDnorTof the Egyptian consulate in New York, but also 20 dollars in cash from a leading Moslem in the United States. Mr. Glick has the niwressivo , '.i.i V W 20th century, which he identified with the 16th of the Mahometan era. This°latter f &lt; n' °i U &gt;t eSS T* 5 ® 8a , t ie easler for him to conceive Jedda as being the Citv of Destiny, perhaps the largest in the world, a vast urban area stre cKin?, r * its present site to Rabigh, 100 miles away, served by a loop line of the HeT^ Railway, watered from aqueducts in the mountains, the scene of an annual Islamic f ongress, the goal of throngs of visitors for whom there will tS facilities and mammoth hotels. Nor does Mr. Glick stop there He contemnlllel an enlarged Haram area, which will apparently extend to the new Jedd7w‘thH 3 its clearing house for the pilgrims of all nations. Mr. Glick seems to think that Islam needs pep. Wireless. 235 It was announced on the 15th July that the new wireless stations had completed at Mecca (6 kilowatt), Qatif, Jubail, Hasa (Hufuf) and Oqair, itiu that they were available for ordinary telegraphic correspondence. ® wireless station at Qaf was completed late in August. The charges for internal wireless telegrams was reduced about the same time from 3 piastres niiri to 2 piastres miri per word. Land-line telegrams between Jedda, Mecca and tail cost \ piastre miri per word. Legislation. 236. A new law on passports was published on the 1st July. It does nothing to mitigate the hardship imposed on departing travellers, othei 1 than smgle season pilgrims, by the rule that a guarantor must be found in case there should be any claims on the person leaving the country. . . . . A law on coastal fisheries, &amp;c., is in course of publication by instalments. Regulations governing postal packets were published on the 22nd July. Census. 237. This measure, the announcement concerning which was mentioned in the report for May and June (paragraph 174), was completed during the month of July. Two questions arose in connexion with it, viz. : (a) Whether it could be claimed that forms to be filled up by the Legation staff should be officially furnished to the Legation by the Ministry tor Foreign Affairs, and , , (b) Whether, in the possible event of the measure being a prelude to the eviction from the Hejaz of certain categories of foreigners, His Majesty’s Government could claim right of residence for British subjects and British-protected persons. His Majesty's Minister telegraphed to the Foreign Office on the 5th July requesting a ruling on these two points. On the 13th July, before the Foreign Office's reply had been received, the town crier announced to the inhabitants ol Jedda that anyone who failed to return his census form by the 16th July would be imprisoned. Sir Andrew Ryan thereupon wrote a personal letter to the Mimstiy for Foreign Affairs enquiring whether it was intended that the statt oi the Legation were to be included in the measure, and stating that if so, he wou d be willing to see that the staff completed the forms, provided that the latter were officially sent to him for distribution • , r ^ 238 On the 16th July a reply was received from the Foreign Office confirming the Minister's presumption at {a), and stating that there would be no ground for official protest against the deportation of individual British subjects. It indicated, however, that semi-official representations could be made m certain cases and that objection could be taken to any wholesale expulsion of persons by classes. On the i9th July the Ministry for Foreign Affairs reply was received stating that the necessary number of forms would be sent to the Legation. I hese were duly received, completed and returned. It was thought when the census was announced that it would lead to a rush of applications for passports by British subjects and British-protected persons, and a memorandum was accordingly circulated to the British authorities most closely concerned giving a short resume of the situation, so that they would be in a position to deal expeditiously w ith am applications for passports that might be referred to them by the Legation. In e event, however, the anticipated rush did not materialise. I he result of the census has not yet been published. General Internal Situation. 239. The Ibn Rifada affair, which was dealt w r ith in the last report under the heading £ ‘ Transjordan,' became in July and August the dominant feaXuie oi the internal situation, and can best be dealt with here in conjunction with two connected matters, viz., the Akhwan movement and the repercussions in the Hejaz of the Ad-Dabbagh plot. [571 dd—2] D 24 * 240. The Ibn Rifada adventure itself came to an inglorious end on the 30th July, except for the carnage in detail which followed. There is still much obscurity as to the movements and number of the rebels. It is probable that the whole of Ibn Rifada's forces, including tribal elements who joined him in the Hejaz, never exceeded 1,000 men, inadequately armed and mounted and suffering from shortage of food, owing to the measures taken by the authorities in Trcms^ Jordan, Palestine and Egypt to prevent supplies 'from reaching them by lamCT* sea. The rebels had tarried long at or near Haql, but in July they moved south until the bulk of them were at Huraiba and Sherma, places on or close to the sea eastward from the southern end of the Gulf of Aqaba. There was some prospect of their attacking Muweyla or even Dhaba, where Ibn Sand had garrisons, and they were reported at one moment to be threatening the road between the two. 241. Meanwhile Ibn Saud had been continuing his preparations slowly but methodically. The principal forces intended to be used were the Akhwan levies, which had been summoned to assemble at A1 Ula. It is not known how many gathered there. Estimates varied from 1,500 to 10,000, a Hejazi figure and probably much exaggerated. Whatever the number at A1 Ula, it was sufficient to enable an important contingent under Ibn Aqil to be moved to Dhaba, whence the Akhwan, working in with other Government forces, including camelry under Ibn Sultan, the following of the Amir of Dhaba and a party from Taif under one of the King's own henchmen, marched against the rebels. They located the main body of the latter, apparently some 400 men, at Jebel Shar, a position inland from the road between Dhaba and Muweyla. The battle, or battue, took place on the 30th July. According to the official reports, 370 rebels were killed on the field, a remnant, including twenty men of the Beni Atiya, escaped, and the losses on the Government side were only nine. Ibn Saud gave orders that in the subsequent round-up all persons who had joined the rebels should be killed. Reports published subsequently recorded the slaughter of various parties of rebels in the area between Muweyla, Haql and Alagan, a place some distance inland from Haql. 242. News from Transjordan in the course of August indicated a possibility of a rally of rebel fragments, Imran tribesmen and Beni Atiya, notably those left over from the party which entered the Hejaz on the night of the 26th June (see paragraph 184), at Alagan. If this rally took place, the rebels would appear to have made no effective stand. Much less is known, however, as to what had happened up to the end of August between Alagan and the Hejaz Railway. The position at the end of the month appeared to be that the majority of Ibn Aqil's Akhwan had been sent back to Dhaba, but that there might be a further movement of Government forces from Tebuk to clean up any disaffected area east of Alagan. The Beni Atiya party under Ibn Farhan mentioned above seems to have done some successful raiding and to have recrossed the frontier with looted camels, but to have doubled back again into Hejaz-Nejd and to have left some of the loot at Alagan before dispersing. 243. During the period following the defeat of Ibn Rifada a fair number of stragglers made good their escape into Transjordan. According to a telegram from Transjordan, dated the 31st August, there were, including women, 103 at Aqaba and forty-seven at Maan. 244. It has been said that the Akhwan were the principal element in the forces called up to cope with the rebellion. At first mention was made only of a concentration at A1 Ula, to consist of some 5,000 or 6,000 from the nearer parts of Nejd. It is not certain how many actually assembled. It looked in July as if there might have been some lack of response to the call to arms. This in its turn suggested the possibility of disaffection among part of the Shammar. According to Government publications after the Battle of Jebel Shar and miscellaneous sources of information, there was, in fact, no serious manifestation of disloyalty. On the contrary, the Akhwan spirit was roused all over the country to an extent embarrassing to the King. Large numbers of them came at his summons to Taif, partly to receive their regular gifts of money, &amp;c., partly no doubt to be ready in case of emergency elsewhere, more especially in Asir. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin put the number at 10,000, and another official mentioned as many as 15,000 a day or two later. The numbers may have been exaggerated, but there were certainly not less than 4,000 early in August, largely Ateyba, whose presence was a fairly conclusive refutation of previous rumours of disaffection in the region round Taif itself. Fuad Bey spoke to Sir A. Ryan of other assemblages all the way from the[571 dd—2] b 3 5 \ Koweit border to Taif, a country which he had just traversed on his way back from his travels in Europe, &amp;c. 245. The “ XJmm-al-Qura ” of the 5th August published a very interesting collection of documents bearing on the King's dispositions and the response of the Akhwan to the cry of Jihad, which had been widely raised and had been endorsed by the Ulama of Nejd. The main note in these documents was a general clamour -’“N against any limitation of operations to the unworthy object of reducing Ibn Rifada and a demand that all those who turned out in the cause of religion should be given an equal opportunity of service; service, not against a handful of active rebels, but against the alleged arch-instigator, i.e., the Amir of Transjordan. It was this that embarrassed the King, for all alike appealed to his sense of religious duty as a reason for attacking the real enemy. Ibn Saud would have dearly liked to gratify such a demand, for his own hatred and mistrust of the Amir had grown to a passionate resentment by the end of July; but he knew that any adventure across the frontier would involve him with Great Britain. He had turned on the Akhwan tap to the full. His task in August was to turn it off sufficiently to avert the danger of any irruption into Transjordan and to press His Majesty’s Government to liquidate the situation between himself and his neighbour. He took steps to send as many Akhwan as he could to their homes on a promise to receive them at Riyadh in October and report progress. He hopes to use the breathing-space to get His Majesty's Government to play up to his political aspirations. 246. It must not be supposed that the whole of Nejd, much less the whole of the Hejaz, are loyal at heart. Enquiries in connexion with the Ad-Dabbagh plot have revealed the existence of a widespread conspiracy to ruin Ibn Saud r a conspiracy which has ramifications in Transjordan, possibly in Iraq, certainly in Egypt; in Asir, the Yemen, Aden, part of the Hadramaut coast and at Massawa; and to some extent in the Hejaz itself, e.q., in towns like Mecca and Jedda where many citizens might be expected, not indeed to rise, but to- sympathise. There was apparently a plan to engineer more or less simultaneous movements in the Northern Hejaz and in Asir. In the event the Ad-Dabbaghs and their accomplices were very active, but the only couf which came off was that of Ibn Rifada. 247. It may be said by way of summary that all the active spirits displayed ineptitude, all the important elements, which without being in the plot, might have joined in any promising movement, sat tight on their fences, and Ibn Saud emerged with greatly increased strength and prestige. There would appear to be a minor focus of disaffection at Taima, and there may yet be trouble elsewhere, but he has demonstrated his hold on his dominions as a whole in a very impressive manner. Although merciless in the north, he has shown politic clemency to the persons who were arrested in Jedda and Mecca in June (see paragraph 156). Those who were deported to Riyadh were pardoned late in August. On the other hand a spy, who had apparently been working for the anti-Saudi party in Egypt, was executed in Mecca, after a full confession had been extracted from him. The ban on football in Jedda (see paragraph 157) was removed immediately after the defeat of Ibn Rifada. Death of the Kaimakam of Jedda. 248. Haj ji Abdullah AH Riza, who became Governor of Jedda in the time of King Hussein and was confirmed in the post with the old title of kaimakam by Ibn Saud, died at Taif on the 24th August after an illness of several weeks. He enjoyed a great reputation for sagacity, and, even after ceasing a year or two ago to play much part in the effective government of Jedda, he continued to be consulted by the King on many occasions. Many deprecated the maintenance of a system by which the leading merchant of the town was its highest admini strative official. In business he was a hard bargainer and a keen mind, very well informed, thanks to the extensive connexions of his firm in India and else where. In personal intercourse he was an old gentleman of great charm, and endeared himself to successive British representatives, always maintaining friendly relations with the Agency and Legation. On his death the post was converted into an Amirate and was filled by the appointment of Abdul Aziz-bin- Muammar, previously Governor of Yanbu. This gentleman is a Nejdi from the Qasim, but is well spoken of.6 r Chapter II .—Frontier (Questions. Transjordan. 249. Any few incidents which occurred on the frontier in July and Angus were so bound'up in the general situation, even if they were not directly connected with the rebellion, that they are not worth describing. .. A ' m question arose, however, as to the lie of the frontier itself. The H i (■ ment had complained on the 9th August of a visit by Captain Glubbs patrols to Haditha, a place west by north-west of Qaf. Lhis was !« m g e. v routine matter, when the authorities in Transjordan discovered that a small Wejd post had been established at Haditha for some weeks asserted a strong claim o their own to Haditha and asked that His Majesty s Government should protest They were the more perturbed as the Governor of Qaf was said to intend also occupy Hazim, an important water point, which has always been regaided as Transjordanian, although Fuad Bey Hamza made a formal reservation on the subject in conversation with Sir A. Ryan last January. , , , 250. As the frontier has never been delimited on the ground and there a various defects in the available maps, the question of Haditha assumed m Angus a very delicate character. The authorities m Transjordan consider their t a to be'incontestable, but it became a matter for consideration whether this c a could be asserted without raising an acute question and possibly a controversy regarding the frontier as a whole. His Majesty s Government were still examining the matter in consultation with General Wauchope at the end August. Meanwhile the Hejazi Government have kept up a small but persistent stream of protests against alleged violations of the frontier at Haditha and else where by aeroplanes, cars and patrols from Transjordan. As they all hung too-ether, all remained unanswered up to the end of August. ° 251. Permission was given by the Transjordan Government m June tor Sultan-al-Atrash to settle in Transjordan, not further north than Kerak. Iraq. . , 252. Nothing was heard in July or August of any development at Judaidat- al-Arar (see paragraph 187). See paragraph 269 below as regards political relations. Koweit and Bahrein. 253 There is little to record in connexion with the various questions adverted to in paragraph 189 of the last report, with one important exception. On the 19th August Sir A. Ryan, having first prepared the ground m conversation with Fuad Bey. addressed to him under instructions two communications One was an official' note suggesting that effect should be given to the one practicable proposal which emerged from Colonel Biscoe s discussions on the question o ie Koweit blockade when he visited the King at Hasa last January, namely, that His Majesty and the Sheikh of Koweit should appoint commissioners to discuss the whole question and seek a solution which would enable trade to be lesumed. At the same time Sir A. Ryan wrote a personal letter drawing attention to the laro-e claims of Koweit against Nejd, and intimating that they would be waived, if a satisfactory settlement were reached in the trade negotiations. 254. Ibn Sand's reaction was most disconcerting. He refused to proceed with the proposal for a mixed commission, until the question of the claims, which, he suggested, were being used as a threat, was disposed of. He contended that he and the Sheikh had mutually waived all past claims by an exchange ot letters written after Colonel Biscoe's visit, and, he asserted, as a result of a conversation during that visit. Fuad Bey sent copies of the two letters in question to Sir A Ryan. The latter knew of their existence and understood them to refer only to small every day claims arising out of minor frontier incidents, such as had been under discussion for some time. He put this view forward m a further personal letter to Fuad Bey of the 26th August, and urged in any case that the Kin' should not let the question of claims stand in the way of the proposal to appoint commissioners. This letter produced no effect, for Fuad Bey informed the Minister orally on the 29th August that the King would not move from his attitude. Thus the whole situation called for a fresh examination at the end of August.255. The authorities in the Persian Gulf have adduced strong reasons for formally denouncing the old agreement that transit dues should not be charged in Bahrein on goods for Nejd unloaded over the ship's side into dhows. The question is still under consideration. 256. Ibn Saud sent special messages of sympathy to His Majesty’s Govern- ^^nent and Lady Biscoe on the occasion of the death of Sir Hugh Biscoe on the ^n9th July. A sir and Yemen. 257. There have been no developments in this direction, apart from the activities of the parties to the Ad-Dabbagh conspiracy, which do not appear to have produced any actual effect of importance in Asir, but contributed to the perturbation of Fbn Saud over the general situation described earlier. Chapter III.— Foreign Relations. General. Hejazi Mission. 258. I he Amir heisal s mission did not get on to Persia as quickly as was thought when paragraph 194 of the last report was written. They apparently stayed a night in Tiflis towards the end of June, date uncertain, reached Baku on the 28th June, and embarked in a special steamer for Resht. They reached Tehran on the 1st July and left for Khaniquin on the 5th July, arriving there on the 7th July. They travelled by special train to Bagdad and got there next day. They left Bagdad in Royal Air Force aeroplanes for Koweit early on the 11th July, and after a short stay there proceeded by car to Riyadh, which was reached on the 18th July. The Amir was much impressed by Baku and its oil industry. No account has yet reached Jedda of the visit to Tehran. The visit to Bagdad appears to have been eminently successful, and certainly helped to consolidate relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq (see paragraph 269). King Feisal lent the Amir his country house and they were entertained at dinner by His Majesty on the 8th July, by the Acting Prime Minister on the 9th July and by Sir F. Humphrys on the 10th July. Great Britain. General. 259. The general relations between His Majesty's Government and Hejaz- Nedj remained very friendly during July and August. They were completely dominated by the Ibn Rifada affair, which was the subject of further correspondence and of innumerable conversations between Sir A. Ryan and first Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, then Fuad Bey. The policy of Ibn Saud has been to detach Great Britain, his dearest friend, from the Amir Abdullah, his deadliest enemy, with the object of ruining Abdullah and finding a basis for future relations with Transjordan such that the Amir will play no role or be completely guaranteed by His Majesty’s Government. Harameyn Waqfs. 260. Some further correspondence has passed on this subject, but there has been no important development. Claims. 261. No progress has been made towards a settlement of the money questions outstanding between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud. Sir A. Ryan took an opportunity of bringing them all up to date in conversation with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin at the end of Julv, but he got no money paid. There was some little prospect in August of a direct settlement between Shell and the Minister of finance regarding the benzine affair on the basis of proposals discussed last May between Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and Messrs Gellatlv Hankey and Co. ' ’8 France. 262. Mme. Maigret, the aged mother of the French Charge d'Affaires, died in Jedda on the night of the 8th August, and was temporarily interred in the other-than-Moslem cemetery. 263. M. Maigret, accompanied by a Syrian Christian member of his staff^* went to Taif on the 13th August for a twenty-four hours’ change. This visit^^ which constitutes a breach in the practice of not allowing European representa tives to go there, or, indeed, to any other place beyond the vicinity of Jedda, is understood to have been made by M. Maigret in a private capacity. Both he and M. Choukri wore Arab dress. Italy. 264. The Italo-Hejaz-Nejd Treaty of Friendship and Commercial Treaty of the 10th February last (see paragraph 59), which were ratified at Rome on the 22nd April, were given the force of law in Italy as from the 3rd June, the law being published on the 4th August. For evidence of Hejazi interest in Sidky Pasha’s conversations in Rome see paragraph 267. Soviet Russia. 265. The Soviet Minister held aloof from Sir A. Ryan throughout July and August, possibly from some obscure political motive, as their relations have always been friendly. M. Turacoulov, who now invariably wears Arab (Nejdi) headgear, makes not infrequent visits to Mecca. He is understood to have been pursuing negotiations, presumably regarding a proposed Soviet loan and Hejazi trading facilities (see paragraph 207). T urkey. 268. The Turkish Charge d’Affaires, Lutfullah Bey, returned from leave on the 31st August as a corpse, and was buried the same afternoon in the Moslem cemetery and the presence of his colleagues; who, for the second time in two years, attended a Turkish representative's funeral. The cause of his death seems to have been an attack of tertiary malaria in the Red Sea on board a Soviet ship,, further aggravated by whisky, terminating in heart failure. Egypt. 267. On the 31st August Fuad Bey wrote privately and confidentially to Sir A. Ryan to draw his attention to a report in the Cairo “ Akram ” to the effect that recent events in the Hejaz had been discussed on the occasion of Sidky Pasha s visit to Rome. He asked him to seek His Majesty s Government s views on the matter. Sir Andrew rode him off by suggesting, in a final conversa tion before his departure on leave, that whereas Egypt had a natural interest in Hejazi affairs, she had not, as at present governed, any such interest as would lead her into an Arabian adventure. He added the view that, as regards Italy, she v as nowadays keenly interested in all foreign affairs, but was not interested in the Hejaz in any such way as need cause anxiety. Fuad Bey left it at that, but betrayed continued suspicion of the Egvptian representative at Jedda (see paragraph 208). ' v Iraq. 268. The visit of the Amir Feisal’s mission to Bagdad early in July produced an amelioration of the relations between Iraq and the Hejaz-Nejd. The question of the location of the Iraqi Legation was discussed and a tentative agreement reached whereby it is to be at Jedda, but the Iraqi representative will have access to Mecca and will be allowed to have an unofficial residence there Shortly afterwards the Iraqi Government decided to replace Dr. Naji al Asil by a new ( haige d Affaires, Colonel Rashid Bey, Iraqi consul-general at Beirut. Their Legation at Jedda is temporarily in charge of Abdel Kadir Bey al Gaylani, a vice-consul from Cairo, who arrived on the 28th August, and calls himself C haige d Affaires. Dr. Naji s first secretary, who also has Hashimite associations, has been transferred.9 269. It is now the fashion in hi^h Hejazi circles to acclaim King Feisal as a good neighbour, a sterling Arab and a reasonable man to deal with in contrast with ex-King Ali, who is mistrusted, and the Amir Abdullah, who is much more mistrusted and detested as well. Chapter IV.— Air Matters. Hejazi A ir Force. 270. As a result of the study given in London to the renewed suggestion that a Royal Air Force mission should be sent to Jedda (see paragraph 215), Sir A. Ryan was requested to explain the difficulties to the Hejazi Government. He did so in conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 11th August, handing him at the same time a memorandum, unofficial because the matter was being dealt with personally, in which the difficulties regarding personnel, language, conditions at Jedda, cost and technical considerations were exposed, and precise indications were sought as to whether the Hejazis wanted to build up a fighting unit capable of ultimate expansion or merely to create a small unit for -communication purposes, using a simple type of aircraft. This memorandum Fuad Bey took away to study at leisure. A erial Trespass. 271. See paragraph 250 (Transjordan frontier). General. 272. Chapter V.— Military Matters. See paragraphs 239 to 247 (internal situation). Chapter VI.— Naval Matters. British. 273. H.M.S. “Hastings” (Captain C. S. Sandford, R.N.) left northern Red Sea waters for Malta on the 23rd July. H.M.S. “Penzance” (Commander A. R. Farquhar, R.N.) remained in northern waters for some time after the actual defeat of Ibn Rifada, in case of further developments, which failed, however, to materialise ; then proceeded via Kosseir to Jedda, arriving on the 30th August. Foreign. 274. Nil. Chapter Nil.—Pilgrimage. Indian. 275. As a normal aftermath of pilgrimage 258 Indian destitutes were repatriated on the 28th July at a cost to the Government of India of £775. They were, however, fewer in number than last year, and formed a lower percentage of the total Indian pilgrimage. Pilgrimage Report. 276. His Majesty’s Minister’s comprehensive survey of the 1932 (A.H. 1350) pilgrimage was completed for despatch on the 1st September. 1933 (A.H. 1351) Pilgrimage. 277. As a result of last season's unpleasant experiences (see paragraphs 91 to 96) and of the representations made by the Legation and many leading pilgrims, the Hejazi Government have apparently taken their lessons to heart, at least in theory, and have promulgated an early and much improved pilgrimage tariff for next season, including transport charges. This was communicated to the Legation on the 9th August; it is being attentively studied and will be circulated in due course to the interested Governments of the Empire.I— ■Ham 10 r Chapter VIII.— Slavery. Manumissions. 278. Two female slaves were in hand at the beginning of July. Two others (male) took refuge in the Legation during July and August. The two women were manumitted during this period and were repatriated to Africa. There wa^ no Hejazi opposition. ' Chapter IX.— Miscellaneous. Staff. 279. Mr. Hope Gill returned from leave of absence on the 31st August. Captain Seager went on leave on the 3rd August.

The King left Riyadh at 9 a.m. on the 5th April by car for Mecca, preceded on the previous dav by the baggage convoy and a mobile wireless set. He was met on the 7th by the Emir Feisal at Usheyra and by large numbers of Meccawis at as-Seyl, where he performed the major ablution and clad himself in two seamless wrappings, the “ ihram ' of the pilgrim. He entered Mecca (550 miles) at sunset on the 7th April, one week before pilgrimage day. At 7 next morning he was ceremoniously received by the Viceroy in the centre of the town, in a setting of awnings and troops and popular acclamation, the while a salute of 101 guns was fired and speeches and poems eulogised His Majesty. There, by Royal command, the celebrations ended, in the interests of national economy. 112. Ibn Saud was immediately surrounded by the multifarious cares of maladministration and the grievances of pilgrims. An unusually large number of prominent Indians was present for the Friday Hajj, and them he heard with some attention. On the 12th April he made a banquet for 500 guests and delivered his customary pilgrimage oration. It was a mediaeval mixture of religion and politics, spoken from a full heart but a bewildered head; it caused much offence. 113. Starting with the aphorism (in such company) that one of the greatest blessings of God to man is the blessing of Islam, Ibn Saud ascribed the decline of Moslem temporal power to the decadence of Moslem religious faith and the resulting disunity between Moslem peoples. God had therefore empowered their enemies over them. But Moslems now were awakening from sleep and inadvertence. They should seize their weapons, which were of two kinds, the material, such as aeroplanes, the spiritual, piety. By these would they win glory in this world and pardon in the next. Here he inserted the remark that the Prophet of God had recommended the learning of foreign languages, as a means of power over the enemy. Ibn Saud then turned to his own position and that of the Hejaz. “ If the relations between me and God are good,” he said, “ I do not care if the relations between me and all men are bad. A man can only do his best— in the general interest,” he added. People had been talking too much about the Hejaz and its people and criticising them only because they believed in God Almighty. The Hejaz was once under the Turks and then under the Sherifs. His hearers were aware of the bloodshed then done, the sins committed, and the peace violated. But when God made Ibn Saud the ruler of the Hejaz, being a slave of God he followed no way but that of true religion, the Holy Book between his hands. Two things he would never allow, were all the world to fight against him, namely, the slightest deviation from the religion of God or any action affecting the independence or violating the honour of his country. People often asked, why did Ibn Saud not strive to defend the Moslems by propaganda against the English, the Russians, the Italians and the rest ? He would tell them. He was not a wordy man, but a man of deeds. He did not instruct the editor of his newspaper to speak against such a one, but he commanded silence until the time [489 ee—3] nmmam 4 2 of action came; when he acted, then he spoke. Hitherto he had kept still, not knowing the state of Moslem opinion, or rather the opinion of those who pretended to be Moslems. Here Ibn Sand began to betray his bewilderment. W hen Moslems speak against Christians, he said, they speak politely and with good manners, but when they speak against Moslems, they accuse them as though they were their enemies. “ There are some who have acted vindictively against us, looking with evil eye upon what God has granted us; thus the devil tempted them to many evil deeds. Not in one single case did I find one of the Moslems defending me. Moslems withheld the charities from the Holy Sanctuaries, and Moslems prevented people from performing pilgrimage. All this is against Ibn Saud. W r hat has Ibn Saud done ? Has Ibn Saud erected an idol to be worshipped in place of God ? Has he allowed intoxicating drink ? Has he permitted adultery and prostitution ? Has Ibn Saud left the mischievous to commit evil upon earth ? What has Ibn Saud done contrary to the Sharia law and Arab manliness ? By God, he said, I fear the foreigner once, but I fear those who pretend to be Moslem three thousand times. I hope Moslems will forgive me for saying so, but, by God, I am true in what I say.” W^hat had Moslems agreed upon and striven for, Ibn Saud asked, and he had hesitated to join them ? He had no use for words, but if Moslems went forth to action, it w T ould be disgraceful for their honour, theirs, the Arabs’, if they failed to do the same. But he did not go on to indicate any plan of action; instead, he turned aside to ventilate other grievances. He was censured for lack of rain in the Hejaz, he was said to be contracting a loan with the English, he was accused of wanting to do this and that. But he had taken nothing from the Hejaz; on the contrary he had given it peace and religious law r . Almighty God withheld the rain, but upon Moslems lay the disgrace of withholding charity and preventing pilgrimage (regarded, of course, as ever in the Hejaz, primarily as commercial assets). By God, he continued, I have no money and my only possessions are the sword and the Koran. I declare openly that if any of the Moslem kings, princes, or merchants wishes to do a benevolent deed for the Moslems of this country, he is warmly welcome, provided that he does not violate the honour of our country nor interfere with our independence or our religious affairs. I swear by God, the only One God, that I have not contracted a loan wuth the English or others—but perhaps we may need to take from the Moslems, or others. 114. Here is a very fair indication of Ibn Saud’s state of mind. He is at his wits’ end to obtain money sufficient for his expensive needs. Moreover, he is feeling insecure and his words reflect his growdng sense of the hostility which surrounds him in the Hejaz and which is spreading in the Moslem world outside. His reactions are alternately those of a man of action who would like to hit somebody, and a pious beggar for unconditional alms. But his enemies, though real to him, are impalpable, while benevolent Moslems are looking askance at his fanatical destruction of their shrines and his spendthrift maladministration of the Holy Hejaz. 115. After pilgrimage, Ibn Saud visited Jedda on the 30th April, but stayed only a day and left on the 2nd May. He startled the leading inhabitants, who assembled to pay homage to him at the Green Palace, by greeting them with the w r ords : “I could cut the throat of every one of you.” The foreign repre sentatives were received in audience, one by one, on the 1st May. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires found Ibn Saud polite, but distant, and wuth very little ito say. He looked a different man from what he had been eighteen months before, his face yellowed under the skin, pouchy, puckered, and far more livid; his ill-health was evident. Viceroy of the Hejaz. 116. The Emir Feisal left on the 12th April on a mission to Europe (paragraphs 53 and 127) and was replaced by Ibn Sand's third son, Muhammad, aged 22, as President of the Council and Viceroy-to-be. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 117 Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, at the same time, became Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. Fuad Bey Hamza accompanied the Minister for Foreign Affairs on mission. Current affairs in April were dealt with by letter and telephone to Mecca. There were no interviews.* ^ 3 Finance. 118. The Hejazi Government made a further attempt in April to silence the persistent loan rumour (paragraph 11) which the Arabic and Indian vernacular press kept on repeating. They announced in the “ Umm-al-Qura ^ of the 15th April that the crisis in the Hejaz was only a part of the general world depression ; they denied definitely that they had consulted the British or , any other Government about a loan, the rumoured conditions of which (appoint ment of an Englishman to reorganise and control all finances, settlement of the Hejaz Railway question and use of Hejaz-Nejd territory by British aircraft) were such as the Government could never accept; they foretold a conference of local financial experts, and offered to assist anyone who might wish to be charitable to the Hejaz; they promised facilities to any Moslem, were he King, or prince, or merchant, who wanted to give them a loan, provided that their rights, religion and independence were not touched. 119. The financial position was unchanged. The Dutch adviser, M. van Leeuwen, arrived at Jedda on the 23rd April on contract for a year (paragraph 62). Economic. 120. The pilgrimage, though very small, brought a little business and relief to the town populations of the Hejaz. The Bedouin, however, continued in miserable plight. As a result of the drought, the Northern Hejaz was said to be entirely empty of tribes, who had moved in search of grazing either northward into Transjordan or southward beyond Taima. Pilgrims to Medina were frequently mobbed by starving nomads. Chapter II .—Frontier Questions. Transjordan. Raiding. 121. There were no complaints during April of raiding from either side of the frontier. Frontier Meetings. 122. None are reported to have been held in April. The Beni Atiya. 123. Under instructions from His Majesty's Government, His Majesty s Charge d’Affaires on the 22nd April replied to the Hejazi Government’s note ot the 0th March (paragraph 38) to the effect that the Transjordan Government regretted that they could not see their way to complying with the request tor the return of the Beni Atiya to the Hejaz. It was pointed out that it had been in a spirit of co-operation, however, and in order to minimise the risk of trouble arising on the frontier, that the Transjordan authorities had taken measures to control these tribesmen as soon as they crossed the frontier and had sent t em o the north of Maan. Iraq. 124. Nil. Koweit and Bahrein. 125. Nil. A sir and 126. Ibn Sand sent a telegram of oonfidonoe to the Iman Yahya on the death of his second son, Saif-al-Islam Muhammad, on the 22nd Apri . Chapter III.—Foreign Relation*. British Empire. Hejaz-Nejd Mission to London. 127. Under circumstances which have already been recorded in para- o-rauh 53 the Emir Feisal, accompanied by Fuad Bey Hamza, sailed from Jedda on the 12th April to visit London and other capitals. A touching scene was [489 ee—3] B 2witnessed at the gangway, when the Emir’s favourite was found on board and bundled off. It had been officially concluded that it would be incorrect ii he were to accompany the mission, but the Emir had surreptitiously given him passage money at the last moment. Though full-grown, he howled like a child. Another attachee. a well-known prostitute of Mecca, had left by a previous sailing for Port Said, where she intended to join the Emir. It has not yet been ascertained whether she fared better than her rival. Italy. 128. The mission sailed in an Italian liner, specially diverted to Jcdda for the purpose, and was accompanied by the Italian consul and Mme. Sollazzo, whose duty at Jedda had terminated with the signing of the Italo-Hejazi treaty (paragraph 59). The mission arrived at Naples on the 18th April as guests ot the Italian Government. They were received there on the 19th by the C rown Prince of Italy and proceeded the same day to Rome. The Emir was received by King Victor Emmanuel on the 20th and stayed to luncheon. On the 21st he attended the celebration of the anniversary of the foundation of Rome, and was frequently photographed in company with Signor Mussolini. The mission lei Rome on'the 25th April, visited the Fiat motor and aviation works at Turin on the 26th and the trade fair at Milan on the 27th, and passed on to Switzerland. The Italian authorities appear to have made every effort to impress the mission with Italian efficiency in the industrial field. For their views on the slave trade, see paragraph 147. The Netherlands. 129. The Dutch Charg4 d’Affaires, M. Adriaanse, returned to Jedda on the 5th April from the Yemen, where he spent ten days as the guest of the Imam Yahya at Sana. He received yet another courtesy letter from Queen Wilhelmina. • j t .t, 130. The Dutch financial adviser, M. van Leeuwen, arrived at Jedda on the 23rd April (paragraph 62). Iraq. 131. King Eeisal’s personal message to Ibn Saud regarding the seat the new Iraqi Legation (paragraph 67) arrived by special courier in April. After several and friendly interviews with the Iraqi Charge d Affaires, Ibn Saud sent a replv in which, it seems, he regretted that he could not infringe the rule which preserves the Holy Places of Islam intact from diplomacy and invited King Feisal to furnish his representative with fresh credentials naming him to Jedda. Chapter IV.— Air Matters. Hejaz Air Force. 132. Nil. Emergency Landing Grounds. 133. There was no opportunity in April of pursuing the matter. Aerial Trespass. 134. None was reported.

News was received via Aden to the effect that, as a result of renewed trouble between the Saudi control at Jizan and certain Asiri tribes, the Emir-bin- Shuair had been recalled from Jizan and replaced by the Emir-bin-Zuair from Kunfida. Chapter VI .—Naval Matters. Naval Visits. 138. The customary naval visit during the pilgrimage was paid by Captain C. S. Sandford, O.B.E., R.N., Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, who visited Jedda for the first time on the 12th April in H.M.S. “Hastings. The visit lasted until the 18th April, pilgrimage day falling on the 15th. It was an unqualified success, which was largely due to the navy’s own genial hospitality and their effective co-operation with the shore and the pilgrimage fleet in the running of the traditional Haj j regatta. The usual official visits were paid by Captain Sandford, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and the Governor of Jedda receiving salutes when they returned his visits. 139. There were no foreign naval visits. Chapter VII.— Pilgrimage. Pilgrimage Day. 140. The 9th Dhul Hijja did coincide with a Friday (the 15th April). The 50,000 or so Hajj is who assembled upon that day in the plain of Arafat were thus seven times blessed (for why, see paragraph 92). The shade temperature was then not more than 102° F., deaths were few and the general health all that could be desired. In announcing this happy circumstance, the Hejazi Govern ment were moved to declare that the congregation that day numbered not less than 150,000. This may be ascribed as much to ignorance as to ecstasy. The desert so seldom teems that the Arab has but little knowledge of large numbers. A rrivals. 141. The official Hejazi statistics of oversea pilgrims, which are not necessarily accurate, show some 29,000 this year as against 39,500 last year, made up as follows :— 1 f)zi /? 7 ? ?*, ft 2V Nationality. Last year. This year. Indians ... 7,200 9,500 Javanese 17,000 4,500 Egyptians 5,000 2,300 Syrians ... 1,000 2,100 North Africans ... 250 1,800 Afghans 1,000 1.700 Palestinians 500 1,300 Bukharis 200 1,200 The rest 7,350 4,600 Totals ... 39,500 29,000 142. The financial and economic depression has thus decisively outweighed the attraction of the Friday Hajj. Total approximate figures of oversea pilgrims 132,000 to Mecca in recent years have been :— 1927 &gt;r ?c~o )2 7tro ) lVok&gt;x- 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 88,000 82.500 85.000 39.500 29.000 A There was a larger attendance this year than has before been known of notable pilgrims from oversea, however. The names of some of these are given in paragraph 149.143. No Hejazi statistics of local or overland pilgrims are kept. In they are not called pilgrims at all, but the Arabic equivalent of tramp or hobo* since they bring no money into the country. Such are the \emenis ot whom 5,000 are said to have come to Mecca this year. The estimated total of these and more local pilgrims is 20,000. Departure. 144. There was an exceptional glut of pilgrims at Jedda during the last part of April. The slender funds of the majority were exhausted by high prices and extortion. The great idea was to get away by the first boat available. Large numbers moreover, were unable to afford the visit to Medina, which is generally paid after the pilgrimage to Mecca. Consular and shipping staffs have consequently been working since the 20th April at considerably highei pressuie than usual, in spite of the smaller pilgrimage. Hajj Regatta. 145. Another successful meeting was added on the 17th April to the long list of Hajj regattas with which, since before living memory, the waiting pilgrim ships and the European community of Jedda have filled in the time while the Moslems are in Mecca. The oldest captain could remember a time when torty- two ships lay at anchor. This year there were only eight, seven British and one French. The usual regatta meeting was held at the British Legation, the usual luncheon on board the regatta flagship, steamship Boulac, and a programme of nine pulling and sailing events was carried through harmoniously, with the \aluable assistance of H.M.S. “Hastings.” Ships were dressed overall on the 16th to the 19th April for the four days’ pilgrimage festival, the Id-al-Azha. Salutes, however, are only fired by the shore battery, which fired them incessantly. Chapter VIII.— -Slavery. Manumissions. 146. One male and two female slaves who took refuge in the Legation in April were manumitted on the 20th and repatriated to the Sudan, then country of origin. Slave Trade. 147. The signature of the Italo-Hejazi Treaty (paragraph 59) was. accompanied by an exchange of letters, in the first of which the Italian plenipotentiary opined that his Government considered it necessary that Ibn Saud’s Government should assume the obligation of co-operating with fkem m suppressing the slave trade. Similarly, his Government desired that their representatives at Jedda should have powers of manumission and icpatriation. They trusted that Ibn Saud would appreciate their attitude. The slave-owners representative replied, however, that, while appreciating the Italian Govern ment's humane sentiments, he had to explain that the suppression of the illicit trade in slaves constituted one of the most important questions to which Ibn Saud’s Government had directed their attention, that His Majesty was personally interested in preventing the import of slaves into his country, and that his Government would persevere to this end. As to manumission, the Government were themselves of their own initiative endeavouring to reach the end enjoined by Islamic law, with its principles of supreme justice and its pure sentiment of humanity. They could not grant powers of manumission to the Italian representative because such action was their own sole and exclusive right. This Italian face-saving and Hejazi clap-trap will no doubt be published with the treaty as evidence of good faith on both sides. A further exchange of notes agreed that the most-favoured-nation treatment accorded to Italy by the Hejaz- Nejd did not include the “favourable treatment which, for reasons which are generally known, has been granted to a third Power in the matter of slavery”— the British right of manumission secured by the Treaty of Jedda. 148. Nevertheless, Aden has received a report that, on the 10th April, a slave boy of 14 was brought to Jizan—he is thought to have been landed on the Subeyhf coast east of Perim and to have been brought overland into Asir—and was kept in the house of a local sheikh for sale. Thereupon, it was said, certain7 merchants interested in the slave trade enquired of the Emir of Jizan whether the old or the new is not stated—whether he would encourage and facilitate a revival of the import business. He is said to have promised to do so. Other reports received at Aden state that two slaves were landed at Mocha in March 1931 and one in October 1931, and that at the beginning of March 1932 four ^ slaves—a man, a woman and two boys—were landed at Dubab and taken overland to Zabid, where they were bought by one Muhammad Ibrahim Meccawi for 2,000 Maria Theresa dollars. The man and one boy were said to have been sent later to Sharif Ibrahim ar-Rifa'i at Midi for sale. Chapter IX.— Miscellaneous. Visitors. 149.

Chapter I .—Internal Affairs. Ibn Saud and General. 153. THE King was already in Jedda on the 1st May, and received the foreign representatives in a series of formal audiences that day. The unfavour able impression formed by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires of his physical state is recorded in the previous report (paragraph 115). It is in striking contrast 6499 [542 c—3] u■HBWI with that formed in January by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who found His Majesty hale, hearty and young for his age. He dislikes all Hejazi climates as being too hot, too damp or too dry. He had just been through the strenuous labours of the pilgrimage, and he has had the problems of the Hejaz increasingly in his mind and on his nerves. These factors may well account for his appearance on the 1st May. There is no reason to suppose that his health is permanently impaired. It may be mentioned in this connexion that an American doctor from the mission hospital at Bahrein left for Taif on the 20th May in response to an urgent summons, but it is supposed that he was principally required to attend a wife about whose health the King has been much concerned. The doctor was still at Taif late in June, and appeared to be greatly in demand among the notables there. 154. Ibn Saud left Jedda on the 2nd May, sooner than had been anticipated. He moved to Taif on the 22nd May, and was still there at the end of June. He had been expected to go to Nejd in the course of that month, but was doubtless influenced to delay his departure by the situation in the Northern Hejaz (see below). It is, indeed, somewhat remarkable that he did not proceed to some spot nearer the scene of action, e.g., Medina. It has been suggested in some quarters that the unruly tribes round Taif have been so restless that the King’s presence in that area is necessary to control the situation. 155. The King created a sensation by a speech which he delivered to a gathering of notables at Mecca on the eve of his departure. It was in his usual fervent vein, and resembled in many respects the address recorded in the last report (paragraph 113), but its special quality was that of a cautionary sermon to the Hejazis. This note is struck in the version published in the “ Umm-al- Qura.” According to private reports, His Majesty was much more outspoken than appeared from that version. He is said to have talked of chopping off heads as a remedy which he had thought of applying at once to the corruption which he rebuked. He had decided to content himself with a warning addressed more particularly to those in high places, including his own officials, and to people of the middle class; he could excuse persons of the meaner sort for their share in the exploitation of pilgrims, which would appear to have been one of the objects of the onslaught. Another was the goings-on of the young men, whose leanings towards modern political ideas and European materialism the King deprecates. 156. Such utterances are part of the King’s reaction to the growing unpopularity of his rdgime in the towns. The malaise was intensified in June by distorted accounts of what was passing in the north, and companion rumours of unrest in the Taif region, perhaps also in Asir. One arrest in Mecca probably had a direct connexion with the theory of a widespread Hashimite conspiracy, that of Faudhi Bey Kawokji, who was removed last year, after a short tenure’ from the post of Director-General of Military Organisation. The Government have shown other signs of nervous suspicion. Tribal notables are said to have been arrested at Taif or Mecca. Laughter was aroused by the action of the director of police in the latter city in filling the town with armed men at mid night, with no greater object, it subsequently appeared, than to locate illicit alcohol, a small quantity of which was discovered. More anxiety was caused when on the night of the 28th June some forty people were arrested in Jedda. The majority were released at once and some others later, but a fair number, variously estimated, were held in custody. The bag was so mixed that it was difficult to detect the common factor. Some suppose that these proceedings are merely intended to instil a general fear. The public execution in Jedda of a murdei er, a tribesman, on the 1st July, may have fortified this impression, although he seems to have deserved his fate, and was interesting only because he had made a spirited get-away from gaol across the reefs and shallows outside the town. It is said that it took three minutes to hack off his head, and that his wife and childien w r ere compelled to attend as a counter-agent to possible heredity but these details cannot be vouched for. 157. As for the young men, interest has centred round the question whether football, latterly much in vogue at Jedda and Mecca, is now prohibited or not The game can hardly be held to be forbidden by the sacred law. The Prophet is said to have played ball with his ladies, and the Amir Feisal played the modern game early this year in Jedda. It is not the football itself which has fallen under suspicion, but the fact that it brings young men together in clubs. One of those interested explained gravely about the end of June that the Kingdeferring to the views of a liberal entourage, had not prohibited the game, but that it was uncertain whether those who persisted in playing it might not be arrested. The sportsmen’s dilemma is the more difficult for having not quite visible horns. 158. Some little importance may attach to suggestions that all is not well between the Amir Feisal and the King. It has been suggested that the Amir will be detained in Riyadh on his return from his tour. He himself spoke to Sir A. Ryan in London in May of the possibility of his being delayed there. One story is that the Amir has made the removal of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman from office a condition of his continuing to serve as Viceroy; another, that he has come under the influence of a strong-minded new wife of half-Turkish parentage, who has determined to make a man of him. The interest of such reports, unauthen ticated as they are, lies in the fact that the Amir, with his local experience, his European experiences, and his penchant for modern-minded Syrians, might well aspire to a dominant role in a distressful Hejaz. 159. The very youthful Amir Muhammad, who was appointed to act for the Amir Feisal as President of the Council, &amp;c., left for Riyadh after a short incumbency, and was replaced by his still more youthful brother the Amir Khalid. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 160. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin continued to act as Minister throughout May and June in the absence of the Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey Hamza. He visited Jedda from the 30th April to the 7th May, the 25th May to the 27th May, the 2nd June to the 6th June, the 10th to the 14th and the 21st to the 27th. The Ministry now maintains a permanent branch in Jedda to the extent of having on duty Sheikh Ali Taha, who was formerly assistant to the Governor of Jedda. He was ineffective in that capacity, and is a complete nonentity in the Foreign Affairs Department. He is, however, a useful postman, especially as he takes, delivery of notes on which the Legation formerly had to pay postage to Mecca and he has been the medium for the transmission of cypher messages both ways by telephone in connexion with the Ibn Rifada affair (see belowh Hejazi Constitution. 161. Mr. Hope Gill completed in May a compilation from all available sources of all known regulations affecting the Constitution of the Hejaz since 1926. Despite the incoherent manner in which constitutional changes have been effected, this collection is of great importance and it is therefore worth recording that it was sent to the Foreign Office in Legation despatch No. 213 of the 18th May, 1932. Finance. 162. There was no material change in the current financial situation. The Dutch financial adviser worked busily on reports. He appears to enjoy life, being happily not dependent on his salary and having no intention of outstaying the year of his contract. He is very discreet as to what he is doing, but makes no secret of the difficulty of dealing with a Minister who resides in Mecca, and pays only short and infrequent visits to Jedda. 165. On the 17th June the Hejazi Government published a decree insti tuting revised arrangements for settling old debts. It began by saying that those which were the subject of agreements would be paid according to these agreements. Arrears due to soldiers, policemen and chauffeurs would be paid by issuing supplies in kind monthly in addition to current wages; rents in accordance with the special regulations on the delayed payment of rents (see paragraph 173). Twenty-five per cent, of the customs revenue would be assigned to the payment of all other debts, for which drafts on customs would be issued in cases where this had not already been done. Government employees and other persons not in the import trade would arrange with a named importing merchant in whose name the drafts would be issued. The wording of these clauses is obscure, but the effect appears to be that all debts not dealt with otherwise must be converted into drafts on customs to be accepted in payment of one-fourth of the duty on newly-imported goods. The discount market for such drafts is extremely poor, as might be expected. Otherwise, it is too soon to appreciate the practical effect of the new regulation. [542 c—3] B 24 164. The position in regard to all important claims in which the Legation is interested remained vague and unsatisfactory. Mr. Hope Gill pressed some of them in May, notably the Egyptian Shell claim in respect of stolen benzine and the claim of His Majesty’s Government for the Hejazi contribution to the cost of the MacDonnell enquiry. Sir A. Ryan reviewed most of the claims in general conversation with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs towards the end of ^ June, but did not press the individual cases owing to the predominance of the of the Transjordan frontier question over all other matters. Earlier in June the long-suffering chauffeurs employed in the Government companies had been offered one-third of their claims in full settlement, and Sir A. Ryan had informed Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 12th June that he could not encourage British chauffeurs to accept so miserable an offer, but would not stand in the way of its being voluntarily accepted, subject to the provisos that he would regard the claims of any who refused the offer as being valid for the full amount and that he would expect any who accepted to be left free to leave the country when they had discharged their private debts. This intimation did not prevent the authorities concerned from hoodwinking some simple chauffeurs into accepting the offer by telling them that it had been arranged with the Legation. 165. The Hejazi Mission appealed to His Majesty’s Government to make a loan of £500,000 gold or to help them to raise one. They were told that His Majesty's Government regretted their inability to comply with the request, and it was further explained to them at a meeting at the Bank of England on the 13th May that the conditions were wholly unfavourable for raising a loan in the City of London. The mission presumably made similar efforts in other western capitals—at any rate they tried Berlin. On the 19th June, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin delivered to Sir A. Ryan a personal message from Ibn Saud renewing his appeal for financial assistance on a much smaller scale than the mission had suggested. The Soviet, he explained, were willing to lend him anything up to a million—in goods not in money. He did not wish to accept this help or to comply with the Soviet conditions that he should conclude a treaty with them. He might be driven to this course, though even if he were he would confine the treaty within narrow limits. His Majesty’s Government could only confirm their previous refusal, but did it in the friendliest possible terms. Representatives of the lower types of high finance visited Jedda. The “ Amir ” Lutfullah came from Egypt towards the end of May to pursue his project of an Arabian National Bank and was entertained at Taif. He left Jedda on the 4th June not having accomplished anything definite. A representative of the ex-Khedive of Egypt brought about the same time offers of financial assistance in return for a banking concession and/or economic concessions. It was said that definite proposals were to be communicated to the Hejazi Government on the 5th July. There may also have been a financial side to the activities of Mr. YMlibi, to be described in the following sub-section. 166. There was an echo from India in May of the stale rumour that His Majesty’s Government were about to lend the Hejazi Government £500,000 on various conditions including the provision of landing grounds on the Hasa Coast. It had been reproduced in Bombay with comments relative to alleged British designs on the Holy Places. His Majesty’s Government concurred in a proposal that a formal denial should be issued by the Government of India, but without reference to the reported conditions, as the question of landing grounds was in fact under discussion with the Hejazi Government, though on quite different lines. Economic Development. 167. Mr. Twitched was again in Jedda during the greater part of May and left towards the end of the month. It is understood that during this visit he was in the pay of the Hejazi Government and not, as previously, of Mr. Crane. It is, however, uncertain whether he will return to the Hejaz in view of the unfavour able turn in the King’s disposition towards him. His colleague, Mr. Moseley, who was prospecting for gold near Taif until he left in March, has not reappeared, but hopes of exploiting gold somewhere or other are still entertained and seem to have infected even the Dutch financial adviser. This gentleman is also impressed by the possibilities of the water from the Waziriya wells outside Jedda, but it is not confirmed that he supported a mad proposal wTiich was spoken of in May to close down the Jedda condensers in anticipation of more successful efforts to bring the Waziriya water to the town—the idea apparently being that the failure of these^ y 5 efforts hitherto has been due to sabotage by other interests and that there would be less danger of this, if the condenser water was not available. 168. Mr. Hope Gill was able to send home on the 18th May further infor mation regarding Mr. Twitched’s explorations on the Hasa Coast together with a copy of a “ somewhat testy ’ letter which he addressed to the King on the A 27th February, regarding his efforts generally and various causes militating against their success in spite of the possibilities of the country. 169. Men of larger and vaguer ideas than those of Mr. Twitched floated about in May and June. Reference has been made in paragraph 165 to the approaches made to the Hejazi Government by the Amir Lutfudah and an agent of the ex-Khedive. Another gentleman, who puts economic development in the forefront of his dreams and schemes, is Mr. A. Ydlibi, the enterprising head of a small business in Manchester. Having spied out the land in Jedda in January and February in association with another Syrian, named Awaini, an intimate of Fuad Bey Hamza, he appears to have gone home and to have sought to enlist interest in oil and possible railway concessions in the Hejaz. From a statement made by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 24th June, it seems that Mr. Ydlibi claims to have got the support of the Calico Printers’ Association, (Limited), who had, however, according to the same statement, been given discouraging advice by His Majesty’s Government.’ The true facts of what had passed in England were not known in Jedda up to the end of June. 170. It was announced on the 9th May that the Hejazi Government had arranged to import an adequate supply of agricultural machinery to be distributed to farmers in the Hejaz and Nejd and to be paid for by them in annual instalments. Wireless. 171. There was no news of any further stations being completed in May and June, but the Marconi expert, M. Boucicault, is understood to have gone to Hasa to work in that area. It is not certain that he completed the station at Qaf before leaving as was supposed (see January—March report, paragraph 16). Postal Communication. 172. Following on Sir H. V. Biscoe’s conversations with Ibn Saud in January, th§ Government of India agreed in principle in May to the establish ment of a postal service between Hasa and the outer world via Bahrein, and communicated to the Legation, for transmission to the Hejazi Government, their proposals as to how it should he organised. Legislation on Rents. 173. A regulation published on the 6th May affirmed the right of landlords to dispose freely of their property by contract. It, however, prescribed that, in cases of non-agreement with their tenants, they could not evict the latter before the 6th June, 1932, and it established a moratorium for arrears of rent, which were made payable in two instalments in December 1932 and December 1933 at the rate of 10 rivals to the pound (i.e., the pound gold). Census. 174. A regulation published on the 24th June, after a certain amount of preliminary publicity, including an assurance that the measure had nothing to do with conscription or taxation, ordered a general census of the male population of the Hejazi towns. It was clear that one of the main objects was to determine the numbers of natives and foreigners, and the regulation, though unexception able in principle, created much misgiving among people of doubtful or dual nationality, many of whom seemed likely to be swayed more by considerations of interest than by ideas as to their legal status in filling up the declaration of nationality in the forms distributed. They were the more unhappy because of the difficulty of deciding between the risks, great each way, of admitting themselves to be Hejazis or claiming to be aliens. The Ruh-aTKhali. 175. The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 13th and 20th May had two long articles on the Rub-al-Khali, with special reference to Mr. Philby’s journey. This is-represented as having been a sort of pendant to the despatch by the Amir of Hasa of a force sent to pursue certain criminals not accounted for by an earlier expedition of the same kind a year before and to collect information. The first article reproduces an interesting letter from Mr. Philby to the King asking permission to take the opportunity afforded by the despatch of the force subject to the following undertakings :— (1) No responsibility to attach to the King and his Government, and no claim to lie against them in the event of Mr. Philby’s death or illness. (2) All information obtained to be communicated to the Hejazi Government, to be their property and not to be published without their permission. (3) The British Government to have no right to claim anything in consequence of discoveries made by Mr. Philby, and all territory discovered, as well as information obtained, to be Ibn Saud’s property. (4) Mr. Philby and the King’s servants to place his “ flags of victory ’ in all high places passed by. (5) All remains discovered and all plans and maps made to be the property of the Hejazi Government and not to be disposed of without the King’s authority, and a list of all funds to be submitted to the King, for such orders as he might choose to issue, on Mr. Philby’s return. The articles then describe how the punitive expedition going first rounded up the remaining criminals, “who had their hands and legs cut off,” and how the mission, i.e., Mr. Philby’s party, continued on its journey via Jabrin and Maqainama to the alleged site of the legendary city of Ubar. 176. In this connexion it may be mentioned that Mr. Philby went to England in May to reap a rich harvest of laurels. Before doing so he closed down for six months the Jedda branch of Sharqieh (Limited), his management of which has been less brilliant than his undoubtedly fine feat of explorations. Chapter II .—Frontier Questions. Transjordan. Frontier Situation. 177. No raids in the ordinary seilse were complained of by either side during May and June, excepting tw^o which the Hejazi Government mentioned in a note of the 14th May (see below) as having occurred in April. These they cited, admittedly without having full particulars, as examples of the way in which the Beni Atiya, whom they suspected of the raids, were encouraged by their acceptance in Transjordan to engage in nefarious enterprise. Peace reigned on the frontier during the first twenty days of May. There were no meetings between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid. Even the diplomatic atmosphere was clear until the Legation received on the 15th May the Hejazi note of the previous day. 178. This note was a long and contentious reply to Mr. Hope Gill’s short one of the 22nd April about the Beni Atiya (see last report, paragraph 123), but its subsequent importance lay in a passage dealing with an extraneous subject, the alleged activities of one Hamid-bin-Rifada-al-Awar, who was stated to be working in Egypt under the instructions of the Amir Abdullah, to be giving money to fugitive Hejazi tribesmen, and to be sending them to Aqaba in order that they should return to their homes, there to await future operations. The Hejazi Government had learnt that the Amir would help these people with money and troops when necessary, and that there were parties at Aqaba suborned to prepare for operations directed against the peace of the Hejaz. The note asked that a decision should be taken regarding the Beni Atiya, as to whether they belonged to the Hejaz and should be expelled from Transjordan, or vice versa: that a settlement should be reached with Transjordan on the lines of the agree ment concluded between Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq; and that an explanation should be furnished regarding the arrangements made by the Amirate of Transjordan to provoke disturbance in the Aqaba-Maan area. 179. The Hejazi note presented no urgent appearance. Mr. Hope Gill answered it at length on the 22nd May, asking the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to elucidate many points, including the serious but vague allegations in\1 if / the paragraph about Ibn Rifada. He sent copies of the correspondence to London and Jerusalem by bag. Four days later General Wauchope reported that a party of from 200 to 400 Billi and other tribesmen had passed through Aqaba on their way from Sinai to the Hejaz. A further report, dated a day or two later said that the party, now estimated at from 400 to 450 men, had passed north of Aqaba on the night of the 20th-21st May, had proceeded to a place some 7 kilom. from the frontier and had moved further south next day. It appeared from an order or proclamation issued by the Amir Abdullah immediately on the receipt of the first news that the leader was Ibn Rifada. The Amir intimated that these people, who were said to expect his help,should be made to return to their families and that steps should be taken to prevent the passage through Transjordan of suspicious characters. 180. The first reports suggested a dash in force straight from Sinai to the Hejaz across the narrow strips of Palestine and Transjordan territory which converge to the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. It is not so certain from later accounts that the operation was so simple, but it is still too soon to decide at what point the invaders actually concentrated; to what extent the numbers of any who may have come from Sinai were swollen by accretions from Palestine or Transjordan; how far the Amir was cognisant of or sympathetic towards the enterprise; or what supplies the raiders derived from Transjordan sources in the early stages. These questions have been, and are likely to be, disputed. The one clear fact is that since the morning of the 21st May a rebel force which has grown considerably, although not to really formidable dimensions, has been in being in the neighbourhood of the coast some distance inside Hejazi territory. 181. Ibn Saud appears to have had no news of the incursion until Mr. Hope Gill, having got instructions, informed him of it on the morning of the 30th May. It would be impossible to do justice in this report to the flood of correspondence which ensued from the 30th May to the 30th June. The main facts which emerge from it may be summed up as follows :— (a) The Hejazi Government took immediate military measures of two kinds. They ordered out the Akhwan from the village settlements in the nearer parts of Nejd to the estimated number of perhaps 5,000 or 6,000, sent important reinforce ments by car to strengthen their garrisons in the north, and they despatched other soldiers and supplies in the barge, fitted with auxiliary motor and one small gun, which they recently purchased in Bahrein. This dhow seems to have gone on a reef near Umlej with the result that the soldiers, &amp;c., had to be transported in smaller dhows to Wejh. It was apparently thought impossible to bring the ordinary troops into action owing to the inaccessibility to motor transpoit of Ibn Rifada’s force, the demolition of which was left for the Akhwan. These were to concentrate at Al-Ula and to get to grips with the rebels by a movement so planned as to cut off their retreat into Transjordan. They were expected to reach Al-Ula about the beginning of July, but up to the 30th June there was no certain news of them. (b) On the diplomatic side the Hejazi Government made strong representa tions to His Majesty’s Government, taking “ Told you so ' as their text. They suspected, not apparently without some reason, the existence of a widespread Hashimite plot with ramifications extending from Egypt to Iraq; were violently suspicious of the Amir Abdullah, and were much perturbed when King Ah, whom they also suspected (though they made no accusation against King Feisal or the Iraqi Government) left Bagdad for Amman by air on the 23rd June. I)uiing the first half of June they addressed numerous demands to His Majesty's Government. Some of them had been anticipated by the lattei and by the High Commissioner for Transjordan; some, like the Hejazi requests for a complete closing of the frontier and a promise to surrender any rebels crossing it, could not be complied with; some, like their insistence on an investigation of responsi bilities, to be conducted jointly by the two Governments, were at the very least premature; and the request, restated in practically every note, that His Majesty s Government should bring about a new settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan similar to that arrived at last year with Iraq related to a question which His Majesty’s Government had already undertaken in discussion with the Hejazi mission in London to consider seriously, but which they regarded as independent of the immediate problem created by Ibn Rifada. From the very outset the authorities in Transjordan took vigorous measures to prevent the rebels■■■ ———— 8 from getting assistance from that country both by prohibition and by reinforcing the frontier police. Steps were taken to prevent the Beni Atiya from joining the rebellion, and guarantees were taken from the sheikhs of other tribes m Southern Transjordan. The considered attitude of His Majesty s Government towards the Hejazi representations was defined in a note sent by the Legation to the Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 11th June. His Majesty s Govern- ^ ment regretted that Ibn Rifada and his party had succeeded in slipping from Sinai into the Hejaz in a very few hours before the authorities in 1 alestme and Transjordan were aware of the movement. They explained that it was physically impossible to close the frontier, and that it was for the Hejazi Government, whose forces must not, however, enter Transjordan, to bar the exit of rebels. 1 hc&gt; nevertheless would take all steps to assist the Hejazi authorities, and they promised that fugitive rebels entering Transjordan would, as far as possible, be disarmed and removed to safe places. The note described in general terms the measures already taken in Transjordan. His Majesty’s Government refused to guarantee the surrender of fugitive rebels, but promised that everything possible would be done to prevent such persons from causing fresh trouble. The question of a treaty settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan was dealt with on the lines indicated above. The first reaction of the Hejazi Government to this note was highly critical. In a reply of the 15th June they complained that the action of the British authorities was inadequate and stressed the question of responsibilities. Some days later they changed their tactics. In a series of conversations from the 21st to 23rd June the Acting Minister for Foreign Aftairs did not revert to his note. He tacitly accepted the position that Ilis Majesty s Government were doing all they could, and confined himself to discussing practical questions of co-operation between the British and Hejazi Governments, always on the underlying assumption that the Amir Abdullah was the common enemy. It was unnecessary to continue the discussion of the wider aspects of the affair up to the end of June. (c) In those circumstances it became increasingly, as the month wore on, a matter of co-ordinating the measures of the authorities in Transjordan and of the Hejazi Government. A certain amount of information, not very plentiful on either side, was exchanged. Arrangements were made in principle for wireless communication between Hejazi and Transjordan posts, but it had not been effectively established up to the 30th June. H.M.S. Penzance was sent to Aqaba, and arrived there on the 14th June. H.M.S. Hastings also left Port Sudan for the north of the Red Sea on the 2/th June. The despatch of ‘ ‘ Penzance ’ ’ was decided on for general reasons, but anticipated a request by the Hejazi Government on the 18th June that measures should be taken to guard against assistance reaching the rebels by sea, meaning, it was explained later, any maritime movement of craft, loaded or unloaded, which might bring supplies or facilitate any movement, whether of attack or flight. (d) Early in June the Hejazi Government manifested extreme displeasure against Egypt, and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke of a rupture with that country. This mood passed, partly perhaps because of the dissuasive language of Sir A. Ryan. As a matter of fact, the Egyptian Government, while denying, both privately and publicly, that Ibn Rifada’s expedition could have been fitted out in Egypt, has shown every readiness, at the instance of His Majesty’s Government, to apply and co-operate in measures to prevent assistance from reaching the rebels from Egypt either by land or sea. 182. The foregoing summary ignores may details, but gives an adequate account of the Ibn Rifada affair and its sequel. It is noteworthy that the Hejazi Government, while preparing a formidable demonstration of force, have shown no great celerity in mobilising it. They have probably banked on the fact that Ibn Rifada has presented no appearance of having provoked any widespread rebellion and has remained confined to the littoral area. It is possible that Ibn Saud’s object in making preparations so formidable in relation to the apparently small proportions of the menace is partly to overawe his own tribes generally and to impress on the Amir Abdullah and others the futility of attempts to upset his regime in the Hejaz. . . 183. It has been most difficult meanwhile to gauge the position of Ibn Rifada himself. His base appears to be Haikl, a place close to the sea, some 30 miles south of Aqaba. His total force had grown by the latter part of June to[542 c—3] c anything from perhaps 800 to 1,800 men, not in all probability very fully armed or mounted, and a portion of it may have been strung along the region to the south of Haikl. There is no evidence of his having reached any important place like Muweyla or Dhaba, the occupation of which might improve his chances; much less Wejh, his original habitat, for it is there that his family, an important one in the Billi tribe, have their town quarters in the Hejaz. 184. A new and disconcerting element was introduced into the situation when, on the night of the 26th June, a party of seventy Beni Atiya crossed the frontier into the Hejaz to the east of Mudawwara, despite the attempts of a small Transjordan police patrol to hold them up. They were supposed to be heading for Tebuk, a place the loyalty of whose garrison has long been considered doubtful owing to the failure of the Hejazi Government to pay its members. Nothing further had been heard of these raiders up to the 30th June. Ihe Hejazi Government, faithful to the altered policy described in paragraph 181 above, received the news fairly philosophically. They did not fail, however, to point the morals of the incident from their point of view, renewing their accusations against the Amir Abdullah and their demand for an early treaty settlement and hinting at the danger of retaliation by incensed Nejdis. The Transjordan authorities promptly incarcerated at Kerak three leading sheikhs in order to discourage any further parties of Beni Atiya from invading the Hejaz. McocDonnell Investigation. 185. As stated elsewhere, Mr. Hope Gill pressed in May for the settlement of the Hejazi Government’s contribution to the cost of this enquiry. Sir A. Ryan reverted to the subject in June, but the moment was not propitious for energetic action, and the claim remained unsettled. Customs Relations. 186. Final form had been given in March to the reply to be given to the Hejazi Government, if they should revert (but not otherwise) to this long-standing question, which has been in abeyance for practical purposes since 1930. In the absence of any fresh representations from the Hejazi side, the reply continued to be held up throughout May and June; nor did the Legation inform the Hejazi Government of a decision of’the Transjordan Government, reported by the High Commissioner in May, to authorise, subject to certain conditions, the passage through Transjordan between Syria and Hejaz-Nejd of goods, other than arms and ammunition, the importation of which into Transjordan itself is prohibited. Iraq. 187. Some trouble arose in February owing to the arrival of a Nejdi force of twenty-five men and two armed cars at a well called Judaidat-al-Arar on the Iraq-Nejd frontier, and a claim made by the commanding officer to levy taxes on tribes in the vicinity. The force withdrew on the arrival of two Iraqi desert police cars, but the Nejdis reappeared in March, and the claim^ to tax any tribesmen entering Nejd territory, to which apparently the Hejaz-Nejd Govern ment consider Judaidat-al-Arar to belong, was reasserted in a letter from the Governor of Skaka to the Sheikh of the Iraqi Aneyza. Although the Iraqi Government have stated in at least one communication that Judaidat is considered to be an Iraqi well, they do not seem to be very sure of their ground for a territorial claim, and to rely more on an article in the I qair protocols prohibiting any military use by either side of watering places near the frontier. The Legation in Jedda is unaware of the position on the spot during May and June, but, from language held by the Iraqi Charge d Affaires to Sir A. Ryan on the 6th and 9th June, it appeared that the dispute was still in being. Dr. Naji spoke of the possibility of regarding the well as lying actuall-v on the frontier and being bisected by it. 188. The Ibn Rifada affair gave rise to rumours of more widespread trouble involving the frontier with Iraq, and they were perhaps stimulated by the news of the sudden resurn of Sir F. Humphrys to Bagdad, due, in fact, to quite other reasons, about that time. The Legation has no knowledge of any real malaise on that frontier, apart from the Judaidat affair. The best of the bazaar yarns was that King FeisaFs son had gone against his father and engaged in some10 anti-Saudian enterprise down south, and that King Feisal had addressed a letter of explanation and apology to Ibn Saud. Koweit and Bahrein. 189. Further progress was made in May and June in the following up of the various matters discussed by the Political Resident during his visit to ^ Ibn Saud at Hofuf in January. The question of the best approach to a more official discussion of the Koweit blockade still presented difficulty, and final instructions had not reached the Legation up to the end of June. The question of emergency landing-grounds on the Hasa coast passed into a new phase in the circumstances described in paragraph 217 below. The position regarding postal communication between Hasa and the outer world is described in paragraph 172. The Hejazi Government have not attempted to reopen the question of the status of their agents at Koweit and Bahrein since receiving the Political Resident's explanation of the difficulties in the way of recognising them officially. News was received at Jedda in May of the local settlement of the question arising out of a fresh intrusion of Ibn Saud’s people into Koweit territory in March, an apology for which was tendered by the King’s chief frontier officer and accepted by the sheikh. In June His Majesty’s Minister conveyed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs a request from Sir H. V. Biscoe that the arrangement made at Hofuf to enable Hindu traders, known as Bunniahs, to visit Qatif for periods not exceeding two months, should be extended to Jubail, with permission to prolong the stay in either case to three months. Ibn Saud agreed to the prolongation of time, but refused access to Jubail. 190. Sir A. Ryan expressed to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, on the 5th June, the gratification with which His Majesty’s Government had received the message sent by Ibn Saud through the Political Resident (see January-March report, paragraph 44). This message had not been acknowledged at the time of receipt, for reasons partly connected with the difficult situation between the Governments in February and March. 191. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin protested orally on the 23rd June against alleged action by the Bahrein authorities in requiring, it was said, a cargo of rice for the Hejazi Government to be landed instead of allowing it to be unloaded direct into dhows sent from the mainland. This was apparently the first case arising under the arrangements described in the January-March report, paragraph 49, which arrangements, according to explanations furnished in a report from the Political Agent, were more the concern of the shipowners concerned than the subject of an agreement entered into by him, although he had stated to the British Indian Steam Navigation Company the point of view of the Bahrein Government and other interests adversely affected by overside delivery. In the particular case about which Sheikh Yusuf Yasin protested, it was possible to reply that the rice had been shipped in the ordinary way of transit, and that no notice had been given by the steamship company that it was for overside delivery; to refute an allegation that it had been landed at the instance of the Bahrein authorities after having been actually first unloaded into dhows from the mainland; and to add that the Bahrein Government had remitted the duty as an exceptional measure. The incident, nevertheless, seems to necessitate a further examination of the somewhat difficult questions of principle involved. 192. Previously to this affair, Fuad Bey Hamza had, on the 11th May, spoken to Mr. Rendel at the Foreign Office about the more general question of transit dues at Bahrein, and had spoken of the Hejazi Government’s project of creating a port of their own at Ras Tanura as being a consequence of the refusal of the Bahrein authorities to waive duty in the case of goods for Ibn Saud and his Government. Fuad Bey was told that the matter would be examined. A sir and Yemen. 193. No development in the relations between Hejaz-Nejd and the Yemen were reported in May and June; nor anything of importance regarding the internal situation in Asir, which seemed to be well held. It was stated in June that the King was undertaking considerable reorganisation of the Asir administration, and was sending thither some eighty officials, mostly Hejazi, with a view to making the country productive from a revenue point of view. It is confirmed that a new Amir, a Nejdi, was recently appointed.[542 c—3] c 2 11 Chapter III .—Foreign Relations. General's Hejazi Mission. 194. The mission arrived in Paris about the beginning of May, after a short stay in Geneva. They came on from Paris to London on the 7th May and stayed until the 16th May. They subsequently visited The Hague (the 16th to the 19th May), Berlin (the 20th to the 24th May), Warsaw (the 25th to the 28th May), Moscow '(the 29th May to the 5th June), Constantinople (the 9th to the 12th June), and Angora (the 13th to the 19th June, or earlier). They were expected to reach Tehran via Constantinople and Baku on the 28th June. The dates given are approximate. Various references are made elsewhere to the business done. On the ceremonial side, the mission seem to have been received with much honour in all the capitals from which information has been received, but to have attracted comparatively little public attention. They lunched with President Doumer just before his assassination, and Fuad Bey flew from London to Paris to attend the funeral. They were given military honours at Dover, and met at Victoria by representatives of the King and Sir John Simon. In London they stayed as the guests of His Majesty’s Government at the Dorchester; visited Windsor privately on the 8th May; were received by His Majesty the King at Buckingham Palace on the 9th May, and visited the Morris Works in pouring rain that afternoon; attended a reception by the Hejazi Minister on the 10th May, and dined that evening with His Majesty’s Government at the Foreign Office, Sir John Simon presiding; were shown the Port of London, including the wine vaults full of alcoholic fumes, on the 11th May; and saw a display at Aldershot on the 12th May. The Amir attended their Majesty’s Court on the 11th May, and Fuad Bey the second Court on the 12th May. The Amir showed intelligent interest in what he saw, acquitted himself well at all functions, and appeared to enjoy his visit, in spite of a heavy cold, contracted in France, happily. Fuad Bey attended as few functions as possible, saw to the business side, which the Amir left entirely to him, and visited the House of Commons. The Amir was made a G.B.E., Fuad Bey a K.B.E. The official visit ended on the 14th May, and the mission fended for themselves during the Whitsun week-end. The farewell messages were most cordial, and included a happily-drafted message to the “charming people” of Great Britain, as well as the more conventional expressions of thanks to the King, &amp;c. At The Hague the mission was received by the Queen, and visited the Netherlands East Indies Exhibition. A day was spent in Amsterdam. Little information is available regarding the subsequent visits, except that on the Russian frontier the mission was hailed not only by officials but by brass bands, which “ played the International and various Arabian airs,” and were in Moscow entertained in the manner provided for State guests of the second category of importance. They also visited Leningrad. International Conferences, &amp;c. 195. There is nothing important to record. Great Britain. 196. The Hejazi Mission (i.e., for practical purposes Fuad Bey Hamza, as the Amir Feisal attended only the first business meeting, which was little more than formal) raised the following questions, which were discussed at official meetings on the 9th and 13th May :— (1) General Relations .—'The mission expressed Ibn Sand’s misgivings as to whether His Majesty’s Government loved hinj as wholeheartedly as of old. and his anxiety to be guided in his policy by the views of His Majesty’s Government, to whom he looked for both moral and material support. Sir L. Oliphant made cordial and reassuring statements in general terms on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. (2) Possibility of a Loan and Economic Developments .—As regards the former, see paragraph 165. As regards the latter, Fpad Bey mentioned Mr. Twitchell’s surveys and the King’s desire to look to Great Britain in all things. Nothing conclusive emerged.12 r (3) Haramain Wakfs. —Fuad Bey raised this question generally and with reference to a particular W akf created by a deceased Indian, who had died in Java, leaving property in Rangoon; Wakfs in Palestine; and possible Wakfs in Hyderabad. In his general remarks he intimated that the Hejazi Government might want to send a delegation to India to make enquiries, and was given a sympathetic hearing. His ^ Majesty's Government made active enquiries in due course about the first of the two specific matters mentioned, the results of which were communicated to the Legation in Jedda in June for the information of the Hejazi Government. (4) The Transjordan Frontier. —The mission pressed more particularly the question of a general settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan similar to that between the former and Iraq. They received an undertaking that the matter, though one of difficulty, would be studied energetically. It has since come still more to the forefront of Hejazi desiderata in the circumstances recorded in paragraph 181. (5) Soviet Activities and Relations between Hejaz-Nejd and U.S.S.R .— Fuad Bey threw his first statement on this subject into a request by Ibn Saud for advice. He was told that His Majesty’s Government conceived the views and tenets of the Soviet Government to be very different from those of l£&gt;n Saud, but that if the latter saw reason to alter the policy of coldness which, according to Fuad Bey, he had hitherto pursued towards the U.S.S.R., His Majesty’s Government could not feel aggrieved. Fuad Bey explained that the refusal of a loan by His Majesty’s Government might compel the Hejazi Govern- to “look elsewhere,” but his last word was that: “ As regards the Soviet, he thought it unlikely that there would be any important change in the attitude of his Government.” (6) Fuad Bey mentioned the question of the possible loan of a Royal Air Force mission to Hejaz-Nejd, a matter which he had discussed ' informally with Mr. Rendel, and which, so far, was merely the subject of a personal suggestion of his own. He was promised that it would be examined (see paragraph 215). [Paragraphs 197 and 198 omitted.] 199. Various minor questions were discussed less formally in the interval between the above meetings. Besides the matter just mentioned, they included the question of landing grounds in Hasa (see paragraph 217) and transit dues at Bahrein (see paragraph 191). 200. Sir A. Ryan left London a few days after the mission’s departure, and reached Jedda in H.M.S. “ Hastings ” on the 30th May. He was received with at least as much distinction as when he first arrived in Jedda, and there was an evident desire on the part of the King and the Hejazi Government to show that the clouds which had compelled his prolonged absence had really rolled by. From then until the 30th June the Ibn Rifada affair and its aftermath occupied the attention of the two Governments and the Legation, to the almost complete exclusion of everything except routine business. Despite the critical attitude of the Hejazi Government during the first half of the period, the diplomatic atmosphere was excellent throughout the whole of it. France. 201. Little is known of any business done by the Hejazi Mission in Paris, except that the French Government appear to have been pretty firm about the necessity for protective sanitary measures on the part of other Powers to minimise the danger of epidemics originating in the pilgrimage. 202. After various hitches over matters of language and verbal forms, ratifica tions were exchanged in Jedda on the 24th June of the treaty between France and Hejaz-Nejd and the Syrian customs agreement (November-December report, paragraph 47). Italy. 203. The Italian Government have appointed as Minister to Hejaz-Nejd Commendatore Ottavio de Poppo, who is understood to have been some timeconsul at Port Said and to have been recently in their Embassy at Madrid. Nothing is known as to the date of his arrival, but he has made enquiries about housing, servants, &amp;c., which reveal a pathetic ignorance as to what he is in for 204. The reply of the Italian Ministry for foreign Affairs to informal enquiries by His Majesty’s Embassy in Rome as to the latest Italian attitude in regard to Asir seems to show that, while the Italian Government do not consider themselves committed, by their recognition of I bn Saud and the conclusion of a treaty, to any acceptance of Hejazi claims (a point of view which they had explained to the Amir Feisal in Rome), the Italians are content to let the question lie dormant in the hope that it will settle itself. Germany. 205. A painful impression was created in Jedda at the beginning of May by the news that a German subject, named Ivrakowsky, had been set upon and beaten most severely by Ibn Saud's soldiery on the 30th April. This man had long lived in a hand-to-mouth way in Jedda. Having some flying experience, he had been engaged in the temporary organisation improvised to run the air force after the disintegration of the British personnel. He became involved in the labyrinth of intrigue connected with the air force and in the end terminated his connexion with it by crashing in the Jedda lagoon with a Wapiti which he had been dragged from a sickbed to fly to Asir. He was owed money by the Government and became a man with grievances, almost crazed probably by that and ill-health. It was alleged that on the 30th April he was found near the aerodrome with incendiary material. He had certainly been indiscreet in his language and in frequenting the neighbourhood of the palace, where he is said to have been guilty either of discourtesy or suspicious conduct in the King’s presence. There is reason to believe that the onslaught was due less to immediate causes than to revenge for the damage done to the Wapiti last year. Anyhow the beating was a monstrous affair and it is difficult to acquit Ibn Saud of personal responsibility, as he had arrived in Jedda that morning. The German consul felt unable to take a strong line in all the circumstances, but he was able to arrange for Krakowsky’s removal as a prisoner from the barracks into which he was thrown, to hospital and for his embarkation shortly after. Payment of the money due to him was refused, but the King eventually ordered that it should be given as a present to the consul to do what he liked with. 206. M. de Haas himself left Jedda in June, leaving the German consulate derelict. Soviet Russia. 207. Reference is made elsewhere to the possibility of a new orientation of Ibn Baud’s policy towards the U.S.S.R. under pressure of economic and financial necessity. The Russian Minister in Jedda has been very little in evidence. Egypt. 208. Reference is made in paragraph 181 to the first reaction of the Hejazi Government to the Ibn Rif a da affair, as regards Egypt. The Egyptian consul, Hafiz Bey Amer, is one of the people whom they suspect of complicity. There is no evidence that the suspicion is justified, although Hafiz Bey is certainly hostile to the present regime in the Hejaz and professes a personal wish that the country might be run otherwise in international Moslem interests. He returned to Jedda after a very prolonged absence in June, soapier in his ways than ever. His return was preceded by the usual rumour that he was bringing new instruc tions with a view to the settlement of outstanding questions. Iraq. 209. The dispute regarding the seat of the Iraqi Legation in the Hejaz remained unsettled throughout May and June. Dr. Naji Asil continued to reside in Jedda and was unable to present his letters, but was nevertheless received in Mecca on the 10th May for the exchange of the ratifications (which duly took place on that day) of the treaties concluded last year. The Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs accused him in confidential conversation with Sir A.14 Ryan on the 4th June of complicity in the machinations of King Ali and others whom they believe to be at the back of the Ibn Rifada affair. He visited Medina for a few days at the beginning of J une and was, according to his own account, very closely watched. He returned to Jedda on the 8th June and went to Taif to see Ibn Saud next day, before leaving rather unexpectedly for Bagdad on the 11th June. His object apparently was to get the King’s last word about the ^ Legation dispute. It was uncompromising, as might have been expected from ^ a reply which His Majesty had sent on the 28th April to a personal appeal from King Feisal. Both sides had so dug themselves into their positions that up to the end of June it seemed difficult for either to give way, unless the Amir Feisal’s visit to Bagdad, where he was to arrive on the 8th July, should prove to have provided a solvent. The outlook for normal and friendly relations was none too bright at the end of June, what with the acerbity of this difference, the suspicious ness of the Hejazi Government towards Dr. Naji, the dispute over Judaidat-al- Arar (see paragraph 187), and the fact that the Hejazi Charge d’Affaires elect at Bagdad was still in residence at Mecca. 210. The Iraqi Government are still anxious for an agreement over the less contentious but long-drawn-out question of the organisations of an overland motor route for pilgrims from Iraq. Afghanistan. 211. The Afghan Mission (see March report, paragraph 68), concluded a treaty with Hejaz-Nejd on the 5th May, after Ahmad Shah Khan had presented credentials to Ibn Saud on the 3rd May. The treaty had not been published up to the 30th June. It is noteworthy that both the reception and the signing of the treaty took place in Jedda. It was categorically stated in the account of the former in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” that the presentation of letters had been delayed until the King could come to Jedda, because “ in Mecca, on account of religious and traditional reasons, no diplomatic ceremonies can be held.” The Hejazi Government were doubtless anxious to strengthen their case in the quarrel over the seat of the Iraqi Legation. It is unfortunate that the differences of Moslems should cause diplomacy to be regarded as an occupation too profane to be pursued in a Holy Place. The Afghan Mission left Jedda via India on the 14th May. 212. It is worth noting that the Indian agitator Ismail Ghuznavi, a protege of Ibn Saud with pretensions to be his representative in India, took it on himself to broadcast the news of the conclusion of the treaty to a large number of papers, &amp;e., mostly Indian, but including also the “ Corriere ” of Milan and the United Press of Berlin, to whom he represented it as an event to which far- reaching political importance was attached. 213. The Afghan Mission, while in Mecca, arranged to buy an existing house, belonging to the Governor of Jedda, to serve as the projected hostel for pilgrims. Other Countries. 214. There is nothing of importance to record except that the representa tives of the Netherlands, Turkey and Persia left Jedda in May and had not returned up to the end of June. Adequate arrangements for the carrying on of routine business by juniors of no great individual interest were made in each case. Chapter IV .—Air Matters. Hejazi Air Force. 215. The equipment in Jedda remained useless and more or less derelict during May and June. When the Hejazi Mission were in London, Fuad Bey suggested at an informal discussion that His Majesty's Government should reconsider their attitude of last autumn and reverted to his personal suggestion that they might offer a Royal Air Force mission on a moderate scale which he indicated. It was suggested to him that he might mention the matter at an official meeting and he did so on the 13th May. In due course the Foreign Office, who were now inclined to favour the proposal, entered into correspondence on the subject with the Air Ministry.15 216. In June, the Legation was approached by Misr Airwork, an Egyptian company associated with Airwork (Limited), of Heston Airport in England, for advice as to the utility of offering to demonstrate to Ibn Baud an Avro machine suitable for instructional and light military purposes, which they had been showing in Persia and Iraq. They thought, having in mind, inter alia, the prospect of military operations in the Hejaz, that the King would find this type of aircraft handier and cheaper than Wapitis. Sir A. Ryan prepared a guarded reply, but arranged that it should not be delivered in Egypt before His Majesty’s Government had approved of it. Emergency Landing Grounds. 217. Following on the discussion of this during the Political Resident’s visit to Hofuf in January, Mr. Hope Gill was instructed on the 3rd May to seek Ibn Baud’s definite assent to the selection and marking of emergency landing grounds at Darin and Jinnah by or in consultation with Royal Air Force, Iraq, and to a Royal Air Force reconnaissance of Makta with a view to similar arrangements there, if it should prove suitable. He was to be guided by earlier instructions as to the question of rent and cost of preparation. The King’s precipitate departure from Jedda prevented Mr. Hope Gill from taking the question up with His Majesty in person. He had what appeared to be promising conversations with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, but it soon appeared that the Hejazi Government preferred that the matter should be dealt with by their mission in London, who were not, however, to take the initiative in raising it. It was accordingly discussed informally, but closely, between Fuad Bey and Mr. Rendel, of the Foreign Office, on the 11th May, and by the same, with the assistance of Captain Peirse, of the Air Ministry, on the 13th May. The position reached was that it remained for the Air Ministry to prepare, in the light of those discussions, a fresh statement for communication to the Hejazi Government as regards both the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government and the quid pro quo which they would be prepared to offer. Alleged Aerial Trespass in Hejaz-Nejd Territory. 218. No fresh complaints were received in May or June. Certain earlier complaints regarding violations of territory alleged to have^occurred in February and March were reported by the authorities concerned and a suitable communi cation was addressed to the Hejazi Government on the 25th May. Chapter V .—Military Matters. 219. There is nothing of importance to record apart from what is stated elsewhere, especially in the section dealing with the Transjordan frontier. Chapter VI .—Naval Matters. 220. The only naval visit, British or foreign, to Jedda was that of H.M.S. “ Hastings,” which arrived with His Majesty's Minister on board on the 30th May and stayed to the 2nd June. By the end of June both Red Sea sloops were in the north of the Red Sea in connexion with the Ibn Rifada affair. Chapter VII.— Pilgrimage. 221. The dispersal of the pilgrims proceeded normally in May and June. The sanitary condition of returning pilgrims was satisfactory and the Alexandria Quarantine Board formally declared the pilgrimage clean on the 3rd May. It was reported from India in June that twenty cases of small-pox were discovered in one pilgrim ship on its return to Bombay. Telegrams were exchanged between the Government of India and the Legation about this mysterious affair, but it had not been fully elucidated up to the end of the month. The problem of the repa triation of destitute pilgrims has again been somewhat formidable this year. No further details under this heading need be given in this already lengthy report, as it is hoped to distribute earlier than usual the full report on the 1932 pilgrimage.c 16 ^ r Chapter VIII.— Slavery. 222. Five male and three female slaves took refuge in the Legation in May and June. They were disposed of as follows :— Manumitted and repatriated : 3 males. Locally manumitted : 1 male and 1 female. Left the Legation voluntarily before being dealt with : 1 male. On hand at end of June : 2 females. 223. The eases of two women of presumed Abyssinian origin were referred by telegraph to His Majesty’s Minister in Addis Ababa, in pursuance of the arrangements recommended last year (November-December report, paragraph 78), with a request that he should ascertain whether the Ethiopian Government would make itself responsible for them. The matter was still pending at the end of June and seemed unlikely to go smoothly owing to the difficulty of supplying adequate particulars, a difliculty likely to arise in the case of all slaves captured in early childhood and brought up in Arabia. 224. The Hejazi Mission in London made no attempt to reopen the question of Royai slaves nor was it adverted to in Jedda. The mission took with them as servant an ex-slave, possibly though not certainly manumitted ad hoc. He proved an intelligent observer of things seen on the tour. Chapter IX:— Miscellaneous. Legation Staff. 225. His Majesty’s Minister returned to Jedda on the 30th May, as already stated. Probationer Vice-Consul Gamble arrived on the 6th May to take up the post of an acting vice-consul, attached to the Legation, for the sole purpose of studying Arabic, subject to a proviso that he might be employed for a strictly limited time daily on other work in order to learn the routine. Mr. Hope Gill and Mr. Furlonge both proceeded on leave on the 3rd June, a coincidence resulting from Mr. Hope Gill's long detention during Sir A. Ryan's absence. 226. The Malay pilgrimage officer returned to Malaya on the 14th May. There were some changes in the subordinate personnel of the medical section. Deportation. 227. Certain questions of principle connected with deportation were discussed in a Foreign Office despatch to Jedda of the 4th May. In view of the arbitrary attitude sometimes taken up by the Hejazi authorities in connexion with the deportation of British subjects, the Legation was authorised, if it should) think it desirable, to endeavour to obtain some reciprocal agreement with the Hejazi Government for a more rigid application of the usual international procedure, but the Foreign Office expressed the view, which Sir A. Ryan shared, that it would be better, instead of inviting a general discussion of principles, to try to get that Government to apply such practice in individual cases. 228. In one case the Sudan Government sent to Jedda a person, believed to be a Hejazi, who had entered the Sudan irregularly, without awaiting the formal assent of the Hejazi Government. The latter asked rather insistently that he should be sent back to the Sudan, but it was possible to put the matter to them in such a way that they did not return to the charge up to the 30th June. The man was at least half-crazy and had assumed many names (including that of President Hindenburg) at various times, so that his actual origin was hard to determine.w -Notes. Register No. P. i -.

Ibn Saud. THE King left Riyadh on the 2nd January for Hufuf, the capital 01 the Hasa. News of this visit was telegraphed by His Majesty’s Minister to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and advantage was taken of it to arrange a meeting between Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe and Ibn Saud, with results which are mentioned in paragraphs 41 to 43. Colonel Biscoe arrived at Hufuf on the 23rd January and stayed until the 28th. On the 7th February Ibn Saud left the Hasa to return to Riyadh for the Id-al-Fitr, the breaking of the fast of Ramadan. He remained there for the rest of February and March. A ccession Day. 2. His Majesty the King telegraphed a message of good wishes to Ibn Saud on the occasion of the anniversary of the latter’s accession day, the 8th January. 3. As a result of the opposition of the Wahhabi Ulama of Nejd, reported in paragraph 21 of the Jedda report for last May-June, this year’s celebration of accession day was modest by comparison with that of last year. Mecca, being a religious centre under puritan protection, was entirely spared the defilement which joy occasions; but at Jedda, where morals are looser, school-children sang about the streets, the Governor held a morning reception of the foreign repre sentatives, happily not a very gay affair, and the afternoon was devoted to a tea-party at the Green Palace—which, incidentally, has not yet been paid for— the palace, that is, not the tea-party. This was organised by the local Celebration Committee, and attended by the Viceroy, who came from Mecca expressly for the function. The annual celebration was thus deliberately repeated, in spite of the King’s promises to his divines to be good; but there was neither review nor dinner-party, nor the poetry-cum-picnic-luncheon at Wadi Fatima, features which so polluted the occasion last year. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 4. Although His Majesty’s Minister had returned to Jedda on the 15th December, no effective contact with the Hejazi Foreign Ministry, otherwise than by letter or telephone, was possible until the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs returned from Nejd, whither he had gone on the 15th December. He left Riyadh on the 2nd January, arrived at Mecca on the 5th, and came to Jedda on the 7th, followed the next day by his princeling-Minister. The latter made no attempt to live up to his title of Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was, nevertheless, entertained to dinner at the Legation on the 11th January, and seemed languidly pleased. All business was transacted with Fuad Bey Hamza, in a series of interviews held on the 11th, 13th. 16th, 18th, 19th, 21st and 24th January. The Amir Feisal returned to Mecca on the 18th, his Under-Secretary on the 26th. 5. They returned to Jedda together on the 10th February for the signing of the Italian treaty, remained to meet the first Iraqi diplomatic representative on the 14th. and left again on the 17th. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires discussed current matters with the Under-Secretary on the 11th and 16th. The next visit to Jedda was paid on the 18th March, when Fuad Bey came alone to discuss pilgrimage matters with Mr. Hope Gill. He did so on the 19th, and left a day or two later. He was in Jedda again during the last days of March fixing up his trip to Europe, but was not heard or seen by the Legation. Perhaps he felt that ten conversations a quarter were enough to hold with any foreign mission. Be that as it may, His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires, for his part, was disposed to agree that one can easily have too much of a bad thing. Constitutional Reform. 5 a. In paragraph 3 of the last Jedda report it was remarked that Ibn Saud had at length conceded the principle of a Cabinet charged with joint responsibility for Government and individual responsibility for departmental affairs. On the 15th January the “ Umm-al-Qura ' published in the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, a “Regulation concerning the Council of Ministers.” In form it calls for more compassion than a busy man is inclined to feel, such a rigmarole is it, such a mesh-work of cunning knots and slip-knots. In effect,however, it is just the sort of measure in which a subtle Syrian Under-Secretary of State can entangle an autocratic Nejdi Director-General of finance, who has been keeping him and his friends short of funds. 1 hat, of course, is its raison d'etre, to arm the intrusive Syrian clique against the possessive Nejdi gang. A Fuad Bey Hamza had long been preparing it. What is probably its most efiective article reads: Ministers may make enquiry of each other and ask tor a written explanation of each other's actions. The decree s least convincing feature 1S its title, “ Council of Ministers.” There is only one individual Minister in the country, namely, the Amir Feisal, and he is quadriform, being v lcei ^ ) &gt; . an President of the Council as well as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and now Minister for the Interior, a new function and Ministry brought surreptitiously to fri^f y implication out of article 3. ' Ministers who attend the (Council are the U n er- Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the Director-General of Finance, the Vice-1 resident of the Legislative Assembly, and a Nejdi make-weight, added in Maich, the Director of Finance Departments, who happens to be a brother of the Director- General. “ The Council is to meet nightly,” says article 12. I here seems to be more of the Thousand Nights and a Night in it all than of modern statecraft. The text of this important constitutional advance forms Annex “ A to this report. Financial Reform. 6 Paragraphs 3 to 7 of the last Jedda report gave warning of the new “ budget,” and a copy of that instrument was annexed to the report. It is now possible to show more of its inner workings. These are exposed in a tentative schedule drawn up by the Legation, which forms Annex “ B ' to this report. Items 1 to 5, comprising royal and military expenditure and liquidation of debt, are officially estimated in round-figure sums, multiples of 110. It is therefore fairly safe to assume that they are based on the official gold rate of 110 piastres Miri = £1. Thus the King is paid in gold. The fifteen sub-divisions of item 6, however, are estimated to the uttermost piastre. They represent the costs of administration, such as salaries, wages, &amp;c., and in view of the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs’ admission of the 19th January to His Majesty’s Minister, that much of the expenditure lumped together in the ' budget as piastres Miri would in fact be incurred in silver, it is also fairly sale to assume that all payments under item 6 are calculated to be made in silver piastres. ^ 7. This curiously mixed statement of estimated expenditure, called “ the budget,” seems to bear no relation at all to the percentage allotments confidentially stated last year to form the basis of the budgetary reform (November-December report, paragraph 4). This basis seems to have gone by the board already^ It was, indeed,^not clear how the King could live on it, since it left him entirely out of account. It is now clear, however, that he or his comptroller, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, will receive about half the total Hejazi revenue, namely, items 1 to 3, or £410,000 to be devoted to royal and military needs. The Hejaz- Nejd memorandum, circulated at the Disarmament Conference at Geneva, leads one to suppose that he will also take care of item 4. £100.000 for Communications and Transport, and thereby have the spending of half-a-million pounds. 8. If revenue does not come up to expectations—and these have been left conveniently vague—item 5, liquidation of Government indebtedness, will undoubtedly be the first to suffer the pinch, followed by item 6. the salaries and wages of Government servants. The first four months of the Hejazi financial year have now passed, but only three months’ salaries and wages have been paid, this failure is additional to the four to eight months’ previous arrears of pay which have been consolidated for eventual liquidation under item 5. , 9. The Hejaz of Ibn Saud, in fact, is not unlike the England of King Charles II, with the pleasing difference that the King does not have to ask Parliament for money. His Nejdis control revenue at the source and send most of it in specie to His Majesty. At the end of Ramadan, for instance, no salaries were paid, but £12.000 in sovereigns and 100,000 silver riyals (nominally £10,000\ were reported to have been sent from Mecca to the King at Riyadh. Nevertheless, Ibn Saud has been recently heard to say that he literally hardly knows how to support himself and his family, and that one quarter of the revenues of Hasa had to be remitted to Mecca to help finance the Hejaz. 10. To sum up the financial reform in the dictum of an ex-mayor of Jedda. “ the whole budget is so much eye-wash.” [7003] n 2r 4 11. News of the engagement of a Dutch financial adviser, M. van Leeuwen, was published in March. He is expected to complete his labour in a year. The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 1st April published a vigorous denial of the rumoured loan of £500,000 by His Majesty’s Government to Ibn Baud, “ in return for his renunciation of certain matters which affect his independence, such as the appointment of an English adviser to supervise the organisation of his finances ” Forgetting the hints and requests and negotiations of last year for financial aid from London and Amsterdam, the editor concluded : “ The Government of His Majesty have not contracted a loan with anybody, thank God, and they cannot tolerate interference in any matter which concerns their complete and full independence.” M. van Leeuwen is due to arrive in April. 12. The market value of the Saudi riyal fluctuated during the quarter between 17 and 15 to the gold sovereign, and 13 and 11| to the £ sterling, with a strengthening tendency due to the approaching pilgrimage. Economic Situation. 13. Ramadan is normally an expensive and busy month, w T hen the merchants and shop-keepers expect to do well. This year there was absolute stagnation in Mecca, and conditions were little better in Jedda. The populations of the towns were too crippled with debt to move. Such information as was received about the tribes indicated that their condition was still no better than that of utmost misery described in paragraph 17 of the November-December report. Economic Development. 14. Mr. Twitchell returned to the Hejaz on the 18th January from his prospecting tour in Nejd and the Hasa, the main results of which are still hidden. It is known, however, that he advocates the sinking of wells along the Jedda- Riyadh-Hufuf road, and the construction of a harbour at Ras Tanura on the Hasa coast. In the latter half of February he examined some ancient workings near Medina called “ Mahd Dhahab ” or “ Cot of Gold,” which are supposed to date from Harun-ar-Rasdid’s days. He considers it worth while to employ up to 100 men in sampling the site. His confederate, Mr. Moseley, working alone on quartzes near Taif, does not seem to have found anything worth reporting. He left early in March for the United States of America, and Mr. and Mrs. Twitchell sailed for the Yemen on the 7th March, leaving voluminous reports and recommendations in the hands of Ibn Saud and his Council. The former apparently resented being given advice for which he had not asked. The latter passed the reports round amongst their more commercially-connected friends, no doubt with suitable safeguards against the time when concessions should be granted and the work of development begun. If mere cupidity were enough, this would be the wealthiest country in the world. But where energy and ability is needed, there is no power and no might save in God alone. Custom*. 15. The Jedda customs receipts for the first three Moslem months of the financial year, which began on the 11th December last, were, according to unofficial information supplied to the Legation, 4,925,558-30 piastres Miri, equivalent at the rate of exchange then ruling to £27,400 gold. Other Red Sea ports of the kingdom, e.g., Yanbu, took perhaps half as much again, which would bring the total to about £40,000 gold. The Persian Gulf Customs were farmed out in January last for 11 lakhs of rupees to Muhammad-at-Tawil, once Prime Minister of the Hejaz, during the reign of King Ali. He was sent to the Hasa by Ibn Saud in the autumn of 1930 to reform the Customs Administration (Jedda report for September to November 1930, paragraph 4). In February, however, Muhammad- at-Tawil apparently had to ask that the figure of 11 lakhs should be redhced. as he was unable to raise the amount. He visited Jedda in March, after a year and a half’s absence in Nejd, whither he has now returned unwillingly at the King’s orders. In his present frame of mind it is Quite possible that he may try to escape the country, once back on the Persian Gulf coast, and seek freedom by way of Bahrein.Wireless System. 16. None of the monthly instalments of £1,000 have been paid to the Marconi Company since last August. It is understood that they have now been relegated to item 5 of the “budget,” entitled indebtedness, payable if and when funds admit. Meanwhile, the work of installation proceeded slowly. Mr. Roucicault is believed to have completed the ^-kilowatt station at Qaf or Qaryat-al-Milh, the “ salt-villages ” in the Wadi Sirhan. Kurdy Bev has started work on the main 6-kilowatt station at Mecca. Communications. 17. The projected motor-route to connect Medina with Iraq has made no material progress. It is still in the stage of a preliminary exchange of views as to terms, dues payable, passport and quarantine controls, &amp;c., between the Hejazi and Iraqi Governments. The former's proposals are greedy, and not very practical, and have not been well received Legislation. 18. A voluminous commercial code at length completed piecemeal publication in the “ Umm-al-Qura ’ in February. All that is now lacking in this respect is a competent court and bar ; the existing Majlis-at-Tujjar or Tribunal of Merchants is most incompetent. 19. Instructions governing the boarding of ships lying in Jedda harbour were issued in January. They were brought officially to the notice of the foreign missions in February. These were asKed to supply lists of the names of their staffs, so that embarkation permits might be issued to them. This appeared to His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires to infringe diplomatic immunity, and therefore meet to be resisted, in that momentary forgetfulness to carry the permit might seriously interfere with the performance of a duty to visit an incoming or departing vessel. He therefore expressed regret to the Hejazi Government that he could not instruct the Legation staff to carry this type of permit, but he communicated the required lists, containing thirty-three names, and asked that they might he made known to the control officials posted on the quay. There the matter has been allowed to rest, and no cases of interference have been experienced since a few unsuccessful attempts were made in January to hold up the Indian vice-consul when visiting pilgrim ships. 20. No other legislation of importance was enacted during the period under review. Wakfs. 21. At the beginning of the year a zealous body was formed in Mecca, which called itself the “ A.wqaf-al-Harameyn Claims Association,” having the object of “ claiming through legitimate channels that which is due to the people of the two Holy Sanctuaries, Mecca and Medina, in the way of donations and Awqaf in various countries.” A committee of ten has been formed under the presidency of Sheikh Abdullah-ash-Sheybi. son of Sheikh Abdul Qadir-ash-Sheybi, hereditary Keeper of the Keys of the Kaba, whose family has battened more fatlv on the faithful than have most Meccawis, and is now peerless. The Rub-aTKhali. 22. The Empty Quarter has again been crossed by an Englishman, this time under the auspices of Ibn Saud, who, according to the Umm-al-Qura appears to regard that desert also as a part of his dominions. Mr. Philby set out from Hufuf on the 6th January, and reached Mecca on the 5th April. Ibn Saud's Amir of Hasa provided him with thirty-two of the best Omaniya camels and eighteen Bedouin, sectional sheikhs of the Ajman and Murra tribes, as companions and guides. Their route was as follows : Hufuf, Salwa, on the coast between Qatar and Hasa, the Jabrin oasis, Maqainama Well (22° 15' N., 49° 10' E.), Bir Fadhil (22° 15' N., 50° 20' E.), Farajja (21° 35' N., 50° 45' E.), 10 miles to the west of which Mr. Philby thinks he found the Bedouin traditional site of the ancient city of Ubar (which really was in the Yemeni highlands), Naifa (19° 50' N., 51° E.), and Shanna (19° N., 51° 05' E.).0 23. From Shanna they made an attempt to cross the Emptiest Eighth, the 350-mile wide, completely waterless, tract between Shanna and Sulaiyi! (20° 25' N., 45° 30' E.). On the fifth day out, however, and about a third of the way across the camels failed, and they had to make back to the nearest water, Naifa, which they reached in another five days, on the 1st March, their water giving out twelve hours before they came to the well. 24. At Naifa they rested and re-formed. Mr. Philby sent back to Riyadh the fourteen weakest camels, three having died, with eight men and all tents and other baggage. He made the second attempt westward light, with fifteen camels and 10 men. On the tenth day. after 111 hours’ marching across completely waterless sand and gravel, during which the camels received no water and picked up practically no vegetation, the party reached Sulaiyil with two petrol-tins of water in reserve. Thence they made their way leisurely by Bisha, Turaba and Taif, to Mecca. Mr. Philby visited Jedda on the 6th April. He must have covered some 1,500 miles in the ninety days’ outing, but showed remarkably little sign of the strain. He has enough specimens and material to work on for a year, but has first to answer the shower of well-deserved congratulatory telegrams and offers, which has met him in Jedda from all parts of the world, including one from Mr. Bertram Thomas. Chapter TT.— Frontier Questions. Transjordan. Raiding. 25. No raids were reported to have been made during the quarter from either side of the frontier, yet all was not quiet on the northern front. Frontier Meetings. 26. It will be recalled that, after much diplomatic preparation in Jedda, a series of meetings between the frontier representatives for the liquidation of past raids and the settlement of future differences was arranged last April. The preliminary meeting took place on the 3rd June, 1931, when contact was established between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz ibn Zeyd. The first phase of the main meeting was not held until the 15th August; the Nejdi was then quite unprepared, but agreed to return a little loot, while Captain Glubb feared open rupture if they were to meet again and went on leave. At the end of October, however, he invited the Sheikh to meet him again for the second phase. He received a reply two months later and they met near Haditha on the 7th January. This meeting proved fruitless. The atmosphere was very friendly and the two representatives quite old friends, but the Nejdi had no authority to negotiate or compromise. Captain Glubb on his part declined to discuss the 1930-31 claims until the raid of the 28th September last was disposed of. They failed to agree on this or any matter, except provisionally to meet again after Ramadhan, mid-February. The legation is unaware that this or any other meeting has been held. H is Majesty's Minister's visit to Jerusalem. 27. In pursuance of a plan provisionally made in London while on leave last autumn, but advanced somewhat by certain circumstances in Transjordan, His Majesty’s Minister left Jedda on the 2nd February to visit His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan. He spent the 12th and 13th at Amman, where the following matters were discussed with the British Resident, who was assisted by Mr. Kirkbride, Peake Pasha, and Captain Glubb :— (1) The Atun section of the Huweytat, with special reference to— (a) Their national status. (b) Araif camels. (c) The effects of the raid of the 28th September, 1931. (d) Hejazi handling of the loot taken. (2) The Beni Atiya— (a) Their national status. (b) The proposed refusal to them of access to Transjordan.(3) {a) General question of determination of tribal nationality. [b) Possibility of agreement with Hejaz-Nejd as to allocation of tribes. (4) The military and quasi-military situation on the frontier, with special reference to— («) Competitive establishment of posts. \b) I bn Sand’s alleged military preparations. (5) The general situation on the frontier, with special reference to— {a) Actual or possible recrudescence of raiding. [b) Glubb-Ibn Zeyd position and future co-operation. [c) Complaints against Captain Glubb, retaliatory confiscation, with holding returnable loot. [d) Handing over of “ raiding criminals.” (6) {a) Diplomatic discussion at Jedda of Fuad Bey Hamza's “ principles.” (b) Establishment of direct and normal Transjordan relations with Hejaz-Nejd. (7) Minor points outstanding at the end of 1931— {a) Commission on loot. (b) Allegation of asylum given to criminals. (c) Allegations of enticement. (d) Taxation of sojourners. (e) Press attacks. (8) Closer and more direct collaboration between Jerusalem and Jedda— (a) Greater conciseness in Transjordan reports and greater expedition in forwarding. (b) Sifting of Transjordan reports by Jerusalem in the light of major policy. (c) Importance of recording all raids, and as soon as possible. (d) Clear indication as to distribution of copies of despatches and reports. (e) Codes. (/) Exchange of intelligence. (9) Miscellaneous— {a) Nature of Transjordan forces, (b) Bedouin Control Board and the Amir Shakir. {c) Druze refugees in Nejd. (d) Frontier at Jebel Tubaik. {e) Commercial relations with Hejaz-Nejd. (/) Wireless communications. 28. These discussions at Amman, though not conclusive on various questions, were most useful and enabled His Majesty’s Minister to clear up many points in a frank and friendly manner. Sir A. Ryan has recorded his appreciation of the courtesy shown him by Colonel Cox and his colleagues, and their readiness to recognise that such divergencies of view as arise from time to time are not due to unwillingness on the part of the Legation at Jedda to support Transjordan in dealing with a most troublesome situation, but to the frequent difficulty of accommodating action as regards Transjordan questions, with the broad policy of keeping Ibn Sand sweet and giving him moral support for reasons of Imperial interest. 29. On the 13th February His Majesty's Minister was received by the Amir Abdullah, who was most affable. He spoke temperately throughout of the ‘‘King of Nejd.'' While not excluding the possibility of full recognition of Ibn Sand, if His Majesty’s Government considered that the right course, he put his finger unerringly on the weak spot, from his point of view, in any argument in favour of his adopting it just now. As the most likely aspirant, perhaps, to the reversion of the Hejazi throne, should the Saudian regime collapse, he is doubtless very unwilling to compromise his hopes by recognising the kingship of Tbn Saud at a time when the latter’s position is menaced by so many difficulties.» 8 30. On the 15th February His Majesty’s Minister reviewed with His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan the most important, from a Jerusalem point of view, of the matters discussed on the previous days at Amman. Sir A. Ryan left Jerusalem on the 16th for London, whither he had been unexpectedly summoned for consultation by His Majesty’s Government. Export of Cereals. 31. The Hejaz-Nejd Government drew the Legation’s attention in January to reports they had received of some sort of an embargo on trade from Trans jordan into Nejd. After enquiry had been made of Jerusalem, they were informed that an embargo had been placed on the export from Transjordan of cereals, irrespective of their destination, and that the order had been necessitated by internal prices in Transjordan, but might be removed in the future. The Hejazi Government replied in March that they appreciated these motives, but hoped that it might now be possible to remove the prohibition against their own subjects. I bn Hamdan. 32. At the instance of the High Commissioner for Transjordan, the Hejaz- Nejd Government’s serious attention was drawn in February to an unfriendly incident of the 28th December, staged on the frontier by Nejdi troops under the command of one Ibn Hamdan. They had apparently approached four Transjordan Arab Legionaries who were encamped in Transjordan territory, executed a war dance before them, and fired at an improvised target; they had then drawn closer and scrutinised the Legion camp through field-glasses. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires protested against this unwarranted and unfriendly action on the part of armed forces under the control of the Hejaz-Nejd Govern ment, asked for a full enquiry, and suggested that in the interests of friendly relations they should inform him of the action taken to punish those rseponsible. 33. In conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in March, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs seemed disposed to argue that the Transjordan Legionaries had been camped in Nejd territory, but he promised a full investigation and an early reply. No reply has yet been received. MacDonnell Investigation. 34. His Majesty’s Minister followed up the earlier representations recorded in paragraph 35 of the last Jedda report by speaking emphatically to the Under secretary for Foreign Affairs on the 11th January about the refusal of the Hejaz- Nejd Government to bear their share of the costs of the MacDonnell Investigation. He strongly advised them to reconsider their attitude without awaiting the reaction of His Majesty’s Government to their note of the 28th November, hinting that otherwise the reaction might be very disagreeable. On the 17th January Fuad Hamza wrote semi-officially to say that His Majesty the King had given his gracious command to the effect that no objection should be raised to the payment of the sum and that he sanctioned its payment to the British Government, with thanks. The sum has not, of course, been paid, and is unlikely to be paid until item 5 of the budget ” is financed (see paragraph 8 above). The sum in question is £1,726 7s. 8c?. The Beni Atiya. 35. The movement of Beni Atiya into Transjordan foreseen by Captain Glubb last summer (see paragraph 37 of the Jedda report for September-October) actually took place in February, when some 250 tents moved northward over the frontier. Their motive, however, was apparently rather to find grazing than to escape punishment, although they seem to have deserved it—unless, indeed, it be true, as suggested by Captain Glubb last year, that they had received carte- blanche from Ibn Saud to raid, in order to dissuade disaffected Hejazi tribes further south from making northward for Transjordan through the Beni Atiya dira. No rain at all is said to have fallen this year in the Northern Hejaz between its northern frontier and a point some 50 miles south of Taima, so that the Beni Atiya, together with the Huweytat-at-Tihama and the Billi, moved both north and south from their normal diras in search of grazing.9 36. While some were moving northward, the Amir of the district sallied forth from Tabuk with 130 camelmen and a machine gun. He set out immediately after the fast of Ramadhan and held to the eastward of the Beni Atiya tents, marching quickly up the Hejaz Railway until near the Transjordan frontier. A little short of Hajj he turned westward, thus interposing his force between the moving tribe and Transjordan. On the 14th and 15th February he fell upon the nearest tents and progressed steadily southward through the rest of them back to Tabuk, which he reached on the 20th after mopping up everything in his way and driving off 350 camels, the Arabs say, beside many more sheep. On the same day the leading tents of the Beni Atiya began to cross into Transjordan. The southward-bound portion of the tribe had meanwhile passed to the south of Taima. 37. Information available to the Royal Air Force in Transjordan indicates that the Beni Atiya who entered Transjordan were refugees from justice, but Captain Glubb, who was in close touch with them, was convinced that their migration was of a routine nature, but began before the normal time because of the lack of rain further south. By the middle of March, according to Royal Air Force reports, 300 tents had crossed the frontier with 2,000 camels. They were collected well away from the frontier and sent north of Ma'an under police supervision. 38. On the 29th February the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London requested that these tribesmen should be returned by the Transjordan authorities to the Hej az. It was'suggested to him at the Foreign Office that such frontier questions could best be raised through the frontier authorities, or, if that was impracticable, through the Legation at Jedda. He promised to suggest the former channel to his Government, but the latter on the 9th March addressed themselves to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, invoking the inconclusive corre spondence of 1930-31 about denial of refuge in Transjordan to certain Beni Atiya groups (see 1931, January-February report, paragraph 11), and expressing the hope that the British Government would agree to refusing present refuge to the Beni Atiya in Transjordan. An exchange of views and reports on the facts of the matter proceeded between London and Jerusalem, but no decision as to a reply had been reached by the end of the month. Iraq. 39. Material for reply to Fuad Bey Hamza’s demarche of last September (September-October report, paragraph 39) regarding certain remnant chiefs in Iraq of the 1929 Nejdi rebellion was received in January, but was not used, as Fuad Bey had not again mentioned the matter, and the Iraqi representative was expected shortly to arrive. The gist of the reply, if made, would have been that these chiefs were not near the frontier, and that, so far as was known, they were keeping quiet and had received no special favours. 40. The Iraqi representative’s arrival is reported in paragraph 68. It is to be hoped that he will shortly be in a position to relieve the Legation completely of questions concerning Iraq. Koweit and Bahrein. Biscoe-Ibn Saud Meeting. 41. As soon as it was known definitely in Jedda that Ibn Saud had left Riyadh on the 2nd January for the Hasa, steps were taken to bring about the courtesy visit to him of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf which had been spoken of at His Majesty’s Minister’s audience of the King on the 2nd March, 1931 (March-April report, paragraph 29), and recorded at the inter departmental conference held at the Foreign Office on the 12th August (September-October report, paragraph 42), as a necessary preliminary to the negotiation of the Persian Gulf questions. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs having arrived at Jedda and His Majesty at Hufuf, Sir A. Ryan was able to communicate through the former by wireless with the latter and prepare him for the visit. On the 17th January Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe telegraphed a personal message from Bushire via Bahrein to Ibn Saud and received a reply asking him to come as soon as possible. Accompanied by the Political Agents at [7003] c11 47. On the 11th January, having at length received full particulars from Koweit, His Majesty's Minister addressed the Hejaz-Nejd Government on the subject of a series of armed incursions made into Koweit territory in August and October 1931 by officials of Ibn Saud. He stated that these intrusions were of the most serious cencern to His Majesty’s Government, in view of their special ^ position in regard to Koweit. In protesting against them, he requested that the guilty parties be punished and that instructions be given to all frontier officers that neither they nor their men should enter Koweit territory without proper sanction. The Hejazi Government replied, on the 23rd January, that the truth of the allegation was being investigated and that the frontier Amirs had been ordered to see that no one entered Koweit without a permit. On the 29th January a telegram was received from Colonel Biscoe to the effect that the King had shown him at Hufuf a telegram from the Foreign Ministry at Mecca purporting to give the substance of Sir A. Ryan’s note of the 11th January and the Ministry’s reply. The note, as reported to the King, demanded that no Nejdis should in future enter Koweit; the King had therefore replied that no Koweitis should in future enter Nejd. 48. Fortunately for good relations. Colonel Biscoe w^as able to convince I bn Saudi on the spot that there must have been a mistake, since only the incursion of armed forces had been objected to; the latter at once cancelled his former instructions. Sir A. Ryan also rubbed into Fuad Bey Hamza, who was no doubt responsible for misrepresenting to the King the contents of his note, the exact meaning of the clear language he had used. That phrase of Ibn Sand’s recurs to the mind : “ On condition that the request be made through the agency of an intelligent man.” Fuad Bey is more subtle than intelligent. Bahrein. 49. In 1920, at Ibn Saud’s personal request, the 5 per cent, ad valorem dues levied on all goods passing in transit through Bahrein to the mainland was reduced to 2 per cent., and a further concession was made in respect of goods transhipped from steamers direct into lighters bound for the mainland, on which no duty was to be charged. This concession was always unpopular in Bahrein, and in 1931 the second part of it was prejudiced by an agreement madk between the Bahrein State and the British India shipping company, to the effect that the company would refuse to accept any cargo for overside delivery in Bahrein Harbour, in consideration for an extension of free demurrage from the ruling three days to ten days on all cargo landed at Bahrein from their ships. Ibn Saud has not yet protested, but, in view of the probability that he will, and also on grounds of principle, the question was receiving consideration in March from the Government of India. A sir and the Yemen. 50. On the 13th March the Hejaz-Nejd Government communicated to the foreign representatives a copy of the treaty of the 15th December signed with the Yemen.' The text had previously been published in the kt Umm-al-Qura ” of the 26th February, copies of which were seen in Sana. It has been noticeable, however, to regular Hejazi readers of the Yemeni Imam’s newspaper, “ Imam,” that it has completely ignored the treaty. Moreover, when the Dutch Charge d’Affaires at Jedda, in tne course of a visit to Sana, from which he has recently returned, congratulated the Imam on being now linked in friendship with [bn Saud, the Imam laughed heartily at the idea of his having signed any treaty with Ibn Saud, and said that the only instrument negotiated had been a working agreement between the Amirs of Jizan and Medi, by which a modus vivendi had ’ been established on the frontier. 51. The situation in Asir and on the Yemeni frontier has been obscure. It is believed that some Asiri tribes revolted in the beginning of February against the Nejdi occupation, but that the revolt was crushed by Ibn Saud’s Amir Khalid- bin-Luwey, after more tribal fighting in the Najran district. The Bedouin Nejdi troops, however, were said to have but little stomach left for meeting the Asiri highlanders. Looting had become too dangerous. [7003] ^ ^ c 2V2 Chapter III.— Foreign Relations. British Empire. Complaint against His Majesty's Minister. 52. In immediate reaction to the manumission by the Legation of a slave claimed by Ibn Sand (see chapter VIII), the Hejaz-Nejd Government, on the 8th February, complained of Sir A. Ryan's behaviour, and stated, in etlect, that his retention in the post of His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda was not conducive to good relations. Sir A. Ryan had left Jedda on the 2nd February on a visit to Jerusalem (see paragraph 27); on the conclusion of the visit he proceeded to London. His Majesty’s Government answered the Hejazi complaint in full on the 21st March, and stated that, if it were not withdrawn, neither would Sir A. Ryan resume his duties as His Majesty's Minister at Jedda, nor would any other Minister of His Majesty’s service replace him. The Hejazi Government climbed down on the 5th April. His Majesty’s Minister remained in London to meet the Hejazi mission, with the intention of returning to Jedda by the end of May. Hejaz-Nejd Mission to London. 53. Ibn Saud chose this moment to announce a mission to the capitals of friendly countries, which may already have been in contemplation but had been kept remarkably dark. His Majesty 's Government were asked on the 24th March by the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London whether they would receive the Amir Feisal, accompanied by Fuad Bey Hamza, in May. They replied that their answer must depend on the Hejazi Government's action regarding their note of complaint against Sir A. Ryan. On the 8th April they were informed that His Majesty's Government would be glad to receive their mission. It sailed from Jedda on the 12th April to visit Rome, Geneva, Paris, London, The Hague, Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, Angora, Tehran and Bagdad. Before they left, Fuad Bey Hamza showed Mr. Hope Gill their programme of dates. They were due in Paris on the 31st April. On being told that might not be a good day, Fuad Bey changed it to the 1st May, but when he heard of May Day and Communists and unemployed and what-all, not to mention the French elections, he recoiled into April. Fuad is 33, Feisal 27. These neophytes are escorted by an A.D.C. done up in a uniform to taste, and a negro attendant who looks like a slave. It is understood that they have enough money with them. Other Matters. 54. Relations during the last three months were overshadowed in January by the slave incident and clouded for the remainder by the complaints against Sir A. Ryan. They were enlivened somewhat locally in March by pilgrimage difficulties, which are recounted in chapter VII. In his series of interviews held in January with the Hejazi Under-Secretary, His Majesty's Minister covered a good deal of other ground, notably in connexion with debts, the coming pilgrimage, Transjordan, Persian Gulf questions and Colonel Biscoe’s visit, and emergency landing-grounds on the Hasa Coast. None of the debts owing to His Majesty's Government, the Government of India and other British creditors were, of course, paid. Transjordan affairs have been dealt with in paragraphs 25- 38, Persian Gulf questions in paragraphs 41-49, and the landing grounds in chapter IV. International. International Sanitary System. 55. After mature consideration of the advice given them last July (July- August report, paragraph 50), the Hejazi Government acceded in March to the Rome Convention of 1907. Paris Pact. 56. They also adhered, in February, to the Kellogg Pact, notifying the American Government through the United States Ambassador in London.Disarmament Conference. 57. The Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London was delegated in January to represent his Government at Geneva. A lengthy memorandum giving information on the armaments of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies was circulated to the conference on the 8th February, followed on the 24th by a memorandum by the 4^ Hejazi delegation notifying his views as to the need and manner of disarming the world. Congresses. 58. His Majesty’s Government's invitation to attend the hifth Inter national Congress of Local Authorities (July-August report, paragraph 54) was accepted by the Hejaz-Nejd Government in January, their Minister in London being deputed to represent them. An invitation to attend the London Inter national Congress on commercial education was apologetically declined. Italy. 59 A treaty of friendship with Italy and a commercial agreement were at length signed on the 10th February, after negotiations lasting two years. The Italian draft anti-slave trade clause has been dropped {cf. November-December report, paragraph 47). Germany. 60 M. de Haas reassumed charge of his consulate on the 23rd March. The Netherlands. 61. M. Adriaanse left Jedda on the 7th March on a brief visit to the Yemen to present Queen Wilhelmina’s reply to a letter of greeting, sent to her last year by the Imam Yahya on the occasion of M. van der Meulen’s visit to Sana (May- June report,, paragraph 46). No other political significance is attached to this visit. 62. A M. van Leeuwen, erstwhile of the Netherlands Trading Society, was engaged in March by the Hejaz-Nejd Government as financial adviser for a year at £2,000 (see paragraph 11 above). Soviet Russia. 63. The Soviet Charge d'Affaires has presented the Amir Feisal with 5 rifles of a pattern known as “ Turki ” and apparently much prized by Bedouin. He was also discovered recently holding a small arms exhibition in his Legation. No arms are known to have been ordered. 64. The last consignment of Soviet benzine, 30,000 cases, w T as landed at Jedda in February in completion of the contract of last summer (July-August report, paragraph 63). Payment is understood to have been relegated to item 5 of the k ‘ budget. ' Turkey. 65. On the 28th January the Turkish Ambassador called on His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to tell him that the Turkish Government had been asked by the Hejazi Government to lend pilots and mechanics for the development of their air service and to send a military mission to give similar help to the Hejazi army. Ferit Bey said that, before replying to this request, the Turkish Government, having regard to their very friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government, desired to inform them of the request and to consult them about it. He was thanked for his communication and subsequently told that His Majesty’s Government saw no reason why the Turkish Government should not accede to the Hejazi Government's request. This request follows upon Ibn Saud's failure to obtain British personnel (see November- December report, paragraph 59). There is no sign as yet of the arrival of any Turkish personnel or mission.14 Egypt. 66. At the end of 1931 the Egyptian Prime Minister informed His Majesty's representative at Cairo that Egypt now had a consular representative of some ability at Jedda, and that, according to this official’s reports, the difficulties which stood in the way of establishing friendly and regular relations were not insoluble. Sidky Pasha added that he was occupying himself with the f matter, with the purpose and in the hope of solving the difficulties, which were of a religious as well as of a political order. Hafiz Amer Bey, however, who went on leave of absence last September, has not yet returned to Jedda, and nothing is known locally either of any progress in Egypto-Hejazi relations or of the Egyptian consul’s movements. Iraq. 67. Dr. Naji-al-Asil, King Feisal’s first diplomatic representative at the Court of King Ibn Sand, arrived in Jedda on the 14th February with a wife (not visible) and family, and a secretary and clerk. He was greeted as Iraqi Charge d Affaires and consul-general by the Viceroy, but his letters of credence were not accepted; they named him specifically to Mecca instead of to Jedda. His luggage and His note-paper bore the same address (see paragraph 40 of the report for September-October). There has apparently been either a misunderstanding on the part of Nuri Pasha, who seems convinced that Ibn Saud agreed with him last March that Mecca should be the seat of the new Legation, for reasons of special consideration for his brother Feisal, or else Ibn Saud did indeed agree to the proposal; but his Lnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, who was ill and absent at the time, must have managed on his return to make him go back on his decision and omitted to mention it to the Iraqis. Whatever the cause, the effect was distinctly disagreeable to Dr. Naji, who has taken his anomalous position very philosophically, however, has failed as yet to secure an honourable compromise, and has settled down in Jedda to await results. He learned at the end of March that King Feisal would send a personal message by special courier to Ibn Saud, appealing to him to honour his bond. The incident‘is an ill-omen for independent Iraq-Nedji relations. Dr. Naji has shown himself very friendly disposed to the Legation, which he often visits for advice and to exchange information. Afghanistan. 68. Ahmad Shah Khan, Minister of Court and cousin of King Nadir Shah, arrived on pilgrimage on the 17th March, and with the further objects of negotiating a treaty with Ibn Saud and of building an Afghan pilgrim hostel at Mecca which should redound to the credit of the Afghan King. Having brought very little money, he is having difficulty with this objective. Nothing definite is yet known of the course of the negotiations, but there are indications of a deplorable atmosphere of suspicion. United States of America. 69. Mr. Crane’s American engineer left for the Yemen on the 7th March, after making an extensive prospecting tour in the Hejaz and Nejd, and detailed recommendations to Ibn Saud for the development of his wealth by the purchase of American machinery and the engagement of American mining experts (see paragraph 14 above). He may return shortly to press his suit, which is not thought to please the King, however. Poland. 70. In February a Polish professor of Chinese culture, who claimed to speak forty languages and to live in Cairo with a tubercular wife, visited Jedda from Egypt. From the language which he held on various occasions, it was understood that his object was primarily to obtain payment from the Heiazi Government of something over 2 million zlote in respect of the Polish arms delivered in 1930 (August 1930 report, paragraph 15). A secondary object seemed to be to discover what medical and sanitary arrangements the Heiazis were making for the pilgrimage, with discretion, if these were reassuring, to use the prospect of persuading a few score Polish Moslems to perform pilgrimage as an inducement to the Hejazi Government to pay him the desired £50,000 gold.It seems that the visit was inspired by the Polish Charge d Affaires at Cairo. The professor left disappointed about equally with Hejazi science and Hejazi finance. Chapter IV .—Air Matters. Hejaz Air Force. 71. This invisible body figures in the Hejaz-Nejd communication to the Disarmament Conference, dated the 24th January, as comprising 11 officers and 150 men. The Ilejazi Government's approach to the Turkish Government for the loan of ^pilots and mechanics has been reported in paragraph 65. 72. The same memorandum gives the number of Hejazi aeroplanes as nine. Only two of these are capable of flying to-day. Two more might fly after an overhaul and some rebuilding; the other five will never fly again. A rab A eronautical Society. 73. A report on the first year's working published in March does not make encouraging reading. £2,000 was subscribed, but not paid. Happily, the society holds promissory notes from all subscribers, and expenditure was nil. In spite of difficulties the society registered its determination to carry on. A new 7 appeal for support is to be issued, rich pilgrims are to be asked to contribute, and propa ganda is to be set on foot. Fuad Bey Hamza is vice-president. Emergency Landing Grounds. 74. On the 24th January His Majesty’s Minister took up with the Under secretary for Foreign Affairs the question of the provision of emergency landing- grounds on the Hasa coast for aircraft in distress on the Persian Gulf route, in accordance w 7 ith His Majesty’s Government’s instructions of the 2nd December (November-December report, paragraph 60). He went very fully and tactfully into the matter but found Fuad Bey very sticky. It was evident that he personally disliked the whole idea and would like to see Ibn Sand drive a hard bargain, should he agree to His Majesty's Government's request. Sir A. Ryan, in reporting the interview on the 25th January, opined that it was a matter in which Ibn Saucl might be more amenable to a direct appeal, but unfortunately there was no prospect of his visiting Jedda before April at soonest. 75. On almost the same day the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf mentioned the same matter to Ibn Sand himself at Hufuf. The King said that he w 7 as prepared to consider it sympathetically. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin shortly afterwards informed Colonel Biscoe that Ibn Saud was now ready to afford any facilities asked for on islands, but not on the mainland, for fear of incidents with Bedouin. Certain islands w 7 ere discussed and Colonel Biscoe suggested to His Majesty's Government that the matter should now be taken up officially. A Rangoon flying-boat which took refuge at Jinna Island in mid-January reported that a landing-ground was already marked out and fit for use and staffed wdth clerks complete w 7 ith customs forms in Arabic and English for the use of visiting pilots. Only formal permission to use the ground now seemed required, but with the King’s disappearance again into Nejd and in face of Fuad Hamza’s malign influence at the seat of Government, no favourable occasion occurred of pursuing the matter. Aerial Trespass. 76. Squadron-Leader Warhurton w 7 as lost in the desert west of Rutba Wells in early January, and in order to forestall complaints of aerial trespass over his territory, Ibn Saud w 7 as formally asked for aerial hospitality for the search patrol. This was readily accorded and every assistance promised. Meanwhile, the missing machine was found in Iraq. Ibn Saud was thanked. 77 In mid-January a Rangoon flying-boat forced-landed at Jinna Island in the Persian Gulf. The Hejaz-Nejd Government were informed and the hope was expressed that there w 7 as no objection to the necessary relief measures. They replied that, as a humane duty, they had no objection. Meanwhile, a new 7 engine was fitted and all at Jinna w 7 ere very courteous; the Hejazi Government w^ere thanked. 78. The Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London informed His Majesty’s Govern ment late in February that a British machine had flowm over Qaryat al Milh wdthout permission on the 27th or 28th January, but he did not press the point, nor was the Legation troubled.79. In March, however, the Hejazi Government weighed in with a formal protest against three cases of alleged aerial trespass by British aircraft in the same district on the 22nd and 23rd February and the 3rd March. The matter was referred for enquiry. Chapter V.— Military Matters. General. 80. Ibn Saud is his own Minister for War and Commander-in-Chief. It is true that the “ Council of Ministers ” decree, annexed, goes out of its way to state that the President of the Council controls the Military Departments, but this constitutional change has been denied by a responsible member of the Government. Either he or the decree is wrong, probably the latter. The Military Departments comprise a Directorate of Military Affairs (regulars) under an ex-Turkish corporal, Hamdi Bey; a camel-corps (irregulars) under a Qaid al Hijan; and Sheikh Abdullah Suieiman, who is also Director-General of Finance and King’s Comptroller, as Quartermaster-General and Master of Ordnance. A rmed Forces. 81. The Hejaz-Nejd memorandum of the 24th January communicated to the Disarmament Conference at Geneva contained a lengthy dissertation on the Arabian Peninsula. It may be summed up in the opening words of section 8 : “ The natural and social conditions of this country are so extraordinary that they may be regarded as peculiar to it. This also applies to the military organisation. The following tables were annexed :— Table I.— Total A rmed Forces. Number of men ... ... ••• 43,437 Number of officers ... ... •• 734 Explanatory Notes. (1) The armed forces consist of :— (a) Police, 33 officers and 896 men.

If confronted with these figures, Ibn Saud would no doubt readily aver that Neid pays the difference as senior military partner in the dual kingdom. This might be true, but again it might not. There is no means of telling. This at least can be said, that the bulky figure of “£633,950—Other categories ” deserves to be regarded with grave suspicion. Northern Hejaz and Frontier. 83. The northern Amirates continued in a bad way, lacking pay and food for the men and petrol and spare parts for the cars. The Amir of Tabuk, however, was able to raid and loot the Beni Atiya in February, as described in paragraph 36, an operation which relieved his garrison’s distress. 84. According to Transjordan information, Hejazi military and police forces in March were distributed as follows :— Military. Police. Camel Corps. Guns. Military Cars. Location. Officers. Men. Officers. Men. Field Guns. Machine Guns. Mecca 3 60 8 145 300 6 6 12 Taif 1 19 1 35 85 1 1 5 J edda 4 50 9 119 75 8 9 7 Medina 1 34 7 114 125 4 3 10 Yanbu’ .. .. .. 1 10 2 18 25 1 1 1 Wejh 1 10 1 15 42 1 1 2 Tabuk 2 24 1 15 40 1 6 Skaka # # 1 14 100 10 Qaf (under Ibn Zeyd, Tribal Control Officer) .. • • • 50 50 .. .. 6 Totals .. 13 207 30 525 842 22 21 59 Notes.

[7003]mmm pp — —.j ■ 18 South (A sir). 86. Reference to tribal unrest has been made in paragraph 51, but the frontier appears to have been quiet. The Nejdi reinforcements sent to Jizan last September (Septernber-October report, paragraph 45) returned in March by sea, in dhows. Chapter VI .—Naval Matters. 87. Lieut-Commander A. R. Farquhar, D.S.C., R.N., visited Jedda in H.M.S. “ Penzance ' on the 28th January. The visit happened to coincide with the manumission by the Legation of a slave claimed by Ibn Saud and proved most timely for his embarkation, under somewhat unusual circumstances, and repatriation to Africa (see chapter VIII). His Majesty’s Minister left Jedda on the 2nd February in H.M.S. “Penzance” for Port Sudan, on his way to Jerusalem. 88. The French despatch-vessel “ Dunkerque ” visited Jedda from the 24th to the 28th March, after paying short visits to Wejh and Yanbu. 89. The Italian minelayer “ Azio ’ visited Jedda from the 9th to the 11th February, for the occasion of the signing of the Italo-Hejazi treaty. Chapter VII.— Pilgrimage. G eneral. 90. By the end of March some 20,000 pilgrims had landed at Jedda, of whom 8,000 were Indians. Pilgrimage Day was due to fall on Friday, the 15th April, and another 5,000 oversea pilgrims were expected to arrive for it. Last year’s figures were 40,000 in all from oversea. Indian. 91. Hejazis live on Indians, amongst others. They felt the pinch of a lean season last year and their appetite has recently been sharp. The Hejazi Government have equally suffered the pinch and their practice has become all the sharper. They are an unpleasant species at the best of times; but when, as during the past three months, they begin to make their annual meal in lairs which they call the Holy Sanctuaries, they offend the senses and exercise the mind of/interested observers. 92. Last summer they published an official tariff of dues for the 1932 pilgrimage which advertised a reduction of mutawwifs’ fees. It was scaled in $ piastres and rupees. They broadcast it through India and beyond in a propa ganda pamphlet, entitled “Friday Pilgrimage,” promising the fall of Hajj Day on Friday, the 15th April, with consequential sevenfold blessing that day upon God’s Guests. (It may be noted in parenthesis that it was not the Prophet but the shop and lodging-house keepers of Mecca who invented this windfall, 200 years later.) Indian pilgrims were thus led to believe that the 1932 pilgrimage would cost less than that of 1931 and be seven times as valuable. This was good business. 93. On the basis of the official tariff and other necessary expenditure in the Hejaz, the Legation estimated the total cost of pilgrimage in 1932 to be not less than 800 rupees, and the Government of India were so informed. When the sterling and rupee left gold in the autumn, however, the Hejazi Government made no sign. They maintained a fictitious “official ” parity with gold, but in practice the Saudi riyal, which contains 11 Miri piastres, had long ago parted from gold, and stood at the end of 1931 at 17J to the £ gold, parity being 10. There were thus grounds for belief that pilgrims would be able to buy piastres at the market rate and that fees scaled in rupees would be accepted in rupees. But as soon as the first Indian pilgrims landed at Jedda on the 30th December they found that they were charged all dues and fees, including those in rupees, on a gold basis, and were also charged for items which did not figure in the official tariffs at all. They found, in effect, that expenses in the Hejaz were some 40 per cent, higher this year than last. The majority held quite insufficient funds. 94. There followed a series of representations by the Legation and of dilatory, evasive and contradictory statements by the Hejazi Government.19 Pilgrims were first told to apply to the local Government at Jedda, who had been instructed to investigate and report. The obvious conclusion was that neither gold basis nor overcharges had been authorised by the Hejazi Government. On the 17th January, however, the latter answered His Majesty’s Minister’s note of the 2nd January with a notification that the tariff was fixed on a gold basis and charges must be collected accordingly. The Legation at once informed the Government of India, who issued a press communique on the 23rd January warning pilgrims of the change and advising them to estimate the total cost of pilgrimage at 1,100 rupees. 95. The Hejazi Government and others commercially interested in pilgrims made every endeavour in India, through the press and otherwise, to discredit the Government of India’s advice. They succeeded in inducing the majority of pilgrims yet to come that 750, or even 500, rupees would suffice. As a result, several thousand more Indians arrived in Jedda with insufficient means. On discovering their position, they clamoured for redress and help from the Legation, but were told that they were themselves largely to blame for trusting the Hejazi Government and agencies rather than their own Government, and were shown the Government of India communique, together with a telegram of the 10th March sent in clear English, in which His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires described their position to the Government of India, stressed the responsibility of the Hejazi Government for their distress, and asked that the facts be brought to the notice of all intending pilgrims still to come, so that they might come with their eyes open, expecting neither financial assistance from the Legation nor any remission of dues from those who have to live on pilgrims. The Government of India therefore issued a second communique on the 16th March based on this telegram. There was a noticeable falling off in the numbers of pilgrims embarked thereafter, the last two or three ships arriving almost empty at Jedda. 96. It is unnecessary to recount the slipshod prevarications of the Hejazi Government throughout March. They turned chiefly on the official maximum transport charges, which had long been promised, were not made known until the 3rd March, and were then invariably exceeded, but were officially raised by the Government to cover the excesses as often as these were brought to notice by the Legation. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires obtained an oral promise from the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs on the 19th March that the maxima would not again be raised, and endeavoured to obtain from the Hejazi Govern ment an agreed copy of the charges as finally fixed. This was withheld and the promise went for nothing. Transport conditions and charges have remained chaotic. The experience of the last three months makes it imperative to devise means before the next pilgrimage of curbing the appetite of this shamelessly hungry Government. Nigerian. 97. The desiderata referred to in paragraph 72 of the last report were obtained, thanks to the Sudan Government’s negotiations with the Khedivial Mail Line Company, concluded in January. The company agreed to issue only return tickets and all the year round, to pilgrims leaving Suakin, with two unobjectionable provisos, and they further agreed unofficially to consider such tickets valid up to a maximum of two years—a most satisfactory result. 98. The repatriation of 912 destitute Nigerian pilgrims was completed on the 29th March (see November-December report, paragraphs 69 to 71). 581 were sent to Massawa and 331 to Suakin. The pro-consul at Jedda felt much relieved at the conclusion of this arduous task. Somali. 99. Recommendations were made by the Legation in March to Sheikh and Aden with a view to improving the control of the Somali pilgrimage. » Chapter VIII.— Slavery. Bakhit Incident. 100. Two male slaves, Nigerian and French Sudani by origin, had escaped towards the end of December from Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s house at Mecca and taken refuge in the Legation. It was intended to manumit them in the [70031 e20 r . normal way and send them to Port Sudan on the 26th December. The local authorities, however, under instructions from Mecca, refused to grant the necessary papers to leave the country, on the ground that they were Royal slaves. His Majesty's Minister made strong representations to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by telephone on the 24th December, and the opposition to the Nigerian’s departure was withdrawn. He claimed with apparent truth to have come on ^ pilgrimage in 1930 or 1931, and to have been sold by his master, or companion, into slavery. His case seemed thus to fall under article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda regarding the suppression of slave trade. He was consequently repatriated as intended, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in a note of the 26th December admitting that he was a free person wrongfully enslaved. 101. The Hejazi Government asked, however, that Bakhit, the other slave, should be handed over to the local authorities as being a Royal slave. They stated that the fact of his having been with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman was immaterial, as the latter bought all the King's slaves. Bakhit was therefore retained in the Legation and personally questioned by His Majesty’s Minister. He gave a straightforward and convincing story of having been brought from Africa as a child, at pilgrimage time, captured by Bedouin outside Jedda, sold in the Yemen, sent many years later to Medina, taken when the city fell to Ibn Sand's son, sent by him to Ibn Sand’s cousin Ibn Musa’id, and by him to Abdullah Suleiman eighteen months ago. He had had nothing to do with the King. Copies of His Majesty’s Minister’s questionnaire and the man’s replies were sent to the Hejazi Government on the 31st December. 102. The case developed during January on acute lines which it is unnecessary to describe in detail. The Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London made representations to the Foreign Office. His Majesty’s Minister had a series of patient interviews with the Hejazi Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in a sustained effort to find a compromise. Fuad Hamza, however, was uncom promising, became heated, and eventually lost his head. There seems little reason to doubt that, once armed wdth Ibn Saud’s claim to have the slave returned, he made no further reference, or inadequate reference, of the course of the affair to the King, who was at Hufuf, with the result that a deadlock was reached. 103. His Majesty's Government, who were kept fully informed by His Majesty's Minister by telegraph, stated on the 27th January that the matter was one of very great importance on which they could not yield. They instructed Sir A. Ryan so to inform the Hejazi Government and promptly to arrange with the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, to embark Bakhit in H.M.S. “ Penzance.' They added that the matter was so important that, had ' Penzance not happened to be at Jedda, they would have asked the Admiralty to send a ship for the purpose. They realised that the embarkation might present practical difficulties, but they gave Sir A. Ryan fullest discretion. His Majesty’s Minister accordingly informed the Hejazi Government on the 28th January of His Majesty's Government's views and their express instructions, which, he added, he was taking the necessary steps to carry out without delay. He asked that the local authorities be informed. 104. After consultation with Commander Farquhar, it was decided to leave the process of embarkation to he carried out on the following afternoon by the Legation staff, openly from the quay in the Legation launch. If and when this attempt failed owing to phvsical or armed opposition, it would he necessary to consider the need for naval co-operation. The next day was decided upon in order to give the TIeiazi Government time to communicate by wireless with the King. But they telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister the same evening, immediately on receipt of his note, that they would never agree to the departure of the slave. Sir A. Ryan telegraphed back the following morning that he was sending Bakhit to the sloop that day. 105 The man was duly embarked in the afternoon without difficulty, the doubled Nejdi guard on the quay making no attempt to intervene until too late, when the launch was already under weigh; then they made a futile rush to the water’s edge and stood there shouting and gesticulating. It was later learned that Fuad Hamza, who is no ordinary Under-Secretarv for Foreign Affairs, had himself issued standing orders to the police to shoot Bakhit on sight outside the Legation, and particular instructions, in the attempt to embark him. to oppose Sir A. Ryan if he accompanied the slave in person, without, however, using physical force in the last resort; but if it were Captain Sea.ger (who usually dealswith slaves), to resist him by every means at their command. Happily it was Itamadhan and the guard failed to adjust their wits in time to the arrival of Mr. Hope Gill, followed by the slave, flanked by Captain Seager who engaged the passport officials, and with Mr. Wikeley as rearguard in case an attempt was made to take the man from behind. The Nejdi commanding the guard was summoned to Mecca and imprisoned. 106. The incident delighted Jedda, whose population were only sorry that a landing party had not been used to do the thing in style, but it had a deplorable effect on Ibn Saud's temper which could certainly have been avoided had Fuad Bey Hamza kept his head. The general opinion was that, had the King been kept fully informed, he would undoubtedly have made a large gesture at the last moment, faute de mieux, and given the slave to Sir A. Ryan, thereby salving some prestige. If he was kept fully informed, his message of the previous day, the 28th January, to His Majesty’s Government through Colonel Biscoe was meaningless (see paragraph 44 above); if he was not. his desire for an intelligent channel of communication would be easily gratified by his replacement of Fuad Hamza by someone intelligent. Other Slaves. 107. Two other male slaves took refuge in the Legation in January and were manumitted and repatriated to Africa early in February, without difficulty. A woman who had been a slave and feared re-enslavement, and a fourth male slave, who took refuge in the Legation in February and was manumitted, were also repatriated. Three slaves who escaped from the Amir Feisal's retinue when he visited Jedda in February, were expected to attempt to reach the Legation, and the local authorities took elaborate precautions to prevent and find them. They apparently made good their escape by other means and were not found. Chapter IX.— Miscellaneous. V isitors. 108. Lady Dorothy Mills, known to some as k ‘ Uneaten and Unbeaten,” explored Jedda from the 12th to the 15th January, and was accommodated in the Legation. Prominent pilgrims will be noted in the next report. Deportations. 109. Mubarik Ali was deported on the 25th January by the Hejazi Government in response to the Legation’s request (see November-December report, paragraph 80). A misguided disciple named Mirza Suleiman Ahmed was made to accompany him. Staff. 110. His Majesty’s Minister left Jedda on the 2nd February in H.M.S. “ Penzance ” for Port Sudan on an official visit to Jerusalem, to discuss Transjordan matters with His Majesty’s High Commissioner. Mr. Hope Gill became Charge d 1 ’Affaires. The Indian vice-consul, Munshi Ihsanullah, received the well-merited title of Khan Bahadur on the 1st January. The Malay pilgrimage officer returned to Jedda for the season on the 28th February. e 2 [7003]f 22 Annex “ A to Enclosure. (Translation.)

THE occasion is taken of repeating the information that the spellin “ Jedda ' is consecrated by Foreign Office usage. It is, moreover, convenient that place where His Majesty’s Government maintain a Legation should be known in 6309 [408 h—3] b bo cS2 official English by a fixed name. Some other posts still seem to find it difficult to reconcile the spelling “Jedda” with their philological principles. If these can finally be overcome, it will be much appreciated at Jedda. (Confidential.) Ibn Saud. I.— Internal Affairs. 1 1 HE King continued in Riadh throughout November and December, but he was no longer able to brood on his personal troubles; there came home to roost in Nejd the troublesome offspring of union with the Hejaz. The last two reports have described the process of further disintegration which the already rotten state of the Hejaz passed through after Ibn Saud's withdrawal into Nejd in June. In the first days of November he had before him at Riadh a memorandum on the situation drawn up by his son Feisal, the Viceroy, and Fuad Bey Hamza, his Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. These had at length revolted against the virtual dictatorship of his henchman and Director-General of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who had to go to Riadh to give his own account of his stewardship. The memorandum revealed dissension in the Government of the Ilejaz amounting to deadlock and a critical state of financial chaos. It prescribed two remedies which His Majesty had never yet been able to stomach, a budget and a ‘‘ Cabinet.' He now, however, accepted both, with what difficulty is not known, and sent his chief political adviser, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, to Jedda with a proclamation and to concert financial measures with Fuad Hamza. Abdullah Suleiman he retained in Nejd until the trouble should blow over. Reforms. 2. On the 3rd November the Hejaz was shocked by the news that, by direct order of the King, the Treasury and all its branches were to be closed and the tills locked, and that no payments, however small, were to be made pending further instructions. This was the first sign of Ibn Sand's reaction to the situation. Its inconveniences were manifold, for all daily-paid public and municipal work at once ceased, and the Quarantine Department, for instance, had to borrow fuel for its launch in order to function at all. 3. Late on the 12th November, Yusuf Yasin arrived post-haste in Jedda, where the Amir Feisal and Fuad Hamza were awaiting him to learn the King's decisions. On the following morning His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires was invited to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to receive the welcome news of financial and constitutional reform. The latter, he was given to understand, was not yet elaborated, but the King had conceded the principle of a Council of Ministers on whom would rest joint responsibility for government in addition to individual responsibility for their departments. The resulting decree, which was not published until January, falls to be considered in the next report. As to financial reform, Yusuf Yasin and Fuad Hamza were in a position to announce the establishment of a budget. 4. They told Mr. Hope Gill in confidence that the revenue would be in future apportioned under four headings :— 35 per cent., official salaries, intended to cover all normal costs of administration; 25 per cent., indebtedness, to cover all arrears of salaries as well as the Government's internal and external debt; 15 per cent., reserve (a novelty with all the attraction of a pot of • honey); and 25 per cent., extraordinary expenses, intended to ensure the comfort and health of pilgrims and to develop the country’s hidden resources. Even approximate figures of estimated revenue were not yet available but it had been calculated that current indebtedness could be met in about two years There Sheikh lusuf's information stopped, and he left to say his pravers Nevertheless, it was gratifying to learn of even the birth of a budget. ' ■ ' 5. On the same day the Umm-al-Qura published a long proclamation by the King to his people announcing the information contained in the precedlno- paragraph, but omitting the percentages, establishing the principle that all creditors must stand on an equal footing, and forecasting with pious hope the beneficial results that would flow from the policy of retrenchment and development3 # which had now l&gt;een adopted. Further communiques published in subsequent- issues announced the King s commands to reduce expenditure, to select a Reorganisation Committee, to create a Treasury Department, and to appoint a Treasurer, and, meanwhile, to employ the Director-General of Finance and the Vice-President of the Hejaz Legislative Assembly in an inspectional tour of ^the other side of Nejd (whence they had not returned by the end of December). The King’s personal expenditure was also to be reduced, for which the “ Umm-al-Qura gave him loyal praise. 6. Although the budget, or what passes in this country as a budget, was not published until the 15th January, it may conveniently be dealt wdth here. It took the form of a badly worded decree in six articles and a list of items of expenditure which do not add up correctly; a translation is attached as an appendix to this report. The budget thus resolves itself into an estimate of expenditure under various heads, which do not seem to correspond with the percentage allotments previously communicated. The decree states that the revenue equals this expenditure, but no detail is given and no mention is made of the reserve fund. Nor is it stated whether the budget applies to the Hejaz only or to the whole of Ibn Baud’s dominions. As soon as budgetary reform was announced, it was generally held to have come too late. Now that the details have been published, pessimism is confirmed. Fuad Bey himself seems to have no illusions as to the uncertainty of the revenue prospects. 7. One other point emerging from the budget discussions has been that the financial capital will in future be Jedda instead of Mecca. The idea of supplementing the reform by the employment of a European financial adviser is still canvassed, and the post is said to have been offered to the local manager of the Dutch Bank, M. Jacobs, and also to another Dutchman, M. van Leeuwe. Nothing definite has transpired, however. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. £ The Amir Feisal, Viceroy and Minister, moved his Government and Department back to Mecca on the 6th November from Taif, whither he had removed them on the 6th July for the summer. On the 7th November his Under secretary informed the foreign representatives that the Jedda office of the Ministry had been transferred (from the flat which it occupied in the offices of an I talian shipping agent and for which, incidentally, it has failed to pay the agreed rent) to a separate building of its own. This has meant nothing more than a welcome change of environment, which will make it no longer necessary for the Under-Secretary to speed his parting visitors through al fresco macaroni parties on the stairways. The new office, however, is just as vacant as the old. Personal contact with the foreign representatives at Jedda, which it had been hoped a year ago (December 1930 report, paragraph 1), would become more frequent, is as rare as ever, and heads of foreign missions are becoming restive and increasingly critical of their isolationist treatment. 9. Fuad Bey came to Jedda on the 29th October and left on the 3rd November. On the 1st he gave His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires a three-hour interview. He returned on the 7th to await the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who came on the 9th, signed a treaty with France on the 10th, and left on the 13th. They were joined on the 12th by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, hot-foot with the reforms from Riadh, and Mr. Hope Gill had a further interview with Fuad Bey, which was attended by the Sheikh. They both left Jedda on the 14th November. Yusuf Yasin returned to Riadh on the 2nd December, and Fuad Hamza, after a flying visit to Jedda on the 4th-6th December, followed him there on the 15th,' the day on which His Majesty’s Minister arrived. He was not seen again until January. Financial Situation. 10. The general financial position at the close of the year was as gloomy as the economic (see paragraph 17). The reform scheme, if it had not come too late, had no one capable of running it rationally. The Treasuier, for example, m a bankrupt of 35. Nor were the prospects of revenue brighter.’ A pilgrimage from overseas of 20,000, or half the number of the meagre 1931 pilgrimage, was all that could now be expected; and each year’s pilgrims were bringing less money. The customs revenues showed a continued decline, due to decreased [408 h—3] B *24 r pilgrimage and general depression. For the lunar year ended in June 1929 they were believed to have ranged round the million mark; for that ending next May they seem unlikely to exceed half a million sterling. With this decreased security, with increasing uncertainty as to the stability of the Saudian regime, and following on the breakdown of the negotiations with the Dutch Bank (July-August report. cj\ paragraph 9), the prospects of a development loan being obtained on commercial lines from any European country have receded out of sight. Relations with Soviet Russia, which alone might engage in trade, or even finance, on uneconomic lines, remained obscure. A consignment of 42,000 cases of Russian kerosene arrived at Yanbu’ and Jedda on the 26th November in fulfilment of the July contract (July-August report, paragraph 10), and Russian matches were also on sale; but big business between the two Governments seemed out of the question. The “ prohibition ' of Soviet merchandise was maintained. 11. The sterling crisis of September had at first no direct effect on the currency of the Hejaz, which is based on the gold sovereign actually in circulation and not on sterling as such. By November, however, one noticeable effect became evident in the lessened volume of gold in circulation, probably owing to hoarding and to heavy purchases of gold made by the local Dutch bank, English and Egyptian notes came into increasing use, the former possibly on account of the Soviet Legation, which has no local banking account and meets its liabilities with English bank-notes imported by bag. 12. The silver riyal had been depreciating steadily since February and in the first fortnight of November sank to a rate which fluctuated between 18 and 20 to the gold £. Attempts made by the King to bolster it up by popularising its use in Nejd, by the setting up of a net-work of retail stalls, stocked with “ borrowed ” Hejazi goods, in which riyals alone were accepted, were frustrated by the attitude of the Nejdi merchants, who complained that the riyal was useless to them for transactions in Koweit and Bahrein, and refused to deal in them. The gold value of the riyal in Nejd is said to have been as low as 30. In the Hejaz the Government themselves had long since ceased to attach any value to the so-called “official” rate of 10 riyals =£1 gold, except in so far as they secured their acceptance at this rate when making payments wherever they could. Early in October they had made their first definite admission that the riyal had depreciated by insisting that customs dues, which are fixed in piastres Miri at the rate of 110 piastres Miri = 10 riyals = £l gold, should be paid either in gold or by an equivalent number of riyals at the market, as opposed to the official, rate. This rule was now extended to other classes of payments. In the uncertainty which followed the departure of Abdullah Suleiman to Riadh (September-October report, paragraph 10), the riyal seemed likely to fall to the value of its silver content, about 24 to the gold £. By the end of December, however, under the influence of the events described in the preceding para graphs, it had recovered to about 17^ and 12^ to the gold and paper £ respectively. 13. No Government indebtedness was reduced during November and December, with the notable exception that the Eastern Telegraph Company received three remittances, totalling some £1,450, in respect of their long- outstanding account. Despite this, the debit Hejazi account amounted to some £2,000 at the end of December. Official salaries were for the most part six months in arrear on the 12th December, from which date the budget is to operate. It is, however, the declared intention of the Government to lump these arrears with the general floating debt, which it is hoped to pay off in the next two years. In face of the penury of all classes of officials, this arrangement has not made any wide appeal. 14. Throughout the autumn the Legation received a stream of complaints from British and British-protected motor-car drivers, mostly Somalis, who had been attracted to the country during the 1931 pilgrimage season by the high wages offered by certain Government-controlled motor companies, but who, on being- discharged after the season, had been quite unable to obtain the balances due to them. The claims, where they appeared genuine, were forwarded to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but, although the Government’s liability was not contested, no claim was settled up till the end of the year, and in only two cases were the men able to make even sacrificial arrangements with the companies. In most cases the drivers were reduced to beggary and had to be repatriated by the Legation.a r 15. The Government of India debt is dealt with in paragraph 44, and that due to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. in paragraph 45. 10. In November His Majesty’s Government were approached by the Ottoman Debt Council with the proposal that they, in conjunction with the s . other Government signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne, should make joint representations to the Hejaz-Nejd Government in the matter of the shares of the Ottoman Public Debt due by the latter. It appeared that the Hejaz-Nejd Government, invited by the council to settle their quota of the debt, had replied on the 29th September refusing point-blank to recognise any responsibility or to take any action in the matter. This can hardly be regarded as surprising. His Majesty’s Government had earlier in the year been approached by the French Government with a similar proposal of the council in respect of the European Governments, who were similarly debtors, and had replied that, while they agreed in principle to the proposal, they considered the moment inopportune for the purpose. No further action was accordingly taken in this instance, a formal acknowledgment only being sent to the Council. Economic Situation. 17. It was generally felt, at the end of the year, that the economic situation &lt;jould hardly have been worse. The merchants of Jedda and Mecca had, for the past tw T o years, been increasingly hard hit, not only by trade depression, but by the ever-growing volume of forced loans, without material prospect of repayment, extorted from them by the Government in the guise of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. To this was now added the uncertainty produced by monetary crises elsewhere. Prices of imported goods had risen considerably; and as most of the necessaries of life are imported, living was appreciably dearer. Amongst the tribes, particularly in the Northern Hejaz. the utmost misery was reported. Their live stock, especially camels, have been seriously depleted by Government requisitions for military purposes, and they have been compelled by necessity to sell off much of what remained at heavy losses. Tales of famine were rife, although stories of Bedouin dying of starvation by the hundred were doubtless exaggerated. It became impossible, however, to discount the continuous reports of hunger and increased mortality received from all sources and all directions. Economic Development. 18. Mr. Twitched has shown great activity. He first installed his American prospector, Mr. Moseley, near Taif, where he remained during November and December prospecting for gold, with results so far unknown. Mr. Twitched then resumed work on the Waziria Weds near Jedda (September-October report, paragraph 16). The American windmill pump was erected, and by mid-December was producing a regular flow of water, which at one time found its way through the old Turkish conduit to Jedda. His success stopped there, for the conduit developed serious leaks, and the authorities shrank from the expenditure necessary to recondition it. By the end of December the hoped-for flow of water into the town had still not been attained. On the 15th December Mr. Twitched departed on an extended tour through Nejd under the King's auspices, to investigate potential supplies of minerals and water. His wife remained at dedda in charge of the windmill and certain water-seeking operations which had been started in the neighbourhood with the aid of a hand-drill. Customs Duties. 19. An official communique of the 10th November announced the levying as , . from that date of additional customs duties on benzine, kerosene, sugar, tobacco and cigarette paper, and matches. * * Wireless Installation. 20. No further instalments of payment were made by the Hejazi Govern ment (September-October report, paragraph 18), and at the end of December payment was five months in arrear. Some progress in installation was made. The Umm-al-Qura ” of the 20th November reported that the station at Hail was(5 now in communication with Taif, Mecca and Medina. This, however, would appear to be an original Turkish plant, since, according to Marconi's engineer,, no work at all had as yet been done at Hail. On the 4th December it was announced that the Tabuk station was working as from the 28th November, thus confirming a previous report. M. Boucicault, who had completed it, was at the end of December still detained through lack of stores and benzine at Tabuk, where famine was reported to be increasing. The main Riadh station had not been begun by the end of December, partly owing to the opposition of the Nejdi ulema,, who objected to wireless as an invention of the devil, and had to be silenced by a Royal harangue reinforced by a squad of soldiery. The old Turkish installation at Jauf has been removed to Skaka, the new headquarters of the district Amir. M. Boucicault had intended to erect a new Marconi station at Jauf, but it is learned that Ibn Saud now wants him to proceed to the Hasa first. There is a difference of opinion, however, as to who should pay his travelling expenses. Legislation. 21. His Majesty's Minister had in July drawn the attention of His Majesty's Government to a Hejazi regulation published the previous February, under the terms of which writs issued by foreign courts for use in the Hejaz had apparently to be legalised first by the British Legation at Jedda, and then by the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs, and had suggested that the seals and signatures of all courts or officials in British territory, which might be accepted for the purpose, should be communicated to him. The Government of India was requested by the India Office on the 4th November to act in this sense, and the Governments of certain Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories were similarly addressed by the Colonial Office on the 20th November. Com munications. 22. Early in November His Majesty's Charge d Affaires questioned the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs as to the reported proposal to start a motor- service on the old pilgrim route from Najaf to Medina (September-October report, paragraph 21). Fuad Bey confirmed that the Iraq Government had enquired as to the route from Najaf through Jauf and Taima to Medina, and had been told that it w r as impracticable for cars between Jauf and Taima on account of the soft sands of the Nafud desert. He added that the Hejaz-Nejd Government were now studying the possibilities of the old direct route, the “ Darb Zubeyda,' from Najaf through Hail to Medina; but that there was no truth in the report that the King would shortly travel to Hail to inaugurate it. 23. The £i Umm-al-Qura ” of the 11th November published a long article entitled “Moslem Routes.' Eight routes, it stated, were formerly used by pilgrims on their way to the Holy Cities, namely, the routes of Syria (from Damascus), of Egypt, of Aden, of San a, of Oman, of A1 Ahsa, of Basra, and of Bagdad (the Darb Zubeyda); but most of these had been abandoned of recent years in favour of the sea-routes to Jedda. The Government were now examining a project to open a motor-route from Iraq via Najaf, A1 Ruwun, and Jauf, an Iraqi company running motor-services as far as Jauf, and a Hejazi company running a corresponding service on from Jauf to Mecca and Medina. A route from Jauf to Hail and Medina was also being considered. Subsequent articles intimated that the Government had received many applications for permission to open a road from Syria to Jauf, which they were studying, and that over 2,000 pilgrims were expected this year to travel overland from Iraq, though it was not yet settled which route would be used. 24. The October number of the “ Oriente Moderno ” also mentioned the project of a motor-route from Syria and Iraq via Najaf, stating that Syrian, Persian and Iraqi pilgrims would be able to use it and thus escape the vexatious Syrian and Egyptian quarantine regulations. An Iraqi company would probably obtain the concession to run motor-services on the route, in preference to the British company which was said to be applying. The Hejaz Railway. 25. The Moslem Congress held at Jerusalem on the 6th to the 16th December formed a committee to study and report on the vexed question of the Hejaz:■ / Railway. The committee's report was neither accurate nor profound. The discussion of it was too inflamed to be serious. The following resolution was finally adopted :— “ After hearing the report of the committee on the Hejaz Railway and ^ perusing the documents relating thereto, the congress declares its resentment of the usurpation of Moslem property, which is essentially a Wakf. The congress should approach Islamic and other Governments in this regard, and should empower the Executive Committee to discuss other means for the recovery of this line.'’ 26. Ft remains to be seen what action, if any, Ibn Saud will take. Moslem Congress at Jerusalem. 27. On the 14th November the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, under urgent instructions from Ibn Saud, requested His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires to ascertain His Majesty's Government's attitude towards the proposed Moslem Congress. The Grand Mufti of Palestine, Fuad Bey said, had invited the Hejazi Government to send a representative and leading persons, like himself and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, to attend. He sti’essed the probable anti-British and patently anti-Saudi complexion of the conference, and said that the King did not know whether to stand aloof and suffer the consequences, or to send a representa tive to look after his interests. He did not like the agenda and was confused by the fact of receiving an invitation from a Palestinian Government official. So he relied on a lead from His Majesty's Government. 28. Fuad Bey was told on the 21st November, in reply, that His Majesty’s Urovernment regretted that they could not take the responsibility of advising Ibn Saud as to whether he should send delegates or not. He might, however, be glad to know that His Majesty's Government were in no way associated with the proposal to hold the congress, and that it had neither their encouragement nor support. Their attitude was one of detachment, excepting in so far as regarded any possible reaction on public security in Palestine. As for the Grand Mufti, he was no doubt acting as a religious dignitary and not as a Palestinian official. 29. A week later Fuad Bey was orally informed that, as a result of recent &lt;X)nversations between the High Commissioner for Palestine and the Grand Mufti. His Majesty's Government did not anticipate that political issues would be raised, or that the proceedings of the congress would cause embarrassment to Ibn Saud’s Government. Moreover, the Grand Mufti had given a specific assurance that the Caliphate question would not be raised. Fuad Bey expressed gratitude for this information. 30. In the event Ibn Saud sent no delegate, his “ Umm-al-Qura ” snubbed the congress (although Fuad Hamza sent a message of support), and the only questions raised at Jerusalem which appear to affect Ibn Saud were that of the Hejaz Railway, dealt with in paragraph 25 above; the proposal that a committee be appointed in each Moslem country to raise funds for the projected universitv at Jerusalem; and the circulation of a propaganda leaflet, entitled “ The Voice -of Mecca,” denouncing the Saudi regime. It may also be noted that the delegates visited the tomb of the late ex-King Hussein, and lunched with his son Abdullah. Wahhabi tendencies were displayed at the congress by Rashid Ridha, an Egyptian, but met with opposition from the rest. Security. 31. The only known case affecting internal security continued to be that of the Danish Moslem, Knud Holmboe (September-October report, paragraph 24). Although informed that the man had definitely not returned to Transjordan, and repeatedly pressed, unofficially, for more and accurate information^ Fuad Bey only replied that nothing was known of the affair.II. —Frontier Questions. Raiding. Transjordan. 32. The Hejazi Government have lately complained of the five following ^ raids, said to have been made from Transjordan into Nejd in December :— On the 1st December at Kalakh, twenty-five camels taken; On the 2nd December at Ra jm-an-Naam, sixteen camels taken; On the 8th December near Shinam, sixty camels taken; On the 8th December at Ar Rajaa, twenty-five camels taken; On the 14th December at Mudhaibia, a caravan taken and two men killed. No raid was complained of on the Transjordan side of the frontier during November and December. 33. Repercussions from the raid of the 28th September at Haj (not Hazim, nor Hazm) engaged attention. On the 2nd December the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs stated categorically that the victims, the Atun section of the Huweytat. were subjects of Ibn Saud. The Transjordan authorities, however, claimed them as Transjordan subjects, and during the rest of the month past correspondence was examined in an attempt to settle the question, but without final result. Glubb-Ibn Zeid Meetings. 34. No meeting was held, but preparations were made to hold one early in January. MacDonnell Investigation. 33. On the 28th November the Hejazi Government replied in these words to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires' request of the 6th October for the payment of the Hejazi share of the costs of the investigation :— “ The agreement, in accordance with the terms of which the arbitration took place, contained the proviso that each party should bear the expenses of the arbitration in proportion to the judgment given against it, but there was no ruling to meet the case of no judgment being given against either party My Government are surprised that they should be requested to pay half the expenses of the arbitration, when they have experienced heavy loss as a result of the reduction of the claims of their subjects.” This Semitic calculation on an arbitral award, which held that the claims of both sides cancelled each other out, was transmitted to His Majesty’s Government on the 1st December, and when Mr. Hope Gill had occasion, during a telephone conversation with Fuad Bey later in the month, to refer to it in appropriate terms, he received the soft answer that, if the Hejazi Government were pressed to pay, they would probably do so. He advised Fuad Bey that the Hejazi Government would no doubt find it more pleasant to make up their mind and pay without waiting for His Majesty’s Government’s views on their refusal. They did nothing, however, by the end of December. Aerial Trespass. 36. On the 1st December, under instructions from His Majesty’s Govern ment, His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires replied to a Hejazi protest, made in October, to the effect that three British aircraft had violated the Transjordan- Nejd frontier. He explained that one machine had been compelled by engine trouble to land, but that the atmosphere was hazy, and the leader of the formation was therefore doubtful of his exact position; he thought that the landing was made in Transjordan territory. In fact it was made in Nejd territory. Mr. Hope Gill drew attention to the fact that the landing was due to circum stances beyond the pilot’s control and expressed His Majesty's Government’s regret. In reply of the 12th December, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he found it necessary to draw His Majesty’s Government’s attention to the fact that, although the Hejazi Government were always ready to afford all possibleassistance, they could not avoid taking such measures as would leave no room for any infringement of their regulations or violation of their honour. 37. In transmitting this reply to His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty's Minister observed that its language reflected the churlish spirit in which the Hejazi Government habitually dealt with questions of this kind. It might almost be construed as a menace, but in view of His Majesty’s Government's desire to avoid fruitless correspondence over the matter, Sir A. Ryan did not propose to pursue it in writing, but would draw Fuad Bey’s attention to the unfriendly tone of the reply on his return from Riadh. He did so in January. Fuad Hamza explained, somewhat lamely and obscurely, what he apparently tried to convey was that the note meant that, even if the Hejaz-Nejd Government had to condone a violation of territory, it did not impair their rights. In view, however, of the friendly nature of contemporary correspondence about the missing Iraqi pilot, Squadron-Leader Warburton, Sir Andrew did not press the matter further. Iraq. 38. There is nothing of interest to report, except the death at Riadh in October or early November of the Mutair chieftain Feisal-ad-Dawish, once a prominent figure on the Iraq frontier and leader of the 1929 rebellion against Ibn Saud. He is said to have died of an internal disorder in the nature of dysentery. 39. The project of a pilgrim route for cars from Iraq to the Hejaz has been noted in paragraph 22. Koweit and Bahrein. 40. There is nothing definite to report, beyond a certain increased activity on the Koweit border on the part of Ibn Muhairib, Ibn Saud’s frontier official. A sir and the Yemen. 41. The meeting of Saudi and Yemeni delegates referred to in paragraph 40 of the last report was held early in November at An Nadhir, near Mount Arwa, the place in dispute. Neither side would give way, however, and the matter was referred to their respective Governments. Telegraphic messages were thereupon exchanged between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya, as a result of which the latter asked the former to arbitrate. “ Wherefore His Majesty,” as the Hejazi proclamation puts it, “ wishing the dispute to be settled by peaceful means and bloodshed to be avoided, desirous also of seeing co-operation prevail amongst the Arabs, could not but telegraph to His Highness the Imam giving judgment against himself, namely, the surrender of Mount Arwa to the Yemen .... Friendly relations have thus been established between His Majesty the King and His Highness the Imam on firm foundations, please God Almighty.” Ibn Saud must have felt that circumstances were indeed against him, to induce him to yield ground to the Yemen. 42. The local pact nevertheless bore fruit. On the 15th December a treaty of friendship, neighbourliness and extradition was signed at Abu Arish between the Hejaz-Nejd and the Yemen It came as a surprise and is not much believed in. III. —Relations with States outside Arabia. British Empire. 43. Relations were normal. They centred round the Transjordan frontier^ the Hejaz air force and Ibn Saud’s debts. The first-named has been dealt with in paragraphs 32 to 37. Air matters are reported in paragraphs 55 to 60 below. It is convenient to mention the debts here. 44. At the end of his conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Afiaires on the 13th November (see paragraph 4 above), the Hejazi Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs preferred a request that His Majesty’s Government would allow the 1929 debt of £30,000, owing to the Government of India, to be included in the virtual moratorium and placed on a basis of equality with the whole of Hejazi-Nejd indebtedness. Mr. Hope Gill replied that he would communicate the [408 h—3] c10 request to His Majesty’s Government, but that facts and figures would certainly be required. Fuad Bey was in no position, however, to say what the other indebtedness was, either by category or in total, but he thought that it would be possible to liquidate it all in two years. This meagre information was telegraphed to London. 45. Mr. Hope Gill then reminded Fuad Bey of the benzine debt of £13,000 to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., which he insisted could not be deferred, but must be paid according to the agreement of September. Fuad Bey took note of this, but promised nothing. As regards the current debt to the Eastern Telegraph Company, which was always £2,000 or more, he assured Mr. Hope Gill that all postal and telegraphic receipts would henceforth be reserved for its liquidation and would not be pooled with the Government’s other resources. Mr. Hope Gill made a passing reference to the Hejazi half-share of the costs of the MacUonnell investigation, a matter of only £1,700, and was promised an early reply (see paragraph 35). He made no reference to the Marconi debt, which, though mounting up and £5,000 high at the turn of the year, is a matter on which neither the company nor Mr. Philby, their agent, has yet approached the Legation. He mentioned, however, the several hundred pounds owing to a number of British and British-protected chauffeurs in Government employ (see paragraph 14), but without drawing more than a sardonic reference to the similar plight of all Government employees in the country. International. 46. On the 23rd November the Hejaz-Nejd telegraphed to Geneva its adherence to the proposed armaments truce No decision to accept the invitation to attend the Disarmament Conference was notified before the end of the year. France. 47. The treaty with France was at last signed on the 10th November, together with an agreement covering relations with Syria. The former is the result of nearly two years’ negotiation; it is understood to follow the lines of the Treaty of Jedda, but to exclude all mention of the suppression of the slave trade, that civilised aim to which His Majesty's Government had succeeded in binding I bn Saud—on paper. The Netherlands. 48. M. Adriaanse returned to Jedda on the 5th November and presented his credentials as Charge d’Affaires. He had spent a part of his leave acting as secretary to the Orientalists’ Conference at Leiden, but he finds the local Arabic well-nigh unintelligible. Germany. 49. M. de Haas went on leave in November, leaving a local German merchant in charge of his consulate. Soviet Russia. 50. A second consignment of Soviet oil was delivered at Jedda in November (see paragraph 10). Turkey. 51. Lutfullah Bey was in November at length able to present his credentials as Charge d’Affaires. His Legation has since been charged with Afghan interests. Persia. 52. Ain-ul-Mulk Habibullah Khan Hoveida once more returned to Jedda, after six months’ leave of absence, on the 26th December. United States of America. 53. The prospecting activities of Mr. Crane’s engineer are described in paragraph 18.Denmark. 54. There being no Danish representative here, His Majesty’s Government were asked to have enquiries made by the Legation as to the fate of an adventurous Dane, with results that are told in paragraph 31 „ . ^ . IV. —Air Matters. Heyaz Air torce Machines. 55. Following on the crash of one machine (September-October report, paragraph 6), and the departure of the last British pilot (ibidem, paragraph 62), the four Wapitis remained in their hangar throughout November and December. No one was in particular charge of them. The British engineer who looks after the local sea-water condensers was occasionally asked to look at them; he reported that the engines were apparently sufficiently well greased, but that the fabric and stays were suffering from moth and rust respectively. The roof of the hangar then fell in; the machines were moved to an adjacent spot where they were kept under lock and key and a cover of cotton sheets. Hejaz Air Force Personnel. 56. On the 7th November the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs gave a private hint to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that if His Majesty’s Govern ment were to propose that a British aviation mission should be sent to the Hejaz, he would be prepared to urge I bn Saud to accept it. The position, he explained, had changed since the King had refused an offer of even partial assistance in 1927, and Fuad Hamza was now so anxious to avoid the impression of Anglo- Hejazi estrangement which would be given by their engagement of a personnel other than British that he was ready to act as indicated. He was not in a strong enough position to do more. 57. To this suggestion, and to the King’s definite proposals reported in paragraph 67 of the September-October report, His Majesty’s Government replied on the 14th November. They pointed out, firstly, that their willingness to select new personnel for the Hejaz Air Force was based on the Hejazi Govern ment’s proposals of the 17th June (May-June report, paragraph 56), which were superseded by the King’s proposals referred to above. These had been sympathetically considered, but could not be accepted. The King’s request that the personnel should be “under his orders for every purpose” could not be complied with, for reasons already stated (September-October report, paragraph 66, first sentence), while the alternative proposal to engage British personnel for instruction and maintenance and non-British personnel for operations could not be accepted, as it would be unworkable in practice owing to divided responsibility. His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires was also informed that even the June proposals, if revived, would have to be subject to major conditions, (a) that the personnel should not be employed for warlike operations or against rebels, the Government of India having revived their previous objections on this point, and (b) that no foreign personnel should be engaged for flying the aircraft for which British personnel would be responsible. Moreover, the lack of instruc tional machines, the language difficulty, &amp;c., were, in any case, serious obstacles to the success of the scheme; while complications over the payment and treatment of the personnel would have been inevitable, in view of the state of the Hejazi finances. The scheme would thus, in any case, have had to be abandoned. The suggestion of an air mission had already been tentatively considered; but ft would not meet Ibn Sand's apparent desire to use the pilots against possible enemies or rebels, while its cost, no part of which His Majesty’s Government could bear in the existing crisis, would be greater than that of an unofficial personnel. 58. The decisions regarding Ibn Sand’s later proposals and the air mission suggestion were duly communicated to him through Fuad Hamza. On the 22nd November the latter forwarded a message from the King regretting His Majesty’s Government’s decision, reaffirming that he did not 'wish to use the personnel for warlike operations against anyone but must have them under his orders whenever necessary for defence, and stating that, while he understood His Majesty's Government's attitude, he was obliged to look for personnel else where. This was not the first little rift in the lute, but it began to affect the tune.59. There the matter rested at the end of December. Nothing transpired as to the King's attempts to engage foreign personnel, except an unconfirmed report that a Polish engineer from Mecca had been sent to recruit personnel in Poland. A rnbian A ir Route. 60. His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires had on the 10th October suggested to His Majesty’s Government that, if they could help Ibn Sand to obtain the air personnel he required, his agreement to the facilities they sought from him in regard to landing grounds on the Hasa Coast (July-August report, paragraph 72) might be requested as a quid f ro quo. He suggested an annual rental for these grounds of £1,000 gold as the lowest which Ibn Sand would be likely to consider. On the 26th November the Air Ministry informed the Foreign Office that, while it now seemed improbable that the request for facilities could be made as a quid pro quo, they would like it to be broached to Ibn Sand at the first suitable opportunity. They considered, however, that the suggested rent was excessive, as they did not require the grounds for exclusive Royal Air Force use. but only asked that they should be marked out and available for pilots flying on the Persian Gulf route to land on in case of distress; the other desiderata relating to the treatment of the crews of distressed aircraft were, they suggested, no more than His Majesty's Government had a right to expect on grounds of humanity and international courtesy. An annual rental of £50 for each of the three grounds would, in their opinion, be adequate to meet the cost of maintenance and renewal of the markings. His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires was accordingly instructed on the 2nd December to take up the matter with the Hejaz-Nejd Government at a suitable opportunity; one did not, however, arise before the end of the month. Northern Hejaz. V.— Military Matters. 61. During November and December the only addition reported to have been made to the Saudi forces in the northern amirates was that of a draft of 150 men to Tabuk. The Amir of Jauf, Turki-as-Sudairi, moved his headquarters and wireless to Skaka, a village 22 miles north-east of Jauf, in November. In December he posted 100 camelmen and five cars under Ibn Hamdan forward in the Wadi Sirhan, at Isawiya. 62. Everywhere in the north the condition of the garrisons continued to deteriorate. Still no pay was issued, and at Kaf and Tabuk the troops were said to be on the verge of starvation. Circumstantial reports were, at the same time, received from Mecca and Medina that a Nafir al Amm, or general call to arms for Jihad, was in progress in Nejd and the Northern Hejaz. It was commonly thought that Ibn Saud was on the point of risking his arm in a throw against Transjordan as the only means left to him of pacifying the general discontent and offering his starving tribes the chance of helping themselves. Reflection, of course, suggested that Ibn Saud could not lie so foolish as to engage openly in an enterprise which would bring him into direct conflict with His Majesty’s Govern ment, but the possibility could not be dismissed in the case of a man such as he, strong-willed and ambitious, who was already in hard straits and might be desperate in a few months. There was, of course, the alternative possibility of the same object being pursued less openly by the promotion of authorised raids, but no untoward development in either direction took place before the end of the year. East {Nejd). 63. The death of Feisal-ad-Dawish in prison at Riadh (see paragraph 38) is said to have caused widespread consternation and gloom amongst the Mutair and increased bitterness against Ibn Saud. The common belief was that he had been murdered. 64. Apart from this, there were rumours of much dissatisfaction in Nejd and some specific allegations of discontent owing to oppressive taxation, non-payment of wages and bounties, levies in kind on merchants, attempts to impose the use of the unpopular Hejazi dollar, and the reforms instituted in the Hasa by the mission of Muhammad-at-Tawil, whose life was said to have beenmore than once in danger; but there was no active outbreak or military movement of note. Information was, however, received from Bahrein that an unusual withdrawal of horsemen from the Hasa Coast into Nejd had been noticed in November, and from Mecca to the effect that some 24,000 rifles had been collected and repaired there and sent to Riadh. The inference drawn was that, while Ibn Sand was certainly consolidating his position there, it was probably more as a precautionary measure than with a view to expansion or conquest. That is as much as can be said of a situation that was unsettled and obscure. South (A sir). 65. C lashes were reported between Khalid-bin-Luwey and dissidents of the Beni ^ajran, who are said to have been subdued. On the whole, however, the southern frontier was quiet, thanks to the conversations reported in paragraphs 41 and 42, which resulted in the pact of Mount Arwa and a treaty with the Yemen. VI. —Naval Matters. 66. No naval visits by British or foreign warships took place during November or December. 67. On the 5th November His Majesty’s Government communicated to His Majesty s Charge d Affaires their decision regarding the advisability of the more frequent visits by His Majesty s ships to ports in the Hejaz and Asir desired by the Admiralty (July-August report, paragraph 78). It was decided to maintain for four months the present practice, by which His Majesty’s ships visit none of these ports except Jedda, and to review the situation at the end of this period Forged Rupee Notes. VII. Pilgrimage. 68. More reports were received regarding the presence in the Hejaz of forged Indian currency notes. In one case pilgrims from districts on either side of the North-M est Frontier of India were said to be in possession of forged notes believed to have been distributed there by Soviet agents; in another, German agents were said to be distributing forged notes among pilgrims in the Hejaz. No confirmation of either story could be obtained, however. In December another letter was received trom the alleged broker of forged notes in Syria by the member of the Legation staff who had tried to entrap him in the previous winter (January—February report, paragraph 51). The matter was referred to His Majesty s consul-general at Beirut on the 27th December for his views,. Nigenan Pilgrim Destitutes. P n 16th November the Sudan Government replied to His Majestv’s Charge d Affaires despatch of the 6th October (September—October report, paragraph 75) regarding the 500 odd Nigerian destitutes whom the Legation was obliged io repatriate to Africa at the cost of the Nigerian Government. Thev pointed ont that the majority of these destitutes had probably arrived in the Hejaz \ ia Eritrea in sanbuqs, for had they come via Suakin they would have had return tickets and passports, and recent correspondence had clearly shown up the failure of the Eritrean authorities to implement the articles of the 1926 Sanitary Convention, which bound them to prevent embarkation by sanbuq from Massawa In the state of unemployment existing in the Sudan and of economic depression reported in French V est Africa, they did not feel justified in accepting the responsibility on behalf of the Government of Nigeria for the repatriation of these destitutes, which would have the effect of encouraging pilgrims to evade quarantine measures and use the Massawa route. They suggested that the Eritrean authorities should be held responsible for their repatriation. A despatch from his Excellency the Governor-General, dated the 14th November amplified these points, but envisaged the possibility of some of the destitutes being absorbed in the Sudan labour market in February 1932. should conditions still warrant it. 70. It was therefore arranged to examine and classify at the Legation all Nigerian destitutes then in Jedda and seeking repatriation. This examination [408 h 3] D 2was carried out during the second week of November by the pro-consul, in the presence of a member of the Italian consulate, who assisted in the interrogation of the pilgrims and agreed the conclusions arrived at. It involved hy e days exhaustive work; but the results were striking. During the month which had elapsed since the opening of the question, many more destitutes had nocked to Jedda under the stress of economic depression throughout the country, and a total of over 900 was finally examined. Some 100 had come to the Hejaz via Suakin, and 800 via Massawa. Of the former, thirty-two held return tickets, all of which were time-expired; the remaining two-thirds had come to the Hejaz between pilgrim seasons on single tickets. Ninety-four held pilgrim-passes or other Sudan papers; the rest had lost theirs. 71. On the 29th November, 108 pilgrims who had come via Suakin were repatriated at destitute rates by Khedivial Mail steamer to Suakin, with the concurrence of the Government of Nigeria and of the Sudan Government, who, while reserving their rights in the matter, undertook to waive the incoming quarantine dues. The Hejazi Government also waived outgoing dues. In the meantime, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had approached the Italian consul with a view to inducing the Eritrean authorities to accept at Massawa, without payment of quarantine dues, 500 out of such destitutes as might be proved to have come to the Hejaz via Massaw'a, to be sent in batches of 100 by the fortnightly Italian steamer. The consul proved helpful. He sent his interpreter, as already stated, to be present at the interrogation of the destitutes; and, on receiving the resulting proof of the Massawa sanbuq traffic, succeeded in securing the acceptance of the proposed arrangement by the Eritrean authorities. The latter also intervened with the subventioned Italian shipping company to induce them to quote a low destitute rate. The Nigerian Government agreed to the arrangement, and on the 20th December the first batch was embarked for Massawa, the Hejazi Government again waiving outgoing dues. Nigerian Pilgrimage Control. 72. The examination of Nigerian pilgrim destitutes described in paragraph 70 above incidentally show r ed up three undesirable aspects of the present system by which these pilgrims reach the Hejaz. The first was that far too high a proportion of those embarking at Suakin do not come during the pilgrimage season, when they are compelled to purchase return tickets, but slip over between seasons on single tickets. Another w r as that the six-month period of validity of return tickets is too short to suit the leisurely habits of the African pilgrim, w T ho, on reaching the Hejaz, usually works there for over a year to earn money before recrossing the Red Sea. His Majesty’s Minister, w^ho had the previous May suggested to the Sudan Government that return tickets should be made compulsory for pilgrims all the year round and should be valid for at least a year, on the 21st December again emphasised these points in a despatch to Khartum. 73. The third and most important fact of which irresistible evidence was now afforded was the existence of a regular pilgrim-traffic by sanbuq from Massawa to ports on the Arabian littoral. The Foreign Office, in a despatch of the 9th October, had forwarded corroborative evidence of this, collected indepen dently by the Sudan Government, and requested His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires to submit any evidence collected at Jedda which might assist His Majesty’s Government to represent the more forcibly to the Italian Government the failure of the Eritrean authorities to implement the relevant articles of the 1926 Sanitary Convention. The information contained in paragraph 70 above was accordingly forwarded to His Majesty’s Government on the 28th November. 74. On the 10th September the Nigerian Government gave their general approval to the proposals for improved control of the West African pilgrimage drawn up between the Legation and the Sudan Government (March-April report, paragraph 63). 1932 Pilgrimage. 75. Despite active propaganda on behalf of the pilgrimage carried out in India, Malaya, and Java by the Hejaz Government, including an assurance that Pilgrimage Day in 1932 would fall on a Friday, prospects at the end of December were very poor. All the direct sailings from Singapore during November and15 December were cancelled for lack of bookings. Only about 2,500 Javanese arrived during these months, and the Dutch Legation thought these to be about half the eventual number, which would thus be 5,000 as against the 16,000 of 1931. I he Indian pilgrimage promised slightly better; but it seemed unlikely by the end of December that the total number of overseas arrivals for 1932 would much exceed 20,000, as against the meagre 40,000 of last year. ,, . . VIII. —Slavery. Jj! anumissions. 76. One Nigerian male slave who took refuge in the Legation in December was manumitted and repatriated to Suakin on the 26th December. Intelligence Service. 77. As a result of a meeting of the Standing Aden Committee held in London in July, His Majesty’s Government decided not to establish a slavery intelligence service on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. A byssinian Slaves. 78. The successful repatriation by the Legation of two Abyssinian slave- boys by way of Jibuti (July-August report, paragraph 84) led His Majesty’s Government to enquire of His Majesty s Minister at Addis Ababa whether the Ethiopian Government would be likely to consent \o all Abyssinian slaves manu mitted in future by the British Legation at Jedda being sent by this route at the cost of their Government, as a permanent rule. Sir S. Barton in his reply of the 2nd November stated that he would prefer to take up specific cases as they arose, rather than press the Ethiopian Government to agree to any permanent system. V isitors. IX. M ISCELLANEOUS. 79. Mr. Twitched left Jedda on the 15th December for a prospecting tour in Nejd. His activities have been reported in paragraph 18 above. M. Fazl-ul-Haq, former Minister in Bengal and member of the Round lable Conference, arrived in Jedda on the 26th December and left six days later after visiting Medina. Colonel Nawab Osman Jar-ud-Daula, Commander-in-chief of the Hyderabad State Army, arrived at Jedda on the 29th November and left on the 4th December after visiting Mecca and Medina. Princess Saniya Insherah visited the Hejaz early in November and left for India on the 26th November en route for Hyderabad. Prince Mehmed Djemaleddine (son of Prince Mehmed Shevket), with his wife and two other persons, arrived in the Hejaz in November, and, after being refused visas for India, left for Massawa on the 6th December en roiite for either San'a or Addis Ababa. Their object was apparently to raise the wind, but local generosity rose to no more than the cost of their passages out of the country. Deportations. 80. Throughout October and November a certain Mubarik Ali, an Indian graduate of Punjab University and a religious fanatic, who had “ done hijra, i.e., fled like the Prophet, from the infidel land of India, had been bombarding the Legation, the local banks, and the Dutch Legation with abusive and threatening letters from Mecca. His grievance at first concerned certain losses •on exchange which he said he had suffered through the depreciation of sterling; but its scope was extended in subsequent letters to include the failure of the Legation, in a third-person note, to call him “ Sir ; the duties of British repre sentatives; the barbarism of half-naked European women; and the coming of the Mahdi and his triumph over Christians in battle. Explicit reference was made in the last case to massacre of unbelievers, and the Legation was constrained vn the 21st November to ask the Hejaz Government to deport him. Staff. 81. Sir Andrew Ryan returned to Jedda from leave of absence, and resumed charge of the Legation on the 15th December.^ * 16 Mr. Wikeley arrived back in Jedda from leave of absence on the 18th November.

I bn Sand. THE King spent September and October at Riadh, whence he made a number of three and four-day excursions to neighbouring centres and oases for sport and the diversion of picknicking. These were no doubt mixed with a little local politics, but he seems to have avoided work of any kind as much as possible. Pie did not pay his projected visit to the Hasa coast, nor did he move in force to Hail, as rumour alleged, to forestall the Shammar rising which was expected to follow the circumstantially reported escape of some of the Rashidi family from Riadh. All this and other similar and repeated news of “ trouble in Nejd proved unfounded. There was at most a certain dissatisfaction amongst the tribes at having to pay taxes instead of receiving bounty from the King. 2. Ibn Sand, during this period of retreat in Nejd, has been described as disheartened in spirit, disillusioned in mind, and approaching impotence in body. This last disability seemed to have poisoned his whole outlook, so that he had become morose and reticent, withdrawing himself for the greater part of the day into the quarters outside Riadh. where he kept his slaves and concubines, spending long nights with one or other of his wives, and only finding relaxation between whiles in the company of a few Bedouin cronies, where the talk was of women and camels. In the past it had been his wont, even in Riadh, to devote many hours daily to current affairs of his dual monarchy, but he seems this summer to have lost all interest in them, so that even his industrious Rais-ad- Diwan. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, mooned about with nothing to do. These activities and this indolence suggest that His Majesty, who is now 52 and has had a strenuous sexual career, has now reached a stage of conflict between desire and its fulfilment. The Ilejaz. 3. While the King was thus employed in Nejd, government of the Plejaz lapsed more and more into the Bedouin hands of his Director-General of Finance. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, having placed his numerous relatives in key positions, himself moved to and fro between Taif, Mecca, Jedda and Medina, levying contributions in cash and kind and disposing of them none knew how. His bodyguard and style came to overshadow those of the Viceroy, whom he kept short of funds. He made the Vice-President of the Legislative Assembly, Abdullah Ibrahim-al-Fadhl, his jackal. Fuad Bey Hamza, the only other important functionary in the Hejaz, he reduced to impotence by continuing to deprive him and all the Foreign Ministry personnel of their pay and completely ignoring him* and his communications. Throughout September lie consolidated his position as dictator in the King’s absence. By the middle of October he was supreme. At the end of October he was called at last to account. 4. The period of this ignorant Nejdi’s rule was chaotic and critical. As foreshadowed in the last report (July-August report, paragraphs 40 and 41), September opened with a threat of war from the Yemen. There was urgent necessity to send reinforcements and ammunition to meet it, but there was neither money nor petrol available. Abdullah Suleiman raised forced loans from the merchants and 250 troops were sent by sea to Jizan, but the military transport was held up for lack of fuel. He pressed the Soviet Legation for the benzine they had contracted to supply (July-August report, paragraph 10); it had not even left Batoum. He pressed Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. for Shell benzine on credit; knowing their man they offered it on cash terms only. Messrs. Sharqieh (Limited) quoted similar terms for Standard oil. He pressed the Dutch Bank for credit; they refused it pending the outcome of the negotiations in Amsterdam (July-August report, paragraph 9). On the 12th September they informed Abdullah Suleiman that the negotiations had failed and that no more credit would be given. The same night a clean sweep was made of all the benzine held in Jedda. Government lorries plied all night at the task, and when Messrs. Gellatly. Hankey and Co. and Messrs. Sharqieh (Limited) woke next morning they found the warehouse empty and their stocks gone. 5. This coup made a profound local impression. Although such action by the Government is not unknown in Jedda, it had never been carried out on such a grand scale. It soon became evident, however, that, whereas some £5,000 worthof benzine was removed that night, the theft was in reality much greater. It had been continuing for some time; the official returns of stocks bonded in the Government warehouse had been systematically falsified. It transpired, further more. that, in order to cloak the process, the Shell and Standard Oil Companies agents had been denied access to their stocks for purposes of verification, on the plea that the storekeeper had gone to Taif and had taken his keys with him. A Having current supplies in hand they had weakly accepted the plea. They now found that they had lost £12.000 worth of Shell benzine and £4,000 of Standard oil. Sharqieh (Limited) awaited Mr. Philby’s return from Riadh—he was shortly expected. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. at once protested to the local authorities, who in their turn protested complete innocence and ignorance of the whole affair. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires therefore used the expedient of a telegram in plain English to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Taif, an effective means in a country where there is no press and the authorities are consequently sensitive to publicity. An arrangement was forthwith negotiated by Abdullah Suleiman with the Shell agents, by which he admitted responsibility and with the financial terms of which the agents were well pleased. The Govern ment’s guilt thus established, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, registered an official protest and requested a formal assurance that such high-handed action would not be resorted to again. fi. The 13th September was also marked by the spectacular collapse of the Hejaz Air Force. Planes were required at Jizan to overawe both the Imam of Yemen and the dissidents of Asir. The only remaining British pilot. Mr. Lowe, had developed ear trouble, therefore he could not fly. A young Syrian adventurer, recently engaged as a pilot on the strength of his declared ability to fly a Moth, broke down at the prospect of flying a Wapiti; he was flogged and jailed, whereupon the French Charge d'Affaires at once became interested. A Turkish pseudo-mechanic, who also betrayed hesitation, was mauled by the Nejdi garrison, but escaped into the Turkish Legation, where he was given refuge. Finally, a German ex-war pilot, who had been keeping a myopic eye on the machines since the departure of Messrs. Morris and North, was persuaded by the General Officer Commanding the Hejaz army (accompanied by fifty troops) to leave his bed, wffiere he lay ill with dysentery, and set out to fly to Jizan. After a few minutes he was seen to turn back. Above Jedda he shut off his engine and fainted, and the machine glided on its slots into the lagoon. The pilot survived; the German consul intervened; and the Hejaz Air Force lay hors de combat, a position which it has since maintained. 7. The benzine coup and the air force collapse shook the moral of Govern ment employees and titillated the expectations of the rest. The urban popula tions of the Hejaz were heartily sick of the Saudi regime. At Medina there was acute distress, amounting almost to famine conditions. At Mecca people were beginning to go hungry. In Jedda the populace was in a poor way. while the landlord and merchant classes were exasperated almost beyond measure by the extortions of Abdullah Suleiman. But there was neither leader nor the courage to rebel. It was hoped that the benzine incident would make trouble for the Saudi authorities, and the belief was naturally fostered that the failure of the air force was the result of foreign intervention. The silver rival exchange rapidly fell to 17 to the £. Traffic ceased, since there was no motor fuel; the mails had to go by donkey. Further advances by the Imam Yahya were reported and open hostilities were expected within the week. An appreciation of the general situation made on the 19th September is given in paragraph 65. 8. Certain colleagues were for making joint representations to the Hejazi Government about the air force personnel, but His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires declined to co-operate and urged rather the need of bolstering up the confidence q] the local Government instead of seeming to mob it. He, nevertheless, o- 0 t into touch with the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, who was lying°at Port Sudan, and concerted provisional arrangements in case a naval visit were to become advisable. Communications were the chief concern for the Jedda-' Port Sudan cable is a decrepit link and the wireless station lies alongside the barracks. No trouble was anticipated from the Hejazi townsfolk, at best a craven element, but the Nejdi garrison had to be reckoned with They were- dissatisfied and underfed. Two days later, indeed, they began to help themselves to food in the cookshops of the town, and as soon as the Viceroy visited Jedda they raided his kitchens. i6350 j b 29. In the face of these events Abdullah Suleiman remained in Mecca, but it is to the credit of the Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey Hamza that they came to Jedda. They arrived on the 17th September, spent the 18th enquiring into the benzine affair, the air force position, and the complaints of the Nejdi soldiery. A canteen was opened for the latter, to be supplied with goods borrowed from the local tradesmen, since the Finance Department would issue no pay, and the Viceroy left with Fuad Bey on the 19th September and returned to Taif. The visit served to lay the spectre of Abdullah Suleiman for the moment and to steady the nerves of local officials. Better news began to come through from Asir. The people relapsed into torpor again and Abdullah Suleiman resumed his acquisitive role. Xo one seemed able to withstand him. What he could not exact in cash he took in merchandise, which was at once knocked down for cash at auction. No one knew where the money went, but a great deal must have gone to Riadh. A little went to the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London, who had been telegraphing actively for funds. None went to other Government servants, whose pay had, for the most part, fallen eight months into arrear by the end of October. The “Government” at Taif ceased, to all practicable intent or purpose, to exist. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs became the receiving office for unanswered complaints against the Finance Department made by foreigners and delivered by donkeys. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs retired into his projected “Handbook of the Hejaz and Xejd and its Dependencies.' 10. The credit for laying the first charge which eventually undermined the dictatorship of Abdullah Suleiman must be ascribed to Mr. Philby. He returned from Riadh at the end of September and was much struck by the news of the appropriation of his benzine. It contravened his standing arrangement with the Finance Department and placed him in an awkward position vis-a-vis of the Standard Oil Company. On arrival at Jedda he made further discoveries in regard to the Abdullah Suleiman regime. They achieved his reconversion from Saudi idolatry to sane citizenship. He wrote to Abdullah Suleiman such a letter (all of this is confidential, as indeed is this report) as numbered with its amenities the reminder that the price of theft in this country was the loss of the thieving hand, and the opinion that Abdullah Suleiman’s body, therefore, deserved to be cut into little pieces. He also wrote to Ibn Sand. Then he went to Taif, where he found the Viceroy, Fuad Bey Hamza, the Viceroy’s Rais-ad- Diwan Ibrahim-al-Fadhl, and his half-brother. Abdullah Ibrahim-al-Fadhl, Vice- President of the Legislative Assembly and Abdullah Suleiman's erstwhile jackal, putting their heads together in search of a way to break down Abdullah Suleiman's ascendancy. Under the stimulus of Mr. Philby’s presence they drew up a lengthy memorandum to the King. Mr. Philby has described it as an ultimatum, involving wholesale resignation unless Abdullah Suleiman were removed, but Fuad Bey Hamza rather as a report, describing the chaotic situa tion in detail and submitting recommendations for its reform, to which Abdullah Suleiman was invited to subscribe. He very naturally refused. So the docu ment was entrusted to Abdullah Ibrahim-al-Fadhl for presentation to His Majesty at Riadh. Abdullah Suleiman accompanied him there on the 23rd October. At the end of the month Ibn Saud’s reaction was still anxiouslv awaited in the Hejaz. Fuad Bey, when he came to Jedda on the 29th October, was nervous and despondent. He confessed to His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires that he and his colleagues had lost all confidence in themselves. He seemed to be on the point of saying that they had lost all confidence in the King, when he changed the subject. Ministry for Foreign A ffairs. 11. The Under-Secretary visited Jedda on the 31st August and left on the 4th September. His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires discussed a number of current questions with him on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd, amongst them the Yemen situation, which is dealt with in paragraphs 43 to 47. Fuad Bey visited Jedda again on the 17th September, accompanying the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as already described in paragraph 9. Mr. Hope Gill was received by the young man, who, as usual, had nothing whatever to say beyond answering prettily that the King, his father, was well, thank God. The interview with Fuad Bey was short and unsatisfactory, marked chiefly by a clumsy denial of all Government responsibility for the benzine theft. The Amir and Fuad Bey left the same day, the 19thSeptember, to return to Taif. There they remained until Tuad Bey again visited Jedda on the 29th October. In a private conversation on the 31st he unburdened himself to Mr. Hope Gill of his cares and fears for the future of this country. Finance. 12. The silver rival fell two more points in mid-September to 17 to the gold pound. The official rate still stood at 10, however, which enabled the Government to pay at 10 whenever they did pay, which was seldom, and to take, which they often did, at 17. But for the fact that large numbers of riyals were withdrawn from currency in the Hejaz, probably for use in Nejd, the exchange must have fallen considerably lower. The export of gold, except by special Government licence, was forbidden by decree of the 16th October. 13. External credit was still nil. British banks had declined to accept Sheikh Abdurrahman Qusaibi's proposal to open a State Bank in the He jaz (July- August report, paragraph 8) The Nederlandische Handel-Maatschappij also turned down his proposal that they should lend Ibn Saud half a million sterling {ibid., paragraph 9). Internal loans were therefore extracted by the Director- General of Finance wherever he went in the Hejaz, and by means which have already been described in the preceding paragraphs. Very little was written down. Accounts were kept in Abdullah Suleiman's head, which his creditors hoped no longer to see upon his shoulders when the day of reckoning should come. Poverty bred barter. When their benzine was so urgently sought, Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. were offered rice and raisins in exchange. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs never has had a bank balance, but is used to make its diverse payments to the Legation, in respect of small claims and minor routine adjustments, such as telegrams, in mixed currency tied up in scraps of old garments. When even this ceased, the Legation's accountant saw nothing for it but to expect payment in goods, three cakes of soap and a leg of mutton, for instance. But the Ministry maintained caste and paid nothing. 14. The anxiously awaited Soviet benzine (July-August report, para- graph 10) did not materialise until the 20th October, when a Greek five-masted schooner brought 30,000 cases. Contrary to the previous report {ibidem), the Soviet Charge d'Affaires has now stated that payment is not due until six months after each consignment's delivery, when it would be due integrally. He hopes to have no difficulty. 15. No external debt was reduced during September and October, except for a surprise payment of £500 to the Eastern Telegraph Company on the 26th October. This appeared to result from certain written representations made by His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires personally to Fuad Bey Hamza on the 14th October and from the absence of Abdullah Suleiman in Nejd. The balance was promised “ in a few days, God willing.' The Deity has much to answer for in the Hejaz. The balance at the end of October amounted to something over £2,500. Economic Development. 16. Work continued in desultory fashion during September and October on the Waziria wells outside Jedda, and the Turkish aqueduct which connects them with the town. The present wells were built by Osman Pasha, ruler of the Ottoman Hejaz, in 1882-86, but the springs were first exploited for the benefit of Jedda in about 1640. The Turkish system was primitive, and had already lapsed into decay early in the present century. It is now to be repaired, modernised, and donated with a windmill pump from Ohio (111.). 17. Mr. Twitched returned from America on the 19th October, bringing with him the pump, a hand-drill, and a prospecting engineer from Arizona. No serious work was begun until November. Marconi Wireless Installation. 18. There is nothing definite to report. Even Mr. Philby, Marconi's agent, is vague as to what has been happening beyond the fact that the September and October instalments of payment fell into line of arrear with their predecessors (July-August report, paragraph 14). M. Boucicault is believed to have [6350] b 3completed the Tabuk station and to have moved on to Qaryat-al-Milh. Riadh has kept in communication with Taif by means of the mobile sets. The “ Umm-al- Qura of the 30th October announced that the stations at A1 Hasa and Buraida had been completed, presumably by Marconi’s Egyptian engineer. Legislation. 19. No legislation of any note hrs been promulgated. Religious Intolerance. 20. Copies of a further Shia protest against the desecration of tombs by the Wahhabis were received in September from India. It had already received the usual answer (July-August report, paragraph 17). The Wahhabi Committee of Virtue continued its activities at Mecca (ibid., paragraph 16). Communications. 21. The Hejazi Government received in October an enquiry from the Iraqi Government as to the possibility of opening a route for motor traffic from Najaf through Jauf to Medina. They are believed to have replied that the deep sands of the Nafud desert, which lie to the south of Jauf, made this route impracticable, hut that they were studying an alternative route following the old pilgrim track via Hail, called the “ Darb Zubaida.' This track is so named after the beneficent wife of Harun-ar-Rashid, who still has the present Mecca water supply to her credit. Locusts. 22. A reply was veceived in September to Sir A. Ryan’s note of the 10th June (May-June report, paragraph 13). The Hejazi Government said that they would do their best to afford every assistance in the matter of advice to the International Bureau for Anti-Locust Measures, but they expressed their regret at being unable either to associate themselves with the bureau or to adhere to the convention. In effect, as in Persia, they preferred their own locusts to a foreign mission. Security. 23. At the end of August two West African natives disappeared near Rabigh as they were returning on foot from Medina to Jedda. The authorities, having failed to trace them, surmised that they must have been devoured by wild beasts in the mountainous forests of that' region. As the Tihama Plain thereabouts is open dusty desert, inhabited by gazelle and Bedouin, and the two victims were found to be French West Africans after all, the case was passed to the French consulate for further treatment. It must be added that such disappearances are surprisingly rare. 24. At the end of October the Palestine press reported the murder of a Danish Moslem, named Knud Holmboe, by a Wahhabi enthusiast, while he was on his way from Transjordania to Mecca. The Danish Government made enquiries through His Majesty’s Government As a result, the Hejazi Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that the frontier Amirs denied all knowledge of the man and the incident. He added that the press had recently reported him to be alive in Maan. IT.—Frontier Questions. T ransjordan. Raiding. 25. On the 19th October the Acting High Commissioner for Transjordan reported that, on the 28th September, some Nejdi Bedouin had raided the Hejazi Beni Atiya at Hazim, in Nejd, and carried off 200 camels belonging to the Trans jordan Howeytat, which were grazing with the Hejazi herds. A request was accordingly addressed to the Hejazi Government for their return. It would seemthat the locality of this raid, the only one of the period, was really Hazm, and not Hazim, which is 150 miles distant and in Transjordan territory. The whimsical LaUrentian mode of treating Arabic names has its disadvantages. Glubb-lbn Zeyd Meetings. ^ 26. In a series of conversations held on the 1st to the 3rd September, the Hejazi [Jnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs made a determined attempt to engage His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires in a discussion of “additional principles, by which he sought to bind the frontier representatives at their meetings for the liquidation of raid claims. In memory of the complete agreement on the terms of reference, &amp;c., reached in June, as a result of the prolonged exchange of views of March, April and May (May-June report, paragraphs 26 and 27), Mr. Hope Gill refused to discuss yet another set of ‘ principles.' He contended that the frontier representatives must now be left a free hand to liquidate the claims on the agreed basis, and not be further hound by restrictions. Fuad Bey finally capitulated, and professed himself only anxious to establish more principles for the post-liquidation period of frontier co-operation. He expressed the intention of submitting them in writing for His Majesty’s Government's consideration, but had failed to do so by the end of October. 27. On the 16th September he opened a new line of attack by writing to express regret at Captain Glubb's apparent departure from Transjordan, and to request that urgent steps be taken to liquidate the loot, the purpose for which I bn Zeyd was still patiently waiting at Qaryat. This was a little difficult to answer, since the Colonial Office’s telegraphic enquiry of Transjordan of the 2nd September, repeated to Jedda, and asking what was the position in regard to the Glubb-lbn Zeyd meetings, had apparently not been answered, and there had been no news of Captain Glubb’s movements for some time. His Majesty's Charge d'Aft’aires therefore made further telegraphic enquiry of the High Commissioner on the 20th September. On the 1st October, crossing a reminder, came the reply that Captain Glubb would return from leave on the 13th October, and would be instructed to exchange lists of claims with Ibn Zeyd at an early date' Mr. Hope Gill, in informing Fuad Bey, expressed the hope that this time the Hejazi representative would be fully documented for his role. In reporting on the situation to His Majesty’s Government, he asked for information as to whether any decision which should affect his attitude had been taken as a result of the sombre conclusions reached hy Captain Glubb after his last meeting with Tbn Zeyd (July-August report, paragraph 25). Instructions were also sought as to whether the details of future frontier procedure and co-operation, under the guise of Fuad Bey’s “additional principles,” should be discussed at Jedda or left to the frontier representatives alone. Preventive Measures. 28. The Hejazi Government took no steps during the period to bring to the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government the measures taken to prevent raiding from their side of the frontier (July-August report, paragraph 26), and no steps beyond that narrated in paragraph 26 above to seek collaboration with the Transjordan authorities in accordance with the Hadda Agreement. Raiding Criminals. 29. No further advance was made from the position described in the July-August report, paragraph 27. The Amir Abdullah having objected to taking any step forward in the direction of recognising Ibn Sand, His Majesty’s Government did not feel disposed at present to press him to reconsider his attitude about a raiding-criminal agreement with the Hejaz-Nejd. Nor were they inclined to adopt the alternative proposal made by the Actum Hi oh Commissioner lor Transjordan that they should themselves, as mandatory for Transjordania, conclude such an agreement with Ibn Sand. In any event' such an agreement would he hardly workable in the face of hostility between the’Arab authorities on either side. His Majestv’s Government, therefore preferred to rely for the present on the existing policy of frontier co-operation.’Allegations against Captain Glubb. 30. Without waiting longer for the information asked for in his telegram of the 1st August to Transjordan, His Majesty's Charge d Affaires took advantage of the presence of the Hejazi Under-Secretary for Foreign Afiairs in Jedda, on the 2nd September, to reply to the June allegations against Captain Glubb on the lines laid down by His Majesty’s Government (July-August report, paragraphs 29 and 30). He read to Fuad Bey enough of ^ Captain Glubb's reply of the 14th June to answer all the allegations and to meet his further questioning, without having to touch upon the details on which further information was awaited. Fuad Bey, as wms to be expected, fastened upon the one case of “ retaliatory confiscation admitted by Captain Glubb. He -asked whether His Majesty's Government condoned or supported such action, but Mr. Hope Gill remained non-committal and treated the question as hardly serious. Fuad Bey dropped it, but left the impression that he would raise it again when be got the chance. He has not yet done so, however. MacDonnell Investigation. 31. Ibn Sand’s reply to the announcement of His Majesty’s Government’s arbitral finding on raid claims prior to the 1st August, 1930 (July-August report, paragraph 31), was made on the 10th September. While accepting the finding as binding and noting the cancellation of claims on both sides of the line, he was unable to refrain from going over old ground, criticising the weakness of the investigation, discounting the effects of his denial of Nejd territory to the investigator, and protesting that all available witnesses had been produced. His Majesty assured the British Government that, in spite of difficulties which he enumerated and others too numerous to mention, he would abide by his undertaking to accept the award But he wished to know what procedure would be followed regarding the raids made since the 1st August, 1930, when would a decision be made on them, and what measures would be taken to prevent future raids. He believed that the deplorable situation created by the award could only be remedied by a liquidation of the past, the making of agreements with Trans jordan similar to those made with Iraq, and the “ removal of those causes of friction on the Transjordan frontier which were causes of friction on the Iraq frontier no doubt meaning, chiefly, Captain Glubb. 32. Under instructions from His Majesty’s Government of the 22nd October, His Majesty’s Charge d‘Affaires replied taking note of Ibn Sand’s acceptance of the finding, ignoring his criticisms and his insinuation against Captain Glubb, and taking him up on his wish for knowledge which he already possessed. The Hejazi Government were reminded that all claims since August 1930 were now, after long negotiations, subject to joint examination by Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd; that the latter had come to the main meeting hopelessly unprepared; and that His Majesty’s Government saw no reason to change the procedure except to improve the Hejazi side of it. As to measures for preventing further raids, they were still waiting to learn what the Hejazi Government were doing, the Transjordan measures having been fully explained already and having secured encouraging results. They considered that every effort should be made to increase the scope and usefulness of the co-operation between the frontier representatives. Captain Glubh had his instructions in this sense. His Majesty’s Government trusted that Ibn Sand would similarly instruct Ibn Zeyd. 33. As regards the costs of the MacDonnell investigation, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informed the Hejazi Government on the 6th October that their share amounted to €1,726 Is. 8^. He invited them to pay. They have not paid as yet. Refugees from the Hejaz. 34. At the end of August the semi-official “ Umm-al-Qura ’' published a leading article, which alleged that disaffected elements among the Hejazi tribes were being enticed into Transjordan. The writer piously concluded that they must be either heretics, profligates, or criminals, of whom the Hejaz was well rid. They would find plenty of scope in Amman for their disgusting practices, he added, whereas in the Hejaz and Nejd the sword was nearer to the neck of suchv 9 a one than his own jugular vein. The article would have been merely amusing but for its calculated disrespect of His Highness the Amir Abdullah. 35. On the 3rd September, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs •conveyed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires Ibn Baud’s conviction that there was truth in the allegation of enticement. He requested Mr. Hope Gill to bring the facts described in the papers quoted by the “ Umm-al-Qura ” to the notice of His Majesty’s Government in connexion with article 8 of the Hadda Agree- A ment, which forbids such practices. He added an enquiry as to whether it were true that the Transjordan Legislative Assembly had recently voted a credit for the construction of posts on the Hejaz-Nejd frontier. Both points were referred to His Majesty’s Government on the 9th September for instructions. 3h. A second and much more virulent leading article appeared in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 23rd October. Before making representations to the Hejazi Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires established to his own satisfaction the fact, later confirmed by Mr. Philby, that both articles came from the pen of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. Mr. Philby had added that they were written with Ibn Sand's full knowledge and that repeated efforts had been made to induce himself to co-operate with messages to the “Near East’’ and the “Daily Herald ’’ on the same subject. He had declined, saying that he knew nothing of the facts of the matter and that in any case he had since long decided to write nothing for the press about the Hejaz-Nejd, having only severe criticism to offer. Mr. Hope Gill was therefore not surprised when Fuad Bey Hamza, in reply to his formal representations of the 1st November, affected to view the articles with equanimity and even with some satisfaction. Feeling that he had the King and Yusuf Yasin behind him he sought to justify the articles as proper replies to the unwarranted attacks made on the Hejaz-Nejd in the Arabic press and inspired by the Amir (Abdullah). Moreover, he would not admit that they were the work of Yusuf Yasin. Mr. Hope Gill was not in a position either to divulge Mr. Philby’s information or to judge of what degree of provocation had been given He therefore maintained his view that the articles were inexcusable and should not be repeated and referred the question of further action to His Majesty’s Govern ment, with the suggestion that the return of His Majesty’s Minister to Jedda might serve as the occasion for an expression of his views on the behaviour of the Flejazi Government in his absence. 37. In reply to Captain Glubb’s suggestion that, should the Beni Atiya (July-August report, paragraph 73) seek refuge in Transjordan from punitive measures by Tbn Sand, they should first be ordered back and then, if they refused, be oi'dered to move north of Maan and well away from the frontier, His Majesty's Government stated in October that they were disposed to agree, if the case presented itself in the precise circumstances foreshadowed by Captain Glubb. In any other circumstances, however, they would need to consider the matter further in the light of the situation then prevailing. No attempt bv the Beni Atiya to take refuge in Transjordan has been reported. Frontier Line. 38. The Hejazi Government registered a formal protest on the 4th October against an alleged aerial trespass of the frontier by three British machines on the 25th September in the neighbourhood of Qaryat-al-Milh. The complaint was referred to His Majesty’s Government for investigation. • Iraq. 39. On the 2nd September Fuad Bey Hamza broached with Mr. Hope Gill a question which Ibn Sand said was causing him concern. A number of remnant chiefs of the 1929 rebellion were said to be residing at A1 Huwiqa, near the frontier, where they were being given noticeably friendly asylum by the Iraqi authorities. Ibn Sand did not wish to take the matter up with the Iraqi Government on the eve of the exchange of representatives, but he would be very grateful to His Majesty's Government if something could be done about it. The request Was passed on on the 9th September. 40. Representatives, however, have not even yet been exchanged, for reasons that are obscure. An Iraqi Royal Irada of the 1st October made the headquarters of the consul-general for Iraq in the Hejaz-Nejd at Mecca instead of Jedda. This somewhat surprised and puzzled the Hejazi Government, who [6350] b 5had not been consulted and who, while Nuri Pasha was here, had told him that dedda was the diplomatic capital and that no exception could he made. 41. In mid-October King Feisal professed to be much perturbed by rumours of a large concentration at Jauf, which was said to be directed against the pipe line and railway surveys then proceeding in Iraq territory. In order to test Ibn Sand's attitude, he invited him to agree to the opening of a pilgrim route through Jauf, and is believed to have suggested that Ibn Sand should meet him there to inaugurate it. His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires could learn nothing in the Hejaz about the supposed concentration. As regards the pilgrim route, the test was inconclusive, since Jauf is bound on the south by the sandy Nafud desert. As mentioned in paragraph 21, the Hejazi Government are believed to have replied that this route was unsuitable for motor traffic. Koweit and Bahrein. 42. The record of an inter-departmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 12th August was received at Jedda in September. Among other matters discussed were : (1) The method of negotiating the questions awaiting settlement between Koweit and Nejd; it was agreed that Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson, should in the first place visit Jbn Sand on the first occasion when the latter's presence near the Persian Gulf made this possible. (2) The Nejdi “blockade' of Koweit; there being little likelihood of an appeal to Ibn Sand's good nature being successful, it was agreed that the threat to raise the Bahrein transit dues on goods to Nejd, and. if necessary, the actual raising of the dues, should prove a useful weapon in the negotiations. (3) A proposed treaty for the settlement of future claims between Koweit and Nejd; it was agreed that, in the circumstances, no formal treaty was required. (4) Past Koweiti claims against Ibn Saud; it was agreed that the claims amounting to some £110,000, should be held over until conversations were opened with Ibn Saud and then, if possible, used as a lever in the negotiations. (5) The effect of the Hejazi Nationality law on Koweitis and Bahreinis; it was agreed that the matter should not be discussed with the Hejazi Government unless the latter themselves forced an issue. (6) The future status of Koweit; it was agreed that the policy hitherto followed should be continued, namely, that Koweit should be maintained as a protected State entirelv independent of either Iraq or Nejd. A sir and the Yemen. 43. The threat of war between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya noted in the last report (July-August report, paragraphs 40 and 41) developed serious proportions in the beginning of September, but was almost averted by the end. The situation continued to improve in October. It was complicated in the first instance by the simultaneous and probably not unconnected rising of certain Asiri tribes, notably the Masariha, round Jizan. against the Nejdi occupation. After some delay, due to lack of benzine for military transport, recounted in paragraph 4, reinforcements were sent by sea to the Amir of Jizan, and the Asiri situation was got in hand again. As a result probably of this show of resolution on the part of Ibn Saud, reinforced by his telegraphic invocations of Allah, the Imam stayed his hand. He may also have felt Italian pressure at his end. Tbn Saud, on his side, received urgent counsels of moderation from His Majesty’s Government 44. On the 1st September the Lnder’-Secretary for Foreign Affairs had informed His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires that the situation was regarded as serious. On the 4th the Hejazi Minister in London informed His Majesty's Government that the Imam had occupied a number of places on the Hejazi side of the de facto frontier and was adopting so aggressive an attitude that, if it were maintained, there was a serious danger of open hostilities developing. The desirability was very strongly urged upon Sheikh Hafiz Wahba of Ibn Saud adopting counsels of moderation and exercising the greatest possible patience in his dealings with the Imam. His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires was, at the same time, instructed to act similarly at Jedda, emphasising the disastrous results which might follow to the Hejaz from any outbreak of hostilities. The Italian Government undertook to urge similar counsels upon the Imam. Ibn Saud, in reply, expressed his gratitude to His Majesty’s Government for their advice and assured them that he was doing his best to follow it. As evidence, the Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs communicated to His Majesty’s Charge11 ♦ • &lt;TAffaires copies of all the messages exchanged between Ibn Sand and the Imam. The former's were pious and ponderous; the latter's short and flippant. 45. During the first days of September the redoubtable Khalid-bin-Luwey, captor of Taif from the Hashimites, was sent southwards with a force of several thousand tribesmen on camels, with orders to collect more en route and enter Asir. He encountered apathy, and even resistance, on his way and took a month to reach his objective. On the 7th September the Hejazi authorities chartered deck space on the Mogul Line’s steamship “ Jehangir,' then leaving for Aden, to transport to Jizan 250 Nejdi “regulars.' a mixed body containing many slaves of African origins; also fifty aeroplane bombs. Because of the reefs she had to approach from the south, and on arrival on the 11th September lay hooting for half a day off an apparentlv deserted town. Thinking it had already fallen, the captain prepared to leave, when a solitary dugout canoe ventured near. It held the port officer, disguised in a loin cloth ; he was much relieved to find the ship held Nejdi reinforcements. Her arrival from the direction of the Yemen had persuaded the local defence that she was full of enemy Yemenis. On the 17th September Aden reported that the Imam was conniving at aggression on the Asir frontier in the regions of Jabal Fifa and Jabal Razih. in the hope that Ibn Sand's inactivity would give him the chance of occupying Sabya, Abu Arish and Jizan and eventually the Farsan Islands. A contributory cause of the Imam's activity was said to be his anxiety at the grave decline of his port of Midi owing to the rivalry of Jizan. But further Saudi reinforcements, including some armed cars, reached Jizan overland as soon as benzine was available in the Hejaz, and the situation began to stabilise. 46. On the 20th September the Hejazi Government received from the Imam Yahya by post the “very beautiful ' reply which had been promised in a brief telegram received in August. It proved to be quite unintelligible, written in the cryptic style which the late Sherif Husain used to baffle treaty negotiators. On the 24th, however, he clearly accepted Ibn Saud's proposal to appoint delegates to meet near Arwa, agree and delimit a frontier, and set up a modus vivendi. They began to meet about the middle of October. 47. An illuminating sidelight was later thrown by Mr. Philby on Ibn Saud's attitude of early September. When the news of the advance of the Imam's troops in the mountains reached Riadh, the King and he and Yusuf Tasin pored over large-scale maps to determine the extent of the aggression, but nobody knew just where the frontier lay. Ibn Sand was. nevertheless, bent upon launching a sweeping desert attack upon San’a from the north-east, a providential means of employing the Nejdi brethren who lay camped round Riadh. No arguments appeared to deter him, when he suddenly changed his mind completely and ordered his outposts in Asir to avoid all contact with the Yemenis. His Majesty's Government's message thus seems to have been effective, though Mr. Philby was, and still is, ignorant of it and has given as his opinion that any such message would do more harm than good. III. —Relations with States Outside Arabia. British Empire. . 48. The Hejazi Government's relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom remained normal. The Transjordan’frontier produced its usual quota of matters in dispute (see paragraphs 25 to 38). With regard to Iraq, Ibn Saud raised one small point of concern to himself (see paragraph 39). Matters affecting Koweit and Bahrein were discussed in London and are recorded in paragraph 42. 49. On the 18th September His Majesty’s Charge d'Aftaires forwarded to India, for signature, two English-Arabic copies of the revised Money Order Agreement between the Indian and Hejazi Post Offices, signed by the Hejazi Postmaster-General. ' ' ‘ 50. British personnel in the Hejaz Air Force is dealt with in paragraphs 62 to 67. The Hejazi Government’s theft of Shell benzine from Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Co. has been described in paragraph 5.International Disarmamen t Confevence. 51. In consequence of a letter, dated the 14th September, from the Hejaz- Nejd Minister in London to the League of Nations, the Council of the League resolved to invite the “ Govei nment of the Hejaz ' to the 1932 Disarmament Conference. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty s Charge d’Affaires of the invitation with some gratification. He added that it had not yet been decided whether to accept it or not. On being asked on what grounds the Hejazi Government might decline, he confided how extremely difficult it would be to render a true return of the armed forces of the Hejaz-Nejd and the expenditure thereon. Every Amir, big and little, had an armed retinue of some sort, and there was no such thing as a budget in the country. Moreover, his French was weak, and the League had sent him masses of documents in French. Treaties. 52. In October the Hejazi Government communicated to His Majesty’s Legation a collection of treaties and agreements concluded to date by Nejd and the Hejaz-Nejd with their neisrhbours and foreign Powers. A list of these instruments is annexed. V ranee. 53. The treaty negotiations still continued. Italy. 54. The treaty negotiations were stayed. The Italian consul returned to Jedda on the 11th October with instructions to take no further step forward so long as there existed discord and the possibility of hostilities between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya (see paragraphs 43 to 47). The Neth erlands. 55. For lack of funds, the secretary-elect to the Hejaz-Nejd Legation at The Flague has been unable to proceed to his post (July-August report, paragraph 59). The failure of the Hejaz-Nejd negotiations for a Dutch loan and its aftermath have been reported in paragraph 4. Egypt. 56. The Egyptian consul, Hafiz Amer Bey, went on leave of absence on the 10th September. A place-man of Emin Yehia Pasha, the Alexandria shipowner and brother of the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, he was expected to spend his leave in trying to arrive, with their help, at some understanding between the Egyptian and Hejazi Governments before the next pilgrimage. Soviet Russia. 57. The Soviet Minister and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps at Jedda, Nezir Bey Turakoulov, left on the 11th October for six months' leave of absence. His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires gained the impression that his eventual return would depend upon such progress as might be made in the Soviet negotiations for the entry of their goods into this country, where they are still more or less banned. 58. Comrade Horace Salkind arrived in Jedda on the 1st September, and on the Minister's departure became Charge d'Affaires par interim. 59. The first consignment of Soviet benzine, contracted for by the Hejazi Government in August, put in a tardy appearance on the 20th October (see paragraph 14). United States of A merica. 60. Mr. Crane's engineer, Mr. Twitched, arrived#for development work on the 19th October (see paragraph 17).Turkey. 61. The new Turkish Charge d Affaires, Lutfullah Bey, arrived in Jedda on the 5th September, but the presentation of his credentials was held up for two months by the state of his pancreas. IV.—Am Matters. Uejaz Air Force. 62. Mr. Lowe, the last of the four British pilots, and six mechanics selected by the Air Ministry in 1929 for Ibn Sand's new air force, was eventually got rid of in September. As already reported (July-August report, paragraph 67), he had re-engaged himself on the 24th August under a clandestine contract with the Director-General of Military Affairs. When required for work at the aerodrome at the beginning of September, however, he reported sick with ear trouble. He was treated as a malingerer and publicly insulted by the Turkish corporal, his contractor. He sought the assistance of His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 6th September. Mr. Hope Gill took up the matter with Taif, and, as a result, learned on the 8th that the Hejazi Government had decided to cancel the new contract. This was both legal and acceptable, but another ten days was spent in somewhat acrimonious debate before getting the local police surveillance raised (it had been imposed by Hamdi Bey to prevent Mr. Lowe’s departure from the country), and before extracting this now distraught pilot from the toils of the enquiry which followed the crash of a machine on the 13th September (see paragraph 6). He was got away, with his arrears of pay, on the 20th September, incontinently declaring, for reasons known only to himself, that he would return in three months. There was unfeigned relief in both British and Hejazi circles at this final liquidation of the unsuitable 1929 personnel. 63. Conversations continued meanwhile concerning new personnel for the air force. Referring to the memorandum which had been communicated to the Hejazi Government on the 7th July (July-August report, paragraph 68), the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs on the 1st September answered the three subsidiary points then raised by His Majesty's Minister. He stated that he had referred all three pointft to Ibn Saud, who had replied uncompromisingly that (1) matters of discipline were of purely Hejazi concern; (2) he could not permit any arrangement whereby the new personnel might procure alcoholic liquor: and (3) the question of failure to pay salaries when due did not arise, since the terms of the contract would be faithfully observed. The first and third of these answers were somewhat softened by Fuad Bey, who promised to reply shortly to the memorandum itself. Meanwhile the events described in paragraph 13 supervened. 64. Instead of making a written reply, Fuad Bey gave His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires a message on the 19th September from Ibn Saud to His Majesty's Government, to the effect that he would like to know how soon new personnel could be sent out, and that he regarded the option enjoyed by the previous personnel, to resign in the event of war, as incompatible with his present need (that of bombing the Imam Yahya, no doubt); he therefore asked for its omission from the new contracts. Fuad Bey also asked that, in view of the urgency of the matter, the new contracts, modified from the old in the above sense only, be sent to Jedda with the new personnel, for signature on arrival. 65. In transmitting this message to His Majesty's Government, His Majesty's Charge d Affaires summarised the situation which underlay it. As far as could be judged at Jedda, Ibn Saud was simultaneously faced by a state of lawlessness and disaffection in the Northern Hejaz, the possibility of a resurrection of the Rashidi power at Hail, disaffection throughout Nejd at stricter taxation in place of the customary largesse, insurrection in Asir, abetted and utilised by the Imam Yahya, and latent but bitter hostility in the towns of the Hejaz. If this maximum estimate were to be discounted by half, Ibn Saud was still faced with a formidable situation, to meet which he had unimpaired military prestige, much impaired political prestige, less Wahhabi fervour to back him and no money. If he could at once have two pilots with full power to use them as he wished, it would assist him, but it could hardly prove decisive, except perhaps to frighten the Imam into terms. Their effect on his subjects evervwhereelse could not fail to be less than the effect of his four new aeroplanes in 1929, when the Nejdi rebels had been driven into a corner and the weight of His Majesty's Government, which the tribes discerned behind I bn Sand, was concen trated in one district. Only two machines in any case were now serviceable, while a third might be made serviceable, given time, which would be grudged. A further consideration was that Ibn Sand no longer figured in the Moslem press as the popular consolidator of Arabia. Once suspected of having his back to the wall, the press might well turn on him and feature his pilots as hired assassins, with unfortunate results in India; while if they were to fall into rebel hands, there would be far less hope of their deriving protection from their British nationality than there might have been in the 1929 operations near both the Iraq frontier and the Royal Air Force. Over against all these lay the consideration that Ibu Sand would probably regard any delay or failure on the part of His Majesty’s Government to send out the new personnel, which he so badly needed, as evidence that they were no longer inclined to give him their support and assistance, just when these were most required. Fuad Bey had stated that he could not believe that the British Government, with their wide powers and great experience, could fail to devise the means of helping so loyal and useful a friend as Ibn Sand. 66. His Majesty’s Government nevertheless replied to Ibn Sand's message that in no circumstances could they agree to British personnel taking part in hostilities against another Power; the option to resign in the event of war must therefore be maintained and would be exercised if necessary. As regards the contracts, these must be agreed before the personnel were engaged. Draft contracts were sent to His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires, for submission to the Hejazi Government if they still desired the early engagement of personnel under the above condition. 67. Ibn Baud professed to be much grieved by this reply, which His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires communicated to the Hejazi Government on the 30th September. He assured His Majesty’s Government that his intentions were purely pacific, but he did not deny the fact that he needed his air force to meet both internal rebellion and external aggression. He complained that the 1929 personnel had not been worth the money spent on them. He now found it necessary to punish “certain subjects,’' and asked His Majesty's Government to choose one of two courses : either send out sufficient new personnel for four machines, to be under his orders for every purpose, or else send only instructional personnel and mechanics, and he would himself look for his pilots elsewhere; he would use the British for training and the rest for war. An interim reply was given on the 1st November, to the effect that Ibn Baud's proposals presented difficulties, but were receiving urgent consideration by His Majesty's Government. As has been described earlier in this report, the situation has meanwhile improved considerably. V.—Military Matters. Sorthern Hejaz. 68. The poverty and misrule at the seat of Government described in the opening paragraphs of this report were severely felt in the northern Amirates. The Amir of Qaryat-al-Milh, Ibn Abdul Wahid, was reported to have received no pay since June. Ibn Baud’s Controller of Bedouin, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin- Zevd. and his fifty men had had no pay since February. At Jauf the Amir Turki-as-Sudairi went in fear that his troops would mutiny for the same reason, and his difficulties were increased by the presence of numbers of unemployed soldiery of the recent an-Neshmi regime. His cousin at Tabuk, the Amir Abdullah-as-Sudairi, was also reported to be experiencing serious trouble with his garrison, who refused to wear uniform or to clean their barracks. In addition there was typhoid at Tabuk and no medical assistance. Furthermore there was no more benzine, so that frontier patrols could no longer be made. Nevertheless, there was no raiding into Transjordan during Beptember and October. Ea.&lt;i (Nejd). 69. Ibn Baud’s presence attracted large numbers of tribal visitors to Riadh. but no military movements of note were remarked. Reports from Jerusalemstate that it was rumoured in October that the Harb and Shammar were to be concentrated at Jauf, which King Feisal interpreted as a threat against the pipe-line and railway surveys then working in near-by Iraqi territory, but which, if true, was more likely to indicate contemplated Nejdi action against the unruly tribes of the northern Hejaz (July-August report, paragraph 73). South (Ash'). 70. The course of the threat of war on the Yemen frontier of Asir has been reported in paragraphs 43 to 47. VI. —Naval Matters. Naval Visits. 71. In view of the situation in the Hejaz, and after an exchange of views with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Captain Dieken, Senior Naval Officer Red Sea sloops, postponed the scheduled departure of His Majesty's sloop “ Lupin from Port Sudan from the 16th to the 21st September. A visit to Jedda was not found necessary, however. His Majesty’s sloop “ Dahlia ' (Commander A R. Farquhar) paid a routine visit to Jedda from the 23rd to the 26th October. The situation was then normal again, and several hundred Jeddawis, mostly uninvited, attended a cricket match between the ship and the British colony. The usual courtesy visits were exchanged between the captain and the Governor of Jedda, who received his salute of thirteen guns. Both were entertained at dinner at the Legation. 72. There were no naval visits by foreign warships. Search for A rms. 73. As a result of further inter-departmental consultation on the subject of naval search for arms in the Red Sea (see July-August 1930 report, section 34), the following instructions were communicated by His Majesty’s Government on the 2nd September :— “ Prevention of Illicit Traffic in 1 rms and A mmunition. “ The Arms Traffic Convention of the 17th June, 1925, is not in force. Nevertheless, in taking steps for the prevention of the illicit traffic in arms by native vessels, the procedure laid down in this convention should be followed. By this convention, His Majesty’s ships have the right only to ‘verify the flag' in native vessels under 500 tons which fly the flag of*one of the parties to the convention. Under this convention, if no authority to fly the flag is forthcoming, or if, in spite of such authority, strong suspicion still exists that the vessel is carrying on illicit traffic in arms and ammuni tion, she may be conducted to the nearest port of the Power whose flag was flown. No right of search is given by the convention. “ 2. By custom, native vessels in the Red Sea may be searched for arms outside the territorial waters of French and Italian colonies, whatever flag they may be hying. In view, however, of the absence of specific legal sanction for carrying out searches for arms in the Red Sea, it is of importance that all searches should be ostensibly for slaves and not for arms. Searches in the territorial waters of the Hejaz proper, as distinct from Asir, i.e., north of Dahban, should be conducted with great discretion and should not take place at all in the vicinity of important ports. If a native vessel is found to be carrying a greater number of arms than is necessary for the normal crew, it may be assumed that, in the absence of a special licence, that they are doing so illegally, and any rifles or pistols (but not swords or daggers) in excess of this number should be confiscated, but in the case of a dhow which could prove Hejazi or Asiri origin no action should be taken in the territorial waters of the Hejaz proper (as distinct from Asir), i.e., north of Dahban. “ 3. If any considerable quantity of arms is found on board, or if there is a strong suspicion that the vessel is engaged in illegal traffic in arms or' 16 ammunition, the procedure laid down in annex II. section II of the Arms 1 raffic Convention is to be carried out in the case of vessels flying the flag of one of the signatories to that convention or flying no flag. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 above, native vessels flying the flag of a country that is not a signatory should be taken to Aden. “ 4 Special agreements regarding the right of search for arms remain in force with Italy and Muscat. ' 5. It is the custom of the Governments of the various divisions of Arabia which border on the Red Sea, to arm small vessels from time to time for the protection of their respective shipping and the repression of smuggling. Such vessels should, of course, not be interferred with.' VII. —Pilgrimage. 1931 Pilgrimage Report. 74. A very detailed and consequently somewhat bulky pilgrimage report on the 1931 season was compiled in the Legation in September and despatched on 4he 29th. The local pilgrimage conditions had showed no improvement on those of the previous year. The best that could be said for Ibn Sand was that he had maintained security; the worst, that the inefficiency and corruption of his Moslem Arab regime in the Holy Places continued increasingly to contrast with the care bestowed on pilgrims by the infidel Powers. Nigerian Pilgrim Destitutes. 75. In September it was calculated that there were some 500 Nigerians destitute in Jedda without means to return to Africa and without sufficient work to support themselves in the Hejaz (see July-August report, paragraph 80). As there was no prospect of their being able to find employment for many months to come, the Legation was faced with the necessity of arranging for their repatria tion to the east coast of Africa, whence they might work their way as usual across the continent. On the 6th October His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires addressed the Sudan authorities in this sense, and enquired whether special arrangements could be made to admit these destitutes at Suakin, without payment of the usual quarantine dues, and either to absorb them in the local labour market or, alternatively, to entrain them for districts in or beyond the Sudan, where their labour could be utilised, and whence they could work their way homeward in the traditional fashion. No reply was received by the end of the month. More destitutes meanwhile began to arrive from the interior, where poverty was even more acute than in Jedda. VIII. —Slavery. Slave Trade. 76. Also as a result of the inter-departmental consultation referred to in paragraph 73. the following instructions in regard to searches for slaves in the Red Sea were issued by His Majesty’s Government on the 2nd September : — “ Suppression of Slave Trade. “ There is no longer any general convention in force according the right of search for slaves, but the convention of the 10th September, 1919, revising the General Acts of Berlin (1885) and of Brussels (1890), states that the signatories (United States of America. Belgium, British Empire, France. Italy, Japan, Portugal) will endeavour to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms, and of the slave trade by land and sea. It can also be argued that the obligations of the General Act of 1890 still apply to countries who were parties to it. but not of the 1919 convention, and therefore to Turkey and the States who have succeeded her. The latter would, however, probably refuse to admit this. A further legal basis of a similar kind could possibly be found in the Anglo-Turkish Treaty of 1881 for the suppression of the African slave trade. A more definite legal basis inrespect of Hejazi, Asiri and Nejdi vessels is provided by article 7 of the °* Jedda in 1927, in which Ibn Sand undertook ‘to co-operate by I the means at his disposal with His Britannic Majesty in the suppression of the slave trade.’ 2. Freaties are still in force under which His Majesty's ships can search vessels of the following countries for slaves, viz., Borneo, Egvpt (vessels under 500 tons), Italy, Liberia, Muscat, Persia, Spain (vessels under oOO tons), and Bahrein and the Trucial sheikhdoms (Abu Dhabi, Dabai, bhargah, Ajman, Umm-al-Qaiwain and Ras-al-Khaima). 3 By custom, however, native vessels within the Red Sea may be searched for slaves outside the territorial waters of French and Italian Colonies, whatever flag they may be flying. Searches in the territorial w * te ™ ^ the He .jaz proper (as distinct from Asir), i.e., north of Dahban, should, however, be conducted with great discretion, and should not take place at all in the vicinity of important ports. 4. Care must also be taken to avoid giving offence to the French and Italian authorities by undue restraint on dhows legitimately sailiim under their colours. The authority to fly the flag should be carried by the dhow. Seal ch must always be carried out in the manner laid down in the Slave Trade Instructions, Volume I. 6. The main traffic in slaves is believed to cross from the African to the Arabian shore in the narrower waters at the southern end of the Red Sea, proceeding thence up the Arabian coast, inside the islands and reefs as far as possible, to the trading ports. 7. Runaway Slaves. Ihe Arabs regard slaves as recognised servants and to give refuge to runaways is liable to cause great irritation. On the other hand, it is against British principles to refuse these people refuge Commanding officers are, therefore, to consult British consular or political representatives in Arabia as soon as possible as to action to be taken.’’ M anumissions. 77. One Abyssinian woman was manumitted locally in September by agree ment with her owner. Two male slaves took refuge in the Legation in October* one ieft of his own accord to work for himself, the other, a Sudani, was repatriated to Suakm. r IX.— Miscellaneous. Staff. 78.

HAVING left the Mu’abda Palace at Mecca on Sunday, the 28th June, Ibn Saud arrived at Riadh on Saturday, the 4th July. It seems to have been a right royal removal and, incidentally, that's the way the money goes. An advanc^*^ party in 114 box-cars and lorries carried the heavy baggage. More than sixty such cars are said to have been required for the silver dollars which the King is to popularise in Nejd, but this item of news need not be taken whole. Whatever the exact figures, they were enough vastly to impress the populace of Hejaz. Seven hundred motor vehicles in all is the estimate of the Indian vice-consul, who was in Mecca shortly before the start, and they must have been needed; for with His Majesty went his brothers the Amir Muhammad, the Amir Abdullah, the Amir Ahmad, and the Amir Musa’id, together with all their households; his sons the Amirs Sa’d, Fahad, Mansur, Abdullah, Bandar, Musa'id, Abdul Muhsin, Sultan, Mash’al, Abdurrahman, Mutiyib, and Talal; his nephew Khalid ibn Muhammad; and all the little Rashidis. His second son and Viceroy of the Hejaz, the Amir Feisal, accompanied him to A1 Moya, a two days’ journey, whence he returned to Mecca. His eldest son and Viceroy of Nejd, the Amir Sand, with two more sons, the Amirs Muhammad and Khalid, not to mention his cousins, came a two days' journey to meet him at Marat and escorted him into Riadh. His reception there “ our pen fails to describe,” concludes the editor of the ” Umm-al-Qura,” who is generally a ready writer. 2. It should be added that Ibn Saud did not simply travel en famille. He was accompanied by his secretaire and chief of his political diwan, Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, all the officials of his royal diwan, two doctors, and the Tripolitan refugee Khalid Rey-al-Qarqani. He was followed by Mr. Philby and two mobile Marconi wireless sets. 3. The stay in Nejd is to last about six months. In the middle of August the “ Umm-al-Qura ' announced that the King was just then leaving Riadh for a few weeks in the Flasa, but it appears that the troubles to North and South, referred to later, have kept him at Riadh, where he is in direct wireless com munication with Taif. If rumour is to be believed, he has already made heavy demands on his Director-General of Finance for cash, amounting on one occasion to £20,000, of which £5,000 were collected from one still wealthy sheikh and the money-changers at Mecca. 4. In the Hejaz it is generally felt that the King, having concentrated his attention on Hejazi affairs for over a year (his first prolonged stay in this part of his dominions since his conquest of it in 1925), has left them in a hopeless mess. It has even been suggested that he has run away from them. Undoubtedly he was tired, in all probability discouraged, and as likely as not looking for relief in his native Nejd, where there was also possibly some need to consolidate his position in person. His absence has left the Hejaz half of this kingdom like a waterlogged and half-dismantled ship, lacking any particular signs of a wind to blow it either into port or further on the rocks. It is hard to say who has been governing the country for the last two months. Probably the Director of Finance, since Government seems to have reduced itself to the withholding of all pay and salaries and a succession of attempts to raise the wind. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 5. The Amir Feisal moved the seat of “ Government ” from Mecca to Tail on the 6th July for the summer. He has continued to be a nonentity in both features of his double role as Viceroy and Minister for Foreign Affairs. His impartial love of women and boys is, from all accounts, undiminished. The Bedouin falls to these luxuries of town life as an African to gin. 6. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs visited Jeddu on the 6th July for two days, on the 15th July for the inside of the day, on the 26th July for a day, and not again until the 31st August. On the 7th, 8th and 15th July, His Majesty’s Minister had the opportunity of discussing current affairs before his departure on leave. On the 27th July Fuad Bey contented himself with ringing up His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires, and having nothing special to say he returned to Taif. His visit of the 31st August was unannounced, but productive of a certain amount of discussion which falls to be dealt with in a later Report.c \ Finance. 7. The silver dollar (riyal) sank another point in July to 15 to the £ sterling*, although still quoted officially as standing at 10. Some £20,000 worth of the nickel coinage (halalas) has been locked up in a room in Mecca and its ithdrawal from circulation, in the form of a forced loan from the merchants, nas served to maintain the value of the current remainder. 8. To Ibn Saud’s request of the 17th June for help from His Majesty’s Government to bring a British bank into the country as a State bank (May-June report, paragraph 4), His Majesty’s Minister was instructed on the 14th July to reply that His Majesty’s Government regretted that they were unable to depart from their long-established practice of non-intervention in transactions between foreign Governments and British banks. Meantime, however, the King had empowered Sheikh Abdurrahman Qusaibi, who was visiting England, to interview banking firms in London, thus anticipating the advice with which His Majesty’s Government had amplified their reply. As a result of the Hejazi Minister’s conversation at the Foreign Office, it was arranged that his secretary should accompany the sheikh to the Department of Overseas Trade to discuss matters. They there stated that they were already in touch with the Eastern Bank and the Ottoman Bank. They were given an introduction to Barclay's Bank. No success is known to have attended their efforts to present the matter as a business proposition. 9. Sheikh Abdurrahman seems, however, not to have been idle in Holland. Following up the appeal made in Jedda to the acting Dutch Charge d’Affaires (May-June report, paragraph 4), he appears to have made some headway in Amsterdam, for the manager of the “ Dutch Bank ” in Jedda—a branch of the Nederlandische Handel Maatschappij—informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at the end of August that his principals seemed to be seriously contem plating a loan of half a million sterling to Ibn Baud, to be secured on customs receipts and conditioned by suitable concessions in matters of the handling and control of all public moneys in the Hejaz. Mr. Jacobs regarded the purely economic and financial bases of such an arrangement as sufficiently sound, and cited customs figures for the Hejaz which ranged round the million mark (sterling) during the past three years. But the political future worried him profoundly, and he was inclined to advise his principals that Ibn Sand could not be relied upon to maintain peace and his own position for a further oeriod sufficient to secure such a loan. 10. Meanwhile the Hejazi Government were unable to get credit anywhere. The Dutch Bank would give none pending the negotiations, nor would Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Limited), with whom the Government had been unwilling to renew their former contract for Shell benzine. The Director-General of Finance had, therefore, to look elsewhere for the fuel needed by Ibn Saud and his Government. He entered into negotiations in July with the Soviet Legation for the supply of benzine on deferred terms of payment. The negotiations were long and tiresome, the Russians seeking to use the Government’s need of motor fuel as a lever wherewith to remove the existing embargo on all Russian goods (in spite of which a few goods do enter and are dutied fourfold). They failed in this endeavour, but they, nevertheless, signed a benzine contract, probably in order to keep a foot in the part-open door to further negotiations. The terms of the contract are understood to be purchase by the Hejazi Government from Sojusneftiexport (Soviet Naphtha Export) of 60,000 8-gallon cases of benzine at 6s. 66?. a case c.i.f., and 40,000 8-gallon cases of kerosene at 5s. M. a case c.i.f., the total cost of £30,000 to be paid in four equal instalments at two-month intervals, the first on delivery. As an immediate result, and before there was even any definite news of the arrival of this fuel, the Director-General of Finance was able to make advance sales of benzine in Mecca for cash to the tune of £2,000 at £1 a case, a transaction which paid him handsomely. 11. Neither this nor money collected periodically from Hejazi merchants “ on loan ” was used to reduce the Government’s indebtedness, nor was much, if any, of it used to pay Government officials’ salaries, which fell still further into arrear. The debt to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Limited) of some £8,000 remains outstanding, and will probably so remain until they can distrain on the receipts of the next pilgrimage season. The Post Office Department’s debt to [273 cc 1] B 2* the Eastern Telegraph Company continued to mount steadily since the last settle ment up to the end of April, and was something over £2,000 at the end of August. As for the £30,000 owed to the Government of India for arms supplied to Ibn Saud to crush the Nejd rebellion of 1929, the Hejazi Government’s appeal ad misericordiam was perforce allowed, and they were informed in July that the Government of India had no alternative but to agree to still further postpone^- payment. The hope was expressed that Ibn Saud would honour his pledge noV 1 later than the 5th March, 1932. A reply expressing the King’s thanks, but nothing more, was received in August. Economic. 12. Mr. Twitchell’s report on the minerals of the Hejaz coastal area appeared in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” during July and August, whence it was retranslated back into English and sent home for such expert study as it might merit. To the layman it was disappointing. Some ancient gold workings at A1 Qaryat and some surface asphalt up and down the coast near Wejh appeared to be the only indications of mineral wealth of any possible value. More will be known when Mr. Twitchell returns, as is expected, in October with six American prospectors. This factor at least would seem to show that there was more in his report or his further discoveries than was published. The Swedish geological mission mentioned in the May-June report (paragraph 9) appears to have been side-tracked. 13. As a result of Mr. Twitchell’s report and supposed high optimism, the exploitation of minerals began to assume attractive features in the eyes of the local inhabitants as a rich alternative to the exploitation of pilgrims. Marconi Wireless Installation. 14. The Hejazi Government failed to pay the July and August instalments. There was also a series of delays in getting on with the work of installation. Two mobile sets followed Ibn Saud to Riadh at the end of July, accompanied by Mr. Philby and the Egyptian engineer, and there they were used to maintain communication with the Hejaz, but no serious attempt was made to prepare the groundwork for the big Riadh station and all the material continued to lie in Jedda. As for the stations-to-be in Northern Hejaz and at Jauf, the Marconi expert, Mr. Boucicault, was unable to leave Jedda for Wejh until the 2nd August, and at the end of the month he was still at Wejh, unable to proceed to Tabuk, the site of the first station, for lack of benzine for his convoy. Legislation. 15. The texts of measures governing the Shari’a courts, the Hejazi Civil Service, and commerce and commercial litigation were published during July and August. Religious Intolerance. 16. July saw the reconstitution in Mecca of the dreaded Wahhabi Committee of Virtue. The easy-going Hejazis were beaten up to their five-a-day prayers by Nejdi soldiery placed at the committee’s disposal. In the words of an eye-witness, the Indian vice-consul, “ these incarnations of the devil wildly run through the public thoroughfares and enter the lanes and by-lanes in pursuit of the defaulters who might have taken shelter there, and on discovery fall upon them with all their might and beat them mercilessly. There is no distinction between good and bad, rich or poor, young or old. They lay them down on the public road and flog them indiscriminately.” There appears to be no escape for the Meccawis from these indignities, for whereas in the past offenders against the puritan Wahhabi code of prayerfulness and abstinence from tobacco were given a chance to appear before a body of notables, among whom were citizens who had a natural inclination to leniency towards their fellow-citizens in crime, all are now dealt with summarily by the Nejdis, who are distributed in gangs of twenty throughout the thirteen quarters of Mecca. It is expected that this treatment will ease off before pilgrims from other lands begin to arrive.5 17. The Legation received a long complaint in July from a prominent Shi'a recounting the indignities heaped upon his sectaries in the Holy Places. Another complaint in August concerned the closing of a school in Medina, of which the Nizam of Hyderabad is one of the patrons, for refusal to employ a Wahhabi teacher and to inculcate the Wahhabi concept of the Unity of Allah. Neither complaint could of course be attended to without departing from His Majesty's ^Government’s settled policy of neutrality in religious matters. II.— Frontier Questions. Transjordan. Raiding. 18. One Hejazi raid was reported in July by the Transjordan authorities as having taken place on the 5th May, when a party of Hejazi Aniza raided the Transjordan Howeytat, killed one man, and made off with some sixtv camels. The usual protest was lodged. 19. In August a desert patrol of the Transjordan Arab Legion recovered two camels and two rifles taken by the Transjordan Tagatga from the Hejazi Billi. These were held ready for collection at Mudawwara, and the Hejazi Government were notified. There was no other raiding during July and August, thanks chiefly to the efficiency of the Transjordan Desert Police. Glubb—Ibn Zeyd Meetings. (a) Meeting of June 3. 20. Not until the 25th July did the Legation receive from the Transjordan authorities the particulars of the preliminary meeting held on the 3rd June between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd (see May-June report, paragraph 25). The meeting was cordial and friendly, each side entertaining the other to a meal. The following subjects were discussed ^ (a) The need for close co-operation between the two parties. {b) The immediate restitution of any loot taken, by the sending of victims with a letter to the representative of the other Government. {c) The method by which victims should substantiate their claims by the production of two witnesses, who, if possible, would be the sheikhs. (d) Compensations for persons killed (1) If the person killed was the aggressor, the compensation should be seven young camels. ('2) If the person killed was not the aggressor, the compensation should be twenty-eight young camels. These fines could be compounded for 15 liras in the first case, or, in the second case, for 60 liras. Relatives of the killed would not have to identify the actual murderer, but simply prove that the victim was killed by a certain party. (e) The question of taking commission on loot returned :— It was suggested by the Transjordan representative that this be done away with; the Nejd representative, however, doubted whether his Government would agree to forgo it, and was informed that if the Nejd Government did not abolish the practice the Transjordan Government could also not do so. If the practice continued the compensation should be in terms of cash per camel. Sheikh Abdul Aziz, up to this point, agreed to all suggestions, but suddenly torpedoed all the proceedings by saying that he had no authority to make any agreement without reference to Ibn Baud, and he absolutely refused to allow any paper embodying the terms to be drawn up for mutual signature. He stated, however, that he had received a letter from Ibn Baud saying that he hoped that powers to treat with the Transjordan Government representative would shortly be given.6 21. This meeting, however, was only a preliminary one, designed to establish contact between the two frontier representatives. Their main meetings for the settlement of all matters connected with raids since the 1st August, 1930, were to follow. Meanwhile, on the 1st August, the Hejazi Under-Secretary offered to come to Jedda to discuss the preliminary meeting, but His Majesty's Charge d Affaires replied that he thought that they could not advance matters b^| discussing what was merely an exchange of views at the preliminary meeting j and as the terms of reference of the main meeting had already been settled after full discussion (see May-June report, paragraphs 26-27), he considered that it should be left to the two frontier representatives to carry on. Although not strictly within the scope of this report, it is convenient to mention here that hoad Bey, in a series of conversations held at Jedda on the 1st to the 3rd September, made another and more determined attempt to start a discussion of additional principles, by which the Glubb-Ibn Zeyd meetings for the settlement of past raids should, in his view, be controlled. He was ridden off. 22. The Legation has been somewhat hampered by lack of concise and up-to-date information from Transjordan about the passage of events which interest it closely. News of the preliminary meeting having taken place on the 3rd June was first received through the Hejazi Government. Information as to its outcome was not received from Transjordan until nearly two months later. The first main meeting was held on the 15th August, but the Legation was only apprised of the fact on the 1st September, and through Hejazi channels. Information from Transjordan came to hand on the 15th September, in the form of a report by Captain Glubb, dated the 19th August. (b) Meeting of August 15. 23. There were apparently two items on the agenda of the main meeting of the 15th August: (1) The return of loot taken since the 1st August, 1930, an era which divided at the 1st Ramadan (the 19th January) into two looting periods, the greater and the less; and (2) the settlement of future procedure. In regard to the first item, Ibn Zeyd stated that he had not prepared a list, which rendered examination of the claims impossible, but Captain Glubb succeeded in securing his agreement to attempt an immediate restitution of the little loot taken since the 19th January. In regard to the second item, Ibn Zeyd was equally unprepared, having, he said, received no instructions to discuss future procedure. Captain Glubb raised two further matters : (3) TJie taxation of Transjordan tribesmen in Nejd territory, on which point Ibn Zeyd replied that he had implicit orders to tax; and (4) the “numerous protests'' by the Hejazi Government against his, Captain Glubb’s, activities since his last meeting with Ibn Zeyd. There seems to have been some misconception of the real position here, for only one protest was made, under three main heads, and it was made from Mecca on the same day as the meeting at Hazim Wells, the 3rd June (see May-June report, paragraph 29). So that, when Ibn Zeyd expressed to Captain Glubb his astonishment at “ the continued despatch of such protests, in view of the fact that after their first meeting he had written at length to Ibn Saud ” to persuade him of Captain Glubb’s real merit, it seems that their feelings were being unnecessarily harrowed. 24. With regard to this first main meeting of the 15th August, it may be added, for purposes of record, that, whereas Fuad Bey informed His Majesty’s Minister on the 21st June that instructions for the meeting had been sent to Ibn Zeyd, adding that it would be better if Captain Glubb were to wait a few days before arranging the meeting so as to allow time for the instructions to arrive, it was not until the end of July that Captain Glubb received instructions to suggest to Ibn Zeyd a date and place for the meeting. He did so, but received a reply from Ibn Zeyd that he had not yet received his instructions. About the 10th August, however, the latter sent to say that he was ready, and they met, only to find that Ibn Zeyd, as already mentioned, had neither lists of past raids nor instructions as to future procedure. Yet the Hejazi Under-Secretary has since categorically informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at jedda (the 19th September) that Tbn Zeyd was supplied in good time with a full list of claims. 25. The meeting of the 15th August was the first fruit of His Majesty’s Government’s strong representations of the 28th February to Ibn Saud, that7 Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeyd should meet to examine and settle past raids. Captain Glubb’s opinion at the end of the meeting, however, was to the effect that, if His Majesty’s Government proposed to stand aside and urge Ibn Saud and Transjordan to arrange matters between them, there was not the least chance of Ibn Saud returning a single animal. Captain Glubb also feared that if the jnatter of claims were pressed home at their next meeting, the only outcome would ibe an open rupture between himself and Ibn Zeyd. There were no more meetings. Preventive Measures against Raiding. 26. In a letter dated the 5th July Fuad Bey Hamza drew Sir A. Ryan s attention to the supposed fact that the measures taken to prevent raiding were only designed to'last over the period of the Glubb-Ibn Zeyd meeting for the settle ment of claims. He therefore asked for His Majesty’s Government’s views'as to how to prevent raids after the meeting. While submitting the request to His Majesty's Government, Sir A. Ryan gave his personal views in conversation with Fuad Bey on the 7th July. He reminded him that it had been agreed after a definite exchange of views that the proclamations of Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah should apply to all raiding at all times and not merely during the Glubb-Ibn Zeyd meeting. He recognised of course that proclamations alone would not stop raiding. That must be effected by the measures taken on both sides of the frontier and their co-ordination by co-operation between local authorities, as contemplated in article 3 of the Hadda Agreement. As regards measures, the position was that last October His Majesty's Government had fully informed the Hejazi Government of what was being done on the Transjordan side. They had, however, received no similar statement from the Hejazi Government. The best means of preventing future trouble were (1) mutual knowledge of the measures taken on each side, and (2) collabora tion in accordance with the Hadda Agreement. These views were endorsed by His Majesty’s Government and confirmed to Fuad Bey by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 10th August. There was no reaction in the direction of either (1) or (2) above. Raiding Criminals. 27. In conversation on the 7th July Fuad Bey Hamza enquired of Sir A. Ryan as to the position regarding raiding criminals. He was told that the further points raised by the Hejazi Government had presented great difficulty and were still being examined. Now^ at the end of June the High Commissioner for Transjordan had expressed the view 7 that the raiding-criminals formula (see May-June report, paragraph 28) should be dropped and a formal extradition agreement negotiated in its stead. He had therefore proposed that the Trans jordan delegation to Jedda be fully empowered to negotiate a suitable formula only if Hejazi opposition to a formal extradition agreement could not be overcome. The delegation would consist of Mr. Kirkbride only, as the Amir Abdullah was not disposed to send a Transjordan official. If an extradition agreement proved feasible, how r ever, it would presumably be negotiated by His Majesty's Minister, co-operating with Mr. Kirkbride, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, since the Amir Abdullah would almost certainly object to direct negotiations between Transjordan and Ibn Saud. On the 8th August His Majesty’s Government expressed their general concurrence, provided the Hejazi Government were willing, but suggested that the agreement should be similar in form to the Bahra Agreement of 1925, i.e., signed by the Hejazi Government and a British pleni potentiary on behalf of the Transjordan Government. In that case Sir A. Ryan should negotiate and sign as plenipotentiary, Mr. Kirkbride acting merely as his expert adviser. The High* Commissioner for Transjordan replied on the 21st August that the Amir Abdullah would not agree, but that he insisted on requesting that the agreement should be made by His Majesty's Government as mandatory and subsequently applied to Transjordan by local legislation. There the matter has rested. Mutual Recovery of Loot. 28. The Hejazi Government’s statement that, although many Transjordan raiders were entering the Hejaz-Nejd with the loot they had previously taken from Hejaz-Nejd tribesmen, the Government were prepared to forgo its recovery^■1 wmmm 8 until Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeyd had met and agreed thereon, provided that Transjordan should do likewise (see May—June report, paragraph 30), was but coldly received in Transjordan. The latter preferred to keep a free hand, suspecting the proposal as designed to seduce Transjordan tribes from their allegiance. The matter was accordingly allowed to drop in the hope that it would soon be superseded by the happy results of the Glubb—Ibn Zeyd meetings. Allegations against Captain Glubb. 29. On the 5th July the Hejazi Government reminded His Majesty’s Minister that they had not received any reply to their note of the 3rd June, in which were enumerated various misdeeds alleged against Captain .Glubb (see May- June report, paragraph 29). At the end of July His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires received from the High Commissioner for Transjordan a copy of Captain Glubb’s remarks on the allegations, dated the 14th June and running into a dozen close- typed sheets. A few days previously he had received instructions from His Majesty’s Government to base on this report a reasoned reply to the Hejazi allegations of the 3rd June, and at the same time to make it clear that His Majesty s Government strongly resented such baseless accusations levelled against a British officer, whose reply showed the patience and loyalty with which he had worked and justified the confidence which His Majesty’s and the Transjordan Governments originally placed in him and continued to hold. 30. Before the drafting of a reasoned reply, there were two points of detail on which His Majesty s Charge d'Affaires had to seek enlightenment from 1 ransjordan (in a telegram dated the 1st August), and also a point of principle concerning one case of retaliatory confiscation, to use the Hejazi term, which he referred to His Majesty’s Government at the same time for further instructions. The latter replied that they preferred for reasons of policy not to have conveyed to the Hejazi Government any endorsement of Captain Glubb’s action in this case, even though the confiscation was made in exceptional circum stances, but rather to let the gist of his report on the incident speak for itself. No reply having been received from Transjordan, further telegraphic enquiry was made on the 13th August, but no reply was forthcoming by the end of the month. Mr. Hope Gill's reply to the Hejazi note of the 3rd June was therefore held up. MacDonnell Investigation. 31. His Majesty’s Government’s arbitral finding on raid claims prior to the 1st August, 1930, was communicated to the Hejazi Government on the 12th August. It was worded as follows : — His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom have considered the report submitted to them by Mr. MacDonnell on the results of his investigation into the claims arising from raids from the Hejaz-Nejd into 1 ransjordan and from I ransjordan into the Hejaz-Nejd, which took place before the 1st August, 1930. Owing to the insufficient and often contra dictory nature of the information and evidence furnished to Mr. MacDonnell; to the length of time which has elapsed since the dates of many of the raids involved; and owing, moreover, to the fact that the conditions under which Mr. MacDonnell was obliged to carry out his investigation did not permit of his conducting his enquiries on the actual sites of raids, or of his having the opportunity of examining all available witnesses, the information is not such as to enable His Majesty’s Government to make an exact award on each claim submitted. For this reason His Majesty's Government are not in a position to make a detailed estimate as to the amount of loot taken from the nationals of either Government by nationals of the other. infoi mation furnished to His ^Majesty s Government is, however sufficient to enable them to judge that it would be fair and reasonable that all claims referred to them By both Governments concerned should be held to cancel each other out. His Majesty's Government conclude, therefore, that all claims arising from raids between the two countries which took place before the 1st August, 1930, should, on the basis of such cancellation, be held to be settled and conclusively disposed of.” This is His Majesty s Government’s final finding.[273 cc—1] c 9 A month elapsed before a reply was received conveying I bn Baud s reaction from Riadh. It falls to be recorded in the next report. Frontier Line. 32. Survey operations in connexion with the Haifa-Bagdad Railway discovered a small error near Jebel Tubaik in the boundary traced on the southern desert maps of Transjordan to define His Majesty's Government's unilateral declaration of the 19th May, 1927. Brought to the notice of His Majesty s. Government in July, its rectification was called for. Iraq. 33. Relations were undisturbed. 34. Although by the beginning of July both representatives-elect had been named, neither had proceeded by the end of August. The Hejaz-Nejd consul- general-elect, Rushaid Pasha, was apparently awaiting the arrival of his Iraqi opposite number before leaving himself. An enemy of long standing of both Ibn Baud and the Hashimites, Rushaid Pasha is now to represent Ibn Baud in the Hashimite capital. Koweit and Bahrein. 35. Colonel Biscoe and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had a friendly meeting at the Foreign Office on the 21st July, when mention was made of the possibility of Ibn Baud being near the Hasa coast in September and of a visit from Colonels Biscoe and Dickson being arranged (see May-June report, paragraph 33). 36. Two cases of intrusion by officials of Ibn Baud into Koweit territory were reported in August. 37. An uncertain figure passed through Jedda in July, apparently returning to Koweit after some ten months’ stay in the Hejaz as a guest of Ibn Baud. His name was Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif-bin-Abdul Jalil, one time Director of Koweit Customs, decorated at the New Year 1930, convicted for forgery in June, given a letter of recommendation by the political agent in August, and kept hanging about for nearly a year in the Hejaz for a job which never materialised. Yemen and A sir. A sir Communications. 38. Asa result of an exchange of views with the Italian Government on the question of de facto as opposed to de jure recognition of the Saudi status of Asir, raised by the Hejazi Government's request for the establishment of wireless communications between Jizan and Aden and of postal communication between Jizan and Kamaran (see May-June report, paragraph 38), His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was instructed on the 22nd June to reply to the Hejazi note of the 11th March, merely stating that His Majesty's Government agreed to the establishment of wireless communication between Aden and Jizan, detailed arrangements for which would be made by Aden through the Legation, and that they saw no objection to the establishment of postal communication between Kamaran and jizan. On receipt of further instructions in the latter connexion His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires informed the Hejazi Government on the 8th August that it was assumed that the proposed exchange of mails would be made in accordance with the principles of the Universal Postal Convention and subsidiary agreements, so far as these applied. Status of Asir. 39. The political issue of the recognition of the actual status of Asir was met by informing the Italian Government that, in deference to their views (which were strongly anti-recognition of any kind), no formal recognition of Asir’s new status would be conveyed by His Majesty’s Government to the Hejazi Govern ment, but that it was not practical politics to refuse to correspond with them onmatters of practical interest to the country. No mention of the question of recognition, whether de jure or de jacto, was, of course, to be made to the Hejazi Government. Military Affairs. 40. Intelligence reports from Aden ' during August combined to giv 1 ^ warning of a certain degree of activity in the northern Yemen, possibly directed against Asir. Thus, on the 8th August, the report was recorded that the Imam Yahya had raised the pay of all his regular forces by 20 per cent., and authorised a special allowance of 20 per cent, for service in the Tihama, i.e., the coastal belt; on the 15th August that the Imam was organising an expedition against the Dakam Confederation, who were supposed to be giving him trouble in his northern territories; and that on the 25th August an expedition of six companies of regulars was being fitted out at Sana under the Imam’s son, Sword-of-lslam Ahmad, for service in the north. 41. Although the boundary between Asir and the Yemen has never been defined, the Hejazi Government decided in mid-August that it had been violated by the Imam’s troops. As Viceroy of the Hejaz in his father's absence, the Amir Feisal telegraphed instructions on the 18th August to the Amir of Jizan to protest to the Governor of Midi, the Imam's son, against this very evil act, and to demand the punishment of the violators, an apology, withdrawal of the Yemeni advanced posts, the return of thirty hostages (pessimistically described by the Legation's translator as mortgages), and the payment of compensation and blood-money. Apparently, on the 23rd August, although the true date was probably earlier and the transmission via Massawa delayed, Ibn Saud himself telegraphed to the Imam to say that he was told that the latter’s troops had reached Jabal Arwa in Asir, occupied it and taken thirty hostages—but he could not believe it. If, however, it 1 were a fact and ordered by the Imam, then there was neither might nor power save in Allah. The sequel falls to be told in the next report. III. —Relations with States Outside Arabia. British Empire. 42. Sir A. Ryan sailed from Jedda on the 19th July in H.M.S. “Lupin'' for five months leave of absence. Mr. Hope Gill became Charge d'Affaires. 43. Hejazi relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were not strained at any point. Exchanges over Transjordan were rather tiresome, as already recounted in paragraphs 18 to 31, but His Majesty’s Government’s other fosterling, Iraq, gave not a moment's anxiety. 44. The signed Money Order Agreement with Palestine was received from the Hejazi Government in July and transmitted to Jerusalem together with two notes from the Mecca Postmaster-General concerning a typing error in the English version and the settlement of “ interest' on outstanding accounts. 45. The Hejazi Government were reminded in July that the Government of India were still awaiting the revised versions of a similar agreement. The Hejazi debt to the Government of India for arms has already been referred to in paragraph 44^“ M 46. The question of British banking for this country has been dealt with in paragraph 8; matters concerning British personnel in the Hejaz Air Force in paragraphs 66 to 68; and the proposed Arabian air route in paragraphs 69 to 72. 47. The Hejazi Government's co-operation with the Legation for the manumission of slaves is reported in paragraphs 85 to 86. International. 48. Before Sir A. Ryan's departure Fuad Bey Hamza took him for anothei ride on his hobby-horse. He trotted out Hejaz-Nejd and the League of Nations, Hejaz-Nejd and the International Sanitary System, Hejaz-Nejd and the Arms[273 cc—1] c 2 11 Traffic Convention, and a newcomer, Hejaz-Nejd and the Disarmamen Conference. But this time he found Sir. Andrew booted and spurred wit instructions. League of Nations. 49. Fuad Bey was reminded that, in his enquiries of last year he had limited himself to seeking the views of His Ma jesty s Government regarding t le legal position. He was now told that, although it was not for one Government to pronounce on a question which might concern the League as a whole, the matter had been examined in London with a view to giving the Hejaz-Nejd such friendly assistance as was possible. Fuad Bey was given certain conclusions which were to be drawn from the data available as to the character of the union between the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies, and the further conclusions to be deduced therefrom as to the position of Hejaz-Nejd in regard to possible membership of the League. Asked as to whether his Government had made up their minds to seek admission to the League or were merely exploring the possibility, Fuad intimated that no decision had been taken; they were merely looking into the matter. International Sanitary System. 50. Three definite points emerged: (a) If the Hejaz-Nejd Government wished to attach reservations to their ratification of the International Sanitary Convention of 1926 they could only do so with the previous consent of all States signatory or accessory to the convention. For this purpose, it would be necessary for them to communicate the proposed reservations to the French Government for transmission to those States. (5) The question ot obtaining a seat on the Alexandria Quarantine Board was one, the decision of which rested with the Egyptian Government, (c) The Hejaz-Nejd Government might find it advantageous to accede to the Rome Convention of 190/ and thereby acquire the right to representation on the Committee of the International Office of Public Health at Paris. The official action necessary would be to notify the Italian Government in accordance with article 6 of the convention. 51. Fuad Bey was warned in friendly fashion that it was really most desirable to work up a good sanitary administration in this country. At the same time, he was reminded that other countries would continue to protect themselves, within the limits of international arrangements, against the special dangers arising from the dispersal of the large numbers of possible disease carriers brought together by the pilgrimage. Arms Traffic Convention. 52. Fuad Bey was told that the purely technical difficulties in the way of the accession of a non-signatory State before the convention came into force were probably not insuperable, but that, regarded as a practical proposition, it seemed doubtful whether the accession of any particular non-signatory State, which saw T advantage in making itself a party'to the convention and thereby undertaking the onerous obligations which it would impose when it came into force, would at present amount to more than a demonstration ot sympathy with the objects of the convention. So many signatory States had delayed ratification that it could only be regarded as doubtful whether the convention would come into force in the near future, if indeed it ever did come into force without amendment. These views were given as personal to Sir A. Ryan and were balanced with the object of avoiding any appearance of seeking to influence the Hejaz-Nejd Government’s decision. They, of course, are chiefly concerned with removing the supposed stigma attaching to the inclusion of Arabia in one of the k£ special zones.' Disarmament Conference. 53. Fuad Bey complained that the Hejaz-Nejd had not been invited, although all sorts of Powers non-members of the League had received invitations. He mentioned pointedly Egypt and Iraq. This matter Sir A. Ryan referred home, and Mr. Hope Gill was instructed in August, should Fuad Bey again raise4 12 the matter, to tell him that His Majesty’s Government had not been consulted as to whether the Hejaz-Nejd should be invited or not, the matter of invitations having been left entirely to the Secretariat of the League. Fuad Bey did raise the question and received his answer. He made no further attempt to enlist the interest of His Majesty’s Government. * Orientalists and Municipalities. 54. The Hejaz-Nejd were, nevertheless, invited by the Dutch Government in July to send a representative to the International Conference of Orientalists at Leiden, and by His Majesty's Government in August to appoint official delegates to the 1932 Fifth International Congress of Local Authorities, in London; they were also requested to tell their local authorities about this congress. There is no one really clever enough, and no one rich enough was found, to go to Leiden. As for the Congress of 1932, the meantime is no doubt being spent in pondering the European entanglements and spiritual dangers to be faced, if municipal pilgrims from the Holy Places of Islam are to seek the electric light in the West. France. 55. The treaty negotiations have not yet produced the treaty (see May-June report, paragraph 44). Italy. 56. Nor have the Italian consul's treaty hopes been fulfilled (see May-June report, paragraph 56). He went on leave on the 19th July having failed, for the second year in succession, to take the treaty with him. 57. ” A little, but very virulent, anti-Italian propaganda has been circulating in the Hejaz in the form of pamphlets introduced from Syria They are inspired by the Kufra incident of the early summer. The Netherlands. 58. The Netherlands Charge d'Affaires at Jedda, M. Van der Meulen, returned to Jedda from the Hadhramaut (see May-June report, paragraph 46) on about 10th July, and left finally on the 17th July. 59. The following Hejazi appointments abroad were announced in July :— Sheikh Hafiz Wahba to be Ibn Sand’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at The Hague; Sheikh Abdullah Ibrahim-al-Fadhl to be First Secretary in charge of the Hejaz-Nejd Legation at The Hague; Sayyid Hamza-al-Ghouth to be Hejaz-Nejd consul in Batavia. 60. Hejazi negotiations for a Dutch loan have been reported in paragraph 9. Egypt. 61. Hafiz Amer Bey made several visits during July and August to Mecca and Taif, presumably to continue discussion of matters affecting the Mahmal {see May-June report, paragraph 48). 62. Sidky Pasha made a statement in the Cairo Chamber of Deputies on the 13th July in regard to the practice of sending the Mahmal. accompanied with large consignments of cash and corn, annually to the Hejaz. He traced the reasons why it was discontinued and averred that the Egyptian Government 'would be glad to be in a position to distribute these alms to the poor of Mecca and Medina, as in the past, as soon as the causes of disagreement with the Hejazi Government disappeared. Soviet Russia. 63. The Soviet Minister’s efforts in working up the sale of petroleum products (see May-June report, paragraph 51) resulted in the signature in August of a £30,000 contract for benzine from Batum. Details of the deal have been given in paragraph 10.United States of America. 64. As already mentioned in paragraph 12, Mr. Twitchell is expected to return in October with six American prospectors. It is understood that the 5|Iejazi Government have managed to remit £300 for their passages, when they arrive and begin work they will no doubt expect something in the way of salary. It is a pity that there is no American representative here to help them to get it. Turkey. 65. The Turkish Charge d'Alfaires at dedda, Abdul Ghani Seni Bey, left finally on the 30th July for Angora, where he was to be made head of the Arabian section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No successor had arrived by the end of August. IV.—Am Matters. Hejaz Air Force. 66. Messrs. Morris and North finally got away on the 18th July (see May- June report, paragraph 57). Orders to pay them their arrears and passage money had apparently been given from Mecca on about the 20th June, but no trace of them could be discovered in Jedda until the end of the month. A further fort night was required to find the £500 in golden sovereigns and bankers’ credits, without which Messrs. Morris and North declined to leave the country. 67. There only remained Mr. Lowe. He was shocked to find one morning in July that the aerodrome guard had orders to refuse him admittance. This he attributed to base intrigue by the German Krakowsky (see May-June report, paragraph 55), and came to pour out his woes to the Legation. He was told that having taken service under a foreign Government and played his own game, he must make the best of its ways and the rules, but that if on a straight issue he was being unjustly treated as regards contractual conditions such as pay, he would be given a reasonable measure of assistance as a British subject. He returned at the end of the month to ask for a loan of £10, but as it was found that he had made no real effort to obtain arrears amounting to some £150 due to him, he was advised to take all possible steps himself, before throwing himself on the Legation’s assistance. The Hejazi Government informed him on the 8th August that they did not wish to renew his contract and that he could take the terminal leave due to him on the 15th August. The miserable specimen at once yearned to re-enter their service, and at the end of the month signed a clandestine contract with the Turkish corporal who acts as Hejazi Director-General of Military Affairs, binding himself to impossible terms for a further twelvemonth. He was eventually got rid of in September—a matter for the next report. 68. The Hejazi proposals for the reorganisation of their air force personnel having received His Majesty's Government’s consideration (see May-June report, paragraph 56) His Majesty’s Minister conveyed to them the Air Ministry’s views in a memorandum dated the 7th July. No reply was received by the end of August. Arabian Air Route. 69. In the House of Lords debate of the 23rd June on air communications with the East, the Under-Secretary of State for Air said : Meanwhile, we are pushing on with the examination of an alternative route along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf, that is, along the Arabian coast This is being actively explored. Both land and marine aircraft of the Royal Air Force have been making flights of increasing frequency from Basra to Muscat, thus acting as pioneers for ultimate civil development.” 70. On the 7th July His Majesty’s Minister tackled Fuad Bey Hamza in regard to the exact meaning of the last sentence of the Hejazi memorandum of the 18th June (see May-June report, paragraph 60). His reply showed clearly14 that what they had in mind was a contract of some kind similar to the one believed to have been made with the Persian Government by Imperial Airways, kdr A. Ryan s impression was that the Hejazi Government were trying to discover what could be got out of His Majesty’s Government and/or Imperial Airways before committing themselves. He thought that Ibn Sand's recent tendency to conciliate extreme Wahhabi opinion was probably not without effect on the^p position, however, lor the Nejdi ulema might well dislike anv truck with foreign aeroplanes in Nejd. 71. At the end of August His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires was posted with information as to the latest developments connected with the proposed Arabian air route, in case the matter were pursued with the Hejazi Government. The position had been somewhat altered since the beginning of the year (see January-February report, paragraph 45) by the proposal of Imperial Airways to use flying-boats instead of land-planes in the event of their transferring the Persian Gulf section of their air service to India to the Arabian coast of the Gulf. I he acquisition of facilities for land-planes on the Hasa coast was, therefore, no longer of immediate importance, in so far as Imperial Airways were concerned. No question of a contract between them and the Heiazi Government was thus likely to arise. 72. British aircraft using the Hasa coast would, therefore, for the present be likely to be almost exclusively military. The facilities which His Majesty's Government desired to secure for such aircraft remained as before, namely, the provision of emergency landing grounds on the Hasa coast and an assurance that, if British aircraft were compelled in emergency to enter and alight on Nejdi territory or in Nejdi territorial waters, they would be treated in accordance with the usual rules of international courtesy and their occupants with ordinary humanity. V.— Military Matters. Northern Hejaz. 73. There was unrest and movement in the north throughout July and in August. The Beni Atiya, who lay northernmost of the Hejazi tribes, were apparently given ccorte blanche by Ibn Saud to prevent defections to Transjordan of dissatisfied elements among the Hejazi tribes further south. Even officials v&gt; ere reported as having deserted, the Amir of A1 'Ula, Sheikh Ismail Qazaz, and a Nejdi officer of regulars, named Hammami, amongst them. The Beni Atiya seem to have interpreted their role in a liberal sense, and to have raided the Aniza, Billi and Harb to some purpose, while the Amirs of Dhaba and Tabuk looked on. In early July Mr. Philby tried to make his way as far as Tabuk, with a pair of the new Marconi mobile sets, for testing purposes, and to spy out the land, but he was not allowed further north than A! ’Ula. By August Captain Glubb of the Transjordan frontier police considered that there was a possibility of Ibn Saud ordering Ibn Musa’id, his Amir of.Hail, into the Northern Hejaz with his Shammar to restore order, with probable complications in the shape of a mass Beni Atiya withdrawal into Transjordan for refuge. 74. In the middle of July, however, Ibn Saud sent his kinsman, Abdullah-as-Sudairi, as Amir to Tabuk with a dozen cars, Nejdi troops, and four lorries-full of arms and ammunition, as well as a camel-gun, probably the 47-mm. Pocisk presented to Ibn Saud by Poland in August last year. On arrival he seems to have concerted action with the Amir of Dhaba, who had a force of 100 camelmen at his disposal, to overawe the northern tribes. Having apparently succeeded in restoring internal order, he turned his attention to the frontier and carried out motor-patrols near Mudawwara. Captain Glubb has since reported that the Transjordan police posts are being answered post for post on the other side of the frontier by the northern Amirs of Tabuk and Jauf. The latter, Turki-as-Sudairi, cousin to him of Tabuk and successor of the notorious an-Nashmi, was said in August to have five machine guns, some 600 rifles, and about 160.000 rounds of s.a.a. Young Ibn Abdul Wahid has been appointed Amir of Qaryat-al-Milh, vice Abdullah-al-Hawasi, an old man and peaceful. Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd, Ibn Sand’s Controller of Beduin and frontier representa tive at Qaryat, was reported in August to have fifty men and rifles and four lorries.East (Nejd). 75. There were vague reports of “ trouble in Nejd ' throughout July and August, but nothing resulted. There seemed no doubt, however, that the tribes were being more strictly taxed than usual, probably thanks to Ibn Saud's presence, which would account for a certain feeling of unrest. Bedouin, anxious for z^Jargesse, camped in considerable numbers round Riadh. South [A sir). 76. The trouble simmering on the Asiri frontier with the Yemen has been described in paragraphs 40 and 41. VII. —Naval Matters. 77. H.M.S. “Lupin ” (Captain E. B. C. Dicken) visited Jedda for a few hours on the 19th July to embark His Majesty’s Minister on his departure on leave. There were no other naval visits, British or other. 78. On the 11th July His Majesty’s Minister submitted to His Majesty's Government his views on the advisability of the more frequent visits by His Majesty’s ships to ports in the Hejaz and Asir desired by the Admiralty. No hnal decision was communicated before the end of August. VII.— Pilgrimage. 79. The debris of the 1931 pilgrimage from India was cleared away on the 13th July, when 318 destitutes were repatriated at Government of India’s expense (see May-June report, paragraph 68). This figure, out of a total of only 7,000 Indian pilgrims, compared badly with the figures for 1930, namely, 387 destitutes among 11,000 pilgrims. 80. British West African pilgrims seeking to return to Africa by the customary desert route to Lith and sanbuq voyage to Massowa met with great difficulties and hardship, which in August began to cause a reflux and destitution. The necessity for their repatriation was being studied locally at the end of August. 81. A vast amount of head- and paper-work was done by His Majesty’s Minister between the end of the pilgrimage and his departure on leave, covering the thousand and one points raised by the Indian Haj Inquiry Committee’s report. Detailed memoranda and despatches on all current issues were submitted to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India by the beginning of August, in good time for consideration before the 1932 pilgrimage begins. VIII.— Slavery. 82. The last report omitted to record the number of slaves manumitted by the Legation. Two males were freed in May, two males and one female in June, one male and two females in July, and three males and two females in August. All were repatriated via Port Sudan, except the last two females, whom it was found possible to have manumitted locally by a willing owner, and two of the males freed in August; these were sent via Jibuti to Addis Ababa (see paragraphs 84 and 85). 83. The increasing difficulties of shipping manumitted Abyssinian slaves to Massowa for repatriation (see March-April report, paragraph 64) came to a head in July, when the Eritrean authorities communicated impossible terms through the Italian consul in Jedda. These terms effectively closed the Massowa v oute. 84. Luckily the Abyssinian Government were induced by His Majesty’s Legation at Addis Ababa to interest themselves in the liberation and repatriation T two Ethiopian boys sold while on pilgrimage, one of whom succeeded in16 escaping to this Legation. They were repatriated in August direct to Jibuti and may serve to mark this route for regular use for this purpose in future. 85. For the first time in its life the Hejazi Government co-operated with His Majesty’s Government and implemented article 7 of the Jedda Treaty of 1927. They sought out the other boy in Mecca, held courts of enquiry, sent him to the Legation for repatriation, and followed him up with a full report plus a request that the Abyssinian Government be invited to force their slave-trading subject to refund £80, the proceed of his sale to his Hejazi client. 86. There was less inclination shown in investigating a case that had a similar complexion and concerned one of the Sanusi family, who came on pilgrimage from the Sudan and was remarked to have returned there without two of his black attendants. Pressed, however, by His Majesty’s Minister, huad Bey Hamza made enquiries and reported in July that the two had left Mecca for Lith and Massowa, which tallied with the Legation's independent information. IX. —Miscellaneous. Visitors. 87. His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur paid a rapid visit to the Holy Places of Islam in July. Mr. Twitched visited Jedda again at the end of July. His work has already been referred to in paragraph 12. Marconi’s expert, Mr. Boucicault, left Jedda at the beginning of August to rig wireless at Tabuk, but at the end of August he still lay half-way, at Wejh, kicking his heels and calling for petrol. Staff. 88. Sir A. Ryan went on leave on the 19th July. Mr. Hope Gill became Charge d’Affaires. Mr. Furlonge was given a fortnight’s sick-leave on the 26th August to recuperate at Erkowit in the Sudan. The second archivist, Captain Lewis, left on the 23rd July for two months’ special leave in England. 89. Before leaving His Majesty's Minister drafted his detailed recom mendations to the Government of India for the complete reorganisation of the Indian and medical sections of the Legations, with a view to its taking effect as from the 1st January, 1932.

Ibn Saud. THE King projected a .further visit to Jedda on the 23rd May. Owing to his many preoccupations in Mecca, he did not actually come to Jedda until the 14th June. He went back on the 17th June to prepare for his long-projected visit to Nejd. He left for Riadh on the 28th June, and is expected to stay there for several months, possibly until the approach of the next pilgrimage. This will be his first long stay in Nejd since he arrived in Mecca on the 30th April last year, as his visit to Riadh last December—January was greatly curtailed. [5886]' B2 Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. We have got back to the bad position of last year. The Amir Feisal remains Minister, but performs none of the duties of his office as such. Fuad Bey Hamza continues to be the working Minister, but spends little time in Jedda. He was there from the 9th to the 11th May, the 27th to the 30th May and the 11th to the 18th June. He went to Taif immediately after the King’s departure for Riadh on the 28th June. So far as the British Legation is concerned infrequency and shortness of Fuad Bey’s visits have not caused as much incon venience as formerly, the slate having been pretty clean as regards current business during the period under review. Finance. 3. After the pilgrimage the financial situation became more or less desperate. Money is still found somehow for urgent requirements, eg., the King’s visit to Nejd, but whatever gold reserve there was is believed to be practically exhausted and it has become more and more a matter of hand-to-mouth expedients. The relations between the Government and the Dutch Bank were still obscure early in May, but it later became evident that the bank would do no more to help the Government either by bolstering up the exchange or by lending money. The National Conference, which sat in June (see paragraph 19), had no solution to offer. It helped to give coherence to the growing volume of discontent which has become more or less articulate on two points, viz., the excessive amount of money spent abroad, much of it on luxury articles like motor-cars, and the extent to which the Hejaz is mulcted for the support of Nejd. The King had no ear for suggestions that the country should have a proper budget and that Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, his Director-General of Finance,, w'as the source of all evil. His Majesty’s mind has turned more and more on the possibility of getting an outside bank to come to his help. 4. It is suggested that a bank might be found to provide £200,000 in return for certain privileges like a position resembling that of a State bank, a monopoly of banking operations and the right to issue notes. It is said that offers have been made by the Amir Lutfullah, a rich Syrian in Egypt, who played a role in Hejazi financial affairs during the last agony of the Hashimite regime. He has main tained some sort of an agency in Jedda and an underling of his visited Jedda early in June, ostensibly to clear up a difficulty about the lease of a house. The Banque Misr is also said to be disposed to do business. The King would probably hate to get money from Egypt, if it could be got elsewhere. In his statement to Sir A. Ryan on the 13th June (see paragraph 41), Fuad Bey harked back to the time when His Majesty’s Government had subsidised Ibn Saud as well as King Hussein. When the King received Sir A. Ryan on the 17th June he did not refer to this, but asked whether His Majesty’s Government could help him to bring in a British concern to undertake the duties of a State hank. He named no names, but may have had in mind the Eastern Bank, or possibly Lloyds. He spoke of having had other offers and asked for an early answer to his request to His Majesty’s Government. Sir A. Ryan telegraphed the request to London on the 19th June, but no reply was received up to the 30th June. Before Sir A. Ryan was approached, a strong appeal had been made to the Acting Dutch Charge d'Affaires, on the eve of his departure for Holland, to induce the Netherlands Government to persuade the principals of the Dutch Bank to be more accommodating. 5. Fresh efforts were made early in May (see March-April report, para graph 5) to rehabilitate the exchange. One expedient was to raise a sort of forced loan in nickel with a view to reducing the volume of it in the market. The money changers’ shops were closed down about the same time. Little has since been heard about nickel, but the silver rival, after vicissitudes, settled into a steady decline in June and at the end of the month stood at about 14 riyals to the £, as against the official rate of 10. One of the remedies contemplated for restoring the value of the silver and nickel currency is to generalise its use throughout the whole of Ibn Sand’s dominions. The King spoke hopefully about this scheme to Sir A. Ryan on the 17th June. He is said to have hit on the plan of giving his largess to the Nejdi tribes in riyals and to have taken a large quantity of them to Riadh for the purpose.i' m 6. Meanwhile the authorities themselves have recognised the depreciation to the extent of requiring a 25 per cent, surcharge on telegrams paid for in silver. This measure is not unreasonable in itself, as the rates are fixed on a gold franc basis. Nevertheless it is an admission that silver is at a discount, despite official proclamations to the contrary. 7. These troubles have not reacted seriously on any British interest. The Monthly payments to the Eastern Telegraph Company have, however, again fallen into arrear since the end of February. The Government of India claim remains in the same position as that described in paragraph 4 of the last report. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., doing a varied business on cautious lines, have continued to get on nicely, but found things very slack by the end of June. The Iraqi representative of a Bombay house, with connexions in the United Kingdom, who came to Jedda some time ago to collect outstandings from the Government said to amount to from £3.000 to £4,000, actually got £1,000 down in June and what he considered an acceptable arrangement for a later settlement of the balance. Economic 8. The second tour of Mr. Twitched (March-April report, paragraphs 6 and 66) enabled him to visit a considerable coastal area north of Jedda. He is said to have travelled 3,500 kilom. in all. On his return early in May, a pleasant flutter was created by the announcement that he had located a rich petroleum field near A1 Muwaila (? the place of that name not far from the southern end of the Gulf of Aqaba), a thoroughly good gold mine and traces of lead near Wejh, and lots and lots of water. The petroleum and gold are believed to have been known before. Little has been heard of them since Mr. Twitched, having completed his report, went back to the Yemen. His report on water has been published in extenso in the “ Umm-al-Qura.” It is of considerable interest, not so much as revealing the existence of previously unknown sources, but as giving a fairly precise account of the water available in the region round about Jedda and Wadi Fatima. Mr. Twitched makes various suggestions as to how the water might be raised, dammed underground, &amp;c., and as to how it might be utilised for increased cultivation, and to supply Jedda more cheaply and plentifully than it is at present. He writes, perhaps, with some eye to American business, e.q in windmills, and suggests that the competent department in Washington might be asked for advice as to crops, seeds, &amp;c. 9. Economic development is in the air, but it is doubtful how far Ibn Saud and his advisers will face up to the spade-work and the need for foreign experts, not merely to make surveys but to direct exploitation. Meanwhile, according to Mr. Philby. the Hejazi Government have got into touch with Messrs. Madian (Limited), and it was announced in the Stockholm press in May, apparently with truth, that they (the Hejazi Government) had invited the Swedish Government to send a geological mission to prospect for minerals, especially oil and coal. It was further announced in the £ ‘ Dagens Nyheter ” of the 28th May that the Swedish Government had acceded subject to certain conditions, and that if these were accepted an expedition of four persons, headed by a M. E. Nordstrom, would leave for the Hejaz in August. His Majesty’s Minister at Stockholm obtained confirmation of this report at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. When Sir A. Ryan mentioned the matter to Fuad Bey Hamza in June, the latter was coy but not denying. Marconi Wireless Installation. 10. The bulk of the material to be supplied under the contract of last October (September-November report, section I, 5) was delivered in Jedda in April and May. M. Boucicault, a technical expert employed by the Marconi Company, arrived on the 21st May, together with an Egyptian Moslem subordinate named Ibrahim-al-Kurdi. A start was made with the mobile sets, one of which was mounted just outside Jedda. Communication was successfully established with the existing station at Jedda and with another mobile set at Mecca. There was some difficulty at first in communicating with Medina. This was clearly due to defective equipment or handling at the old station there, but the King was angry and girded at Mr. Philby. The latter went off himself to [5886] ^ ‘ B 24 Medina in June with a third mobile set and the Egyptian expert. Communica tion was then established, and it is understood that the party were able to communicate successfully from as far north as A1 Ula. 11. It had been intended that M. Boucicault should erect the central station at Riadh, and that the Egyptian expert, having seen him do it, should then erect the station at Mecca. This rational plan broke down on a decision of the Kiner not to have M. Boucicault at Riadh. His theory is that, if the Egyptian can dpi Mecca he can do Riadh. Meanwhile, the King’s principal desire appears to be to get the station at Qariyat started as soon as possible, doubtless for reasons connected with the Transjordan frontier situation. 12. On the whole all went well, though slowly, up to the end of June. There is perhaps some reason to apprehend that Ibn Saud will be disappointed m the range of the smaller stations, especially if he is counting on an extensive use of the wireless for telephony, to which it is admirably suited, but for shorter distances than can be telegraphed over. A nti-Locust Measures. 13. hollowing on the failure of the steps taken last year (July-August report, section I, 3 (b)) to induce Ibn Saud to let the International Bureau at Damascus send a mission to Nejd, the Committee of the Bureau adopted in February a suggestion that the way for future action might be prepared by inviting the Hejaz-Nejd Government to adhere to the convention of the 20th May, 1926, in pursuance of which the bureau was created. The French Charg6 d Ahaires at Jedda conveyed this proposal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 30th April. His Majesty s Minister, having been instructed to act in conjunction with his Irench colleague, wrote a suitable note on similar lines on the 10th June. No reply was received up to the end of June. Legislation. . ^J le Emm-al-Qura of the 12th June published a report on the activities of the Legislative Council, since its recognition last year up to the end ot A H. 1349 (about mid-May 1931). The council furnishes a list of thirty-two regulations issued and thirty important decisions taken, out of a total number ot about /00. Perhaps the most interesting item in the report is a list of fifteen budgets, including those of certain administrations at Mecca and Jedda and a number of provincial governorates. This affords an indication that although there is no published general budget, some attempt is made at budgeting in petto oi paiticulai puiposes. According to Mr. Philby there was in the spring some thing of a sti uggle between the Legislative Council and the Director-General of I inance, and the Council had the courage to resist a pretension of Abdullah buleiman to throw off all control save that of the King. Ap regulations, &amp;c., issued in the Hejaz is becoming considerable. It is very difficult to keep track of them because, while many arS published in the Umm-al-Qura, there is no regular or coherent system of promulgation Fuad Bey Hamza told Sir A. Ryan in June that a volume of existing regulations was m preparation. This would be a great boon 16. Among the regulations published in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” during May-June was one on the trade in fire-arms and carrying of fire-arms by private persons. The regulation introduces a licensing system for both purposes. General. i Economic depression, financial stress, and possibly obscurer political or tribal political causes, promoted during the period under review the growth of an uncertain and potentially dangerous internal situation. Discontent and nervousness were widespread in Mecca and Jedda, and made them more than ever sounding boards for rumours of trouble elsewhere. Anxious eyes without telescopes are fixed on the Transjordan frontier and on the country south east of it, even as far as Medina. Anxious ears are open to every sort of report however fantastic. ‘‘Jauf has fallen,” people hear, but no one can tell who knocked it down or who picked it up. “ An-Neshmi has gone over from the Kins' to the enemy ; a portent, but to w r hat enemy is not stated “ Pamphlets are being scattered from aeroplanes; so-and-so’s slave is said to have said that he saw them with his own eyes at Medina”; but what aeroplanes or whose pamphlets must remain a mystery.wmm wrmm ■HHM \ \ 5 18. ihe importance of the rumours lies, not in their individual value, for i those ^ that are easiest to check are the most palpably absurd, but in their prevalence and persistency. Whether or no there is real trouble around places like Jauf and Hail, or in Asir, there is an uneasy general situation, which a strong push from any quarter might make critical. Up to the end of June, however, there was nothing to point to the possibility of such a push, or of there ^ 3m o anyone to administer it. Rumours of Shereehan activity were put about m some quarters, but there was no reason to suppose that they ^ad any substance. 19. Ihe King himself became increasingly conscious after the pilgrimage that things were in a bad way. Towards the end of May he decided to convoke an assembly of representatives of the principal Hejazi towns to advise on a wide range of current affairs. It was announced that he was in personal touch with the Bedouin, and that he now wished, in accordance with the best Islamic traditions of consultation with wise and thoughtful men, to enable the people of the towns to give expression to their views. An assembly of elected urban representatives would be held annually in the month following the pilgrimage. This apparently important constitutional innovation was not introduced by any published organic regulation, nor was it clear who were to be the electors. Elections, however, took place, and a “National Conference’’ of town notables and representatives of the ulema, with various official personages added, sat from the 2nd to the 11th June. Certain parliamentary forms were observed. The King made a speech and the conference produced a loyal address. They formed three committees to consider different sections of the agenda. A good deal was published, and it would appear that many subjects were discussed. The capital subject was naturally finance. Some delegates were bold enough to proclaim the necessity for a budget, and to attack the administration of the present Director-General (see paragraph 3 above). The King is said to have met the first suggestion with an answer amounting to “ le budget, c’est moi ”; and the position of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman remained unimpaired. 20. In the situation described above the lack of capable men is more than ever felt. In this connexion, mention may be made of a curious incident. An ex-Turkish officer of Syrian and remoter Yemeni origin, named Tewfik Sherif Bey, has been much in evidence in the Hejaz at various times in recent years. He is an itinerant soldier of fortune, with political aspirations and a' wide radius of action. He came from India just before the 1931 pilgrimage, in the company of the well-known Indian Wahhabi, Ismail Ghuznavi, and soon after made his peace with the King, with whom he had fallen out last year. It was supposed that he would receive employment. He suddenly disappeared, however, and it was discovered that he had embarked surreptitiously in a pilgrim ship sailing for India on the 14th June. This incident, which seems to have created a little panic in high circles, is worth recording, because the man is intelligent, though restless and volatile, and it illustrates the King’s difficulty in binding to him men of even moderate value, except a handful of people of the Fuad Hamza and Hafiz Wahba type, and a tail of subservient Hejazis and untrained Nejdis. 21. Reference was made in paragraph 10 of the January-February report, and paragraph 8 of the March-April report, to the growing signs of a iendency on the part of Ibn Sand to work out the future of his country on the basis of greater toleration in the Hejaz, a relaxation of some of the stricter Wahhabi doctrines in Nejd itself, and an unification of the two. This policy encountered a set-back in June. It was announced in the “ Umm-al-Qiira ” of the 26th June that the Ulema of Nejd had remonstrated with the King on the repetition this year (see January-February report, paragraph 8) of the accession day celebrations instituted in 1930, and that the King had deferred to their view The remonstrance of the ulema, a long letter which admitted that there mio-ht have been political reasons for the first celebration, but denounced recurrm^ celebrations as un-Islamic, was published, as was the King’s gracefully penitent ; * reply. It became known at the same time that the regulations against vicious practices were to be enforced more vigorously, and that the former Committees of Public Virtue were to be reconstituted, though apparently with a different allocation of duties between them and the municipalities. The committees were to see to the regular saying of the five daily prayers. The public sale and smoking of tobacco were to be repressed, although it may still be imported There was to be a round-up of gramophones and their accessories. Part at leastof this programme was brought into operation at once. It was said, at the end of June, that gramophone needles could only be bought in Jedda from the police, rather to the advantage of the members of the public taking the risk, as the police, selling a confiscated article sub rosa, let the needles go cheap. Virtue has come into its own again, and vice deserves the little bit of silver lining in the cloud, which may, nevertheless, weigh heavily on the Hejaz, if the new policy persisted in. The reassertion of Nejdi principles in a Hejaz in which discontent is becoming articulate, cannot be for the ultimate good of Ibn Sand or anyone else. 22. The affair of the chauffeurs, which it was convenient to deal with in this section of the March-April report (paragraphs 9-13), was disposed of in May. Fuad Bey Hamza devised a combination whereby the British and British-protected persons involved should ask a Royal prince to intercede for them with the King. Whether by this means or not. he procured the release of the ten men, each of whom received a moderate sum of money. At least six of them have since left the country of their own accord. II.— Frontier Questions. Transjordan. Raiding. 23. There was a fair amount of further correspondence between Mecca, Jedda and Jerusalem about particular raids, but it related to raids previous to May, including a small number to which the respective Governments had not previously drawn attention. No raids were reported up to the end of June as having occurred in May or June. The following is a statement of raids alleged up to date to have been committed from January to April inclusive, including those which first came to the notice of the Legation during the period now under review :— From Transjordan into Hejaz-Nejd— Six raids, including the loss of 183 camels, one man killed, four wounded. 620 riyals stolen, one rifle lost and four houses attacked. Damage not specified in one case. From Hejaz-Nejd into Transjordan— Three raids, involving the loss of seven camels, three policemen killed, kit, &amp;c., stolen. Damage not specified in one case. Two other cases mentioned in which raids were attempted, but were apparently abortive. 24. The meagreness of the foregoing statement shows that, so far as actual raiding goes, there has been nothing seriously alarming in the situation during the first half of 1931. The Hejazi Government showed some zeal in connexion with the murderous attack on the Transjordan police patrol on the 30th March (March-April report, paragraph 14). They would appear to have rounded up the raiders and they informed the Legation on the 22nd June that Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeid had been ordered to hand over the effects and camels of the police partv, but they did not state what punishment had been inflicted. This point is beino- pursued* On the same date, the 22nd June, the Minister for Foreign Affairs complained in very vague terms to the Legation of raids into Hejaz-Nejd by Syrians operating from Transjordan. This complaint was passed on to the High Commissioner. General Frontier Situation. 25 The proposed preliminary meeting between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeid took place on the 3rd or 4th June at Hazim Wells on the Transjordan side of the frontier. It was apparently friendly, although Ibn Zeid was unable to commit himself to anything definite without reference to Ibn Saud. It was arranged that the two representatives should continue to maintain direct communication. It is not known in Jedda whether it has been possible in this connexion to bring into operation the arrangements made in April for the use of the Jauf wireless station. No precise particulars of what passed had reached the Legation up to the 30th June.7 ymJ 26. The exchange of views regarding the main meeting for the settlement or all matters connected with raids since the 1st August, 1930, proceeded voluminously to a slow tempo. Ibn Saud's attitude was affected by his internal difficulties, and from early in May onward he became somewhat more accommo dating. An adequate assurance was obtained from him regarding arrangements for the mutual restoration of loot in pursuance of decisions resulting from the Glubb-Ibn Zeid meeting. It was agreed that both sides should denounce raiding, X)t only during the meeting, but for all time, by proclamations to be made public by local Governors. It was intended that the proclamations should be simul taneous and it was hoped that they might be identical. This w’as defeated by the zeal of the King, who issued on the 14th May a warning to his tribes, apparently drafted by himself, in the finest “Off with your heads! style. Transjordan had prepared a more normally-worded announcement, which was eventually published on the 30th May. The Hejazi Government, not under standing that the delay was due to unsuccessful efforts at synchronisation, smelt rats. Sir A. Ryan administered eau de Cologne as a reagent. 27. Two other points remained, the question whether, and under what conditions, tribal sheikhs might be heard, and the question of the surrender of “ raiding criminals. It was eventually agreed to treat the latter separately and only the question of witnesses remained. In May Ibn baud relented, at first somewhat ambiguously, to the extent of agreeing that the sheikhs might be heard by the representatives jointly in cases where it was necessary, subject to sale- guards against any of them who might defy his authority being allowed to seek refuge in Transjordan. To cut a long story short, agreement was finally reached on the following formula :— ‘ ‘ The two Governments have agreed that the sheikhs should appear before the representatives to give evidence and to make statements on matters in regard to which the two representatives consider it necessary that such evidence and statements should be taken direct, subject to the condition that, if one of these sheikhs should refuse to obey the orders of his Government and should attempt to take refuge in the country of which he is not a national, the Government of that country will do everything in its power to apprehend and hand him over to his own Government, this condition will apply equally in the case of any such sheikh taking refuge in a third country if, being a Hejaz-Nejd national, he should subsequently enter Transjordan territory, or, being a Transjordan national, he should subsequently enter Hejaz-Nejd territory.' This removed the last obstacle to the main meeting between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid In a note dated the 18th June, His Majesty's Minister conveyed a suggestion by His Majesty's Government that they should be lett to arrange the place and date between themselves. The Minister for loreign Affairs concurre in a reply of the 21st June and said that Ibn Zeid was being instructed to go to the meeting on receipt of an invitation from Captain Glubb, but Fuad Bey Hamza asked simultaneously that this invitation should be held back for some days, in order to enable Ibn Zeid to receive instructions which had been sent by car from 28. The question of the surrender of “ raiding criminals had meanwhile been floated off into a separate correspondence. On the 16th May Sir A. Ryan communicated to the Hejazi Government a draft formula which had been drafted in London and slightly modified in consultation with Sir J. C hancellor and himself. It ran as follows :— “ Heiazi or Nejdi nationals, who have taken part in raids in Irans- iordan territory and have returned to Hejaz-Nejd, and who attempt to escape from penalties imposed on them for raiding by fleeing into Irans- iordan, will, if possible, be prevented, upon direct notification of their names and other available particulars by the Hejaz-Nejd frontier authorities to the corresponding Transjordan authorities, from crossing the frontier into Transjordan. If they enter Transjordan, the Transjordan authorities will, on receiving the necessary information from the Hejaz-Nejd authorities, use their best endeavours'to prevent them from remaining in Transjordan and, if possible, to expel them into Hejaz-Nejd.0 8 I his undertaking is given on the understanding that the authorities in Hejaz-Nejd will deal in the same manner with Transjordan raiding criminals in similar circumstances. This undertaking may be terminated either by the Hejaz-Nejd Government or by the Transjordan Government on two months’ notice, and shall thereafter apply only to those raiding criminals who have crossed the frontier before its termination.” The liejazi Government welcomed this proposal as a great contribution tc improved frontier conditions, but suggested three alterations so considerable as to require prolonged consideration. Inter alia they objected to words so elastic as if possible, &amp;c. At the end of June His Majesty’s Government were still considering their attitude in consultation with Sir J. Chancellor, and were contemplating the possibility of something in the nature of an extradition treaty as an alternative to a “ formula,” as well as the possibility of one or other being negotiated by a special delegation from Transjordan. Meanwhile, the Hejazi Government had not pressed the matter. 29. In a general way there was, during the period under review, a change in the Hejazi attitude towards more conciliation and a certain anxiety to clear the slate on the Transjordan frontier. They seemed to be positively keen on the Glubb-Ibn Zeid meeting, and they intimated a strong desire that His Majesty’s Government should make their promised award on the earlier raids which Mr. MacDonnell investigated last year. This did not prevent them from indulging in one or two characteristic boutades. They had on the 5th April accused the Transjordan authorities of violating their frontier with cars and aeroplanes. After due investigation a reasoned and conciliatorv reply, rebutting the accusations, was returned on the 13th May. The Minister for Foreign Affairs retorted on the 18th May with a petulant and still unsubstantiated reassertion of the previous accusations. On receipt of a suitable rejoinder pressing mildly for particulars he did not pursue the matter. On the 3rd June, however, he poured all the Hejazi spite against Captain Glubb into a note enumerating various misdeeds alleged against that officer. No reply had been returned up to the 30th June. 30. A pleasant note was struck in a consciously virtuous Hejazi communi cation of the 22nd June explaining that certain Transjordanians, who had raided Hejaz-Nejd, were moving back into Nejd with their loot, and that, although the Hejazi authorities were entitled to recover it, they preferred to wait for Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid to arrive at a settlement. They hoped that Transjordan would follow this example. This suggestion was still being considered by His Majesty’s Government at the end of the month. Administrative Arrangements on the Frontier. 31. According to information received both in Transjordan and Jedda. several changes were made during May and June in the governorates in the Hejaz-Nejd side of the frontier, but too'little is known at the Legation of either the old men or the new to enable it to judge of their effect. The position of An-Neshmi remained obscure. There were rumours in Jedda (see paragraph 17) that he had ratted on Ibn Saud; in Transjordan, that he was bein? given a command again. Iraq. 32. Iheie is ver^ little to record for the period under review except the following items :— * 1 (a) The treaties concluded by Nuri Pasha in April were published at the beginning of May. Laws enabling King Feisal to ratify them were passed by the Iraq 1 arliament on the 13th May and presumably received the Royal assent. The ratifications had' not been actually exchanged up to the 30th June. (b) On the 14th June His Majesty’s Minister conveyed to Ibn Saud in person the congratulations of His Majesty’s Government on the successful result of the negotiations. He explained that although he had received instructions to do this as soon as ratification was assured (actually in[5886] c a telegram dated the 20th May) he had awaited the King s delayed visit to Jedda to deliver the message, the gist of which he had, however, conveyed orally through Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on receipt of the instructions. (c) About the same time Fuad Bey told Sir A. Ryan that the Iraq Govern ment proposed to send as representative to the Hejaz, Naji Bey-al- Asil, an Iraqi formerly employed by King Hussein to represent him in London and elsewhere. Fuad Bey smiled over this, but did not suggest that the agrement would be refused. Sir A. Ryan did not attempt to elucidate the point. Nothing is known in Jedda as to Ibn Saud’s intentions regarding a representative in Iraq. A report is understood to have reached Cairo that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was to be appointed. It seems most unlikely that Ibn Saud would part with him, except possibly for a limited period to give the establishment of normal relations a start. (d) Polite messages were exchanged between Ibn Saud and King Feisal on the occasion of the death of King Hussein at Amman on the 4th June. This event was reported as a news item in the “ Umm-al-Qura.” It does not seem to have created any excitement in the Hejaz. (e) The name of Ibn Mashhur remained buried in a blessed silence. Koweit and Bahrein. 33. There were no developments in May or June in connexion with prospective negotiations regarding Koweit and Bahrein. On the 17th June Sir A. Ryan reminded Ibn Saud in general terms of his promise to receive the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf during his stay in Nejd (March-April report, paragraph 29). 34. The Political Agent at Bahrein reported on the 9th May that, although the Bahreinis in Flasa were being gradually frozen out, they were no longer being definitely maltreated (January-February report, paragraph 27 {d )). That being so, Captain Prior concurred in Sir A. Ityan's view that it would be better not to take the matter up diplomatically with the Hejazi Government. 35. On the 13th May the Political Resident reported to the Colonial Office on the position as regards the Sheikh of Koweit’s claims against Ibn Saud in respect of past raids and many other things for which the sheikh sought damages. The sheikh had at first produced claims to a grand total of 111,58,190 rupees. At the instance of Colonel Biscoe he had reduced this figure to 14,86,590 rupees for specific losses. He had, moreover, intimated readiness to waive all claims if Ibn Saud would remove the restrictions which he has for many years imposed on trade between Koweit and the interior. Colonel Biscoe recommended in principle that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda should be instructed to submit the reduced claims to the Hejaz-Nejd Government, but suggested that definite action should be postponed until the matter could be discussed with himself and Sir A. Ryan in London during the summer. Yemen and A sir. 36. The question raised by the request of the Hejaz Government (March-April report, paragraph 32) for facilities to establish wireless communi cation between Asir and Aden and postal communication with Kamaran continued to engage the attention of His Majesty’s Government throughout the period under review, mainly with reference to its political aspects. No decision had been taken up to the end of June. 37. There is nothing else of importance to record for the period. Reports as to the state of affairs in Asir and the extent of Ibn Saud’s activities there are contradictory. Something appears to have been done this year to improve road communication with Jizan from the north. It was reported in May that the road | between Birka and Jizan was being repaired. Reports at the end of June, more nebulous, suggested that the King was withdrawing troops from Asir rather than strengthening the position there owing to his preoccupation over the situation south-east of the Transjordan frontier.37a. Nothing is definitely known in Jedda as to the position between Ibn Sand and the Imam Yahya. A member of the Legation staff, who is sometimes well informed, assures Sir A. Ryan (a) that there is some sort of an understanding in the nature of a provisional treaty which is renewed annually, and (b) that two persons who had been sent to Asir on Ibn Saud's business there proceeded in May to the Yemen to treat with the Imam. This information is reproduced with reserve. 1 38. There appears to have been some activity in the closely-connected Senussi and Idrisi circles in Mecca. The following reports came to the notice of the Legation at the end of June, but should be taken with reserve, especially the last: — (a) It is said that Marghani-al-Idrisi, who came from Egypt to Mecca some time ago, married in June a daughter of Sayyid Ahmed-es-Senussi. (b) It is said that Sayyid Ali-al-Idrisi, who formerly ruled for a short time in Asir, recently left for that country, possibly on a mission from Ibn Saud. (c) It is affirmed positively, though it seems most improbable, that Sayyid Hassan-al-Idrisi, the shadow-ruler of Asir, visited Mecca for three days in the latter part of June. III.— Relations with States outside Arabia. British Empire. 39. The easier tone of the correspondence regarding the Transjordan frontier during the period under review produced a general feeling of detente all the more marked as no new questions of a seriously contentious nature arose. Ibn Saud’s realisation of his internal difficulties was a contributory cause as his instinct is to turn to Great Britain in time of trouble. He had unfortunately got it well into his head that His Majesty’s Minister was largely responsible for the earlier tension, and had inspired rather than merely carried out the rigorous policy of His Majesty’s Government. Fuad Bey Hamza aspired to the role of mediator between the King and Great Britain. He was readier than His Majesty to believe that Sir A. Ryan was not ill-disposed, or, if ill-disposed, could be converted and put to good use. 40. All these factors produced a definite demonstration on the occasion of the King’s visit to Jedda in June. In two long conversations on the 13th and 16th June Fuad Bey urged the strong desire of the King for a good understanding with His Majesty’s Government on all points. The King himself developed the same thesis in a two hours’ audience on the 17th June. The gist of all these conversations was that the King looked to his old friend Great Britain for support, and, if supported, would do anything asked of him. He requested Sir A. Ryan’s assistance in arriving at a clear understanding of a fundamental kind. He referred to possible future changes in an Arabia which at present gave no cause for anxiety, hinting at a thesis which Fuad Bey had stated more plainly, viz that Ibn Saud could offer a true and useful friendship, whereas there could be no real friendship between Great Britain and Hashimite-ruled countries, where His Majesty’s Government must strive to maintain a privileged position. He spoke of his desire to use what influence he had elsewhere in a sense favourable to Llis Majesty’s Government. He was not seeking, he said, to drive a bargain, but he did want to know where he stood with His Majesty’s Government. 41 The King's desire for a good understanding with His Majesty’s Government was obviously sincere, if not as disinterested as might have been inferred from his professions of pure friendship. It was equally obvious that both he and Fuad Bey were thinking much of their financial difficulties. Fuad Bey hinted openly on the 13th June at the possibility of financial assistance. The King confined himself to a request for help in enlisting the services of a British bank (see paragraph 4). „ L ., 42 Sir A. Ryan undertook to convey all these ideas and suggestions faithfully to His Majesty’s Government. He developed his personal views at some length, but as non-committally as possible, with the object of showing sympathetic’interest and goodwill, without encouraging fantastic hopes. Full records of the conversations were sent home on the 20th June.[5886] ' c 2 11 Money Order Agreements with India and Palestine. 43. Both these questions have continued to hang fire, although there is no point in dispute regarding either agreement. It is merely a matter of getting the texts into final shape and properly signed and exchanged. The Legation has received no answer to its last communication regarding the agreement with India (March-April report, paragraph 38). At the end of June it addressed a note to ^she Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the agreement with Palestine in order to correct a verbal error in the text and to expedite the conclusion of the matter. France. 44. Progress appears to have been made with the treaty negotiations (March-April report, paragraph 39), but neither side disclose much about them. Italy. 45. The Italian consul seemed hopeful at the end of June of completing the proposed treatv (March-April report, paragraph 40) in the near future. He told Sir A. Ryan about that time that he was delaying his departure on leave for the purpose and was awaiting a final text from Rome. This does not necessarily mean a final text to which the Hejazi Government have already agreed. The Netherlands. 46. The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires, M. Van der Moulen, remained absent during the whole of May and June in connexion with his tour in Yemen and the Hadhramaut. It is stated in the “ Oriente Moderne for May that he concluded a treaty of friendship with the Imam about the middle of April. At the end of June he was understood to have reached Aden on his way back to Jedda to join his wife, who, ignorant of the scope of his travels, arrived several weeks ago to give him a surprise. The surprise was Mme. van der Moulen’s, who remained stranded in grass-widowhood in Jedda up to end of June. 47. M. Adriannse (March-April report, paragraph 42), went on leaye on the 10th June. For some days before his departure he was bombarded with appeals to use his influence with the Netherlands Government to make the Dutch Bank nice and kind to the Hejazi Government (see paragraph 4). Egypt. 48. The new Egyptian consul, Hafiz Amer Bey, appears to be a person of some character and enterprise, but rather a farceur. At various times during May and June he dropped hints to Sir A. Ryan that he was Engaged in negotia tions, and he has visited Mecca more than once. There is, however, no visible sign of any material progress in the establishment of normal relations between Egypt and the Hejaz. Hafiz Bey displays a critical and contemptuous attitude in his language regarding Ibn Sand. He goes out of his way to be friendly in his relations with the British Legation and overdoes the compliments. 49. It is worth noting that in their remonstrance to the King on accession celebrations (paragraph 21) the ulema of Nejd referred with approval to Ibn Baud’s action in preventing the Sacred Caravan from coming to Mecca. Persia. 50. The Persian Charge d’Affaires (March-April report, paragraph 45) went on leave again on the 20th June. He left his vice-consul in charge of the Legation and his sister in charge of the vice-consul, but they propose to go to Taif for a change of air. It is interesting that any foreign representative should be allowed to reside at Taif, but apparently it is well understood that M. and Mme. Behjet are going thither in an entirely private way. Soviet Russia. 51. The Russian Minister has been little in evidence. He went to Mecca towards the end of June. According to one report he is interesting himself in working up the sale of petroleum products. His vice-consul, M. Touymetov, who12 has been many years in Jedda and at one time had the name of being an arden Communist with influence in the Legation, left apparently for good in x ay. Professor Moshkowsky, who acted as Legation doctor and is a skilled bactenologis , also left with his wife early in June. United States of America. 52. The “ Umm-al-Qura ” announced early in May that the United btate^ Government had intimated their recognition of Ibn Saud through their Ambassador and the King’s Minister in London. This was confirmed by a r oreign Office despatch stating that on the 7th May a member of the United States Embassy had called at the Department to say that the Embassy had notified their recognition to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba on the 2nd May. The bearer of the message did not know the intentions of the United States Government as to appointing a representative in Hejaz-Nejd, but thought them unlikely to do so in the near future. A fghanistan. 53. The tea-cup storm over Amanullah Khan’s visit to the Hejaz (March- April report, .paragraphs 46-8) was allayed by his departure for Italy on the 9th May in a Khedivial Line steamer proceeding to Suez. He visited Medina early in May and on the 6th May returned to Jedda, where he was accommodated in the King’s Palace. His own desire was to get away as soon as possible, but he found himself blocked by difficulties in regard to shipping and quarantine. He abandoned a project of going via the Sudan in order to avoid five days quarantine at Suakin, but had to resign himself to the regulation three days at Tor. The various other notable Afghans, who had congregated in the Hejaz, gradually dispersed in different directions, including Nadir Khan’s mission which sailed for India on the 7th May. 54. There was nothing in the final phase of King Amanullah’s adventure to alter the appreciation in the first sentences of paragraph 48 of the report for March-April. If, as is more than possible, he contemplates an attempt to regain his throne, his demonstration of piety and his conversations in Mecca will have been a useful prelude to an effort which must start from some different base. His contacts here with persons other than Afghans and sympathetic Indians presented no appearance of political importance. Ibn Saud honoured him, but is unlikely to take a hand in Afghan affairs. The ex-King saw the Italian, Turkish and Persian representatives in Jedda, and the Egyptian consul, who had gone to Mecca on pilgrimage, saw him there. This intercourse with foreign diplomats seems to have been confined to courtesies. It is not known whether the Soviet Minister visited Amanullah Khan, but it seems probable that he did not. IV.—Am Matters. Hejaz Air Force. 55. After long pondering over the resignations of Messrs. Morris and North, the Hejazi Government arranged, though without ever expressly accepting them, that the aeroplanes, &amp;c., should be taken over by a commission of military officers and experts, the chief of whom was Mr. Lowe. The transfer was effected in the latter part of May. Mr. Lowe flew at least twice in the following days, and on the King's birthday saluted, from the air, the flag of the British Legation. Shortly after he called for the first time on Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan and has since visited the Legation several times. After the transfer he had to assist him a German named Krakowsky, who had had flying experience in the past and has eked out a hand-to-mouth existence in Jedda for some years; and also apparently another German as mechanic. The latter left after a very short time. M. Krakowsky remains, but is at loggerheads with Mr. Lowe, who has no faith in him and says that the only real assistance he has is that of a Syrian. 56. The Hejazi Government had been informed early in May that His Majesty’s Government were willing to help them to recruit new personnel for the force (March-April report, paragraph 49), but considered the previous rates of salary to be a minimum which might have to be exceeded, and that the removal ofMr. Lowe must be an essential condition of assistance. When the Hejazis were making their temporary arrangements described in the preceding paragraph, they renewed more insistently their request for assistance, but would not believe that men could not be obtained at lower rates. After full consideration they were informed on the 6th June that His Majesty’s Government could only help them, if assured (a) that the new personnel would receive satisfactory treatment as regards pay, &amp;c., and (b) that a complete break would be made with the past. His ^.ajesty s Government reaffirmed their previous view as regards the necessity lor salaries at least as high as those previously paid. They did not insist on the immediate removal of Mr. Lowe, but asked for an undertaking that his connexion with the force would be severed before the new personnel reached the Hejaz. On the 17th June the Hejazi Government intimated acquiescence in the two conditions, but propounded a new scheme. They said that they proposed to recruit only four men, viz., an aviator instructor specially qualified for training, a pilot with special knowledge of aeronautical engineering and two mechanics. They proposed, at the same time, to send a mission abroad to be trained in aviation, and asked whether His Majesty’s Government would give facilities for such a mission to be trained in the United Kingdom. These proposals were referred to His Majesty’s Government, who had not replied up to the end of June. 57. Meanwhile, Messrs. Morris and North remained in Jedda awaiting a settlement of accounts. This was held up by a demand of the Hejazi Government that Mr. Morris should account in detail for all the material originally delivered at Darin Island. In the absence of the original specifications and of any regular storekeeping arrangements this demand could not be complied with. Sir A. Ryan, who had been asked by Fuad Bey to advise, intervened unofficially to remove this difficultv and was, at the end of June, hopeful of adjusting it. He had, in the meantime, however, obtained instructions authorising him to intervene officially on behalf of the two ex-pilots, if efforts at mediation should fail. Air Force Material. 58. On the 18th May the Legation at last communicated to the Hejazi Government the reply of His Majesty’s Government to their request for assistance in procuring instructional aeroplanes, &amp;c. (March-April report, paragraph 50). The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied on the 17th June that, owing to lack of technical experts, they preferred to postpone consideration of the matter. 59. Early in June the Hejazi Government requested facilities for shipment to Jedda via Bahrein and India of 500 bombs, being half the stock which had been originally supplied for the Air Force, but had been left behind at Darin Island. It was agreed that the shipment might be made subject to compliance with Board of Trade regulations and to the detonators being removed from the bombs and stored in a separate magazine at the opposite end of the ship. Arabian Air Route. 60. The detente in the Transjordan frontier negotiations enabled the Legation to reopen this question (March-April report, paragraph 51). On the 28th May Sir A. Ryan handed to Fuad Bey Hamza a memorandum for the King s consideration, referring to the discussions last summer and developing the present desiderata of His Majesty’s Government on the lines laid down in the instructions summarised in paragraph 45 of the report for January-Iebruary. The memorandum omitted any reference to a number of landing grounds a.t stated intervals or to possible consultation with the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq. Fuad Bey stated that the Hejaz Government were preparing regulations, which, he continued, would mark a more liberal attitude towards foreign aircraft, although there would be a highly centralised control. I he Minister delayed further action on the chance of the regulations being published. Eventually, the Hejazi Government produced on the 18th June a not very satisfactory official reply in which they again referred to the proposed regulations, but in language suggesting that they were much less advanced than Fuad Bey had led Sir A. Ryan to think. &amp; The Hejazi memorandum ended by saying that pending the completion of the arrangements for the new regulations they wished “to inquire of the British Government as to the terms on which a mutual agreement can be come to on this subject with a view to their studying such terms also.’’ When reportingthis reply to the Foreign Office on the 28th June (after an accidental delay due to to staff changes) Sir A. Ryan surmised that Ibn Saud might have in mind a financial deal and inquired what the attitude of His Majesty’s Government would he, if that proved to he the case. Alleged Violation of Nejd Territory by British Aircraft. — 61. On the 21st May the Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote a note protesting against an alleged violation of Nejd territory by British aircraft, which were said to have hovered over Jinna Island and Jubail between the 15th and 18th May. His language suggested that such violations were persistent. It was important to dispose quickly of this complaint as the Legation was just about to reopen the question of landing grounds (paragraph 60). Fortunately, the competent British authorities had no difficulty in refuting the specific accusation. They gave particulars of two specific flights at about the time of the alleged violation, neither of which could have given rise to the complaint, although there w T as a possibility in one of them of a flying boat having approached to within 2h miles of the coast at Abu Ali Island owing to an accident. When informing the Hejazi Government of the fact on the 2nd June, the Legation suggested that, in order to facilitate the investigation of such complaints, local authorities should be directed to supply full particulars and took exception in polite terms to the allegation that British aircraft persistently violated Nejd territory. The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not revert to the matter up to the end of June. V.— Military Matters. General. 62. There have been many rumours of troop movements, especially movements into the Northern area, with a view to strengthening Ibn Saud’s position there, even at the cost of reducing the forces in Asir (see paragraph 36). These reports cannot be verified. It is also stated that, before the King left Mecca, all the military supplies there were removed to Riadh. Regular Army. 63. Faudhi Bey Kawokji (January-February report, paragraph 47), the Director-General of Military Organisation, resigned, or was dismissed—it is not clear which—about the middle of May. Conflicting stories were current. He had resigned because of inability to get his proposals adopted and because of undue interference—the Director-General of Finance had shifted half his little army without consulting him. He had been dismissed because he had been promised a cool million (pounds, not riyals) by the Soviets to promote a Shereefian restoration; or because he had suspect correspondence with Syria; or because he had written to a Turkish lady, to whose hand he aspired, that he had become a Minister of War at 35, and would end up as a King. Anyhow, he went, and was replaced by a certain Ilamdi Bey, previously commander of the Jedda garrison. This person has a known capacity for intrigue and some unexplained pull in high quarters. He is a Kurd of sorts, and is understood to have risen from the ranks to the post of lieutenant in the Turkish army. He would probably be a stout fellow in a scrap, but has obviously neither the knowledge nor the experience for organisation. There has been less drilling within the sight of the Legation since he took over. It may be doubted whether the regular army will survive this change and financial stress—especially if the ulema of Nejd disapprove of it (see paragraph 21). VI.— Naval Matters. 64. ILM.S. “Dahlia” (March-April report, paragraph 53) remained in Jedda until the 1st May. There were no naval visits, British or other, during the remainder of the period under review.VII.— Pilgrimage. 65. The dispersal of the pilgrimage took place without any special difficulty, and was practically complete by the end of June. The Hejazi Govern ment issued a series of bulletins recording excellent health conditions, and formally declared the pilgrimage clean on the 15th May. There was a slight ^care in May, when it was rumoured that, as happened last year, a suspicion of cholera had arisen at Tor. If there was any difficulty there, it was quickly overcome. Some time after, the Government of India communicated to Sir A. Ryan information from the Health Bureau at Singapore to the effect that the Alexandria Board had declared the pilgrimage suspect of cholera on the 25th May. A direct enquiry, addressed to Alexandria, elicited a flat denial that the board had made any such declaration. 66. This contradiction had not been explained up to the end of June. The matter is of great importance to the Legation, which has to decide whether south-bound ships should be required to call at Kamaran, and has to decide the question at short notice, either on the Minister’s responsibility, according as he is advised that there are or are not grounds of suspicion; or in consultation with India or Singapore in a doubtful case. Any declaration by the Quarantine Board would obviously affect the judgment of the British authorities concerned. Sir A. Ryan suggested, in June, in more general correspondence regarding the question of calls at Kamaran, that he should in future be advised direct from Alexandria of all decisions of the Quarantine Board regarding the sanitary state of the pilgrimage. 67. Some inconvenience was caused by the inability of a number of Indian pilgrims to pay their mutawwifs’ fees, and consequently to recover passes held by the mutawwifs under the regulations of last April (Marcffi-April report, paragraph 59). Although those regulations are open to great objection, the right of the mutawwifs to their fees cannot be questioned, and Sir A. Ryan felt that he could not intervene strongly on behalf of the pilgrims in question. As a result of unofficial action by the Legation, however, a number of them were let off their fees. 68. These were pilgrims with return tickets, but without cash. The Legation was again confronted in June with the more normal problem of destitute pilgrims without return tickets, of whom there were at least 100 awaiting repatriation by the middle of the month, and many more by the end. None of these were embarked in June, as the Turner, Morrison Line quoted a very high rate compared with the highest charge for destitutes in recent years. The Legation was still in correspondence' with the Government of India at the end of June regarding the disposal of this year's destitutes and the major question of (a) measures to reduce the number in future by more restrictive measures in India, and (b) the adoption of regular arrangements for dealing with such destitutes as must continue to come on its hands annually, however* strict the control in India may be. 69. Other pilgrimage matters will be dealt with in the annual report on the 1931 season. Owing to an unfortunate chapter of accidents, the annual report for 1930 was not circulated until the 1st June, 1931. It is hoped to avoid a recurrence of this delay and to issue the report for 1931 not later than the end of September. VIII.— Miscellaneous. King's Birthday. 70. A general reception, held at the Legation on the 3rd June, was attended by between ninety and 100 persons, of whom about two-thirds were Europeans and members of foreign missions, the remainder being local officials and notables and certain Indian merchants. The number of the former category illustrates the growth of the European and foreign official element in Jedda, if a net be cast wide enough to include all the motley elements of which the quasi-European community is made up. V isitors. 71. Such of the visitors mentioned in paragraphs 66 and 67 of the report for March-April as were still in the Hejaz on the 30th April left in May. The Twitchells returned to Aden. Prince Ahmed Tevhid left for India on the#V Hj 20th May, accompanied by a certain Jemil Pasha, a former Turkish officer of some distinction, who has served Ibn Sand in recent years. Sir Abdul Kerim Ghuznavi went to Egypt via the Sudan, and was much outraged at having to do five days’ quarantine at Suakin. 72. The only notable non-Moslem visitors in May-June were M. Boucicault, the Marconi expert (paragraph 10), and Ameen Rihani, the author of books on Arabia. The latter arrived on the 5th June and stayed over the King's visi^B He is said (but all such stories should be taken with a grain of salt) to have been given a present of £1,000. He called at the Legation and later dined there. His attitude in conversation towards the Administration of this country was highly critical. If he still entertains the anti-British feeling shown in his hooks, he discreetly concealed it. 73. Amir Adil Arslan, who is understood to be a brother of the notorious Shekib Arslan, but of a political complexion less repugnant to the French, paid a very short visit to the Hejaz towards the end of June. Nothing is known as to its object. Legation Staff. 74. Treasury having sanctioned the appointment of a second career vice- consul at Jedda, Mr. G. W. Furlonge arrived from Casablanca on the 22nd May to take up the duties of acting vice-consul. Mr. Wikeley went on leave on the 10th June. Mr. C. G. Hope-Gill returned from leave on the 21st June and resumed his duties as head of the Chancery. Sir A. Ryan expects to go on leave on the 20th July, after which date Mr. Hope-Gill will become Charge d'Affaires. Haji Abdul Majid, the pilgrimage officer sent annually from Malaya for the pilgrimage season, left for Singapore on the 13th June. Book of Hejaz-Nejd Stamps. 75. The King intimated through Fuad Bey in June his readiness to accept the dedication of the book contemplated by Captain Lewis (January-February report, paragraph 65). Facilities were promised for obtaining information from the local postal authorities. Meteorological. 76. Readings taken within doors at the Legation show the following averages of office temperature and atmospheric humidity for the six months ended the 30th June :— Temperature. Month 1931. Average Humidity. Percentage. Highest. A verage Maximum by day. Average Minimum at night. Lowest.

Ibn Saud. THE King prolonged his stay in Jedda (January—February report, paragraph 1) until the 5th March, when he returned to Mecca. He remained at Mecca until the 19th April, when he again came to Jedda for three returning for the pilgrimage early on the 22nd April. His health during both visits appeared to be excellent, although he gave fatigue as a reason for his second visit. There was no signs of his relaxing his personal control of all important [192 d—2] B•55E3 ^!UiWi i 2 affairs, although he shows an increasing tendency to leave formal discussion of foreign business to his Ministry for Foreign Affairs. One of his wives, who had been in the north of the Hejaz, arrived in Jedda in March and has been installed there permanently. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. The foreign representatives had little reason during March and April to complain of lack of opportunity to discuss business in Jedda. Since his break down at the end of February (January-February report, paragraph 3) the Amir Feisal has played no apparent role in foreign affairs except that of signing documents. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin continued to act as Under-Secretary until the 14th April, when, contrary to the expectation of many, Fuad Bey Hamza returned. From the 1st March to the 17th April, when Fuad Bey effectively resumed his functions, Sheikh Yusuf spent much of his time in Jedda. His general attitude tended to confirm the more favourable opinion of him formed by Sir A. Ryan (January-February report, paragraph 3), but the French and Italian repre sentatives, with whom it was a question of discussing treaty texts, found him difficult and meticulous. Finance. 3. There was no improvement in the financial situation described in paragraphs 4 to 6 of the January-February report. On the purely financial side there was no outward deterioration, perhaps because of the influx of pilgrims even in reduced numbers and perhaps because recourse has been had to the reserve supply of gold supposed to have been maintained by the Minister of F inance. Neither of these factors can afford lasting relief, because the pilgrimage, whatever immediate money it may have brought in, has been a very poor one and the gold reserve, as to the amount or utilisation of which no precise information has at any recent time been available, is understood to have been seriously depleted of late, if not exhausted. In the meantime, however, the position of British claimants, with the exception of the Government of India, has improved. As a result of very strong pressure by His Majesty’s Minister the cable account of the Eastern Telegraph Company up to the end of December was paid off in March by arrange ment with the Dutch Bank The outstandings of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company were reduced to healthy proportions, and the Legation was not called upon to intervene further on their behalf. The question of chauffeurs’ wages assumed a new shape which makes it preferable to deal with it later. 4. How little real improvement there is in the financial situation as a whole is shown by the attitude taken up in regard to the Government of India claim. Following on his earlier conversations with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, Sir A. Ryan mentioned it to the King on the 4th March. Next day the sheikh brought a message from His Majesty, in which, with protestations of gratitude for the past kindness and expressions of regret at having to ask for more, he explained that owing to the poorness of the pilgrimage, the Hejaz Government could not meet that debt unless they borrowed elsewhere. The King asked for a year’s grace, offering to give the Government of India a “ profit ” (although it is against his religious principles to pay interest) if it were accorded. He explained, not for the first time, that he would rather owe money to a friend than to strangers. Sir A. Ryan promised to submit this proposal to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, without any suggestion as to whether it should be accepted or refused. He pointed out that he had intervened last autumn to secure delay, the request for which was based on an assurance that the King was working out plans for financial reorganisation. He did not feel that he could do this a t second time, although he recognised that the slump in the pilgrimage had been more disastrous than could have been foreseen in August. 5. The exchange situation was restored early in March by various measures, of which the principal were the prohibition of the export of gold and the arrange ment with the Dutch Bank mentioned in paragraph 4 of the report for January- February. The latter arrangement broke down in April owing apparently to the insufficiency of the gold ear-marked for the redemption of riyals and nickel currency accepted by the bank, the Government having limited its liability forsuch redemption to £10,000; and to the freedom with which the redeemed riyals, &amp;c., were thrown back on the market. The bank had sought its profit in a high commission of 1 per cent, on foreign drafts, and had increased this to 2 per cent. About the middle of April the prohibition on the export of gold was relaxed, and the bank did business for a short time on the basis of selling drafts against half gold and half silver, &amp;c. This also broke down and the riyal again declined, but not so seriously as might have been expected. At the end of the month it fluctuated round rates of 11 to 12 to the £ sterling. These developments coincided with a period when all the pilgrims had arrived and the festival season was approaching. The centre of gravity shifted from the market for gold and silver to that for nickel, a very important element in retail transactions. I he bottom went out of the nickel currency market just before the pilgrimage, and the crisis in the bazaars was accentuated by a decision of the Government on the 23rd April themselves to take nickel at the market rate. Panic conditions prevailed for a short time. On the 30th April the authorities were contemplating an heroic effort to bring things back to £ sterling = 10 riyals = 220 piastres. Economic. 6. The poorness of the pilgrimage and the financial crisis have produced a general depression in business circles. The Government are said to be exploring the possibility of developing fresh sources of prosperity. The most definite sign of advance in this direction has been the visit of Mr. Twitched (see paragraph 66). The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 24th April contained a leading article on the King’s solicitude for the general progress of the country, with special reference to “ Two Great Projects,” namely, the quest for w r ater and a scheme for developing mineral resources. Mr. Philby mentioned the latter idea in a private conversation early in March, and suggested more recently that Mr. Twitched might also be working on mining possibilities. General. 7. There was again no news of any important development in the interior during March and April. A general malaise was said to prevail in native circles in Mecca and Jedda. Economic depression would sufficiently account for this, were it not suggested somewhat persistently (though so vaguely that the statement must be received with great reserve) that the position in the north is a cause of perturbation. The apprehension among the resident .upper classes in the two towns is described as being similar to that produced by the final struggle between Ibn Sand and the Hashimites. The Governor of Hail, Ibn Musaad, is said to be restive, and the eyes of some are turned anxiously to the Transjordan frontier area. Ad this is unsubstantiated, but cannot be ignored at a time of general depression and uncertainty. It may be noted that among the visitors to Mecca for the pilgrimage was Abdudah-bin-Blaihid, whose visit last year (March 1930 report, paragraph 14) was supposed to be embarrassing to the Hejazi Govern ment, but on this occasion he seems to have attracted no special attention. 8. The dances mentioned in paragraph 9 of the report for January- February were followed by a series of somewhat similar demonstrations during the remaining days of the King’s stay in Jedda. Various sections of the popu lation took it in turn to organise processions with much drumming and dancing to the palace. This was a passing phase, but there have been minor relaxations in other directions, a greater toleration, for instance, of music and games. Any theory of Ibn Saud’s evolution can only be tested by experience, but evidence is accumulating in support of the working theory suggested tentatively in paragraph 10 of the report for January-February. If the King is definitely working on a policy of compromise, one of the objects probably is to efface as far as possible distinctions between Nejd and the Hejaz. 9. The failure of the Government to pay its chauffeurs' wages (January- February report, paragraph 5) led to a deplorable incident in Mecca on or about the 26th March. The precise facts are not certain, but they are roughly as follows : A number of discontented chauffeurs of various nationalities, headed by a Syrian, threatened a strike, attempted to bring their grievances to the notice of the higher authorities and apparently indulged in some molestation either of other chauffeurs [192 d—21 b 2^ _ - 4 who would not join them or of users of certain cars or both. Whatever the exact nature of the demonstration, it culminated in some section of the malcontents being set upon by the King's men, severely beaten, and thrown pell-mell into prison. These included ten British or British-protected persons of feomali and other origins. 10. His Majesty’s Minister had on the 16th March spoken in general terms to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin about the non-payment of wages. On hearing of the ^ Mecca incident he refrained from making an official protest tor various reasons, including the uncertainty as regards the exact facts, the difficulty of knowing which, if any, of the British chauffeurs involved had documentary proof ot nationality and the undesirability of aggravating the tension caused by the 1 rans- jordan frontier situation. On the 29th March and the 1st April, however, he spoke categorically to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in conversation. He urged that, even if the chauffeurs had indulged in any folly, it was due to the default of the Government. He mentioned a rumour that the men were to be deported, and suggested that the wise course for a Government to pursue in such circumstances was to remove the grievance and show leniency after dealing with any immediate disorder. 11. In spite of this sage advice, the Government decided to deport the chauffeurs. On the 7th April the Governor of Jedda requested the Legation to visa the travelling papers of three British-protected persons and to issue papers to seven others who had none. Sir A. Ryan delayed action on the first request, and in reply to the second asked tha t the seven men should be sent to the Legation for necessary inquiries. At the same time he wrote a strong private letter to Sheikh Yusuf, explaining that he would not be a party to the deportation of the ten British subjects en masse without reference to His Majesty’s Government, and making a personal appeal to the King to cancel the deportation order if only for the sake of the credit of his Government and his desire for good relations with Great Britain. 12. His Majesty’s Government, while approving Sir A. Ryan’s action, felt that they could not contest the right of the Hejazi Government to deport the men and directed that, if the local action failed, the necessary visas and travelling papers should be issued, subject to whatever might be possible being done to protect the men against unnecessary hardship and more particularly against being defrauded of their wages. 13. Up to the end of April the King had not replied to Sir A. Ryan's appeal, nor had the Governor of Jedda produced the seven candidates for passports. The victims were believed to be still confined at Mecca with the possible exception of their Syrian leader, who at an early stage managed to get to Jedda on leaving a surety behind. This man was examined by the British Legation doctor at the request of the French Charge d’Affaires, and had undoubtedly been most severely beaten. II.— Frontier Questions. T ransjordan. Current Raiding. 14. Much correspondence passed in March and April regarding raids related mostly to incidents which had formed the subject of protests by the respective Governments earlier and in two cases dealt with raids alleged to have occurred before March, which had not been the subject of earlier protests. One of these was a further raid from Transjordan which the Hejazi Government believed to have occurred early in February, but about which they admitted not having exact information. The other was an alleged raid from Nejd into Syria via Transjordan, for which the Syrian authorities sought to hold Transjordan responsible. The raids alleged to have occurred in March and April reduced themselves to three from Transjordan into Nejd and one from Nejd into Trans jordan. The former were of a normal type. The one raid from Nejd was serious, inasmuch as it was an attack on the 30th March by a party of Nejd Shararat on a patrol of four men of the Arab Legion, who had been detailed to draw water in the course of ordinary patrol work. Three of these men were killed and one wounded. Their camels, rifles and kit were captured. Although5 they were not in uniform when attacked, it was considered certain by the Transjordan authorities that one had been murdered after the raiders had ascertained that they w T ere attacking policemen. It w r as alleged later, on the evidence of two men who claimed to have been in Jauf when the raiders returned, that the latter were w^armly congratulated by the new Governor Turki-as-Sudairi and w 7 ere authorised to keep what they had captured as a rew 7 ard for their prow r ess. 15. In the course of the correspondence in March and April, the Transjordan authorities made it a practice to suggest that Hejaz-Nejd subjects wdio had been victims of admitted raids or might be entitled to restitution in more doubtful cases, should report to Captain Glubb. In one such case, the Hejazi Government intimated that the Governor of A1 Ula would send an agent to Captain Glubb to take delivery. In three others they stated that, as the victims could not go to him in person, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Ibn Zeid had been instructed to discuss the cases wdth him. (See the following section.) General Frontier Situation. 16. The discussions arising out of the British memorandum (January- February report, paragraph 18) overshadowed all other questions between the Legation and the Heiazi Government throughout March and April. Sir A. Ryan emphasised the gravity of the situation in a long interview with Ibn Saud on the 2nd March. The King w 7 as impressed, but in replies returned on the 3rd March to the Legation's tw T o communications of the 28th February, he maintained a bold front. The reply to the separate note regarding Captain Glubb w T as reasonably satisfactory in form, and except for a carefully-worded suggestion of arbitrary conduct on his part in one later note no further accusations were subsequently made against him. The reply to the main British memorandum was largely evasive. The King reaffirmed his intention of bringing article 3 of the Hadda Agreement into operation, but maintained that the proposed meeting between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz would serve no useful purpose until agreement had been reached as to (a) the method of dealing w T ith raids since Mr. MacDonnell began his investigation, and (b) the principles to be observed by the two representatives. As regards (a), he claimed the return by Transjordan of stated quantities of loot. The most important point laid down as regards (b) was that, in the case of large-scale raids, Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid should exchange information and, if necessary, meet, but that any decisions they might take should be ad referendum. The King agreed that raids during a meeting like the MacDonnell investigation were scandalously un-Bedouin, but accused Transjordan of having started the new series of raids on the 26th July. He refused to condemn En Neshmi, who had done his duty and whom he had dismissed only to avoid controversy w T ith His Majesty’s Government. He undertook to instruct Ibn Zeid to meet Captain Glubb on receipt of a reply from His Majesty's Government. Fie refused any restoration of loot to Transjordan until a start had been made on the other side. He declined, wdth thanks, His Majesty's Govern ment’s offer of assistance in the Wadi Sirhan, thanking God that he had pow er over all his subjects. The only help he asked for w 7 as that criminals fleeing into Transjordan should be handed back. 17. After carefully considering their next move, His Majesty’s Government decided that the Hejazi reply, while in many ways evasive and unsatisfactory, did not exclude the achievement of their essential purpose, namely, that of bringing about an immediate meeting of the frontier authorities and the settle ment of the questions at issue on a local and tribal basis. Ihey were unable to accept all the principles proposed by Ibn Saud for observance by the repre sentatives, although they did so very reluctantly as regards the clause providing for reference of their decisions to higher authority. Two further memoranda were exchanged on the 10th and 12th March. Space does not admit of repro ducing all their details. The Hejazi memorandum of the 12th March split further hairs, but still did net make the meeting impossible. There ensued from it a British proposal, put forward on the suggestion of Sir J. Chancellor, that Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid should hold a preliminary meeting limited to the exchange of information and views as to the best means of policing the frontier. Ibn Saud w 7 as again sticky over this. It w 7 as eventually agreed towards the middle April that such a meeting should take place, but only after the King had scouted the idea that there need be any discussion of measures of police and stressed his■ sa 6 view that the preliminary meeting should only be for the purpose of exchanging information. It was also agreed, without prejudice to the prehminaiy mee mg, that Captain Glubh and Ibn Zeid should at once begin to communicate with eacn other by means of the wireless station at Jauf. The final completion o lese arrangements was further delayed by a breakdown of the wireless communica ion between Mecca and Jauf. Eventually the Hejazi Government sent a courier by sea from Jedda on the 22nd April, with instructions to Ibn Zeid. news ot his arrival at the Transjordan-Nejd frontier reached Jedda up to the 3()th Apn . 18. The main correspondence was resumed on the 18th April, w ^. n Sir A. Ryan forwarded a memorandum stating the considered views ot is Majesty's Government on points in the Hejazi memorandum of the 12 th Mai cl , which still required to be dealt with before the further meeting between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz could take place. It was clearly laid down that the statement was not to effect the arrangements already made tor a preliminary meeting. The memorandum emphasised various desiderata in connexion with the later meeting. It pressed for Ibn Saud s consent to a previous public announcement prohibiting raiding under threat of exemplary punishment, not only during the meeting, but at all times. Stress was laid on the importance o empowering the representatives to supervise the immediate restoration ot loot on either side, once their decision had been sanctioned by higher authority. His Majesty’s Government confirmed their reluctant acceptance of the principle that such sanction should be obtained, but they urged that no further time should be lost over discussions of procedure. They agreed that the representatives shqu dispense as far as possible with the attendance of tribal sheikhs, one of the points to which the Hejazi Government had been most reluctant to agree. Ihoy considered it essential, however, that they should be free to call upon the sheikhs in certain cases, and suggested that the danger of quarrels, with which the Hejazi Government had made play, could be minimised by taking guarantees m advance for good behaviour. They proposed that the raids to be dealt with should be all those which, by reason of’ the date of their occurrence, were outside the scope ot the MacDonnell enquiry. They regarded the question of the surrender ot criminals, which Ibn Saud had raised in his first counter-memorandum and to which he had reverted later, as being one which did not effect the immediate issue. They promised to deal with it in a separate memorandum at an early date. 19. The Hejazi Government replied on the 24th April. The answer was again unsatisfactory in certain respects, notably because it made no reference to the supervision by the representatives of arrangements for the mutual restoration of loot and because it laid down the principal that sheikhs should only be summoned, if at all, for consultation with the representative of their own sides not for “ reciprocal trials or interrogation.'' A suitable rejoinder to be com municated on behalf of His Majesty’s Government was still under consideration at the end of the month. Administrative Arrangements on the frontier. 20 According to reports from Transjordan, of which their is no independent confirmation in Jedda, the general administration of the frontier region has been placed in the hands of Ahmad-as-Sudairi, acting as Viceroy at I ehuk anc exercising control over Governors at that place, at A1 Ela, and at Jaut 1 he new Governor of Jauf is said to be Turki-as-Sudairi, a brother of Ahmad. According to the same reports, An Neshmi was in February in command ot the desert forces, but the Hejazi Government denied in March that he held any ofiicial post whatever. Druse Refugees in Nejd (see paragraph 20, January-February report). 21 The Iraqi Prime Minister took this question up with the Hejazi Government during his negotiations in Mecca (paragraph 22 #). From what he told Sir \ Ryan it was clear that he was not only willing but anxious that the refugees should settle in Iraq. He hinted at, without expressing, a request for Sir A Ryan's assistance in getting Ibn Saud to write to Sultan A1 Atiash in a sense which would ensure his moving thither with his followers. Sir A. Ryan sought instructions on the subject on the (1th April, but the matter was m abeyanceup to the end of the month. Both the foreign Office and Sir f. Humphi)s considered that it would be premature to intervene with Ibn Saud until the assent of the French authorities, already given in principle, should have taken deiini e shape. The High Commissioner hoped to discuss the matter further with the French when visiting Beirut on the 19th April. Iraq. x ‘ Bon-Voisinage,” &amp;c. 22. The situation described in paragraphs 21 and 22 of the report for January-February took a turn for the better in March. Some sort of a collection of the story that Nuri Pasha was coming by invitation to talk to Ibn Sana abou an Arab alliance would appear to have been published in the Bagdad pi ess. n or about the 16th March the Pasha telegraphed direct to Mecca his regrets at having had to postpone his visit. The suspicions of the Hejazis as to the reasons for the delay were finally allayed by a further telegram announcing his departure from Bagdad by air. He arrived in Jedda on the morning of the oth April accompanied by Taha Pasha Hashimi, the Iraqi Chief of Staff, Munaftak Bey- al-Alousi, a high official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and two subordinates He was given a good reception, though it perhaps fell a little short of what might have been expected. Not only the King but the Prince-Ministei foi oieign Affairs remained in Mecca and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin went no further than the quay leaving it to minor personages to welcome the delegation on board ship. The Heiazi Government were a little disconcerted to find that Nun 1 asha contemplated only a short stay, all the shorter as the Khedivial steamer by which he intended to return was timed to leave earlier than had been expected. Plans were rapidly readjusted, and instead of staying at least one night in Jedda, he went on the same afternoon to Mecca, where the whole of the negotiations took * 23. The negotiations in Mecca lasted three days. They were successfully concluded late on°the afternoon of the 8th March. No occasion arose for British intervention, contrary to the expectation of His Majesty’s Minister, who had obtained instructions as to the attitude to be observed, in case he should be called in to compose differences. His only role, indeed, was to sa\ bless you m^ children ” at a dinner party at the Legation on the evening of the last day, at which Nuri Pasha and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin arrived very late but very pleased with themselves. From what Nuri Pasha told Sir A. Ryan, taken in conjunction with the official communique published by the Hejazi Government on the 10th April, the agreements reached would appear to have been as follows (a) The u Bon-Voisinage ” Agreement and Arbitration Protocol initialled at Bagdad on the 9th March, 1930, were signed, with minor alterations. (b) An extradition treaty was signed after difficult negotiations, in the course of which Nuri Pasha undertook to write a letter in agreed terms giving certain assurances regarding tribal offenders. ^ ^ (c) It was agreed to renew the arrangement made on board H.M.S. “ Lupin in February 1930, regarding the disputed posts in the southern desert of Iraq (Jedda report for February 1930, paragraph 3 (1)). The Hejazi communique made no reference to this question. (d) Nuri Pasha believed himself to have finally placated Ibn Saud as regards Ibn Mashhur (see below). This also was not referred to in the Hejazi communique. . . (e) Various questions were reserved for subsequent negotiation. These, according to the Hejazi communique, were Kara Mein Wakfs, pass port arrangements, customs duties and co-operation in regard to scientific and technical matters. Nuri Pasha also mentioned wells. Just before re-embarking he told Sir A. Ryan that he had that morning made some last moment concession regarding Wakfs, but he did not indicate its nature. 24. Apart from the main negotiations, the parties also discussed the questions of Ibn Mashhur (see paragraphs 27-28) and the disposal of Sultan A1 Atrash and his followers (see paragraph 21). Nuri Pasha explained to the Hejazi Government the agreement just concluded between Iraq and Transjordan.He informed the King of his intention of sending Taha Pasha and Muwaffak Bey on from Jedda to Sana (see also paragraph 35 below). Finally, he succeeded, according to his own account, in placating the King's resentment against Dr. Damluji, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs (September-November report 11 (e )), and carried away a kind message to that gentleman. 25. Thus, despite the nipping winds of February, the roses that bloomed in Bagdad in December (January-February report, paragraph 22) came to ^ perfection in Mecca at Eastertide. Both parties showed qualities of statesman- % ship. It does not appear whether Nuri Pasha broached his Arab Alliance project. He made no express reference to it in his conversations with Sir A. Ryan, although he spoke of having, when in Mecca, represented the despatch of his delegates to Sana as a move calculated to serve Arab interests generally. 26. It was agreed at Mecca that the treaty texts should be published simultaneously by the two Governments at a later date, the idea being to give Nuri Pasha time* to prepare the ground for submitting them to his Parliament, the assent of which he hoped to secure before the end of its spring sittings. I bn Mashhur. 27. On the 30th March His Majesty’s Government approved the language used by Sir A. Ryan in his conversations of the 31st January and the 1st February arising out of the Hejazi note of the 29th January (January- February report, paragraph 23, in which “ resented ” should read “ reasserted ’), and laid down the lines of a reply to that note. This reply was intended to define the position of His Majesty’s Government before the arrival of Nuri Pasha, and was actually communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 4th April. The main points were that the case had been discussed between the two Kings at the Lupin Conference precisely because it differed from that of the other rebels who had surrendered, that any subsequent intervention by His Majesty’s Govern ment had been undertaken merely from motives of friendship for both sides, and that in present circumstances they could only disinterest themselves and leave the parties to settle the matter direct. 28. Nuri Pasha believed himself to have disposed of the matter satisfactorily during his negotiations at Mecca. When replying on the 11th April to a personal letter from Sir F. Humphrys, Ibn Saud recognised, subject to a mild restate ment of his views on the question of principle, that the matter was closed. On the 13th April the Minister for Foreign Affairs sent a reply not quite so amicable to the British official communication of the 4th April. He again maintained that the Hejazi Government’s claim against His Majesty’s Government rested on the same promise as that in fulfilment of which other rebels had been surrendered. He admitted, however, that, as a result of the recent negotiations with Iraq, the matter was in process of settlement. It may be hoped that, if Ibn Mashhur remains in Syria, and if there is no quarrel over the surrender by Iraq of his followers and property, the tiresome question wfill cease to trouble the relations of Great Britain, Iraq and Hejaz-Nejd. In a good day, be it spoken ! Koweit and Bahrein. 29. At an audience on the 2nd March Sir A. Ryan explained orally to Ibn Saud that it would be impossible for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to visit His Majesty at Jedda (January-February report, paragraph 27 {a )), but that it was hoped that an opportunity for a meeting in Nejd might present itself later. The King was most amiable. He said that he had realised how difficult it would be for Colonel Biscoe to come to Jedda, but that he had suggested it to show his goodwill. He hoped to be able to receive the Resident later in Nejd. He added spontaneously that he would be prepared to discuss matters of common interest. 30. There was no other development of any importance in connexion with the possible discussion of Persian Gulf questions. The suggestion that Colonel Biscoe should take advantage of the King’s invitation to Jedda to write him a direct letter was abandoned. A report by Colonel Biscoe to the Colonial Office early in March pointed to a further amelioration in the direct relations between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, with whom the King had finally settled a9 question of frontier camels and whom he had invited to come to Mecca for the pilgrimage. The sheikh had been unable for financial reasons to accept this invitation. 'New Trade Route. 31. See January-February report, paragraph 28. Nothing further was heard of the project for an overland route from the Hasa coast to the Hejaz. Early in April the newly-returned Persian Charge d Afiaires spoke of it to Sir A. Ryan as a matter which had been talked of but could not be regarded 101 the present as practical politics. In the meanwhile the Persian Government seem to be mainly interested in diverting their pilgrims from the route across S\na to the all-sea route from Muhammaran to Jedda by Russian ships. Yemen and A sir. 32. On the 11th March the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote officially to the Legation asking that, as Sabiyan and Jizan were not covered by the agreement between the Hejazi Government and the Eastern Telegiaph Company (which agreement precludes the former from using other means oi telegraphic communication with the outside world), arrangements should be made to establish wireless communication between Jizan and Aden for commercial purposes. The Legation was also asked to arrange for postal communication with a similar object between Jizan and Kamaran. i tt- 33. The primary interest of these proposals was that they assumed His Majesty’s Government’s acquiescence in the new status of Asir. They compelled a fresh review of the situation in further letters addressed by the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office and India Office (January-February report, paragraph 30). On the 28th March the Foreign Office lent to the view that the new situation in regard to Asir should be ^cognised, subject to previous consultation with the Italian Government. 34. From information supplied unofficially by Mr. Champion (paragraph bb) to Sir A. Ryan, it seems probable that the establishment of a wireless ser\ice between Jizan and the Admiralty station at Aden, which already accepts commercial messages, presents no great practical difficulty. The question of a postal service to Kamaran may be complicated by the dubious international status of that island. . 35. There do not appear to have been any important developments m the situation between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya. According to reports from Aden, which may well be accurate, although independent information is difficult to come by in Jedda, Ibn Saud has recently been pressing the Imam to agree to a delimitation of frontiers and the Imam has been hedging. The despatch to Sana of two members of Nuri Pasha s mission, viz., Taha Pasha A1 Hashimi and Muwaffak Bey, is of some interest in connexion with Hejaz-Yemen relations. They left Jedda for Massowah on the 13th April and are understood to have visited Asmara during an enforced stay in Eritrea. Taha Pasha was formerly Turkish Chief of Staff in the Yemen and knows the Imam. Nuri Pasha told Sir A. Ryan that he had assured himself that Ibn Saud would not take umbrage at the two delegates being sent straight from the Hejaz to the Yemen. He said that he had offered good offices towards the removal of any resentment in the Imam’s mind over Ibn Saud’s Asir policy. The King had reacted favourably and charged the delegates with friendly messages to the Imam. Nuri Pasha, however, in his conversation with Sir A. Ryan represented the mission to Sana as being mainly in the nature of a voyage of discovery, conceived with a view to the exploration of a situation of which no one knows very much. III. —Relations with States outside Arabia. British Empire. 36. The Transjordan frontier question hung as a cloud over the general position between His Majesty’s Government and the Hejaz-Nejd duiing the whole [192 d—2] c10 / two months. It did not prevent the discussion of other business, but it necessitated the postponement of various questions and imposed caution in the handling of others lest an already tense situation should be aggravated. On the 1st April Sheikh \usuf Yasin sought an interview with Sir A. Ryan, under the King’s instructions, with the express object of expressing the perplexity created in Ibn Saud’s mind by the recent severity exhibited by His Majesty’s Government and the rigour of the Minister’s own language on certain subjects, notably the questions of the Eastern Telegraph Company’s cable account. Sir A. Ryan explained that there was no change in His Majesty’s Government’s fundamental attitude towards Ibn Saud, but said that they dealt with questions on their individual merits. The Transjordan question was one of such capital importance that it might affect general relations. The Eastern Telegraph Company question was not on the same plane, but the Legation had taken a strong line because it had become a scandal. The Minister gave examples of the efforts made to prevent an admittedly acute situation from being still further envenomed, e.g., the avoidance by His Majesty’s Government of all publicity in connexion with the Transjordan crisis and the restraint which he has himself exercised in dealing with the question of chauffeurs (paragraphs 9 to 13), although he felt very strongly about it. 37. All passages of arms notwithstanding, relations remained as friendly as could be expected throughout the two months. In spite of the electrical character of Sir A. Ryan’s audience on the 2nd March to discuss Transjordan, the King invited him to a second audience on the 4th March to discuss more ordinary business. Various social courtesies helped to limit the area of tension, notably the Legation dinner on the 8th April in honour of Nuri Pasha. At the time of and after the pasha's visit, friendly personal communications passed between Sir F. Humphrys and Ibn Saud. They related partly to a gift of two wireless sets, which, after various accidental delays, were offered by the High Commissioner to the King on his own behalf, and that of His Majesty's Govern ment as a souvenir of the Lupin Conference. The message addressed to His Majesty on the occasion of their delivery contained a formal expression of the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government in addition to that of Sir Francis’s personal sentiments. Money Order Agreement with India. 38. See paragraph 33 of January-February report. This matter advanced a stage in the direction of bringing the text up to date on lines agreed upon in 1929; but the agreement had not been actually concluded up to the end of April. France. 39. The treaty negotiations (January-February report, paragraph 36) continued throughout the two months. Both sides continue to be reticent. The French have found Sheikh Yusuf Yasin difficult and complain of his meticulous ness over forms of expression. It is understood that the latest phase has been one of slowing down rather than progress. Italy. 40. The position of the treaty negotiations (January-February report, paragraph 37) appears to be similar to that between Hejaz-Nejd and France; but the Italian consul is even more reticent than the French Charge d’Affaires. Germany. 41. Herr de Haas informed the foreign representatives on the 24th March of his appointment as German consul for the Hejaz. He had previously obtained an exequatur from the Hejazi Government, probably the first issued under the Saudian regime. In conversation with Sir A. ftyan he foreshadowed the possibility of a career consul being appointed in a year or so. He left for Germany via Constantinople in April for mixed family and business reasons, and leftI i r 11 \ another German merchant in charge of the consulate. Herr de Haas had not secured the Government benzine contract up to the time he left. He told Sir A. Ryan in March that he had reached a point some little time before at which he believed it to be definitely arranged, but had then been put off from day to day. The reason apparently was financial stringency. The Netherlands. 42. The Dutch Charge d’Affaires was absent during the whole two months on the tour mentioned in paragraph 41 of the January-February report. The work of the Legation was carried on by M. Adriaanse, who is to succeed M. van der Meulon later in the year. Egypt. 43. The Egyptian consul Hassan Bey-al-Achmouni was superseded in obscure circumstances at the end of March. He w T as obviously disconcerted, and, though he put a good face on it, he considered himself to have been treated cavalierly by his Government, which announced the appointment of his successor without providing him with a new post. The new consul, Hafiz Bey Amer, arrived on the 29th March. He hails from Tantah, where he at one time practised as an advocate. He later held judicial posts at Assiout and Alexandria. Pie has had no previous diplomatic or consular experience. When he first called he made an unfavourable impression on Sir A. Ryan, but has been agreeable in subsequent intercourse. He knows very little French and has only an indifferent knowledge of English. He appears to be a devout Moslem. 44. In half-revelations to Sir A. Ryan before leaving early in April, Hassan Bey said that his political position had been embarrassing since his visit to Egypt in December (December report, section 12). He said that he had not brought back a written reply to the letter which Ibn Saud had sent by his hand to King Faud. The latter had merely sent a verbal message (cf. January- February report, paragraph 39). He had thus been left in the air and he did not know whether his successor had brought back the awaited written reply. According to a rumour, which is probably a mere scandalous invention, Hassan Bey’s recall was due to a report having reached Egypt that he had sold himself to Ibn Saud. Persia. 45. The Persian Charge d’Affaires returned to Jedda about the beginning of April after an absence of some nine months. He brought with him his secretary and the secretary’s wife, who is his own sister. This lady appears to have been responsible for the derelict state of the Persian Legation since the 30th July (December report, section 14). Habibulla Khan, when he left in June, told the secretary that he must hold the fort. The lady was displeased, and, having a pull with both, telegraphed to her husband that she was extremely ill. He closed the Legation and hurried to her side to find her perfectly well. In relating this story, Habibulla Khan displays more appreciation of his sister’s enterprise than displeasure at his brother-in-law’s desertion. Afghanistan. 46. Afghanistan provided the surprise packet of the period under review. A mission from Kabul arrived inconspicuously in Jedda on or about the 3rd April, headed by a bearded officer of Nadir Khan s Court. Its ostensible object was to confirm good relations and make the pilgrimage. About the time of its arrival a report reached the Government of India from the bazaars of Lahore that the ex-King Amanullah w T as about to visit the Hejaz. A similar rumour ran round Mecca and Jedda on the 4th April, apparently as a lesult of the ex-King having sent a precursor with a letter to Ibn Saud. The news was confirmed from Italy, where he was still making a secret of his movements. There was further confirmation from Egypt in due course, and on the 14th April [192 d—2] C 27 ^ j 12 mm Sheikh Yusuf Yasin told Sir A. Ryan that Amanullah was indeed coming. He added spontaneously that Ibn Saud liked Nadir Khan better because he was a better Moslem, but could deny no Moslem access to the holy places. 47. The ex-King, with his wife's uncle and brother, embarked in a Khedivial steamer at Suez on the 14th April. He beguiled the first days of the voyage with a gramophone, but on the last he prayed. He landed at Jedda in pilgrim garb on the 18th April. He was received with great ceremony, although it is uncertain whether military honours were rendered. In the afternoon he went on to Mecca. Late that evening he performed the preliminary ritual with great unction, even to the shedding of tears; and pilgrims from Afghanistan and the Punjab shouted “Long live Amanullah!' Ibn Saud had himself intended to visit Jedda on the 18th April. He postponed his visit in order to avoid the appearance of having come to meet the ex-King. They exchanged visits in Mecca on the 19th and Amanullah was accorded the honour of being allowed to Like part in the annual sweeping of the Kaaba. He was present but did not speak at the King’s international Moslem banquet on the 24th April. In due course he took his part in the pilgrimage and on the 30th April he proceeded to Medina. 48. The ex-King’s primary object would appear to have been to rehabilitate himself by proving his excellence as a Moslem and also by purging himself of any possible lapses in the past. Certain activities of his before he came to the Hejaz, including the distribution of a manifesto in India and other countries, indicate that the rehabilitation may be part of a forward policy having for its object his return to the Afghan throne; and his visit to Mecca has served the further purpose of enabling him to make contact with a great variety of Afghans and others. During his stay there he was much frequented and was active in propaganda on the lines of accusing Nadir Khan of black treachery, cursing the British and affirming his resolve never to desert Afghanistan. The Legation has obtained a copy of a long pamphlet in Persian, probably incidental with the manifesto mentioned above, which he circulated in Mecca'. Apart from the miscellaneous pilgrims, wdiether Afghans, especially Kandaharis, and Indians, especially Punjabis, who sympathise with him, the most notable persons concerned in or with x\manullah’s visit to Mecca may perhaps be grouped as follows :— (1) The King and his immediate suite. (2) A group consisting of Ghulam Nabi, late Minister (of Nadir Khan) in Turkey, Shuja-ud-Dowleh, former Minister (of Amanullah Khan) in London, and two lesser diplomatics formerly or still employed in Angora. These arrived in the same ship as the ex-King, but Ghulam Nabi is said to have refused Ibn Sand’s hospitality to mark disapproval of his kindness to an enemy of Nadir Khan and afterwards to have asked a favour himself from Amanullah. (3) The Kabul delegation, reinforced by a certain Maulvi Saif-ur-Rahman, who came separately from India. These consented to visit Amanullah, but apparently told him that Afghanistan was getting on very nicely indeed without him. (4) The Afghan Minister at Cairo, who arrived a few days after the ex-King. He would appear to be old-world and pious, and there is no indication of his sympathising with Amanullah, Avhom he may, indeed, have come to watch. (5) Leading Indian revolutionaries of the type of Moulvi Obeidullah, formerly, if not still, a Soviet protege, once a “ Silk Letter ” conspirator, now a preacher in Mecca. IV.—Am Matters. Hejaz Air Force. 49. His Majesty’s Minister had further conversations with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin early in March on the situation described in paragraph 42 of the January- February report. At one moment he thought he had paved the way for the dismissal of Pilot Lowe and the retention of the other two pilots until the expiry of their contracts, although the King expressed his wish to liquidate the whole of the present staff in due course and a desire for the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in recruiting a complete new staff of pilots and mechanics at lower13 \ salaries than those originally fixed. On the 19th March, however, the sheikh wrote privately that the King had decided to dispense with all three pilots, and confirmed his request for assistance in recruiting new personnel. The definiteness of this decision was, and remains, confidential as between the Legation and the Hejazi Government, but the pilots could not fail £o get an inkling otherwise of the fact that they were in danger of discharge. The result was that the chief pilot and Mr. North tendered their resignations in the first ^ days of April, not because of the non-dismissal of Mr. Lowe, but because of their dissatisfaction with the situation as a whole. The situation remained indeter minate up to the end of April. The King avoided acceptance ot the resignation of the two pilots, whom he would like to keep to look after the aeroplanes, until he has made new arrangements, and His Majesty’s Government had taken no decision on his request for assistance in making such new arrangements. 50. Action was still delayed on the Foreign Office instructions regarding the Hejazi Government’s request for assistance in procuring instructional aeroplanes, &amp;c. (January-February report, paragraph 43). A rabian A ir Route. 51. This question (see January-February report, paragraph 45) also remained in abeyance pending the establishment of a more satisfactory situation in regard to the Transjordan frontier. !'&gt;ir A. Ryan informed buad Bey in general conversation on the 21st April that he would soon be reopening the question of landing grounds on the Hasa coast. Fuad Bey asked that action should be postponed until he had had a chance of remedying the deterioration of Anglo-Hejazi relations during his absence Sir A. Ryan agreed to go slow for the time being, doing this all the more readily because of the near approach of the pilgrimage season. V.—Military Matters. 52. There is nothing important to report. VI.— Naval Matters. 53. H.M.S. “ Dahlia ” arrived in Jedda on the 25th April for the visit usually made at the pilgrimage season and remained oyer the end of the month. The visit was a great success and afforded an opportunity for discussing vai ious matters with Commander R. H. Jackson, who, to the regret of everybody, was visiting Jedda for the last time before giving up his command. Nothing that passed in these discussions calls for special record. There were no other naval visits, British or foreign. 54. His Majesty’s Government announced in March their decision regarding naval salutes for Hejazi dignitaries. Apart from those given to Royalty, the only salutes to be given are as follows :— Ministerial heads of fighting services Governor of Jedda Governors of other ports ... Guns. 17 13 7 55. Information was received in March regarding personal conversations between Captain Dicken, Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea sloops, and Admiial Deville (January-February report, paragraph 50), when they met at Port Sudan, from which it emerged, of course quite unofficially— {a) That the French asked the assent of the Hejazi Government to all visits to Hejazi ports, including Jedda; (b) That they took less rigid views than His Majesty’s Government of salutes and were willing to accord them whenever they thought they would give pleasure; and (c) That they were indifferent to measures for the repression of slave traffic in the Red Sea.VII.— Pilgrimage. 56. The 1931 pilgrimage justified poor expectations. The grand total of pilgrims from overseas was barely 40,000, about half the number in 1930. Alter several days of doubt, it was held that the new moon had been seen on the evening of Saturday, the 18th April, with the result that the gathering at Arafat took place on Monday, the 27th April. The number of persons present cannot be ^ estimated, but, even allowing for a noticeably large contingent of Yemenis, it is unlikely that there were more than from 10,000 to 20,000 overland pilgrims. Health conditions were excellent, and there were unusually few deaths on Ararat Day or during the ensuing festivals. 57. On the 24th April the King gave his usual banquet for Moslem notables of all nations. He had King Amanullah on his right and Sheikh Ahmed-el-Senussi on his left. He delivered a rousing speech on the need tor unity among Moslems, the all-sufficiency of their faith, and the falsity of the idea that the way to civilisation lay in imitation of Europeans. The speech contained, inter alia, an indirect thrust at a recent utterance by an Indian leader, Shauqat Ali, about “ our brothers the Jews.” The King admitted no brotherhood except fraternity in Islam, and affirmed with a triple oath his desire to see all men united in that faith. Another striking passage in a speech too long to paraphrase fully was one in which he pointed to the Turkish Prince Ahmed Tevhid and recalled how his forbears had defied the Turkish Sultans rather than own themsehes to be slaves of a “ Commander of the Faithful.” The vigour of the King s utter ances was a little toned down by a statement that he was not at war with the \\ orld,. and used the courtesy prescribed by Islam, as long as he was not injured, m respect of his beliefs and his country. -t 58. This speech was rendered into Urdu by the Indian Ismail Ghuznavi. Various other speeches were delivered, including one in English by Sir Abdul Kerim Ghuznavi (paragraph 67). Some little freedom of speech and much diversity of thought prevailed at those banquets, many of the guests at which are far from seeing eye to eye with Ibn Saud. This particular evening is said to have ended in a certain atmosphere of politico-theological malaise. 59. Pilgrims suffered some hardships owing to the effect of the exchange crisis (paragraph 5) on prices. Some of the poorer were hard hit by a regulation suddenly introduced on the 3rd April, compelling foreign pilgrims to hand over their travelling papers to the Jedda agents of the Mecca pilgrim guides in order that they should be sent to the guides at Mecca to be held by them until the end of the season. When this regulation was introduced an attempt was made to apply one of its articles in such a way that pilgrims should not come themselves to their Legations or consulates. The' British Legation successfully resisted this, but was unable to get round the provision that pilgrims should be deprived of their travelling papers. The effect of the new regulation is to convert these into a sort of pledge for the payment of sums payable to the guides by way of remuneration or in respect of taxes for which the guides are in turn responsible to the Government. Sir A. Ryan made strong official reservations and reported the matter home for instructions. 60. Otherwise this unusually small pilgrimage presented few special features. The use of cars between Mecca and Arafat, which caused much confusion last year, appears to have been somewhat severely controlled. There were no reports of the circulation of forged Indian notes (January-February report, paragraph 51, and previous reports). „ , . . 61 The smallness of the pilgrimage reacted on the number of ships in port at Jedda but the traditional “ Haj Regatta,” revived in 1929 after an interval of several years, was successfully held on the 30th April. His Majesty’s sloop “ Dahlia ” and eight merchant ships, all British save one, took part. 62. Arrangements were made by the Legation with the commander of the “ Dahlia ” to enable Moslem naval ratings to make the pilgrimage, as a small number had done in 1930. This year no fewer than twenty-two Somalis, employed in H.M.S. “Dahlia” and “Endeavour,” which was at Port Sudan, took advantage of the arrangement. ^ ^ , A/r 63. Advantage was taken of the visits of Major Thomson and Mr. Champion (paragraph 66) to discuss inter alia certain pilgrimage matters, notably with Major Thomson, the question of the West African pilgrims. Major Thomsonand Sir A. Ryan agreed on a scheme, which they hoped would go a fair way to secure the objects of the Nigerian Government without imposing excessive burdens on the Sudan authorities and the Legation in Jedda. The proposals were in due course approved by the Sudan Government. VIII.— Slavery. 64. Two male slaves were manumitted in March and April. The Hejazi authorities continue to show occasional signs of obstructiveness (January- February report, paragraph 54). In April they objected to the departure ot a slave on the ground that his ex-master had claims against him. The matter required careful handling, as there appeared to be something in the allegation, and the main grounds for complaint were the dilatoriness of the authorities and their obvious sympathy with the ex-owner. The case was still outstanding at the end of April. There are signs of difficulty in another direction, as the Italian authorities, who have hitherto facilitated the embarkation of a proportion of freed slaves to Massowah, seem less ready than formerly to receive them there. IX.— Miscellaneous. Approaches to Yambo and Jedda. , 65. The local authorities completed early in March the restoration of the two beacons swept away at Yambo in December (January-February report, paragraph 60). They made a good job of it. Four new buoys have been procured for Jedda, but had not been laid down up to the end of April. Visitors to the Hejaz. 66. An unusual number of Europeans and other visitors of consequence came to Jedda in March and April. Among them were the following :— Major Thomson, Commissioner at Port Sudan and Mrs. Thomson, stayed for a few days at the Legation in March. Mr. R. S. Champion, Protectorate Secretary at Aden and Mrs. Champion visited the Legation in April. A German savant, Dr. Carl Ratjens, stayed in Jedda for a few days in April on his way to the Yemen, where he had already done archaeological work and has apparently established a good footing with the Iman. Another German, Mr. Willy Hansen, the head of a Hamburg firm now per manently represented in Jedda, was here about the same time as Dr. Carl Ratjens. Mr. Twitchell, the American engineer employed by Mr. C. R. Crane on the motor-road from Hodeidah to Sana, arrived in April with his English wife. The visit was the outcome of an arrangement made between the King and Mr. Crane, who during his visit to Jedda ofiered to send Mr. Twitchell to look into water possibilities in the Hejaz. They were allowed to make two journeys, one apparently in the neighbourhood of Jedda, the other it is said northward towards Yambo and Wejh. They had not returned from the second expedition up to the end of the month. Another American, a Mr. Robinson, who is sailing round the world in three years in a ketch with one South Sea Islander as crew, lay in Jedda harbour for a week or so in April. He related many amusing adventures on the Arabian coast, including one at Lith, where he was forcibly entreated and thrown into prison, partly, it would appear, because he did not realise that he had passed from the Yemen into another country. Yet another American, an elderly Mrs. Douthirt, arrived later in April. She is said to have played the piano before most of the crowned heads in Europe or the world. She came to the anti-musical Hejaz to gratify a more modest ambition, that of once more seeing Mr. Philby, whom she had previously visited in Jedda 67. The pilgrimage brought various notables, including ex-King Amanullah and the numerous Afghans mentioned elsewhere; Prince Ahmed Tevhid, a son of Prince Seifuddin of Turkey, who was himself a son of Sultan Abdul Aziz; Sir16 Abdul Kerim Ghuznavi, a member of the Council of the Governor of Bengal, who is much interested in pilgrimage matters; a prominent sheikh from the Kordofan Province and two stipendiary chiefs from the Aden Protectorate; a former Egyptian Minister of State, Enis Pasha; and some notorious Indian 3luti&lt; revolutionaries. 4” Legation Staff. ^ 68.

IN view of the increased pressure on the Legation at Jedda, it has been decided, with the approval of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to issue these reports at intervals of two months in future. It is hoped that this will not materially reduce their value to the recipients, and that it will enable the^ Legation to issue the reports more punctually, although on the present occasion special reasons have caused delay. The following arrangement will be adopted in future :— The main divisions will be retained with Roman numerals and cross- headings. Sub-sections will be shown by unnumbered cross-headings. The paragraphs will be numbered consecutively throughout to facilitate back- reference. This opportunity is taken of mentioning that the spelling Jedda is con secrated by Foreign Office usage. Whatever may be said for or against it, it is convenient that the place where the Legation is should be known in official English by a fixed name. If other posts can reconcile it with their philological principles to adopt the Foreign Office version it will be much appreciated. The Legation is conscious of many defects in its own spelling and will welcome suggestions from other posts as to the spelling of important place-names in their respective spheres. I.—Internal Affairs. Ibn Saud. 1. The King returned to Mecca on the 20th January and spent the whole of Ramadan there. He came to Jedda on the 25th February and stayed over the end of the month. On the day of his arrival he held a formal reception of foreign representatives. The principal object of his visit was to receive the rich American Mr. Charles R. Crane, who, having come from the United States specially for the purpose, arrived in Jedda on the 25th February, accompanied by Mr. G. Antonius. An account of a previous visit by Mr. Crane to Jedda will be found in the report for December 1926. It may be remarked incidentally that, at that time, he was mal vu in French and British circles owing to his connexion with Syrian revolutionaries. At present he creates the impression of being an innocuous old gentleman, with wide interests and a passion for recording the many things he has seen pass “ into history.” Ibn Saud showered attentions on Mr. Crane, for whose benefit a Bedouin review was held on the 27th February (see paragraph 9). The foreign representatives were also present, and the King entertained them and Mr. Crane at dinner the same evening. On the following day he honoured Mr. Philby with his company at tea, the principal members of the party being much the same. Ibn Saud appeared to have derived benefit from his visit to Nejd and was in his best form during his stay in Jedda. The unusual coolness and pleasantness of the climate earned his commendation. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. The unsatisfactory state of affairs resulting from the illness of Fuad Bey Hamza (December report, paragraph 1 (6)) continued throughout January, and no business could be done by personal interview. The Emir Feisal visited Jedda on the 8th and 9th January for the celebration of the King’s accession. He received Sir A. Ryan at a specially arranged interview on the 8th January, but it was almost entirely of a formal nature. It was afterwards explained that he had visited Jedda as Viceroy of the Hejaz only. He returned on the 28th January, accompanied by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. Owing to Fuad Bey’s illness, which culminated in his departure for Egypt on the 30th January, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin became Acting Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, remaining at the same time private secretary, head of the Political Section of the Divan and general factotum to the King. ‘ The Prince having formally received the foreign representatives, apparently with some exceptions, on the 29th January, arranged to receive His Majesty’s Minister for business on the 30th January. When Sir A. Rvan went to keep this appointment the palace resembled that of the Sleeping Beauty, with the Beauty and nearly everyone else in the background. Neither the Prince, Under-Secretary, A.D.C. nor servants were to be seen, and3 ■wr^m i wm \ Sir A. Ryan left, after a lively conversation with the A.D.C., who appeared as he was going out. In the event it appeared that the principals had a good excuse for everything except mismanagement. The Prince had been taken ill after going to mosque. Sheikh Yusuf had been seeing Fuad Bey off, and was ^greatly taken aback when Sir A. Ryan passed him without stopping on his way ^▼back to the Legation. As for the subordinates, they were doubtless sleeping through the Ramadan fast. Notwithstanding all this, the reception accorded to the British representative on his first business visit to a new Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared to be too cavalier to be tolerated. Sir A. Ryan demanded satisfaction, and after a first insufficient attempt to placate him. Sheikh Yusuf called and offered an unqualified apology All was thus happily settled by dinner-time. 3. This incident, although regrettable, cleared the air. Sir A. Ryan had let it be known that he expected his formal visit to be returned, a courtesy which a Minister of princely rank might have thought he could dispense with. The Emir called on the foreign representatives on the 1st February and stayed half an hour at the British Legation. He had on the previous day received Sir A. Ryan for business, but after his round of visits he collapsed with severe malaria. He returned to Mecca on the 3rd or 4th February and went into the country for change. Sheikh Yusuf remained and put in much work before going back to Mecca on the 6th February. He proved more reasonable in discussion than had been anticipated. His chief, the Emir, recovered in due course, but up to the end of February he showed no interest in or capacity for foreign affairs. Sheikh Yusuf effectively dealt with them throughout the whole period. He is very much the King’s man and Ibn Sand has shown a tendency to put him in the forefront, although it is clear that he himself still pulls the strings. Finance. * 4. The financial situation went from bad to worse early in the year. Pilgrims have come forward in somewhat greater numbers than was anticipated, but the total number from overseas seems unlikely to exceed 50,000. Revenue must suffer accordingly. The two most notable indications of Treasury straits have been a heavy increase in customs duty on most staple imports, which was announced in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 6th February; and a temporary decline of the silver currency, which became acute in February. The silver riyal, the value of which is officially fixed at 10 to the gold pound sterling, slumped to 13 or even lower in Jedda and Mecca. The Government found themselves short of gold, although it always seems possible to produce some at a pinch. They made strong efforts to restore the balance between riyals and pounds. It may be said in anticipation of the next report that they succeeded, but only by prohibiting the export of gold and by arrangements with the Dutch Bank in Jedda, the exact nature of which has not been disclosed, to accept riyals at 10 plus a small margin in payment for drafts on foreign countries. It was suggested! that Air. Crane might in some way come to the help of Ibn Sand. There is no indication that he did so. Further rumours of American financial assistance were floated when, about the same time as Air. Crane, Air. Dickerson, the commercial secretary of the United States Legation at Cairo, visited Jedda in the course of an extensive tour. On hearing that the bazaars were talking of an American loan to the tune of £1,000,000. Air. Dickerson laughed. 5. His Alajesty's Alinister took up with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 5th February the outstanding claims of the Government of India, the Eastern Telegraph Company and Alessrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (September to November report, paragraph 3 (5)). The position at the end of February was that .the Government of India claim was still completely in the air; the Eastern Telegraph Company had some prospect of being paid, but the Government were trying hard to engineer a settlement in riyals; and Alessrs. Gellatly, Hankey’s situation was a good deal easier. In the last-named case the financial authorities on the 1st February deposited with the firm 55,000 riyals, with promise of redemption in six weeks to cover the balance of £5.000 still due in respect of their loan to the Government. At one moment it looked as though they might be hit by a refusal to accept drafts on customs, of which they held large quantities, in payment of duty, this being the only means of realising them without loss . The idea of thus dishonouring their own drafts was, however, relinquished bv [88 ff — 11 g 2 fthe Government, the wages of the unfortunate Sudanese chauffeurs (December report, paragraph (2)), were still greatly in arrear at the end of February. 6. The Government are heavily indebted in other directions. They are said! to owe the Qusaibi firm some £80,000 and the rich Governor of Jedda £4,000. In January, however, the director of the Dutch Bank expressed the view that the whole floating debt did not exceed £500,000, and that the country should b^ solvent with good management. Good management is, unfortunately, the last thing that can be hoped for. The only economy consistently practised is that of evading payment of debts, although certain services are starved, e.g., the supply of doctors in the sanitary service has decreased in recent years. General. 7. There was no news of any important development in the interior in January and February, although silly rumours of the usual kind were circulated in connexion with the King’s visit to Nejd, how, for instance, there had been dissension in the Royal family; the King had practically fled from Riadh, &amp;c. Early in January there were reports, more substantial in appearance, of trouble with the Ajman tribe, but they were not confirmed. 8. Ibn Saud’s accession was celebrated in the Hejaz on the 8th and 9th January in a manner similar to that of last year (report for January 1930, paragraph 23). The view held by some that such celebrations are un-Islamic seems to have been definitely set aside. 9. Much excitement was aroused in February on its being announced that on the second day of the Td festival there had been a war dance at Mecca, in which the King himself had taken part together with several of the princes. According to one account this was the sequel to a demonstration by Meccans on the previous day, the reception of which by the King proved to be favourable, whereupon the King’s own Nejdis, of whom a great number would appear to have come back with him from Riadh, asked to be allowed to perform. This happy accident theory is discounted by the fact that a dance of the same kind, though on a smaller scale, wms a feature of the celebration of the King’s accession at a sort of official fete chamyetre between Jedda and Mecca on the 9th January. Anyhow the Nejdi dance was done again at a Bedouin review in Jedda on the 27th February. On this occasion the King was present, but only the princes took part, led by the Emir Feisal, who performed very gracefully in front of the diplomats accredited to the Government in which he is Minister for Foreign Affairs. Next day the Jeddawis asked to be allowed to show what they could do, and for several days demonstrations on a considerable scale took place outside the palace. 10. These events have probably a political significance. The Nejdi dancing is a revival of a practice wffiich has, it seems, been in abeyance for fifteen or twenty years, although the skill shown by the dancers proves that it must have been kept up somehow, even though not officially countenanced. It may be taken as a working theory, provided it be not assumed too confidently, that Ibn Saud is anxious to efface some of the differences between the Hejaz and Nejd, and is prepared to ride his subjects in both kingdoms on a looser reign than is admitted by the extreme tenets of Wahhabism. Drums w T ere a notable feature in the dancing demonstrations and even more musical instruments have of late been tolerated. Ibn Saud built formerly on an aggressive Wahhabism, which was turned against him by the rebels of 1929. He would now appear to be building on compromise with a world in which it pays to seek popularity and a flesh which, in the Hejaz at least, has always been weak. But he remains too good a Moslem to have much use for the devil, at any rate the foreign devil. II. —Frontier Questions. Transjordan. MacDonnell Investigation. 11. No information reached Jedda during January and February regarding the action taken by His Majesty’s Government on Mr. MacDonnell’s report; nor was any reply returned to the Hejazi Government’s note of the 24th December regarding the Beni Atiya (December report, section 5 (a)). 'Current Raiding. 12. The lull noted in the December report, section 5 (b), continued until late in January. Transjordan complained of one raid from Nejd on the 25th January. Up to the end of February the Hejazi Government had alleged a raid from Trans jordan on a date between the 3rd and 7th February and two others on the 10th and 13th February. On three occasions His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan drew the attention of the Legation at Jedda to reports of preparations for raids. These reports were duly communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Hejazi Government suggested that the first report had its origin in certain measures taken to collect taxes in the Wadi Sirhan. They indignantly denied the later reports and ascribed them to the activities of Captain Glubb, the desert control officer in Transjordan, who had been appointed in pursuance of the programme adopted by His Majesty’s Government last autumn. 13. Correspondence also passed regarding various raids alleged to have taken place in the latter part of 1930. In this, as well as in the correspondence relative to the raids and rumours of raids mentioned in the last paragraph, the Legation sought to impress on the Hejazi Government the importance of taking measures on their side as efficacious as those adopted in Transjordan and more especially of arranging for direct communication between the authorities on both sides of the frontier, as provided in article 3 of the Hadda Agreement. The correspondence thus bore not only on particular raids and rumours, but on the general situation. Its details were, however, submerged in the crisis to be described in the following paragraphs. General Frontier Situation. 14. While the correspondence mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs was proceeding, the visit of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Jedda at last enabled Sir A. Ryan to carry out, on the 3rd February, his instructions (December report, section 5 (c)) to discuss the general situation of the frontier orally. He took the sheikh over the whole of the recent ground, reproached the Hejazi Government with their failure to reply seriously to the British memorandum of October, disposed of the interim reply which had been their only attempt at a direct answer up to date and strongly deprecated the practical condonation of Nejdi raids in Fuad Bey Hamza’s note of the 29th November. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s reaction was unexpectedly favourable. He, indeed, made play with arguments on his own side. He developed the thesis that His Majesty’s Government were really responsible for Transjordan and that their interposition between the parties served as a protection to Transjordanian raiders. He manifested openly the hostility of his Government towards Captain Glubb, a hostility dating from the time when that officer was employed in the Southern Desert of Iraq. He explained, however, that the Hejazi Government were preparing a statement of the measures they were taking on their side of the frontier. He added that the King was taking active steps to bring article 3 of the Hadda Agreement into operation. His Majesty had appointed Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeid, the former Hejazi agent at the MacDonnell investigation, to be Inspector of Bedouin on the frontier. En Neshmi had been removed from the Governorate of Jauf. The sheikh asked for suggestions as to the best means of providing for the communi cation contemplated in article 3 of the Hadda Agreement. 15. Before this conversation was reported home a storm of indignation had been aroused in Downing Street by a report from Captain Glubb. This report dealt mainly with the situation resulting from the last considerable raid from Nejd, w T hich had taken place in October and the victims of which were the Howaitat tribe. Captain Glubb's main conclusions were that the Howaitat, deprived of the camels then captured, were in a state of starvation and could not easily be restrained from counter-raiding, especially as their 800 or more camels were known to be pasturing close to the frontier on the other side; that Ibn Saud, seconded by En Neshmi, was directly responsible for the raids conducted or encouraged by the latter in 1930; and that the King was pursuing a deliberate policy of seducing the Howaitat into his own allegiance, a plan which, if successful, would be disastrous to British prestige. Captain Glubb’s views were endorsed, subject to some differences on points of detail, by the principal Britishauthorities in Iransjordan, including His Majesty’s High Commissioner, who expressed an even more serious view of the consequences of a secession of Trans jordan Bedouins to Ibn Sand, in view of the difficult situation it would create in the event of trouble in Palestine. 16. On the 6th February the Foreign Office instructed Sir A. Ryan to make the strongest possible representations. As these instructions had in effect crossec^ his report on his own recent action, he suggested that, having regard to the more favourable turn taken by his conversations in Jedda, it might be unwise to take so strenuous a line as that contemplated at home. There ensued an active corres pondence, the result of which was that the Foreign Office consented to an attempt being made to reach an understanding with Ibn Saud, but indicated the lines on which the representations were to be made to him in a precise memorandum, the terms of which were in no way to be weakened and a copy of which was to be left with the King, if Sir A. Ryan thought it advisable. Every effort was to be made to obtain a definite reply within four days and the King was to be informed, if necessary, that this was expected by His Majesty’s Government. 17. On receipt of his final instructions His Majesty's Minister, who had contemplated a strong but conversational onslaught on the King, thought that, as the basis of the representations was to be a long memorandum in set terms, it would, after all, be better to communicate it first to the Hejazi Government and see the King afterwards. His Majesty’s Government having concurred, the Legation forwarded it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 28th February, slightly modified in accordance with suggestions made by His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan. The memorandum was accompanied by a short covering note requesting an early audience to discuss the question and intimating His Majesty’s Government’s desire to obtain a definite reply to their memorandum as soon as possible. A separate note sent earlier in the same day, also under instructions, strongly repudiated the aspersions which had been cast on Captain Glubb in the course of the conversations and correspondence in February. 18. In their memorandum of the 28th February His Majesty’s Government propounded the following points in the nature of suggestions or demands, with the necessary explanatory comments : — (1) Noting Ibn Saud’s expressed readiness to bring article 3 of the Hadda Agreement into operation and having in view the proved necessity for immediate co-operation between the authorities on both sides of the frontier, they proposed, in pursuance of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s request for suggestions as to the method of initiating such co-operation, that Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid should meet (a) to examine all repre sentatives and claims regarding raids since the 1st August; (b) to arrange for immediate restoration of loot on both sides; and (c) to arrange for the intercommunication of information and mutual restoration of loot in future. (2) They asked that Ibn Zeid should be invested with full executive powers, and that he and Captain Glubb should have power to call upon the representative sheikhs to put forward claims, &amp;c. (3) Having explained the inability of the Transjordan authorities to maintain the recent improvement of the situation unless immediate steps should be taken to return the loot captured from their tribes since the 1st August, His Majesty’s Government dwelt on various flagrant features of those raids, including the proved culpability of En Neshmi and his public statement that Ibn Saud permitted raiding into Transjordan, a statement widely believed and not effectively disproved. They said they “ must insist that if this has not already been done, the strongest measures should be taken to counteract the effect of En Neshmi’s action in giving countenance to raiding and to make it publicly known that His Majesty King Abdul Aziz expressly disavows and condemns it.” They expressed hope that a recent report of En Neshmi’s appointment to the command of tribal forces would prove to be unfounded. (4) They asked the Hejazi Government to inform them as soon as possible that they agreed to the proposed meeting and that Ibn Zeid would receive full powers to deal with the matters proposed, including the immediate restitution of camels and other loot captured from Trans-Jordan tribes since the 1st August. They added that Captain Glubb would be authorised to arrange for the restitution of any loot identified as having been taken from Hejazi or Nejdi tribes. (5) Finally, His Majesty’s Government, having regard to the urgent necessity for restoring the camels looted from Transjordan, offered British ^ co-operation in the Wadi Sirhan, if the Hejazi Government should find themselves confronted with any practical difficulty in returning them immediately. 19. The sequel to this firm all-but-ultimatum will be related in the next report. To complete the present section it is only necessary to add that during the period under review it was decided under Captain Glubb’s advice to introduce various modifications into the scheme adopted last autumn for the improvement of the frontier control on the Transjordan side. Druse Refugees in Nejd. 20. The question of the disposal of Sultan A1 Atrash and his followers, who have for some time been in Nejd close to the Transjordan frontier, again engaged attention early in the year. There were last year two alternative proposals, viz., that Ibn Saud should be asked to move them further into the interior or that arrangements should be made for the party to be allowed to settle in Iraq. No decision had apparently been taken up to the end of February. The presence of the refugees so close to it is a thorn in the side of Transjordan. According to one account, which cannot be vouched for, the French are for their part displeased with Ibn Saud for affording hospitality to the party. Iraq. “ Bon-Yoisinaqe,' &amp;c. 21. Following on the transactions related in section 6 {a) of the December report and after further consultations between Bagdad and London, King Feisal telegraphed to Ibn Saud on the 7th February proposing that his Prime Minister should take advantage of a recess of the Iraq Parliament to visit Jedda immediately after Ramadan in order to sign the “ Bon-Voisinage ” Treaty, and discuss all outstanding questions including extradition. A Bagdad telegram to the Colonial Office of the 8th February showed that Nuri Pasha also proposed to deal with claims, trade facilities and pilgrim traffic, besides showing and explaining to Ihn Saud the new Iraq-Transjordan Treaty (which he was to sign at Amman en route) and discussing the case of Ibn Mashhur. Ibn Saud replied at once in terms of cordial acquiescence. Things looked all the rosier because it was known that the Iraq Government were not so uncompromising about extradition as might have been supposed from their letter of the middle of December and because Ibn Sand on his side accepted in a letter written bv his Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 29th January King Feisal’s explanation regarding his £30,000 award, adding only that the money would be paid when a settlement of other outstanding questions had been reached. A more conciliatory letter on the former point was addressed by the Iraq Government to the Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 1st February. 22. Alas for the roses that bloomed in Bagdad! When Ibn Saud was at the height of his pleasurable anticipation and full of preparations for the reception of Nuri Pasha, the latter sent a message on the 18th February through Sir F. Humphrys and Sir A. Ryan expressing regret that, owing to delay over pending oil negotiations, he was compelled to postpone his visit. His delay aroused suspicions in the Hejazi mind, which the Legation in Jedda sought to allay. Things would not have been so bad, had the delay been short or had not the Bagdad press announced that Nuri Pasha was to visit Jedda on Ibn Saud’s invitation to discuss the Arab Alliance. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin came to see Sir A. Ryan on the 26th February, waving a Bagdad newspaper in which this tendentious statement was attributed to Nuri Pasha himself. In the course of a long conversation on the whole position Sir A. Ryan administered all the soothing syrup he could,but the outlookwas not a happyoneat theendof February.Ibn Mashhur. 23. This question, of course, bobbed up again. It always does. On the 7th January the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote a mild note to the Legation paying a tribute to King FeisaFs attitude and enquiring as to the number and names of the companions of Ibn Mashhur whom it was proposed to hand^ over and the arrangements proposed for their delivery. W hile this was still undew consideration, the Minister produced a further note of the 29th January, which inter alia strongly asserted the responsibility of His Majesty s Government for the surrender of ibn Mashhur and explained that he had the King s instructions to discuss the matter orally with His Majesty’s Minister with a view to elucidating the attitude of his Government. The note put two specific questions as to (1) what had passed between His Majesty’s Government and the trench Government regarding the passage of Ibn Mashhur through Syria, and (2) what would be the attitude of His Majesty’s Government if Ibn Mashhur should en I e ^ territory under British influence, e.g., Palestine or Transjordan. The note ended with an offensive remark that ‘ 1 on the reply depends, to a great extent, the degree of confidence to be placed in official Government promises. 24. This note led to two conversations, the first with the Emir Feisal and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 31st January, the second with the sheikh alone on the 1st February. Sir A. Ryan engaged in them not only because of the wish expressed by the Emir, but also because he wished to give His Majesty’s Govern ment plenty of time to consider their attitude. In the first conversation he stated the position as he himself saw it, giving reasons why, in his opinion, His Majesty’s Government had never had a formal responsibility for the return of Ibn Mashhur, though they had done all in their power to promote it. He strongl\ objected to the concluding phrase in the Minister’s note, and elicited a lame explanation that it referred to the value not of British but Iraqi promises. The second conversation was acrimonious but fertile. 25. The matter cropped up again in the discussion on the 26th February (see paragraph 22) of the general position between Iraq and Hejaz-Nejd. Sheikh Yusuf remarked that his Government had been willing to postpone the Ibn Mashhur question until it could be discussed with Nuri Pasha, and had refrained from publicity. He accused the Iraq Government of having rushed into print with their version, and suggested that the Hejazi Government might have to alter their attitude. He was referring, it appeared, to the leading article in the “ Near East ” of the 5th February. Sir A. Ryan drew his attention to the letter in the same paper of the 25th December, in which Mr. Philby, a person known to be in the closest touch with the Hejazi Government, had publicly ventilated their grievance in a more extravagant form than they themselves had officially given it, for Mr. Philbv had not only accused His Majesty’s Government of failure to fulfil an obligation, but had stated that the obligation was one which they had admitted. The rest of the conversation on this point is not worth recording. . 26. ^ On the 2nd February the Legation had forwarded to the Minister tor Foreign Affairs a list received from Bagdad of persons and property which they were prepared to hand over on the frontier at any date convenient to Ibn Saud. In reply to an advance intimation of this on the 1st February, Sheikh Yusuf remarked that no arms were mentioned. This gave rise to some inconclusive correspondence between Sir F. Humphrys and the Iraqi Government, and Sir Francis thought the matter had better be left for Nuri Pasha to discuss in Jedda As for 'the Emir Feisal’s note of the 28th January, which directly affected His Majesty’s Government, they had not replied to it up to the end of February. Koweit and Bahrein. Persian Gulf Negotiations. 27. There were no important developments in January and February in connexion with the proposed discussion of Koweit questions, or, as Ibn Saud would like it to be, a general discussion of “ Persian Gulf Questions.” A certain amount of correspondence passed on incidental matters with results which may be summed up as follows :— [a) The proposal that the Political Resident in Bushire should visit Ibn Saud (December report, 7 {a) ) followed the King to Riadh. butreached him too late to be acted on. On his return to Mecca, he addressed a friendly letter to Sir A. Ryan on the 28th January expressing regret and offering to receive Colonel Biscoe in Jedda. This suggestion was negatived by His Majesty’s Government, and Sir A. Ryan was instructed on the 4th February to return a suitably polite reply. He conveyed the substance of this through Sheikh Y usuf Yasin, but owing to various delays postponed any direct communica tion to the King until he could make it orally. The general position at the end of February was that it was hoped that an opportunity for a meeting between Ibn Saud and Colonel Biscoe in Nejd might present itself later, and it was considered that there was no such emergency about the Koweit questions as to necessitate their being discussed before the autumn. Meanwhile, it appears from various reports of the Political Resident that there has been a certain rapprochement between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. (b) A suggestion was put forward in February that Colonel Biscoe might take advantage of Ibn Saud’s invitation to Jedda to write himself to the King. It was considered at the Legation that it would be better not to do this and to confine action for the time being to the communication referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph. (c) His Majesty’s Government decided in February to take a firm line with the Iraqi and Hejazi Governments regarding the allocation of the £10,000 paid by the Hejazi Government last summer in fulfilment of the promise given by ibn Saud to Colonel Biscoe in January 1930 (see report for September to November, 11 (&amp;) ). It was arranged that £7,000 should be given to Iraq and £3,000 to Kow r eit, as originally intended. The necessary drafts were sent by the Legation to Bagdad and Bushire on the 10th February, and the Hejazi Govern ment were duly informed. They did not reply, but it is clear from the earlier correspondence and various conversations that they are unlikely to contest the allocation, which interests them only as far as it will affect the total amount eventually payable to Iraq under the settlement mentioned in paragraph 23. (d) A question which arose early in 1930 regarding the treatment of Bahrainis in El-Hasa gave rise to instructions to His Majesty’s Minister in May to make general representations on their behalf to the Hejaz Government, if he saw no objection. The execution of these instructions having been delayed for more or less accidental reasons, Sir A. Ryan reconsidered the matter on his return from leave. On the 10th February, 1931, he reported that, in his opinion, it would now be preferable to postpone action pending developments in connexion with the Hejazi Law on Nationality and the possible general discussion of Persian Gulf questions. New Trade Route. 28. Little more was heard in January and February of the proposed new route for pilgrims and trade from the Hasa Coast to the Hejaz (December report, section 8). The matter still appears to be engaging attention, however. In the course of general conversation at Mr. Philby’s tea party on the 28th February, Ibn Saud admitted that it was intended to bore for water at Ras Tanuran, which has been thought of as a possible site for a future port. His Majesty said that no actual boring had taken place, but that he had ordered a start to be made after Ramadan. Yemen and A sir. 29. There were still no signs in January and February of any serious repercussion on the relations between the Imam and Ibn Saud as a result of the latter’s annexation of Asir. Both sides have been reported to be strengthening their military forces. In January the Italian Government manifested in London anxiety lest the two parties should come to blows, and suggested that they and His Majesty’s Government should exert a moderating influence on the Imam [88 ff — 1 ] cand the King respectively. His Majesty’s Minister was authorised, if at any time he received categorical information pointing to a danger of conflict, to make such representations as he might consider useful. No situation arose up to the end of February which would justify such intervention, and on the 28th February Sir A. Ryan was directed to take no action. It seems improbable than Ibn Saud, in his present financial straits, would embark on an adventure in the extreme^ south, though the temptation may ultimately be too strong for him; and there has been nothing to show that the measures which the Imam has almost certainly taken on his own side of the Asir frontier are more than defensive. 30. On the 14th February the Foreign Office reviewed the position in regard to Asir in an important paper addressed to the Colonial and India Offices. It analysed the legal situation as regards the consequences of Ibn Saud’s action on the status of Asir, and as regards the treaty between Great Britain and Asir concluded in 1917. The legal conclusions were doubtful, but tended, as regards the treaty of 1917, to the view that, even if it had not previously ceased to operate for other reasons, it must now be regarded as having lapsed owing to the apparent extinction of the Idrisi as an international person, and as not being in its nature an instrument the benefits and obligations of which could be held to have passed to a succession State. On the other hand, the Foreign Office cited the agreements reached between His Majesty’s Government and Italy in the course of the Rome Convention of 1927. The final conclusion from all these considerations was that, in Mr. Henderson’s opinion, it would be best, subject to the concurrence of the departments addressed, to instruct His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda not to commit His Majesty’s Government to recognition of the absorption of Asir into Ibn Saud’s dominions, or to take any action implying such recognition without further instructions. It was suggested that the position regarding the 1917 treaty should be left intact in view of the possibility that it might usefully be invoked, if a turn of the tide should restore some measure of independence to the Idrisi. III. —.Relations with States Outside Arabia. British Empire. ^Courtesies. 31. His Majesty the King telegraphed congratulations to Ibn Saud on the occasion of the anniversary of the latter’s accession, and a suitable reply was returned after an interval just long enough to admit of its having been drawn up by Ibn Saud himself at Riadh. After correspondence with the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Minister attended various ceremonies on the 8th and 9th January, notwithstanding the recent death of the Princess Royal, a bereavement on which, in his father’s absence, the Emir Feisal telegraphed condolences^ both to His Majesty the King and to the Legation in Jedda. The Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London postponed his reception in honour of Ibn Saud s accession until after the Court had gone out of mourning. The deferred reception was held at the Hyde Park Hotel on the 20th February. Consuls at Bombay and Singapore. 32. The question of the proposed appointment of Hejaz-Nejd consuls at Bombay and Singapore (December report, section 10 (&amp;)) was discussed between Sir A/Ryan and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 6th February, after it had been decided that the Singapore appointment might be agreed to m principle sub ] ec t to safeguards roughly similar to those suggested for Bombay. Sir A. Ryan had been authorised to handle the matter on the lines suggested m his telegram ot the 29th December. He obtained from the sheikh an admission that such appointments must be the subject of international agreement. He emphasised the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to agree to the appointments in principle, but pointed out the necessity for safeguards for pilgrims and asked for an assurance that, if the two consuls were appointed Ibn Saud would be prepared to receive British consuls in his dominions^ Both points wexe clearly unpalatable to the sheikh, who promised to submit the matter to the King, but did not return to the subject up to the end of February.Money Order Agreement with India. 33. The Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department intimated to the Hejazi Director-General of Posts, &amp;c., by a letter of the 31st December, their readiness to waive the proposed claim in the Money Order Agreement regarding interest on outstanding balances. Up to the end of February, however, the agreement was still unconcluded owing to difficulties of pure form. Hejaz Railway. 34. On the 6th February Sheikh Yusuf Yasin expressed a wish to discuss on some future occasion the question of the Hejaz Railway, which had been in abeyance for a considerable time. He did not return to the subject up to the end of the month. His Majesty’s Government are not anxious to pursue this subject unless it is forced upon them and I bn Saud s personal attitude is obscure, as it is not certain how far he really wishes to raise the question or merely allows it to be played with for the edification of Moslems. Ihn Sand's Buying Proposals. 35. The King’s request that His Majesty's Government should act as his intermediary for purchases in Great Britain (July—August report, section 4 (c)) was carefully considered during and after Sir A. Ryan s visit to England on leave. The conclusions reached were embodied in a Foreign Office despatch of the 15th January prescribing the reply to be returned. Ibn Saud was to be informed that His Majesty’s Government could not act as buyers on his behalf, but they expressed willingness to give advice in connexion with particular transactions of importance, as they had done in the case of the Marconi wireless contract (September-November report, section 5). Sir A. Ryan was to urge upon the King the desirability of doing business through established houses. He was given discretion to point out the advantages presented in this respect by Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., an old-established firm with wide connexions, and to impress on the King the importance of following sound methods as regards punctual payment, &amp;c., if his Government wished to do business with British firms on favourable terms. Owing to pressure of other affairs, these instructions had not been carried out up to the 28th February. J France. 36. The negotiations for a treaty between France and Hejaz-Nejd were resumed when the Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs returned to life at the end of January. Progress appears to have been made, but both sides have been reticent. It is partly clear that France will not insist on the slavery article (December report, section 11). The French consulate hoped to find some way round the difficulty over the Algerians at Medina, which is apparently not disposed of by the new Law on Nationality (paragraph 56). ■ Italy. 37. The negotiations for a treaty between Italy and Hejaz-Nejd were also resumed early in the year. Italy also apparently intends to abandon the slavery article. The Italian consul spoke to Sir A. Ryan vaguely of obtaining some substitute for it in the form of a declaration by Ibn Saud, but gave no indication of what exactly he had in view, if anything. Otherwise there has been much reticence about these, as about the French negotiations. Germany. 38. The German Government apparently decided some little time ago to make Herr de Haas (September-November report, section 18 (6)) consul at Jedda, but he had not up to the time of writing made any communication to his future foreign colleagues. He is without official experience, and may be having [88 ff— 1 ] Ddifficulties in getting his position clear with the Hejazi Government. There are two versions : one that he wished to present credentials of some sort to the King; the other that he has applied for and is awaiting an exequatur. Meanwhile, he appears to be a somewhat enterprising business man, and has been first favourite in the competition for the Government benzine contract, formerly held by Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. on behalf of Shell, but not renewed for 1931. ^ Egypt. General. 39. The Egyptian consul is understood to have continued his conversations with a view to a settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Egypt. A few days after his return to Jedda (December report, section 12), the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs denied in an interview given to a Cairo paper that the consul had been instructed to carry on negotiations, although it was admitted that M. Achmouni had brought back a letter from King Fuad to Ibn Saud in reply to one from the latter. Aida Incident. 40. A small incident which might have complicated relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Egypt occurred on the 7tli-8th February. Admiral Tomlin, head of the Egyptian Ports and Lights Administration, had projected a visit to Jedda in the course of a cruise of inspection in the administration’s vessel “ Aida.” He had informed the Egyptian Government, and, supposing them to have made the necessary arrangements, arrived in Jedda on the 7th February. The Egyptian Government had, in fact, done nothing, although a belated telegram reached the Egyptian consul more or less simultaneously with the “Aida’s” arrival. The Hejazi Government took great offence. On the 8th February they addressed oral enquiries to Sir A. Ryan, who, though he had actually heard of the impending visit from Suez on the 6th February, naturally disclaimed any concern in the matter. Later in the morning the Egyptian consul called at the Legation in a state of great agitation, as he had arranged for Admiral Tomlin to call on the Acting Governor of Jedda, and had learnt that the latter had been instructed not to return the call. As the matter threatened to be disagreeable and to involve a British officer in the Egyptian service, His Majesty’s Minister offered to use his good offices as a friend of both parties, and was able to put the matter in such a way that the Hejazi Government relented. Not only was the admiral’s call properly returned, but presents of sheep, &amp;c., were sent on board the “ Aida.” The impression left by the incident was that, although Ibn Saud had mounted his high horse, not without reason, he was pleased enough to ride out of the affair on a friendly British intervention. Other Powers. 41. There is nothing of importance to record. The Persian Legation remained closed during the two months (December report, section 14). The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires was absent from Jedda on a tour in the Sudan for two or three weeks, and left again on the 25th February to visit Aden, Kamaran, the Yemen, and, if possible, Hadramaut, between which country and Java there is said to be much intercourse. IV.—Am Matters. Hejaz Air Force. 42 The deplorable situation in this force (December report, section 15) became more deplorable in January, The four remaining mechanics resigned about the end of December and left on the 11th February, the other two having already gone This reduced the force to three pilots, one of whom, Mr. Lowe, was not on speaking terms with his colleagues, engaged apparently in intrigues with certain local officers and boycotted the Legation. Sir A. Ryan doubted whether he could usefully intervene, but His Majesty’s Government still hoped■1 13 at the end of January that the elimination of Mr. Lowe would do good. On the 2nd February, acting under instructions, he discussed the situation witn Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and strongly advised the discharge of Mr. Lowe. The ins and outs of the matter are too complicated to be stated briefly. Ihe position at the end of February was that the other two pilots had threatened some time beiore *to resign, if Mr. Lowe were not dismissed, but all three were still employed. 43. Late in January His Majesty’s Government furnished material ^ or a reply to the Hejazi Government’s request for assistance in connexion^ with the spare parts for the aeroplanes (September—November report, section 21). The reply regarding instructional machines and machine-guns reached the Legation on the 25th February, but action on the despatch was delayed by the Transjordan frontier crisis. 44. In February the Legation succeeded after long efforts m recovering from the Hejazi Government a balance of £14 7.9. due in respect of travelling expenses back to Iraq of the pilot lent by the Royal Air Force when the Hejaz Air Force was transferred to Jedda. This trifle is placed on record, as it was the one solid diplomatic triumph achieved during the period under review. The gilt was taken off the Minister’s gingerbread when the Command Accountant in Iraq asked him to recover £30 more, which had been advanced to the officer before he started and which he had apparently overlooked. Sir A. Ryan, having, as he thought, disposed of the matter financially on the bases of the earlier claim, suggested that, if a further claim were to be made, it should be submitted to the Air Ministry to be dealt with in consultation with the Foreign Office. Arabian Air Route. 45. The question was raised in February whether a renewed effort should be made this year to obtain Ibn Saud’s consent to British aircraft flying over the Hasa coast (see report for July-August, section 24). The Legation was informed towards the end of February that the project of pearling flights between Bahrein and Iraq had been dropped. His Majesty’s Government were, however, anxious to secure general facilities for the use of the El Hasa route by British aircraft, whether military or civil. His Majesty’s Minister was given discretion as to how much should be asked for in the first instance, and as to how and when the matter should be broached. The objective was, not to request general permission to fly over Nejd territory, but to ensure that any aircraft compelled to enter or alight therein, should receive general assistance and good treatment; that no objection should be raised to the despatch of assistance by air, if necessary; and that the pilots should have knowledge of the position of landing grounds between Koweit and Bahrein, of which there should preferably be three, to be spaced at intervals of about 60 miles and to be chosen, if possible, in consultation with the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq. These instructions were issued on the 26th February. V.—Military Matters. General. 46. There is nothing definite to record about military movements. Reference has been made in paragraph 29 to alleged despatches of forces to Asir. The King would appear to have brought back a good many Nejdi fighting men on his return from Riadh to Mecca. ' Their prowess as dancers has been described in paragraph 9. 'New Regular Army. 47. The organisation of a regular army in the Hejaz, though very embryonic, has made some progress. The Director of Militarv Organisation mentioned in section 26 of the September-November report gave place shortly after his appoint ment to another Syrian ex-Turkish officer, German-trained, named Faudhi- al-Kawokji. This officer fought against the French during the Syrian revolt and came to the Hejaz as a refugee. The results of his efforts to create a regular army were seen at a review in Jedda on the King’s Accession Day. The march past consisted of two detachments of infantry, about 500 men in all, reasonably [88 ff — 1 ] 2m —'« workmanlike and disciplined; pack animals with various equipment and about 100 men in charge; two armoured cars; a disorderly rout of less than forty horsemen posing as “ cavalry ” ; and a much more impressive camel corps of from 300 to 400 men. Although the army is being organised in the Hejaz, most of the men in it appear to be Nejdis. The Bedouin review on the 27th February (paragraph 9) began with a small turn out of regular infantrymen. ^ These, atte^ performing their European evolutions, sought and obtained the King s permission to take part in the war-dance. Faudhi Bey seems to be a man of intelligence and initiative. He told Sir A. Ryan in February that he intended to start «t school for n.c.o's. This is probably sensible, as trained ex-Turkish officeis aie available for present requirements in the higher ranks. It appeared from Faudhi Bey’s conversation that the King’s ultimate ideal is to have a regular army for the whole of his dominions. VI.— Naval Matters. British. 48 The Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, arrived in Jedda on the 13th February in H M.S. “ Lupin ” and stayed three dlays. The opportunity was taken of discussing with Captain Dicken various matters of naval interest including the following :— (a) Restrictions, if any, to be placed on searches for arms in Hejazi territorial waters and in dhows of Hejazi nationality outside them (July-August report, section 34). (h) Possibility of more frequent visits to Jedda and of reviving the practice of visiting other ports. (c) Naval salutes for Hejazi dignitaries. A practically complete measure of personal agreement was reached on these subjects, but, as final decisions have still to be taken at home, any further account of them is deferred owing to consid'erations of space. French. 49 The French sloop “Baccarat” visited Jedda from the 6th to 10th January. The officers were much in evidence during the festivities m honour of the King’s accession. ^ , 50. Rear-Admiral Deville, Commander-in-chief of the French naval division in the Levant, arrived at Jedda from Port Sudan in the naval yacht “ Diana ” on the 18th February and left for Suez on the 20th February This was the last stage of a lengthy Journey by land and sea across Syria and I ra 9 and round from the Persian Gulf. The admiral was good enough to call privately af the British Legation, and expressed much appreciation of the courtosy he had received throughout his journey from British authorities. The “ Diana ” accorded a salute of thirteen guns to the Acting Governor of Jedda, to whom it had been decided that H.M.S. “ Lupin ” should not give a salute in view of his subordinate position and the unsettled state of the general question. VII.— Pilgrimage. Forged Rupee Notes. 51 See December report, section 19. No definite news reached Jedda in January or February regarding the progress made by the French authorities in Syria It was suggested towards the end of February that it might be well tor the member of the Legation Staff who dealt with the matter last year to address a final letter to the broker in Syria, in order to disarm the suspicion that might result from complete silence. This suggestion was referred to His Majesty s consul-general at Beirut for his views on the 9th March. Movement of Pilgrims. 52 A much reduced pilgrimage was still anticipated at the end of February, although the prospect as regards numbers was perhaps a little better than in December. The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 13th March put the total of arrivals upf ■ 15 4 to date at 20,337. The total number of Dutch East Indian pilgrims, including the last arrivals in March, is about 15,000, not including children, or rather less than half the figure for last year. Pilgrim ships from India brought 1,679 pilgrims up to the 28th February. On this same date 397 had arrived from Malaya. It is difficult to estimate the probable number of Egyptians, who are for bvious reasons late starters. The Khedivial Mail Steamship Company would Jppear to have lost the contract for transporting them, but the information in Jedda on this subject is meagre. It is stated that the pilgrimage from Algeria has been prohibited for sanitary reasons, a decision which, if confirmed, will seriously affect the movement from French North Africa as a w’hole. Control of Nigerian Pilgrims. 53! Arrangements were made more or less informally in February for the Commissioner at Port Sudan to visit Jedda in order to discuss this question further, with a view to the elaboration of a scheme which might in due course be proposed to the Nigerian Government as an effort to secure theii main desiderata without overtaxing the means at the disposal of the Sudan Government and the Legation in Jedda (December report, section 21). VIII.— Slavery. 54. The number of slaves manumitted by the Legation in January and February was three, all of whom were male. One other man, an Abyssinian, refuge, but relinquished his desire for freedom. There is reason to suppose that the local authorities have taken measures to make it more difficult for slaves to obtain access to the Legation, e.g., by prohibiting the movement of negroes in the interior without permits. Information of this kind is difficult to control. A concrete instance of obstruction of another kind occurred on the 17th January when the Acting Governor of Jedda, acting under instructions i rom ^ ecc 1 ^’ showed hesitation in giving the necessary paper to enable a f ^ed slave to be embarked for Massowah next day. The notice given was admittedly short, but, m order to discourage the tendency to obstruct, the Legation telegraphed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Mecca, with the result that orders were given in time for the man to be embarked according to plan; but only after the Legation had, by considerable use of the telephone, tracked the progress of its own telegram through all stages. IX.— Miscellaneous. Reuter Service. 55. No progress appears to have been made. Law on Nationality. 56 The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 13th February published the text of a regulation amending the Regulation on Hejazi Nationality promulgated in 1926. In view of the importance of these enactments an attempt has been made in the appendix to this report to produce a consolidated English text giving their combined effect. The law of 1926 was much criticised by foreign Powers, and in 1927 His Majesty’s Government sought to establish certain principles which they hoped might be embodied in an exchange of notes. Negotiations in 1928 led to no result, and, as the law was not in practice giving rise to much difficulty, the matter was allowed to stand over until the summer of 1930, when it was thought desirable to reopen it in order to facilitate the settlement of certain particular questions affected by it. Little progress was then made beyond ascertaining that the Hejaz Government were disposed to satisfy His Majesty s Government on certain points but, through jealousy of their sovereign rights, wished to proceed by way of legislation of their own. On the other hand the Legation found it necessary to seek further guidance from His Majesty’s Govern ment on various matters, a final decisioU on which was not taken until the 6th February, when instructions were sent to Sir A. Ryan. . . . . 57. Before those instructions reached Jedda, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had intimated that the Hejaz Government were anxious to get on with the new law1(5 and expressed a wish to discuss the matter unofficially. This led to a conversation on the 4th February, to which Sir A. Ryan consented rather than run the risk of seeing an unsatisfactory new law promulgated without previous discussion. It appeared from SHeikh Yusuf Yasin’s explanations that the Hejazi Government proposed to meet the views of His Majesty’s Government on two important points viz., the wording of article 3, which orginally asserted the Hejazi nationality o^ all persons born in the Hejaz, without right of subsequent option; and the wording of article 10, which, in its original form, provided that any foreigner “ residing ” in the Hejaz who was not in possession of documents proving his nationality would be deemed a Hejazi as from the date of the law. The amending regulation promulgated shortly after the above conversation provides more satisfactory texts of those two articles; although His Majesty’s Government would have preferred article 3 to be given such a form that Hejazi nationality acquired by birtn did not take effect until the child had attained his majority, subject then to a right of option; and the new wording of article 10 is not so precise as could be wished. The Hejazi Government could not see their way to accept a suggestion of His Majesty’s Government that the words “who have in the past’’ should be omitted from article 6 or that in practice the clause containing them should not be applied retrospectively. 58. From a practical point of view the amended law seems unlikely, if it is faithfully applied, to impose any hardship on British subjects and protected persons. In his conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 4th February, Sir A. Ryan intimated that he would not consider the acquisition of Hejazi nationality by a child born in the Hejaz of British parents as necessarily precluding the Legation from intervening in certain circumstances on behalf of the child and its parents. He had in mind such a case as that of the technically Hejazi minor daughter of a British subject being abducted, in which case it should be possible to intervene at the instance of the injured father. 59. It is important to note that the law has now been expressly extended to the whole of Ibn Saud’s dominions, though without any express mention of Asir. Beacons at Yanbo. 60. Two beacons were swept away by storms in December and January thus increasing the danger of approaching this always difficult port. As it is principally frequented by Khedivial steamers the Legation strongly urged that the beacons should be restored without delay. This work had not been completed by the 28th February, but the prospect of its being done was good, helped perhaps by a personal conversation which Mr. Hope-Gill had with the Emir of Yanbo on his voyage to Suez at the end of January. The Khedivial Company themselves propounded a scheme for supplying a complete outfit of five or six beacons at a little over £100 each, but the Hejazi authorities found this beyond their means and preferred to undertake the essential work themselves. Approach to Jedda. 61. Sir A. Ryan had some general conversation with the Emir Feisal, during the latter’s formal visit on the 1st February, about the desirability of port improvements. The Emir assured him that the whole subject was receiving earnest consideration. Inshallah! Indian Visitors. 62. Three members of the Round Table Conference announced their intention of paying short visits to the Hejaz on their return. Two of them, including Sir Akbar Hydari, abandoned the visits. The third, Nawab Mar Jang, Foreign Minister of the Nizam of Hyderabad, arrived with his family on the 10th February and left on the 15th February after visiting Mecca and Medina. The Legation had asked for ordinary facilities. The result was that Ibn Saud took complete possession of the Nawab and himself made all arrangements as for a Royal guest.Yacht “Sister Anne.” 63. The yacht “ Sister Anne,” having on board the owner, the Hon. Mrs. R. Fellowes (a French lady, nee Decazes), and two other ladies, visited Jedda in February. She called at Yanbo on her way north, with the assent of the Hejazi ^rovernment, intending merely to lie off for the night. In the event the ladies Tlere very hospitably welcomed on shore by the local authorities. Legation Staff. 64. Mr. Wikeley returned from sick leave on the 20th January after undergoing an operation for appendicitis in Egypt. Mr. Hope-Gill went on long leave on the 30th January. Book on Stamps. 65. Captain C. C. Lewis of the Legation Staff projects a book on Hejaz-Nejd stamps since 1926. His Majesty’s Minister has asked unofficially on his behalf for facilities and permission to dedicate the book to Ibn Saud. Sheikh Yusuf’s reaction in February was favourable. Meteorological. 66. After the middle of January the climate was unusually clement until the end of February, not much hotter than in a really warm English summer, minus the rain, of which there was very little. Owing to Mr. Hope-Gill’s absence it is proposed to reserve the meteorological record until the May-June report and then, if possible, to give the figures for the first six months of 1931. Appendix. Nationality Law. Consolidated text showing the effect of the Amending Regulation of February 1931 on the original Regulation on Hejazi Nationality promulgated on Rabi-al-Awwal, 1345 (the 29th September, 1926). Amendments in the original text are shown by underlining^ 1 ) Relevant provisions in the Amending Regulation which cannot be so shown are noted in brackets. Several articles, the text of which is not expressly changed, are nevertheless affected by the extension of the Regulation to Nejd as well as the Hejaz. Regulation of Hejaz-A^'^ Nationality. (Article 1 of the Amending Regulation provides that the regulation, the title of which is thus altered, shall apply to subjects of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its dependencies. Article 4 provides that “All dealings and acts done in accordance with the original regulation since its promulgation up to the promulgation of this amendment shall be deemed lawful, effective and unchangeable.”) Article 1. Persons of Hejaz origin or residence, who were Ottoman subjects before the Great War, are considered Hejazis. Art. 2. Persons born of Hejazi parents, or whose father is a Hejazi, are Hejazis. Art. 3 (modified throughout).— Every person born in the territories of the Hejaz or Nejd will be deemed a Hejazi or Nejdi national, subject to the provision that persons born in those territories of foreign parents shall have the right to opt for the original nationality of their parents during one year after they reach the age of 18, and if they fail to notify the Hejaz-Nejd authorities of their choice during that fixed period they shall lose their right to opt. p) Printed in italics.Art. 4. Any Moslem who is not a minor and has resided in the Hejaz for three consecutive years is entitled to adopt Hejaz nationality after application to the authorities either directly or indirectly. Art. 5. Hejaz nationality may be granted by a special Royal irada to any Moslem, when such appears to the advantage of the Hejaz. Art. 6. A Hejazi cannot adopt foreign nationality, either in the Hejaz abroad, without proper authorisation from the Hejaz Government, which can only be by Royal irada. (Article 6 of the Amending Regulation adds the further provision that “ Hejazi or Nejdi nationals who renounce their nationality and become naturalised as nationals of a foreign State without permission of the Hejaz-Nejd Government will not be allowed to reside in or return to the Hejaz or Nejd.') Art. 7. Hejazis who accept military service under a foreign Government without previous authority from the Hejaz Government may lose their Hejaz nationality. Such persons may also be prohibited from returning to or residing in the Hejaz. Art. 8. A woman of alien nationality who marries a Hejazi becomes a Hejazi, and will not lose her Hejaz nationality on termination of the marriage, unless she reside abroad and readopt her former nationality. A Hejazi woman who marries an alien reassumes her Hejaz nationality on termination of the marriage. Art. 9. When a Hejazi adopts a foreign nationality, his young (minor?) children do not assume that nationality while they are resident in the Hejaz. If their residence is in a 'place other than the territories of the Hejaz or Nejd and the nationality regulation of the country in which their father has been naturalised does wot entitle them to adopt that nationality, they will remain Hejazis or Nejdis, but if such regulation of the country in which their father has been naturalised entitles them to adopt that nationality, they will have the right to revert to Hejazi or Nejdi nationality when they reach the age of 18 if they choose to do so. Art. 10 (modified throughout).— Every person who ivas resident in the territories of the Hejaz or Nejd at the date of the promulgation of the Regulation on Nationality of Rabi-al-Awwal 1345 shall be deemed Hejazi or Nejdi unless his foreign nationality is proved by official documents. Art. 11. This regulation is to be considered effective as from the date ol promulgation. Our Viceroy is charged with the application of this law. (Article 9 of the Amending Regulation empowers the Viceroy to issue instructions relative to the application of the provisions of both regulations. Article 10 brings the Amending Regulation into force from the date of promulgation.)</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000263_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2073</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000263</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2073</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 6/9 'Jeddah Reports Jany 1931–'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1938</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-04-21T11:32:32</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (399 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 400; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
