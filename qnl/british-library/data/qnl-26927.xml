The most suitable Muslim Officer, in cry opinion at this Custom House for deputation to Musfcat, is Mohd. Ismail, an Appraiser, full particulars about whom are attached for the Board’s infonnation. Apart from Ms excellent academic career, his work in the Appraising department is definitely good and he himself is energetic, sound and thoraugMy reliable. I believe that,it? if xpcix appointed, he would acquit himself creditay. He is 30, but that is not a serious disqualification. I can thoroughly recommend Ismail. 3. Taking into account the unattractiveness of living at a place like Muscat*' where it must be hot and unhealthy in more senses than one, I would suggest the following scale for Ismail:- Hs* 450-jp -600, plus free quarters, leave and passage concessions. It is presumed Ismail would, if 3pc appointed, retain a lien on his present job. Yours sincer/Jely, To BO/- S.M.Gupta, 13-1-1939.

It is satisfactory that the Sultan has turned to us for assistance in this way and it is most important that the Officer in question should be carefully selected. The terms offered by the Sultan seem to me adequate. I have no doubt that His Highness in ’tuipnxng to us for assistance has been influenced by the excellent work done by Mr. Bower of the Imperial Customs Service in re-organis ing the Muscat Customs administration some years ago. attested. ad.

The ^altan is prepared to give up to is 400 • 600 per mensem with free quarters and whatever leave and passage concessions the Government of India may consider suitable for the particular case. The Officer should be a kohammaden and about forty years of age and be thoroughly conversent with the administrative side of Customs work. Period of servxce in first contract 2-3 years. 4. In view of the early approach of tne date when the new Treaty is due to come into force i.e. 11th February 1939* the Sultan says that he would be graceful i^/he//Q0Uld be informed as early as possible whether a suitable officer could be made available for service in the State. {Designation) R.P.
