Sir:- ^ ■ / ;' Foreign Office DecemlDer 6th. 1906. I am directed hy Secretary Sir Edward Grey to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that he has had under his consid- ^ eration your letters of the 27th. of June last and 13th. \jrf -* ' / ultimo on the subject of the appointment of Military Officers as Attaches to the German Consulate-General Apart from other obvious considerations, this prac- at Calcutta. ^ - r * u SaYLtf* ^ tice appears to Sir Edward Grey to be open to objection Juk* ( /V*'it) 1j SvJ* ■ l^oL not only on the ground that it invests a Consular post. which is primarily created for purposes of trade, with a quasi diplomatic status, but also on the ground that, were other foreign countries to adopt the same system, it is obvious that serious inconveniences might result. I am accordingly to enclose a copy of a semi official communication which, by Sir Edward Grey's di rection, I have addressed to the German Ambassador at this The Under Secretary of State, India Office.I ^ this Court upon the subject, and which it is hoped may result in a discontinuance of the practice. The appointment of Commercial Agents, Physicians and others to the staff of the German Consulate-General at Calcutta does not appear to Sir Edward Grey to be open to the same objection, or to call for any remark. I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,FOREIGN OFFICE, December 6th, 1906, I There is a little matter in regard to which His Majesty^s Government are reluctant to address any formal representation to the German Government, at any rate at the present juncture, hut which the Secretary of State desires me to bring to Your Excellency* s not ice semi-officially. It has already been broached .^ in a conversation I had with Herr von Stumm last Sum mer. On several occasions during the past few years, and on the 10th September last, the Imperial ConsulConsul General at Calcutta has notified to the Gov ernment of India the appointments of various officers of the German army to he 'Attaches' to the Consulate General, and such notifications have naturally, as a matter of courtesy, been duly acknowledged by the foreign department of that Government. From our point of view, however, these appoint ments - which it is understood are made under the Sign Manual of His Majesty the German Bnperor - are hardly in keeping with the generally recognized attri butes of a Consular post and tend to invest it with a quasi Diplomatic Status to which it is not, in strictness entitled.We have no complaint whatever to urge against the conduct of any of the officers who have been at tached to the Consulate General. On the contrary they have - from a purely social point of view - been most acceptable members of society both at Calcutta and Simla. The question is solely one of principle to which His Majesty^ Government attach no little im portance, as if the practice were generally adopted by other States, serious inconveniences might result. On these grounds Sir Edward Grey desires me to express the hope that the Imperial Government will be disposed, henceforward, to discontinue the system of appointing Military Officers as Attaches to their Consulate' ^ 1 Simla, tlie lOtli September 190G.

His establishment is becoming that of an Embassy on a large scale! a Military Attache and others quite inconsistent with what one has been taught to look upon as the Con sular Service, and one does not know how to recog- ni se these Off icers . Count Quadt himself is a stiff-looking Prussian official, but has been \ very sensible in accepting his position here sim ply as entitling him to Consular precedence and nothing more. Countess Quadt is a charming little lady whom everyone likes, and takes precedence according to her own rank in the Almanac de Gotha, which is very high. She has, however, several times been at great pains to explain to me ti.at her husband is a diplomatist m the German Diplo matic Service , and not in the Consular Service, but at the same time we are, according to all recog' nised rules, bound to give him only his Cons ular precedence, and not to recognise his diplomatic position. She admits this, but still the position is not very well defined.
