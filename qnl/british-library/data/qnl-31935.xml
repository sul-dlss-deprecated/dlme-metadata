KUWAIT OIL COMPANY, LIMITED. Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C.2. 28th November, 1934. Lear Laithwaite, With reference to our telephone conversation yesterday afternoon, I enclose 6 copies of 'Alternative Article 3' of the Kuwait Concession. This article was drafted in anticipation of the possibility of the Shaikh insisting upon royalty on a 'won and saved' basis. The negotiators, however, were not empowered to produce it in negotiation without reference to London. This accounts for the omission of alternative Article 3 from the copies of Draft 5 which were sent to the India Office on 26th September. I ought to have furnished you with copies of the article as soon as the negotiators were authorised to use it, but I forgot to do so - an emission for which I apologise. With regard to the telegram from the Political Resident to the India Office which you mentioned, I imagine that the 'Draft ’A’' to which the Political Resident refers is to be explained as follows: On 6th November, the Shaikh wrote to the negotiators giving the Company the choice of two alternatives - 'A' (won and saved) and 'B' (exports and sales). The financial terms in 'B' were considerably higher than those in 'A'. The negotiators expressed their belief that the Shaikh would/2. would accept alternative Article 3 with financial terms as in his 'A', and we cabled them on Uovember 17th that if they could work such an arrangement out it would be acceptable to us. The Shaikh T s financial terms under alternative ’’A” are those of which you were informed at our meeting on 24th October with the exception of royalty and taxation exemption which now figure at Rupees 3 and Annas 4 respectively. (Mr.Stevens has already informed you orally of these terms). Our latest word from the negotiators is a cable received yesterday advising us that they have discussed alternative Article 3 with the Shaikh on 22nd November. The Shaikh undertook to examine the article carefully and to inform them within a few days of his decision and also to give them details of certain unimportant alterations which he required in the text of Draft No.5. Up to the time of telegraphing, the negotiators had heard nothing further from the Shaikh. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) H.T.Kemp. .G.Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.l.Article 3. In consideration of the rights granted by the Shaikh to the Company by this Agreement and of the assistance and protection which the Shaikh hereby undertakes to afford by all means in his power to the Company and its operations employees and property the Company shall pay to the Shaikh the following sums:- (a) Within thirty (30) days after signature of this Agreement Rupees (b) On each anniversary of the date of signature until the Company declares that petroleum has been found in commercial quantities Either Royalty of Rupees for every English ton (2,240 lbs.) of nett crude petroleum won and saved by the Company in Kuwait during the year ending 3 months prior to the anniversary of the date of signature, Or Rupees , whichever shall be the greater sum. (c) On each anniversary of the date of signature after the Company has declared that petroleum has been found in commercial quantities:- Either Royalty as defined above, Or Rupees whichever shall be the greater sum. (d) For the purpose of this Agreement and to define the exact quantity to which the Royalty stated above refers, it is agreed that the Royalty is payable on each English ton of 2,240 lbs. of nett crude petroleum v;on and saved by the Company from within the State of Kuwait, after deducting: (i) water, sand or other foreign substances contained in or mixed with the petroleum; (ii) petroleum required for use by the Company in its installations and operations in the State of Kuwait; (iii) petroleum lost in any process of treatment refining or handling of petroleum that may be carried on within the State of Kuwait; (i*) petroleum which may be returned to the underground natural reservoirs through the Company*s borings.L Cunard House z,.7298/34 Leadenhall St., London,E.C.3. plh/sgl S8th November, 1934 THe Secretary of State for India India Office, Whitehall, S. 1U 1.

The Shaikh has the right to select in the first instance the Chief Local Representative in consultation with His Majesty’s Government'. ith reference to the second paragraph of the Shaikh’s enclosed letter, the gist of his new sub-clause 9 (B) is that he reserves the right to permit companies operating oil fields in neighbouring territories to trans port oil through Kuwait.

(c) On 1st September and as Kuwait Oil Company had done absolutely nothing to meet his demands he allowed Gabriel show him for first time draft Concession offered by Traders Ltd. He did not tell Watts as he feared to talk in presence of interpreter. (d) On 2nd September he gave Gabriel letter in which expressed approval and readiness to sign under certain conditions. (e) As Traders Ltd., made no further move he informed Gabriel on 12th December that he was about to come to terms with Kuwait Oil Company, who now offered agree all his final demands.2 (f) On 15th December he telegraphed Gabriel that he had arrived at agreement with Kuwait Oil Company and further conversations must cease. 2.

After full discussion with Company we are however of opinion as reference this point in commercial agreement is subject to over-ride provisions of Political Agreement (? mutilation) arrl is of concern primarily to Company we need not press objection to revised wording and have so informed them. The position His Majesty’s Government is in our view fully safeguarded by Article IV of Political Agreement, and our right of veto of any 'Selection” (he has abandoned his claim to 'appoint') which Shaikh may put forward is entirely unimpaired. Equally under clause 4 of Political Agreement^ Chief Local Representative would have to be found from amongst principal employes of Company, and will ordinarily reside in Kuwait. 2. Company inform us that implication of (?words) 'in the first instance' is understood to be 'on first occasion' .• 3. I udderstand Company now propose authorise negotiators to accept all 'final points'. They have been warned that signature by Shaikh does not necessarily involve approval of His Majesty’s Government, because we have now received official application from competitors which may need consideration, and about which mo statement can be made at present. They have undertaken to treat this information as strictly confidential, although I have some reason to think that they have independent confirmation of it.4. As intervention of Traders Limited creates a situation which may require consideration it cannot now be assumed either by Kuwait Oil Company or by Shaikh that approval of His Majesty's Government will necessarily follow when once they have agreed between themselves on terms of a concession, even though such agreement is signed. It is of course unnecessary for DICKSON to mention hypothetical contingency to Shaikh but it seems possible that latter might assume from previous history of nego tiations that he has already the approval of His Majesty's Government to grant concession to Kuwait Oil Company. True position is of course that grant of any concession is subject to expressed approval of His Majesty’s Government. DICKSON should therefore insure that Shaikh clearly understands that His signature of any concession should be accompanied by a written proviso that it is subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. -Retaxandum.X If co t&lt; pi ' '• 1 tx,A _ Ilav o k / ipt Telegram I.F.0.1927 and 30.

I have discussed whole position with Dickson who agrees with the views given below. 2. Situation is (a) Shaikh is not only willing but anxious to sign Kuwait Oil Company Agreement (vide my telegram 1241 16th December) terms of which have been approved of by His Majesty's Government (b) Shaikh quite appreciates that before doing so, he must obtain approval of His Majesty's Government. (c) Brocedure suggested in paragraph 4 of your telegram quoted above is I understand that Shaikh should sign Kuwait Oil Company Agreement subject to written proviso that it is subject to approval of His Majesty's Government, to give time to latter to examine position of Traders Limited. This procedure seems unnecessary to me. His Majesty’s Government are in no way com.-dtted to Traders, who as lar as His Majesty's Government are concerned, offer no advantages over Kuwait Oil Company, and who having- come into the field very late in day have no right to hold up Kuwait Oil Company's Agreement, as therefore Shaikh is willing to sign Kuwait Oil Company's /- 2 - Company's Agreement he should in my opinion be allowed to do so. (d) In these circumstances thereiore could not His Majesty^ Government telegraph their approval to signature by Shaikh of Kuwait Oil Company^ Agree ment? (e) If His I'aje^ty*8 Government agree to this suggestion then Shaikhs dealings with Traders lose their importance| and I will forward Shaikh's written explanation with my comments by post.

Traders Co. Ltd. and with what the said company had stated, namely that I haVd granted to them an oil concession covering the whole of the Kuwait territory, subject to the formal and official approval of TT is Majesty’s Government to the grant of such a concession. That also the said company had enclosed in their letter three appendices, namely: (a) a list of the companies and gentlemen associated with their application: (b) A copy of the 'terms ’ 1 agreed upon between me and the said company. (c) An English translation of a letter emanating from me, granting an oil concession to the said Company, v/hich was forwarded through Mr.Gabriel, Advocate of Basra. And that finally His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India had directed you to ascertain from me whether I confirmed or otherwise, the aforesaid statement. I accordingly beg to lay before you the real facts: During negotiations with Messrs: Holmes and Chisholm and at one of our first meetings, Mr.Gabriel, the Lawyer, was in Kuwait. He informed me then that there was a British firm, which desired to take the Kuwait Oil concession and on terms which would satisfy me. I told then him (Mr.GabrieljZ’th&amp;'fc negotiations were in progress withprogress with Messrs: Holmes and Chisholm, and that they had asked my leave to depart in order to consulting with their com any on certain points, (in London) and that a decision had been arrived at between them and myself (to postpone negotiations) till the end of August 1934, during which period I was not at liberty to open negotiations with anyvody else. That when that period expired, if the Compaq he (Mr. Gabriel) represented was a purely British concern, he could communicate with them, but on the one condition that they should apply, through their local representative (in ISn^land) to His Majesty’s Government for the issue of an order to me, as without such an order I could not see my way to grant any concession. After Messrs: Holmes and Chisholm had left(for England) and after the time limit which I promised had expired, namely on 30th August 1934, the said Mr.Gabriel brought me two copies of the terms of the concession (of Traders Ltd.) I examined these terms and found them suitable. I next wrote on the Bnd Leptember to Mr.Gabriel a copy of which, giving exact wording I forwarded to you under my letter No.4/1862 , dated the 8 th inst. (15.12.34). 7as there, I ask, anything in the wording of that letter from me to justify the CompanyN in assuming (as they have done) that I had actually granted them the concession?

I, i- I beg to say that God willing (Insha’Allah) X will never go against an order of His Majesty’s Government and that I do and shall always -de' obey the behests of His Majesty’s Government, in every respect. The nature of the negotiations that had taken place, were as outlined in my letter to you, No.R-4/1863, dated the 8 th inst (15.12.34). Indeed at the time I wished to inform Major atts of these negotiations,but they were of a very secret nature end as he did not know Arabic, and discussions with him had to be carried on by means of an interpreter, I kept the knowledge of them to myself, for fear of being very 'busy betrayed. On your return (from ’.ngland) we both were kept/ for sometime, with date-garden questions, but soon after wards I informed you verbally and very confidentially of everything.! trust you informed His Majesty’s Government at the time what I told you. As regards my promise to Messrs: Holmes and Chisholm that it was for a period of three months with effect from the June 1934, as they presumed to be the case in their letter (which you showed me). I admitI admit that I gave a premise to the said gentlemen, but I carefully told them that the period would expire at the end of August 1934. It was I who disclosed to them that I had received a telegram fran a British firm in London, which desired to negotiate for a» concession. This also you heard from me. Further, I warned them that should they fail to settle the question with me within this period, (i.e. by 30th August 1934) I should be compelled to open negotiations with the abovementioned new Company. These are the real facts. I have never thought, nor would I think, of going against His Majesty’s Grovemment’s orders, because I am quite sure that His Majesty’s G-overnment have got no other intention of wish than the peace and welfare of ourselves and our country. T 7e are always most grateful to His Majesty’s Government. Usual Ending.COPY. tty C ONF ID '£NTI AL. THE AGENCY , No.C-353. KUWAIT. 20.12.34.

It will be seen from the Shaikh*s letter ho ^1/4/1863, dated the 16th December a 934, that His Excellency confirms generally the information communicated by Traders Limited to the Indin Office but denies that his letter of 2nd September 1934 to PT*Gabriel can be read as the grant of a concession to that Company, and from his letter No*R/4/1862, dated the 15th December 1934 that fcU^G&amp;briel's translation of the Shaikh*s letter to him dated the 2nd September 1934 is correct* U h'/ 3. The criticisms against the Shaikh are: (a) that in the face of the warning conveyed to him by Colonel Dickson on 23rd April 1934 he conducted negotiations with Traders Limited without consult ing Hie Laje8ty 9 s Government (b) that he broke his promise to the Kuwait Oil Company not /@&gt;ns0 - 2 - not to conduct negotiations with any other party for 3 months as from the 14th June 1934. 4. With regard to (b) above the Shaikh maintains that he made it clear to Messrs.Chisholm and Holmes that the period of three months expired at the end of nugust. In any case as the difference in time ie only a fortnight ana as tne matter Is one between the Shaikh and the Company 1 do not think that this point need be taken up with the Shaikh. 5. as regards (a) - vide his letter ko.H/4/18o4 of 16th December 1934 - 1 do not think that the Shaikh's explanation is a satisfactory one. In the first place he could have mentioned the fact of these negotiations, without going into details, to Major Watts who knows sufficient Arabic to under stand such a communication$ or to colonel boch, who can speak Arabic, when he was here at the end of September. Moreover he did not inform colonel jickson who had returned to Kuwait on the 16th October about these negotiations until the middle of November. In the second place when he did inform Colonel Dickson he did not divulge the name of the company and merely stated that he had been approached by the Company, not that he had intimated to them as far back as September 2nd thau, subject to their securing the approval of His Majesty's Govern meat, and their acceptance of certain conditions, he himself* approved the terms of the concession and was prepared to sign it. 6. I suggest therefore that 1 may be authorised to write to the Shaikh in the terms of the enclosed draft. 1 am sending copies of this letter to tne Government of /0 -3 of India and the Political Agent, Kuwait I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd.

In view of the clear intimation of their wishes communicated to ¥our Excellency by Colonel Dickson on 33rd April last to tne effect that Hie Majesty’s Government would expect Your Excellency to consult them before you even opened any negotiations with any Company, His Majesty's Government feel that Your excellency could have communicated tne mere fact of these negotiations either to Major Watts, whose knowledge of Arabic is sufficient to understand such a communication, or to the Acting political Resident, Colonel Loch (who speaks Arabic) when he was here from the 21st to the 29th September.

Mr. Stevens opened the discussion oy touching on on or two matters of minor importance. The words 'in the first instance' had now been retranslated to read 'on the first occasion' in the English version of Article of the Commercial Agreement, and the Sheikh had accepted a small amendment in Article 6 (c), namely the insertion of the word 'production' before 'records'. The Company had now telegraphed to jvo.jeit acc P the Sheikh-a terms in full and had received a reply that , . . a-jrv-n the concession as soon as the Sheikh desired to sign the , „ , v^rmire an assurance from the possible but that, he woul 0.

He not yet in a position to divulge the name oi the ther company. The position was that the India Office bad received the other application on 28th November and that according to the applicants a good deal of progress had been made towards obtaining a concession. The India Office on receiving the application had been distinctly puzzled since they had heard nothing about any other application since last April when no one had taien the matter very seriously. They had therefore decided that the first essential was to check up the position with the Sheikh and ascertain what foundation there was for the other applicants account of their position vi^ii the Sheikh. They had only that morning received a reply to their enouiries from Koweit. This reply confirmed that last September the Sheikh was in negotiation with another applicant and had to some extent committed himself to the ■hnt nothinr further had happened approval of a concession, hut no uni u - v v* -Thpn the other Company had made until the end of November v/hen me . . +V .

It was impossibl© i or any further step to he taken without reference to these higher authorities. j-.n »Laithwai oe explained, tnat the other Governirert Departments had not yet been consulted for tiie same reason as no c oriimun i c at ion had been made to the Company until the matter was raised by Mr.Stevens on 12th December Mr. Stevens said that the impression which he had received from past discussions had been that the Company would be at once informed if any other applicant applied for a concession, and speaking frankly he felt that the Company had been badly treated in this respect. Mr. Walt on explained that the other application had only been received on 28th November and that the India Office had felt bound to ask the Sheikh for confirmation of the position before informing the Company. The Resident had accordingly been instructed to go himself to Koweit to interview the Sheikh, but owing to illness in his family Colonel Fowls had been unable to do so. Colonel Dickson, the Political Agent, haa tnen been authorised to interview' the Sheikh, ana the relegi an reporting his interview' had only been received tnat morning. Before that the India Oifice had not known where they stood and had not felt justified in broaching the matter with the Company (until hr.Stevens himselx ashed, a question on 12th December) as we were still not in possession of relevant information. In consideri.ig their decision regarding the concession tne higher authorities concerned would be fully infoiued of 3 t history of the case and of the Sheikh's wishes m : matter; the other applicants appeared to be quite istantiol financially, but it was not ithor they had any previous technical experience m ■ 'working/wo r v inf oil concessions. Xn noply t o n one si ion xi'oin 'ir Stevens, Ivtr• Y/nlton said that at this stage political interest in the matter of the Koweit Oil concession was a factor which could not he ignored. The position based on the Sheikh* s treaty with H.Iv.G. and also on past practice and policy was that the Sheikh was not permitted to grant an oil concession without the approval of E.X.G. The British Government therefore had a certain responsibility to the public in the matter. So long as there was only one applicant for the concession the position was quite straightforward now that a second competitor had entered the field and submitted an official application before the Kuwait Oil Company had finally come to terms with the Sheikh, there was a possibility of criticism if H.U.G. failed to tune both applications into consideration, and on account of this risk our higher authorities might wish to matter further before arriving at a decision. , friticism referred to Mr.Stevens suggested tha . + . • r . nf the existence of an American would be criticism of tnc element in the Kuwait Oil Company. t . fl tv , t that no doubt might be one facto- Mr. Wait on said that tn &gt; ^ __ +. ^ -n hat the main point v&gt;as in any criticism, but reiterated oha - that we now had two applications. +hat he would agree witn t. - Mr. Stevens _ said tua it ion if there were m lac statement of the posit * e nt where , „ pse like the pi ©tent negotiators, but not i , reached an one of the negotiators had alrea t agreement with the Sheikh. possi bility of the Mr .Hearn refused to imagine ^ ^ ^ . concerned givin 0 Government authori i- ^ had Peen e o late in concession to other app submitting their appXi- 0 ^' r&lt;+oTTP.nSa &gt; ■V Mr• St6 vg n £3 said iiiaij hs would 06 pud to grout )ersonal inconvenience if he had to remain in London lor -ore than a fortnight.

K ( Gentlemen, / r I ars directed by the Secretary of State for India to rpdfer to your interview at the India Office on 17th/ December,in which you reported that agreement' had now been reached between youand His Excellency the Sheilch of Koweit on the subject of the terms of an oil concession in respect of Koweit and that His Excellency was prepared to sign the concession in your favour immediately, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. It was understood in the earlier discussions between your company and His Majesty's Government that no objection would be raised to the grant oi a concession by the Sheikh to your company, subject to certain specified conditions* These conditions have been luliilltd, &lt;*nd having regard to the understanding in question and so the fact that the Sheikh has now decided to grant the concession to your company, I am directed ^o inform cu that His Majesty’s Government have approved the MieiihJs decision and to say that it is assumed tnat wll ^~ow take the necessary steps to complete the signature ox your agreement with His Excellency. I are, Gentlemen, Your obedient Serv ant , Kuwait Oil Co.Ltd., Britannic House, Einsbury Circus, S.C.2.p.z. 7815/34 21st December 1934. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state that he has d under consideration your letter of 28th November, PLH/WGL* , on the question of the grant of an oil concession in Koweit to Messrs.Traders Limited. 2. On receipt of your letter of 28th November, which was the first intimation which he received from your Company that they were interested in the matter, the Secretary of State took ste]5s to ascertain from the Sheikh of Koweit i the position in regard to his relations with Traders ^ Limited. The Sheikh has now stated in reply to this enquiry that the letter of 2nd September to Mr.Gabriel, of which a copy was enclosed in your letter under reference, was not in any way intended to r epresent the grant ox a concession to your Company by him. He added that as he had heaid nothing further from your Company subsequently to the date of that letter he informed Mr. Gabriel on 12th December that he was about to come to terms with the Kuwait Oil Company and that on 15th December he t elegraphed to Mr. Gabriel that he had done so and that further conversations with your Company must cease. 3. I am to explain that His Majesty’s Government have for some considerable time been guided in regard to the question of the grant of oil concessions in Koweit, by certain definite principles which they felt bound to uaopt in view of the special circumstances of the case, ana which are well known to the Sheikh and to the various applicants who have from time to time approached His Majesty’s/ •Hunting Esq., /0 * Messrs.E.A. Gibson &amp; Co.Ltd., Leadenhall Street, E.C.2. Majesty’s Government in tht matter. The effect of these principles is that the responsibility for deciding as to the grant of an oil concession shall rest with His Excellency subject to the following conditions (a) that the Sheikh (and similarly any applicant for a concession) should consult with His Majesty’s Government beiore entering into negotiations for a concession and that His Majesty’s Government should be kept fully informed of all negotiations in connection with the grant of any concession; (b) that arrangements should be made to ensure that the interests of His Majesty’s Government should be specifically safeguarded in the event of any concession being granted; (c) that the interests of the Sheikh himself and of his principality should be sufficiently safeguarded in any f concession granted. 4. As you are aware, the Kuwait Oil Company have for a considerable period been in negotiation with the Sheikh. Before initiating those negotiations the Kuwait Oil Company placed themselves in touch with His Majesty s Government and were informed of the conditions set out above. Having undertaken to satisfy those conditions they were informed that no objection was seen to their initiating negotiations with His Excellency and they were also given to understand, long before it was known that your Company were in the field, that in the event of their reaching agreement with the Sheikh as to the terms of a concession within the limits indicated above, the approval of His Majesty's Government to the grant of such concession would not be withheld. 5. in the case of the negotiations between Messrs. Traders/Traders Limited and the Sheikh, no approach was made to His Majesty's Government hy your Company and no information that they desired to secure a concession in respect of this area was received hy His Majesty's Government until 28th November, although from the papers submitted with their application on that date it appeared that discussions with the Sheikh had reached an advanced stage by 2nd September. Despite the request in the opening paragraph of the Sheikh’s letter of 2nd September (which, as explained above, the Sheikh states that he did not in any way regard as constituting a grant of a concession to your Company) that your Company should place themselves in ccmmunication with ills Majesty s Government and obtain a telegraphic reply, a delay of almost three months took place before any communication was made to His Majesty's Government by your Company, by which time the negotiations between the Sheikh and the Kuwait Oil Canpany had been completed except for one or two minor points. 6 . Having regard to the understanding with the Kuwait Oil Company referred to in paragraph 4 above, to the fact that the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 have been satisfied by that Company, and that the in the exercise of his choice, has elected to grant a concession to that company, and to the camunication which His Excellency states he has made to ::.r.Gabriel, the Secretary of State now directs me to say that His Majesty j 4 .- nrvfpTfsr 6 with ib.© decision Government are not prepared to which the Sheikh has reached. They have therefore informed Kis Excellency, in accordance with the understand previously/4 previously reached with the Kuwait Oil Company, that they concur in his granting the concession to that Company. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,© 3SJCKb.T. D.O.No.C-577. My dear Fowle, POLITICAL AGSNCY, KUWAIT, The 28th December 1934, I am glad to say the Oil negotiations are through at last, for they have caused me no little worry and anxiety, especially the last stages* 2, As you will have seen from my telegram and other correspondence on the subject, the Shaikh signed the Concession in the Drawing Room of the Agency at 11 A.M. on Sunday the 23r&gt;1 December and Holmes ani ^hiaholm followed suit, I acted xhe part of official witness etc. 3. There is no doubt in ny mind that the Kuwait Oil Company had a very narrow ercape, and that the American side of the Company (Gulf) were very nearly the victims of what I believe to have been a barefaced attempt to ’’double cross’* them, on the part of tbeir rllies an friends, the British side (A#?.O.C.Ltd*). &gt; '7i |0 4. If you will rsfer to asy Secret D.O.C-297, dated 17til Not nmbetr end myftelegraia Ho.32S of 15th December, you will see that in November I was well on the track of the hostile Oil concern, which was operating from Basra (and which later turned out to be Traders Ltd.) and every fresh piece of evidence that I have since been able to get hold of has tended to confirm my suspicion:* that the A.P.O.C. were the hidden hand behind 'Traders'. 5. Of course the l.P.O.C. have covered their tracks well, end one will never, I suppose, be able to prove anything against them, which In any case would be undesirable. That very strong suspicion attaches to them, however, will be seen from the enclosed 'Note', which I send you, the contents of which I have gone to great pains to The Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C. Fowle, G.B.E., rolitlccl Resident, in the Persian ulf, BU.HI3F.2 pains to get hold of both from Basra, Baghdad ond London. 6. The shaikh of course has been to blame from our point of viev for his stupid excess of secrecy, but from his own point of view (and don’t forget he is a Nejdi) he has played a supremely clever game, and has forced the Kuwait Oil Company in the end to grant him all he wanted. v ^ ,1 ^ 7. I taKe a lit*cle credit to myself for having 'saved the Shaikhs bacon' to some oxuont with His Majesty’s Government, oy getting through to you on 17th November my Secret D.CUNo.C-297, Thiicii I trust not only put His Majesty’s Government on their guard against the ^.P.O»C*, out uo a certain extent aLowed that the ^h^-uch did mako some sort of be la tod effort to xeep me informed of what was going on ; though not until I had got most of the f* ctu my soli. 3. After the uoncsssion wa^ signed, i t:acxcle&lt;i lolnes judiciously about Traders Ltd., and found out enougn to satisfy me that he had been suspicious as far back as May 1934 that something seriously wrong with the internal affairs of the Kuwait Oil Company, especially when he received a wire from London telling him and Chisholm to get hold of K.B.Mirve Ho homed of Basra, and entrust him with all their .Wg Arabic translation work. Holmes who says he refused to act as ordorod did not apparently begin to find out about the full nature of the 'plot' until he ani Chlshola returned from London early in October last. From that date, however, although he did not say this to a*, I feel sure he got ,ell on to the traoh of Traders and kept his American principals in London fully informed of every move. 9. Chisholm, I am confident now, knew all about Traders Ltd. as far back as May 1934, also, and though I say this with the utmost reserve, I feel sure he was made to act the part of liaison officer between some one high up ^ and Frank Strick &amp; Co., of Basra, in the A.P.O.C. in London, anaof Basra, including Mir a Mohamad and Gabriel. In part proof of this, I may mention that since his return from London in October he has made some 6 trips to Basra and on each occasion visited Frank Strides offices, and those of Mirza Mohamed and Gabriel. lo. I will go further and say that on the night of June 17th 1934, and actually when my wife and I broite our journey in Baghdad whilst en route to the United Kingdom, Chisholm secretly it seems met the following persons (Claude Hotel) also in Baghdad:- (a) K.B.Mir^a l&amp;h&amp;med, (b) Mr. Gabriel, (o) Ilajji Aodulla v.illiamson, (d) 'Hie locca ^.P.O.C. igent in /Kuwait (an Arab), (a) Shaikh Salim al Hamud al Subah, cousin of the Shaikh of Kuwait and a very prc-^.P.u.C* personage. At this meeting bhisholm, I have reason to believe, propunded the forthcoming oempaign of Traders Ltd., and discussed plans and methods of procedure. A. xi. It is a curious fact that ever since my arrival back from Bagiaad (loth October) OhiBliolm from being the very open and delightful rriend of the family that he used ■ to be, all of a sudden adopted a close and decidedly aloof j attitude. X now put this down to the fact that he had | received 'his orders' in London, and not only 'disliked' ■playing a dual role, bat definitely felt he was playing a 'dirty' game, end was ashamed of himself. He certainly was continually at loggerheads during this period with Holmes, and whatever progress Holmes seemed to make in the negotiations he, Chisholm, appeared to want to spoil. 12. Actually when the Oil Concession was finally signed (on 23rd December) Chisholm showed a curious lack of enthusiasm, in my house, Just as if he were a 'beaten' man. Holmes on the contrary acted the part of 'con uering hero'. According to Holmes - though I say this with reserve - ChisholmChisholm volunteersd the inforiaation to him (after they had gone home from signing) that he had all along been aware of Traders activities in Basra but had not liked to say so to Holmes,lest he get 'worried' about it. He also passed the cryptic remark that 'some people in this world had to do lots of things by order which greatly went against the grain of a decent minded person^. I'rcKi this you will gather that right up to 23rd December neither mentioned a word to the other about the existence of Traders presumebly because for his part Holmes believed Chisholm to be acting the traitor and Chisholm because he felt guilty. 13. I give the above facts at length in order oo show you what has been going on out here, and the unpleasant atmosphere that has surrounded and hampered the last stages of the Oil negotiations. 14. Can it be wondered, I ask, that the Shaikh who (as he told me a few days before he signed the Concession) believed ttet he saw in Traders Ltd., the hand of the A.P.O.C., decided to go all out and play with them to suit his own hand. You remember that I reported this to you when you were last here (22nd December/. 15. The last stages of the Oil negotiations were I now know marked by an intensive propaganda from Traders Ltd. among the leading people of Kuwait, and it is Yuliy admitted n 0 w that Gabriel distributed large sons of money in the Town, on behalf of Traders Ltd., ® that pressure should be brought on the Shaikh, to decide the right way. Gabriel employed sub-Agents to pay out the money, one of whom was the --.P.u.C. local i-gent himself, I understand. It is even said - though 1 can hardly believe this - that in two oases certain |j individuals received Hs.5000/- apiece, and two others Rs. 10,000/ Certain it is now that Gabriel and his backers were confident of success right up to the end, especially after Traders in London had made contact with His Majesty's Government. 16. In conclusion, I enclose, with my attached note.note, a cutting which appeared in the Iraq TIMES of December 18th 1934 and which curiously supports what I have said about the ^.PoC. The relative portion reads as follows:- 'Lord Greenway, President of the ^.P.O.C.Ltd *, died 'at Ramsey,Hampshire, yesterday at the age of 77. r 'Lod Greenway was one of the founders of the Company, 'and was also senior partner in Shaw, Wallace. &amp; Co. , 'who have large business connections in Iraq, India w and Ceylon”. 17. I trust that what I have written will not be taken in any way as suggesting that I want to T? down n anyone, or get anyone into trouble. My sole desire is to show that the suspicions, which I propunded in my D.O.C-297 of 17th November were not empty ideas cased had more behind them than met the eye.

Present: Mr.J.C.Walt on, Mr.J.G.Laithwaite. Mr.Stevens ) Kuwait oil Co . Mr .Kemp The Company’s representatives had asked for an interview in order to report the 'final points' which the Sheikh of Koweit wished embodied in the Commercial Agreement and details of which they had now received from their representatives. 2. The points in question are attached as an appendix to this note. Mr.Stevens intimated that the Company were telegraphing to Koweit to clear up certain obscurities and that the Company’s representatives would probably ask for an interview to-morrow to discuss these matters further if a reply had been received by then. On the camnercial side the Sheikh had now made it quite clear that he insisted on the 'won and saved' basis. The other points involved were of relatively minor importance. So far as the Government is concerned the Company ■were anxious to know whether in the interest of closing the negotiations the Government would be prepared to accept the modification now proposed in the article dealing with the appointment of the Chief Local Representative. Mr.Stevens was informed that this question would be further considered. 3 . Mr. Stevens then enquired whether in the event of the Conpany deciding to adjourn negotiations „ rising the Sheikh to a more in the hope of bringing w reasonable/ V *j!2 reasonable frame of mind they could 'be sure that no other competitor would he allowed to enter the lists. Could we confirm that no application had in fact been received from any other competitor ? 4. Mr.Walt on replied that an application had in fact now been received. He was not in a position to make any statement regarding it, since we were not ourselves at this stage fully informed of the position in regard to the applicants and the negotiations in which they had teen engaged. We were waiting for confirmation or otherwise from the Sheikh of infomation given us ty the applicant. If, when the points which were still in obscurity had been cleared up, it was necessary to entertain the application, the Kuwait Company would of course at once be informed. 5. Mr.Stevens expressed concern at the news that +&gt;1P field and asked a number of another applicant was in the .leio a questions which suggested that he had some knowledge both of the fact that an all British company had applied,that the B.O.D. might be interested,and that Parli^entar^ pressure might be brought to bear in favour British company as against a Company ^ 1 in Kuwait Oil Company, was 5C^ American. He enq^ particular whether, in the event o proving to represent a substantial would have to be considere the oompeting question 0U Company were in other respects company and the Ku diff e re nce to the attitude of ■ 5 r \pnt iral would make any dill • identical, wou tliat it was impossible H.M.G. He was informed m P before we t. a,.! ««» Mpo “* W “ Uy - “ tt. info-fn »» Z questions «ioh that nationality was on ^ in dealing with H.M.G. would have o take^in^ ^ ^ ^ ^ any application w - t Mr .Stevens might, was impossible to say more than that. ^ however, be sure that full and fair cons ^3 be given to all parties concerned. 6* Mi'-. Stevens said that there had been during his association with the Kuwait Oil Company considerable Parliamentary criticism of the fact that American interests had been allowed to establish themselves in the Persian Gulf. Would that make any difference to the attitude of the Government? Mr.Walton replied that it was obvious that a democratic government cannot altogether ignore criticism, whether ill-founded or not. Mr.Stevens finally enquired whether, if the Company were prepared to meet the Sheikh on all outstanding points and the Sheikh were in consequence to sign the concession on Monday, His Majesty's Government would be prepared.to grant their approval, or whether they would hold up approval pending investigation of the application put forward by the new competitor. He was informed in reply that we could not say; an answer which he received with some concern. 7. In conclusion, Mr.Stevens was informed that as we did not yet know where we stood in regard to the nee? ■plicant we should have preferred to say nothing to him at .is Stage. He had been given this information only because . had specifically asked for it, and on the understanding lat it would be regarded as entirely confidential and iouId not be repeated to the Persian Gulf. He said that ne ; reed as to this, but was anxious tobe allowed to mention t to Mr.Fraser as representing the A.P.O.C. share x -‘ tR ~ He informed that he might do this, await Oil Company. He was mioxiueu lt on the same understanding. It would do nothing but, Harm f this information were to become generally known at the resent stage. Once we knew where we stood in regard to the ew application we would then be able to tell him something officially* Later. /Later* / Mr*Fraser telephoned and asked what the effect would be if his Company did, what they ordinarily might do in a case of commercial competition, viz: clinch with the Sheikh as soon as possible. Mr.Walton said he did not think it would be of advantage to anybody to rush matters with the Sheikh, since if our enquiries show that the other competitor’s application has to be taken seriously, we should in any case have to consider his proposition in conjunction with that of the Kuwait Oil Company* 12th December 1934.By Air Mail. 19^*- UJ ^.v i.V* INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, 2 8 DEC 1954 Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political ! Department, India Office. A copy has been sent to 3057 by Mai! pH'INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. * p.Z. 7722/34. 17th December 1934. My dear George* You sent me in your letter of 29th November, E.7143/ 160/91, a draft record of the conversations we had with Lord Lloyd on the afternoon of 27th November about Koweit oil. As I have explained to you, no reply was at the time sent to that letter, since we thought it desirable to get a full report from the Gulf (with a view to deciding whether the application was bona fide and one to be taken seriously) as to whether anything had in fact taken place between the Sheikh and Messrs. Traders, Limited, and if so what. It was decided that it would be best that Powle should himself take the matter up with the Sheikh and the instructions to him on the subject were not, therefore, repeated to Dickson; but, as you will see from the correspondence, a full set of which is now enclosed, some delay took place owing to illness in Fowls’s family, and we received the desired repcrt only today. But the Sheikh, before the matter was broached with him by Dickson on 15th December, had apparently informed Gabriel* acting on behalf of Traders Ltd., that he had arrived at agreement with the Kuwait Oil Company and further conversations must cease”• 2 , The Kuwait Oil Company today officially informed us that the Sheikh had intimated that he was now prepared to sign a concession in their favour as soon as the necessary document could be prepared, and asked us to miorm the Resident that H.M.G. approved his doing so. We took note of the information given us by the Company, reminded them of the fact that another application had been received, and ^Kendel Esq.., C.M.G., promised/promised to let them have a reply at the earliest possible date and to do what we could to ensure that it should reach them bei’ore Christmas. The Company, while reluctantly accepting that the matter was one on which we must consult other departments and higher authority here, emphasised not only the urgency of the matter, but their view that the formal acceptance by the Sheikh of the Company's terms automatically ruled out any other applicant who might previously have been in the field* 3. We are anxious to meet the Company so far as possible, and now suggest that the question of the replies to be sent to (a) the Kuwait Oil Company, (b) Traders Limited, be discussed here at an inteictepartmental meeting on Wednesday, December 19th, at 3*30, m the light oi the correspondence circulated herewith, which is, we think, self-explanatory. We hope to have submitted the papers to Sir S.Hoare (who has of course been in touch with levelopments throughout) and to have received his .nstructions as to the provisional proposals to be laid lefore the meeting for consideration by then. In the light 5 f discussion we would hope to be able to reach agreement iS to the replies to be sent by the end of the week.

Lord Lloyd rang me up to-day and said that he had been thinking over the Gulf oil position further and that he felt that all the information that reached him tended to show that things were going from bad to worse and that there was a real danger of the Americans establishing themselves in Koweit. He had, as I knew, most reluctantly refrained over what was now a long period from ventilating this question in Parliament, but he diu not feel that he coula ao so any longer and he thought he might find it necessary to put down a question in the House of Lords before Christmas. I said that this must, of course, be a matter entirely for his decision. So far as I was aware there had been no recent material change in the situation. 2. Lord Lloyd then enquired whether we could give him any understanding that, if he aia not press the matter in Parliament at this stage, no final decision would be taken in the Gulf. I said that, as I had warned him before, these commercial negotiations, which had been proceeding for a very long time, haa reached a very advanced stage, and that, while it was not for me to say, I thought it was impossible to give any such guarantee. Lord Lloyd expressed great regret at this, but asked that we should bear his point in mina and give it consideration. J*G# LAITHWAITS. 12th December 1934.P.Z. 7402/34. India OFffiaa. OONfflDENTlAL. NQTD UP A CONVZr(3AIION ffirri LORD LLOYD ON IvDNDAY. ora j I5S4 9 KQ 2j 1 1 uiL. Lord Lloyd rang me up this morning to say that Mr. Hunting haa come to see him ana tola him that he had been kindly receivea Ly the India Office, with whom he had left a copy of his concession. He was, however, apprehensive lest the sheikh shoula get into trouble for what he had none and perhaps he so frightened as to repudiate his agreement altogether. Lord Lloyd wished to pass this on ana said tnat he .trusted we would not he too hard on the sheikh. He repeated tnat he had no personal interest in Mr. Hunting and Traders Ltd., and said that he haa never heard of them until they had come to see him as the result of his speech about oil at the Central Asian Dinner in October. His sole anxiety was to lend support to British interests and try to redress tne injury which had been done by allowing American interests to establish themselves in the Persian Gulf. 2. I said that Lora Lloya would appreciate that we must, of course, ascertain from the sheikh whether in fact he had written the letter produced oy mn. Hunting, and on the general position and the Question of our attitude towards the sheikh he would a.gree tnat it might have been very awkward if the sheikh had, without approval, given a concession, e.g., to wholly American interests/Interests. We were investigating Mr. Hunting's application. But there must clearly he some little uelay oecause we woula have to refer the matter to the Gulf, ana to make enquiries about their position, as to wnii-h we haa no inaepenaent information, ana also examine their proposals. Haa Lora Lloya noticed the British control provisions in tneir araft concession? If lie woula look at it he woulu fins tnat it was very loosely expressed indeed end seemed to afford no substantial safeguard. On another point, we had omitted to ask Mr- Hunting whether, if ne secured the concession, he would work it himself, or merely pass it on. could Lord Lloyd throw any light on this? 3. Lord Lloyd said that he had not in fact looked at the concession at all closely. He had merely been anxious to put Traders Ltd. in touch with the appropriate authority and ao what ne could to forward what he believed to be a British project. But it would, of course, be essential for H.M.G. fully to safeguard British interests and to tighten up any doubtful clauses as might be necessary. It was, of course, the business of the Departments to check the details of the concession As regards the working of the concession ne understood that Mr. Hunting was contemplating workin &amp; it himself if he got it, but he really knew very little about him or his plans. As regards the standing of tne Company, he had been impressed by the names attached to his application. Some of those names appeared to be persons of substance. I said that on the face of it this certainly seemed to be so, and that they seemed to be largely concerned with the B»0«D*, which, as Lord Lloyd was aware, was now less than 50% British, but that we would/woula, of course, examine tnis aspect of trie matter fully. In conclusion Lora Lloya again Peggea that, as it was a British ana not an American interest whicn appeared to nave secured tnis undertaking from the sneikh, we snoula not he too haru on His Excellency for anything he haa aone, and I said we would take note of what he had said and that we would of course give the closest consideration to the proposals of Traders Ltd.

On 17th April 1934 the Kuwait Oil Company infoimed the India Office that they had received an intimation from their negotiators in Koweit that the Sheikh had warned them (? on 12th April) that he had received on the 11th April a telegram frcm a hundred per cent. British company asking for permission to open negotiations. 2. The Company were informed in reply that H.M.G. had no information that any such offer had been made. The B.O.D. seemed unlikely to be interested, but in any event were only about 51/£ British. As the result of the discussion the Resident was however on the same day instructed by telegraph that Colonel ’’Dickson might ascertain the position as regards alleged offer by outside company and remind Sheikh that he is not at liberty to grant any concession without the prior consent of H.M.G. As you will appreciate we should, of course, in practice, apart from this, expect him to consult us before opening any negotiation”. (Telegram 17th April, Secretary of State to Political Resident, No. 962, P.Z. 2559/34). 3. On 23rd April Colonel Dickson reported that he had read the India Office telegram practically word for word to the Sheilth and had thereafter discussed it with him. No one else had been present and there had teen no interpreter (Colonel Dickson is a fluent Arabic speaker). 'The Sheikh admitted that he had received a telegram/2. 6/ fteTraders ^cession ;'fers 5 lakhs signature. J.G.L. telegram from London purporting to come from an all British concern. The letter had asked permission to open negotiations and offered over 5 lakhs of rupees on his signing, as well as other equally favourable x terms. Ke could not divulge the name of Company even to me, but would say that he had replied that he could not consider the offer unless negotiations with the Kuwait Oil Company shewed signs of breaking down altogether...The Sheikh finally assured me that he perfectly well understood that only an all- British or a 50/50 British company would be allowed by H.M.G. to compete for the Koweit oil concession'. (Political Agent Koweit to Political Resident, 24th April, C.146. P. Z. 2921/34) . 4. On the 2nd May Colonel Fowle telegraphed to the Secretary of State in a telegram repeated to Colonel Dickson, with reference to Colonel Dickson’s statement reported in the preceding paragraph, that 'Sheikh presumably understands from Dickson that he should consult us before opening any negotiations with outside companies'. (Political Resident to Secretary of State 449, dated 2nd Lay, P.Z.2941/54). 5 . On the 3rd May Colonel Dickson reported that Major Holmes (? on 2nd May) had 'expressed the opinion that the Sheikh was being pressed from an outside quarter and so had decided to force an early issue with the Kuwait Oil Company. He mentioned that he had inner information that the Sheikh had received two further telegrams from the strange company, whom he suspected to be the B.O.D.' (Political Agent to Political Resident 3rd May, C.163, P. Z. 3301/34).3. 6. On 6th June the Company informed the India Office that the Sheikh had informed their negotiators that unless the Kuwait Oil Company would accept draft Ho. 4 (being a draft unacceptable to the Company, unaccept able also in certain respects to H.M.G., and drawn up without instructions by the negotiators) in toto 'he does not wish to continue discussions at present, but wishes them postponed until next September or a later convenient date. Pending a renewal of discussions the Sheikh has said that he will not entertain or discuss any offers from other parties, and he wishes the negotiators to return to London to explain.. .his point of view. We (i.e. the Kuwait Oil Company) are instructing the negotiators to return. .. after writing a letter to the Sheikh agreeing to postpone discussions in accordance with his wishes on his undertaxing not to negotiate with others in the meanwhile'. 7. On the 8th June, after discussion with the India Office the Company agreed not to withdraw their negotiators without consultation with us. 8. On the 15th June the Company stated that the Sheikh had warned the negotiators that he could not understand why they were remaining in Koweit m view of his expressed wish that they should return home and that if they did not leave at once he would withdraw his offer of a period of grace until next Septemoer. The negotiators were thereupon authorised by the Company to withdraw (P.Z. 4025/34). 9. On 20th June, the Political Agent Koweit was informed by Mr.Chisholm, one of the negotiators, 'that/4. ft A i ?.Z. 7170/34 f.Tel.lOlC 22 / 11 . ’’that Sheikh promised him not to receive or consider for a period of three months from 14th June offers from other parties for oil concessions”. (P.Z.4145/34). 10. On 2nd September (i.e. within the 3 months period) the Sheikh wrote his letter to Mr. Gabriel, accepting, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the draft concession put forward by Traders Limited. 11. Negotiations between the Kuwait Oil Company and the Sheikh were resumed early in October and have been proceeding actively since. The latest information received from Koweit (there has been consideraole correspondence and discussion with the Sheikh) is thao the points outstanding are very few indeed. 12. Apparently later in November the Sheikh informed the political Agent that in August^ an Iraqi had approached him offering terms financially and otherwise more favourable than those offered by the Kuwait Oil Company. He had replied that the Company must first approach His Majesty's Government and secure their approval. J.

After discussion v/ith Mr. Wakely, Mr. Walton and I saw Mr. Planting and Lieutenant-Colonel Bovill, representing Traders, Limited, on 28th November. Mr. Planting at the opening of the meeting produced an official letter of 28th November from Traders Limited to the Secretary of State for India intimating that the Sheikh of Koweit had declared his readiness to grant an oil concession to Traders Ltd., covering the whole of Koweit, subject to the approval of Plis Majesty’s Government. The Company’s official letter enclosed a draft of the concession in the terms stated to have been accepted by the Sheikh, together with a translation by Mr. Gabriel, the Sheikh’s lawyer, of an Arabic letter, stated to be the Sheikh’s autograph, from the Sheikh intimating his willingness to grant a concession to the Company, subject to the approval of Plis Majesty’s Government. A list of the persons and companies associated with the application now put forward by Traders Limited was also enclosed. 3. The Company’s representatives were informed that the application they had put forward would cleaily require consideration and that we would suomit the matter. In replyto a question as to the period over which they had been negotiating with the Sheihh they stated that negotiations Had been proceeding since last April. When reminded of the Shaikh's Treaty obligations in regard to the grant Of concessions and of the faot +hn+ • lact tnat their approach should m the first place have been made to His Majesty's Government or the political authorities concerned, they answered that had they adopted that course they would not to-day be so far advanced as they were. Mr. Hunting o_j.erud no explanation of this remark. (Presumably he may have meant that - as Lord Lloyd had alleged - Majesty o eovornment supposed attitude towards the ---nglo-Persian Oil Company made his company think that they had better try to confront us with a fait accompli so far as P^siblel) They were, Mr# Hunting said, well aware u '' ic3j t terms embodied in their concession were more fa v oui able than those which had so far been offered by tne Mu wait Oil Company and they doubted if the Kuwait Gil Company were so far advanced as they might imagine.

My dear Gilbert, I send you herewith the draft record of the conversations we had with Lord Lloyd on the afternoon of the 27th November. I have, as you see, somewhat redrafted the first five paragraphs, and I have had your preliminary amendments embodied in the remainder. I have also made one or two minor verbal amendments elsewhere. 2. If you concur in this draft, I think it might now be well to circulate copies, with the necessary explanations as to the previous conversation with me to which Lord Lloyd we referred and the action which/took thereon, to the Admiralty and Petroleum Department for their information. It should also be explained in the covering letter, with reference to the final paragraph of,the record, that, on the only occasions in the summer and autumn when the Foreign Office unofficially advised Lord Lloyd against taking up the Question publiclj, what we had in mind was not so much the Koweit negotiations - although we were of course most anxious that the otandaru Oil of California should not be encouraged to enter into competition with the Roweit Oil Company in Kowe it - delicate negotiations still proceeding between the Aiiglo- Persian Oil Conpany - Iraq Petroleum Company and the Sheilm of Qatar for the Qatar concession. What we told Lord Lloyd was that any premature publicity about oil questions in the Gulf might well have precisely the result which he wished to avoid, i.e. further stimulation of competition by a purely American group, and the reduction of the chances of any concession going to the groups which were predominantly, or at any rate very largely Brxtisn. Yours ever,P#Z. 7311/34. KCVoIT OIL. Conversations with Lord Lloyd. Lord Lloyd rang me up this afternoon with reference to his previous conversation with me (E 6972) and ashed whether I had any further information as to the oil situation in Koweit. I said that, as a result of his previous communication, we had made discreet enQuiries, hut had heen unahle to obtain any information as to any concession having heen given to any British group such as he described. Lord Lloyd said this was very odd as the concession had actually oeen signer, and he had heen given a copy. Lord Lloyd admitted, however, after some further discussion, that the copy oi the agreement that he haa before him was undated, and that the Hunting Group, though they haa clearly given him to understand that it had heen signed and concluded, haa not categorically saia so in writing. Lord Lloyd eventually said that he would obtain furtner particulars as to the concession from Mr. Hunting and ring me up again• 2. Lord Lloyd was anxious to know whether the negotiations between the Anglo-Persian OH Company Gulf Oil group ana the sheikh of Koweit haa mane any progress. I said that I believea that they were well advanced. 3. Lord Lloyd also enquired whether any progress had been made as regards the negotiations which he understood were going on between British and American oil interests in connexion with the Bahrain oil concession. He had understood/2 understood thut tnere had oeen a proposal on foot which might have resulted in transfer of the Bahrain concession to British interests in return for the grant to .American interests of increased marketing facilities, especially in the Par East. The American-Bahrain Oil Company had recently tried to market their oil in Japan, hut had experienced difficulties. Lord Lloyd was under the impression that the result of the ne60tiations might he much affected hy what happened as regards the solution of these difficulties. I told Lord Lloyd in reply that this question was one which was being dealt with entirely between the various oil interests concerned hy direct negotiations carried on in their own way, and that I was therefore very much in the dark as 10 the situation, about which I feared I could give him no information. 4. Lord Lloyd had already explained that he would almost certainly feel it his duty to raise the whole question of our oil policy in the Persian Gull in the House of Lords at an early date, as he felt most strongly that the virtual exclusion of purely British interests from tnis area was in the nature of a national disaster. 5. Immediately after this conversation I asked ]Vir. Laithwaite to come over, and having explained the position to him I rang up Lora Lloya again and asked him to discuss the matter over the telephone airect with Mr. Laithwaite, since he was much better informed than I as to the situation in Koweit. The greater part of the remainder of this record, which embodies what passed in Mr./3 lur. Laithwaite's telephonic conversation with Lord Lloyd (to which I listened in on niy second telephone receiver) has been dictated by Lr. Laithwaite himself. 6. Lord Lloyd said that in the first place he did not wish to ash for any confidential information, but he felt that in the interest of British interests in the Gulf, which he considered of great importance, it would be his duty, unless some steps could be taken to break up the American block in the Gulf, to raise the matter in the House of Lords. He had felt it his duty to give Mr. itendel the information recorded in E 6972 and now to raise the matter again with a view to avoiding any suggestion by the Government, if he had to attack them in public, that he had not laid all his cards on the table and given them the fullest possible information. In his view the Government ought to have taken steps, before allowing matters to go as far as they had in Koweit, to make quite sure that there was no British company which could be induced to interest themselves in that area. 7. Mr. Laithwaite said in reply that theinformation which Lord Lloyd had given me had come as a complete surprise. We had no information that any negotiations had taken place between the sheikh and the group mentioned by him. The group in question did in fact appear to contain individuals of some substance and closely associated with the British Qix Development Company, but if they were in fact competing as a British group they must have known that the oheikh was bound by special arrangements to H• M♦ G# as regards oil» and that their proper course was to approach the sheikh only through H.M.G. or the proper political authorities. 8 /B. As regards a further point wnich Lord Lloyd had raised, he was prohahly well aware that the Koweit oil Company, which represented the fusion of Anglo-persian Oil Company and American interests, had come into heing only after lengthy endeavours hy the Anglo-Persian oil Company to capture this concession for themselves. The terms which they were in a position to offer as independent competitors appeared to nave been capped hy American interests. Mr. Laithwaite tnought it was fair to say that there haa really been no alternative British group to the Anglo-Persian Oil company at any earlier stage of the negotiations. Traders Limited were now apparently coming forward as competitors on a British basis, but Lord Lloyd would appreciate in the first place that it would be necessary to conduct close investigations into the financial standing and bona fides of any group which came forward, secondly, very substantial financial offers were understood to have been made to the sheikh of Koweit by the Koweit Oil Company' and it would be difficult to persuade the Sheikh to accept any less favourable offer from anotxier company, even if its composition were British. Thirdly, negotiations between tne sheikh ana tne Kowe it oil Company were, so far as we were aware, now at a very advanced stage indeed. 9. Lord Lloyd said that he had no personal interest in Traders Limited. He was solely concerned Vvitb British prestige and British interests in the Gulf. He was supporting Traders Limited because, so ^ar as he knew, they v/ere British and they had asked for his help If for any reason they had made an error in/ on that ground.5 in approaching the Sheikh airect he much regretted it and could only think that it was aue to uncertainty as to the attitude of tne Government Departments, who were regarded as being active supporters of the Anglo-persian Oil Company. But he trusted that any such error would not prejudice them if they were now to make an official approach to H.M.G. As regards the Sdeikh and his interests, these could not, he thought, be paramount. We had done much for Koweit in the past, ana the aeciding factor in a Question such as tne present coula not be whether the sheikh woula benefit to the extent of a few thousand pounds more or less: it must be British interests. He knew that we could if we wished bring strong pressure tojp ear on these small Pers ian Gulf Sheikhs ana make them do what we wanted. As regards the state of the negotiations between the sheikh ana tne Koweit Oil Company, he begged us, even if it were now the eleventh hour, to lena a sympathetic ear to Traders Limited if they approached us. Woula we be prepared to discuss matters with them, and if so ought they to approach the Foreign Office or the Inaia Office? 10. , Mu Laithwaite said that he did not think we could entirely accept his views a^to the financial position of the sheikh. It would be most difficult for us to say to the sheikh '’You must break off negotiations with tne Company with which, with the approval of H.M,G«, you have now been negotiating for a considerable time, ana which lias offered substantial financial inducements you, ana you must commence negotiations with an alternative group wnich has indeed tne great advantage, from the point of view of the Government, of being British, but which may not be able to give you the same price/-6- price for your concession”. We should find it very difficult to convince the Sheikh of the validity of such a propoeition. As lor Traders Limited, we should he prepared to discuoS matters with them if they had any positive pi oposition to make. But they must realise that matters woig now at a most advanced stage in the discussion at Koweit. 11. If they approached the Government they should approacn the India Office, which, while it concerted its action in oil questions with the foreign Office, was now the department primarily responsible for oil questions in this area, in consultation with the other interested departments. 12. Lord Lloyd said that ho could not say whether Traders Limited ?;ould be prepared in fact to communicate with a Government department. But he v/ould himself at once approach them about it, and only hoped that if, as a result, they should approach the India Office, we should deal with them sympathetically. Mr. Laithwaite said that we should certainly give them a sympathetic hearing within the limits which he had indicated above. 13. Lord Lloyd again deplored the way in which His Majesty’s Government had, according to him, capitulated to America throughout this affair. He said that one of the most deplorable and scandalous pages in the history of the business and one which would produce a very bad effect if h^ had to refer to it in public was that the peak of the negotiations took place during Mr. Mellon’s tenure of the United States Embassy He then indulged in a mild diatiibo against our general subserviance to the United States, ana e^plain^ that his essential object was to redress the balance in the Persian/7. &lt;• loioicJi Cxiil^ in favour of the truo intorosts of this country. 1^. Lord Lloyd subsequently again rang up and spoke to Mr. Lai thwaito. Ho said that in the light of tho conversation he had got in touch with Traders Limited and strongly advised them to put themselves right with the Government and get into touch with the India Office. 15. Pie made the further point that he had for some time been restrained by the Foreign Office only with difficulty from ventilating the whole of this question, of which he took so serious a view, was it entirely fair that when he had held his peace because he was advised in that it was/the best interests of the country, Government departments should be pressing on in tho Gulf with steps designed to hand the concession over to a syndicate which, even if 5Q^ British, was likely in practice to be under a decisive American influence. Las It too late even at this stage, when he had shown that there was a purely British group in the field, to close the negotiations down?. Mr. Laithwaite said that ho doubted whether there was any very material difference, emccpt as regards small points, botvvoen the position of tho K owe it concession when Lord Lloyd had first spoken to the Foreign Office last May, and the position to-day. The e concession had been decided by ssential features ol the last spring. Negotiations for a concession had nov 7 almost reached finality and ~ould t be abruptly broken off. It was not only as though it re a question of a new concession for which a Br' mpany were competing. Mr. Laithwaite would, however,© 8 . 16. Lord Lloyd more than onoe hinted in the course of thu conversation that he would probably feel compelled to raise the matter in the House of Lords in the near future. if so he thought that our weakness towards the Americans would create a deplorable impression. He might even feel obliged to say that we had begged him to hold his peace and taken advantage of his silence to push forward our particular policy.p.Z. 7170/34. * r Personal and Secret, INDIA OPPICEj WHITEHALL ? S.P.l 22nd November, 1934. 1 My dear George, With further reference to our conversation of the 20th November about Kov^eit Oil, I enclose a copy of the latest telegram from Foule. The overtures reported in it are no doubt the basis of Lord Lloyd’s statement to you. The Sheikh seems to have behaved quite properly, both in his reply to the company and in informing the Political Agent of what had taken place, and we can, I think, for the inomenc await developments. 2. Prom Dickson’s telegram of 21st November, No.307, of vihich copies are being sent you to-day under our printed letter P.Z. 7150/34. it looks as though the prospect of an agreement between the Kuwait Oil Company and the Sheikh is definitely rather better. Prom Stevens, whom Tfalton and I saw informally today, we gather that the Company propose to press the Sheikh further on two minor points, but we hope that no insuperable difficulty will arise over these. Tours ever, (Sd.) GILBERT LAI THTAITE.aiiair as far as possible. The information had been given to him in confidence, and he did not wish to be quoted, but at the same time he felt bound to pass it on to me confidentially, so that there might be no misunderstanding about his own position if he eventually raised the matter publicly, and he would maeed he glad if I would make a note of what he haa saia so that it might be on record. He then went on to tell me that tne new interest, which he was informed was wholly British, was represented by Mr. p. LI.Hunting ana was known as the Hunting Group, or 'Traders Limited', i.m. hunting was a Director of the B.O#D, (Mosul Oiliields Limited), but the B.O.D. were not concerned in this matter, and ME. Hunting was acting independently. The iollowing were, however, associated with him in iraders Limited';- Lora Glencanner, Charles Tennant, Sons and Company, Limited, sir Hichard Bedmayne, Mr. Edward Tennant of Hohler and Company, Mr. H,H.Holmes, and several others. o. It appears that Mr. Hunting has now informed Lord Lloyd that his group have concluded an agreement with the sheikh of Koweit (the signed and sealed text of which, in English and Arabic, has apparently been shown to Lord Lloyd by Mr. Hunting) by which the sheikh grants an oil concession over the whole of nis territory to the Hunting Group 'subject to the approval of H.M.Government'. Lord Lloyd was unable to tell me anything about the terms of the concession except that the document is extremely long and complicated. But he clearly anticipated that if the sheikh had a free hand the concession v\oula go to the Hunting Group and not to the Anglo-&lt; ' Anglo-Persian-Gulf oil Combine. He was inclined to take the line that it was now up to H.M. Government to ensure that the concession went to a purely British concern instead of to one which was at least half American. Moreover, Lord Lloyd, who gave me the impression of being now definitely hostile to the A#P.OrC*, explained that he thought that for political reasons it wab most undesirable that all the oil in the Gulf, or rather all the British control over Gulf oil, should be concentrated in the hands of a single group, more especially as it was unlikely that that group would hurry to develop it.
