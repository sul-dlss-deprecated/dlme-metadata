I received a reply from the shaikh dated 7th Shaban 1337, which is encloeed herewith, stating that there has not been any unpleas«W*^ between him and the Headman, but that the latter has always been afraid # of the Shaikh. I replied the 8haikh f s letter (vide copy of my letter No.241 dated 7th Shaban 1337 («/5/l9) enclosed herein for your informat io'n) suggesting that the Headman of Fujaireh might come to Shargah to visit the Shaikh and strengthen his friendship with him so that firstly he may no longer have any apprehension of the Shaikh and the Shaikh may prevent him from interfering mischievously with the affairs of the Qawasem. I received a reply from the Shaikh dated 7th Shaban 1337, which I enclose herein, stating that he does not wish to reconcile with the Headman of Fujaireh through me nor Is • hg cr^ • t* ' V xeej there any need for the Headman of Fujaireh to/ihim. As the Headman of Fujaireh had sent his letter to me by a special messenger asking for a reply, I sent him a reply, No.24t) dated Oth Chaban 1337, copy enclosed for your informe- tion, stating that he should not come here in view of certain people's desire to keep him away from the Qa^asem, i.e. Chargah and Ras-ul-^haimeh. I added that in view of his insistent request and suggestion for reconciliation through ne between him and the Qawasem, I discussed the matter with the shaikh of rharfyah who said that the Headman firstly maintained apprehension of the C^aikh of Shargah and that f secondlyi the Shaikh did not want reconciliation to be effected between him and the headman of Pujaireh at present. I further said that as I did not know what object the Thaikh of Ghargah and his ally, the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain, had in view, and as they had^some serious intention such as arresting the Headman and deporting him from Fujaireh, I would therefore allow him to cone to Ras-ul-^haimeh and De^ai and get his requirements.

'Vith repard to rha '.kh I'anad r^arql and his ^riendly relations with you, and to your renark that he is afraid of coming to you, this is perhaps due to the misrepresentations of the people.

I have received your letter dated ^nd Thaban 1337 un sealed, and I have understood what you wrote about the dis continuation of your visits to the Coast. You should know that there was a cause for this. Firstly certain people, whor / you visited f had certain intentions to create quarrels with those people of the interior v 'ith whon you had allied yourself, and secondly, to deprive you of your alliance with the Qawasen, i.e. the Chaikh of Shar^ah and fron Ras-ul- Khaimeh and dependencies. You were therefore prevented. Now that you beg forgiveness in your letter, and propose peace in such a way as I consider fit for all parties concerned^there is no harw. I have been ill for sone months at Tharprah. According to former correspondence with the Resident, your visit to Shargah should be arranged by nie with a view to effecting reconciliation between you and the Shaikh of Shargah, ; I discussed the matter of your visit to nhargah with the Shaikh who said, firstly, that you are afraid of hin, and secondly, that he does not desire reconciliation between you and him at present. If you want to visit the ^ast to Vf ns to get your require- * ments, I can permit you to visit De^ai and Ras-ui-J^haimeh for I do not know what objects the Shaikh of Sharpah and his a lly&gt; ^be Chief of Umm-ul~Qaiwain, have in view.

I 'oep: to acknowledge receipt of your letter ^0.135, dated 16th August 1994, and note that you have heard of the fighting between the Shaikh o** Abu Dhabi and the bedoulrf, and that you renuire a report showing nares of th© places where f 1 phting has taken place, the names of the helpers of the Shaikh against the b©douimfighting with hiTn. T have the honour to state that y the Shaikh and the w (&amp;nas1r tribesmen has been fighting the tvO'V L ' fc bedouin^ since the last two years during which neriod both sides have been waging waflr against one another by sending expeditions. On the 94th Rabi TI, 1349 (=3rd December 1993) when the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi received assistance from Shaikh Rashid bin ran^a' and his followers ! f unasir tribesmen, the Shaikh of Abu Dha^i organised a t'orce consisting of some of the ^ una sir and Abu Dhabi tribesmen headed by his brother Shaikh Saqar bin Zaid and his two sons Hizza' and Shakhbut and ordered thsm to a village belonging to him named Al- ?r uataradli where it was fixed that some of his own subjects and Bedouins should .loin them and then he himself should also do the same. Shaikh Saqar left Abu Dhabi and traversed the wilderness for three days when Information was received by Bedouins the enemies of th© Shaikh. These bedouins consist of three tribesmen namely Durua* whose home 7 c ~ gutetb u Is ^a^ed Tinfi'Wn near the mountains, Bani Katab whose home is GiMjWMA named Al-Ficlaist and the Awamer whose abode is in the desert neay the home of the Durua* . They organised a for»ce of two hundred men to meet Shaikh Sanar and his men. The Bedouins came to a point one day distant from Abu Dhabi where they met 90 men on their way to join Shaikh Saqar. A fighting then took nlace between themj the Bedouins killed seven men oi whom one was Sail bin Buti related to t-e Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and wounded three men: one was Sultan bin Dhiab cousin of the Shaikh the others wore of Abu Dhabi nobles named Sultan bin Yntar and one Bin Juhur. The others surrendered and were disramed and their camels w ere taken by the Bsdouins and were therr lei t alone* T^ie Bolo-iiU ^ force«e*r^aiMutii£k (2) fore© returned to Its headquarters. The Abu Dhabi rren conn isting of the wounded and the disarmed came back to their town. n n their arrival the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi moved the 'unasir and left for Al-:'uataradh whore ^halkh Saqar had camped. Here the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi organised a force of five hundred nen under Shaikh % -Saqar bin 7aid and Shaikh Raahid bin 'ania* the Shaikh of ■'unaair and raided Al-Falaia the abode of the Beni Katab. They fired on each other from a distance and one man named bin Rabia' from the Beni Xatab tribesmen and another na^ed Saif bin 'uharmad bin Salmin of the Munasir tribesmen were killed. The -unasir tribesmen robbed carriels scattered about belonging to the Durua and Beni Katab; these were handed over to the Shaikh of Abu D^-abi. As a |retaliation the Ad-Durua and the Beni Katab and the Awamer raided on the Shaikh's villages in Bra1m i and took away some camels and returned. T^e Shaikh of Abu Dhabi then sent an expedition consisting of the ''unasir tribesmen and others to the Durua 1 country where they robbed 50 she-camels and returned without having fought or killed any body. The Durua Beni Katab and Al Awamer were informed that this expedition was effected against them by a few Bedouins together with the Shaikh of Debai subiects. The V^-Durua sent an expedition up to the suburbs of Debai and robbed 1? she-camels in retaliation for the entry of the Debai Bedouimin the expedition of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. From what I have gathered the covenant between Ad-Durua and the Shaikh of Debai is neutrality in case any of them fights, a third tribe, and this action of the Debai Bedouins was considered bythe Ad-Durua a violation of their covenant. But the Shaikh of Debai has not taken any part in these fightings not he has assisted the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. As a long time passed and no peace was arrived at summer and diving season also approached the people o^* Abu D^aM became very anxious and wanted to commence diving. For this reason they intervened for peace between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and the Munasir on the one hand and the three tribes on the other. The intervening party consisted of the Fha^h of 1 ^wr - (t) named Salin bin Doen, one of th© Shalkha of Al-Bushamis named Al-Hlain anl the Shaikh of Ibri named Sultan bin Raahid. ^aace waa then wmivitizixl between the fighting partiea thus that all murdera and nlundera that has ta^ren nlare between them ir&gt; old and recent times should be forgotten. Both parties agreed to this and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi returned to his home and the Munaair vent back up country. This war did not exten/L to the territories of the Trucial Shaikhs except by the robbery of the camels of Debai as mentioned above. The Shaikhs of Ad-Durua reached Shar^ah a few days ago, and when he came to know of this the Shaikh of Debai sent a nobleman of Debai to them and gave them his word of safety and then the Shaikhs came to Debai with the noble man and there settled their case with the Shaikh of Debai th^t the camels be restored to the Shaikh of Debai. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has not gained any thing from this fighting from the towns of the Beni Tatab or Ad-Durua tribesmen.M b i • ■flfl Draft v^or approval) To Foreign Secretary , Delhi . Sir , 1 have the honour to report that during the ^acfe past two years hostilities have been proceeding between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi of the Trucial Coast and the Bedouins of' t he interior . It ap ears that there was desultory skirmishing throughout 1923, each side sending several expeditions to attack the other. On the 3rd December 1923, Sraikh of Abu Dhabi organised a force of Munasir and Abu Dhabi tribesmen under his brother Shaikh Saqar bin Zaid , which was to be Joined by another force of his own men and Bedouins at one of his villages, Al-Muatar#dh f whelfte he was to Join them himself. Learnin^of this the Bedouins Gli, 1 of Durua, B4ni K^talr and Awamer, sent out a force of 200 men, who met a party of twenty going to Join Shaikh Saqar , and killed seven of them, woud.Qd three, and iA disarmed the remai -f)d©r . They then took their camels and ieft them. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi then went to Al-^^^aradh, and sent a force of 500 men under Shaikh Saqar and the Shaikh a, of Munasir, and raided Al-Falaia, the home of the Beni Katab , where one man was killed on either side and the raiders 'A 0-v- stole some camels of the Durfia and Beni p^tab . Counter raids followed, in one of which the Bedouins were informed % that the Shaikh of Qhafai' s subjects had j.oined . As this was a breach by this Shaikh of his commonly observed neutrality in disputes between these parties , they re- ♦ taliated by robbing camel^ from the suburbs of . When the season was approaching, the people of Abu Dhabi were anxious to begin diving, and so intervened between the Shaikh and the Bedouins , and Shaikhs Salim bin mn&gt; % 2 - ,'/) Din of Benl , Al-Hiain of Al B^hamis , and Sultan bii; feashid of Ibri patched up a peace between all the parties on tie basis of 'letting bygones be bygones' , and the com batants returned to their homes.

The British Residency Agent reports that on the night of the 5th June the Shaikh of Barauni sent a party 7 of 400 rifles to attack the village of 'Ain (or 'Aln Dhawahir) which is on the extreme boarder of Abu Dhabi territory. 3. This party fired the village but were repulsed by the garrison of the fort and retired having lost 22 men j killed or wounded. Abu Dhabi losses are reported as 5 killed and 2 wounded. 4. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi left Abu Dhabi for Baraimi on the 8th June with a force of 1000 rifles. Before leaving he is stated to have written a letter to the Shaikh ' Said of Debai inviting his co-operation, to which the Shaikh of Debai has not as yet made any reply. 5. The Shaikhs of Sharjah, Adman and Has al Khaimah are all related to the Shaikh^of Baraimi -anfl arw also of the same religous faction (GHAEERI) and it is reported that they are now in conference at Ras al Khaimah with a view to taking concerted action against the Shaikhs of Debai and Abu Dhabi should Debai Join forces with Abu Dhabi. 6. It would thus seem possible that tribal warfare may develop bgtween the Trucial wahabi (Ghafiri) and the Beni Yas (Hinawi). 7. It is noted that Lorrimer (page 261) gives 'Ain Dhawahir as belonging to Baraimi territory but I am informed that it belongs to Abu Dhabi who has both a fort and a summer residence there. 8.

The British Residency Agent reported that the Shaikh of Ahu Dhabi had not entered Baraimi territory but had halted some 20 or 25 miles from Abu Dhabi Mid was i apparently waiting for assistance from the Shaikh of Dehai before proceeding any further. 4. It is reported that he has had as yet no definite reply .to his letter to the Shaikh of Debai (my letter No. 117/35 dated 10th June 1931). Shaikh Said a few days ago despatched a caravan of 33 camels to Abu Dhabi with a present of provisions . for his troops. This caravan was attacked xn Abu Dhabi territory by a force belonging to the Shaikh of Baraini and captured. Three men were killed. 5. It is rumoured that the Shaikh of Debai intends to visit Abu Dhabi and Baraimi within the next few days with the alleged object of patching matters up between Abu Dhabi and Baraimi and to arrange for the recovery of his camels. „ ^.

Sheikh of BARAMI wrote letters to those concerned and received following replies. Sheikh of Ahu DhaM - disclaimed responsibility of MONASIRS action. Sheikh of Debai - was Trilling to pay compensation if it could be proved that men were BENI YAS. 3. Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah wrote letters to all parties sugcesting peace, and asked the Sheikh of Abu Bhabi to guarantee to restrain the M0NASIR8 from future raids. 4. ISA asked the Sheikh of Debai to use his influence but the latter said it was imposaible unless the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi guaranteed to control the action of the MONASIRS. 5. Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah sent all the replies to his letters to Sheikh of BARAMI, and when the latter found that they would not guarantee peace - he took action on 5th June and attacked AIN DHAWAHIR belonging to Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. There were heavy losses on both sides but the fort was not captured, 6. On 1st June the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi with 1,000 rifles left in pursuit of the raiders, to punish them. He stopped after 30 miles and camped by a well, and sent messengers to jthe Sheikh of Debai to join him, 7. On 14th June a caravan of food for Abu Dhabifs men was captured by a raiding party of BARAMI. 8. On 18th June another caravan of food going from Debai to revictual the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi^s force, was also captured by the BARAMI, Sheikh of Debai sent 3 men of BENI YAS tribe with this caravan, but as they refused to surrender one was killed and two woun'ed. 9. Sheikh of Debai liaving been reluctant to help the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi with a fighting force, became angered and left Debai on 21st June with 700 rifles to hold a conference with Sheikh of BARAMI at a place between AIN J DHAWAHIR and BARAMI, 10. This conference will probably not be concluded before 5th July, and future events depend on the result. 11. If the Sheikhs of Debai and Abu Dhabi combine against the BARAMI, it is rumoured that the Sheikhs of AJMAN, SHARJAH and RAS-AL-KHAIMAH will join with the BARAMI, 12, It is also, The Chronological Order of Events of The General Situation on the Trucial Coast,Pace 2. hi 13.

CAPTAIN, SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER PERSIAN GULP.Iti H.M.S.'HASTINGS' at Sbarjab, 28th June,1931. Sir, In continuance of 'PBNZANCEftS,' suaunary ot events on Trucial Coast lor period May to 23rd June, the following farther information concerning tbe BARAim troubles was supplied Be (mainly by the Resident Agent Shhrjah) on 28th June. 2. Sympathies in the BARABCE * ABU DHABI - DEBAI 'Centre Temps' are divided as follows;- ' Sheikh of Raraimi is a cousin of Sheikh AJman and alsp a distant relative of Sheikhs of Sharjah and Ras-al-Ehalmah. In addition, were a general conflagration to develop*, the Sheikhs would line up according to theirjTribal Division of GflAFRI versus HINAWIN. The former division consists of Sheikh Baralmt and all the JOVASmi Sheikhs. Ras-al-Khaimah. Um-al-Qwain, Sharjah and AJman. While the HINAWIN includes Debai and Abu Dhabi. It is known that Raraimi has already been receiving supplies of ammunition and food from his Jowasimi sympathisers. 3. Abu Dhabi's only possible ally,Debai,is apparently anxious to maintain the Peace, and, not only has he brought about tbe conference now meeting between AIN DHAWAHIR and BARAIMI town, but he has been instrumental in arranging a 15 day Truce, from 23rd June, to 8th July, to tide over the period of tbe negotiations. Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, appears to be set on War as tbe Baraimis in the course of their raids have cut down Date groves and spoiled good streams in tbe Ain Dhawahir district. It was reported in Debai on 27th June, that Sheikh Sa-eed, on his way to the conference, had received a letter from Sheikh Shakbat of Aba Dhabi saying:- 'If you come to arrange Peace you may as well return home, bat if you come to assist me in War I am very grateful'. 4. General opinion has it that Sheikh Abu Dhabi, if unsupported, would probably be crushed by Baraimi as this latter can always oount on a strong Bedawin contingent and could probably muster well over 30P9 Warriors. It is reported that Abu Dbabi set forth with 500 fighting men but hoped to raise this number to nearly 2000. Sheikh of Debai, accompanied by his 2 brothers, set out on his Peace mission with 300 men # If put to it hemignt be able to raise 1500 men. 5. Xt is believed The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, Copy to 'FOLKESTONE' &amp; 'PENZANCE'PAGE.2. 5, It is believed that the 15 day Truce will be observed. —' It hostilities are resumed at the end of that time the possibilities of the situation appear to be as follows:- (A) If Abu Dhabi/unsupported and alone, is defeated by Baraimi he (Abu Dhabi) will sue for peace well 1 ni aiy i and the victors will sit on their gains and are not likely to come through to the Coast. (B) If Debai openly and actively Joins with Abu ntetvi in hostilities against Baraimi, there is every probability of a general conflagration all along Trucial Oman and on the Coast — the 'GHAPRI versus HENAWIN' event. (C) If Abu Dhabi on his own were to defeat Raraimi there is a possibility that the War may spread to the Trucial Coast as Baraimi's Jowasimi sympathisers would join in and assist him. ~ Ajman actively .*-- but the other 3 shiekhs probably only by supplying food and ammunitions. 6. I am proposing to re-visit the Coast in about 9 days time to watch developements. 1 have the honour to be * 7 lour obedient servant 3 0JUN 1931 L ^ COMMANDER IN CWWAND The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division.

'TRXAD' , I 28th Juae, 1927. 3n«ian g0n&lt; ' Mo. 44* D» Sir, I have the hcmour to forward a report on the regult of tay visit to Shar ja ia accordance with your telegram of 15th June. 2. 'TRIAD' arrived at Sharja on the morning of 21st June. The-Residency Agent came on board and I received from him a report on the local situation. Hostilities were in progress between Sharja on the one hand and Umnnal-Kawain and Hamriya on the other, the latter two supported by the deposed Sheikh of Sharja, Khalid bin Ahmed and his brother Abdullah. 3. The cause of hostilities goes back some 3 years to the time when Khalid was deposed and his place taken by the present Sheikh» On that occasion an agreement was made between Sultan bin Suggur and Khalid that the former should respect all private property belonging to the latter in the Sheikhdom of Sharja. This agreement was soon afterwards broken by Sultan, who destroyed Khalid^ house and confiscated the remainder of his property. This state of affairs continued until March of this year, when the Sheikh of Umo-aL-Kawain under whose protection Khalid was living, wrote and complained to the Residency Agent and remonstrated with Sultan bin Suggur for having broken his promise. Sheikh Sultan however refused to move in the matter. Sheikhs Syed bin Maqtum (Debai), Sultan bin Salem (Ras-al-Khaima) and the Residency Agent made an attempt to persuade Sultan to give Khalid an alloz/ance so that he should no longer be a burden to Uiiuj&gt;-al~Kawain. To this end Ras'-al««Khaima recjuested Sultan bin Suggur to attend a 'Mejliss' to be held at Debai to discuss the matter. To this Sultan vouchsafed no reply and when asked by Residency Agent why he had not done so, said he neither trusted Ras-al« Khaima nor Umm--al-Kawain and moreover that being a poor man he was unable to help Khalid. Residency Agent then appealed to Syed bin Maqtum for assistance* Syeci agreed and he informed Residency Agent he was ready to help and to use force if necessary to make Sultan do his duty. These conversations took place during Ramadhan of this year and were in progress when Residency Agent was called to. Bushire .... The Honourable The Political Resident, BUSHIRE.// Ml Bushire in cormection with the proposed Arabian Coast air route. The Sheikh of Raa-al—Khaima also proceeded to Mecca about this time so the matter came to an end. These events led up to Khalid^ abortive attack on Sharja and the subsequent hostilities, in which the Beni Kitab tribe joined on account of the maltreatment of two of their tribe by Sheikh Sultan. When 'TRIAD' arrived hostilities had been going on for some 10 days and though not doing much harm (neither side had sustained any casualties) many complaints had been made . to Residency Agent by British subjects and others that their dhows could not leave for the pearl banks, the Sheikhs refusing their pe-rmission as they required the crews for warlike purposes. Mo breach of the Trucial Treaties had taken place. The Residency Agent informed me that both sides were anxious for peace but were unable to agree* 4. I therefore summoned the contending parties on board interviewing them separately and assisted by Sheikh Syed bin Maqtum of Debai (who had arrived at Sharja with the idea of helping a peace), drew up an agreementof peace. This was duly signed and witnessed on board 'TRIAD' in the presence of every Sheikh on the Trucial Coast except of Abu Dhabi and Ras—al—Khaima, on 24th June and is enclosed herev/ith. Copies in Arabic are being forwarded by the Residency Agent. The Sheikh of Sharja was given till 0800 on 26th June to comply with the terms. He had not then done so and Residency Agent informed me that there was some hitch in collecting the money, I therefore published an ultimatum to the effect that no dhow belonging to Sharja would be allowed to leave for the pearl banks until all the peace terms had been complied with. By my orders H.M.S # 'LUPIN' arrived at Sharja on the 25th June and both ships were then employed in enforcing the ultimatum. This had a most beneficial effect, especially when one dhow was brought up by a blank charge during the night of Sunday 26th June, and early on Monday 27th the money was paid in full. A permit was also given to Khalid to allow him to take possession of the date gardens at Dhet. 5. This matter having been brought to a satisfactory termination I then proceeded to go into further complaints by the Residency Agent that he was continually receiving threads against his personal safety, which emanated from persons residing in Sharja and particularly from Mahomed bin Suggur, the younger brother of the Sheikh. There was little doubt that these complaints were well founded and that living in Sharja was being made intolerable for him, I therefore summoned Sheikh Sultan and his brothers Mahomed and Majid as well as the notables of Sharja and in the presence of Sheikhs Syed and Juma bin Maqtum of Debai and the Residency Agent, warned them of 'the very serious consequences to themselves if these threats should continue or if harm shou ld...,/&gt; should coae to the Resideacy Ageat, his relations or his possessions in Sharja and that from now onwards they would be held personally responsible for his safety. The three Sheikhs then signed and sealed a pact to the above effect, which was also signed and sealed by the notables of Sharja as witnesses and by the Sheikh Syed bin Maqtum of Debai and myself. This document is in the possession of the Residency Agent by whom a copy will be forwarded. 6, The Residency Agent also reported that there were in Sharja two slave runaways from the Oman, where it is reported they had murdered their owner. These men are well known bad characters and ready to commit any crime for the sake of money and therefore a danger to the town. I demanded their surrender from the Sheikh, to which be agreed. Before however their arrest could be affected, both escaped from the town. Both Sultan and Debai have promised that should they attempt to return or enter Sharja or Debai they will be handed over to the Residency Agent for disposal as you think fit. Meanwhile Residency Agent is writing to all Sheikhs from Abu Dhabi as far as Kelba to inform them that these men are outlawed and that they are to be handed over if captured. 7. Sheikhs Syed and Juma bin Maqtum have been of great assistance to me throughout these negotiations and a letter of appreciation- from you would be most timely accompanied by a present to each, for Sheikh Syed a pair of binoculars suitable for sporting purposes and for Sheikh Juma an automatic revolver. Both of them were unflagging in their efforts to get matters satisfactorily settled. Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif the Residency Agent was of material assistance to me throughout and my interpreter Khan Sahib Mohamed bin Salem did exceptionally good work in interpreting.
