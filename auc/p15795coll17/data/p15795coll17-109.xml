Bartlett (1963-1969, acting 2002-2003), mother of two trustees, and had a staff position in AUC’s New York office.  She recollects how her husband Tom came to AUC as president, their relationship with faculty and staff, and the family’s experience of the 1967 War including her evacuation to Greece with her children. The development of the AUC campus is covered, from the purchase of what became the Greek campus, to the gift of the Bartlett fountain, and the salvage and installation of antique furniture and doors from a downtown villa slated for demolition. Molly Bartlett describes living in Cairo in the 1960s, including her Maadi neighborhood, the challenge of finding food items and supplies, social and recreational activities, and the upbringing and education of her sons. She also tells the story of President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s son borrowing, and crashing, her red sportscar.  Bartlett speaks about her husband’s role in recruiting Richard Pedersen to become AUC president in the late 1970s, and her own position in AUC’s New York office recruiting administrators in the next decade. The Bartletts’ return to AUC in 2002 and 2003 during Tom Bartlett’s term as acting president, stepping in for the ill John Gerhart, is discussed, and she tells of incidents from that period like the relocation of cats from the Tahrir Square campus. Her sons’ roles as Chairman of the Board of Trustees (Richard Bartlett) and Finance Committee Chairman (Paul Bartlett) are also mentioned.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
