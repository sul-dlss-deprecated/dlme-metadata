Vours faithfully. 'aptein, for Political Agent, Bahrain. A.On 21st December 1936, the Political Agent took the Assistant Political Agent to -mi on His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad. The call, as originally arranged should have been paid at the Qasr, as, however, repairs were being carried out to the Majlis, arrange ments were made for His Excellency to- receive the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent at Mr. Belgrave's Office. 2. Full Dress uniform and medals were worn. The Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent walked from the Agency to Mr. Belgrave's Office. 3. The Shaikh received the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent at the door of Mr. Belgrave f s Office then sat at the desk with the Political Agent on his right and the Assistant Political Agent on the left. Mr. Belgrave who was present sat on the Assistant Political Agent f s right. The call lasted about 1/4 hour and the usual courtesies were observed. On leaving the Shaikh shook hands on the threshold of the Office. I think it was intended that the Shaikh should receive the call in the Joint Court room, owing to lack of warning of the Political Agent's approach, however, the Shaikh had no time to get from Mr. Belgrave^ Office to the Court room before the Political Agent's arrival. In future a farrash might be instructed to give five minutes warning of the Political Agent's approach. 4. The return call was paid at the Agency on the same day about 1/4 of an hour later, the Shaikh was unattended. The Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent met His Ex-ellency at the head of the stairsstairs and accompanied him to the head of the stairs on his departure. The Political Agent took the opportunity to introduce the Assistant Political Agent's wife to the Shaikh.

The Oollector, Agra, United Provinces Might I ask you to help roe to get my leave account straightened up? as you know, the shortness of the notice at '/vhlch you allowed me to l^ave Bahrain did not give time for the necessary leave application to be formally made, and so at the moment I am neither under the A.G.C.R., nor the A.G.U.P. I have been trying to find out from the Rules just how much joining time I am allowed, but as the U.P. supplementary Utiles are apparently different from those of the Central Revalues, I have not been able to work it out, 1 have therefore sent in my leave application with one date blank; the other date is correct, as I took over in Agra on the fore-noon of January 4th. «ould you very kindly get tie office to calculate my joining time and fill in the blank datp. I left Bahrain on December 6th, and my joining time will be, I think, the time occupied by the journey, plus £ 10 days, plus joining time by rail from Karachi to Agra (this is one day per 250 miles under United Provin ces Rules): my leave will start on 1h e day after my joining time expires. If you would forward a Last Pay Certificate for me upto January 3rd, the a. G. C.

Tours sincerely, Sd. A.O. Galloway. Captain T.c, Farley., T.A., Tinder Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Simla.Tomlinson and I had discussed the question of re cess this year and in view of the fact that he is to take his Promotion Examination in October we had arranged that I would return from recess at the end of August and that he should then proceed to Karachi, This would have given him the whole of September and part of October to work fir the Exa ination. The local situation has prevented fhe first part of this plan being carried out and the second Dart has now had to be altered. I have now proposed that I proceed on recess until September 12th as it would not be worth Tomlinson»s while to go to Karachi for ten or fif teen days and then return to Bahrain to hand over to his relief. Jn order to hftln Tomlinson I would like to that, the Government of India be requested to post his re lief in the first week of September so that he could leave here in the 2nd week of September. 2. I wonder if the Government of India realise how very unsatisfactory this continual changing of Assistant f-oli- tical Agents is. No sooner does one get into the way of things then he is whisked away and new material is produced I would be well content for Tomlinson to remain here and have his training deferred until the beginning of next hot weather. I know Tomlinson is agreeable to this arrange ment and it has many advantages, the principal of which is that it would leave me free to do anything that may be necessary on account of oil developments without fear of disasters occurring in Bahrain in my absence which the Assistant Political Agent would not be competent to deal with.
