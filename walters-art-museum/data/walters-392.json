It was produced in India, perhaps Hyderabad. Mullah Du Piyazah, who features largely in folk verses and folk tales, was allegedly a jokester at the court of the third Mughal Emperor Akbar (949 AH/AD 1542-1014 AH/AD 1605). The witticisms of this character are directed at the Mughal elite, including Akbar himself. The painting is framed by a light green border with illuminated floral and fauna motifs.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/15995", "Keywords": "Indian; Islamic; Mughal; Illustration; Painting; India", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Mughal Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Indian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.701.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.701.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.701.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.701.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.701.a_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1503689, 1503948", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CPS_W.701.a_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
