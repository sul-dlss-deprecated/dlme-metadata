The Sheikh of Dubai, nephew of Sheikh Ahmad, wished to go Bandar Abbas to investigate the affair, but the British were keen to prevent his going. Sheikh Ahmad had apparently been detained and questioned about the identity of a murderer. The papers consist of telegrams between the Residency Agent, Sharjah; the Political Agent, Bahrain; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.The covering dates of the correspondence (the main body of papers in this file) are 6 July 1933-10 July 1933. The closing date in the overall date range is supplied by an entry in the notes at the rear of the file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Ahmad bin Obaid</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003c8#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
