Sir, ^ With reference to ray despatch No. 128 of April 4th I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of a Note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated April 13th replying to mine of April 4th relative to Ihn Mashhur. I enclose also a copy of a formal acknowledgment which I returned in the hope that it might end the correspondence. 2. The word , which my interpreter has translated T, proof’ T , appears to he used in various legal senses and perhaps carries with it in this connexion an implication of evidence of a definite claim or title. 3. Although the language of the Minister for Foreign Affair T s note is guarded, I think that the Ihn Mashhur Question may he regarded as having been disposed of hy Nuri Pasha's negotiations, provided that there is.no hitch over the delivery of the fugitive's suite and property 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty's High Commissioners for lra&lt;i and Trans-Jordan.

Your Excellency, I have received Your Excellency^ Note No.76 of 4.4.1921 (17.11.1249) concerning the question of Ibn Mashhur. I wish to assure Your Excellency that the proof we have against the British Government is the promise in accordance with which Ed-Dawish, Ibn Hithlain, Ibn lami and their Nejdi Bedouin followers were handed over. Ibn Mashhur was included, along with these people, in the promise given in respect of their tahing refuge in Ilowait, ’Iraq or Trans jordan. This is mentioned in the Notes the British Government addressed to our Government on many occasions. The case of Ibn Mashhur, however, after the progress achieved towards an understanding between us and the ’Ira&lt;i Government has become one which is in process of settlement and we hope that this will be accomplished as desired.

I am instructed to add the following statement on behalf of my Government, who consider that the question of Ibn Mashhur concerns Their Majesties the Kings of Hejaz- Nejd and Iraq alone :- The question of Ibn Mashhur was discussed by the two Kings at the Lupin conference precisely because it was a special case differing from that of the other rebels who had surrendered. The two Kings agreed as to the disposal of the case and any interest which has since been taken in it by His Majesty’s Government has b-en taken by them puiuly as a friend of both parties, anxious to assist the establish ment of good relations between them. In present circumstances however, His Majesty’s Government can only disinterest themselves in the matter and leave it for direct settlement with His Majesty King Faisal and the Iraqi Government.

My dear brother, After compliments, I have received, on my return to Mecca from Riyadh, my noble brother’s letter o t dated 24th Rajab, 1349 (14th December, 1931), I was glad to know that my brother is enjoy ing good health after his return from his journey during which he enjoyed the sight of His Majesty his father, I was also glad to know that (his) father’s health is progressing following the indisposition which he had felt. The tour I made during the last few days in Najd have, thanks to God, had a good effect on my health. The question to which my brother referred to in his letter, namely, the case of Farhan Ibn Mashhur, had been as you know, the subject of a long verbal conversation between us, and also thereafter the subject of several official coramunicetion s • several occasions I pointed out to my brother the ways of the Bedouins, so well-known to him, and how if they are handled firmly they could do no harm; while if they were given enough rope they could prove very vlacloust as most of them have no good faith. But for the hope entertained by evil doers that they will find shelter for themselves after their evil djing, no miscreant would be able to do any evil act. I was certain that on reaching Syria Ibn Iteshhur would fall to make good his promise to you to completeo ‘1 Kh cu* *J uffw 4 fi-A. Jtf lUU i to complete his Journey. It was on this account that our Ministry for Foreign Affairs would not agree to the proposal of the Prime Minister of your government that Ibn Mashhur should travel via Syria, as this would afford Ibn hashhur opportunity to run away while he is on his way. In spite of this your confidence in Ibn Ma&amp;hhur was so strong that he was permitted to travel through Syria, where facilities were afforded him through Nuri A1 Sha’lan encouraged him to remain and then to escape as we had feared he would do. In order to bring happiness to the hearts of the whole people, on my return from our meeting, I publicly announced the results of that meeting, including your promise to return Ibn Mashhur, I’Jhen the news of the escape of Ibn Mashhur became known, there was a general disappointment felt In oonnection with the expected elimination of causes of trouble making on the frontier• 3 yer since we received confirmation of the report of Ibn Mashhur’s escape we have been thinking out some means of putting on this affair an inter pretation acceptable to the people. Your warning to Hurl Ibn Sha’lan conoeming Ibn Mashhur has pleased us, and we hope that the warning will be effective on him. I appreciate your promise to place the relatives of Farhan an ^ . _ ml _ absolute disposal, but I dl his property under our no. * tw the relatives not. fully .mi.rrt ™ 1 *.t •«* , ,. rh „ if those «•«« ■■•* 0 “' -l J ' rOPOrtJ 01uBb together »» .ho ,»rr.h«r.l to s.pt.w ^ « if i s intended to han Mashhur at Busaiyah, ai • tbl .)( all, this will help a great deal towards solving this problem. If, on the other hand, by the 'relatives of I bn i'ashhur' are the 'qawa'id' ('sitting: ? non- combatants and slaves women, and children) among his relatives, this, as ay brother will see, will make matters worse, and I do not think that you will agr @3 that I should be so treated in reciprocation, I have no doubt that our brother will give us a definite promise that at any time Ibn Mashhur may fall into the hands of any •Iraqi authority he will be arrested end handed over to us* This is what I consider will help to mitigate the effect of the (undesirable) impression which Ibn Mashhur* s escape has mad© in the country, r fe trust that our brother will be helpful to us in this con nection. In conclusion I wish my brother and his noble ’Iraqi people all success, happiness, and prosperity, (Signed) * ABDUL * AZIZ AL SA’ITD,r /S7 '25} B (iff SBIW 3 : (, i . y , If J m-dmmwiiov l $ ^ I Q '::/' Code telegram to Sir Foreign Office, 30th March 1951, 6*45 p #m .

I put this down to two causes. The Xing himself had dl sal lows n. the first and most natural arrangements proposed. He did not want I bn Maahhur to return the way h@ had gone• 1.©. over the frontier. He had demurred to my own alternative suggestion that he should be shipped from Basra to Kfttif. He wanted Ihn ifashhur in Jedda and various suggestions were considered with this in view. The sec on-1 cause of the fiasco was that £ing Faisal had been over conf dent of his ability to gat the rebel ifely through Syria.

Baghdad, 12th December 1950 . Lord, X have the honour to refer to telegram 0 I dated the 22nd of November, 1950 , from His Majesty*s Consul-General, Beyrouth, to the Foreign Office, and connected correspondence on the subject of F&amp;rhan Ibn Mashhur, and to submit to Tour Lordship the following account of this unfortunate affair. 2. Farhan Ibn Mashhur, as Tour Lordship is aware, belongs to the Ruwallah tribe which passes the greater part of the year in Syria. In 1926, he quarrelled with Nuri al Sha*lan, Shaikh of tile Huwallah, and went over to Najd with his following where he became a Wahhabi. After committing various raids on Transjordan tribes he joined the rebel movement against icing Ibn Sa’ud. He was also implicated in a raid on ’Iraqi tribesmen in Najd territory. Subsequently when King Ibn Sa’ud took the field against the rebels a year ago, Ibn Mashhur entered ’Iraq territory and surrendered to the ’Iraq authorities. At that time it was the intention of the ’Iraq Government having settled their own account with him, to permit him to return to Syria on the ground foe Right Hon’ble Lord Passfield, P.C., Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, 3. *• !•ground that he was by origin a Syrian national. It became evident, however, that King Ibn Sa«ud regarded him as one of his own subjects; furthermore, Your Lordship stated in your telegram mo # 6 dated the 4 th of January, 1950* that Hi© Majesty*s Govern ment felt considerable doubts as to whether they could take their stand on his Syrian status and that in any case Ibn Mashhur*s previous association with the Syrian rebels made it impossible for him to return to Syria without the consent of the French authorities there• 5* There followed the Lupin Conference at which King Faisal promised King Ibn Sa*ud that he would do all in his power to persuade Ibn Mashhur to return to Bajd on the understanding that he would receive a free pardon from King Ibn Sa’ud. King Faisal after wards maintained that this promise did not in any way imply the forcible ejection of Ibn Mashhur from ’Iraq, but merely that he would make every effort to induce him to return of his own free will. $hen King Faisal approached Ibn Mashhur on the subject it became clear that the task of persuading him to return to mjd was going to be no easy one, as Ibn Mashhur has had the misfortune to contract blood feuds with most of the tribes in Arabia - a fact which makes him extremely nervous and suspicious. However King Faisal succeeded in persuading him, before he himself left for Europe, bo agree to return to .‘lajd if *ting Sa'ud would write him a personal letter «|f pardon. This letter was eventually written, and reached Baghdadpaghdad in the middle of August, while King Faisal was still away* After reference had been made to him by the Regent, King •Ali, Xbn llashhur was again approached, and at once raised difficulties as to the route by which he should travel* Direct return, or return via Transjordan involved risk to his life from his many enemies: he flatly refused to go by sea or air: the only alternative route seemed to be through Syria* Arrangements were accordingly made in September for him to travel by that route, but objections were raised from Jiddah, and the arrange ments were accordingly cancelled. 4. When I returned from London, I found that, while the continued delay in the departure of Ibn Mashhur was said to be poisoning the relations between •Iraq and Najd, King Faisal himself was anxious to despatch him and pressed for his return via Syria. He pledged his word that Ibn Mashhur would reach his destination if allowed to travel via Syria, provided that the French authorities did not attempt to interfere with him, and on this point he asked for the assistance of His iiajesty^e Oovernment. In these circusistances X reconictended in ray teiegram dated the 21st of October, that whatever risk uhere night be of Ibn shhur escaping en route should be faced, and that the French authorities should be approached as regards his journey through Syria. Your Lordship accepted this suggestion with consider able reluctance, and uttered a warning regarding the danger of Ibn Hashhur escaping in Syria, of iduch I fully recognised the force. At the same time I never anticipatedanticipated that the French authorities would actually detain him, the French Charge d*Affaires here having assured me without hesitation that he would be allowed to pass freely through Syria. 5# Whether Ibn Mashhur has, in fact, submitted to Nuri ibn Sha’lan with the connivance of the French authorities, as Captain Glubb has reported, or whether the French authorities are detaining him as a hostage for Sultan al Atrash, as King Faisal tells me has been openly stated in the Syrian press, it is, I fear, sufficiently clear that the risk contemplated in my telegram No.491 has materialized. I do not myself suspect King Faisal*s bona-fides in the matter, and I understand from him that he lias no doubts as to his ability to convince King Ibn Sa*ud that he is not to blame. If he is correct in this, the effect of this troublesome episode may not be so serious as might at first appear. It is not the person of this unimportant and disreputable young Bedouin chieftain, but the good faith of King Faisal and the maintenance of cordial relations between the two Kings which really matter. 6.

                           Lupinin February 1930 (the Lupin Conference) the King of Iraq (Faisal I) had given an assurance to the King of Hejaz and Najd (ibn Saud) that Farhan bin Mashur would return to ibn Saud via Syria subject to a pardon. However, ibn Mashur was allegedly abducted on the way through Syria and this was seen as a broach of Faisal's guarantee to Ibn Saud.The King of Iraq offered to hand over Ibn Mashur's family and property to the King of Hejaz and Najd as a gesture of good faith, a measure which was accepted by Ibn Saud.The discussion in the volume between British officials concerns the practicalities of the case and the need to maintain cordial relations between the two monarchs. It also discusses the agreements at the Lupin conference and implications for British action in this matter.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Secretary to the High Commissioner for Iraq (R S M Sturges); the Private Secretary to the King of Iraq, Baghdad (Abdullah Beg al Haj); the King of Iraq, (Faisal bin Hussein); the High Commissioner for Iraq (F H Humphrys); the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Sidney James Webb, Lord Passfield); the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonial Office; the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Government of Hejaz and Najd; HBM Minister, Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan); and the King of Hejaz and Najd (ibn Saud).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Private Secretary to the King of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Monarchy</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Sultan of Najd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Syria</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Najd</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00010c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
