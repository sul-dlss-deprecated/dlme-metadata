Area 9 covers the region of central Kurdistan and is divided into chapters on history, population, political geography, physical geography, climate, communications, resources, tribes, aviation, and personalities. The volume also contains numerous maps of important Kurdish cities and towns, as well as two maps of Area 9. The content of the chapters is dominated by information meant to be useful to military units and therefore contains detailed statistics on the military preparedness of both native populations and Turkish forces in the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kurdistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Demographic statistics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indigenous populations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x000166#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
