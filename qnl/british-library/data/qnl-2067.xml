Sir , I have the honour to enclose copy of a letter No.6007 of 1iie 8th November (together with copy of enclosures) which I have received from the Kuwait Oil Company Ltd., and in which it is requested that if no objection is seen, the necessary permission may be granted for Mr.Boots, the Head of the Seismic Party now operating near Bahra, to detail one of his assistants to taKe the terrestrial magnetic observations as explained by him in his letter. 2. as will be seem from the Company's letter, I have advised Mr .Boots through the Company that as regards observations which he proposes carrying out at certain places in Iran, Iraq etc., the simplest course would be for him to approach the respective Governments for permission through the United States representatives. 3 .

Lear Sir, ^ yin time past our laboratory in Pittsburgh has received considerable data taken by the Lepartment of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution, Washingta P.C. In fact, the regional corrections we apply to the magnetic data taken here are derived from data obtained from this source. Naturally we like to reciprocate, in any way possible, with information that may be helpful to the Carne le Institution. For your information, the Carnegie Institution i s an organization which does a non-profit type of research and is subsidized by various philanthropiea The magnetic date referred to herein is of a type that is useful in various lines of work and particularly in navigation. The results of the Carnegie Institution are open to anyone. In 1909 and 1910, the Carnegie Institution took absolute measurements of the intensity of the magnetic field of the earth in this part of the world. At the same time they observed the orientation of the magnetic north with respect to the true north. From year to year, these elements change in a wey which has not been fully worked out. Various factors enter into the cause for this change, and until observations have been made for a number of years all over the world to observe the mode in which these changes take place, it is unlikely that the true cause and the nature of the changes will be found out. In these observations we propose to assist. The CarnegieI - 2 - u The Carnegie Institution is sending us a set of their equipment for observing the elements under question and a list of the stations they observed when they made their trip in 1909 and 1910. We propose to reobserve these stations in so far as it is practicable. Some of them are obviously out of the question. The data obtained would be published for the good of anyone who wishes to use it. The undertaking would be distinctly in the nature of a good will enterprise, but the information would be useful to any Company who might be doing geological work in this vicinity or to the navigators who use a magnetic compass in addition to the purely scientific advance in knowledge. Following is a list of the stations which were observed in 1909 and 1910: Bagdad, Shuster,Basra, koha imera, Kuwait, Bushire, Reshire, Madain saleh, Tehook, Linga, Bahr ain,Aden. In addition to the locations listed there is a station at Beirut which could be observed on our way out of the country, and I believe there is one at Rutbah. Of the stations listed, obviously kadain Saleh, Linga, Tebook and Aden are too far away to be observed. Of the remaining stations some are in Persia, some in Iraq, some in Syria and one in Bahrain. It will probably take some time to get permission, if at all, to observe the stations outside of Kuwait. You will probably want to take this question up soon with Captain de Gaury, the Political Agent at Kuwait, so that the actual observations of any stations may be made in our spare time without loss of actual working time to the party. This can be undoubtedly be worked in during slack periods. The first thing we should know is the difficulty of getting to any of the stations and what permission will have to be obtained. \ I am enclosing a copy of this letter for Col.Dickson.

Please refer to your letter of i’ebruary 17th, with respect to the questions therein the answers ere (a) 1 - Magnetometer at the department of Terrestial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington; Instrument Ho. 21. 1 - Jlarth Inductor from the same institution also Ho. &lt;£ 1 . 1 - Transit to determine position (possibly not ne cessary) • I believe that these are the saiae instruments that were used in the former observations. (b) One, possibly two (see below) (o) 6n the property of American Mission, 11.8 feet (3.6 mete’s) from north wall, 95.5 feet (29.1 meters) from bottom step of main entrance and midway betvfeen east and west walls; marked by brass screw in hardwood post 5 by 5 by 20 inches (13 by 13 by 51 Cm.) set flush with ground. The following true bearings determine the spot: base of flag -staff on large fortress (summer residence of Shaikh) about a mile (1.6 kilometers) distant, seen through main ^ate of mission grounds, 40° 18.9*; ri^it hand corner of servant’s quarters where the latter join the west wall of the property, 1 0 13.5*; northwest corner of mission hospital, 64° 51.7*. Possibly it will be desirable to make a second set of observations at a secondary station 78.3 feet (23.9 meters) from above desorioeu station and on a line from above described station to base of flagstaff on fortress. The station just described above was observed by one of the men from the dep’t. of Terr.Mag. of the Carnegie Institution on March 11, 1909 and possibly the environment of the location described has changed somewhatsomewhat sinca that data although l&gt;r. 0,^*G.iiylrea states that nothing has been changed, hr.Mylrea also states that the bardwooc post described above was destroyed by one of the servants of the mission shortly after it ?/as set out. It is neither our- intention nor aesire to make extensive observations , but the reobserve the magnitude and direction of the earth’s magnetic field at the same location exactly that was observed in liarch 11, 19 09, and to determine in what way and direction this field has varied. he observation is somewhat complex as the instrument Sent ut by the Carnegie Institution is relatively complex. The routine of the observation takes about three or fbur hours wi th a little luck. Thus if nothing goes wrong, as it well may do with a relatively complex and delicate instrument , one should be able to complete the observation in the course of one aay. The observation consists of the following steps: (1) Determination O:' true north (axis of earth’s rotation) by observation either of the pole star or the sun with a transit. (2) Determination of magnetic north (position of earths magnetic pole) so that deviation from true north can be determined. True north was determined in step (1). (3) Determination of magnetic dip; i.e., how far a magnetic needle deviates from the horizontal when it is free to * rotate in a vertical plane. (4) Determination of iiagnetic dip with an earth inductor compass (much as is used to determine direction on HA? and Imperial Airways’ planes) which is much more sensitive and accurate than the dip needle. (5) .Measurement of the strength of the earths magnetic field at the point of observation. Steps 2,3, and 4 determine uniquely the direction of the earth’s magnetic field; step b determines the straigth.CONFIDENT IAL To Tne Political Agent, Bahrain. Copy to Tne Political Agent, Kuwait.
