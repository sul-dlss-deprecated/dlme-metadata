Anderson requests clarification from Jones on his assertion that the slave trade to the Arab coast will not be eradicated while the Imam of Muscat’s dominions in Zanzibar remain an important source of slaves under sanction of a ‘Special Treaty with the British Government.’ Two enclosures follow Anderson’s letter:1. An opinion (no.39 of 1856) from the late Advocate General, W. Howard, dated 30 June 1856, reiterating the points of the additional engagement;2. Letter no.3975 of 1856 from Anderson to Rear Admiral Sir Henry Leeke, Commodore and Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy, dated 15 August 1856, relating to actions to be taken with regard to the Persian Naval Squadron, in relation to Jones’s recommendations, including improvements to coaling facilities for Government steamers at Bassadore; and general concern at the decaying condition of the naval station at Bassadore.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024066926.0x00004c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
