This film was made by the French filmmaker Gordian Troeller. It concerns different medical styles in Mrica. The argument is that medical appproaches that are indigenous to Mrica are better for the people, not least because the cost is less. The film was made in Gabon and Senegal. The Senegalese material includes a sequence on the man who is apparently the hero of the film, a psychologist named Collomb who has involved patients' families in the treatment. This is contrasted with high tech medicine and pharmacy. The opening sequences show a traditional healing setting in Gabon that is reminlscent of passages from John Janzen's THE QUEST FOR THERAPY IN LOWER ZAIRE (Berkeley, U. of California Press, 1978), except that the filmmaker seems blissfully ignorant of all this. Some of the Senegalese experiences in psychotherapy have also been written up. An example of radical chic, but also without deep background.</dc:description><dc:creator>Troeller, Gordian; Partant, Francois</dc:creator><dc:date>1976</dc:date><dc:type>Moving image</dc:type><dc:format>video/m4v</dc:format><dc:identifier>ANF-C-049</dc:identifier><dc:source>Ethnographic and Anthropological Films - Egypt and Beyond</dc:source><dc:language>French</dc:language><dc:coverage>Senegal</dc:coverage><dc:rights>This item is under copyright.</dc:rights><dc:identifier>http://cdm15795.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15795coll25/id/19</dc:identifier></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
