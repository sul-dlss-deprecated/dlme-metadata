It argues that the Karun River scheme should not be completely abandoned, and that the transhipment of goods could bypass the natural obstruction to steam vessels at Ahwaz [Ahvāz]. It also includes some discussion of some of the overland routes into Persia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Walter Baring</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Karun River</geographic></subject><subject><topic>River navigation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000073#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
