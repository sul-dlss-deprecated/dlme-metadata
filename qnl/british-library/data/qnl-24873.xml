The Indian official oora unique announcing the arrival of the DELHI stated! f This visit ••• is perhaps going to be a unique event of its kind# Apart from the feet that the majority of the island's population is of Indian origin, a large section of the population of the colony look upon India as the champion of pe oe and freedom as well aa the symbol of their own aspiretions# It is therefore perhaps quite natural for all sections of the population to manifest enthusiasm on this historic occasion# ( Moreover, in 1948 the Inoian Government appointed a Com. issioner to Mauritius for the first ti *. Strictly speaking, his terms of office limited his activities to 'cultural* work and to the supervision of the interests of Indian visitors as distinct from Indian inhabitants, but in fact he has had much success in making the Indian population eonsoious of their ties with India and in keeping Mauritius in the news in India itself# It is to be hoped that thess signs of India's interest in Mauritius do not involve anything more than the friendly concern the Indian Government has a reasonable ri^it to feel in the future of the island# Mauritius was seded to Britain from J^ranee by the Treaty of Paris in 1814* There are no indigenous inhabitants in the island and the first settlers were undoubtedly I'rcnoh.

On the surface he is well mannered, pleasant and suave, but underneath everyone has a pretty good idea that he is fomenting trouble. The Communist Councillor (Rozemont) and many other extremists are known to be in his pocket and he is using them for his own ends. 5* ihe visit of u he DELHI has increased Indian nationalism and a certain amount of truculence. 6. There is also a certain Indian Youths organisation run on the Boy Scout model. The boys wear the Indian fore and aft white hat and have poles. I have been infonnec by certain Frenchmen that their organisations are drilling in the Flacq area using shields and truncheons (similar to the Police Force) and that they have anti-tear gas equipment. I have informed the Staff Officer of the Mauritius Police and he states that this is probably true and that up to last year this movement was 3*500 strong and growing daily. 7. The future outlook is still more dangerous as a general strike of the labour used on the sugar plantations ’nas been called for during the height of the cutting season (about August). The police are certain this will occur and are equally certain that this is a political try out of strength, so that Mr. Dev can see what forces he has at his call when the time comes to take over Mauritius as an Indian colony. 8. Under the new Constitution the present Government is very weak with a large number of extremist Councillors in the majority who shout the usual slogans and are generally obstructive. Nearly all are Indian or coloured gentry. 9* The Local Press is equally left and makes the most scathing statements about Government officials which are completely without foundation, but which cause the usual unrest and discontent, especially as Government servants cannot answer bade iii^ the Press. As the French element put it, 'They are only there to be shot at.' 10* Lost thinking people in this Island are sure that things must come to a head very soon and the sooner the better. (Sgd.) J.E.M.

'Delhi*' and 'Tir', you may be interested to receive a copy of a letter from Mullins, the Provincial Commissioner at Mombasa, in which he gives an account of the visit. I think you will agree that this visit, the first of its kind, went off extremely well, and that all those who were responsible for the arrangements are to be congratulated on their success. It was a relief to learn that there had been no awkward incidents over clubs or hotels. fhe speech to which Mullins refers was one in which Commodore Brown developed the theme that the R.I.N. should take an increasing share of responsibility in protecting trade routes so as to release the Royal Navy for duties elsewhere. The speech was not very accurately reported. I enclose as an example the East African Standard's effort. Mullins’ general remarks about the ship's company apply equally well to the visit of 12 officers and 180 ratings to Nairobi. In particular the behaviour and turn out of the ratings was excellent. There was a sundowner party at Government House for the officers, and there were numerous functions organised by the Indian community. t&gt; *7 i)A , 'III /L *-&lt;***—C A.B.COHEN ESQ., C.M.G., O.B.E., COLONIAL OFFICE, LONDON, S.W.l.

Ref.Your No.S/U.CER.24/1 A/48 of 20th June. I have not answered your letter before as I have been putting out feelers since the visit. Personally I think the visit went very well and so far I have heard no criticisms. There were some amongst the European community who were not keen on the visit but they unostentatiously kept out of the way so there were no uncomfortable incidents. 2. We found the officers pleasant and intelligent,some of them were slightly pleased with themselves but that is understandable. To us they were fairly outspoken in their opinions of their compatriots here and made it very plain that they preferred personal contacts with Europeans to parties given by the Indians. This was slightly embarrassing at times but only in conversation. At the big reception at Government House on the first night it was noticeable that they spent their time getting drinks and talking to the Europeans - especially the women - and it was rather difficult to get them to mix with the Indians. They were keen to dance in a private house but this was not possible as the programme was so full. This was I think fortunate as it might have caused embarrassment but I understand they had several such parties in Dar-es-salaam, though all but one were I think given by the Karimjee family, 5. Several people including H.H.Robinson, R.S.Campbell and ourselves had them to private meals and found them very pleasant if somewhat ebullient. I have heard of no awkward incidents nor had Commodore Brown who lunched with us alone a few hours before they sailed. We discussed the visit very frankly and he had no criticisms. Both he and his officers got very bored with the endless Indian parties most of which they consider quite frightful. They normally invited officers and about 100 ratings and served warm doft drinks of horrid unknown varieties and very hot or very sweet Indian snacks. So far as I have been able to discover they received very little private hospitality from the Mombasa Indians. Commodore Brown remarked that the local Clubs had acted wisely in ignoring the visit by not offering hospitality and had not made the error of offering hospitality to himself and the European Officers which he would have had to refuse. As regards the specific points you mention (1) Commodore Brown made an almost identical speech at a large lunch given by Pant here. Both it and the Dar-es-salaam speech were reported inaccurately in the local Indian Press and distorted to suit themselves. This distressed him very much and he wanted to write and correct.it. I advised him not to as they would certainly have made further comment and distortions and probably made matters worse. I have had no adverse comment on the speeches and personally I thought the speech here rather good. Two points he emphasised which are not sufficiently brought out in the reports: that all • kiL../1, all members of the Comnonwealth must take their share in preserving peace and that in war an essential part of the duties of the Navy was the protection of trade routes which should be the duty of the R.I.N. in these parts so as to release the R.N. for duties elsewhere. There were no awkward incidents over hotels or clubs as far as I know or have heard. There is a sidelight on this though. I am told that the Daily Express published an article saying that the Mombasa Club refused to allow them in (I have not seen it) and added some acid comment. In point of fact that Club was never asked because it was thought best not to create an awkward situation. From what I hear it is not impossible that if they had been approached the Club might have agreed. The local correspondent of the Daily Express has sent a heated denial of the offending article. 5. You ask for suggestions for future occasions of a similar kind. That is rather a difficult question to answer. Thinking it over I really think what we dia this time is as good a solution as any. I would say that the two most important things are to give a big official reception on oorea witn only visiting ports. I think too that it is as well to keep them very fully occupied. Fortunately this arranges itself because outside official functions the local Indian will arrange so many parties that we need not worry. Personally I feel that this is unkind to the R.I.N. but it does give us the buffer which will stop any awkward incidents. I think that personal contacts and entertainment with the officers will be spontaneous. b. One is always prone to be slightly apprehensive of the unknown and India's recent actions and our dealings with the local variety did I think worry us. In the event we found a crowd of officers and men, most of whom were wearing ribbons, with a very definite R.N. tradition. Many of them had been trained in and had served in the R.N. and it certainly seemed to me that this meant more to them than fraternising with their own kind in East Africa. I should like to emphasise a remark I made J.n a personal letter to His Excellency - that the behaviour and appearance of the Ratings was always exemplary. 7. • I trust that you will show this letter to Rankine as he originally wrote to Davies and me but the d.o. corresponsenee nas been with you since. In conclusion I would like to say that the visit has been a success and that it has been due almost entirely to the efforts of Davies, R.S.Campbell and Commander Codrington Ball. I hope that the Government will send a letter of appreciation to the last two for quite frankly it was the Europeans who were responsible for the success of the visit of tne R.I.N. and not Lhe Indians with whom I had continual petty squabbles which are not worth mentioning.

Defence of the Common wealth, he said, must be shared by all its members. He voiced his confidence that “the new India has a tremendous future! end a future, I am equally confident, that is directed for the good of the world as a whole.” Change ahead ? Speaking of the expansion of the Indian Navy, Commodore Brown said it was important that the country should make a contribution to Commonwealth defence that was in proportion with its size and im portance. “As the Royal Indian Navy increases in strength, so the activities of the Royal Navy in this part of the world will decrease. “I feel certain that the time will come when what we know as the East Indies squadron of the Royal Navy will cease to exist as such because its functions will have been taken over by the 'Royal Indian Navy.

Aden of the H.M.I.S “Delhi” and ”Tir”, you may care to have this brief account of how the visit went off. . They arrived on the 2?th June and left on the 2nd July. I had previously sent a short signal of welcome to the Commodore on board the “Delhi” and a detailed programme for their stay was drawn up by the Resident Naval Officer in consultation with the Secretariat, other Services and interested local Associations. The visit included a formal exchange of calls between the Commodore on the one side and my self and the Air Officer Commanding on the other; a Government House dinner, a dinner at the Air Officer Commanding's residence and a dinner and a cocktail party on board the 'Delhi”. At all these functions there was a good mix up between the Indian Officers, British-civil and Service representatives, prominent Indian unofficials and to some extent of Arabs. Apart from these official social engagements a programme of sports fixtures with local teams was arranged. The Indian Officers were made Honorary members of the Clubs and the ratings were given facilities to use the United Services Club for British other ranks. The visit ended with an exchange of goodwill messages between myself and the Commodore. It was a pity that the visit had to come in the middle of our hot and sticky season and more particularly that it coincided with the start of Ramadhan which puts a stopper on most activities in this predominently Muslim Colony. We also had a nice dust storm on the last evening /immediately A.B.Cohen Esq., C.M.G., O.B.E., Colonial Office, LONDON.copy &lt;S*'C 16959/88 PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL THE ^ECFETARIAT, - DAR-ES-Salaam. 23rd June, 1949 My dear Cohen, Will you please refer to your personal and confidential letter No, 46503/217/49 of the 4th April, regarding the visit of the Royal Indian Naval Squadron here, I am afraid it was not possible to give a reply before the start of the cruise, and so it seemed best to wait until after the visit was over to let you know how it went off. The social reception of the officer^&amp;nd men in clutB,etc, was everything that could be desired with, I am sorry to say, the sole exception of the Dar es Salaam Club, Here, despite exhortations from Hutt and myself and from senior cormniteemen and officers of the Club, both official and unofficial, a small majority of the Committee remained adamant in their refusal to extend the privilege of honorary membership to the Indian officers Commodore Brown had been made aware of this while the Squadron [ was lying at Zanzibar, and I discussed it with him myself on two or three occasions, I think he and his officers, whom he had, of course, informed of the situation, appreciated the difficulty in which we found ourselves, and there was no suggestion of any incident or ill-feeling arising out of the matter. The officers were entertained at the Gymkhana Club, at many Indian clubs, and at Government House, and were made honorary members of the K.A. R. Mess: I can only hope that the Dar es Salaam Club having seen the type of men they were, will be less prejudiced on the occasion of a future visit. In our opinion the visit was a great success: the ships 1 officers and men were very popular with all communities and the behaviour of the ratings on shore was admirable, I attach a copy of a letter from Commodore Brown, written at the close of the visit, which I have reason to think expresses more than formal appreciation of what we were able to do for them, A leading part in the arrangement of sporting and social fixtures, which included matches against all communities and social fixtures involving all races, was taken by a Committee of the Indian Association appointed for the purpose. You may also be interested to see the attached note on the visit which was supplied by the Special Branch in Dar es Salaam after the Squadron had left for Mombasa, I may add that Commodore Brown more than upheld the very high traditions of the Royal Navy and that his officers and men clearly thought the world of him. He really was ^oing a magnificent job of work, both for India and for the Navy, I do not know whether it would be proper for you to pass this on to the Admiralty, Yours ever. DEPT, I (sgd) R.

GIBSON, BS« I enclose a copy of a letter .vhich Cohen has received from Locicer in Delhi about a forthcoming visit of two Royal Indian Navy ships to the hast African ports, Seychelles , Mauritius and Aden, You will see from the enclosed letter to Mitchell in Kenya what action has been taken: similar letters have gone off to the other „ast African Governors, and to the Governors of Mauritius, Seychelles and % Aden. Meanwhile, we have been asked by the Governor of Seychelles whether he should send a signal direct to the C.in C, Royal Indian Navy welcoming the visit: the usual practice in the case of visits of ships of the Royal Navy, as you know, is for the Governors to ascertain the wishes of the Commander regarding matches, picnics, official functions and hospitality etc,, some weeks before the xjrojected visit. We feel however, that before giving a definite reply to Seychelles we should await the reactions of the other Governors on the matter: the request in Locker’s letter presents rather a tricky problems especially for Kenya and Zanzibar, and it may be that the best compromise will be to regard the visit as semi-official rather than as a fullblown 'showing the flag” expedition. Perhaps you would let us know what you think.46503/217/49 PERSONAL &amp; wmmrrKL ' Colonial Office, Church House, Or eat Smith Street, London, S.W. 1* 4th April, 1949* I have recently heard from the United l^pgdon Hijh Commissioner in India that two ships of the Royal Indian Navy, H.M.I.S. Delhi and H.M.I.S. Tir, will be leaving Bombay on the 2nd May and will be calling at the Seychelles, Mauritius, the East African ports and Aden In accordance with the attached timetable* I understand that the Commander in Chief, Royal Indian Navy, feels some concern about the reception which may be accorded to the Indian officers of the ships at the various ports of call* As you know, the practice in the past when a ship of the Royal Navy has visited any of these ports has been for the officers to be made honorary members of the various clubs* If officers of the Royal Indian Navy receive different treatment, there may well be very unfortunate reper cussions In India* I realise the delicacy of this question and 1 know also that the answer to it is not entirely in your hands, but I do feel that it is very important that we should show every courtesy to the Indian ships* j sincerely hope that you will see your way to doing all you can to make It possible for the visiting Indian personnel to be accorded the same treatment as has been given hitherto to men of the Royal Navy. perhaps you would let me have a line about this so that I can write to Delhi if possible before the cruise begins* SIR PHILIP MITCHELL, G.C.M.G., M.C. /immm — * -■'* OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM f&gt;, Albuquerque Road.

TIR) are shortly proceeding on a cruise and will be calling at the Seychelles, Mauritius and the East African ports in accordance v/ith the attached pro Li'anune. The Commander-in-Chief, Royal Indian Navy, feels some concern-as to the treatment which may be accorded to the Indian officers of these ships at the above-mentioned ports In particular he is anxious in regard to the question of their admission to Clubs; apparently the practice, when a ship of the Royal Navy has visited any of these ports, has been that the officers were made honorary members of the various clubs, and if by any chance officers of the Royal Indian Navy were to receive different treatment on this occasion there would certainly be very unpleasant repercussions in India, particularly as the South African affair looms large In people's minds here at present• My High Commissioner appreciates the delicacy of the matter, and has therefore felt that the best approach would be through you on a semi-official basis. perhaps you could see your way to let the Governments concerned know of the problem and ask them whether it would be possible for personnel of the Royal Indian Navy to be accorded the same treatment in all respects as has been riven hitherto to men of the Royal Navy?
