The request is made in the context of reported instances of smuggling by personnel from British ships. The Political Agent and Consul at Muscat responds to the request with a list of various goods imported into Muscat, ranging from cereals to medicines, along with their respective customs tariffs. The Political Agent is also asked by the Political Residency to confirm whether any restrictions are placed on the import or export of gold in Muscat, and his response is that an import duty of 17.5% is charged on gold bars only.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000386#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000386#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
