Incessantly engaged in sharing with his brave troops their fatigues, and showing by his personal example at the head of his Troops the value of enduring privations with patience, it has been impossible for His Exce- lency the Commander-in-Chief, in the midst of so many occupations, to furnish to the Governor-Genera 1 a d«- f tailed report of these brilliant successes.( 92 ) The GoTernor General, lioweTer cannot refrain from notifying to the Hon ble the 'tha^'thls noti- Army and to ,l,e people if India, these results so honorable to the Br.Ush Arms : and he ficat .un be carefully made known to all the Troops by PJ r Guns be fired from this Fort of departments of the Government, ClTll and M.l.tary, and that a sa ute of 21 Guns M j ha|1 b Ferozepoot, this day at 1 o'clock, and at every principal station of the Army as soon as These grateful and heartfelt acknowledgments to the Army for it's ^ r ™ es ^ aid'b4 remembering that our thanks are doe to Him who is the only Giver 01 all victory, battle is not to the strong.

CURRIE, Secy to the Govt, of India, with the Govr. Genl, (Copy.) From His Excellency the Commander in Chief to the Right Honble the Governor General of India, Dated Head Quarters, Army of the Sut/ej, Camp Moodkee, 19/A December, 1845 Right Hoy ble Sir, t J . .u iV su P 5rfl, '° u 1 s form to KltlrMs to you a narrative of the Campaign which ha, opened a^amst the bikhs, and the snccessfnl action ofyesterday, since you have in person shared the fati'ue» and dangers of our Army and witnessed us efforts and privations ; but that ray position at its head renders this' Z duty and « necessary Iron, thai position I should place these events on record, for the inforraation of all Eurooe as well as ot all India. l Yon Sir, know hut other, have to be told, that the sudden and unprovoked aggression of the Sikhs, bv -rossin- the Sutlege, with the great proportion of their Array, with th&lt;?avowed intention of attacking l-Vozepo^n Time ofprojonnd peaee, rendered mdispensable on our side a series of difficult combinations for 'the protection of oT.r Frontier Station so unjustifiably and so unexpectedly menaced. H '«^uon or our From the advanced and salient situation of Ferozepore, and its vicinity to the Sikh Capital its defence against a sudden attack, became a difficult operation. It was always possible for the Sikh Government to throw a formid able force upon it, before one sufficiently numerous could, on our side, be collected to support it Hut when unon the 11th instant it became known at Umballa, where I had established my Head Quarters, that this invasion had actually taken place, the efforts to repel it followed each other in rapid succession; notwithstanding I had the fullest confidence in Vlajor Genl. Sir John Littler, Commanding at Ferozepore, and in the devotedness and eallmt ry of the Troops occupying it. &amp; '''t- The Troops from the different Stations in the Sirhind Division were directed to move, by forced marches noon Busseean, where, by a most judicious arrangement, you had directed supplies to be collected, within a womWnllv short space of time. v The main portion of the Force at Loodianah was withdrawn, and a Garrison thrown into the little Fortress there From this central position already alluded to, both Loodianah and Ferozepore could be supnorted and the * r.f of both places might be considered to be brought, in some measure, within the scope of the contingencies of i lr&gt;n/ ral action to be fought for their relief, 0 ' o e ' All this is soon related ; hut most harassing have been the marches of the Trooos in comnlptincr M,;. tion When their march had been further prolonged to this place, they had moved over a distance of unward /of one hundred and fifty miles in six days, along roads ofheavy sand : their perpetual labour allowin- them scar^U time to cook their food, even when they received it, and hardly an hour for repose, before they were%alled ' f renewed exfirt ions. ' 1 P on ' or When our leading Corps reached Wudnee, a small Jagheer of the late Maharaja Shere Sing, its Garrison shut the gates of the Fort against them ; and as our Battering Guns were far in the rear, it was determined to reserve it for future chastisement, and we remained content with compelling the village to furnish supplies it could however provide little, except for our overworked Cattle, under pain of enduring a cannonade and assault: this it did witS out the necessity of firing a shot. When we reached Wudnee, it was evident that the force before Ferozepore felt the influence of our movement as we heard that a very largje portion of that force had been detached to oppose our further advance ; their U elint-' parties retired on the morning of the 18th before our Cavalry Picquets, near the Village and Fort of Moodkee Soon after mid-day, the Division under Major Genl. Sir Harry Smith, a Brigade of that under Maior Gen^r I Sir John McCaskill, and another of that under Vlajor Genl. Gilbert, with 5 Troops of Horse Artillery and tw Light Field Batteries, under Lieut. Col. Brooke, of the Horse Artillery (Brigadier in Command of the ArtilWv Force) and the Cavalry Division, consisting of Her Majesty's 3d Light Dragoons, the Body Guard 4th and Zl Light Cavalry, and the 9th Irregular Cavalry, took up their encamping ground in front of Moodkee. ' The Troops were in a state of great exhaustion, principally from the want of water which was not procurablp the road, when, about 3 p. m,, information was received that the Sikh Army was advancing ; and the Troon- I I scarcely time to get under arma and move to their positions, when the fact was ascertained!( '28 ) I immediately pushed forward the Horse Artillery and Cavalry, directing the Infantry, accompaui rd bv the . 'eld Batteries, to move forward iu support. We had not proceeded beyond two miles when we found the enemy in position. They were said to consist of from fifteen to twenty thousand Infantry, about the same force of Ca- vahy, and forty Guns. Ihey evidently had cither just taken up this position or were advancin r , in order of battle against us. ™!V eS n 1 th u ,r at j ta L k ' and t0 CO y t er the formation of th e Infantry, I advanced the Cavalry under Brigadier# ^ 'if.' C r 0 u gh, ^\ Mactier rapidly to the front, in Colums of Squadrons, and occupied the plain. They were speedily followed by the five Troops of Horse Artillery, under Brigadier Brooke, who took up a forward posi tion having the Cavalry then on his flanks. 0 ' i i The country is a dead flat, covered at short intervals, with alow but, in some places, thick Jhow jungle, and dotted with sandy hillocks. The Enemy screened their Infantry and Artillery behind this jungle, and audi undu- p ations as the ground afforded; and, whilst our twelve Battlions formed, from Echellons of Brigades, into line, opened a very severe cannonade upon our advancing Troops, which was vigorously replied to by the Battery of lorse Artillery, under Brigadier Brooke which was soon joined by the two Light Field Batteries. I he rapid and well directed fire of our Artillery appeared soon to paralyse that of the Enemv ; and as it was necessary to comp etc our nfantry dispositions without advancing the Artillery too near to the jungle, I directed ie -ava i v, urn ei &gt;riga |e 's Vliite and Gough, to make a flank movement on the Enemy's left with a view of threatening and turning that flank, if possible. With praiseworthy gallantry, the 3rd Light Dragroons with the 2nd Brigade of Cavalry consisting of the Body Guard and 5th Light Cavalr'y, with a portion of the 4th Lancers, turned the left of the Sikh Army, and sweepiug along the whole rear of its Infantry and Guns, silenced, for a nm., le a er an put t leu numerous Cavalry to flight. Whilst this movement was taking place on the Enemy s left, I directed the remainder of the 4th Lancers, the 9th Irregular Cavalry, under Brigadier Mactier, vu i a Lig it I ield Battery to threaten their right. This manoeuvre was also successful. Had not the Infantry am • uns o t u .netiu icen screened by the jungle, these brilliant charges of the Cavalry would have been productive of greater effect. : When the Infantry advanced to the attack Brigadier Brooke rapidly pushed on his Horse Artillery close to the jungle, and the cannonade was resumed on both sides. The Infantry, under Major Genls. Sir Harry Smith Gilbert and Sir Jolin McCaskill, attacked m Kchellon of lines the Enemy's Infantry, almost invisible amongst wood and the approaching darkness ot night. The opposition of the Enemy was such as might have been expected from roops who had every thing at stake, and who had long vaunted of being irresistible. Their ample and extended line fioin then great superiority of numbers far outflanked ours; but this was counteracted bv the flank move ments ol our Cavalry, 1 he attack ot the Infantry now commenced, and the roll of fire from this powerful arm smm convinced the Sikh Army that they had met with a foe they little expected; and their whole force was driven from position after position with great slaughter, and the loss of 17 piec s ot Artillev, some of them of heavy calibre. Our Infantry using that never failing weapon, the Bayonet, whenever the Enemy stood. Night only saved them from worse disaster, for this stout conflict was maintained during an hour and a half of dim star light amidst a cloud of dust from the sandy plains which yet more obscured every object. I regret to say, this gallant and successfull attack was attended with considerable loss. The force bivouackexL- upon the field foi some hours, and only returned to its encampment after ascertaining that it hid no Enemy before it, and that night prevented the possibility of regular advance in pursuit. I beg to congratulate you. Right Kon'ble Sir, on this first defeat of our Invaders by th'e Army I had the honor to command. The perseverance by which success was attained you personally witnessed; and' the Troops I am sure, felt proud of the sell-devotion with which their Governor General exposed himself to every danger amongst them. 1 before said that our loss has been severe; it could not be esteemed small if we had no other to record when I mention that, towards the conclusion of the affair. Major General Sir Robert Sale, to whom India and Luglaud are so much indebted, had his left thigh shattered by a grape shot, and that the wound has since proved moital, Sii John McCaskill, an old and valued Oiiicer, who has done his country much good service, received a ball through his chest on the advance of his Div ision and immediately expired'. Brigadiers Bolton and Mac- tier, and Lieut. Cols. Bunbury and Byrne, and other valuable Officers are amongst the wounded. These losses our country and the service will deplore, but not consider unvalling when Ferozepore shall be rescued from the Inva der, and the insult to our Territory and Rule fitly punished. I have every reason to be proud of, and gratified with the exertions of the whole of the Officers and Troops of this Army, on this arduous occasion ; with the conduct and dispositions of the Generals of Divisions; the Brigadiers of the several Arms ; the General, Personal, Divisional and Brigade Staff; and the Commanding Officers of Regiments. rtut this Dispatch is necessarily completed in the utmost haste, and in the midst of most important operations, 1 must therefore reserve to a future oportunity the pleasing task of bringing specially and by name to the notice o( Government, the particular merits of individual Oilicers. I cannot however retrain from expressing my deep sense of obligation to the Heads of the two principal Depart ments . Major General Sir James Lumley was unfortunate Iv prevented, by severe sickness, from taking pi-rt in the active duties of this great crisis; Major Grant, Deputy Adjutant General, therefore supplied his place, and it is my duty to say how ably this has been done, and how great a loss I have endured in being deprived, tor the pre sent, oi his services in consequence ot two wounds which he received whilst urging on the Infantry to the final and ■ . decisive attack ol the Enemy s Batteries. Neither must 1 fail to record the valuable aid which has upon this as on a former Campaign been afforded me by the Quarter Master General, Lieut. Col. Garden : his Departmental arrangements demand my highest commendation. Major General Sir Harry Smith having been appointed to the Com maud of a Division, the charge of his Office, as Adjutant General of Her Majesty's Forces, devolved upon Lieut. Col. Barr, who, not only in the performance of these duties, but in every way 'in which assistance can be rendered, in active operations, has been to me a most valuable Staff Oilicer. I have to thank you. Right Hon'ble Sir, for having placed at my disposal, the services of the Officers of your Staff, and to thank them for the valuable assistance they afforded me on this arduous day. It shall be my pleasing duty to mention them, individually, with the Officers of my own personal Staff, in the Recommendation List I shall have the honor of forwarding at an early date to Government.

After the combat of the 18th at VIoodkee, information was received the following day, that the Enemy, in tit i-ed numbers, were moving on to attack us, A line of defence was taken up in advance of our encampment, an. dispositions made to repel us all; but the day wore away without -their appearing, and at night we had the satis- laciion of bein - reinforced by li. M.'« '29ih Foot and the H, C.'s First European Light Infantry, with our small Division of heavy Guns. 1 must here allude to a circumstance most favorable to our efforts in the field. On this evening, in addition to the valuable counsel wiih which vou had, in every emergency before favored me, you were pleased yet further to Strengthen my hands by kindly offering your services as second in Command in my Army. I need hardly say with bow much pleasure the offer was accepted. On the morninf of the 21st, the offensive was resumed. Our columnt of all Arms debouched four miles on the lo^d to Fero-ishah, where it was known that the Enemv, posted in great force and with a most formidable Artil- lerv h id remained since the action of the 18th incessantly employed in entrenching his position. Instead of advanc ing to the dire, i attack of their formidable works our force manoeuvered to their right; the second and fourth Divi sions of Iiuantry in front, supported by the 1st Division and Cavalry in 2nd line, continued to defile for some time out of cannon shot between the Sikhs and Ferozepore. The desired effect was not long delayed. A cloud of dust was seen on oui left, and, according to the iastructlous sent him on the preceding evening. Major Genera! Sir John Littler with his Division, availing himself of the offered opportunity, was discovered in full march to unite his force with mine The junction was soon effected, and thus was accomplished one of the great objects of all our harrass- ioe marches and privations in the relief of this Division of our Army from the blockade ot the numerous forces by which it was surrounded. Dispositions were now made for an united attack on the Enemy's entrenched Camp. We found it to be a paral lelogram of about a mile in length and half a mile in breadth, including, within its urea, the strong village of Fe- lozeshah • the shorter sides looking towards the Sutlej and Moodkee, and the longer towards Ferozepore and the open country. We moved against the last named place, the ground in front of which was like the Sikh position at Moodkee, covered with low jungle. The Divisions of Major General Sir John Littler, Brigadier Wallace who had succeeded Major General Sir John McCaskil, and Major General Gilbert, deployed into line, having in the centre our whole f^rce of Artillery, with the exception of 3 troops of Horse Artillery, one on either flank and one in support, to be moved as occasion i tquired. Major General j'ir Harry Smith's Division, and our small Cavalry Force, moved iu second line, having a brigade in reserve to cover each wing. I should hore observe that I committed the charge and direction of the left wing to Lieutenant General Sir Henry Hardinge, while \ personally conducted the right. A verv heavy cannonade was opened by the Enemy, who had dispersed over their position upwards of one hun dred Guns more than forty of which were of battering calibre. These kept up a heavy and well directed fire, which the practice of our far less numerous Artillery of much lighter metal, checked, in some degree, but could not silence • finally, in the face of a storm of shot apd-shel^ our Infantry advanced and carried these formidable en- irenchments Thev threw themselves upon the Guns, and with matchless gallantry, wrested them iioin the Eae- n.v but when the Batteries were partially within our grasp, our Soldiery had to face such a fire of musketry from the\ikh Infantry arrayed behind their Guns, that in spite of the most heroic efforts, a portion only ot the entrench- , ment could be carried.' Night fell while the conflict was every where raging. Although 1 now brought up Major General Sir Harry Smith's Division, and he captured and long retained at ther point of the position, and U M .'s 31 Li-ht Dragoons charged and to )k some of the formidable Batteries. ' t the Enemy remained in possession of a considerable portion of the great quadrangle ; whilst our Troops, inter-'- ' e oh-d with theirs, kept possession of the remainder and finally bivouacked upon it. Kxhansted by their gallant dforts treatly reduced in numbers, and suffering extremely from thirst, yet animated by an indomitable spirit. In ihis state of ftings the long flight wore away. 'Neai the middle of it one of their heavy Guns was advanced and played with deadly effect upon our Troops, 1 tenant General Sir Henry Hardinge immediately formed H. M.'s 80th Foot and the First European Light In- v ' 'phev were led to th^ attack by their Commanding Officers, and, animated in their exertions by Lieut. rV' el Wood A D C. to the Lieutenant General) who was wounded on the outset- T he 80th captured the Gun, Ifhe FiicmV dismayed by this countercheck, did not venture to press on further. During the whole night how- r thev continued to haras? our Troops by fire of Artillery, wherever moon-light discovered our position. But with d iv-light of thfe 22d came retribution. Our Infantry formed line, supported on both flanks by Horse A t'llerv whilst a fire wasopened from our centre by such of our heavy Guns as remained effective, aided by a flight ! Rocket- A masked Balterv played with great effect upon this point, dismounting our pieces and blowing up wur Tumbrils. At this.moment'Lieutenant General Sir Henry Hardinge placed himself at the head of the left, whilst I rodt to the head, of the right ing. -[ 13t ] Our lime adranced unchecked by the Enemy's fire, drove them rapidly out of the Village of Fernzeshah n»d their encampment, then changing front to its left, on its centre our force continued to sweep the Camp, bearing down all opposition, and dislodged the Enemy from their whole position. The line then halted, as it on a day of manoeuvre, receiving its two Leaders as they rode along its front, with a gratifying cheer, and displaying the captured Standards of the Khalsa Army. We had taken upwards of 73 pieces of Cannon, and were masters of the whole field. The force assumed a position on the ground which it had won ; but even here its labors were not to cease. In the course of two hours, Sirdar Tej Sing, who had commanded in the great lost battle, brought up from the vici nity of Feroz.epore fiesh Battalions, and a large Field Artillery, supported by 30,000 Ghurehurras, hitherto en- - &gt;ed near the river. He drove in our Cavalry parties, and made strenuous efforts to regain the position at ' [ shah. This attempt was defeated ; but its failure had scarcely become manifest, when the Sirdar renewed — atest with more Troops and a large Artillery. He commenced by a combination against our left flank, and, this was frustrated, made such a demonstration against the captured Village, as compelled us to change our ■. d front to the right. His Guns, during this manoeuvre, maintained an incessant fire, whilst our Artillery .munition being completely expended in these protracted combats, we were unable to answer him with a single shot; I now directed our almost exhausted Cavalry to threaten both flanks at once, preparing the Infantry to ad vance in support, which apparently caused him suddenly to cease his fire and abandon the field. For 24 hours not a Sikh has appeared in our front. The remains of the Khalsa Army are said to be in full re treat across the Sutledge atNu^gur Puttun andTilla, or marchin? up its left bank towards Hurreekee Puttun in, the greatest confusion and dismay. Of their Chiefs, Bahadur Sing is killed, Lall Sing is said to be wounded Mahtab Sing, Adjudeeah Persaud, and Tej Sing, the late Governor of Peshawnr, have fled with precipitation. Their Camp is a scene of the most awful carnage ; and they have abandoned large stores of Grain,.Camp Equipage and Ammunition. Thus has apparently terminated this unprovoked and criminal invasion of the peaceful Pro?inces under British protection. On the conclusion of such a narrative as I have given, it is surely superfluous in me to say, that I am and shall be to the last moment of my existence, proud of the Army which I have the honor to command on the *ilst and 22nd instant. To their gallant exertions I owe the satisfaction of seeing such a Victory achieved, and the glory of having my own name associated with it. The loss of this Army has been heavy : how could a hope be formed that it should be otherwise ? within 30 hours this force stormed an entrenched &lt;.amp, fought a general action, and sustained two considerable combats with the enemy. Within four days it has dislodged from their positions on the left bank of the Suilege 60,000 Seikh Soldiers, supported by upwards of 150 pieces of Cannon, 108 of which the enemy acknowledged to have lost, and 91 of which are in our possession. In addition to our losses in the battle, the captured Camp was found to be every where protected by charged Mines, by the successive springing of which many brave Officers and iVIen have been destroyed. ^1 must bear testimony to the valour displayed in these actions by the whol e of the Repiments of H. M.'s Service employed and the H-C.'s 1st European Light Infantry. The,Native Force seconded in a mosl spirited manner their gallant conduct. To Lieutenant General Sir Henry Hardinge, my Second in Command, my warmest thanks are due, not only for his personal exertions, which were conspicuous to all, but for the able assistance which he afforded me through all the eventful scenes of this well-fought action. To the General and my Personal Staff I feel deeply indebted for their unceasinjr exertions. Major Generals Sir Harry Smith, Gilbert, and Sir John Littler, and Brigadier Wallace, (who nobly fell in the hour of Victory) fully realized the high expectations I had formed of their conduct as leaders of Divisions. With the Brigadiers, the Comm indant of Artillery, and the Chief Engineer, the Commanding Officers of Regiments, and with the Depart mental Staff, I was also greatly pleased. Their exertions were most unremitting and highly praiseworthy. The Reports I have received from the Generals of Divisions of Infantry, the Brigadiers of Cavalry, and the Com mandant of Artillery, speak in the highest terms of their respective Staff ; and it is my intention as soon as possible, to forward to you. Right Hon'bleSir, a list containing the names of all the Officers I have just enumerated, together .yith the names of all those who appear to me specially to merit approbation and favor. The hurried manner in which lam forced to collect information, and prepare these numerous details, may ^ar) cause the omission of the names of some Ollicers well deserving of notice ; but I shall not fail to send t Supplementary List, when I can assure myself of theif individual merits, as it would be most painful to me to eel that I had not done justice to any one of the brave men who shared with me the glories and dangers ofthisard- ous conflict. I beg now to mention the conduct of an illustrious Nobleman, Count Rayensburg, who, with the Officers of his Suite, Counts Greuben and Oriola, did us the honor to accompany the force during our operations. They were present at Moodkee, and in this great battle. It is with the greatest pleasure and sincerity I can b''ar my testimony to their gallant Conduct on these occasions, worthy of the high reputatio;i in arms of their countrymen, and of the great ancestor of one of them. I lament to add that Dr. Hoffiueister, the Medical Attendant on the Count, was killed in the action of the 21st instant. I herewith enclose the Report of Lieutenant General the Right Hon'ble Sir Henry Hardinge, Second in Com- ynand. ■ I hare, &amp;c. (Sd.) H. GO UGH, Genl., Commander in Chief.

S ir, I haye the honor to report to your Excellency that, when the Army under your Comm had formed its junction with the forces from Feroze^ore, under Major Gener&amp;I Sir John Littler, and was di vii up in order of battle, on the 2lst instant, I proceeded with the two l-sft Brigades commanded by Colonels \ i lace and McLaren to attack the enemy's entrenched position at Ferozeshah. 2. The line advanced with great steadiness, notwithstanding the nature of the ground intersected with ju* it When the Troops had cleared these impediments, and had opened out into the plain, they continued to press ■; a * without a check, under a very heavy fire of Grape and Musketry from the Enemy's batteries, and havin'- b down all opposition, entered the Enemy's Camp and captured theGuns in their front. 3, This portion of the Camp was, soon after, on fire, compelling the Troops to desist from their attaci the remainder, and as it was now dark, the Troops formed on the ground, nearly on a line with the bur Camp. From that period till the morninjr, these brave men were exposed to an incessant fire from the EneSu Guus, the darkness of the night being illuminated by the explosion of mines, tumbrils, and shells. '4. I need not dwell on the events of tins niirht, so remarkable in Military History, because vour Excellencr witnessed them, and with me admired the fortitude and resolution of these brave men, ready to encounter any danger, although harassed by fatigue and suffering from thirst. 5. 1 have personally reported to your Excellency my admiration of the conduct of H. .M.'s 80th Reo-iment and the 1st European Light Infantry, in obeying with alacrity the order I ijave about midnight, to stand to their arms and charge a Battery which bore destructively on our ranks. Lieut. Colonel Bunbury, assisted by Lieut* Colonel Wood, mv Aid-de-Camp, led the attack, on which occasion the latter officer was wounded. The Guns were spiked, the Enemy driven away with loss, and this part of our line left undisturbed for the remainder of the night. Their conduct in the preceding part of the action came more immediately unc/er your Excellency's own •bserVation 6- Your Excellency having formed the Troops before daylight, led the right of the attack, intrusting the left to me. The whole line instantly advanced, and animated by your example, carried every thin;; before them and. having traversed the Camp from one extremity to the other, drew up in a perfect line, expres»ing r by loud cheers, as we rode up the line, their conscious pride that every man had done his duty. 7. I again most cordially congratulate you on the brilliant sutrcess of the Army under your Excellency * Command, 8. It is now my duty to report to your Excellency that Major General Gilbert, commanding a portion af this Division of the Army, gave me the greatest satisfaction. 9. Colonel .Wallace fell bravely at the head of his Troops. 10. Colonel McLaren led his Brigade with his accustomed judgment and resolution. 11. My own personal Staff having been all disabled, with the exception of one most dear to me, and who stdl remained by my side, 1 derived, on the morning of the 22d, the rat^st valuable aid from Lieut. Coionef Birch, Judge Advocate General, from Lieutenant Colonel Parsons, and from your Bxcellency's intelli&gt;rf ; nt and brave Aid-de-Camp, Captain West. These Officers, riding several paces in front of the line, regulated the ad vance, animated the men, and prevented any unnecessary firing. 12. I have great obligations, during the whole of these operations, to ColoneL Benson, a Member of the Military Board, and acting as my Aid-de-Catnp, who has* constantly accompanied me in the field, and on whose cool judgment and experienced ability, I place great reliance^ 13. My Aid-de-Camp, Lt. Colonel Wood, has shewn all the qualities which make a good Officer. 14. 1 beg to bring to your notice my Aid-de-l amp Lieutenant Hillier, who is wounded, and Lieutenant Peel, of the 37th Native Infantry, Acting Aid-de-Camp, who is slightly wounded. Captain Beecher, of the Quarter Master General's Department, attached to my Camp, also accompanied me, and I recommend him as a very promising Officer. 15. I also recommend the Officers belonging to the Political Affency of these Provinces, who acted as my Aides-de-Camp, Captain Abbott and Lieutenant Lake are both wounded. Captain Mills, Acting Aid-de-Camp . took the command of a Troop of Horse Artillery, with his usual spirit 16. It is now with great pain that I have to record the irreparable loss I have sustained, and more especi ally the East India Company's Service, in the death of Major Broadfoot, of the Madras Army, my Political Agent. He was thrown from his horse by a shot, ami I failed in prevailuv* o(»n him to leave the field. He remounted, and shortly afterwards, received a mortal wound. He was as brave as he was able in every branch of the Political and Military Service. - 17. Major Somerset, my Military Secretary, much about the same time was shot through the body, con- ductim; himself with the hereditary courage of his race. He was always forernost where difficulties required to be overcome. I deeply regret his loss- 18. • 1 have also lost a most promising and brave Officer by the death of Captain Herries, on the night of the 18ill at Moodkee. 19. Li 'ut. Munro, of the 10th Lt. Cavalry, my A- D. C., a most amiable and excellent Officer, I have als'&gt; had the misfortune to lose, whilst at your Excellency's disposal in the aflflir at Vloodkee. 20. t aptain Hore, Assistant Military Secretary, and a valuable Officer, acting as my Aid-de-Camp, wa.i killed about the same time as Major Somerset received his wound. 21. I have now to request your Excellency's notice to the conduct of an illustrious Nobleman, Coo^' Ravenshurg, who, with the Oi'ficers of his suite, f3onnt Greuhen and Count Oriola, accompanied me in the field% These Prussian Officers nobly sustained the reputation of.then countrymen.IM) [ 144 ] 22.

The Governor General announces to the Army and the people of India, that he hat received from His Excelleuc)' the Commander in Chief of the Army a report by Major General Sir Harry Smith K .c. B. &lt;lated the 30th ultimo, giving the details of a complete victory gained by the troops under the immediate command of the Major General on the 28th January, over the Sikh Forces commanded by the Sirdar Runjoor Sing Mujethea. In this decisive and glorious action, the enemy's infantry vrere dislodged from every position and vil lage they attempted to hold by rapid charges at the point of the bayonet. Their horsemen were driven from every part of the field by repeated charges, in which the superior valour of the European and Native Cavalry was most conspicuous, and the Artillery moving with its accustoaied celerity, was always well to the front, directing its Hre with precision ail e.FiJt.— Taj result of tn^se noble efforts of the three arms of Artillery, Cavalry and Infa itrv, in which the valour a \ I discipline of the troops were happily combined with the skill of the Comaian ler, has been the signal defeat of the enemy, who was driven across the river with great loss, his camp being captured and 52 pieces of Artillery remaining in the hands of the victors. These trophies in addition to those taken at Ferozshah &amp; Moodkee, complete the number of 143 pieces of the Artillery taken in the field from the enemy, since the British army moved from its cantonments to repel a most unprovoked aggression on its territories. To Major General Sir H. Smith, and to the brave troops he commanded, the Governor General conveys the tribute of his admiration and the grateful acknjwledgaients of the Government and the peo ple of India. The service'rendered was most important, and was accomplished by the ability of the Commander and the valour of the troops. The Governor General's thanks are due to Brigadier Wheeler who although still suffering from the wounds received at Moodkee, energetically headed his Brigade, composed of Her Majesty's 5Dtli Regiment, the 48(.h Native Infantry, and the Sirmoor Battalion. Great praise is also due to 'ingadiers Godby and Hicks who with the 36th Native Infantry and Nusseree Battalion, H. M s. 31sl and the 24th and 47th Native Infantry •tormsi tb« village of AUwal, drew tii« «u«aay fraui it, and Ui» ynns br which it wa« defended.( W6 ) The Governor General has much iatisfaction in observing the warm terms of ad in nation in wlncli the Major General speaks of the Nusseree and Sinnoor Battalions, and the Sliekawattee Brigade under Brigadier Penny, Captain Fisher and Major Forster. These corps nobly emulated the example of the regular regiments of infantry. In short the conduct of the troops, European and Native, Regular and Irregular, was throughout the field an honorable rivalry in which every corps bravely did its duty. Her Majesty's 16th Lancers on this occasion have added to their former reputation acquired in va&lt; rious fields of battle in A.sia by routing th3 e.ieiny's cavalry in every direction and by resolute charges of two of its squadrons under Captain B ire and Major Smyth and Captain Pearson, penetrating the enemy's square ot tnfantry, in which charges the squadrons were gallantly supported by the 3rd Light Native Cavalry under Major Angelo. In these exploits the Native Cavalry distinguished itself throughout the day, and the Governor Gene ral is happy to be.u' his tes'im );iv to the fact that since the army ot the Sutlej commenced its operations on the 18th December, the Native Cavalry has on every occasion proved itssuperior prowess, whether in the general actions which have been fought or in the Various skirmishes at the outposts, such as that in which Captain Becher was gallantly engaged with a small party of the 8th Irregular Cavalry at Alloowalla on the morning of the 27th January. The Governor General's thanks are due in an especial manner to Brigadier Cureton who commanded the Cavalry. This olRcer's whole life has been spent in the most meritorious exertions in Europe and Asia, and on this occasion the skill and intrepidity with which the cavalry force was handled, obtained the admiration of the army which witnessed their movements. The Government of India ever desirous to mark its,grateful sense of the services of the army, will cause a medal to be presented to every Officer and Soldier of the East India Company's service, engaged in the Battle of Aliwal, and requests through His Excellency the Commander in Chief that a nominal roll may be furnished for that purpose. By order of the Right Hon'ble the Governor General of India, (Signed) F. CURRIE, Sec. to the Govt, of India with the Govr. Gent. Extract from ei despatch from His Excellency the Commander in Chief to the Right Hon ble ihc Governor General, dated the Isf February 1846. Meanwhile the upper Sutlej has become the scene of very interesting operations. It is a strange feature of this War that the enemy, pressed for supplies on his own bank, has been striving to draw them from his Jageer states on this side of the river. In the town and Fort of Dhurm- kote, which were filled with grain, he had in the second week of January, a small garrison of Mercenaries Rohi'llas, Ensufzies and Affghans, Major General Sir Harry Smith, was on the 18th sent against this place svith a single Brigade of his Division and a Light Field Battery. He easily effected its reduction, the troops within it surrendering at discretion, after a few cannon shots. But whilst he was yet in march, I received information of a more serious character. There remained little cause to doubt that Sirdar Runjoor Sing Majeethea, had crossed from Philour at the head of a numerous force of all arms and established himself in position at Baran Hara, between the old and the new courses of the Sutlej ; not only threatening the City of Loodiana with plunder and devastation, but indicating a determination to intersect the line of our communications at Bussian and Rackote. The safetv of the rich and populous town of Loodiana had been, in some measure provided for by the presence of three Battalions of Native Infantry under Brigadier Godby, and the gradual advance of our reinforcements, amongst which was included Her Majesty's 53rd Regiment, and the position of the Shekawattee Brigade near Bussian gave breathing time to us in that direction. But on the receipt of intelligence which could be relied on of the movements of Runjoor Sing and his apparent views. Major General Sir Harry Smith, with the Brigade at Dhurmkote and Brigadier Cure- ton's Cavalry, was directed to advance by Jugraon towards Loodiana, and his second Brigade under Brigadier Wheeler, moved on to support him. Then commenced a series of very delicate combinations, the momentous character of which can only be comprehended, by reflecting on the task which had devolved on this army of guarding the frontier from Rooper down to Mundote. The Major General breaking up from Jugraon moved towards Loodiana, when the Sirdar, relying on the vast superiority of his forces assumed the initiative, and endeavoured to intercept, his progress by marching in a line parallel to him, and opening upon his tn-ops a furious cannonade. The Major Ge neral continued coolly to manaeuvre and when the Sikh Sirdar bending round one wing of his army, enveloped his flank, lie extricated himself by retiring with the steadiness of a field day by echellon of Battalions, and effected his communication with Loodiana but not without severe loss. Reinforced by Brigadier Godby he felt himself to be strong ; but his manaeuvre had thrown him out of communication with Brigadier Wheeler, and a portion of his baggage had fallen into the hands of the enemy,—The Sikh Sirdar took up an entrenched position at Budhowal supporting himself on its Fort, but threatened on either flank by General Smith and Brigadier Wheeler, finally decamped and moved down to the Sntkj. T^e British troops made good their juuction, and occupied the abandonerf( m ) poaitiou of Hudhuwal ; the Shekawattee Brigade and Her Majesty's 53rd Rogimont also added i« tk* streogtli of the Major Creneral aad he prepared to attack the Sikh Sirdar on his ne\T ground. But on th« 26tli, Runjoor Sing was re-inforced from the right bank with 4000 Regular Troops, twelve pieces Artillery and a large force of Cavalry, Emboldened by this succession of strength, he ventured on the measure of advancing towarda Jugraon, apparently with the view of intercepting our communications by that route. It is my gratifying duty to announce that this presumption has been rebuked by a splendid Victory obtained over him. He has not onl^ been repulsed by the Major General, but his camp at Aliwal carried by storm, the whole of his cannon and munitions of war captured, and his army driven headlong across the Sutlej, even on the right bank of which he found no refuge from the fire of our Artillery. I have the honor now to forward the Major General's report, which has just reached me. It is so ample and luminous that 1 might perhaps have spared some of the details into which admiration of tha Major General's conduct and of the brave army confided to him, in these operations, has led me. It now remains for me only to congratulate you. Right Hon'ble Sir, and the Government of India, on the brilliant success which, under Divine Providence, the Major General has achieved ; and to record my opinion that, throughout these arduous and important operations, he has displayed all the qualities of an able Commander. Most strongly, and most earnestly at the same time, I beg to bring to your notice, and to that of His Grace the Duke of Wellington, and the Honorable the Court of Dlreetorg, the of ficers and corps on whom he has so justly bestowed his commendations.

Previously to the march of the troops it had been intimated to me by Major Mackeson, that the information by Spies, led to the belief the enemy would move somewhere at day-light, either on Ju- graon, my poiition of Buddawul, or Loodianah. On a near approach to his outposts this rumour wa« con firmed by a Spy, who had just left his camp, saying the Sikh army was actually in march towards Jugraon. My advance was steady, my troops well in hand, and if he had anticipated me on the Jugraon road, I could have fallen upon his centre with advantage. From the tops of the houses of the village of Poorein, I had a distant view of the enemy. He was in motion, and appeared directly opposite my front on a ridge of which the village of Aliwal may be regarded as the centre. His left appeared still to occupy its ground in the circular entrenchment, his right was brought forward and occupied the ridge. I immediately deployed the cavalry into line, and moved c As I neared the enemy, the ground became most favorable for the troops to manaeuvre, being open ai hard grass land, I ordered the cavalry to take ground to the right and left by brigades : thus displaying the heads of the infantry columns and as they reached the hard ground I directed them to deploy into line. Brigadier Godby's Brigade was in direct echellon to the rear of the right, the She- kawuttee infantry in like manner to the rear of my left. The cavalry in direct echellon on, and well to the rear of, both flanks of the Infantry. The Artillery massed on the right, and centre and left: after deployment I observed the enemy's left to outflank me, I therefore broke into open column and took ground to my right, when I had gained sulBcient ground, the troops wheeled into line : there was no dust, the sun ne brightly. Thus manaeuvres were performed with the celerity and precision of the most correct field day. The glistening of the bayonets and swords of this order of battle was most imposing, and the line advanced. Scarcely had it moved forward 150 yards when at 10 o'clock the enemy opened a tierce cannonade from his whole line. At first his balls fell short, but quickly reached us. Thus upon him, and capable of better ascertaining his position I was compelled to halt the line, though under fire for a few moments, until 1 ascertained that by bringing up my right .d carrying the village of Allewul I could with great effect, precipitate myself upon his left and centre. I therefore quickly brought up Brigadier Godby's Brigade, and with it and the 1st Brigade under Brigadier Hicks, made a rapid and noble charge, carried the village and two guns of large calibre. The line I ordered to advance, H. M's. 31st Foot, and the Native regiments contending for the front, and the battle became general. The enemy had a numerous body of cavalry on the heights to his lieft, and I ordered Brigadier Cureton to bring up the right Brigade of Cavalry who, in the most gallant manner, dashed in among them, and drove them back upon Iheir Infantry, mean while a second gallant charge to my right was made by the Light Cavalry and the Body Guard. The Shekawuttee Brigade was moved well to the right, in support of Brigadier Cure- Ion, when I observed the enemy's encampment, and saw it was full of Infantry, I immediately brought upon it Brigadier Godby's Brigade, by changing front, and taking the Enemy's Infantry ' en-revers.' They drove them before them, and took some guns without a check. While these operations were going on upon the right, and the Enemy's Left Flank was thus driven back, 1 occasionally observed the Brigade under Brigadier Wheeler, an ollicer in whom I have the greatest confidence, charging and carrying guns and every thing before it, again connecting his line and moving on, in a manner which ably displayed the coolness of the. Brigadier and the gallantry of his irresistible Brigade. H, M's. . r )0th Foot, the 48th N. I. and the Sirmor Battalion altho' the loss was, 1 regret to say severe in the 50th, upon the left, Brigadier Wilson with 11. M's. 53rd and the 30th N.l. equalled in celerity and regularity their comrades on the right, and this Brigade was opposed to the ' Aieen' Troops, called Avitabile when the fight was fiercely raging. The enemy, weAJ^iriven back on his left and centre, endeavoured to hold his right to cover the pas- gage of the river, a«d he strongly occupied the village of Bhoondee—I directed a squadron of the IGth JLancers under Major Smith and Captain Pearson to charge a body to the right of the village, which they did in the most gallant and determined style, bearing every thing before them, as a squadron under Captain Berehad previously done, going right through a square of Infantry wheeling about and reenter ing the square in the most intrepid manner with the deadly lance.—This charge was accompanied by the 3rd Light Cavalry under Major Angelo, and as gallantly sustained. The largest gun upon the field and 7 others were then captured, while the 53rd Hegt. carried the village by the bayonet, and tho 30th N. I. wheeled round to the rear in a most spirited manner. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander's and Cap tain Turton's Troops of Horse Artillery under Major Lawrenson dashed almost among the flying Infan try committing great havock, until about 800 or 1000 men rallied under the high bank of a nullah and opened a heavy but ineflectual fire from below the bank. I immediately directed the 30th N.I. to charge them, which they were able to do upon their left flank, while in a line in rear of the village—This native corps nobly obeyed my orders and rushed among the Avitabile Troops driving them from under the bank, and exposing them once more to the deadly fire of 12 Guns within 300 yards— The destruction was very great, as may be supposed by guns served as these were, H. M.'s 53rd Regiment moved forward in support of the 30th N. I. by the right of the village—The battle was won —Our troops advancing with the most perfect order to the common focus, the passage «f the river.—The enemy completely hemmed in were flying from our fire, and precipitating themselves in disordered masses into the ford and boats in the utmost confusion and consternation, our 8 Inch How itzers soon began to play upon their boats, when the *'Debris' of the Sikh army appeared upon the opposite aud high bank of the river, flying in every direction, altho' a sort of line was attempted to oonntenance their retreat, until all our guns commenced a furious cannonade when they quickly receded. Nine guns were on the verge of the river by the ford. It appears as if they had been unlimbered to w»ver the ff &gt;rd. Tf ^ese feeing loaded were fired nnce upon onr advance two others were sticking in(23) ( 229 ) V ' I &lt; tl»e river, one of them we got out, two were seen to sink in the rjiiick sands, two were dragged to the ppposite bank and abandoned. These and the one in the middle of the river were gallantly spiked by Lieutenant Holmes of the llth Irregular Cavalry, and Gunner Scott of the 1st troop 2nd Brigade Horse Artillery who rode into the stream and crossed for the purpose, covered by our guns and Light Infantry. Thus ended the battle of Aliwal one of the most glorious victories ever achieved in India by the united efforts of Her Majesty's and the Mon'ble Company's Troops. Every &lt;7^/1 the enemy had fell into our hands, as I infer from his never opening one upon us from the opposite bank of the river, which is high and favorable for the purpose, fifty-two guns are now in ii GunssThce ascertained to be sunk in the rirer, total 67 the Ordnance Park, two sank in the bed of the Sntlej 30 odd jinjalls fell into our handi. an( i two were spiked on the opposite bank making a fo- H ^ tal of 56 pieces of cannon captured or destroyed. Many Jinjalis which were attached to AvitaLiles Corps, and which aided in the defence of the village of Bhoan- dee have also been taken. The whole army ol the enemy has been driven headlong over the difficult ford of a broad river, his camp, baggage, stores of ammunition and of grain, his all in fact, wrested from him, by the repeated charges of Cavalry and Infantry aided by the guns of Alexander, Turton, Lane, Mill, BoHeau and of the Shekawatfee Brigade and by the 8 inch howitzers. Our guns literally being con stantly ahead of every thing. The determined bravery of all was as conspicuous as noble. 1 am unwont to praise when praise is not merited ; and I here most avowedly express my firm opinion and jconvicfion, that no troops in any battle on record ever behaved more nobly. British and Native no dis tinction, Cavalry all vying with H. M's. l()th Lancers and striving to head in the repeated charges, our v §uns and Gunners, Ollicers and Men, may be equalled, but cannot be excelled by any Artillen in the ' orld. Throughout the day no hesitation, a bold and intrepid advance, and thus it is'that our loss is com- v natively small, tho' I deeply regret to say severe. The enemy fought with much resolution, they aintained frequent rencontres with our cavalry hand to hand. In one charge upon Infantry of H. — 1's. 16lh Lancers, they threw away their muskets and Came on with their swords and targets against the lance. Having thus done justice and justice alone to the gallant troops His Excellency entrusted to my command, I would gladly, if the limits of a despatch (already too much lengthened I fear,) permitted me do that justice to individuals all deserve—Tliis cannot be, therefore must I confine myself to mention those officers, whose continued services, experience and standing, placed them in conspicuous commands— In Brigadier Wheeler, my second in command, I had a support I could rely on with every confidence and most gallantly did he head his Brigade: From Brigadiers Wilson, God by and Hick 's, I had alsoeverv support, and every t' 'r' 'rrtfti-H vit 'i llnnr riniri -iii n r In Kri nli Lf ^iin Inn. Her Maiestv has one of those officers rarely met with, the cool experience of the Veteran Soldier is cpmbined with vouth- ful activity,—His knowledge of outpost duty and the able manner he handles his Cavalry under the heaviest fire, rank him among the tirst caralry ollicers of the age; and I beg to drawn His Excellency's marked attention to this honest encomium—In Major Lawrenson, Commanding the Aflillerv Lieutenant Colonel Alexander, Captain Turton and Lieutenant Colonel Lane, the service has officers of the very first order, and I am equally satisfied with Captain Boileau, in command of the 9 Pr. Batterv and yvith Lieutenant Mill in charge of four light guns. The two 8 inch Howitzers did right good service, organized, equipped and brought into the field by the exertions and determination to overcome all diili- cultiesof Lieutenant Colonel Lane, equally well served and brought forward always with the Infantry bv Lieutenant Austin. To Brigadiers Macdowal and Stedman Commanding their gallant Brigades of Cavatrv, the fortune of the day is greatly indebted, and to all Commanding Officers of Cavalry and Infantry, my warmest thanks Are due, to Major Smith, Commanding H.

Dy ordtr of the Hon hie the Governor in Council, J. P. WILLOUGHBY, Chief Secy. General Order by the Right Honorable the Governor-General of India. Foreign Department, Camp Kussoor, the \Ath February 1846. The Governor -General having received from His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief the despatch annexed to this paper, announces to the Army and the people of India, for the fourth tune dnring this Campaign, a most important and memorable Victory obtained by the Array of the Sutlej over the Sikh forces at Sobraon on the 10th instant. On that day the Enemy's strongly entrenched camp, defended by 35,000 men and 67 pieces of Artillery, , exclusive of heavy guns on the opposite bank of the river, was stormed by the Bnt.sh Array under the immediate command of His Excellency Sir Hugh G.ragh, Baronet, G C. B and in two hours the *ikh forces were driven into the river with immense loss, sixty-seven guns being captured by the \ ictors. The Governor-General most cordially congratulates the Commander-in Chief and the British Array on tbi. - exploit, one of the-nwst daring ever achieved, by which, in open dav, a tnplelrae of I reastworks, flanked by form- Viable Redoubts, bristlin.- with Artillery, manned by 32 Regular Reg.raents ofloftntry, was assaulted andcsrr.ed by the forces under His Excellency's command. This important operation was most judiciously precede! by a cannonade from the heavy Howitzert and Mortars, which had arrived from Delhi on the 8lh instant, the same day on which the forces under Major General Sir Harry Smith, which had been detached to Loodianah and had gained the victory ot Ahwal, rejoined the (.&gt;om- maMder-in-Chiefs Camp. ^ The vertical fire of the heavy Ordnance had the effect intended by His Excellency ; it shook the Enemy's confi dence in works so well and so laboriously constructed, and compelled them to seek shelter in the broken ground within their camp. T-he British Infantry, formed on the extreme left of the line, then advanced to the assault, and in spite of impediment, cleared the entrenchments and entered the hnemy's camp. Her Majesty s 10th, 53rd, ami 80lh Regiments, with the ;i3rd, 43rd, 59th, and 63d Native Infantry, moving at a firm and steady pace, never fired a shot till they had passed the barriors opposed to them, a forbearance much to be commemied and most worthy of constant imitation, to which may be attributed the success ot their fir»t effort, and the small loss* they nustained ; this attack was crowned with the success it deserved and (led by its gallant Cominandei, Major General Sir Robert Dick) obtainad the admiration of the Army, which witnessed its disciplined valor ; wh n checked bv the formidable obstacles and superior numbers to which the attacking division was exposed, the 2d division, under Major General Gilbert, afforded the most opportune assistance by rapidly advancing to the attack of the enemy's Batteries, entering their fortified position after a severe struggle, and sweeping through the interior of the camp. This division inflicted a very severe loss on the retreating Enemy. The same gallant efforts, attended by the same success, distinguished the attack ot the Enemy s left, made by the first Division undt r the command of VI ajor-General Sir H. limith, k . c. b ., in which the 1 roops nobly sustained their former reputation. These three Divisionsof Infantry, concentrated within the Enemy's carnp, drove his shattered forces into the river, with a loss which far exceeded that which the most experienced Officers had ever witnessed.C 269 ) rhus tprmmated, in fiie brief space of two hours, this most remarkable conflict, in which the Militrarv combina tions ot the t omtnander-m-Cliief were fully and ably carried into effect with His Excellency's characteristic energv. 1 he Knemv's select llesriments of Regular Infantry have been dispersed, and a large proportion destroyed, with the loss, since the campaign began, of'2-20 pieces of Artillery taken in action. 1 he same evening six llejiments of Vative Infantry crossed the Sutlej. On the following day the bridge of boats was nearly completed by that able an.i indefatigable officer. Major Abbott of the Engineers, and the Army is this day encamped at Kussnor, 32 miles from Lahore. ihe Governor-General again most cordially congratulates the Commander-in-Chief on the important results oiitaineu by this memorable achieve men l. The Governor-General, in the name of the Government and of the people ol India, otters to His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, to the General Officeri.'and all the Officers and Iroops under their Command, his j^nteful and heartfelt acknowledgments for the services they have perform- lo commemorate this great Victory the Governor-General will cause a Medal to be struck wjth 'Sobraon' engraved upon it. to be presented to the victorious Army in the service of the East India Company, and reijuesu His Excellency the i ommander-in-C hief to forward the Lists, usually furnished, of thute engaged. The Governor-General deeply regrets the loss of the brave Officers and men who have fallen on this occasion. Major Genera! Sir Robert Dick, K. C. B., who led the attack, received a m'ortal wound after he had entered the Enemy's entrenchments. Thus fell, most gloriously at the moment of Victory, this veteran Officer, displaying the same energy and intrepidity as when, 35 years ago in Spain, he was the distinguished leader of the 42nd Hi 'h- lander^. The Army has also sustained a heavy loss by the death of Brigadier Taylor, Conmaruling the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division, a most able Officer and very worthy to have been at the head of so distinguished a corps as H. M. 29th regiment, by which he was beloved and respected. The Company's Service has lost an excellent Officer in Captain Fisher, who fell at the head of the brave Sirmoor Regiment, which greatly distinguished itself. The Governor -General has much satisfaction in again offering to Major General Sir Harry Smith, k. c. b, Commandins the 1st division of Infantry, his best thanks for his gallant services on this occasion, by which he has added to his well established reputation. The Governor-General acknowledges the meritorious conduct of Brigadier Penny and Bii^adier Hicks Com manding Brigades in the 1st division. H. M.'s 31st and 50th Regiments greatly distinguished themselves, as well as the 42d, 47th Native Infantry. and the Nussteree Hattalion. The Governor-General's thanks are also due to Lieutenant Colonel Ryan, Commandin &gt; H. M.'s 50th, who he regrets to hear, has been severely wounded. To Vlajur General Gilbert, Commanding the 2d division, the Governor-General is most happy to express' his acknowledgments for the judgment, coolness, and intrepidity displayed by him on every occasion since the cam paign opened, and on the present, the promptitude and energy of his attack essentially contributed to ensure' the success of the dav. J The Governor-General trusts that the wound received by Brigadier McLaren will not long deprive the service of one of its best Officers. H. M.'s 29th, and 1st European regiment, and the 16th, 48th, 61st Native Infantry, and the Sirmoor Battalion have entitled themselves, by their gallant conduct, to the thanks of the Government. To Brigadier Stacy, on whom the command of the 2nd Division devolved, the Governor-General's thanks are cpecially due for the able manner in which the attack within the enemy's camp was directed. ^ The Governor-General is also glad to have this opportunity of acknowledging the services of Brigadier Wilkin son, Commanding the 6lh Brigade of the attacking Division. The Brigade composed of H. M's. 9th and 62nd Regiments, and the 26th N. I., under the command of Briga dier the Hon'ble T. Ashburnham, placed in support of the attacking division, by its firm and judicious advance, contributed to the success of the assault. The Cavalry, uu .ier the command of Major General Sir J. Thackwell K. C. B., Brigadiers Cureton Scutt and Campbell, were well in hand, and ready for any emergency; H. M's. 3rd Light Dragoons, as usual,' were in the foremost ranks, and distinguished themselves under their Commanding Officer Lieut. Col. White. Brigadier Smith, the Commanding Engineer, fully accomplished the Commander-in-Chiefs instructions, and to Captain Baker and Lieut. Becher, of the Engineers, the Governor General's acknowledgments are due for leading the Diviiion of attack into the enemy's camp; these Officers well maiutaiued the reputation of their Corn* whenever gallantly or science may be retjuired from its members. Major Abbott, of the Eiuineers, exclusive of his exertions in constructing the bridge of Boats, displayed much intelligence in the field. The merits of Major Reilly, commanding that most useful corps the Sappers and Mi ners, are acknowledged ; the ability and zeal of Brigadier Irvine, the senior officer of the Engineer corps, are well known to the Governor-General, and his forbearance in not assuming the command, having reached the camp on the preceding evening, is duly appreciated. Brigadier Gowan, Commanding the Artillery, ably directed the practice of the heavy Artillery on the left, assist ed by Lieut. Col. biddulph, Lieut. Col. Broake, Lieut. Col. Wood, and Capt. Pillans. On the right the Howitzer pratice was well sustained by Major Grant. The Troops of Horse Artillery of Lieut. Col. Lane and Capt. Fordyce greatly assisted the attack of our Infantry on the left, and whilst the enemy were crossing the river the fire of Lieut. Col. Alexander's troop was most effective. The Troops of Capt. Horsford and Capt Swinley also did good service. The Governor -General's acknowledgments are due to Major Grant, Deputy Adjutant General, and to his de- p n tmcnt generally, for their ability and intelligence. To the Quarter Master General the service is much indebted/ ( 260 ) for tlie judgment aud zeil which mark all llif proccedlnL's of thai Officer, and the Governor-General offers his dcpartmenf' 16 ' 118 ^ Qtt,rter MMtef Ge,,eral Lie,lt - Co1 - Drummond, and the Officer! of that To Lieut.

Birch, Judge Advocate (jeneral, the Governor-General again has to reuoat his thanks for his intelligence and gallantry. To Lieut. (Joi. Havelock, Persian Interpreter, the Governor-General offers his best thanks. [lie Governor-General desires to record las obligations to Count Ravensburgh and to the Officers of His Roval Highmss s Staff, Count Oriola and Count Greuben. This gallant and amiable Prince, with his brave associates ot the Prussian Army, has shared all the dangers, and secured for himself the respect aud admiration of the British Army, and the Governor General begs to convey to his Royal Highness aud to his Stiff iiU cordial thanks for the ready offers of their services on the field of battle. I he Governor-General has now to acknowledge the services rendered by the officers attached to his own staff. He renews to Lieut, Col. Benson of the Military Board, his strong sense of the important services rendered by that olhcer during the whole oi this campaign, whose general information in military details, and cool judgment in action, deserve ihis acknowledgment. # Lieut. Col. Wood, the (Tovernor -Gcneral s Military Secretary, displayed on the 10th instant, the same intelli gence and gallantry as on former occasions. Major Lawrence, the Governor-General's Political Agent, has throughout these operations afforded most useful assistance by his ability, zeal and activity in the field, as well as on every other occasion. Capt. Mills. Assistant Pol. Agent and Honorary Aide-de-Camp to the Governor-Geueral, has shown the most unwearied devotion to the service, as well in the field as in the exercise of his personal influence in the protected Sikh States. The Governor-General's thanks are also due to Capt. Cunningham, Engineers, Assistant Pol. Azont. The Governor-General's Aides-de-Carap, Capt. Grant. Lord Arthur Hay, Capt. Peel, and Capt. Hardiu^e, by their gallantry and intelligence rendered themselves most useful, ' In the operations of this campaign, in which Officers of the Civil Service have accompanied the camp and participated in the risks incidental to active warfare, the Governor-General's thanks are due for their readiness in encountering these risks, and their endurance of privations. The Governor-General acknowledges the able assis tance he has at all times received from the Political Secretary F. Currie E^q. His acknowkdgmeuts are ulso due to his Private Secretary C, Hardinge Esq., and to the Assistant Political Agent R. Cust Esq.' Lieut. Col. Parsons, Deputy Commissary General, has succeeded in keeping ih^. army well supplied, and the Governor -Geheral is much satisfied with his exertions and those of the Officers under his command. The army took the field under circumstances ot great difficulty, and by strenuous exertions, and ajood ai ran^ements on the part of the Lieut. Cohmel, the army has now a large supply in reserve, a result very creditable to the chief of the Com- V missariat. Department. The manner in which Capt. Johnston has conducted the Commissariat duties entrusted to him. has also met with the Governor-General's approbation. To Dr. Macleud, Superintending Surgeon, and to Dr. Graham, as well as to the officers of the Medical De partment generally, the Governor-General offers his acknowledgments. His thanks are due to Dr. Walker, Surgeon to the Governor-General, whose ability is only to be equalled by Tus zeal and humanity. A salute of 21 guns will be fired in celebration of the Victory of Sobraon at all the usual stations of the Army. £1/ Order oj the Right Hon'hie the (ioterny-General of India. (Signed) F CURRIE, Sccy &gt; to the Ciovt of India, with the Governor- General* Head Quarters, Army of the Sutlej, Camp Kussoor, 1 A Februarij, 1846. To the Right Hon'ri-f. tue Governor-General of India. &amp;c. &amp;c , &lt;Sdc. Right Hon'ble Sir,—This is the fourth despatch which I have had the honor of addressing to you since the open- mg of the campaign. Thanks to Almighty God, whose hand I desire to aeknowlod-e in all pur 'successes the occasion of my writing now is to announce a fourth and most glorious and decisive Victory! My last communication detailed the movements of the Sikhs and our counter-manoeuvres sir)0&lt;e the orent dav of Ferozshah. Defeated on the Upper Sutlej, the enemy continued to occuiiv his position on the riglu bank, and liin formidable tete de pont and entrenchments on the left bank of the river in front of the main body of our Army But on the 10th instant, all that he held of Uritish territory, which was comprised in the «;round on which one of his camps stood, was stormed from his grasp, and his audacity was again signally punished bv a blow, sudden heavy and overwhelming. It is my gratifying duty to detail the measures which have fed to this gloiious result. The enemy's works had been repeatedly reconnoitred during the time of mv Head Quarters beiiis, fixed at \i- halkee, by myself, my Departmental Mat!', and my Engineer and Artiiiery Officers. Onr obst-rvalions coupled with the reports of spies, convinced us that there had devolved on us the arduous task of itttacking, in a position co vered with formidable entienchmenls, not fewer than thirty thousand men. tht best of the Khals;* troops, with seventy pieces of cannon, united by a good b.idge to a reserve the opposite b.mk, on which the eneiuv had a considerable camp, and some Artillery, commanding and flanking his field works on our side Major General Sir Harry Smith's division having rejoined me on the evening of the 8th, and p-«. t of my siege train liavin- corns u , with me, 1 resolved, on the morning of the 10th, to dispose our mortars and battering guns on the alluvial land //* 7J '■M961 ) within good range of the enemy's works. To enable us to do this it was necessary first to drive in the enemy t pickets at the post of observation in front of Kodeewalla, and at the little Sobraon. It was directed that thif ihould be done during the night of the 9th. but the execution of this part of the plan was deferred owing to mis- conceptions and casual circumstances until near daybreak. The delay was of little importance, as the event showed that the Sikhs had followed our example in occupying the two posts in force by day only. Of both therefore possession was taken without opposition. The battering and disposable Field Artdlery was then put in position on an extended semi-circle, embracing within its tire the works of the Sikhs It had been intended that the cannonade should have commenced at daybreak ; but so heavy a mist hung over the plain and river that it became necessary to wait until the rays of the sun had penetrated it and cleared the atmosphere. Meanwhile o» the margin of the Sutlej on our left, tw o Brigades of Major General Sir Robert Dick's Division, under his per sonal command, stood ready to commence the assault against the enemy's extreme right. His 7th Brigade, m which was the 10th Foot, reinforced by the 53d Foot, and led by Brigadier Stacy, was to head the attack, mp- ported at two hundred yards distance by the sixth Brigade under Brigadier Wilkinson. In reserve was the 5th Brigade under Brigadier the Hon'ble T. Ashburnham, which was to move forward from the entrenched village of KodeewalU, leaving, if necessary, a regiment for its defence. In the centre Major General Gilb ert's Divisi ui was deployed for support or att ick, its right resting on and in the village of the little Sobraon. Major General Sir Harry Smith's Division was formed near the village of Guttah, with its right thrown up towards the Sutlej. Brigadier Cure ton's Cavalry threatened, by feigned attacks, the ford at Hurreeke and the enemy's horse under Kaiah Lall Singh Misron the opposite bank. Brigadier Campbell taking an intermediate position in the rear between Major General Gilbert 's right and Major General Sir Harry Smith's left, protected both. Major Ge- neral Sir Joseph Thackwell, under who!i\ was Brigadier Scott, held in reserve on our left, ready to act as cir cumstances might demand, the rest of the cavalry. Our Battel y of tt-poundersenlarged into twelves opened near the little Sobraon with a Brigade of Howitzers formed from the Light field Batteries and troops of Horse Artillery, shortly after daybreak. But it was half past six before the whole of our Artillery fire was developed. It was most spirited and well directed. I cannr.t speak in terms too hih of the judicious disposition of the Guns, their admirable practice, or the activity with which the cannonade was^ustained. But notwithstanding the formidable calibre of our Iron Guns, Mortars and Howitzers, and the admirable way in which they were served, and aided by a Rocket Battery, it would have been visionary to expect that thev could, within any limited time, silence the fire of seventy pieces behind well constructed Bat teries of earth, plank and fascines, or dislodge troops covered either by redoubts or epanlements, or within a tre ble line of trenches. The effect of the connonade was. as has been since proved by an inspection of the camp, most severely felt by the enemy; but it soon became evident that the issue of this struggle must be bi ought to the arbitrement of musketry and the bayonet. At 9 o'clock Brigadier Stacy's Brigade, supported on either flank by Captains Horsford's and Fordyce's Bat- 'teries and Lieut. Col. Lane's Troop of Horse Artillery, moved to the attack in admirable order. The Infantry and Guns aided each other correlatively. The former marched steadily on in line, which they halted only to correct when necessary. The latter took up successive positions at the gallop, until at length they were within three hundred yards of the heavy Batteries of the Sikhs, but notwithstanding the regularity and coolness, and scientific character of this assault, which Brigadier Wilkinson well supported, so hot was the fire of cannon, musketr/ and zumboorucks kept up by the Khalsa troops, that it seemed tor some moments impossible that the entrenchr,^ ments could be won under it; but soon persevering gallantry triumphed, and the whole Army had the satisfaction to sec the gallaut Brigadier Stacy 's soldiers driving the Sikhs in confusion before them within the area of thair encampment The 10th Foot, under Lieutenant Colonel Franks, now for the first time brought into serious con tact with the enemy, greatly distinguished themselves. This regiment never fired a shot until it had got within the works of the eaemy. The onset of H. M.'s oMFoot was as gallant and effective. The 4ad and 60th Na- tive Infantry, brigaded with them,emulated both in cool determination. At the moment of this first success, I directed Brigadier the Hon'ble T. Ashburnham's Brigade to move on in support ; and Major Genl. Gilbert's and Sir Harry Smith's Divisions to throw out their light troops to threaten the works aided by Artillery. A» these attacks of the centre and right commenced, the fire of our heavy Guns had first to be directed to the right, and then gradually to cease, but at one time the thunder of full 120 pieces of ord- uance reverberated in this mighty combat through the valley of the Sutlej, and as it was soon seen that the weight of the whole force within the Sikh Camp was likely to be thrown upon the two Brigades that ha J passed its trenches it became necessary to convert into close and serious attacks the demonstrations with Skirmishers ani Artillery of the centre and right, and the battle raged with inconceivable fury from right to left. The Sikhs, even wh'-n at particular points their entrenchments were mastered with the bayonet, strove to regain them by the fier cest conflict sword in hand. Nor was it until the Cavalry of the left under Major General Sir Joseph, Thack well had moved forward and ridden through the openings in the entrenchments made by our sappers, in single file and re -formed as they passed them, and the 3d Dragoons, whom no obstacle usually held formidable by horse appears to check, had on this day, as at Ferozshah, galloped over and cut down the obstinate defenders ot Bat teries and field works, ami until the full weicht of three divisions of infantry, with every field artillery Gnn which could be sent to their'aid, had been cast into the scale, that victory finally declared for the British. The fire of the Sikhs fir»t slackened and then nearlv ceased, and the victors then pressing them on every side, precipitated them in mnsses over their bndse and into the Sutlej, which a sudden rise of seven inches had rendered hardly ford able In their efforts to reach the right bank through the deepened water, they suffered from our horse artil lery a terrible carnage. Hundreds fell under this cannonade; hundreds upon hundreds were drowned in attempt, uv' the periloiw passage. Their awful slaughter, confusion, and dismay, were such as would have excited com^ 'ion in the hearts of their generous conquerors, if the Khalsa troops had nor, m the early part of the action, sullied their trallantry bv slaughtering and barbarously mangling every wounded soldier whom, in the vicissitude* ot attack the fortune of war left at their mercv. 1 must pause in this narrative especially to notice the determined 'hard ihood and bravery with which our two battalions of Ghoorkhas, the Sirmoor and Nusseree, met the Sikh* wherever they were opposed to them. Soldiers of small stature, but indomitable spirit, they vied in ardent courage m th ' charge with the grenadiers ot our own nation, and armed with the short weapon of their mountains, wer« L terror to the Sikhs throughout this great Combat.( 262 ) Sixty-seven pieces of cannon, upwards of 200 camel swivels, (zamboorucks) numerous standanls, and vast munitions of war, captured by our troops, are the pledges and trophies of our victory. The battle was over by 11 m the m &gt;rnin' and in the forenoon I caused our Engineers to burn a part and to sink a part of the vaunted bridg* of the Khalsa army, across which they had boastfully come once more to defy us, ani to threaten Imha with ruin and devastation. We have to deplore a loss severe in itself, but certainly not heavy when weighed in the balance against the obstacles overcome and the advantages obtained. 1 have especially to lament the fall of Major General bir Robert Dirk k c b a gallant veteran of the Peninsula and Waterloo campaigns He survived only until evenintr the dan-erous Vape-shot &gt;vound wh.ch he received c ose to the enemy's entrenchments whilst personally animatm-, by hfs dauntless example, the soldiers or H. M. 80th Regt. in their career of noble daring. Major General Gilbert, to whose gallantry and unceasing exertions I have been so deep y indebted, and whose service* have been so eminent ti.roughout this eventful campaign, and Brigadier Stacy, the leader uf the Brigade most hotly and successfully engaged, both received contusions. They were such as would have caused many men to retire from the field but they did not interrupt for a moment the efforts of these heroic otficers. Brigadier McLaren, so distin Mushed In the campaigns in Affghanistan. at vlaharajpore, and now again in our conflicts with the Sjikb. h »s been badly wounded by a ball in the knee. Brigadier Taylor c. b ., one ot the most gallant an 1 intelligent officers in the armv, to whom I have felt deeply indebted on many occasions, fell in this fight at the head ot his Brigade in close encounter with the enemy, and covered with honorable wounds. Brigadier Penny, of the Nas- -eree Battalion commanding the 2nd Brigade, has been wounded, but not I trust severely. 1 am deprived for the present of the Valuable services of Lieutenant Colonel J. U Gough, c. B.. Acting Quarter-Master-General H M's. Troops, whose aid I have so highly prized m all my campaigns in China and India. He has received a wound from a grape shot, which is severe, but I hope not dangemus. Lieutenant Colonel Barr, Acting Adjutant General H M's Forces whos. superior merit as a staff officer I have before recorded, has suffered a compound fracture m the left arm by a ball. It is feared that amputation may become necessary. Lieutenant Colonels Ryan and Petit of the 50u Foot were both badly wounded with that gallant regiment. Captain John Fislier, Commandant of the Sirmoor Battalion, fell at the head of his valiant little corps, respected and lamented by the whole army. I have now to make the attempt, difficult, nay impracticable though I deem it, of expressing in adequate terms, my sense of obligation to those who especially aided me by their talents and self-devotion in the hard- fought field of Sobiaon. First, Right Honorable Sir, you must permit me to speak of yourself. Before the action, 1 had the satisfaction of submitting to you my plan ot attack, and I cannot describe the support winch 1 derived from the circumstance of its having in all its details met your approbation. When a soldier of such sound judgment and matured ex perience as your Excellency assured me that my projected operation deserved success, I could not permit myself to doubt that, with the blessing of Divine Providence, the victory would be ours. Nor did your assistance stop here : though suffering severely from the effect! ot a fall, and unable to mount on horseback without assistance, your uncontrollable desire to see this Army once more triumphant, carried you into the hottest of the fire, filling all who witnessed your exposure to such peril at once with admiration of the intrepidity that prompted it and an xiety for your personal safety, involving so deeply in itself the interesti and happiness of British India. I must acknowledge also my obligations to you for having, whilst I was busied with another portion of our operation^ su perintended aH the arrangements that related to laying our bridge across the Sutlej n-ar Ferozpoor. Our prompt appearance on this bank of the river after victory, and advance to this place, which has enabled us to surprise its fort, and encamp without opposition in one of the strongest positions in the country, is the result of this invaluable assistance. The Majors -General of Divisions engaged, deserve far more commendation than 1 am able, within the limits of a dispatch, to bestow. Major General Sir Robert Dick, as I have already related, has fellen on a field of renown worthy oi his Military career and services, and the affectionate regret of his country will follow him to a soldier's grave. In his attack on the enemy's left, Vlajor-General Sir Harry Smith displayed the same valor and judgment which gave him the victory of Alliwal. A more arduous task has, seldom, if ever been assigned to a division. Never has an attempt been more gloriously carried through. —■ I want words to express my gratitude to Major General Gilbert. Not only have I to record that in this great ftuht all was achieved by him which, as Commander-in-Chief, I could desire to have executed ; not only on this day was his division enabled by his skill and courageous example to triumph over obstacles from which a less ardent spirit would have recoiled as insurmountable, but since the hour in which our leading columns moved out of Um- ballah, 1 have found in the Major General an Officer who has not merely carried out all ray orders to the letter, but whose Zealand tact have enabled him in a hundred instances to perform valuable services inexact anticipation of my wishes. 1 beg explicitly to recommend him to your Excellency's especial notice as a divisional commander of the highest merit. Major General Sir Joseph Thackwell has established a claim on this day to the rare commendation of having achieved much with a Cavalry force, where the duty to be done consisted entirely of an attack on field works usually supposed to be the particular province of Infantry and Artillery. His vigilance and activity throughout our opera tions and the superior manner in which our out-post duties have been carried on under his superintendence, demand my warmest acknowledgments. Brigadier Stacy, C. B., 1 must commend to your special protection and favor'. : On him devolved the arduous duty of leading the first.column to the attack, turning the enemy's right, encountering his fire, before his numbers tiDfl been thinned, or his spirit broken, and, to use a phrase which a soldier like your Excellencv will comprehend, taking off the rough edge of the Sikhs in the fight. How ably, how gallantly, how successfully, this was done. I have before endeavoured to relate. I feel certain that Brigadier Stacy and his noble troops will hold their due 1 olace in your Excellency's estimation, and that his merits will meet with fit reward.( 263 ) Biigadier tlrclmrd, e. b , in consequence of the only Kegiment under his Command, that was entaced in thp on, being wuli Brigadier Stacy's Brigade, attached himself to it, and shared all its dangers, glories aud success ,VhiCh BriS '' ii ' ;r W ' k ' nSOn 8U ''P 0ncd ar.
