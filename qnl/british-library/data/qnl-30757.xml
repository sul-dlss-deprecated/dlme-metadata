I myself am of opinion from the wording of the article and Protocol that neither party can give notice of any altera tion before the expiration of 12 years i.e. before 19th March 1003 and that 13 years must have elapsed before such alteration can tame effect-but in order to avoid any possi ble misunderstanding I think it advisable to make this re ference and if you should be of opinion that notice oi ter mination or revision of the Treaty can be given on 19th March 1902 I have the honor to suggest that the attention of His Majesty* s Government may be drawn to the fact in case there may be any contemplated revision of the Treaty which will re quire discussion with His Highness the Sultan.

Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No:144, dated the 10th August 1901 t regarding the Commercial Treaty with His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. 2. The Government of India agree that the Treaty will not expire until the 19th March 1904. They do not ,however, concur in your view that the 12 months notice of revision or termination cannot he given till that date. The effect' of this interpretation would he to make the duration of the Treaty 13 years, while the intention was that the durationduration should be limited to 12 years, ' after whirl U_ shouleLhe^t erminable at 12 months not in #. ' The words quoted, read with Article XXIII of the Treaty, must be he la to Vide second paragraph of despatch fr the Secretary of Statefor India No 41, (Secret) y dated the 23th Decern 1890, mean that f after the expiration of 12 years } the Treaty is either terminable or subject to revision at any date, if 12 months previous notice is given .Therefor e, if such notice is given on the 20th March 1903, tne Treaty would terminate or be open to revision on the 19th March 1904, when the 12 years expire. You should inform the Sultan accordingly. I have etc (Sa) J t B. Wood, Under Secretary to the Govt, of India(COPY) No: 144 of 1901. British Residency ana Consulate-General, Bushire, 10th Auqust 1901.

Cap tail Cox ana the Cult an both appear to be of opinion that the Treaty came into force on the 19th March 1891, the aate Hp on which it was signed at Muscat. In Art. XXII t however- -iius cannot be given until the expiration of the 12 years during which the Treaty is to remain in force. This yjoula seem to be the intention of His Majesty's Government as expressed in the correspondence forwarded with your Confidential letter No:293 E., dated 11th February 1891. I have the honour to solicit the orders of the Government of India on both the questions above referred to . I have etc: (Sd) C. A. Kemball , Offg: Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. of the Treaty it is held down that 'the Treaty shall come into opeartion within one month after the aate when the ratification may take place”, and the ex change of ratifications having taken place on the 20th February 1892, the date on which the Treaty is considered to have come into force should be I think oi'C 19th larch 1892. If this is the case the Treatij will not expire until the 19th March 1904. The second question has reference to the date on which notice of termination or revision of the Treaty may be given. It appears to me that Captain Cox's view is correct ana that the 12 months notice requiredNo 520 of 1903 .

British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, Octooer 1903. From Lieut-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C. I. E., Off9 Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Political Agent and H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. With reference to Foreign Department letter No 1874- E. dated 14:th August 1903 regarding the existing Commer cial Treaty with Muscat, I have the honor to inform you that I shall be glad to be favoured with your views in the matter in due course. I have the honor to be Persian Gulf.August 1911. Your demi-official letter No.45, dated 30th July, regard ing the Muscat Treaty It is, inevitably, a tedious task to get things into shape, but it has to be done now as the Secretary of State is pressing ior it, and you will realise that Government cannot be expected, and that it is not possible for me, to deal with the Sultan's desiderata or your comment on them as at present put up. Some ot the latter I think you must have recorded without looking at the Arabic of the existing treaty on which the Sultan's wording was based, and you have consequently been beset in some cases with unnecessary doubts as to the motives underlying his amendments. My experience of His Highness and indeed of hoc genus orane, and yours too I expect, is that the more cut and dried the fom in which they see things the easier they are to deal with. You doubtless have an Arabic copy of the existing treaty - or,if not * can borrow His Highness's, and if you put up article by article to Him in the form I suggest, I do not see how he can well re fuse to do the necessary. It was never my intention to suggest jor S.g.ahox, C.I.E., Political Agent, Muscat.that you should ask him 'to fix a day for the discussion of the treaty', as you write. What I meant was, get each article ready in parallel oolumns one by one so that His highness can see at a glance (i) the text of the old treaty, and (ii) the difference suggested by us, and can then add a third version showing the article as he wants it, without altering the ori ginal form more than necessary. After the exchange of a com munication or two through your Munshi, who I suppose sees him every day as of old, if there remains any further point to dis cuss with him or talk him into, go over and see him; make sure that he understands at all events obvious objections which put his suggestion out of Court (suoh as the provisions of the French or American treaties), and after reducing his views to their final shape, record or get him to record them in a third column and post the artiole to me with your own views. Then take up the next article. There are good many articles which he practically does not want to alter at all. In others he wants innovations which one will want to know the effect and object of before being in a position to report to Government. If necessary I will come down when you have put up all the articles if there seems anything in regard to which a talk with him or you would be of use, but it is of no use my doing so until matters have advanced further than they are now. I do not altogether understand your apprehensions regard ing the possible'denunciation' of the treaty by the Sultan. The contingency does not seem to me to come within the view of praotioal politics, in the first place, as I read the treaty,he has at present only given notice for revision, and would have to give a fresh notice and another 12 months 1 warning before he G °uld tear up the treaty. But as a matter of fact, what would such a denunciation amount to ? He has got other engagements with us which we no doubt have every intention of seeing respected and I should say if he were to do anything so theatrical and ridiculous as to say he denounced the treaty, he would forthwith lose his billet. There is nothing to prevent us that I see from deposing him and putting up some one else. In the first place, no doubt, we should stop his subsidy and give him an ultimatum as we did before. Similarly if he wastes time unduly over the discussion of the revised text, we should^I presume, tell him that he can de lay as long as he likes but that meanwhile we should enforce adherence to the terms of the treaty. You will gather from the foregoing that I should not ap prove of your asking him the question, or requesting the pro mise^ contemplated on page 2 of your letter under reply, or of your taking up that line in any way. Please try and tackle him article by article as I have suggested if you can devise no better means of arriving at the necessary result; I am sure it is not the least use, especially in this weather, attempting to attack the instrument as a whole. I send you my copy of his proposals and your notes with rough pencil marginal notes in case they may be of use.

The volume features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary of State for India; the Permanent Under-Secretary for India; the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; officials of the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Government of India.Related matters of discussion include the following: proposed amendments to the initial treaty, which was executed by Colonel Edward Charles Ross, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, without the British Government's full authority, on 18 April 1890; proposals from the Secretary of State for India (Richard Assheton Cross, Viscount Cross) for the treaty, once amended, to be limited to a term of twelve years, after which it should be terminable at twelve months' notice; the conclusion of the amended treaty and the signing of a supplementary declaration, in which the Sultan of Muscat [Sayyid Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd] pledges not to sell any portion of his territory to any party except the British Government; revisions and amendments to the original 1891 treaty, proposed in 1903 and 1911.In addition to correspondence, the volume includes the following treaty-related items: the Arabic text of the 1890 version of the treaty (ff 4-11); copies of the aforementioned declaration, written in English and Arabic, and dated 20 March 1891 (f 33); an English translation of a draft treaty, prepared by the Sultan in May 1911 (ff 60-88).Also discussed towards the end of the volume is the Muscat Order-in-Council (1915), a copy of which is included (ff 92-100).There is no material covering the periods 1892-1900, 1904-1910 and 1912-1914.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1891)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Muscat Order in Council</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
