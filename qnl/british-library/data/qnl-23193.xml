You will notice from the Arabic of Alan No:5 of 1351, which incidentally is not clear in its wording,that the statement is simply made that debts against divers are postponed until ifter the diving season. There is nothing to convey the intention that this should only apply to Bahrain subjects. 1 think you will agree that in practice it is impossible omiesirable to apply a moratorium to one section of trie divers without equally extending it to others and that this would place an unnecessary burden upon the nakhudas. You may recall tliat on a former occasion by Proclamation No: 1929/17 of 1343 the Bahrain Government applied,v/hat amounted to a moratorium to divers also without consulting this Agency. Should there be no objection 1 would be glad if in future such matters could be discussed with the Political Agent and an agreement arrived at before the issue of these decrees,since it is clearly undesirable that different treatment should be meted out by the Courts in Bahrain.

I discussed generally with the Adviser the extent to which it was desirable that regulations of the Bahrain Government should be shown to the Agency before issue,and ne will continue,as has been done,I understand,in the past,to send in any important matter to the Agency before issue. 4. It was,of course,difficult to make any exact rule, as clearly the Agency does not want to be worried with petty* domestic matters. Indeed,! am in favour of any State Government governing for itself so tar as possible. ± b.

Shaiidi Jasem has lost his eyesight since seven or eight years. He is very old and consequently a prey to forgetfulness. Sometimes back there was a claim against him in which the plaintiff produced a large number of receipts bearing the seal of Shaikh Jasem. The total claim according to the receipts amounted to some thousands of rupees. Shaikh Jasem denied the claim saying that he was totally unaware of passing those receipts. After examina tion it was proved that hhe seal-marxs borne by the receipts were from the seal of Shaikh Jasem but the Shaikh attributed it to the temporary losing of the seal. The above case was tried by the Bahrain Court and a similar one was tried by the Agency Court. In view of the fact that Shaikh Jasem rendered his services to the Government for more than half a century the Bahrain Government is taxing every precaution to safeguard his property. l£. /■ 3*.Nationality and The Government of Bahrain has registered him as such, so he is now considered as a Bahrain subject.
