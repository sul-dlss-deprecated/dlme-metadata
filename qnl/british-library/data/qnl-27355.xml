The Sir, I have the honour to forward a Memorandum, prepared by the Arab Bureau on the Arab question as relating to the Sherif of Mecca and other Arab parties. This it is hoped will serve to explain the position in which we find ourselves today vis A vis the Arab parties. Read in conjunction with papers, which I pro- nose to sub lit by next vail on the subject ofi 'those purely Turkish parties who are now in opposition to the Committee of Union £nd rogress regime, they will ass ist to form an appreciation of the present situation and the attitude which it is desirable we should assume in the future, in the light of the relations now exist ing between the various parties interested in the fate of the Ottoman Kmpire. It is hoped, further, that it will be clear from the statements that undue insistemce on any p- rtlcilar programme of final solution, and still nore tho pre mature divulgenos to the Arabs of such a programme may act deleteriously on the present state of comparative quiescence in which this question now is and on the joint interests of the Allies. Ii should be observed that no guarantees which could give Right Honourable, Sir inward Grey, Bart.,«C.Q. 1 etc etc etc.the Turkish-speaking districts of Alexandretta and eastern Cilicia* But, after a second letter from the Sherif, dated 9th September, complaining of the lukewarm reception accorded to his overture, the High Commissioner replied late in October definitely asking for the exclusion, not only of the &amp;ersina and Alexandretta districts, but also of portions of Syria lying west of the districts of Damascus,Homs, Hama and Aleppo* With these modifications and subject to existing treaties of ours with Arab Chiefs, he pledged Great Britain to recognise and support Arab independence in those portions of the area agreed in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the Interests of her Al^ France; to guarantee the inviolability of the Holy Places; and to give all possible help and advice towards the establishment of n the most suitable forms of Government in the various 'territories”, on the condition that Great Britain be the sole foreign adviser and only her advisers and officials (if any) be requisitioned in these territories* But he made a final reservation of the vilayets of Baghdad and Basra, as necessar ily to be subject to 'special measures ta of (British) 'Administrative control'• The Sherif in his reply, under date 5th November, accepted unreservedly the exclusion of the 'vilayet of Mersina and Adana'(sic), but did not accept the exclusion of any part of Syria. He expressed himself willing to concede provisionally to British Administration the 'districts now occupied by 'British troops' in Irak, An consideration of some pecuniary indemnity and without prejudice to the rights of either contracting party* Farther, he engaged that our standing agreements with Arab chiefs should be respected, if we engaged not to interfere in Arab internal affairs, and he stipulated that we,for our part, undertake not to make peace with our present enemies, without securing Arab independence.—3— •31' r ^ quAniuJ In his reply of I7th December, the High Commissioner gave the desired undertaking about peace terms; acknowledged the Sherif f s agreement in the Mersina-Adana question; deferred the further discussion of all Syrian questions in deference to France; and hinted that Great Britain 1 s interests in the vilayet of Baghdad would require good assurance that any autonomous government to be established there should be 'stable and friendljr” • For the present the consideration of this matter must be postponed. He further warned the Sherif that the strength and permanence of our whole agreement ,nust depend on the nature and quality of the Arabs 1 co-operation in active measures in the meantime. In a verbal message sent with the letter, he expressed his opinion that some such arrangement as the Sherif had outlined, in regard to Irak, might be submitted to our Home government when the time should come. On January 1st,IS16,the Sherif replied agreeing to leave the precise financial terms on which we should hold Irak to us; but reiterating his claim that the area of Arab independence must include Beirut and district. Since the last date, questions about the boundaries or the constitution of the Independent Arab area have been left wholly aside and subsequent communications have had reference only to means and measures for action on the part of the Sherif and the Arabs with a view to expelling the (Turks. The Sherif has pledged himself to take such action in consideration of the assurances we have actually given and without stipulating for any more. He holds out hopes of taking the field in earnest about the beginning of May. At this stage it may be as well to set out what each high contracting party has not agreed tos- The Sherif,for his part, has not agreed to:- 1. The exclusion of Alexandretta (which is in the Vilayet of Aleppo) or any part of Syria from the area of Arab independence. 2. Permanent alienation of any part of Irak or even the temporary concession to us of any province,except that of Basra ('districts now (Hov 5) occupied by British troops').3. Ottoman or other foreign suzerfli^nty over any pert of the area* A. H. We f for our part, have not agreed to:- 1. Do more than approve an Arab Caliphate, if set up by the Arabs themselves* 3. Hecognise Arab independence in Syria,west of the line &lt; Aleppo-Hama-Homs-Damascus or in any other portion of the Arab area in which we are not free to aot without detriment to the interests of our Ally,France. 3* Hecognise any single political chief of the independent Arab area, or the subjection of any Arab chief to any other* 4. Set any term to our occupation of Irak; define the conditions on which we are to hold any part of it; or limit our occupation to the Vilayet of Basra alone* 5. Annul the extra-territorial privileges of foreigners. What has been agreed to,therefore, on behalf of Great Britain is:- 1. To recognise the independence of those portions of the Arab speaking irmn area in which we are free to act without detriment to the interests of France, Subject to these undefined reservations, the said area is understood to be bounded B. by about Lat 37°,east by the Persian frontier, south by the Persian Gulf and.Indian Ocean, west by the Eed Sea, A the Mediterranean up to. about Lat 33 c and beyohd oy an indefinite line drawn inland west of Damasous,Homs,Hama and Aleppo; all that lies between this last line and the Mediterranean being, ii]|any case, reserved absolutely for future arrangement with the French and the Arabs* Within the above independent area we have also excepted:- 1 . Aden and district, as our Imperial possession* a, Irak (Vilayets of Basra and Baghdad) as to be in partd leased to and administered by us f and in other part, subject to our control in some degree and manner: Ae to hold government in the several districts of the area as may be suitable to each. To approve of an Arab Caliphate vice the Ottoman Caliphate, shouild the Arabs succeed in establishing one satisfactorily. To give advice to, and find personnel to assist in, the administration of Arab districts should their constituted governments, when formed, so desire; but not otherwise to interfere in the internal affairs of the area, provided that our existing treaties with Arab Chiefs are not violated by the autonomous governments. ]?inally,it should be observed that the Sherif though he has always written as spokesman of the Arab nation, is not, so far as we know, supported by any organization of Arabs nearly general enough to secure throughout, or indeed in the larger part of, the Arab area, the automatic acceptance of terms agreed to by him. Efo such organization exists at the back of any Arab whatever; nor, given the history, economic environment and character of the Arabs, can it be expected to exist. The best that can be said is that the Sherif has a wider influence, outside his own particular territorial district (which includes most of northwestern Arabia) than any other Arab potentate: that his house is the most enlightened of actual Arab ruling houses and commands the greatest resources of various kinds; and that alone of Arab Prinoes, he enjoys spiritual consideration in some degree or other, throughout the world of Islam. If any part of Irak, not by imperial right, but under concession from the Arabs. 2. To assist the Arabs:- (a) To Obtain their independence in that area. (b) To set up and maintain such forms of autonomous{ \ —6— we are to treat with aiiy one Arab prinoe about the future of the Arab peoples, we are bound to prefer the Sherif. But, in the actual default of general organization of those peoples, it would be futile to treat with hi- alone and to assume that, through him, we could influence and bind all the Arabs* It is, therefore, not only legitimate but advantageous that negotiations, on the same lines and based on the same general principles as those conducted with the Sherif, should go forward with other Arabian potentates such as the Emir of Riadh and El Idrisi; or be initiated with others, such as the Yemen. So long as Arab independence of the Turks, and autonomous governments suitable to the several districts, are the basal principles in such negotiations, they cannot conflict with our engagements to the Sherif or be regarded by him or others as detrimental to the Arab cause. Although positive anti-Ottoman action on a considerable scale has not yet been taken as a result of our negotiations with the Shorif, it must be pointed out that their negative result is wholly satisfactory. Through them, in a most critical year of war, we have not only secured the benevolent neutrality of a very powerful Moslem influence, but also caused serious embarrassments to our enemy and deferred or defeated the realization of large plans for arraying Moslem hostility against us, which might have rendered our position in the East far less favourable than it is today. /In any further communication on the subject, please quote No - 8a213/X. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, 4 London.

We presume that stoppage of communications between Soudan and Hedjaz alone would not meet the case. If blockade is approved we propose issuing necessary orders without any explanatory announcement at present.

As to the Second. It is i^ecessary for us to. prepare to recruit a large number* of men v (t if’ in tue force io tionod. in article 4 t as it affects the troops whose movements we have referred to in article 3*), in; iodlately after the declaration of the rising so as to bring to a fulfilment v/nat we have* mentionod at)ove* Hio importance of this and its good effect will be obvious to you, tod. since, praise be to lod, the coaBtfiljr is able to contribute more than a quarter of a million men from the districts which are connected with us only, there is no objection to arrangements being made for a considerable number of ar t over c.nd anove what hns. been mentioned ' before, uo be kept in rtrerva hs a precautioiinry iacasure in, case of necessity.. There is no need to repeat what is required in such operations in tie way of money stores or ammunition which tie country is unable to produce at present or (to dwell either) the importance of keeping the matter secret untiluntil the time for divulging it arrivoc or on the inability of the country to provide such necessities by itself. ( &lt;ote the meaning of th# Arabic is obscure). Yea, 0 Honourable .inister, ay God illumine our minds, verily tills movement which is essential for the country, whose 'hole future life defends on it, hie been planned and its conditions decided upon in accordance with its powers, and nothing is left to the strength of the peoples firm resolution but to hasten to put it into practise and to seize the opportunity and to do what has been mentioned in the previous letter, to engage a part of the forces which are overpowering Islam. In ny opinion, neith r of these two cases could be considered a justification for asking Great Britain for the provisions an* jthcr 1 ;s which we have recently demanded aid (I say this) in the hope that it may not be said that the neutrality of the country and its material and si-iritualeffect have a value v/hich it is u ;C r-' to osfcl HU ( '• - S PMM e i - v r;/ obscure. It may mean that he has written the above so that it may not be said tnat it is of no importance whether ftis country remains neutral or not) In the beginning and in conclusion accept my best respect and salutations.

Following from Clayton for Sykes:-- to 15 JUN1916 I qo not consider presence in London of any Arab officers with whom we are at present in touch would in nny way assist you. Owing to intimate connection between all parties interested in solution of Turkish and Arab question in Syria I deprecate strongly partial treatment of (? matter) with any single group or groups none of whom moreover are in a position to speak representa tively. Certain developments here closely affect your pro posals and raise possibility of Turkish decentralisa tion parties putting forward proposals capable of being brought into accord with aims of all other parties, Allies included, proposals which it might suit Allies to consider. Presence in dgypt of Picot at present juncture would inevitably raise among various parties latent hostility to French influence which so 'far we have kept quiescent and which march ‘of ^vfents may not im possibly remove.

A certain rapprochment between the Arabs and Turk's^decentralisation parties is now evident which /disloyalty/on the part of Arabs to Christian penetra- tion is bound to strengthen. nn attractive oifer by such Turkish parties would oe in serious competition to any proposals Allies can i, put forward. Aliy agreement on main principles between Allies i ctn.1 to ohe good, but to divulge it at present and to insist on any particular programme would I am con vinced be to raise considerable feeling, to strengthen Arab-Turkish rapprochnent, and possibly to affect in juriously political a xl military situation of Allies in Turkey at a moment when true attitude of Arabs is hot quite clear. In view of hoped for development of war on the part of Shereef as a result of our past negotiations with him I feel it would be most impolitic to raise now with Arabs Syrian question which is quiescent for the moment. To do so would I am convinced be contrary to interests both of ourselves and French, who haveeverything to gain by delay, in view oi hostile sentiments which they must overcome before reaching satisfactory settlement of question. You will see a telegram which High Commissioner is sending in a day or two to Foreign Office which will explain my reference to Turkish decentralization parties. t It is impossible to explain in a telegram various developments which have taken place since you left and I think that it is very desirable that you should come here yourself to take views of High Commissioner on situation as it stands to-day. I trust Picot will not return here until situation has reached phase when Syria can be discussed, with Arab parties without jeopardis ing success of a general settlement. I should be glad to learn that agreement which you have arrived at is definite and accepted as binding by three Governments concerned or merely .a proposal consequent on your conversations with Picot and at Petrograd'.^lie ,imes of India”, Thursday, February 24, 1916. the haj pilgrimage. A Bombay Government Press Note, issued on Wednesday, states:- Last year 2,433 pilgrims proceeded to Jeddah on tne Haj pilgrimage. Up to the commencement of December, 1915, 1.309 pilgrims in all had returned to Bombay, and it was reported that about 1,900 persons, including pilgrims of the previous Haj, were desirous of returning to India, and that among this number there were about 1,000 pilgrims, cniefly derelicts of the season of 1913-14, who were unable to pay for their return passage to India. Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Company, on being approached by Government in the matter, agreed to despatch their steamer Akbar from Calcutta to Jeddah to bring back these pilgrims to Bombay, and issued instructions to their agents at Jeddah to despatch by the vessel, free of charge, as many indigent pilgrims as could be carried in addition to those who either held return tickets or were able to pay for their passage. The Akbar arrived at Bombay at the end of last month with 1,237Jo pilgrims, leaving about 700 piLrrims still to be repatriatea. Although trie season was over and there were strong reasons for believing that practically none of the pilgrims remaining in Jeddah would be able to pay for their passage, Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Company despatched their steamer Akbar a second time to Jeddah specially to bring back these pilgrims. The Oovernor-in-Council highly appreciates the very valuable assistance which the Company have rendered to these indigent hajis, and has much pleasure in bringing it to the notice of the Mahomedan community and of the public generally. Of the 1,763 persons to whom return tickets were issued by the Company, 1,711 have already returned to Bombay.1/ | [Ttiis Document is t h e Property of His Britannic Majesty’s CoTernment, and should bg returned to the Foreign Office wfagp dono with ( unless required for official use ,] EGYPT O t 1403 /,/a K 'gz) Decypher POLITICA L r Sir He McMahon (Cairo) April ISthe 1916, Dr 2r40rprin r He JeOOrprn* NOr 272 pjy telegram IlOe 268 w Letter has 'been received from Shereet dated March 29the acknowledging my last and assuming that assist ance requested in his letter February 18thc has oeoj. prepared by His Majesty’s Governments He urges strict blockade of Yemen coast beginning from Jeddah and states that Syria(?ns) can neither engineer revolution nQr seize Hedjaz railway owing to dispersal of chiefs but will not oppose Hedjaz Arabsr Shereef also urges (?advisability of) helping Anaizeh Arabs financially and further encloses letter which he is forwarding through Idrisi to Imam Yehia calling on latter to oust Turkish troops from his country, make peace with IdrSsi (for which he offers him arbitration) and stop bloodshed at Lahej, Original documents have not yet been received here but full summary as telegraphed from Sudan (rsent cy bag) yesterdayc -V [ nts Docnmcnt Is the Prapeily feV His'BHtannic Many's' Government, th is Document is the Pr&lt;»pCTfy of His 'Britannic uoverpmant, and should be returned to the Fo reign Office when done with fe unless required for official use.l r p| i ^ O J / 4 ft EGYPT .

Mr.Chamberlain is in communication with the G. of I. on the subject of the mission of El Faruki, and possibly of El Masri, to Mesopotamia; and he wishes to suggest that it would be convenient if this Office could be consulted before orders are issued on such matters, since it is in possession of previous correspondence which frequently throws a light on present proposals. With reference to the instructions sent to Sir H.McMahon regarding the assurances to be given to El Faruki and El Masri Mr. Chamberlain desires to point out that in his letter of July 1915 the Grand Shereef purported to speak for the 'Arab Kingdom of the Shereef\ while in that of 1st January 1916 he expresslyFormally acknowledgedDRAFT TELEGRAM.

His Majesty’s Government must take steps to pro tect their own interests,. Real reason for this action is to excite hostile feeling against Turks and Germans,. Shereef has decided that rising should begin in Asir this cutting communication with Yemen and he wishes us to blockade the coastline of Asir very carefully* Rising will begin at end of coming Arabic month or at beginning of month after and will be carried on strictly in conjunction with Idrisic Shereef will inform us with regard to ammunition or provisions which he requires by messengers to Port Soudan who will transfer them to places which he men tions on Arabian Coastr In conclusion he lays great stress on absolute secrecy,.

I send herewith for your, information a copy of a memorandum, I recorded for Army Commander, regarding my interview with Bin Saud on 26th December. Note regarding interview with — (.Z) Bin Saud on 26th December 1915. [2) Shaikh of Kuwait on 31st December 1915. With reference to recent reports from various sources, the following is the gist of the views expressed by Ibn S^ud during my meeting with him on 26th December. It is $rue that he received a slight flesh wound in the recent fighting with the Aiman but it did not lay him up and is now quite healed. He expressed a much more colourless opinion regarding the reported activities of the Turks m Central Arabia than that imparted by his late doctor to the Political Agent at Bahrain. He says there is no doubt that the Turks are taking advantage of recent develop ments in Europe and the suspension of our advance towards Baghdad in order to endeavour to rekindle tribal and religious feding against us, but he does not believe that there will be f much result, and as far as Iraq is concerned is confident that some measure of unrest which at present prevails will subside as soon as we move on again. With reference to the rumour of the intended purchase of forty thousand camels by the Turks, he states that the popular report is that they are required firstly for the transport of ' grain to Constantinople and then for military transport towards Egypt. He discredits these stories and believes the explanation to be that the Turks are endeavouring to bribe tribal Shaikhs generally to co-operate with them and find that the bribe is more easily digested if offered as an advance “ for investment in camels or horses in case the Government should require them.” He says he received an overture in this form a few months ago. He seems to have been somewhat exaggerating in his conversations with the Political Agent, Bahrain, before my arrival and admits that he has no accurate news yet regarding the whereabouts of Ibn Rashid. He says that it is certain that he has moved out of Hail, but how far, and whether to the west or east, he does not yet know. As, however, it w-'uld be a natural course for Bin Rashid to endeavour to harass him in Kasim, he has sent his brother on ahead to maintain vigilance in that quarter while he himself proceeds to his capital at Riyaz in order to be sure that unrest created by Turkish emissaries does not spread among his tribesmen. The letters which he intercepted in transit from Bin Rashid and Ajaimi to some of his disaffected relatives and the Ajman Shaikhs do not amount to much and he does not really regard them seriously, his behef being that Ibn Rashid would not dare to advance too far either towards Kuwait or Nasiriyah for fear lest Bin Saud should cut in against Hail, in his rear. He believes that this tall talk will subside when we advance again, and says that in any case the advance of any large force at present is out of the question owing to the absence of rain and grazing. He thinks it is more probable that Bin Rashid will begin making overtures to him and, if he does, he, Bin Saud, will offer to be reconciled with him on condition that he comes over to us or, failing that, agrees to remain absolutely neutral. If Bin Rashid will not accept either of these conditions, he, Bin Saud, will attack him and incite the ' Anaizeh to attack him also. In the event of our wanting him to co-operate actively in the direction of Basrah or Nasiriyah, Bin Saud says he could move up towards Kuwait and Zubair, but not towards Nasiriyah, as the grazing and watering places on that line ^are out of his tribal sphere and his action would arouse hostility. He recommends our making much of Hamud bin Suwait and the Zaiyad Shaikhs and employing them to hold the desert on the Nasiriyah side. As regards the Sherif, he said his present relations with him were quite normal and friendly but that the Sherif was essentially a trivial and unstable character and could never be depended upon. There was no truth in the former reports that the Sheriffs son had moved towards Hail with a large force to co-operate with Bin Rashid and he did not credit the present reports pointing to any active understanding between the Sherif and Bin Rashid. As regards the recent movement of Sheriffs son towards Kasim, he thought it was quite conceiv able that having learnt that Bin Saud was having trouble with the Ajman the Sherif had sent his son up to fish in troubled waters, but that in any case when the son reached Kasim he realised that Bin Saud was getting the better of the Ajman and abandoned any unneigh- bourly intentions which he may possibly have had. All he did was to punish a section of the Ataiba who had refused to pay Zakat and then return home.2 Sounded as to the general question of the Calphate m the event of Turkey breaking up, he said tde Wn view was that as far as the Ruling Chiefs of Arabia were concerned, no one cared in the least who called himself Caliph, and renunded me that the Wahabis did not recognise anv Caliph after the first four. Asked if he thought the Sher.f was likely to claim JTbSLe Caliph, he said he had no knowledge but that it was conceivable; but that in any case his calling himself Caliph would not make any difference to his status among other Chiefs and there would be no question of their accepting any control from him any more than they do now. Each individual Chief would continue, in his opinion, to control his own afiairs and his own tribes as hitherto, with this exception, please God, that they would in future be immune from Turkish oppression. He added that there was no doubt a certain amount of talk about the Caliphate in. Cairo presumably because of the presence of a Sultan but as far as the Jezirat-al-Arab was concerned, he did not consider that the question had any significance or interest for them. In «peakin°- 4s above. Bin Sand was no doubt inclined to think that his own point of view was the general one ; but the opinions he expresses only bear out the generel impres sion which we have gained on this side of Arabia since the beginning of the war, viz, that thp question of the Caliphate has no serious interest for the tribes or their Chiefs. At Sea ; 27th December 1915. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel. Later. On 31st December I had a meeting with the Shaikh of Kuwait, Shaikh Jabar bin Mubarak, and in the course of conversation sounded him on the same subjects. As regards Bin Rashid he said his latest news was that he was still in Hail or close by ; that it was most unlikely that he would move in the direction of Kuwait or Zubair and that if he showed any intention of so doing, he, Shaikh Jabar, would get news of it at once. He said that Bin Rashid was weak now. As regards the Ajman, who had taken refuge with his late father and been given “ haz wa bakht ” by him much to Bin Saud's annoyance, he said that he had already received a letter from Bin Saud (which he sent for and read out and which was couched in most cordial terms) explaining that he could not agree to the Ajman being forgiven, and asking him (Shaikh Jabar) not to harbour them in or near Kuwait; and that in pursuance of Bin Sand’s request, he had told the Ajman to clear out. According to him, the Ajman could muster about 2,000 armed men, of whom probably 200 were mounted ; and they would, no doubt, he thought, endeavour to get protection from Bin Rashid ; but they were completely broken for the present; their camels and horses quite worn out and useless, and it would be two or three months at least before they were worth anything. Sounded, during conversation regarding the war, as to his opinion regarding^he Caliphate in the event of Turkey breaking up, he evinced general ignorance of the subject, but was emphatic in the view that neither he nor his dependents had any interest whatever in the question. As for himself, all he was concerned with was his duty to the British Govern ment to whom he and his father owed so much, and the good administration of his territory. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel.

February 7th, 1916, Sir:- I have the honour to forward and recommend to your perusal a Memorandum entitled 'The Politics of Mecca” which lias been addressed to me by the Director of Intelligence. The Memorandum while revealing nothing definitely new, appears to be a clear and able statement of the position of iaherif Hussein and of the attitude which he has adopted in his relations with the various states of the Arabian Peninsula.WJ THE POLITICS OF MECCA. ds) HAIL . £LMi \x \ uic aim of the Sherif Hussein, since midsummer of last year, has been to reconcile all the Arab poxers in Arabia; to do this, it was first necessary to persuade them to abandon all side-issues. his missives to Ibn fiashid had not much success. The Emir could not refrain from making forays into tne rear of Ibn oaoud’s dominions, while he was away In the Hasa. aherlf Abdulla did, how- 6ver t 8 ucc 0 Gd in (iefgat/ing t»he counsels or 'th© Turco- phil advisers at HAIL, wty&gt; were advocating common action with the Turks and the Muntefik against the British, ^ Ibn Rashid round several of his more power ful supporters against the proposed move, and the split intensified to such an extent, that several Ateiba sheikhs left HAIL, and returned in Abdullah train to Mecca, ^ Between the Sherlf and the uahabi power there has been a truce of late. This is perhaps natural, as the Wahabis are too weak at present to cause the aherif any apprehension. There is little doubt how ever, that there will be a clash between them again, if Ibn aaoud grows really strong. The misdeeds of the Y&lt;ahabis, a century ago, when they laid waste the Holy Places of Islam, ill-treated the Imams, and prevented the pilgrimage, united the whole of Islam against them, and spurred even the Egyptians into undertaking a campaign of extermination. The Wahabi sect, as a form of extreme puritanism, has latent / I HQsgj latent In it something of the destructive force of the Roundhead party in England, and if.it prevailed, we would have, in place of the tolerant, rather comfortable, Islam of MECCA and DAMASCUS, the fanaticism of NEJD, as described by I'algrave, intensified and swollen by success. Further, for his immediate purpose, the &gt;herif has no use for ibn oaoud. The •iherif wishes to hunt out the Turks from Arabia, and in no direction can Ibn 3aoud aid him in this object. He cannot let nahabi fighting men into the Hedjaz; there is no road for them to Yemen, nor would they go so far afield; and Ibn Rashid would not tolerate :3aoud f 8 help in the north. The Wahabi state is a purely Arab one, ringed round, and hemmed in, by deserts, and by unfriendly Arab states, with no foreign policy that touches the Turks, and no influence (except on the Gulf Coast) on any larger sphere of interests. Idrisi’s tribesmen went solid for the Wahabis at their moment of success, and therefore to the Meccans they too are in the shadow of that nightmare. Also, the rule is in Arabia that you are better dis posed to one further off, than to your neighbour. However it is, there has been for long discord between Aslr and Hedjnz, and this persisted till about nine months ago. Negotiations have since been incepted between the Sherif and the -Uirisi, and have led to a notably better feeling. The 3herif has persuaded the Idrisi to forego his futile attacks on Yemen, lie was not fighting the Turks so much as the strong border tribes, who object to be plundered by Asiri, even--Sr) (gj even in the name of an anti-Turk crusade. The Sherif looks upon the Imam as the person to carry out his ideas in Yemen, and he will eventually, if his schemes beer fruit, turn the energies of the Asir tribes north ward against the Turkish garrison of KUNF1DA and 1BHA. This Turkish force threatens the rear of the Hedjaz, and its removal is a preliminary to successful operations in the Holy Cities. fRMKN. Between the families of the aherif at MKCCA, and the Imam at KHAVIR or SANAA there is an old friendship. Politically there are clone relations between them. Xhe tfierif was the instigator of the treaty between the imam and the Turks, which transformed the Yemen from the cockpit of Arabia to a well-behaved, prosperous and semi-autonomous province. Pear of the iurisi wo,s the motive of this reconciliation of the Turk and : Arab. Of late, ^hen the lurks made their attack on ADEN, the Sherif counselled abstention to the Imam; and more recently, in a conference at the pilgrimage season, when the ImanPs brother, who represented him, urged the advantages to Arabia of enrolling all the tribes of the Aden Hinterland under the Zaidi flag, the iiherif again dissuaded him, and explained his political intentions to the Imam in a letter, which drew a satisfactory reply. The Sherif is now at work to reconcile, if only temporarily, Aalr and Yemen, in pursuance of his policy of shutting down all side- shows, and holding the whole force of what Arab states j there are, ready for a simultaneous attack on one side or the other, according as their interests seem to be j witn the Allies or against them. BOMALILANB .(*S2) The oherif is in touch with the Mullah, and has pressed on him the same counsel of inactivity, pending directions how he may beet act in conformity with the general lines of Arab politics. He has prevailed to date. -rie sends his orders and suggestions - and in the flux of Arab politics the latter are always the more potent - by letter, unsigned and unsealed. They are on clair, and if the country is quiet are carried by messengers of importance. In secret missions to the Arabs of Syria,-or to CONSTANTINOPLE he uses women to carry his letters. Public proclamations he disseminates, by writing a first draft himself, and giving it to one of hie follov/ing. The duty is laid on each recipient who can write to send out two copies. These proc lamations (gencrslly sumptuary) used to reach the ! Northern boundary of Arab speech on the Euphrates in about ten days from MEDINA, in 1913 - 1914. Sherif Hussein's brother, Nasr, is in CONSTANTINOPLE, openly on bad terms with him, and exiled from the Hedjaz. In reality, however, Nasr has a passion for intrigue, and is strongly pan-Arab. He acts as the secret agent of his brother, and handles the theological party of the Capital at his will, in favour of the ruling house of MECCA. Sherif Haidar is the great danger to Hussein. He tried some years ago to capture the headship of the Islamic and more fanatical wing of the Pan-Arabs, representing that Hussein was so lax and tolerant, and so much a statesman as to be unworthy the Khalifate. Heho over-ieached himiGelf, how€VPr f lor his own history is full of intimate relations with foreigners (Turks, British, and. others), and was confounded. He was therefore forced out of the Hedjaz, and went hack to CONSTANTINOPLE. He is ambitious, energetic, and well educated. lie has thrown himself on the Turkish side, working for &amp; reformed Islam (i.e., an Islam which sha.ll he not a faith, hut a political weapon), and iius the sworn promise of the Government that he shall succeed Hussein, as soon as the latter can he removed. 3herif Hussein is not working in the British interests, except in so far as they further the particular dreams and hopes of the political party to which he belongs. His aim is the establishment of a Khalifate (not the only one$ for himself, and independence for people speaking Arabic from their present irritating subjection to people speaking Turk. His aims are thus in definite opposition to the Pan- Islamlc party, who are his strong obstacle, and to the Young Turk party, who are however less dangerous to his schemes; his activity seems beneficial to us, because it marches with our immediate aims, the break up of the Islamic '’bloc' and the defeat and disruption of the Ottoman Empire, and because the states he would set up to succeed the Turks would be as harmless to ourselves as Turkey was before she became a tool in German hands. The Arabs are even less stable than the Turks. If properly handled they would remain in a state of political mosaic, s tissue of small jealous principal ities, incapable of cohesion, and yet always ready to combine against an outside lorce. ib.e alternative to thisthis seems to be control and colonisation by a European power other than ourselves, which would Inevitably come into conflict with the interest we already possess in the Near East. Sherif Hussein’s activites have already been oi use to us. He has held in the Imam from attacking ADEN, he has quieted the Mullah in domallland, he has divided the counsels of ibu Nashid. he has refused to preach a Jehad, or to allow tae legal jehad to be declared; he has countered, and is still countering, Turkish influence in the Hedjaz; has prevented the raising of volunteers; and has forbidden the placarding of anti British news in the public places of MECCA; all this obviously with a mind some day to taking the place of the Turkish Government in the Hedjaz, himself. If we can only arrange that this political change shall be a violent one, we will have abolished the threat of Islam, by dividing it against itself, in its very heart. There will then he a Khalifa in Turkey and a Khalifa in Arabia, in theological warfare, and Islam will be as little formidable as the Papacy when Popes lived in Avignon.833] r From Political Resident, AJen,C)th March 1910. (Addressed to h\)rei&lt;in, Delhi, repeated to P&gt;ombaij Political, Secretary of State for India, lliyh Commissioner, Cairo.) 1S6.A.P. Saiyid Mustafa, interviewed Aden, states: “ idrisi and Imam are irreconcilable; each lias Ids own ends in view. Imam is altogether pro-Turkish ; Sherrill is inwardly pro-Turk and is assisting them. What will be precise result of our union and how will it operate ? ” lie implied that Idrisi had done his share of lighting, and that Arabs are waiting for a military success on our part. He recognises the importance of fall of Krzeroom and of death of Nuri I&gt;ey. Arabs union against lurks appears chimerical, though each may move separately if supplied with a clearly defined policy from us, pecuniary aid, and military backing.

I can only say, as far as my own understanding is concerned, that, firstly, I see no neceerity to re-state tne position as retards tht boundary question, as i have already mentioned the r on cone i desired to have the matter ex- plained and the true foundation of our wide de- mands which were bated on the claims of the na tive Inhabitants of tnose parts (concerned?): secondly, the assistance which treat Britain in tends to give her friends can ot be complete or solid, unless they (the Arabs) are convinced that their future prospects are consistent with Great firitains intentions in regard to them, and this could never be the case unlets they are tiven the boundaries they ask for. the Arabian kingdom wiiich Great Britain is so anxiou s to foun d (as appears from this and the f orm r letter), and to wnicu sue is jiving tier encouragement and support, can ot exist *iuhout tnese natural boundaries, e do not conceive tliat tne riches and fertility of that country, which is in fact nothing a: compared with the rich dominions already in iier pos esion, should prevent generous Great Britain rom an swering, our demands.

It is therefore necessary to take such action as will protect British interests and at the same time will preserve all the rights of independence. There is no doubt that such candour (on our pert) should remove any reason for the British sus picions (of our designs) that have thrown us in such a state of perplexity. (This passage is very obscure). fa We have no reason for discussing the question of the Frontier other than as a preliminary measure, just as the owner of a treasure would do if he had fears of failure.

Folionirg from Sir Mark Sykes, No. IS, for Director of Military Operations. “ In accordance with your instructions I am waiting here for opportunity of seeing General Officer Commanding and High Commissioner. I have by favour of Cheetham seen correspondence re.ating to Shedffi and Arab movement. Tiro difficulties suggest themselves :— A. Want of confidence in our might on part of Arabs. B. Difficulties of making arrangements with Arabs which will be inoffensive to French susceptibilities based on historical senti ment and financial interests. As means of coping with difficulty A, I suggest as first step that we block ade Cilician sates cr deny Turkish access to Syria r»i Adana plain. As second step occupation of line Ain tab Birijek Suverek DabeHr and establish ment of tourh with Russians while Turkish and German masses are immobi- liied by Armenian and Anatolian winter snow, leaving Arabs, south of this line, to do as they please details of this scheme and quantity of troops required should reach you by 24th N’crember. Difficulty B could be coped with in following manner :—Entente to agree with Arabs to recognise, respect and protect Arab Provisional Government or Governments in Vilayets of Aleppo, Beyrout, Jerusalem, Damascus and Hedjai and TTrfa and Sand Dereor during the war and to guarantee above areas as mi^imTim independent Arab territory after war has ended. Arabs to engage not to grant concessions for period of 25 years directly or indirectly to nnanciai groups of Central Powers nor for period of 10 years to establish diplomatic relations with them (Response to?) Russia and Italy (failing?) engage not to obtain concessions in Vilayets of Beyrout, Aleppo, Sand Urfa and Damascus without approval of French Government and to recognise spirit of previous agreements between Ottoman Government and French Government with regard to educational estabiisament in same area in suggested Arab independent State or States.18 I further suggest Vilayets of Basrah and Baghdad are incapable of self- government and owing to Shiah and Sunni dissension new and weak States could not administer them. We might agree with Arabs to administer these provinces on their behalf and to allocate certain revenues to their exchequer or exchequers (this corresponding to their demand for subsidy) and further agreeing that deficit will be made good from Arab State or States in the event of population of Vilayets of Baghdad and Basrah not producing a sufficient number for administrative personnel under British supervision. I make these suggestions because I believe situation is critical. I feel that Arab nation now or in future isolated, as such, presents no danger to India unless we confine ourselves to Canal defensive and let Turk and German masses assembled in Syria and north Mesopotamia re-establish their prestige and so with Arab support work a real jehad. This would entail strong re-percussion in north Africa ? involving both Trench and Italians, thereafter in Persian and Caucasus and Afghanistan eventually engrossing under less favourable circum stances than at present a larger force of Entente troops. I submit that Russia, Armenia, (? Italy,) Prance, are all affected by this situation directly. Arabs are anti-Turkish at present and Taurus and Armenian snow hampers our enemies movements. 1 therefore believe now is chance of German plan of involving all the Entente Powers in defensive operations against Islam being foiled by us. 30 (Received under cover of Office Memorandum No. 2042, dated the 2oth November 1915, from Assistant Private Secretary to Mis Excellency the Viceroy.)

As the matter is of such vital import affecting our very life and existence, therefore, we insisted on getting further explanations in regard to these boundaries so that we might first be able to know what the views of that Government were and thus be sruided in ^ our choice of the lesser of the two evils and the easier course by which to uphold the integrity of the faith and nationality as was more befitting. Here is a clear proof of the necessity for desperate measures in seeking the happiness of attaining the holy object. I refer to the proclamation issued by the Ottomans and which was based on the Fetwa of their Sheikh of Islam, authorizing their troops to eat during the month of Kamadan last in the town of your ancestor (the Prophet) and in his holy presence. This was based merely on the supposition that they were prepared for the Uhad, while in fact they were living (quietly). Such an overt act, though but a small thing, makes further explanation in regard to the nobility of the cause decided upon unnecessary. They have at least transgressed against God and against your ancestor and his family. 'VYe may be among those believers of whom he said : “ There are men who acted in accordance -with their holy promise to God—some of them have and some are still waiting and are making changes.” This is what we have united to do. May God help us and you to hold to our word. This is the purport of what you wanted to know and I have only reproduced it in conformity with your previous request. We ask the co-opera tion of your great zeal in the cause of protecting the honour of the faith, no matter what the result of the present war may be, because you also have gieat moral and material interests to safeguard. Our inclinations, which you wish to understand, are confined within this circle and I have no doubt, honourable brother, that you are well aware of this and that I have no ambitions whatever for great names or titles. You asked me, my dear friend, may God be with you, to explain to you what we require. Our first requirements are that God may protect you from every evil, and give you always strength and good health. I also wish to be guided by your ideas with regard to our aforementioned friends who have full control of the country and as to whether they think of any necessity to make modifications in our demands as to the boundaries that have been described. If so this will be annoying, particularly to the Arabs, and very likely it will affect all the Mohammedans and oblige them to meet events, no matter whence they come, with bravery and determination at the outstart. They will then become positive that the cause for making such difficulties is the intention to exterminate the Arabs and destroy their faith and unity. I do not think in this case that there is any man who does not know that a General Call (to the jihad) in the ears of the Mahommedan world will differ from the call of the Ottomans. The Government to which I am referring could avoid the outcome of the effect produced by such a state of affairs, especially owing to the presence of a man like yourself, who allows no reason for blame in the cause of God. I have very strong and decided hopes that I am only stating in this sentence what is absolutely true with the greatest sincerity. The second question is that we shall stand in need of funds partly to be used for the preliminary expenses and the greater portion to be retained until the time when with God’s help the whole scheme is taken effectively in hand. As regards the arms, we have no need of them as this might cause some unnecessary disturbance and divulge the scheme before it bas matured. If this, however, were possible there is no objection and we must be prepared for it. We raise redoubled prayers to God from the depth of our hearts and with sincerity to defend the law of your ancestor and maintain his inspiration and his holy tomb. There is no doubt that God would be our great defender and supporter. This is the gist of what I wish to inform you and I insist on hoping that you will keep it very secret and act with the utmost wisdom and quietness. I am depending on your servant (messenger) and am taking no other steps in my dealings with our friends except through you. I am confining all cominumca-Further a treaty of alliance uith Entente Powers giving them for duration of war tree movement in Greater Arabia and use of railways in Arabian area. Entente troops in Arab tracts ( ? ) to be on same footing of British troops in hlanders. On cessation of hostilities Entente troops to evacuate territories. Faruki insisted that this was dependent on Entente landing troops at a point between Mersina and Alexandretta and making good Cilician Gates or Amanus Pass. He further stipulated that until this had been done Sheriff should not take action. I agree any other course is out of the question and that to call Arabs or Sheriff to take action until we had made above mentioned passes secure would be an impossibility. Faruki urged also necessity for immediate naval (?) action in Gulf Alexandretta, adding that Germans would forest all them if Entente did not take this opportunity and Arabs would in their own interests be forced to (?) reconsider situation once Turks or Germans got into Syria. For my own part I am sure that there can be no doubt of Arabs merely trouble Great Britain (?) Turks in advance on Canal. If we alloAv Turks into Syria Arabs will in order to obtain special consideration side with (?) them. Idea of Turco-Arabia on same lines as Austria-Hungary has already been suggested by Germans. I will give observations on less important aspects in further telegram. I am convinced of necessity meanwhile for efficient action at earliest' possible moment to enable Arabs to move. 32 Telegram P,, dated the 25th (received 26th) November 1915. From—The British High Commissioner of Egypt, Cairo, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Delhi. (Note. — Place names in following message subject to revision.) Repetition of my telegram^709 to Foreign Office, November 21st, is as follows :— Begins. Following No. 20 for Director of Military Operations from Sir M. Sykes I submit in continuation of my telegram No. 19 on hypothesis that Faruki’s interviews is basis of our arrangements with Arabs. 1 . Our task with regard to France and Arabs is to get Arabs to concede to French as much as possible and to get our Haiffa Outlet and Palestine included in our sphere of enterprise in form of French concessions to us. Thus we smooth way for France wuth Syrians and in matter where France has a traditional interest in dealings directly with her. Note. —Any extension of our sphere of enterprise will always be welcomed by Arabs. 2. I do not consider with regard to Arabia proper that proposed Arab movement affects our position with regard to Rfid Sea and Varna Gulf interests. Gulf and Aden treaties wall hold good and I am confident that suzerainty of Sheriff in Arabia proper will be purely honorary in practice. 3. With regard to our posicion in Iraq our control (?) of civil Government must hold for whole (?) duration of war and we should stipulate for this. Basrah and Baghdad provinces are divided from Arabia by schism and are too disorderly and rancourous for new-born State to control. When timeloi evacua tion comes Sheriff s Government will have to settle (.) Shiah and Iveibala ques tion and I anticipate w ill be glad enough in order to get rex enue to get us to run matters (?) for them for some time to come. ^ Arab nation isolated has little influence and Ivhalifate none south of Baghdad in cultivated area. 4 I submit for strategical and political consideration of India that so long as it is protected from German and Turkish influence by France and ourselves suggested Arab State cannot become a formidable power in itself. 0 °5 In the event of our giving Arabs their opportunity I anticipate that matters will shape themselves as follows Influx of money and trade owing to23 opening of Syrian ports will keep things quiet in Syria and Palestine and Government will be carried on with local personnel on Turkish formulas Baghdad and Basrah provinces will continue without demur to accept our provisional rule. Government of Mosul and Urfa will be disorderly and Arab State will probably have to ask for our assistance. Arabs of North Arabia proper will fight among themselves indecisively. x- the eve . nt °? our this opportunity go Arabs in Syria and A orth Mesopotamia will fall in with Turks I believe in order to get best terms for nationalist aspirations from those whom they would then regard as certnir. winners of the war. &amp; u ceilai ^ S ' G 730 F.

From—The British High Commissioner of Egypt, Cairo, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Delhi. Summary of reply from Sheriff of Mecca, dated November 5th received here November 14th, is as follows. It was not sent you before by oversight. Begins. Sheriff renounces interests in Adana Mersina but insists on retention of Aleppo Bey rout Vilayets as purely Arab tracts. He cannot abandon Irak for trading and economic reasons but in order to facilitate (?) agreement and in consideration of guarantees offered by His Majesty’s Government is prepared to “ leave for a short time under British administration those districts now occupied by British troops against suitable sum paid for period of occupation as compensation to Arab Kingdom ” without prejudice subsequently to rights of either party. Actual agreement made with Shaikhs to be respected. As to immediate action Sheriff hesitates for fear of adverse opinion of Moslems of opposite cam]) and still more lest Arabs may be left to face Turco- German combination in the event of peace unfavourable to Entente. They are ready for action once they are sure that His Majesty’s Government will effectively support them. As to British Administrative officials, His Majesty’s Government having disclaimed all intention of internal interference, there is no need to mention this (?) question. (iV. B .—Unless purposely vague Sheriff must be here alluding only to Arabia.) For himself Sheriff would prefer seclusion from all politics but is forced by circumstances (?) to his present course of action. Ends. It will be seen that reference to subsidies is in quite general terms. 33-A 2312 No. 2313 -W., dated Delhi, the 1st December 1915 (Confidential). 2314 Endorsed by Foreign and Political Department.

Please refer to your telegram No. 887. Pull text of Sheriff’s letter* will haye now been received by you. It is satisfactory as showing desire for mutual understanding on reasonable lines. It affords opportunity also of meeting wishes of Government of India with regard to Mesopotamia by some change of formula but personally I cannot think of any formula on that subject more favourable to Indian interests without raising Arab suspicions than one employed in my former letter. Criticisms of Government of India and Secretary of State ignore, I think very grent importance which Arabs attach to Irak and Baghdad for reasons of a historical, religious and economic kind. To come to any general understand ing with Arabs without some acknowledgment that Irak is in theory part of Arabia proper is quite impossible. M ith regard to nonentity of Sheriff or his pro-Turkish proclivity f I can find ^V- oo no corroboration of this here or in Soudan or among (?) other Arabs with whom we are in touch nor in attitude towards him of Ottoman Government. Every thing would tend to prove that he is of sufficiently commanding importance by position of personality and descent to be only possible central rallyino* point for Arab cause and sufficiently anti-Turkish to be in great personal danger at hands of Turks. 3 Again it must be remembered present Arab movement is based on national rather than religious grounds and differs widely from pan-Islamism, with which Arab party disdain sympathy. There are many Shiah Arabs in Irak but there are also many Christian Arabs in West, but neither faction appears to me to preclude general agreement on lines suggested. To suit its local conditions e^ r &gt; portion of Arab Empire will require some different form of administration and tms alone will I think sufficiently postpone or prevent creation of united independent Arab State which India seems to apprehend. Even such an Arab State established and controlled under Entente auspices will present far less danger than survival of a hostile Ottoman Empire u herein Arabs would be under Turks, Turks under C. U. P. and latter under German control, a contingency which cannot be regarded as impossible if conclusion of war finds Turkey with an unbeaten army in North Mesopotamia and Syria I think it right to warn His Majesty’s Go/ernment wiTh Tulk C sTe d° if? b mm 1 emeilt raised in other quarters that Germans and Youn- luiks a re doubtless endeavouring to employ certain indirect influences.

Acknowledge his exclusion from Arab sphere of Adana and Mersina. 0 2. Note with pleasure his assurance ^quoting his own words) that Arabs are determined to act in accordance with precepts of Omar true early Khalifs which secure the rights and privileges of both Christians and Moslems. 3. Agree that, with the exception of tracts around Aintab and Marash, Vilayets of Aleppo Bey rout are inhabited by Arabs but in these vilayets as elsewhere in Syria our Ally France has considerable interest to safe guard which some special arrangements will be necessary and we cannot say more now, as this is matter for French Government, than assure Sheriff of our earnest wish that satisfactory settlement may be reached. (Some more brief and definite statement is desirable now if French Government can be got to agree to it.) 4. With regard to Vilayets of Baghdad and Basrah say some such arrange ment as he suggests would provide suitable solution, i e-, that until such time as a satisfactory mutual arrangement can be made, these vilayets, which have been taken by us from Turks by force of arms, should remain under British administration (Government of India may be able to suggest some better formula. I should note that Sheriff and Arab party qs far as I can ascertain their views recognise their inability to administer these vilayets and are content to leave them in our hands but require formula that satisfies Arab sentiment.) What they obviously most desire is some assurance of ours considering question of a subsidy or quit rent. 5 Assure Sheriff that Great Britain has no intention to conclude peace, in terms of which freedom of Arabs from Turkish domination does not form essential condition. (Sole hope of successful understanding depends on some assurance of-this nature. I would even suggest stronger assurance to the effect that if Arabs play proper part in war we bind ourselves not to desert them nor to conclude any peace, etc , as abo^e.) 6 Appreciate Sheriff’s desire for caution and disclaim wish to urge him to hasten action jeopardising Arab projects, but in the meantime he must spare no effort to attach Arab peoples to our cause and present them assisting enemy as it is on success of these efforts and on active measures which Arabs may hereafter take in our cause when time comes than permanency of present arrangement must depend. „ , 7 Inform him that we are sending him some funds to facilitate^.) his efforts in our joint cause.

The following is the result of interrogatories, made to a Turkish officer who was captured on December 5th in the Fed Sea, of which please inform Mesopotamia. Lieutenant Ghalib-Ibn Jabir. When asked about the Sheriff he appeared at first slightly uncomfortable, but he at length said that as a result of the war the Sheriff had acquired many privileges. He said that the tribes between that (of) Sheriff and of Idrisi were now all in the hands of the former ; they were considered to be fairly armed and are reckoned as fine fighting men and to be fanatical. 'When asked what would be the result in a fight between the Yali and the Sheriff he replied that the Sheriff would most certainly win. As regards the attitude which the Arab troops in Hedjaz and Assir in such an event would be, he said “ They are Arabs.” It is not improbable that there may have been some such difficulty in his own case. He stated that the Sheriff has now independent jurisdiction over the whole of Ashraf, who can make no appeal to the Turks from his sentences. He possesses his own Gendarme Fifles who take up the entire country between Ibha and Taif Bisha. In the event of an order being received from Constantinople it is taken to the Sheriff by the Vali. The former then consults his (Ministry ?) as to whether the order conforms with the tribal law ; and only if it does so is it enforced. . 39 Telegram P., dated the 10th (received 11th) December 1915.

(3) In your desire to hasten the movement we see not only advantages but grounds of apprehension. The first of these grounds is the fear of the blame of the Moslems of the opposite party (as has already happened in the past), who would declare that we have revolted against Islam and ruined its forces. The second is that standing in the face of Turkey which is supported by all the forces of Germany, we do not know w r hat Great Britain and the Allies would do if one of the Entente Powers were weakened and obliged to make peace. We fear that the Arab nation w r ill then be left alone in the face of Turkey together with her Allies—hut we vmuld not at all mind if v r e were to face the Turks alone. Therefore it is necessary to take these points into consideration in order to avoid a peace being concluded in which the parties concerned may decide the fate of our people as if we had taken part in the war without making good our claims to official consideration. (4) The Arab nation has a strong belief that after this war is over, the Tu^ks under German influence will direct tbeir efforts to provoke the Arabs and violate their rights, both material and moral, to wipe out their nobility and honour and reduce them to utter submission as they are determined to ruin them entirely. The reason for the slowness shown in our action has already been stated. (5) When the Arabs know that the Government of Great Britain is their Ally wffio will not leave them to themselves at the conclusion of peace in the face of Turkey and Germany, and that she will support and will effectively defend them, then to enter the wmr at once will, no doubt, be in conformity with the general interest of the Arabs. (6) Our letter dated 29th Shaual 1333 (September 9th, 1915) saves us the trouble of repeating our opinions as to articles 3 and 4 of your honoured last letter regarding administration, Government advisers and officials especially as you have declared, 0 ! Exalted Minister, that you will not interfere with internal affairs. (7) The arrival of a clear and definite answer, as soon as possible, to the above proposals is expected. We have done our utmost in making concessions in order to come to an agreement satisfying both parties. We know that our lot in this war will be either a success which will guarantee to the Arabs a life becoming their past history, or destruction in the attempt to attain their objects. Had it not been for the determination which I see in the Arabs for the attainment of their objects I would have preferred to seclude myself on one of the heights of a mountain but they, the Arabs, have insisted that i should guide the movement to this end. May God keep you safe and victorious, as we devoutly hope and desire. (Unsigned).

Full note of the interview being posted you, meanwhile resume is as follows :—“ Though Turks are no doubt taking advantage of recent developments in Europe and of suspension of our advance on Baghdad to endeavour to re-kindle tribal and religious feeling against us in Central Arabia, Bin Sand does not anticipate much result. He thinks explanation of rumour of intended purchase of 40,000 camels by Turks, is that Turks are endeavouring to bribe tribal Sheikhs to co-operate with them, and are offering bribe in shape of an advance for investment in camels or horses in case Turkish Government requires them. He himself received similar overtures few months ago. He does not believe Bin Rashid would dare to advance far towards Koweit or Nasirijah for fear that Bin Saud should cut in against (?) in his rear, and that in any case absence of rain and grazing puts advance of any large i° rce cat present out of the question. Bin Sand’s present relatio ns with Shereff of Mecca are quite normal and friendly but he characterises Shenat essentia \ unstable, trivial, undependable. Bin Saud discredits any active under standing between Shereff and Bin Rashid. Regarding general question of Caliphate, in the event of Turkey breaking up Bin Saud says nobody among rulino- chiefs cares in the least who calls himself Caliph, and even if Shere claims title they would no more accept control from but each chief would continue to control his own tribes and Relcom im 7fllst°VceZb^ sTrTcox interviewed new ^ He was emphatic in view that neither he (Jabar nor ks dependents) tate any interest whatever in question of Caliphate.

The High Commissioner, Egypt, has already sent the gist of these proposals to the Viceroy. This is an opportunity of honestly and properly letting our intentions be known, and it would convince the Sharif that we are sincere, and would also do an infinite amount of good. Suspicion would be aroused if we did anything short of this, and Arabs are t ocu- liarly suspicious.

H n 4 • &lt;■ - POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. i. From Jiieutenant-Colonel Sir Mark Sykes, Bart., M.P., to tlie Director of Military Operations. Xo. 2o. S.S. Khyber, Red Sea, ^* r &gt; 15th November 1915. I have tlie honour to forward to you (by favour of Mr. S. Waterheld, Political Agent, Haraoti and Tonk, Rajputana, who is proceeding to London by this mail), under this cover a memorandum resuming the impressions I have received on various points as the result of my tour of the Eastern theatre. f have dated it 28th October, as that is the last date on which 1 was in touch with the situation. I would therefore point out that my observations regarding the despatch of reinforcements to Mesopotamia are based on the forces actually in Mesopotamia at the end of October. I heard at Karachi that a division, less certain minor units, was under orders, but 1 have not presumed this in tlie memorandum. 1 have made no observations with regard to Persia or the Persian side of the Gulf, as that region did not come within the scope of my instructions, and my previous experience gives me no assistance with regard to those parts. I lowever, my personal opinion is that the occupation of Ahwaz is, and has been, a source of great weakness to us, but 1 assume that the necessities of the Admiralty, and the maintenance of our prestige m Persia, make it retention essential. If it was merely a question of the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, I should believe it would be best to abandon Ahwaz and compensate the Company for any damage that might ensue. I do not believe that even if the Bakhtiaris turned against us they could venture far afield, or co-operate with the Turks in Mesopotamia. I would also point out that my assumption of 30,000 'Turks in Syria in my note on the general military situation is based on information of about 18th October. From rumours L have since heard I imagine it is possible that this number has greatly increased, from which I infer that the release of Constantinople troops began with the entrance of Bulgaria into the held. However, I still believe that the blocking of the Cilician Gates is important to us, and that we cannot afford to let the Turks assume a constant offensive against -Egvpt and Mesopotamia, and that we should take advantage of the snow barrier which cuts off Syria and Mesopotamia from Armenia and Anatolia to improve our position for the opening of the spring campaign. i i ,1 1 think that the Mesopotamian operations demonstrate very clearlj the superiority of our troops over the Turks in manoeuvre, and show that, where onen fighting and flanking movement is possible, we can beat them on a proportion of 10 British led troops to 16 Turks. However, I must qualify this bv pointing out that, whatever the individual merit of the soldiers o the Mesopotamian force (a large proportion of which is Indian), the\ me e. jk) Cdh Itr^cc-i. of .by regular officers, and are perhaps more accustomed to manoeuvre than the newly raised divisions of British and Colonial troops, which must be of better individual quality but perhaps collectively less mobile. I should also like to reinforce what I have said on the general political situation, with regard to the necessity of co-operation and co-ordination as regards our various theatres in the East ; and also of urging the importance of a clear understanding among the Entente Bowers, which would enable available troops to be used at available points. If my tour has impressed me with one thing above another, it is the advantage which our enemy gains by using every available local asset as a part of one harmonious scheme. I should also take this opportunity of saying that no matter how dark things may look, we must never forget that Turkey is undoubtedly getting exhausted in men, and that the poverty and distress in the provincial capitals of Syria and Mesopotamia is always an advantage to us, the advent of Entente troops meaning trade and payment in lieu of requisition and extortion. In conclusion 1 mention that I saw the Resident at Aden and Colonel Jacob. I believe that the commandant of the Turkish forces outside Aden might not be beyond the reach of financial influence ; he is isolated and cannot attack us, and doubtless dare not retire for fear of punishment; his Turkish soldiers are also deserting to us pretty freely, about 29 Anatolian Turks and 3 Syrians having come in in the last three weeks.

Sykes.Memorandum by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Mark Sykes. SECTION I. MILITARY SITUATION IN MESOPOTAMIA. With regard to the situation in Mesopotamia there are two aspects, the one political, the other military. From the military point of view I think the reinforcement of the Army and the occupation of Baghdad are the two most important considerations. As matters now stand, our Army is weak in numbers and grows propor tionately weaker as the enemy gradually recuperates and reinforces at Baghdad, until he is strong enough to advance in force. It cannot be too strongly urged that a single defeat is sufficient to procure the destruction of om* whole force. The population would undoubtedly rise en masse to plunder and harass our retirement if once they imagined we had turned our backs, and I personally doubt whether we should be able to withdraw to Basra under such circumstances. Whether we decide to occup\ Baghua or not, 1 am certain that the reinforcement of a full division is the least that the situation demands. . . . , If we occupy Baghdad, I think that the military situation is much easier than before, and that we should feel the strain less for the following reasons. Once Baghdad is ours the enemy’s facilities for concentration previous to attack are reduced. Thus so long as he holds Baghdad he can dnbble Ins reinforcements simultaneously into Baghdad by the Euphrates ligns an by the Kifri road he can concentrate at Baghdad, and with the hcl] steamers and current advance with a fairly huge f° lct - , . - If we hold Baghdad the enemy must either disperse his forces or concentrate at a point on one of the three lines, and use that line only for suddIv with the result that the concentration of a large force will be more difficult 'for him to accomplish, and his subsequent advance easier to check. .♦ r 9 000 men for the maintenance of order in respective positions. , i a the work in progress.

The political situation in Mesopotamia is influenced to our detriment by the element of doubt which subsists in the minds of the people as to our actual intentions. Notables .—I have interviewed several notables of Pasra, namely, the brother of the Nakib, several senior members of the Bashayan family, the Shaykh of Zabeyr, and the notable Shaykh Abu Talib. One and all obviously desire certainty, and particularly that we should occupy Baghdad. The fear in their minds is that we should retire or let the Turks in again. People .—The people, whether nomads, cultivators, or semi-nomads, Sunnis or Shias, are ready to accept our rule, but equally ready to turn against us in event of any mishap. In many villages between Amara and Kurna demonstrations of sympathy are made by the Arab women when barge loads of Turkish prisoners pass by, villages it may be said whose inhabitants did not hesitate to plunder the Turks in their retreat. This should be a sufficient indication of what we ourselves might expect under similar circumstances. 'J'he Shia shrines require especial consideration and treatment, but it is not necessary to make a great parade of the matter. Again, with the people as with the notables, it is desirable that there should be some certainty as to their future. Future Policy .—There is one point which I feel requires careful con sideration, and that is the connection between India and Mesopotamia. Indian and Arab civilisation and mentality are poles asunder, and I am of opinion that the introduction of Indian methods and Indian personnel should be merely temporary, and should form no part of our future scheme. Indian administration has grown up in the course of years and is based on traditions and social customs which have no counterpart in Irak. The introduction of Anglo-Indian and native Indian officials directed from India will mean inevitably that Irak will develop on Indian lines. There can be no doubt that the native social standards of Egypt and Syria are far higher than those of India, and owing to language and racial affinity it is fiom those regions that the civilisation of Irak would naturally be diawn. I feel it is my duty to say therefore that m my opinion it would be a gieat mishap if at the outset any action of ours should do anvthing to impose artificially an alien and lower grade of civilisation upon a people who have a natural tendency to a higher and more progressive social state. 1 he Indian cuirency, Indian officials in the police, the posts, telegraphs, and clerical bureaus, and the introduction of Indian law, Indian money- lendf is and mei chants, will influence the whole country and set a permanent barrier of alien administration between ourselves and the people. Doubtless we shall sooner or later begin to employ natives of the country ; but as the first traditions will be moulded on Indian lines, with the result that we shall not be able at a later date to develop the spiritual and national mental resources of the urban and rural population to such advantage as we otherwise anight. Colonisation.-In saying this, I am raising no objection to hond fide colonisation by Indians, provided that the administrative personnel is purely Biitish and Aiab. Iheie can lie no objection to the allotment of lands to Indian cultivatois m distiiCts (where local inhabitants are insufficient, and where there is no prospect of nomads being induced to settle) to develop the country, provided that the colonists will not have the pull of the administra tion. They will, under •such circumstances, either remain in separate communities or mingle with the people, and so become a part of Irak. If, however, the Indian peoples permeate the administrative personnel and the mercantile and financial classes, the colonists will only be another element in the Indianisation of the country. The Indianisation of Irak is not only to be avoided far the above reasons, but also because, as time o- 0 es on and intercommunication grows easy between Irak and Syria, we shall be confronted with the tendency of the Arab to reassert himself once more and in that tendency we shall find the seeds of much political diffieultv.I here is also one other point which should not be lost sight of At present, no matter what the feelings of Indian Moslems may be, nor what the extent of the ramifications of Indian seditionism, such influences find no equivalent among the Arabs of Irak, either urban nor rural, and since the best elements look to us for good and firm government, it would be a mistake to put them fiom the very outset within the scope of action of subtle and powerful forces which will begin spreading unrest and- disaffection at the first available opportunity. SECTION II. INDIAN MOSLEMS AND THE WAIL With regard to the attitude ol Indian Moslems in the present war, it is very difficult to generalise owing to the diversities of sect, race, and avocation among Indian Mohammedans, however, it is impossible to talk to Indian Mohammedans and British civil and military officers in the Indian service about Islam in India without getting certain impressions. In the first place, basing one’s acquaintance with Islam on experience in Turkey, Arabia, the Caucasus, Egypt, Tunis, and Algeria, there is one factor in the situation with which one cannot fail to he impressed, and that is the extreme ignorance of Indian Mohammedans as a whole, of Islamic theological doctrine as taught in the schools and universities or the Al Azhar, Damascus, Constantinople, and Kairawan. Indian Mohammedanism, as far as theo logical learning is concerned, appears to be at a low ebb. At first this would seem to be a matter of slight importance, but on examination it will be found to be a considerable disadvantage to us as rulers, and to open an avenue for our enemies. In the first place it makes it easy for any charlatan to impose on Indian Moslems the most absurd ideas as for instance, that the city of Baghdad is a holy city, that Adrianople is the site of holy shrines, that Constantinople is the ancient capital of Islam, ideas which not the rudest Anatolian would entertain. Further, it makes it very difficult to impress on Indian Moslems the absolutely hypocritical attitude of the Committee of Union and Progress, the enmity of the Turkish clerical party for the Committee, and the sordid motives which impelled the 1 urks to war. From all I heard it was impossible not to feel that the bulk of Indian Moslems sympathised with the Turks more or less-the educated because they have* been affected by young Turkish propaganda, the uneducated because they have no learned theological body to keep them straight. For this state of affairs (although it is presumptuous for me to say so) I think want of touch between the Indian Government and the real tendency of development in the Near East is partly responsible. Thus the Red Crescent Societv, which is neither more nor less than a revolutionary anti-theological pan-Islamic machine, was suffered to work on the fertile soil of Indian educated Mohammedan Seditionism and Indian uneducated Mohammedan ignorance for some time before the war. On the score of avoiding wounding religions susceptibilities we have never taken the held m the Butish Indian press ami in st the Committee of Union and Progress, and a certain remote ness from the scene has produced an atmosphere of acquiescence and tolerance for things dangerous to our peace. As examples 1 enclose a small mniDhlet* I bought on a bookstall, and a cutting from a British Indian newspaper,'® each containing the seeds of immense mischief; while ,t may j,e incidentally mentioned that one may meet at Simla or Delhi young students wearing a crescent and star badge on a lurkish nulitaiy cap, m itself a deliberate challenge to our authority. . . , Our attitude is one of apology, of fear, ol nervous coiisideratioii, win e i-enemies are working against us with weapons which, it the truth were our * Not reproduced.

A very strong iactor to m 3 - mind, in the maintenance of this situation, is the fact that British Indian officials, particularly military officers have not at their disposal the knowledge of the Turkish politics and the real actions and composition of the Committee, to enable them to act with confidence and to speak with eeriainty in conversa tion. I have met several young officers who were devoted to and interested in their men, and who with true Knglish good nature said that it was only natural that, being Moslems, their men should feel in a difficult position, and who were astonished when I explained the real nature of the Commiitee of Union and Progress. It nnyv be objected that no matter wh it Englishmen may sa}' in the course of conversation to Indians, it will have no effect as the Indians will not believe them, personally 1 agree that this will be so at lirst but as the truth is on our side sooner or later we shall produce a better atmosphere, and at least put hostile influences on the defensive. British civil and military officials are trained in India to have a great regard for religious susceptibilities of natives, the}' roughly conceive that the young Turks are the leaders of a united people, and that Turkey is a real Islamic power as it was in the days of Abdul Hamid, consequently they are handicapped by the sense that in Indian Moslem feeling, we are confronting a popular feeling based on a logical foundation, did they realise that they are merely facing the unwitting dupes of cosmopolitan knaves of the Committee of Union and Progress, who believe neither in Allah or the Koran, the}' would be heartened and stiffened by a sense of right which is at present lacking. British, especially Englishmen, are notoriously bad actors, and nothing puts an Englishman in a worse position than the feeling that there is something to be said for the other side. I feel that it is very important that steps should be taken to make it quite clear to British military and civil officials that from the Mohammedan point of view there is nothing to be said for the young Turks. A brief history of the young Turkish movement circulated as a confidential paper to all British officers either civil or military m contact with Moslems would, at least, rectify this deleterious influence. Tile above was written before I had an opportunity of reading the memorandum-prepared by the Political and Foreign Department, Simla, for my information—its date is 28th October. However, I do not feel that it contains any information contrary to the opinion I have expressed. Section IV is to my mind exceedingly interesting and indicates a new cangei. The attitude of the “ intellectuals ” towards education, and the so- called revolt against “ old-school ” teaching, is identical with the attitude of the young Turks towards the Ulema, save with this difference, that the 1 urkisii Ulema are a learned and cultivated body of well-trained clergy with considerable prestige, whereas the Indian old-school Moslems are disorganised, atrophied, and feeble, so far as learning is concerned. 1 he Intellectuals of India are evidently trying the same game as the Committee of l mon and Progress—that is, to engross all political power in the hands of a clique of journalists, pleaders, and functionaries, to oust the cencal element, but to retain its power to excite an ignorant mob to massacre or rebellion when necessary. I feel that this is a time when those responsible for our policy should face facts, and not allow themselves to be b inded b} catchwords An old-school Moslem may be fanatical, but his fanaticism has a logical basis, and may be tempered or assuaged, or even leasone 1 &gt; f 1 ( j re 18 111 his mind an element of righteousness which can &gt;e appealed to, and an element of love of justice which makes him sooner or a er amena ) 1 n intellectual with an imitation European training, wilh cnv-)-of the European surging in his heart—who is an agnostic and tas no belief whatever m religion, but sees in Islam a political engine whereby immense masses of men can be moved to riot and disorder—is far more dangerous. I he fanatic is sincere and is moved by a direct impulse, the intellectual s insincere and moved by policy. It is absolutely vain to expect less natality from a Mohammedan “intellectual” revolutionary than from a tl IT t , T at ? st Arn ? e ' ,an massacres prove this, as every action of tin ( -omim lte e o f 1 111011 and 1 rogress proves this. Furthermore, 1 would * * Memorandum on Indian Moslems—not reprinted.submit that our greatest danger lies in British statesmen and otlieials eon using the idealsol intellectuals” withthoseof European revolutionaries and liberals, and therefore according them a certain respect. The Moslem intellectual uses the clothes of Europe, and he has lost belief in his creed, but the hatred o! Christendom and lust lor the dominion of Islam as a supieme political power remains, and he knows how to use the weapon of fanaticism among a population whose percentage of literates is as low as it is among the Indian Moslems. If one may suggest a policy in words, I feel that our educational policy in regard to Islam should be, among the upper class, to foster the studv of the Moslem classic authors, historians, logicians, and theologians, and to combine with modern education tire study of the history of the greater Moslem dynasties, and the development of Mohammedan Sheri law ; while among the poorer, to endeavour to impart with elementary education a real understanding of the outlines of Islamic history. This policy would do much to introduce a real patriotic religious feeling among the poor, and do something to infuse the upper classes with a com prehension of the true greatness of their forefathers. By such a policy we should be at the root of the difficulty, by disentangling the confusion, of thought at present arising in the minds of the upper classes through the collision of the mass of ill-assimilated European education on the mass of Asiatic tendency, tradition, and prejudice. Similarly among the masses we should be preparing the way for the raising of a reasonable Moslem people from the ignorance and confused superstition of to-day. It might even be hoped that between the two would be produced a frugal and learned clergy capable of giving the people such good as the Mohammedan religion can offer. SECTION III. GENERAL SITUATION. Political .—The general political situation arising out of the war between the entente powers and the Ottoman Empire is really evolved out of the efforts of Germany and Turkey to mobilise Islam against Great Britain and Russia. It is necessary briefly to recapitulate the methods our enemies pursue. * (1.) Fomentation of Indian Moslem discontent and fanaticism. (A) In Persia the working up of tribesmen and nationalists to rebellion along the coast, private murder in the provincial capitals, pressure on the government at the capital. ^ (3.) In Egypt the working of sympathy with the ex-Khedive and nationalist revolutionarism. (L) In Arabia : a. Yemen, alliance with the Imam of Sana. b. Nejd, subventioning of Ibn Reshid. c. In the Kerbella area, playing on Shia fanaticism. d. In Muscat, the fomentation of the rebellion against the Sultan by means of native agents from East Africa. This policy is worked by highly efficient agents on a well co-ordinated plan, as may be judged from results. . . As against this, we have certain strong positive factors and influences m our favour, which may be enumerated as follows: (T ) Discontent with Committee rule in Turkey itself. (?\ The dislike of the clergy for the young Turks. ( 3 .) Arab dislike of Turks. (A.) Disunion between Sunnis and Shias.8 To take full advantage of these influences it is necessary that ne should adopt a definite policy and pursue it with a co-ordinated plan as do our enemies. Our task is the more difficult, inasmuch as out successes in the field are negative and defensive, and our policy must he constructive rather than destructive as is our enemies, however, there is nothing to prevent us us taking advantage of our available assets. To achieve our purpose it is first necessary to have a clear understanding with our allies, particularly France and Russia, and to obtain their acqui escence in our policy, and, when possible, their co-operation. 1 he main point at present is to defeat the enemy and to reduce his power so that his voice, at least, will not be heard in the settling of war and middle Eastern problems after the war is over. To defeat the enemy the destruction of the Ottoman Empire would be a decisive step ; it would paralyse once and for all the enemy s activities in Persia, Afghanistan, and India, and thus deprive him of a source of diversions and menaces with which he amuses and distracts not only us but Russia. Further, the Ottoman Empire in Asia still remains the enemy’s most vulnerable position. From a political point of view our policy might well run on the following lines :•— Line 1.—To back the Arabic'speaking peoples against the Turkish Government on one consistent and logical plan. Line 2.— (a) To support the anti-committee Turkish parties; and (7&gt;) the influence of the Sunni Mohammedan clergy, wherever it is antagonistic to the Committee. Line 3.—To propagandise Islam in a definite and offensive manner, not making apology for our acts, but attacking the enemy on the score of injustice, crime, unorthodoxy, and hypocrisy, in our own press, in the native press, and by means of leaflets. Line 1. To achieve the first of these objects it is necessary to obtain the sanction of France and Italy to an agreement as to the future treatment of the Arab peoples in the present Ottoman Empire, and to obtain from France guarantees compatible with Arab national aspirations, and to settle with France, Italy, and Russia the status of Jerusalem. Once this is done we can, the moment we take action, make proclamation of our intentions, and solidify the Arabs of Irak, Palestine, Syria, and Northern Mesopotamia against the Turks. At present the Arabs are paralysed by the fear that the Turks will return, in any event owing to dissensions among the Entente Powers. If we can make so clear a statement that, dependent on our success, the Arabic-speaking people will be under French protection in one area, and English protection in another, with the recognition of Arab nationality and of Arab participation in the official administration in both areas, we shall have a clear situation and a definite backing to our success ; our primal success must, however, be derived from military action, which 1 deal with under the military situation. I suggest that our ultimate goal should be : In Arabia ( 1 ) Recognition of the independence of Ilejaz under the Sherif. ( 2 ) The conclusion of peace between Idris and Imam Vahyali, and the fixing of their territories, compensating Yahyah in the Aden Hinterland and Hadhrainaut, if necessary, in return for the expulsion of the Turks from Yemen. (3) Declaration of an external protectorate over the Arabian littoral from Koweyt to Hodeidah. (4) Declaration of a British internal and external protectorate over an area in Southern Syria and Mesopotamia to be agreed upon with France and Russia. Declaration of a French internal and external protectorate in an area north of the British area. (5) An agreement between the Entente Powers which would ensure political and military co-operation without prejudice to the futurestatus ofcor-tam territories, thus permitting the use of British , 1 r(M 1 v u kalian, or Russian troops in any area. (&lt;,) Sherif l)le ^ Rtimulate an Ara,J) (leilia «d for the Caliphate of the Link 2. A. The second of these lines of policy requires careful management as we are here making use of Turks against Turks, and consequently run the risk of compromising our Arabian nationalist asset, since the Arabs are almost as hostile to the I urktsh Liberals as they are to the Young Turks themselves. However, this is to be avoided by sti lating among the Liberals I) the hope of revenge, and (ii) by working on the idea that only to hem will we accord any Ottoman Independence at all, at the conclusion of he war. I bus we can make it clear to Turkish Liberals that so long as the ( ommittee holds office we will give no peace or quarter to the Ottoman Lmpire, but that it they work a successful revolution we shall be prepared to negotiate with them at once as regards the independence of regions where Ottoman I urks are m the majority. It is also possible, though I hesitate to suggest it, that the Russian Government might be prepared to make concessions to the Tinkish Liberals with regard to the status of Con stantinople. I’his, however, would be a matter which should lie between Russia and the Liberals alone. B. As regards the second portion of this line, it consists in being prepared with a policy whereby the Ottoman Ulema shall continue to enjoy their present properties and privileges in all the ancient provinces of the Ottoman Empire, no matter under whose jurisdiction or protection it may fall ; and guaranteeing all shrines and vvakfs in (Constantinople and the pio\ lines, u ith the exception of Santa Sofia, for which compensation shall be allowed. I his in itself is a great asset against the Committee, as the Ulema know full well that their revenues will be lost if the Committee prosecute the war to a successful issue. To encourage Aran Ulema to get Turkish Ulema to fall in with the idea of a vSherilian Caliphate would be profitable if carefully handled. Line 3. This is merely a matter of co-ordination and organisation. It requires an expert political and literary stalf in touch with all quarters of the Islamic areas, and with local agencies at various centres. The system should be for the central staff to give the general line to the local agencies, and for the local agencies to pursue that line in the manner most suitable. The general purpose is to produce an atmosphere favourable to us among Moslems generally, and to combat the propaganda direct and indirect of our enemies. As a general rule it will he found that educated conservatism and orthodoxy are on our side and modernism and ignorant fanatioism are against us, for reasons explained in my Despatch No. 17, and already dealt with under Section II. of this memorandum. A. To mobilise oar full force, we must make the situation clear to all British officers engaged in the Islamic area ; and we must as far as possible ^ / work our own press, both at home and in India and Egypt, by supplying ^ ^//T paragraphs, articles, and private memoranda, and by checking the publica tion of unsatisfactory or dangerous matter, ft may be mentioned here that the attuning and education of our own people is qu te as important as the influencing of our Mohammedan subjects. B. We should be ready to squash without hesitation any article, paragraph, or observation in any native newspaper which was of a philo- Cominittee nature, particularly the kind of contribution which is subtle and indirect, as in the enclosed article in the Hindnstan Review/* (!. We should promote the spread of rumours, prophecies, saws, rhymes, crvptograms, and anagrams favourable to our side, by means of native Not reproduced.agents, and especially by letting them drop on sincere ground to run their own course. D. We should co-ordinate most carefully our own issue of pamphlets and in them always be aggressive, demonstrative, and unapologetie; all our apologies and explanations should be by inference rather than direct. For this work we require an erudite Moslem staff as well as an English observation and control. MILITARY SITUATION. ( 1 ) Hie whole military situation lias been dominated by the Dardanelles operations. Should these operations lie regarded as having been unfruitful hitherto, the following considerations should be remembered. Since March about 500,000 Turkish troops and necessary reinforcements have been immobilished and subject to heavy loss. Had the Dardanelles operations not been in progress, it may be assumed that the Turks would have had approximately 130,000 men in Syria, 80,000 at Baghdad, and 100,000 additional troops in the Caucasus. Such dispositions would’have immobilised a larger garrison in Lgypt, have forbidden any advance in Mesopotamia, and menaced the Caucasus and the Russian sphere in Persia. I he influence on the Moslem world of a constant Ottoman offensive would have given the German and Committee of Union and Progress agents a far wider scope in the Caucasus, Persia, the Persian Gulf, Egypt, India, and Arabia. As it is, these gentry have had some success, but they have been heavily handicapped by lack of moral support; the minor successes they ha\p obtained aie indications of what their power would have been had the Ottoman forces not been concentrated around the Marmora. ( 2 ) The entrance of Bulgaria into the field indicates the possible release of Ottoman forces from the Constantinople area and their despatch else where. This consideration suggests that it would be profitable to consider certain geographical and climatic factors affecting the movement of large bodies of troops in the Ottoman Umpire in Asia. The appended map shows Ity a hatched line the limit of permanent winter snow enduring from about the 10 th November to the 15th March, which makes mobile operations practically impossible in Armenia and Anatolia during that period. from the same map it will also be seen that there are practically only t iree h^es along which an army can advance from Anatolia or Armenia into bvna, Mesopotamia, or Southern Kurdistan- to wit, via the Cilieian Gates via the Sivas-Kharput Road, or via Erzerum and Bitlis. 'The advance of an army with a fighting head of two divisions along the latter two maybe ruled out until the middle of March. Thus while it is conceivable that an existing army of 50,000 men in North Mesopotamia could be reinforced along these roads during the winter, yet it would be impossible for an army to come down them as an independent fighting force. As legards the ( ilician Gates road, if the southern end be blocked at the opening of the defiles during the winter, a force of 40,000 men could deny the enemy access to Syria or Mesopotamia along this road for the duration of the war, provided that the enemy was prevented from raising an army in Syria. 6 If the enemy dispositions are as follows :— 30.000 men in Syria ; 20.000 men at Baghdad ; 10 , 000 men in North Mesopotamia; 100.000 men on the Russian frontier; 500.000 men at Gonstantinople ; and presuming that the participation of Bulgaria 400,000 men from Constantinople, the enemy will have to him. eventually releases certain courses open He has three fronts to consider-he may therefore decide either to- (l) Concentrate during the winter at Erzerum for a late spring or earlv summer effort of a decisive nature against the Caucasus, and let matters rest in Syria and Mesopotamia.11 •• / (2) Remain on the defensive in Armenia, and devote his attention to winning back Mesopotamia and to attacking Kgypt from Syria. (3) Assume the offensive in all three regions. Whichever of these courses the enemy adopts, he has certain factors which militate in his disfavour. (1) The difficulty of approaching Egypt after he has passed rail head. ( 2 ) 'Idle length of communication between Baghdad and Ras-ul-Ain where his railway ceases to be of real use to him. (3) The separation of his forces in Armenia from those in Syria and Mesopotamia. (4) The badness of the eastward roads from the Angora rail head to the Caucasus. I think it is probable that ( 1 ) if lie adopts course 1 he will send 2 ) 00,000 men to Armenia, 30,000 to Syria, and 50,000 to Mesopotamia. (2) If he adopts course 2 he will send 100,000 men to Armenia, 200,000 to Syria, and 100,000 to Mesopotamia. (3) If he adopts course 3 he will send 150,000 men to Armenia, 150,000 to Syria, and 100,000 to Mesopotamia. The movement and supply of such large forces will naturally be slow, and 10 per cent, losses from desertion and sickness per quarter may be anticipated. In any event, it would appear advisable, if it be possible, for the Allies to spare the men, to block the exit from the Cicilian Gates. If this be accomplished before the enemy’s troops are released he will have relatively small forces at his disposal in Syria and Mesopotamia, and no means of greatly increasing their numbers before the month of April. As the Syrian and Mesopotamian winter is comparatively mild this should give the Allies an opportunity of occupying practically the whole of the Arab speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire, and of cutting off the enemy from his indirect activities in Persia, Afghanistan, and Arabia. If by the Kith of March the Allies could dispose of their forces as shown nn Man 2 in the following strengths, with lines of communication as - 50,000 - 20,000 •- 50,000 - 10,000 - 14,000 - 20,000 104,000 - 30,000 194,000 marked :— Adana A intab Diarbekir Aleppo Acre-Jerusalem Baghdad Line of communications be Turkish forces would be unable to reconquer their Arabian Empire wing to the difficulty of concentrating and deploying at the decisive &gt;oints. — d) Communication with the Russian army could be established through the Bitlis pass. i ai i (2i The two small Turkish armies, presumably at Damascus and Mosul, could be dealt with at leisure. . c . . (3) A provisional native government could be established in Byna and trade reopened with the whole of the Syrian poits. ( 4 ) Knemy activities in Persia, Afghanistan, and Arabia would naturally come to an end. , (5) The Aleppo-Deir Zor-Baghdad trade route coiild be re-opened. ( 6 ) Direct negotiations for the recognition of tl.e independence of the rfherif could be begun. C) The Mlies could, in the event of the European s.tuat.on proving favourable envisage a peace conference with the certainty that the Ottoman Empire would be reduced to Anatolia, although Constantinople might still remain in Ottoman hands. N B—A modification of the above scheme wouhl consist m eliminating the fote defined for Diarbekir and holding the lute Marash-B.rejik- S. 289. 1)12 Meskene. Under these circumstances a large Turkish army might be built up at Diarbekir, but its mobility would be much impeded and its ammunition supply feeble. The main objection to this course is that the Turks would have a better position at a peace conference, since the attack of a large Turkish army acting on the defensive with flanks secure would be a costly undertaking. The initial steps in either case would possibly be as follows : — 1 st Step. Land Forces A., !&gt;., C., 1)., in the Gulf of Alexandretta. 2 nd Step. Secure the exit of the Cilician Gates. 3rd Step. Land at Haifa Force E. and begin operations in North Syria. -Notes on above. ( 1 ) The population south of A intab* may be regarded as a negligeable quantity. (2) In North Mesopotamia the nomads and chieftains, both Kurd and Arab; may be dealt with and subventioned ; the promise to them of the plunder of Diarbekir, in retaliation for the Armenian massacres, would probably bring them in on our side, provided we are successful. (o) 11 \Dothetically the foeces for such an expedition should be provided with ample horse transport, though the railways could be got into working oidei within three months, with the exception of the Euphrates bridge at Jerablus, which must be assumed to be destroyed. (4) A strong proportion of cavalry is required with Forces “D ” “ E ” and “ F.” FI XA L 0 BS ERVATJON. In conclusion it is perhas worth considering a certain psychological nbosyncracies of Ottoman armies, which both present and past operations appear to demonstrate as a permanent factor in warfare in which thev are engaged lor some reason Ottoman armies appear to be formidable in a cbrect offensive or m a direct defensive, but on the other hand seem to be tee ole in manoeuvre, or in the face of mobile troops. Thus Ottoman troops— (0 ( 2 ) (3) (4) (5) ( 6 ) w II hold an entrenched position the flanks of which are secure, in lace of heavy losses. M ill resist when surrounded beyond expectation.

Are quickly disorganised by an unexpected development in the open, ^ and to fail accommodate themselves to a new situation frequently fail in operations necessitating combined manoeuvres. Aie bad at partizan or mountain warfare. As examples of the first may be cited— Omar Pasha s operations on the Danube, 1852 The battle of the Shipka pass, 1877. The holding of the Chatalja lines, 1912. The Dardanelles operations, 1915. As examples of the second— Kars, 1852-53. Kars—Erzerum— Plevna, 1877-78. Adrianople, 1912. As examples of the third— The campaign in Thessalay, 1897. The Italian campaign in Tripoli, 1911. The battle of Shaiba, 1915. The attack on the Suez Canal, 1914. As examples of the fourth— The battle of Nezib, 1840 (?). The battle of Kirk Kilisse, 1912. Ihe battles of Nasirie, Amara, and Kut, 1915.13 As examples of the fifth — Mukhtar’s campaign in the Caucasus, 1877. 1 he Macedonian campaign against the Greeks and Serbs, 1912. Enver’s campaign in the Caucasus, 1914. As examples of the sixth— I he various operations of the Turks in the areas, Macedonia, Zeitun, Dersim, Ilauran, and Yemen at various dates since 1894. I hese characteristics which, as will be seen, appear to survive German training, would suggest that we should (a)'endeavour to light the Turks in tlie open on the offensive by mobile manoeuvre ; ( 6 ) where we assume a pure defensive, endeavour to confine them to broken or mountainous country ; and (c) avoid attacking them in secure positions. I he key to these characteristics lies probably in the following. Turkish commanders have, owing to tradition and jealousy, little confidence in one another or their subordinates, consequently they hesitate to entrust anyone with an independent action, such as an outflanking march combined with a holding atiack. The backbone of the Turkish army is composed of Anatolians, who are extremely brave but very slow thinkers and movers; a preconceived notion of the enemy’s position gets in their heads, and an unexpected development puts them in a panic. Turkish armies once away from railhead are weak in transport organisation, and supplies are liable to be lost and plundered. 1 hese factors are beyond the control of German organisation.I e -*2 SECRET. POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. II. Select Ke()orts and Telegrams from Sir Mark Sykes. ^eA/ic ffy) it} • /X- ($- *0 RTS. Sir No. 4 (Secret). Atliens, | 12th June 1915. 1 have the honour to report that to-day, with the approval of Sir Francis Elliot, I interviewed Ills Highness Prince Sabah-ed-Din at the house of Mr. F. F. \\ hittall. His Highness made a lengthy statement regarding the intentions and aspirations of the political party of which he is leader. He stated that his party had suffered a great deal at the hands of the Committee and the Germans, that a great number of its leaders were in prison, that 29 military officers belonging to it had been shot, and that people had been sent to Athens from Constantinople with orders to kill him at the first opportunity. However, he considered his party strong in the Smyrna garrison, numerous in Constantinople, and popular among the masses of the Turkish people, but he had to admit that in Gallipoli neither among the officers nor men were there any adherents of his cause. He further stated that he had no communications either with the Arabs in Syria or the Armenians in Zeitun or Eastern Armenia. His hope was to obtain assistance from the Allies to provoke a military revolution in Smyrna, extend it to Constantinople, overthrow the existing Government and make separate terms of peace with the Allies ; his idea being that with a revolution at the Capital the Turco-German resistance at Dardanelles would collapse, lie made it quite clear that this course would be impossible without assistance from the Allies, but did not specify what form the assistance should take. The terms of peace which His Highness had in mind in event of such a scheme being feasible were as follows : (i.) The cession of certain small territories to the Allies, from which I inferred the Lebanon to France, llasra to Great Britain, and a slight modification of the Russo-Turkish boundary in Asia however, on this point His Highness was not precise, partly perhaps owing to his not having a very clear geographical knowledge of Asiatic Turkey. (ii.) The neutralization of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles and the dismantling of the forts. (dii.) The retention of Constantinople by Turkey. (iv.) The adoption of a wide scheme of reforms, including decentralization and the establishment of local autonomy in all parts of the Empire, under a scheme of regions compatible with national aspirations. (v.) The transfer of the Caliphate by the Sultan to a member of the Koraysh. He cited, as a support to his hopes that such terms would be acceptable to the Allies, the British declaration that our war was with the existing Turkish Government and not with the Ottoman people. His Highness further informed me that in the event of the Allies being unwilling to help him in such a venture, he might, if he had their approval, bring about a revolution on similar lines when Gallipoli had fallen, but before Constantinople was taken, lie thought that perhaps the Allies might be willing to forego the capture of Const^ order to spare s. 290 . A flA Athe population and monuments of the city, and avoid the inevitable losses which the Allies would sustain in the final operations between the Narrows and the Bosphorus. Under such circumstances His Highness said that the cession of Gallipoli to the Allies would be included in terms of peace similar to those already- mentioned. Finally, His Highness said that in event of the Allies not approving such a course, his party would hold their hand until Constantinople had actually fallen, when the revolutionary action would be easy. Under such circumstances the new Government would be able to treat with the Allies on the same terms, the Constantinople clause being eliminated from the discussion owing to its having been lost by the present Ottoman Government. His Highness does not impress one as being a man likely to carry through a great political move such as the first and second courses he mentioned would entail ; however, it is quite possible that no great abilities would be wanted in the third case. His attitude with regard to the Caliphate was that his party desired the severance of religion from affairs of State, and that the possession of the Caliphate engendered ihe ill-will both of France and England, and that the transfer of the office would enable the Ottoman Government to legislate on a basis of religious equality in Turkey more easily when the Sultan was no longer a religious emblem. I asked His Highness to whom he would expect the office would be transferred, and he replied at once the “ Sherif of Mecca.” I then asked His Highness whether it was not necessary that the Caliph should be an independent Prince, and he replied that his party would be quite ready to recognise the independence of the Sherif in Mecca and Medina. This was substantially all that Prince Sabah-ed-Din said with regard to the situation in Turkey, though he insisted at great length on the evils of Russia having possession of Constantinople, and 1 could see that his real object was to prevent this taking place. 1 will inform Captain Deeds of Prince Sabah-ed- Din’s views at the first opportunity, and he will be able to give an opinion as to what practical influence they may have in Turkey, and what actual power 1 Vince Sabah-ed-Din’s party has. 1 have, Ac., No. 14 (Secret'. Shepherds Hotel, Cairo, ^ r &gt; 14th July 1915. 1 have the honour in the following despatch to give a summary of the views of the various persons whom 1 have seen in Cairo who are repre sentative of various shades of Syrian, Arabian, Armenian, and Moslem opinion, and 1 venture to include herein an appreciation of certain phases of the situation as they may lie seen from this angle. I he Sultan. —Sir Henry MacMahon considered it advisable enough to introduce me to His Highness, and it happened that 1 saw him very soon nftei the late attempt upon his life. His bearing showed extreme courage and contempt of death, but at the same time it was not difficult to distinguish the grief which the outrage caused him in view of Ids devotion to his people. In the course of conversation His Highness expressed his conviction that Syiia.should form a part of the Egyptian Government. 1 think that this view is not the result of any personal ambition, but a natural desire on the pai t of a descendant of Mohammed All to restore once more the kingdom as the genius of the founder of his house conceived it. Moreover, it is a patent hu t ihat the position of His Highness is weak because his position as Sultan has no moial sanction of any kind in the eyes of Moslems. This is a mattei m which personal popularity and goodness of character can play no part. At present His Highness bears a title the Caliph alone can confer, yet has received his office at the hands of a Christian power. Had he been appointed by the assembly, or even invited to assume the position by a body of leligiously learned persons, he would have some claim on the allegiancek i C k \ of tlio native Aloslem iniml, ljut unfortunately any sucli opportunity lias now been let slip beyond recall. My impression is that His Highness feels this very keenly, and considers that his position would be far different if he were invited by the Syrians t° rule over them, lie would then have a moral sanction as being desired as ruler by a body of Moslems, this would react on tin 1 local Moslem view of his position, and he would enjoy the sense of being the bearer of something more than an imaginary title in the eyes of his subjects, llis Highness was, for this reason, I think, particularly anxious that Damascus at least should be included in the (lovernment of Egypt. In event of the Caliphate being assumed by the Sherif of Mecca it is particu larly desirable that the Sherif should proceed to confirm the Sultan of Egypt in his present title. Before giving the result of my further investigations, it is necessary to draw attention to a certain aspect of our position as regards France and the question of Syria. ■lust as our enemy’s agents work upon conscious and unconscious instru ments to keep Bulgaria and Greece in permanent opposition, in order to prevent them combining to assist us, and by the same means endeavour to disseminate mutual suspicions in the minds of the Russian and British peoples in regard to the fate of Constantinople, so it is obvious the same forces are at work to provoke discord between ourselves and France in regard to Syria. The methods pursued by which the result is arrived at are difficult to detect, but it is manifest that the idea is abroad that Great Britain and France each desire the whole of Syria from El Arish to Alexandretta for themselves As far as one can see this atmosphere of suspected rivalry is produced on the one hand by the known opinions of certain Frenchmen who favour the pushing of the Syrian claims of France to the furthest degree, these are no doubt stimulated by the influence of Ad. Vitalis who is himself moved by Huguenin who in turn is of German Constantinople Finance. On the other hand we have in the opposite direction the constant expression of Syrian Moslem hopes that Great Britain will take Syria. These hopes are very likely fostered in some devious way by the agents of the Committee ol Union and Progress. In this way suggestion of rivalry between Great Britain and France is prod need in Cairo, just as the suggestion of Anglo- Russian rivalry' is spread about in Athens and Sofia. In both cases the suggestions emanate from people who speak in all sincerity but whose views are traceable to ultimate sources of a hostile kind. Captain St. Quentin late Military attache at Constantinople attached to the French military mission in Egypt, whom I met, expressed his opinion to me that the idea of rivalry was fostered in some such way,_ and cited as examples the article in the Revue Hebdomadaire of June the 5th by Senator Ol/J 111 j i j n vy * personal considerations and his connection with M. a Swiss and not out of touch with the ramifications! Han din and the Anglo-phil gossip of local Syrians which was constantly teing dinned in the ears of Frenchmen in Egypt. In spite ol the fact that all discussions on this subject are forbidden in the press, and that the British authorities give no countenance to either view, the atmospheie of doubt remains amfwill remain until the British and French Governments clear up the matter bv some definite pronouncement. .... It will be seen from the above that in making any investigation in the matter of Syrian opinion or solution of the Turkish question, one was obliged to walk rather warily. . . . , T I will now proceed to give the views of the various persons whom I interviewed. Smd Pasha Shltaii!.- Expressed the view that annexation by France was undesirable from the Syrian point of view both Moslem and Christian, owing to the pet tv methods of French administration, the probability of navigation laws and tariffs in favour of French interests, the ruthless methods o exploitation practised by French concessionaires and the influence which financiers have with the French Government. He anticipated further that the French would develop religious antagonism by supporting Christians against Moslems, that from a narrow point of view this was desirable, but4 ultimately would prove contrary to the general good. He considered that a revolutionary scheme such as that sketched in Course I)., Map W ::: ' (though 1 had necessarily to be vague on this point) would only be possible if the various regions were under some form of European control, the Imperial army and fleet completely abolished, and the Imperial taxes subjected to International control. Dr. Fa it is Ximk.—E ditor of the Mokailam held similar views. He strongly objected to the division of Syria and Palestine, either as annexed territory or under devolution, though he thought if Damascus could be included in Palestine under British protection, and the Lebanon retained in Syria, there would be a considerable advantage to the Syrian Christians by the elimination of a large body of Moslems and a consequent increase in (he size of the Christian minority in Syria. He also expressed the view that the retention of even the shadow of Ottoman power under any devolutionary scheme was dangerous to Syrian interests owing to the ingrained subservience of Arabs to Turks in moments of crisis. 1 could hardly ascertain which he dreaded most, a recrudescence of Ottoman oppression or French financial exploitation. Neither Dr. Nimr nor Said Pasha Shucair had the slightest hope of an independent Syria holding together for a day. M. Bahikvjan. —The Tashnakest editor of the lloussapcr, whom 1 saw gave me what 1 believe are the intentions and aspirations of his party. He spoke with a tone of considerable certainty and some authority, and I should judge that he has a high position of an occult kind in the organi sation to which he belongs. He spoke somewhat slightly of Boghos Nubar Pasha, as a person wlio had only lately taken an interest in Armenian affairs, but owing to his rank and position the Tashnakest party had decided to use him as an instrument. He said that the Tashnakests would stand out for autonomy under international protection, but that they would be prepared to accept the suzerainty of Russia. He was very decided on the question of the division of Armenia, and made it quite clear no partition of greater and lesser Armenia would be accepted. lie stated that in the terms of settlement the Armenians would have no mercy on those who had expropriated lands during the last 30 years, and that such persons would be “ suppressed ” which term he subsequently used in connection with the 20 who were lately hanged at Constanti nople. On the other hand he said Armenians would be prepared to compound ancient Kurdish feudal rights. He told me that from private advices he had received no Moslems now survived in the city of Van, that the district was rapidly filling with refugees from the Caucasus, and that the Armenians hoped soon to be in possession of Mush. As regards the limits of Armenia, he showed me on a map an area very similar to that marked on Maps I. and II. He agreed that the “ six vilayets'” was only a vague term and that their boundaries were not satisfactory enough to form the basis of an autonomous vassal state, he was doubtful as to the inclusion of Sivas. Diarbekir, and Kaiseruk, but considered Erzerum and Erzinjian essential. As regards any devolutionary scheme he admitted that under devolution there were wider opportunities of ultimately developing a real independent state with an outlet on the Mediterranean and Black Seas, but urged that to get Armenians to go back to even nominal vassalage to the Ottomans would be a very difficult task, if they had actually won their independence. I was much struck by his grasp of detail on ethnographic and geo graphical problems, and his very close knowledge of the most minute personal circumstances obtaining in remote districts. Mourn Dix el Ki kdi. This person is a learned man, the chief of the Riwak-ul-Akrad of the A1 Azhar university, and is in consequence in touch with Kurdish opinion. As I had known him before the war he spoke very freely to me. He said that owing to language, religious divergence, and the wide determination of the Kurdish people in tribes that there could be no hope of a Kurdish state. Personally he believed that militant Islam was a * tie port of Interdepartmental Committee on Asiatic Turkey.\vaning foice, that Baliaism was typical of future developments. He said that the calamity of the present war (which lie regarded as a judgment on mankind) was of such magnitude that he could not believe that old traditions and formulae would survive it for long. l ie believed that when peace ultimately came that there would be a great spii itual and social change of a pacificist kind and that mankind, chastened by tribulation, would come together under some new dispensation. He said that no doubt political arrangements would be necessary and that external forms would be matters of consideration for a time, but that the growing force beneath the surface would eventually rise and reduce the existing symbols to things of slight importance. I lowev'er, speaking from a practical point of view, he said that it would be in the interests of humanity and accelerate the action of the good principle in the world, if the Allies (on the fall of Constantinople) were to humiliate and reduce the prestige of the Ottoman dynasty as much as possible. The dynasty represents the force of militarism in Asia as Prussia does in Europe, and so long as it retains the Caliphate and the Sultanate, the world will know no peace. I fe hoped that the Ottomans would be reduced to the position of simple Amirs of Anatolia, and that Irak and Damascus would be Sultanates like Egypt under the nominal suzerainty of the Sherif of Mecca and the actual protection of European powers. Rr.snin Rida. —In sharp contradiction to the foregoing view, is that of Shaykh Reshid Rida, who is a leader of Pan-Arab and Pan-Islamic thought. In conversation he talks much as he writes. 1 fe is a hard uncompromising fanatical Moslem, the mainspring of whose ideas is the desire to eliminate Christian influence and to make Islam a political power in as wide a field as possible. His mental arrogance is, 1 think, attributable chiefly to the idea that Creat Britain is afraid of Islam, and that British policy first and foremost is planned to sooth Moslem opinion and to concilitate Moslem prejudice. Though suave and well mannered, 1 can only describe his attitude as trucu lent. lie said that the fall of Constantinople would mean the end of Turkish military power, and therefore it was necessary to set up another Mohammedan state to maintain Mohammedan prestige. I asked him if the action of the Sultan in accepting the dictation of the German Emperor was in consonance with the independence of the Caliph, whether such people as Enver, Talaat, Javid, and Carasso could be considered as Moslems, whether the Committee of Union and Progress had not slaughtered Khojas and Ulema without mercy, whether the whole policy of the young Turks had not been originally anti-religious in the widest sense. To this he replied that in the eyes of Islam, Turkey represented Mohammedan independence, and that the actions of individuals had no influence on this view, and that when he had criticised the actions of the Committee, he had been subject to attack and loss of prestige. He gave it as his view that the Egyptians would never be reconciled to British tutelage, and that Indian Moslem discontent would increase as time went on, that vvhen Turkey fell Islam would require the setting up of an absolutely independent Arabia including Syria and Mesopotamia/under the Sherif. What struck me most was that he never pretended tor a moment that if .Great Britain assisted in this scheme there would be the slightest diminution of discontent either in India or Egypt. The liberties and con sideration given to Moslems by Great Britain in the past did not seem to him to be causes for gratitude, in fact he is so obsessed with the imaginary idea that Islam actually is an independent world state, and that Moslems can dictate British policy almost in the tone of conquerors, that he cannot brin' himself to make the slightest concession or hold out any hope of actual friendship and loyalty on the part of Moslems. Further, he said that if Great Britain did not fall in with Moslem views she would lay herself open to the great danger of a permanent alliance S. 25)0.between Moslem opinion and tlie great power of Germany which was the leading lorce in material and political science, which would survive the war no matter who won. His ideal was that the Sherif should rule over Arabia and all the country south of the line Maarash, Diarbekir, Zakhu, Rowanduz, that the Arabian chiefs should each rule in his own district, and that Syria and Irak should be under constitutional governments. He resolutely refused to entertain any idea of control or advisers with executive authoritity of anv kind. He held that the Arabs were more intelligent than Turks and that they could easily manage their own a Hairs ; no argument would move him on this point; the suggestion of partitition or annexation he countered by the statement that there were already German officers who had become Moslems, that more would do so, and that England would hardly dare annoy her numerous Moslem subjects in India and elsewhere. I understand that Shaykh Reshid Rida has no great personal following but that his ideas coincide with those of a considerable number of the Arab Ulema. It will be seen that it is quite impossible to come to any under standing with people who hold such views, and it may be suggested that against such a party force is the only argument that they can understand. My interviews lead me to believe that it is important that Great Rritain and France should come to some understanding as soon as possible with regard to Syria. * * * * As to the method to be adopted, I feel that the choice lies between (curse A., Map 11 , and Course !&gt;., Map IV.

In the following despatch l propose to give an analysis of certain intellectual forces at present developing in the Islamic world of the Near East, ?.e., Egypt, Arabia and the Ottoman Empire. The present war has struck the world at a time when Islam is in a period of transition. The transition is not marked by the conflict of two or more theological and political schools with definite names, and consequently it is left rather to the observer to distinguish and group the different forms of thought for himself. Outwardly Sunni Islam is united, but internally it is divided, though the divisions are not openly hostile to one another. The line of cleavage may be described as that of the divergence between those who are chiefly influenced by the past on one hand and by European inclination on the other. It would, however, be entirely confusing to label these nameless parties Conservative and Liberal, or Progressive and Re actionary, since any such appellations would be entirely false—on the ancient side may be found the vital germs of later developments, systems of philosophy of the broadest and most advanced type —among the most violent and pronounced of the moderns, a savage unreasoning fanaticism of the most primitive nature. It is necessary to make this initial digression owing to the fact that the ancients and moderns (if a name may be given) are outwardly distinguishable by appearances, i.e., dress, custom, and manner of expression, which tend to give rise to a false impression to the superficial observer. Thus a young Turk may resemble the advanced politician of Europe or America, a follower of Bahai may appear to be a picturesque survival of the past, whereas fundamentally the young Turks ideas are in no wise different from those of the Jannissaries of the 15th century, while the turbaned philosopher would readily appreciate the theories of lolstoi or Mr. Bernard Shaw. Keeping to the names of ancients and moderns, but carefully eliminating any European analogies which the names may suggest, 1 venture to distinguish the various sub-divisions on both sales as follows : — Ancients. Class I.—The first class on the ancient side may be justly described as orthodox. This -type of mind is soaked in Mohammedan learning and prejudice j is hard, unyielding, bigoted and fanatical, desnes no ( hcinge, ami is wedded to a close observance of formulae and nice distinctions of cleanliness of person and propriety of conduct. The advance of Europe has embittered these thinkers against Christians, till the\ uie (Ain moic violent and sour in their sentiments against Christendom than their forefathers. The best known type of this class is Sheikh Shawish. Class II.—The second class among the ancients are those who, while as meticulous and scrupulous in matters of form, belong to a type that Islam has always known since the days of Abu Beki, the fiist oithodox Caliph. That is a type of mind which is generous, kindly, tolerant and hopeful, with a strict sense of duty which is tempered by a profound sense of justice and devotion to religion which is divorced irom political ambition. l\pical of this is the late Sheikh Mohammed Abdu and the Crand Kadi of the Sudan. Class III —Though somewhat rarer than either of the preceding two, this class is not to be forgotten, and that is the body of educated Moslems8 who, while devoted to the culture and habits of the past, are moving along the path of unorthodox mysticism, which knows no immutable formulae nor restriction of thought. These may be recognised in persons like the Grand Shelabi of Konia, who is equally conversant with Oriental and Occidental ideas, or the Bahai whose teaching ha§ found some adherents in England and the United States. Class I.— The highest type among the moderns, is a person of good family who has entirely absorbed a Western education, and in the process has become, as far as supernatural affairs are concerned, an agnostic, and in mode of life a person who eats and dresses as an European. However, this class labours under a decided disadvantage in being mentally unable to absorb one of Hie basic ideas of European civilisation, and that is the idea of nationalism. Having behind them centuries of Islamic tradition which knows politically neither colour, tongue, nor frontiers, members of this class are entirely baffled by the fundamental notion which runs through all European teaching, which somehow connects past glories and wrongs with a real or imaginary combination of language and blood. Thus to preach nationalism to Bulgarians was easy enough ; though the Bulgarian people have a borrowed tongue, and are a mixture of autochthonous and invading peoples, a modicum of song, legend and fragmentary history was sufficient to revive or invent a nation which is now a grim reality. To a Moslem, be he Syrian, Egyptian, or Turk this is literally impossible; there is nothing real, conscious or sub-conscious, which responds to the call of nationalism as an European understands the word. However, though the real meaning of nationalism is literally incomprehensible and unappreciable, they accepfthe European idea of nationalism which underlies all European teaching and apply it inevitably to Islam ; that is to the misty political idea of a vague Caliphate vaguely ruling over a number of confederations of Moslems who form the dominant political force in the region they inhabit, whether in a majority or a minority. I have been obliged to elaborate this idea at some length owing to the fact that it governs all the actions and thoughts of those on the ^modern side. ( lass I., whose characteristics I have already summarised, apply the ideal of Nationalism to Islam on moderateand reasonable lines ; being already of an European State. However, it mufet always be remembered that such peisons, no matter how similar to us in thougnt and carriage they may seem, are separated from us by an immense, if invisible gulf, and for the reasons above stated cannot spontaneously recognise Christians of their own tono-ue and blood as their co-nationalists, for though they no longer believe in the Prophet they still believe in the Muslemin. ( lass IP Ihe second among the moderns are the poor, incompetent, or criminal who have received an inferior European education, and whose minds by circumstance or temperament, or both, are driven into more sinister channels than the first class. Just as the members of Class I. apply the catch words, phrases, and machinery of European Nationalist Liberalism to Ulam, so do Class 11. apply the methods and violence of European Jacobinism, Nihilism, Revolutionary Socialism and Anarchism to the body politic of Sunni Mahommedanism, their position is mentally less confused than Class I. for they have taken a cosmopolitan European doctrine and applied it to an international religious organisation. Members of this class inevitably drift towards the Committee of Union and Progress or its kindred or affiliated revolutionary societies. In office their methods are those of the french Commune, when out of office those of Ravachol. They combine the fanaticism of Islam with the desperate ideas of International'Anarchy. In theory they are atheists, but in practice they are Ghazis or Fedais. In Moderns. prosperous they desire no revolution, and where, as in Egypt, their majority is unchallengable, they are ready to work on strictly constitutional lines, to break up into parties and generally behave as if they were the inhabitantsAn considering this class it is well to remember that in the middle Orient, secret societies o! political assassins are of ancient date; in 1100 ad. the devotees of the Old Man of the Mountain made his power felt equally in the courts of Christendom and Islam. Having analysed-the main components of Islamic thought in the Near Last, it is well to point out that there are innumerable links in both the ancient and modern chains. The classes described are stages in the scale of mentality and between each one there are a variety of compromises. It now remains to consider two fundamental bonds of an accidental nature which affect various sections of the people. The Asiatic Arab Moslems have a strong bond of union m their language, and a certain moral superiority owing to their language being that of the Koran. An Arab always will give precedence to an Arab over another Moslem, and, further, Arabs as a whole regard themselves as the aristocracy of Islam, since practically all the noble and sacred houses are of Arab or pseudo-Arab descent. The Ottoman Turks owing to the prestige of the Ottoman dynasty have the sense of material superiority, the superiority of physical force ; between the two there is a silent rivalry and antipathy, though each admits tacitly the other’s claims. The above fact is mentioned here for it must ever be borne in mind that the Turkish sense of physical dominion is common to every class of Turk, while the Arab’s sense of superiority of breed is never absent from the Arab’s mind. Lastly, it must be remembered that the vast uneducated Moslem masses are entire strangers to the distinctions which separate these nameless schools of thought, but are always susceptible to outbursts of fanatical rage, and can always be relied upon when inspired by official or semi-official promptings to rise in riot and disorder in the name of religion, providing that the machinery of retribution is not visible and at hand. In the problems which His Majesty’s Government is now facing in the Levant, Egypt, Arabia and Irak, the above factors, racial and spiritual will doubtless play a cons'durable part, and in deciding on a policy it might be profitable to examine the way in which the various influences work. In Egypt we have on the side of the ancients to face the absolute hostility of Class 1. who seem to have captured the pan-Arab movement, the benevolent apathy of Class II., and the mild approval of Class III. who have hardly any influence. As regards the moderns we have the constitutional opposition of Class I. which is large, and the unforgiving enmity of Class 11. which is subject to the influence of tiie Committee of Union and Progress. On the Western desert side we have the Senussi, a movement which lies somewhere between Classes 1. and 11. (ancient), but is falling under the gradually increasing influence of Class 11. (modern). It may here be pointed out that'as in other political struggles extremes sometimes meet, and the modern anarchist Moslem is often in alliance with the fanatic of the old school, the bond of hatred of Christendom being sufficient to blind the adherents of each cause to the incongruity of the unbending dogmatism of the one with the aggressive freethiliking of the other. In Svria it may be assumed that the case is somewhat different Classes II. I'ancient) and I. (modern) are probably more favourably disposed to us than in Egypt, and Class II. (modern) is rare owing to the antipathy between Arabs and Turks and the good influence of the French Jesuit and American Colleges at Beirut, though it may be noted that the latter institution has of late lost somewhat in discipline and moral. The anti-Christian and violent element in Syria will therefore lie chiefly' with Class I. (ancient), who will be indirectly influenced by the subterranean intrigues of the \oung lurks at Constantinople. In Anatolia and Constantinople the Committee, which is Class II. (modern), is in the complete ascendant and holds all other schools of thought m absolute servitude, though there is this distinction to be considered, the violent Class I. (ancient) is almost non-existent, and if the Young Turks u-e eliminated Class II. and 111. (ancient) would be found to be in great •ength. I lowever, the slow-moving Turkish intellect and the innate Turkish c, zzs we sti S. 290.1 U apathy which is so easily mistaken for philosophic calm makes this class worthless as a dynamic force, and it can only bo reckoned on as a sort of melancholy and benevolent negative. Turning to Upper Mesopotamia and Irak, that is the country lyino- between the triangle Mosul-Aleppo-Basra. 1 think it will be found that Class 1. (ancient) is'the force to be reckoned with and will include the urban notables, tax-farmers, landlords, Kurdish beys and religious chiefs, who have hitherto had considerable opportunities of squeezing, robbing and intriguing and who will be stimulated to fanaticism by fear of financial loss. Owing to the mixture of races in this region the Young Turks will have better opportunities of exciting and combining with this class than in Syria. However it must not be supposed that Class II. (ancient) (and owing to Persian influence, Class III.), is not a potential power for order and co-operation, it will include the merchants who are numerous, and a good number of Moslems who have large incomes from legitimate sources. The European educated Baghdadis will tend to fall into Class I. rather than Class If., as hitherto such education has been generally confined to the sons of persons of some substance. Taking Arabia as a whole the matter rests with Classes I. and II. (ancient), all others being eliminated, and the course of events will be regulated by the outside influences affecting them. 'The Egyptian and Syrian Pan-Arabs belonging to Class 1. (ancient) who are indirectlv stimulated by the distant Committee will be the hostile force. In considelmg this pioblem it will be seen that if the above analysis is correct (and I feel some confidence that it is) our policy towards Islam may tall into a definite line.. As regards Class I. (ancient) I feel that it is quite useless to endeavour to soothe or gentle it : we need only be careful never to give it a just cause for complaint, and when its members complain that British and other Christian missionaries cause adultery and usury, or make similar insolent representations, give them a short and unfriendly answer. In Class II. (ancient) lies our greatest hope, and if by wise and tactful methods we can increase its power and obtain its active support, much will be . one to ensure the peace not only of our own borders but of mankind as a whole I he A 1 Azhar and the Government of Mecca, which at present both lean in this direction, with sympathisers among the Ulema in Syria, Anatolia and rak could practical y sway the whole tendency of ancient Islam thought and curb the unformed masses of peasant, and urban, and nomadic population. As far as the moderns are concerned, it is manifest that Class I is the only real force that can counteract permanently the efforts and control the i«k msot influence of ( lass II which, 1 believe, we shall always have with us. 1 he method to be pursued which suggests itself to me is that we should be prepared to make concessions to this class, no matter how unpalatable so long as we in no way compromise the fundamental principles of justice in icgai d to the treatment of Christian and mystic minorities the financial probity of the administration and the checking of intimidation I,v notables or clubs of anarchists and fanatics With regard to Class tlf (ancient) ive should do well to watch develop ments in tins direction, and in event of the arising of a new religions cult be prepared to prevent its persecution, since it is little likely that the next plmse of religious development will be in the direction of violence and austerity such as the Wahabi or Senussi movements, but more probably n the directum of mrst.csm and pacificism, as instanced in the developments of Habism and Rahatsm i’hese developments will not in all probability bave any influence m Arabia proper, but may grow where the pure Semitic blood is mixed with Iranian and other elements in Irak Syria and In conclusion I should like to mention that in the above despatch I have omitted as much detail as was possible in order to give the outlines of acoherent general policy with regard to Islam in the Near East. 1 am unacquainted with the stage of Indian Mohammedanism, but I think the suggestions included in this despatch might be of interest to the India Office. Majord Jeneral E. C. Calhvell, ITirector of Military Operations, W ar Ofiice. I have, &amp;c., No. 19 (Secret). Aden, Sir, l()th August 191'). In the following despatch I have the honour to give the results of various conversations with the further persons whom the 1 Ligh Commissioner recommended me to see in connection with the situation in Turkey. Sy’ad P. Z.yglool. 1 had two interviews with His Excellency Sa’ad P. Zaglool, who is still regarded as the leader of constitutional opposition. Sa’ad P. Zaglool, in the course of many observations, expressed the opinion that to those of advanced views the declaration of a Protectorate had come as a disheartening blow, inasmuch as it put an end to the theory that the occupation was not a permanent institution. He, however, agreed that the idea of an absolutely independent Egypt was not one which could be entertained, and that for purposes of defence, finance, and foreign relations Egypt must always depend on some other Power. With regard to the position of the Sultan and the want of moral sanction to his title, with its effect on the people, he considered that the popular attitude was inevitable but nevertheless bad for Egypt, He cited the attitude of the people in the Mosques who inevitably give a loud “ Amen ' when the prayer is raised for the Caliph, but remain silent when prayer is uttered for the Sultan. This weekly demonstration of passive ill-will lie considered demoralising and of ill-omen for the future. In reply to a question as to how this could be ameliorated, Sa’ad P. Zaglool referred to the likelihood of a change of Caliphate and the possibility of a proper investiture which would go some way towards putting things on a better footing. As \\'as natural in one in his position, he considered also that if the Sultan could announce an extension of the power of the Chamber, and the initiation of something approaching local autonomy in matters which concerned native 1 affairs alone, would have an improving effect. On this subject he seemed to regard Caisse de la Dette, Suez Canal, mixed courts, capitulations, Anglo-Sudanese administration, the army, and foreign relations as beyond the Chamber’s powers as far as legislation or executive control were concerned. . At anv rate he appeared in this matter to hold moderate views, and it must be admitted that the existence of a Chamber with purely consultative powers must always give rise to hopes and ambitions that it will eventually become something more. . T i . i Sa’ad Pasha mentioned the prooable Imperial Conference that would take place at the end of the war and appeared attracted by the idea of the Egyptian Chamber sending a delegate. He said that this had two meanings, one that the presence of°a representative at the Conference made Egypt an integral „irt of the British Empire,. which was contrary to the ideas of extreme nationalists; on the other hand the acceptance of a representative at the Imperial Conference was of the nature of a guarantee that the limitations of the 1 Egyptian constitution were not immutable. . . . . \s regards the Committee of Union and Progress and its activities in E^*pt Sa’ad P Zaglool was obliged to admit that it was not Moslem nor patriotic but he had no answer to give as to why its propaganda should be acceptable to Egyptians he said that only the ignorant were thus led away, on the other hand it cannot be said that any enlightened Egyptians including .So’id P Zaolool himself take anv steps to counteract such propaganda.12 Shaykh SiJAKHi.—I also saw Shaykli Shakir, Secretary of the A1 Azhar University, who is a man of very moderate views, and professes to take no interest in politics. As regards the present crisis in the Mohammedan world he said that a change of Caliphate was essential to peace, and he seemed to anticipate the advent of the Sheri f of Mecca. However, he further expressed the opinion that the greatest danger at present arose from the evil influence of quasi- European education on the student class. He cited the fact that English University teaching had had a completely demoralising effect on both Egyptian and Indian Moslems he had known, making them violent and discontented and filling them with destructive notions. He thought that if the A1 Azhar University v as developed and reformed, it might prove a great moderating influence in the Islamic world ; he admitted that it was natural that in such an institution there should he many schools ol thought among its members, some of whom were entirely opposed to British policy, but on ihe other hand he considered that it did not produce that virulent type of anarchist which so often results from alien teaehino-. He also laid stress on the world wide influence of the A1 Azhar, and the fact that in composition it was practically international, and that if it continued tv) Houiish, and worked on sound lines it might do much to stabilise Mohammedan thought in India and elsewhere. As an example in support of Shaykh Shakir’s views 1 might cite a pamphlet written by Shaykh M. El Kalkali, a Syrian graduate of The Azhar a translation of the preface to which I enclose. The preface in itself shows the lines bn which an Anglo-phil Moslem thinks, and doubtless reflects the feelings and views of many, but it would be almost impossible for a man who had received a quasi-European education or had only been to an English university to think or write in this particular wav.

From a political point of view it is especially important that we should risk as little fighting as possible against those who will some day become our proteges or subjects, and that our penetration should be rather as a friendly than a hostile power; however, to achieve this we must have a clear understanding with France and be ready to take immediate advantage of any favourable circumstances in the area mentioned.

Arabs would agree to accept as approximate northern frontier Alexandretta Aintab- Berijik-l rfa-Midiyat-Zakho-Kowanduz.. Arabs would agree to convention with France, granting her a monopoly of all concessionary enterprise in Syria and Palestine, Syria being delined as bounded by Euphrates as far south as Deir Zor and from thence to Deraa, and along llejaz railway to Ma’an. llejaz railway as far south as Amman could be sold to French conces sionaires. Arabs would further agree to employ none but Frenchmen as advisers, and European employees in this area. Note Arabs will not under take to employ Europeans if they can do without them, but Faruki points out that this stipulation is to avoid any shadow of control. Arabs would agree to all French educational establishments having special recognition in this area. Arabs would agree to an identical convention with Great Britain as regards the remainder of greater Arabia, viz., Irak and Jazirah, and North Mesopotamia. Further, Arabs would agree to any territory north of the greater Arabian frontier being French possessions under the French Hag. Arabs would agree to Basra town and all cultivated lands ro the south being British territory. Arabs would be prepared to make a treaty with the Entente Powers : — (1) Undertaking on their part to have no diplomatic relations with Turkey-Germany or Austria for a period of 15 years. (2) On part of Entente Powers to guarantee to protect independence of Arabs. Further, a treaty of alliance with Entente Powers giving them freedom of movement in Greater Arabia, and use of railways in Arabian area for duration of war. Entente troops in Arab territories to be on same footing as British troops in blunders. Entente troops to evacuate teiiitoiies on cessation of hostilities. ^ Faruki insisted that this was dependent on Entente landing at a point between Mersina and Alexandretta, and making good Amauus pass or Oilician Gates. He further stipulated that Sheri! should not take action until thi* had been done. I agree that any other course is out of the question, and that to call on Sherd' or Arabs to take action until we had made aforesaid passes secure would be impossible, kariiki also urged the necessity of immediate and adequate action in Governor of Alexandretta, addin ' 1 that if Entente did not take this opportunity Germans would lore- stall them, and once Turks or Germans got into Syria, Arabs would m their own interests he obliged to reconsider situation, bor my own pait am sure there can be no idea of Arabs merely troubling Turks in an advance on the (Anal If we allow Turks into Syria Arabs will side with them m order to obtain special consideration, Germans having already suggested the idea of Turco-Arabia on the same lines as Austria-Hungary. 1 will &gt;'ive observations on less important aspects in a further telegram.

In continuation of my No. 19 on hypothesis that Faruki’s interview is basis of our arrangement with Arabs, I submit ( 1 ) As regards France and Arabs, our task is to get Arabs to concede as much as possible to the French, and to get our Haiffa outlet and I alestine included in our sphere of enterprise in the form of a French concession to us Thus we smooth the way for France with the Syrians and in a matter where France has a traditional interest, deal directly with her.

The Government of Mosul and Frfa will 1 be disorderly, and Arab state will probably have to ask for our assistance the Arabs of northern Arabia Proper will light indecisively amoim themselves. . * ^ fb) In event of our letting this opportunity go, the Arabs in Syria and north Mesopotamia will, I believe, delinitely fall in with the Turks 'in order to get best terms for nationalist aspirations from those whom they would then regard as certain winners.

Personally, with memory of my journey fresh in my mind, 1 feel exceedingly anxious as to effect of a passive canal defensive on whole near Eastern and Arabian situation. It appears to me its moral effect will be cumulative. If Turks reoccupy Syria, I anticipate that they will capture the Arabs, destroy the Christians, and establish themselves permanently in the Holy places with a puppet Shciil. Even if the} do not attack canal, a menace will suflice to produce unrest in Egypt. They will further be able to oblige us, without any tioubh to themselves, to maintain an additional force in Mesopotamia, where wastage from sickness increases with the size of the army. Under these circumstances an otherwise desirable peace might be dangerous to us. ddius, if Germany made liberal offers in France, Belgium, Servia, Italy and Bussia, she might be in a position to keep Ottoman Empire in Asia intact owing to a general hunger for peace among the masses of allies. In this event our position in the East becomes precarious. We could not retain Mesopotamia, except with a large army and we should be obliged either to evacuate it as a result of peace, or hold it at the subsequent mercy of the Turks. The Baghdad Hailway would be completed under German auspices. The permanent garrison of Egypt would have to be larger than heretofore. The influence of the Turks on Indian Pilgrims would be a permanent factor in Indian Mohammedan politics. In the eyes of all Mohammedans we should have been beaten by .the Turks if not by the Germans. For Great Britain to have to face such a situation in the condition of exhaustion and reaction succeeding on tin; war would, to my mind, be most dangerous to our future in the East. I suggest that possibly French may not appreciate our position owing to fact that their hold on North Africa is that of out-and-out conquerors backed by policy of colonisation and denationalisation of conquered, whereas we control purely by prestige and geographical position.c SECRET. POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. III. THE ARAB MOVEMENT. Memorandum In Lieut.-Col. Sir Mark Svkes, Bart., M.P. The following Memorandum is intended to serve as a general appreciation of the Arab situation in the Ottoman Empire, and to give an analysis of the various human, religious, and political factors of which it is composed. THE ARAB PEOPLE. The Arabs may be said to fall into four groups : (1) The Arabs of Arabia proper, marked green on the accompanying map ; (2) the Arabs of Meso potamia, marked yellow ; (M) the Syrians, marked red ; (4) the Arabs of Northern Irak and 4a/irah, marked blue. Guoui 1 I.—THE ARABS OF ARABIA. The Arabs of Arabia fall socially under two heads,.the settled urban population and vdlag'e population, ami tne Bedawin. Religiously they may be divided as follows The Arabs of Hejaz who are Sunnis. The Arabs of Xejd who are Wahabis. The Arabs of the Gulf Coast who are Sunnis. The Arabs of Muscat who are Bond is. The Arabs of Yemen and A sir who are Shias. The Arabs of Hadhramaut who are Sunnis and Shias. In Arabia proper there is no sense of nationality but a strong sense of race, blood, and common language, something approaching the sense ot unity compatible with war which prevailed in Western Europe in the 11th and 12 th centuries. , . „ . . , , i In Neid political power devolves on chieftains who dwell in towns and are more or less supported by the local outlying tribes. Feuds and wars are chronic and are not waged with any intention ol out-and-out success m» I bn Saud and Ibn Iteshid have been at war for three generations, Imtiuth no definite result. The various tribes who support the rival families absent themselves from battle cr change sides with very little compunction, 01 ^' 'xhe 'following incident will serve to throw a light on the peculiar and dpmiltorv nature of these hostilities: T During the present war Major Keyes, our representative at Halirein, was asked to send Ibn Saud some ammunition and war stores to HoluJ. lie proceeded to the coast, but finding that the Arabs between the coast and lofuf were at war with Ibn Saud. he returned to Bahrein. Ibn Sand sent a ■ ness ioe askin' why the stores had not been sent, and on being told the •easoT he repM that if the tribe at war with him were give,, the stuff they ieason, CO urse as thev were the ordinary carriers. I ms would sem and the g 00 d’s delivered, although the hostilities still was.- t j, . vi il therefore be understandable that war or hostilities need mYl'ie a bar to Vmimai unity, such as the acceptance of the Sherd as paramount chief. S. 291.Iho religious divergences^ are also not of intense importance, the old fanatic lire of Wahabi 1’uritanism apparently being on the wane. In Muscat the case is different, the isolation of Oman from the rest of Arabia being a strong factor in the situation. In Muscat there is a distinct quarrel, and the Sultan lias been ousted from In's authority in the land bv a pretender to religious supremacy. This is a purely local affair and the exceedingly rigid and primitive form of Islam prevailing in Oman has no adherents elsewhere. However, the Oman Arabs, the Sultan included h ive a strong sense of race and breed. ’ e In I emeu and Assir the large proportion of sedentary and vilhme- dwellmg Arabs, the long reign and prestige of the Imam, the large number oi men he can raise and keep in the field tend to produce a more compre hensible situation Yemen in fact is a nearer approach to a State in the Iviropean sense than any other part of Arabia. In the Aden hinterland and Hadhramaut the sedentary ( hiels are too widely scattered and too snnll to be of any great account. Turkish influence in Yemen is tolerated the r‘' do - 8 ' ,' U , e to J 3UpP ° r i tile Turks 111 war and collecting his own taxes I he Shiism oi the Yemen Arabs, has nothing in common with that of tiie people of Iverbella, which will be referred to later. The Imam claims to be commander of the faithful in Ids own dominions and does not regard the Sultan as caliph; his relations with the Sherif of Meci a aie Ian, and, under given circumstances, there is no reason whv he should not recognise the latter’s premier position, though lie wemldnaturally not recognise him as caliph. miuuam vr i 1 - 11 ,,e i az the situation is influenced by the holy cities of Mecca and * e hiia, which are large towns which subsist on pilgrimage the Bedouin sharing m the profits of carriage, traffic, and dues. The Sherif iris a stror' position m virtue of his character, lineage, financial resources and office a d few very bitter and no powerful enemies His relation* Avitlt ti i f !- Simaa Ihn Reshid, Ibn* Sand are good-enonV^rbre't ^“'and't’ cbtivalef, 'S they have suffered considerably in the past.

To understand this it is necessary to recollect a little of the previous history of the country. Kerbella was the centre of Ali’s caliphate, and was not only the stronghold of the lost cause of the Alid house after Ali s death, but also the centre of a sect known as the Kharyites or anarchists who interpreted the doctrine of private judgment as not only applying to religious matters but also to ordinary law. 1 his sect has disappeared in naine, but in essence survives, among these Arabs ol Mesopotamia. After the death of Ali lower Mesopotamia was in constant rebellion and the scene of many persecutions, both under the Omayads and Abbassids. It was also the resort of all Shia pilgrims to the shrines of the Alid martyrs and saints ir contained. With the death of the tenth Imam and the spread of the legend that he had disappeared to return again, the population became rebels against constituted authority, but with no policy, since their candidate 5 was not to appear until the end of the world. hver disorderly at the best of times, when the Abbassid civilisation collapsed, these people sank into a complete anarchy and have never since recovered. They bitterly dislike Christians as such, Sunnis whether Turks or Arabs, worse than Christians, and are hostile to Persians on racial grounds. This area, therefore, presents a separate problem ; its inhabitants are broken up among themselves, and have no natural alhnitv to any external movement. It must also be remembered that to Indian and Persian Shias the shrines of Nejef and Kerbella are more than Mecca is to Sunnis, as Shiism is a passionate and sentimental creed, and its poetry and traditions are that of a tragically lost cause Lhe pan-Arab movement in this area can have little force, and the Shenf of Meccano following. During the early part ol the present war the I urks, with con siderable ability, worked up considerable enthusiasm among the people on the oTounds of repelling infidels who desired to pollute the holy places. The r&gt; Russian action at Meshed and elsewhere has had consuleiable influence on the minds of the urban peoples of the Nejei-lverbella aiea. The only sign of interest in outside events traceable m this area was the telegram sent to Constantinople when Mr. Parker profaned the mosque o Omar a few years ago. Group III.—SYRIA. • „ tn .Uj, area we find a situation extremely different from that i ' rfn the oreceding two The material and intellectual civilization part of the Ottoman Empire, and inn.any respects confonns with that of Southern Europe—it is equal to that ol Spain, Cal ddm reTolilhr' this difference can he traced to several factors, (a) The f .. |j| e Ommayad dynasty primarily replaced Uiristianin by Islam tact, that tne wnu.

On ot ^J n Arabia pro p e r, without any Arabian l^ tr &gt; o£ a “4stnTr Turkish influence. The Ottoman Turks have niteruiingbng of era, ou jj k&gt; au d have as a matter of fact, :;;rcm,LlemUe 1 .;: of Syrians in the Government ol the country, and the 0 ‘ B Tim malntlluem'l hl^Zlntry are Jerusalem, Damascus, Beyrut, the Lebanon, Aleppo. alld Moslems are brought together partly , l ' •'rA’ltt a A partly by the constant intercourse necessitated by the tourist aud pilgrim traffic. A. ^ S. 291.Damascus is a centre of Syrian Islam, and its people somewhat fanatically inclined, but there is a strong leaven of toleration among the leading Moslem clergy, and a considerable bent towards hrench and English culture among the rising generation of the aristocratic houses. Similar to Damascus are Homs and Hama, but in these latter places fanaticism is more easily roused. Boy rut with the Jesuit ('ojlege and the American Syrian Prostestant College is the mainspring of European influence on the Arab and Syrian mind, has been the scene in later years of much fraternisation between Moslems and Christians and is the natural fountain of the idea of Arab nationalism i.e.. Arab nationalism embracing Arabs of Christian, Moslem, and Druse origin. The Lebanon is the stronghold of French political influence througdi the hold of the Jesuits of Beyrut on the Maronites. It is the most progressive part of Syria, but there still survives a certain feeling of religious antago nism between Maronites and Druses and Maronites and Mohammedans dwelling outside the Lebanon, though among the better educated there have been considerable efforts to stifle and mitigate this evil. The last area, that lying between Tripoli, Alexandretta. Marash, and Meskene, may be described as Aleppine Syria. Here there is a strong Turkish influence owing to the mixture of Turkish and Kurdish settlers, and the existence of Armenians in many parts. Conseciuently there are Turks who pass as Arabs owing to the fact that they are of the second generation, and there is a reflex of the Armenian question which is apt to make the mob range itself on the Turkish side in political questions. The main factors in this group are Diarbekir-Urka. N. Jazirah. Mosul. Kerkuk. Baghdad. Diarbekir-LTiu is Tureo-Kurdo-Arab, and heavily implicated in the Armenian massacres, and therefore not really a part of*the Arab movement, A. Jazirah is hurdo-Arab nomadic and anti-1 harbekir. The Kurds are practically with the Arabs in this area anti-Turkish, and solar not implicated in the Armenian question. Mosul is practically solid for the Arab movement, and normally the relations between the Christians ami Moslems are fair, and with K oo,l ontside inllnences capable of fusion. Iverkuk is strongly influenced by the Kurds, but the Kurds of good education are on the Arab side. Baghdad and to the North is influenced by the fact that there is a strong Jewish Oibna element I he Shias are a cause of want of solidarity; the dews, oOUOO in nun.Iter, are pro-Ottoman, and Committee of Union and liaXtT rT re ' nam ,' 11S l A T ,S a *: e 011 lhe Arab side, as also are the Baghdadi i urks, i.e., lurks of pre-Ottoman times. On the above groundwork we have the Arab movement, which is natural, spontaneous, hut unorganised. ’ It has its origin (a) in the sense of breed common to all Arabs • ( 6 ) the S^k e em ec -dl ir m '| 01 T’ ’ S ^ driving power originates in Kyi 1 . 1 , especially Iteyrut Its organisation includes military officers drawn lion, all parts, the notables ol Syria, the clergy, the ('hristhms of Syria I hese persons have moved the Sherif of Mecca and spread' the idea among the Arabian chieftains. 1 I he sentiments vary, hut there are certain common factors On the whole the Arabs are pro-Knglish and anti-French but this anti- french feeling ts chiefly due to fear of French financial exploitation the hymns favour and preach alliance with native Christians, but this as the tacit hostility of a certain element m the clergy. This feeliim would be strongest m Aleppo, Baghdad, and Mosul.% The groundwork of the movement is real, but nevertheless the movement is incapable of action except with strong active support. The German-Turkish policy is obvious, to foment the feeling between Moslems and Christians, exterminate the Christians, kill the Sherif, and capture the Arab Moslems by according national concessions at the psycho logical moment, while menacing with overwhelming force. If the Germans succeed in keeping France and England divided, they will capture the Arab Moslems for good and all, and we shall then be confronted with a real Jehad. If we settle with the French and support the Arabs, we shall establish a strong anti-Turkish block in the very centre of Islam. FINAL NOTE. The Indian Moslems are politically and racially against the Arabs. The Arabs regard the Indians with contempt on account of their poverty, physique, and ignorance of religion. The Indians being pro-Turkish are anti- Arab.
