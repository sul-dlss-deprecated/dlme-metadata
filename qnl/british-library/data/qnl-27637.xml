WALTON K I have received your two letters of 19th May and have looked up the /Tull official reports which we received at the time regarding the incidents preceding your resignation of your appointment at Muscat. I can assure you that there is no justification whatever for your inferences as to Col. Biscoe’s procedure, to say nothing of the further inference - which I cannot take seriously - as to his motive. If you wish to be considered a candidate for any suitable post which might come to our notice, we should obviously have to be prepared to state the circumstances which led to the termination of your employment at Muscat, and consequently to state that in the first instance you tendered your resignation. I cannot see why you should dislike this, or the way in which the matter is dealt with in Sir E. Howell's testimonial which «twlrat^ei 1 uve“?nny blnj'ik)- does noi state or imply that your step was hasty or ill considered, but states that it was taken ’'on account of a genuine difference of opinion with the local British Authorities on . / certain administrative questions”.c/o Iraq Petroleum Company, Haifa, Palestine. I am very anxious to remove from your mind, and 'rom the Foreign Secretary's, the impression that my resignation was precipitate. I had no wish to enlarge up^n the delinquencies of a senior representative of -• of India, out unless you are in possession of all t'. fc ' ,ts you cannot arrive at a fair judgement iin thin matter. The object of this letter is to -ive O’*’ certain information which is, I believe, unknown to you or to Sir E. Howell. nt ... ^etter -roa Karachi to Major (now Colonel) Fowie. 11.B The implications of this letter were such that I told Fowie I should be compelled to resign, and two days later I officially tendered my resignation to the Muscat Council of St ts. The remarkable thing about this letter was that a was( 5 : written two days before Gol.Blscoe was due to neet tne Foreign Secretary at DelUi # The financial situation ih Muscat was so serious that both the Council of State and a. self had sent sent official requests to the Resident, asking him to reconsider a previous decisioi of uis; and in addition I had asked that, failing a favourable outcome, the matter might be referred to India for a ruling. Yet .hen the vierc of the foreign Secretary as to the best means of meeting these exceptional requests could have been ascertained, Col.Biscoe settles the matter him self: not merely failing to represent my views to the Govt, of India, but by this letter definitely refusing to do so. -t may be advisable to give no ,e father details con cerning this letter. It v-.s written in reply to a despatch of Fowle’s rt-ivln-? his comments on my tire &lt;Tbtrncif f 3 requests for Col.Bisco^s reconsideration. Fowle * a letter nad been expressly sent to Karachi to intercept the poiiti 1 Resident en route for Delhi where (. it was understood in Muscat) he intended to confer with the Foreign Secretory before Issuim; his fln.n orders. aneriy, the letter a) stated that m attitude was -unfortunate-, and ad^d that th ® VrUer ^ reed Fowle that none of the re, ductions I had, asked for should be granted.3. b). asked Fowl© to submit arguments v;hy they should not, as Col.Biscoe was anxious to the Council of State a reasoned reply to their request. The reot of the 'ett r asked for certain statist ical inforoiation, tfu essentials of which had been in th ? litioal A^ent^ possesalon for some weeks. Col.Biscoe's letter thus shoned tnat, with all the corre; pondence before him, he had, no intention of accepting my recommendations, '.y original expert pro- had pasala ( hich h l^the approval of the Political Agent and the Huscat Council of State) had already beentre- jected by Col.Biscoe on Feb. 13th vithout prior di^jcussion with me or any representative of the Muscat Government. His compromise of Feb.15th was inadequate to secure a balanced budget. Subse ^uently, I had 'r.pr red no efbrts in devising alternative jpoJ?.Is - including a suggested line by v/hich the Resident might retreat fro , his hasty decision without loss of dignity - but i_ aere rejected. For instance, I ^reposed that if Col.Biscoe could not agree to a further reduction in the Levies' pay, I would be content with a reduction in theii numbers. He would accept neither alternative; yet, after my resignation, the Govt, of India agreed to both!The Resident's refusal to accept my views was j.p_ arently not due to the overwhelming 'trcn^th of the o^posin^ ar^u- aents, in fact he v*aG so unsure of those that hr r.shs R)''. It supply him with reasons for refusing jthe Councils re quest. One is thus forced to the conclusion that the safe guarding of his a mour proor e. not Muscat's solvency, was Col.Biscoe* s primary concern - in impression I had already gained from Fowle's attitude during my negotiations with him. T.ic letter also :a&amp;es it abundantly cle.m that ne v/as determined mot to raprc-ent m w vie\-s ^o ahe G-evt. &gt;f India, as officially requested by me in accordance vith recognised procedure.

This made my resignation inevitable.

TI.g attitude betrayed in this letter to Major Fov.ie effectively disposes of the lux tj. .1 that the Resident ’ouid have referred the matter to Delhi if I had given bhiu more time, or that a reminder from me would have brought to his recollection my despatch which he had overlooked. That he did not mention the matter to the Foreign Secretary is p^ove^ by tne fact that Sir ^.Howell, in reply to my lettter stating that I had resigned, said that 1 had acted precipitate- j.y in not asking the local authorities to forward my views to Uae Govt, of India for a decision!

Howell of 12 Feb., flagged F, the diary of events furnished by Col. Biscoe, flagged G, and Sir E. Howell’s letter of 15 April below. we should be justified in saying that Mr. Hedgcock’s services were brought to an end primarily by his own action in tendering his resignation, and thereafter by a series of misunderstandings. The original misunderstandir^ was due to the fact that at the time of the G. of I.’s telegram of 26 May (see Col. Biscoe’s diary) the G. of I. did not know that the Muscat Council had accepted the withdrawal of the resignation. A further misunderstanding was that the Muscat Council were not informed of the G. of I.'s decision of 9 July (see the diary) that the resignation must be regarded as in abeyance; the Council acted in ignorance of this decision when, on 15 July, they terminated Mr. Hedgcock’s services. It will be seen that Sir E. Howell thinks that The G. of I. are quite prepared to do what they can/—«— can to obtain employment for Mr. Hedgcock, and Sir b. Howell has sent a testimonial strongly recommending him. Mr. Hedgcock called on the 2nd and again on the 6th May. He was not satisfied with the explanation of the termination of his services contained in Sir E. Howell s testimonial, and still asks for rehabilitation by means of grant of compensation or of questions in Parliament. I told him again that the first is quite out of the question, and as regards the second I suggested that this course would not do him any good. He told me that he has succeeded in obtaining a temporary appointment under the Iraq Petroleum Co., in connection with the purchase of land for the new pipe line. As, however, the appointment is temporary, he would be glad still to be kept on record for recommendation as a candidate for suitable vacancies. I said that we would keep on the lookout for such vacancies, and that the G. of I. would do the same, with a view to recommending him if an opening suitable to his qualifications comes to notice.

Biscoe f s demi-official letter No. 142-S., dated the 14th Karch 1932, at)out Hedgcock, copy of which was sent to you direct* Biscoe has clearly explained how little Hedgcock is justified in his contention that the Muscat State Council contrary to their wishes were forced 'by the Government of India to dismiss him. You will no doubt agree that Hedgcock*s appointment at Muscat was made with the approval of the Government of India and so the State Council were not competent without the previous approval of the former either to accept his resignation or to allow him to withdraw the resignation. The acceptance by Saiyid Said of the withdrawal could therefore only he regarded as having Been provisional pending the approval of the Government of India* And as this approval was not given it is obvious that the termination of his services sprang from his resignation which ?/as for some time held in abeyance and then allowed to become operative* If however we had known that the State Council had accepted^ the withdrawal of his resignation, we should prohahly not have issued our telegram of 26th Kay 1951. We should therefore in my oninion he justified in saying that Hedgcock*s services at Muscat were brought to an end primarily by his own action in tendering his resignation and thereafter hy a series of misunderstand ings, on the part of all concerned, as to the actual position in resoect of its withdrawal and the acceptance of that withdrawal® The position about Hedgcock’s talk of breach of contract is that under the terms of service that were offered him, his services were terminable at three months notice on either side. He tendered his resignation without giving the required notice and thus committed a breach himself. Having thus violated the terms he could not expect the State Council to observe the formality of giving three months notice for terminating his services® As regards your suggestion that Hedgcock should be helped to obtain another post, we are quite prepared to do what we can to obtain employment for him, whether in public or private service, but I doubt if much will come of it. ¥e have noted his name foremployment 'botti in ttie Indian states and toe -xiilx and we would recommend dis name wden an opening suitaole to dis qualifications comes to our notice^ I Pave already informed Hedgcock that tPe circumstances in wpicn Pe|leit ^uscat convey no reflection wdatever eitPer on Pis integrity or aM litv, and I now enclose a testimonial to Pis Qualifications wPicP I trust will be of Pelp to Pirn* To J. G. Dalton, Esquire, 0.3., M.C., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London^ An* I know Mr. Hedge©ck personally and tiave a digti opinion o± Pis good dualities. He was recruited by me for the Mesopotamia Political Service and served with me in ’Iraq, for alDout three years. I found him a loyal, hardworking and conscientious officer. He acquired a thorough knowledge of Arabic and his long stay in ’Iraq, where he served on long after I left has enaoled him to acquire remarkable insight into the Arab character. He has a considerable literary gift, and a sound knowledge of finance and administration. Early in 1931 he was apnointed ,as Financial Adviser, Muscat State and although he had a difficult task, he rendered useiul service. His services at Muscat were brought to an end primarily by his own action in tendering his resignation, which he did on account of a genuine difference of opinion with the local British authorities on certain administrative questions, ana thereafter by a series of misunderstandings, on the part of all concerned, as to the actual position in respect of its withdrawal and the acceptance of that withdrawal by the- Muscat State Council. I would however like to make it clear that the circumstances in which he left Muscat convey no reflection whatever either on his integrity or ability and I can strongly recommend him for employment in a similar capacity elsewhere.

They are a little belated, But I thought - perhaps mistakenly - that you would prefer them from a man in, rather than out of, employment. Z have obtained an appdlmtment in the Oil Company which I mentioned to you on a former occasion. The pay is lees than the first offer, and I have lost seniority, but this is the price I have to pay for ay erroneous notion that you might feel I had let you down, after all tthe trouble which you and the Viceroy took over my case. I have to thank you for a testimonial which Walton showed m© yesterday. While I am grateful for tne,^ generous personal tributes, may I say, as man to man, that the reasons given for the termination of my services *re not stated with the fairness which past association with you had led me to expect? You admit that I left Muscat through a series of misunderstanding#, but you place the responsibility for these on my act of re signation. Nothing is said as to the reasons wnidh brought about that resignation. If Blsooe had not so blithely told Walker, before he had discussed themaatter with me or any member of the Muscat Government , that he was not going to accent my proposals; if he had not sat on my request that the question of Muscat's finances ♦ — should be referred to the Govt, of India for decision;\r&gt; :S»' 3 ^.

The passage of time seems but to strengthen my case. I have heard from Muscat that they are continuing to build jip the finances of the country on the lines laid down by myself; this seems to speak for the soundness 0 f the proposal's whichvwere once bo arbitrarily turned down as impracticable. I hear also that the new Financial Adviser, who is six years my junior, is being paid a much hightrr salary than myself. The abrupt termination of my services as Financjeal Adviser has created a false impression as to the reasons of my leaving Muscat, and I think you will agree that I cannot continue under that stigma for the rest of my life. As I have told you. I aa anxious to settle this matter in an amicable way. and for misI»i — I Ireason have for the past five months waited patiently or the India Office's decision; but no one's patience is inexhaustible. There are several methods open to the Governnent of India for clearing my name: it is hardly unreasonable to expect that they will adopt one of them, seeing that, as events have proved, it was their own local representatives who were in error on all the points in dispute at Muscat.

Now this puts me in a difficult position for two reasons (i) that a charge oi this nature is essentially in definite, and differs entirely from the concrete and speci fic charges that were brought against walker and (ii) in the ordinary course when allegations are made against an officer the normal course is to forward them to him and call on him for an explanation. in the present case however 1 am prac tically precluded from doing this by the fact that it would inevitably make relations between Howie and alban difficult. I hay^e therefore had to make very guarded enquiries, and in respect of any observations that I make it must be borne in mind that 1 have not been able to call on Howie for detailed explanations. Now there is no doubt that Alban did show Hedgcocx papers that he had no business to show him. He admits it and I have taken him severely to task lor it. He showed him the levy file. He denies having shown him his demi- official letter to me (of which I understand he sent you a copy privately) in which he stated that Howie did not get on very vvell with oyed Jaid, cjid that his statements though plausible were misleading. He never stated that Howie was 4 - L o 8U ^ W mpetbnt. it is difficult to pierce the inner workings INDIA FOREIGN gEfr^ijAHV)^ #s j xiersonall/ h^ve seen no avirianno tocussed itoula dedgcock ana Laid him the general gist cl what he was writing. ,vhiie it is diii'icult tc excuse xilhan, Knowing him as I ao, i can perl'ectly well see how it all came about. Alhan is a cheery, sociable person, and the type oi' hail-lei low-well-me t lad who is lixed by the Arab, and by most of us, if it comes to that. He has certainly valuable qualities, hut the defects of his quali ties. He is Keen and full of enthusiasm and *go # , and a rirst-rate man at getting things done. On the other hand he is impetuous, and 1 thinx he finds solitude very hard to bear; the gregarious,type generally does. He took no recess and spent the whole summer at Huscat with not a single soul to speax oo except Hedgcocx, and nothing to take his mind off Muscat affairs. fowle felt that xii ban did not always temper zeal with discretion, and at times urged hilm to go slow; Alban felt that he was being curbed, brooded over his fancied grievances against fow&amp;e in the sole society of another man who also imagined he had grie vances against iowle, and with no one else to talk to, and with nothing else to think about he to some extent lost his sense of balance and proportion. finally, since last September he has had more or less chronic malaria, and has been seedy on and off the whole time he has been on tour with me, until at last I sent him to the a.P.O.G. hos pital at ^Dadan. I will now discuss Hedgock’s allegations against fowle, but in order to do so I must briefly discuss what occurred when I went to Muscat in February last. Just be- tore I got there I got a letter from fowle enclosing Hegg- cock # s draft budget, painting Muscat finances in very black colours, and saying that he must have reductions in the levy budget amounting to Hs.20,000/-, and that this reduction must inciude a cut of Bs.5/- in the pay. iowle Said Walker had agreed under pretest and thought it might affect the morale of the men. fowle pointed out that a cut of this&amp; -3- n&amp;ture was a serious matter and emphasised the risks, hut he said that in view of the financial position he considered the cuts should he agreed to, I arrived at kuscut a lew days later, and approached the matter 'with an open mind and had two prolonged discussions with Hedgcock on the subject. It must he home in mind that iiedgcock had been only one month in Muscat. We reviewed the general financial position of the State and the outcome was that we came to the conclu sion that at the very best, i.e. if the new tariff was intro duced, if additional revenue was secured from ochar, our etc. and if some economies were effected}, the State would have a credit balance of about half a lakh, while at the worst, i.e. if none of these were effected, the State would have a debit balance of about half a laKh. I felt therefore that the situation was not Quite so h&amp;ksx black as iiedgcock had painted it, that it was difficult then to look very far ahead, and I therefore, after also hearing walker, advised that instead 01 making ohe whole out of £s.20,000/- at cnee, economies totalling Bs.12,000/- should be effected immediate ly and , if necessary, the balance later on, if matters did not improve. I should like to point out that simultaneously with his statements t&gt;hat the State was bankrupt etc., Bedgcocm put in a demand for 50% increase in his own salary, i.e. an additional Bs.7,u00/- a year,so if i had acceded to both his demands the effect on the finances of the State would have been the same as it was when i refused the latter and reduced the former by Bs.8,000/-. I left Muscat thinking that the matter was settled, but after my departure further discussions tooK place between Hedgcock, T/alker and Bowie as regards financial details, walker wanting to make a reduction oi By.12,000/- on the pre~ vious year’s expenditure, while Hedgcock maintained that certain items ol special expenditure that had been incurred the previous year should not be included, but that the cutshould he nic.de on the normal recurring expenaiture. iinyi- hoift linaily agreement ^a£ arrived at, ana among other details it *as arranged that certain ponies that belonged to the royal family and were looxed after hy the levies, and their food etc. debited to the levy budget should no longer be maintained from levy funds but should be paid for from some other head. further it was agreed that the cut in pay should be given effect to from the 1st of the following month. as it was then nearly the end of the month Walker was Keen to announce the cut a few days be lore it tooK effect, ana so published it in his orders, ana also informed Syed Said*s syce that in Idture he would not receive pay nor the horses rations from the levies. This latter may have been done rather prematurely or tactlessly; anyhow Walker heard afterwards that Syed Said was rather annoyed, so lowle tooK him over to see oyed Said and Walker expressed regret etc. and they had a perfectly amicable dis cussion about the levy budget and some further economies were agreed to. i'o describe this petty incident as Hedg- cock does in paragraph 1 of Appendix A is ridiculous. Hedgcock further states that no mention of 'the above im portant events' are mentioned in lowle’s 83-C and stated that fowie suppressed all record of it. It is true that fowle does not specifically refer to Lhe incident in his despatch, but with the despatch he forwarded a letter from Hedgcock in which the incident is mentioned. fowle there fore did not suppress it and to cite the absence of a detailed report of this 'important event' as an attempt on iowle’s part deliberately to mislead and prejudice me against He£g- cock is obviously ridiculous. The next allegation is that lowle 'by concealing the fact that he himself had arafted the Gouncil # s letter in the first place and by his suggestion that the Council and Hedgcock were not keeping to their bargain again prejudiced him in my eyes'. as I have already explained above, afterI left discussions took place regarding the details of the reduction of expenditure, iowle made no secret of the fact that in his opinion it was premature to ask for a further cut, as is clear from paragraph 3 of lLedgcock # s statement, appendix A, hut finally said that if Syed oaid and Hedgcock wanted to press for it he would send on their request, hut gave no undertaking to support it, and in fact did not support it. He there lore drafted out a letter lor them to send me accepting the first cut and asxing ior a further cut, which, after some demur, they agreed to send. Hedg-. cock seems to have a grievance that in fowlers 83-0 there is no suggestion that the request for a second cut had Fewfee f s approval. Hut on Hedgcock f s own showing it had not lowle # s approval. If the Oouncil insist on putting forward a request, of which the Political Agent has said that he does not approve, it is of course incumbent on him to submit it, out he can hardly he accused or “mala fides' because he does not support it. 1’he third charge is that “by not fully recording Hedgcock*s arguments and his other reasons for not anticipating a heavy falling off in revenue collections lowle made it impossible for me to appreciate the serious ness of Muscat’s financial position'. To the best of my belief fowle forwarded every material letter submitted to him by Hedgcock. The latter has therefore only himself to Dlame ii his arguments were not adequately represented. It was quite impossible to form a definite opinion until revised budget estimates were submitted to me, so that 1 could view the situation as a w r hole, and these I never got; figures were sent on by Hedgcock piece-meal and I could not maxe head or taib of them. I thought it highly probable that additional revenues would be obtained from oohar and Sur and considered that this should be taken into account, vide my demi-official letter Ho.19-x, dated 3rd/4th April 1951, of which you have a copy. hy anticipations have- 6 - 'been justiiied; Sohar bas produced Hs. &lt;38,000/-, as against Bs.1,800/- the previous year, and the customs revenues of Sur have gone up over Bs.7,000/- during the months of July and August after Seyed Said and Alban had established effective control. Possibly Bowie might have pointed out to HedgcocA that I could arrive at no decision until he gave me revised estimates instead of sending in isolated figures, but hedgcock after all is not an easy person to argue with. Boiled down it really ail comes to this: Bowie thought that Bedgccck would be well advised to accept the cut I had sanctioned of Bs.12,000/- and sit down and await further developments for the next 5 or 6 months, trying in the meantime to collect additional revenue, at sur, Sohar, etc., and to effect other economies. 1 was also impressed with the necessity for maxing every possible effort to cut down expenses, and when 1 went to Delni in April recommended that the post oi Gommandant oi Levies should be left vacant till the autumn, thereby actually giving He&amp;gcock the extra Bs.8,000/- reduction in the levy budget that he was asking for. On Hedgcock f s own showing Bowie never concealed his views, and tried to dissuade him from pressing the matter just at once: he sent on to the best oi my belief every material letter that Bedgcock submitted to him, and I do not think there is the smallest ground for the allegation that he deliberately misled or prejudiced me against Hedgcock. He disagreed with Hedgcock and was perfectly entitled to say so, but to accuse him oi deli berately manipulating facts is an unfair ana unjustified charge. There is one matter wnich 1 should lixe to take this opportunity of explaining. Some stress has been laid on the fact that Hedgcock*s cuts were subsequently introduced without causing discontent. how if a wants-7- to take action, and B counsels cau'Dion and A subsequently takes that action without ill effects it does not mean that B*s caution %as necessarily unjustified. In this case Alban, %ho put through Bedgcock^s cuts, was aided by circumstances which may well prove to be temporary. There is at present acute unemployment everywhere in the Gulf, and hundreds of men are hard put to it to earn a livelihood. 1 have just been discussing the possibility of cuts in the pay of the Bahrain police with Prior and Belgrave. The rates are, hfijuax Indian sepoys Ps.B5/- plus rations, which formerly cost Bs.15/- but now owing to the fall in prices cost about Bs.10/-, plus uniform and pas sages to their homes every two years. Local armed men Bs.25/- plus rations and uniforms. Katurs (untrained local men who patrol the bazaar etc.) Rs.25/- without rations. I asked Belgrave whether Laturs could not be got lor less than Rs.25/-, and he said that at the present moment he could get as many men as he wanted at Rs.20/- but directly trade revived and employment became normal again he would not be able to get men at Rs.20/-. It is much the same situation at Luscat, and you can get^employ-' &lt;56 ment at any pay. Alban therefore introduced his cut at the most favourable moment, and one which 1 hope will prove abnormal. It does not follow that under normal circums tances it would necessarily h a ve been quite so successful. Owing to another bad pearling season the economic situation was worse at the end of 1931 than at the beginning, and Powle and Alban have been discussing the question of reduc ing the levy pay still further: it is certainly possible at the present moment. On the other hand, if economic conditions improve it may be necessary to raise the pay again, and it is not a good principle to shift the pay 0 of armed forces up and down in accordance with the tempo rary iluctuations of ihe labour marmet, so no decisionf P 7 ( ? 2 ) has yet heen arrived at next I go to Unseat. 1 Vi I l and 1 1 am going to discuss it when \ i 1*7 t y W. gh rnm^ Ihis letter has assumed rather long proportions, hut in conclusion I should lixe to state again that i’owle made no attempt to suppress anything, hut on the contrary 1 believe he sent on to me every material letter he received from Hedgcock with such comments as seemed to him appropriate I do not therefore think that there is the smallest ground for the allegation that he twisted or manipulated facts in a manner calculated to prejudice me against Hedgcock. iours^sincerely, 3d/- H.V.iiscoe. i'.

In the terms of service which were offered to him and accepted there was a provision to the effect that his contract was terminable at 3 months notice on either side. JJo contract was however actually signed. In fact Mr. Hedgcock appears to have considered the terms to be unfavourable from his point of view. Later on owing to a difference of opinion with the local British authorities on certain administrative questions* he tendered his resignation to the Muscat Council on the 10th April 19 31 with the intention that it should have effect from that date. The Political Resident, Bushire, with the approval of the (Government of India advised the State Council to accept his resigna tion. On 16th June the Government of India were informed by the Resident that the Council had agreed to dispense with Mr. Hedgcock 1 s services from 30th June 1931. Soon after this Mr. Hedgcock arrived in Simla and during the course of an interview with Fore ign Sec ratary on 19th June he drew attention to certain irregularities on the part of Captain Walker, late Commandant of Muscat Levy Corps. Under the instructions of His Excellency the Viceroy, Colonel Biscoe, the permanent Resident now on leave in England was asked to reconsider Mr. Hedgcock’s case; and as it was necessary to clear up the charges against Captain Walker for which'Mr. Hedgcock’s assistance was necessary, it was decided that his resignation should bebe held in abeyance pending Gol.Biscoe’s reply and pending the investigation of the charges against Captain Walker* Col.Biscoe f s views have been received and the enquiry into the charges against Captain Walker has been completed. In July last the Government of India were informed by the Resident that no official notice regarding the termination of his services had been served by the Council on Mr. Hedgcock before 30th June 1931, and the reason that the Council had put forward for this omission was that they expected him back by the 30th and as he did not turn up by that date they had no chance to inform him. The Resident has now reported (29-3-31) that the State Council handed Mr. Hedgcock . on 25th July their written intimation to the effect that his services with the Muscat State were terminated as from June 30th. It is understood that the Muscat State Council adhere to their view that Mr. Hedgcock* s services are no longer required by them. Wfe should be grateful for an expression of opinion on the following points:- (a) Whether any fresh period of notice of termina tion of his employment need be given to Mr. Hedgcock? (b) If so, from what date should it be reckoned? In our opinion he will have no legitimate cause of complaint if he is paid up to the 30th September 19 31 and allowed to depart at his convenience, before that da te • • • • •Merton House, !&gt; .......... 1 - f ?. 3.32.

P.2. 730/32, I write to say that I had a further interview with Hedgcock on 8th February. Hedgcock persists m maintaining that the termination of his service at Tuscat cannot be regarded as a case of deferred resignation because (he says) it is too well known to outsiders that he withdrew his resignation and that he was subsequently 'dismissed'. He has made the following alternative specific suggestions: - (1). That he should be paid compensation m order to establish that he was wrongly dismissed. As I said before I do not think that he himself really expects this suggestion to be adopted. I should explain, however, that when he talks about breach of contract his point appears to be that his services were terminated without notice (albeit with three months 1 salary in lieu of notice) and that this has harmed his reputation by making it appear that he was summarily dismissed and was also not in accordance with the terms of the agreement which provided for termination at three months’ notice on either side but said nothing about payment of salary in lieu of notice. I should not imagine, how/ever, that there is legal substance in this point though I have not referred it to our Legal Adviser. Incidentally I suppose if by any chance he did claim a breach/ Sir iL .B. Howell, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.oreach of contract the fact that no formal contract v/as actually executed would not tell against him as certain terms of agreement had been communicated to him and he had started work on those terms. But I have not referred this point either to the Legal Adviser. ( -)• Hedgeoc 1 '-’ s alternative suggestion is tha^ since (as he claims) he was wrongly dismissed Government is under a moral obligation to assist him in Detaining further employment. As regards this in the ^irst place we cannot admit of course that he va .■ in ongly dismissed* But a perusal of the papers does suggest that to some extent he was the victim Oj. an unfortunate comoination of circumstances, not all of hich were of his own making. In particular it seems probable that the Huscat Government at the time of their letter to him of 25th July (which ultimately had the effect of terminating his service i-h effect from the 30th June) were under a real misapprehension^ to the attitude and wishes of the Government of India; the latter in their letter to Ifajor Howie of 2nd July had intimated that Hedgcock's resignation must be regarded as in abeyance; but this inuina^ion had not been conveyed to the Huscat Government, and, moreover, Major Howie on 14th July sent an enquiry to the Political Agent asking how it was that the Muscat Government had not already informed Hedgcock of the termination of his services (presumably in accordance with the Government of India 1 s earlier instructions in ui.cii oelegram of 26th Lay to the Resident $n the proposal made in para. 13 of his despatch of 22nd April). It/It was evidently as a result of llajor Fowle f s enquiry of 14th July that the Muscat Government v/rote to Hedgeock on 25th July terminating his services. I presume that Sayid Said (being as it were on probation as ruler of Muscat) iflust naturally have been very sensitive^to any hints or suggestions received from the Political authorities and it may be that, as Hedge ock contends, Sayid Said would have been quite willing to retain his services if he had not thought (at that date, 25th July) that the Government of India wished them to be terminated; if he did think this he was under a misapprehension since the Government of India’s conclusion at that time was that the resignation should be regarded as in abeyance. When at a later date, following the Government of India’s telegram to the Resident of 17th August, the Muscat Government were asked for a decision whether they wished to retain Hedgcock’s services the Council of Ministers adhered to their previous decision. Hedgcock contends (possibly with some truth) that Sayid Said g r ve this answer because, having originally on his own initiative accepted the withdrawal of Hedgcock’s resignation and then on a strong suggestion (not to say pressure) from the Political authorities informed Hedgcock of the termination of his services, he was reluctant, for reasons of prestige or amour oroore to reverse his decision a second time, as though on his own motion and responsibilit and unless the Government of India expressed a wish that he should do so. The last sentence of the Council of Ministers’ letter to Alban of 26th August seems to bear tills out. While therefore we could not admit that Hedgcock was wrongly dismissed, it is worth considering whether/whether we might not say that his services were terminated by the Muscat Government owing to a misapprehension as to the attitude of the Government of India towards him. This version of the affair would make it easier to help Hedgeoc K in his efforts to obtain other employment. whenever opportunity offers, in trying to help Hedgeock to another post. So far, all that I have told him that we would do is to answer enquiries from prospective employers as favourably to him as we truthfully can. He employment because any firm connected with the Middle East , to which he might otherwise look for an opening, is prejudiced against him by the story of his having been summarily dismissed from Muscat. Cf course, as a matter of fact, it is very difficult for anybody to get fresh employment nowadays, but there may be something in what he says. Do you not think, therefore, that the Government of India and the India Office might do what they can for Hedgcock by suggesting nim as a possible candidate for any suitable opening in the public service that may cone to notice? The same could of course be done m regard to any opening in private employment which happened to have come to notice. In suggesting his name as a candidate for a public or private post we could give him a good chit and say, as suggested above, that his services at Muscat terminated owing to, or as a result of, a misunderstanding on thejart of the Muscat Government in regard to the attitude of the Government of India. If you agree, ou could let us have a statement (something in w qualities. I see th t in one of his letters Fowle says that he was hardworking, thorough and capable* I suggest too that we might take some initiative says that he is gravely handicapped in his search for of a testimonial) as to Hedgcock’s qualifications As/As regards Hedgcock’s financial acumen is it a fact (as he has mentioned to me) that the 5 Rupee cut in the pay of the levies at Muscat, over which the original trouble arose, was soon found to be actually necessary and was sanctioned in the first week of June? Yours sincerely, (SD.) J.U.ALTON.^ A ■r go f Minute Paper, . 730 Department. U.$. c J . C Mr. Hedgcock called again to-day. He persists in maintaining that the termination of his services cannot be regarded as a case of deferred resignation because (he says) it is too well known to outsiders that after he had withdrawn r&gt; C ^ H^'his resignation he was H disnissed'. /o . Ca. His specific suggestions are as follow:- (l) That he should be paid compensation in order to establish the fact that he was wrongly dismissed. A ji ^ Lm~ j t f ; - i'/ -U-J4 , “ KjT r, In this connection he suggests that payment of three months’ salary in lieu of notice was contrary to the terms of his agreement v/hich provided for termination at three months’ notice on either side but said nothing about payment of salary in lieu of notice. (Incidentally no formal contract between Mr. Hedgcock and the Muscat Govern ment was signed, but certain terms were communicated to him and he commenced work in accordance with those terms). Alternatively (2) that the G. of I. and the I.O. should take steps to help him to obtain another post. It will be remembered that this suggestion was made by Mr. Butler when he took up Mr. Hedgcock’s case. It goes further than the course which we have indicated to Mr. Hedgcock ^ jk\ that we would be willing to adopt, viz., to reply 0 * I i JIS * 7 ^ ‘ t0 any enquiries in a sense as favourable to him ^ 7 ^ t a s we are truthfully able to do. Mr. Hedgcock ^ ^ -a 4 BU ggests that we should take the initiative and V - recommend him for any suitable post of which we ^ / y - may hear, end in explaining the circumstances of A . ! the/the termination/his services at Muscat, acknowledge that he was wrongly or mistakenly dismissed. The latter part of Mr. Hedgcock’s suggestion is,I think, clearly impracticable. It is worth considering, however, whether we might not say that his services were terminated by the Muscat Government owing to a misapprehension as to the attitude of the Government of India towards him. This appears to be what actually happened; after the withdrawal of the resignation had,been accepted by the Muscat Government, and after the G. of I. had informed Major Fowle in a letter of 2 July that the resignation must be re garded as in abeyance, Major Fowle sent an enquiry to the Political Agent on 14 July asking how it was that the Muscat Government had not already informed Mr. Hedgcock of the termination of his services. It was clearly as a result of this action that the Muscat Government wrote to Mr. Hedgcock on 25 July terminating his services; and it certainly seems strange that Major Fowle should have taken this action after receiving the G. of I’s letter of 2 July Sayid Said (being^as it were / on probation as ruler of Muscat jv/as naturally very sensitive to any hints or suggestions received from the Political authorities, and it may be that, as Mr. Hedgcock contends, Sayid Said would have been quite willing to retain his services if he had not thought uhao ohe G. of I. were against it; if he did think this ; he was under a misapprehension;and this misapprehension resulted from (though it does not follow that it was deliberately caused by) Major Fowle’s omission to take action on the G. of I's letter of 2 July and his subsequent action of 14 July.

Perhaps, however, we might consult the G. of I. and if they agree we might be prepared to take more active steps to help Mr. Hedgcock to obtain further employment,recommending him for any suitable vacancy which may come to our notice and explaining that the termination of his services at Muscat was due to misapprehension on the part of the Muscat Government regarding the attitude of the G. of I. 0/^^- ^ ^VWV, , 1 U~&gt;. ft* faiUjj) 7 - ^ ft, Zi+M ^ ^ * V ** , • At /s\ cKU ^ A ' rfiJjCicA , / h p. ?, dl 214h 3000 8/31m* Thank you for your letter of 29th January.

He made it clear that, matters having gone as far as they had, his dignity demanded that the suggestion of my reinstatement should come from the Government of India; adding that should he receive such a suggestion, he would most willingly have me back as his financial Adviser. Saiyid Said went on to say that, as he did not wish to put himself officially in the wrong with the Government of India, he was obliged to hand me the Councils resolution terminating my services with effect from 30th June 1931, in accordance with the Political nLesident T s 'advice^.

Hedgcock has had no judicial experience, but he held several important posts during 12i years service in ’Iran, from 1918 to 1930, including the Revenue Secretaryship in the Ministry of Finance, and the Directorate of the State Domains Department under the Ministry of Irrigation and Agriculture. Government of India, under whom he worked in ’Iraq, has, I believe, a very high opinion of his abilities. He is 38 years of age, and his address is 6, Shinfield Road, Reading.

Dear Smith, You may remember me from my obscure days in the India Office. I have now got charge of the horrible job of the means test in connection with the 'dole'. This unpopular job is administered by the Poor Lav/ Authorities up and down the country. Some of them are showing signs of disliking the job so nuch that they are threatening to resign, go on strike , and what not. Ye are trying to cajole them to keep going, but they may decline in some places. If so, we have power to appoint Commissioners to clo the work in their place. It is not easy to get together at short notice a list of sensible people who could do a job of this kind, which requires a certain amount of corrmonsense and courage and self- reliance so that the man who does it can decline to pay very much attention to what we say or what the public say, but goes on administering the lav; as he understands it. The type of man who would be admirably suited would be a youngish retired I.C.S. man, preferably one who has had experience on the judicial side (not of course one of the 'great pro-consuls'). The job will probably be pretty well whole-time for the first three months, and then probably at least three days a week, and it would mean at the be inning residing in one of the dreadful industrial towns where the breakdown would take place. I don’t quite know how much we should pay for the job, but probably at the rate of about £700 to £1,000 a year. Walton suggested that you might have handy a list of people of that type with their addresses or at least their London Club. If so, could you let me have ten or a dozen names?

They tend to confirm the view that Mr.Hedgcock was tactless in his dealings with the fj.of I f s. officers, but that to some extent he was the victim of circumstances, e.g. the crolonged period of uncertainty and confusion as to his oosition after his resignation and its withdrawal during which the Muscat State gave him notice of termination, whereas tie (!.of I. regarded the question of his resignation as being in suspense, and the fact that during this period Ool.Biscoe was on leave. Mr.Hedgcock investigated and seems to have established various irregularities in Captain Walker’s Levies accounts.

You will notice that m one of the enclosures ; fletter B ^tu^gfa^h 2 ) Hedgcock put the w'Drcl '‘wife (He.*, Mrs. Stephens) in inverted commas. 4 was going to write you a separate and perso- ‘nal demhOmeial to explain what this indicated, ' ; hut fedgcock has now written another letter, 'U chpy of which 1 attach, dotting the i s and 'nros&amp;ing the ‘'t’s” in no unmistakable manner. 3. I had of course heard the story that Cap tain and Mrs. Stephens were not married dur ing the time, or for some of the time, they were at° Muscat, though the union was legalised later. (They left Muscat of course long before 1 appeared on the scene). That was the gossip, but personally if Mr. and Mrs. X. are living together as man and wife I assume it is so un- tif proof is brought to the contrary, and I think most sensible people do the same. In my demi-official report therefore I have quoted the Stephens’ precedent on the assumption that t le couple were married. 3. Hedgcock’s point is of course obvious: if the couple were not married then Stephens case of taking passages as a precedent tor Walker doing the same is weakened. J don t suppose vou will care to institute an inquiry m o the private lives of the Stephens to finu out whether as a matter of fact, not of gossip, they were, or were not, married at the time ens took the passages, but short of doing this one must assume that they were. 4 With regard to Stephens taking passages at all, which depends^according to Hedgcock— on Walker’s own statement (letter B paragraph 2) I have asked Hedgcock to try and trace this fact, or have it traced by his Accountant, in the Muscat Treasury files. 5. Hedgcock is leaving here to-morrow by the slow mail for Muscat. As he bought some files with him I was able to go into the question of Walker’s alleged irregularities nere, and have put off my tour to Muscat owing to some urgent work. Demi-Official i.ettf.r fhom Me. S. F.. Hedo- cock, TO Major T. C. W. Fowl®, dated 18th July 1931. 'Reference your request that I should try and ascertain from the old accounts whether or not Captain Stephens paid for a leave passage for Mrs Stephens from State funds. 2. According to Walker, Mrs Stephens was not. at the time she made use of the alleged free passage, the wife of Captain Stephens. it is doubtful whether her case can be taken as a precedent for Mrs. Walker. 3. It seems to me that unless there is a pre cedent of many years’ unquestioned standing, nn officer of the Indian Army serving a .'ireig State is bound, in the absence of clear provi sions to the contrary, to take as his pie. e the customary usage of the Mian Army. Walker was the first married officer .0 take command of the Muscat Infantry. He should therefore, in the matter of leave passages for his wife, either have followed the practice of the Indian Army or else have obtained a defi nite ruling on the subject from higher autho rity. He elected to take Mrs. Stephens’ pas sage (? was it a “leave” or a “joining” passage) as a precedent for his wife's. 4. In 1930 Walker took the following leave passages:— (a) Mrs. Walker and one servant. (bj Himself and one orderly. On his departure in 1931 he claimed that he was entitled to one and three-fifth passages It is surely without precedent that a man travelling on leave is entitled to more generous passages than one travelling on duty? 5. In view of the above, do you still wish me gument against considering Stephens' case as a trace Mrs. Stephens’ alleged passage? Demi-Official letter from the Political Resident, Busiiiiie, No. 447-S., dated 20th July 1931. In continuation of my demi-official letter No. 429-S., dated 17th July, I enclose herewith a copy of Hedgcock s letter ('!) in which he refers to a letter of mine (R)- copy of which is also enclosed. As you will see, Hedgcock’s letter puts forward grounds of ar gument against considering Stephens’ ca.vi as a precedent for Walker taking the extra passages. T, Demi-Official letter from Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, to the Resident, Bushire, dated 18th July 1931. Your Demi-official No. 435-S. of 18th July 1931, 1. Your para. 3.—I gather that you wish to emphasise the fact that Capt. Stephens took a passage for his wife (at present we do not know whether this was a leave passage or a passage for Mrs. Stephens to join her husband in Muscat) in order to show that Walker’s ac tion in taking leave passages for his wife 'was based on a precedent, and therefore perhaps justified. In my letter of yesterday’s date—the one you have since informed me you are sending to Simla under separate cover—I gave you my reasons for considering why Walker could not claim Captain Stephens’ action as a precedent, If the somewhat questionable action of a single Commandant ranks as a precedent wh'ch justi fies Walker’s taking leave passages for his wife then it would seem that I also would be justified in showing my butler as a member of the crew of the “Al, Said”, since my predecessor has established that precedent I 2. Your para. 6.—As Financial Adviser to a bankrupt State I found myself a very busy man and, in spite of your views to the contrary, have so far only been able to find time to go through the Levy accounts for 1930; I have not yet exa mined: the aecounts for the other two yearn of Walker's command.14 .1 said that I reserved to myself the right to arrange m\ work (not th.£&gt; case) as and bow it best suited Muscat’s financial interests subject of course to any directions I may re ceive from the Council of State. Until Alban's arrival, no representative of the Government of India took any interest in Walker’s alleged irregularities. On Alban’s ask ing for further information 1 at once began to col lect it, but in the five days at my disposal did not have time to collect more than a few clues before I left for Simla. At Simla I was requested to go into W a.ker s alleged irregularities more closely. It was sug gested to me that I should first come to you for general direction and then proceed to Mus cat, where the accounts were, -md go ir.to de tails with Alban. As the Government of India has requested me to take up this matter, I am naturally pre pared to give it priority—hence your fears that this ease will never come to an end are giound- less. In the light of the above explanation, I think you will agree that your decision that the evi dence agamst Walker is to be considered as closed prevents me from fulfilling the Govern ment of India’s request. R. Demi-Official letter from the Political Eesi- DENT, BuSHIRE, TO Mr, S. B. HePOCOCK, No. 435-S., dated 18th July 1931. Keference our conversation of Ifith instant. 2. Walker’s alleged irregularities can be divid ed into four parts: — (1) Unauthorised Passages; (2) Fines placed in Sports Fund; (3) Employment as private servants of in dividuals paid by the State; (4) Unauthorised dog rations. 3. I have received enough information from you to enable me to give an opin on on (l)j (2) and (4). 4. With regard to (1), however, it seems neces sary to confirm the fact that Captain Stephens took a passage for his wife, since you point out in your letter “D”, paragraph 2, that this de pends on Walker s statement alone. Also the copies oi the entries in the Muscat Treasury Ac counts with regard to passages might be pro duced as a matter of form. If you are going to Muscat you could enquire into the first, and produce the second. Otherwise your Account ant General could take the necessary action. Result of your—or your Accountant General s— action should be communicated to me. 5. I also informed you that I vras transferring part (3) for enquiry on the spot to Alban at Muscat. He had already, on information sup plied by you (vide paragraph 3 of his D. 0. letter No. 134-C., of 9th dune, referred to me by y°u—letter D. , paragraph 4) taken up the quest on of these irregularities. Since, however, the issue ©f the servants is really a simple one. though as it depends on local evidence I have had to transfer it to Muscat, I do not think that this, previous investigation will in anyway prejudice his present enquiry, and 1 have asked, him to. consider this issue entirely de novo. With tbs/ information which you have supplied—1 am sending him copies of our correspondence—and what he can get at Muscat, he should have quite sufficient evidence on which to give a decision. 6. You also stated that other irregularities of Walker’s might come to light, which you might like to put up in the future. 1 pointed out that 1 could not accept th : s piece-meal method of putting up your case. You had ample time between the date Walker left Muscat on 25th April, (to say nothing of the time you had be fore that) up to the date when yourself left on 12th June, to prepare your case. To this you enunciated what appears to me the extraordi nary proposition that you reserved yourself the right to put up your case when and how it suited you. I pointed out that if this attitude were generally adopted enquiries would never come to an end, and that as far as this parti cular enquiry was concerned—subject to any orders received from Government—my decision was that the evidence against Walk r was closed. Demi-official letter from Major T. C. W. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 445 S., dated the 20th July 1931. I don’t want to go on worrying you about Hedgcock, but in your demi-official letter of 23rd June to Colonel Biscoe you say : “ According to Hedgcock’s account he gets on very well with Alban : so the difficulty will not become acute until your leave is over and Fowle has to return to Muscat. ” 2. I have received a letter from Alban dated the 8th July from which the following are extracts : “ Up to the moment of leaving here to ex press his regret to the Government of India for these past misdeeds and to request that they be overlooked, he (Hedgcock) lost no opportunity of filling my ears with reports of the resentment felt by Saiyid Said and other members of the Royal family at the interfering policy of the Government of India and their suspicion that the sole object of the aforesaid Government was to force the State into bankruptcy and then by means of another loan to bring it more completely under its thumb. ***** “ In addition to this, the firm friendship and good-will, as expressed by the Sultan, the Council and every Arab in the State towards the British Government and the Government of India, renders in tolerable the presence of one who seems15 &gt; bent on creating a gulf between the State and the Government of India and who seeks in every chance remark over heard a confirmation of his view that the State has been subject to injustice and oppression at the hands of the afore said Government of India. ” 3. I need hardly state that this is an “ entirely unsolicited testimonial I moan that A ban wrote entirely off his own bat, and not 'n answ to any query of mine as to how he got on with the Hedgcock, or anything of that sort T fewer people involved in a “ dogfight the better, and the last thing I want to do £ to dra,g a young officer like Alban into the Hedgcock controversy. In fact I wrote to him that if Hedgcock returned to Muscat he was to cultivate friendly, if careful, relations with him. However, as Alban has expressed the above opinion an as it was for precisely the same attitud • • hraUlity to the Government of Ind.a-wh.ch Alban now reports, that the Con«c.l was pre- viouslv asked to dispense with Hedgcock s Lrvicel I thought it as well to pass it on to you. I am sending a copy of this letter to Colonel 'Riscoe. Demi-official letter from Mr. S. C. Hedgcock, Muscat, dated the 25th July 1931. I’ve just had a frank and friendly talk with Saivid Said. He feels that his dignity has been somewhat affronted over the question of his Financial Adviser. When m Karachi last May Fowle asked him to telegragh to me and ask for mv final decision concerning my resignation. I replied withdrawing it and he informed everyone accordingly. Then came Colonej Biscoe’s letter advising him to terminate my services. His first comment on receipt of this was why, if the Government of India had determined to dismiss me. he was made to under go the farce of telegraphing to me asking whether I had reconsidered my resignation or not. Now he feels that he is in danger of again being made to feel a fool. I have just returned to Muscat, but without anything in writing to show that the Govt, of India is re-considering its decision. Bushire states boldly that I have nut been re-in-tated, but is silent as to any possibility of my re-instatement. Sayid Said is at a loss to understand who or what to believe. He has told me that he intends to assume the strictly official attitude. The Govt, of India requested him to dismiss me : he has done so this morning ''July 25th) handed me the Council’s intimation that my services were terminated as from June 30th. Though he has told me privately what action he intends to take if requested to re-instate me, officially he intends to make no move in that direction until the Govt, of India approaches him on the subject. His hinted that he might evren go through the form of asking for a new Financial Adviser ? His dignity demands that the first mo\ e should come from the Govt, of India. Twice he^ has expressed in writing his pleasure in retaining my services ; he is not going even to hint officially that he desires to see me re-instated for fear his wishes are not met. Would it be possibe for tlhe Govt, of India to send him something definite soon ? An official intimation that my re-instatement was under consideration would do something to ease the awkward position Alban, Saiyid Said and myself find ourselves in. G1PD-L 427(c) F&amp;PD—2-12 31-10.ip • Private letter from Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, Muscat, dated the 18th April 1931. ^ I regret to have to tell you that I tendered 'Nj/ resignation last week; the letters giving reasons will doubtless reach you in due course through the official channels. I have no other post to go to, so you will appreciate that I have not taken the step lightly. II I had not been enveloped in a fog of official secrecy, knowing little or nothing of what was going on, I might have acted differently. To me, as Financial Adviser, the main issue at stake is Muscat’s solvency; the chief concern of the Gulf authorities seems to be the minimum which can be contributed towards retrenchment by the Muscat Infantry. Every device has been used to protect the Levy budget, including cooked figures and the employment of the Consular treasury staff on the preparation of formidable but inaccurate “man-day” tables! Muscat’s daily increasing indebtedness is ignored in the interest attaching to the military versus civilian contest. I resigned in order to bring things out into the open, and to see exactly where I stood. Before receipt of the letter giving my reasons, Colonel Biscoe accepted, or advised the Council to accept, my resignation : I am not sure which, as his telegram has not been shown to me. The Council, after a private interview with the P.A., made it clear that they associated themselves with the present financial policy, and have asked me to reconsider my resignation. This is one point cleared up. The Council are not being driven by me to accept an unwelcome policy, and the issue is one between them and the P. It.—not a personal one between Colonel Biscoe and myself, as I sometimes think it is considered. here. His remark to me, that I ought to be very pleased with myself for having knocked Its. 12,000 (owing to mistakes in the budget he handed me, the figure boiled down to Its. 4,365) off the budget of his “favourite child”, seemed to me toi put the whole ques tion on the wrong plane. As you know from my first letter, I was most anxious to avoid coming into conflict with a man so much my senior, and I told you that I proposed to lie low until my official position was more clearly defined. This has proved impossible. Inacti vity might have saved my own skin, but it did not prevent the State’s debts from steadily accumulating. The next point that requires clearing up, is whether the Gulf authorities attach more im portance to Muscat’s solvency or to tbe Muscat Infantry. I have discussed three or four different financial programmes with the Council, which has eventual]v adopted that of a graduated all round pay reduction, the best-paid departments contributing the larger percentage; this to be coupled with a moderate increase in taxation, ' exclusive if possible of enhanced taxes on the fcod of the poor. This seems to me a sensible, moderate, and equitable programme, and one financially sound. The Council have accord ingly authorized me to make an all-round cut in pay (Customs 10 per cent., Provincial Ad ministration per cent., etc.) provided that they can obtain the sanction of the Government of India to a 16 per cent, reduction on the average Levy expenditure for the last two years, this to include a 12t- per cent, cut in the very high pay of the rank and file. The above scheme would at once enable Muscat to begin paying its way. If a 12| per cent, cut is impossible, the Council suggested (on March 12th) an alterna tive: a reduction of 22| per cent, on the average expenditure of the last two years, free of any stipulation as to pay reduction. I have told Fowle that if this entails a reduction ■ in the numbers of the force, I wall undertake to press the Council to recruit up to the sanctioned strength in the autumn, if the financial situa tion is by then sufficiently improved. There is yet a third course which the authori ties might adopt: to explain why either of the above alternatives cannot be accepted. I can not very w T ell tell the Council that the P. R. does not agree to the cut of 12J per cent, because he “has a soft comer in his heart for the , sepoy”, which was the reason given me on Feb ruary 17th and not modified or amplified since. Previous to that, in the latter part January, the Commandant had raised but not strongly pressed the possibility of the reduction in pay causing discontent; neither the Council nor Bowie upheld this objection. There is always an element of risk in cutting the pay of armed men, but in this case it seemed justified by the State’s bankruptcy. After fourteen weeks’ negotiations, the Council has obtained a reduction of 101 per cent., including only a 5 per cent, cut in the pay. This is not enough to enable the State to meet current expenditure from current income, as it does not justify salary reductions in the other much lower-paid departments. As far as I know them, I have not departed from the essentials of the Government of India’s policy with regard to Muscat; I also have the confidence of the Council. Yet I find myself in the worst tangle of my official carec.. I saw how things were shaping last February, which was why I asked if I might come and discuss Muscat affairs with you. May I still hope to do so when I go on recess some time in June, bv which time Saiyid Said will have returned from Karachi? I need hardly add that I very much regret any trouble I may cause you: but it seems to me that I should be poorly repaving the confidence you placed in me, if I put my own interests before those of the government which pays me.

I shall be very pleased to come and see you at noon on Saturday next. Demi-official letter from S. E. Hedgcock, Esq., dated the 11th October 1931. Reference the interview you kindly gave me yesterday morning. My future action depends on what answers can lie given to the following two questions :— (1) Does the Government of India consider the charges I can bring against Major Fowle sufficiently grave to warrant an official enquiry ? Three typical charges are given in Appendix A. For the sake of brevity these are confined to one despatch—Fowle’s 83 c. of 25th March 1931. &lt;2) Does the Government of India genuinely wish to make such an enquiry ? If 1, a man without employment, am told that such an enquiry will entail my having to remain in India for some weeks (and perhaps to visit Bus hire) at my own expense, I am afraid I could only regard this as tantamount to a desire to avoid an enquiry. As I was paid by the Government of India while sub stantiating my charges- against Walker, a precedent seems to have been estab lished for my being paid while substan tiating my charges against Fowle. APPENDIX A. Charges against Major T. C. Fowle, Politi cal Agent, Muscat. 1. On February 15th the Political Resident advised Saiy d Said, in spite of his protests to the contrary, to acc pt a Levy budget showing a reduction of Rs. 12,000 on the previous year’s expenditure, and two days later a budget pur porting to show this reduction was submitted to the Council for their consul ‘ration. I think the Council would almo- t Ci rtainly have accepted the budget advised by the Political Resident had not Captain Walker, while the Council w :re still considering the matter, prematurely announced this budget in his Command orders ; in addition he dismissed Saiyid Said’s personal syce and stopped the issue of fodder to the horses of the Ruling Family—the latter purely arbitrary acts as the syce and horse rations do not appear in the Levy budget. Saiyid Said, enrag ed at this blow at his dignity and at the flouting of the ^Council’s authority, came to my office and said that he had not accepted and would not accept the budget advised by the Political Resident. This was the beginning of the pro tracted Levy budget negotiations which even tually led to my resignation. The next day Major Fowle and Captain Walker visited Saiyid Said, and to heal the breach made reductions in the budget sanctioned by the Political Resident. But though Saiyid Said officially accepted the explanations of these two officers, this did not deter him from continuing to press for further reductions. In Major Fowle’s despatch No. 83-C. of 25th March 1931, no mention is made of the above important events. On the contrary, Saiyid SMd and myself are accused of executing a volle- face and of breaking our bargain. Not a word is said of the provocation which led Saiyid Said to break his bargain—if bargain it was. 2. As mentioned above, the Political Resi dent’s budget submitted to the Council purport ed to show a saving of Rs. 12,000 on the previous year’s expenditure. Actually, owing to two serious errors (one at least, in my opinion, a deliberate falsification) the savings were only Rs. 4,365. It took me nearly six weeks of almost daily haggling to induce Capt. Walker, backed by Major Fowle, to effect the savings of Rs. 12,000 promised by the Political Resident. Major Fowle’s No. 83-C. of 25th March 1931, glosses over the fact that Capt. Walker was responsible for errors in the budget sanctioned by the Political Resident to the extent of Rs. 8,500. By suggestion, he implies that my attitude is chiefly responsible for the friction over the Levy budget. Major Fowle paints a picture of himself as the pourer of oil on troubled financial waters; he hides the fact that he him self (by his insistence on a three-year average instead of a two-year average as recommended by me) was responsible for the ridiculous and inaccurate “ man-day tables ” which protracted and exacerbated the Levy discussions. 3. The small Rs. 2 cut sanctioned by the Political Resident was bound to result in a deficit, and I spent nearly a fortnight discussing with Major Fowle how best the question could ENCLOSURE !N f INDIA FOREIGN SE^p- ovg ? [ Letter [182 j liaced 17 DEC 1931 Rec 4 JAM2 be re-opened with the Political Resident. Our respective arguments, briefly summarized, were &amp;• under:— (а) Major Fowle stated that he considered that the reductions in the Levy budget were sufficiently large and varied to justify substantial cuts in the other lower paid department 0 . 1 replied that that might be his view, but it was not the Council’s. (My in structions from Saiyid Said were that I could carry out my retrenchment proposals in the other departments as soon as the Government of India had sanctioned the 12J per cent, cut in the Lavies). (б) Major Fowle said that my revenue estimates were based on too many hypotheses to be relied upon, that prices could not possibly continue to fall,and recommended a “wait and see ” policy. I replied that my revenue estimates were based on expert knowledge backed by statistics, that prices most certainly would continue to fall (as, in fact, they did), and that a “ wait and see ” policy would land Muscat in complete bank ruptcy. (c) Major Fowle urged me to put off re opening the question until the autumn, by which time Colonel Biscoe’s promised second cut would be due. I replied that if the Second cut was accepted in principle, there could be no harm in ante-dating it by a few months. (d) Major Fowle countered by saying that no new factor had come to light since Col. Biscoe’s visit of February 15th to justify the re-opening of the question. I pointed out that since the Political Resident s visit I had managed to arrange for weekly reve nue returns to be submitted to me, and that these showed a most alarm ing drop in collections as compared with the previous year. In the end it was decided between Major Fowle and myself that the Council should sub mit a letter— (*) accepting, on the advice of the Politi cal Resident, the budget put up by Capt. Walker; (it) asking for the Political Resident’s promised second cut at an earlier date than the autumn. Major Fowle himself drafted the letter the Council was to submit; I can produce his origi nal Mss. On my assurance that the proposed line of action had the Political Agent’s approval the Council sent in a letter almost word for word in accordance with Major Fowle’s draft. In Major Fowle’s No. 83-C. of 25th March 1931 there is not the faintest suggest on that the Council’s request for a second cut had his approval, let alone any hint that he himself had had any part in the drafting of the Council’s letter. On the contrary, he refers to it as having been “ obtained from the Council with diffi culty ”. He even goes so far as to advise tjyr Political Resident not to agree to the ea sanction of the second cut, on the ground tl a second nut following so close upon the mst would cause discontent in the Levy. The excuse was a poor one, as in point of actual fact tbe second cut was made less than three months later, and there was no outbreak of discontent nor did a single man take his discharge from the Levy. 4. From the above three examples (further minor examples could be quoted) it will be seen that— . . . / ,,, - -aj (i) By omitting all reference to Capt. Walker’s premature announcement of the Political Resident’s Levy budget, dismissal of Saiyid Said’s syce and stoppage of rations to the horses of the Ruling Family, and to Capt. Walker’s “ cooked ” budget, Major Fowle used his official position to shield a brother officer. [For a third attempt to shield Capt. Walker in the matter of the latter’s financial irregularities, please see my letter to Mr. Wylie, dated 18th September 1931 (File No. 228-N./31).] The effect of suppressing all record of these events was to show Capt. Walker in a more favourable light than he deserved, and myself in a less favour able light, thereby prejudicing me in the eyes of Col. Riscoe. (it) Col. Biscoe imagined that he had settled the Levy budget on his visit to Muscat on February 15th. The Council’s letter asking for a second cut at once thus came as somewhat of a shock to him. Major Fowle, by concealing the fact that he himself had drafted the Council’s letter in the first place and by his suggestion that the Council and myself were not keeping to our bargain, again, I venture to think, prejudiced me in Col. Biscoe’s eyes. (Hi) By not fully recording my argu ments against his “ wait and see ” policy and my other reasons for anti cipating a heavy falling off in revenue collections Major Fowle made it impossible for Col. Biscoe to appreci ate the seriousness of Muscat’s finan cial position. 5. Another small point. I begged Major Fowle to show me a copy of his despatch or to let me know what recommendation he proposed to make to the Political Resident concerning the second cub. He refused on the excuse that I was an official serving a foreign Government. Yet, as the despatch in question shows, he informed Capt. Walker of his proposals. I can only conclude that Major Fowle dare not show me a copy of his despatch as he knew it to be a travesty of the real facts. Major Fowle’s evident anxiety to see my services terminated is possibly due to his desire to be rid of an awkward witness. 6. In short, I claim that Major Fowle’s No. 83-C. of 25th March 1931, was the direct cause of the tendering of my resignation, and of my eventual dismissal.3 7. Three weeks ago Cant. Alban wrote to Col. Biscoe stating that Major Kowle should not return to Muscat because he was— (i) distinctly persona non grata with San id Said ; (ii) incomp; tr&gt;nt, knowing nothing about his district; (in) dangerous, since his despatches, though plausible, were full of errors of fact. I ven ura to submit that a comparison of the statements made above with Major Fowle’s ISo. 83 C. of 25th March 1931 will confirm Capt Alban’s point (Hi). If further confirma tion is required may I suggest a comparison of Major Fowle’s recent despatch to the Govern ment of India concern ng the Muscat Levy Corps with Capt. Alban’s comments contained in his Ko. C.-202 of 15th September 1931 ? (.Not received.) S. E. Hedgcock, —11-10-31. Demi-official letter from E. B. Howell, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Fobeign Secretary to the Government of India, to S. E. Hedgcock, Esq., No. F.-516-N./31, dated the 12th October 1931 (Confidential). 1 write in answer to your letter of yesterday (page 1 and above). If you remember, at the in terview which we had on Saturday, I told you that if you wished to make charges against Fowle I had no wish to dissuade you, but must ask you to do so in writing. Your letter does not state definitely whether you wish to make any such charges, but merely forwards an appen dix in which three charges are drawn up. As to the two questions which your letter contains I do not propose to give you any more specific answer than that whatever charges are formulat ed against their officers must always be investi gated by the Governm nt of India, until they have satisfied themselves either that the charges are groundless or that the officer’s conduct is at fault. In the latter event naturally such disci plinary action as sterns to meet the case is taken. 2. In this instance the charges which you have brought forward wull be investigated, but it is not possible for the enquiry to begin at once, since our records do not include a copy of Fowle’s letter 83-C-, dated the 25th of March last and this will have to be obtained from the Political Resident. 3. I do not think that it is necessary for you to remain in Simla for the purposes of this enquiry, and as you have your own affairs to attend to I presume that you will not do so. I therefore take this opportunity of saying good bye and once more wishing you all good fortune in the future. I should like at the same time to add that in my opinion the circumstances in which you leave Muscat convey no reflection whatever either on your integrity or ability and you are at liberty to quote me as a reference when seeking further employment. should like to thank you for your letter of yes terday, in particular your paragraph 3, and for your permission to quote you as a reference when seeking further employment. 2. I should like you to realize that I most Warmly appreciate the time and trouble that you—as Foreign Secretary—have given to the case of a junior official. It was really more than I had a right to expect. My chief regret is that I leave you under the impression that I am prone to take hasty and impetuous action. I could not very well discuss the question of the oil job with you, as I had to send a reply by return of air mail; over the qu stion of my resig. ation I spent several days of careful consi deration, and I still think (and I was the man on the spo:) that in t.ie peculiar circumstances as I found them in Muscat no other action was open to me if I was to retain my self-respect. I prefer your simile of dynamite. I became convinced that, if Muscat was to obtain early solvency, some kind of explosive was necessary. You may perhaps have forgotten that the Sultan of Muscat first applied for permission to raise his customs tariff 26 years ago, and still the requisite permis sion is lacking. (The request was repeated in writing in 1910 and again by the present Sultan in 1923.) 3. I note that the charges I have brought against Major Fowle are to be investigated, and that you are sending to Bushire for a copy of his No. 83-C. of 25th March 1931. May I suggest that at the same time you ask for a copy of Col. Biscoe’s deni-official reply sent from Kai achi about the first week in April last ? In it occurs the sentence “ Hedgcock’s attitude is unfortunate These words serve to prove that Fowle’s above-quoted despatch did prejudice me in the eyes of Cob Biscoe. I should be grateful if I could be informed in due course whether the charges against Major Fowle have been proved to be true ; my address is 6, Shinfield Road, Read ing. 4. In conclusion, I hope you will understand that any subsequent action I may take in London concerning my case will be in no way directed at you personally. As I have already said, I have received every consideration at your hands. Unfortunately, I have received none at all from the representatives of the Government of India in the Persian Gulf. ADDENDA TO APPENDIX A. Charges against Major T. C. Fowle, Politi cal Agent, Muscat — conta. As the Political Resident is being asked to furnish you witn a copy of Major Fowle’s No. 83-C. of 25th March 1931, it is perhaps desirable that I complete the objections I have to make against the misleading statements made in this despatch. Demi-official letter from S. E. Hedgcock, Esq., dated the 13th October 1931. This i3 to say good-bye to you ; I leave by this afternoon’s train. But before going I 2. Un arrival in Muscat I found my prede cessor in the Ruba-ul-Khali and the accounts in a state of confusion. It was therefore essential that I should prepare as rapidly as possible an appreciation of the financial situation. Within a fortnight I submitted to Major Fowle a budget for 1931, showing a deficit of Rs. 78,0U0.This was, of couree, a provisional budget; in ray No. S.-12/1 of January 12th (para. 5a) I des cribed it as‘‘the draft budget for 1931, as sub mitted to me on arrival, and roughly revis.d by myself”. Five weeks later, the collection of my statistical data having been completed, I was able to submit a final budget showing an anti cipated deficit of Rs. 90,000. In his No. 83-C. of 25th March 1931, Major Fowle describes my provisional budget as “hasty” and suggests, if I remember rightly, that it might have been better not to put up any budget than to submit one th=it I should alter later. I think i deserve commendation rather than censure for the fact that my provi sional and final budgets differed by the small sum of Rs. 12,000 only. Major Fowle also described my budget as “cautious”, i.e., pessimistic. In order that I could not be accused of making out the financial position to be blacker than it actually was, I was cartful to submit a shgbtly optimistic estimate of revenue collections. Up to the time I h ft Mm cat, reve nue collections were falling as, and at the rate, predicated by me in February last. I think it probable that, by the end of the year, the reve nue collections will be somewhat below racher than above my estimates. 3. In order that Col. Biscoe might have the latest possible information concerning revenue collections, I managed to prepare by March 25th a statement showing revenue collections up to March 21st. This attempt to be helpful is pilloried in a P. P. S. to Major Fowle’s 83-C. of 25th March 1931, the implication being that it is another of my last minute and piece-meal efforts. 4. The Council asked the Government of India’s sanction to a second cut in the pay of the Levies, or, alternatively, a reduction in the numbers of the force (see my S.-12/3 of March 12th, para. 6). In his despatch under reference Major Fowle, though he advises the Political Resident against the second cut, makes no mention of the suggested reduction in numbers. 5. In order to understand how such a mislead ing despatch came to be written, it is necessary to know something of the circumstances which preceded its writing— (ol In his No. 98-C. of 24th November 1930, Major Fowle, though he tnew the State of Muscat to be on the verge of bankruptcy, recommended to the Political Resident without previous discussion with the Muscat Council, a Levy budget Rs. 20,0u0 in excess of the pievious year’s expenoiture. He concludes this despatch by saying that “the present state of the Corps reflects great credit on Capt. Walker’', though had there been an attack on Muscat the Levy would have been at a loss what to do, nor could any men have bem found who knew how to fire the machine guns with which the Levy was provided—so low was the standard of military training. (6; On my representations that the Lovhs were overpaid, and that a fairly substantial cut in their pay was an essential preliminary to Muscat's solvency. Major Fowle agreed to a Rs. 5 cut. (c) On the P. R.’s visit of February 15th, Major Fowle, without a word of ex planation or apology then cr since, recanted, and left me single-handed to press for the es ential Rs. 5 cut. (d) After the P. R.’s departure, I spent 5 weeks trying to convince Major Fowle of the seri us ness of the financial situation, amt of the necessity of bring ing up the cut in the pay of the Levies to Rs. 5. Major Fowle now found himself in a quandary. He had not the courage to recant a second time, and recommend the Rs. 5 cut. Such a step might incur his senior officer’s displeasure, and it- would involve him in arguments wnich would reveal with what inadequa te CO: sideration his despatch mentioned in (a) above had been written. Also, lie was reluctant to bring to light Capt. Walker’s errors, since that officer stood high in the Political Resident’s regard. Nor did Major Fowle, who was very touchy about his dignity (see his despatches wish to admit that in the Levy and budget questions the “ hireling of a foreign Government ” was in the right, and he himsdf in the wrong. In short, the only scapegoat left was myself. A perusal of Major Fowle’s No. 83-C.of 25th March 1931 will shov, I venture to suggest, that its general tone is petty, spiteful, and unworthy of a man holding his position. It is the despatch of a small-minded official anxious (as I observed during my time at Muscat) to serve his personal interests before those of his own Government or of the Government of Muscat. 6. The most important memorandum I wrote while in Muscat was my No. S.-24/2 of February 24th. In this I pointed out that— (а) the anticipated deficit in the 1931 budget amounted to Rs. 90,009, (б) this deficit could only be met a rigid retrenchment scheme, (c) the small Rs. 2 cut, sanctioned by the Political Resident made only an emasculated retrenchment scheme possible, and that this would almost certainly result in a deficit, {d) owing to possible trouble with the tribe* of the interior, too much relianc^ should not be placed on obtaining much additional revenue from the pro. posed enhancement of the tariff, and (e) in conclusion, I asked that the question of the financial programme for 1931 should be referred to the Government of India. £* In his brief covering letter forwarding thL memorandum to Bushire, the only point Majo Fowle considered of sufficient importance to draw the P. R.’s attention to was one concerning an Indian carpenter. This was the reason, perhaps, why my No. S.-24/2 was never forwarded to Simla. 7. Major Fowle’s despatch to the P. R. written when on recess in Karachi, in whi h he recom mends that my services with the State of Muscat should be terminated, is almost as full of inac- curacie and misleading statmc nts aa his No. 83-C.5 ©f 25th March 1931, but I refrain from giving details as I do not wish to over*burden the officer making the investigation. 8. If I had acquiesced in Major Fowle’s unsound financial views and his disregard of the interests of the State of Muscat, there would have been a large deficit; nevertheless I should have been considered fit to remain as the State’s Financial Adviser. Because I tendered my resignation as a protest against Major Fowle’s methods of ad ministration, which I am afraid I can only describe as dishonest, there is a surplus instead of a deficit, but I have lost my post. S. E. Hedgoock, —13-10-31. P. S .—Copy of Major Fowle’s Mss., draft letter for the Council is attached.. Copy of Major Fowle’s Mss. draft letter for the Council. Reference your letter No. As you are aware, when the Hon’ble the P. R. visited Muscat on we as well as Financial Adviser discussed exhaustively with him the subject of the Levy budget and he advised a cut which would bring in about Rs. 10,000 or Rs. 12,000 p. a. At the same time it was agreed that should the financial situation of the State require it, the question of a second cut might have to be taken up later in the year, say in the autumn. 2. Acting on the advice of the P. R. we agree to the Levy budget now proposed by Captain Walker, but in view of the serious financial situation as shown by Mr. Hedgcock’s report attached herewith we may be compelled to put up the question of the further cut sooner than, the date originally suggected. eiPD-S-415FPD--18-ll-3l~imDemi-official letter from Lt.-Col. H. V. Biscoe, London, dated 5th July 1931. I Many thanks for the good wishes for my health expressed in your letter of the 23rd June. The specialist was not very encouraging about my heart, and seemed to think that there was very little likelihoad of my ever being able to play a game again, except quiet golf, but on the other hand he said that if I avoided violent exercise there was no reason why I should not carry on all right for the normal span. As you will see J am now at Osborne, and shall probably stay here till the end of August: not an exciting Way of spending one’s leave, but if it does the trick I shall not complain. Now as regards Hedgcock. First let us get the allegations against Walker disposed of. I know nothing at all about them. Fowle never mentioned the matter to me, and your letter was the first intimation I had about it. I can not therefore express any opinion, more over I have not the terms of his contract here and do not know what he was entitled to. The allegation regarding the employment of levy orderlies in a domestic capacity does not seem to me very henious: it is a question of degree. A certain amount of this sort of thing goes on in very much more exalted places than the house of a Commandant of Levies, and is generally viewed with a lenient eye. However doubtless Fowle has dealt with the matter. You say that Hi s Excellency would be glad, if I consider it any way possible,^ to get the matter smoothed over and permit Hedgcock to return. Now I hope I shall be forgiven if 1 express my views frankly. I have tried to view the matter as dispassionately as possible, and the atmosphere of a convalescent home is a good place for doing so. If I felt that Hedgcock was the right man for the job, and that his return would be in the best interests of the State and facilitate our dealings with the State authorities I would certainly be quite prepared to let by-gones be by-gones, and would recommend that Hedgcock should be given a serious warning that he must adopt a more conciliatory and tactful attitude in the future and should be given another trial. But I do not think that he is the right man for the job. I have never come across any individual who displayed such extraordinary obstinacy on one point. We can none of us get everything we want in this world, and when Hedgcock had been met more than half way, and given assurances of further support should it be necessary, instead of accepting it at any rate with resignation if not with grati tude he started to sulk: made, as far as I am aware, no attempts to seek other economies, e.q., reduction of family allowances, or to increase the revenues, e.g., by visiting Sohar, Gwadur, etc., and ended up by tendering his resignation, entirely as a ‘bluff’, and without the smallest intention that it should be taken seriously. Not content with this he wrote a most deplorably unwise letter to the Sta e Council, which was calculated to render rela tions with them difficult in the future, made ridiculous allegations against the P. A. and stupid remarks about myself. Could obstinacy, folly and tactlessness go further? And is u man with such an abnormal temperament the right man for a job where some measure of tact and give and take are essential? After all when the dilference of opinion about the levy budget arose Hedgcock had been in Muscat one month: the financial position was uncer tain, 'and really all he was asked to do was to go slow. You state (i) that it is doubtful if we shall get a better man for the money and (ii) that he is capable of handling Syed Said well and guiding him upon the path that he should go. As regards (i) I would point to Belgrave at Bahrein: he started on much lower pay than Hedgcock is getting: is conscientious, capable, and hardworking and gets on admirably with everyone, Arab or European. It is therefore possible to get first-class men to take on these jobs without offering exorbitant salaries, and I would mention that judged by the Colonial Service standard’s Rs. 1,200 is good pay. There must be others available of the same calibre. Further T do not regard Hedgcock as a normal individual: manv of these Arab ‘enthusiasts’ if I may use the expression seem to me to be very abnormal, and T believe that almost any normal individual of reasonable diligence and zeal would be more satisfactory. If matters are smoothed over now, I think there is every likelihood that somethingr 0 f the same sort will recur in the comparatively near future. As regards (ii) does Hedgcock’s record up-to- date justify the belief that he is likely to have the best influence on Syed Said? He has already told him that he disapproves funda mentally of the policy of the Government of India, and probably put ideas into his head that were not there before. No one 'would like to see the Muscat State standing on its own legs, like Kuwait does, more than I should. Unfortunately it is not possible for the present, and in any case we shall always have important political interests in the State. It seems to me therefore essential to have as Adviser there an officer to influence the prospective Ruler who will do his utmost to strengthen friendly relations between the State authorities and the British authorities instead of doing exactly the reverse. It is not as though Hedgcock were of a pliant temperament, who would modify his methods and views, and take up a different line in the future: on the contrary he is in my opinion most unyielding and persistent in his views. There are many minor points which I could mention, which I could advance, which strengthen the opinion which I have formed that, it would be better that H should go, but I do not want to confuse the issue, and I would prefer therefore merely to say that in my considered opinion and viewing the matter as dispassionately as I can I do not think he is temperamentally fitted for the post, and 1 consider that it would be in the best interests both of the State and of our political interests in the Muscat State that he should go.If this view is accepted, the question then arises of a successor. Objections are 1 believe felt to my recommendation regarding Alban, on the ground that he is an officer of the Political Department: I am naturally a little out of touch with the state of the Muscat finances now, and do not know what Alban found the situation to be when he arrived. If however it is really serious, then I think it calls for serious remedies, and other considerations should give way to the imperious necessity of getting the man who is most likely to remedy the situation in the shortest time. Alban would start with the great advantage of previous experience and knowledge of the State; he is full of zeal and enthusiasm, and his appointment need not be of very long duration, say 2 years. As he could, and has already, combined the two posts of Financial Adviser and Commandant of Levies his appointment would effect a consider able economy. If he could during, that period put matters on a satisfactory footing it might be possible to abolish the post of Financial Adviser altogether. Fowle told *me that the Sultan’s latest idea was to return to Muscat permanently, and in any case Syed said would be about 23. Failing this I would suggest that I should be authorised to consult the Colonial Office, and see if they can suggest any one: I doubt if Iraq is nowadays a very good recruiting: ground. GIPD—L 427(c) F&amp; 1 J - i 2-31—10*Demi-official letter from Major T. C. W. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 521-S., dated the 21st August 1931. In continuation of my demi-official letter No. 429-S. of 17th JuLV 1931 I attach herewith copies of the following telegraphic correspondence ■which has taken place between Alban and myself :— (1) Telegram No. 174 of 1st August 1931, from the Political Agent, Muscat; (2) Telegram No. 447 of 2nd August 1931, from myself to the Political Agent, Muscat. 2. My demi-official letter to Hedgcock men* tioned in my telegram No. 447 to the Poli tical Agent, Muscat, was attached to my letter quoted above, but I give the relevant extract here for ready reference. “ 4. With regard to (1), however, it seems necessary to confirm the fact that 'Captain Stephens took a passage for his wife, since you point out in your letter “ D ”, paragraph 2, that this depends on Walker’s statement alone. Also the copies of the entries in the Muscat Treasury Accounts with regard to pass ages might be produced as a matter of form. If you are going to Muscat you could enquire into the first, and produce the second. Otherwise your Accountant General could take the necessary action. Result of your-^or your Accountant General’s—action should be communi cated to me.” 3. Hedgcock’s reply to this demi-official letter, •jwhich he sent from Muscat is as follows Part III,—Leave Passages. “In Appendix C will be found certified true extracts from the Levy Accounts giving details of the two leave passages taken by Mrs. Walker. Such leave passages are not included in Captain Walker’s contract—a copy of which is given in Appendix D. To my objection that a leave passage for his wife was irregular, Captain Walker replied that his predecessor had charged to the State not only sea passages from Muscat to Karachi for his wife and three children, but also their train fares from Karachi to Kotdwara. A search through the accounts confirm* Captain Walker’s statement, but shows that the passages referred to above were taken in May 1928, i.e., the month in which Captain Stephens rejoined his unit. A passage of this nature can hardly be quoted as a precedent for Mrs. Walker’s two leave passages. Mrs. Stephens took a State-paid passage from Muscat to Karachi in 1927, but as Captain Walker did not quote this as a precedent, he was presumably ignorant of the fact,. In any case Captain Stephens may have had special authority for this passage. .On his own admission, Captain Walker has no such authority. On the whole it would appear that no reliable precedent exists for Captain Walker’s action in taking leave passages for his wife and servant.” 4. Appendix C, referred to by Hedgoock, con tains certified true extracts from Levy Accounts and is formal evidence that leave passages were actually taken for Mrs. Walker. 5. With regard to the precedent formed by Captain Stephens, please see paragraphs 11 and 13 of my letter quoted above. According to Hedgcock’s statement, such passages were taken by that officer once when rejoining his unit and once when going on recess. Hedg cock states that as Walker did not quote this latter incident as a precedent, he was presumably ignorant of the fact. As, however, whatever case Walker did quote he quoted verbally and not by the book, it is not clear to which case he refers, and there was certainly a precedent for his action. My opinion therefore on this charge is the same as already expressed in paragraph 13 of my letter quoted above. 6. There were 4 original charges against Captain Walker paragraph 8 of my letter quoted above— (1) Unauthorised Passages ; (2) Fines put into Sports Fund ; (3) Employment as private servants of indi viduals paid by the State ; and (4) Unauthorised dog rations. 7. All the material on these four charges is now with you. (1), (2) and (4) are dealt with in my letter quoted above and in paragraph 5 of this letter, while Alban’s demi-official letter No. C.-175 of 7th August 1931 with enclosures, finishes (3). 8. With reference to the further charges referred to in Alban’s telegram No. 174 of 1st August 1931 and in enclosures to Alban’s demi-offiicial letter No. C.-175 of 7th August 1931 to Wylie (Hedgcook's report, paragraph 10). I am still of opinion, as stated in paragraph 6 of my letter D. 0. No. 435-S. of 18th July 1931 to Hedgcock attached to my D. 0, letter No. 447-S., dated the 20th July 1931 that he had plenty of time to prepare all his evidence against Walker before he left Muscat, and this piece-meal way of conducting his case is most unsatisfactory. However, as he has put forward this evidence backed by Alban I am forwarding it to you under a separate letter. In any case these further charg es do not necessitate Hedgcock’s continuance at Muscat, as, if it is decided that investigation into them is necessary, the material is there and Alban .can carry out the necessary work. 9. I am sending a copy of this letter to Colonel Biscoe and to Alban. Telegram R., from the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 174, dated the 1st August 1931. Hedgcock produce^ conclusive evidence throwing fresh light on Walker’s financial irregularities, shows no precedent for leave passages.He requests telegraphic approval of Government to make comprehensive investigation. I am satisfied that evidence conclusive. Recommend full investigation. Telegram R., from the Political Resident, Bushire, to the Political Agent, Muscat, No. 447, dated the 2nd August 1931. Your telegram 174. First thing to do is to complete the enquiry into charges already formulated. You should complete your enquiry into ser vants’ question and forward your report vide paragraphs 4 and 7 of my D. 0. letter No. 430-S. of 17th July. Hedgcock should submit to me evidence on no precedent for Walker’s passage, vide paragraph 4 _ of my D. 0. letter to him, No. 435-S. of 18th July. He should then formulate his further charges in writing, indicate what evidence he has to pro duce and submit his report to me through you. GIPD—L 427(c) F&amp;PD—2.12-31—10.J'DfctfMDWIClA’L LETTER FROM Ma-TOR T. C. W. Fowle, Political Resident, Be shire, No. 427-S., oated 15th July 1931. Reference Wylie’s ^ demi-official letter No. R.-10-N./31, dated the 29th June 1931, enclos ing copy of your letter of 23rd June to Colonel Bisooe. 2. Hedgcock arrivad on the 8th July, and I have been going into the question of W alker s ■alleged irregularities with him. Hedgcock brought a file or two with him and has given ■me enough material on which to give an opinion on this matter. Owing, however, to pressure of work, I shall not have it ready until next mail. In the meantime I have certain remarks to make on Hedgcock’s statement to you that 'tie had reported to me the fact of these irre gularities, and his general attitude on the matter. Fm afraid this will be rather a long letter, but vou will find a summary of my 'opinion as far as Hedgcock is concerned m the last paragraph. 3. The method I have adopted for the investi- •gntion is to have a series of conversations with Hed^cock, confirmed afterwards by him by replies to letters from me It Is rather ft laborious method, but I think most satisfactory to both sides. Copies of the letters are attach ed and marked A, B, etc., for ready reference The letters contain matters connected with Hedgcock himself as well as Walker, and I wi submit fresh copies when sending in my report , on the latter. 4 The first genera] point I wish to emnhnSise ■i, that '9 Ions aa there is a Financial in the Muscat State it is he and not the Poli tical Agent who is responsible tor Muscat Finances. To suppose otherwise is to place the Political Agent in the itnnossibte posit on of responsibility without, author,tv. IF the Financial Ailviser is not to he responsible then whv have such an expensive Ininiry’ Th only circumstances linger which the o . Agent, can be held responsible for retorting, o 'inveetienting Muscat finances, whether nr- rZlaVities or otherwise, are when they have been properly reported to him by the Fmancia ’Adviser. * Tf follows from this that the Political Agent is neither the Financial Adviser’s nmc Agent is neitr er detective though HedgcoeV^apJears tHlU he is something of With? He (Hedeeock) “knows nothing shout the cook lone of Walker’s alleged “j, beyond the 'n^contamed ^ ^ 3 of AlW s„ . ■ N . / doeBn . t he taow s ^he checkinf of financial irregula»bes * hi8 n b h' fdidw“kere^mta m ;. W ^ “sV on wh^e mslkerl lit Muscat _(a -f letter 'F”, paragraph 2V I know than the Ma n in the Mo on • A toH. replied with a counter-query: under what autho. rity did lie (Hedgcock) the sanctioning autho rity, give it to Ihm? (Walker). (Letter “G’\ paragraph 2). “Alban informed me Walker paid the dhobi Rs. 5, etc.” (enclosure to letter “D’’). Why hasn't Hedgcock made his own investigations into this? He apparently only does half his work as far -as investigating ir regularities is concerned, and appears to expect the Political Agent to do the other half for him. 6. Another point I wish to emphasise is that such criticisms as I am now making with regard to Hedgcock have nothing to do with the cor rectness or otherwise of what he wanted to do with regard to Levy economies, etc The criticisms merely cover the attitude which he has taken up with regard to Walker’s alleged irregularities, and with regard to me. “Hedgcoek says that' he brought this matter (Walker’s irregularities) to Fowle s notice, but is not aware whether Fowle reported it to you or not. Bo not suppose that I regard tiiese allegations as already proved, but if they were made to Fowle he ought certainly to have reported them to you and the matter seems to need clearing up” (your letter of 23rd June to Colonel Biscoe),. Opinions may differ, but personally if “A’* takes the responsibility to come to ■ me and say that he has brought the matter of “B’s” irregularities to the notice of “C” I conclude that he has done it very emphaticallv, and that—if “C' has not listened to him—he has followed it up with a written report—official, or the least demi-official Nothing of this nature occurred m the prewmt instance, as you will see from paragraphs 8 J and 10 and in my opinion therefore Hedgcock s informing vou that he had brought the matter to mv notice is a mis-statement pure and simple. 8. This is not of course the first occasion on which Hedgcock has made a mis-statement about me. In his letter of 18th April 1931 to ^vou which you forwarded for my information, he stated that my accounts at Muscat had been ‘cooked’ in order to assist Walker, and that the Consulate Staff there were used to thwart his efforts. On receipt of this letter 1 wrote to vou pointing out the facts which were as follows. After Colonel Biscoe’s visit to Muscat in February and his decision that a certain sum should be cut from the Levy budget a violent eon- troversv took place between Hedgcock and Wal ker as to how this cut ought to he effected, each side producing sheets of figures. I was not responsible for the correctness of tbeir figures, but I gave my good offices in order to get them to come to some agreed total. My clerical staff too were at their disposal to assist them in adding up figures, etc., and in Hedgcock’s case especially far from mv staff being used to thwart his efforts, they gave him definite assist ance in the w T ay of typing, as he was short- handed at the time. This being so, in my letter to you I summed up Hedgcock’s remarks as both “silly mnd offensive”. In your reply of 21st May you said you were not altogetherSurprised that I found some of the temarcks in Hedgcock’s letter rather difficult to. digest, but that you did not think I need take them too seriously, and as Hedgcock was leaving Muscat, I was quite willing to leave it at that. In your letter you said that in another communi cation Hedgcock stated that “he had always maintained friendly personal relations with you and was under considerable obligation to you for helping him in a variety of ways”. In which case he has showed a very queer way of paying off his obligation. 9. To return to his latest mis-statement. He admits that he never informed me in writ ing, merely verbally- (Letter “H”, paragraph 4) During my time at Muscat he sent me a regular stream of official and demi-official letters (he is inclined to be prolix), on Levy subjects, yet never once mentioned, or even hinted at, anything about these irregularities. 10. With regard to his verbal communica tions. The allegations against W’alker may be divided into two main parts— (a) and (b) (vide letter “A”, paragraph 2). I informed Hedgcock in my letter “C ’ that I have no recollection of his mentioning the case of Walker’s passage to me (a). I do remember vaguely his men tioning something about Walker’s dhoby cr punkhawala, being partly paid by the State (bh In fairness to Hedgcock I am quite prepared to admit that he may have mentioned the question of the passages to me in a casual manner. At the time a controversy was run ning high between Hedgcock and Walker (para- grap 8 above). Both Hedgcock and Walker would come to me to fulminate against each other, and—as is often the case when this sort of thing happens—would go outside the points we were trying to settle. When this occurred I paid very little attention to what they said and merely tried to induce them to leave my office in order to let me get on with my work. It is quite possible that on one of these occasions Hedgcock mentioned the subject of Walker’s passatres to me, but I have no recollection of it. As for his statement (letter B , para graph 4) that he suggested a court of enquire, I am prepared to denv it flatlv. With regard to fh )—according to his own statement fLetter “P”. paragraph 5\—it was not until Walker and T had both left Muscat that his HTedgcock’s) pnpnicions were turned into certainties, so he could not have made much of a point ot it when mentioning the case of the dhoby, punkha wala. or whoever he was. 11. In letter “B”, paragraph 4, Hedgcock states that—unlike Alban later—I did not ask for proofs nor request him to give me a report in writing. I have already (paragraph 10 above) dealt with the way in which Hedgcock “brought to my notice’’ the matters in question. When Walker had left, Hedgcock’s suspicions became certainties, and presumably he then brought the matter strongly to Alban s notice. 12. The really important question, however, is why Hedgcock—who according to his own statement considered the matter serious enougli to suggest a court of enquiry—did not address me a report or a demi-official report on the subject of the irregularities, both what he knew and what he suspected, when W 7 alker—the indi vidual whom he accuses of the irregularities— and I were both on the spot in Muscat. He* had a second chance even after I had left Muscat, on 18th April, as I was still Political Agent in Karachi on recess until the 24th May when I left for Bu&amp;hire. He states- that it was after Walker left (on the 25th April) (letter “B’’ r pearagraph 5) that his suspi cions as to one-part of the irregularities (para graph 10 above) were confirmed, yet he still wrote me no report, while Alban to whom he confided his suspicions did not reach Muscat until about the 7th June. 18. His reasons for this obvious omission are given in paragraph 4 of letter “B.’\ Briefly they are that he did not wish to complicate the question of obtaining reductions in the Levy' budget by bringing in a personal issue. This on the face of it is so inadequate that it needs no comment. He goes on te say “when I eventually reported the above three facts to you, my chief aim was t® shake your confidence- in Walker and thus indirectly influence the despatch you were writing to the Political Resi dent on the Levy budget. For this purpose I considered a verbal report sufficient”. This seems to me an extraordinary statement. His object in making in what he is pleased to call a “verbal report” was not to move me to enquire into these irregularities, or to recover for the State what Walker might have taken from it. but to ''shake my confidence in Walker”. This sort of thing may be very Machiavellian and clever but frankly to me it savours more of the tortuous methods of an Arab Shaikh than those of a British official. 14. As it is not the first time that Hedgcock has made a statement about me —vide para graph 6 above, so it is not the first time that he has shirked putting down on paper facts with regard to individuals whom he has accused verbally. When Hedgcock’s predecessor— Thomas—loft Muscat, the question of what? disciplinary action should be taken against him arose (I need not g© into the case in full, as yon are well aware of it). Under a clause in Thomas’ contract Hedgcock suggested arbitra tion by the Political Resident, and put up various minor more or less technical objections connected with Thomas’ overstaying his leave in England, etc. The main count against Thomas was, however, that in making the iourney into the Rubal-al-Khali, he had deliberately gone beyond the leave granted him by the Council, though he knew that he could not be back in Muscat for another three months, and that his successor to 'whom he was to hand over was expected in a few weeks, and when the State itself was in the throes of a serious financial crisis. T pressed Hedgcock very hard to add this count to h i ‘s official letter to me asking for arbitration. He absolutely refused to do saying that he thought this would be “vindictive”. Finally, in ovder to bring this point, as far as T could,' to the notice of the arbitrator—Colonel Biscoe—I sent it in in a demi-official form explaining why I had to do so 15. I think this shows—if it is really neces sary to do so—that I am quite willing to report matters which I have knowledge of, and equally that Hedgcock is fond of shirking his respoar sikility in this respect.3 16. There is no doubt that Hetfgcock’s views as to enquiries into irregularities are unorthodox. In one of our conversations—Letter “G”, para graph 3—he mentioned that there were minor irregularities of Walker which he was doubtful Whether it would be worth while pressing now. and asked me if they could be brought up “later”? To this amazing suggestion I replied that all the irregularities must be brought up now. 17. Summary.—It may. be convenient to summarise my letter as follows. There are two general points I have emphasised. First that my present criticisms of Hedgcock have nothing to do with his financial policy with regard to the Muscat State and to Muscat Levies (paragraph 6 above). The second ’S that the Financial Adviser is the individual responsible for the finances of the Muscat State and not the Political Agent. To suppose otherwise is to put the Political Agent in the impossible position of responsibility wdthouc authority. The only responsibility that can be laid on the Political Agent is that of report ing on, or investigating, Muscat finances when they have been properly reported to him by the Financial Adviser (paragraph 4). In the present instance, Hedgcock in omitting to do this (para graphs 9 and 10) was in my opinion—guilty of a grave dereliction of duty. He aggravated his offence by stating to you that he had brougho this matter to my notice (paragraph 7) which he had not done. He had already previously made another mis-statement about me, which was the subject of correspondence between you and I (paragraph 8). His record in Muscat show's —vide the case of Thomas—that on a previous occasion also he deliberately shirked the responsibility of reducing his accusations to writing, notwithstanding pressure from me to do so ^paragraph 14). His reasons for noz reporting W’alker’s irregularities in writing are quite inadequate and indicate the tortuous mentality of an Arab Shaikh rather than those of a British official (paragraph 13). He has peculiar ideas on how enquiries should be conducted —vide his amazing suggestion that some of Walker’s irregularities should be brought up later (paragraph 16). I do not wish to close this letter altogether on a note of criticism and so am quite willing to affirm—w'hat T have already done in previous letters to you—that Hedgcock has hi s good points. He is certainly hard-working, thorough —except where the investigation of irregulari ties are concerned, and capable. I am sending copies of this letter and of its enclosures to Colonel, Biscoe and Captain ’Alban. I A. Demi-official letter from Political Resident, Bushire, to Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, No. 408-S., DATED THE 9TH JULY 1931. Reference our conversation of yesterday after noon. Before actually going into the question |of the alleged irregularities of Walker, (which we can do at our next meeting), there were one or two other matters which by w r ay of clearing the ground we discussed as follows. 2. The alleged irregularities without going into details at this stage can be divided into two parts: — (a) that Walker paid for Mrs. Walker’s passage to Karachi and that of a servant out of State money, beyond the terms of his contract; (*&gt;) that a certain number of his domestic servants were paid out of State funds. 3. With regard to (a) and (6), you said that ' you did not write to me on either subject but mentioned them to me verbally at different times. 4. The obvious question arises, which I put .to you, is why you did not w'rite me—as then Political Agent, Muscat—an official, or derm official report, on the subject of these irregulari ties at the time when Walker and I were both on the spot in Muscat. 5. Your reasons are as follows. With regard to both (a) and (b). Relations being already strained between Walker and yourself over the proposed reductions in the Levies you did not wish to bring a personal note into your argu ments with him, and so further complicate the issue. With regard to (b), up to the time w'hen Walker left Muscat, you had only suspicions a« ,to what was going on. When Walker left Muscat, facts then came out through the Acting Commandant—the Subedar Major—which turned your suspicions into certainties. Please confirm above as a correct summary of our conversation. B. Demi-official letter from Mr. S. E. Hedgcocx to Political Resident, Bushire, dated thr 9th July 1931. Your d. o. No. 408-S. of 9th July 1931. 2. Prior to March 15th I had, in your and Walker’s presence, strongly hinted that the State of Muscat was paying for unnecessary followers (e.j;., the dhobi) and that there was a discre pancy in the ration return. 3. After March loth I went through the Levy accounts for 1930, and three facts came to my notice: — (a) that Walker’s boatman had been paid from State funds; (b) that Mrs. Walker and one servant had received a State-paid passage to Karachi and return beyond the terms of Walker’s contract; (c) that there was a discrepancy in the ration return.4 4. I brought the above facts to your notice verbally, and suggested a court of enquiry. You did not (as Alban did later) ask for my proofs nor request me to report to you in writing. I. for my part, did not press the matter further as from the beginning I had been reluctant to com plicate the question of obtaining substantial re ductions in the Levy budget by bringing in a personal issue. When I eventually reported the above three facts to you, my chief aim was to shake your confidence in Walker and thusi in directly influence the despatch you were writing to the Political Resident on the Levy Budget. For this purpose I considered a verbal report sufficient. 5. In May (after you and Walker had left Muscat) the Subedar-Major, on his own authority- discharged certain followers who had become sur plus to requirements owfing to the absence of a British Commandant. It was this action which first brought to light the unexpectedly large num ber of followers used by Walker for his personal needs. Alban’s enquiries revealed that Walker’s cook was a Naik on the strength of the Muscat Infantry. 6. The above turned my strong suspicions into certainties as far as the followers (except the boatman) were concerned. p.S.-—I asked Walker for his explanation about the free passage to his wife and servant, and subsequently informed you of the reply he gave me. C. Demi-official letter from Political Resident, Bushire, to Mr. S, E. Hedgcock, No. 41L8., dated the 10th July 1981. Your letter of 9th July (B). As I have already informed you I have no recollection of your mentioning the case of Walker’s passage to me. I remember vaguely your mentioning something about Walker’s dhobi, or punkhawala, or one of his menials, as being partly paid by the State, but have certainly no recollection of your suggesting a court of enquiry on that or any .other matter. 2. With regard to our conversation of yester day afternoon when we went into the question of Walker’s alleged irregularities both (a) and (b) as noted in paragraph 2 of my letter of yester day to you, (A). What you told me, as I under stand it, is as follows. In the summer of 1929 and 1930, when Walker went on leave to India, in addition to his own passage, out of State funds he paid for the passage of Mrs. Walker, and in 1930 for a servant as well. In Govern ment service, as I pointed out, this would not be possible as normally an officer makes the journey first and puts in his T. A. claim after wards. You explained, however, that the Com mandant of the Levy had a lump sum given him every month by the Muscat Treasury wherebj to pay expenses of the force, and that it was out of this sum that Walker paid the passages. The documents proving excess passages are. I understand, in Muscat. When you went over (the accounts you found these passages had been paid for as stated above. I understand from you that the previous Commandant—Captain Stephens—had likewise paid for his wife s passage when going on leave to India. We looked up the relevant clause in Walker’s contract of service wi^s the State which simply states “leave—2 month privilege leave as sanctioned by the Muscat State under Fundamental Rule 123’’. Please confirm the correctness of our conversation in regard to above. 3. We also went into (b)—the case of Walker's, servants. You showed me a list in your file oC about 8 servants paid, I understand, by the State, and employed by Walker, some of them being partially paid by Walker himself. Please let me have a copy of this list with the amount of pay received by the State, amount paid by Walker, and any other remarks you have to make. 4. In addition to the servants on this list there is, so you informed me, another servant a Lance- Naik drawing pay of rank and allowances, alleged to have been Walker’s cook. This individual is mentioned in paragraph 3 of Captain Alban s letter to you, No. D. 0..-134/C. of 9th June, 5. You also informed me that the fines inflict ed on the men of the Levy were put into a sports fund which was used for the refreshment of hockey teams when teams from H. M. Ships used to land at Muscat and go down to Vait-al- Falaj, the Levy Headquarters, to play hockey against the Levy. Would you kindly let me have any other details or comments on this point too? p.g.—Herewith the typed copy of your letter v of 9th July which I said I would let you have. D. Demi-official letter from Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, to Political Resident, Bushire, dated the 10th July 1931. Your D. 0. No. 41I-S. of 10th July 1931 (C). 1. Your para. 1 .—I mentioned to you only the 1930 passage. I did not trace the 1929 passage until after you had left Muscat. 2. Your para. 2 .—I confirm the correctness of your summary of our conversation. I only have Walker’s word that Captaip Stephens paid for his wife’s passage from Muscajt State funds. 3. Your para. 3.—According . to the Acting Commandant’s No. 90 of 11th June 1931, the following became surplus to requirements on the departure of the British Commandant. 1 Sweeper. 1 Dhobi. 2 Pankha coolies. 2 Jaroowala. 1 Boatman. 1 Bhisti. Further details are given in Appendix A.Demi-official letter from Mr. S. E. HedgcocK, Muscat, dated the 10th September 1931. I had intended not to write to you again on my personal affairs, as I felt I had already put you to too much trouble. But the strain of five months* acute anxiety is beginning to tell, and I am filled with fears that all is not going well with my case. I may be completely mistaken, but my fears are based on the following facts :— (a) When I was in Bushire Fowle was openly quite friendly : he took me for rides in his car, -etc. Nevertheless, I sensed that an attempt was being made to obtain from the Council of State -an admission that I was no longer 'persona grater — an admission that would make my re-instatement almost impossible. My fears were confirmed on my return to Muscat on July 25th, when I found the Council had received no intimation that my case was under reconsideration. A telegraphic ^enquiry from Alban merely elicited the fact that I was not re-instated ; no mention was made of the fact that my resignation was to be considered in abeyance pending further enquiries. A subsequent telegram remained un answered. In the circumstances I could only be treated as a private individual. It was not until about the third week in August that Bushire communicated to Alban Foreign’s instructions dated the end of June that my resignation was to be considered in abeyance. By that time it was too late to alter the status quo. Alban considers | that Bushire’s delay in notifying him that my resignation was in abeyance has somewhat preju diced the Council against me, and he has telegraph ed this opinion to the Political Resident, sug gesting that it should be communicated to the Government of India. I can quote other minor instances, the effect of which would be to create such an atmosphere as would induce the Council to state that they did not desire to retain my services. (b) Obstacles were placed in my way to make it difficult or impossible for me to substantiate the charges against Walker. Failure to do this meant, of course, that my re-instatement could not be proceeded with. I mamiged to overcome these obstacles. (c) At Bushire I was subjected to a fortnight’s interrogations. These were used as the basis of a aeries of allegations—or perhaps insinuations would be the better word—against me. I was not informed what they were, but I can make a shrewd guess. I can completely disprove them, and at one time thought of doing so. In the end, I decided not to add fuel to the fire. (d) I am now in a position to state that th e .events between Col. Biscoe’s visit of February 15th and the tendering of my resignation on April 10th were not fully or accurately reported to Colonel Biscoe. Had this been done, the occasion for my resignation might never have arisen. Also it is possible—an important point—that this misleading reporting may have caused Colonel Biscoe to object to my re-instatement. The cumulative effect of the above is to make me feel very apprehensive that I am up against unfair odds. I very much regret having to make the above statements, but the instinct of self preserva tion is a strong one. None of them is wildly made. Alban is in a difficult position ; he has to do what Bushire tells him, though in his heart of h arts he feels that the scales are being unfairly weighted against me. It is true that, at a time when both he and the Council were annoyed at my non-return to Muscat (due to my delay in Simla and visit to Bushire), he wrote a letter ex pressing the view that I should not be re-instated. . But, in the light of fuller knowledge, he wrote a second letter recommending my retention, and asking that a copy might be sent to the Govern ment of India. In spite of the attempts to prejudice them against me, the Council did not, when officially asked the question, state that they had no desire to retain my services, but left the matter in the hands of the Government of India. Their attitude seems to be that they cannot officially ask for the retention of a man accused of being unfriendly to the Government of India, until that accusation has been withdrawn. In the same way that they were “ advised ” to terminate my services, they wish to be “ advised ” to retain them. I realize I am up against a great deal of personal animosity. The sole cause of this is that I took, a step which was tantamount to reporting the local representatives of the Government of India to Simla. I was obliged to do this in Muscat’s interests as official affairs here were thoroughly unsatisfactory, and I could not obtain local redress. Dissmissal for such a step seems an excessive penalty. It is unfortunate that my re-instate ment depends to some extent on the good-will of the above mentioned officials : On leaving Simla, I was told that my re-instate ment depended upon :— (а) My being able to substantiate the charges against Walker. (I was certain I could do this.) (б) Col. Biscoe’s agreeing to smooth things over ; you added that you had brought the Viceroy into the matter to make it practically impossible for him to refuse. I had thus to make my plans for the future on the assumption that the probabilities were that I should be re-instated. At Bushire I received the offer of a post in the Iraq Petroleum Company (acquisition of the land required for the Baghdad Haifa pipe line) worth Rs. 500 p.m. more than my present post. After my visit to Simla, I felt committed to Muscat, so sent a temporizing reply, I now hear that the post is being filled by some one else. I am beginning to feel that my drastic action in Muscat’s interests may result in a heavy personal penalty. If I may venture a personal opinion, I would say that were I once definitely re-instated, the whole matter would soon blow over, I am pre pared to do everything possible to that end. May I most earnestly ask you most kindly to send me some intimation by telegram as to my future ? I must decide almost at once whether to give a term’s notice on account of my children, to cancel my wife’s passage, etc. Finally, I wish to say again how very much I regret having to trouble you with this letter, particularly if it happens that all my fears that my case is in jeopardy are baseless.

HeOGCOCK, Muscat, No. S.-18/9, dated the 18th Septem* ^BER 1931. May I leavd you to draw your own conclusions from the following facts ? (а) In the latter half of March I left my house for the Agency with the determination of bringing into my discussion with Fowle concerning Walker’s irregularities the three words “court of enquiry ”. I did so : Fowle swears that I did’nt. It is possible that he failed to hear these words. Perhaps he did not wish to hear them : See (6) below. (б) In the first half of June Alban reported to Bushire in writing (D. 0.) that Walker’s mis appropriations exceeded Rs. 5,000. He received a private letter from Bradshaw saying that it was not considered his duty to take up such irregula rities. Thus for the second time no action was taken. (c) At Simla I was given to understand tha^ I was to make jointly with Alban a full enquiry into Walker’s alleged irregularities, and that I was to travel to Muscat via Bushire. To my surprise, Fowle himself disposed of three of the four charges against Walker, leaving only one for me to investi gate jointly with Alban. I pointed out in writing (letter dated 10th July 1931) that the accounts and other documentary evidence were in Muscat, but to no avail. Subsequently I learnt that Fowle had to all intents exonerated Walker on the three charges he himself had dealt with. (d) Even in the case of the fourth .charge— Personal Servants—an attempt was made to pre vent my making a joint investigation with Alban. After I had been in Bushire nearly a fortnight I learnt that Fowle had arranged with Bradshaw for me to stay yet a third week. I made a mild protest, and was told that Bushire was much cooler Lhan Muscat and that the fourth charge was of so simple a nature that Alban could easily dispose of it by himself. On my insisting that I should proceed to Muscat, I was allowed to depart. On arrival at Muscat I found that Alban had received definite instructions to complete his investigations into the fourth charge within a week, and to send his report direct to Simla. Thus, had I remained in Bushire the extra week as arranged for me, Alban would have carried out his enquiry without the aid of my specialized knowledge—-aid I was most anxious to give as my re-instatement depended upon my substantiating the charges against Walker. Also, in his instructions to Alban, Fowle had indicated as far as he dare the line his subordinate was to take—exoneration. A man of less independence of character than Alban might well have followed his superior officer’s lead. (e) When on 17th July 1931 I mentioned to Fowle that I might have other irregularities of Walker’s to report, he became flustered, objected to my “ piece-meal ” methods (I was doing my best to get to Muscat where the accounts were, in order to make a thorough investigation), and finally in his letter dated 18th July 1931 wrote that, subject to any orders received from Government, his decision was that “ the evidence against Walker was closed, and no new charges could be accepted In my letter of the same date I protested against this restriction Upon my enquiries, but Fowle was adamant. Were copies of this correspondence sent to Simla ? I asked that they shcu’d be. In case they were not, I endlose full extracts. (/) On my farewell visit to Fowle, I asked him if he - considered that I had made out a “ prima facie ” case against Walker on the three allegations he himself had dealt with. He replied that I had. I can only imagine that he prevaricated in order to lull me into a false sense of security. (g) On arrival at Muscat I explained to Alban the unfairness of the restrictions placed upon my enquiry. He wired to Bushire recommending their removal. Fowle approved, but directed that through Alban’s report on the fourth charge was to be sent direct to Simla as already instructed, all new charges were to be sent to him at Bushire, a decision which involved a delay of 2-3 weeks before these new charges could officially come to Simla’s notice. (h) Finally, Fowle having omitted to inform Alban that my resignation was in abeyance, I found that I had to carry out my enquiry into Walker’s irregularities under the severe and humili- tating handicap of being regarded as a dismissed official. It was touch and go that I got the evid ence I was after. What redress have I against this sort of thing ? Though Fowle knew that the Viceroy desired my retention, he has used his high official position to prevent as far as he could my re-instatement. Can I ask for a court of enquiry ? With the exception of my resignation being in abeyance, all the above facts were known to me 49 days ago. I did not report them as I am not vindicative, dislike washing dirty linen, and was confident of my re-instatement. Now that I am less confident I feel that I ought to report them in my own interests. When I left Muscat for Simla on June 12th I understood that Alban and the Council were pre pared to take no action in the matter of terminating my services until the result of my appeal to the Foreign Secretary was known, and I promised to cable the result to Alban. But no sooner had Fowle heard of my departure than he sent tele graphic instructions to Alban to obtain an imme diate decision from the Council. This eagerness to confront Simla with a “ fait accompli ” before my appeal was heard, betrays so strong a personal bias against me as to make it advisable to accept, I venture to submit, all Fowle’s statements con cerning myself with extreme reserve. I can also prove that in his despatches to Colonel Biscoe Fowle suppressed vital information. This act of his was partly, if not wholly, responsible for my resignation, and doubtless biased Colonel Biscoe against me. I should be grateful if you would bring this letter to Mr. Howell’s notice, if he is not too busy. P. S .—At the beginning of the year the pay of the Levy Sepoy was Rs. 30 p.m. The reduction to Rs. 25 p.m. involved a crisis. Alban has just sent a despatch to Bushire giving convincing reasons why it should be reduced to Rs. 20 p. m.GIPD—L 427(c) F&amp;PD— 4 12 31—Id Extracts attached. P. P. S .—Please refer to P. R.’s telegram No. 481 of l()th September 1931 to Foreign. Alban’s cable quoted therein concluded with the words—“ I suggest Government of India be informed that had Hedgcock resumed duties on return from Bushire Council would ' ave backed him more. His cohduct has been exemplary”. These last two sentences, which might have count ed in my favour, have been omitted in Fowle’s telegram. I think that a Court of Enquiry will reveal how r un atisfactory were official affairs in Muscat on my arrival, and what lengths have been gone to to get rid of a man who was not afraid to say so. S. E. Hedgcgck,— -19-9-31. Demi-official letter to Mr. S&gt;. E. Hedgcock, Karachi, No. F.-228-N./31, dated the 24th September 1931. Your letter of the 10th of September reached me on the 17th. 2. Although the Government of India had arrived at a definite decision about your case on the 14th, action was withheld on receipt of your tele gram of the 10th instant pending receipt of your letter which I will now endeavour to answer. 3. To begin with I must correct what seem to me to be certain definite misunderstandings on your part. In making their decision in this very difficult case the Government of India are unable to admit that there was any question of personal animosity on the part of any of their officers against you ; nor was their judgment influenced by any allegations or insinuations against you, since none such were made. Further, it is hardly correct to say that on leaving Simla you were told that your re-instatement depended upon your being able to substantiate the charges against Walker. The actual fact was that pending a reply from Colonel Biscoe regarding your re-instatement you were asked to go to Bushire to assist in substantiating the charges of irregularities on Walker’s part which had come to light during the consideration of your own case. You were also told that if Colonel Biscoe did not raise objections, the Govern ment of India would themselves be ready to forget wiiat had passed a :d to smooth things over. 4. Colonel Biscoe’s reply amounts to thas, that he would be quite ready to fall in with the suggestion of the Government of India if he were satisfied that you were really the right man for the post and that your retention would be in the best interests of Muscat. Br** these points, however, for reasons given, he was i satisfied. Things b ing in this position, as you must see, there could be no other solution than that the Muscat State Council should decide. Theirs was the only opinion which could possibly be set against the views of the Government of India’s responsible adviser. They were accordingly given a clear opening to state their wishes and a promise that full consideration would be given to any views which they might express. Whatever Saiyid Said or any other Member of the Council may have said to you, they gave no indication officially of any desire to modify their previous attitude or to avail themselves of the opportunity to retain your services. It was not possible for the Government of India to force you on them or compel them to keep you on, if they did not so desire. Hence the decision which I will ask you to believe no one regrets more than I do, but, if you will forgive me for saying it, I cannot help feeling that you yourself are primarily responsible for what has happened. I told you when you were in Simla that you might be an expert in hand ling Arabs, but you seemed to me to have much left to learn about dealing with British officers. Much that has passed since then makes me doubt the first opinion, but confirms the second. If I may be frank, I would add to it that you seem also to be inclined to make momentous decisions without adequate reflection and without reference to others who could give you valuable advice.. You tell me now for the first time of an advanta geous offer which you received while at Bushire and felt bound to refuse “ out of loyalty to Muscat ”. The sentiment does you credit, but why did you not consult me, as an old riend, if not as Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, before rejecting the offer ? could have told you at once that a man who had resigned Muscat service and whose resignation was only being held in abeyance need have no hesitation in accepting other employment. I can quite under stand how you feel about having let a good offer go, but the fact is really irrelevant. It remains only for me to express the hope that you will very shortly get an alternative appoint ment elsewhere and to wish you the best of luck.GIPD—L 427fc) F&amp;PD— 4-12-31—10. Demi-official letter to Major T. C. W. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian s Gulf, No. F.-228 N./31, dated the 5th October 1931. Please refer to the correspondence ending with your demi-official letter No. 562-S., dated the 31st August 1931 On examination of the correspondence relating to the termination of Hedgcock’s services with the Muscat State the Government of India are of opinion that they have some ground of complaint as to the manner in which you dealt with this difficult question which appears to have been perhaps in some respects not quite up to the gtandard to be expected of an officer of your e xperience and antecedents and with your record. The first occasion arose when the allegation of irregularities on Walker’s part was brought to your notice, however informally, by Hedgcock at Muscat. Any such allegation in respect of a British officer belonging to the Government of India touches the very quick and ought to be taken up and investigated at once. Even though noth ing was communicated to you in writing by Hedgcock about this matter, the Government of India think that it should not have been allowed to slide as it was. The second instance in which the Government of India are disposed to think that you may have been to blame was in your omission to inform the Muscat State Council, through the Political Agent, that Hedgcock’s resignation was to be considered as temporarily in abeyance for the reasons stated. You have, however, already dealt with this in your demi-official No. 562-S., dated the 31st of August 1931 in which you have expressed regret for that omission and there is no need to refer to it further at present. The third is in respect of your action in detaining Hedgcock at Bushire after his return from Simla without telling the Political Agent to inform the Muscat State Council of what you were doing. You may at first have been in some doubt, from the previous correspondence addressed to you or of which you had been sent copies, whether the investigation into Walker’s conduct was to be undertaken by Alban or by you. But Wylie’s demi-official letter No. F.-19-N./31 should have left you in no doubt as to the pro cedure to be followed. Indeed it would seem from your telegram No. 390, dated the 5th of July that you yourself were disposed to think that the investigation had best be carried out at Muscat. It is, however, not so much in respect of your undertaking the investigation yourself at Bushire and detaining Hedgcock there as of your omitting to tell the State Council what was being done that in the opinion of the Govern ment of India you appear to have erred. It is not suggested that in acting as you did on the second and third occasions you were in any way actuated by a desire to prejudice Hedgcock’s case. But what you did or omitted to do is capable of that construction, and it is possible that attempts may be made to place that construction on it. It is also possible that the attitude of the Muscat State Council towards Hedgcock and the question of his retention may actually have been influenced by these omissions. It was to prevent such con sequences that the precise directions of the Govern ment of India were given. The Government of India do not wish that their officers should be exposed to any such imputation and therefore feel that they are justified in complaining that directions deliberately given by them for a certain purpose were not exactly and punctually followed. A copy of this letter is being sent to Colonel Biscoe for his information.* 4. Your para. 4.—I know nothing about the cook beyond the statement contained in para. &lt;3 of Alban’s D. O.

During our conversation on the afternoon of the 9th you mentioned that there were some other irregularities of a very minor nature which you were doubtful whether it was worth while pressing now. You asked whether they could be brought up later. I replied that all irregular'. • .ties should be brought up now. In the second paragraph of your Accountant General’s letter.

I paid Walker 1 g- passage on his assur ance that he was entitled to it, and that it was recoverable from the Indian Army Authorities, from whom I have claimed a refund. If the Indian Army Authorities disallow the 3/5 passage I propose to recover it from Walker. 2. The extra rations for dogs is the only minor irregularity that has been brought officially to my notice. I know nothing about this matter beyond the fact that the Regimental Dog, In addition to drawing 3 lbs. of atta daily, also draws Re. 1 per diem for goats-meat plus occa sional small sums for firewood to cook the said goats-meat. Demi-official letter from the Hon’ble Major T. C. W. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident, Bushire, No. 429-S., dated the 17th July 1931. Rations: The atta ration account was verified for the period from 1st January 1930 to the end of June 1930 as directed. It was found Reference Wylie’s demi-official letter No. F. &lt; 19-N./31, dated the 29th June 1931, enclosing copy of your letter of 23rd June to Colonel Biscoe.7 &amp; Hedgcock arrived here o»i the 8th July and I have been going into the question of Walker's alleged irregularities with him. Hedgcocdc brought a file or two with him and has given me enough material on which to give an opinion on ^ this matter. 3. 1 have already in another connection— vide my demi-official letter No. 427-S. of 15th July —referred at some length to Hedgcock s omission to report, either officially or demi-officially, the matter of these irregulari ties to me at Muscat, when Walker—the indi vidual most concerned—and I were on the spot, or even to me later at Karachi where—as Politi cal Agent, Muscat—I was on recess until 24th May. 1 have again to refer to this omission here as it has of course made my enquiry much more difficult, Walker being now in England on leave. 4. Hedgcock does not seem to realise fully his responsibilities in this matter. It is he as Finan cial Adviser, and not the Political Agent, who is responsible for Muscat Finances, and the only circumstances in which he (the Political Agent) can be held responsible for reporting, or investi gating these finances, whether in the shape of irregularities or otherwise, are w r hen they have been properly reported to him by the Financial Adviser, which in this case was not done. In the letters wdiich we have exchanged, for instance, there are various remarks by Hedgcock, showing that he apparently expects the Political Agent Muscat, to do a good deal of his work for him in investigating the irregularities. He (Hedg cock) '‘knows nothing about the cook beyond the statement contained in paragraph 3 of Alban’s D. O. No. 134/C. of 9th June. He asks me under what authority did Walker claim, and get from him (Hedgeock) the passage on which he (Walker) left Muscat (a week after I did!) (letter “F”, paragraph 2, and letter “G”, para graph 2). ‘“Alban informed me Walker paid the dhobi Es. 5, etc.’’ (enclosure to letter “D”). Responsibility for investigating the irregulari ties prior to such an enquiry as I am making now is of course entirely the Financial Adviser s. 5. As Hedgcock was the responsible individual making these allegations as to irregularities I think he might have arrived here with some sort of complete case written out. This, however, he had not done, and I have had to base my en quiry on conversations supported by exchange of letters—a laborious process which has taken up a good deal of my time. Copies of relevant letters are attached. 6. Hedgcock’s views on enquiries seem to be unorthodox. In one of our conversations (letter ■“G”, paragraph 3) he mentioned there were minor irregularities of Walker, which he was doubtful whether it w'ould be worth while pressing now T , and asked me if they could be brought up ‘later’. To this peculiar suggestion I of course replied that all irregularities must be brought up now. (See also letter “H”, paragraph 2). 7. The irregularities may be divided into four parts as below (paragraph 8). Of these 1 have given an opinion on (1), (2), and (4). (3), how ever, I cannot investigate properly here. I have therefore transferred it for enquiry to Alban (vide mv D O No. 430 -S. of 17th July 1931, copy attached, and Wylie’s D. O. No. F.-19-N./31 of 2nd July 1931). I had previously transferred to him the case of one of the servants (vide copy of mv D 0. No. 415-S;. of 11th July attached). I have, it will be noted, instructed Alban to let you have his opinion direct, to save time, send ing a copy to me. Hedgcock’s presence is not necessary at Muscat for purposes of the enquiry as to the servants. He has given me here ail that he knows about this point (see letters “O’ , paragraph 3; “D ”, paragraphs 3 and 4 witn Appendix; “E’’, paragraph 1 (3) and paragraph 3; “N’’ with enclosure, and “P” with enclosure). No enquiry into irregularities can be properly completed without the evidence of the individual accused of committing these irregularities. lu fairness to Walker therefore, when Alban’s report has been received, I suggest that it as w r ell ns mine be sent to Walker for his reply. 8. The alleged irregularities for the purpose of enquiry may be divided into four main parts: — (1) Unauthorised Passages; (2) Fines put into Sports Fund; (3) Employment as private servants of indi viduals paid by the State; (4) Unauthorised dog rations. (1) Unauthorised Pass#*/jch. 9. The case is as follows: Walker, in the sum mer of 1929 and 1930, when he w T ent on leave to India, in addition to his own passage, out of State funds paid for Mrs. Walker’s passage on both occasions, and in 1930 for a servant as well, this being outside the terms of his contract (letter “C ”, paragraph 2 and letter “D ”, para graph 2, and Walker’s contract w r ith the Muscat (State [paragraph 2 (2)], (Serial Nos. 5 and 9 in F. No. 314-A./28). 10. In Government service this ■worild not be possible as normally an officer makes the journey first and puts in his T. A. claim afterwards. Hedgcock, however, explained to me that the Commandant of the Levy had a lump sum given him every month by the Muscat Treasury where hr to pay expenses of the force, and that it was out of this sum Walker paid the passages—letter “C”, paragraph 2 and letter “D”, paragraph 2. 11. Walker, according to his own statement, had a precedent for this in the fact that the pre vious Commandant—Captain Stephens (Serial No. 6 in F. No. 13 (2)-A./26)—had likewise paid for his wife’s passage when going on leave (letter “C’’, paragraphs, and letter “D”, paragraph 2). 12. These passages were duly entered in the accounts by Walker or Hedgcock could not have discovered them, and therefore no attempt at concealment was made. If these passages were objectionable from the point of view of the State, Hedgcock’s predecessor—Thomas—should have objected in the first instance—1929—, and claimed the cost from Walker. As no objection was made Walker not unnaturally took these passages a second time in 1930. To this also Thomas raised no objection. 13. Taking these various factors into account.- that he had a precedent (Capt. Stephens : accord ing to Walker’s own statement), that no objec tion was raised by the Financial Adviser of the time, either in the first or second instance, and that the passages were duly entered in the ac counts. I am of opinion that Walker acted in good faith, and that no blame attaches to him. 14. Rut even when an officer acts in good faith that is not sufficient—as we all know to our cost —to bar an accounts objeetion. It sometimeshappens that an officer in Government service haying completed a journey claims in good faith, nnd receives from the local Treasury, more than he is entitled to. When this comes to the notice of the Accountant General, Central Revenues, though no blame attaches to the officer never theless he has to refund the surplus. In order to dispose finally of the question of Walker’s passages I think this aspect must be gone into: what does Walker owe the State for over-drawal, if anything? 15. Walker s contract with the Muscat State as far as his leave is concerned merely states: 'leave—2 months’ privilege leave annually as sanctioned by the Muscat State under F. E. 123”. Walker took up his appointment at Muscat in April or May 1928. F. -K. 123 then read: ' a Government servant in foreign service out of India may, unless special arrangements as to leave have been made on his behalf by the authority sanctioning his transfer, be granted leave by his employer on such conditions as the employer may determine. The leave-salary on such leave will be paid by the employer, and the leave will not be debited against the Govern ment servant’s leave account.” In September of the same year it was altered to read as fol lows : '123. (a) A Government servant in foreign service out of India may be granted leave by his employer on such condi tions as the employer may determine. In any individual case the authority sanctioning the transfer may detennine beforehand, in consultation with the employer, the conditions on which leave will be granted by the employer. The leave-salary in respect of leave granted by the employer will be paid by the employer and the leave will not be de bited against the Government servant’s leave account. (b) In special circumstances, the authority sanctioning a transfer to foreign service Due by State oat of India may make an arrangement: with the foreign employer, under which, leave may be granted to the Government servant in accordance with the rules ap plicable to nim as a Government ser vant, if the foreign employer pays to general revenues leave contribution aU the rate prescribed under Fundamental liule 116.” 16. It may be argued that an officer should look out for him self r but I venture to think that it would have been better if the 'sanctioning authority” in Walker’s case, the Foreign, and. Political Department, had taken advantage of F. E. 123 to make on his behalf, through the Political Eesident for instfance, 'special arrange ments” for his leave passages. It would at any rate have prevented this question from ever com ing up. However, this was not done, so I must take the case as I find it. 17. In trying to draw up a balance of account between Walker and the State, I think the fol lowing is a fair line of argument Under F. E. 123 no special arrangements were made for Walker’s leave passages. There was, however, a precedent in the case of Captain Stephens, which was sanctioned by the State, and when Walker himseff followed the precedent in two consecutive years no objection was made by the Financial Adviser on behalf of the State, which may therefore be supposed to have sanctioned it.. Objection was only raised some time later by a new Financial Adviser. I think therefore that it may be assumed that Walker, during his period of service at Muscat, was due leave passages for himself and his wife. 18. Of course if the State think that these con cessions are too costly, they can take the matter up with Government before a new Commandant is appointed. 19. Walker’s passage account therefore with, the State would run as follows: — t) Walker 4 Remarks. 1. (a) 1928—3 fares by rail for Walker and 1 for his wife On first joining; Payable from Muscat State* from his station in India to Karachi. Under ordinary procedure the Department ... to which an officer goes pays for his joining On first joining Walker may have travelled on a journey. wairant from his station to Karachi. (Under S. R. Presumably this has- already been paid, to 116. I presume this is the rule that applies ?) Walker. (b) 1928 —3 fares by steamer fpr Walker and 1 for his wife from Karachi to Muscat. (Under S. R. 116.) 2. 1929—2 fares by steamer from Muscat to Karachi and back Ori leave. fer Walker and his wife, as drawn by Captain Stephens (see paragraph 11). 3. 1930—2 fares by steamer from Muscat to Karachi and back On leave. for Walker and his wife, as dra wn by Captain Stephens—paragraph 11. Due by Walker to the State. Sums already drawn under (1), (2) and (3) O plus I passage [letter 'F”, para- O graph 1 (1)]. The Government of India pay Walker’s way back to his station and this sum is really an ad vance from the State to Walker. A balance on these line 0 should accord ingly be struck by the Muscat Treasury and forwarded to Walker, through' the Political Agent, Muscat, for comment. 20. It may be noted—as a side issue—that Hedgcock, who is of opinion that Walker should not have charged his servant’s fare as far as Karachi, himself the other day when he pro ceeded on recess to India took a servant with him as far as Simla—a much more expensive journey, for which he proposes charging the State (letter 'L”, paragraph 2, and letter 'O’” paragraph (1) Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?(2) Sports Fund. 21. The irregularity in this connection is that the lines indicted on the men of the Levy were alleged to have been put into a Sports Fund .^whioh was used for the refreshment 01 iiockey jeams when teams from H. JV1. Ships used to land at Muscat and go down to Bait-al-Falaj, the Levy Headquarters, to play hockey against the Levy (letter “0”, paragraph 5 and letter “D”, paragraph 5). Also see letter 31/3 of 10th June 1931 (Enclo. of letter F), from the Muscat Accountant General to the Financial Adviser, from which the following figures are quoted for ready reference: Rs. A. p. Sale of tickets and tea, soda, etc., on cash ..•••• l,t'6o 15 0 Fines imposed on members of the force : 288 10 0 Sale of empty gunny bags . . lio 8 0 Contribution from Naval team of R. I. Marine . . . • 10 0 0 Total . 1J80 1 0 22. It will be seen that Fines represent a very small proportion of the total ^ 11s. 28S-10 _ 0 out of nearly Fs. 1,800, the balance being made up from quite legitimate sources. Here again, no concealment was made or the item could not have been discovered. A Sports Fund in it self is of course an excellent thing, the matches against H. M. Ships are very popular with the Levy, and go to increase its esprit de corps. It is always customary for the Home team any where to provide refreshments for the visitors, and quite an appreciable amount of the refresh ments were put away by the Levy themselves as w T ell as by visitors amongst whom occasion ally were Hedgcock and myself. There is nothing to show that the fines were specially allocated to refreshments, and I imagine that this item was lumped together with the others of the fund to meet general expenses: sticks, balls, goal-posts, kit, refreshment for visitin c teams, etc. 23. It must be remembered that under the peculiar conditions prevailing at Muscat there is no scale of punishment laid down by the State for the men of the Levy, and the Com mandant makes his own including fines. In these circumstances I don’t think it at all un natural that the Commandant should have re garded himself as free to dispose of the fines as he thought best—so long as he did not put them in his own pocket—and short of crediting them to the Muscat State, which technically was the correct thing to do, he certain'y made the best use of them by placing them in a fund from which the Levy as a whole womd benefit. I think, how r ever, that the sum in rhe Fund under Fines had better be credited to tne State, ns well as such items in the future. (3) Servants. 24. See paragraph 7 above. (4) Unauthorised dog rations. 25. This seems to be of a trifling nature. The Kegimental Dog is the Levy mascot- an Irish wolf hound— presented to the Corps by ^ the Sultan. As the matter has come up, Walker had better be asked to explain. p s. I am sending copies of this letter to Colonel Biscoe and Captain Alban.

Hedgcock arrived here last Wednesday and I am investigating the question of Walker's alleged irregularities wdth him. One of the points involved is the question of Walker’s cook who—according to the statement m paragraph 3 of your D. O. No. 134/C, of 9th June to Hedgcock—was a Lance-Naik drawing pay of rank and rations. Hedgcock states that all he knows about this individual is your statement. Please let me have your proofs. Enclosure 2. D. 0. LETTER FROM THE POLL. BeSDT., BuSHIRE, to the Poll. Agent, Muscat, No. 43fl-S., dated 17th July 1931. In continuation of my demi-official letter No. 415-S. of 11th July 1931 and my telegram No. 408 of today’s date, asking you to suspend action and take the case of this individual up together with the rest of the servants’ case, which I w T as transferring to you, 1 enclose a copy of my demi-official letter No. 429-S, cf 17th July to Mr. Howell, on the subject of Walker’s alleged irregularities. 2. Please see paragraph 7 of the report which shows the circumstances under wh : ch I am transferring this part of the case to you. 3. You have already undertaken some in vestigation in the case, vide, for instance, your D. 0. letter No. 134/C, of 9th June 1931, to Hedgcock, and also D. 0. letter No. C.-135 of 15th June 1931, which you addressed to Brad shaw, on the subject. Please, however, take up this part of the case de novo on the evidence which Hedgcock has given me here and on what you get in Muscat. These two combined should give you ample evidence to come to a decision.4. The point on which you must decide is whether Walker employed as private servants individuals paid by the State, if so. how many individuals were so employed, in what capacity, how much they were paid by the State, how much by Walker, and, if possible, for how long were they in Walker’s service. 5. Hedgcock is going to Muscat. I do not think his presence there is necessary fur your enquiry, as you could get figures, etc., from his Accountant General, but if he wants to give evidence about the servants he can ol course do so. 6. He mentioned to me, yesterday, that there may be some other irregularities that he might like to bring up in future, and has informed me that he reserves himself the right to pat up his case when and how he likes. This seems to me a most unusual attitude, and if it were generally adopted enquiries would never come to an end. I have informed him that he had ample time in Muscat, from the date Walker left on the 25th April to the date he (Hedg cock) left for Simla on the 7th June, to pre pare his case, to say nothing of the time ho had before Walker left. As far as 1 am con cerned, therefore, and unless orders to the con trary are received from the Government of India, the evidence against Walker is now com plete and no other alleged irregularities will be enquired into. 7. To save time you should send your report to the Government of India direct, with a copy to me. M D. 0. LETTER FROM THE HeSDT., BUSHIRE, 10 Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, No. 426-S., dated loin July 1931. JK With reference to Walker’s alleged irregu larities. From the conversations we have Rad (see our exchange of letters) these can apparent ly be divided into four main parts: — (1) Unauthorised passages; (2) Fines put into Sports Fund; (3) Private servants paid by the State; (4) Extra Dog rations. • anc * 4 think I have now got information enough to give an opinion. 3. (3), however, I should like to be made clearer. As I understand it you state tnat alker employed as nis private servants a number ot individuals paid by the State, and lese individuals—8 in number—are given in tie Appendix “A” to your letter “D” (10th ti U i i ^ hen next we meet 1 will synchronise the alphabetical marking of our correspondence). There is also a 9th man—the cook—of whom you know nothing beyond what Alban inform ed you (your letter “D”, para. 4). Please oon- nrm that the above summary is correct. 4. Also please state exactly on what evidence —documentary or otherwise—your statement is based that these men were actually employed by Walker as his private servants. If vou have documentary evidence with you please let me have copies. L D. 0. LETTER FROM THE llESDT., BlSHIRE. TO Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, No. 425-S. ? dated Iotii JuLy 1931. With reference to our conversation on the 13th about your repent visit to Simla. W e were both agreed that Karachi should be the place of recess for the Financial Adviser as it is for the Political Agent (Muscat), but that if the Financial Adviser had State work eisew'here he could get special permission from the Council to proceed there at State expense—as you did on this occasion. It is/ just as well to have this principle laid dowm. 2. The actual fares you are billing ihe State with are one 1st Class—without food—from Muscat to Karachi, with one 3rd Class for servant, and similarly on to Simla and back. 3. The question of your contract with the Muscat State also came up. You confirmed the fact that you have not yet signed it. I reminded you that we had had some conver sation on the subject in Muscat when you had asked to see Thomas’ contract and the corres pondence which had taken place with the Council about your terms, and which were duly shown to you. I also reminded you that the reason you then gave' me for not signing your contract was that—from your point of view— it was not good enough. N D. G. letter from Mr. S. E. .Hedgcock, to the Resdt., Bushire, dated the 15th July 1931, Para. 3 of your D. 0. No. 426-S, of 15th July 1931 (M.). (1) In my letter, dated 9th July 1931 (B), I mentioned: (a) that I had my suspicions that some of the followers who appeared in the Levy budget were used by Walker for his personal needs— e.g., the dhobi. Ip) that his boatman was paid for from State funds (in this case the monthly accounts—at present in Mus cat—constitute the documentary evi dence). (c) After Walker’s departure the Subedar Major mentioned to me in the course of conversation that he had discharged certain follow r ers as surplus to require ments because of the absence of the British Commandant. In my No. 1/20/98 of 7th June 1931, I asked the Subedar Major to let me have details of the men he had discharged (original letter is at Muscat). He replied in his No. 90 of 11th June 1931 (original enclosed herewith) giving the parti culars I had asked for.11 It is to be noted that the Subedar Major dis charged the men given in his list on his own authority. They were not dismissed on orders from the Council or myself. These men can only have been used t'y ^ Walker in his official or in his private capacity. In Appendix A attached to my letter of 10th July 1931 (D), I suggested that one punkha coolie and one jaroowala might have been em ployed by Walker in his official capacity. It is difficult to see how Walker couM have em ployed the services, except in his private capa city, of a dhobi, sweeper, bhisti, boatman, 2nd punkha coolie, etc. p.

As you have already been told Hedgcock’s resignation must be regarded as in abeyance until charges against Walker are cleared up (para. 2 of Wylie’s demi-official letter No. F.-19-N/31, dated 2i.d July 1931). Govt, of India have not yet received Alban’s report re ferred to in ptra. 7 of your demi-official letter No. 429-S., dated July 17th Demi-official litter from the Political Agent, Muscat, No. C.-175, dated the 7th August 1931. Phase refer to d^mi-official letter No. 429-S., dated th 17th July 1931, from Major Fowle to Mr. Howell, paragraph 7. I forward herewith Hedgcock’s report regarding the employment by Captain Walker of State paid individuals as his personal servants. 2. You will see in Appendix “ A ”, para. II that a list of 12 servants, paid by the State, has been drawn up. Out of these 12, however, Hedgcock has allowed l orderly, 1 Jaroowala and 1 Bhisti as being a legitimate charge on the State, the wages of l Puukhawala, at the cum nt rate of Rs. 7 for 6 months has also been deducted from the total of wages paid to Punkha coolie No. V over three years. 3. The servants required by an Englishman (bachelor) in Muscat are :— 1. Cook. 2. Table servant or bearer. 3. Masalchi. 4. Punkha coolie (6 months). 5. Dhobi. 6. Sweeper. 7. Jaroowala. 8. Bhisti. i According to Mr. Hedgcock, however, Captain Walk r only had one private servant who was dispensed with last year (para. 4 of Hedgcock’s report). It must be clear therefore that Captain Walker did actually have the above servants, and, as he had none of his own, they must have been drawn from the Levy Corps. In addition to the above, there is shown a boat man, who attended to Captain Walker’s private boat, an orderly, an extrx Punkha coolie and an extra Jaroowala. 4. Para. 4 of the report states that the average monthly sum out of a salary of Rs. 1,255 per ’ mensem remitt id by Captain Walker to his bank, over a period of 6 months was Rs. 950. As a bachelor and living under very temporary conditions here, my expensis were Rs. 6oO for June and Rs. 400 for July, this month, August, I expect to cost me Rs. 500 owing to several visits by the Navy and Ah' Force. It is therefore difficult to suppose that Captain and Mrs. Walker, who from all accounts enter tained in some style, could have existed on under Rs. 300 p.r month. 5. Mr. Hedgcock has produced Captain Walker’s private account book before me and it shows clearly the number of servants employed, their names and the extra allowances paid them by Captain Walker. The same men are shown on the Acquilt mce Rolls of the Levy Corps as Government personnel in receipt of pay and rations. There is no doubt that Captain Walker did em ploy the number of servants shown and that they we.e at the same time paid and rationed by the State. I think that Hedgcock is right in allowing him 1 orderly amt the services of a Bhisti free, the allowance of 1 Punkha Coolie for the office (Appendix “ A ”, para. 5) and 1 Jaroowala for cleaning the empty wing (para. 9) is also in order. The rest of the servants, 9 in number, as shown in para. II of Appendix “ A ”, ought never to have been a charge on the State and the amount which the State has had to pay on this account can legitimately be claimed as a refund from Captain Walker. It is interesting to note that the total sum claimed, i.e., Rs. 7,657, over a period of 3 years works out to approximately Rs. 200 a month which is just what a married couple in the Army, living anywhere, would pay for servants. The gravest charge against Captain Walker is that when repeatedly asked to effect all possible economies in followers etc., to help the State out of a financial ensis he deliberately stated that he was down to rockbottom and could not dispense with any more, this while himself employing 12 of them for his own personal service. 6. I suggest that the Financial Advisor should first approach Captain Walker privately with a view to making him refund the above sum. If this fails the matter can be taken up officially. It may be noted that the accuracy of figures quoted in Aopendix A ” is vouched for by the Accountant-General, Muscat State. A copy of this letter has been sent to Major Fowle in accordance with para. 7 of his D. O. letter No. 430-S., dated the I7th July 1831 to me. Demi-official letter from Mr. S. E. Hedg cock, Muscat, to the Political Agent, Muscat, No. S.-3/8, dated the 3hd August 1931. Part I. — Servants. 1. On July 29th I proceeded to Bait-al-Falaj to enquire, at the request of the Government of2 India, into tlic alleged financial irregularities of the late Commandant, Captain A. R. Walker, I. A. 1 was accompanied by Rai Sahib Duli Chand, Accountant-General to the Government of Muscat. 2. Among the records was an account book containing details of the Sports Fund, the Hockey Fund etc. In this bock 1 came aen ss a record of Captain Walker’s personal expen diture. 3. Captain Walker’s private account covers the period 1st July 1930—23rd April 1931. It gives the names of the Government employees used by him as personal servants and the month ly allowance paid to each. Also it shows for the six-month period lat August 1930—31st January 1931 that on a pay of Rs. 1,255 p.m. Captain Walker was able to remit to Lloyds Bank, Karachi, an average sum of Rs. 950 p.m. and that his average monthly living expenses during this period were Ra. 295. As Captain and Mrs. Walker’s stylo of living (their hospi tality was a byword throughout the Gulf) could not possibly be maintained on this figure, even allowing for the small sum spent on Servants as shown b low, enquiries were made to sc o if Captain Walker enjoyed any other privileges at the expense of the State. The result of these enquiries is given in Part II of this report. The above mentioned account shows that during the period 1st August 1930—28th Febru ary 1931 Captain Walker— (a) kept only one private servant, namely, a gardener’s boy on Rs. 6 p.m. (engag ed in October 1930), (b) paid small allowances to 8 Government employees, the majority of whom were whole-time personal servants. Further enquiries showed that an additional 4 men (the majority part-time) were used by Captain Walker as personal servants, but received no allowances. One of these began to receive an allowance on 1st March 1931. This retinue of 13 personal retainers cost Captain Walker Rs. 60 p.m. All these men were discharged or returned to the ranks shortly after Captain Walker’s depar ture, thus showing that their employment was not necessary for the Levy Corps itself. 4. I next questioned the Subedar Major with a view to confirming the particulars given in the preceding paragraph. He said that on taking up his command Captain Walker brought with him one personal servant, but on returning from leave in-1930, he did not bring this man back ; in his place he engaged an extra follower. (This man was paid from Government funds though no budget piovision existed.) The Subedar Major added that on first arrival Captain Walker expressed astonishment at the number of Government employees, sepoys and followers, used by his predecessor as personal servants, and gave instructions that the number was to be cut down. When some time later the Subedar Major asked whether the reduction should be made from the sepoys or from the followers, he was told to let matters be. 5. During recent years the number of men employed in the Muscat Infantry as the Com mandant’s personal servants appears gradually to have increased. O e Commandant takes over the men employed by his predecessor and adds to the number; his successor takes ov&amp;r the increased number and in h s turn adds them. The extent to which Captain Wa:kers staff of servants is justified by precedent thus requires careful examination. The sepoys and followers in Captain Walker’s employ can be divided into three categories : — (а) Those whose employment has the san - tion of an unquestioned precedent. For example, every officer in the British and Indian Armies has the use of an orderly or soldier servant. Though Captain Walker’s contract does not specify the use of a free orderly, it would be unreason ible, in the face of so well-established a precedent, to withhold this customary privilege. (б) Those already employed by Captain Walker’s predecessor. (c) Those taken on as personal servants by Captain Walker himsdf, -. e., those for whose employment no precedent exists. In Captain Walker’s case these are : 1928 2 punkha coolies. 1929 1 boatman for private launch. 1930 a third punkha coolie. The term punkha co.die is a misnomer. In Muscat a punkha coolie can be obtained for Rs. 7 p.m. and is normally engaged for six months in the year. Capt in Walker’s punkha coolies were in reality household servants and were engaged for 12 months in the year, 2 being paid at Rs. 15 p.m. pfors rations, and one at Rs. 10 p.m. plus rations. Categories (a) and (c) need no further discus r sion. tinder (a) the precedent is accepted ; unde (c) no prec-dent exists. Citegory(6) comprising 6 or 7 servants, requires fuller examination. 6. The first question to det rmine is whether Captain Walker, in following his predecessor's precedent, acted in good faith or not. In matters of this nature there exists another and far more firmly established precedent to the effect that Government servants, if benefiting personally from any precedent, should refer the question to higher authority in the event of there being any element of doubt as to its validity. Captain Walker does not appear to have followed this last precedent. His failure to do so is an indi cation that he was acting in bad faith, or else was supremely confident that he was entitled to so large a number of personal servants. But his subsequent actions belie this confidence. Captain Walker’s retinue of servants included two L./Naiks, one his personal Orderly and the other his cook. A man acting in good faith has nothing to hide; if acting in bad faith he has resort to concealment and subterfuge. This attitude is reflected in both its aspects inrs Appendix D a tache 1 to Captain Walker s No. 4 February 1st, address d to the Political Agent, Muscat. APPENDIX D. ** Duties of N. C. 0. establishment as sub mitted. 2 Havildar Majors Pi. Commanders. ***** ***** 16 L./N iks 1(8 Section Commanders, 5 for duty, Muscat, 1 bugler, 1 C. O^ orderly and 1 i/c sjda factory and Canteen).” The use of a L./Naik as F e Commandant s Orderly is opetdy admitted. The employment of the second L /Naik as a cook is concealed, although the man had actea in this capacity for over 21 years and continued to do so until Captain Walker’s departure in the following April. Nor is the above an isol ited example. Daring my first six weeks in Muscat I went through the list of followers with Captain Walker time and ag )in, in the hope of reducing their, as it appear- e 1 to me, excessive numbers. I was met by •evasion, even misrepr. sentation. I wu,s led to believe that every man was essential for the military e lieiency, morale, prestige or esprit de corps of the force. Never once was there any admission that one or moie of these followers was a whole-time personal servant of Captain Walker. 7. (a) In retaining these category (b) men as his servants, Captain Walker seems not only to have acted in bad faith but contrary aho to his instructions, in 1928 he was asked by the Government of Muscat to reduce to the utmost expenditure on the Levy. In submitting his budget for 1929 Captain Walker states (his No. 269 of 20th December 1928), “ The question of e onomy has been seriously gone into and I submit the present budget as the irreducible minimum”. As far as the followers were concerned (exclud ing syces and camel men), this irreducible mini mum was reached by discharging 3 jaroowalas and engaging two punkhawallahs (used as private servants), a net decrease of 1 follower. (6) In January 1931, in answer to my pleiis for retrenchment, Captain Walker stated in his No. 3 of 23rd January 1931 :— (1) The Levy is down to absolute bedrock in economies. (2) The Levy cannot make further sacrifices if it is to remain worthy of the name. At the time these statements were made, his budget requirements for 1931 were Rs. 2,519 in excess of the previous year’s exp nditurc and the Cover iment employees in his service numbered 12. (c) On February 16fh, 1931, the Hon’ble the Political Rasid.nc informed Captain Walker that, owing to the financial po ition of the State of Muscat, the budg t of Rs. 1,54,000 which he ha-4 prevnusly sinationed was to be dropped, and that in its place Captain Walke r was to submit a t u !get bhowing a saving of approximately Ps. 11,000 on the previous year’s expenditure. In this budget the only snciifice among his personal retain ts Captain Walker was prep ired to make on behalf of the bankrupt Government which paid him Was to discharge his third punkha coolie on Rs. 10 p.m and slightly to reduce the pay of thj remainder. 8. During Mr. Thomas’ leave in England, Captain Walker officiated for 8 months as Finan cial Adviser, drawing an extra duty allowance of Rs. 300 p.m. With his intimate knowledge of the interior economy of the Levy, Captain Walker was in a far better position than Mr. Thomas to reduce the amount the State was spending on many minor extravagances not to be found in the Indian Army. He failed, how ever, to take any such action. 9. It will be observed from the preceding paragiaphs that; (а) Though Captain Walker felt so doubtful of the validity of the precedent which he was fol owing that he was obliged to resort to evasion and con cealment, he did not ask for a ruling from higher authority in the matter of his p. rsonal retainers. (б) By neglecting to carry out his instruc tions to efi.ct rigid economies in the Levy, Captain Walker failed in his duties as Commandant. (c) By allowing the continuance of unjusti fiable expenditure in the Levy force. Captain Walker failed in his duty as officiating Financial Adviser. In the light of the above it would seem that Captain Walker’s retention of the Government employees used as personal servants by his predecessor cannot be j ustified. I consider that, after he has been allowed a free orderly, free bhi.sti and free jaroowala. Captain Walker is liable to refund the cost of the other men used by him as personal retainers. Tnis sum amounts to Rs. 7,657. For full details see Appendix A. 10. Further particulars will follow in a few days, namely:— Part II. New Charges which, if regarded as proved, will show that Captain Walker is liable to the refund of a further Rs. 5,000 (approximately). Part III. Leave Passages, which will show that Mrs. Stephens’ passage quoted by Captain Walker was taken when Captain Stephens was rejoining his unit and can hardlv be regarded as a precedent for Mrs. Walker’s two leave passages.4 Demi-official letter from Mr. S. E. Hedgcook, Muscat, to the Poll. Agent, Muscat, No. S.- 5/8, dated the 5th August 1931. I give below Par.- II and PirtllTof my in vestigations into the alleg d fi.uncial irrtgula- ritics on the part of the Lite Commandant of the Muscat infantry. Part II.—New Charges. 1. As mentioned in paragraph 3 of Part I, Captain Walter's aver-ge monthly cost of living works out at Rs. 295. It seems unlikely that this figure will be appreciably exceeded on ac count of cheques drawn di ect up on his bankers. Most cf the articles imported w. re paid for on the V.-P. P. sy,^tem and thise charges were passed through his accounts here; the lists of articles imported by the B. f. steam rs show very few packages for Captain Walker. It may reasonably be assumed that his average living expenses did not exceed Rs. 350 per mensem. The smallness of this figure is in part f xplaim d by the f ict that the Muscat Treasury met the cost of the following :—Kerosene and snowflake oil for household use ; flour for household use , petrol for private launch ; postage stamps and commission on money orders ; khaki shorts ; dogs food ; periodicals (paid for from Sports Fund) etc. No individual item is very large, but the aggr-gfite amounts to Rs. 1,791. Puller det tils are given in Appendix B. In some cases (e.g., flour, commission on money ‘ orders) proof that these items w re paid from Government Fuads is furnished by the accounts ; in other cases by oral evidence. It is only fair to Captain Walk'r to add that Captain Stephens was responsible for originat ing many of the above practices. How far Captain Walker was justifi d in following the doubtful precedents set up by his immediate predecessor is discutseu in paragraphs 6—9 of Fart I. 2. Pay of Commandant.—An extract from the Deputy A-ssistant Controller of Military Ac counts, Peshawar’s No. 1/14/04/PC/26263 of 19th October 1928 to the Political Agent, Muscat, reads as under : — “ It wa* decided und-r Foreign and Political Department letter No. D- 1274/A/2S, dated 19th May 1928, that the officer in question (Captain A. R. Walker) w ill receive pay of rank, viz., Rs. 750 /j/ws Rs. 400 staff piy while employ 'd Commandant, Muscat Lew Corps. ” J During his first month of command (May 1928) Captain Walker c rew hi &gt; pay at the above rate (namely at R^. 1,150 p r mensem), his pre decessor drew Rs. 1,160 per mensem. From 1st June 1928 to 30th November 1928 he drew Rs. 1.225 p r mensem «nd thereafter Rs. 1.255 per mensem, besides recovering a refund of Rs. 30 per mensem fr.r the peiiod 1st June 1928 to 30th November 1928. From the available records it appears that Captain Wall er drew this additional sum 0 f Rs. 105 per m ns.m without obtaining Hie authority of the Muscat Council of State or of tiie Foreign and Political Department. 3. This increase in pay can partly be ex plained by the fact that Captain Walker elected, with effect fi' -m 1st June 1928, to take the new Indian Army rates of pay which were :— Pay of Rank. I. A. allowance. Marriage allowance. l odging j allowance. 655 100 100 70 Inconsequence of this decision the interpre tation to be put upon clause (1) of his contract— Pay of rank plus Rs. 400 staff pay—becomes open to doubt. It could, for instance, be in terpreted to mean pay of rank only (Rs. 055), exclusive of allowances. It could, on the other hand, be interpret 'd to mean pay of rank (Rs. 655) plus all allowances, including (as Captain Walker attempt 'd to include until his claim w'as n jected by the Military Accounts Authorities) lodging allowance, although a free furnished castle is put at tiie Commandant’s disposal. In order to settle what he was entitled to draw, Captain Walker entered into correspond ence with the Controller of Military Accounts, Quetta (copies of this correspon lence are given in Appendix E). This officer stated :—• (а) That if Captain Walker remained on the old rates of pay he would bo entitled to Rs. 750 plus Rs. 400, but . would not be entitled to the I. A. allowance of Rs. 100 per mensem (this being presumably regarded a; included in the Rs. 400). (б) That under the revised rates, Captain Walker would be entitled to Rs. 655 pay of rank, Rs. Iu0 1. A. Allowance and Rs. 100 marriage allowance, but not lodsring allowance ; he expressed a doubt whither, in addition to the revised rates, Cxptain Walker would be allowed to retain the whole of tho Rs. 400. The Indian Army Allowance is granted, I understand, on account of the climate and other dis id vantages of living in India. Jh© Muscat allowance of Rs. 400 is partly made up of command pay and partly of an allowance for the rigours of the climate. To draw the I. A. Al lowance of Rs. 100 per mensem and the full Rs. 400 per menstm would be to draw, as it were, two allowances for one climate. Captain Walker himself seems to have been doubtful at first whether he could draw the I. A. Al lowance in addition to the Rs. 400 per mensem for during his first six he drew Rs. 1,225 made up of pay of rank (655), marriage allowance (100), Muscat allowance (400) and lodging allowance (70)=Rs. 1,225. But after being informed by the Controller of Military Accounts that he was not entitled to draw the lodging alio ranee of Rs. 70 per5 menaem, Captain Walker drew instead the I. A‘ Allowance of Rs. 100, his pay thus becoming Rs 1,255 [pay of rank (655) marri tge allowance (100), I. A. Allowance (100), Muscat allowance (400)]. 4. Knough has b'vm said to show that the rate of pay Captain W dker was entitled to draw was open to doubt. In the circumstances his course of action was ch ar: he should have referred this matter of his own pay to higher au 1 hority—particularly in view of the Military Controller’s doubts a^ to whether he would be entitled to retain the full Rs. 400, in addition to the revised rates. Actually Captain Walker fixed his own rate of pay at Rs. 105 per men sem higher than the figure he had been en gaged at, without any reference to the foreign and Pol tical Department or to the Muscat Council of State. Unless sanction to draw the higher rate is given, I consider that Captain Walker is liable to refund the excess pay drawn, viz., Rs. 3,650. 5. Commandant’s subscription to the Indian Military Widows’ and Orphans’ Fund. Captain Walker’s Last Pay Certificate (7th M iy 1928) shows that this contribution is chargeable against the officer himself. During his period of command Captain Walker debited this amount against State Funds. The sum recoverable is Rs. 24-7-0 per mensem by 35 month8=Rs. 855 Part III.—Leave Passages. 6 In Appendix C will be found certified true extracts from the Levy Accounts giving de tails of the two leave passages taken by Mrs. Walker. Such leave passages are not included in Captain Walker’s contract—a copy of which is given in Appendix D. To my objection that a leave passage for his wife was irregular, Captain Walker replied that his predecessor had charged to the State not only sea passages from M iseat to Karachi for his wife and three children, but also their train fares from Karachi to Kotdwara. A search through the accounts confirms Captain Walker’s state m ent, but shows that the passages referred to above were taken in May 1928, i.e., the month in which Captain Stephens rejoined his unit. A passage of this nature can hardly be quoted as a precedent for Mrs. Walker’s two leave passages. Mrs. Stephens took a State-paid passage from Muscat to Karachi in 1927, but as Captain Walker did not quote this as a precedent, he was presumably ignorant of the fact- In any case Captain Stephens may have had special authority for this passage (he was very popular with the Sultan). On his owm admission, Captain Walker has no such authority. On the whole it would appear that no reliable precedent exists for Captain Walker’s action in taking leave passages for his wife and servant. 7. The last point to consider is whether the m o asure of control exercised by the Ministry of Finance over the financial administration of the Muscat Infantry in any way extenuates Captain Walker’s action^. For the last six years (and probably longer) no audit objections have been raised against the accounts of the Muscat Infantry. This means that the Commandant has had almost a free han 1 in the financial administration of his force. Such a position carries with it both greater advantages and greater responsibilities : the Commandant must be more not lees care ful of the expenditure of public monies. In other words, the auditing of the Levy accounts is left to the Commandant. Under such a system the Ministry of Finance must perhaps antici pate and tolerate a growing extravagance in the administration of the force, but with a British officer in command it can reasonably expect that any such extravagances will not include large unauthorised payments on the Commandant’s personal behalf. If such pay ments are made they can only be justified if based upon an undoubted precedent : if the slightest doubt exists the recognized practice among Government servants is not personally to benefit from public money without the prior sanction of higher authority. In Captain Walker’s case, there were obvious instances (e g , his pay) where he should have sought the rulings of higher authority, and others where he elected to follow doubtful precedents—a course which led him to evasion and misrepresentation. For bis own acts it would seem that Captain Walker and no other person, should be held responsible. 8. Should the Council of State decide, wdlh the concurrence of the Government of India, to claim from Captain Walker a refund of the monies wrongfully charged to the State, the following sums would appear to be due from him :— its. Personal servants 7,657 See Appendix A. Miscellaneous Privileges 1,791 Sea Appendix B. Excess pay 3,6£0 See paragraph 4, Part II. I. M. W. O. Contribu tions. 855 See paragraph 5, Part II.

(i) Pay. —Rates of pay have been taken from the Acquittance Rolls. Period of service. —Dates have been taken from the Acquittance Roll. When a man has served Captain Walker throughout his period of command, a period of 35 months has been taken as the basis of calculation (Captain Walker assumed command on 17th May 1928 and handed over on 23rd April 1931).Rations. —In 1928 the daily ration was 2 Lbs. atta. From the beginning of 1929 it was reduced to H Lbs Followers ceased to draw rations from 1st April 1931. In 1928 the value of the ration was estimated at Rs. 7-8-0 per mensem per man. Owing to falling prices the value of the ration in April 1931, was Rs. 2-8-0 per mensem. Calculations have been based on an average ration value of Rs. 4 per mensem. Allowances. —No account has been taken of leave passages, clothing, etc. Against tins must be set the fact that no deduction has been made on account of non-issue of rations during leave. (ii) Should the Council of State decide to claim a refund of sums spent on per sonal servants and debited to the Muscat Treasury, the following sums would appear to be due from Captain Walker:— i.

The dhobi’s official duties were — (а) to shrink khaki drill to be made up by the tailor into uniforms. A tub has now been brought for the tailor who does his own shrinking. (б) to wash the clothing of discharged or sick men. According to Subedar Major, many months go by without any washing under this head. Such washing can b' 4 , and is now being done locally at Matrah at an average cost of less than Rs. 3 p.m- In addition to his official duties the dhobi washed the clothes of Captain Walker, and the 3 I. Os. who each paid him Re. 1 p.m. In view of the above it seems clear that the dhobi was retained primarily for Captain Walker’s ben fit. His cost less the Rs. 3 p.m. mentioned above thus seems a fair charge agaimt Captain Walker. Amount recoverable :—Rs. 1,081. (ix) Name, Abdul Rehman, official designa tion, Jharoowala.

Remarks :—Prior to 1927 only one sweeper was employed. Since Captain Walker’s departure the two Indian sweepers on Rs. 30 p.m. and rations Lave been discharged and a local man on Rs. 15 p.m. net engaged in their place. I was led by Captain Walker to believe that ’hese two sweepers were essential for the Levy force. My suggestion that an e.conomy would be effected if the s poys used a trench, which would be gradually filled in by earth, was r, jected as being highly unsuitable for a standing camp. r J he existing arrangement, the Subedar- Major now informs me, is for the sepoys to have the unrestricted use outside the lines of the des rt for depositing their excreta. The only official duties performed bj' the two svveepers is to remove the night bucket and to attend to sick men in the lines. For this purpose one sweep r would be, and used to be, ample. The two sweepers on the strength spent the greater part of their time in attending the quavers of the Commandant and the 3 I. Os. I consider that the retention of tne second sweeper was primarily for the con venience of Captain Walker and that he is liable to meet his pay. Amount recoverable Rs. 1,182.

On the loiry being purchased the boat was given up and the crew dismissed, except for Mahomed Abdulla. He was retained and put in charge of Captain Walker’s private launch, waich also arrived about this time. Though it is claimed that this man was at times employed on the road; I consider that he would almost certainly have been discharged with the rest of the crew had not Captain Walker purchased his private Lunch. In the circumstances, 1 considt r this man’s pay is a proper charge against Captain Walker. Amount recoverable Rs. 690.

From the Controller of Military Accounts, Quetta, to Captain A. R. Walker, Muscat, No. 0/51/3840, dated the 10th September 1928. Reference your demi-officigl dated 18th September 1928, to Colonel Wylde. As the full term of your appointment are not known in this office I cannot say definitely what rates of pay you will be entitled to. However the follwing information may help you :— (а) If you remain on the old rates of pay you will probably be entitled to pay of rank Rs. 750 plus Rs. 400. The Indian Army allowance of Rs. 100 will not be admissible in addition. (б) If you elect the revised rates of pay you will draw Rs. 655 pay of rank, Rs. 1001. A. allowance Rs. 100 marriage allowance ; presumably lodging allowance will not be admissible because you have been provided with free quarters. It is not known what portion of Rs. 400 will be allowed to you in addition to the revis ed rates. As you will be in the payment and audit area of the A. G. C. R., Delhi, I suggest you ask that officer. If you think we can help you furth e r please do not hesitate to write again. From Captain A R. Walker, to Controller of Military Accounts, No. 228 of 1928, dated the 24th October 1928. Reference your No. 0/5113840 of 1st October 1928. I am very much obliged to you for your assist ance regarding my rates of pay. As the channels of correspondence with Ac countant General, Central Revenues, Delhi, are very slow I am forwarding you a copy of the terms of agreement with the Muscat State for your opinions thereon. As regards paragraph 3, I presume that I will not be cut for quarters and will draw the allowance. Should there be any question raised by Muscat State I will in future write direct to A. G. C. R., Delhi. With many thanks for your assistance. From the Controller of Military Accounts, Quetta, to Captain A. R. Walker, Muscat, No. 0/51/4516, dated 9th November 1928. Reference your No. 228 of 1928. From item (1) of the term of your agreement with the Muscat State copy of which has been received with your memo, under reference it appears that you will be entitled to pay of rank at the old rates, viz., Rs. 750 plus Rs. 400 p.m. staff pay. With these rates you will not be required to pay rent for the quarters occupied by you. 2. Should you elect to draw the new rates of pay I should say that you will not be entitled to lodging allowance because in the revised scale this item is separate from pay proper (of rank) and is to be drawn only when free quarters cannot be provided, i.e., I interpret your agreement as continuing to you your ordinary rights (as regards quarters) of an I. A. officer. But this is a question for A. G. C. R. to decide. Footnote by Captain A. R. Walker to head clerk, Muscat Levy. Barkatullah. Please arrange to draw difference of pay between old and new rates, i.e., new pay at Rs. 1,255 from 1st June 1928.Demi-ofucial letter from the Political PesI DENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF, No. 560-S., DATED the 31st August 1931. In continuation of my demi-official letter ^No. 521-S. of 21st August 1931, paragraph 8 I forward herewith a copy of the new charges which fledgcock has brought against Walk&gt;r, with Appendices B, D and E, and some general remarks by Hedgcock on the question of the control exercised by the Ministry of Finance over the financial administration of the Muscat Infanlry and an estimate of the total claim by the State against Walker. 2. The new charges can be divided into three .categories :— (a) That Walker drew a higher rate of pay from the State than he should have; (b) That he charged the State with his con tributions on account of the Indian Military Widows and Orphans’ fund; (c) That he charged the State with various miscellaneous items, which he used for private consumption. 3. With reference to (a). —By his contract Walker was entitled as Commandant of the Muscat Levy to “ Pay of Rank plus Rs. 400 Staff pay At the time he took up the appoint ment of Commandant he was on the old rate of pay Rs. 750, which with Rs. 400 gave him Rs. 1,150 per mensem. On the 1st June 1928 he elected to come on the new rates :— Pav of Indian Army Marriage Lodging Rank. Allowance. Allowance. Allowance. Rs. Rs. Rs. Be. 655 100 100 70-925 4. His contract reads : Pay of Rank plus Rs. 400, which—by strict interpretation—on the new rates would have given him Rs. 650 + Rs. 400= Rs. 1,050, but this would have been Rs. 100 less than the State was paying him before, and it is obvious that whatever the changes made in his Indian Army pay, etc., the State should not pay him less than what he contracted for, i.e., Rs. 1,150. 5. Walker applied to the Controller of Military Accounts, Quetta, for a ruling as to how much he should draw on the new rates. The Controller of Military Accounts replied (Appendix E) that— in his opinion—Walker would be entitled to draw pay of rank plus Indian Army allowance and Marriage allowances, but not Lodging allowance as free quarters were provided. The Controller of Military Accounts added he did not know what portion of the Rs. 400 Staff pay would be allowed, and that the Accountant-General, Central Re venues, was the proper authority to decide this question. 6. From 1st June 1928 up to the date on which he relinquished his post of Commandant, ac cording to Hedgcock’s statement (paragraph 3), Walker drew for the first six months : Pay of Rank (Rs. 655), Military allowance (Rs. 100), Lodging allowance (Rs. 70) and Staff pay (Rs. 400) ^=Rs. 1,225. Then, after being informed by the Controller of Military Accounts that he was not entitled to Lodging allowance Walker, according to Hedgcock, dropped the Lodging allowance of Rs. 70 and substituted the Indian Army one of Rs. 100, thus drawing Rs. 1,255. It may be pointed out that Walker had the opinion of the Controller of Military Accounts that he could draw the Indian Army allowance (paragraph 4 above). 7. What rate of pay Walker should have drawn over the period in question, i.e., from 1st June 1928 to April 1931 when he gave up his command is really a matter on which the opinion of an Accounts Officer is required. I can only make the following comments. -On the one hand it may be argued that Walker having been engaged on a contract of Rs. 1,150 should not draw more from the State—no change in his rank having taken place—during his period of service. On the other hand, however, should he be debarred from the benefit of an increase of pay and allowances given him by the Indian Government while he was in State service, even though the payment of this addition meant naturally more expense to the State ? Supposing Walker had been in the service of an Indian State, in Imperial Service Troops for instance, and had elected to come on the new Indian Army rates, what pay and allowances would he have been allowed to draw in addition to his Staff pay ? I think the question might be decided on these lines, for which there must be precedent and rulings. 8. With regard to (6).—I can only suggest that Walker be asked for an explanation. 9. With regard to (c).—These charges should be cleared up, in my opinion, and Alban could carry out the necessary investigation. He has already in a demi-official letter to me, stated “ Part 11 (of Hedgcock’s report) deals with miscellaneous items charged to the State by Captain Walker, the correctness of each one of these is supported either by an entry in Captain Walker’s private account, in the monthly lists of expenditure submitted by the Levy Corps or by the statement of the Subedar Major. The entries have been shown to me by Mr. Hedgcock and there is no doubt that Captain Walker did enjoy free kerosine oil and the best quality of flour for his own private use. Postage stamps and commission on money orders were paid for by the State, had he wished to have his pay remitted to India he could have had cheques on Bombay from the Muscat State Treasury, this would not have cost either Captain Walker or the State anything ”. But I do not think this opinion can take the place of a detailed investigation. This would not entail Hedgcock staying on at Muscat, as all the proof, etc., is there in documentary form.

I was also, at the time of receipt of Wylie’s letter, under the impression that notice to go had already been given by the Council to Hedgcock, vide paragraph S of my letter No. 448-S. of 20th July 1931. I do not think personally that the omission to inform the Council of abeyance until about 3 weeks ago, vide paragraph 2 of my telegram* No. 468 affects the situation materially. If however it has further complicated a situa tion already sufficiently complicated I can only express my regrets, and say that the sponsibility is mine as I should have drawn Alban' ^ attention to the point.

Question as to date from which Hedgcock’s notice begins to run if Muscat Council have decid ed not to retain his services, cannot be determined until receipt of full copy of letter men tioned in your telegram of 29th August, No. 471 and any other relevant ^correspondence. Please expedite despatch. Demi-offtciaE letter from Major T. C. W- Fowle, C.R.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 527-S., dated the 24th August 1931. With reference to correspondence ending with Vour telegram No. 2072-S. of 18th August 1931 I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter No. C.-183 of 15th August 1931, which I have just received from Alban. 2.1 am afraid that Alban is a little temperamental in his views. His letter No. C.-156 of 8th July 1931 was very strongly expressed, not only in the extract—paragraphs 18 and 20—wffiich I sent you under my D. 0. No. 445-S. of 20th Julyl931 but— as far as it concerned Hedgcock and the post of Financial Adviser generally—in its whole tone, as will be seen from paragraphs 15—23 of the com plete copy which I now send you. Alban now makes a volte face and states that, as far as he is concerned, he sees no reason why Hedgcock should not stay on ! 3. Nothing that Alban says, of course, alters the fact that Hedgcock persisted in giving full vent to his subversive ideas as to the State being oppressed by the Government of India, which was the reason that his dismissal by the former was asked for by the latter, and I do not think his present repentance, which seems to be of the death-bed variety, alters the situation to any material extent. My own views are that Hedg cock should go, and I need not elaborate them further. 4. With regard to Alban’s suggestion that Hedg cock’s experience would be valuable to the State in case of Saiyid Said’s illness or “ anything If Hedgcock goes, either another Financial Adviser can be obtained, or as a temporary measure to cover the next year or so, while we see how things are going, it might be possible for Alban to act as Financial Adviser and Commandant of the Levies as suggested by Colonel Biscoe in his despatch No. 202-S. of 22nd April 1931 (paragraph 15). Or if neither of these alternatives is considered practicable, Saiyid Said might be left to run the finances of the State under some system of auditory control. It may be remarked that he—Saiyid Said—has now got a good Accountant General in Rai Sahib Dhuli Chand from ‘Iraq, who was recently made a Rai Sahib by the Government of India. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter, with a copy of Albaji’s letter, to Colonel Biscoe and to Alban. Demi-official letter from the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. C.-183, dated the 15th August 1931. With reference to my letter No. C.-156, dated 8th July, about Hedgcock, I would like you to know how things are at present. To begin with, I would like to make it clear, that all I have said about him in my former despatches and D. Os. is true, the facts have neither been exaggerated nor bt httled. What I strongly objected to, and would still object is if he did it again, was his attitude towards Government and his idea that he was championing an oppressed State. Since his return, however, three weeks ago, he has quite changed all that and spares no pains both to do his work (at present investigation of the Levy accounts) and to show that his former ideas a 1 out the State being oppressed have been given up. Under these circumstances, and if he conti nues like this in future, there is no reason why he should not stay on. His experience would be valuable to the State and in case of Saiyid Said’s sickness or anything, there should be someone to keep things going. In any case now that he regrets what he has done and has learnt his lesson, I, for one, have nothing more against him and, if he carries on in future as he is at present there will be no more complaints against h im It was my duty to bring up everything against him, so that Government may know exactly what they are doing and if in future there should be any more trouble over Hedgcock then it will not be possible for anyone to contend that his former actions were not reported. Saiyid Said, this morning, said that the Council are inditferent, they have no official relations with Hedgcock and they don t mind if he remains here, and if he is to be reinstated or his resignation to be cancelled, then, they want official intimation to this effect before he can work for the State. As I have brought to notice all that Hedgcock has done or said which I considered wrong and as some extracts from my letters have been forwarded to the Government of India, I hope that a copy of this letter may also be forwarded to them so that all the weight of judgment may not be against him Letter from the Political Agent, Muscat, TO THE Hon’bLE THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. C.-156, dated the 8th July 1931. I have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that as a result of certain messages which have, recently, been coming through from the late Financial Adviser addressed to the Heir Apparent and myself , it seems that there is some movement afoot which has as its object the re engagement of Mr. Hedgcock’s services by the As to whether or not this is so I cannot sav but, having in view the possibility that such an action may be embarked on in the near future2 it is as well that the following facts should b e brought to the noti e of the Government of India. 2. When Major Haworth was Political Agent at Muscat he found that, owing to the complete lack of any business instinct of the present Sultan, Saiyid Taimur, and the very primitive adminis trative arrangements in all departments, the State had drifted deep into debt. The Customs department was in the hands of a Bannia and the Sultan was in the habit of signing “ chits ” for any sums of money he happened to require, the amounts on these chits being entered up against his name in the Bannia’s books and de ducted from the amounts collected by the Bannia on account of customs dues. 3. As might have been expected, partly owing to the reckless and unchecked extravagance of the Sultan and partly to fraud and lax collection on the part of the customs farmers, the expendi ture always exceeded the revenue. 4. It was at this stage, in 1919, that the Gov ernment of India! stepped in with the ofrer of financial assistance to pay off the Sultan’s debts. In return for this the Sultan was to reform his administration and to assist him in this a Euro pean Adviser was engaged. 5. The prime reason for engaging and retaining the services of this official was to supervise the working of the reforms mentioned above, control expenditure and watch the collection of revenue by the customs. Of the Sultan, Major Haworth wrote in 1919&gt; “ he is weak in many ways, though not in all, while in any case he is totally ignorant ”. 6. Under these circumstances, with the State finances in complete chaos, so complete that no accounts of revenue or expenditure were in existence other than those contained in the Bannia’s private account books, with the Sultan hopelessley at sea and quite unfitted to clear up the situation and set up a proper Treasury and Customs Administration with a regular system of accounting, there was no other course left open than reluctantly to engage a European Adviser until such time as the State could stand upon its own feet. 7. This desirable result would obviously come about eith:r (a) by the Sultan himself developing a keenness and aptitude for affairs of State, or (6) by his producing a son with these qualities. It would also be mccssary to employ sufficiently capable and trustworthy heads of departments to enable the machine to function with only the minimum of supervision. 8. After a lapse of twelve years during which the State has been completely run by British Ad\ isers, nominally working through a body called the Council of Ministers, the Sultan has produced a son, Saiyid Said, who while possessing all the dignity of his father has all the qualities which he lacks. 9. At the end of 1930 Mr. Thomas, the last Adviser, completed his term of five years with the State and left. At the same time, the services of a new Adviser, Mr. Hedgcock, were engaged, but,' after a few months employment in the State, his services were, for sound reasons, dispensed with. 10. In the meantime, Saiyid Said, the Heir Apparent, has suddenly come forward. He is row 21, has had a first class education at the Chiefs College, Ajmtr, and has also completed a finishing course at Baghdad. He takes a very deep interest in the State and is unhappy when out of it, he is careful over money matters, has a complete grasp of the details of the State budget and finance, his justice and the swiftness with which he meles out retribution to offenders are a byword throughout the country. His energy and courage are well known, it is only a few montha since he sallied forth with a handful of men and displaced his uncle, the Wali of Sahar, who for many years has been notorious for his brutality and tyranny and was by way of becoming a independent ruler. Now, again, he is off to Sur to study the situation there with a view to making a lasting settlement of what has, in the past been, a rather disturbed area. 11. These qualities, combined with a dignified demeanour a proper respect for his father the Sultan, and a fixed determination to continue unabated the long friendship existing between the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and the British and Indian Governments, have earned for him the deepest respect and loyalty of his subjects and make him an eminently suitable person to be entrusted with the full control of all the affairs of the State. 12. The day, for which the British Government has waited twelve years, has now arrived and the complete administration of the State is now in the hands of the Heir Apparent. Yesterday, after years of deficit budgets under a British Adviser during which the State has con tracted some three lacs of debts, Saiyid Said entirely unaided and alone, produced his first budget. 13. Notwithstanding the fact that six months of the year 1931 have already passed and that only on the second six months can the revised budget take effect, yet, so effective are the eco nomies made and so carefully has each item been checked that the expenditure for the whole year 1931 will be substantially less than the revenue, and, alter paying the usual instalment of the Government of India debt, a surplus will remain with which to commence repayment of the debts mentioned above. 14. This, I may mention, is quite unprecedent ed, no member of the ruling family has ever been able or had any desire to cope with finance, and it is fair to say that although most of the eco nomies were talked over with and outlined by Mr. Hedgcock before he left Muscat nearly a month ago, yet Saiyid Said has, the Treasury Officer tells me, himself been carefully through every item of expenditure of the State and made all cuts and reductions himself. As regards the Levy Corps, Saiyid Said has himself had many consultations with the Officer Commanding and the result is a budget consider ably less than that drawn up by Mr. Hedgcock and yet ample for meeting all the requirements of the force as it stands. 15. The foregoing outline of events and de scription of the situation have been given for the information of the Government of India, who, involved in other affairs and far removed from the scene of these happenings must be in ignorance of the true state of affairs. I hat the period of interregnum has now com© to an end is clear and no further reason exists for placing a Government nominee in control of3 G1PD-L 427(c) F&amp;PD-2-12-31-10 the finance and thus of the whole State, for the finances and the administration of the State are bound up together. 16. The placing of a British official in such a position in a small State like Muscat, experience teaches us, is bound to lead to a gradual absorp- ^'Sn by him of all the functions of the Ruler and this particular moment it would, in addition, lead to the stultification and atrophy of those very powers of rule and administration which are begun ing to show so clearly in the Heir Apparent, and which the Government of India desires above all things to foster. The tendency to leave more and more things to be done by the Adviser is bound to appear and unless the prospective Ruler himself controls the finances he is scarcely to be expected to gain that control of the adminis trative departments of the State which is so essen tial. 17. The subject of the late Adviser and the reasons why his services were dispensed with by the State, are now, in view of the length of time which has elapsed and the impossibility of the State having any further use for his services, somewhat academical. In view, however, of the possibility of some encouragement having been given him, on his wanderings, to hope for re employment in the State, it is as well to note again that the reasons for having advised the State to dispense with his services were, that he had taken up an attitude which conveyed that the Government of India were not seeking the best interests of the State and that he had em bodied those sentiments in his letter to the Council prefering his resignation. 18. What is infinitely worse, however, is, that up to the moment of leaving here to express his regret to the Government of India for these past misdeeds and to request that they be over looked, he lost no opportunity of filling my ears with reports of the resentment felt by Saiyid Said and other members of the royal family at the interfering policy of the Government of India and their suspicion that the sole object of the aforesaid Government was to force the State into bankruptcy and then by means of another loan to bring it more completely under its thumb. 19. To imagine that there can be any thought of the re-engagement of a person who goes about soliciting such views or encouraging by a sym pathetic demeanour the expression of sentiments or dropping of hints tending to bring into dis credit the Government of India and their re presentatives in the Persian Gulf is to imagine a vain thing. 20. In addition to this, the firm friendship and goodwill, as expressed by the Sultan, the Council and every Arab in the State towards the British Government and the Government of India, renders intolerable the presence of one who seems bent on creating a gulf between the State and the Government of India and who seeks in every chance remark overheard a confirmation of his view that the State has been subject to injustice and oppression at the hands of the aforesaid Government of India. 21. It is needless to recapitulate here th e constant solicitude and anxiety to promote th e best interests of the State which has always been shown by the Government of India, no one is better aware of this than the Sultan and his son, even the poorest Arab or Baluch fisherman thanks God for the “ Daulat ” whose name alone is sufficient to preserve peace and promote pros perity among the people. 22. In any case the State is now free from any European advisory officials, the administration is set and under the full control of Saiyid Said, President of the Council of Ministers, the finances are balanced and in two or three years time outstanding debts will have been paid off. 23. The desire of the Government of India to see the State standing on its own feet as an inde pendent Arab principality is now at last realised and it is highly desirable that no move be made which might tend to discourage in any way those who are now responsible for the administration of the State.

Demi-official letter feom Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, Muscat, dated the 4th September 1931. I don’t know whether a few lines on the position here will bore you or not; if the former you can tear this letter up at once. Relations between Saiyid Said and the P. A. are very friendly—in fact a new-comer would find it impossible to believe that a few months ago they were strained. But it must be remembered that Saiyid Said got what he wanted —solvency and a reasonable control over the finances of his own country. Saiyid Said likes Alban and Alban handles him very well— friendly discussion and friendly suggestion with no hint of the “ de hant en has ” attitude. Revenue continues to fall as and at the rate, forecasted ; on the other hand retrenchment is producing better results than originally antici pated. At the end of the year there will almost certainly be a substantial surplus available for debt redemption. On the whole, the financial situation is satisfactory. I am still officially regarded as a private indi vidual, and am thus debarred from going to my office, but I am content to accept the present position as I imagine Howell wishes to be 100 per cent, certain as regards Walker’s irregularities, etc., before taking action. Also, a suitable “ modus vivendi ” has been evolved. Alban lends me histories of Oman, old administration reports and old files, the reading of which provides a useful background for Muscat’s present day problems ; also I have long private discussions with Saiyid Said on official matters. Neverthe less, I shall be glad to get back to my office, as things there are getting a little out of hand. Saiyid Said has told me privately more than once that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to have me back as his Financial Adviser, but his official attitude (for reasons already in dicated to you) is much more reserved, e.g., “ At the request of the Government of India we have agreed to the termination of Mr. Hedgcock’s services ; if the Government of India now has fresh views we should be glad to hear what they are ”. I had thought that the Levy, though expensive ly administered, was a military asset. Alban now tells me that it has next to no value as a fight ing force as during the last four years road making has almost entirely taken the place of military training, e.g., though the Levy is provided with machine guns only one firing practice has taken place during the last five years, and that was four years ago ! Similar examples could be quoted in respect of company, extended order and musketry training. During the last fortnight Muscat has been trying to show what it can do in the way of maximum temperatures combined with maximum humidity. A strange malario-influenza has also swept over the place. Both Alban and myself succumbed, but are well again. P. S .—After sealing my envelope, I have opened it again as Alban told me privately ten minutes ago a very disquieting item of information He said that he had received a private telegram from Fowle some days ago saying that as I had com pleted my enquiries into Walker’s alleged irre gularities there was now no reason why I should not leave Muscat forthwith. I am at a loss tq understand what it all means.GIED-Il 927(c) F&amp;PD-4-12-31-10, ‘ ? Demi-official letter to Lieutenant-Colonel H. V.

I was sorry to learn from your letter of the 18th of April and also through official channels that you had made up your mind to resign your appointment as Financial Adviser in Muscat. In the circum stances I do not see my way to urging you to reconsider that intention. I trust however that you will forgive me for saying that you appear to have acted in a somewhat precipitate fashion, and I am afraid 1 cannot express other than dis approval of the terms of your letter to the Council of State in which you dilated upon the differences of policy between yourself and the Govt, of India. You were aware that the Govt, of India attached primary importance to putting the Muscat State into a position of solvency and the only question was one of method, which it was obviously for you to thrash out with the local officers and, if full agreement could not be reached locally, to ask to have your views represented through them for deci sion here. I had hoped that ynu would find the Muscat post to your liking and would be able gradually to set the State’s finances in order and at least would be content to bide your time until after matters had been fully talked out locally and the views of the local officers were on record here, to discuss anything left over with me when you came to India on recess. As however you have chosen a different course of action there is no more to be said. I am sorry that you are going and I wish you the best of good fortune.GIPD—L 427(c) F&amp;PD-M2-31- « Demi-official letter from Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, Muscat, dated the 21st May 1931. Your letter of May 9th which was not receiv ed here until May 20th. Had I been an official of the Government of India subordinate to the Political liesident my action could not perhaps have been justified. I think, however, you will agree that I hold a different position: l am, as I see it, a servant of the Government of Muscat responsible for the States’ finances and for giving that Government disinterested financial advice. If, in representing Muscat’s case to the Government of India, I have followed a procedure that has proved un- w r elcome to you, I can only say that I very much regret it. I did my best to conform to the procedure which you suggest I ought to have followed. You mention, for instance, that if full agreement could not be reached locally, I should have asked to have my views represented through the local officers for your decision. This is exactly what I did in my letter No. S.-24/2 of February 24th; as yet I have received no intimation that this has been forwarded to you. I tried to thrash out with the local officer the best method of dealing with Muscat’s bank ruptcy, but was side-tracted to other issues. I explained in detail the finances of this country, but though dispatches on this subject w r ere sent and received by the local officer. I was given no inkling of their contents. In short, there was no local indication that “the Government of India attached primary importance to putting the Muscat State into a position of solvency’’. I am very sorry if to you my action appears precipitate; but to me here there seemed good reasons in the interests of Muscat’s finances to act when I did. In my letter to the Council of State of w’hich you make mention the phrase “Government of India’’ refers, and was under stood by Saiyid Said to refer, only to the local officials. I have always impressed upon him. when he seemed inclined to doubt it, that I was convinced that you yourself fully sympathized with the aims of his Government. On May 18th Saiyid Said sent me through Major Fowle a message asking for a telegraphic reply with regard to the reconsideration of my resignation. As I had done the utmost I could for Muscat by getting the question of its finances referred to you at Simla, I replied that I with draw my resignation. I need hardly add that the past few T months have been ones of acute anxiety to my wife and myself and I would ask you to believe that throughout I have acted as I thought best, not for my own interests, but for those of the Gov ernment I serve. It is a very real grief to me* that my actions have not met with your per sonal approval.GIZPa-L' flB7(c)FAPD—&gt;M2*31—10. Demi-official telegram R., from the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 325, dated 25th Mav 1931. My immediately preceding telegram. Hedg- cock has assumed role of champion of State rights against Government. As long as he remains relations with State will be very difficult. He has informed State that be disapproves policy of Government and this in case of State where circumstances compel us to exercise large measure of interference renders his retention impossible. He has deliberately in his letter to you charged Agency with falsifying (gr. omitted. balances?) and thus prevented any possibility of that col laboration which is essential if things are to go smoothly and Fowle presses for his departure. Finally in view of urgent need for economy it is desirable if suitable officer forthcoming that posts of Financial Adviser and Commandant of Levies should be combined at any rate temporarily and this would have other advantages which I am intimating by air mail. Hedgcock could not be given command of Levies. No contract with State has as yet been (gr. omitted, signed?) but I would recommend grant of three months pay and passages for himself and wife. Ends.427(c) F&amp;PD—l'12*3l—10. Demi-official letter from the Political PiEsi- dent, Bushire, No. 290-S., dated 25th May 1031. Will you please refer to my telegram No. 324 of the 25th May 1931, regarding Hedgcock. I do not think it is necessary to amplify the arguments therein put forward, or to take any notice of the personalities contained in his letter to you. I have long ago come to the conclusion that close and prolonged contract with Arabs induces in many Europeans a wholly abnormal state of mind which is frequently diffi cult to cope with. They seldom seem to be able to look at a matter dispassionately and as an ordinary administrative question, and Hedgcock s references to the levies as “my favourite child and his statement that I said that I.had a soft spot in my heart for the sepoy, etc. , would seem to show that he imagines that in such matters I am ruled rather by the heart than by the head, a failing to which I do not plead guilty. However, I do not think it is necessary to take any further notice of such ridiculous contentions, and the real reason why Hedgcock must go is because, as I stated in my telegram, he has told the State that they are in the right and the Government of India in the wrong, and as long as he remains relations will be impossible. This view naturally finds much favour with Saiyid Said, who while not shaping badly on the whole is still rather a “spoilt child”, and it is always agreeable to be told that one’s troubles are due to other people. As you will see, he has taken the bit between his teeth and insists on going back to Muscat and for the next four months will have, I think, to be in executive charge of the Finances, with Alban advising unofficially. When Hedgcock goes I have no doubt that in practice he will be able to exercise a large measure of control. When I come out again and Fowle in the ordinary course reverts I hope it will be possible to make Alban s services avail able as Financial Adviser. Firstly, he would start with the very great advantage of knowing the people and the country and of having had previous experience in both jobs, feecondl} I think he could combine the posts of Financial Adviser and Commandant of the Levies success fully, though not everyone could do so. This would have the following advantages: it would effect a real economy at a time when it is urgentlv necessary. The Financial Adviser would have a force at his disposal to enforce his orders, to accompany him on tour and to maintain the prestige of the State. Alban tells me that when Thomas first went there he frequently asked the Levy for escorts, etc., but the Officer Command ing,' Levies, often made difficulties on the score of interference with training, etc. When Alban held both posts, on the other hand, he took detachments of the levies with him and found them a very effective means of dealing with indi viduals who were trying to avoid payment of taxes, etc. Again, the levies are undoubtedly a sore point with the 'State authorities and Hedgcock’s recent action is calculated to make them more so. If, however, they saw that the levies were not kept as a purely military force to guard against a possible attack on Muttrah, but were also being employed to maintain the authority of the State and to bring in revenue, I think it would undoubtedly go very far to re concile anyone to their existence and to their cost. Moreover I am most anxious to make these Arab States stand on their own legs as much as possible, and have been urging Saiyid Said to strengthen the Muscat Council, and I think that if the levies were used as suggested above, it would do much to enhance the prestige of the State and strengthen their hands.GIPD—L 427(c) F&amp;PD—1T2-31 —10. Demi-official letter from the Political Resi dent, Busiiire, No. 801-S., dated the 27th May 1931. Foreign and Political Department Express letter No. F.-19-N./31, dated the 15th May 1931, reached me this morning and Fowle .arrived simultaneously, so that I had an opportunity of discussing the whole position at Muscat with him. Now, firstly, the financial situation is ad mittedly bad, though we are not prepared to accept Hedgcock’s estimates as necessarily ab solutely correct. Fowle only succeeded in get ting these out of him with a great deal of diffi culty. On the other hand, there is one thing that we should like to emphasise, namely, that Hedgcock has made a test case of the Levy budget and has attributed to it an importance which it really hardly merits. A cut has been made in the Levy budget of about Rs. 12,000 already. In round figures the reduction in pay was only about Rs. 4,000, the remainder being in the reduction of non-combatant personnel, etc. Now the latter obviously cannot be repeated and even if we make a further cut in the pay of a similar amount to that which we have already made (and I doubt if we can do this without creating a certain amount of dissatisfaction) it would bring in only Rs. 4,000—a comparatively small sum and really only a drop in the ocean as far as fhe general finances of the State are concerned. As regards reduction of establishment, I en tirely agree with the view expressed by Walker that, if the levies are to retain any value at all as a fighting force, the minimum strength should be 150, and this opinion is shared by Fowle and Alban. Once we get below this figure they really lose their entire value. I have arranged with Alban that any men cutting their names during the next four months shall not be replaced and at the end of that period the matter could be re considered and we shall know better how we stand, and it may be possible to replace them by men on a lower rate of salary. This should per mit of some further economy, but I would again state that in my considered opinion it is not ad visable to reduce the levies to below 150. The real cause of the Muscat troubles of course is the fall in commodity prices and the conse quent drop in customs receipts. Hedgcock has so far only attempted to meet this by reduction of expenditure; it is the line of least resistance, but there is another method, and that is, to try and increase the revenue. The first thing is to get tariff autonomy for the State. I see you^ have just sent a telegram home on the subject and 1 will try and hasten this matter when I get to London. The increased tariff should produce a substantial sum. The second means of increas ing revenues is by tighter control of Sohar and Sur. The former province—a wealthy date garden district—remitted to the Central Treasury last year Rs. 1,900—an obviously ridiculous sum. It should produce very much more and Alban is going to see what can be done this year when the dates ripen. Sur should produce something more and Saiyid Said intends to go there himself personally this summer while Alban has suggested having a summer camp for the Levies there, as it has a much better climate than Muscat and a spell of about three or four weeks w r ould probably do the men good; it would also support the authority of Saiyid Said and familiarise the people of Sur with the presence of a Muscat force in their midst. Finally, Fowle thinks that the allow ances of the royal family are capable of consider able cuts wdthout creating any difficulty for the State. Saiyid Said naturally refrained from these somewffiat unpopular measures as long as the question of Hedgcock’s future was undecided, but Fowde discussed the matter with him before leaving Karachi, and he did not think there w'ould be any particular difficulty about the matter. Of the four items I have recapitulated the revised tariff and Sohar should produce sub stantial sums, w r hile Sur and the family allow ances should assist though not to the same ex tent. To sum up: Fowle and I both feel that Hedgcock has given the Levy budget a wholly disproportionate im portance. He has chosen to make it a test case and to fight the battle on this issue. Some fur ther reductions may be possible and the number of men could be reduced temporarily during the summer by not filling the vacancies of men who cut their names and they could probably be ulti mately replaced by men on a low r er rate of pay. but I do not think that the strength of the Levy should be permanently reduced below 150. This however is not the only remedy for the present situation and w r e are of opinion that the revised tariff, tighter control of Sohar and Sur, and a cut in the family allowances would yield much better and larger results. Alban however has been instructed to submit a report on the financial situation as soon as he gets to Muscat, to go into the question of the Levies and then to explore the possibility of the different sources of revenue.GIPD—L 427(c) F&amp;PD—1-12-31—10.

D. 0. LETTER FROM Mr. S. E. HeDGCOCK, Karachi, dated the 15th June 1931 (Confi dential). i 1 hope to arrive in Simla on the afternoon of June 18th, and would be very grateful if you could kindly find time to give me, at any time during the following days, a personal interview, however short. My address will be the Hotel Cecil. Soon after my arrival I realized that the Muscat Infantry was not being honestly admi nistered. The investigations of the new Political Agent, which rater alia reveal that the British Commandant has misapplied over Bs. 5,000 of Govt, of Muscat funds to his personal use, prove that I was right. Soon after my arrival I also recognized that the Muscat Infantry was the key to Muscat’s solvency. I had hoped to get through the essen tial reforms without an open scandal. This moderation on my part seems to have led to the belief that I tendered my resignation on inade quate grounds in a moment of petulant im patience. I had hoped that my resignation would lead to a local enquiry. I knew that I held all the trumps, but I was not allowed to play my hand. Instead Colonel Biscoe has advised the Council to terminate my services on the ground that I have suggested that there is a lack of harmony between the two Governments. There is some- ' thing grimly ironic in this reason to a man who has striven for five months to remove a grievance which, before his arrival in the country, was already a source of unfriendly feeling between the two governments, or to be more exact, between the Govt, of Muscat and the Govt, of India’s representative in the Gulf. The Muscat Council of State ponder on the record of the last three British officials em ployed by them, and are bewildered. Mr. Thomas .—Neglect of duties resulting in State’s bankruptcy, Targe undisclosed State debts (revealed by Mr. Hedgcock). An attempt to leave the country with State money he was not entitled to (stopped by Mr. Hedgcock). His actions apparently condoned as his contract terminated on the score of economy. Capt. Walker .—Misuse of State funds by— (а) running his force in an unjustifiably ex travagant manner, (б) misapplying public monies to his per sonal use. The above brought to light by Mr. Hedgcock, Capt. Walker, in spite of most of these irregu larities having been brought to the notice of the previous Political Agent, leaves Muscat en joying the full confidence and favour of the Gulf authorities. Mr. Hedgcock .—Writes a letter (ill drafted, I admit, but written under strain and provoca tion). Penalty: Summary dismissal as being no longer persona grata to the Govt, of India. In the circumstances as I found them in Muscat I feel confident that I acted in the right, and for that reason am prepared cheer fully to accept the consequences of my actions: all I ask is that I may be given an opportunity to justify myself before an impartial body.D. 0. LETTER TO Mr. S. E. HeDGCOCK, SlMLA, dated 18th June 1931. I have received your letter of the 15th June from Karachi and am writing to say that I shall of course be pleased to give you an interview as soon as you reach Simla. It would have given me personally much plea sure to ask you to stay at my house, but in the circumstances I think that you will agree that it would be better for me not to do so. I am accordingly addressing this to the Hotel Cecil. As regards the contents of your letter I do not know r whether you would describe me as an impartial body. At any rate there is no other available, and as I have said I shall be pleased to hear whatever you have to say. May I take this opportunity of pointing out that although your letter may have been hastily composed there is no justification for your des cription of what has happened in respect of your self as “summary dismissal as being no longer persona grata to the Government of India”? You yourself tendered your resignation and it was accepted. P.S .—Would 11 a.m. at my office to-morrow suit yon? GIPD-E 4S7(c1f&amp;PD—1-12-31—10.GIPD—L 427(c)F&amp;PD—1-12-31—10. D. 0. LETTER FROM Mr. S. E. HedGCOCK, SlMLA, dated the 18th June 1931. I am very grateful indeed to you for granting me a personal interview, and for fixing it so soon after my arrival. I asked for an “impartial” body as I feared you might be too busy to hear me. I willingly bring my case to you as 1 know you to be just. I am confident that you will not back your officers just because they are your officers, but will judge my case on its merits; also that you will give more weight to honesty of intention than to slips in procedure. If the initial error rests with one of your officers, I feel sure that you will not allow me to be the victim. As I am seeing you tomorrow I will say no more except to ask to be permitted to explain that the situation in Muscat had reached such a pitch of strain, unfriendliness and suspicion that (for reasons I will explain to you) I felt bound, as the man holding the portfolio of Finance, to tender my resignation to the Presi dent of the Council of State. The Council fully supported in writing all I had done and asked n^e to withdraw my resignation. I deferred doing so until I heard (through Captain Prior) that my second attempt to reach you had suc ceeded. Then, having done all I could, I with draw my resignation on being asked by the President for my final decision. My withdrawal was accepted “with much delight”. Col. Biscoe’s letter advises the Council “to termi nate my services” at present the Council wish the P. R. to re-consider this advice. I may have been over-zealous in the per formance of my duties but I was rather forced into that line of action by seeing how the other British employees of the Govt, of Muscat had let the State down. In conclusion may I thank you once again for sparing me your valuable time for a per sonal interview. P. S .—I posted you from Muscat an official application. As this does not appear to have reached you, I venture to enclose a copy.t). 0. LETTER TO Lt.-CoL. H. V. BlSCOfe, C/0 the High Commr. for India, London, dated the 23rd June 1931. (Copy of portion bracketed [ ] sent to Army Secretary -V INFORMALLY.) I hope that you have found time in London to see your doctors as well as to visit the India Office and that they are giving you a favourable report so that you may be able to Tetum with renewed vigour at the end of your leave. I will not now refer to previous correspond ence as you being on a holiday will not have it by you, but you will remember that in April last Hedgcock tendered his resignation to the Muscat Council, that the Council were advised by you to accept that resignation and Hedgcock was advised by me not to reconsider it. Subsequently when Hedgcock wanted to withdraw his resignation the Government of India agreed, on your re commendation to the Council being told that the resignation should be accepted, and that certain terms should be offered to Hedgcock in connection with passage and so forth. Hedgcock arrived in Simla on the 18th of June and made a representation of his case. I have laid the facts before His Excellency who desires me to let you know that in his opinion Hedgcock appears to be a better stamp of man than we are likely to be able to get for the sarnie money again and, whatever his fault of tactless ness and impetuosity may have been—and His Excellency agrees that although much of what he did or wanted to do may have been right he certainly set about it to a great extent in the wrong way,—to have the best interests of the Muscat State thoroughly at heart. He would therefore be glad if you consider it in any way possible, to get the matter smoothed over and permit Hedgcock to return to Muscat. According to Hedgcock’s account he gets on very well with Alban ; so the difficulty will not become acute until your leave is over and Fowle has to return to Muscat. [Hedgcock has drawn my attention to certain alleged irregularities on the part of Walker in ^connection with Muscat State funds. The two more serious charges are: first, that Walker paid for Mrs. Walker’s passage to Karachi and that of a servant out of State money, beyond the terms of his contract, and second, that his do mestic servants to the number of nine were also paid for out of levy funds. Hedgcock says that he brought this matter to Fowle’s notice, but is not aware whether Fowle reported it to you or not. Do not suppose that I regard these allegations as already proved, but if they were made to Fowle, he ought certainly to have reported them to you and the matter seems to need clearing up. I do not say that any public action in Muscat is required, but it is necessary that the Government of India should know whether one of its officers, lent to the Muscat State, behaved improperly in a financial matter or not. Until a decision on this point has been reached it seems undesirable that Hedgcock should be sent away as he has all the papers and documents in his office. In the circumstances, pending a reply to this letter, Hedgcock is being advised to proceed to Bushire and there go into the matters connected with the allegations against Walker with Fowle, who will be called upon to submit his considered opinion as soon as possible.] From Bushire Hedgcock could probably return to Muscat without impairing Fowle s dignity in any way and certainly without any ill effect on yours. Will you please let me have a reply as soon as possible ? D. O. LETTER FROM Mr. S. E. HEDGCOCK, Simla, dated the 20th June 1931. May I further trespass upon your kindness by requesting you, when you see the Viceroy on Monday, to put to him the following point'? In Baghdad I opposed a land concession which the High Commissioner had been instructed to obtain by the Duke of Devonshire, then Colonial Secretary. I openly pointed out to the Council of Ministers the harmful effect on Iraq of H. B. M. G.’s proposals, if they were accepted. In the end the concession was net granted and the newspapers announced the High Commissioner’s non-success. Neverthe less, though I had won my point on a matter of some magnitude, it was still possible for me to meet the High Commissioner officially and socially. In Muscat I set the country on the path towards solvency by resisting the Political Besi- dent’s advice which was financially unsound. But because I have gained my point, the Political Resident feels that official relations between us will in future be difficult and that my services should therefore be terminated. May I ask how I was to know that a proce dure which under the Colonial Office was cor rect would, under the India Office, result in my threatened dismissal after serving as Financial Adviser, Muscat, for less than six months? D. 0. letter from Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, Simla, dated the 22nd June 1931. I return herewith your precis of my statement to the Foreign Secretary. I have made certain alterations which are based on the written notes I used during my interview. I have also added a little additional information where I think this gives a fairer picture of events in Muscat. Could I kindly be given a copy of the final version? I can’t think how I came to give the impres sion that Major Fowle and Saiyid Said were apparently “hardly on speaking terms”. Saiyid Said does not find Major Fowle persona grata, but he does not openly show it. D. 0. LETTER FROM Mr. S. E. HeDGCOCK, Simla, dated the 23rd June 1931. I have been thinking things over, and much as I should like to take the fast mail to Bushire (I am the world’s worst sailor) I think I ought to go by the slow mail and spend at least a week in Muscat en route for the following reasons,If I am to take up with the Qffg. Political Resident Walker’s misappropriations I must go to Bushire with full documentary evidence. Alban has some; it will take me two or three days to collect the rest. Incidentally the Council might like me to make arrangements while in Muscat for meeting this month’s salary bills. My Treasury Officer is on two months’ leave in India and I handed over the Ministry of Finance at short notice to an Indian who has been in the country only a couple of months. Personally I should prefer to give my evi dence to the P. A., Muscat, and let him do the prosecuting (it was he who first formulated the charge against Walker in writing) though natu rally I am fully prepared to follow the wishes of the Government of India in this matter. If it is considered desirable that I should not return to Muscat until an answer is received from Col. Biscoe, may I suggest that I remain in India? I have brought with me a long list of official matters which require attention— from the supply of cheaper stationery to th« State to enquiries re. a motor dhow. Could I please be informed of the washes ol the Government of India at an early date so that 1 may make my plans? Rc. Impetuosity. A point to bear in mind is that I told Fowle that I intended to tender my resignation 36 hours before actually handing it to S'aiyid Said: he had his chance to prevent Piatters coming to a head. Demi-official telegram from the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 369, dated the 24th June 1931. My 362, 16th June.

Hedgcock proposes to sail from Karachi by the fast mail leaving July 5th.-JD. 0. LETTER FROM MR. S-. E. HeDGCOCK, Simla, dated the &amp;7th June 1981. I have made one small change in para. 7. The extract from Alban’s letter requires to bo typed in. The enclosed statement is right in emphasis ing that Fowle and myself disagreed on one subject onlv—the Levy Budget. On other subjects ii.e.y, Sur) we continued to work in co-operation and there was no petty bickering of any sort. As the statement stands it gives, in my 'opinion, a fair picture of events in Muscat. It does not however, as perhaps in fairness to Fowle it ought to do, stress the fact that influ ences outside Muscat had much to do w r ith Fowle’s attitude. May I please have a copy if you have a spare one? Foreign Secretary interviewed Mr. Hedgcoek, Financial Adviser, Muscat State, by appoint ment this morning. Mr. Hedgcock made a 1&lt; -ng statement regarding conditions in the State of Muscat particularly the events which led up to the tendering of. his resignation on April the 10th last. 2. The statement opened with an account of the personality of Said Saved, the heir-apparent to tfie Sultanate. Said Sayed was described bv Mr. Hedgcock as an educated and enlighten ed young man of 23 years of age who was ambi tious to be master in his own house and if allowed to do so to establish a well-organised administration in Muscat. Possessed of a strong sense of justice he had the quality rare among Muscatis of being very careful with money. ‘ t)n occasions he had shown considerable tact in dealing with the local tribes and had conceiv ed the idea of amalgamating the seaboard with the interior. In short, he showed much promise of becoming a capable ruler of his country; he is at present, according to Mr. Hedgcock, easy to manage, provided he is taken the right way. 8. Mr. Hedgcock w r ent on to explain that on his arrival in Muscat on the 28th of December last the very first official question with which he was required to deal was that of reduction of expenditure on the Levy Corps. Ihe point was mentioned as proof that there was a con flict between the Council and the local repre sentatives of the Government of India before he himself had taken up his appointment as Finan cial Adviser. He had not been in Muscat very long before he realised that the Council was suffering from a sense of grievance over various -matters in particular: — fa) the undisclosed debts due by the State which came to light as a result of Mr. Hedgcock’s investigations, N.C._Mr. Thomas was still in the Ruba-al- Khali. Mr. Hedgcock did not take over from him until he had been three months in Muscat. (b) alleged extravagance on the part of Captain Walker, Commandant of the Muscat Infantry, (c) a distrust of the policy of the Govern ment of India who the Muscat Council felt were deliberately thrusting them into indebtedness in order to maintain -their control of the State. Major Fowle's procedure (personal and offi cial) at times irritated Saiyid Said and during the time the two spent in Karachi relations must have become strained judging from a re mark made by Saiyid Said to Mr. Hedgcock. Saiyid Said’s relations with Captain Walker* did not extend beyond the formally polite. Mr. Hedgcock also observed among the Council a growing lack of confidence in Colonel Biscoe’s judgment. (For reasons see paragraph 9.) 4. Mr. Hedgcock admitted that on his arrival in Muscat he was treated by Major and Mrs. Fowle with the greatest kindness and they had made him and his wife their guests for a fort night. For the first seven weeks Major Fowle actively co-operated with Mr. Hedgcock in his plans for retrenchment, particularly in the matter of the Levy Budget where he showed much tact and patience in dealing with Captain Walker s reluctance to make any sacrifices. After three w r eeks of almost daily discussions the levy budget w T as fully thrashed out - and a despatch was sent to the Political Resident containing the agreed recommendations of the three officials concerned. This despatch speci ally mentioned Mr. Hedgcock’s reasonable atti tude during the negotiations. Though Captain Walker inserted a covering clause concerning the possible discontent of his men, the des^ patch in question could fairly be taken ns re presenting what all the local authorities were prepared to accept. The Political Resident visited Muscat on February 15th and under his influence both Major Fowle and Captain Walker backed out of their previous agreement, thus leaving Mr. Hedgcock unaided to press for the essential 12h per cent. *cut. 5. Realising that the 5 per cent, cut sanctioned by the Political Resident was bound to result in another deficit, Mr. Hedgcock drafted a letter which he asked to be forwarded to the Political Resident and if necessary ultimately to the Government of India. In this letter he set out all the arguments for retrenchment and he hoped that in forwarding it to the Government of India the Political Resident would state the other side of the case enabling the Government of India to judge fairly between the two points of view. Major Fowle’s reluctance and delay in the matter of forwarding this letter to the Political Resident was the first hint that his former co-operation had come to an end. Mr. Hedgcock subsequently found his attempt to obtain reconsideration of the Political Resident’s decision unable to penetrate the combined opposition of the Political Agent and Levy Commandant. He began to feel that Muscat’s solvency was now regarded as of secondary im portance; the aim of the Political Agent seemed to be to save his own or the Political Resident’s face, and this belief was confirmed by Mr. Hedgcocks’s being asked by the Political Agent not to press for further pay reductions until the autumn. Later Mr. Hedgcock felt that the Political Agent was taking the line that increased revenues would make a further cgt in the Levies’ pav unnecessary. He urged with the utmost insistence that instead of an increase in revenue there would almost certainly be a decrease. He asked that copies of &lt;• ny despatch on his budget which Major Fowle in tended sending to the Political Resident should be shown to him.. His request w r as refused.Finally, in order to shake the Political Agent’s confidence in Captain Walker’s judgment, Mr. Hedgcock reported to Major Fowle certain mis appropriations by Captain Walker of Govern ment of Muscat funds and suggested a court of enquiry. No action was taken by Major Fowle. After Major Fowle's- departure on recess Muscatis reported to Mr. Hedgcock the return of the Political Agent’s motor driver. The innuendo latent in their remarks became appa rent on the production of a contract under which the said driver w r as taken on the strength of the Lew during Major Fowle’s temporary absence. The filling of this non-essential post by Major Fowle’s driver seemed to Mr. Hedg cock, after all he had done to cut dowm everv surplus rupee in the Levy budget, to be the last straw. 6. Mr. Hedgcock then proceeded to place before the Foreign Secretary evidence of mis appropriation of funds on the part of Captain Walker. He read out the following extract from the Political Agent Muscat’s demi-official No. 134-C of 9th June 1931: — * * * “Thirdly. There are far too many followers and non-military personnel. I see that follow ing on the departure of the late Commandant Captain Walker no less than 8 followers became surplus to requirements, Captain Walker's cook, I see is a Lance-Naik drawung pav of rank and rations, here too there appears to be an ex cellent field for economy’'. * * * These surplus followers 'were according to the Acting Commandant’s letter :. One Sweeper. One Dhobie. Two Punkha Coolies. Two. Jarowals. One Boatman. One Bhishti.. Mr. Hedgcock also mentioned that the State budget was made to pay for a leave passage for Mrs. Walker and one servant (inadmissible under Captain Walker’s contract) and for food lor his dogs and for a boatman for his private motor boat; also that fines were paid into a sports fund. Some of the above irregularities were reported to Major Fbwle who, as already stated, took no action. In the meantime since Captain Alban has succeeded Major Fowde, the former has investigated the matter and has re ported to Bushire that Captain Walker’s mis appropriations of Muscat Government funds amount to Ks. 5,000 or more. 7. Personal relations between Mr. Hedgcock and Captain Walker throughout were bad. Apparently in Muscat the Financial Adviser is senior to the Commandant of the Muscat In fantry. When however Mr. Hedgcock wrote to Captain Walker and asked him to come and discuss official matters with him he on occasions rrt only did not appear but failed to acknow ledge receipt of Mr. Hedgcock s letters. 8. Mr. Hedgcock instanced as an example of the difficulty of enforcing ret r enohment in Muscat, If the retrenchment were nett to apply to the Levy Corps, the fact that the Director General of Customs had stated to him that his department had to suffer because it had no' one to protect it as the Levy Corps had. 9. Mr. Hedgcock proceeded to explain that the cause of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs in Muscat was due to the lack of proper procedure in the conduct of official business. For example (as in the case of the original Levy budget of Ps. 1,54,000) the Political Agent sub mits his proposals to’ the Political Resident without previous discussion with the Council. These return to Muscat in the form of “advice' which the Council finds itself quite unable to accept. This method leads to difficulties and Iriction. Also the Political Agent at times was inclined to overlook the fact that the correct official channel of communication between him self and officers serving the State of Muscat was through the Council. Captain Walker seemed to regard himself as almost independent of the Council. 10. Towards the end of March Mr. Hedgcock drew up a very frank report containing a precis of events relating to the negotiations concern ing the Levy budget. This report be asked Major Fowle to forward demi-officially to the Political Resident which the latter did not do. Mr. Hedgcock therefore sent the report private ly to the Political Resident. In this report the financial anomalies existing in the Levy Corps were explained, e.g., Pay of sepoy, with ra-tions, clothing, etc., was equivalent to Rs. 40 p.m. and was excessive compared with a State askari who only got Rs. 10. Rs. 7 per month and had to find his own rifle, food and clothing. The proportion of N. C. O.’s to men was too high: 1 N. C. O. to every two or three fighting men. Local labour was paid at excessive rates, e.g , Punkah Coolies received Rs. 15 per month and rations and were engaged for 12 months in the year, two of which were taken as leave on- full pay. In the Agency Punkah coolies are paid Rs. 7 per month and engaged for 6 months in. the year. Expensive artizans were engaged in India. Their terms of service were far too liberal, e.g., two months’ leave every year on full pay with free return steamer and rail pass ages. In the case of the bootmaker the State paid these fares for himself, his wife and two children. 11. Mr. HeidgCPok then proceeded to explain how he came'-to tender his resignation. Condi tions in Muscat at' the beginning of April were as follows:— e -u ■&lt; The Council was resentful and suspicious of all delay; revenue'was falling and the Treasury was borrowing locally right and left. Relation’s were strained all round. Mr. Hedgcock felt that misleading accounts of the financial situ ation were being sent to the Political Resident, yet he himself was unable to get his own (since proved correct) yiews^ to higher authority.' He was working entirely in the dark and was given no inkling as to how negotiations with the Poli tical Resident were proceeding. Mr. Hedgeock found himself confronted with the choice of letting things slide or else of taking some drastic- action which would, by drawing the attention of higher authorities to Muscat, prevent matters- from going from bad to worse.G1PD -L 427(c) F&amp;I'D—1* 12 31—10'. V 3 Eventually Mr. Hedgcock tendered his resig nation. This was not meant to be taken lite rally but as a protest against existing condi tions in Muscat. The resignation was handed ^-stO the President of the Council of State who pressed Mr. Hedgcock to withdraw it. At first the latter refused, but when he was satisfied that the fact that he had tendered his resigna tion had been reported to Simla, he then con sented to withdraw it, realizing that his protest had been effective. He explained also that the resignation had been tendered on the 10th of April for special reasons, one of which was that Saiyid Said had applied for the second cut in the pay of the Levies on Mr. Hedgcock’s assur ance that this coiirse had the approval of the Political Agent. Saiyid Said thus had good reason for feeling confident that with the Politi cal Agent’s support his request for the early sanction of the second cut would be granted. Without thifc assurance it is doubtful whether Saiyid Said would haVe issued this letter (which in the first place was actually drafted by the Political Agent). As it appeared that the Poli tical Agent had not in fact supported Saiyid Said’s request and that the Political Resident was about to reject it, Mr. Hedgcock felt that Saiyid Said had been less than honourably treated, and at once tendered his resignation. **• . ' 12. During the course of the discussion Mr. Hedgcock mentioned, d propos of the proposed increase in the rate of customs duty at Muscat, that certain treaties and agreements existed under the terms of which the tribes might think they were exempt from any enhancement of the traditional rate. This point is to be taken up separately.GIPD—L 427(c) F&amp;PD—1-12-SI—10. Demi-official letter to the Hon. Major T. C. W.

Demi-official letter from Mr. S. E. Hedg- cock, Karachi, dated 4th July 1931. I hope you will erase from your memory as early as possible the picture of an assertive, aggressive, somewhat vindictive (and exceed ingly weary) Financial Adviser; having one’s back to the wall brings out the worst qualities. I propose being very reticent about the events of the last two and a half months, partly because I think its a case of the least said the soonest mended and also because I am too ashamed of the amount of dirty linen I washed in the effort to save my own skin to wish to think, let alone talk, about past events. I do not think you need fear any further impetuous action on my part; as a matter of fact I am normally given to chewing the cud before action. If I appear to be acting hastily it is because I have minutely examined and am certain of the ground before me. .During the next year (if Col. Biscoe raises no objection to my return) I hope to prove to you that I can work in amicable co-operation with both Arab—British officials. I will bear in mind your suggestion that my young potentate probably has more of the goose than of the Swan strain in him. I very much regret the trouble and incon venience my actions have put you to. I hope and think, however, that good will eventually come of it all. I have decided not to resign again until I have sufficient private means to be indifferent as to the outcome. My gratitude will take the practical form of running a good show in Muscat and of main taining close and friendly relations between the two Governments—if I can be permitted for the last time to use that phrase. P.S .—I sail for Bushire to-morrow.

Prom Major T.C. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Agent &amp; H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat. To The Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. « Sir, In continuation of my letter No. 73-C of 17-3-1931, I have the honour to send my comments as follows. Fixing of Levy Budget for 1931. 1. As explained in your letter to the Government of India No. 99-S of 5th March 1931(paras 11,12), during your visit here from 13th to 15th of February you gave the Council your opinion that a cut In the Levy expenditure round about Rs.12,000/- would be sufficient in the first instance, leaving over the question of a further cut to later in the year if the financial condition of the State warranted. 2. I was therefore under the impression that all that remained to be done was for Captain Walker to prepare his budget on the above lines. When you had departed,however, both Mr. Hedgcock and the Council executed a volte - face , the former pressing for his original cut instead of the Rs.12,000/- agreed on, and the latter, l.e. Said Saiyid, stating that they had only agreed to the cut in the sepoys pay but not to the total amount. Having regard to our future relations with the Council, and their Financial Adviser, it seemed imperative to impress on them that abargain was a bargain. I therefore took up the attitude that a budget showing a saving of about the sum agreed upon should be accented, though of course the Council were at liberty to express in their letter of acceptance their wish to have it revised later. Finally, after a good deal of difficulty, the letter from the Council sent under my letter No. 56-C of 10th March 1931, was obtained. Various figures, however, still remained in dispute between Mr.Hedgcock and Captain Walker and it was not until the day before yesterday that a final budget was produced acceptable to both. Though of course the responsibility for producing the budget lay between the Financial Adviser and the Commandant, I did not think it incumbent on me to remain merely an interested spectator. On the contrary I have spent many hours in intervening, in endeavouring to throw oil on somewhat troubled financial waters, and to bring the parties to some agreed conclusion. My labours were not lightened by the murder of Ghulam All at Gwadur which necessitated a week’s absence from Muscat, and then the writing of a long report. For details of Captain Walker’s budget see Appendix. My comments on it, from information supplied by Captain Walker, are given below (paras.3-5).It will be noticed that the saving comes to Rs.11,000 not Rs.12,000. Mr. Hedgcock has accepted it but I am of opinion that the exact saving of Rs.12,000 should be made. I have brought this point to the notice of Captain Walker who has assured me that somehow or other the balance of Rs.1,000 will be made up and put up to t v e Council before the 1st of next month. The Levy Budget for 1931. 3. The cuts made by the Commandant Levy Corps in comparison with the actual expenditure for last year are as follows Expenditure for 1930 Rs. 1,36,831. Budget for 1931 n X i j?5.1i 15.5003. Of this total, in 1930 a sum of Rs.4,500 was Included for horses of the Royal Family. This item, which is not of course a proper charge on the Levy, is not budgetted for in 1931 budget and must therefore be deducted from the saving of Rs.15,500, making a net saving of Rs.11,000, 4. The expenditure on establishment for 1930 (i.e. pay of officers, and men and followers) was Rs.1,01,640, The budget estimate under this heading for 1931 is Rs.91,032 i.e. a saving of Rs. 10,608. 5. Savings under establishment in the budget estimate for the year have been effected by:- Cut in the establishment of N.C.Os. :- 2 Havildars. Note« 6 Sepoys have been 1 L/Havildar enlisted to keep establishment up to 3 I/Naiks. 150 rifles. Cut, in the pay of N.C.Os. - Havildar Major Rs. 6/~ Havildars ^ 6/- I/Havildars ' 5/- Naiks ' 4 /- Sepoys ' Cut in Go od Conduct pay of N.C.Qs. - Three rates of Rs.5, totalling Rs.15/-, reduced to three rates of Rs.3, totalling Rs. 9/-.

I do not wish to criticise Mr. Hedgcock, who is a capable, hard-working financier, but I cannot help thinking that his hastiness and - as a consequence - his method of producing his figures and letters piecemeal have not a little complicated a situation already sufficiently compli cated. n n the 12th January for instance, Mr.Hedgcock in a review of the financial position of the State estimated the deficit on the year’s working for 1931 at Rs.78,000 / 6 ' cc (vide your letter No. 99-S of i£%h March 1931 to the Government of India). This was still the position accord ing to Mr. Hedgcock on your visit here 13th-15th February. Only a fortnight later in his letter to the Council of 28th February, forwarded to you under my letter N0.56-C of 10th March, he estimates the deficit on the year at Rs.90,000 (para.2). In both Instances he allows for two instalments of the Government of India*s loan of Rs.21,750, i.e. a total of Rs. 43,500/-. If he was not sure of the first estimate at the time of your visit, it would have been better for him to have said so, waited until he was sure, and then put up a final estimate. 7. Mr. Hedgcock is at times inclined to wander off the point, and to discuss matters which have no immediate bearing on the question under consideration - the present financial condition of the State, and which are perhaps somewhat outside his competence as Financial Adviser. (e.g. paragraph 6 of his letter No.S.24/2 of 24th February sent to you under my letter No. 55-C of 10th March 1931) I have made no attempt to follow Mr. Hedgcock into these digressions. Attitude of the Council and Financial Adviser. 8. The attitude of the Council and Mr. Hedgcock(as outlined in the latter*s letter of 28th February 1931, sent to you under my letter No. 56-C of 10th March 1931, and his letter of 24th February 1931 sent td you under my letter No. 55-C of 10th March 1931) is briefly as follows.That the budget provisionally accepted falls short both in quantity and quality - if this term may be used - of what they consider necessary. The crux of the original budget agreed to by Mr. Hedgcock (vide his letter of 1st February 1931 forwarded to you under ny letter No. 27-C of 2nd February 1931) was the 16|$ cut in the pay of the rank and file. If the cut is not made their hands are tied in making cuts in their other departments. 9. I do not think that the Council and Mr. Hedgcock are on very strong ground in stating that they cannot make retrenchments in other departments unless their demands for a cut in the Levy is met in full. Excluding meticulous considerations of percentages, as will be seen from paras 3-5/a substantial initial reduction has been made in Levy expenditure, and of a sufficiently varied nature to give the Council a handle to make other retrenchments, are if they/really in earnest about this. Present claim of the Council. 10 . The reductions which the Council now want in the Levy Budget for 1931 are contained in Mr. Hedgcock’s letter No. S.12/3 of 12th March sent to you under my No. 73-C of 17th March. They may be summarised as follows (a) The total Levy Budget allotment should be the average sum spent during the last two years (i.e. Rs.132,920) reduced by 16%. This figure includes the reduction already sanctioned by the Council under the advice of the Political Resid-nt, and comes to Rs.ill,653. (b) The Commandant may himself decide where the economies are to be effected provided that a further minimum cut of Rs.3/- p.m. on the pay of each sepoy, and pro rata for Non commissioned officers, is made. 11. With reference to (a) the Budget submitted by Captain Walker (para.3, and Appendix) comes to Rs.121,331, I.e. an excess over the Council's claim of Rs.9,678.12. With reference to (b) the cut in the sepoys 1 pay has been Rs.2/-, so another Rs.3/- cut would have to he made. 13. Captain Walker with whom, of course, as Commandant of the Levies, I have discussed the claim, wishes me to state that the statement contained in para 5 of Ministry of Finance letter No.S.12/3 of 12th March 1931 that he (Captain Walker) had agreed to a reduction equivalent to that given above is not understood by him. What he did agree to is shown in Muscat Levy No. 4 of 1st February 1931 sent to you under my No. 27-C of 2nd February 1931 agreeing to carry out savings of Rs.21,000, a total expenditure of Rs. 1,20,000, and Mr. Hedgcock agreed to this in his letter of 1st February 1931 sent to you under my letter quoted above. It appears therefore that Mr. Hedgcock was content with a total annual expenditure of about 1,20,000 at the time of your visit in the middle of February, but now wants a total expenditure of about Rs *1,11,000/-. Financial position of the State. 14. The financial position of the State, on which Mr. Hedgcock bases his main argument for a reduction in Levy expenditure, is reviewed in the latter's letter of 28th February 1931 to the Council of Ministers, which has already been alluded to (para. 6 above). There are so many hypotheses to be considered that useful comments on the review are difficult to make. There is no doubt that the position is a serious one. I think though that Mr. Hedgcock has perhaps taken a somewhat too gloomy a view as a Financier he naturally has to exercise caution. Prices for instance may not continue to fall, and if the meeting with the Bani Bu All and Jenebah next month at Sur goes off well (vide my letter No. 31-C of 12th February 1931) there will be no operations and therefore no cost to the State - beyond perhaps the slight one involved in repairing a few forts behind Aiqa. The7. enhancement of the Customs tariff must bring in an aopreciable increase of revenue even if not as much as expected. Said Saiyid - vide my telegram No. 78 of 20th March 1931 - has Just 'deposed' his uncle Saiyid Homed from the Wallship of Sohar where the latter for the last 10 years has exercised semi-independent rule,contributing very little to the Muscat Treasury, (last year Rs.1,900), considering the potentialities of his district. A tightening up of the revenue administration there should produce more revenue for Muscat, and on the return of Said Saiyid on the 2nd April Mr. Hedgcock is proceeding to Sohar to make investigations on the spot. Not having had an opportunity yet of visiting the Batinah Coast I had intended accompanying Mr. Hedgcock, but shall now be busy with a more urgent tour to Masira on behalf of the R.A.P. Eeply to the Council. 15. I am not of opinion that a second cut should be made now. The present cut was announced in February, as far as combatants are concerned. It has been in operation from the 1st March, and a second cut following so closely on the first would undoubtedly cause discontent in the Corps. It would still seem preferable to 'wait and see' . If the financial position of the State shows no improve ment in 5 or 6 months, say by next September, the question of a second cut can be taken up. A cut coming then, the cause being carefully exnlained to the Levies, though it would not be popular, would have a very different effect to a similar cut coming now, and could be carried through. I have shown this to Captain Walker who fully concurs. 16. If, however, a reply in the negative is given to the Council’s claim then I trust that - at the same time - it will be possible to inform them that the special permission asked for in my letter No. 11-C of 13thJanuary 1931 for the enhancement of the Customs Tariff has been obtained from His Majesty's Government and likewise for the reduction of the Sultan's allowance.

Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with your memorandum No. 83-C of 25th March i931, regarding the Muscat Levy Budget. As I have already told you in my telegram No. T-49 dated 4th April, I agree with your views that a further reduction is undesirable at present, and I consider that hedgcock’s attitude is unfortunate. It is however desirable to give the Council a reasoned reply to their requests but it is impossible for me to do so on the fragmentary figures that have been supplied to me piecemeal hitherto, and some of the items I am quite at a loss to understand. Would you therefore kindly ask Hedgcock to let you have a revised budget, showing receipts and expenditure under major heads. In this budget the following economies should of course, be taken into account. (a) reduction in the Sultan’s pay. (b) reduction in Levy Budget. (c) reduction in ruling family allowances and other departments, if any. And account should also be taken of increased income that may be expected from (a) Sohar; (b) Sur and (c) increase in the customs tariff which may be assumed will be sanctioned in the next two or three months. I hope you win try and check these figures as much as you can before transmitting them to me. Major T.C.W. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Agent, Muscat.As regards the Levy budget, I confess that I am completely bewildered by the various figures that have been submitted to me. In round figures the original budget was about Rs. 1,40,000. Hedgcock wanted a cut of Rs.21,000 bringing it down to about Rs. 1,20,000. I agreed to a cut of Rs. 12,000, reducing it to Rs.1,28,000.Walker has now produced a budget of Rs.1,21,331 and yet according to Hedgcock he has only effected a saving of Rs.l1,000, and Hedgcock is demanding a further saving of Rs.10,000, bringing the budget to Rs.l,11,000. Walker seems to me to be on very strong ground in the statement in paragraph 13 of your memorandum No. 83-C of the 25th March 1931, in which he states that he has actually cut down the budget to the figures originally demanded by Hedgcock,although he has only affected a saving of Rs. 11,000, but according to the above figures, he has actually effected a saving of about Rs.20,000. Could you elucidate the above figures; there is obviously a mistake somewhere. Yours sincerely, Sd/- H.V. BiscoeExtract from Despatch No. 112-C of 13/14th April 1931 from the Political Agent,Muscat. X X X X X Levy Budget. 2. The original Levy expenditure for 1930 shown to the Political Resident during his visit to Muscat was Rs. 1,40,831. The cut of Rs.12,000 which the Political Resident agreed to would have brought the budget down to Rs.1,28,831. Mi*. Hedgcock, however, objected that one item of Rs. 4,000 (debts) shown as expenditure in the Rs.1,40,831, was not actually expended and should be deduct ed from the expenditure before comparisons of reductions were made. This was accordingly done by Captain Walker and brought the expenditure down to Rs. 1,36,831. Mr. J^gcock also objected that a sum of Rs. 4,500 expended on the horses of the Ruling Family in 1930, was not a proper charge on the Levy, would not be included under Levy in 1931 (vide my letter No. 83-C of 25th March 1931, para.3), and should likewise be deducted. This further deduction brought the actual expenditure for 1930 down to Rs.1,32,331 from which the cut of Rs.l?,000 had to be made. 3. To effect this cut grants for rearmament were reduced by Captain Walker. Further savings under establishment were made of the nature indicated in paragraph 5 of my letter quoted above, with the result that the budget submitted by Captain Walker (attached to my letter) came to Rs.1,21,331. This was accepted by Mr. Hedgcock. A further saving of Rs.1,417 on pay of followers and reduction of Levy horses and Rs.1,000 on men discharged and not to be replaced until after the leave season has been effected by Captain Walker s nee the submission of the budget, reducing the latter to Rs. 1,18,914. 4. 'Mr. Hedgcock in his letter of 1st February 1931 sent to the Political Resident under my letter N0.27-C,2. 07 Sy dated the 2nd February 1931, originally agreed to a total expenditure for 1931 of Rs, 1,21,000(vide para. 13 of my letter already quoted), and the present Levy Budget(Rs.1,18,91® is less than this by Rs.1,086. In his letter No. S.12/3, dated the 12th March 1931 paragraph 5, sent to the Political Resident under my letter Mo. 83-C, dated the 25th March 1931, Mr. Hedgcock, however, now asks for a 161 of the average sum expended on the Levy during the last 2 years(Rs.1,32,920) which works out at about Rs.1,11,000/-. 5. From the budget of Rs. 1,18,914 can further be deducted the sum saved about Rs. 6,000 by there being no British Officer for 4 months after Captain Walker’s departure (vide Political Resid nt’s telegram No. T.52, dated the 10th April 1931) leaving a final budget of Rs. 1,12,914/-. 6.

Department. /i &gt;14p. 3000 8/:;l the impression which he considers is abroad that his career in the public service has been terminated in circumstances discreditable to himself. The only means of removing such impression that he could suggest was a grant of money compensation, with the implied admission that a mistake had been made. I said that I feared that there was no chance at all of this. It would obviously have been better from his point of view if he had left Muscat on the basis of his original resignation, before the subsequent complications ensued, including the Council’s letter of 25 July terminating his services. I thought that the G. of I., in saying in their letter of 21 September that his resignation, accepted on 25 July, must be considered operative, were motived by a desire to put the best face on the matter from his point of view. I suggested that the best thing was to regard his services as having been terminated by his resignation tendered on account c f a difference of policy. If we were asked for regarding his service at Muscat by a prospective employer, we could say that he had resigned for this reason, and, if necessary, that he had continued for some time thereafter at Muscat in order to meet the wishes of the authorities. In any case, I assured him that so far as the India Office was concerned we did not consider that he had left Muscat m circumstances adversely reflecting on his reputation, and were content to regard it as a case of resignation over a genuine difference of policy. As/MM As a natter of fact, it is clear that Mr. H.'s resignation of April v/as a mistake on his part; he regarded it as a neans of securing consideration of his views; from the point of view of Col. Biscoe and the G. of I., if it was not intended to be taken seriously, it might be regarded as an attempt to secure acceptance of his views by the higher authorities by means of a threat of resignatio: in short, by a species of bluff. Such a step naturally would not predispose them in his favour. But it seems that at first, at any rate, they took his resignation at its face value and thought that he really desired to give up a position oi responsibility in which his advice had not been accepted on what he regarded as an essential point. This, as a matter of fact, seems the best point of view from which to regard the matter in Mr. Hedgcock's interests, and it is rather a pity that the point has been somewhat obscured by the subsequent hesitations on the part both of Mr. Hedgcock and of the G. of 1. The Government of India ! s action however was designed in Mr. Hedgcock 1 s interest. They were anxious to keep him at Muscat if possible. This was found to be — cT) aS A o-V - ' not possible as the local authorities in cl uding 7 the A Muscat Council preferred that his resignation should be accepted. This decision must be attributed partly to temperamental difficulties which made Mr. Hedgcock difficult to-get on with.

Mr. Hedgcock appeared to be greatly mollified by his interview. There seems to be nothing that v. r e can do for him except to answer any enquiries received from a prospective public or private employer in a sense as favourable to him as possible. Mr. Howell has ! already told him that he may quote him (Mr. Howell) to the effect that in his opinion the circumstances in no way refelct either on his ability or integrity.

Usually a difficult charge to refute, but in this case I can quote what was said of me by the present Foreign Secretary to the Government of India when I was serving under him in Iraq. #'He has an unusually good knowledge of Arabic, »• remarkable insight into the Oriental mind, great sympathy with and consideration for those with whom he has to deal, and a sanity of outlook and coolness of judgment scarcely to be expected in so young a man. t consider that Capt.Hedgcock, of whose work I have seen ft a great deal since he first joined the Mesopotamian Political Department, is in every way suited for employment in the Government 6f India Political Department, or in any o ther capacity in anv eastern aaE&amp;Lsa.'

Colonel Biscoe was perhaps unaware that during his leave in England my proposals were smoothly put into effect - so smoothly in fact that while I was in Simla the Government of Muscat, in collaboration with the local representative of the Government of India, put through further economies and reductions. In view of the fact that reductions over and above those recommended by me were found practicable, the term Graetl, tallied to my origin^ proposals does not seem exactly w le mot juste”. (3) Has rinai-?cift' As an ex-pl£it.ical officer, who had received his early training under the present Foreign Secretary, I realized on arrival at Muscat that there was something wrong with the political atmosphere. The matter seemed to me sufficiently grave to warrant my writing privately to the Foreign Secretary (see flag K and following correspondence). If the policy of H.B.M.G. xs to be indifferent to the growth of unfriendly feelings on the part of a small and unimportant State, then I must admit to my political sense being at fault.

Prevailing rates of pay justified a cut of Rs.10. The Political Agent and myself agreed on a Rs 5 cut - he because it was administratively feasible, I because it was the minimum that would produce a balanced budget. Colonel Biscoe, without adequate enquiry or reason, over-ruled our joint decision, and sanctioned only a Rs 2 out, a step which left me precisely three-fifths of the way a balan09d budget . To ‘ gecure this end i eventually tendered my resignation, a British/I 3, Prime Minister, in somewhat similar circumstances, recently resigned in order to secure the same end - if I may he permitted to compare a small with a very Ijige issue.

(5) ILaLl^L-X£l3: l ..fQUl frf tha-lflCftl representati ves Of the Goverrynerit. of India ,. This seems to depend on the point of view. The State of Muscat was on/ the verge of bankruptcy. On the one hand were the Government of India officials, confident that this year’s revenues would obligingly increase, and ready with no arguments but wait and see'. On the other hand was myself, convinced by close study of the situation that revenues would tall this year (as they did), and determined to produce a balanced budget. The alternatives were (a) Ncjclash, and bankruptcy for Muscat (b) A clash, and Muscat solvent. I did my best to avoid a clash by asking for the decision of the Government of India on my finncial programme, but Colonel Biscoe failed to forward my despatch to Did I fall foul of the Government of India officials, or they of me? ( 6 ) Dissatisfied I was extremely interested in my work at Muscat, but found that I could not live on my pay. My predecessor, (a bachelor, and junior to me when in the Iraq service) drew Rs 2,000 p,m. As a measure of economy, the pay of myself (married, with three children) was reduced to Rs 1 ; 4°0 P***, with no pension contribution. The pay of the other two British officials in Muscat was;. Political Agent (including allowances)-Rs 5,000 p.m. approx., plus pension.Levy Commandant,(in command of 150 men)-Rs 1,400 plus pension plus free orderly, I drew the attention of the President of the Muscat Council of State, and of the Foreign Secretary, to th© undesirability of having in charge fif Muscat 1 s finances an official who could not make ends meet on his pay. Both were sympathetic, the latter admitting that it was not mauh, and suggesting that I should take up the question with the Government of India when Musc4t had achieved solvency# This one question of dissatisfaction was thus under process of amicable agreement, and can hardly be advanced as an argument for terminating my services* Lastly, and most important, what weight can the athorities A at the India Office fairly attach to Colonel Biscoe’s adverse commentsT It must be remembered that most of his criticisms were made while he was on leave, and were based on his recoil- lections of the shock caused by my proposed reforms. By the time he returned to the Gulf, every single one of the drastic, hasty, unreasonable and politically insound proposals of the femperamentally unsuitable Financial Adviser had been quietly accepted by the local representative* of the Government of India.

The present despatch from Colonel Biscoe amplifies his telegram at P.Z.2560 Below: we have also heard (P.Z.2805) that Mr.Hedgcock has agreed to the Council’s request to reconsider his decision and give a final reply when the Heir Apparent returns, Mr.Hedgcock did not take at all kindly to the modifications suggested in his Levy Corps retrenchment scheme and seems to have felt considerahle personal animosity against Colonel Biscoe, against whom he brings pel A Awl some charges. On the other hand, the Political Agent and Resident have found great difficulty in getting him to submit information in a businesslike way and Major Fowle relates one incident in which he was definitely/definitely obstructive. Having failed to obtain his demands in toto , he has adopted an attitude of sulkiness and made little effort in other directions to improve the resources of the State. He seems to have made up his mind to take an unduly pessimistic view, not realizing that IT for many years past the condition of the Muscat State might have been described by a financial purist as one of bankruptcy' and that 'though serious and calling for prompt remedial measures, it is not desperate'. (§ 3 of Colonel Biscoe's despatch at P.Z.1707 - attacked). ‘&lt;iuite apart from all this, his references to the differences between himself and the Government of India (i.e. the Resident) in his letter to the Eresident of the Council of April 11th are deplorable. He also talks of disagreement on 'fundamental principles', apparently referring to British interference in Muscat. He has, in fact, throughout his appointment shown a complete failure to realize that strictly financial desiderata must often give way to other considerations and he is, as Colonel Biscoe says, temperamentally unfitted for the appointment. There is no point in retaining a dissatisfied officer and Colonel Biscoe has therefore, asked the Government of India to authorise him by telegram to advise the Council to accept Mr.Hedgcock 1 s resignation.- As for his successor, Colonel Biscoe suggests that Captain Alban, who is proceeding to Muscat to officiate as Political Agent while Major Fowle is officiating as Resident - and of whom he speaks most highly - should assist the Council with his advice in financial matters until the autumn and then when Major Fowle returns, take up the post of Financial Adviser and, as a trial measure at any rate, at the same time command the Levies. Captain Alban, who is at present Under-Secretary4793A 5000 10 30 Minute Paper Department, 2c 5 ''“'v PO to the Hesident, has already held the latter posts for over a year and also officiated as Political Agent, and has a v;ide loiowledge of the State. Inasmuch as he will in practice probably be able to exercise during his period as Political Agent a very large measure of financial control and, perhaps, gradually put Mr .Hedgcock 1 s recommendations into force, as circumstances permit, Colonel Biscoe’s recommendations seem suitable. It is clearly impossible to find a new Financial Adviser at once, and there seems little use in forcing Mr.Hedgcock to stay on against his will during the heat of a Muscat summer, as Major Fowl© (§ 2 of his letter) seems to suggest. The post of Levy Commandant is in any case to remain vacant for the summer, and if it is subsequently held by the Financial Adviser, there will be a further saving for Muscat revenues. u«.Oi tft- l*- SEEN LITICAL COMMITTEE. - Z JUN 1931 : / ^ Ay l- 11/ U. c \r^ pz i#nbt Please see Sir Denys Bray's note of 2nd Jun Sir Denys felt some doubt as to whether we should not be over doing things were we, in addition to a Political Agent, to have a Political Officer doubling the posts o f Levy Commandant and Financial Adviser. He suggested that it might be possible to employ an Indian - perhaps a Madrasgi - on a much lower rate of pay as Financial Adviser who, without interfering in politics, would get the finances of the State on a more satisfactory basis. Colonel Biscoe who has, I understand, also discussed it with Sir Denys Bray. Colonel Biscoe said that he entirely agreed in principle as to the undesirability of overweighting these Arab administrations with political officers, and that he had consistently aimed at keeping evidence of our presence and control in Muscat and elsewhere in the Gulf so far as practicable in the background. But we were faced in Muscat at the present juncture with a very peculiar situation, owing to the failure of Mr. Hedgcock to develop on the lines we had hoped. The critical condition of the State finances and the continued absence of the Sultan called for special handling. While, therefore, he agreed that in ordinary circumstances there would be objection to the employment of Captain Alban in the dual capacity, he thought the special circumstances of the present case justified his recommendation. On the question of the employment of an Indian, he said that in his view the mixture of hostility and contempt with which the Arabs and Persians tended to regard Indians in the Gulf would make it very unlikely that such an appointment would have the good results which might otherwise be hoped for. As suggested by him, the point was discussed withI understand that Sir D. Bray is satisfied that in these circumstances the point is not worth taking further, but that he has personally impressed his views on the general question on the Resident. ——\ Md 1 n c * ■ d ) ? ■ * 0 By Air Mail , Confidential.

Political Agent, Muscat, telegraphs that Hedgeock has handed in his resignation to Council of Ministers He gives as reason that his levy retrenchment scheme has not been accepted in full and that financial stability of state can only be obtained by his scheme, and that therefore he sees no object in retaining his appointment. He had been informed of intention of Government of India to leave appointment of Commandant vacant for 4 months. His original scheme involved reduction of expenditure amounting to Rs.21,000: economies accepted up to present inclusive of savings on Commandants pay amount to about Rs. 17 T 000» I consider therefore that his attitude is quite unreasonable and agree with Political Agent in thinking there is no object in retaining a dissatisfied official.

The initiative may possibly have come from Sir A. Wilson, but His Majesty met Mr.Thomas in connection with the Sultan of Muscat’s visit and may well spontaneously have thought his achievement of sufficient distinction to merit some recognition. The position in Muscat is a little difficult. The Sultan is an independent ruler in name„ Xn fact he survives only because we help him financially, and because our military backing is available for him in the last resort. But for this the State must have gone under in 1915 if not long before. It is inevitable in these circumstances, that we should exercise a very definite influence in the State, and this is more particularly the case as the Sultan is an absentee ruler who can only with great difficulty be persuaded to visit his Dominions at all. Our task should/[&lt;M should he greatly eased if the Heir Apparent, on succession, proves to have the makings of a competent Sultan, when it will be possible for us to retire to a greater degree into the background# We have a certain responsibility to the Sultan and to the State for the behaviour of Mr.Thomas, who was appointed on our recommendation, and it would hardly have been possible for us, once we realised that he was not pulling his weight, to leave the do not think the Resident aMttWiUW proposesggrfWrey to cut into leave which he has actually earned or, indeed, that he contemplates more than an appeal to Mr# Thomas to sacrifice some of the furlough to which he is entitled under his contractf He recognises, in fact, that the fact that Mr.Thomas is not a Government official makes it impossible to do more# Sultan and the Council in - 0 — (^3 *1 SEE* POLITICAL OGNotes.

A.» Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 16th October 1930, I received a letter from the Political Agent, r Muscat, info mring me that Mr. Thomas had applied for one months annual leave before the expiry of his contract and months* furlough on leaving. 2. In submitting this application Mr. Thomas stated that it was desiraole for him to take this local leave without delay in order to give him time on returning to dispose of his furniture, etc. before handing over, and that he had arranged this with the President of the Council, as Mr. Thomas was entitled to this leave under the terms of his contract, and as his application was dated 5th October, and as he announced his intention of proceeding at as early a date as possible, I did not raise any objection to it, as he would at any rate have been back by the end of November, and would have a clear month in which to prepare the budget and to make the necessary arrangements for handing over to his successor. 3. Under Article 4(b) of the Financial Adviser’s contract it is stipulated that the annual leave of one month is to be spent outside Muscat, the object, of course, being that the leave should be spent in some place where the enclosure in mdia foreign seqse Letter •ci-imaWv would be beneficial to the Financial Adviser’s health. N° JVL ;*L Dated 22 JAN. 1931 Reaehea 9 FEB. 1331 this is somewhat ambiguously worded 1 do not think it£2-f it was intended to restrict the meaning of the word 'Muscat” to the actual precincts of Muscat town, but that it was the intention that the financial Adviser should spend his leave outside the Muscat State, However this may be, on arrival at Muscat in November, I discovered that Mr. Thomas had gone on an exploring expedition to Dhofar. The 'Al Said' was going to take the Wali of Dhofar down to Dhofar and it was the intention that Mr. Thomas should return by it. Major Fowle however now informs me that the 'Al Said' has returned from Dhofar, but Mr. Thomas has not returned on it, but has sent him a letter to the e±lect that he had applied to the Council for one month’s special leave without pay from 1st to 3ist December, as Major Fowle points out, there are no communications with Dhofar except by dhow, which take a considerable time, or by the 'Al Said' whose trips cost a great deal of money, and so no reply could be sent to this application, further, from reports brought back by the 'Al Said' it appears that Mr. Thomas has made for the Huba-al-Khali, leaving Dhofar about the lOth of December. It seems therefore acjrouKHxJfc somewhat improbable that he will return even by the 31st December. 4. I consider Mr. Thomas’ action deplorable. The Muscat financial year ends on the 31st December, and it was essential that he should prepare the budget before the close of the financial year for the guidance of his successor and that he should also put him aucourant on arrival with the current work, and as Major Fowle points out, the leave could not have been taken at a more inconvenient period. Mr. Thomas has received the most generous treatment at the hands of the State, a fact which he does not seem in the least to appreciate, and it&lt;722 it is certainly incumbent upon him in return to give loyal service to the State up to the end, I have therefore asked the Political Agent to inform Mr, Thomas that, in my opinion, the least amends that he can make for his conduct is, on his return to Muscat, to stay on for such time as may be necessary to prepare tihe budget for the coming year and to put his successor in touch with current work, such period being counted as leave and deducted from the 4^- months 1 furlough to which he is entitled under his contract, 5, Were it possible to take any further action in the matter, I would submit proposals to that effect to the Government of India, but in view of the fact that Mr. Thomas is not a Government official it does not seem to me that anyiytjing further can be done, I have etc., Sd.

SEER mxjniLAi comuTOSL JAN Previous Papers 4407 b 1000 3.30 Colonel Biscoe's despatch is self- explanatory. His recommendation, after £CL consultation with^Muscat Council and the Political Agent, is, briefly, that the Financial Adviser should in future devote the whole of his time to financial matters, and should not be a nember^ of the Muscat Council/«* entitled, once the budget^has heerP passed, to raise salaries,or incur expenditure not provided for in the budget, except with the concurrence of the Council. The Council, on the other hand, should be strengthened by the addition, if possible, of two members. It should annually consider the budget presented by the Financial Adviser and approve it (disagreements, if they arise, being composed by the friendly advice/advice of the Political Agent), and it should thereafter he precluded from incurring expenditure not provided for in the budget, except with the advice and concurrence of the Financial Adviser. A further restriction which has been accepted is that it should not have power to reduce expenditure on the Levy Corps from the figure at whicn, consequent on discussion between the Resident and wie local authorities, it has now been fixed (Rs.1,54,000) without prior consultation with the Political Agent (a separate submission has been made on this subject). The case for action on the lines recommended by the Resident is probably a strong one. The retiring r Financial Adviser im a strong personality, with a fluent knowledge of Arabic, who would probably in any case have needed careful handling by the Political Agent. His position was probably considerably strengtuened by t:.e fact that the late Political Agent, 'ajor kurphy, is understood not to have spoken Arabic, and certainly did not enjoy a knowledge of Arabian conditions at all comparable to that of Mr. Thomas. It is unsatisfactory from our point of view that a temporary European servant of the State should, through his membership of the CoimcU^be in a^osiuion^tc organisation of the nature now contemplated needs no justification from this standpoint. .From a different ^ ^ standpoint, it will have te definite advantage of enablinf^e ^ ^ Financial Adviser to concentrate on the financial affairs of the State instead of dealing with its general administration. From paragraph 9 of Colonel Biscoe’s despatch it will be seen that he gives a very satisfactory report of the development of the Heir Apparent.

Functions of the Fi ancial .Adviser, Muscat. Sir, I have the honour tc invite a reference to para graph 4 of my despatch Bo*494* of 16th -eptembcr 1930, regarding the appointment of a new Finanoial Advieer to the Due cat State. 2. I stated therein that I would address the Govern- ' nent of India later on the question of the exact functions to be exercised by r. edgcock, who h&lt;';8 now been selected for this appointment, and as I have nov* had an Opportunity of discussing the matter with the Council and the Political T Agent X submit my views herewith, 3. When Dr.Thomas was first appointed it was decided that he should not be a member of the Council, but within a few months, at the request of Hie Highness, he was appointed a member with the title of ^ezir, and this arrangement has continued ever since. At tiu,t time the Council consisted of four Hu seat members and Mr. Thomas. ince then one* of theseth«oe has died while another has resigned, and of late the Connell has consisted only of 3ayid aid, the heir apparent, heikh Zubwir and Ir.^’homee. The reault hae not been alto gether happy* Sayid Said was till recently a minor; thaikh Zubair has plenty of other work to do, such ae the trial of judicial cases, etc*, and the tendency hae been for the Finance member to take many decisions without reference to the other member* of the Council and also to assume charge of the political and internal affairs of the state. 4 , In a memorandum addressed to me on the subject, hajor Fowle writes as follows:- * 2, If he is tc do his work thoroug ly the Finan cial .Adviser should be free to devote the whole of hie time to financial matters. The Council, for instance, acts as a sort of High Court in gerioue cases: murder, etc* The proceedings of the Court - in Arab fashion - are protracted and the Financial Adviser - as full member of the Council- has to attend the sittings. This is merely one esample, there ere many others, of the way in which his time is spent in matter! other than finance. In this particular instance, apart from the waste of the Adviaer*® time, I doubt personally - though I happen to be a firm believer in capitel punishment - whether it is desirable for a British officer, even though in the employ of the Muscat State, to be a party to the infliction of local death sentences. ' 5, Our aim again is to endeavour to make the State stand on its own feet, but this ie difficult..3 ' difficult with a British officer • tfts conduct of affairs natural!)* drifting into hie own hands - in political oh&amp;rge of the Council* ' 4.From our point of view a Financial Adviser in control of the Council, or at any rate fully sharing in its responsibilities, creates an awkward situation* The Political Agent is responsible to the Politics! Resident for affairs in general in the ITuscat State and should - in personal opinion - exercise whatever political control is necessary* Yet side by side with him tiiere is another British officer - the Adviser - who w^lilds as much, and perhaps in some cases more, influence then he does* Moreover, since the /dvieer is a British officer, though in the service of the state, anything which he does is regarded locally ashaving the sanction of the British authorities, in spite of the fact that he is an independent official not under Irttish control.* 5* X agree generally with these views and consider that it ie desirable to strengthen the Council os much as possible and to endeavour, as Major Fowls puts it, to make the State stand on ite own feet as far as its own internal affairs are concerned; and as long as there is a British officer on the Council it is almost inevitable that more and more power will be concentrated in hie hands and the general direction of affairs be left to him. For the above reas^ne X consider it essential • •essential that the Council aho Id be strengthened and restored to its longer mimbers fand recQ?jmend that Hie High ness the sultan should be invited to noralnate two other members to the Council* The heir apparent, with whom I discussed the matter this morning, informed roe that it was difficult to find fluitsble persona to serve on the Council; at the same time he fully agreed as to the desirability of adding two additional members, and J hope the difficulty will not prove insuperable. should not be a member of the Council. He will then have ample time to devote to the re-organization of the finances of the State, but will not interfere in local politics or budget to the Council in December each year ( the state financial year coincides with the calendar ye»r } and thst it Should then after discussion be passed by the Council; should disagreements arise I have no doubt that they co Id be composed by the friendly advice of the oliticfcl Agent. Once the budget has been passed then the Council should n &gt;t be empowered to incur any expenditure not provided for in the budget except with the advice and concurrence of the Financial Adviser. On the other hand the Financial Adviser shoaid not be entitled to raise salaries or incur expenditure not pro vided for in the budget except with the concurrence of the Council. ay id ’aid informed me this morning that it Vied I further recommend that the Financial Adviser the asms time it will clearly be necessary to establish a modus vivendi between the Council and the Financial Adviser as regarde the control of financial matters. T suggest therefore th t the Financial Adviser should present t e not •••not been customary in the past for a regular budget to be brought before the Council each year and readily agreed to the suggestion that the Council should not incur expenditure not provided for in the budget without the concurrence of the Finaneicl Adviser provided the latter T/r e dimllr*rly bound, and mentioned that in the past soleries had been raised and other expenditure incurred without reference to the Council. 7. in discussing the matter however with the heir apparent and theikh Zufcair, X made one stipulation, and that was that the Council should not have power to reduce expen* diture on the Levy Corps without prior consultation with the Political Agent. I pointed out to them that in the past the Government of Indie had been called on to defend the State against outside aggressions. ven so lately &amp;e last April they had eolieiied the support of the British Government against their rebellious subject, the baikh of 'haesab. told them that oo long as the state had to look to the British Government for protection #nd support the British Government had on their side, in my opinion, the right to demand that the state should contribute their share towards their own defence and the maintenance of order in their own territories. This they were doing by maintaining the Levy Corps, which was adequate for the defence of Muscat and Muttra against everything except a general rising in the interior raid ought to be able to deal with minor distur bances occurring within areas within which the writ of the tate rune. 8. I am addressing to the Government of India a separate despatch regarding the general policy to be pursued in connection with the Levy Corps in the future and am recommending that instead of the somewhat haphazard fashion inin which this Corps has been min of late, a tefinite policy in connection with it should be laid down and a fixed allot ment made for its maintenance# It is this allotment th&amp;t I suggest should not be touched or reduced by the Council except after previous consultation with the British authori ties* 'ihe heir apparent and Shaikh Zubair readily agreed with this stipulation, which they admitted wes in the circumstances quite reasonable. 9. I would mention that I found Sayid Said much developed since I was here a year ago® He is now 21 years of age; evidently takes a keen interest in the affairs of the ttte and discULsee matters sensibly and reasonably® I consider that he is shaping well and should in course of time make a good ruler. 10. I trust that my proposals will be approved by the Government of India, and if so 1 would request that I may be sent early instructions so that the new regime may be in troduced as soon as l.r • Hedgeock arrives i.e. by the 1st January. 11.

As regards the first point, there seems no objection to his travelling via the Gulf, and possibly definite advantage, in that he might be able to call at Bushire on his 2 way out. Subject to your observations, we think he might be told that there is no objection, and that he will be reimbursed actual travelling expenses, ^subject to a maximum of the cost of a first-class ’B’ P. &amp; 0. fare to Muscat.

Department. 44!Ma 5000 5 30 cannot/ Financial Secretary , Mr. Hedgcock, who was recently retrenched from the State Domain Department in Iraq, where he was drawing a salary of RS.22CC, has been accepted hy the Sultan of Muscat as Financial Adviser in that State. The terms offered to and accepted hy him are set out on page 6 of P. 4711/30. The appointment is a charge on Muscat revenues. The present incumhent is a bachelor. He was engaged in 1926 on a five- year contract, with six months’ leave after three years, plus one month's leave a year, and pay of R8.1500x100-2000. Please see Mr. Hedgcock’s letter of 5th October on P. 6922/30 below. I see no objection to the proposal made in his point 1 . There is obvious advantage in his travelling via Bushire and meeting the Political Resident. I imagine, however, that in such a case we should normally pay travelling expenses subject to a maximum of the cost of a first-class 'B' P. &amp; 0. fare to Muscat, would you advise whether this is correct? If it is, it seems the right line to adopt. Point 2 .- Mr. Hedgcock has represented personally that he is going to Muscat on terms very substantially inferior to those which he enjoyed in Iraq, and that he is a married man, ,,r ith three children who are now in process of being educated. He states that hecannot hope to save ariy money out of his Muscat salary, and that it would he difficult for him to maintain two establishments. Subject to your observations, I am inclined to think that the Muscaft State might not unreasonably be asked to pay his wife's passage out. I gather from you that this is a concession which is sometimes given by us in the case of employees for Indian Government service, if we want to get a man and cannot get him otherwise. Mr. Hedgcock is correct in stating that the present Financial Adviser’s conditions do not offer a parallel. He will be the second incumbent only of the post, so there is no precedent. Point b .- Can you advise on this? My impression is that under Indian practice pay starts iron the date of assuming duty. I think the Colonial Office sometimes give half pay on proceedihg to assume an appointment. Having regard to Mr. Hedgcock’s circumstances, I am inclined to think Au -7 f-+*{ f that f he might be granted half pay, or at any rate a subsistence allowance, during his voyage period. He recognises that the period of travelling for whiph he would receive emoluments should not exceed the duration of the P. &amp; 0. passage which he has been offered. Subject to your observations, it is proposed to send Mr. Hedgcock’s letter to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by Friday's air mail. I attach a tentative draft, and should be glad of any suggestions you may have to make.o v ^ q ' 1 6, Shinfield Rftad. 19^0 ^ Reading. Vi / v' 5 5 Octaber, 1930. ix«W L-mIXIs. Wv uic k I should be very grateful if you could obtain for me a ruling on the following three points. (1) According to the terms of my engagement, I am entitled to a $st class B cabin P.&amp; O.fare to Muscat. By travel- ling, via Baghdad and by the slow mail down the Persian Sul-T, i could pick up my kit at Baghdad and also, should he wish it, visit the P.R. at Bushlre. I presume that ^nere would be no objection to my travelling by tails route instead of by P.4 o. As to dobo would be partly for my own convenience, I should not expect to draw from the muscat Treasury more than the cost of the p .4 o. fare mentioned above. (2) May I assume that my wife‘s passage win be paid to Muscat? As Thomas was unmarried, and drew a much higher rate of pay than I shall be drawing, no precedent existts. (3) -.Till my pay start from the day I le ave England for Muscat? m this connection I nay mention that the datef, £• ihx*, i-riAt- originally fixed was postponed for two months owl 11,3 to difficulties in obtaining the Sultan’s consent to ay appointment.

Previous Papers .*- 3287 2000 12.28 M U S C A T : Question of appointment of a successor to Mr. B.S. Thomas as Wazir. Copy to FOR INFORMATION. t Mr. B.S. Thomas, O.B.S., formerly Assistant British Representative in Trans- jordania, was appointed Financial Adviser, Muscat, in April 1925, on a contract for five years, with six months’ leave after three years, plus one month’s leave a year, and pay of Rs. 1500x100-2000. The terms of his service were approved by the Government of India. In 1926 he was appointed Wazir and a member of the Muscat Advisory Council, functioning primarily as Finance Minister, but exercising also a full share in the general government of the State. From the correspondence now submitted (and from the demi-official correspondence between Colonel Fowle and the Resident at Aden on P. ^rj^r/30 below), it will be seen that the Sultan i s/is anxious to extend Mr. Thomas for a further three years from next November, but that the political authorities in the Gulf are in general agreement that - admirable as he is in many ways - he is not quite the man required in present circumstances in Muscat. This is a matter on which Government must to a very large extent be guided by the views of the local author!ties^. ^ough it is unfortunate that the Sultan should be anxious to keep Mr. Thomas on, and undesirable that difficulty should arise with him over the appointment of his Financial Adviser. It may no doubt be assumed that full weight has been given to these factors, and it may be added that Colonel Biscoe tells me privately that he discussed Mr. Thomas with Mr. Howell on his recent visit to Simla, and that the Foreigi Secretary, who had some experience of him in Mesopotamia, agreed that it was desirable to replace him. It.will be seen.that.there is a prospect of securing from Iraq an officer - Mr. Hedgcock - who is being retrenched from the State Domain Department in Iraq, where he has been drawing a salary of Rs.2200. It is proposed that he should be appointed on a pay of Rs. 1200x100-1500. The other terms of his service will be found in the Government of India!s telegram to Baghdad of 28th June, No. 917-N, at page ^. The appointmentfTs not one on which previous reference to the Secretary of State is necessary, and Mr. Thomas appears to have been appointed under arrangements made locally. 23.T-3*INDIA OFFICE, miT^kLL, S. . 1 P, 4711/30. 23rd July, 1930. / / !y dear Lloyd, Vith reference to our correspondence of a few days a^o about the nrofision of a successor &amp; for Thomas of . uscat, I think you may care to see the confidential correspondence between Liscoe, the Government of India and i umphrys, of which I now enclose copies.

My dear Howell, I forward herewith a copy of a demi-official letter I have received from Murphy about Thomas. I do not want you to take any action on it at present, but i should like jfco place my views on record and discuss the matter with you v/hen I come to Simla; and I am sending it on ahead as you may perhaps wish to glance through papers regarding him in your office and give the matter a little consideration before I arrive. I do not know Thomas well, neither have I seen a great deal of his work, but what I have seen has not impressed me with his suitability for that particular post. He is an ardent explorer, a very fine musician a good Arabic scholar and in many ways a brilliant man: he however is impatient of control, and has no idea of keeping slightly in the back-ground and encouraging the Arabs to run the State on their own lines, and as Murphy points out he has reduced the Council to a farce and refuses to put it on a wider basis. He has, I think, little inclination for humdrum routine and the details of administration. The finances of Muscat are as you know in a deplorable condition; Thomas draws Ks. 2000 per mensem-a large salary for a bankrupt State: Belgrave, in Bahrain, draws ks. 1200. If one felt that he was earning his pay by improving the finances it would be different. It may be contended that it is impossible to improve the finances(until, of course, we get the new Customs tariff): in these circumstance and if the Wa&amp;ir can only carry on there seems to be no justification for employing such expensive labour.

I em off to Muscat as Political Agent in a few days, vice hurphy who is going on leave. There is at Muscat as Financial Adviser to the Sultan one Thomas whom you may have met, or at any rate heard of. Thomas has apparently many gifts, I have not met him, 'but is rather too '■brilliant' for the job, and the Resident would prefer somebody else. Thomas is more interested in travel and politics than in the sordid details of finance, which is not what we want. '' T hat we do want is a steady man, (English), with a knowledge of finance - Customs finance preferably, the Muscat State lives on its Customs, and Arabic, who will keep his nose to the grindstone, and be content to save a rupee here and a rupee there. (The State finances are in a badish way). The pay of the post will be about Rs.1200 per mensem. (Thomas draws more but we want to reduce it), with a free house, and certain leave privileges. Length of contract about 3 years in the first instance. Do you happen to know of anybody who would fill the bill? Thomas’going is aot officially out yet, so please don’t mention it, but if you do know of a possible successor I would be very grateful if you could drop me a line, and he could be approaches laoer. I suggested to the Resident that X might write to y*^» and he approved.Muscat of course will 'be pretty warm, but the work will be interesting I think, and one misses 3 months every year at Karachi which is a boon. I saw in a Muscat diary the other day that the indomitable Richards have arrived there from Aden in a dhow. The Bahra Tribunal between Iraq and Hejd is now in the air, and the Colonial Office have put me forward as President; the job ought to be interesting if the Tribunal is ever held, but Bin Baud is trying to arrange matters 'out of court'. It must have been delightful for you to see your family again. I hope they* re fit and flourishing. ,T y wife has gone to Melia with the baby for the hot weather.

They should understand that fact that Hedgcock did not return to Muscat by 30th June is in no way his fault. He was detained here and then went to Bushire to suit convenience of Government of India. Whichever way Council decide, they should be asked whether they desire to make any claim against Government of India for Hedgcock's pay during interval between June 30th and date on which he finally leaves Muscat. 6.

Receivea 24 AUQplBS 1 Please refer to your telegram Ho.l42l-S of 26th May 1931. Instrue tionsInstructions were accordingly given fcfc by Colonel i3iscoe, just before b.e left, to Captain Alban who was on the point of leaving for Muscat, and after the latter had reached Muscat the following telegrams (copies attached) were exchanged between us i 1 , Telegram bo*356 of 13th June 19 31 from Political Resident to Political Agent, Muscat; 2. Telegram ho.137 of i5th June 1931 from Political Agent, Muscat, to Political Resident ,Bushire. 3* I naturally concluded that the Council had inlormed Mr.Kedgcock officially of their decision to dispense with his services, hence my statement to that effect in my telegram quoted above. What was my surprise therefore to learn from Mr.Hedgcock when he had been here some days that he had received no official intimation to that effect (letter dated 14th July - copy enclosed). What he had actually received ^as a verbal intimation from Captain Alban to the effect that the latter was approaching the Council on the subject, and another verbal intimation from Saiyid Said - the President of the Council - that he had received the request from Captain Alcan to dispense with his - Mr..Hedgcock* s - services, but that ne had not yet decided what to do (letter dated the 18th July from Mr .Hedgcock to me, copy enclosed). To clear up the matter while mr.Hedgcock was here, so that I could get his side of the incident straightaway* I telegraphed the Political Agent, Muscat, and the following telegrams (copies enclosed) were exchanged between us| 1 . telegram No.399 of 14th July 1931 from Political Resident to Political Agent, Muscat; 2. telegram No.159 of 15th July 1931 from the Political Agent, Muscat to Political Resident. 5 . It will be noticed that the reason that the Council put forward for not giving Mr.Hedgcock notice is that they expected him back by the 30th June, and that in the meantime he aid not intimate his movements (Muscat telegram ho.159 of 15tn July). This seems a weak argument. It is true that they did not give theirtheir written reply to Captain Alban agreeing to dispense with kr.Hedgcock's services until the 15th June (Muscat telegram Ho. 137 of 15th June), i.e. 3 days after his departure, out they know he had gone to Simla to see the Government of India, and a letter to mt.H edgcock care of the Foreign and Political Department would of course have reached him. 6 . The point is of some importance as if it is finally decided that wr.Hedgcock is to leave Muscat, a new 3 months' notice will have to be given, unless the one mentioned in Captain Alban's telegram (Ho.159 of 15th July), which has not yet been received by Mr .Hedgcock, and whose contents I am therefore ignorant of, can be accepted as such. 7. It will be noticed that there is prima facie some discrepancy between u.Hedgcock's statement and that of the Council. The latter apparently (telegram Ho.159 of 15th July) state that he was allowed to go privately to Simla, while tr .Hedgcock asserts (letter dated I8th July to me) that he went on recess i.e. officially. Whether he went privately or officially would affect the question of his travelling allowance I have ,e tc. , Sd/~ T.C.W.Fowle , Major, Offg. Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf.

Mr. Hedgeock assumed charge oh the 1st January last, and was apparently horrified at the financial condition of the state, which lie described as being bankrupt# He accordingly came to the conclusion that, if the budget was to balance, drastic econoraies must be effected, and he further decided that the Levy Corps were greatly over paid and before rny other economies could be effected it was essential ••••mummnua that the pay of tfie Xeeiee ehouXd be reiuoei, und he de^imnded trim the CoeL^ndant a reduction of in the Levy budget# hut »Ululated further th*t the hooic pay of the eopoy v «duoh waa fixed at H»«50/«» per Mefi«ert« muet he reduced ty a#Si/»# contend-t^»t otuereiee he would he unable to call on other dep* rtuoent* to mice eacrifices* i^r©looked diocuseione took place between hi rseelf and Captain allcer and* the latter under protect end oeoauee he wae told that the elate me hankr^tt finally agreed to this propoeal, but elated that it would produce dieoontes^t and afiect the morale of the borpe# 5 # Sarly in february* i arrived in ^ueoat and came to the eonelueiou that uo draetic a cut in the laeii’« pay wae not justified* either by the ter^e &lt;n their contract* or by the financial position of the elate* &gt;or laacy years past the condition of the Stueeat itate mi^ht hare been doacribed by a financial purist ae one of bankruptcy* but 1 «ae hope* ful that the reduction in die -H^hneun* alioeance* increase of revenue from a revised tariff and the more efiicient octroi of the cue teas in befcar and Sur and other acaeure* mijht produce an increase of revenue* and I did not consider that it was fair to the servin^-t-ien of the Corps to effect such a large redaction in tueir pay* A» l dl ecu seed the matter at ooneiderable length with Cupt in alker and ilr.Hed^cook, and it was finally figreed that a cut should be made in the basic pay of anu further that a reduction of rates of ^oob^eundue! pay should also be ei'fected* the total reduction in may eases therefers bein £&gt; hs«4/«* . hs redviction in tise basic pay coult bs Justified on the &lt; round of the fall in the coet of livii^j;, and Captain alker assured me tlmt this reduction would wot create •••»create any discontent in the Corps# I m*y mention that the original sanctioned strength of the Corps was 240, and it has now been reduced to 150* no further reduction in the number of personnel was therefore possible if the Corps was to retain any value as a fighting force. Captain talker further agreed to effect many other reductions in the number of followers and non-combatant personnel and p total reduction in the levy budget of K»#12p000 was agreed to. 1 also stated my willing ness, not as stated in Mr# Kedgcock* s letter, to agree to ? further out in pay later on, but, if the financial position made it absolutely necessary, to consider further economies in the -^evy Corps towards the close of the current year. 3 , I left Muscat in the belief that the matter bad been settled and accepted by both parties. Shortly after my return, however, to ray surprise 1 received a letter from the Council now stated that the political gent to the effect that the/financial position was worse than had been rnticipated and informing me that the Council asked for a further cut in the men’s pay. fhis request was supported by no figures, but rasrely by some \ isolated notes from Mr. Medgcock, snowing there had been a decline in the customs receipts. The political i~gent did not support the request. I considered however that it would be desirable to give e considered reply to the Council and I therefore instructed the iolitical Agent to obtain from Mr. Hedgeook a revised budget estimate to substantiate the contention that the finances of the state did actually necessitate such drastic measures. Cou*aunications with 4usest are very slow and it takes at the shortest three weeks to get a reply from there, and by this time it was the end of March and I left for Delhi on a visit to the Government of India. I had submitted a report regarding the reductions inthe government «rf Xndie-vtfte m !•■•■••• OVA ' , i Bo.99-3, dated the 5th h.reh 1931. I had however made n official report of this further reiueet of the Council to the clovernment of India, eince the pieco-meal fi«uree supplied to me gave me no material for doing so, hut 1 discussed the matter verbally with the Government of Inaia and w»e ,.;iven to understand that my action was approved, though a further cut was deprecated. 6% iurther, while at Jelhi, the question arose ef a successor for Captain .alker, the com.iandant of the Levy Corps. Captain «liter was anxious to proceed on leave without delay and difficulties were experienced in obtaining a sueoessor for him. I therefore suggested that with a view to still further assisting the finances of the state, the yoet of Coauandant should be left vacant for 4 months, juring the summer the men are given furlough and the Commandant normally proceeds on recess to India for about 2 months and, in the special cireumetanoes of the case, 1 considered it feasible that the post should be left vacant for 4 mo the. rhie would effect a further economy of -s.5000, molting Hs.17,000 in all as against the ’%.&gt;) Re.21,000 originally asked for by Ur. Hedgoock. On my way back from Karachi to hushirs 1 received a telegram from the Political Agent informing me that dr. iiedgcock hau resigned his appointment, though, as reported in ny tele gram referred to above, he has subsequently agreed to postpone a definite decision in the matter for a montu. l now come to dr. i.edgoook'e letter oi toe loth April to the lolltioal Agent and to hie letter of resigna tion addressed to the /resident of the Council. 1 can only say that 1 consider these two documents extremely • • • •unfortunately worded# ^r* Hedgeock etatee that the only reasons tl iven to him for not sanctioning the full reduction in pay demanded by him were sentimental ones* * rur^onti have been given above and cannot be so described# he refers to the second cut promised by moi stated above i never promised a second cut# i merely said that, if the financial position towards the end of the year snowed it to be absolutely necessary, I would give further economies m consideration. In the latter latter My, Hed&amp;cock refers to the divergence of opinion between the Cfovernment of India t*nd himselfl this should, of course, be the i olitic&amp;l Resident and himself* .^hen I went to Muscat dr# Hedgeock had uoen t :.e; e -ona :t ' n ■ : - and Mity of his figures were obviously provisional! since then I b&amp;ve been endeavouring to i,et figures out of him in support of his various contentions, but as kajor . owle states, he has only produced them In piece-meal form, whieh conveyed nothing, and it is only with considerable difficulty that iLnsjor fowls has et length succeeded in obtaining from him some sort of revised budget estimate# a* X think Mr# iedgcock 4 s reference to the Government oi India, in his letter to the president of the Council, is mont unfortunate* It is hrrdly calculated to improve the relatione subsisting between Government and the State, who will naturally draw the conclusion that the financial woes from which they suffer are entirely due to the hard-nearted- nese and lack of sympathy of the British authorities whereas, of course, the exact reverse is the case, and no state owes more to the British Government at the present moment than the state of Oman. 9.

Sir, In continuation of my telegrams Kos. 110 and 113 of 11th and 13th April respectively, I have the honour to forward herewith Mr. Hedgcodc* s letter of resignation to mas he has sent in another to the Council of Ministers. 2. X have already in my above quoted telegrams given my views on Mr. Hedgcock's resignation* i.e. that it should he accepted and that he should stay on the two or three months he proposes to the Council until the new Financial Adviser • a Sited for hy the Council - is procured. In any case - though he has not yet signed any contract with the Council* (for the reason • as he told me • that he thought it a bad one from his point of view), he could hardly throw up his billet at a moment’s notice. 3. On general principles it is not advisable to try and retain the services of a dissatisfied and disgruntled oiiicial and the tone of his letter is sufficient to show • besides various examples I have had of it here - that Mr. Hedgcock is both. He states for instance that his and the Council's letters^have not sc much as been aciaiowledged u • There is no object in 'acicnowledging' a letter until the recipient is in a position to taice action. All his letters have of course been sent on by me, but as I pointed out to Mr. Hedgcocic more than once ( but without result), his method of supplying information piecemeal in separate communications* each of considerable length* is bound to lead to a 'wood which c&amp;nnotbe seen for the trees*• This is exactly what has occurred* I endeavoured to give a financial picture of the state by summarising his letters in my }Io*S3-C of 25-3-1951 • There were* however, still some points not clear, and on receipt of your Ho*T* /^) I asked j£r* Hedgcock for the summarised information required by you* Instead of being pleased at the *acKnowlodgment* of his letters in the very practical form of an enquiry for mere light. Mi** iledgcock in reply informed me that he was not going to discuss the Levy Budget any further, and that he intended to resign* I told Mr* Hedgcock that whatever his reasons might be for resigning I did not see why he should refuse to give the information asked for, and finally after a long conversation I persuaded him to come and talk it over with me next morning* Kext morning, however, brought not Mr* Hedgcook, but a note from him to the effect that 11 on second thought? he had gone back to his original view that he would discuss the Levy Budget no further* 1 think I would have been quite justified in leaving the matter there, and reporting to you that Mr* Hedgcock refused to give the information asked for* 1 do not think, however, that a Political Officer is paid for standing on his dignity if anythin^ is to be gained by stepping off it, and so as Mr* Kedgcock would not come to see me I went round to his house to see him, and after another long conversation persuaded him to change his views* I suggested a schedule form with some notes as the most convenient way of presenting the information required* Mr* Hedgcock produced the schedule, and finally - after some further persuasion ( he stated he did not like his figures being ’queried*) - his notes* to In order to assist him and/ endeavour to get the letter ready * • for the mail I offered to have copies of his schedule, notes and letter of resignation typed in my office, which was accordingly done* 4* I have given the above incident in some detail as it shows clearly the frame of mind in i hich Mr* Hedgeoek now is* Another reason against his continuance here is that • since committing himself to a moat pessimistic view of the financial future oftliC State after the Political Resident's visit in February - be fofrS shown a certain indifference to tx~&amp; possibi i-i. ty of increasing t he State's revenues* ben I visited Gwadur in connecUon with the murder of Ghulaa All I su^eated to Mr. Hedgeoeii that he should accoeipany me* not in connection #ith the murder of course but to investigate financial conditions on the spot. The sloop which was talcing as would doubtless give him a passage too# and lie could accompany ms basic on the mail* special arrangcraents for diverting which would be made# thus involving a minimum of absence from Muscat. He said he would rather not come. Sohar, which previously he regarded as a possible source of extra revenue# he no* dismisses as such. He my be right but he cannot say for certain until he has been there and made investigations on the spot. I h&amp;ve suggested this to him pointing out that the deposition of Sheilch Hamad affords an excellent opportunity for listening of the revenue administration there. He seems luke-warm# however* about a visit and talks vaguely of talcing up the question of'the provinces in the Autumn'• 5. Briefly there is all the difference between a Financial Adviser who is 'all out* to increase the revenues of the State* and one who - because he has comnitted himself to a certain definite rophecy of bankruptcy - eeea his prophecy in danger of being nullified by any unexpected increase of revenue. kUr* Hedgcock seems to me to te in the latter position • adraittedl a difficult one. 6. I do not wish it to be thought that my strictures on Mr. Hedgoeck are in any way actuated by personal feelings# er that X do not recognise his good qualities# or tnfc e&gt; f — : l '- crK he has dene here. If indeed my personal relations had not been most friendly with him I could not successfully have taken the action mentioned in para 3 above# and thereby «KiW©u hiia irOiii putting himself in a false position. He i^. &amp; caps.Die h^rd working financier and following Mr. Thomas has a difficult fob to tackle. But he is 'temperamental* - though he does not look It, i»i*tuou. and impatient. Hie habit of putttn* up him cat at-Tefir' of letters, anmrentlv as freshr~\ arguments occur tc hisi # has not a little complicated the situation* 7. If it is decided to accept Mr* H©dgcociC , s resignation it should not be difficult to find a successor* The terms offered by the State are good, though 2£r* Hedgcocic is dissatis fied with them, (para 2 above), nor should his successor find his task a difficult one after the investigation which Mr. Hedgcoek has made with the various departments of the State* In fact Mr. Hedgoock v 8 term of duty here might be regarded as the visit of a Financial Expert, (such as is uhe fashion now-a-days for most small countries to receive), who has made certain financial recommendations, vfhich have to be weighed against certain other considerations, (e*g* contentment of the armed forces of the State), and which will gradually be put into force as circumstances permit. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- T.G.ffowle MaJor&gt; Political Agent x Il.h.M’s Consul, Muscat* P. . Mr.Hedgcock has at the last moment, suo more , handed me another letter, his resignation to the Council, for forwarding to you* I have no time to comment on it. I have informed him that I cannot, of course, let him have a copy of my despatch to the Political Resident as it is confidential*Muscat 10th April 1931. My dear Major, When I came to Muscat 9 the State was bankrupt; since then, in spite of a number of small reforms, the financial position has become worses revenue has steadily fallen, and the State’s liabilities have increased by over Rs.50,000. In order to prevent a complete financial breakdown, I drew up a retrenchment scheme which in my opinion would quickly enable monthly expenditure to be met from monthly income. In putting this into effect I had expected to be able to rely on the help and co-operation of the Government of India; the reverse has been the case. The crux of this programme was a 12-$# cut in the emoluments of the extremely well-paid, not to say over-paid, Levy force. This reduction was approved by you, by the Council of Ministers, by myself and by the Commandant, who made a reservation, not strongly pressed, that the cut in pay might lead to discontent. The Council of Ministers, with their wider knowledge of local conditions, did not uphold this objection; nor did you. \'\ As you are aware, the political Resident on his visit here on February 15th sanctioned only a 5^ reduction. Had cogent arguments been advanced in support of this decision, I should have accepted them even though personally I might not have found myself in agreement; as it was, only 1 sentimental reasons were given me. With due respect I venture to submit that a bankrupt state cannot afford to entertain reasons of this nature. Since that date, the Council and myself have written to the Political Resident pointing out that the financial situation is more serious than he thought it was on his visit here, and asking him to sanction at once, instead of in the autumn, the second cut promised by him. Up to date these letters have not so much as been acknowledged. It is perhaps difficult for officials of the Government of India, accustomed as they are to think in crores ofrupees, to realize that a mere matter of two or three lakhs is of yital importance to a small State such as Muscat* I wish to assure you that the Council regards with considerable alarm the country*s growing indebted ness, and is at a lost to understand the Government of India*s attitude in the matter of the Levy budget* ]?or a bankrupt State to ask for no more than a 16$ reduction (a reduction of 39$ has just been sanctioned by the Council on the crew of the State’s gunboat) on the average expenditure of the last two years seems to me a most moderate demand, the more so as the economies can be effected by pruning extravagances which ought not to have been allowed to exist, and will neither reduce the numbers of the force nor impair in any way its military efficiency* I have now spent three months and ten days in trying to obtain the sanction of the Government of India to what I consider essential for the realization of my retrenchment sheme. Anything short of this will not enable the State to pay its way* At present I seem to be as far from success as I was at the beginning* In the circumstances it seems to me that I am doing no good to myself or to the Government I serve by remaining in charge of Muscat’s finances while my financial advice is consistently disregarded by the Government of India* I see no other course open to me than reluctantly to tender my resignation from today’s date. Yours sincerely, Sd/- S*E*Hedgcock.Ministry of Finance, Muscat* 14/4/31. My dear Major, I enclose a copy of my letter to the President of the Council of Ministers giving the reasons for my resignation. I should be obliged if a copy of this could be attached to my letter to you on the same subject, and both sent to the Hon’ble the Political Resident by today’s mail. I assume that you will let me have a copy of your reply to the Political Resident on the question of the revised budget and its relationship to the Levy budget. Both these matters are of close official concern to me, and both were the cause of my resigna tion. It might save future misunderstanding if I saw a copy before despatch. Your sincerely, sd/- B. E. HedgeockMinistry of Finance, Muscat. n/ 4 / 31 . My dear Sayid Said, Ref. our conversation of today, during which I told you that I had tendered my resignation to the Political Agent. My reason for this step is the divergence of opinion between the Government of India and myself on the question of Muscat’s finances. The former seems to think that the financial position is much less serious than I have stated it to be, and apparently for that reason is unwilling to make the reduction which the Council has asked for in the pay of the Levies. At the same time, it seems to be expect ed that the State of Muscat should make considerable reductions in the other much lower paid branches of the administration. ( See P.A.’s letter dated 18/2/31). From the outset I realised that the Government of India attached much importance to the maintenance of an efficient Levy force in Muscat. Hence, in spite of suggestions to the contrary, the Council at my request agreed that there should be no reduction in the numbers of the force; in addition, the budget approved by them included a provision for the long-delayed re-armament scheme of a sum five times greater than that sanctioned in the previous year. Strictly speaking, the state of the country’s finances do_es not jja stify ^the very moderate sacrifices which the Levy authorities have been asked to make, and had it not been for the Government of India’s known interest in the force, much greater economies would have been demanded. As it is, the two alternative proposals now before the Government of India have been kept to the lowest possible minimum consistent with the c oymtry* scountry’s 'bankruptcy* These are, as ;y ou are aware, (1) A 16^ reduction (made up of approx, 10% on un necessarily extravagant expenditure, and 6% real economy) on the average spendings of the last two years, provided that the sepoy’s pay is reduced by Re. 5 p.m. and that of N.C.O.’s 1 pro, rate* The sepoy’s present pay was fixed in early pre-war uays, and is out of all proportion to prevailing rates; the reduction is further justified by the recent marked fall in the price of living. This is the method I should prefer, as it enables me to make the cleanest and most satisfactory job of the proposed retrenchment scheme. But, as I mentioned to you some five or six weeks ago, we cannot press the Government of India to make this Rs.5 reduction in the pay, if they are convinced of its unwisdom; hence, we must offer a reasonable alternative. (2) This alternative is a 22%% reduction on the average expenditure of the last two years, free of any stipulation as regards reduction in pay. The increase from 16^ to 22%% is due to the fact that the lower the pay reduction in the Levy, the lower it will be in the other departments, and this loss must, if the country is to pay its way, be compensa ted for by asking for aa higher percentage cut in the Levy expenditure. So far, the Government has not accepted either alterna tive, nor given adequate reasons why these moderate proposals cannot be met. Instead, the best offer it can make • • •make is a budget of Rs.1,19,000, which total has only been reached after negotiations extending over 14 weeks. As this budget represents only 10£^ reduction on the previous two years* expenditure, and includes a cut of Rs.2 instead of Rs.5 in the sepoy’s pay, it will be seen that it falls considerably short of the Government of Muscat’s minimum requirements outlined above, and does not enacle the State to meet current expenditure from current revenue. (A telegram has just been received saying that there will be no British Commandant for four months; but as this is only a temporary saving, it is excluded under para 3 of my No.S.17/3 to the P.A. from the 16/ or reduction mentioned above.) It seems to be expected, however, that this Gadget Rs.1,19,000 should prove acceptable to the State, as its total is less by Rs.2000 than the compromise budget approved by the Council on 2/2/31. Now that budget offered a very much more generous compromise than Muscat’s insolvency warranted, but it could be justified if the two main objectives were achieved, viz. (1) the Rs.5 cut, which would allow of substantial reductions being made in the other departments, and (2) Quick acceptance by the Government of India, thus enabling the rest of the retrenchment programme to be put into effect without delay. Neither of these points was gained, in fact the delay under (2) has cost the country several thousands of rupees. Consequently the State of Muscat is no longer in a position to afford the compromise figure. From the first ( see my note to the P.A.dated January 26th) ....I made it clear that the point of primary importance was not the amount of the reduction in the Levy budget, but the manner in which it was arrived at. The failure to appreciate this point is the reason of the present impasse. Though the immediate cause of my resignation is the Levy budget, my disagreement with the apparent policy of the Government of India is actually based on more funda mental issues, into which I need not enter in this letter. As regards your request that I should continue to serve your Government in the capacity of Financial Adviser, I am £ fully prepared to reconsider my resignation, if and when the divergence of opinion referred to in the first paragraph of this letter has become less wide than it is at present. Yours sincerely, S.E.Hedgeock. Saiyid Said bin Taimur, President, Council of Ministers.• ^ !4711 i - '• , (32.6 i Copy of demi-official letter,Gonfident-ial ljTo.47-C, v ^ dated 8th April 1930, from Major G. P.Murphy,Political Agent at Muscat to the Hon’hie Lt,Colonel H.V.Biscoe,Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I am forwarding to you officially a letter from His Highness with reference to an extension of Thomas’s service$ I do not know what your views on the subject are, but personally 1 am by no means satisfied with the present regime. The Goncil of Ministers now consists of A (1) Saiyid Said- a boy (2) Shaikh Subair-what the Americans would call a 'yes” man} more of a courtier than a statsman. (3) Thomas. In 1928, when Shaikh Rashid, the chief kazi died, I was told by 'Thomas that his successor Isa bin Saleh was not appointed to the Council because he did not get on with Saiyid Mahomed, the then President of the Council. In 1929 Saiyid Mahomed died and I once more spoke to Thomas who said Isa bin Saleh did not get on with Shaikh Zubair and tnere was no other suitable person who could be appointed. This seemed to me absurd. I recently discussed the matter with His Highness. Highness fully agreed that more Ministers were necessary and said that he had often told Thomas so but that Thomas had objected. He said he would appoint some more but so far nothing has been done. The Council as constituted means that in the absence of the Sultan, Thomas, when present, is virtually * the ruler. This seems to me highly objectionable as it throws on us all responsibility for what is done by the Council. Thomas is a capable man in many -ways. He has x ability in dealing with Arabs, but he is not invariably sound and does not tolerate restraint. He was largely responsible forfor 'bringing trie Sur situation to a head in 1927. His seizure of an Arama sarnhuk caused friction with the only section at 3ur well disposed towards the State, whilst his subsequent declaration of a fine of £s. iOjOOO on the Arama and his letter to the Bani Bu Ali calling on them to assist in recovering the fine, was ill advised, to say the least. His action on this occasion was ta^en without the approval either of the other members of the Council or of myself. It no doubt furthered the trip from Sur to Dhofar he undertook just subsequently. His chief interest is in exploration with its kindred subjects and where his own interests are involved they will alv/ays be placed first. The vital question at the moment is finance and supervision over finance is essential, but I would feel more confident with an officer who kept his nose to the grindstone and confined his attention and energies to finance than I do with Thomas in spite of his abilities. A less highly paid officer would seem to me more in keeping with the financial resources of the State. I should like to see a little more responsibility placed on Arab Ministers but with a masterful character like Thomas they would undoubtedly be overshadowed. I think too that if a junior officer were appointed here he-would find the situation intolerable. Thomas would certainly take xxxgs: charge; he has tried it with me once or twice. Under the circumstances, I have misgivings as to the advisability of continuing the present regime for another three years. I shall be glad to know #iat your views are and whether you would approve of my officially taking up the question of increasing the number of Mini sters.Summary of events leading to the termination of the services of Mr. S.E. Hedgcock as Financial Adviser to H.H. the Sultan of MUSCAT In December 1930, on the recommendation of Sir Francis Humphrys, High Commissioner for IraQ.&gt; and by the advice of the Government of India, the independent State for Muscat appointed me to the post of Financial Adviser. On arrival I found my predecessor exploring in the Ruba’ al Khali, the accounts in a state of confusion, and the State of Muscat heavily indebted and on the verge of bankruptcy. The representatives of the Government of India in the Persian Gulf looked to increasing the revenues as the means of restoring Muscat to solvency. An examination of the State’s financial position maae it clear to me that no y such increase could be expected, but thaton the contrary there would be substantial decrease. This substantial decrease duly occurred. Muscat’s one hope of solvency lay in retrenchment. The Council of State favoured an all-round pay reduction throughout the administration, provided that the Muscat Levy Corps, in which the local representatives of the Government of India were much interested, took the lead. On my arrival I found this Levy Corps almost a public scandal. One sixth of the country's income was being spent on a small force of 150 sepoys, whose military training had2 . been so neglected that it had next to no value as a fighting unit. (iii.G . there had been only one machine-gun practice in four years, with the result that no-one knew how to fire the guns with which the Levy was provided.) Thepay of the rank and file was exorbitant, and the number of highly-paid non- combatants excessive. In addition, I found that the Commandant, a British officer on loan from the Indian Army, had been guilty of financial irregularities which were later shown to have escceeded £1,000. Judged by prevailing rates of pay, a 25$ reduction in the emoluments of the rank and file would have been justified (before I left Muscat this reduction had been enforced in the case of recruits), but in deference to the high regaid in which the Levy Corps was held by the local representatives of the Government of India, the Council of State on my advice asked for a 12-&amp;$ reduction, this being the minimum that would produce a balanced budget. I made three unsuccessful attempts to persuade the local representatives of the Government of India that Muscat's solvency depended solely on retrenchment, beginning with the Levy Corps, In the first, my financial advice was disregarded although as Revenue Secretary to the Government of Iraq. I had been responsible for revenues fifty time the size of those of Muscat. In my second attempt, I explained the whole financial situation in a despatch (No.524 of February 24th) which I asked to be forwarded to the Government of India for a decision. ihis despatch was not so forwarded. On my third attempt, the Political Agent himself sent a despatch (No.830 of 25/0/31) which by misleading statements and suppression of facts so distorted the matter as to make it quite impossible for higher authority to appreciate the true position in Muscat. In April 1931, I thus found myself confronted with thefollowing alternatives; (a) to acquiesce in the unsound financial opinions of* the local representatives of the Government of India; these were hound to result in a deficit, which the Government of Muscat, not of India would have to make good. It is an ironic facx that haa I adopted this course I should still he regarded as a fit person to hold the appointment of Financial Adviser to the State of Muscat. (h) To protest against such unsound opinions, a protest which if successful would secure x^uscat’s early solvency. This course would result in personal unpopularity, and might have serious consequences for myself if my facts or financial forecasts were at fault. In the event , all my facts and financial forecasts proved to he true. I considered that the State for Muscat had engaged and was paying for an Englishman as Financial Adviser in order that he should not only give expert and disinterested advice hut do his utmost to ensure its adoption. I thus felt bound to follow alternative (h). Accordingly, as the only means I could see of ensuring Muscat’s early solvency I tendered my resignation to the Council of State as a protest against the conditions I found in Muscat. I was asked hy the Council to reconsider ray resignation, and as soon as I learned that I had at last reached the Government of India, I withdrew it. I still do not see what other course I could have adopted Matters had to he righted, delay in doing so spelt hank - ruptcy, yet the local representatives of the Government of either India were unwilling/to admit that their own method of4 administration was at fault, or to allow me to refer the question of Muscat's finances to higher authority. The outcome of my resignation was that in June 1931 my previously rejected financial proposals were accepted in toto by the local representatives of the Government of India These reforms were put through quite smoothly, and were unattended by the predicted disasters. As a result the State of Muscat, in spite of a much lower revenue, began to pay its way for the first time in three years. At the same time, I was informedthat my services were to be terminated from June 30th the reason given being that I had shown an attitude unfriendly to the Government of India. had the Government of India continued to insist that taxation should be increased, in a country already impoverished by fifteen years of drought, in order to pay for an unnecessarily extravagant administration, I should have pressed for the acceptance of my resignation. But as it seemed to me illogical for the Government of India to accept all my proposals, ana then to dismiss me, I left for Simla in order to explain the situation. At Simla, in two long interviews with the Foreign Secretary I explained that any unfriendly feeling between the two countries was due not to myself, but to the local representatives of the Government of India, who had tried to force upon the Council of State an unduly swollen Levy budget. The Council while fully prepared to maintain the Levy's existing strength and efficiency, wasresentful that their moderate request for a reduction of IS-^ in the emoluments of the Levies had been rejected without adequate enquiry or reason, and felt that the Government of India did not sufficiently sympathise with their financial embarrassments. (In order to meet the pay of the Government servants, resort had to be made to forced loansfrom local merchants, and at one time the total cash resources of the State were less than £16, and my own pay was three months in arrears.) Relations were further strained by the manner in which the Levy Commandant had flouted the Council's authority, and by the suspicion that his adminis tration of the Corps was not only extravagant, but dishonest (e.g. the Levy budget which the Council were asked to accept included provision for 12 personal servants (8 wholetime) for the Commandant). I was told by the Foreign Secretary that I had done the in right thing/the wrong way, but to my question what, given the conditions I found in Muscat, would have been the right way, no answer was forthcoming. As a result of these inter views, my case was referred to H.E. the Viceroy, who caused a letter to be written to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf requesting him to smooth matters over, as it would be difficult to find another official who had the interests of the State of Muscat so much at heart. I regarded this as tantamount to reinstatement, and as far as I coulci gather that was the general opinion in Simla also. As requested by the Foreign Secretary, I returned to Muscat and made an exhaustive enquiry into the Levy accounts lor the past three years. Three months later I was again informed that my services had been terminated, this time for a different set of reasons. (a) That my retention as Financial Adviser was not desired by the Muscat State. On the contrary in their letter of April 16th the Council expressed a wish to retain my services because of the efficient and energetic way in which I had carried out my duties.6 . -'-N ( 12 ) (13) (b) that the resignation tendered by me on April 10th and accepted by the Council in their letter oi July £5th must be considered as operative. In point of actual fact this letter of July 25th neither accepts nor makes any reference to my resignation; on the contrary, the Council had accepted the withdrawal of my resignation (Vide telegram dated 15/5/31.) I was further informed that the above decision was final, and that I was to leave Muscat at once. That two errors of fact should have found place in the brief telegram terminating my services suggests that the important (to me) question of my dismissal had not been fully investigated. It is a fact that an oixicial oi over fifteen years’ experience was dismissed without any proper enquiry having been instituted. The termination of my services could only be due to one of the following reasons (a) The commission by me of a fault sufficiently grave to warrant the extreme penalty of dismissal, in that case, a charge should have been formulated impartially investigated, and proved. No such charge can be brought forward, I have fulfilled the primary duty of a Financial Adviser by producing a balanced budget, and in his letter dated 12/10/31 the Foreign Secretary states 'in my opinion the circumstances in which you leave Muscat convey no reflection whatever either on your integrity or ability'. (b) A misunderstanding on the part of the Government of Indisioue to the submission to it by its subordinates of incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information.(c) The convenience of the Government of India. It was suggested to me at Simla that the local representatives of the Government oi India would feel embarrassed hy the continued presence of a junior (though in this case not subordinate) official who had proved them to be wrong in the matter of Muscat’s finances. I therefore feel that in equity I am entitled to some form of apology or explanation for the manner of my dismissal, and to compensation for damage to ny professional reputation and loss of livelihood.

HhiDGCOCKTranslation of a letter No.30, dated the 5th October 1931, from the Council of Ministers to H.H. the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat, to Captain P.G.Alban, T.A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat. After compliments. At an auspicious hour we received your letter No.C-207 dated the 21st September 1931 and noted that you have been instructed by the Hon’ble the Political Resident to inform us that the Government of India have decided that, as the retention of Mr. Hedgecock’s services as Financial Adviser is not desired by the Muscat State, the resignation tendered by him should be considered to be operative. We have acted upon the advice of the Hon'ble Government respecting the termination of Mr. Hedgecock’s services with the State of Muscat and Oman for the reason given in his resignation. We concurred in the suggestion of the Hon’ble Government and dispensed with his services. There is no doubt that we are ever ready to follow' the advice of the Hon’ble Government in the interest and welfare of the Government of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. We are aware that the Hon’ble Government desire nothing but the welfare of our State. As agreed we have paid Mr. Hedgecock three months’ pay and passages to England for himself and his wife. He has no further account with us and asyou are aware he has left Muscat. We trust that the Hon’ble Government have no doubt that we are ever desirous of strengthening the friendly relations existing between us. Usual ending.Mr S.E.Hedgcock : Ter.aination of services as Financial Adviser, Muscat. 1) The following extract from the Foreign Secretary's No D.O. F.228N/31 of 24/7/31 shows that the Government of India were trepardd to over-ride Colonel Biscoe's objections, if the State of Muscat desired my retention as Fin nclal Adviser. m You were also told that if Colonel Biscoe did not raise objections, the Government of India would them selves be ready to forget what had passed and to smooth things over. Colonel Biscoe'a ansv.-er amounts to this, that he would be quite ready to fall in with the suggestion of the Government of India if he were satisfied that you were really the right aan for the post and that your re tention would be in the best Interests of Muscat On —• — - given, n. ../,J &gt;at, fled. Things being in this position, as you must -e, there could be no other solution than that the Muscat State Council should decide.' On 21/9/31 the Muse it Council of State was Informed that 'the Government of India have decided that as the retention of Mr Hedgcock's services as Financial Adviser l ’- not desired by the Muscat State, his resignation ten dered on April 10th and accepted by you on July 25th must be considered to be operative.” 3) A short time ago I received from Muscat a copy of the 3)2 Council ctate*s No 30 of 5/10/31, vfoich in effect is an official denial th&amp; the Government of Muscat either accepted my resignation or expressed any desire not to retain my s rvices. ) An examination of the available evidence will show that by word and by deed the Government of Muscat did the utmost they could, situated as they were, to retain my services. (a) When I first resigned, the Council 0f State were offered the services of a Government of India official in my place. They declined this offer, and expressed instead in writing their satisfaction r*© «• with my services and asked me to consider my resignation. (b) When 1 eve ntually withdrew ay resignation, its with-drawal was accepted 'with auch delight'. (C) When the Council of State were 'advised' to termin ate ay services, they undertook to pay ^.y return expenses fro* Muscat to Simla, to enable me to appeal in person against what they v.nsidered an uujusx, aecision. AU these facts see* to point to a keen desire on the part of the Government of .ruscat for the retention of ay services. In the ;id 0 of August last, a carefully guarded ques tion was put by the Govern*ent of India to tne juscat Council of State as to whether they wished t. retain ae. The question was so phrased that if the Council asked definitely for a.y services they night find their request refused - an ignominious position which they were anxious0* 6 ) ?) to avoid. Hence they returned an equally guarded rep^y, to the effect that they ha^ terminated ay services at the request o'* the 3-overnment of Indiaj but if the Government of India nov held different views tney would be ^^adto kno T what t iey were - in effect an invitation to the Govern ment of India to recommend my retention. It is possible for the Government of India to ar^ue that the Coun lids guarded and non-coia iittal rt-piiea to their quest! unacco a ni ed as they were by any comment on the part of the local representative of the Government of India, left them free to put what construction they lilted upon them. In actual fact, the local representative of the Government of India at Muscat su^eated to his immediate superior that the Government of India should be informed that the Council of dtate were lore in favour of my re tention than their non-committal replies su^ested. Tula message, however, was never .onmunicated t c Simla. The last point may need elaboration. In his letter dated 29/6/3;, the Foreign Secretary informed the Offg.Political Resident that my case was under reconsideration. The in- formation contained In this letter was not forwarded to Muscat until the middle of August, with the result that my personal statement that my case was under re-consideration remained vfitiiout official confirmation °or six weeks. This lacx of official confirmation naturally made it impossible for me to take over my office on ray return to uscat on July 26th. The delay in communicating the contents of the Foreign Secretary's ..etter of June 29th undoubtedly pre judiced me in the eyes of the Council of SwaUpand a,pt. AljcUi, the acting Political Agent, Muscat, reclined this. His igtkBK telegram of/ 9/9/31 ; forwarding the Council's answer to one of the Government of India's questions, con- oiuded with the suction that 3i:nla should be informedI 4. that the Council’s replies wnuVl have heen aore definite^/ in ny favour had there not been such a I013 delay in forvaarding to Iluscat the contents of the Foreign Secretary 1 ;' letter of 19/6/31. This nessa^e was not passed on to Si da. The Off£* Puliticau. Ke.i’ent “or rarded the bofy o' C &gt;t.

I a., reluctant to iaai.o person.cl accusations, but I think that in fairness to my^seif I should point out that the official at Bushire who was responsible for the delay and non-transmission of the two oumaiunications mentioned above was the Some who, when stationed at Muscat, by sppressin^ information which should ^ ve -one Political Rcsi .ent, eventually caused Me to resinu 8) ^hen I told Saiyld Said that I was leavi 13 Muscat beoause c-n^ retention of my servl ce f ras no longer desired by tlie Muscat 'tate, he v-.^s indignant, and declared that he had never, verbally or in writing, officially, unofficially, or priv^ofciy, rvoresged a •;ish for ^y departure; and he added ~ kj -* r ^ Ui,cJr tiie Sultan hi r written to him hoping that the Govern .ent r laOie ;rc S t,, retention as PinmciaX Adviser.

Cl / Please refer to your demi-official letter ho.B.128 -h /31 of 5th October 1931, which - in connection with the termination of rledgcock’s services with the muscat State - quotes three occasions on which the Government of India./ are of opinion that they have some grounds of complaint as to my action in the matter. 2. With regard to the first occasion. I have explained the circumstances under which Hedgcock mentioned to me the matter of Walker’s irregularities, vide paragraph 10 of my letter No.427-S of 15th July 1931, ana the vague recollection I had of a casual illusion to Walker’s dhobi, or punkawalla, being partly paid by the State. In view, however, of the opinion expressed by the Government of India on this point, I can only express my regret that further action w&amp;s not taken by me. 3. With regard to tne second instance. As you point out I have already dealt with this in my letter i.o.562-3 of 31st August. That the Council’s attitude towards Hedgcock was in no way affected by the omission to inform them of the abeyance I am perfectly certain. They had their own reasons for feeling resentment against him entirely unconnected with any action of mine, (vide paragraph 5 below), and when they had been finally informed E.B. Howell, Esquire, C•S.I.,C.i.B., foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. enclosure IN INDIA FOREIGN SECR^h ° v-j 11.86 .i. Letter 1 Dated 24 DtC 1931 Dat Received 11 JAM. 1932 *informed as to the question of abeyance on or about the 13th August (vide my telegram Ho.468 of 27th August) it did not make any ailference to the views as to his retention in their employ which they expressed some weeks later (my telegrams Ho.468 and 481 of 10th September). 4. With regard to the third occasion. 'The facts are as follows: Wylie’s first letter of 29th June (enclosing your letter to Colonel kiscoe of 23rd June), which - owing to the air mail being delayed - did not reach Bushire till 6th July, said clearly “after full discussion with hedgcock trie Government of India may oe furnished with your considered views'. This could only mean that 1 was to conduct the investigation, ^y telegram Ho.390 of 6th July, to which you refer, quotes this letter and goes on - it is true - to suggest Amiscat as the place for the investigation, but merely because the relevant papers were there. It also says that 1 would meet hedgcock at muscat, which surely indicates that I had the intention of carrying out the investigation? four telegram in reply Ho.698-U of 7th July, i.e., sent after the despatch of Wylie’s second letter, informed me that Hedgcock had left Simla intending to leave Karachi for Bushire by the fast mail of 5th July, and that you had no objection to Hedgcock accompanying me to Muscat. There was nothing in the telegram to indicate that Alban was to carry out the investigation and not me. Keagcock arrived here on the 3tin July and had the relevant papers with him, at ail events sufficient to make possible the beginning of the investigation. As 1 wanted to finish the investigation quickly in order to allow Kedgcock - if possiole - to leave Bushire by the next down mail of tne 11th, I started on it immediately. Wylie’s second letter of 2nd July came onon the 9th. It said 'In the meantime it has been suggested to Hedgcock that he should go to Bushire and after preliminary discussion with you secure from you a direction to tne Political Agent, muscat, to investigate the charges of financial irregularities against Walker* he will then return to Muscat to get the necessary papers ana put up the case to Alhan at Muscat. ' i submit that tfylie s iiist letter contained a categorical instruction, ano. the second referred merely to a 'suggestion' 1 maue to hedgcock, while the latter had the necessary papers with him. i therefore use my discretion to commence the investigation myself. With regard to my retention of nedgcock. In the event 1 was unaole to finish the investigation oy the ilth, and asked Hedgcock if he would mind staying on another week. He said he was quite content to stay on in Bushire where he had fans and ice rather than go to Muscat, before he need, where he had neither. By the 18th I had finished investigating three out of the four charges, and had decided that the fourth would nave to be investigated by Alban at Muscat where the material for this particular item was on record, nedgcock accordingly left oy the down mail of the 18tn, ana X reported progress to you in my letter Bo.429-3, dated the 1/th ouly. ^y retention of him, with his own concurrence, therefore lasted one week, from the 11th July, which was the first steamer he could have travelled oy, to tne 18th July, wnen he actually left. With regard to my omission to inform the Council of State as to the reason for Hedgcock*s retention. On the' 11th July I sent the following telegram to the Political Agent, Muscat: '’Hedgcock has come here and I am Ccirrying out investigations with him. Shall not be coming to Muscat at present.'. Also when nedgcock left here on the 18 th13th July, oy the same mail I sent Alban a copy ol letter ho.429-£of 17 th ouly quo tea above, which explained in detail that riedgcock ana I had been carrying on the investigation in question. Moreover Hedgcock himself on arrival at Anscat coula, ana presumably did, inform the Council of why he had been delayed in Bushire. In these circumstances, I cannot imagine that the Council’s final opinion as to his retention, which they did not give until more than 6 weeks later, vide ray telegram i.o.481 of 10th September, can in any way have been affected oy his week’s stay in Busnire* That Heagcock had reason for making his peace with the Council is explained below. That he failed to make it was of course his own affair. 5 . If the attitude of the Council towards Hedgcock changeu after his aep&amp;rture from ^miscat, this was entirely uue to his own action. He was allowed by the Council to go to Simla on the distinct understanding that ne would return before the 30th June, viae telegram Ho.159 of 15th July from tne Political Agent, Muscat, quoted in paragraph 4 of my letter Ho.448-S of 20th July. He left Muscat on the 12th June, arrived Karachi on or about the 15th, and I suppose Simla on or about the 18th. Presumably he had an interview with you on or about the 19th. At any rate on the 24th he wired to Alban the one word 'successful', which lea to my telegram to you Ko.369 oi trie same aate. He wrote to Alban a letter which reached Muscat by the mail of 30th June saying that he was going to Bushire by the fast mail of 5th July from Karachi. But the Council ne seems to have ignorea completely, neither writing nor telegraphing to tnem to explain why he was aelayed and to ask for an extension. In fact the first the Council apparently heard from him was his telegram from Karachii^raciii oi &lt;ind oul/, (i.e. two days after he should have returned to ^.uscat) , quoted in my telegram ho • 148 of 3rd July to you, asking for tnei r permission to proceed to 3ushire. In other words towards the Council Kedgcock observed neither the ordinary iorms of courtesy nor of official procedure, and it is not surprising that the Council resented this and that they replied to his telegram by telegraphing to him at Karachi that his journey to 3ushire could not be authorised by them (telegram ho.159 from the Political Agent, Muscat, quoted above). There was also the matter of the discrepancy between a statement of hedgcock’s and tn&amp;t of the Council, as to a conversation he had with them before leaving muscat, vide paragraph 7 of my letter ho.448-S of 20th July, which presumably did not improve matters between them. The point I wish to emphasise, therefore, is that Hedgcock* s unpopularity with the Council was due to events which had happened before he came to Busnire, and which consequently had nothing to do with me. i aui giving a copy of this letter to Colonel Biscoe. fours sincerely,a I ?t|:49/30, &gt;oi»nlng ^ July, 193* . i&gt;«ar 3yaea, : oward has passed on to ise the letter \returned herewith/ in which 1owle sought your assistance in finding a successor to the present occupant of the post of In^noi a idwiser to the Sultan of .uaoat.
