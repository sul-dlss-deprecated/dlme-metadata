It contains copies of correspondence between the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Admiralty, regarding whether or not Britain should give a formal response to what is referred to as being an informal claim made by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. The issue is discussed with reference to recent incidents involving Arab dhows in the Gulf.James Sidney Barnes, writing on behalf of the Lord Commissioners of the Admiralty [as Principal Assistant Secretary], advises that there should be no formal repudiation and that British officials should avoid any action that might in any way compromise the views of His Majesty's Government on territorial waters.In addition, the file includes a copy of instructions, produced by the Foreign Office and relayed by the British Legation, Tehran, regarding the attitude that should be taken in the event of the arrest of a British subject by the Persian authorities at the outer anchorage at Bushire.The file concludes with copies of correspondence regarding instructions for searching Persian dhows that are suspected of arms trafficking. Other correspondents in the file include the British Minister, Tehran, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000a2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
