S. “ Swfitsure.” I have the honour to submit the accompaying letter from the Commanding Officer of H. M. S. “ Dartmouth” with reference to his perfunctory search of a Kuwait dhow, and to request instructions as to whether, in view of the latest Arms Traffic Diary (No. 15-Period, 24th December 1913 to loth January 1914) Kuwait dhows are stiil to be regarded as being immune from search. Dated the 27th January 1914. From—The Officer Commanding, H. M. S. “ Dartmouth,” To—The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, H. M. S. “ Fox.” With reference to Article 28 Persian Gulf Memoranda, I have the honour to report that I boarded a Kuwait dhow at 3-20 P.M. yesterday (26th january). She stated she was on her return journey from Verawal to Kuwait, but her papers did not bear this out, although otherwise they appeared to be in order. Her cargo consisted of firewood and sand, the latter stated to be for ballast. I made a pretence of searching her in accordance with Article 28, and allowed her to proceed. The Head Tindal, who was acting as Interpreter and who has had great experience of the Arms Traffic, considered the cargo suspi cious, in which I agree.No. C.-I 4 , dated the 15th April 19M. From—L ieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, LA., Political Agent, ’ To Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honour to reply to your endorsement No 1023, ammunition. 2 I would first observe that no case for such resumption appears to have been Established either from the events reported in Papf -m ^th y^ur endorsement or from the contents of the fntelhpce Officers dtaries to which reference is made by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chiet. 1 he names of the Bum and the Nakhuda are not given by the Intelligence Officer, and the most that could be proved against the Nakhuda appears to be that he attempted to sell two rifles from among those that he is permitted to carry for the protection of his vessel and her crew, which although an offence and one which would doubtless be punishable by the Shaikh were the case brought before him, scarcely amounts to a definite instance of smuggling arms or a contravention of Sir Mubarak’s undertakings with His Majesty s ^Government. In regard to the dhow detained by H. M. S. “ Dartmouth ”, the circumstances in which she was considered to have been suspicious are not fully stated and they were apparently not sufficiently convincing to enable the Senior Naval DfiRrpr i-n authorise a systematic search on that occasion. 3 . H. M. S. “ Fox” called at this port on 29th ultimo, and I discussed the Intelligence Officer’s reports with the Senior Naval Officer. He informed me that he hacf no further information in this connection either from the Intelligence Officer or from any other source, and we agreed that it would be sufficient to bring to the notice of the Shaikh that there was reason to suspect that Kuwait dhows were still concerned in this illicit traffic. I did so, and His Excellency^assiired me that he had given most stringent orders that nothing more of this kind was to be attempted by his subjects. He suggested that in cases of suspicion, which must of necessity now be of rare occurrence, the Captain of His Majesty’s ship should either place some person on board the dhow to remain there until she arrives in Kuwait as had formerly been proposed, or that the Captain should inform the Political Agent, Kuwait, at once so that the dhow might be watched for and inspected immediately on arrival by one of the Shaikh’s trusted officials accom panied by a representative of this office. His Excellency went on to say that whatever might have been the case formerly he wished us to understand clearly that he was now working hand in hand with His Majesty’s Government in every thing and hoped that we would take him at his word. 4. Referring to Sir Percy Cox’s telegram to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, No. 149, dated 7th June 1912, it may be remarked that the majority of the reasons given by him for considering that the alienation of the Shaikh and his community would be particularly undesirable still hold good, and they are strengthened by the addition of our proposed water scheme and the approaching ratification of the Anglo-Turkish agreement in regard to Kuwait. It would obviously be deplorable should the reintroduction of the measure which of all others would tend to produce such alienation synchronise with the event last named. 5. At the same time I do not mean to suggest that any relaxation of vigilance on my part or on that of any one else concerned is to be recommended. I am making continual enquiries in regard to the import and export of arms and ammunition but so far am convinced that with the possible exception of the export of two or three rifles and a small amount of ammunition at rare intervals nothing is at present taking place. 6. In all the circumstances I am of opinion that it would be better to make no change at present in the direction under reference.3 No. 1202, dated Bushire, the 26th April 1914. From— MAJORS. G. Knox, C.I E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf&gt; To—His Excellency Rear-Admiral R. H. Peirse, C.B., M.V.O., Commander- in-Chief, His Majesty’s Ships and Vessels, East Indies, H. M. S. “ Swiftsure. ” In continuation of the letter No. 960, dated 1st April 1914, which I had the honour to submit to Your Excellency on the subject of the resumption of the systematic search of Kuwait dhows, I have now the honour to forward herewith the copy of a letter No. C-14, dated 15th April 1914, from the Political Agent, Knwait, to my address in which he deals with the question. 2. I have the honour to state, (1) that I am in general accord with the views expressed in that letter, (2) that I am by no means convinced that arms smug gling into Kuwait by sea is carried on on a scale that can in any way be regarded as extensive (3) that, although it is possible that Kuwait may from its existing stocks feed the small Persian ports to the north of Bushire, any action by sea would merely drive the trade into the creeks on either side of the Shatt-al-’Arab and therefore be ineffective, and lastly that, although we cannot be indifferent to the arming of the Shatt-al-’Arab riverain tribes and the country between the Karun and the Bushire-Shiraz route, no action by sea is likely to prevent this and I think there is small likelihood of such arms being transferred to Afghanistan or the Baluch frontiers which are, after all, the main objects of interest to us. 3. For these reasons, I would deprecate any resumption of the systematic search of Kuwait dhows. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department.warn® CONFIDENTIAL^ m - \ C I o No. 362, dated Bushire, the 2nd (received 10th) February 1913.

In my letter No. 309, dated 31st December 1912, to Your Honour, I informed gon conclusion that I had submitted your request to Government and would inTdfm you directly I received their reply. This has now reached me and the purport of it is what I thought it would be : Government remind me that their concurrence in the import of 6,000 weapons from Maskat to Kuwait was accorded on the specific understanding that these arms would bear the Maskat warehouse mark and they direct me to explain to Your Honour that they cannot regard the objections of your subjects to the marks as being a valid one, and that such an awkward and far-reaching precedent would be created by any relaxation of the warehouse rules in this respect, and the matter is so important, that they much regret that they are unable to countenance it even from Your Excellency. They trust therefore that you will be able to make your subjects see the groundlessness of their hesitation and oblige them to take the weapons if they need them with the warehouse mark duly stamped on them. This is what had to be explained and salaams. Dated 14th Safar 1331 (=22nd January) (received 30th) January 1913. From— Shaikh Sir Mubarak-es-Sabah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.L) Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf. I had the honour to receive your esteemed communication dated the 21st Moharrum I33i=3ist December 1912. Your Honour had expressed the hope that I will be satisfied with the explanations contained in your previous communication dated the Zilhijjah 1330 (15th November 1912). I, your dependent, confide in, and abide by, your order ; and it is only necessary for me to represent my requirements and press ing needs. When I have brought these to your august notice, the order will then rest with you and my mind will agree to whatever that you may command. As to my need of weapons for my subjects, the townspeople and the tribes men, it is as I represented to you verbally during your visit to our side in the month of Rajab 1330 (=June-July 1912). I possessed your permission for wo thousand and five hundred and I postponed taking advantage of it in view o y ■'s - ^ fpetition for the completion of the six thousand. No mention of this (warehouse) „ , mark was made (at that time)* and I only • Not quite accurate. He specifically expressed , j . his readiness to wait until after ist September and represented to Your Honour rny arrange* obtain through warehouse. ^ ^ ^ ment in regard to the affixing of my brand on the arms, vzs., that those which we distribute amongst our subjects, the townspeople, are marked with their brand as well as mine, and that those which are distributed amongst the tribesmen bear only my mark ; and Your Honour approved this. We have acted upon this arrangement since we have used these weapons, for they do not go abroad and are kept only amongst our subjects, and we seize those which bear the mark and which we find with any one besides our subjects. We trusted that the quantity which you would be good enough to sanction for us will be dealt with according to this arrangement. As I told you (above) it is necessary for me to bring our requirement to your august notice, and if you see fit to concur and to agree (well and good), otherwise I am obedient to your order and approval under any circumstances whatever. As regards our requirements for six thousand weapons per annum, we have already addressed Your Honour on the subject, and it is for you to decide. But as regards that which is intended for trade, I will check it in compliance with your orders and will not consent that it should enter my town at all. Now I submit two courses to Your Honour While those who require arms for their use notice that they are available at Qatar and that they are thence brought by the A 1 Bu Ainein whose habitat is adjacent to that of our tribesmen (ranging) from my town to their neighbour hood, he who so desires, will bring 4-5 (weapons) for himself and for his children and relatives ; and they will likewise bring for anyone who orders them. If I check them and seize those (weapons) from them, they will contend, saying r&lt; we will not bring them ; but you should bring for us.” I do not wish however, that such articles should enter our town and its environs except with your approval and under your supervision. This is one course, and the second one is this :— Out of the 2,281 weapons which we had already received 857 bore the mark while the rest were unmarked. Those bearing no marks were distributed amongst the subjects, but they are not sufficient for their number. Those bear ing mark have been kept by us in the Customs since their arrival as our subjects do not agree to use them. If you order us to do so, we will return them to Maskat to be sold ; or possibly our brother Shaikh Khazal will, owing to his need for arms, accept them at their price and pay their expense if you permit us to do this. We advised our dependent and your servant, Haji Najaf, to leave Maskat for our side, but a letter was received from him by this mail, stating that with the permission of our friend, Major Knox, he has contracted for twentyTour lakhs and twenty-five thousand cartridges and paid one thousand and five hundred pounds out of the value and that it is necessary for him to remain there for the purpose of making references to the manufacturer and paying the balance of the value. Now it rests with you to order as to whether your said servant should stay there or not. This is what had to be said and we trust that your sincere regards will con tinue. May you continue to be preserved. No. 53, dated Bushire, the 1st February 1913. From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, To— His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait. After compliments. Your esteemed letter of 14th Safar (=22nd January) has duly reached me. Just before receiving it I had despatched to you my letter No. 41 of 29th January explaining the views of Government and their difficulty in complying with your request.The point is that the marking of the arms is not for any special purpose connected with your honoured self or your dependents but is an item of the general rules in force at Maskat, and to waive the rule for you, would be to give rise to numerous applications from other importers of arms ; it is for this reason that Government find it impossible that His Highness the Sultan should make any exception. I trust that in view of what they expiain, you will now see your way to relinquish your objection to the rifles being marked. As regards Katar and Kasar-es-Subaih, Government are not unmindful of the circumstances, but we are doing what we can in the matter and there seems reason to hope that these sources of illicit supply will soon cease.

It will be seen that the Sheikh returns to the attack pertinaciously. mPTir ^©ostensible reason which he now gives for pressing his request is that, as new patterns of rifles appear, his dependents like to get rid of their old ones but tins is one which can only weigh with us as an additional ground r^^i al vTr nS - CaptailL Shake spear thinks the real reason •?! ^ u mrak cannot, as may be expected, guarantee that no weapon will ever go astray, however good his intentions may he/ and fears tiiat snould this happen he would be held personally responsible and have his personal good faith placed under suspicion. 3. It might he possible to humour him and still serve our own purpose by agreeing to his purchasing direct from England from an approved firm and bv our then arranging with the firm in question for the stamping of the weapons With a secret mark which would he known to us hut not apparent to the uninitiated ; hut I think Sheikh Mubarak will in all probability bow to a reply from Government to the effect that they cannot regard his dependent’s obiec- tions as valid and that as the permit for import was given on the definite under standing that the arms would be supplied hearing the Maskat warehouse mark, ey cannot see their way to agree to any other arrangement, and I recommend that such an answer be given. 4. ^ As to his further request for an annual permit for 6,000 weapons, in my opinion it would be greatly in excess of his legitimate requirements, and the existence of a demand for ^ so many annually would seem to presuppose the existence of a habit for their irregular disposal ; hut in reply to his present letter I would he inclined either to ignore this request, or reply that his require ments would be considered as they arose. I venture to request the favour of a telegraphic reply. Translation of a letter dated 26th Zilqaadeh 1330 (— 7th November 1912) from Sheikh Sir Mubarak es Subah, K.C.IE., Ruler of Koweit to Ueutenant-Qolonel Sir Rercy Cox, K.Q.I.E., C.S.L, Political Resident m the Persian Gulf After Compliments—1 represented to your honour before this as regards the arms sanctioned for us by the exalted Government owing to our pressing need for them, viz., firstly two thousand five hundred, and then three thousand five hundred, to complete six thousand, according to our , request. When Your Honour visited our port in the month of Hajab 1330, (== June-July), I represented to you that I used to put my mark on the weapons since former times; that those which I distributed amongst my subjects, the townspeople, are also marked with their brand along with mine; t at those I distributed amongst my subjects, the tribesmen, only bear my mark and that the object in affixing the marks of my subjects, the towns people, is that I take the weapons from them when need arises and return the same to them when there is no need and any one can distinguish his weapon r a i S maik because the rifles are all of one pattern. When the consignment of 440 arrived and bore the warehouse inscription, my subjects, the towns-2 people, did not agree to take them oyer unless they (the rifl.es) should agree with the previous arrangement and custom, and I represented this to Your Honour and received a good answer. I wished to satisfy them, hut they declined and did not agree. I found them frightened by this inscription which was (affixed) on the rifles and they had an argument. I represented their argument to our friend Captain Shakespear and noticed that they (my subjects) were in the right. What is deemed by me, your sincere friend (to be fit), is that facility should be afforded to them in this their trivial requirement and that you may order that the inscription should be dispensed with. Otherwise, I approve all what you see and order (to be fit) because your commands are all good and advisable, and we have found them to be so. This is what was necessary and it is hoped that your kind attention will endure and that you will remain preserved and guarded. No. 252, dated Bushire, the 15th November 1912. From— Lieut.-Col. Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Excellency Sheikh Sir Mubarak es Subah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Koweit. After Compliments .—I have received your esteemed letter of 26th Zilkhadah (=7th November 1912), in which you further explain the dislike of your subjects to having the Maskat warehouse mark on the rifles imported by Your Excellency for them. I am still unable to see any sense or sound motive in their objections and it seems to me that if they continue to object after receiving from you, their Euler, the explanations which you received from me and which satisfied you, it is evident that they are not in serious need of the arms. . 1 assure you, my honoured friend, that it is quite impossible for any excep tion to be made in respect of arms now exported with our concurrence from Maskat, and if your subjects are unable to appreciate the importance of the matter and to accept weapons with the Maskat mark, I can only surest that you should tell them that they can do without them. This is what had to be explained.

The divine vessels are also increasing every year and all my subjects are in the utmost need ot weapons. Of this pattern, which we solicited the exalted Government to sanction, viz., the 6,000, I will take only 600 , and 2,600 will he distributed amongst my subjects, the townspeople, whilst the rest will be supplied to the tribesmen. . -^-S to those who aie now hesitating to take over the rifles bearin 0 * the inscription and about whom you have remarked that you do not find any proper meaning or motive in their hesitation to accept the inscription I will (now) explain their motive to Your Honour. They only disagree to an| objec tion or suspicion against them, for they are men who behave honestly. They have stated to me and to our friend Captain Shakespear accordingly. Since firearms came into use we have changed three patterns thereof, and whenever a new pattern was introduced, we used to buy it—when arms were free—using the new one and selling the old ones to our townspeople and tribes men. Now, several patterns of arms have come into use, one of them beirn* the one firing give shots like the revolver. A few of this have now made their appearance and we have, according to their desire, imported a few thereof, which are included in the number permitted. They wish to obtain from this pattern if it is obtainable. As regards the arms bearing the inscription, the number we have now received is 857 , and they are remaining with me in the Customs and they (the inhabitants) hesitate to^ take them over. The other we distributed amongst our tribesmen. This is their motive and we have represented it to Your Honour. All aie now under your order and if you see fit, in your august opinion, which is the highest, you may grant them 2,600 (rifles) without marks and those which have already been received and which bear marks should remain for me for the sole use of my soldiers. If you do not see any course that there should be no mark on the weapons issued from the warehouse at Mask a and if you permit me to do so, I will be able to order them from London diiect through my friends, so that they may come either direct to our town or we wUl arrange for them to come up to the Buoy (on the Shatt-al Arab Bar) and there be discharged into vessels. If Your Honour does not conceive this (to be practicable) we will not go beyond your control and order. ^ ave represented to Your Honour our requirements for arms and in addition to this, we also solicit an annual grant from the good graces of the Government, because, as Your Honour knows, the increase in the population of Koweit, the number of boys leaving schools, the enhanced number of the diving vessels and their extended trade, require number of 6,000 rifles per annum Now, your servant and my dependent, Haji Najaf, is at Maskat and has withheld purchase owing to the inscription. If Your Honour’s high opinion conceives a course to complete the six thousands without inscription (well and good), otherwise we will advise your servant, Haji Najaf, to hasten to our side, as his detention at Maskat will cause excessive expenses. This is what was necessary to be stated to Your Honour and we beg to hope that your attentions will endure and you will accept my regards and that you will continue to remain preserved and guarded. No. 309, dated 31st December 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Sheikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah, K. C. I. E., Ruler of Koweit. After Compliments .—Your esteemed letter of 2nd Muharrum duly leached me and I have understood all that you wrote. I had hoped that my previous letter would have made it clear to you how it was really impossible for us to arrange for any relaxation, in favour of your4 consignment of arms, of the universal regulations made by the Sultan of Maskat under our advice which require the warehousing and marking of all arms on arrival. At any rate I assure Your Honour that it is beyond my power to accede to your request for permission for the despatch of 2,600 rifles from Maskat without marking. Indeed the British Government have been the more obliged for your co-operation in suppressing the illegal arms traffic, in that they have realized that your action involved some loss of revenue to yourself, and as you know they are always desirous of giving their earnest consideration to your reason able views and requirements; and I am as in duty bound submitting to them your request to be allowed to receive arms from Maskat without marking, but I cannot help thinking that they will find the request a very difficult one to comply with. I am also mentioning your desire as an alternative to import direct from London. It is not hidden from you that the concurrence of Government in your importation of as many as 6,000 rifles with ammunition was only accorded on the specific understanding that they were intended solely for the use of your own tribesmen and dependents, and so long as the arms remain in their pos session according to the intention, I cannot see what valid objection your subjects can have to the arms bearing a mark from which they can be identified. As it is not within my power to comply with your request without first referring to higher authority, and if your subjects will not accept the arms otherwise than with marks, then I think for the present it is of no use for Haji IS T ejef to remain longer at Maskat. I will let you know directly I receive a reply from Government. May you be preserved and salaam. r 187 Telegram P., No. 103 , dated the 8th November 1912 .

From-—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To— His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubakak-bin-Subah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait I duly received your esteemed letter of 4th October 1912 (=22nd Shawal) acknowledging the intimation of the concurrence of the British Government in your importing 6,000 rifles and 400 rounds per rifle including the 2,500 rifles and 6 lakhs of ammunition for which their concurrence was obtained at the beginning of the year. In giving this decision Government desired me to inform Your Excellency of their appoval of the general correctness of your attitude in matters connec ted with the Arms Traffic : hut to explain to you that in view of the largeness of the present indent it would not be possible for them to consider a further one in the near future; and that the present permit is given on that clear understanding. Now as regards the stamping of the arms at Maskat, I hope Captain Shakespear’s explanations to you have made matters clear. Best assured that there is no question of suspicion involved; it is merely a matter of public rules applicable to every one who buys a rifle from Maskat. If I want to buy a rifle from Maskat it must bear the mark and number of the Maskat godown. Clearly the rules at Maskat would be useless if exceptions were made. All such weapons have several marks on them and there is nothing derogatory in their having one more, which is not special but public. So you must free your mind altogether from the idea that this marking at Maskat is intended or considered to be derogatory to any one or originates from suspicion. As I am not sure where you are, I am sending one copy of this to Kuwait and one to Mohammerah, and if you are with our friend Shaikh Khazal please give him my best compliments. I hope this will find you both in the best of health. Dated the 9 th Zilkadah 1330 ( = 20th October 1912 .) From—His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubarak-es-Subah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I had the honour to receive your esteemed letter, dated the 3rd Zilkadah (=15th October 1912). Your Honour had stated that the inscription on the rifles are (affixed) in accordance with your obligatory command and that the object thereof is to show that they are issued from the warehouse and involves no doubt or suspicion. I, your friend and dependent, am firstly obedient to your orders and desires in all circumstances. I only stated this on receipt of the 440 (rifles) that my application was for six thousand, so that I may distribute them amongst the inhabitants and my subjects and tribesmen. I wished to expedite distributing them amongst the inhabitants and to com plete their allotments from the first consignments on which no inscription had been affixed. They (the people) disliked the inscription and I satisfied them that the inscription meant no suspicion. They argued, however, saying “ the arragement was that thine mark and our mark should be affixed ”, and any one who took them used to affix his mark and mine thereon. They asked me therefore to refer to Your Honour, and I agreed to do so with a view to affording them satisfaction. Otherwise I have no doubt that all the orders you issue are calculated (to promote) our interests. Your letter reached me when I was with the brother Shaikh Khazal and I showed him your greetings. He sends you his best compliments and regards.In any further communication on this subject, please quote 35019/12 Foreign Office and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign (Mice, London.

Reverting to my letter to you of the 27th, concerning the smuggling of Rifles concealed in Sugar cases, I am now in a position to give you the details of the whole transaction, which I trust will be of interest, and which may enable Government to take such against steps as they consider best to safeguard/any future cases of a similar character. I will first deal briefly with the transaction up to the time of shipment. Mr. Louis T)ieu - comm.ercial representative - 4 me Trevisse, Paris - bought the sugar from Messrs. Ch. Zuaz. Brussels - who themselves bought it from Messrs. Gevers Bros . Antwerp. Messrs. Gevers Bros received instructions from Messrs. Ch. Zuaz (who were acting on orders received from M. Dieu) to forward 10 cases of each lot of sugar (25 ^) to a certain Mr. Louis de Bms ^128 me Hors Chateau-Liege-Belgium')- and to forward the balance of each lot (15 /) - to Messrs. Reynardt &amp; Co . (Antwerp) forwarding and shipping agents. This vms accordingly done. In due course, Messrs. Reynar&amp;ts received the cases from Mr. Louis de Bms under the denomination n sugar n . Mr. Louis de 1ms (who, as it subsequently transpired is a gunsmith) acting on orders received from Mr. Lieu, packed the Rifles in the Sugar cases. The rifles were purchased, from Messrs. Ijudwic, Loewe (Spandau) and were forwarded by them to Mr. Louis de Bms. The cases, on being returned, were found to weigh 600600 kilos, as agjLnst 689 kilos, when they were sent* Mr. Louis de Brus in his forwarding note acknowledged the difference in weight. Messrs. Ch. Zuaz were informed of this, and they, no doubt, acquainted Mr. Dieu, as Principal, of the existence of such a difference, Mr. Dieu then instructed Messrs. Ch. Zuaz (Brussels) to inform the forwarding agents at Antwerp - Messrs. Reynardts &amp; Co, that shipments were to go forward for Koweit. The first shipment of 25 /per s.s. n C.Fred.Lacisz n oil, behalf of Messrs. Bertie Richmond Co. Ld. and the second shipment of 25 /per s.s. n Moltkefels n on beftalf of Me ssrs. Lewis Cramp ton $ Co. Messrs. Reynardts being informed of this, tendered the goods to the tt Hansa n Line for shipment, and the goods went forward in the usual course - the 'Hansa' Line representatives at port of shipment (Antvierp) filling in the names in the shipping Documents, as customary. This is briefly the history of the transaction up to the time of shipment, and I have put the facts before you to show what an extremely complicated affair it has been, and how Mr. Dieu has endeavoured to cover his tracks by working through various sources. The facts connected with the detection and confis cation of the Rifles you are already acquainted.. I will, therefore, merely deal briefly with the legal measures taken against the shippers. The discovery of the Rifles in the shipment per the n Hansa” line 'Moltkefels n was made on or about the 7th August last year. A wire was at once sent to BremenBremen informing the 'Hansa' of this. I wrote also by the outgoing mail to the Managing Director of the 'Hansa' line, acquainting him with the full particulars, ana at the same time forwarding an °fj i cl cvment relating to the confiseation of the Rifles - signed, by Mr. Gubhay (as Collector of Customs) and attested by the Belgian Consul. The Hansa n line acted, promptly on the receipt of the telegram, as the attached letter, forwarded for information will show. Messrs. Reynardts &amp; Co. being unable at first to give satisfactory information ( as they themselbes were quite unaware of the circuitous manner in which the shipment had been effected) steps were taken, on receipt of the document mentioned, above, to lodge information with the Frocureur da Roi at Antvierp. This vms done on August 23rd, wh/en it was finally requested that measures should be taken under the Belgian ^enal Law (llth January 1907 - 3rd Chamber - Antwerp Court) to deal with the culprits. A close enquiry vms instituted to investigate the facts, which eventually led to the discovery that Mr. L. Dieu, of Paris, was the shipper. - r • Maeterlinck (Avocat - rue des DomAni Caines 1, Antwerp) the Legal Adviser of the n Rlansa n Line, writing on the 5th of June 1912, to the n Hansa n Line'- ”It has been found that Reynardt and Charles Zuaz ”had no responsibility wha ever in the matter. Con cerning Dr. de Bras, no stipulation of our CrimAnal n Law forbids putting rifles in sugar cases. The only person, who w.iffit have been held, respon sible ums hr. Dieu. However, Mr. Dieu being domiciled'in Paris, and having given orders from Paris, Belgian 'justice cannot touch him. 'Messrs. Reynardt $ Co. acting at Mr. Dieu's request 'offered to pay all the costs incurred on account of 'the smuggling of the Rifles, consequently Belgian 'Justice dropped the criminal prosecution, no 'Jurisdiction against Mr.Dieu existing here. ' The 'Hansa' line represent at ivetfat Antwerp, writing on the 9th July 1912, state - 'The suppliers of the sugar here in An twerp, Messrs 'Gevers Brothers ' are very honest people and had, 'of course, nothing to do with the smuggling. 'As to the firms of Bertie Richmond &amp; Co, Ltd. and 'Lewis Crompton Co. we could not obtain any inform- 'at ion on this side, the only man being able to give 'same being Mr. Dieu, in Paris, who of course would 'not give any. The forvjarding agents, Messrs. 'Reynardts &amp; Co, however, suppose that the said Firms 'do not exist in reality, and are only bogus names. 'Messrs. Reynardts also share your and our opinion 'that the only guilty party in this whole matter is 'the firm - L. Dieu in Paris - whom, unfortunately, 'Belgian law cannot touch. ' From, enquiries which I have instituted, on this side, I have not been able to find ant trace of either Bertie Richmond &amp; Co, or Ijewis Crompton &amp; Co. I am,, therefore, of the opinion that these names were merely used- as a blind. You will notice from, the correspondence quoted, that Mr. Dieu has paid all charges incurred. He could have evaded, this, as there was no juris diction acainst him, but I understand he did so, m order to hush the mutter up. TheThe profit to he made in smuggling Rifles is so large, and the risk of getting into serious trouble (provided it is worked in a round-about way) is so small that translations of this kind must form suffic ient inducement to men like Mr. Rieu to try other V' means to gain their wicked ends* It is to safeguard Government, as *qfr as possible, against a recurrence of similar frauds and at the same time to enable Liners to bring the pressure of the Law to bear against fraudulent shippers, that I have now put forward the proposal that Liners should obtain a signed declaration for all shipments ^or India to the effect that the packages shipped fo not contain either arms or qkunition. I placed this officially before the East India Steam, Trade Conference on the 22nd inst. and the matter is now under consideration.V e&gt; FOREIGN OFFICE.

[ 31419 ] No. l. Papers communicated to Foreign Office by Sir E. Slade.—[Received July 24.) ( 1 .) Dear Sir Edmond, Achray, Callander, N.B., July 20, 1912. I HAVE been intending to write to you for some time past to inform yon of the further developments which have taken place in following up the cases of rifle smuggling, which were detected last July and August. I write to enclose herewith a copy of my letter to the governor, who asked me before leaving Bombay to inform him of any further information that came to light, and I feel sure the contents will interest you, showing as they do, what lengths people will go to in the pursuit of illicit trade. I attach also, for your information, a form of declaration of contents of cargo, which the Hansa line adopted, on my suggestion, and which I put forward with the view of preventing further shipments of a similar nature going forward. It has been rather a long joh running the thing to ground, but the various steps have been quite interesting. We found that Messrs. Reynardts were a thoroughly respectable, bond fide, firm of forwarding agents, who had nothing whatever to do with the fraud. Consequently, steps were taken to ascertain the legal position in dealing with the British firms whose names (Bertie Richmond and Co,, and Lewis Crampton and Co.) appeared as shippers on the bills of lading. The Hansa line were advised that it would hardly be possible to convict British shippers in London for an offence apparently committed in Antwerp. This brought the matter for the time being to a standstill. I then suggested that steps should be taken to ascertain from Messrs. Reynardts from whom they received the goods, who the packers of the goods were, and who gave them instructions concerning the actual shipment of the goods. From the information received, and the correspondence I examined at Bremen, when I was there towards the end of last month, I am satisfied that Reynardts acted in a thoroughly bond fide manner. But, of course, we did not know this in the first instance, and it was only step by step that we were able to unravel the whole tangle, purposely complicated hy the Paris firm of Dieu and Co. (a good name!), who remained in the back ground. Having been up the Persian Gulf with the fleet under your command, in connection'with the reorganisation of the coal bases, having been at Debai, and having been entrusted with your personal confidence, I natuially felt the keenest interest possible to see that this matter was followed up, so as to endeavour to check or prevent any further shipments of a similar character coming for ward. I am glad that we have been able to get at the bottom of the whole affair. The only points that now require clearing up are the connection the two London firms Bertie Richmond and Co. and Lewis Crampton and Co. had in thh affair. This is being now closely investigated, and I hope to have infoimation on this point very shortly. . . ‘ The Hansa line are now exercising the strictest supervision at Antwerp with regard to all goods for the Gulf, and any doubtful cases are being examined befoie shipment (this is for your private, information), so I think that for the time being, one may take it for granted that any further steps to smuggle lifles, disguised in merchandise will be diverted from shipments by the Hansa line to eithei the Indian Lloyd (a new Belgian line, who have no such restrictions), or to shipments by British Lines I would, therefore, suggest that all shipments by the Indian Llo^ d should be carefully watched in Bombay by 11&gt; pr»q storp s especially case goods.

Dieu and others of their calibre may still try the same game again, working it in some other way. It is to safeguard Government against this, that I am now working out an idea, which I mentioned to the governor,' of obtaining a declaration of shipment from all shippers to India certifying that the goods shipped do not contain arms ori ammunition. No respectable firm will hesitate to give such an undertaking. It is only the fraudulent firms who will be affected. I quite admit, of course, that even if such declarations are obtained, it will not entirely prevent fraudulent shippers from pursuing illegal trade, but it will, I hope, be a decisive check so far, that if detected, they will be liable for criminal as well as civil prosecution, and shippers like L. Dieu and Co , of Paris, will not be able to shield themselves in the same round-the-corner way that they have done in this transaction. I have been busy since I have been at home, personally interviewing the chairman and managing directors of the big lines trading with India, and have now got through all the spade work. I am writing officially within the next few days to the Bombay liners conference putting the suggestion before them, and I think they will adont the proposal, which will be a safeguard, not only to Government, but also to themselves. Hoping that this will find you and Lady Slade in good health. With kindest regards, &amp;c. W. GRAHAM. ( 2 .) Before leaving Bombay you told me that you would be interested to hear of any further developments concerning the shipment of rifles (concealed in sugar) which was detected last August. As you will no doubt remember two lots were seized—the first by His Majestv s ship “ Pox,” near Koweit, ex British India steamer “ Palamcotta,” transhipped from the steam-ship “ C. P. Lacisz ”/carrying Hansa line cargo), and the second by the customs authorities in Bombay, ex steam-ship “ Molktefels ” (Hansa line). The goods were forwarded by Messrs. Reynardts and Co., of Antwerp, the shippers, according to the bill of lading, being, in the first case Messrs. Bertie Richmond and Co., and in the second Messrs. Lewis Crampton and Co., both apparently British firms. In order to enable the Hansa line to prosecute Messrs. Reynardts and their principals for false declaration of cargo, I forwarded to them at Bremen, a certificate signed by the collector of customs, and attested by the Belgian consul in Bombay. Ihe Hansa line on receipt of this, instituted legal jiroceedings at Antwerp against Messrs. Reynaidts, the forwarding agents, but were unable to obtain redress from them, as apparently Messrs. Reynardts had acted in a bond fide manner, and had merely forwarded the goods on instructions received. Nor were the Hansa line able to obtain redress from either of the British firms, since it was not possible to convict them in London of an offence committed in Antwerp. Ihe Hansa line then instituted further enquiries at Antwerp. Prom these it was ascertained that Messrs. Reynardts had received instructions rom a I ans firm, Messrs. L. Dieu and Co., to receive certain sugar cases (25 cases m each lot) for shipment. v Of these they were instructed to send 10 cases of each shipment to a Mr. Louis Debru m Luttich (Belgium), for repackino* This they did. w / ihey ° n return th at the cases weighed 600 kilos., as against 689 kilos., but beyona this difference m weight, they did not notice any difference in the cases. difference in 0 wSght. n y them ’ advisin ^ Messrs * L * 1)1611 of Paris of the p • 11 h f s transpired, on further enquiries, that Messrs.

These were packed five m each case of sugar, and returned by Mr. L. Debru to Messrs. Reynardts in Antwerp for shipment. *The whole transaction has purposely been most complicated, and the Paris firm, Messrs. L. Dieu, have covered their tracks in such a wav as to make lesral conviction most difficult. I have just returned from Bremen, where I went through all the correspondence connected with the fraud. I cannot make out how Messrs. Bertie Richmond and Co. or Messrs. Lewis Crampton have come to be implicated in this matter, and I have asked the Hansa line to make further enquiries, which they are doing. The Hansa line have been most assiduous in prosecuting these enquiries and I trust, sir, that Government will be fully satisfied that the affair had nothing whatever to do with the Hansa line. Declaration of Persian Gulf Cargo by Shippers. In order to prevent, or at any rate check any further frauds of this character the Hansa line, on my suggestion, have adopted the attached form of declaration which I forward for information. I may mention also that the Hansa line have instituted a very strict supervision at Antwerp for all Persian Gulf cargo going forward per Hansa steamers. Regarding my suggestion for the larger question of obtaining a similar declaration for all shipments to India. Since my return home I have interviewed the managing directors of all the important lines trading with India (Peninsular and Oriental, Anchor line, City line, Hall line, British India, Hansa line, and Clan line), and hope to formulate a scheme shortly that will be acceptable. Of course, sir, I realise that the adoption of such a scheme (viz., a signed declaration that shipments do not contain arms or ammunition) would not entirely prevent fraudulent shippers from running the risk of shipping ammunition concealed in merchandise, but I consider that it will form a wholesome check, as fraudulent shippers will realise that if detected they will be liable to be prosecuted criminally. 5, Bishopsgate, London, June 27, 1912.

On the 28th May 1912, the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf sent me the following message bearing the No. 67 and repeated it to the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf. On the 23rd and 24th May, two dhows were captured in Charbar Bay 1 y the armed launch “ Miner 9 The name of the first dhow is “ Adetreman ” and she was flying British colours. Her Port, of Registry is Khairan Bandar and the year 1904. She is owned by a Hindu of Maskat, named Pipi. Cassun-bin-Sahib Dud was the Captain of the dhow. Two hundred rounds of ammunition and one Mauser pistol were concealed under sand in the dhow. It is stated by Murad-bin- Chashi, who was a passenger, that ten baskets of ammunition, six Mauser pistols and eight Lee-Metfords were thrown overboard. The Nakhoda was previously convicted of arms traffic. An Indian of Charbar owned the second dhow, and Doda-bin-Carsum was her Nakhoda. One Mauser pistol, openly admitted for sale, was discovered under sand. I submit that the two dhows mentioned above should he destroyed. Eight hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition, two Mauser pistols, and four Mauser rifles, found in the baggage of a resident of Debai, have been handed over by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamer “ Patiala ”. To make an example and to stop the smuggling of arms in small quantities, which is so difficult to deal with and which is now so prevalent, I am of opinion that the dhows in question should be destroyed by fire.

Please see Craufurd’s Diary No. 63 to Chief of Staff for details of all cases First dhow “ Adetreman”. four more pistols have since been found on board I concur in recommending that dhow be burnt. Wakhoda Cassim Bin Sahibdat is an Oman subject but in British employ and arrested in Persian waters. Sultan is not likely to raise question and I recom mend that he be imprisoned in India, if possible. Second dhow “ Chaudan ” it seems clear that pistol was smuggled by Nakhoda without knowledge or conn’iv. ance of owners, and it would be in my opinion too harsh a measure to visit upon latter heavy loss involved by destruction of dhow and cargo.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bandar Abbas, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Dated Bandar Abbas, 6th June. In letters just received but dated 15th May, Political Agent, Kuwait, reports Shaikh exceedingly irritated at treat ment recently accorded by H. M. S. ships to dhows of his subjects, especially five large dhows returning fully laden from Malabar and Yamen and belong ing to four of his most influential subjects. Shaikh says it was not the search that he objected to in principle, but the absence of all consideration for cargo and vessels and public blow to his own prestige entailed by inconsiderate treat ment in spite of his efforts to co-operate with us. He went so far as to speak of forthwith repudiating his arms agreement of 1900. He adumbrated , presentation of claim after verification for 4,000 rupees for damage to vessels and further large claim for damage to cargo consigned to merchants in Kuwait and Basrah. Political Agent endeayoured to make him see oir side of case and induce him to drop talk of abrogating his arms agreement and Shaikh did so on condition that Government be asked to issue orders to the effect that Kuwait boats loaded up with cargo should not be searched at sea Case ^ ere being reason to suspect particular boat, a man should be placed on board by H. M. S. ship and dhow ordered to proceed direct to Kuwait to be unloaded under joint supervision of Shaikh and Political Agent. Shaikh guarantees to make severe example of any dhow or individual detected. I am well aware of great difficulty involved to H. M. S. ships in searching dhows at sea and impossibility of making omelets without breaking eggs, but it would be exceedingly undesirable to alienate Shaikh just now, and I think we need to take a conciliatory line with him. Shaikh awaits definite reply, and I suggest that we regret but explain inevitable incidence of occasional hardship to innocent dhows as in present case, but express our readiness to make good any unintentional damage on being satisfied of its infliction as regards immediate future. Can Senior Naval Officer suggest some practicable course on lines suggested by Shaikh for placing representative on board suspected dhow to accomnany her to port ?

With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram J : Serial No. 73 . ^ 0 ' 135 4th June 1912, 1 have the honour to submit a copy of the letter of assurance which I addressed to the Sultan together with copies and translations of the notification issued by His Highness this day, and of the letter addressed by him in identic terms to the British, French and American Consuls in Maskat. In doing so I beg to add the following observations with reference to my proceedings in Maskat, and the present state of negotiations for the inception of the special arms warehouse. 2 . M hen I arrived at Maskat nearly a month ago, we had ready a complete set of detailed rules for the institution and working of the warehouse, drawn up according to the ideas of the Political Agent and mvself, for dis cussion with His Highness. They were necessarily somewhat technical and legal in phraseology and interconnected one with the other, and we realised after several meetings during the first week of my visit that they were too great a task for the Sultan’s intellect to tackle en bloc. He could not be got to see that if the main issues were settled the unimportant details would easily fall into line and our time was thus wasted in argument over trivialities which merely delayed settlement of the more important points. A constant difficulty was the fact that often, while convinced that some point needed modification His Highness was quite unable to devise any alternative. I, therefore, came to the conclusion that the, only way to avoid indefinite delay was to clear the road by getting out a primary notification intimating the date of the inauguration ot the warehouse, and the principles on which it would work, to be followed ud later by a second notice giving the detailed rules. His Highness was able to understand the simplified draft, and accepted it with little further difficulty; it has since been approved by Government and now issued bv His Highness. The further step thus taken is valuable as far as it goes • it com mits the Sultan his public and the powers with whom he is in treatv relation to definite embarkation on the warehouse scheme (the most trvins- sten for him personally); while during the period of three months law allowed we shall see from which direction we are likely to meet with opposition and how best to counter it. The notification will in any case, I hope, lead to a tempo rary cessation or tresh orders. ^VVNaHSflBflIMSMKi On the other hand, I should like to make it plain that with the issue of tha notification our chief difficulties are by no means over. The Sultan indeed himself seems to feel that he has crossed the Rubicon, and that the rest will be a simple task of adjustment with us, but there is clearly plenty of room left for disagreement in matters of detail, and one cannot‘say more than that the ground has been further cleared. e 3. The point on which, as far as we can see, \ie shall have most difficulty in coming to an understanding is the manner of the supply of the needs of man. In this regard the Sultan is no doubt in a difficulty. His subiects will not unnaturally resent having their freedom to purchase and sell arms curtailed and he will no doubt earn a good deal of odium for co-operating with us in a! scheme from which he received substantial compensation which, however his subjects do not directly share. Again, there are plenty of interested persons ready to ply him with the argument that our motive in restricting the liberty ot the Omani to arm himself is no doubt to reduce the population of Oman to a state ot defencelessness, of which we shall take advantage when oppor tunity ofrers. ° However, I need not anticipate the difficulties which Major Knox or I are hkeiy to meet with—they will develop as the negotiations progress, and we s all do our utmost to subject them locally to a process of gradual elumination before troubling Government. For the present I am leaving Major Knox to pursue single-handed a most difficult task, which, however, I am reasonably sanguine that patience will eventually carry to a satisfactory conclusion. Translation of vernacular letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the address of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, No. 124 M., dated the 2nd June 1912. r I have now received an intimation of the approval ot the .British Government of the notification on the subject of the Maskat arms warehouse, which Your Highness, after consultation with the Political Agent and myself, expressed your readiness to publish forthwith. A copy of the notification is annexed to this letter. The British Government have, at the same time, intLoated their accept ance of the conditions, which Your Highness attached to the issue of the notification. That is to say, 1 am authorised to inform you on their behalf (1) that the British Government undertake full responsibility to give Your Highness all necessary support to dispose of objections which may ensue from the Government of Prance or from other Powers; (2) that it is understood that the institution of the present arrangement does not give the British Government, or its officials, the right to take action m Your Highness s territories in the future beyond what they have in the past y —*» (3) that they are ready to come to a friendly understanding with Your Highness for the devising of suitable arrangements for the suppiy of the bond Jide needs of Your Highness’s administration and subjects; (4) that their undertaking to pay Tour Highness compensation on the lines already agreed upon holds good and is confirmed. In making this communication to Your Highness, I have the honour to express the hope that the said Notification will be issued forthwith in the usual way. Dated Maskat, the 4)th June 1912. From—His Highness Saiyid Sir Faisal-bin-Turki, G.C.I.E., Sultan of Maskat, To—The Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat. Aftet compliments. W ith reference to my conversation with you of a few days ago, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a notification which Ihave issued this day making known to the public my intention to introduce from the 1st September next a special warehouse in connection with the import of arms into my territories. It is incumbent on me by way of friendliness to give you and your fellow Consuls in Maskat intimation of this, and in view of the bonds of intimacy existing between your great Government and myself I am confident that I shall have your cordial support, so far as your subjects are concerned, in render ing the measure effective. Notification by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat and Oman, dated Maskat, the Mh June 1912. Whereas large quantities of arms and ammunition are at present stored without proper control in private buildings, distributed in this our town of Maskat, and thus exposed to the risk of attack, robbery or fire, we impressed by the serious menace to the safety of our capital arising therefrom, have resolved to remedy this state of affairs, in accordance with the needs of the times and the requirements of our municipal administration, by the con struction and establishment of a special customs house magazine or arms ware house for the storage of arms and ammunition under safe precautions. It is proposed to introduce this warehouse arrangement from on or about 1st September next. It will be conducted on the following general lines :— Firstly .—On or after 1st September all arms and ammunition or parts thereof inf ported into my territories will be taken direct from the steamer to the special arms warehouse, to the control of which a special Superintendent will be appointed by us. Secondly .—Similarly all arms-dealers in my territories will be required to deposit stocks remaining in their hands on 1st September in the said warehouse. Any trader offending against this regulation will, in addition to other penalties, render all future consignments of arms and ammunition arriving in his name liable to confiscation, unless and until he complies with this regulation in full. Thirdly .—No arms will be allowed to issue from the warehouse until duty has been fully paid thereon to the Customs Superintendent in the usual way. Fourthly .—The withdrawal of arms from the warehouse will be regulated by the issue of special licenses prepared by the Superintendent and counter signed by myself. Fifthly .—Such licenses will not be granted to traders but only to approved individual purchasers or their duly authorised agents, on the 'production of satisfactory proof that the number, quantity and destination of arms, ammu nition, &amp;c., to be withdrawn from the warehouse are free from justifiable objection. Sixthly .—All arms issuing from the warehouse will be marked with a special warehouse mark and serial number. Seventhly rules will be drawn up providing for and regulating the issue to approved traders of sample stock for exhibition'in their shops. Fighthly .—Rules providing for the collection of arms warehouse charo-es, on stocks therein deposited, will be drawn up on the analogy of the present Customs House Eegulations for the levy of such fees on general merchandise. Ninthly.Syecizl rules will be drawn up governing the transfer between traders’ stocks deposited in the arms warehouse. Tenthly .—Special relaxations will be arranged for in favour of flint-locks muzzle-loading gun powder and caps in reasonable quantities. Detailed rules embodying the above principles are under prepa ration and will be published in due course for the further information of all concerned.

As regards (i), I require further information from Captain Shakespear * Serial No. 84 (1) Political Agent, Kuwait, to No. H8 C., dated the L5lh May 1912. (2) Politic?)!

(iii) 2 . f Serial No. 84 on one or two points before I can offer useful comment and I am also not sure how far the concluding sentences of the Shaikh’s cancelled letter to me [enclo. (iii)] are now intended to hold good. I will telegraph my views on receipt of his reply to my enquiries. 3. As regards (ii), I have already telegraphedf to the Government of India and His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief and merely send the present papers for further information. 4. Enclosure (iii) is the translation of a letter sent over to the Political Agent by Shaikh Mubarak for despatch to me, but subsequently withdrawn by the Shaikh on Captain Shakespear’s advice. Although not now an official document, it seems worth forwarding to Government for information, as indicat ing the Shaikh’s state of mind and the inevitable tendency of our arms traffic operations generally to arouse resentment. 5. The Shaikh’s references to the open door at (i) Katar and (ii) Kasr-us- Subaih are no doubt well-founded in the first case and probably in the second, but I shall endeavour to obtain further information on the point. Perusing all these letters together I cannot avoid the suspicion that the vehemence of the Shaikh’s complaint in regard to his treatment may be partly connected with his desire to import more arms, but, in any case, I think the circumstantial details given and Captain Shakespear’s reference to the feeling created among the inhabitants of Kuwait generally on learning of the experi ences of the five dhows in question, demonstrate that the simultaneous repre sentation of the two matters is more coincidence than design. No. 38 C., dated Kuwait, the 15th May 1912 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward, attached hereto, copy and translation of a letter received by me yesterday from Shaikh Sir Mubarak-us-Subah explaining his request for permission to import a largely increased number of arms and ammunition. 2. The Shaikh’s letter speaks for itself and I need only observe here that the first questions I put in conversation in regard thereto were enquiries as to why the Shaikh had not already taken advantage of the permission accorded six months ago for 2,500 arms and over 6 lakhs of rounds and further how the need for so large a demand had arisen so suddenly.3. The Shaikh’s replies are, taking the latter question first, that the tribesmen acknowledging his authority have grown in number, that a recent ; raid has compelled him to put a properly armed force again into the field, that a large number (as many as a hundred) of new diving boats have been put into commission for the present pearling season, and that, owing to the facility with which the southern tribes having access to Katar and Katif have been able to arm themselves, he is compelled in self-defence to arm iie Kuwait pearl-boats more heavily than has been customary hitherto. Formerly these boats usually carried about eight to ten rifles apiece, but for the above reason it has now become necessary to arm one-half their comple- ments, whilst the boats carrying the pearl-towasbes, who frequently h-ive on board with them over a lakh in either specie or pearls, require to have every man fully armed. J The Shaikh s letter furnishes the repV to my first query—that the arms dL r t i a ibutio COOrded permiss!on are 80 “sufficient as to put him to a difficulty in 4 . So far as I can ascertain, the above reasons given by the Shaikh are true in the “sun. Owing to the comparative scarcity of arms which prohibi- tion ot the traffic during the last two-and-balf years has produced in Kuwait the Shaikh has been enabled to draw into his political sphere as more imme diately dependent upon him a large number of Bedouin who look to him alone tor their weapons and ammunition. The southern tribes, more particularly the Ajman, Bam Hafir and Bam Khahd, have certainly been able to obtain arms cheaply and easily from Katar and the Al-bu-Ainain’s settlement at Kasr-us- Sabaih. Consequently, the Shaikh’s fear for the safety of the Kuwait pearlimr- hoats and their ability to defend themselves with their former number of weapons is not unfounded. The Kuwait pearling-flect probably numbers thario.OoTtotoZ rn aflom ! 1 meaD9 ^ ^ eStimate not that if the Shaikh desired he would not have much difficulty, presuming that the Naval pa.rols continue blockading the Persian coast, in importing double or tiehle the number ot arms he mentions in his letter to me. Moreover, for the ast two years at least, he has been losing what used to be a very lucrative item' , ^ CUS | °J ms r&lt;! ' enU1 :; 11 king all these facts into consideration, I venture to submit that unless Government are prepared to institute a really effective ilockade of the Arab coast as well as the Persian which would have to include search of all pearling-boats, it is a mistaken policy on our part to risk alienating the good-will of a Euler, who, it must be admitted, Pasfor the last ous spirit. ° Ur m the su PP ression of tb e arms traffic in no ungeuer- • 6 ’ ,.?’ he previously given by the Shaikh did not antieinate a ohano*. m conditmns so close to his domains, a change in fact which has taken place 1 ^ lt t hl ' the las j “oaths, and I confess that, when forwarding his requests last summer, I did not foresee the present state of affairs. * „ a a In ® 0 ” clusion ’, 1 urge that Shaikh Mubarak’s request may be accords such favourable consideration as may be possible, and beg that I ^av be furnished with early instructions for a reply to his letter.

The obedience to your approval upon me that is what is necessary. For those who are now wanting weapons, it is not for trading (in ^ them) but that they may be in their hands for the purpose of defence, for^other foreign tribesmen oppress our subjects in our trade, people of the south and others. In these days just past a number of camels belonging to the mer chants, people of Kuwait, Ahmed-al-Hamaizi and others, amounting to 600 camels sent out in the hands of their men to Egypt for trade, the Ajman and their allies took them and besides this also upon our subjects the tribesmen ha ve been many robberies, and we sent our servants to the headmen of the Ajman with letters for the purpose of their (the camels’) restoration ; there returned of them a few, an! the greater part are with them (the Ajman), and all the Bedouin, if they do not see force do not give justice. Now there are in their hands weapons, which they obtain from Katar and from the Al-bu-Ainain at prices of $15 to $18 and the ammunition at $5 a hundred and on our side now weapons are not obtainable and if findable and acceptable one obtains them at $10 to $50 and the cartridges one takes at $12 to $15 and this is the state ; we see in it upon us great damage and it is incumbent upon us that we should explain to you the circustances and the order is with you. Yester day came to me of my own people and the heads of the tribesmen and showed me the amount of their wants of arms and of ammunition. Apart from my own necessities, there is required for them at least 6,000 weapons of various kinds, Martinis and others, and with each weapon 400 rounds and our own requirements, especially to us, 1,000 arms and with each weapon 400 rounds. Also there is necessity for extra ammunition for the furnishing of those weapons j which are now in the hands of our servants and those which are distributed amongst our tribesmen, to the amount of 4 lakhs, for we have no ammunition (left). In these days we have sent our son Ali-al-Khalifa, prepared for war ! with 500 men, and we sent with him the Shaikh of the Ajman for the purpose ' of obtaining the camels of the merchants which are in their possession and those which ^ (belong) to our tribesmen and the limit to which we completed their ammunition (is) 40 cartridges to each man and those who require arms, of our own people and tribesmen, Katar and the Al-bu-Ainain are close to them and press to bring their requirements, but I have forbidden them and I do not permit that, as the divers to the south of them reach to- Katar and to the Al-bu-Ainain and these every day meet them and the force upon them of the prohibition (is such that) even if the people of Katar and the Al-bu-Ainain bring them (arms) to them to their boats, they do not accept them (so much so) that even the Subaihat (Bedouin) who spend their sprint time in our parts and their summer in Katif have offered (the tribesmen) that they will bring to them (from) the Al-bu-Ainain (arms) and I have prohibited them for obedience to your order that is necessary to me. For we, according to the wants of our subjects, of our own people and tribesmen those arms of which there is permission, will bring them from Maskat to the number of 2,000. Now it is a difficulty upon us that we bring them and to whom we should give them and whom we should leave (without). Therefore we have explained the state to you and the order is to you and may you be preserved. No. 39 C., dated Kuwait, the 15th May 1912 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the measures in force for prohibition of the arms traffic, 1 have the honour to report the following complaint communicated to me by Shaikh Sir Mubarak-us-Subaih. 2. The Shaikh complains that, though he has given an undertaking to the British Government that be will prohibit all traffic in arms by his subjects or their vessels, though he has used every endeavour to prevent this traffic by letters to his agent in Maskat and the direct threats to his own subjects, and though no cases have been proved against his subjects (with the excep tion of a Persian nakhoda caught by H. M. “ Philomel ” in October last48 when the arms were not destined for Kuwait), His Majesty’s ships lately insisted on searching five large vessels bound from Malabar and Yemen to Kuwait, causing in the search very serious loss and damaire to the cargoes and vessels and merely proving the absence of arms, a fact which he would have been prepared to guarantee personally without any search. 3. The vessels belong to four of the most respectable and substantial merchants of Kuwait, three being personally known to me as unlikely to risk their ships in the arms trade and their arrival in the last two days, with highly-coloured stories of the searches to which they were subjected, has caused a considerable amount of ill-feeling. 4. ^ The Shaikh called on me yesterday and gave me the gist of each complaint, ^replied that I had no information as yet, but he must be aware that His Majesty’s ships were now employed in a strenuous endeavour to annihilate the traffic that they would not have undertaken the labt ur of searching large over-sea vessels without some definite information which their experience had shown them could not be verified without a most thorough search. If there had been damage or loss in the process, I was prepared to take detailed statements and, as the vessels had been proved to be innocuous, to forward their claims with recommendations towards compensation. The Shaikh who was exceedingly angry said that it was not the search so much, qua search, to which he objected as the apparent absence of all consideration for the cargo and vessels, the callous disregard of all protests made by respect- [ able men in the vessels, and the loss of prestige which he himself, in spite of all his efforts to assist the British Government, suffered. As the Shaikh went so far as to speak of repudiating his obligations under his arms agreement of May 1900, I perceived that argument was useless until his temper had had some time to cool and the interview therefore closed. n 5. To-day I visited him in the hope of finding him in a more reasonable frame of mind and on expressing my regret that his people should have been put to any loss drew from him a more lucid account of what is said to have occurred. It appears that one vessel was searched, whilst there was consider able sea-running and a good deal of damage resulted to her, that another had her dinghy broken up, that all were damaged to a more or less extent, to repair which it is estimated will cost, Rs. 4,000, that all had their cargo shifted, and returned without regard to stowage, part lost, part damaged, &amp;c., n of the extent of which no estimate can be made until the cargoes are discharged and com pared with the Bills of Lading. I endeavoured to obtain his recognition of the case for the other side, who were not in a position to differentiate as to the reliability or otherwise of the word of particular owners or nakhodas, who would certainly not have undertaken a very laborious search without what must have appeared to them good reliable information, who could not be responsible for the weather prevailing at the time, and who after all were only acting in virtue of the Shaikh’s own agreement with ourselves, and who so far from showing their w^ant of appreciation of the Shaikh’s efforts at assist ance in the prohibition of the arms traffic, had hitherto in reliance on his co-operation been able to pass Kuw r ait dhows with a much less rigorous investigation than others. Eventually the Shaikh admitted grudo-ino-ly that there w r ere two s^es to the question, and we arranged for the nakhodas to be sent to me to reeonl their statements and a more detailed report will he submitted later in this respect. 6 . What lias particularly incensed the Shaikh is that the five vessels happen to belong to the most respectable and leading men in the place that he heels his own word has been doubled, that he is now subject to recriminations for having been (so to speak) deluded by the British Government into assisting them whilst voluntarily making matters difficult for his own subjects in thl matter of arms without any compensating quid pro quo in the way of securing them from the molestation by British men-of-war to which other craft have to submit, and that his enemies in Basra and elsewhere will seize on the incident to ridicule him for his blind faith in British fair-dealing, - 7. I have seldom seen the Shaikh so moved, and the fact that he feels bis honour and good faith have been impugned and that he fancies he has-4 49 been made an object of recrimination and resentment. . ridicule are the main springs of bis Il: w f t, ' ls seil f °f inji'-y which made him speak o£ terrainatiu^ his arms agreement and permitting the free import and export of arms leaving it to us to prevent the traffic to and from Kuwait as we thought fit. * / that Kuwait boats loaded up with cargo should not be subjected to a searcli at sea. lie was prepared to make the severest example of any Kuwait owner nakhoda or vessel proved to he carrying arms, and if naval officers received information leading them to suspect any particular boat all he asked was that the cargo should not he interfered with, that a man with a letter to the Poli tical Agent be put on board with orders never to leave the boat and the boat ordered to proceed direct to Kuwait. On arrival the Political Agent could put another ipliable man on board if he desired which the Shaikh would also do and the cargo would then he unloaded and searched under the eyes of, and by, the three men in concert. If arms were found he would‘punish’ owner, nakhoda and boat, in a way that would he an example to the people of Kuwait lor the future. I said I would forward his representations with such recommendations as 1 could add and ask for an early reply. I was not in a position, however, either to give an undertaking that further searches would not be made at sea, nor to assure him that his plan would be approved as suggested above. 9. The practically coincident arrival of the five boats with similar stories has aroused very considerable resentment, and the Shaikh has been pressed to take the line he has done as much by his leading merchants as by his own wounded amnur propre. As it appeared to me that any serious rupture in our cordial relations with the Shaikh must be avoided by all possible means at the present time, I endeavoured to conciliate and soothe his pride—in other circumstances I might have inclined to a more unbending attitude, holding to the strict letter of our arms agreement and his proclamation as justification, hut this would inevitably have brought about still more resentment and prob ably led to an impasse from which there would have been no way out except by forcibly insisting on the observance of his agreement by the Shaikh. 10. On the same grounds, therefore, I would submit that, if it is possible without impairing the efficiency of naval measures, the procedure suggested in paragraph 8 above may be given a trial. The Shaikh’s own prohibition has undoubtedly had a deterrent effect, and if suspected vessels can be treated as suggested, I think it will be possible to ensure that an adequate investigation takes place in Kuwait at the time of discharging cargo. The Shaikh has no objection to more or less empty boats being searched at sea, but where large dhows, full of timber and other merchandise consigned to merchants in Kuwait and Basra, are concerned, the thorough search required must inevitably lead to some damage, for which the nakhoda becomes responsible to the consignee. 11. I -would also observe that the loss of the Shaikh’s co-operation would materially add to our difficulties in dealing with the arms traffic. At present the Katar ports and Kasr-as-Subaih appear to have developed into regular depdts and a similar situation at' Kuwait with the Shaikh’s connivance is worth avoiding if avoidance is possible with the Shaikh as co-adjutor. 12. In conclusion, I would beg that I may be favoured with an early reply for communication to the Shaikh. Dated the 28th Jamadi-ul-Awal ISS 1 ) (Ibth May 1912). p rom —n IS Excellency Shaikh Mubarak-us-Subaih, Ruler of Kuwai 4 -, To—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian (Julf. I beg to lay the following before you and request you to treat me in a manner befitting me and my honour, because I listened to your advice owing to your good deportment, justice and the protection you accord to noblefamilies; but I now see the reverse. The most necessary thing for me in life is to protect my dignity and honour. I most willingly promised to adhere to three conditions, and, thank God, I am doing accordingly. I now see that distrust is shown to me in one of the three, while my subjects are being troubled and their properties, which are shipped by their boats, and have given Bill of Lading, are lost. And I promised that none of my suhjecis should import arms, though they he given halt the value of the arms for freight, especially my Arab subjects. Just as I keep up my dignity, they also keep theirs, and are obedient to my commands. One of the respectable nobles of Kuwait, who is mv neighbour, Khalifnh- bin-Shahin Al-Ghanem, has been coming in his “ Buglow”, his uncle Amad-biu- Muhammad Al-Ghanem in his “ Dingiyah”, Abdul Latif-bin-Isa’s “Buglow”, nakhoda Abbas’s boat, and that of Naser Al-Bedr, who is one of the greatest men of Kuwait, whose father is Yusof-bin-Bedr, who was well-known to the British Government on account of his good character, had loaded their boats with timber, pepper, tamarind, rope and various goods, each of these being kept in its respective place. Some of these belonged to the merchants of Kuwait and some of them to those of Basra; and they had given Bills of Lading on the numbers of the goods. The men-of-war caught them. The Captains were told by the nakhodas that they do not ship arms, though they be given half their value, in obedience to the orders of their Shaikh and in order to keep up my dignity as well as theirs: but they did not listen to their words and insulted them and kept them three days. They took out ail their cargoes on the men- of-war and on the decks of the vessels in which they searched without finding any arms. A big amount of the cargoes has been lost, partly being thrown into the sea and partly being handed from one to the other. These merchandise belong to the merchants of Kuwait and partly to those of Basra. The nakhodas will be held responsible for the goods which they have shipped according to the Bills of Lading. What should they give for the shortage? I am lowered before you and distrust has been shown to me while I had promised that none of my subjects will ship arms. No faith has been placed in my promise. As to those who are not my subjects, I have not given undertaking on their account, because I have no right on them. If they import any arms here, you have to check them. These vessels, *&gt;., Khalifa-bln-Shahin’s boat, Ahmad’s “ Dingiyah ”, Laser Al-Bedr’s boat, and Abdul Latif’s “ Buglow”, had shipped their cargoes from Malabar. Abbas’s boat had shipped her cargo from Yemen and con sisted of fish oil and cross bars. The fish oil was taken on board the men-of- war and the cross bars on the deck cf the boat. Great quantities of these two substances were destroyed, and the Captains and Lieutenants noticed them. Ihese belong to the merchants who will ask for them according to the weight an ii• r Um ^ ei * S s ^ own of Lading. The vessels have been injured by CO iij iri ^n Wlt M ^ ie men ‘ 0 *' war and throwing woods in them. The upper edges, called “ larrik ’, have been crushed. Ahmad’s small boat, which has been on board, has been broken into pieces by throwing wood on it. Abbas’s anchor lias been cut and the second one has been crushed. The experts estimate the expenses o tie tepairs, such as wood, nails, &amp;c., and the carpenter’s wages at v s ‘ ’ ,' -^ rit - e °f Ahmad’s boat is Rs. 600 and the shortage of the goods will be stated alter they have been landed. I wrote to my friend, Captain Shakespear, yesterdav to inform you of my and my subjects requirements for arms. It is not now necessary. Every- body who wants arms gets them from Katar and Bu-Ainain as the door is lay^ft before y am exceef ^ n ^^ displeased at this proceeding and now beg to 102 Telegram P., No. 340 S., dated the 17th June 1912.

Mir Barkat desires to make his submission and to be permitted to participate in the administration of his district. You recommend that, before the Government of India acquiesce, Barkat Khan should be required to enter into an agreement first, that he will reside permanently at Jask, secondly, that he will abstain absolutely from all connection with the arms traffic, direct or indirect, and the slave trade ; and, thirdly, that for a period of two years he himself or he and his fellow chiefs jointly should deposit a sum of Bs. 10,000 as security for his adherence to the above conditions. In return you recom mend that the Telegraph Department might be advised to pay him a teleoranh subsidy as they have proposed to do before. ° “ 3. As regards the Khalifa you recommend that he be allowed to make the pilgrimage which he is desirous of making to Baghdad (Kerbala ?) or Mecca, provided that he can satisfy you that he has severed his connection with the arms traffic and will not help smugglers, will quit Persian Baluchistan, and will keep British officers concerned informed of his movements.

Department telegram * No. 513 S., dated 1st September 1911, accepting the safe guards proposed by the Political Agent, Kuwait, in connection with the import of arms by Shaikh Mubarak. 2. Captain Shakespear in his letter No. C.—68, dated the 4th October 1911, of which I enclose a copy, reported the arrangements finally come to with the Shaikh, but there w r ere one or two points on which I wished to assure myself by reference to Kuwait before sending the papers on to Government. When Captain Shakespear’s reply was received I was much pre-occupied with arrangements for landing the Cavalry and regret that this despatch to Government got overlooked. 3. The arrangement arrived at is not completely satisfactory, hut I agree with the Political Agent in thinking that no useful purpose will he achieved by pressing the Shaikh further as to details. The Political Agent, Maskat, has received the necessary instructions for co-operation, but Shaikh Mubarak had not up to the time I left Maskat made any commencement of shipping the arms. Note. —Office copy was signed by Resident. No. C.—68, dated Kuwait, the 4th October 1911 (Confidential). From— Captain W, H, I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the correspondence ending with your endorsement No. 2323, dated the 6th September 1911, I have the honour to enclose here with copy and translation of a letter received from Shaikh Mubarak on the subject of the arms required by him together with a list of such arms as are actually at present his property, showing their distribution. 2 . The Shaikh’s registers were very ill-kept and confused and the list furnished herewith was the result achieved by some three days’ work on the part of two of his clerks; I trust, therefore, its details will suffice. 3. Shaikh Mubarak informs me that he has not included in the attached list the Magazine arms and ammunition he received under our auspices from Maskat at the end of 1910 and these I calculate to aggregate some 400 weapons with 160,000 rounds of ammunition additional to the figures given by the Shaikh as at present in his ware-house. I believe the figures in the Shaikh’s list to be substantially correct, most of the headmen named being personally known to me as employed by the Shaikh.. 4. With regard to the arms for which permission to ship from Maskat is about to be granted the Shaikh has undertaken :— (а) That in the event of their arrival during the Political Agent’s absence, they shall be stored separately and not opened until his return ; (б) that in the event of their being urgently required the Head Clerk of this Agency will be asked to note numbers and quantities himself of those about to be removed ; (c) that the Political Agent may examine the consignment on their arrival or on his return to Head-quarters; (d) that all subsequent issues will be notified to the Political Agent as made.These safeguards will suffice in my opinion for us to maintain an adequate check oyer the Shaikh’s arms. 5. In amplification of the Shaikh’s letter to me it may be observed that the Shaikh explains the large expenditure of his ammunition by the fact thfit the arms trade in Kuwait haying been strictly prohibited for the past two years, he is compelled to supply the wants of his townspeople and tribesmen from his own stocks, and as he estimates that his people both in the town and outside possess as their own property some 36,000 weapons, the expenditure of ammunition is certainly likely to be heavy. 6 . It will be observed that in his letter the Shaikh states definitely for the first time that he recovers the value of arms he supplies to those of his subjects who can afford to pay for them. I am not sure whether this fact w r as quite realised originally, though it was not to be expected that the Shaikh would play benevolent god-father to all the youths in Kuwait without extracting a quid pro quo. Accordingly in ackowledging the Shaikh’s letter, I observed, in order to emphasise the necessity for straight-forward dealing that the point was hitherto unknown to us; and, for the same reason, that the progressive increase of his requirements in each letter w T as liable to give rise to suspicion. I am of opinion that though the Shaikh now fully realises the necessity of being perfectly straight-forward with us in the matter of his requirements, it will not be wise to harass him in too inquisitorial a manner, for he can, and probably then would, take steps to supply himself secretiy. 7. I have the honour, therefore, to recommend that permission for ship ment of the consignment sanctioned may now be given effect to, and the Political Agent, Maskat, directed to furnish this office with copies of the passes as issued to the respective dhows. r Translation of a letter from Shaikh Mubarak-as-Subah, Baler of Kuwait, to Captain W H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, dated the 10th Shawal 1392 (4th October 1911). After compliments .—Let it not bedridden from Tour Honour that when arms used to come to these parts my subjects in the town and the tribesmen used to purchase their requirements for arming themselves, but when the I recious Government forbad, and I, in obedience to the order of the Govern ment, prohibited the bringing of weapons to my town either openly or secretly and now when my subjects, the towns-people and the tribesmen, owdng to the continuance of the regard of the Government and its men (representatives) on all have increased their strength in numbers and property, they require more arms for the aiming of their youths who leave school in every year.

But let it not he hidden from Your Honour that the increasing of the numbers of arms and cartridges which you mention in each letter more than in that before it, in my opinion will not profit you because it is possible to become a source of doubt to the Government. And of the portion of those capable of my (your) people of (bearing) the price of 20arms that you take from them the cost price to you this was not known up to the present neither to the Government nor to me, but I will inform the Government concerning it and the order is with them.

Bill, Esq., First Assistant Resident (in the absence of theResident), To—The Secretary to the Government of India, in the Foreign Department. ,, With reference to the current negotiations with Maskat in connection with the arms traffic, I have the honour, under instructions from the Resident to forward for the information of the Government of India, translations of M A Memorandum given privately and confidentially by Colonel Cox to His Highness the Sultan, embodying the purport of communi cations previously made to him verbally. {ii) A letter, dated 11th November, from His Highness the Sultan to * Seriaai No. 17 . Resident on which the latter’s telegram* No. M,—8 of same date was based. Translation of a Memorandum furnished to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat confidentially and privately, for his personal information on the subject of the Arms Traffic dated thp. 7th November 1911. ' a. ea toe A combination of recent developments appear to Government to have created a juncture which necessitates a fresh and frank discussion of the out look with Your Highness. A , 8 /°n 7, ell J^° W ’ tlle F esent m icit traffic in arms and ammunition across the Gulfs of Oman and Persia from Maskat constitutes a great menace to vital British interests on the North-Mest Frontier of India. It is imperative for the British Government to eradicate this traffic or to keep R down to insignificant proportions by one means or another and His Majesty s Government are determined to maintain measures to that end we have informed Your Highness, we have been engaged for a considerable time past in endeavouring to effect the object in view conveniently by inducing the French Government to come to an amicable arrangement with Your Highness and ourselves, which, with Your Highness’s co-operation w ouh render possible the introduction of an absolute prohibition against the W import and export of arms to and from Maskat territory ; -we agSg prtraWy with Tour Highness to give you fair compensation in respect of loss of income whicl, might result to you. As long as there was expectation of these ne'o tiations with France being brought to an early and successful conclusion onr friendly regard for Your Highness personally prompted us to refrain from taking full advantage of the strict ietter of your delegation of authority to His Majesty’s Navy and to restrict our operations as far as possible tothe high seas ard the opposite coast, and thus to avoid taxing you with frenimnt demands for co-operation or other active measures likely to brino. v Vtoto difficulties with your own subjects. While well aware that Your Hi-1, ness ha* denved a considerable amount of profit from the existence of the contraband traffic in question, nevertheless the British Government iud-in- from fil , / of the local Agents, readily believe that the traffic has\&amp; b S een a touT o? to“eHef. ry anX ‘ ety t0 Y ° Ur HighneSS fr ° m Which r ou besorj 2122 The fresh developments constituting the juncture above referred to are these The negotiations with Prance, though in progress, have been interrupted and protracted by the incidence of other political events, and it must be some time longer before they reach finality. Secondly, the British Government notice with great disappointment and concern that Your Highness appears no longer to consider that your obligations to them make it incumbent upon you to maintain even a neutral attitude towards the illicit trade and that you have for some time past unmistakeably identified yourself with the arms dealing fraternity and especially with those who are mainly responsible for the traffic through Mekran which has been so prejudicial to our interests. In no circumstances will there be any alteration in the determination of the Government of India to cope with the traffic by all means in their power. If, however, the means used continue to be those which are now in force, and if Your Highness perseveres in your present attitude of active countenance to the operations of the arms dealers, then the inevitable result must be the interrup tion of those cordial relations which have now so long existed between the British Government and Your Highness and your ancestors. This is a prospect which we feel sure you will contemplate with great concern, as do His Majesty’s Government, and therefore in your own interests and as the holder of a high British decoration Government have decided to afford Your Highness another opportunity for co-operating with them seriously for bringing about the effective control of the trade by means of certain measures which in the opinion of the Government, will serve to keep an effective check on the illicit traffic, without in any 'way interfering with the supply of the legitimate wants of Oman or conflicting with Your Highness’s obligations under Treaty. The chief item for which Your Highness’s co-operation is asked, is the creation of a bonded warehouse for arms and ammunition under very strict supervision. All arms in Maskat and all those entering in future whether for sale or export would be conducted under a complete system for marking, registration and certified Port Clearance. Government think that such an arrangement would quickly relegate the trade to its legitimate proportions, but recognise that by its introduction Your Highness’s income would be reduced to some extent; and although Your Highness must admit that you are not morally entitled to compensation for loss of profit derived from an illicit trade directly hostile to the interests of the Power to which you are most strongly allied and indebted, yet we recognise the difficulty of your position and are prepared to give you reasonable compensation, in the increase of your subsidy by so much per month or per annum, in consideration of your adopting these arrangements, and so long as they are effectively maintained. As regards the stocks of rifles already lying with dealers in Maskat, Your Highness appears to be entitled, as a matter of municipal administration, and owing to the necessity for ensuring the safety of the town from explosions or raids by Bedouins (as have happened before), to oblige all owners of stocks to deposit them in the .bonded magazine, to be sold under the safeguards provided under the arrangement above proposed. In the same way the arms lying with us may be handed over to Your Highness for deposit in the magazine. It is, of course, well understood between us that, if the arrangement introduced at Maskat results in attempt to import arms to another port in Your Highness’s territory, you will be prepared to introduce a similar arrange ment there in consultation with us.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated Maskat, 19 Zilkaadeh 1329 (lltn November 1911). After compliments .—I address Your Honour with reference to the convers ation we have had on the subject of the Arms Traffic.It is true that I have found it difficult to understand, and have felt hurt at the non-receipt of final answers of relief from Government or yourself, in connection with certain incidents which have taken place in the course of * the operations of British Men-of-War for the suppression of the Arms Traffic, in regard to which it has seemed to me that my rights and losses have been over- looked or made light of. I have likewise, as is not hidden from you, felt iniured that Government should have left me so long in the state of difficulty and anxiety into which I have been thrown by the result of the measures taken bv them. •&gt; But m the course of the frank exchange of views that there has been between us you have explained to me that the delay has not been due to neglect but to other considerations, and in connection with these incidents vm* have to some extent relieved my feelings. At any rate I trust you will expkin to Government that as long as I can count on the endurance of their friendlv and considerate attitude towards me and my well-being, it is altogether contrarv to my thoughts and wishes to pursue a course opposed to concord between mf and so to disturb these intimate relations between myself and the British Pn * ment, which have been of so much importance and^ssis' 'With regard to the statement which vou have pmnmn-n-inn.i- ji i. • the authority of Government, I have understood and thought over °Jh V Flth told me and beg you will inform Government that S 6 Wiat you Firstly.—A &amp;I have repeatedly declared to you, provided that the Ti t.

In continuation of my telegram No. 72, dated 2nd instant, in which the seizure was communicated of rifles on board the British Indian Steam Navi gation Company’s S.S. “ Palamcotta ” in the Persian Gulf, which took place on the 31st July 1911, be pleased to lay before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council the annexed copy of a letter, dated 9th instant, that I have received from the Hon’ble Mr. W. Graham of Bombay, reporting the seizure of a further consignment of rifles on board the Hansa line S. S. “ Molktefels ” at Bombay. 2. It would seem that this method of smuggling arms is now being employed in a more systematic manner than was generally supposed, and I would, therefore, suggest that instructions should be given to the Customs at Bombay and other ports for a careful scrutiny to be held of all transhipment cargo for the Persian Gulf. I am asking the Governor of Ceylon to give similar instructions with regard to Colombo, in case any rifles, &amp;c., should be passed through that port. Dated Bombay, the 9th August 1911. From— W. Graham, Esq, Malabar Hill, Claremont, To—His Excellency Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, K.C.I.E., M.V.O., Naval Commander-iu-Chief, East Indies Squadron. Arms Traffic. As I felt sure you would be interested to know, I wired you on Monday afternoon to inform you that 50 rifles had been discovered, concealed in a ship ment of loaf sugar per one of our Hansa steamers for transhipment to Kuwait. The discovery of these rifles was rather a piece of luck. A former shipment, which had been transhipped to the B. I. S. N. “ Palamcotta” had gone forward to Kuwait. During discharge, one of the Arab coolies employed smashed open one of the cases in order to steal some of its contents. In doing so, he discovered that the case contained some rifle barrels concealed in it, and he, therefore, brought the matter to the notice of the tally clerk, who in turn brought the matter to the notice of the Chief Officer of the “ Palamcotta”. The goods were confiscated, and I understand that the rifles are now on board the “Eox’\ The Customs received information from Bushire just in time to enable them to detain and search the 29 cases of sugar by the “ Moltkefels ”, with the result that they discovered these rifles. The rifles were very cleverly concealed in middle of the packages, the stocks and barrels being packed separately. The rifles which are of the latest type of Mauser (1911) are beautiful weapons, and must be worth at least £10 each. This shipment of sugar by the “ Moltkefels ” is the third that has come forward. I attach for information particulars of the three shipments. The first shipment by the “ Lichtenfels ”, which was transferred to the B.I. “ Madura,” I am afraid, got through without detection. As you will notice from the particulars, which I attach the shippers are apparently English firms. The firm in the first two instances being Bertie Bichmond &amp; Co., Ltd., and in the third case, Lewis Crampton &amp; Co., which makes it all more disgraceful. I wired home at once to the Chairman of the Hansa Line to take steps to prosecute the forwarding Agents (H. Reynardts) for false declaration. I am having a list prepared in my office here of all goods which these Agents (Reynardts &amp; Co.) have forwarded for transhipment to the Coast Ports, Mormugao, Cochin, Tuticorin, &amp;c., so as to enable the Customs to take steps to prevent arms being smuggled into the country in this manner.2 As regards transhipment cargo for the Persian Gulf coming out by the Hansa and Hamburg American Line Steamers. Since my return from the Gult in January, I have myself scrutinized very carefully the list of all such cargo, and have, on several occasions, inspected cases of nails, &amp;c., that were being forwarded to Bahrain, Bushire and Basra. But, though, I was on the look-out for anything of a suspicious nature, I never for a moment thought tnat an attempt would be made to smuggle rifles concealed in cases of su^ar. especially when the shipments were made by English firms. It is really very disgraceful that any British firm should have acted in this manner. lam writing fully by the outgoing mail to the Managing Director of the liansa line, and also to our London firm to make most careful investigations, so as to prevent a repetition of this. I am in close touch with Mr. Gubbay, the Collector of Customs here, and will keep him closely posted with all goods that come forward either by our ansa 01 Hamburg American Boats, so as to prevent further smuggling of nnes in bins way.

I am directed to say that it has been reported to the Government of India that two cases have recer tly occurred in which attempts were made to smuggle arms to the Persian Gulf in consignments of sugar manifested for tranship ment to Kuwait. 2. Twenty-five cases marked “ K. K. B. 1—25 sugar, from Antwerp to Kuwait,” arrived in Bombay on the 30th June last by the Hansa and Hamburg American line steamer S. S. “ Ferdinand Laeisz ” and were tran shipped to the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamer S. S. “Palaracotta” for Kuwait. During discharge one of the cases was acci dentally damaged and on examination it was discovered to contain rifles. On a search being made of the whole consignment 50 rifles were found concealed in ten of the cases. The shippers in this case were Bertie Bichmond &amp; Co., and the forwarding agents H. Reynardts &amp; Co., Antwerp. The name of the consignees is not known, but they are believed to be a German firm of Kuwait. 3. A further consignment of rifles has since been discovered by the Bombay Customs authorities in certain cases of sugar which arrived in Bombay by the Hansa liner S.S. “ Moltkefels ”, bearing marks A.R.B. These cases also were shipped at Antwerp and w T ere manifested for transhipment to Kuwait. The suger was packed in layers and the rifles were very cleverly concealed in the middle of the packages, the stocks and barrels being packed separately. The shippers in this case were Lewis Crampton &amp; Co. and the forwarding agents H. Reynardts &amp; Co. 4. As it appears from these cases that this method of smuggling arms to the Persian Gulf is now being employed in a systematic manner, I am to request His Excellency the Governor in Council , . . that, With the permission of His Honour the Lieutenan. -Governor in Council , til6 CUStOUlS authorities A His Honour the LaeuLenaiu-uovernor may be instructed to keep a strict watch over all cargo manifested for tranship ment to the Persian Gulf.No 2544 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 30th September (received the gth October) 1911.

C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, in continuation of my telegram No 843 of 4th instant, a copy of the report furnished by the Political Agent, Kuwait, on the Marafi family of Kuwait, and their trading operations. 2. The device of bringing contraband arms to Kuwait concealed in cases of loaf sugar seems to have been resorted to just about the time when Messrs. Wonckhaus’ Agents were turning active attention to Kuwait {vide my telegram No. 395 of 30th April), and it is at all events not improbable that the Marafis were put up to this method of introduction by the German firm. 3. It would seem advisable to await receipt of further information as to the result of the action of the Bombay Customs Authorities in regard to the consign ment seized there, before making any special representations to Shaikh Mubarak on the subject of the Marafi family. NOTE ON THE MARAFI FAMILY (PERSIANS) OF KUWAIT. The principal members of the Marafi family in Kuwait are given in the following genealogical table :— r~ Haidar (dead) Mahomed Rafiya (dead). Abdul Karim ~~'1 Nasir (dead) r r— Yusuf 1 1 Ismail. 1 Mahomed AIL r Abdul Hassan. 1 Abdul Mehsin. '1 Ibrahim. Mahomed Husain. The above table gives the more important members, there being a number of others, both present in Kuwait and in Behbahan, from which district the family originally came. 2. They trade in the names of Haji Abdul Karim Behbani and Ismail bin Mahomed Ali Marafi. Between them the family owns two large sea-going vessels, two smaller “ booms ” trading between the Persian coast and Kuwait and one “water-boom.” 3. Their relations with the Shaikh are, and I believe have always been, most friendly—Ismail was the man the Shaikh selected to purchase his arms in Maskat, probably because of his knowledge but also I have no doubt because the Shaikh places considerable confidence in the family. 4. The family’s business is in food-stuffs. They purchase and ship dates from the Shatt*el-Arab to India in the autumn by their own two vessels and also by other chartered buggalows. From India these two boats return with timber spices, rope, coffee, etc. The other two boats are employed most of the year between Kuwait, Hindian, Mashurand Basrah carrying barley, wheat and pro bably also in smuggling tea, arms, and other articles which pay high duties intoG.c. B. P., Simla.—No C 235 P. D — 14 . 10 - 11 .- 44 .—H.C.S.L Persia by the northern Gulf ports. The firm’s imports by steamers are not as large as might be expected, consisting chiefly of rice. It is also the fact I believe that they finance some of the local shroffs in the bazaar. The above may be said to be their ostensible business. Kuwait and their boats were largely employed in the arms traffic between Maskat and this port: at that time there seems to be no doubt the sale and purchase of arms and ammunition was their main business and at the end of 1909 they were reported to have a stock of nearly 6,000 rifles and 1,500 cases of ammunition on their premises. How far they have succeeded in keeping up the trade it is difficult to conjecture but there seems little doubt that they constantly attempt smuggling and should their boats escape the Naval patrol there is every likeli hood of their being able to land the arms in Kuwait without the Shaikh’s knowledge, by the simple expedient of bribing his Customs officials. I was told that they succeeded in importing as much as 500 arms a month but cannot credit figure. Ismail Marafi is in constant communication with Maskat and his agents there are M. Nichan and the Goguyer firm and Mirza Husain. There now seems little doubt that the consignment of, so called Loaf Sugar which was over carried by the S. S. “ Palamcotta ”, and that captured by the Customs officials in Bombay in the course of transhipment were destined for Ismail Marafi. A search through^ previous ships’ manifests brought the following suspicious consignments to light, of which delivery had been taken as stated below :— 20 cases Loaf Sugar mark M. K. shipped at Maskat, reached Kuwait by S.S. Bulimba’ on the 24th March 19 7 * * * 11 } and delivery taken by Ismail Marafi. 25 cases Loaf Sugar mark K ICB.^ both transhipped from S.S. “ Lich- » ,&gt; » ,, S.M.K.) tenfels ” to S.S. “Madura” at Bombay, reached Kuwait on 6th April 1911, and delivery taken by Ismail Marafi. 1 case Hardware mark A J. K. transhipped from S.S. “ Lichtenfels ” to S.S. “ Madura” at Bombay, reached Kuwait on 6th April 1911, and delivered to Haji Mahomed Ali Marafi. 25 cases Loaf Sugar mark K R.B. discovered in course of landing from S.S. “ Palamcotta ” on 24th July 1911. If the firm dispose of these arms in Kuwait it must be done secretly for since the Shaikh s prohibition there is no open sale of arms in Kuwait and I imagine that the family finds its best market on the Persian coast. . . ^ ^ think that either Mahomed Ah or Ismail Marafi have as yet any intimate relations with the German firm of Wonckhaus, though no doubt they sell barley and wheat to this firm as offering them better prices than others most of the barley purchased this year by Abdulla “ Germani ” in Kuwait was supplied by the Marafi house. 7. Haji Abdul Karim's son, Abdul Hassan, however is said to have received a large advance from the German firm by way of forward purchase money and that he will buy what he can in Mashur and Hindian, shipping the ^rain if possible at the Shatt-el-Arab bar into the German Steamers. Beyond this I have heard of no other conection with the German firm. 5. Anterior to 1910 the family shared with the other Persian house of Haji Mahomed Taqi the distinction of being the largest wholesale arms-dealers in W, H. I.

As stated in my telegramf No. 73 of 3rd August, the dhows have t serial No 65 ^ een burnt, the arms and ammunition jettisoned and the crews set at liberty. Report of capture of booms “ Hussainyeh ” and “ Mahomedi ” engaged in arms traffic. H. M. S. “ Eox ”, at Bahrein; 19th July 1911. No. 40—11. Sir, I have the honour to report that, whilst cruising off Mussendam, Ras Shaikh Masud, on 11 th July, I observed, at 7-30 a.m., two large booms heading west and almost becalmed to the westward of the great Quoin. On sighting H. M. S. “Eox’ , , one of them altered eight points and attempted to make for Mussendam. Considering this suspicious, I stopped and boarded both dhows and, on it being reported that they were both from Sohar with wood, I directed them to be secured one on either side of H. M. S. “ Eox ”, cleared and searched. H. M. S. “ Eox”, was then in Lat. 26° 30' N. Long. 56° 26 / E. 2. The larger of the two, by name “ Mahomedi ”, is a two masted boom, Nakhoda, at the time of capture, Ali Mahomet bin Ali; owned by Hussain bin Zar Mahomet. The latter, I am informed, is his own Nakhoda, but he left his vessel at Sohar and returned to Bushire via Maskat fourteen days before the dhow herself left Sohar. The present Nakhoda is a disreputable looking old man who makes repeated efforts to disclaim his pretentions to the rank, and I think his statement is probably true. 3. The cargo consisted entirely of firewood cut into logs and was trans ferred to the starboard side of the upper deck of H. M. S. “ Eox ”, and it was not until 10 p.m. that the bottom was reached and carpenters sent down to sound the bottom boards. After a few minutes work, the carpenters having torn out a bottom board, ammunition was found and shortly afterwards rifles. 4. In the meanwhile, similar operations were being carried on with the other dhow on the port side. The name of this boom is “Hussainyeh”, Nakhoda Hussain bin Mahomed; owner Hashim of Baraki. She is a moderate sized two masted boom, older than the “ Mahomedi ”, but in good condition. 5 . About half-an-hour after the discovery of arms in the “ Mahomedi ” they were discovered, under similar conditions and in the same relative position concealed in tiie “ Hussainyeh ” under her cargo, also of firewood. 6 . The crews of both vessels are Tangiseris and number fourteen in each case. Both dhows belong to a party of four which left Tangistan in the middle of April and were known to be intended for carrying arms. The crew themselves appear to be the owners of the wood, whilst the arms are owned by the syndicate of Bushire merchants mentioned in my telegram of 15th July, No. 78, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. 7. These are, in the case of “ Mahomedi ”—Haji Mahomet Skal Mahomet Ali bin Ali and Zahir Haji Khanasir, all of Bushire,if . H! ! m m i i 50 In the case of the “ HussainyehKhalfat Ali, Zayir Hassan and Saiyid Muhammad, all of Bushire. 8 . The only papers found in the dhows referred to date cargoes of last year, and there was nothing to prove the ownership of either dhows or rifles. They flew no colours, and being rebels to the Government of Persia, appear not to wish to be any way associated with it. 9 . The agreement between the owners of the rifles and the crews of the dhows appears to be as follows :— Bs. Por each rifle landed in Persia ... ... 5 Por every two pistols landed in Persia ... ... 5 and, as far as I can make out, each weapon is to carry with it 400 rounds of ammunition. 10.

On 27th August, Gumbly reported that an informer stated that Sultan’s steamer had landed 1,100 Mausers and a quantity of rounds of ammunition at Sohar for arms, dealers. I instructed Knox to acquaint Sultan of Maskat informally with terms of report and ask him what foundation there was for it, but not to formulate any special remonstrances pending receipt of instruc- 10D ^’ j ^ nox re P or ts that Sultan of Maskat replied that report, as received by us, had been spread by Khan Saheb Muhammad Bin Said and was not true but that between 150 and 200 rifles had gone up in his steamer. If Govern ment ot India were to come to direct issue with Sultan of Maskat now over this point, my work with him at end of Bamazan would be considerably prejudiced; therefore, subject to learning your wishes, I would propose to address Sultan of Maskat persona ly and demi-officially telling him what surprise and concern these reports caused to myself and Government of India, who also received them, and adding that this was one of the matters which I wished to talk to him about at end of Ramazan and hope that pending our meeting he Tr?dii d n0t a fo r( i 1 mat T a ,i fo1 ; any more of them ' Addressed Government of India; repeated Admiral, Bombay. 105 From—The Foreign Secretary, Simla, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

At the same time the Government of India believe that the extension of the telegraph line from Jask to near Bandar Abbas, solely in the interests of the stoppage of the arms traffic, would prove a very expensive measure, while the Persian Govern ment would probably strongly resent the formation of what would practically be a Levy Corps in Persian territory, even though they were called line-guards. With reference to your proposal to reopen the question of the establishment of a British Agency at Bampur, I am to say that, in view of the^ strong opposition shown to the appointment by the Persian Government in the past, the Government of India are not disposed to bring forward the proposal again at present. 3.

With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department • Serial No. 28 . telegram* No. S —410, dated 10th July v n K1 , . , Q1 . T . 1911, I have the honour to forward, for lavour or consideration, a copy of a com munication received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, reporting the result of his discussion with Shaikh Mubarak of the measures best calculated to supply an effective check upon the subsequent life-history of the arms and ammuni tion imported by the latter with our permission. 2. In my letterf No. 1256 of 14th May, I suggested that the rifles he t Serial No. 156, Fart VIII. branded with a special device before leaving Maskat, and that the arrange ments regulating their issue should be subject to the supervision of the Political Agent. As regards the cartridges, apart from the said supervision of their issue by the Political Agent, 1 could only suggest our requiring a proportion of empty cases to be returned. Captain Shakespear and Shaikh Mubarak, in modification of the above, contemplate the stamping of the barrels on arrival at Kuwait with the recognis ed mark of the Shaikh. 3. This arrangement would enable the Shaikh to stamp all rifles coming into Kuwait, with or without our permission, and would not(?) provide a check on the numbers used in Kuwait territory. On the other hand, it would he just as efficacious so far as concerns the contraband trade into Persia, because any weapon found in Persia or en route to Persia with the Kuwait mark on it would he ipso facto liable to confiscation. Whether the arms are branded at Maskat or Kuwait seems to make little difference so long as the consignments are supervised by His Majesty’s Ships on their way from Maskat to Kuwait, as they will be. Subject, therefore, to the Government of India’s approval, I think the Kuwait suggestion under this head may stand. 4. The other details for supervision of the issue and storage of rifles are satisfactory, but I think Shaikh Mubarak should be asked to allow the Political Agent to check the munitions with the list at any time he may wish after, say, 24 or 48 hours* notice. 5. The question of the ammunition while no less important is a much less simple one to deal with. The only further suggestion I can make is that we should require the Shaikh in future to order through a British firm, who would be required to have the cartridge cases stamped with the Kuwait mark before exportation. I do not fancy Shaikh Mubarak would object to this course, but it would not be possible to bring it into force in connection with the present consignment. 6 . The crux of the position is that Shaikh Mubarak, if he really needs the munitions, will no doubt get them up by land if we do not comply with what he considers his reasonable needs. Six months or a year hence we may be in a stronger position than we are now, both in regard to the arms traffic question and the status of Kuwait, and, on the whole, I would advise Government to accept the present proposals (including the right of the Political Agent to check the magazine) and, if necessary, work out a more fully efficacious system before he asks for another consignment. If it is possible for Government to communicate their decision by telegram, I request the favour of that being done.No. C. 51, dated Kuwait, the 31st July 1911 (Confidential). From— -Captain W. H. I.

After discussing possible safeguards the Shaikh said that all his arms were marked with his own “ wasm ” (family-mark) stamped into the metai of the barrel, and it would be convenient if this could be continued as all oast and futuie arms would then heir the same mark. The mark is a blnnf anl i, j with a dot, thus'T'.

The Shaikh further said that he maintain ed lists ot his own arms showing how they were distributed at present and was prepared to furnish me with a copy of this existing list; he also undertake that when new arms are received that they shall oe forthwith stamped = a any issue made from them shall be intimated to this Agency witHetails of number and to whom issued; also that the return of arms to s llt r instance, at the termination of the pearlins sea«o-rt and t st(lle ( as &gt; holder to another shall he notified to S SnT This 0 ^ 000 ^ “l '' 0111 °n? this Agency to maintain a more or less ctSte re-iter of the iH • arms in Kuwait, and a fair check of tl.eir T[ r it L l tl&lt;&gt;n ° f will meet with approval, for I am unableriug^t any ter Uth^d “shikh.^ ° f bd “ S f ° r P- spontanao^S* 4 ' the “»«« i» more difficult.

Q With reference to Marine Department letter* No. 115—223-M., dated 28th • Serial No. is. June 1911, inviting the expression of •ar ti n ^ views upon a scheme put forward by Mr. E. G. Gregson, at present employed on special duty under the Foreign Department in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, be pleased to lay the following remarks before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council. 2. The proposal to increase the number of the Indo-European line-guard : n Southern Baluchistan and to utilise them for preventing the Afghans from getting arms through the Mekran Coast appears to be a very good one, provided that it can he carried out, and it 'will eventually enable the Naval Commander-in-Chief to economise afloat. It will ensure the loyalty of the local Chiefs and will go a long way towards entirely closing the Rapch river, which is the main route by which arms are conveyed north when landed on the Mekran Coast. 3. With regard to the proposal to employ small vessels as permanent cruisers on the Mekran and Biyaban coasts, I am afraid that it would he found to he much more expensive than Mr. Gregson anticipates. It is difficult to make vessels of the kind suggested self-contained and self-supporting. They require repairs of some kind alter about a month’s work, and their boilers need cleaning and refitting at intervals of about six weeks. The staff which they carry is not sufficient to do this work, and it would, therefore, he necessary to establish a workshop to which they could go for this purpose. It is for this reason that the K. I. M. S. “ Minto ” has had to be employed in the Gulf to look after the armed launches which we have already there. When working from ports at which small repairs can be undertaken these difficulties are not apparent, and such little vessels run very well. 4. The vessels which Mr. Gregson proposes are somewhat of the type of the armed launches. They are faster in speed than the launches, but they would probably draw from 12 to 15 feet of water, which is a dralt greater than either of the armed launches or of the “ Odin ** and “ Espiegle 5. It is, therefore, considered that the small vessels proposed will not he satisfactory unless the Government of India are willing to incur the further expense of keeping a depot vessel in the Gulf, such as the “Minto” or of establishing a small lepairing workshop with the necessary personnel at Hen jam.ft 64 Telegram P., No. 735, dated (and received) the 6th August 1911.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit my views on Mr. Gregson’s recent proposals in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic, as directed in Foreign Department letter* No. 1129 E.-A., dated * Serial No. 211 , Part VIII. th / 15 th June 1911. 2. Mr. Gregson starts with the premise that the smuggling of large con signments by Afghans is giving place to a traffic in small quantities by Baluchis and that this change will be established. It seems to me, however, that the change of methods referred to has simply been resorted to for the reason that our blockade operations have made the smuggling of large consign ments too risky ; and that if, while the import into Maskat remains unrestricted as at present, our blockade measures are relaxed, we may expect a speedy reversion to the former modus operands. Afghans will surely not pay high prices for arms to Baluch middle-men in the hinterland, if by moving in strong parties down to the coast they can get direct delivery of dhow-loads from Maskat. # Xn fact, Mr. Gregson’s suggestions seem to me to he based on a hypothesis which it would be premature to assume. 3. Moreover, even assuming that the Afghans have relinquished for good the practice of coming down to the coast in large parties, I am of opinion that the tract from Biyahan to Bandar Abbas is still by no means adequately provided for by Mr. Gregson’s suggested arrangements. It would be essential I think that the telegraph line should be extended from Jask to Mmab or Naband (iust short of Bandar Abbas) under the provisions of Article 1 ot the Telegraph Convention of 2nd April 1868, and that line-guard levies should be provided, as for the Charbar-Jask section. 1 . In connection with the general question of a land cordon, however, I would refer to the correspondence of 1908 (especially paragraphs 1^ to 17 of letter No. 2094, from the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General m Baluchistan, to the Foreign Department) ; and, again, to Major M ebb-\\ are s recent memorandum of April 1911, as bearing thereon. The latter’s suggestion that a strong guard for the protection of the telegraph line should be located at Dehaneh Baghi seems quite justifiable vis h vis the Persian Government and likely to be efficacious but the T u e s ion of the bearing of the measures taken by us near the Afghan fiontier, upon the Afghan mind, is a factor which the^ Government of India will take m account and on which I can offer no opinion. Confining myself then to the Mekran aspect of the question, I am of opinion that with the telegraph line extended through Biyaban and telegiap levies posted along it on the same scale as those proposed foi the Oharbar Jask section! combined with the location of a British officer as Consul at Bampur with a strong escort, we should have a fairly effective T f e g permanent scheme for keeping Persian Mekran out of mischief in connection with the arms traffic, and keeping Afghans away from the coast. _ 5 Kef erring to the question of the appointment of a British Agent to Bampur and, in that connection, to Government of ^ n ^^ 1 ^ o 3 P a ^ ch ^° at I ^ 16th March 1906 to His Majesty’s Secretary ot Sta f e ’AT!'h made the Govern- not recollect, if I ever heard them, the precise reasons which made the Go ment of India unwilling to receive a Persian Consu ar Official at Quet a, but it seems possible that they may have hinged °' “ c e ten greatly relations with Russia at the time— relations which have since nten gieauy modified; and on the other hand it might be practicable to get a BuUsh officer to Bampur at the present juncture without reviving the Quetta questi n, which probably the present Persian regime have forgotten all about.2 \ We are already entitled to place an officer at Bam, and there seems nothing to prevent an officer so appointed from arranging to winter at Bampur. I think there can he no doubt that the location of a British officer there would not on]y assist us greatly in keeping the subsidised Baluch Mirs up to the mark, but the fact of his presence would also tend materially towards keeping Afghans away. While the details of measures which may he taken on the coast line depend primarily on the conditions prevailing at any particular time in connection with the import into Maskat, I am of opinion that the appoint ment of an Agent to Bampur is to he recommended in any case. The region in question is already in our sphere and must sooner or later he opened up to civilisation and the sooner we set about quietly strengthening our influence there the better. I trust the question will be re-examined.ir, 59 No. 157—1462 XIV N., dated Diyatalawa, the 14th July 1911. ] 7 rom His Excellency Bear-Admiral Sir Edmond J. W.

I think he must be allowed to get them, but as the subject generally is under correspondence it seems advisable to refer to the Government of India first. If they concur in my view I beg that their acquiescence may be telegraphed to me.

From — Captain 'W. H. I. Shakespbab, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. C.—21, dated the 10th April 1911, I have the honour to submit the following request from Shaikh Mubarak in regard to the ammunition which he was permitted to ship from Maskat during the past year. 2. It appears that amongst the arms shipped as Mauser Magazine rifles and carbines were included what should have been described as “ Mannlicher Magazine Carbines, 1896 pattern ” to the number of thirty. By a mistake the ammunition, at the rate of 400 rounds per weapon, supplied with these carbines turns out to be Mauser ammunition and consequently use less for the Mannlicher weapons. The Shaikh tells me that he only discovered this fact during the last week, after opening out all the ammunition he has when he wished to issue the Mannlicher carbines to his mounted guards. He begs that he may be permitted to import the correct ammunition from Maskat by steamer in order to avoid delay and any chance of native boats attempting smuggling in excess. The dealer in Maskat from whom the weapons were obtained and who has the correct ammunition is Mirza Hussain Ibn Abdul Baqi, Isfahani. The Shaikh also said he would like a few thousand rounds in excess of the regulation number sold with these rifles. 3. In the circumstances and as the number of rounds will amount to only 12,000, apart from any excess which you may be inclined to sanction, I have the honour to recommend that the Shaikh’s request may be considered favourably, and that the dealer may be informed that he can ship the ammuni tion by mail-steamer under a pass from the Political Agent, Maskat. 2&gt;'S. 10th May 1911 .—I have the honour to enclose copy of a letter in Arabic which the S h aik h sent to me for forwarding to the Political Agent,. |[P :l n ;i Maskat, which relates to the same subject and in which the Shaikh asks defi nitely for 15,000 rounds. I regret the late receipt of the letter does not permit me to furnish a translation before closing the mails. Translation of a letter from Shaikh Mubarak es Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, to Major S. G. Knox C.I.E., Political Agent, Maskat, dated 11th Jemadi I 1329 = (12th May 1911). After enquiring after your health, let it not be hidden from you that we have previously purchased arms from Maskat, with the permission of the British Government for arming our soldiers and that there were amongst the five shots Mausers thirty carbines while the rest were rifles, and as owing to a mistake all the cartridges shipped were for the rifles and the carbines remained useless without cartridges, we have asked our mutual friend Captain Shakespear, to wiite to our friend His Honour Colonel Cox, to obtain for us a permission for purchasing twelve thousand cartridges which (usually) accompany the carbines and three thousand and four hundred more, the total being fifteen thousand cartridges. And we have advised our Agent, Mirza Hussain bin Abdul Baqi Nazafi. Isfahani, to refer to you. Inshallah, the permission has-been obtained and you have ordered the purchase to be made as written by Captain Shakespear. The question of shipment depends on your opinion. If^ you wish to decide whether the shipment should be made by boat or by mail, the latter is prefer able to the former, because the boat-owner may, if he obtained permission, venture to ship others. The mail is therefore more desirable, and your opinion is higher. This is what was to be stated and please continue to furnish me with news of your health and that of the Madame and accept my assurance of esteem. 170 Telegram P., No. 495, dated the 30th (received 31st) May 1911.

India Office, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to invite reference to serial numbers 128, 137, and 156 in the printed cor respondence^ regarding the arms traffic, forwarded to you in this The Government of India recommend that the Sheikh be informed that immunity will be granted for the immediate passage of 2,000 Martini rifles, 500 magazine rifles, 525,000 Martini cartridges, and 150,000 magazine cartridges, and hereafter annually of 2,000 weapons (and presumably, a corresponding amount of ammunition), provided that, in consultation with the British Agent, he will devise, and agree to adopt, such safeguards as shall appear to the Government of India practical and adequate. That the Turkish Government will strongly object to any such arrangement seems highly probable, for it will be remembered that in the conversation between Hakki Pasha and Sir H. Babington-Smith, reported in the latter’s letter to Sir A. Nicolson, of 30th December Jast, the Grand Vizier complained that “under British protection . . . . “ Koweit wms the centre of the contraband arms traffic, and a source of “ continual conflict with her neighbours.” In the general settlement of outstanding questions in the Persian Gulf which is about to be proposed to the Turks, the autonomy of Koweit will presumably be included, even though Basra may be selected as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway ; and it may well be that if the Turks are led, by the arrange ment now proposed, to suppose that among the disadvantages to themselves resulting from the recognition of the Sheikh’s position will be the perpetuation of the conditions complained of by the Grand Vizier, the success of the negotiations will be imperilled. If the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regards this as a real risk, the Earl of Crewe would not press the present proposals, though for his own part he would be prepared, on a general view of all the interests involved, to ignore Turkish susceptibilities in this matter, and would greatly prefer to see the Government of India’s recommendation adopted.

Nicolson.—{Received Januarg 6, 1911.) Banque nationale de Turquie, Constantinople, (Extract. ) December 30, 1910. I SAW the Grand Vizier yesterday, and I enclose a memorandum of our conversation. # ***** Hakki Pasha, in the course of our conversation, dwelt a good deal on the Bagdad question and on the situation in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. He stated distinctly that he thought the railway on its present footing must be made as far as Bagdad. This is significant in connection with the reports which are current, that negotiations have been begun for the early construction of the line between Helif and Bagdad, and also in connection with the paragraphs in Djavid Bey’s budget statement, in which he refers to the Bagdad question, and points out that in five years’ time, the earliest date at which the line could be completed, the surplus of the debt revenues will probably have increased sufficiently to provide the guarantee as far as Bagdad, and that the Germans, therefore, will lose nothing by abandoning their lien upon the proceeds of the increased customs duties. The Grand Vizier also stated distinctly that it would be necessary to arrive at some arrangement satisfactory to England about the section between Bagdad and the Gulf, and expressed his readiness to bring pressure to bear on the Germans, if necessary, in this direction. I do not know whether the general political situation as regards Germany makes it any more likely now that they would be prepared to come to terms ; but it is evident, in the first place, that we have no means of preventing the German line from reaching Bagdad, and, in the second place, that friction is likely to become more, and more acute unless some settlement is reached. Such a settlement would, in itself, improve our relations with the Turks also, and I confess 1 do not see why we should not at the same time give the Turks some satisfaction regarding Koweit, if we obtain binding engagements regarding its alienation or use as a “ port de guerre.” I will not, however, write more on this subject, as I hope I may have the opportunity of seeing you shortly in London. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum of Interview with Hahki Pasha, Grand Vizier, on December 29, 1910. I INFORMED Hakki Pasha that I was leaving for London in a few days, and that it would be necessary to arrive at a decision regarding the future of the National Bank. As he was aware, recent events had raised grave doubts^ as to whether the bank could with advantage continue its operations. The decision^ of this question would depend, in great measure, upon the prospect of obtaining active and practical support from the Government. The bank would never have been started unless the invitation of the Ottoman Government and the attitude of the British Government had given it expectation of support from both. . Hakki Pasha said that in England there appeared to be a mistaken idea that, because a concession had been given for the Bagdad Railway, the ground was entire y occupied, and there was no room for any other enterprises in Turkey.^ This, he sai , was a complete mistake. The Bagdad Railway was an existing concession. I it ^' ei ' e to be given again, it would very likely be arranged in a different fas ion , u , anyhow, there it was, and it could not be revoked. But the Turkish Empire was large, and there was room for very many other enterprises which were open no 7 to German capital, but to British capital; and British capital would be heartily welcomed. , ., , , I said that I did not think that this erroneous view was held by anyone who was well informed. It was undoubtedly true that the Bagdad question had assumed [1852/—3]2 great importance in the relations between England, Turkey, and Germany, both in itself and also in relation to the position in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf generally. If the Bagdad question could be settled in a satisfactory manner, I was convinced that it would have an admirable effect on the relations of the three countries. Hakki Pasha said that the question of Koweit was at the root of the Turkish feeling about British action in that part of the world. On this subject he spoke strongly He said that he regarded it as beyond doubt that British action in relation to Koweit I had been unjust. Under British protection, although there was not a protectorate in the technical sense of the word, Koweit was the centre of the contraband arms traffic and a source of continual conflict with its neighbours. So long as this anomalous state of affairs existed, it was impossible to restore peace and order in that part of the world. Koweit was like a thorn stuck in the side of Turkey ; and it was British action there more than anywhere else that had created suspicions of British aims in Mesopotamia. I said that I was not acquainted with the details of the question, but whatever the rights or wrongs of the matter, his Highness knew perfectly well that British action regarding Koweit was not directed against Turkey, but against the possibility of Koweit falling into other hands. The Grand Vizier said that he quite realised this, but that practically the action taken by way of defence against another Power operated as against Turkey. It was not in any way Turkey s interest or desire to permit any other Power to establish itself there. Even under the old regime, Abdul Hamid had not permitted the Germans to acquire a coaling station in the Red Sea. The new regime would be even more strongly opposed to any such acquisition. If there were any doubt as to this, Turkey would he willing to take formal engagements as to the use of Koweit as a naval station. He said that, in his opinion, the matter was one that ought to be capable of settlement if there was good-will on both sides ; but he complained that he had been unable to obtain a frank and full discussion of the question, which was the first condition of an understanding. I said that the matter was not one in which I was entitled to express an opinion, but that I saw with great regret the extreme sensitiveness of Turkish opinion as regards the most innocent and legitimate activities of British shipping and commerce in the Gulf. I referred to a recent article by Ismail Hakki Babanzadb, in which the presence of British shipping at Bussorah and the extent of British trade there were treated as matters of offence and indications of sinister intentions ; whereas it was clearly essential to the prosperity of the country to welcome all the shipping and trade that could come, whatever the nationality. Hakki Pasha replied that articles in the press must not be taken too seriously. Ismail Hakki Babanzade had just returned from Bagdad and Bussorah ; and what had produced more impression on him than any tiling else was the question of Koweit. The Grand Vizier then returned to the question of the Bagdad Railway. He said that the Germans must be allowed to complete the line to Bagdad, but that he quite recognised that beyond Bagdad it was necessary to find some arrangement which would satisfy England. W hat precise solution was to be preferred he could not say. The Germans had certain “ droits acquis,” and clearly any arrangement must be a matter for negotiation; and it was for the interests concerned to formulate proposals. The Turkish Government would be very anxious to arrive at a settlement, and would be prepared to bring pressure on the Germans with this object. One solution would be to l |ne south of Bagdad an international one ; another solution would be that it should be a Turkish Government line, a suitable arrangement being made with the interests concerned for providing the capital. As regards the position of Turkey generally, he said emphatically that, in his view, it vyas most undesirable to give any one Power an exclusive or preponderant influence in Turkish affairs. He wished to remain on good terms with all the world; and the interests of Turkey lay in securing the assistance of all the Powers equally for her development. I fl 1611 spoke again of the position of the bank. I said that so far the bank had received no practical evidence of the Government’s desire to support it. No Govern- ment accounts had been given to us, and the only semi-official account we had was that o t e Commission de la I lotte. T he Constantinople loan had only been arranged after competition with other banks, and after a struggle lasting over several months. I asked whether he could give me any assurances of practical support in the future which I could lay before our friends in London. Hakki Pasha said that, as regards Government accounts, their hands were tied to a very considerable extent by the termsof the concession of the Ottoman Bank. The Constantinople municipal loan had produced profit sufficient to cover the expenses of the bank for one year at any rate. If the bank had been able to conclude the loan recently under discussion, the profits would have provided for the bank for two or three years at least. Unfortunately, this had been prevented by the action of the British Government, which, he said, speaking quite unomcially. he could only describe as a blunder. If the British Government did not interpose any bar in future the National Bank would be able to take part in Government loans, either in co-operation with the Ottoman Bank or in competition with it.^ Apart hom that, he lepeated that the whole of Turkey was open to foreign enterprise, and that foreign capital would be welcomed. If British capital would come to take part in the development of the country, there would be a profitable field for the bank s eneigies. He regretted that British capital had taken so little interest in Turkey in recent years, and thought that both the press and commercial circles were not well-informed. He referred in this connection to the mining law, in the amendment of which the British Government had taken a great interest. The law had been amended, but in the two years which had elapsed since then there had not, so far as he was aware, been a single British application for a mining concession. I replied that British capital had had very good reasons for avoiding the country under the old regime; and in order to persuade it to come here now it was necessary to offer adequate inducements, and to create the conditions necessary for success. In the case of mines, for instance, the absence of roads and railways made all mines, except the richest, unremunerative. This accounted for the absence of applicants. As regards works of public utility we found, unfortunately, a certain want of practical sense in the Public Works Department. With the object of securing advantages to the State concessions were hedged round with impossible conditions. It would be to the real interest of the Government to grant the first concessions on terms which would make them thoroughly remunerative; whereas the conditions now laid down were such that there could not be a large profit, and that there might very likely be no profit at all. Hakki Pasha admitted that there was truth in what I said, but added that, in his own opinion, this difficulty would disappear in time. At the outset of a parliamentary regime, there was a tendency to criticise everything. In the endeavour to avert such criticism, the conditions had perhaps been drawn too tightly. Experience would remedy these defects. I asked the Grand Vizier whether they proposed to approve the Bagdad municipal loan. He said that he had been somewhat disappointed as regards the administrative capacities of Nazim Pasha, and that they had doubted whether the money would be satisfactorily spent if it were granted. He thought, however, that they would come to the decision to support Nazim Pasha still, and in that case they would approve the loan. I represented that it was very desirable to decide the matter as soon as possible, since my letter to Nazim Pasha, resuming our liberty of action in the matter, had probably reached him, or would reach him in a day or two. I added that it might have some influence as regard the future of the banks if I could point to one business, at any rate, though not a large one, which had been concluded. Hakki Pasha said that he would endeavour to hasten the decision. H. BABINGTON SMITH. December 29, 1910.67 No. 102—1462 XIV K., dated Bombay, the 10th May 1911. From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. Be pleased to lay before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council the following report on the present condition of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. 2 . The passage of arms from the Oman to the Mekran and Biyaban Coast of Persia has practically ceased. A few attempts are still made to smuggle small quantities of rifles and ammunition across, but they are not of sufficient importance to constitute a danger. 3 . Arms penetrate into the centre of Persia on their way to the Afghan frontier by two main routes, one from the Mekran Coast, via Bint, and the other from the Biyaban Coast via Serzeh, Jaghin and Gurg. The action of the Expeditionary Eorce has demonstrated that both routes are unsafe, and the result is that, as far as our present information shows, the Afghans hare withdrawn from Mekran and Biyaban entirely.68 A. Prom the Mekran Coast the route lies along the bank of the Rapeh river, where abundance of fresh water is to be found at all seasons of the year (as is evident from the fact that large fish were seen by several officers in the upper reaches of the river), grazing is plentiful, access to and from the fertile Bint-Geh valley is comparatively easy, and from that district northwards the route although difficult in parts, is short. The majority of the arms landed on this coast find their way to the Bint-Geh valley, and thence to the interior. 5. During the south-w r est monsoon landing on the Mekran Coast is very difficult, except at a few more or less sheltered spots under favourable condi tions. It is then that the Biyaban Coast requires the greater attention, as it is easy with a good breeze to slip across the 30 miles of open water from Mussandam in a night. The road runs right along the Biyaban Coast instead of touching it only at certain points, as in Mekran. With the help of the villagers on the Biyaban Coast the arms-runners are able to get away arms and ammunition to the hills without much difficulty before they can be seized, and it is therefore of the utmost importance to keep such a hold over the villagers on the coast as will ensure the refusal of their help to the gun runners. Having once reached safety in the mountains the arms are out of our reach, and usually are taken north via Jaghin, Gurg and Nasratabad. 6. The action taken at sea has resulted in the almost complete cessation of attempts to run cargoes, but signs have been evident lately that they would begin again if sufficient support could be obtained on the coast. Afghans came down in considerable numbers to Panooch and Bint recently, and many of them joined Barkat Khan, who apparently persuaded them that he could arrange to get the arms through, as he had done in former years, in spite of our efforts to stop them. 7. This Chief, Barkat Khan, is actively hostile and he has been taking very strong measures to drive out the nominal head of the Biyaban district, and to bring the villagers that are now under the control of the latter completely into his own power. He hoped that after effecting this he would be able to reorganise the whole scheme of arms-running to his own advantage. The result would have been a repetition of the state of affairs on that coast which prevailed from 1906-10, only possibly worse, because pushed by necessity it would probably have been better organised. 8. Barkat has had considerable success, and several villages, particularly those which lie back from the coast and have not felt our presence, have assisted him with men and in kind. He has also drawn largely on the Bashakard tribe, with whom he is connected by marriage with the daughter of Ghulam Hussain, the Chief of Yakdar. The latter Chief was at one time quite friendly, but since Barkat’s marriage he has been more and more influenced by his son-in-law, until he has now definitely sided against the British. In fact, Barkat’s evil influence is felt principally through his matrimonial connections. The father of his first wife is Mir Haji, who has been put into Barkat’s place, but is quite untrustworthy, and will only side with us as long as we can protect him. Islam Khan is the father of his second wife, and the attitude that he has adopted is largely due to the persuasion of his son-in-law. Ghulam Hussain is the father of Barkat’s third wife. Meshedi Abbas is the father of his fourth wife. At the time Barkat married her, Meshedi Abbas was head of the Persian Customs at Jask, and was in consequence most useful to his son-in-law in conniving at the import of arms, until his removal was brought about towards the end of 1909. 9. Prom the foregoing it is evident that the central figure in the Mekran and Biyaban districts is Barkat Khan. If he can continue to impress his various fathers-in-law, particularly Islam Khan, as well as the villagers along the Biyaban Coast with the idea that the British can be safely defied, then we must not expect assistance from them, but on the contrary a decided recru descence of activity may be looked for next season, with regular visits from Afghan purchasers. In fact, the market will be reorganised with fresh vigour,I X 69 and any reduction of naval expenditure will be out of tbe question. If, on the other band, it can be shown that disregard of the wishes of Great Britain and support of Barkat Khan entails severe chastisement, then we may hope that he will he discredited, and that those who are now uncertain which side to take will decide to go with us and forbid the entry of Afghans into the district. The authority of the Persian Government does not exist in any shape or form in these districts, and therefore it is not of any use to expect assistance from them. The only time that they have attempted to assist us and agreed to keep Barkat in custody was disastrous, for he bribed his custodian and escaped very shortly after his arrival at Bushire, much to the discredit of British prestige. 10. I therefore decided to take advantage of a cargo of arms having been looted from a Kuwait dhow that had been recently stranded, to land the mili tary force at Sirik, in order to try to recover them, incidentally striking a heavy blow at Barkat and his following. The operations were entirely success ful. Barkat has been driven out of a position that he thought impregnable, with considerable loss. He himself thought discretion the better part of valour, and was at Sarh-i-Gurg during the action, far from all possibility of harm. The Bashakard tribe stood aloof as a whole, and even the Tarzeh section, to which Barkat’s father-in-law Ghulam Hussain belongs, deserted him after the fight. The Afghans who had been with him disappeared, and all who have in any way assisted him have felt the hand of the British and seen the troops in their villages. It is hoped that this will effectively discredit Barkat, parti cularly as some of his own personal property has been destroyed as retaliation for the damage that he has done to the villages of those who were friendly. 11. On the Mekran Coast, Saiyid Khan has been loyal as far as he is able, and has endeavoured to prevent the Afghans from making his country a base of operations. On the other hand, Islam Khan has not been above suspicion, and influenced no doubt by his son-in-law, Barkat Khan, he has been watchin^ the development of events before deciding how to act. Although nominally under Saiyid Khan, he is by far the more powerful personality of the two, and since he controls the coast districts round the mouth of tbe Rapch river, he is an important person in connection with the arms traffic. 12. The expedition which was landed once at Galag in 1910, but which did not advance in force into the Karwan district (Rapch river), shock Islam Khan’s confidence, and since then he has been considering the idea of taking a subsidy from us, and of keeping the Afghans out of his territory. Apparently Barkat has been trying to persuade him otherwise, and it is possible that the latter arranged that a large caravan should arrive at Fanooch and Bint just at the moment when the question of the subsidy was under consideration, in order to bring pressure to bear on him. This the Afghans undoubtedly did, whether at Barkat’s suggestion or not, and at the time when the expedition arrived on the coast Islam Khan was wavering, and had almost decided to go against us, and to forego his subsidy. It was therefore of great importance to demonstrate to him that he could be struck at without difficulty from the sea, and advantage was taken of a reported depot of arms at Joshder, a place north west of Karkmdar, and of another at Sarahingi, to advance the whole force through his territory and make a dash for Bint. 13. The column was accompanied by Saiyid Khan during the whole time, but he was frequently under the influence of opium, and was of little use! Islam Khan also joined the force, but was rather sceptical of the ability of the troops to do much. After he had accompanied the column on one or two marches, however, and particularly after the dash on Bint he appears to have completely altered his tone. It is now obvious to him that the Bint-Geh valley is open to attack from the sea within about six days from the time of arrival on the coast, and that Great Britain therefore has the power of enforcing her will if it ever should become necessary to do so. 14. The force did not have any fighting in Mekran and Islam Khan, therefore, has not had a demonstration of its capabilities in that respect! During the operations in the Biyaban district, however, the troops turned Barkat out of reputed impregnable position with considerable loss to the tribesmen. The position was far worse than anything met with on the way to Bint, andthe necessary object-lesson has been supplied to Islam Khan. The accounts of this fight which have circulated through the country have not lost in repeti- tion, and it is hoped that Islam Khan has now come to the conclusion that it will be more to his advantage to accept the British subsidy and loyally act up to its conditions. 15. On the Persian Coast and the coasts of the islands to the westward there has been a persistent rumour that arms are being run to Kishm, Charak, Shiwu, Tahiri, and other places along the coast towards Bushire. The arms for Kishm and Charak are said to come from the Trucial Coast, and for the other places from Katar. It is known that arms go overland from Oman to the Trucial Coast and also by Kuwait dhows to Katar, but we have so far not been able to find any arms in the course of transit from either of these districts to the Persian Coast. Now that the immediate danger on the Mekran and Biyaban Coasts has passed away, I have arranged for a closer watch over the dhows coming from the Arabian Coast inside the Persian Gulf. One Kuwait dhow which has been caught with arms on board will be burnt, and it is hoped that the example will deter others from shipping contraband cargoes. 16. The quantity of arms and ammunition run by these routes into Persia is probably not large, and seeing the enormously increased price of transport, it does not seem likely to be a very paying speculation to attempt to pass them up into Afghanistan. With the exception perhaps of those brought to Kishm most of the rifles landed are said to be absorbed in Persia itself. 17. Large quantities of arms and ammunition are still being imported into Maskat, principally by German steamers, and their destination is a matter of speculation. Probably most of them go by land or land and sea combined to Katar, and thence I am inclined to think that the greater part find their way into the Arabian Peninsula. It seems to me that the Arabs are arming themselves as rapidly as they can, and that they all view the revolt in the Yemen against the Turk with considerable sympathy, and this being so it seems probable that the difficulties which formerly w r ere said to exist over the passage of arms from the coast to the interior have become very much modified. This is pure speculation, but it is the only way in which I can account for the continued import of arms into Maskat. I feel sure that only a small proportion of them reach the Persian Coast, while the remainder disappear entirely from our view. It w^ould appear that the latter must be conveyed into Arabia, where it is probable that a very large demand exists for the most modern type, which is all that is now imported into Maskat. 18. This is not a permanent deflection of the business, and if through any lack of vigilance on our part it again became possible to run the arms across to Mekran, the trade would immediately revive, because the profits by this route are much more considerable than they can be by the long land route to Central Arabia. 19. There is lastly the question of bow to deal with Mm skat itself. In 11n this connection I have nothing to add to the telegram of Colonel Cox, No. 388,* dated the 28th April 1911, addressed to the Foreign Department, with which I thoroughly agree. I am strongly in favour of the second alternative proposed by him, namely, to give the Sultan sufficient financial inducement to make him separate from Ali Musa and his confederates, and afford real co-operation by the introduction of an effective system for the registration of arms import ed and sold subject to friendly supervision by us, or by other similar means. I think that this will go a long way towards keeping the arms under control. Every rifle and every box of ammunition coming into Maskat should be registered both on entry and on being re-exported. Arms and ammunition going out of the country by sea to a legitimate destination should be declared, and, if it were found that false declarations had been made for the purpose of smuggling into prohibited areas, a remedy could be devised which would hit the exporter severely. All arms moving coast-wise from one place to another in Oman territory would have to be accounted for under severe penalties, and by this means we might succeed in making it more difficult to smuggle arms out of the country. These measures will not give us complete security, and a71 v 1 IV I * ■; watch would still hare to be maintained, but it would take the form of a preventive service on the coast of Oman itself, rather than a large blockade of a considerable extent of the coast of Persia. 20. In consequence of the success of the operations of the Expeditionary- Force, I propose, as an experiment, to pay off two launches during June and have ordered them to arrive at Bombay towards the end of May. I would ask that their gun and special fittings may not be removed, so that if it be found next season that we cannot do without them, they may be ready to be sent up again at short notice. This will leave four launches in the Gulf, which I pro pose to keep going during the hot weather. 21. It is possible that towards the end of the year I may be able to recommend steps which will lead to a further considerable reduction of expenses. I cannot make any definite statement on the subject, however, until I have seen how the situation settles down during the hot weather and the early part of next season, but I feel fairly confident that matters will so shape themselves as to enable this step to be taken in November or December. 22. I hope that next season the force that will be sufficient to keep the trade from reviving will be the three subsidised ships, with the “ Fox ” as Senior Officer, and four launches. It would he necessary that the subsidised ships should be effective vessels, however, with full white crews, not vessels like the “ Lapwing” and “ Kedbreast” which carried partly lascar crews. The “ Odin” and “ Espiegle” that have taken the place of the two gunboats are quite satisfactory and suitable for this purpose, while the “ Sphinx”, which does Vt-ry well for the work in the Gulf in the hot weather, is generally at Bombay for three or four months during the cold weather refitting, when her place is taken by a more effective ship. • .(i *r ?; jji i -r• . .-.0 • .. &gt; 154 No. 89—1462 XIV N., dated H.M.S. “ Highflyer” at Sirik, the 15th April 19il.

At 8-30 p.m. whilst standing down the coast under oars and when about three miles to southward of Sahm and about three and a half miles from the shore, I sighted a badan with her sail lowered. I boarded her and proceeded to search her. The Nakhoda at first denied having any cargo except fish, but a superficial search showed her to be full of rifles and ammunition. The Nakhoda then produced papers purporting to be passes from the Sultan of Maskat. I considered them unsatisfactory, and detained the badan, placing a guard on board her, and took her in tow. 3. At 4 a. m. on Thursday, 6th idem, whilst standing to the southward and when about five miles to the southward of Sahm and three and a half miles off the coast, I sighted a badan under sail standing to the northward. I, waited until she was close and hailed her to lower her sail. She held on, but after two rifle-shots had been fired (the second through her sail) she lowered her sail and I proceeded alongside and searched her. The Nakhoda stated that his cargo was fish, but on removing the upper part of the cargo a quantity of rifles and ammunition was found. The Nakhoda then produced a permit purporting to allow him to trade in arms and bearing the stamp of the Sultan of Maskat. This I considered to be unsatisfactory, and detained the badan, placing a guard on board her. A light south-easterly breeze was blowing throughout the night. I then proceeded inshore with the two badans in tow, and anchored in shallow water until daylight. 4. On Thursday a Shamal set in, making a lee shore.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to Foreign Department telegram* No. S.—311, dated the 13th instant, regarding the • senai No. 137 . Shaikh of Kuwait’s requirements in the direction of arms and ammunition. 2. The Shaikh has generally pledged himself not to let the arms and ammunition, which he gets permission to import, find their way into unauthorised hands. He also expressed verbally, during the recent interview of His Excel lency the Commander-in-Chief and myself with him, his readiness to allow the Political Agent supervisory access to them. That alone would not necessarily regulate the destination of the munitions once they left the warehouse, but I suggest that, if before exportation from Maskat the stocks of the rifles were branded with a special device, which w r ould make them at once identifiable if found outside their legitimate sphere, and if they were issued in Kuwait under arrangements subject to the supervision of our Political Agent, a fairly effective check upon their distribution would be achieved. As regards cartridges, I can only at present suggest that Shaikh Mubarak should be required to produce 75 per cent of the empty cases of those last indented for, each time a fresh indent is presented. 3. I think he could in all probability be got to introduce safeguards on the above lines, but the Government of India will understand that it would be inconvenient for the Political Agent or me to discuss them with him now, if we shall subsequently have to inform him that his indent is considered by the Government of India to be excessive and must be reduced. I therefore recommend that the Government of India first decide arbi trarily what they will consider to be Shaikh Mubarak’s legitimate requirements and that the latter be informed that we will give him immunity for the passage of those amounts if, in consultation with the Political Agent, he will devise and agree to adopt such safeguards on the above lines as shall appear to the Government of India practical and adequate. 4. I presume that the case of the dhow “ Fateh-el-Khair ” referred to in your telegram under reply is that reported in my letter No. 1297 of 22nd May 1910. The Shaikh’s attitude has a good deal improved since then and in the recent case concerning a dhow of the same t senai No. 98. name, referred to in my telegram! No. 370 of 24th April, it has been quite satisfactory. 5. While I fully realise that we should allow political considerations to influence us as little as possible when dealing with practical issues arising out , i 0 f the arms traffic problem, I think we need to bear in mind at the present juncture that the reports in the vernacular papers regarding Sir Edward Grey’s121 Telegram P v No. 46, dated Maskat, the 3rd May 1911. From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. (Repeated to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.) I would offer the followiug observations with reference to your teleoram * • Serial No. 118 . No. 115—182 M., dated 2nd May° 1911. a i • , Barkat Khan is the principal Agent in the traffic id arms in Persian Baluchistan, and it was at his invitation that the Afghans came down this year. Barkat Khan was, according to reports, boasting that, with a view to assisting him, they were comin^ in lar^e numbers from Fanooeh. It appears that the villages which are loyal to us have been raided by Barkar, with the sole object of obliging them to give active assistance to the Afghans and to him, as it is not possible to make sure of getting away a cargo even after it has been landed, without this assistance from the villages on the coast. Mir Haji and Mir Kambar who, at our suggestion, were placed in charge of the coast of Biyaban and who have shown their loyalty by refraining from assisting gun-runners, complained that lately some of their men had been killed and their followers had extensively been looted by Barkat Khan. It was reported by the representatives of those who had been loored, who came into .Task, that, violence had been used by Barkat Khan who gave out that those who followed him would not be molested, and that the friends of the Sircar would be looted. The fact that during these raids the Afghans were with Barkat Khan was known, and it is said that he was joined afterwards by many more. In connection with these operations it was recently admitted by the Governor of the ports on the coast to the Political Besident, Persian Gulf, that the former had no force or means to act against Barkat Khan. That in * these regions the Government of Persia are powerless, is notorious, and if we had not taken action, the assistance of any of the people of the coast in the matter of the suppression of the traffic in arms could not any longer be counted upon by us, and an extremely difficult situation would have been created. It would probably have been said by Barkat Khan that lie had driven us off and his prestige with the Afghans would have enormously increased. During the south-west monsoon the Biyaban is the eashst coast for purposes of the arms traffic. Except rarely, arms running on the coast of Mekran during the monsoon is almost impossible. Tne coast of Biyaban being only ‘^0 miles from the coast of Oman, is also the most difficult one to guard, and dhows which are certain of being received on the other side in a friendly manner, can easily go across unobserved and land arms. As stated in t Serial N a.H7,p» rt v l i my telegramf Iso. 16 dated the 26th February 1911, it is therefore most im portant that, unless we are prepared to continue for an indefinite period the blockade on a costly scale (the resumption of hostilities?), with the help of the Mirs and villages on the coast should be maintained. It will be possible in a short time to make a very large reduction in the expense of the blockade if we succeed in breaking the power of Barkat Khan over these Mirs and villages.■■ v i 60 In the circumstances explained above, and seeing that the movements in question would have a greater bearing on the issue of the arms traffic opera tions than the seizure of cargo of ammunition and arms, I thought it advisable to carry them out when I received the telegram from the Government of India quoted above, the troops had already been ordered to re-embark. 122 Telegram P., No. 4 &gt; 7 , dated Jask, the 4th May I9ll.

From —Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C I E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to solicit the views of the Government of India on the subject of the right of the Shaikh of Kuwait to import from Maskat or from Europe such arms and ammunition as he needs for the supply of his own re quirements, and as to the limits of what we can properly and safely regard as his “ reasonable requirements.” 2. Last autumn, our blockade operations having for some time past made it impossible for him to get arms up from Maskat in the ordinary way, Shaikh Mubarak applied for a permit of immunity for the safe conveyance of a consignment from Maskat, in replacement of some 2,000 weapons purloined or surrendered by his Bedouin adherents during their unsuccessful operations against the forces of the Muntafik under Shaikh Saadun,.in the previous spring. After consultation with the Political Agent at Kuwait, and being satisfied with the bond fides of the Shaikh’s needs, I requested the Political . ^ . . t&gt; .. , v 9Hsn Agent at Maskat* and the Senior Naval • Vide t'ncl &gt;sure8 to Residency letter No. 2880, » #* j.i_ c dated 2ytb October 191U, to the Foreign Depart- (Jmcer to arrange for ttlC Sale passage of ment - the arms, while taking the necessary precautions to ensure that the Nakhodas of the dhows employed did not smuggle up additional weapons under cover of the immunity granted to the Shaikh. These arms duly reached Shaikh Mubarak, the despatch of the last batch being reported by Major Trevor on 17th November. 3. Meanwhile the slump in the sale price of rifles at Maskat continued, and Shaikh Mubarak wrote that, owing to the extreme favourableness of tue market, he was anxious to bring up further supplies and beggedthat the permit be extended to cover them. In replying, I impressed upon him the inexpediency of bringing up more at present and thus aflording material to the hostile criticism of his enemies and tne accusation that he was trading in arms; butthis only drew forth a further appeal. His Excellency the Naval Commander- in-Chief arrived in the north of the Gulf about this time and added his advice to mine, namely, that if Shaikh Mubarak must buy more arms he should keep them in Maskat until next year and not bring them up now: it was not lon» however, before the Shaikh renewed his importunities for a permit to brine* them up at once. Meanwhile copies of the hostile articles of Ismail Hakld Bey in the Turkish newspaper “ Tannin ” reached me and on the return of the Political Agent and myself from tour, the former was directed to draw Shaikh Mubarak’s attention to these articles,—which specifically accused the Shaikh of making an arms emporium of Kuwait—and to reiterate my advice to postpone further import: again when I visited Kuwait a few days Inter with His Excellency Sir Edmond Slade, we once more urged on the Shaikh the advisability of postponing further importation for the present. He deferred to our advice, but begged me to represent, his point of view to the Government of India in the meanwhile and I expressed my readiness to do so. 4. His position, as he explains it, is as follows :— (i) Kuwait is an emporium for the trade of Central Arabia, both for export from the land side and for import by sea. Bv sea, trade is happily rendered safe for ail by the dispositions of Pax Britannica; but for the safety of trade by land he has to make provision; and, for his own good name, to ensure the safetv of merchandise and travellers from molestation by Bedouin within his sphere of influence. To this end he has to maintain himself in a position of armed strength sufficient to enable him to control the routes both from northern and southern Neid to Kuwait. J (ii) He has been put to abnormal trouble and expenditure in men and arms during the last two years by the hostility of the Muntafik and his unsuccessful encounter with them of *last spring. (iii) His Bedouin adherents are hopelessly wasteful of their ammuni tion, emptying their rifles at the slightest temptation at birds, hares, or anything else that may give them a mark, and it is' impossible to check this habit, from which an enormus wastage of ammunition results. (iv) Every year 1,000 or more hoys of the Kuwait community reach manhood and pass in to the fighting strength of the town and have to be provided witli rifles. (v) Lastly, that vyhereas previous to our operations he had no difficulty in supplying his va ants in emergency from arms retailed by local traders in Kuwait; now, as the result of his loyal co-opera tion with us in forbidding and preventing the export, the local arms trade in his town is altogether stopped and there is not a new rifle to be purchased in the place. . Eor these reasons he has to rely on our allowing him to exercise his right to import what he wants for his own needs and giving him immunitv for their passage up the Gulf. ^ r 6 . He specifically wants to import now, or as soon as we will permit him (and begs that permission may not be long delayed) 1 2,000 Martini rifles, 500 Magazine rifles, 1,050,000 Martini cartridges, 300,000 Magazine cartridges, and states that after that, his regular requirements in future will be about 2,000 rifles per annum with a proportionate amount of ammunition. 6 . On the one hand, we hare to reckon at present with a very hostile iurkish press; the passage of arms up from Maskat covered by a pass from ourselves is not a matter which can be prevented from becoming public • and in our own interests we need to make sure that we are not taken advantage of and the arms imported for disingenuous purposes. 6On the Shaikh e beha f it can be said that the reasons which he giyes are founded on fact; that ultimately he has the right, and cannot be prevented from getting what arms he needs; and that we cannot fairly hinder him from obtaining what he really wants for his own protection; and finally, that s^ far as our present experience goes, Shaikh Mubarak’s attitude in the matter of co-operation with us, and in refraining from supporting his own subiects when in the wrong has been eminently satisfactory. This opinion I know His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief shares. While, therefore I felt bound to do my utmost to discourage the Shaikh from further imports at present and m any ease did not feel justified in authorising them without refer ence to Government; yet I am of opinion that we should, if possible, allow him to get the arms at present asked for, and that 2,00'J weapons per annum wouM not be an unreasonable figure to be guided by in future; always provided that Shaikh Mubarak continues, as at present, to act up to his obligations in co-operating with us for the suppression of the contraband traffic. 7. I trust that I have gone into the matter sufficiently to enable Gov ernment to favour me with their views and instructions. 131 No. 1 (Camp), dated Persian Gulf, the 23rd April (received 10th May) 1911. From—E. G. Gregson, Esq., Superintendent of Police on Special Duty, Government of India, Foreign Department, To—The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to report that, in accordance with instructions from the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, I arrived in Charbar on the 28th March. 2. All transport arrangements were made for the force moving from Charbar, and Sardar Saiyid Khan of Geh was called into Charbar. Inform ation regarding the movements of Afghans was telegraphed to the Admiral from time to time. 3. armed On the 8th April I left Charbar with Sardar Saiyid Khan in the launch “ Tamil ” for Rapch. The force landed at Galag on the 10th55 —• -• ~ •- - 4. Sardar Saiyid Khan was prepared to render every assistance to the advance. It was evident from the very first, however, that he wished to avail himself of the occasion to embroil his cousin Sardar Islam Khan with the Government. Further, he was anxious for our troops to march to Bampur, where local politics apparently demanded his presence, and an escort would* undoubtedly have added much to his importance. 5. Sardar Islam Khan of Bint was informed by letter of our arrival. Before the receipt of the reply, however, a letter was received asking us not to believe the reports regarding his harbouring Afghans, and for Saiyid Ghafur Shah to be sent to bring him into our camp. Islam Khan arrived on the 15th. He announced his willingness to accompany the force, and protested his innocence as regards the reports of his complicity in the arms traffic. 6 . There was no doubt that the Afghans had used Bint and Fanooch as their head-quarters. A caravan of some five hundred of them with a thousand camels were reported at Haimani, a few miles beyond Fanooch. They had wandered in small numbers throughout Sardar Islam Khan’s province without any interference. Under these circumstances, Colonel Delamain, Commanding the troops, decided to march straight on Bint with a small body, in order to create the impression that acting as an advance guard we should go on to Fanuch. 7. Islam Khan was prepared, though evidentlv surprised at this un expected turn of events, to accompany the force. Sardar Saiyid Khan accom panied us the first march towards Kurandab, and then stayed* behind on the plea of ill-health. The troops after a short halt in the Bint valley (8! hours} returned on the 17th April. ' 8 . Our sources of information were the Sardars, and they informed us that the Afghans on our approach hurriedly left the tract of country near the coast, and on our further advance they moved out of Haimani on their return iourney to Afghanistan. 9. On the troops returning to Galag from Burka Bund, the Sardars agreed to accompany them, but at the last moment they sent in excusing themselves as it was not a very profitable undertaking. Saiyid Khan had important business in Bampur, and Islam Khan was afraid of coming to the coast for fear of arousing the jealousy of his cousin if he came alone with us. Of the two Sardars, Islam Khan is undoubtedly the most virile and the most important factor. Ihere is little doubt that his policy has been to gain all he can from the arms traffic by assisting Afghan gun-runners in every possible way and instructing his subjects to do the same: When called to account he pleads both his innocence and his inability to resist the incursions of lar^e bodies of Afghans. ° to Bint lies in its demonstrating to both 10. The value of the march Islam Khan and the Afghans our ability to strike right into the centre of Mekran VVe have at the same time strengthened the waning influence of bardar Saiyid Khan throughout Mekran, and hitherto his attitude has been in our favour. If both these Chiefs realise that we intend not only to drive the Afghan oU t* u gun-runners out of Mekran, but are prepared to enforce their own obligations to us, we shall have gone a very long way towards stopping the traffic in arms through Southern Persia. rr o r Under f If 1 iUth oB ^witb] in order to go on to od od tk (^liouis) Mdiisiki 'tlie coast, rnjoiiniej In any further communica tion on this subject, please' quote , 11 . 10820 . and address letter to— The Secretary, Admiralty, Whitehall, London, S.W.

Our correspondent writes from Jask, April 22, said ' ' 1 As your readers are aware, the flagship and two R.I.M. vessels left Bombay at 6 p.m. on April 7th for the Mekran coast, the exact destination being contingent on the reports received by wireless telegraphs during the passage up. Tire Mekran. coast whither we were bound is uninviting and barren. In many places, at Galag for instance (our ultimate rendezvous), the shore is a mere strip of very low sand, with extensive salt water swamps behind. No vegetation is to be seen from seaward, except here and there a clump of date palms, indicating the vicinity of a village or settlement. There are no peren nial rivers and near the sea the streams, which are frequently dry become mere salt water creeks only navigable for a short distance inland by small boats. There are no regular harbours on the Mekran coast t hough there are occasional r*oadsteads where the launches and boats engaged in the blockade find shelter from the prevailing shamals. Owing to information received en route, we set course for Galag where we arrived at 11 a.m. on the 10th. Khor Galag proved to be a small creek in an otherwise unbroken coastline where the surf breaks heavily all the year round. Unfortunately the entrance to the creek is barred by a sand spit, on which the sea was breaking heavily when we arriv ed, so it was decided to land the troops and mules on the open beach to save time- Dis embarkation was immediately proceeded with and found to be no light task. The troops and mules were towed ashore in lifeboats, eight of which had been specially fitted to carry mules. Four steam launches were employed in towing three boats at a time and thus there was a constant stream of boats going backwards and forwards from ships to shore—a distance of two miles. The scene on the surf-bound beach was a lively one. As each launch with its tow arrived at the outer fringe of surf it cast off and the boats were poled through the surf to the shore. In they came borne on the crest of a wave, and with a rush and a bump were brought up all standing on the shelving beach. At the same time each succeeding wave would come rolling in and throw the boats about in a most alarming manner. Out jumped the sepoys, and out jumped the mules, only too glad to set foot on shore again. The behaviour of the mules under what was to them a very trying time was excellent, and after their involuntary surf bath they rolled themselves in the ..hot sand with evident delight. The complete disembarkation of the expedition took longer than was anticipated owing to the weather conditions being unfavourable, but before the end of 24 hours the whole ex pedition ‘ was ashore and already on the march. I Some very amusing incidents occurred at the landing place. One boat, full of mules, when 50 yards from the shore, was completely cap sized by a big wave, all the mules being thrown into the water. Undismayed, they all struck out boldly on an exciting race for the shore, urged on by the cries of the sepoys on the beach. The race was won by a battery mule, a pot-bellied old creature who received on landing an ovation worthy of a Derby winner. On another occasion a boat-load of* cooking utensils capsized, and the sight of a 100 shrill-voiced sepoys clad in fiuris natur- alibus, wading in the surf in the endeavour to retrieve their pots and pans, was extremely diverting. Before noon the last of the expedi tion had disappeared over the sand hills on j their long march inland. BLOCKADE OP THE COAST. While lying at anchor off Galag, which is nine miles east of Rapsch, we were visited by several of the launches and boats who are engaged in the blockade of the Mekran coast. At the time of writing there are four launches and ten ship’s boats engaged on this work. Each of them has a section of the coast to patrol about ten miles in length, with orders to search every dhow they see. ‘ They are detached from their parent ships for as long as four or live weeks at a time, and live a hard and excit- ing life in their diminutive floating homes. The use of a razor is apparently unknown, as with out exception every officer, and man too, was bearded like the pard. They all looked very fit and hard as nails, and lamented the fact that, since the blockade has become so close, “no business is doing.’’ 1 he coastline patrolled by these vessels stretches from Gwatar to Jask and the mesh is now drawn so fine that it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the gun-runners have abandoned this part of the coast altogether, at least for the present. The whole tendency of the gun-runners seems to be to shift the scene of operations further to the westward. The only recent capture of arms was on the Oman coast where at a plaee called Khor Kakan north-west of Muscat, opposite .Jask—the armed launch Miner on ihe 15th March made a haul of 150 rifles, 50 Mauser pistols, and 60,000 rounds of ammu nition. there is no doubt that with the advent of the hot weather and the military expediti n matters have come to a standstill. The gun-run ners are held up by the naval force and the consignees, the Ghilzais, are held up by the military force. Like Othello their “occupation is gone.” There is a vast quantity of arms and ammunition awaiting shipment in Muscat at the present moment * but the gun-runners realise the futility of at tempting 1 to Iknd them on the onposite coast. The Ghilzais, on the other hand, are daily becoming more impatient and it was reported ! that as late as April 9, the day previous to i the landing of the troops, a party of Ghilzais were in Rapsch. At the time of writing small bands of the more adventurous tribesmen are (gathered on the coast, and all boat’s crews have stringent orders not to land anywhere on the coast outside the Telegraph concession at Jask, and boats are warned to keep outside the creeks at Galag and Rapsch. The Espi- : egle is stationed in the Gulf of Oman, in the vicinity of Muscat, the Alert at Dibai and the Perseus and Philomel off the Mekran coast. RETURN GF THE LAND FORCE. At 4 a.m. on the morning! of the 21st, the landing parties of seamen and native crews from the R.I.M. ships were sent ashore to await the expected return of the expedition. Soon afterwards, before it was light, the ad vance guard were seen crawling slowly over the sand hills and a little later the whole force appeared in sight. They looked tired and dusty and were all anxious to get aboard again for a bath and clean clothes. The re-embarka tion commenced at once, this time half a mile up Galag creek, where there is little or no surf. In twelve hours the whole force were on board once more and before the last boat was well clear of the water the fleet had weighed and were heading 1 for Jask. Here the fleet arrived at half-past six on the morning of the 22nd, and are now lying preparatory to moving off again for another landing. Colonel Delamain and staff have gone ashore to seek information, and on their return the Northbrook is proceeding to Sirik and the Hardinge to Ras Jagiu. Up- to-date- everything connected with the expedi- j tion has been successful, and it is believed that ] after this next landing of troops, which wn pi'obably be to-morrow morning (Sunday 23rd) the object of the Mekran expedition will be accomplished.Brush with Outlaws. A later message says:—At Jask we learnt that the expedition was to pro ceed to Sirdk, a small fishing village in the Babiyan district, some 80 miles north of &lt;^Jask. We left Jask on the 23rd April, at 6 am., the Perseus, the Northbrook, and Hardinge, taking with us Mir Hajir, Sheikh of Sirik, who was accompanying the Expedi tion ostensibly as guide, counsellor and friend. He was an old man, about 70 years of age, and had two followers with him, and seemed greatly relieved to get back again to his own country. His story was to the effect that a certain Sheikh Barkat Khan, warrior and freebooter, ex-Governor of Babiyan, had burn ed his villages, raided his date groves and j stolen his cattle. Now Sheikh Barkat Khan J i* the son-in-law of Mir Hajir, and moreover the friend and intermediary of the Ghilzai j gunrunners and he had approached Mix Hajir with proposals to take an active part in supporting the gun-runners. This Mir Hajir had refused to do, as he said out of loyalty to the British Raj. Whereupon Bar kat Khan descended on Sirik and smote it ruthlessly, and Mir Hajir, unable or unwill ing to retaliate, had sought the protection of the British. So matters stood when the expedition arriv ed at Sirik, on the afternoon of the 23rd, and found there the armed launches Karanja and Mashona. Mir Hajir was sent ashore that afternoon; but the disembarkation of troops did not commence until the following morn ing at 4-30 a.m. Although taking place on a surf-bound beach with no shelter whatever from the prevailing Shamal, the disembarka tion proceeded without mishap. The mules have apparently got quite used to the rough handling they receive, and jump in and out of the boats as if to the manner born. At 3 p.m. the whole of the expedition was ashore and moved off inland, taking with them Mr' Hajir. The next morning the Admiral arrived ir the Flagship, and left again in the evening; but at 2-30 a.m., on the morning of the. 26th the flagship again returned. It appears that shortly after landing Mir Hajir had ap proached Colonel Delamain and informed him that he might expect to meet with serious opjiosition from Barkat Khan, who was then stationed with about 200 followers in the hills at a place called Pushak, some 29 miles in land. Colonel Delamain prompfiv sent wireless message to the Flagship, asking the Admiral to return and land as many Marines and Bluejackets as possible. The North brook and Hardinge were ordered to have all boats ready at half an hour’s notice to con vey the naval landing party ashore and every- ; body was on the tiptoe of excitement, expect ing a big fight, when a later message was received from the Colonel to say that rein forcements would not now be required, as Barkat Khan was not expected to make any serious opposition. “““““'“a brisk action. Colonel Delamain commenced march ing into the interior at once taking with him Mir Hajir. There are two ranges of hills here—one about five miles from the coast and the other some fifteen miles further inland. On the 28th the Force reached a pass leading through the second range of hills at a spot called Pushak—20 miles east of Sirik—and here it was on the hills above the pass that Mir Barkat Khan with some 180 followers was waiting- At an early hour on the 28th ^Col. Delamain received a note from Barkat Khan expressing regret that they had not been able , to meet earlier but hoping that their meeting would not now be long delayed. The Colonel s reply was to order a general advance into the pass, and at midday the enemy opened fire from the hillsides around—the range at times being less than 200 yards. The Mountain Battery was quickly brought into action and did most of the damage—one of the shells taking a man’s head clean off. Barkat Khan and his followers put up a good fight and it was not until 3 p.m. that the last of his men finally broke from their shelled-out sangars and fled. The enemy’s losses were as far as is known 8 killed and 14 wounded and 1 prisoner who was shot through both legs and captured. Our losses were three slightly wounded. After the action the Force camped for the night where they were and commenced the return march to Sirik the next morning, where they arrived at daylight on the 4th May. With regard to Mir Hajir, the worthy gentleman, after the action, 'tried to persu ade the Colonel not to advance further and to allow him to go and try and convert Barkat Khan to the British cause. This the Colonel wisely refused to do. Mir Hajir came down to the beach at Sirik to see the force embark, and presented Colonel Dglamin with a couple of fin© looking vegetable marrows as a peace offering. One other incident hap pened on the beach whilst re-embarking and that was the appearance of a woman closely veiled who begged to be allowed to take the only prisoner away. She was his sister—she said—and he was the only relative left to her. She was told that he would be taken to Task and cured of his wounds and then sent back to Sirik ; but she replied that she did not want him to be cured, she wanted to take him away. But the only prisoner now fattens in the hospital at Jask. MOVEMENTS AT SEA. On Saturday 29th April, the North brook left Sirik for Maskat. She went to i bring an extra 8 days land and 8 days sea i rations, also fresh vegetables and last, but J not least, the mails. On May 1st in company with the Fspiegle (who left with ab lights out), the Northbrook returned to Sirik. At 10 o’clock that same day when still some miles from Sirik she met the Flagship bound for Maskat, From her orders were re ceived to embark the force at Sirik on the 4th, leave at once for Kuhistak, 200 miles j further up the coast, and disembark the force there again. Then after taking 1 her mails and fresh provisions she proceeded on her way to Maskat while the Northbrook resumed the course to Sirik. Here she found the Hardinge and turn ed over to her - half the land and sea rations. But no sooner was this completed than “buzz” went the wireless and soon every body knew that all operations were to stop Everybody was’glad that the Mekran Expedition was over and took no pains to hide his joy. On the 3r’d we heard that the main body were encamped some half a dozen miles inland. At 4 a.m. the next morning away went all the (R. II. M. boats for the beach, some two miles i distant. At 5 a.m. the first boat load of mules were safely on board again and by 7 o clock in the evening the last three boats were ready to push off from the shore. But the fates had willed otherwise. For at that moment a nasty squall arose increasing the surf tremend msly. For two hours and a half did those three de voted boats try to battle their way out througtr the surf, but all to no- purpose. At 9-30 p-m. they gave up the unequal struggle. The force was just yet not to leave Sirik, for Sirik had not yet done with us. Willy nilly we had to camp on the beach for that night, for all' the world like shipwrecked mariners. Unfortun ately everybody’s baggage had been sent off to the ship earlier in the day. So there we were with nothing except the clothes we stood up in and they were soaked—150 sepoys and 6 officers with the lascar crews of the three boats. Fires were hastily lit and the shivering crowd gathered round to warm themselves as best they could. But Providence had not yet desert ed us. About half past eleven a launch was seen approaching the shore slowly buffeting along against the heavy sea that was now run ning 1 . She came quite close in—and we heard a welcome voice cry out through the darkness } of the night “Food and blankets.” You may be sure we soon had that food and those blan kets—and for the rest of the night we were more or less comfortable. At 5 a.m. the next morning the surf had gone down considerably and soon afterwards the “shipwrecked party” (as they were pleased to call themselves) were safe on board.THE RETURN. On Unu-sdny, 4th May, at 2 p.m., the Northbrook left Sink for good, the Hardinae having already proceeded to Bunji, a place further to the southward to pick up a detach ment there. At 10 o’clock in the morning- of the 5th we arrived at Chahbar and after mak- mg one or two transfers to the Flagship and Sox which we found at anchor there we left at noon the same day in company with the Flagship for Bombay. The Hardinge was astern of us having called at Task while we were at Chahbar. But sne spurted and caught us up and now (4 p.m. on Sunday afternoon the 7th—just a month later) the three ships— Flagship, Hardinge and Northbrook—are all steaming towards Bombay which we hope to reach at daylight to-morrow. His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- Chief, who arrived in Bombay on Monday morning, 8th May, from the Persian Gulf, is residing for a few days in the Admiral’s House. m V&gt;'^8!l In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote Confidential M*01084.

With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter* No. 1670, dated 22nd June • Serial No. 106. 1910, I liave the honour to submit a copy (i) Koweit Diary entry, dated the 14th June 1910 . of a communication received from dune iyio. eit Agency N °* C •'~ 3y, dated the 2Ut Captain Shakespear from which it will be seen that Sheikh Mubarek denies that the Koweit dhow referred to (and another) brought back cargoes of arms as reported to the Political Agent. 2. I am sending details to the Political Agent, Maskat, and Senior Naval Officer, for information and enquiry. Extract from the diary of the Political Agent t Koweit, 14th June .—A buggalow arrived late yesterday evening from Maskat, and it is said she has on board her about 3,000 rifles and ammunition. They belong to Abdulla-bin-Atiji and others and were shipped by the firm of Messrs. Goguyer of Maskat. It is just possible that the hrearms were shipped, while M. Elbaz was in Maskat and that his present visit to Koweit was timed to watch developments regarding this consignment. The buggalow on her arrival anchored opposite the Sheikh’s Customs House, but the next morning moved on to Bunder Shweikh. The firearms are said not to have been landed yet, probably due to the Sheikh’s absence. She belongs to one Shahin-bin-Ghanim, and in returning from the Malabar coast visited Maskat. Besides the firearms, she has other cargo on board. No. C.—39, dated Koweit, the 21st June 1910 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to paragraph 5 of my letterf No. C.—37, dated the 15th o „ June 1910, later reports described the t Encio. to emi o. 106 . large buggalow as bringing 1,700 rifles and not 3,000 as was first reported. 2. This is one of the large buggalows trading with the Malabar coast, and it is said that, when calling at Maskat on her homeward voyage, she picked up the 1,700 rifles and sailed for Lingah, and that she was held up by a British man-of-war, but escaped search by showing false papers. Her name is given as “ Ambar Towil ”, and her nakhuda is one Khalifa-bin-Shahin, the son of the owner. I also heard that another of these large buggalows had brought 500 rifles. 3. Both these vessels arrived during the Sheikh’s absence, which made it necessary to defer action pending his return. On his return as the Sheikh made no move, I enquired whether he knew of the arrival of these two buggalows and of the reports current about them, and to make it quite clear, I related what I had heard. The Sheikh said he had heard the rumour as regards Shahin-bin-Ghaninfls boat and immediately on the Nakhuda’s arrivalx 60 had taken steps to discover the truth. He found the rumour groundless and thought besides Shahin was not such a fool as to risk practi cally all he had in the world (the buggalow and her cargo) for a precarious profit in carrying contraband arms. Of the other buggalow he had not heard but he was sure it could not be true, for he would certainly have been informed of any attempt at smuggling. 4. I think myself that it is fairly certain that these buggalows have brought arms in spite of the Sheikh’s denial, but as proof in Koweit is almost impossible through fear of the Sheikh, I am compelled to accept his word unless indeed unmistakable evidence can be adduced of purchase or shipment at Maskat. r 5. I believe false papers are frequently carried by dhows as well as their true ones, and if the story I have heard here of the ' Ambar Towil’s ” escape from search is at all in accordance with facts, it would appear that a very strict search is required of all dhows. ■ 141 Telegram R, No. S.—401, dated the 16th July 1910.

I have the honour to report that, on the 22nd March, I took over the duties of Senior Naval Officer from Commander Bird. 2. H.M.S. “ Perseus ” left the same day for Aden. 3. After the “ Hardinge ” had embarked her troops at Sirik, I sent her to Jask to await further orders. Your telegram concerning her reached me on the 28th Marcn, and I issued her sealed Sailing Orders in accordance with your instructions. She left Jask for the rendezvous at 4 a m. on the 1st April. 4. On the 26th March, I hoarded a dhow about T5 miles from the Oman coast bound from Kishm to Sohar ; she had no cargo, hut one Afghan passenger; 2,000 rupees and 217 dollars were found in a box in her stern-sheets. I took the dhow in tow and proceeded with her to Mubarak where I anchored for the night, after having taken the Afghan, crew and money out of her. The Nakoda declared the money belonged to him but, as 1 considered this doubtful, I decided to take the money to Jask and hand it over to Captain Craufurd for investigation, letting the dhow go. I, at the same time, informed the Nakoda that, if, on enquiry it turned out that he was the owner of the money, it would be returned to him in a fortnight or three weeks time, on his calling for it at Jask. Eventually it was found that on this occasion he was trading honestly and that the money really did belong to him, so it was returned accordingly. 5. The Afghan prisoner was sent by slow mail to Karachi under police escort. 6. Met and communicated with “ Redbreast ” on the 29th March, sent her north to be under the immediate orders of “ Sphinx.” 7. The case of Mir Bar^at Khan has given a lot of trouble. Whilst at Jask, His Excellency the Darya Begi agreed with Senior Naval Officer and Major Austin as to his proved complicity in the Arms Traffic and promised to deport him. Later His Excellency explained that, being doubtful of the retention of his office after 31st March, and as to whether summary deportation would meet with approval of the Persian Government, he considered it advis able to keep Barkat with him at Bunder Abbas until be should receive information from Tehran. This change in ideas on the part of His Excellency is evidently due to the assistance rendered by Barkat’s tutangchis to him on the occasion of the late raid at Bunder Abbas. Barkat eventually left for Bushire on the 28th March. 8. On 7th April, I received information through Jask that it was reported by the Rodi patrol that a consignment of arms had been landed at Passa Bunder west of Gwatar on Tuesday, the 5th instant, but the quantitywas unknown, as the natives would not allow the patrol to approach; also that the arras were still there on the 7th and were guarded by three Afghans. I immediately signalled to “ Proserpine'’ to proceed at once to Oharbar, embark 50 men and goon to Passa Bundar and seize the cargo. At the same time 1 signalled to the Officer Commanding Troops, Jask, to obtain his sanction to these arrangements and for him to give the necessary orders to Charbar. I also ordered “ Proserpine ” to supplement landing party as considered necessary. 9. At arrival at Passa Bundar the landing was effected and a thorough searcli of all huts and the surrounding district made, but with no result, the natives one and all denying that there had ever been any arms there. There was nothing to be done under these circumstances but to embark the party and return with them to Cuarbar, which was accordingly done. The followino* day the “ Proserpine ’* returned to Gwatar and thoroughly searched the place and the surrounding country with a party of her own men, but could find no trace of arms, nor yet of camel tracks on any of the roads leading inland. 10 A line Inspector was then sent from Jask and Major Raven and Mr McMeekin from Cliarhar also went to see what information they could get; Captain Craufurd also having bis own intelligence people at work. The result of all these investigations, although in s )me cases contradictory, generally go to prove that 61 rifies were landed and loaded on to 8 donkeys at once and taken inland to Bint. It appears that the patrol gave correct information in the first place, but was afterwards intimidated by Jilal Khan and went back on his word, though he eventually told the truth again when carefully questioned. 11. There are various stories current as to the intention of the Afghans both on the Mekran and the Biyaban coasts, one being that they had made up their minds only to wait until a certain dare, and to leave with or without their consignment of arms. Cargoes still seem to be leaving Maskat for Sohar, but apparently are not getting much further, although every now and again information arrives that arms will be landed at certain places on the coast. However there has been no actual attempt so far that has been heard of except the one already quoted at Charbar and another which is reported on lower down. 12. On the 1th April 200 Bashkardis attacked 650 Afghans somewhere near Sarzeh, but the Afghans had information by letter from Barkat Khan’s father-in-law as to the time and place of the contemplated attack, and were ready when the Bashkirdis arrived. The latter were repulsed at once and pursued some 4 or 5 miles losing 36 men in all, 2 of whom were taken prisoners, shot and then burnt, which action from all reports seems to have lost them many friends in this part of the country. Since the fight I understand that 2 or 3 Afghans have been murdered, and it is quite possible that eventually they may have to fight their way out of the country. 13. On the 24th April the “ Philomel ”, when cruising off Ras-al-kuh, captured 2 dhows, the contents of which were 1997 ritles, 158 mauser pistols and 907,000 rounds of ammunition. A separate report has been sent in on this subject. The^ arms and ammunition were consigned to Jan Muhammad Nurakai and Nadir Shore Afridi. 1 hose cargoes have since been jettisoned in accordance with orders received by telegraph from you. 11 . In obedience to orders contained in your telegram No. 78, I pro ceeded to Ma^kat on the 5th M iy to confer with Major Trevor as to the suit ability of the merchant Nassib Bin Muhammad to hold the contract for fresh provisions in the southern portion of the Gulf. Major Trevor is of the same opinion as myself and thinks that Captain Craufurd takes a very highly coloured view both of this man’s desire to do harm and interfere with our arrangements for the suppression of the Arms Traffic and also of his oppor tunities of so doing. 15. At the present time Nassib has large financial interests at stake, and ihould suspicion fall on him at any time, he would stand to lose a very good sncome and one far greater than he could expect to make by participation in/|6 23 the arms trade m its present state. We are of opinion that he is far too j^ood a business man to take any chance of this sort. A.s to Captain Cranford’s com plaint that Nassib will now have agents on the Mekran coast who will carrv all sorts of undesirable information from one coast to another, I would be&lt;&gt; to p &gt;mt out thru he has had agents across the water ever since he has hekTthe Maskit provision agreement.

On the 5th May I arrived at Maskat to coal and received your telesrraui mtorramg me that sailing orders would arrive by mail on the 9th instant and that, it convenient, I should meet the mail steamer. Under these circum stances, as nothing of importance was taking place and the time available after coaling was barely sufficient for me to get over to the Biyaban coast and return, I decided to wait at Maskat until the 9th instant. 17. On the 7th May the sad news of the death of His Majesty Kin^ Edward VII was received through Jask. The “Philomel” and Consulate immediately half masted colours and His Highness the Sultan followed suit at his palace and on board his yacht. 18. The Mail arrived at 8 a.m. on Monday the 9th May, bringing my sailing orders. I waited in harbour until I had fired the Royal Salute in honour of tne proclamation of His Majesty King George V and I then proceeded to pick up my boats and visit Jask for the purpose of conferring with Captain Oraufurd on the subject of the provision agreement and the suitability of Nassib Bin Muhammad to hold it. Captain Craufurd now agrees that no harm is likely to come through any action taken by Nassib, but at the same time desires rne to p &gt;int oM to you that if at any time he is proved to have circulated inform at.on to our detriment his agreement should be terminated at once. 19. The Collier “Tangistan” arrived at Jask at noon on the 10th instant. I sent her to unload 2,000 tons at Maskat with orders to then return to Jask by which time ships will be again empty and ready to coal from her. Tue “ Sheikh”, “ Panther” and “ Tamil” also arrived at Jask on the 10th, the latter with her feed pump broken down. 20. All fishermen met with off Bunji Mabarak and the neighbourhood have informed my boats that 100 Afghans under Jan Muhammad had sacked and burnt half the village. Some stories say some of the natives were killed and others that they were most severely beaten. The whole stretch of coast in that district is now quite deserted, all the natives having left for places where their property is more secure. 21. Captain Craufurd informs me that he has Information that a party of Afghans are coming from Sarzhai down to Hillari Gut, a precipitous mountain with a good water-supply, about 12 miles north of Gangan and that their intention is to hold the place and raid the surrounding country, they have with them Dadulla and Abdulla Dervish two of Barkat’s most active advisers. 22. I turned over the Senior Naval Oficer’s Box on the 11th May to Commander H. J. T. Marshall, H.M.S. “ Proserpine” giving him all necessary information in writing. A copy ef this document I have also kept to turn over to Captain Hunt at Bombay.

Your Foreign Secret telegram of 14th instant. Arms traffic® 1 accept your views as to passes and communication to Sultan. Please telegraph estimated cost of proposed wireless installations before taking any action. As to France, French Consul’s action in facilitating purchase of dhow for ‘irms traffic will now be made ground of strong representation to French Government, who will be urged to assist His Majesty's Government by permitting Sultan to prohibit import for one year, and our ships to search French dhows during that period, just as we are assisting French in preventing arms traffic with Morocco. This should not cause any abatement of rigour of blockade, but it must be borne in mind that we have no right even to touch French dhows except in British waters, and, with reference to Admiral’s telegram to Government of India, No. 35, dated 20th February, enclosed in your Foreign Secretary’s letter of 24th February, he should be reminded that orders of 1867 only permit stopping of dhow flying French flao* where there is presumption that she is wrongfully flying it. If you think it practicable you may take action proposed in paragraph 2 of India Office letter to Foreign Office, dated 24th February, enclosed in my Political Secretary’s letter dated 25th February.9 No. 80 — 1462 - XIV N., dated Diyatalawa, the 13 th May 1910 . From—His Excellency Rear- Admiral, E. J. W, Slade, Naval Commander-in- Chief, East Indies Squadron, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. With reference to my telegram No. 56 of 25th April 1910, I have the honour to forward, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council, the attached report received from the Commanding Officer of H. M. S. “ Philomel ” of the capture of two arms running dhows in the Persian Gulf on 24»th April 1910. 2. As communicated by my telegram No. 62 of 11th May 1910, the arms and ammunition found in these dhows have been sunk, in accordance with Marine Department telegram No. 780 M. of 8rd idem. i h4 towards the land. I at once chased, and on seeing me alter course the dhow went about and stood out to sea. 2 . About 10 minutes later, I sighted a second dhow, which behaved in the same manner, as the first, on my heaving in sight. I went on full sneed with the boilers then alight, and fired half a dozen rounds of S-pr before th*iJ lowered their sails. J 3. On boarding the first dhow, it was at once plain, that she was full of arms. I got her alongside the lee side, and then proceeded towards the second which was about a mile off, boarded her, and found her cargo was also arms and ammunition. In neither case was there any attempt at concealment of the contents of the hold. B 4. I attribute the fact of these dhows being so close to the land with three hours of daylight still to run owing to the land being obscured by a heaw cloud of sand, and that consequently, they were not aware of their oW proximity to it. 5. Both dhows were cleared by 9 p.m., taken in tow, and towed towards Jask ; a strong Shamal had risen in the meantime, and I thought, durine the night, that I should have to take the Seedie crews out, and abandon the dhows- more especially as one had lost her rudder, but the wind abated towards the morning, and I eventually got them anchored safely in Jask West Bay at ^ A ;^'. &gt;K i n0th ?’ a ^ d - Ve ^I n T, hStr0n ?, erShamal ’ s P ran S u P in lhe afternoon of the 26th, and continued to blow until 4 a.m. the followine mornin» At some time, during the night, the larger of the two dhows broke adrift, and went on shore, and when daylight came, she was found to be a total wreck It was reported to me, by Lieutenant Ward, R.I.M., who was on board both these craft, when they were being taken in tow, that the larger of the two was in a very rotten condition, and he had great difficulty if finding any place good enough to secure the towing hawser to. I think that the probable reason nf the accident, was that the beam, to which the cable was secured, carrying aw'av owing to the extra heavy strain put upon it, due to wind and sea. ' 3 ’ ’ 6. There was one Afghan passenger in the first dhow, and none in the second. The crews of both, and the dhows, were handed over to Colonel Whvte *h JaS h , for ,‘hem are attached. The Afghan prisoner was dis charged to “ Proserpine” for passage to Maakat and Karachi. 7. Attached is a detailed list of contents. It is submitted, that I mav be allowed to jettison the cargo, before my arrival at Bombav, as it. is imm/- Mble, in a ship of this size to place such a large amount of stuff under lock and 8.

No. 1297 , dated Bushire, the 22 nd (received 30 th) May 1910 From-L.EUTENANT-COLONEL P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E , Political Resident in the rersian Gulf, To— The Hon'ble Mr. S. H. Butler, C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Govern- ment of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. With reference to my telegram Nos. 488 and 515 dated nth and 18th May respectwely, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, copies of the telegraphic communications between the rohtical Agent, Kuwait, and myself, resulting in the confiscation or attachment ?&lt;v ^ arg ° l - arms . an d ammunition landed in Kuwait from the Sambooq ‘ Fateh-al-Khair,” flying the French Flag and purporting to be owned by Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co. r r ^ / I also enclose copies of Captain Shakespear’s letters written during the pro gress of his negotiations with the Shaikh in which he records at length the details of his conversations with the Shaikh and of the procedure followed. It may be convenient for the Government of India to have these for reference in case the incident should give rise to controversy. 2. It will be remembered that in Foreign Department telegram No. 8.-199, dated 27th March, I was given discretion to make certain communications to the Shaikhs of Kuwait, Bahrein, Muhammerah and the Trucial Coast Ports. In this connection I would explain that in the case of Muhammerah, where the Customs are administered by the Belgian regime and where the Director would in the ordinary course be only too glad to confiscate for the Persian Government any contraband consignment of which he got information, a communication in the sense indicated seemed hardly needed. In the cases of the other Shaikhs mentioned, specially the Trucial Chiefs, the questions of temporary custody anld eventual delivery or payment of compensation were somewhat difficult matters to handle and needed different and cautious treatment in each case; I was therefore anxious to deal with them on the spot in personal communication with the Shaikhs and British representatives concerned on my pre-hotweather visit to the Arab Coast Ports. The outbreak of Plague in Bushire, however, with its consequent quarantine difficulties and the difficult situation in the Shatt-el- Arab had delayed me from week to week and no communication had been made to Shaikh Mubarak when the arrival of this consignment at Kuwait was reported. 3. It will be seen that Captain Shakespear had a very difficult task to get the Shaikh to act up to his obligations, and that the latter has since done his best to make it appear that we are entirely responsible for the seizure. I find it difficult to believe that Shaikh Mubarak’s demeanour in this respect was really attributable to any doubt as to whether he would have our support, and think the truth more probably is that he is compromised, by correspondence or other wise, with Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co., and realises that the only basis on which he can justify the seizure to them is the excuse that the British authorities insisted on it and that he had no choice but to comply. His desire, on further considera- , tion, to get the arms back into his own custody is not I think far to seek. On the one hand if he finds himself at issue with the French and we, having regard to his soiled hands, find it difficult to support the seizure, he will so be enabled to restore the arms when his position becomes too awkward. On the other hand, if his action proves indefeasible, he will be sure of getting the arms or their value for himself, possession being nine points of the law. 4. As to the legal aspect of the seizure, we must perhaps be prepared for the contingency of Messrs. Goguyer Sc Company being able to show that in sendingthe consignment to Kuwait they had been given by Shaikh Mubarak reason to believe that he had no objection to the importation and that consequently the seizure must have been due solely to pressure from us and not to the Shaikh’s own motion, as we would have them believe. But our position in the matter vis-^-vis the French Government seems so strong, specially in view of the recent French refusal to give us the right of search over dhows under their Flag, that there does not appear to me to be any strong reason why we should not frankly accept the onus of having insisted on the seizure by the Shaikh. At all events I submit that the advantage from an Arms Traffic point of view of seizing this trial consignment, a fact which Captain Shakespear writes “ has caused the greatest consternation in Kuwait,' greatly outweighs the seriousness of the possible complication which may arise from the Shaikh being proved to have been in collusion with Goguyer &amp; Co. In the latter case, while we shall have effected what was necessary in the execution of our measures for the suppression of the Arms Traffic, we shall at the same time have cleared the atmosphere between ourselves and the Shaikh and have so unmasked him that he will no longer be able to persevere with the obvious insincerities and mental reservations which distinguish his communica tions to us in connection with the Arms Traffic. Trusting that the views of the Government of India will not be greatly divergent from the above. (Confidential) No. C.-19, dated Kuwait, the 28th April 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. C.-q, dated the 2nd March 1910, I have the honour to report what, as far as I am at present aware, is an entirely new development in the Arms Traffic. 2. To take matters in their proper sequence 1 would recall the seizure of a Kuwait boom' with arms on board by H. M. S. “Hyacinth' about the 27th January 1910 near Muttra. It will be remembered that this “ boom ” was allowed to proceed after inspection but was taken back to Maskat with her cargo by her Kuwaiti Nakhuda, Muhammad Saleh, Of the course of the case^ in Maskat I have no knowledge, but it appears that the Nakhuda, without the knowledge of the “ boom’s ' owners, entered into some illegal contract for her sale to the French firm of Goguyer et Cie. Shaikh Mubarak becoming aware of this so-called sale, and claiming jurisdiction over the “ boom ' as carrying Kuwait colours and papers, and over both her owners and Nakhuda as being Kuwait subjects, addressed His Highness the Sultan of Maskat requesting extradition of Muhammad Saleh for trial in Kuwait. His Highness replied to the Shaikh that the Nakhuda had already left Maskat. It is worthy of note that Muhammad Saleh also disregarded the Shaikh’s orders— viz.) those in which he informed his agents in Maskat sometime in January that no “ booms ' were to leave Maskat with arms except with the written permission of Jhe British Political Agent. This precaution was taken by the Shaikh, I imagine, to safeguard his subjects’ property from confiscation by British men-of-war. Such are the preceding facts and the Shaikh rested, awaiting an opportunity to bring the offending Muhammad Saleh to trial. 3. Yesterday I was informed by the Shaikh that a Maskat “ sambuk ” had arrived with a cargo of arms with the offending Nakhuda Muhammad Saleh on board, and that he would be glad of my views before dealing with the case as the vessel was a different one belonging to Maskat. I went to see the Shaikh at once, and advised him, that so far as Muhammad Saleh was concerned, I saw no legal difficulty in his having him apprehended at once for the same offence and on the same grounds, on which he had already asked the Sultan of Maskat for his extradition. As for the “ sambuk ” and her cargo, in virtue of his own noti fication of May 1900, and his recent orders to his agents in Maskat, confiscationof the arms by him would appear to be legal, but seeing that the “ sambuk ” belonged to Maskat, and the arms also probably to Maskat or French subjects, it would be politic to hold them in suspense pending a reference to you. 4. At this time 1 was not made aware of the full details of the case, nor do I think that the Shaikh himself knew any more, but later in the evening it appears the Shaikh summoned the boat’s Nakhuda, and then sent his Secretary to me with her papers, from which it appears that the “sambuk” is French subjects’ pro perty—that of Goguyer et Cie—carries French ship’s papers, all so far as I can judge in order, and sails under the French Flag. This denouement of course entirely altered the case. Time did not admit of my making copies of the papers, but they consisted of the following:— (a) A “ Titre de Navigation ” in which the sambuk is described as the “Fateh-al*khair,” built in Debai, of 119 tons, belonging “ala Maison Goguyer citoyen fran5ais residant &amp; Mascate et &amp; la Societd frangaise des munitions representde par Mr. Neauber,” commanded by Jandok bin Sendan, and entitling her to sail under the French Flag. The document assigns the vessel “ Lettre Signaletique M ”, and “ No description 1,” and is dated the 12th February 1910 over the signature and seal of the French Consul at Maskat. There are several manuscript emendations in the printed text, which seem to show, that the form is one usually used in French colonies, as well as a note specially absolving the Captain of the boat from being a French subject. (b) A Crew Agreement form with the names of 11 men, of whom 10 are described as Maskat subjects and one, the last, the offending Muhammad Saleh as “ Mahbub bin Saleh, sujet turc de Kuwait, 70 ans, 1 m, 10, capittaine en ler, embarque le 24 mars 1910. ” The agreement is signed by 3 persons, A. Elbaz being the only decipherable signature. In this document the vessel is also “ autorisd a naviguer sous pavilion fran9ais pour faire la naviagtion dans la mer des Indes et le Golfe Persique”; it is dated the 12th February 1910 at Maskat over the French Consul’s signa ture. She has made several voyages to Sohar in Oman, and the last endorsement reads c&lt; Expedie de Mascate le 25 mars 1910 allant a Kuwait et Basrah charge d’armes et munitions ayant 11 homes d'equipage et—passagers.” (c) A Bill of Health, certifying Maskat as a clean port of departure, issued by the French Consulate. r In view of these papers, the Shaikh again desired my advice, and I informed his Secretary, that I saw no reason to change my mind as regards the Nakhuda Muhammad Saleh, who, as a Kuwait subject charged with an offence in respect of a Kuwait “ boom ”, could not escape the Shaikh s jurisdiction in Kuwait itself simply by the fact of being one of the crew of a boat flying French colours. I suggested therefore that he should be apprehended and his case proceeded with as the Shaikh had originally intended. As regards the boat and her cargo, it was doubtful if the Shaikh’s notification of May 1900 could be held to apply 0 in its entirety, and in my opinion the best course for the Shaikh would be to abide by the spirit of his notification and late order to his Maskat agents bv informing the Captain of the boat, that he had specifically prohibited the’import 'ofarms^into Kuwait,, and the boat and her cargo bad be t te r here- fore return to Maskat, or continue her voyage to Basrah, for he would not allow her cargo to be landed in Kuwait. 6 The Shaikh’s Secretary then saida difficulty would arise, for the Nakhuda MutaSdIS 4 on,..-the northern part of the Persian Gulf. My reply was tha m that case, the Capta n (for Muhammad Saleh is not the real Captain of the boa ” Lfted to stav engage any of the ^^ther p ots -^r^i’Xrtoruing fjm theTaikh I saw no reason in this small difficulty for releasing Muhammad Saleh. After this the Shaikh’s Secretary took his leave and it remains to be seen hew the Shaikh acts in the matter.dealt vtitV^tTad laTeh'^ ^.'r he had Arlc°slned\7t\e‘consui 8 a d °~t t toMaskir Tlfe^bikh 10 Pii0t d - the , '‘T^ Ba'ratanTblck to i laskat. Ihe bhaikh accordingly allowed him to leave in the “ sambuk ” wdhk his'reach “ ^ ^ imended t0 P Unish the man wh - ^ next cf me 7. Having ascertained that the arms were still unsold with Goguver et Cie’s local agent, 1 informed the Shaikh of the receipt of your telegfam No. 44, urged upon h,m that Government expected him in this instance to Jfil his obligations gave him reasons for the course, assured him of Government's support and pointed out that if he confiscated the arms landed in contravention of his old prohibition and recent express orders (as he had himself inlimated to me) and lodged them m the Agency under my charge, he had nothing to fear from the French Consul in Maskat. I pointed out that the reason for asking him to lodge the confiscated arms m the Agency was to prevent them passing again into the hands of dealers and thereby convincing such dealers that importation ol ml ,- Ce ° V 9 10 * * * * * 16 Shaikh s prohibition would be a profitless enterprise. The bhaikh listened to my arguments quietly, now and again reiterating his desire to do nothing contrary to the wishes of the British Government Finally he said he would confiscate the arms from the local dealer, adding that he would serve him with a written notice that he was doing so as he had deliberately infringed h is orders, but that he would be glad of the presence of one of the Agency staff when the notice was to be served and during the removal of the arms to the Agency. As the Shaikh did not press me for anything in writing I agreed to assist him by sending one of my clerks. It was arranged therefore that one of my clerks should be present to-morrow morning, when in his presence the Shaikh’s notice would be served on Mullah Abdullah Atiji, and that subsequently the clerk should accompany the Shaikh’s representative and coolies, and be alsc present at the removal to the Agency of all the arms and ammunition received from the French “ sambuk” by Goguyer et Cie’s local Agent. The Shaikh also said he would inform Mullah Abdullah that he would not recognize his agency for the French firm, nor admit any more arms to be landed for him. Having expressed my thanks at the Shaikh’s evident desire to assist His Majesty’s Government in the suppression of the arms traffic, and again assured him of their full support, I took my leave, the Shaikh reiterating his intention of furthering our wishes to the best of his ability. 8. The Shaikh’s change of front is curious and difficult to explain, unless it was actuated by the not improbable idea of enhancing the value of his co-opera tion. I urged on the Shaikh the advisability of making his written notice to Mullah Abdullah Atiji (on which he seemed resolved) as brief as posisble, and of confining it merely to saying that the confiscation was being enforced as punish ment for disregard of a long-standing prohibition of which the culprit was well aware. 9. The mail will probably have left before I can report the result of the Shaikh’s proposed action, and though I endeavoured to leave no loop-hole by which he might find a way of escape from his present undertaking, I am rather sceptical of its complete execution. I will report by telegraph, however, what actually results. 10. It is improbable that the Shaikh will expose his own connivance by surrendering any of the arms he may have already taken for himself, and it will therefore be necessary to assume as correct, his figures of the boat’s cargo, but on this point I shall not be able to furnish accurate details until the consignment has been lodged in the Agency. Note of a Conversation mth Shaikh Mubarak on 1 st May igio. Received Resident’s wire n A.M. May ist, and sent over to Shaikh to say should like to see him at 4*30 P. M, (10-30 Arabic time).^6 i 6 V After usual greetings, asked Shaikh about the French “ sambuk Shaikh replied that he had done his best by ordering it out of the port and refusing permission to landing, but that the Maskat Nakhuda head threatened him with going to Fao and wiring to French Consul. Finally, against his orders, the arms in number of 321 rifles, mostly 5. shot magazine Mausers and a lot of ammunition had been landed during the night of Friday-Saturday (29th*3oth April), and were now in possession of the French firm’s agent, Mullah Muhammad Atiji. The “ sambuk ” still in harbour and Muhammad Saleh not arrested, but Shaikh intends arresting him. Informed Shaikh of receipt^ of telegram from Resident and translated first part to him He demurred saying afraid of the French, so again pointed out promise of British support and urged as a^reason that deposit of the arms in the Agency would ensure Shaikh was not subjected to difficulties with French for the matter would then pass to British Government. Shaikh still demurred and asked to be allowed to write officially to me reporting the landing of the arms against his orders and asking for my opinion, and that I should reply in an official letter requ esting him to confiscate them and send them to the Agency. I made no com ments, but said that letter seemed hardly necessary in view of very plain terms in Resident’s telegram of Government’s assistance. Said he would prefer the letter so as to have something to show any Frenchman who made things unpleasant for him. Talk then drifted to Muhammad Saleh, and Shaikh said he proposed sum moning some of his old men to pronounce on his nationality and if they said Kuwaitihe would imprison him. After various other subjects I left. Most unsatis factory, as convinced Sheikh did not tell me correct number of rifles, and landing was impossible unless covertly connived at by Sheikh. Do not believe he pro poses anything for Muhammad Saleh. Just at leaving, Sheikh brought up old plea that “ sambuk ” could not leave without pilot, and as his proclamation does not include confiscation or detention of the empty boat, especially when he has not confiscated the arms, I reiterated my previous suggestion that boat could engage any of the dozens of other Kuwait pilots. 1 st May 1910 . W. H. I. SHAKESPftAR. (Confidential) No. C.-23, dated Kuwait, the icth May 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to submit the following report in continuation of my letter No C.- 22 , dated the 4 th May 1910 , and in explanation of the two telegrams subsequently sent to you, regarding Shaikh Mubarak’s action in the matter of the arms and ammunition landed from the French sambuk “ Fateh-el-Khair.” 2 . My scepticism as to the Shaikh’s good intentions was not unjustified, for when my clerk presented himself at the Shaikh’s palace as arranged on the morning following the conversation already reported, the Shaikh informed him that he would not confiscate the arms without “ an order from the Sahib,” I had taken the precaution of furnishing my clerk with written instructions, and on his explanation of these, the Shaikh apparently began to equivocate and distort the arrangements upon which he had agreed with me the day before ; finally he sent Abdullah bin Muhammad Atiji to receive his orders direct from me. I returned a message that I had no “ orders ” for anyone except my own clerk, and that the latter had been sent to the Shaikh in accordance with his request of the previous day. The Shaikh then definitelv refused to carry out the con fiscation and sent my clerk back to inform me of his decision. On this I went immediately to see the Shaikh. The Shaikh at once began to explain that I must have misunderstood his intentions the day before, that it was impossible for him to issue orders for confiscation, etc., etc. I heard the Shaikh out, and then took him over the whole of the ground again carefully, finally translating to him parts of my letter C .-22 in which I had already reported our conversation to you. In reply to frequent queries whether my report did not truly represent what had actually passed, the Shaikh invariably replied in the affirmative; I then pointed out that, that being the case, I was at a loss to explain his change7 of atlitudB to Government, for after all, Government only required his assistance un er his old prohibition, while, as I had more than once assured him, they were STL d ( t gl p e hlm u a,1 I su PP° rt , possible in the event of his action being ques- tioned by the French. I pointed out that, as I had already informed Govirnment ° a re fj nes ^ ^ ass ist, they could not but be surprised at his change of front and would probably draw unfavourable inferences in spite of his frequent profes sions of friendship It was impossible for me to confiscate the arms for he was Kuier of Kuwait; the prohibition stood in his name, and confiscation in his own territory must therefore proceed from him. After various other attempts at subterfuge, the Shaikh finally agreed to, substantially, the same procedure as on the previous day, omitting the written notice to Abdullah Atiji. He said he would like to inform him, however, before me, and therefore had him summoned, when after some unimportant preliminary remarks, the Shaikh said to him “ You are my subject and my order is upon you, the Sahib’s man and my man will go together to your house and take the arms landed against my orders from the French ‘ Sambuk and together convey them to the Sahib’s house, and it is my order I record these words verbatim as subsequently the Sha kh endea voured to assert that the “ order ” was from the British Government. \ tried to have the confiscation carried out there and then, but at the Shaikh’s request agreed to the following day, and, to give a receipt for the arms and ammunition as soon as received in the Agency. 3. On the following day, the 6th May, my clerk attended at the Shaikh’s palace with the same orders as before. He informs me that the Shaikh reiter ated all his previous equivocation, and finally sent his man to me with Abdullah Atiji to ask whether I was agreeable to granting time in order that the arms might be sent back to Maskat. As I had already repeatedly explained to the Shaikh our object in the confiscation, I contented myself with remarking that, seeing the arms had already been in Kuwait some 10 or 11 days, I was not agree able to any further delay. The confiscation was then carried out as arranged and the arms brought to the Agency. They consisted of 301 Gras carbines, modele 1874, and 30,100 rounds of ammunition for them. I made out a receipt as received from the Shaikh’s man who actually brought them. The Sheikh refused to accept my receipt and sent his man to explain that my receipt must be personally from me to Abdullah Atiji, all mention of the Shaikh’s name to be omitted. 4. On hearing the above I went to see the Shaikh again and listened for an hour to another most ingenious and bare-faced attempt by the Shaikh to recon struct our previous conversations and agreements. I was obliged to check further perversion of the truth by pointing out again, that my records could not possibly bear the interpretations the Shaikh now desired to put on his and my words, and seeing that he had himself admitted in my previous interview that my record was accurate, I was at a loss to understand his object at this late date in evading the obvious meaning of our words. Finally the Shaikh said' he was afraid of the French Government, that he was not a Great Power, and would like in writing from me that the British Government would support him. I said I was perfectly willing to accede to this request, but that a receipt direct from me to Abdullah Atiji was impossible, and that if he was satisfied, the arms would be forthcoming from my charge but objected to a receipt to his own name for them ; we could dispense with receipts. The Shaikh said this would suit him better if he had the letter assuring him of British support. Accordingly I destroyed the previous receipt and drafted a letter at once. 5. For the next two days the Shaikh did everything he could to produce the impression that the Political Agent had seized the arms and refused to grant a receipt, and finally sent me a message that, if I did not grant a receipt to Abdullah Atiji as he desired, he would be compelled to furnish him with an “istihad” (paper of witness) as to what he had heard and what had actually passed. I replied that such a receipt was impossible and that I was willing to explain the reasons once more. Accordingly 1 again visited the Shaikh on the 8th May and listened to another long declamation of what were supposed really to have been. i.-V ■MM Ns. 8 our arrangements, and how the Shaikh was disappointed in my refusal to omit his name from any part in the affair. The Shaikh went so far in what was obviously a prepared attempt to repudiate our conversations, that I felt it was necessary to speak in rather plainer terms of his action than I had hitherto used, and took him categorically through the whole of our conversations until he admitted that he had agreed originally to confiscate the arms himself, lodge them in the Agency; that the suggestion for the presence of one of the Agency Staff had come from him and that, though I had considered it unnecessary, I had acceded to his request. He was so insistent that I should grant a receipt to Abdullah Atiji direct, that I said, as the Shaikh did not appear to accept my reasons for not doing so, I was willing to refer the point to you, but I should be compelled to lay before you also how, from his original prompt readiness to assist Government, the Shaikh had gravitated to endeavouring, by various tortuous and questionable methods to evade his part in the matter, make difficulties where none existed, and \ all this in spite of an explicit assurance of support and assistance. The Shaikh then shifted his ground and asked if Government’s wishes would be met by his holding the arms in his own custody. I said, as I had intimated at one of our first conversations, that they would under certain conditions viz that the arms must not remain with a dealer, they must be kept in some special safe place, kept intact and not allowed to be moved without the consent of the British Government, and that I should be permitted access to them in case of inspection being necessary. The Shaikh agreed to the conditions and said he would store them in his customs-house. The Shaikh’s reversion to this arrangement is curious for as long ago as the 1st May I suggested this course, and he then refused it, saying he preferred the arms should be in the Agency. To prevent any further possible doubts, I repeated the conditions to the Shaikh and informed him that I would send the arms over on receipt of his written undertaking. 6. The following morning the undertaking was handed to me and the arms and ammunition were removed to the Shaikh’s customs-house. The Shaikh de murred at giving me a receipt for them, and as I had already recorded the marks, numbers, etc., of the consignment, I did not press the point. Later I was in formed that the arms had been lodged in a separate room in the customs and the room sealed with the Shaikh’s seal. 7. Copies and translations of the documents which passed between the Shaikh and myself are attached hereto. The course of the case has not been quite as satisfactory as I desired, but the Shaikh’s peculiar methods make straight-forward dealing difficult ; 1 trust however, that the result will be con sonant with the wishes of Government ; I have succeeded in maintaining that the confiscation was carried out by the Shaikh in virtue of his prohibition, the arms are now under his custody in one of his public buildings, and w r e hold his written undertaking that they shall not be removed without the consent of the British Government. 8. My report has run to an inordinate length, but in the circumstances of the case it appeared advisable to have the facts on record in some detail, for my personal opinion is that some stronger form of persuasion will be required, if Government desire the Shaikh to confiscate any further consignments. Instructions for Head-clerk* Head-clerk— With reference to what I told you verbally, here are your instructions:— 1. The Shaikh is going to confiscate the arms, ammunition, etc., landed from the French “ Sambuk” last Friday against his orders and prohibition. The consignment is with Abdullah Atiji. 2. The Shaikh desires an Agency representative present when he has Abdullah Atiji served with a written notice to above effect. i 2 * The Shaikh desires an Agency representative to accompany his men when the arms are formally confiscated and brought from Abdullah Atiji’s premises for safe lodgment in the Agency. 4. You will be the Agency representative, simply to watch proceedings and take charge of the arms, ammunition, etc., when being taken to the Agency.5*. H desired you should note numbers, marks, etc., of cases or weapons, but in conjunction with the Shaikh’s men. Any receipt required will be given by me when the arms arrive at the Agency. 6. Attend at the Shaikh’s palace at 2 hours after sunrise (little earlier will be better). W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, May iqio. Translation of letter No. 211 , dated the 6th May iqio, from Captain W. H. I.

And this is what was necessary, and may you be preserved.

From—Captain Shakespear, Fao, To—The Resident in Bushire. “ Sambuk ” with arms from Maskat with regular French papers and flag arrived Wednesday and errant Nakhuda Muhammad Saleh aboard. Shaikh asked my advice, so suggested he should apprehend Muhammad Saleh on grounds which he already asked his extradition from Maskat vide previous demi-official to Trevor. Suggested boat be informed Shaikh already prohibited import arms by notification May 1900 and recent letters to Maskat and therefore better return Maskat with cargo or proceed Basrah as intimated in her papers. Shaikh anxious for advice not to compromise himself so trust you can send general instructions by mail 4th May. Full written report reaches you fast mail Monday, Telegram, dated 29th April 1910. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Captain Shakespear, Fao, Political Agent, Kuwait. Your telegram of 28th April from Fao. If the arms were wrongfully Sanded in Kuwait territory in contravention of the Shaikh’s prohibition, you areauthorised to urge Shaikh Mubarak to seize them and deliver them for the time being to your custody. Under such circumstances, His Majesty s Government undertake to support the Shaikh in the event of any unpleasantness with the French and will be prepared to consider the expediency of paying the Shaikh compensation for their value, or of handing the arms over to him, after a time when there is no risk of their passing back into the hands of dealers^ Should Shaikh object to hand them to you as Government suggest, you might make some effective arrangement with him, under which he will deposit them in some special place to which he will allow you friendly access, and will give you written undertaking not to let them go out of such custody, except in agreement with you, the object being to prevent their getting back to dealers. Supposing the arms were not landed, I advise action as follows : Presumably the arms were not manifested. Should the Nakhuda allege that the consignment was for Turkish territory, Shaikh would explain that he believed import of arms into Turkey was ordinarily prohibited, and that the circumstances of this case were sufficiently suspicious to oblige him to detain the dhow and arms, pending production by the Nakhuda of a permit from the Wali of Basrah to import them. Should arms not have been fraudulently landed and should Nakhuda admit or should there be evidence to prove that the consignment was for some Persian or Arab port, covered by existing prohibitions, arms and dhow should be detained pending further telegraphic reference to me as to disposal. Shaikh should take any action he sees fit in regard to the treatment of Nakhuda Muhammad Saleh. In any case report action finally taken by wire. Telegram, dated 23 rd May 1910 .

Interviewed Shaikh Sunday, and found arms been landed during Friday—Saturday night, and delivery taken by Goguyer’s local Agent, a Kuwaiti. Shaikh avers this done contravention of his express orders, but from independent source hear that accepted 120 rifles for himself and only usual duty levied. Landing against Shaikh’s orders if real, would be impossible. Urged Shaikh therefore in sense first part only of your tele gram, but he pretends much anxiety from Maskat Nakhuda’s threats of reporting to French Consul. Said he would write officially to me and like official reply requesting him to confiscate arms and lodge them in the Agency. No letter yet received 3 P.M. Monday and do not think Shaikh intends running straight. Presume your telegram does not authorise official letter of description suggested, but if Shaikh addresses me, 1 could frame answer saying in view of Shaikh’s manifest intention to assist Government, and his old proclamation, am willing to receive arms in Agency for safe custody, and assure Shaikh of British Government’s support in laudable endeavour to suppress traffic. If you approve please wire as man will await answer at Fao. Consignment was 400 rifles and unknown amount ammunition evidently trial trip. Shaikh said he would apprehend Muhammad Saleh but consider even this doubtful. Telegram No. 441 , dated the 3 rd May 1910 . From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z.

This consignment having according to the Shaikh’s personal intimation to you, been illicitly imported in contravention of his prohibition, and m defiance of his orders, it is clearly most important to himself and to us in the interests of the suppression of the traffic, that he should vigorously enforce his prohibition by such action as will deter others. Sound Shaikh first as j 0 whether on the strength of a letter to you on the terms you suggest, he is ready to confiscate the arms and let you have temporary custody of them. If so, well and good. If not, then in order to ensure confiscation and custody, there is no11 objection to your informing him in writing, that you are authorised to assure him, { that His^ Majesty's Government will support him in the event of any unpleasant- 1 ness arising with the French, as the result of his enforcing his prohibition in this and other such cases. Make sure that he understands the reason for our want- ■ * n g temporary custody of the arms and inform him also, in writing, if necessary, that we will^ hand them back to him later on, or give him reasonable compensa tion for them if destroyed. As Shaikh has already informed you that arms were illicitly imported, it seems late in the day for him to write you an official letter to that effect, but if he still wants to do so, please see that it is suitably worded.

W1 [ H reference to this office letter of the 10th instant and your reply of the 16th instant I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copies of further teleorams ;T otT l/r t ie } lcer °y» dated the 17th and 22nd February,* from which it appears that t r + T Ml ^ Cat ° f the firm of Go S u y er is purchasing dhows, and, with the consent ot tiie Ireneh consul, dispatching arms and ammunition under the French flas;. So far as Viscount Morley is aware, His Majesty’s ships cannot touch'French dhows carrying the French flag, but the import of arms having been prohibited by all countries bordering on the gulf except Katr, the rulers of those countries can presumably confiscate any such arms as may be landed in that territory. With a view, therefore, to minimising the evil, Lord Morley would propose, if the Government 0 India think it practicable, that the sheikhs of Loweit, Bahrein, and Mohammerah L an( ^ ^ ie ^racial chiefs should be urged to seize any such consignments and hand them over to the British authorities. His Majesty’s Government undertaking to support the sheikhs and chiefs in case of any unpleasantness with the French, and, if necessary to give compensation for the arms, or to restore them ultimately to the local rulers! when assured that there is no risk of their merely passing into the hands of the dealers. With regard to the last paragraph of the Viceroy’s telegram of the 22nd instant, 1 am to enclose copy of Lord Morley’s telegram of the 20th instant referred to therein, f and to remark that the Viceroy’s expression li our issuing passes” is not quite correct. The official who would be responsible for the issue of passes would be an official of the Sultan of Muscat, though doubtless a British subject, and the French would therefore have no locus standi for objecting. In conclusion, I am to invite attention to the letter from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty of the 21st instant, of which it is understood that a copy has been furnished to your department. As regards the agreement with the Persian Govern ment of 1897, Lord Morley is of opinion that the Sadr-i-Azam’s letter of the 18th December, 1897, read in the light of Mr. C. Hardinge’s letter of 11th December, 1897, does not authorise the search by British ships in Persian waters of any dhows irrespective of their character and nationality. But he would be glad to be favoured with Sir E. Grey’s views on this point,! and on the others raised by the admiral.§ I am, &amp;c. B, BITCHIE. Enclosure in No. 1.

Holland informs us by telegraph that the representative of Goguyer has bought a dhow and sent her under the French flag to Katr laden with arms and ammunition, and that the report of the purchase has been confirmed by the French consul in reply to a request for the exchange of a list of dhows. Holland had previously been informed by the Sultan that the transaction was not carried out with his assistance or approval. Afterwards his Highness paid a long visit to the French consul, who told Holland that he bad been informed by the Sultan that he bad no recollection of the proclamation of 1898 empowering us to search ships.

It will he remembered that the export of arms and ammunition to the coast of the Persian Gulf outside the territorial waters of Muscat is illegal except as regards Katr, where we have not recognised the claims of Turkey. The action, therefore, of|f the firm of Goguyer is openly disreputable. It is evident that their position is becoming desperate. Having regard to the development of the situation since my last telegram was dispatched, I am asking Trevor and Holland for their opinions on the proposal con tained in your message of the 20th instant before taking action upon it. On receipt of their views I will communicate with you without delay. It is probable that the French w^ould object to the issue by us of passes to French dhows.

Sir:- I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential despatch No.6 Africa of the 22nd instant inclos ing correspondence respecting the measures which are being taken to suppress the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf and requesting my views as to the question, which the government of India has raised, of approaching the Porte with a view to obtaining authority for His Majesty’s Ships to search dhows flying the Turkish Flag. 1 fear that it is out of the question to hope for any useful result from such a step. A request of the kind would certainly be met with a polite refusal, probably coupled with a promise that the Porte itself would send vessels to assist His Majesty’s naval forces in the suppression of the trade. Supposing that some effort were made to carry out this promise, which is more than problematical, it is most Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;»C •, &amp;,C • , &amp;C • unlikelyX V % unlikely that anything effectual would be done, while there would be the serious risk that the officers conan&amp;nding the iurkish vessels would be apt to extend their activities to vessels belonging to subjects of native chiefs under our protection, and so raising a number of thorny questions. I have &amp;c., (Signed) G-erard Lowther.f 1910. With reference to this Office letter of the 10th inet ., and your reply (No.4905) of the 16th Inst., I cm directed by the 5. of S.for India to forward, for the information of the 8. of 8. for Foreign Affairs, copies of further telegrams from the viceroy from which it appears that the Unseat Agent of the firm of Coguyer is purchasing dhows and, with the consent of the French Consul, despatching arms and anwmition under the French flag. 'Co far as viscount For ley is aware H.F. ships cannot touch French dhows carrying the French flag; but the import of arms having been prohibited by all countries bordering on the Culf except Katr, the rulers of those countries can presumably confiscate any such arms as may be landed in their territory. With a view therefore to minimising the evil. Lord llorley would propose, if the Govt, of Indi thirih it practicable, that the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrain and Mohammra and the Trucial Ghtejs, should be urged to seise any such consignments and hand them over to the British authorities, H.!:.

Copy of the letter is contained in the Government of India print, No. 198. 2. Amongst other points the commander-in-chief notices the possibility of arms being carried in dhows under foreign flags, and requests definite information whether the terms of the agreement with the Persian Government, dated 18th December, 1897, authorise him to seize vessels in Persian or British waters which are attempting to land arms, whatever their character or nationality. The agreement states that— 44 in addition to such measures as may be taken by Persian officials, His Majesty’s ships should examine and search all merchant vessels trading in the Persian Gulf.” It appears therefore that His Majesty’s ships could search any vessel suspected of carrying arms within the territorial waters of Persia, irresj)ective of its character or nationality. On the other hand, the Secretary of State for India, in his despatch of the 9th November, 1900, to the Government of India, stated that it would be necessary to come to an arrangement with the Turkish Government before British vessels could search ships carrying the Turkish flag. 3. A similar question arises in respect of seizures of vessels under a foreign flag in Muscat waters. The terms of the Proclamation of the Sultan of Muscat of the 13th January, 1898, are not so general as those of the agreement with Persia, and it was held that the right of search does not extend to other than British, Persian, or Muscat vessels. 4. My Lords note that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in his letter of the 22nd October last, stated that the possibility of the blockade being rendered less effective by arms being carried in dhows under foreign flags must be dealt with if and when it arises. In the present situation, however, it is necessary that the commander-in-chief should be definitely informed what are his powers in respect of such vessels, i.e., whether vessels under foreign flags suspected of carrying arms in British, Persian, or Muscat waters may be visited and searched, and, if necessary, detained for enquiry, their cargoes being confiscated. I am to request that the [2628 y—4] ?iW1 Mmtm' ,mr,H,m ', 1 Secretary of State will state what instructions should be given to the commander-in- chief on this point. 5. I am to refer in this connection to telegram No. 18, from the commander-in chief, copy of which was sent to the India Office and Foreign Office on the 28th January, in which the commander-in-chief reports the seizure and subsequent release of a dhow flying Turkish colours in Muscat territorial waters. He also urges that steps may be taken to notify and enforce the prohibition of imports of arms into Koweit. My Lords hope that the measures recommended by the commander-in-chief in this telegram will be favourably considered by the Secretary of State witli a view to increasing the effectiveness of the blockade. 6. Copy of this letter has been sent to the Foreign Office, and the Secretary of State has been requested in accordance with the suggestion in paragraph 15 of the commander-in-chiefs letter of the 24th December, to give instructions to His Majesty’s consuls-general at Marseilles and Port Said to inform the commander-in-chief, East Indies, by telegraph, of any ships leaving these ports with arms and ammunition for the Persian Gulf, in order that a watch may be kept on their movements.

Foreign Office February 16th, v. : v.. . ’ * Slr:- I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknow- ledge tlie receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, relative to the Persian Gulf arms traffic and its con nection with Koweit and Turkey. I am to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that Sir E. Grey concurs in the suggested instructions to the ’Government of India respecting the Sheikh of Koweit, and in this connection I am to refer to the telegram from the Viceroy oi tne ,,i^ 13th instant, enclosed in your letter of tne 14th, respecting the case of the Koweit dhow 'muzaffarnagar , where the attitude taken by the Sheikh gives every reason to hope that his loyal co-operation in enforcing Ms proclamation may be expected. Sir E. G-rey agrees with the view taken by tne Government of India in this particular case - namely, that it is for the Sheikh of Koweit, and not for Monsieur .e Under Secretary of State, India Office.(4905/10) Monsieur Goguyer's agent or the French Consul at Muscat to make any protest that may seem called for - and he concurs in the instructions which the Government of India propose to send to Mr. Holland. With regard to the question of approaching the Turkish Government, raised in your letter of February 10th, I am to state that Sir E. Grey is consulting His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople on the subject. Sir E. Grey would, however, not be disposed in any case to agree to His Majesty's Ships seizing dhows fly ing the Turkish flag, without some previous understand ing with, or notification to, the Turkish Government, especially as the Turks are themselves opposed to the arms traffic and the amount of that traffic at present carried on in Turkish dhows appears to be inconsider able . I am.

(SP.) R. R1TSHIE-?Q 3 ♦ From Viceroy, IMh February 1910. Foreign Secret. My telegram of 4th February. On the 27th January H.M.S. “ Hyacinth ” boarded a dhow named “ Muzatt’arnagar ” in Maskat waters. Dhow had no ship papers but belonged to Koweit, and cargo of arms and ammunition was consigned from Gfoguyer to a Koweit merchant. Nakoda possessed pass signed by Sultan of Maskat authorising transport of arms and ammunition within his territorial limits. Careful enquiry was held by Holland on board flagship, and, as there were no grounds for supposing cargo intended for Persian territory, Admiral permitted dhow to continue voyage and furnished Nakoda with pass preventing search by other men-of- war. Sultan was duly informed. Goguyer’s representative has from the first taken up position of ill-used person and is making himself very objectionable. He told Holland that he is prepared to fight us in every possible way ; that the Sultan’s proclamation was waste paper in view of French treaty, and that he would press this point on French Government, and would meanwhile export arms to any place he wishes and hold us responsible for any losses he may sustain. He further informed Holland that he had contracted with Nakoda that, in event of dhow being captured by man-of-war, it should become Goguyer’s property, and he is pressing claim strongly (? for) compensation, including cost of dhow and Koweit valuation of arms, of which he now declines to take delivery. He brings a charge of wounding one of dhow’s crew by a sailor, and the theft of 25 baskets of sweetmeats by “ Hyacinth ” men. Holland has a telegram from Koweit owners of the dhow to the Maskat representative, stating that Sheikh Mubarak ordered that the dhow should be stopped. In spite of this telegram having arrived before dhow left, the Nakoda refused to obey order. Sheikh Mubarak’s Bushire agent (? confirmed) this, and told Trevor that Sheikh had issued orders prohibiting dhows sailing from Maskat during Afghan gun-running season, and threatening severe punishment to those who infringed order. The Sheikh himself, in conver sation with Captain Shakespear, admitted our right to search dhows, and expected us to do so. French Consul, in submitting Goguyer’s claim, requests recognition on grounds that it is based on French treaty still in force, and that restrictive measures introduced by Sultan have not been concurred in by the French Government. As dhow belonged to Koweit it is for Sheikh to make protest on subject of her detention and the alleged wounding of one of the crew, and Goguyer’s agent has no locus standi. Latter’s claim that, on strength of his conditional contract, dhow became his property on seizure by man-of-war cannot be allowed, and in any case it is not specifically supported by french Consul. Sheikh’s agent at Bushire informed Trevor that, on receipt of a telegram from Nakoda asking permission to sell dhow, he replied peremptorily refusing to allow sale. 1 propose to instruct Holland to reply to Consul that Government are unable to recognise that Goguyer has any claim to compensation from us for the temporary detention of his goods, or for the trifling damage caused to two packages which were opened for examination, in default of a bill of lading.

Trevor, First Assistant Resident, in charge of Residency, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the letter noted in the No. 663, dated the 29 th December 1909 . margin on the subje t of the arms traffic which I have received from the Political Agent, Koweit. It throws an in teresting light on local opinion on the question at Koweit, and shows the far- reaching effect of the successful operations of our war-ships. No. 663, dated Koweit, the 29th December 1909 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Koweit, To The First Assistant Resident, in charge of Residency, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to certain items in my recent weekly diaries regarding the arms traffic, of which copies are attached for ready reference. ° 2 A perusal of these extracts will give an idea of the manner in which the recent successes of H. M/s ships in the suppression of this traffic have affected public opinion in Koweit. Certain merchants in conversation with whom the subject has cropped up have confirmed the diary reports. 3. On the other hand, the following is a brief account of what Sheikh Mubarak and his son Sheikh Jabir consider the proper pabulum for the Political Agent, and was volunteered by them in recent conversations. Sheikh Jabir said that the news of the successful captures had slightly affected sales in Koweit, but that the import into Koweit was so small (being in fact only sufficient for local consumption) Koweit was really outside the question. Sheikh Mubarak went further and expressed himself as glad to hear of the success of H. M/s ships, and added that no Koweit dhow had been captured18 as so few made a business of carrying cargoes of arms from Maskat. Koweit occasionally imported arms, but only just enough, to meet the local demand. He also said that though dhow-owners took papers and even labelled the cases as for Koweit, they did not come to Koweit, but generally ran their cargoes on ^ the Katif coast, whence the arms were distributed to the interior, Riadh, Hail, w &amp;c., and m )st to the north among the Muntitich and other tribes from Zobeir along the Shatt-el-Arab to nearly as far as Baghdad. The rates for carriage, he informed me, were about $18 from the Katif coast to Kejd and about $23 from the same place to Zobeir and the north-west, in both cases the rate being based on a camel-load of 20 rifles without ammunition. He added that the traffic was largely in the hands of the Ajman Bedouin. He admitted that some of this overland traffic found its way to Koweit, but only a very small proportion, quite two-thirds of the imports going to the north. He said he had been accused by the Wali at Basrah of allowing Koweit to be used as a depot for forwarding arms to the Arab tribes on the river, but had pointed out to him that the real fault lay with the Turkish officials in Katif and fiassa. Both Chiefs remarked on our apparently fatuous policy of attempting to l stop the traffic in the Persian Gulf without prohibiting manufacture in England and export thence, and instead employing the much more expensive machinery of ships-of-war to stop fast-sailing native craft over an area of hundreds of \ square miles of open sea. As a large proportion of the arms, at least of those in Koweit, are of English manufacture, no doubt the present policy does seem incomprehensible, and is answered, I am afraid, by the specious argu ment that the English Government does not desire to cause loss to its own manufacturers in England, but prefers to shift the burden of any such loss on to the shoulders of the native purchasers in Maskat. 4 . In submitting the above my main object is to show that Sheikh Mubarak so far has not abandoned his old policy of attempting to hoodwink us as to the real state of the arms trade in Koweit, and not because I attach any value to the information volunteered, which I regret, I am convinced, is supplied solely for official consumption. Extracts from the diaries of the Political Agent, Koweit, Nos. 51 and 52, for two weeks ending 22nd and 29th December. ******* The news of the recent capture of dhows and rifles at Maskat by His Majesty’s gun-boats has caused an alarm among the firearms dealers in Koweit. Haji Muhammad Taki’s boom which had gone for the purpose of bring ing arms has come back empty for fear of being captured by the gun-boats. An Arab dealer in firearms was making enquiries that he had heard of the capture of dhows carrying rifles and asked whether it was safe for him to send specie to purchase arms at Maskat. He was told that he could do just as he liked and take the chance. He also enquired whether the import of fire arms into and export from Maskat would be stopped altogether. He said he had heard something to that effect. Firearms are now openly sold in Koweit and it is no more a secret. Several new shops have recently been opened where arms are kept for sale. One Basri bought a dozen Mauser pistols from a shop where the Agency head clerk happened to be present and made no attempt to hide them. They murmured that the pistols were made by the Englishmen 1 * * * It is reported that Sheikh Jabir bin Mubarak has been discussing the attitude of the English Government in trying to stop the import into and export from Maskat of firearms and thereby causing heavy loss to merchants. He is supposed to have said that the English should first stop their manufac turers at home. The Sheikh of Koweit will be a considerable loser by the stoppage of the arms traffic from Maskat, as he used to get $6 on every rifle imported.* 19 Telegram P., No. 66, dated (and received) the 20th January 1910.

From—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir. A. H. McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S I., Chief Commissioner and Agent to 'he Governor-General in Balu chistan, Sibi, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Copy of the telegram you showed me at Calcutta regarding negotiations for purchase by Afghans of land near Geh has not yet been received by me, but from what I remember of the telegram I have now come to definite con clusion that land in question is a small tract of good land botween Rapch and Bint which was given about seven years ago by Saiyid Khan of Geh to Mulla Khair Muhammad commonly known as Khalifa, who had made a good Kharez* to irrigate it. The K-afila, • (?“ canal” or “ attempt. ) -^Lo is an Afghan, formerly of Shorawak, has many disciples including Sardars Islam Khan of Bint and Saiyid Khan of Geh. The Afghan gun-runners whom he assists largely visit him, and we would have endeavoured to seize him or get him removed were it not for his religious influence. He wrote last year to us and offered this land for sale or exchange for similar tract in Mastung. For what then appeared to be an obviously good reason I ignored the offer. I have forgotten the actual details of the correspondence, but I have sent to Quetta for the papers. It is quite probable that in hopes of being allowed to return to Afghanistan the Khalifa is selling the land to the Afghans. He may, however, be willing27 to sell it to others for a hisrh^r figure. It is clearly important to prevent the sale of the land to the Afghans, as it is most favourably situated for a depot or colony as regards coast and main route inland. The only courses which appear to me to he open are either to prevent or cancel sale by threaten ing Saiyid Khan with the wrath of the Persian Government, or to purchase it ourselves at a higher price through Sardar Mehrah Khan of Gitchki and then dispose of it to Saiyid Khan by gift or otherwise. Except it were backed by threat of action by ourselves in name of the Persian Government the first alternative would have no effect and would turn this important and useful Sardar against us in any case. Ihe advantage offered by the second alternative would be to strengthen our relations with the Sardar by means of McConaghey who is well acquainted with San id Khan and other Sardars. He I as visited them and the land in question. Should my suggestions appear to the Govern ment of India to merit consideration they would perhaps, in order to enable McConaghey to supply any further information that may be required, desire him to he sent to Calcutta. 66 Telegram P., No. 82, dated the 25th (received 26th) January 1910. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Please see my telegram* No. 14 over 36 dated the 12th January. I have * Serial No. i. now received a long rambling reply from Saidar Saiyid Khan to my warning in which, among other things, he says that he is servant not only of the Persian Government but also of the British Government, that Afehan trading caravans have always been friendly with the Baluchis and that Afshans ar? numerous and said to total 1,000 or 2,000 men this year and that he is unable xo expGi tiieiii. The Sardar concludes “ you are aware further that the larse number of Afghans are not under the control of tiie Baluchis and that there had been no 1 4 r^ among them and that unless the Government prevent them such affairs cannot be regulated by me. I will not refuse to perform orders and services of Kaisar-i-Hmd and will abide by what yon may say, and act upon your instructions. In such duties and affairs it is my duty to afford co-operation and guidance m your work, but the prevention and the expulsion of the Afghan are beyond the power of myself and my tribe. Please let me know and I will periorm any work or services you may have for me. ,, I am replying to Sardar reminding him that he was not asked to exnel Afghans but only to refrain from aiding, and granting any concessions to the gun-runners. In my opinion now that Sardar Saiyid Khan sees that we mean business in regard to the suppression of the Mekran arms traffic, he is unlikelv voluntarily to grant any concession of land to the Afghans. ^ Addressed to the Government of India in the Foreign Denartment W repeated to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. &amp; P at and29 O 71 No. 59, dated Maskat, the 16th (received 25th) January 1910 (ConRdential).

His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran telegraphs that the Adminis trator of Customs has telegraphed to all Gulf offices to strictly examine cases and luggage arriving from Maskat. He has appointed Monsieur Constant (who was here for some time as Director, and is returning in “ Tabaristan ” which is due in a few days) to he Special Inspector, Jask-Charhar, instead of taking over Directorate of Bunder Ahhas as intended. Meanwhile, pending Constant’s arrival, the Officer Commanding Charbar and Austin are authorised to attend Customs House inspections.

Arms traffic. Arms merchants are beginning to move their arms from Maskat to Koweit. Admiral strongly urges that Sheikh’s pioclamation of 24th May .1900 should be made widely known, and that Sultan of Maskat should be asked to include Koweit dhows within the scope of his pioclamation. Both Admiral and Acting Resident in Gulf think it essential to search Koweit dhows and confiscate arms and ammunition on them. We piopose with your approval issuing orders that action may be taken under the Koweit proclamation outside Maskat territorial waters at once, and within those waters if Sultan of Maskat will issue necessary pioclamation , also that action be taken under Bahrein and Trucial Chiefs’ proclamation and notifications (see Enclosure 4 to our Secret External Despatch No. 108 of 7th July 1898, and Enclosure 20 to our Secret External Despatch No. 9 of 29th January 1903). Bahrein may claim surrender of contraband under the proclamation, but we need not anticipate difficulty at present. Major Trevor revives suggestion of agreement with Turkev authorising action against dhows which fly Turkish flag in Gulf of Oman ~and Persian Gulf [vide our Secret External Despatch No. 24 of 21st February 1907). If this be appropriate time to move, we support proposal. Agent of Goguyer firm is starting device of contracting to buy dhow in the event of capture, and has made representations about a dhow captured and released m Maskat waters, facts m this case will be communicated wdien full report is received, but clearly transaction of this kind cannot be regarded as bond fide.

Rights op Visit, Search, and Detention. THE following instructions on the rights of visit, search, and detention of vessels by His Majesty’s ships are communicated for information and guidance:— 2. Under the General Act of the Brussels Conference, 1890, His Majesty’s ships are invested with the powers of visit, search, and detention over vessels suspected of being engaged in or equipped for the slave trade, under certain conditions which are laid down in the “ Instructions to Naval-Officers employed in the Suppression of the Slave Trade ” (pp. 2 -13.) 3. Articles 8-13 of the General Act prohibit the importation of fire-arms and ammunition into the territories therein specified, hut the Brussels Act does not in itself confer any powers of search or detention for the enforcement of the articles quoted. . , 4. Such rights as His Majesty’s ships possess to search and detain vessels suspected of being engaged in the arms traffic are derived from local regulations, when the vessels are in British territorial waters, and from agreements made with certain foreign States when the vessels are in their respective territorial waters. His Majesty s ships have not authority to search upon the high seas vessels suspected of being engaged in the arms traffic, in the absence of treaties with other Powers, and in the case of British vessels, of an Act of the Imperial Parliament. 5. The rights of His Majesty’s ships in this connection are summarised in the annexed statement. EDMOND J. W. SLADE.[ This iJocument is the Property of His .Britannic Majest/s Government.] WITH reference to Count di Boadari’s note of the Uth May last relative to the reported arms smuggling by a British steamer at Muscat, I have the honour to acquaint your Excellency with the facts of the case as now ascertained by the Govern ment of India. It appears that on the 5th September, 1907, the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steam»ship “ Dwarka ” arrived at Mohammerah from Eushire. On arrival at that port a certain number of unclaimed suspicious cases were discovered on board. It was decided that these should, on the return voyage, be handed over to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Muscat, the original port of lading. Accordingly, on the 18th September, 1907, the Commander of the “ Dwarka ” delivered over to the Consul at Muscat fourteen large boxes, five small cases, and seventeen bundles of arms and ammunition. At the request of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, these articles were handed over to one of his representatives, and His Highness appears subsequently to have restored the arms to their original owners—certain local gun merchants. These merchants then arranged with the nakhodas of some sambuks lying in the harbour to transport these and other arms to Koweit, one of which sambuks was the “ Eathel Rahaman.” ARMS TRAFFIC.

On 5th September 1907, the British India Steam Navigation Company’s S. S. “ Dwarka ” arrived at Mohammerah from Bushire ; on arrival at that port a certain number of unclaimed suspicious cases were discovered. It was decided that these should, on the return voyage, be handed over to the Consul at Maskat, the orginal port of landing. 3. On the 18th September 1907, the Commander of S. S. “ Dwarka ” deli vered over to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Maskat 14 large boxes, 5 small cases and 17 bundles arms and ammunition. At the request of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat these articles were handed over to one of his representatives. His Highness the Sultan afterwards appears to have restored these arms to the original owners of the same, viz.) certain local gun merchants. These merchants afterwards made terms with the Nakhodas of some Sambooks lying in the harbour to transport these and other arms to Koweit. One of the Sambooks engaged appears to have been the “ Fathel Raha- man.” I1908. SIMLA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. No. 172, DATED THE 24TH SEPTEMBER 1908.

Jtf ^ “S’ Your Excellency, . 27th M arcl1 7908 - The Italian Consul at Hodeida reported as follows to my Govern ment on 29th January last. ., , Cavaliere Mezzadri, an Italian merchant established many years at Hodeida, and whose business, among other things consists m importing dates from Basrah, chartered and dispatched last summer an Arab Red Sea sambout to the waters of the Shat-el-Arab. On arrival at Muskat the nakuda of the sambouk was asked by the captain of an English steamer which was anchored there with a cargo of guns and ammuni tion for Kuweit, to transport, as he would have wished to do, arms an ammunition to the country of the Emir Moharah-el-Sabbah, together with other sambouks which were sailing at the same time. The Enghs UZAU (according to the declarations made to the Arab nakudas) sanXT 6 chartered U Mezzadn allowed himself to be tempted by the great gain, which was totally unexpected, and accepted at once. He therefore conveyed and unloaded from his boat at 0 |°yAib 0 uks did ,„d .1= ”;,z. jsysr— the same, bu _ f t *o- that the English steamer was said to WsVoO^uns^onboard The nakuda stated further that this same have 8^000 g ^ all ne to unload the arms m question at steamship ,-i p prs i an shore of the Persian Gulf, in transit for Mohammerah, on tl ^ did not a H 0W the steamship to Koweit; that the local autho t th the that at last, unload such a cargo and had wished to e ^ consented to '^LUTe arms 3 on the chat’s undertaking to take them back to replace whereThey had heenbhipped, for which reason the steamship had to return to Muskat with her cargo.In bringing the above to Your Excellence’s knowledge, I have the honour to call the attention of the British Government not only to the facts themselves, but to the necessity of taking steps in order that the Bay of Muskat may not become a centre for the traffic in arms with Somali Land. In anticipation of the reply with which Your Excellency may be pleased to favour me in the matter, I have, &amp;c., The Right Hon. Sir E. Grey, Bart., A. de Bosdari. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Enclosure No. 2. of India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 13th April 1908. 1 am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to acknowledge the receipt your letter No. 10,956, dated the 8th April 1908, with which was forwarded a Note from the Italian Charge d’Affaires calling attention to a case in which a British steamer at Muskat engaged an Arab sambouk from the Red Sea, m the emplo 3 r ment of an Italian merchant, to smuggle arms into Koweit. It is stated that the steamer had previously attempted to unload the arms at Mohammerah, but had been prevented from doing so by the local authorities. The case seems to Mr. Morley one that requires investigation at Mohammerah, Muskat, and Koweit. But it would facilitate such m 9 u ^ e ® ^ precise information could be furnished as to the dates on which the transaction occurred, and as to the names or other particulars by which the steamer and the sambouk could be identified. Mr. Morley would therefore suggest, for Sir E. Grey’s ’ consideration mat, before instructions are sent to the Government of India to institute inquiries at Muskat and Koweit, the Italian Government should be requester to furnish a more detailed statement of the circumstances reported by them. , A® Sir b if, aware the importation of arms at Koweit has been forbidden by the Sheikh, though it has not been found practicable to enforce the carrying out of the prohibition. Nor does the export of arms f 0 ^Qfl S t- TfT® 1 *, 001116 , within the sc °P e of th e Sultan’s Notification of loJo which declared such export to Persia and British India illegal. s regards Mohammerah, the import of arms into Persian territory has been prohibited by the Persian Government, and it would apparently have been within the rights of the local authorities to have cmffiscated the consignment m question. . A f r : Morle y assumes that, if it is thought desirable to institute inquiries, a report will be called for from the Consul at Mohammerah as weil as from the Political Agents at Muskat and Koweit.

He is, however, of opinion, having regard to the line taken up by the Italian Government on the question of the arms traffic, that the correspondence should be brought to the notice of the Government of India, with a view to their ascertaining from the Political Agents at Muscat and Koweit whether, on the report furnished by the Italian Government, it is practicable to obtain reliable information concerning the transaction.

In connection with the arms trade I have the honour to bring to your notice the following information for which I am indebted to the British India Company’s Agent at Karachi. 2. Two steamers, the “John O. Scott,” and another belonging, so 1 am told, to the Bombay-Persian Company and a party of Basra (native) merchants res pectively, which are at present trading at the north end of the Persian Gulf, have been solicited by various arms merchants to extend their trips to Maskat with a view to carrying arms and ammunition from that port to Koweit and other Gulf Ports. This they have agreed to do from the beginning of November next. 3. The British India Company would be much put out if this were allowed, and their Agent here has begged me either to take measures for the frustration of the plan, or, to obtain permission for his Company to carry arms themselves in order to mitigate the chances of successful competition against them in regard to passenger and other traffic.

In continuation of ray letter N&lt;x 528; dated the 29th September 1907, on the subject of Monsieur Elbaz’s visit to Koweit and his prolonged stay here I have the honour to report that, on the morning of the 5th October, the Sheikh s Secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar was announced. He came to my office, accompanied by Monsieur Elbaz. 2. I asked the reason of the visit and the Sheikh’s Secretary produced a paper and asked me to witness Monsieur Elbaz’s signature to the document in question. A copy with translation is forwarded herewith. The Secretary pro ceeded to explain that this was an acknowledgment by Monsmur Ejbaz that h s accounts with Sheikh Mubarak had been closed and settled, and that he had no further claims against Sheikh Mubarak, and that ie ! f ^ a a&lt; j\ rnn q Pn t importance to my signing as a witness and would be thankful 1 wou to do so. 3. Monsieur Elbaz’s signature has already been affixed to the document, bu speaking in Arabic, he acknowledged his signature and that is c aims a adjusted. I asked when Monsieur Elbaz proposed to leave Koweit and he sa to-morrow or !the next day. He seemed ill at ease and dissatisfied with the course events were taking. 4. I informed the Sheikh’s Secretary that it would be necessar y for j*® 1 °*®® the Sheikh about the documents before affixing my signature ® ve , aa and through him, made an appointment to visit the Sheikh a a . ^ 5. I visited the Sheikh accordingly and he informed me that, as 1 well hnew. Monsieur Goguyer had tried to establish himself in Koweit an u ^ the requisite permission. He then sent Ali bin Thahaba here as an uarre ]j e ^ sale of small arms and ammunition, that the principal and ageri r , r and Sheikh Mubarak was delighted to hear of it, Monsieu . Sheikh appealed to Sheikh Mubarak for assistance in settling his c aim _ a was Mubarak replied that he regretted he could do nothing, as i pi, _ was a Maskati and not a Koweit subject. Then this Ibrahim or Monsieur Elbaz,was sent to settle up the claims and that the Sheikh who had also ^ with him, had his books examined and the balance was foun _ c prevent paid and that what the Sheikh now wanted was my ^ as ked the worrying claims from Monsieur Goguyer in the future. Un 1 &gt; Onmiver’s Sheikh whether I could now report to Government tha f 50 Goguyer transactions with Koweit had been settled all round and tha _ with and his agents would not visit Koweit or have any further usine , the town.

He said that he had come armed with a letter of introduction from the Sultan of Muscat who alleges that Ihrahim is a Mussulman convert to settle his accounts with Ali Mn Ah»ed uth Thahaba , . pozzak. Apparently the settle- ana Sheikh Moosa bin Abdur HazzaK. j +v , +vip first named had not been a simple ment of accounts with the nrax matterZ-rA) matter for he had given them the slip and gone to Bahrein. He has not yet returned. 4. I pointed out to Sheikh Mobarak that there was no doubt that Monsieur Goguyer was a spy and that, at the present juncture at least, it seemed to me very undesirable that any of his people should be hanging about in Kuweit. The Sheikh agreed and said that he would see that the man left. 5, Sheikh Mobarak also told me a curious tale that Monsieur Goguyer, when refused permission to reside in Koweit, had informed Sheikh Moosa that he did not understand Sheikh Mobarak’s attitude and that he would bring a French man of war who would settle M.

Cox, C.I.E., Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 480 dated 3rd of September 1907, I have the honour to inform you, on reliable authority, that M. Elbaz, alias Ibrahim, is still in Koweit. He presented himself at the dispensary on the morning of the 98th instant to ask if there were any letters for him. He is known to have remitted Rs. S3,000 by the slow mail of the S8th September and it is reported that he sent a like remittance about a fortnight previously. P. He is described to me as w r ell-dressed in Arab clothing, w-ears sandals, has light hair, long and heavy moustache, clipped beard. He stands about 5 foot 3 inches in height, has a hoarse voice and is addicted to the use of scent. 3 . i should be glad to know if these particulars of his personal appearance can be confirmed. 4 He lives with one Dahaish bin Gthman and his friendsisiraiB ismjm !• friends are Syud Yasin, sheikh Moosa bin Abdur Razzak and Abdul Aziz ut Tawaijari, all three noted arms dealers. The tv.'o former are personally known to me and the last named is almost certainly connected with the people of Majma’s in ITejd. 5. M. Elbaz is, I hear, canvassing for orders for fire-arms and was talking to one of the family of Haji Muhammed Taqi this morning. 6. I have the honour to request the favour of instructions as to whether any further remonstrances should be addressed to sheikh Mobarak on the continued presence of this man in Koweit or not. It seems clear that he has not the slightest indention of performing the promise he made to me reported in paragraph 4 of my letter quoted above I have, etc., (Sd) S. G-.

With reference to Foreign Department telegram dated 22nd March 1906, authorising me to instruct the Political Agent to remind the Sheikh of Koweit formally of his Arms Prohibition^ of 1900 and to request stricter enforcement of it on his part, I have the honour to forward copies of the correspondence detailed in the margin, which has since passed on the subject.

It has always been realised that the question of the Arms Traffic to Koweit is a delicate one requiring very cautious handling, and it will also be remembered that the reminder above alluded to was prompted rather by the necessity of preserving the correctness of our attitude vis a vis the Sublime Porte rather than by the expectation that it would have any marked or lasting effect on the traffic. The sequel to Captain Knox’s remonstrance now tends to demonstrate that the question of the enforcement or non-enforcement of the Prohibition is likely to prove a rock upon which the friendly relations between our Political Agent and the Sheikh may at any time be placed in danger of splitting. In the present case, for instance, from the occasion of his interview with the ^heikh of 25th May alluded to in the enclosures, Captain Knox dates the com mencement of a noticeable falling off in the cordial and frequent intercourse which had previously been customary between them, a change which it was impossible for the Political Agent to ignore. My absence from head-quarters during the ensuing two months had prevented my giving Captain Knox any practical assistance in the matter and just before my return the tension had be come so inconvenient that Captain Knox had been obliged to refer to me for instructions; I am glad to say, however, that later reports received simu tane- ouslv with my return showed that the matter was likely to adjust itself an Cantain Knox agreed with me in thinking that incidental allusion to the sub ject in an informal news-letter from myself to the Sheikh would meet the case. I attach for information copies of the communication so exchanged between Sheikh Mubarak and myself, and think the cloud may be considered to have passed over, but its passage has been sufficient to demonstrate the direction of the wind, where the Arms traffic is concernea. ^ Reverting to the general question, I fear that the language held by the Sheikh in regard thereto cannot be taken very seriously. He indeed alludes plausibly to The possible stoppage ol the .mport into Maskat but in the event o the elimination of that port as the chief emporium it is probable that a great deal of the trade would be transferred to Koweit; and since I have had an opportu- n U of inspecting in the Bombay Dockyard the launches under construction for the Persian Government, 1 am the more inclined to think, especially in the event of our negociations with the French fading, that the means of suppres- skm indicated iif paragraph 4 (b) of my letter No. 585 of 3 .st December .905 may on the whole prove the most profitable.

Knox, I A , Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. COX, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 142, dated 24th April 1906, 1 have the honour to report that Sheikh Mubarak paid me a visit on the 25th May 1906, and that we had a long conversation on the subject of the Arms Trade. 2. The Sheikh denied that arms were brought into Koweit except in very small quantities for private purposes, not for trade. He also talked Ipiig about M GoVuyer, said that he publicly visited Bahrein and resided openly in Maskat and the Sheikh contrasted his own conduct with that of the other two chiefs. 3 During this part of the conversation, he said that M. Goguyer had advis ed him to keep the representatives of two or three powers in the place so that thev should pull different ways and the Sheikh make profit out of them all. 1 he Sheikh savs that he replied that he feared none of them but that he saw one whose ways were good and true and preferred that one, whtle he had no fancy for any of the others. a 1 said that there were ample proofs to our mind that arms were being imported in large quantities. 1 reminded him of the cartridges that i had se en and he said that he had sent 16 boxes to Bin Saood. Here 1 remarked that f had counted s° boxes and that I had only seen the last consignment of the buggalow load. 5 1 told him how a shopkeeper in the bazaar had told me that thfduty on each rifle was six dollars and would no doubt have given me much more Interesting information, had 1 not gone away for fear of getting t e man into trouble. 1 said that letters from and to noted arms merchants were constantly coming and going through our Post Office and that we estimated his annual revenue from the trade in round figures at a lakh of dollars. , I then explained to him, as coming from myself, that the reason why we nr loin ally asked him to notify a prohibition was because so many arms were bemgsmiTggted to rebellious tribis on our Indian frontier, and that this whole- salelmportlfion in spite of the prohibition enables bis enemies and ours o mis represent matters and attnbu^far-fetched motives^of ev^ndtous and^hnm can well do if he chooses.6. Sheikh Mubarak replied that he was as determined as ever to enforce his prohibition but strongly advised that we should stop the trade in Maskat. As regards the lakh of dollars which he took up rather strongly, he said that he did not want it and that if nothing else would convince us of his innocence, he would make the Nakhodas of Koweit vessels procure a clearance certificate from His Majesty’s Consul at Maskat that their cargo was innocent. y. There is no doubt that the Sheikh has received a clear warning and I re - gret to say that I believe he will disregard it. The proclamation is not worth the paper it is written on and is only a cause of friction. 8. So much, however,^ must be said that, since this warning it appears that there has been a lull in the importation of arms into Koweit, i.e., during the month of June. It will probably not last long. s Dated the 30th July 1906. From—MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E,, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To— Sheikh Mubarak-us Subah, Koweit. After greeting and inquiry after his health. When I last visited Koweit with His Excellency the Admiral I was very sorry to miss seeing you owing to your absence from Koweit, but I thought it was on account of the severe illness of your deceased son Fahd, and at a time of anxiety did not trouble you with letters._ Since then, as you mav have heard from Captain Knox, I have been continuously absent from head quarters and only returned two days ago after two months in India. It grieves me much to read on my return that in the short time of mv absence your two sons Fahd and Sabha have been taken from you. This is a heavy calamity and I beg you to accept my deepest sympathy in your bereave- r&gt; U j S d iS cult for us t0 understand these things, but we must bow to the will ot God. Please convey my condolences also to your son Sheikh Jabir. • Ano ^ er matter t0 ° has been a source of much regret to me to read and this is that while I have been away some misunderstanding has interfered with the pleasant and frequent intercourse which had always been customary between you and Captain Knox. I am delighted to learn however by the mail which has iust come after my own return that any little estrangement that there may have been has now been removed. I have always found your relations with Captain Knox so pleasant when I have visited Koweit that it would be a great disappointment to me if anything were to come between you and him. * a i n -* SUre ^ S n0t ^ ldden fr° m y° u &gt; is tbe unchanging wish of my Gov ernment and its officers to honour you and maintain your dignity in every way possible, and cannot doubt but that it is your own wish also to reciprocate in this respect and that our trusted representative at Koweit (and he the onlv Englishman in your territory) should have an honourable and honoured position m your eyes and those of your subjects. I hope that this will always be the case Now regarding my absence in India. I went first to Simla and was honoured with a visit to the new Viceroy, His Excellency Lord Minto, who spoke to me about the affairs of the Gulf. His good-will to you and interest in your affaTrs and prospenty !s no less than that of his honoured predecessor, Lord Curzon With regard to the latter you will I know be very sorry to hear that within The last few days he has suffered a grievous calamity in the death of his wife Lady Curzon, after a short illness. Perhaps you would like to send him a letter or telegram of condolence He would I am sure appreciate it. If y 0 u care to send any message to me I will see it forwarded to its destination. } d On my return from Simla I went to Bombay to look at a steam a then saw and tdked with Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed of Bahrein. He is importunme much to be allowed to return to Bahrein and if Sheikh Esa can givff^arantees for h.s good behaviour I may be able to recommend Government to let him po 1 ‘ b “ ld -y■Mi ■ ■ .. ~E! P r This is all the news I have. What is your news ? What is the condition of affairs in Nejd and the state of your relations with Bin Saood and with the family of bin Rashid ? Finally I trust you had a pleasant visit to our friend Sheikh Khazal and found him in the best of health and prosperity. I hope I shall receive your esteemed letter before long and hear good news from your side. May you be preserved and salaam. Translation of a letter, dated 3rd August igo6, from Sheikh Mubarak*us-Subah to Major Cox, In the most fortunate time I was honoured by (receiving) your honoured letter dated 30th July 1906 and was glad to learn your well-being and I under stood all what you had stated. As regards what you had remarked about His Excellency the Admiral, my friend, I was exceedingly grateful to be present at the service of you all* and I came as promised and stayed for three days after the (lapse of the) time fixed; although I was indisposed when I came from Jarah, but I did so in order to pay (my) respects to you all and converse with you. During my stay in town my indisposition is increased, and all my family were at Jarah. Captain Knox had noticed this. As regards your sympathy with me, this is due to your cordiality towards me and as to what had befallen them (*.£., his deceased sons) such are the ways of the world. With regard to what you had said about my friend, _ Captain Knox, who is to me like a brother, if God please I will always hold him in esteem and pay him high reverence, for two reasons ; firstly, because of my duty and loyalty to the Gov ernment, and secondly for his personality and for our social intercourse. I consider myself to be an official like him on behalf of the Government. HI experience from him anything disagreeable owing to his not knowing the fact, I will discuss the matter with him and warn him. And notwithstanding this, if any m'sunder- standing had occurred for him and if he had written to you anything against me, it will in my opinion prove to him afterwards that I was in the right. You had written that I am always under the good graces of the Government. This is proved to me owing to my integrity and sincerity towards them and my cordiality with you. ~ — i f ....

'W ith reference to the correspondence marginally noted, I have the honour to lay before the Government of India certain aspects of the existing traffic in arms, to and from Koweit, which seem to need early consideration. 2 . I need not, I think, go into details of the previous history of our negotiations with Sheikh Mubarak in this regard. The mere fact that the prohibition existed has no doubt tended to reduce the traffic somewhat by making it contrabrand ; on the other hand, the Sheikh of Koweit, although invariably denying the impeachment when made, has never displayed any serious desire to make his undertaking to suppress the traffic effective. Political reasons, however, connected with the struggle between Bin Saood and Bin Bashid for the Nejd supremacy and the delicacy of our Political Agent’s position on first arrival at Koweit, have of late made it difficult for us to come to direct issue with Sheikh Mubarak on the subject, and our action has been limited to drawing the Sheikh’s pointed attention from time to time, to large shipments arriving at Koweit and to the endeavour to trace the ramifica tions of the trade. 3. During the last few weeks, the traffic has been brought into prominence in the following manner :— I. The Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company having had their friendly attention drawn to the fact that large quanti ties of arms are being shipped to Koweit by their steamers, colourably manifested as limes or halwa, remind me of the fact that in spite of the prohibition which was notified to British subjects, foreign lines can carry arms to Koweit with impunity and that the Russian line’s steamer Trouvor recently landed 25 cases of arms there. II. The Political Agent, Maskat, reported by telegram to myself and Government on 20th November, the alleged acquisition by Goguyer of a permit or invitation from Sheikh Mubarak to trade in arms to Koweit. The information since furnished by Captain Knox on this subject is contained in the memorandum which accompanies this letter from which it will be seen that in spite of the Sheikh’s disclaimers, the intimation of the French Consul apparently has some tangible foundation. III. In the same telegram as that just mentioned, Major Grey also reported that Monsieur Laronce had repeated to him suggestions which he made two or three years ago to me, that we should come to terms with the French Government with a view to the suppres sion of the arms trade to Maskat. 4. The permit quoted by Monsieur Laronce was apparently obtained by Goguyer three years ago, and the action of the French in producing it at this juncture, i.e., during the progress of the negotiations for the interpretation of the Hague Award and accompanying it by a protest against the obstruction offered by us to the arms trade with Koweit, inevitably prompts the conjec ture that in their readiness to enter into negotiations with us now, they may be actuated by the belief that while obtaining from us substantial political or pecuniary quid pro quos for themselves and the Sultan, for their co-operationThe correspondence quoted in the opening paragraph of this letter does not make it quite clear to me how far we are in a position to prevent KowMt thus becoming the entrepdt of the arms trade without first settling accounts with other powers interested, but in view of the facts above alluded to, it may be found necessary for Government to weigh the comparative cost and advan tages of:— (i) Giving a quid pro quo to the Trench Government for acquiescing in the stoppage of the trade to Maskat. (ii) Enhancing the subsidy of the Sultan of Maskat to an extent which wili leave him without a grievance on this score. (iii) Possibly taking the same course in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit. As n gainst:— {a) The removal of all restrictions on the traffic in arms on the western shore of the Gulfs of Oman and Persia. (b) The inauguration of organised measures, in co-operation with the Persian Government, in order to kill the trade on this side, in which we are mainly interested, by thoroughly policing the e istern shores of the Gulfs above mentioned. This, I know, is a formidable undertaking. It is true that the Belgian Customs are doing their best in their own interest to combat the smuggling that now goes on through the small ports of the littoral, and the sea-going launches which the Government of India are building for them, Mill no doubt help to make their endeavours more effective, but I need hardly state that if we take up this measure in co-operation with them, our present naval resources in these waters will not suffice for the purpose. It is with some hesitation, after what has previously passed, that I allude to the possible necessity for a seemingly retrograde policy in connection with the arms trade of the Gulf, but in case the question should be found to resolve itself into a mere business consideration as to which method is likely to effect the desired end at the least cost, whether financial or political, I have ventured to direct attention to the problems which the present developments of the question seem to indicate. MEMORANDUM Owing purport of sevrral detached items of information furnished by the Folitieal A. ent, Koweit, between 23rd November and 11th December 1905. On the 20th November, telegraphic information was received from the Political Agent, Maskat, that the Frenchman Goguyer, armed with a letter from Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit inviting him to deal in arms in his territory, had protested to the French Government against the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in placing obstacles in the way of his arms traffic. Ihe Political Agent, Koweit, Mas asked demi-officially to endeavour to obtain a copy, or at all events ascertain the date, of the Sheikh’s letter to Goguyer. In reply to the Political Agent’s enquiries, Sheikh Mubarak deni 3 d most emphatically that he or any of his family, or of the Koweit merchants of standing, had ever addressed such a letter to Goguyer; on the contrary, he said that he had copies of letters in M'hich he had written to Goguyer that he had refused to have anything to do M r ith him, and he promised to send copies of these letters. At the same time he admitted to Captain Knox that a few arms did come in for Koweitis, here and there. A little later on when Haji Ali Thahaba, Goguyer’s recently dismissed Koweit Agent, was taking leave of M,ubarak previous to proceeding to Maskat3 r^s. in order to settle up Ms accounts with Goguyer, Mobarek is reported to have said : — “ Go, but ask Goguyer how be came to say that he had a letter written by me to him, when he knew perfectly well how many letters he has sent to me and to Seyyed Khalifa, to which he has received no reply.” So much for Sheikh Mubarak’s ostensible attitude. On the other hand, Captain Knox has received from a source which he seems to consider entitled to some credence details of the following correspondence, said to have taken place between Mubarak and one P. Massonet, acting on behalf of the “ Manufacture d’armes a feu,” at Liege. In reply to this Company’s letter offering their services, the Sheikh is reported to have written on the 23rd September :— “ I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter written in Prench and German, dated 19th August, and note contents. As regards arms which are generally imported into this country from Mask at, if you are anxious to have transactions with the people here in this class of goods, I hope your so doing will prove most satisfactory, and the merchants will be glad to open their business with ypu. I shall try my utmost to protect your interests in this line of business, and shall be pleased to furnish you with the address of the well-known merchants to whom you may consign your goods whenever you want to ship them.” This letter elicited the following reply from Liege “ I have received your letter and do not clearly understand it. I could either appoint an agent, if you wished, or would you kindly give me the name and address of a merchant who would, with your approval, act as my agent ?

He says that the French Government have not been informed of the prohibition to import arms into Koweit and that they suggest that the British Government should make nroposals to their 5 or the cessation of arms trade at Maskat which he believes would be accepted provided that a settlement with the Sultan of Maskat is effected by us as the parties chiefly interested in the matter.

' A fbu evt THujc^aJr Cu ^&lt;^i &lt; gi Previous Papers:D i /Tl, /3« I find the following article in Al-A hr am, dated the 16th September 1904: ' Arabia. From our special correspondent at Masqat. It is now established that Ibn-i-Rashid has been defeated and Ibn-i-Saood has gained victory. But the report about the death of Ibn-i-Rashid is false ; also is the report of Ibn-i-Saood capturing six guns of the Turkish troops untrue. Ibn-i-Saood captured only one gun, while the remaining guns had been rendered useless by the Turkish troops. The most important thing is that the Sheikh of Koweithas given up his neutrality and has openly taken protection of the English. You have heard that Mubarak Ibn i-Sabah sent a telegram to the Sublime Porte, intimating that if the Turkish troops did not abstain from helping Ihn-i-Rashid then he would assist Ibn-i-Saood, and seek protection of a foreign power, who would protect him from all harm. He further added in the telegram that foreign powers desire to extend their protection to the Arab Amirs, but the latter prefer to remain subjects of His Majesty the Sultan. But the Sublime Porte did not send him a reply. Consequently Mubarak sought protection of the English, who have been trying to gain this object for four years past. On the 8th April 1903, Mr. Balfour stated in the House of Commons that the Sheikh of Koweit had entered into special agreements with the English. But the Sheikh repudiated this statement and said that he w^as subject to the Sublime Porte. And now he has since two weeks openly renounced his allegiance to the Sultan, and has permitted a British Consul to reside at Koweit. The English have also established a post office there; and the Consul is now endeavouring to open a small dispensary for the treatment of the poor Arab sick freely. In this way the English have got their footing and flag fixed in Koweit, which is Turkish territory, by the consent of Sheikh Mubarak. Koweit is the key of Arabia in the Persian Gulf. It is key of Irak, and the territory between the two rivers, as the roads lead easily and without obstacles to the interior of Irak from Koweit. In addition to this, Mubarak is on friendly terms with the Sheikhs who reside along these roa&lt;js. Mubarak has been helping all the Sheikhs for a distance of 500 miles, who break out into rebellion, and he sup plies them with arms and ammunition and other supplies they want. All what he requires comes from India, and if it was not for the help of Mubarak the said Arabs would not be able to rebel for want of supplies. Mail steamers call once a week at Koweit via Maskat; and the Koweit merchants ship every week hundreds of rifles and ammunition, etc., to Koweit. They have adopted a well-known practice, i.e., they write on the cases containing firearms “ cases containing sweetmeats;” and those holding cartridges, “dried limes.” The customs officials at Maskat do not inquire about the contents of the cases, while the English officers, who last year made such a noise, when they found a Erenchman carrying six revolvers, shut their eyes when these cases are concerned. The customs officials at Bushire once opened one of these cases and found fifty rifles in them, and a large number of cartridges. But the English Consul came there and shut their mouths and pressed their hands, and prevented them from making further inspection of the cases, and the arms were restored to the owners, who took them over to Sheikh Mubarak. Thus Ibn-i-Saood obtains his arms from Koweit and the latter from the English ; and so the English are the agents, who supply the Arabs with arms. I know as a fact that, had not the English made a present of four guns to Mubarak, the latter would not have been able to capture Boreida, which is a strong position and considered in Arabia to be invincible. *r V 2 It is often that Mubarak has not to pay for these arms and ammunition, because if he had to do so, he would soon be reduced to poverty. A short time * after this the English sent him a lakh of rupees. The Arab rebels cannot find a better help. You may remember that Sheikh Sa’dun bin Mansur, the Sheikh of the Muttafik tribe, attacked a detach ment of Turkish troops in December last, and then raided the suburbs of Basrah. When he feared retribution he took refuge at Koweit, and remained under the protection of English guns. After a few months he returned to his place, but did not remain at peace. He plundered a Turkish Kafila, and nothin^ was done to him. He is now residing in quiet and without any anxiety 5 The English have only one line of policy in this country, i.e., to incite the rulers to oppress the people, and then to offer aid to the oppressed people and gain their hearts. It were the English who pressed the Turkish Government to deal severely with Mubarak bin Sabah, to secure peace to the country the commerce, and the Turkish and the English subjects. When the Sublime Porte acted in accordance with the advice given by the English and began to bring pressure on Sheikh Mubarak, then they offered to protect Mubarak from the danger, and the latter with his tribesmen placed himself under the British protection. I warn the high officials of the Sublime Government in a loud voice to be careful about the intrigues of the English in Irak, because they are now cast- uig greedy eyes upon that fertile land watered by two streams Irak excels Egypt in fertility ; and he who possesses this land gets hold of all commerce of the east from Anatolm, Arabia, India, the shores of China, Aghanistan Tibet Khiva, Burma, and Siam. ’ ’ The scheme of the English is greater than what you suppose and dream. If you allow things to go on as before, you will see tomorrow that this youns man, Ibn-i-Saood, will become more important than necessary, and more serious than you think. Then make use of artifice and not force, and seek aid of the trench and Russians, in order to defend yourselves against this aggression- nothing else will prevent thmr intrigues. The first step has been taken bv them, but you shcmld prevent them from taking the second, before it could be said, the rent has increased beyond the ability of the mender.” 5th October 1904: A.

B., dated 27th ultimo, for an expression of opinion as to its authorship. 2. I have no doubt that Monsieur Goguyer is responsible for the contents of the extract. My reasons for forming this opinion are :— (1) He possesses a knowledge of Koweit and Koweit affairs probably un equalled by any other non-official resident of Maskat. (2) The excessive anti-English bias which is noticeable in many of his former writings also appears in this article, and I know of no other person in Maskat who entertains such hatred of us. (3) The article clearly implies that arms are imported into Koweit by the English. Monsieur Goguyer knows well that the(apparent) inconsistency of publicly forbidding and privately encouraging the importation of arms by us would be thoroughly understood by the natives in the present circumstances, and the manner in which the ideas are expressed in this extract bears the stamp of his ingenious manipulation. (4) It is possible that the writer’s remarks concerning the conveyance of arms to Koweit by merchants in mail steamers are made in the hope of inducing action to be taken which will leave the Koweit field in possession of those who send their consignments in dhows, as Goguyer does, vide my letter No. 263, dated 2 4th May last. 3. A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the secretary to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. No. 588, dated Maskat, the 6th (received 14th) December 1904 (Confidential). From— Major W. G. Grey, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat. To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to place before you briefly the position of affairs in Maskat as regards the arms trade. I beg to invite a reference to paragraph 3 of secret despatch No. 46, dated 6th March 1902, from the Government of India to the Secretary of State, and to ask whether it would not be possible to make another effort for the abolition of arms trade in Oman. My French colleague informed me recently that his Government had no intention of expelling Goguyer from Maskat, and the Sultan meanwhile makes the best of a bad job by being friendly with his old enemy. On the other hand, Goguyer, while he has apparently desisted from writing against His Highness (possibly in accordance with instructions received, vide the enclosure to my letter No. 302 * Secret E., September 1904, ^ a ted 28th June last), has by no means ceased his unfair and hostile criticism of our policy in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. His expulsion from Maskat would therefore appear to be more than ever desirable from our point of view. 4. However, the point to which I desire to invite attention at present is that no half-way position on our part is advisable as regards the arms trade in the present circumstances. Either we must move for its abolition, or we must, by supporting our merchants, render the presence of foreigners in Maskat as innocuous as possible to our commercial prospects generally. Were the latter course adopted, it might be possible not only to retain control over the traffic, but, eventually, to effect the removal of certain foreigners without the employment of compulsion. * No. 235 Nos. 229-238 .Jr ' £ 'll I Ji » i 1 ' ■, / I &gt; m \[Confidential.] ■ - ■ r ' Cj^ I Wi / * tjvl! ’.' v t: / N '■. /. /. \ \ ,n 5 v yS'/ v _-&lt;&lt; * / DEP^' No. 184, dated Bushire the 23rd April (received 1st May) 1905.

FRASER, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary,te the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. 1 have the honour to refer you to Foreign Department letter No. sgiS-E.A., dated 7th Septmber 1904, on the subject of the duties of the new Political Agent at Koweit. 2. In paragraph 5 thereof the Government of India expressed their desire to be furnished with information regarding the Trade in Arms with Koweit, and 1 now have the honour to forward for information a copy of a recent report wh;ch I have received from Captain Knox on the subject. 3. When I have at any time received special intimation from M a skat or elsewhere of the consignment of arms to Koweit, I have asked the Political Agent to apprise Sheikh Mubarak of it ; and I have also reminded the British India Steam Navigation Company of the prohibition which exists against the importation of arms into that port. In view however of the somewhat delicate position in which our Represen tative at Koweit has been placed at first starting, and to the fact that had he shewn any disposition to worry Sheikh Mubarak about this or any other matter, the latter would probably have regarded his presence as a doubtful advantage, and would probably have made things unpleasant for him, it seemed advisable to limit our action to the extent above mentioned, and pending any special instruc tions which the Government of India see fit to communicate to me on the subject I shall not take any more decided a line so far as Koweit is concerned. I understand, moreover, that an investigation of the Arms Traffic in the Gulf has formed an item of Mr. J. G. Lorimer’s work for the Gazetteer, and on receipt of his report the Government of India will be in a position to take the whole question in review as it exists at the present moment.

Khamis Effendi, regarding whom referenced were made to you in connection with Banias trading with Katif, mentioned in the course of his conversation that a Koweit friend of his who stayed with him at Ojair when on his way to A1 Hassa told him that the Frenchman who is now at Koweit asked Sheikh Mubarek to give him the monopoly of the arms trade at Koweit on the condition of his paying that Chief a royalty of 10 % on his intended importation of 12,000 rifles monthly, and if that proposition was not acceptable he was prepared to sell that number of rifles to the Sheikh monthly at the rate of 30 Austrian dollars each, the price at which such arms are being soldsold &amp;t Muscet; that the Frenchman wanted to buy a house in Koweit for the purposes of his business but the Chief refused to permit his purchasing a house in Koweit and gave him quarters free of rent; that Sheikh Mubarek called the merchants interested in the trade before him and informed them of the offers of the Frenchman and consulted them as to whether his terms should be accepted, and the merchants told the Chief that the tax of 3 Austrian dollras per rifle paid to him 'by them was equivalent to the 10 % royalty on the original price and advised him not to give the trade to the Frenchman; and that it was not definitely known, when his friend left Foweit, what SheiMi Mubarak intended to do finally regarding the onestion IThamis Effendi further mentioned that a fair number of rifles are imported into A1 Bidda and Ojair in sailing oraft, that the price of a rifle with one hundred cartridges was 35 Austrian dollars at A1 Hassa and 40 Austrian dollars at Koweit; and that his Eoweit friend was one of the merc^-nts engaged in the arms business y owe it. Mohamed bin Merzook. I understand, is a Busreh trader and arrived here on the 19th instant with some of his goods in a baggalow from Busreh.

He also said that about a month ago he received a letter from Monsieur Goguyer to the effect that he proposed going to Busreh after Haji Ali A1 Thahaba 1 s return from Muscat, The foregoing information has been confirmed by Mohamed bin At tick who arrived here last Thursday from A1 Hassa en route for Busreh to join hi# master Seyed Talib Pasha. He called at the Agency yesterday and mentioned that the Frenchman proposes getting the arms taken direct to Koweit by a steamer, but this I can hardly believe as it would be too open an infringement of Sheikh Mubarek’s prohibition of the importation of arms into Koweit territoryRegister No. Minute Paper. 22d(] SECRET DEPARTMENT.

WITH reference to my telegram NW70 of the 26th ultimo, respecting fighting in Arabia, I have the honour to report that I have received a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bagdad, replying to my inquiry as to whether the capture of Riadh by Ibn Saoud was correctly reported, and whether it was not meant that Ibn Saoud had taken Hail. Major Newmarch states that he cannot learn whether Hail had been captured, but that Ibn Saoud was in its vicinity; he had certainly taken Aney za. 'With reference to my telegram No. 77 of the 29th ultimo, I have received a telegram from Mr. Consul Crow, dated Bussorah, the 2nd May, stating that he is informed that the Turkish authorities will send on the Nejd expedition one battery of artillery and six battalions of infantry from the Bussorah and Bagdad Vilayets. Large numbers of camels have been seized by the Amir for transport, and contracts had been made for six months’ supplies. Mr. Crow also hears that the Sheikh of Koweit is in constant communication with Ibn Saoud, and that the latter had taken Boreyda and Aneyza. He adds that the Sheikh may be obliged, by identity of interests, to lend assistance, or the support of his tribes may be withdrawn from him. A telegram from Bagdad from Major Newmarch, dated the 2nd May, states that 400 infantry, 160 artillery men with 2 field pieces, 4 mountain guns, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition had left, or were just leaving, for Samawa, and that these would be followed by a further contingent of 800 infantry.

(4) From the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 69, dated the 11th March 1904. 2. The strict criticism to which our proceedings of 1898, in the case of the S. S. “ Baluchistan ”, were subsequently subjected in British Courts of Law, and the claims which have been advanced by the German Government in con nection with that seizure, indicate the necessity of omitting no precaution to ensure the technical correctness of our action, and in considering the esent reports we have examined the question of our rights in seizing and con fiscating arms in the territorial waters of Maskat. The power of confiscation CoF , fo L, e a Secret deepatc N o. se (E^), conferred by the Sultan’s pro- the sth July iyoo. clamation of the 13th January 1898 relates only to arms and ammunition which are intended for Indian or Persian ports, and which are also the property of British, Persian, or Maskat suhiects and we thus have no special rights in the case of arms consigned to a port in other territory, such as Koweit, or where the warlike munitions are the property of a subject of any Power not mentioned in the proclamation, 3 In -view of the agreements for the prohibition of traffic in arms and ammunition which we hold from the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein and from the Trucial Chiefs, and having regard to the opinion expressed by Sir Nicolas O'Conor in his despatch to Lord Lansdowne, No. 753, dated the 16th November 1903 that for the purposes of the present case we might treat as illegal the introduction of arms into any part of the Ottoman dominions, we thmk it advisable that the terms of the Maskat proclamation of 1898 should be revised by substituting for the words “ Indian or Persian ports ” the phrase “ Indian, Persian, or Turkish ports, or for the territories of the Sheikh of Bahrein, pk; ) ,, ♦'i ■ v r ( : ythe Sheikh of Koweit, or of the Trucial Chiefs ”, and, further, that the words “ and if they are the property of British, Persian, or Maskat subjects ” should he omitted. 4. The wording of the Sultan’s proclamation of 1898 follows the phraseo logy of the instructions of His Majesty’s Government conveyed in Lord George Hamilton’s telegram, dated the 21st December 1897, and it would, therefore, be necessary in any case to refer the matter for your orders before addressing the Sultan of Maskat on the subject. Since we propose the addition of the words “ Turkish ports”, it will, no doubt, also be desirable to refer to Sir Nicolas O’Conor. 5. There is, however, another and most important aspect of the case. Even if our powers of search in Maskat territorial waters can be enlarged in the manner suggested, there will still be the difficulty that boats carrying arms may clear from Maskat for ports in the territories of the Sultan of Maskat, where the traffic is not prohibited, and thence sail for Koweit, or some other port, as appears to have been the case in the present instance. This wil7 necessitate the adoption of measures for searching arrivals in Koweit itself. Sheikh MubarCtk, in conversation with Colonel Kemball, has recognised our right to do this under the proclamation of 24th May 1900, but obviously a seizure of arms in Koweit harbour by a British ship acting under the authority of the arrangement with the Sheikh would almost certainly, if the vessel carrying the arms were a foreign ship or even a British steamer, raise the whole question of the status of the Sheikh. In the present case we were compelled by the urgency of the matter to authorise Colonel Kemball to search for the arms said to have been sent to Koweit, but, before directing our officers to take such action generally, we desire, in accordance with the instructions contained in the telegram of 11th August 1900 from your predecessor, to refer the matter for the opinion of His Majesty’s Government as to the course which it is advisable to adopt. The present position of affairs in which Mons. Goguyer apparently intends to establish a branch of his business at Koweit, which seems likely to become an entrep6t for the arms trade, is eminently unsatisfactory. In view of recent declarations on the subject of the status of Koweit, His Majesty’s Government may possibly be willing now to authorise seizures of arms under the proclamation. If, however, it is held to be undesirable to assert our predominant interests so openly, perhaps the Turkish Government, who are vitally interested in checking the trade in arms in Northern Arabia, may agree to our searching all vessels in Koweit waters without prejudice to the question of the authority under which the right is exercised, or to our exercising such a right of search in Turkish territorial waters in the Persian Gulf outside the Shatt-el-Arab without referring specially to Koweit. Some such arrangement would probably make our position in the matter secure against all objectors. 6. We are advised that it would not be necessary to make over arms seized in territorial waters of an Arab Chief under our sole protectorate to the Chief, so that the difficulties anticipated by Colonel Kemball would not neces sarily arise. Arrangements are in progress for opening a British Post Office at Koweit in charge of an Indian Assistant Surgeon, and, as soon as this has been done, we propose to dispense with the services of our present Agent. As long as Mons. Goguyer remains at Koweit, it will be necessary to arrange for frequent visits of a Political Officer and ships of war to that place, and it may be hopedw 7) that these overt signs of our interest in his proceedings will induce Sheikh Mubarak to adopt a more satisfactory attitude on the subject of this arms traffic than he did on the occasion of his last interview with Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball. The attention of Major Cox, who will shortly succeed Lieutenant- Colonel Kemball on the departure of the latter on leave, null be specially drawn to the necessity for consolidating our influence at Koweit.

From- Luutwant-Colonel C. A. Kembai.i., C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. \ I have the honour to invite a reference to my confidential telegram dated 28th ultimo in which I reported that the Political Agent at Maskat had informed me that the British India Steam Navigation Company s » teaD f' Chindwara had sailed from Maskat on the 26th idem with 400 rifles for Koweit. , 2 I despa tolled the Lawrence to Koweit with my Pirst Assistant, whom I directed to see Sheikh Mubarak and call upon him to take the necessary action with regard to this consignment. Captain Hunt saw the sheikh who was at Jehara. He said he had no knowledge about the C0 ” s 'S“™™ t d arms, but promised to seize and confiscate them should they be landed a let me know the result of his action. tt iv/r q 3. The Chindwara arrived in Bushire on the 3rd February, H. M. b. La mein q having arrived in the harbour a day or two before, but alter the Lawrence had left for Koweit. I discussed the matter with Captain OWham and we decided that, before he left for Koweit, it would he as well that he should find out the exact facts of the case from the Captain of the Captain Oldham, prior to his departure for Koweit on the 3rd went on o the Chindwara and saw the Captain, who told him that dl ^ly Capta j had left the ship atMaskat, 14 cases were -bundled over «de and severa^ of the passengers left as scon as they ^^VhTIn discovered A^letter,* * No, 54, dated the 3ist January 1904. • j received subsequently from rnutain Grev copy of which is attached, confirms this information. Captain Oldham intended to he at Koweit when the Chindwara arrived there, and le pSd tortort to me from Basra, where he intended Jo pruce^snbse- quently, whether any arms were landed at Koweit and what actl ”' t h ®&gt; h took with regard to them. I have, however, not yet heard from him on subiect and it seems probable that the consignment regarding which mforma- thn was sent to me by the Political Agent at Maskat was not taken to ^Bv last mail I received information from the Political Agent at Maskat that two dhows had left Maskat with 588 Martini rifles and 81,000 rounds ot Immnnition Passes had been issued by the Sultan for these arms authorizing their'despatch to Sohar, but the real _ destination of the d.ows wasCapa.n Grey reported, Koweit. A proportion of the arms belonged to Monsi Goguyer’s agent. On receiving this information, I wrote both to Sheikh Mubarak and toon Native Aeent at Koweit, and directed the latter to let me know if tbe dhows referred to arrived in Koweit and what their cargo was ^MuSak’s of. I fear, however, that our present agent is to a great extent in Mubarak hands, and I doubt if I shall get a true report from him if the dhows a really bound for Koweit and land their cargo there. 5 With regard to the consignment on hoard the Chindwara it seems to me to be an extraordinary thing that a passenger is allowed by the Cumiany to nut on hoard, secretly, several large boxes with the apparent consent of the Captain of the ship. The cases were presumably part of the passengers private effects, and it must surely he against the Company’s rules to allow boxes of this nature to be shipped as passengers’ personal effects, I believe it is the cafe ’ a * ^malTquantities'of rifles are It frequently carried by bundles apd that the Ccrrpany’s &lt; fficers profess their inability to take any stens to prevent this. I feel inclined to doubt if arms can in this way be smuggled into Persian ports, hut they probably find no difficulty m passing intoRihrein and Koweit. It is, of course, hardly to he expected that the Com pany’s officers should inspect the ordinary personal baggage ot passengers , but ; if rI 2 I think that they are bound to take reasonable precautions to prevent lar^e consignments of arms, which are prohibited articles now at all the Persian Gulf ports, bemg put on board their ships. Supposing that Persian Customs House omeials had made a search of the Chindwara while she was in a Persian port and had found the arms alluded to above on board, the British India Company could hardly, it seems to me, have escaped responsibility had the Customs Administration proceeded against the Company for bringing a prohibited article into a Persian port. ^ i 6 Vw°r sie 1 Ur ?° gUyer is 8ti11 ’ 1 belie7e ’ atKoweit, and it is highly pro bable that his business there is connected with the traffic in arms. I strongly suspect that he has some understanding with Sheikh Mubarak on the sublet I he Sheikh has more than once told me that he does not allow arms to be brought into Koweit, but I am not inclined to trust him in this matter.

Kmbau, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In amplification of the telegrams which have passed between us this week on the subject of arms on board the S. S. Chindwara I have the honour to explain as follows :— ^ At about 4 p.m. on the 26th instant I received information that M Goguyers native agent had embarked 400 rifles, etc, and intended to take them to Koweit. I proceeded on board at once and found some large boxes in the man s possession of which the keys were not forthcoming. °At first I t mught of breaking them open, but, eventually after discussion with the Captain, returned to the shore without further action and telegraphed to vou embarked. 6 armS be Se0Ured at Koweit P ri ° r to being dis- Suhsequentiy I heard that some of the arms had been re-landed before the vessel left, but on this pomt I am unable to give a definite assurance.

In continuation of my letter No. 39, dated the 19th instant, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of the report which I was expecting from the Commander of H.M.S.

To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A.

The next day I sent ashore to ascertain the result of this procedure, and was informed that no rifles or arms of any description were landed from the Chindwara. 3. It is evident that the persons who attempted to run these rifles took alarm on the Consul of Maskat visiting the ship, and the 14 cases (mentioned in a private letter to you) which were bundled over the side, just after he left, were in all probability the consignment intended for Koweit. 4539 P. JD. Exd.-L. G. GNo. 62, dated Bushire, the 4th March 1904 (Confidential). F roai — Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram, dated the 21 st ultimo, and to report that as directed therein I proceeded to Koweit, where I had an interview with. Sheikh Mubarek on the subject of the importa tion of arms into Koweit. 2. Before I landed from the Lawrence, I sent for our news agent and questioned him about the two dhows referred to in paragraph 4 of my letter No. 39, dated the 19th February 1904. The Agent informed me that these dhows had arrived at Koweit, and that he had, in compliance with my directions, made careful enquiries as to whether they had any arms on board. He was satisfied, he said, that no arms were landed from them at Koweit 3. I then proceeded on shore and had a long interview with Sneikh Mubarek. I informed him that I had received reliable information that arms and ammunition were being brought to Koweit. He denied that such was the case, and said that he would not allow arms to he brought in. I then referred to the question of the dhows, regarding which the Sheikh had sent a reply to me to the effect that he knew nothing about them or their Nakhodas. He to j d J* 1 ® that the dhows in question had arrived, that they were Koweit dhows, and that it was quite impossible that any subjects of his would dare to bring arms into Koweit. I informed him that my information was reliable that these dhows had taken arms on board at Maskat, and that as it had not been shown that had called at any other place between Maskat and Koweit, the reasonable presumption was that they had brought the arms to Koweit. It was useless therefore for the Sheikh to tell me that it was the custom of dhows to bring arms from Maskat and land them at Persian ports, such as Hmdiyan and Mashur, and even on the Turkish side of the river (which they did, he said, in collusion with the Turkish guards). These dhows had come to Koweit and must have had the arms on hoard. The Sheikh ought therefore to have seized and confiscated the arms in accordance with his agreement with us. The Sheikh’s manner was not at all satisfactory while we were on the subject of these dhows. He frequently turned the conversation from the point, asking, among other things why we did not put a stop to arms coming into Maskat. I then refer red to the subject of Goguyer. I told the Chief that the man was an intriguer and was well known to be a mischievous character. He was moreover a notorious dealer in arms, and the fact of his living in Koweit was in itself sufficient to give colour to the suspicion that the traffic in arms at Koweit was being carried on. The Sheikh was reticent about Goguyer. He said that, so far as he knew, the man was there merely for purposes of legitimate trade, and that if he found that he had anything to do with the trade in arms he would not let him remain there. He did not tell me, as I understand is the case, that Goguyer is on intimate terms with him and is practically his guest. There was not much more to be said on the subject, but I reminded the Sheikh again of the agreement which he had made in 1900, and I said that it was a matter of great regret to me to think that the Sheikh was not sincere in carry- in 0 * out the promise then made by him. I reminded him that he had empowered British ships of war to search vessels in his territorial waters, and that we saw no objection to the exercise of this right in case of reasonable suspicion. The Sheikh agreed that there was no objection. Finally, I pointed out to him, that he was making requests for favours from His Majesty’s Gov ernment, and that he could hardly expect the Government to meet his wishes if it was believed that he was not acting honourably in the matter of agree ments which he had entered into with the Government, 4 . Recent information which has reached^ me, leaves little room for doubt that arms are being brought to Koweit. There is the case of the Ohindwara, referred to in my previous letter on the subject: there is also the case of the two dhows above referred to, which I cannot but believe did land arms at Koweit; and there is the [fact of Goguyer’s residence at Koweit which would seem to be fairly conclusive proof. The S.S. Gulistan, 4467 F. D.regarding ^jch I telegrapbed to you on the 18th February, left Bushire for Basrah on the 26th February, but did not go to Koweit. It is possible that she will call there on her return journey. It is difficult to say what can be done to put a stop to this traffic, if Sheikh Mubarek will not act un to hi! agreement with us. It is true that the Sheikh has empowered British shinAf war to search vessels suspected of carrying arms, within Koweit territorial waters, and I understand that there would be no objection to the confiscation of any arms, which might thus be discovered, for the benefit of His Maiestv^ Government or of the British ship of war. I am doubtful, however Aether such seizure and confiscation by us of a carjo belonging to a subject of a Foreign European Power might not give rise to difficulties. It is possible, too that Goguyer may arrange for his consignments to be brought to him at koweit bv one of the Russian merchant ships plying to the Gulf. In such a case even supposing the search were permissible on the authority delegated to us b’v the Sheikh, we could not, I believe, retain the arms which would have to be mlde tbs? tb° ^ e ., c . 0l ; fiscati “g authority, that is to say the Sheikh, and if it is true that the Sheikh is conniving in the traffic nothing would be gained bv such action. In order to control the traffic by native craft we should have to keen a ship of war constantly at Koweit, and even then it would, I believe be difficult for one ship to deal effectively with this traffic. ’ «b -ifi d ® ali “S UDder present circumstances with a person in the position of Sheikh Mubarek ,t must, I think, be remembered that we have lUtle or no power of holding him to an agreement of the nature of that which he made with us for the prohibition of the arms traffic. It will of comse l!' ™n 6 understood that the traffic, if it exists, is a source of profit to the Sheikh who If tbe^b ■7r ld n0t ai °' U t0 00lltiaue unless it brought in revenue to him If the Sheikh were m receipt of an allowance from His Maiestv’s Gnvpmmor,** pressure might be put upon him when it was found that he had broken the agreement by withholding the allowance.

My Lord, We Lave the honour to forward, for the information and orders Her Maiesty’s Government, copies of the papers noted in the enclosed list, regarding an agreement which has been concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit, where he has undertaken to prohibit absolutely the importation and exportation arms into and from Koweit territory. , 2 In order to explain the immediate cause of our action m concluding this agreement, we may refer to the correspondence ending with Your Lord- ship’s telegram, dated the llth October 1899, regarding the seizure of certain arms and ammunition, the property of Messrs. Fracis, Times o., y Sheikh of Bahrein. We recently learnt from our Political Resident m the Persian Gulf that the Sheikh of Bahrein desired to restore to Messrs. Pracis, Times &amp; Co. their property, which had been confiscated by his orders. Acting on the views indicated by Your Lordship in the telegram above quoted anu m previous correspondence, we did not question the authori y o le dispose of these arms and ammunition at his discretion, though we instructed our* Political Resident to advise the Sheikh that the restoration of the goods to Messrs. Pracis, Times &amp; Co. should be made subject to the condition that the arms and ammunition are not sold in Bahrein, El Katr or on the Arabian tne arms anu a Coast—a condition which, as Your Lord- £;;,L of o f L £“' no! 20 ship is aware,* was attached to the original (Secret-Consular), dated the 28th Novemher 1898. concession granted by the 01161X11 10 HIS Vazir and handed on to Agha Muhammad Rahim and by him to Messrs. Pracis Times &amp; Co. In soliciting our instructions regarding the restoration of the arms, Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball expressed his apprehensions that Messrs. Pracis Times &amp; Co., if the arms and ammunition were restored to them, would probably endeavour to dispose of them at Koweit and it was uith a view to frustrate this that we took active steps to secure the conclusion of the agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit, of which we now forward a copy. We now hear that the Sheikh of Bahrein has carried out his intention, and has restored the arms and ammunition to Messrs. Pracis, Times &amp; Co. on the con i- tion above named.2 3. We trust that our proceedings will meet with the approval of Her Majesty’s Government, and that we may be favoured with early instructions as to the measures to be adopted, should occasion arise for utilising the permission which has been accorded by the Sheikh of Koweit, to search Koweit vessels suspected of carrying arms within Koweit, Indian or Persian waters, and to /^\ confiscate any arms and ammunition found in such vessels. We have informed ^ Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball that no action should be taken in the way of search or seizure of Koweit vessels, whether in Koweit territorial waters or in Indian or Persian waters, unless or until instructions are received from Your Lordship.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence on the subject of the enquiry by the Sheikh of Bahrein into the matter of the confisca tion at Bahrein of the arms and ammunition belonging to Messrs. Eracis Times. 2 . Mr. Eracis, a representative of the firm, is now at Bahrein, awaiting this enquiry, hut it is evident from recent reports addressed to me by Mr. Gaskin, the Assistant to the Resident at Bahrein, that the Chief has no inten tion of holding any enquiry as to whether the concession granted by him for the importation of arms into Bahrein had been infringed. He now withdraws this contention, and maintains that the arms were seized at the instance of Agha Muhammad Rahim, who is now dead, and has, he says, no representative at' Bahrein who could proceed with the case, and he wishes to restore the arms to Messrs. Eracis Times. He has informed Air. Eracis, through the Assistant Resident, that he is at liberty to leave Bahrein whenever he may wish to do so. It, however, appears from Mr. Gaskin’s latest report, dated 22nd instant, that Air Eracis has now requested the Chief of Bahrein to hold an enquiry regarding the alleged theft of arms from the godown of the firm prior to the seizure, and that the Chief has consented to do so. 3 . I would solicit the orders of the Government of India regarding the advisabilitv of allowing the Chief of Bahrein to restore the arms to Alessrs. Eracis Times. Her Alajesty’s Government having adopted the view that the Sheikh of Bahrein “ as a Sovereign Ruler so far as his internal administration is concerned” was authorised to seize the arms, I do not see how he can be prevented from restoring them should he wish to do so. It does not seem to me to be clear what was the real motive which the Chief had when he ordered the sequestration of the arms, and at any rate, as a Sovereign Chief, he had just as much right to seize the arms at the request of a merchant trading at Bahrein, as°because the terms of the concession, which he had granted, were alleged to have been broken. It will be seen that Colonel Aleade, in the concluding paragraph of his memorandum on the subject, forwarded with his letter No. 69, dated 21st November 1898, to your address, made the suggestion that the arms should be delivered over to the firm on certain conditions, and so far as I can see there is no objection to this course being taken. On grounds of public policy, it would seem that we have the right to insist that the Chief, if he surrenders the arms, should see that they are taken out of his territory and similarly, the coast of Persia being closed to the trade in arms, we have the right to insist that the arms, if surrendered to Messrs. Eracis Times, should be taken by them out of the Gulf.2 4. The question is a complicated one, but, as I understand it, the policy which has been followed is that Government accepts no responsibility for the action of the Chief of Bahrein in seizing these arms. The Chief had the arms seized of his own initiative, and he has now to decide as to their disposal, although, in the event of the Chief deciding to restore the arms to Messrs. ^ Fracis Times, the Government of India would claim to have an interest in this t question of their ultimate disposal. Should Messrs. Fracis Times subsequently make an appeal to this Residency on account of any alleged injury done to them by the action of the Chief, they can state their case, which will then he enquired into and decided on its merits. Enclosure No. 3. Please see my letter of 29th April, No. 111. It is probable, if arms are handed over to Fracis, he will endeavour to dispose of them at Koweit, if they are fit for sale after long detention at Bahrein. Some arrangement with Chief of Koweit regarding importation of arms seems very desirable, and I propose to send Gaskin therein “ Lawrence’’ to enquire into trade in arms there. I believe Chief makes considerable profit by trade and conclusion of agreement with him presents difficulties. Is there any objection to sending Gaskin ?

It seems best that Gaskin should remain at Bahrein, but you may proceed yourself or send Davis to Koweit, and endeavour to arrange agreement with Sheikh forthwith Bahrein Chief can, at his discretion, restore arms to Fracis Times, but should be advised only to do so, subject to condition that the arms are not sold in Bahrein Katr or on Arab Coast. If there is reasonable prospect of early agreement with Koweit Sheikh, restoration of arms to Fracis Times might conveniently be postponed pending its conclusion. ^ Enclosure No. 5.

Agreement by Sheikh Mubarek-bin-Sabah, Chief of Koweit. I agree to absolutely prohibit the import ation of arms into Koweit or exportation therefrom, and to enforce this I have issued a notification and proclamation to all concerned. Notification by Sheikh Mubarek-bin-Sabah, Chief of Koweit. . Be it known to all who see this that, whereas it has become known to us that the traffic in arms in British India and Persia is prohibited, we have, therefore, decided to do all that lies in our power to assist the British and Persian Governments in putting a stop to this illegal traffic, and we hereby declare that from the date of this notification the import ation of arms and ammunition into Koweit and the territory under my control and the export ation of the same are absolutely prohibited. All arms and ammunition imported into any parts of Koweit territory or exported therefrom in future will he seized and confiscated. Fiom— Captain C. A. Kemball, Offg.

Be it known to all who see this that British and Bersisn vessels of war have per mission to search vessels carrying their and our flags in Koweit territorial waters, and to confiscate all arms and ammunition in them if these arms and ammunition are intended for Indian or Persian or Koweit ports. Koweit vessels found in Indian and Persian waters by British and Persian vessels of war suspected to contain arms and ammunition for Indian, Persian and Koweit ports are liable to be searched by the said vessels, and all such arms and ammunition found in them will he con fiscated.

Kemball, Officiating- Political Resident in the Persian Gulf To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to report that, in accordance with your instructions I visited Koweit on the 24th instant, and at an interview with Sheikh Mubarek Chief of Koweit, I explained to him the desirability of his putting a stop to the traffic in arms within his territories. The Chief informed me that up to the present the importation of arms into Koweit had not been carried on to any great extent, and that he had already taken steps to prevent the con tinuance of the trade, as he himself saw the advisability of putting a stop to it in his own interests. r He readily agreed to sign an agreement, prohibiting the importation and exportation of arms so far as Koweit territory is concerned. Copies of this agreement and of the notifications signed by the Chief have been forwarded to you under separate cover. 2. Whether the arms trade in Koweit is in reality more extensive than the Chief gave me to understand I was not able to ascertain. It is possible that the Chief himself does not know the extent to which it is beino* carried on, though, when I suggested to him this possibility, he refused to entertain it. feo far as I was able to judge, the Chief intends to abide loyally by his agree ment, and in any case the agreement cannot but have a good effect, as 3 * * &amp; the dealers in arms at Maskat and elsewhere will now know that the trade is pro- hibited so far as Koweit is concerned, and that it will, if pursued, be attended 3. I thought it advisable to obtain the Chief’s consent to the issue of the proclamation, authorising British and Persian vessels of war to search vessels c airy mg British, Persian or Koweit flags in Koweit territorial waters. In tins connection, however, it has to be considered that Koweit vessels flv the Turkish flag, and although I presume that there would be no objection to British or Persian vessels of war searching vessels under the Turkish flag- in Indian and Persian waters, the search of vessels carrying the Turkish flao’ within Koweit waters by our ships might prove a source of embarrassment if °it cameto the knowledge of the Turkish authorities. I have, therefore, taken no steps to make this proclamation known, and I shall he glad to know the views of the Government of India on this point. I have, however, informed the Political Agent, Maskat, that the Chief of Koweit has prohibited the import of arms into 'Koweit territory. 4. During my interview with the Chief, he evinced a most friendly attitude and professed his desire to serve the British Government in any way he could. He informed me that all was quiet in Koweit and the neighbouring country, and he appeared to have no cause for anxiety with regard to his own affairs. Enclosure No. 9.

In continuation of my letter No. Ill, dated 29th April last, I have the honour to report that the Chief of Bahrein has now restored to Messrs. Eracis, Times &amp; Co. the arms which he seized in Bahrein, belonging to that firm. Mr. Gaskin has informed me that Mr. Eracis has given the Chief a document by which he holds the Chief free of all responsibility in connection with the seizure, and he has forwarded to me the receipt given by Mr. Eracis to the Chief for the arms. I forward this document for your information. It is interesting in so far as it shows the line of action which the firm intends to take which is in all probability to bring an action against the British Government for damages, on the ground that the arms were seized by the Chief, in accord ance with the orders of this Residency. This matter has been fully disposed of in Colonel Meade’s report, forwarded with his letter No. 69, dated 21st November 1893, to your address. 2. It would appear from the language in which the receipt for the arms is couched that Messrs. Eracis, Times &amp; Co. hope to substantiate their claim against the British Government, on the ground that the Chief refused to restore the arms to them without an order from this Residency, and they apparently deduce from this an admission on our part that the seizure was made by the Chief acting under our orders. My letter to the firm, to which a reference is made in the receipt, is forwarded herewith for your information. It will be seen that this letter by no means admits any responsibility for the seizure, but is merely a reply to a letter from the firm, copy of which is also forwarded, in which they informed me that the Chief refused to deliver up the arms without my permission. Mr. Gaskin further informs me that Mr. Eracis is endeavour ing to dispose of the arms locally to traders who will endeavour to smuggle them across to Persia. The Chief made it a condition of their restoration that they should not be sold in Bahrein, Katr, or the Arab Coast. Received from Sheikh Isa-bin-Ali-al-Khalifah, the Chief of Bahrein, the undernoted arms and ammunition, all in more or less rusty and damaged con dition, restored to us by him, by order of Major C. A. Kemball, the Officiating Political Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gult^ conveyed m his letter No. 464 of 1900, dated 19th ultimo, addressed to us, which was demanded bv the Chief of Bahrein in his letters, dated the 15th Zilkada 1317—-ITt March last, and 27th Zilkada 13l7=29th March last, addressed respectively, to the Acting British Residency Agent, Hajee Abbas-bin-Euzzul, and to the Political Assistant to the Resident and Consul-General m the Persian Gull,I Mi . -rxs: \ / i iW. 6 in Bahrein, Mr. J.
