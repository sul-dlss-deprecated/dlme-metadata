After Compliments. Reference your letter No.150 dated the 21st May 1932 on the subject of the matter of the translated petition dated the 28th April 1933 from Maginmai LikufflG'&amp;Sj on which you wanted me to report, I most respectfully beg to give below my report in this connection*- Tt Maginmai Likumuas had some dealings with a slave named Sultan Al Habshi who was a slave of Thani bin Khalaf of Dibai. The slave absconded to Muscat and was granted a manumission certificate from there. He then returned to Sharjah and showed me the manumission certificate. I assured him that nobody will interfere with his freedom. He went to Dibai and remained there. Since the slave in question is known to the Arabs ana the Banias and others and used to deal with pearls secretly, he made transaction with Maginmai Dikumuas and mortgaged to him a godo wn which is not his property but belongs to one poor ^uan of Dibai. Sultan remained in Dibai forsome months at Dihai. Then he left for Bahrain. The Bania complained about the mortgage over which a long discussion took place between mt; and tne Shaikh of Dibai« In the end I referred the matter to the Hon f bie the Political Resident(Colonel Pridaux who visited the Oman Coast accompanied oy Major Daly. As soon as they arrived, uie Bania mentioned his case to them. Thereupon investigations were made in their presence and it was proved that the mortgaged gouown did * not belong to Sultan AlHabsni. They uecibed the case against Sultan^ - Sultan is at present at Bahrain. He has been working in the Gfaaus since few years and ne is known at Bahrain too.
