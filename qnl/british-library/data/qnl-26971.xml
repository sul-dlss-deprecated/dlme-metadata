LOONffIDBMTIAL. annual report economio ♦b*. The Chief feature of the economic situation in East Iran during the past six months has been the phanomenal rise in the prices of local products, which in the last two months has been «specially marked. This is partly due to the great increase in the rates of the octroi charged in all the larger towns, but much more to the financial policy of the Government which endeavours, with disastrous results, to control the whole country's economic life. Prices of such ordinary commodites as bread and firewood in Meshed sat are higher than they have ever been known to be before and there seems no likelihood that they V/w will drop again^ the near future. Elsewhere in East Iran similar conditions obtain. 2. Articles imported from abera abroad are also affected, but the chief reason for the continued increase of price in such cases is the almost complete stagnation of trade resulting from the exchange control. Merchants are unable to obtain foreign exchange with which to purchase fresh stocks and are consequently not content with moderate profits on the small stocks they hold. Tea, for instance, the wholesale price of which in Calcutta is Annas six (equivalent to about 2^ Rials a packet) is sold in Meshed at 15 to 16 Rials.axpacikai} 5 Rials of which represent the trader's profit and the balance the cost in India, the Indian excise, Iranian customs and monopoly taxes, freight, etcetera. Many Indian merchants are content to remain without doing any business in the hope that conditions will improve in the future. Trie foreign exchange control policy continues of course to dominate the situation, which is aggravated by the everWide parate note * fi&lt; vj&gt; widening gap between the official and unofficial values of the frial# In Hok Kundi the rate is at present 1050 Kials to 100 Rupees, as against the official «x rate of 603.50 Rials. In the face of these exchange difficulties, the withdrawal of the monopolies on carpets and saffron, which was in accordance with expeotations, and of that on Persian lamb, which was engineered by the merchants chiefly interes ted, has not had such a stinsulating effect on trade as might have been expected. 4. Perhaps the most significant of the modifications which have been made in the Governments financial policy is the passing at the end of August of a new law the effect of which will be to allow private traders who export aertain unmonopolised articles to import other articles of equivalent value instead of surrendering the foreign exchange, this may not be very important from i the point of view of trade with Europe but it is already giving a tremendous fillip to the trade with India, which is largely in the hands of petty merchants. The announce ment of tne new regulations caused an immediate rise in the prices of ail commodities affected and may lead to a considerable revival of trade by the land route to India, which in the meantime has practically ceased !o exist. (Against 70 lorries plying on the Zahidan-flokkundi route now a year ago there are/only 10 and these are usually unable to obtain full loads for both journeys.) 5. Trade with Europe generally speaking denotes trade with either Germany or Russia with which countries special agreements exist, though in the case of Germany a marked falling off has been noticeable lately. The Russian trade is fortheeming flourishing and Meshed shops are full of Russian piece goods.* British trade connections direct In with Meshed continue/a small way and Manchester piece goodsstill find their way into the market. That merchants atij.1 hope for better days is shown hy the fact that the firm of Wahaboff have recently opened a branch in London. Practically the only British article which continues in great demand is the bicycle, but owing to the great difficulty of obtaining foreign exchange stocks are almost exhausted and purchasers have to be content with inferior German or Japanese articles. These are sold at about 350 Kiais, whereas the British 'Hercules** bicycle, which when obtainable, costs mer chants 300 Kials at Zahidan, can be readily sold in Me shed for as much as 750. 6 . Tfae agricultural position is little better than last year. In southern Kharasan and the Kainat the wheat crop is poor and the unprecedentedly heavy rains early in September did a great deal of damage to stocks wUich had been left in the open. In Sistan prospects are better, but throughout the whole area the cultivators are reluctant to sell to the Government at the prices fixed. Strenuous effort* are being made to collect stocks for the winter months but grain is undoubtedly being hoarded in the villages and the outlook is uiotinctly i* gloomy. Another factor of local importance is the high prices prevailing in Afghanistan, resulting in a good deal of grain being rnmuggled across the border. The be.t sugar crop which the * Government arfWking strenuous efforts to improve in Khorasan is only a partial success and the Insistence by Government that land on which ri*e w a s formerly grown should this year be used for sugar beet has only resulted in a local shortage of rice which now has to be imported from Hesht and costs 100$ more than last year. Government's efforts to increase the area under cotton in i. k south have met with partial success in Sistan but iitgle in the rest of the iiukran provice. Cultivators do not see why when wheat is so hard to procure, they should be asked to grow a perfectly uneatable article such as cottons7. Government's failures in its financial and agricultural policies inevitably react on the industrial situation. Work on the Khoarovi Spinning and Weaving Mill at Meshed is almost entirely held up by the fact that some 150 cases of materials have been lying at Askabad, the Russian frontier post, for the last 8 months owing to the lack of foreign exhange. Demurrage amountiig to 14,000 Tomans is said to have been incurred on this consignment. The Sugar Factory at Meshed is still idle and it is believed that the sugar beet crop when ready will not be sufficient to keep it working for more than three months. The Meshed silk industry which had been brought to a standstill owing to the announcement that the Government of India were inaugurating a Bustoms barrier at Nok Kundi is now in process of being revived. The silk lungi business provides a good example of the peculiar conditions obtaining in trade at the present moment. The cost of a lungi in Meshed is Bials 7, equivalent to about Annas 17, and though the selling price in India is not more than Annas 15 the trade is brisk. The reason for this edrthat under the new regulations referred to above the trader can import into the countxy goods of the same value as the lungis he exports. As he can make a profit of 100% on his imports he is qui^e prepared to lose up to 50% on his exports. 8. Transport arrangements continue to be fairly satisfactory. Owing to the decrease of trade there is less traffic between Meshed and 2ahidan and conveyances on this route are not so readily available as formerly. On the other hand communications with Tehran have improved and, were it not for the deplorable standard of driving, which results in such frequent accidents^ in the hills, the general state of the transporting business would be distinctly /distinctly creditable. The Monopoly Transport Company after several vicissitudes has been finally abolished. The Khorasan branch is reported to have made a considerable profit during the last six months though this has been more than off-set by the large defalcations which have been discovered in the process of closing down the concern. 9. Considerable attention continues to be paid to the road systems of the country especially in the Mukran Province, and though in many places the road surfaces are execrable communications on the whole are much improved. Great activity has been displayed during the last three months in the Meshed Municipality and on the Shah's estate at Fariman, 50 miles away 3 on account of His Majesty's anticipated arrival. The only means by which officials can be galvanized into activity is the threat of a Royal visit. This has been duly forthcoming for the last three years but the visit itself has not yet materialised. Cynics say that His Majesty has no intention of coming to Meshed whatever. Be that as it may the roads have been vastly imporved; a fine new bathing pool has been constructed two miles outside the town; and a new building for the Chamber of Commerce has just been completed. In Fariman, a new hotel and offices are being hastily constructed and where it has not been possible yet to pull down and remove previously existing hovels high walls, to be duly whitewashed, are being hastily constructed in order to conceal all traces of the country's backwardness from the Royal vision. Good wages are nominally being offered for work at Fariman but no one shows any eagerness to earn them. Masons and labourers have therefore been carried off in large numbers to the estate. In fact most of the labour employed /employed is, inspite of Iran’s membership of the League of Nations, ^shat is known as 'begari' or oorvee. 10. The difficulties caused by the phenomenal rise in prices already mentioned are enhanced by the prevailing bribery and corruption which have reached a pitch undreamt of formerly even in Iran. Never before has it been so true that 'To him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath'. Government officials from the highest to the lowest have rarely known such wealth, if the possession of Rials can be considered as wealth. Some of the richer merchants also succeed in turning even present conditions to their own advantage. But the condition of the poor is appalling. Wages have indeed risen considerably but cannot keep pace with the rise in prices, and the villager who can normally exist on the produce of his lands now sees his stocks forcibly taken from him in exchange for money which is of little use to him. At the same time it must be admitted that Government are profiting by last years experience and doing their utmost to ensure that the famine conditions experienced last winter in the towns do not recur. Large quantities of grain axe being collected and stored and were it not for the scepticism engendered by the bungling which usually accompanies Government activities there would be no reason to anticipate anything more than the distress inseparable from high prices. 11. Insistence on European dress for both men and women is another cause of hardship and this is enhanced by the higji cost of all sorts of material. A decent woollen material may cost as much as 10 Tomans, equivalent to 25 shillings a yard. Materials manufactured in Iranian Mills though cheaper are of vary poor quality. In Meshed /wm Meshed the women undoubtedly dress much better than they did a year ago* But the unveiling order is still unpopular and many of the better cl^ilss women have not left their houses since it was enforced* These conditions apply of course only to the principal centres. Outside the towns and off the beaten track little attention is paid to the new dress regulations and both men and women go about in much the same garments as before. Road Guard officials who are temporarily hard up occasionally pay special visits to the villages and collect a few Tomans from the improperly clad inhabitants but no other steps are taken to enforce the law.Note on trade with Russia# -mmimmumtmwmwB Some account of the activities of the Monopoly Company dealing in skins, cotton, and wool (Shirkat i Sahami i Pust Pamba va Pashm) may be of interest. This company of the capital of which 7Qp» has been subscribed by Government and 30% by the public deals with the skins, cotton and wool which under the barter agreement with Russia entered into some 3 years ago have to be supplied at fixed rates, to that country. Skins . The rate at which Russia pays Iran for goat or sheep skins is Rials 500 approx: per 100 skins and the price at which the Company will buy is Rials 450. The price of skins in India is Rupees 170 or Rials 1020 per hundred. The result is that no one will sell to the Monopoly Company and other expedients have to be devised# Some flock owners cut the gqat hair and wool which curiously enough is not monopolised, sell it at the rate of 4i rials per skin and sell the skins themselves to tanners for rials eaoh* Others take advantage of the provision by which skins condemned as unfit for sale to Russia may be exported elsewhere to get all their skins condemned. An Indian trader recently sent 19000 skins to India by this method contracting to pay 40% of the cost price to the Company and himself netting 35% on the deal# Cotton # is principally utilised in the country and there is only a very small surplus for export to Russia. tool * The price now paid by Russia is 120 rials per pood and the company buy at 108 rials. Here again the price is insufficient# Germany is said to be prepared to pay as much as £60 Rials per pood# Private merchants are however prohibited from exporting and content themselves with buying up all the xtssl stocks they can secure at the current rate of 135-150 rials and either utilising them in the country or holding them until times are more favourable.p ' ' t'V'*'' »&lt;ru V .•5? *S&gt; *y (5) Endorsement from His Majesty’s Consul General for Khorasan, No. 76/5/ 4-A., DATED THE 1ST May 1937.

British Consulate-General for Khorasan, Meshed, the 4th May 1937. Dear Commercial Secretariat, Ve enclose for your information four copies of some notas on certain commercial aspects of the situation in East Iran. Some of this information was received too late for incorporation in the economic survey we have recently sent you and some seemed to be too detailed to be suitably incorporated in the survey, which in accordance with your instructions on the subject was written in more general terms. 2 . We hope that these notes which are being forwarded as suggested in your circular despatch No.5 of January 16th, 1937, will be of Interest. Yours ever, Consulate-General. The Commercial Secretariat, British Legation, Tehran.mmm SHBHHff Notes on certain commercial aspects of the situation in East Iran. )I. TRADE . (a) British ^..oods are conspicuous toy their absence in East Iran- Foreign exchange difficulties are largety |responsible for this. The Barter Agreement with Germaiy facilitates imports from that country. The Meshed /markets, which were fsrmerly stocked with Russian goods only, now contain a large proportion of German ! articles. German, and to a lesser extent Russian goods, are also rapidly finding their way eastward to the markets in Mekran and are taking the place of goods formerly imported via India. (b) The monopolisation of the motor car market is a source of great iaax inconvenience not only to dealers but also to the motor using public. Dealers, it is trjie, are allowed to trade on a 5% commission basis and do not have the endless difficulties experienced by other private traders in obtaining foreign exchange foi orders placed by them with the Monopoly Company. But the actual result in the provinces is that tyres and spares are almost unobtainable. Gar and lorry owners therefore have to send to Tehran; but there also they can only obtain their requirements from the Monopoly Company's salesmen by bribery which often costs them as much as 30;? of the price of the article purchased. The very few tyres obtainable locally cost as much as Rials 900 to 1,000 each as against the fixed price of Rials 620. The result has been a great increase in freight and passenger charges throughout the province. (c) The tea market has been very active during the year and traders made considerable rial profits on teaI ow ing to the increased monopoly charges and Customs charges, and to the general rise in orice in Iran. iu-ls 06 m ted many tea importers to obtain per~ j mission to import more tea into Iran than they could safely finance. The result has been thaii their ciedit resources have been, and are even ■ at the close of the year, undergoing a severe i strain. II . ff INA.NCIAT, . The exchange regulations, formation of mono poly companies and the recent policy of restric ting credit has caused money to become very tight, particularly in the past two months. This has been accentuated by the locking up of caoltal for long periods in goods in Customs awaiting per mission to clear and the demand of the Iranian Government from applicants for foreign exchange for additional rial deposits which have then been held up for several months. Public confi dence in the future of the rial is at a low ebb and there is a marked desire to convert it into foreign currency. The bank rate has risen to 9/5 while the bazaar rate In Meshed has been as high as 18$. HI- AGRI GUI .TURK . (a) Cotton . Khorasan is the leading cotton producing district in Iran. Three species of cotton are grown, Filestani, American and local. Up to last year the crop was mainly from local seed but as the demand for this is limited seeds of other varieties were supplied to cultivators by the Shirkat-i-Panbeh, Pashm wa Poost. In order to assist farmers two advances were madeV by the Shirtcat during the current year and all crops are being taken ovei by them. Cotton is in demand for both local and foreign markets. Large deliveries of cotton are mode to the Russians each year at Hoodan under the Russi'o-Iran Trade Agreement. With a view to increasing the crop and improving the condition of cultivators it has been decided to prohibit the growing of local seed cotton in future. The Shirkat is arranging to provide farmers with Pilestani and .American seeds. (b) Live stock . Large flocks of sheep and goats are kept in the Khorasan Province and the demand for wool, soft wool and goat hair, sheep and lamb skins, has been very satisfactory during the oast two years. In 1313 the number of sheep and goats were estimated at 1,900,000 and 450,000 respective ly. The main increase is in Gharakol sheeo as there has been an excellent and steady demand ! for these skins in the London and Hamburgh mar- j kets. Gharakol skins exported from Khorasan in the years 1313, 1314 and 1315 amounted to approxi mately 75,000, 80,000 and 100,000 pieces respec tively at an average price of rials 70 to 80 per piece. IV. OPIUM . The crop was satisfactory in the Khorasan Province and the Maliyeh Department purchased some 1,200 kharwars of opium during the year. Nearly half the quantity purchased was sent to Ispahan and the balance was used in the Khorasan and Mazanderan districts. It is said that large quantities of opium were smuggledinto Russia via Turkestan. The Government has decided to reduce the cultivation of opium and per mits have to he taken out in order to grow it in future. Cotton and sugar heet have to he grown instead. In the Kain district production was helow nor mal amounting only to 17,000 Ihs. Of this amount 13.000 Ihs was Purchased hy the Government and the balance of 4,000 Ihs together with an equivalent amount smuggled in from Afghanistan was illegally disposed of at rather less than half the price charged for Government opium. V. INDUSTRY . (a). New Industries . Some particulars of the more important factories erected in the Khorasan Province during the past few years are given helow. (i) Khorasan Leather factory . Installed In 1313. Cost Rials 3,500,000. Value of leather produced in 1314 was approximately Rials 4,000,000. The output of 1315 is expected to reach Rials 6,000,000. This factory has contracted with the Ministry for War to supply hoots and shoes value Rials 5,000,000. (ii) Ab-l-Kuh Simar Factory . This factory was opened infeeptemher 1936 by the Prime Minister and the Director of Industries. The factory worked for forty days only taking in 35.000 khar^wars of heet, which produced 3,500 to 4.000 kharwars of sugar. (iii) Alcohol and Arak Distlller.y . A Russian made Sawal plant was installed during the year hy the Shlrkat-i-Noosh, costing Rials 150,000 The daily output is 2,000 bottles. (iv) . Khosrovl Spinning and ./eavinr Mllils .iSHBP This Company which was formed in 1935 is the outcome of discussions which have been going on mce 1928 between the leading Pars! merchants in Bombay and one Arabab Kaikhusru, an Iranian Zcnojrfestrian at Tehran, on the subject of Pars! cooperation in Industrial activities in Iran. About AQ% of the capital has been subscribed by Parsis and the remainder by the Iranian Government. The directors are seven in number, four Iranians and three Parsis, with Mr. Coramissairat (a Bombay Mill-owner) as Managing Director. The factory buildings themselves, with the ex ception of the engine room etcetera which is to be built under the supervision of Indian employees of the Kairntny Company, has been erected by the German firm of Hotiff (?) at a cost of Tomans 60,000. The machinery was ordered as follows Spinning machinery, 10,000 spindles from Messrs. Platt Brothers of Oldham at a cost of £. 30,000. Weaving machinery from Germany. Electrical equipment from Germany. Boiler Plant from Bombay where a second hand plant has been purchased. The spinning machinery which was despatched via Askabad over a year ago has been arriving sinee No vember last and the last consignment was received early in ipril. Three British mechanics, who have erected similar though less up-to-date Plants in Ispahan, Kashan and Yezd arrived in January and have been hard at work since. They hope to have the first 3,000 aalHiiiissxaxti spindles ready to start work in another three months. But the boiler plant is not likely to be ready/then; the weaving machi nery, though in Meshed, is not yet being erected; and the electrical equipment is said to be stillheld up in HarnbUrfch, probably for lack of funds. Mr. Com.missairat who has just paid a visit to Meshed to raise the additional capital required has himself subscribed a further £.3,000 and is using part of this capital to surmount the difficulty of remit tances from the salaries of the firnfe xfIndian em ployees to their dependants in India. The directors are still confident that a handsome profit can be secured if only they can get even a part of the machinery working, as the total estima ted cost of production of yarn is less than of the present market price. At the same time the ?arsi shareholders are wondering how they will ever be able to enjoy their expected dividends if they cannot get them out of the country. (b) Mines . The turquoise mines at Nishapur and the salt mines at Nishapar and Sultanbad-i-Bazioor have all been well exploited during the year. The salt mines were leased by the Maliyeh Department for Rials 120,000 in Nishapur and Rials 16&amp;,000 at Sultahabad-1- Bazioor. The turquoise mines were leased for Rials 100 , 000 . The old coal mines at Aghunj and Agh-i-Darband have been reopened, but most of the coal brought to Meshed for sale is from the new mines near Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. A German engineer is in charge and the coal is said to be of good quality. A new coal mine Is also said to have been found near Sabzewar. VI. MUNICIPAL . (a).The income of the Meshed Municipality in 1313 was Rials 2,000,000, In 1314 it had increased to flxcajs) 'b i VO e, 000 cowA'CT&gt; Vt- (P Rials 4,000,000.(b/ ffork in the past few years has been mainly con centrated on road widening. Up to the close of 1314 eight main stregts had been built and two snore main streets are now under construction. Un fortunately, the work was being carried out by the Sakht-i-Man, which had allotted the sum of Rials 25,000,000 for work in Meshed. Now that the 3akht-i-Man has been closed down nearly all work has stopped and the four main streets which were nulled up in October 1936 preoaratory to being asphalted still present a sorry appearance. (c). Electric current for the city of Meshed is at present supplied by six different Power Stations, a most uneconomical arrangement. A new Power Station is to he erected machinery for which has been purchased from Germany, through the local branch of the A.ii.G. it is said that an all nig'ht service will be given first, which will in due course be extended to a 24 hour service, a number Sf electrical wireless receiving sets, mostly German, have been sold in Meshed during the year and this has created a demand for electricity by day.

The attempt to put into practice borrowed econoaic theories, which even la the highly organised countries of th ir origin have not v&amp;t, been thoroughly tested out, raust, in a country like Iran with its untrained, inexperienced and corrupt officials and an Ignorant, apathetic and often obstinate peasantry, at the best be a for might be workable in a oos haaogcamnis country with a highly trained bureaucracy to adminiot r it, but in Iran conditions vary so greatly in the different provinces that amplifications or modifications of the regulations designed in Tehran to stop leakages in one area often have the affect of drying up the whole stream of trade in another. E, in this respect East Iran seems to be unfortunate. * very now regulation seems expressly to hamper trade on the land route to India; and indeed the latest regulations for exporters have for the time being brought the whole of the exporting business to a standstill Under the previous system traders in exchange for penalasia to export go ds used to agree to sell to the Iranian exchange equivalent to the estimated of the goads exported. This left an obvious loophole as u small douceur to the appraising officer would result in/-in a vary low value being put on the goods, in order to prevent this the exporter lias now to agree to sell the exaot amount of foreign exoiaoage that the goods actually fetch aid hi order that tiers tiny be no chicanery here, the sain transaction '.ms to be certified by the local Chamber of COEraerce and countersigned by m Iranian representative* Goods exported to India are \ usually consigned direct to numerous snail traders in many different towns where there art) neither Chanto-.^rs of Coraraerco nor Iranian representatives* The new condi tions are tliersfore iapossible and I aa infonaed that since their i. ■.roductiuu no irtxtji traders have attested to obtain ex-'CsTt licenses. 3. this situation is all the mere unfortunate as the opinion is growing among the business cawaunity in hast Iran that tiio monopolisation of exports omsiat but i fall at least us far as India is concerned* To successfully an inti ate knowledge of the local is necessary, and this the Iranian jaanopoly do not possess and cannot easily acquire, a instance was the export of a large consign® saffron to ooraibay.

Laly, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan, Meshed, No. 1428-5/5(6), DATED, THE 4TH NOVEMBER 1936. I have the honour to forward herewith two copies of my Annual Com mercial Report for the provinces of Khorasan and Mekran (including the Kainat and Sarhad) for the Iranian Year 1314 (21st March 1935 to the 20th March 1936). 2. Should the Government of India approve of the Report being printed, I request that I may be supplied with ten copies, one of which may be sent direct to the Honourable the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Com missioner in Baluchistan. 3. A copy of the Report is being sent to His Majesty’s Envoy Extra ordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Iran, Tehran, under Printed Letter No. 106-5/5 (6). HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S CONSULATE-GENERAL FOR KHORASAN. Annual Commercial Report for the Provinces of Khorasan (including THE QaINAT) AND MEKRAN (INCLUDING ZaBUL FORMERLY KNOWN AS SlSTAN AND ZAHIDAN AND THE SARHAD) FOR THE IR ANIA N YEAR 1314 (21st March 1935 to 20th March 1936). Introductory Notes. The area covered by this report extends from the Russian frontier in the north to the Iranian Baluchistan frontier in the south. It includes the Holy City of Meshed and the town of Turbat-i-Haidari, Birjand, Zabul (Sistan) and Zahidan (Luzdap). Meshed (for Khorasan) is, and always has been, chiefly concerned with trade to and from Russia via Bajgiran and Lutfabad for Askabad on the Russian Central Asian Railway. Through Zahidan pass Iranian exports for consumption chiefly in India and imports both from India proper and from other countries (see Appendix C ”). Except where specially stated, the figures in this report are based on conversion rates as follows :— Rials 551 ’ 66 per Rupees 100. Rials 81‘18 per £ Sterling. Conversion rates adopted in the reports for previous years were :—- 1933- 1934. Rials 626*00 per Rupees 100. 1934- 1935. Rials 593*50 per Rupees 100. A Rial is the same as a Kran. One Batman equals 6|- lbs. One Indian maund equals 80 lbs. When comparing figures with those of previous years, the variation in conversion rates should be borne in mind. The weights of the various commodities imported and exported have been compiled from statistics obtained from the Nushki-Nok Kundi branch of the North-Western Railway of India, while values are based on invoices for imports and the accepted Customs valuation for exports. The figures do not entirely correspond with those published by the Iranian Customs Department for in some cases goods exported and customed at Meshed, and again, goods imported by the railway are not necessarily cleared from the Customs within the period covered by the report, or alter natively in the case of exports, may be customed but not actually carried out of the country until a later date. 566(C) F&amp;PD ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter | Dated 2 6 'HM. Received Ig FEE. 19372 It is regretted that no figures were procurable from the Meshed Customs House for Khorasan proper. These will be found in the Annual Report issued by the Iranian Government. Appendix “ A ” to this report shows the total imports and exports via Zahidan during the year together with the figures for the two previous years. In comparing values due allowance must be made for the variation in conversion rates. Appendix “ B ” supplies details of imports and exports for various com modities. Appendix “ C ” consists of a comparative statement of imports from the British Empire and other sources. Appendix “ D ” is a table showing distances and average freight rates during the year under report. 1. Trade. (a) General conditions of trade during the year .—Owing to the Russo- Iranian Trade Agreement, trade in Khorasan showed some slight improvement Russian exports, which consisted chiefly of soft sugar, loaf sugar, cotton textiles and glassware showed a considerable increase and large quantities of raw cotton and wool were exported to Russia from Iran. The carpet market though still depressed showed a slight improvement on the previous year. An average of 14-18 bales of carpets being exported monthly as opposed to 9-10 bales during the year 1934. In Zahidan trade throughout the year was depressed, with the exception of increased importation of tea during the month of August, when as a result of the prohibition by the Government of India except under license of the export of inferior quality tea, over 30,000 cases of such tea were rushed into | Iran. The Iranian Government has aimed at considerable official control of trade and to this end companies have been and are still being formed, to which the monopoly is granted of dealing in certain goods. The capital of such companies is subscribed partly by the general public and partly by the Government through the agency of the National Bank or of the Agricultural Bank. The affairs of such companies are virtually controlled by the Govern ment and the system entirely eliminates the private trader, except in so far as he may act as a local sub-agent of a monopoly company. It is understood that these companies will endeavour to establish their own buying and selling agencies abroad (consisting of Iranian nationals, or such nationals formed into companies acting in conjunction with the parent monopoly company in Iran) in order to still further eliminate foreign interests jn trade with Iran. The action indicated above has directly and greatly affected trade which has hitherto followed the land route to and from India via Zahidan. The latter town has for years been the centre of import and export agents! Since the introduction of the monopoly system, the goods in which such 'agents can deal have become even more restricted in number, until by the end of the year not more than some half a dozen commodities of little importance could be dealt in by the private trader and even these were about to be the objects of further monopolisation. Near the close of the year an Exchange Control Act was promulgated, a s a result of which all transactions in Foreign Exchange have to be carried out under the auspicies and with the permission of a Control Commission sitting jn Tehran. A merchant who wishes to import goods must submit to the following procedure :— An import license must be obtained from the Chamber of Commerce, which must be issued with the sanction of the Exchange Commission at Tehran and bear its seal.3 On receipt of the Import License the merchant prepares his order for goods and full particulars must be shown in a special form—“ Application for Exchange for Imports ”—which has to be forwarded to the Exchange Commission at Tehran. When permission is obtained (a delay of some months occurring) one of the authorised banks issues a Letter of Credit for the sanctioned amount of Foreign Exchange, provided the Importer:— (i) pays 25 per cent, of the sanctioned amount in rials, (ii) produces a copy of the order for the goods showing particulars of the consignment and place of origin. The Bank must then examine the Import License in the possession of the importer to ascertain that it covers the goods and prices as imvoiced. After these preliminaries the harassed importer is in a position to order the goods and sends the Letter of Credit to the consignor, who hands over the railway or shipping documents relative to the goods together with the Credit Note to a bank abroad. This bank adjusts matters with the bank in Iran which issued the Credit Note. It takes not less than two months for a trader in the provinces to obtain an Import License and he must then wait an indefinite period to ascertain whether or not he will be granted Foreigen Exchange by the Currency Com mission. There have been many cases in which 2b months have elapsed without any reply being received, meanwhile the period of validity of the Import Licenses is liable to expire and as such licenses cost 18 per cent, to purchase the Importer stands to lose heavily. (b) New Items of Trade. Nil. (c) New Trade Channels. —Nil. {d) Growth of foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting therefrom. —Sales of English piece-goods as compared with those of Russian and Japanese origin are negligible. The recent Irano-German Barter Agree ment is likely to prove a source of danger to British trade interests in East Iran. (e) The Russians, their trading methods, popularity, success or failure .— Nil. (/) Credits offered by foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British firms. —Credit is only given to Iranian trades by Russian and Japanese merchants. The Russians take one-third cash, one-third in Iranian products and one-third on delivery. They generally allow merchants 7-9 months in which to pay after delivery. The Japanese take one-third in cash and two- thirds in Iranian products. (g) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment etcetera. —Quality is admired but cheapness is the main point in view. Russian, Japanese and German goods are the cheapest and hence most in demand. (h) Opening for British Trade. —Under present conditions it is question able whether it would pay any British firm to establish a representative in Khorasan. In Zahidan there has been keen competition in bicycles. British bicycles are popular and hitherto formed the principle supply but owing to the recent trading difficulties they are now ousted from the market by German machines. (i) Overtrading. —Nil. (j) Commercial Morality. —Fair—Reference to His Majesty’s Consuls is advisable before establishing relations with unknown firms. (k) Working of the Courts in Commercial Cases. —No change since last year. 2. Financial. {a) Tightness of Money .—Conditions showed an improvement on last year. Advances paid on the year’s harvest eased the situation in Khorasan. Towards the end of the year, however, the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Laws caused a renewed tightness.(b) Divertion of Capital from Trade to other purposes. —Nil. (c) Bankruptcies .—Owing to fluctuations in exchange rates of the Chervantz three of the minor Meshed merchants became bankrupt. In Zahidan the British firm of Messrs. Wasuram Gopiram and one of the leading leading Iranian firms, Messrs Ettihadieh, went into liquidation. 3. Taxation. High Customs tariff continues to curtail the purchasing power of mer chants. In Khorasan although the method of assessment of Income Tax was changed during the year it is still arbitrarily assessed and is the cause of general dissatisfaction. 4. Military. (a) Commandeering of Transport .—Motor ransport was irregularly commandeered during the month of December 1935 for the movement of troops from Zahidan to Khwash and Dohak. The drivers were offered a very low rate of hire, which was refused. The question had eventually to be referred to the British Legation. A settlement is still awaited. (b) Exertion and interference with Trade and Industry .—There have been many minor complaints of extortion at the hands of the Road Guards, petty Customs officials etcetera. (c) Effect of conscription .—No bad effect on trade. 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under cultivation .—In Mekran great efforts are being made to improve agricultural conditions and the area under cultivation is in creasing. / {b) Harvest .—In Khorasan the wheat crop was good. No figures as to area under cultivation are available. (c) Introduction of new crops and new methods .—With a view to meeting the requirements of the new Sugar Factory at Meshed, as far as possible locally, large areas of land in the vicinity of Meshed have been placed under beet cultivation. In Mekran the cultivation of vegetables is being encouraged and vege tables are now available to meet the demands of the residents of Zahidan for about half the year. (d) Irrigation, more or less water .—In Mekran irrigation is improving and water is now sufficient for the limited cultivation in the vicinitv of Zahidan. 6. Opium. The opium harvest in Khorasan was particularly good. 7. Industry. (a) State of industry generally .—No improvement. 8. Communications. (a) Good. During the year two new roads between Kuchan and Lutfa- bad, and Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and Kariz were constructed. Great attention is being paid to the upkeep of old roads.(b) Average rates Summer and Winter on the chief trade routes* Zahidan—Nok Kundi 45 Rials per kharvar. Zahidan—Zabul 14 Rials per kharvar. Zahidan—Meshed 65 Rials per kharvar. Zahidan—Kerman 70 Rials per kharvar. Meshed—Zahidan 117 Rials per kharvar. Meshed—Tehran 100 Rials per kharvar. Meshed—Bajgiran 1*60 per pood. Zabul—Zahidan 40 Rials per kharvar. Nok Kundi—Zahidan 30 Rials per kharvar. Kerman—Zahidan 95 Rials per kharvar. (c) Security .—At the beginning of the year two or three armed raids took place between Meshed and Birjand. Conditions improved towards the end of the year. 9. Social. {a) The unveiling of all women was ordered by the Government and the majority of the population is now in European dress. The change has caused extra expense to the public as a result of which the middle class and the poor are suffering greatly from the increased cost of living. (6) There has been some improvement in public health and sanitation* (c) Owing to the employment of large numbers of labourers in the various town-planning, road construction and improvement schemes there has been little unemployment. Such labour [is often not paid at full market rates. (d) Municipal services are being rendered with comparative efficiency. Lighting and scavenging arrangements show imrpovement in the principal town of Meshed. C. K. DALY, Lt.-Colonel, His Majesty's Consul-General for Khorasan. \ 666(C) FA PD12 APPENDIX C.

Should the Government of India approve of the Report being printed, I request that I may be supplied with ten copies, one of which may be sent direct to the Hon’ble the A. C. C. in Baluchistan. 3.

Annual Commercial report for the Provinces oe Khorassan (including the Kainat) and Mekran (including Zabul—formerly known as Sistan—and ZaHIDAN—FORM ERLY KNOWN AS DUZDAP) AND THE SARHAD, FOR THE IRANIAN year 1313 (21st March 19jl to the 20th March 1935.) Introductory Notes. The area covered by this report pxtends from the |Russian frontier in the north, to the Iran-Raluchistan fron tier in the South. It includes the holy city of Meshed, and the towns of Turbat-i-Haidari, Birjand, Zabul (Sistan) and Zahidan (Duzdap), the one-time rail Head of the Nushki extension of the North Western Rail way, which since July, 1931, has been withdrawn to Nok-Kundi. Meshed (for Khorassan) is, and always has been, chiefly concerned with trade to and from Russia via Bajgiran and Lutfabad for Askabad and Artik on the Russian Central Asian Railway. Through Zahidan passed Iranian exports for consumption chiefly in India (the absence of land Customs duty on this route enormously benefited exporters), and imports both from India proper and other countries. (See Appendix “C r ’). Except where specially stated, the figures in this report are based on con version rates as follows: — Rials 593-50 per Rupees 100. Rials 78 7 per £1. 465(0; F&amp;PD Conversion rates adopted in the reports for the previous years were:— Rials. Rupees. 1931-32 . • . 615-10 100 1932-33 . • . 766-20 100 1933-34 . « . 626 100 A Rial is the same as a Kran. One Batman equals 6J lbs. One Indian Maund equals 80 lbs. When comparing figures with those of previous years, the variation of con version rates should be borne in mind. The weights of the various commodi ties imported and exported have been compiled from statistics obtained from the Nushki-Nok-kundi branch of the North Western Railway of India, while values are based on invoices for imports and on the accepted Customs valuation for exports. The figures do not entirely corr espond with those published by the Ira nian Custom Department 'for in some cases goods exported are customed at Meshed, and again, goods imported by the Railway are not necessarily cleared from the Customs within the period covered by the report or„ alternatively, in the case of exports, may be customed but not actually carried out of the country till a later date.It is regretted that no figures were procurable from the Meshed Customs House for Khorassan proper. These will be found in the Annual Report issued by the Iranian Government. Appendix “A” to this report shows the total imports and exports via Zahidan during the year, together with the figures for jthe two previous years. In comparing values the variation in conversion rates should be borne in mind. Appendix “B” supplies details of imports and exports for various eom- modies. Appendix “C” consists of a compa rative statement of imports from the British Empire and cither sources. Appendix “D” consists of a table showing distances and average freight rates during the year under report. 1. Trade. (a) General conditions of Trade during the Condition of trade in the province of Khorassan during the Iranian year 1313 remained de pressed. This was largely due to the new Government monopolies which are causing great concern to merchants since very few commodities will remain open to private trade.. The carpet market, formerly the main industry of Khorassan shows no impro vement. Exports have fallen and 70 per cent, of the looms are said to have closed down, the weavers being 'em ployed on road making, etc. In August a representative of the Czeohoslavokian Skoda Factory visit ed Meshed to buy carpets against the money which his firm is receiving for the installation of various sugar fac tories in Iran. Prices in Meshed were immediately raised, with the result that he left Meshed after effecting only trifling purchases. In Zahidan, with the exception of in creased importation of tea the general condition of trade remained normal during the year. Exchange on India fluctuated be tween Rials 520 and Rials 620 per 100 Rupees. Stocks of sugar lying with the Ira nian Government in Zahidan from the previous year could not be sold at prices to compete with smuggled loaf, sugar which continued to find its way into all territories of East Iran. This caused the Iranian Government to sell their loaf sugar at a reduced rate of 1,200 Rials per kharwar of 650 lbs. with the result that a good deal of the stock has been sold and smuggling temporarily decreased. An embargo having been placed on the export by sea from India of low grade teas, the importation which pre viously took place via the Southern Ira nian ports, has been deflected to the land route from India. The demand for low grade tea is considerable in Iran, but the profits derived by importers, mainly British Indian subjects, although satisfactory have not been great, owing to the necessity of cutting prices to compete with tea of Japanese origin. The latter sells at the same price as low grade Indian tea but has not seriously competed, it being gen erally recognised as of inferior quality.. Trade in motor lorries was brisk- About 20 Morris, 14 Ford, and 80 Chev rolet vehicles being imported. It is satisfactory to note that the Morris trucks are Increasing in popularity. A considerable quantity of Japanese Bridge-Stone tyres were imported by the Auto-,Supply Company in Zahidan. The tyres have a rapid sale owing to cheap prices and liberal replacements. (h) New items of trade. &lt;3^ above regarding imports of British motor trucks. (c) New trade channels. —No new in- ' ternal trade channels have been opened during the year under review. (d) Growth of foreign competition and danger to British interests there from. —Nil. (e) The Russians—their trading methods — popularity—success or failure ■ —Nil. (/) Credits offered by foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British firms. —Credit is only given to Iranian merchants by Japanese and Russian firms. The Russians take Jrd in cash, ^rd in Iranian products, and Jrd on delivery. They generally allow mer chants 8 or 10 months to pay after deli very. The Japanese take Jrd in Iranian products, frds on delivery and give about10 months credit. German firms take Iranian products to the total value, in some cases, of the German goods export ed. (g) Popularity of foreign goods d;e to quality price, terms of payment, etc. ■—Merchants are more or less obliged to take Russian and German goods in re turn for' Iranian goods exported. Russian cotton, Japanese crockery and glassware and German machinery owing to low cost prices are in demand. (A) Openings for British trade .— Owing to the new “monopoly” com panies which are continually being formed it is questionable whether, under the present conditions, there would be sufficient trade to recompense a British, firm for establishing a representative in : Khorassan. In Zahidan, however, Messrs. Mool Chand Cbandar Bhan of Karachi have taken the agency for dis tribution of Dunlop tyres in East Iran. The original equipment of Dunlop tyres on Morris lorries has given satisfaction to purchasers of these vehicles. (i) Overtrading. —Nil. (j) Commercial morality. —Russian commercial morality is not locally re garded as of high standard but that of Iranian traders and especially that of the “Jadid” community of Meshed is said to be reliable. Reference to His Majesty’s Consuls is advisable before establishing relations with unknown firms. (k) Working of the Courts in Com mercial cases. —A considerable number of cases are still pending in the local courts of Khorassan. The methods are slow and tedious and impose serious difficulties on traders involved in legal proceedings. 2. Financial. (a) Tightness of money. —The state of the money market\ in Zahidan was normal principally owing to the trade in tea. In Meshed, however, money was tight throughout the year, during the latter part of which, many documents were deposited in the National Bank as secu rity to raise loans. The Bank in such cases only advances ^rd of the amount of the documents. Interest at the rate of 8 Tomans per 1,000 Tomans per month is charged. It is reported that loans amounting to Tomans 380,000 have been made by thee National Bank in this manner. (b) Evidence of private unemployed or held abroad. —A certain amount of private capital has been sent to Pales tine by the Jadids of Meshed, many of whom are awaiting a favourable oppor tunity to emigrate to that country,. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice versa.—The ex tent of the trade depression is such that considerable sums of money are lying idle in foreign banks. Immoveable property has been purchased to a great' extent during the year under review by merchants of Khorassan. (d) Bankruptcies. —In Zahidan the following firms became insolvent during the year :—(1) Sunder Singh, Natha Sinoffi. (2i Hard it Sin.q4i Ar jan Singh. (3) An Iranian firm styled Ahmedi. i ■ 3. Taxation. The method of collection of Income Tax employed by the Revenue authori ties caused a great deal of dissatisfac tion in Khorassan. No books were examined and the tax was somewhat arbitrarily assessed by the authorities and appeals proved ineffective. High customs tariff combined with increased taxation or at least greater pressure in connection continues to de press the purchasing power of con sumers. I i 4. Military. {a) Commandeering by troops .— During the latter part of the year lorries and cars of British subjects in Khorassan and Zahidan were comman deered by the Iranian Military autho rities for the conveyance of troops, etc. In most cases either an insufficient sum or no compensation at all was paid to the owners of the cars commandeer ed. Casualties occurred amongst, the British Indian motor drivers Comman deered and compelled to drive their vehicles in the disturbed area of Balu chistan. (b) Extortions and interference with trade and industry. —Nothing to report. {c) Effects of Conscription —No bad effect on trade.4 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under cultivation, more or less. —No change. (b) The harvest. —The wheat crop was normal but owing to a late cold season only half the amount of the pre vious years cotton was harvested. 6. Opium. The opium harvest in Khorassan was £&lt;*xT The Iranian Government pur chased opium at Rials 230 per man. 7 . Industry. (a) State of industry q ever ally .— Very depressed. None of the indus tries in Khorassan did well during the year. {b) NeuTindustries. —Nil. (c) Lapse of old ones. —Nil. {d) Demand for foreign machinery. —-The newly formed Thread Weaving factory of Khorassan Meshed called for tenders for the supply of machinery for the factory. {e) Development of mWs\—Nothin^ to report. &amp; 8. Communications and Transport. {a) Construction of new roads and upkeep of old. —More than usual atten tion was paid to the upkeep of the lehran-Meshed road owing to the fact that H. I. M. the Shah visited Meshed P during the year. ^ (b) Air services. —Nil. (c) Security. —Armed raids took place m the Zorabad district 3 Gen darmes were killed and 25 villages robbed. At the close of the year this incident was the subject of enquiry of a joint Perso-Afghan commission. Armed raiders held up cars and lorries near Turbat-i-Haidari and Khedri on the Meshed-Zahidan road during Nov ember, killing one driver and wounding three other persons. 9. Social. After the visit of H. I. M. the Shah . er ® wa ; s a great deal of unemployment m. Meshed as municipal funds for re- pamng roads, etc., were exhausted by the abnormal efforts made to improve the town for His Majesty’s visit. The general improvement in Public Health and sanitation reported last year was not maintained. A new Mayor of Meshed was appointed but his efforts were handicapped by the lack of funds referred to above. The new Shah Reza Hospital at Meshed was completed at the end of the year. A German Doctor has been ap pointed Director, There is at present accommodation for 60 patients only al though the buildings could accommo date many more. Lack of funds is liable to greatly hamper the develop ment of this hospital. C. K. DALY, His Majesty’s Consul General for Khorassan, Meshed.APPENDIX C.

As you know, the export duty of Rs. li per 100 lbs. v^hich had been in force from 1st March 1916 was abolished with effect from 1st March 1927, and had there been any proposal to revive it we should surely have heard of it. Possibly what is meant is that the introduction of the licensing system has involved an increase in the cost of tea exported under licence of 2 annas per lb. as compared with tea exported overland. We know, in fact, that this is, if anything, an understatement of the effect of the licensing system. On the other hand, though perhaps less likely, the report may have reference to the fact tnat the cess imposed under the Indian Tea Cess Act on all Indian tea exported by sea from India was increased by 2 annas pe'' 1 lp , l.,_lbs« in September 1933.

Introductory Notes. The area covered by this report extends from the Russian frontier in the north to the Perso- Baluchistan frontier in the south. It includes the Holy City of Meshed and the towns of Turbat- i-Haidari, Birjand, Zabul (Sistan) and Zahidan (Duzdap), the one' time rail-head of the Nushki extension of the North Western Railway, which since July 1931 has been withdrawn to Nok Kundi. Meshed (for Khorasan) is and always has been chiefly concerned with trade to and from Russia via Bajgiran and Lutfabad for Askabad and Artik on the Russian Central Asian Railway. Through Zahidan passed Persian Exports for consumption chiefly in India (the absence of Land Customs duty on this route enormously benefited exporters), and Imports both from India proper and other countries. (See Appendix C.) Except where specially stated the figures in this Report are based on conversion rates as follows :— Rials 626 Rs. 100 83-599 £1 Conversion rates adopted in the Reports for the previous years were :— Rials. Rs. 615-10 100 766-20 100 A Rial is the same as a Kran. One Batman equals 6£ lbs. One Indian Maund equals 80 lbs. When comparing figures with those of previous years the variation of conversion rates should be borne in mind. This Report covers the Persian year 1312, i.e., 21st March 1933 to 20th March 1934. The weights of the various commodities imported and exported have been compiled from statistics obtained from the Nushki-Nok-Kundi branch of the North Western Railway of India, while values are based on invoices for Imports and on the accept ed Customs valuation for Exports. 2 (21st March 1933 to 20th The figures do not entirely correspond to those published by the Persian Customs Department for in some cases goods exported are customed at Meshed, and again, goods imported by the Railway are not necessarily cleared from the Customs within the period covered by the Report or, alternatively, in the case of Exports, may be customed but not actually carried out of the country till a later date. It is regretted that no figures were procurable from the Meshed Custom House for Khorasan proper. These will be compiled in the Annual Report to be issued by the Persian Government in 1935. Appendix A to this Report shows the total im ports and exports via Zahidan during the year together with the figures for the two previous years. In comparing values the variation in conversion rates should be borne in mind. Appendix B supplies details of Imports and Exports for various commodities. Appendix C consists of a comparative statement of Imports from British Empire and other sources. Appendix D consists of a table showing distances and average freight rates during the year under report. 1. Trade. ^ (a) General conditions of Trade during the year (Imports and Exports ).—In Meshed for the first seven months of the year under report trade was virtually at a standstill; it was reported that never within the memory of existing merchants had conditions been so bad. The fact that the total Customs receipts at Bajgiran and Lutfabad, the two principal trade depots on the Russian frontier, only amounted Rials 155 for the month of June will indicate the extent of the depression. During August a slight improvement, and from November to January a distinct improvement was apparent, both in trade with Russia and also to Europe and via Zahidan to India. The change was attributed to the improvement of “ export certificates ” sales, the increased sterlingtmmmmam i^ rite, and a.,be,ttex,Reeling in the relation between the Meshed merchants and the Russian trade - . '_&gt;7v (•)) •The improvement was not, however, maintained during February, and at the close of the financiah year, trade,,was ponsiderably duller than, at, a cm- responding period.last year. Early this year (1034) the raising of the ,embargo resulted in a considerable quantity of Indian sugar being imported via Zahidan. In March all “ prohibited ” goods were taken over by the Persian authorities and placed on sale in four special shops. They were retailed at 15 per cent to the Government for expenses. This arrange ment was naturally a complete failure, and during December the sale of the above mentioned category of articles was made free (chiefly owing to the fact that the perishable goods were rapidly deteriorat ing), and this effort to exclude foreign luxuries in order to stimulate home industries, was discon tinued. In January, however, instructions were issued by the Persian Government that merchants wishing to import former prohibited goods must purchase dollars from authorised Banks at the old gold rate of 28-3 Rials as against 17 Rials to the dollar to the extent of 10 per cent of the value of the goods which they wish to import. Early in 1933 the Russo-Persian trade relations were extremely strained. No transactions were carried out at the Russian Bank here, and other Banks dedihed to discount long term bills given by the Russians for purchases of cotton. During April 1933 the Soviet Trading Organisation closed their offices; at Meshed. At this time 100 gold rouble shares in the Russian Bank were on sale at a discount Of 7 per cent. New Soviet trade representa tives were at Meshed trying to do trade but without success as they were unwilling to pay cash for their purchases. : In- December however the difficulties between- the Soviet trade representatives and the Meshed merchants were removed and all accounts were settled, goods purchased and exported to Russia. In the latter half of the year the sugar and carpet trades also showed signs of renewed pros perity. , In Zahidan the lowest rate for the year was 543 Rials to Rs. 100 and the highest 730. Whilst as a result of the Trade Monopoly Law imports and exports practically balanced {see Appendix A), traders reported a reasonable profit on both imports and exports. This was contrary to last year’s posi tion. xIn the middle of the year exchange rates in Zahi dan and Nok Kundi achieved the same level which put a stop to the smuggling of silver. This irregular trade jwas however replaced, by the smuggling {of siigar, tea and piece-goods, etc.,;-!from Nok Kundi,' into/the main, portions of East.and South Persia,,; This-, is profitable and continues for. though a coiho side cable quant ityi of goods of this nature has been l captured, it appears that the success attending smuggling more than counterbalances the danger of capture by the Customs Department.* / A large quantity of bar silver entered India through Persia from Europe on a transit basis. Similarly a consignment of Japanese goods found its way into India and this led the Indian Govern ment to take ! necessary measures outlined as below:— {a) Drant of railway rebate was stopped on silver. (6) Indian Sea Customs duty on silver was reduced from 7| to 5 annas per ounce. The Persian Government imported 33,000 bags of Belgian loaf sugar via Zahidan for sale under the control of the Customs house. As the fall in the foreign exchange rate caused a drop on the sale price of loaf sugar, the Persian Government, in order to avoid loss, enforced a special law which allowed the import of sugar against purchase of double the quantity of Government loaf sugar at a fixed high rate. Owing to a levy by the Government of India of 2 annas per lb on tea exported from Indian Sea Ports, there was marked rise in the importation of this commodity through Zahidan. 1931-32 1933-34 Lakhs. 7-159 19-688 In order to put a check on smuggling, tea could be imported into Persia only in packets of 500 grams weight and each packet had to be marked with the names of the supplier and importer. Imports via Zahidan—General Comments on Appendix B {Imports ).—Again this year the fall in Imports due to the Trade Monopoly Law and other restrictions is apparent from the following figures which are compared with the year 1929- 30:— Indian Indian Maunds of Maunds of 80 lbs. 80 lbs. 1929-30. 1933-34.

Exports via Zahidan—General Comments on Appendix B (Exports). —The strained trade rela tions with Russia and the working of the Trade Monopoly Law have been the cause of the following increased exports via Zahidan :—• Indian Indian Maunds. Maunds. 1929-30. 1933-34.

Due to the persecution of Jewish fur dealers in Afghanis tan. Again any loss in Exporting is borne by the con sumer of Imports. (b) New Items of Trade. —Messrs. N. A. Mullick (motor dealers) with branches at Meshed and Zahi dan have been given the distribution of Morris Commercial vehicles in East Persia (area east of Shahrud on Tehran-Meshed road). Two trial lorries met with instant approval and twenty more have been ordered. Yet again mnst it be recorded that British firms appear to be either too lazy to see that their goods are brought to the notice of Persian consumers, or to have unsuitable representatives for this all important work. (c) New Trade Channels. —Nil. (d) Growth of Foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting therefrom.—On account of considerable imports of Japanese goods into Khora- san the import from other countries corresponding ly suffered and their prices were forced down. The price of certain articles of clothing which Were formerly imported by the Russians also decreased. The increase in Japanese imports is said to be due largely to the movements of the merchants of Khora- san against the trade with Russia which compelled the exporters to export cotton and wool, etc., to India and Germany via Zahidan and Mohammerah respectively, and to import Japanese goods instead. (e) The Russians-^—their Trading Methods — Popu larity—success or failure. —Trade with Russia has never recovered from the break during 1932. Per sian merchants distrust and cordially dislike their neighbours who are their natural market but who do them down whenever they can. The Russians are persona non grata in Khorasan. (/) Credits offered by Foreign Firms as opposed to those granted by British Firms. —All Foreign firms are chary in offering credit to Persian traders. Exchange fluctuations aggravate the depression and tightness of money. Payment for goods should be arranged through the Banks (Imperial Bank of Persia (British) rather than the Persian Government National Bank). (g) Popularity of Foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc. —As ever, price is the determining factor especially now that money is scarce and the people too poor to think of anything except the getting of their next meal. Japanese goods at their ridiculously low prices are a boon to impecunious Persian purchasers. Terms offered by Japanese suppliers appear to be fairly generous. (A) Openings for British goods.—See 1(6) above. Persia has been treated on occasions abominably I by British trading concerns who have now begun I to realise their foolishness. Dunlops flooded Persia with old stock tyres from I India and in consequence lost their chance in an I excellent market. Firms should choose their travelling representa tives with care, and should not avoid asking His Majesty’s Consular Officers for advice and assistance. (i) Overtrading. —Nil. (j) Commercial Morality. —Generally fair, though reference to His Majesty’s Consular Officers or to the Imperial Bank nf Persia is essential. On account of bad financial conditions and the trade in Import Certificates, whose value fluctuated irregularly, the majority of the third class merchants of Khorasan went bankrupt. The Banks there fore limited credits and pressed for settlement ofm:. .... . : .. ■:-. •...!' !•; • :.;&gt;i[f t--,t i.-.Gi tliose outstanding. This was one of the most important causes of the shortage of money, (k) Working of Law Courts in Commercial Cases .— In as far as the pressure of religious or secular authoiity is not brought to bear, the findings of the Meshed Courts are usually unbiased, 'but still far from expeditious. The expense involved in a civil suit is of course always great. The Meshed Court recently granted a decree against the Bolshevik “ Bureau Perse ” for Tomans 450,000 in favour of Persian merchants. The decree has not yet been made absolute, as the firm has appeal ed against the finding to the High Court at Tehran. 2. Financial. (а) Tightness of Money—to what extent due to restriction of Credit, Exchange, Insecurity, Extra Taxation, Bad Harvests, etc. —Money was tight mainly owing to lack of demand from abroad for • Persian products such as :— 1. Carpets and rugs. 2. Cotton. 3. Wool. 4. Gums. 5. Dried fruits. 6. Opium. (б) Evidence of Private Capital unemployed or held abroad. —There is no evidence here of idle monies, nr funds invested abroad. Foreign invest ments such as British gilt-edged securities do not attract Persians as the yield is too low. Money easily commands 15/25 per cent p.a. fully secured by carpets, rugs, jewellery or real estate. (c) Diversion of Capital from Trade to other pur poses or vice versa.—Since the various Monopolies were instituted there has been a growing tendency oil the part of the elderly merchants to withdraw their capital from commerce and put it into farm 'lands or house property. The small man (and the illiterate) whose capital wafe (say) Rials 50,000 is being driven out of trade. Sitch capital is insufficient to make a livelihood nowadays as the illiterate cannot cope with the many cofifitsing laws concerning exports and imports. 1 (d) Bankruptcies. —During the month of February 1934 five firms in Meshed were declared insolvent. This sad state of affairs was not restricted to Meshed ^alone; but to the whole of Persia. Failure of trade with Russia and in the world and gambling in ex change and in Export Certificates was the primary icause and the firms involved included (1) Sadiq- zadeh ; Oskoie.»andf&lt;&gt; (2) Baqirzadeh. The former paid -30 per pent and the latter^ whose, goods were left unsold in Hamburg, paid, nothing out of tip '1,170,000 involved. Both firms are still closed. (e) Competition among Local Banks. —Competi tion in Banking circles (other than the Imperial Bank of Persia) is keen. Other Banks seem content to forego profits ofi Inland Exchange and rely on interest on usance paper to fecompensate them. The Banks (National, Pehlevi and Russian) want a turnover at all costs. The Jews are as usual the most prosperous. TheyWF seem to weather any storm and most of them throughout Persia have, in the past year, made handsome profits on silver exports London/Bombay via Persia. The trade (or traffic) is now dead but the Jews can afford to sit tight for a long time. Money invested in the sending of silver into India via Zahidan yielded over 100 per cent. It kept going for a year. The purchasing power of the Rial in terms of imports is low. Today’s (19th August 1934) rial sterling rate is 78-45 but the public pay about Rials 150 for £ when expressed in foreign goods. 3. Taxation. (a) Effect on Purchasing Power. —High taxation has an adverse effect on trade. Merchants get no encouragement whatsoever and the consensus of opinion is that as time goes on more and more monopolies will be created and that private trading on a large scale will not be permitted. (c) Interference and obstruction on part of Tax Collectors. —None reported. 4. Military. (а) Commandeering of Transport.- —None was reported. (б) Extortions and interference with Trade and Industry.—This year military guards worked under the Customs Department to help to check smuggling on the frontiers ; this has probably led to a certain degree of extortion and bribery on the part of the military. (c) Effects of Conscription. —The effect of con scription upon trade is not adverse as “ conscript ed ” merchants usually leave a member of their family in charge of affairs during their enforced absence, and return to their business all the better for their military training. 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under Cultivation, more or less.- —The Revenue Department are unable to give any idea as to the area under cultivation in the Khorasan Province, nor are figures available for Zahidan or Zabulistan and Kainat. (b) The Harvest. —The harvest was generally good. (c) Introduction of new crops and new methods (Mac^wery).—Palestinian and American cotton was sown in Khorasan to a greater extent than in previ ous years during the year under report. No new methods of any importance were introduced.(d) Harm done by interference of authorities (of Arbitrary prices, Land Titles, etc .).—None reported. (e) Irrigation, more or less water .—Figures are not obtainable as they are not maintained any where. (/) Extent to which Land Hypothecated .—Not known. It is anticipated that a branch of the Persian Agricultural Bank will be opened shortly in Meshed. Khorasan. —The opium harvest this year was good. A large amount of opium was smuggled from Afghanistan for consumption in Persia. There was no opium export from Khorasan during the past Persian year 1312 (21st March 1933 to 20th March 1934), and the drug was consumed locally. The Persian Government purchased opium at Rials 160 per man, and resold it at Rials 768 per man after benderolling it. The Government sells the opium to merchants for export at the same rate of Rials 160 per man, recovering a customs tax of Rials 100 per man of 6| lbs avoir. Kainat. —The total yield was about 35,750 lbs, but only about 7,150 lbs were delivered to the Excise Department. Cultivators received 80-100 Rials per 6-5 lbs. The amount sold to consumers by the Excise Department was 1,560 lbs at Rials 1/20 per miskal (-16 ounce)—Rials 780 per 6J lbs. Some 9,750 lbs of opium smuggled in from Afghan istan and sold at 200-220 Rials per 6| lbs, while local opium was sold at 180 to 200 Rials per 6| lbs. The Excise Department confiscated some 2,600 lbs of opium from smugglers and inflicted fines amounting to 50,000 Rials. Zabulistan.—The cultivation of opium was pro hibited by Government and no opium was produced at all. Smuggled opium, however, came in from Afghanistan and as enough opium already existed in Sistan people still continued to smoke opium though drastic measures were taken by the Govern ment to stop this evil. 7. Industry. (f) State of Industry Generally. (1) Carpets .— There were 3,000 looms in Meshed and suburbs in the year 1930, while their number in the current year 1934 is not more than 300. The carpet factories in Turbat-i-Haidari, Nisha- pur and Sabzawar are not of much importance. Birjand is another centre of the carpet industry. The looms there have, been reduced by 2/3rds during the period from 1930 to 1934. There Were 2,000 looms in the year 1930 in Birjand and suburbs, but now in this year 1934 only 500 remain open. In the year 1930, the Oriental Carpet Manufac turers Ltd., Meshed,, exported to Foreign countries 86 bales of carpets every month, but in this year hviukomi: eie** iCv-r/tDoqrrd vm abod'-'-er* 1934 not more than 9 to 10 bales of carpets were exported. Jhe remaining carpet merchants of Meshed trade in the same proportion. (2) Silk Worm Breeding. —Silk worms are bred in the hill districts of Meshed, Turbat-i-Haidari, Nisha- pur and other places in Khorasan. The silk is brought to Meshed from all these places. Previously it was exported but how that has practically ceased. (3) Silk Cloth Industry.- —There were 300 Ka-nawiz weaving factories in Meshed in the year 1930, but now in the year 1934 there are only 100 factories open and working. The amount of silk cloth ex ported to India is very small compared to previous years. (4) Cotton Thread Weaving Factory.—There is only one cotton thread weaving factory in Meshed. It belonged to the late Herr Franke of the firm of Waunckhaus, but is not working now, and thread is imported to Meshed from India. The thread is woven into cloth in- Meshed and suburbs by hand. (5) Cotton Cleaning Factories. —There are three cotton cleaning factories in Meshed which belong to Malkan Artunian, Hazrai and Artush Pashaiar respectively. In Nishapur there are 4 cotton cleaning factories. In Sabzawar there are 3 cotton cleaning factories. In Jawain there is 1 cotton cleaning factory. In Mainabad, near Jawain, 1 cotton cleaning factory. In Darajaz (Muhammadabad) there are 2 cotton cleaning factories. All the above factories belong to the Persian and Armenian merchants who are also Persian subjects. (6) Cotton Seed Oil Extraction Factory for Soap Making -— Factory. ^ In Meshed ..... 1 In Darajaz . . . . .1 -A ' ■ '' - (7) Tannery .—There is only one leather factory in Meshed. It has modern German equipment and appears to be doing well. Its leather looks excellent. For army boot soles buffalo hide is imported from India and a generous foundation of wood is inserted. (8) Fruit Canning.—The hand operated fruit canning concern flourishes and the embargo on -the importation of foreign tinned fruit was quickly availed of. The outturn in the year (1312 Persian) was some 54,000 tins worth 162,000 Rials. The tin sheets are imported from India. \ (b) New Industries, Nil. (c) Lapse of Old Industries. —Nil, except as already reported in 7(a) above regarding carpets. (d) Government Encouragement.- —The Govern ment exerted pressure on merchants to open up factories but gave no other encouragement. c&gt; (e) Electricity.- —Meshed still has a number of electric supply concerns With small plants which give fairly satisfactory work. Electric current is available from sunset to midnight. •:* onq — m.j ■ :&lt;)((,•-.; - ,'h:&gt; qi-r/L;..., ..a no'*6 &gt; 'R1e&lt;Hi‘ie WorksJiops wefe ' Tec&lt;*tt'fly' opened ; At Meshed, Muhammadabad (Darajaz), Sabzhtv’ar • ami Nishapur.

(g) Development of Mines .—The salt mines con tinue to be worked. The coal mines at Ak Darband and Sharifabad have now been worked for several years and their coal is being used in the city in the form of briquettes. The Turquoise mines near Nishapur have not been producing to the same extent as in past years, which is only to be expected under present trade conditions and world economic depression. 8. Communications and Transport. (a) State of Communications Generally .—There is little change in the state of the roads of Khorasan and they are comparatively good. Most of the Meshed transport was supplied from the Garage-i- Hussaini; services to Tehran were not so regularly maintained as last year. Communications in Khorasan generally showed little improvement during the year under report ; the telegraph department still works more by faith than by good works and telegrams continue to be badly mutilated or are wrongly routed or never get delivered. The telephone system in Meshed City is still in its infancy and is not yet reliable and is still a matter of ring and shout. (6 and c) Construction of New Roads and Upkeep of Old .—In the Khorasan province the only road construction work undertaken during the year under report is an alignment from Lutfabad to Kuchan and a further road from Meshed to Fariman, a dis tance of 14 farsakhs (56 miles) which has been com pleted. This latter was built in view of the Shah’s impending visit in the autumn of 1934. {d) Average Rates, Summer and Winter, on Chief Trade Routes.—The road transport rates for mer chandise by motor lorry were as follows :— Per Tabrizi Minimum Maximum Kharwar of lbs. Rials. Rials. Meshed-Tehran . 650 170 190 Tehran-Meshed . 650 95 120 Meshed- Baj giran 650 40 60 Bajgiran-Meshed 650 70 85 Meshed-Zahidan . 650 120 230 Zahidan-Meshed 650 140 210 Carpets are charged at a higher rate and almonds at a lower rate than other merchandise. The charge for 100 mans (650 lbs weight)' of carpet^ from Meshed to Zahidan, for instance, was Rials 230, but for the same amount of almonds'it was 120 Rials onlyU « 3 -n-3 (e) Effect of Motors on Animal Transport, Rates and Turk over.^-Animal transport has been Entirely eliminated from the market by motor transport whifch is run at cut throat rates in these times of shortage of merchandise. 1 ' 1 ' ^ v '.') • ^ v -v (f) towes:—Nil. 3 k w c'T- (g) Security .—Excellent along all the roads main and otherwise. There were occasional encounters between Persian and Russian preventive officials and smugglers on the Perso-Russian and Perso- Afghan frontiers. 9. Social. (a) Standard of Living .—The standard of living has improved by 75 per cent on 2 years ago. Though money is tight cleanliness and dress have greatly improved. This is due to the greater freedom of women who are obtaining emancipation though slowly in this Holy City. (h) Unemployment. —Nil. On account of improve ments in the city, new roads and work in the coal mines. In fact labour has to be imported into Meshed from the neighbouring villages. (c) Evidence of Emigration .—Some 35,000 Russian refugees (Turkoman) entered Khorasan. All were passed on to other districts. The winter took a terrible toll from these unfortunates and thousands died. 600 to 700 Russian Bokharan Jews escaped into Khorasan towards the end of 1933. After 5 months in Meshed they were removed to the Western pro vinces of Persia. All hope to obtain permission to enter Palestine, but so far only a few have been approved. {d) Public Health and Hygiene. — Meshed .—Half of the city now has piped water. The streets are very clean and continually being watered by motor water carts cum fire engine or hand from the gutters. The Rais-i-Baldieh (Mayor) (Mahum) came with the Governor General in January 1934 and has done excellent work and has spent a great deal of money with good results. The hospitals are as last year. Work on the new Shrine Hospital (300 beds) is being pressed day and night in order that it may be opened by H. I. M. the Shah in 1934. So far 6,500,000 Rials have been spent on its construction and another 150,000 may complete it. Zabul .—The Consulate Hospital and Dispensary continued the excellent work under Captain G. Fausitt Taylor, I.M.S., who is also His Majesty’s Vice-Consul with Sub-Assistant Surgeon Jamadar Mian Ghulam Ali as assistant.APPENDIX D.

Annual Commercial Report for the Provinces of Sistan and Kam, including Zahidan and the Sarhad, for the Persian Year March 1932—March 1933. Introductory Notes. Except where specially stated the figures in this report are based on Conversion Rates as follows : Rials 766-20 equal Rupees 100. Rials 102-55 equal £1. One Rial is the equivalent of one Kran. One Batman equals 6^ lbs. When comparing figures with those of previous years reports the variation in Conversion rates should be borne in mind ; the rates adopted for past reports were :— 1930- 31 .. Krans 468 equal Rupees 100. 1931- 32 .. Rials 615-10 equal Rupees 100. This report covers the Persian year, i.e., 21st March 1932 to 20th March 1933. The weights of the various commodities imported and exported have been compiled from statistics of the Nushki-Nok-kundi branch of the North Western Railway of India, while values are based on invoices for imports and on the accepted Customs valuation for Exports. The figures do not entirely correspond to those published by the Persian Customs Department for in some cases goods exported are customed at Meshad, and again, goods imported via the Railway dre not necessarily cleaned from the Customs within the period covered by the Report, or alternatively, in the case of Exports, may be customed but not actually carried out of the country till a later date. Appendix A to this report shows the total Imports and Exports during the year together with the figures for the two previous years. In comparing values the variation in Conversion rates should be borne in mind. Appendix B supplies details of Imports and Exports for various commodities. Appendix C consists of a comparative statement of Imports of commodities from British Empire sources and those of Foreign origin. Appendix D consists of a table showing distances and average freight rates during the year under report. MC202FD General conditions of Trade. —The Trade Mono- , poly Law continued to operate throughout the year and the many difficulties with which traders had to contend, and which were referred to in detail in the Report for 1931-32 were still in exist ence, and the only alleviation was the abolition of the Exchange Restrictions which brought bazaar rates into closer relationship with the Bank rates, as a result of which the Banks were enabled to resume exchange business. Commodities became ] relatively cheaper and a larger trade turnover ' resulted. The lowest rate for the year at Zahidan was Rials 673 equal Rupees 100 and the highest was Rials 800 equal Rupees 100. The effect of the Trade Monopoly Law has been to steadily decrease imports. Exports have been artificially stimulated, merchants covering their losses in exports by the profit realised either on the sale of corresponding imports or on the sale of the licenses to import (issued in return for goods exported) which licenses have been sold at a pre mium varying from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent. Under the Trade Monopoly Law importation of articles, mostly of the ‘ luxury ’ type is totally prohibited, and a law brought into effect on the 1st of the Persian year (21st March 1933) enabling the State to confiscate and sell any remaining stocks of such articles, caused traders to hastily dispose of such goods generally at a slight loss. As a result of the Monopoly Law stocks of these goods were already so reduced that the loss incurred was inconsiderable. Early in the year an inquiry was held in connec tion with suspected irregularities in the Zahidan Customs. It was discovered that, with the conni vance of some of the Persian Customs Officials certificates of export had been issued several times over in respect of a single export consignment and such certificates were sold and goods to the value imported. A number of traders and officials were convicted. As a result of the grant of a monopoly for the import of sugar and matches to the U. S. S. R. trading concerns, stocks of sugar were exhausted at Zahidan and for a time the price rose to Rials 750 par bag of 225 lbs. Matches also rose to 8 Sfiahis per box. Towards the close of the year B2 J / permission to import sugar was granted and a scheme is to be put into operation whereby the State will import sugar direct from Belgium and sell through Agents. In spite of prohibition of export, Silver coin steadily left the country by irregular means and there was a constant shortage of silver in the bazaars throughout East Persia. Retail traders sell at about 20 per cent, less for payment in Silver than for payment in notes. The shortage of silver coin has caused considera- able hardship to the poor, traders having no change will not sell goods to a less value than Rials 5, the smallest note, and in a country where this sum represents f days pay of an unskilled labourer few poor persons can afford to spend more than a Rial or two at a time. Imports. General Comments .—The effect of the Trade Mo nopoly Law is very evident from the following figures:— Weight of Imports in Indian Maunds 1929-30. Weight of Imports during year under Report 1932-33. Alcoholic Beverages and Scents 1,415-6 18-5 Matches .. .. .. 881-3 Nil, Wood 3,272-8 22 Candles .. 106-6 38-1 Motor Tyres 2,340-9 818-5 Fruits (other than dates) 1,471-5 83-5 Sugar (a)* 39,781-6 [b) 1889 Clothing .. 973-4 14-6 Haberdashery 2,343-3 189-5 Chemicals 2,058-8 458 Motors and Bicycles 15,632-5 555-75 The following commodities only show a noticeable increase :— Vegetable Oils 59-2 472-7 Mineral Oils 3,028 39,157-3 Lanterns .. 316-1 535-3 Glassware 844-8 1,414-5 The above commodities have been selected to show the principle deviations which have resulted from the Monopoly Law. Imports of Commodities not mentioned have not been materially affected by the Law. Exports. General Comments .—The following increases which may be directly attributed to the effects of the Monopoly Law are noteworthy :— Weight exports in 1929-30 in Indian Maunds. Weight exported in year under report 1932-33. Cereals .. &gt;. .(a)| 276-0 12,133-4 Butter Clarified (Ghee) 1,262-7 6,656-4 Almonds and Nuts 16,233-0 53,292-5 Dried Fruits 5,887-9 15,761-5 Cotton 1,704-8 7,806 Silk Cloth 726-6 1,551-6 Carpets .—Exports of Carpets shows an increase over 1929-30 which was a ‘ Slump ’ year but a progressive decrease thereafter. The export of the following commodities shows a considerable decrease since the introduction of State Trade Monopoly. 1929-30. 1932-33. Spices 58,399-9 9,536 Drugs (Chiefly Drugs) 13,398-86 8,574-5 Wool 4,807-3 20-5 Note. —Wool was heavily bought Up by U.S. S. R. Furs 1,716-3 144 Skins 7,942-6 618 A study of the above figures reveals that whereas Imports have greatly fallen off, Exports have been stimulated with the exception of some of the ‘ luxury ’ articles of export such as furs, skins, etc., which have doubtless suffered from the falling demand in Europe as a result of the world slump in trade. Satisfactory as these figures must appear to the Persians, there is, however, the proverbial ‘ fly in the ointment Of the Exports which have so satisfactorily increased very few commodities could be disposed of at a profit—many are deliberately exported at a loss—this loss is recouped by increased cost of goods imported, which increase falls on the Persian consumer. If, there fore, foreign goods imported have decreased in quantity they have greatly increased in cost. . * Note.— I The figure for (a) in 1930-31 was 133,199-7. ' . ^ . 2.

The roads in East Persia are being steadily improved and reductions in prices of British lorries and cars should make it possible for an opening to be made in this line. At present the market is entirely American and American firms have Agents in the principal towns. There are no Agents for British cars in East Persia and the entire absence of any advertising of British cars in the vernacular is a great disadvantage. It is believed that British motor-cycles with side cars might find a market if suitably advertised. The Agents of British firms in India are quite unenterprising as regards Persia, know nothing of the conditions, and so frequently fail to supply spare parts for British cars that it is hopeless to purchase a car of British manufacture while relying on Indian Agencies to supply spare parts when required. Failing direct representation in Persia, which at the present stage would probably be unremunera- tive, Agents at Quetta working with a Sub-Agent at Zahidan or Meshad and able to supply spares at short notice would be of the greatest advantage. The few owners of British cars here, at present, have to rely on Agents as far away as Delhi, Bombay, or Calcutta, and more often than not such Agents are unable to supply spares urgently. New Trade Channels. Nil. Popularity of Foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc. Price is always the determining factor. The population is too impoverished to consider quality except when goods of equal price are compared. Agents of American motor firms in India have Sub-Agencies in Persia. Formerly Easy Terms w r ere granted, but these have now been greatly restricted. Openings for British Goods. See £ New items of Trade ’ above. The forwarding of British interest is difficult in the absence of local Agents. It is questionable whether establishment of any Agency would pay at present, trading conditions being so abnormal under the Monopoly Law. Representatives of firms visiting India might, however, take advantage of establishing relations by a personal visit, by returning to Europe via the East Persia route. In this connection the advice and assistance of His Majesty’s Consuls resident in the provinces should be sought. Information regarding the route, India-Persia-Iraq can be sup plied on application to :— 1. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General, Meshad. 2. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain. Growth of Foreign Competition and danger to British interests therefrom. Nil. Persian Trading Methods. The working of the Perso-Russian Trading Agreement became increasingly unpopular and during the last quarter of the year Persian mer chants in East Persia boycotted Russian goods and all trade with Russia was virtually at a standstill. Credit offered by Foreign firms as opposed to that granted by British firms. 3. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Zahidan. Overtrading. Conditions are so uncertain that no overtrading has been indulged in. Commercial Morality. The standards are so entirely at variance with that recognised in the British Empire that British firms are advised to seek the advice of His Majesty’s Consuls before entering into business relations with unknown firms. Working of Law Courts in Commercial Cases. Under present conditions the grant of credit by British firms unrepresented by reliable local Agents cannot be recommended. Goods should be quoted F. 0. B. Karachi (India) payment being effected against documents through a Bank there. Traders in East Persia are in touch with forwarding Agents at Karachi. MC202FD Judged by European standards the Courts cannot be regarded as efficient. Procedure is involved, Legal Advisers with an adequate know ledge of the Law are non-existent. Appeals may be to a Court 600 miles distant by road and the expenses involved in contesting small cases is prohibitive. b2i 4 Financial. The uncertainty of the future and Government restrictions on trade rendered money tight. Sup pliers abroad were generally unwilling to grant credit. Until the Exchange Law was abrogated the Banks sold very little Foreign exchange. Evidence of private capital unemployed or held abroad. There is no evidence of much private capital held abroad, but the amount of private capital unemployed and on deposit in Banks has increased owing to the abnormal trading conditions. Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice-vensa. Capital diverted from trade is mainly unem ployed. Bankruptcies. No large failures, but a considerable number of petty traders and middle-men have gone out of business. Competition among Local Banks. No comments. Taxation. (a) Effect on 'purchasing power .—The purchas ing power of the masses has steadily decreased. High customs dues and monopoly taxes, numerous petty expenses incident to the requirements of the Monopoly Law, petty taxation, the necessity for finding “ Douceurs ” to expedite the transactions with the various Government Departments, etc., and finally the importers recovery of his losses on exports, all eventually fall on the consumer and depress purchasing power. The greater part of the inhabitants of East Persia are cultivators and the value of their crops has greatly fallen during the last two years. (h) Incidence of Taxation. —The burden of taxa tion is passed on both by traders and landowners to the poorer classes. Tax Collection is subject to grave irregularities and the rich frequently escape while the poorer classes are fully taxed. (c) Interference and obstruction on the part of Tax Collectors. —Orderly collections as known in Europe, does not exist in the provinces. It is largely a matter for bargaining and opportunities for irre gularities are frequent.. Military. (а) Commandeering of Transport. —No comman deering on an extensive scale took place. A few incidents occurred of oppression of drivers of hired lorries. (б) Extortion or interference with trade and In dustry. —Petty extortion is common. (c) Effects of Conscription. —Numbers conscript ed are insufficient to greatly affect either com merce or agriculture. Agriculture. (а) Area under cultivation. —No reliable figures are available but the total crop in Sistan was esti mated at roughly 40,000 tons of which 2/3rds were wheat and l/3rd barley. The cotton crop amounted to 34|- tons, and miscellaneous crops, melons, vegetables, etc., were approximately 35 tons. The main crop (wheat and barley) was smaller than last year. This was partly due to dislocation of agriculture as a result of re-distribution of land by the State and partly due to the poor prices ruling for grain, the bulk of last seasons stock being still in hand. One-third of the produce accrued to the State as Be venue. In the case of wheat and barley cash payment of 6/7 Tomans was accepted for two Khar wars Sistan (one Kharwar l ftQ’d lbs.) one of wheat and one of barley. No figures are available for the province of the Qainat. The Bevenue was compounded and the total demand was 63,500 Tomans. Air the present rate of exchange 10 Tomans approximately equal one pound sterling. (б) Introduction of new crops and new methods .— Modern Bussian. ploughs, a few of which were ex perimented with in Qain, proved unsuccessful in the hands of the unskilled peasants. Saffron, although not a new crop in the Qainat, is being more extensively cultivated owing to the slump in grain prices. (c) Harm done by the interference of authorities .— Impossible to estimate. Land in Sistan hitherto cultivated by the Sardars of Baluch tribes who settled there some centuries ago and were until recently practically independ ent, have been taken from them by the State5 &gt; . \ and re-distributed in small holdings. The small holders are entirely without capital and it is not yet clear whether it will be the policy of the Gov ernment to grant the land in freehold, in which case some general improvement in agriculture may result, or whether each individual will remain only a tenant of the State, who can be evicted at will, in which case a decline can be anticipated, since the holders will have little permanent in terest and whereas the previous holders, the Sardars, were men of some capital, the peasant holders will be unable to carry on cultivation after even one bad season. An effort is being made to encourage the cultivation of gardens, and plots have been allotted and in some cases saplings and seed provided free. No land has been given to confirmed opium smokers, but as probably 75/80 per cent, of the population is addicted to this vice, only the really hopeless cases have been rejected. Roads are under construction with a view to linking the great Sistan granary with other parts of Persia and given a progressive policy in regard to land tenure and an improvement in the distri bution of water, the province of Sistan will be capable of great development. An experimental Government garden has been established and for the time being the water tax for gardens has been remitted. Irrigation. In Sistan, the dispute mentioned in last year’s report, between the Persian and Afghan Govern ments in regard to the distribution of the water of the Helmand River, has not yet been ended. Meanwhile the water supply for Sistan has been abundant, and owing to faulty methods of distri bution probably 1/3 to \ of the water is wasted, causing extensive innundations from which a good deal of damage annually results. The water supply of the Qainat, which area is entirely dependent on underground tunnels con veying water from sources in the hills, known as 4 Karez ’ depends on the abundance or otherwise of the water snowfall. Water was exceptionally scarce in the summer of 1932, but the ensuing winter brought heavy snow and much rain and the prospects for the summer of 19^3 are much brighter. Heavy and late rains here resulted in extensive sowing of 4 catch ’ crops. Extent to which land hypothecated. No information available. MC202FD Opium. (а) Part -played in economic life. —In Sistan a very high percentage, probably 80 per cent, or more of the inhabitants are addicted to the drug. Its use is also widespread in the Qainat, although not to such an extent as in Sistan. (б) Crop. — Sistan. At the season of the cultivation of the poppy cultivators w T ere notified that this crop was to be totally prohibited. Nevertheless a number of persons grew poppies in gardens, but the crop was subsequently des troyed by the authorities. The Government Depot for the sale of opium w r as also closed. This action cannot be taken as evidence of a change of policy, since it has not been taken elsewhere. It is in connection with the plans for the development of Sistan, and reflects a desire on the part of the State to improve the state of health of the local cultivators, large numbers of whom are rendered incapable of work. As smuggled opium, derived from Afghanistan is easily obtainable, it will require a lengthy period of prohibition before any beneficial results will become apparent. It is also estimated that stocks of opium exist sufficient to maintain the required supply for some years. The price will, however, inevitably rise, and its use consequently be restricted. In the Qainat the opium received in the State Depots amounted to 15 Kharvars (Tabriz) for which the rate of 107 Rials per Tabrizi Man (6| lbs.) was paid. One Tabrizi Kharvar is the equivalent of 650 lbs. It is estimated that only about of the crop reached the Government Excise Depot and that some 45 Kharvars of opium were concealed. A further 10 Kharvars of opium is known to have been smuggled from Afghanistan. Smuggled opium retails at 220—280 Rials per man. The Excise Depot sold about 75 Tabrizi Mans of opium during the year, while it is estimated that 55 Tabirizi Kharvars of opium w T as disposed of. (c) Working of the Monopoly Service. —As regards smuggling, see above. In November annually licenses to cultivate are granted,6 In April a Comraisssion of Excise Officials and locally engaged appraisers inspect the crops and estimate the yield to be delivered to the Excise Depot. The Officials employed are generally venal, and the estimation bears little relation to the real extent of the crop. In 1932, practically all of the officials both of the Estimation Committee and of the local Depot were tried for corruption and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment or dismissal. (i) Apparent policy of Persian Government in regard to production and consumption. —For local action taken in Sistan in connection with the developnjent scheme see above. No steps are taken elsewhere in East Persia to limit the crop. For notes on the various forms of opium in use see page 6 paragraph {i) of the Report for 1931 -32. Industry. Ineffectual efforts are made to check the smoking of the extract of opium known as ‘ Shera ’. The punishment admissible by law is as follows :— For being in possession of smuggled opium or its extract, For the first Miskal a foie of Pdals 52 plus Rials 5 for each additional Miskal. In addition one day’s imprisonment for each Miskal. Imprisonment can be compounded for by payment of Rials 5 per diem. For being in possession of a lamp for opium smoking Rials 52. In the Qainat 18,000 Tomans were collected in fines during the year. The excise officials constantly raid suspected houses, and the system allows of much petty oppression and information is frequently lodged with the authorities as the result of petty spite. It may be assumed that the sums levied by corrupt officials at least equalled the a,mount credited to the Treasury. (d) Collection of the Crude, —As described above the crude is collected by the cultivators them selves, and the ‘ estimated ’ quantity is sold to the Excise Depot. (e) The Export Trade. —No Opium is directly exported from Sistan and Kain, but part of the crop is annually bought by merchants in Meshad for export. (/) Effects of increased taxation. —Nil. (g) Smuggling. —Is everywhere rife—See above. (h) Local Consumption. —See above for quanti ties produced and smuggled imports. About 70/80% per cent, is consumed locally. (а) State of Industry generally. —It was stated in the last annual report that the Hand-Made Carpet Industry had benefited from the Monopoly Law. The benefit was short-lived. In the desire to export Persian goods to secure licenses for imports which could be disposed of at a profit, all and sundry' rushed to export carpets, often of a very inferior quality which were deliberately sold abroad at a loss. This iaspite of the fact that the European markets were swamped and the large exporting firms had seen fit to close down. The inevitable result has been that the market abroad is glutted and carpets can now only be exported at a loss, which cannot be recovered on imports. With the exception of a few unexpired contracts, at the end of the year the small factories in the Qainat and Sistan were producing very few carpets, mainly for use in Persia. No immediate improvement can be foreseen and the Monopoly Law may be said to have weakened, if not killed, the one staple industry of East Persia. (б) New Industries. —Nil. (c) Lapse of Industries. —See (a) as regards the slump in the carpet making industry. {d) Electricity. —Very little used. The electric supply station at Birjand, mentioned in last year’s report is now working satisfactorily. The town supply at Zabul (Sistan) is privately owned but is part of the development scheme, the Government has remitted Municipal taxation at Zabul and is defraying the cost of Municipal lighting. (e) Demands for Foreign Machinery. —The general dullness of trade and uncertainty of the future has delayed several schemes for import of foreign machinery. (f) Development of Mines. —Nil.7 Communications and Transport. (а) State of ‘Communications generally .— There is no railway in East Persia. The main Zahidan-Meshad road has been credit ably maintained and is yearly improving. The improvement is to some extent due to the heavy falling off of traffic. Before the Monopoly Law, a traveller between Birjand and Zahidan might expect to pass 30/40 lorries on the road and now 2 or 3 only are met. The Zahidan-Zabul road has deteriorated and is no more than a track liable to become impassable from 24 hours rain and frequently flooded. (б) Construction of New Roads. —In connection with the Sistan development scheme a new metalled road is in course of construction. The earthwork has been completed for a distance of some 25/30 miles and metalling is ready to be laid. When the road is completed the authorities intend to construct a road from Zabul northwards to join the existing Zahidan-Meshad road near Shush]). That portion of the Zahidan-Meshad road which lies between Shushp and Hormuk, will then be abandoned and all traffic will pass through Zabul. (c) Upkeep of old roads. —Temporary repairs only are effected. {d) Average rates on Chief Trade Routes. —See Appendix D to this report. (e) Effects of Motors on Annual transport rates .— Motors have superseded animal transport on main routes except for seasonal transport of grain from Sistan to Zahidan and Qain and between Persia and Afghanistan. (/) Air Service—NA. (g) Security. —There have been no serious raids on the mam roads, but animal caravans have occasionally met with robbers on the Zabul- Zahidan desert track. Social. {a) Standard of Living. —Very low. While that of the official classes is perhaps slowly rising, the peasantry remain in a condition of serfdom. Such small luxuries as tea and sugar have increased so greatly in price as a result of the Monopoly Law that they cannot, to any extent, be enjoyed by the peasantry. (b) Unemployment.—No statistics available. A large number of petty traders in the towns have been compelled to close business as a result of the Monopoly Law. There is no organised relief for unemployed. (c) Evidence of Emigration. —Nil. {d) Public Health and Hygiene. —No statistics available. Malaria hitherto unknown at Zabul (Sistan) has become endemic during the past two years. Both typhoid and a particularly virulent tjqje of influenza were epidemic in Sistan and some cases of small-pox occurred in Qain. An infectious disease, as yet undiagnosed, has been epidemic at Sistan. A slightly sore throat is followed by low temperature for some days, accompanied by rheumatism. The patient slowly recovers, rema ning weak and the liver is entirely inactive for a varying period of convalescence. (e) Municipal Services. —Very primitive and usually confined to the minimum of street cleaning and lighting. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain.

Annual Commercial Report for the Provinces of Sistan and Kain, including Zahidan and the Zarhad, for the Persian Year 1931 -32. Intrcductory Notes. Except where specially stated the figures in this Repopt are based on Conversion rates as follows :— fiaAi . .... 615-10=Rupees 100 ...... 82-90=£l Conversion rates adopted in the Reports for previous years were :— 1929- 30 . . . Krans 427-3=Rupees 100 1930- 31 . . . „ 468 = „ 100 One Rial (new currency introduced during the current year) is the equivalent of one Kran. When comparing figures with those of previous years the variation of Conversion rates should be borne in mind. This Report covers the Persian year 1310, i.e., 21st March 1931—20th March 1932. The weights of the various commodities Imported and Exported have been compiled from statistics of the Nushki-Zahidan branch of the North Western Railway, while values are based on Invoices for Imports, and on the accepted Customs valuation for Exports. The figures do not necessarily entirely agree with statistics which may be published by the Persian Customs Department for in some cases goods Exported are Customed at Meshed and again goods Imported via the Railway are not necessarily cleared from Customs within the period covered by the Report, or alternatively, in the case of Exports, may be Customed but not actually carried out of the country till a later date. Appendix A to this report shows the total Imports and Exports during the year together with the figures for the two previous years. In comparing values the variation in Conversion rates should be borne in mind. Appendix B supplies details of Imports and Exports for various commodities. Appendix C consists of a Comparative Statement of Injports of commodities from British Empire sources and those of Foreign origin. Appendix D is a table showing distances and aver age freight rates during the year under report. j (a) General Conditions of Trade. —The trade of East Persia may be said to have suffered during the year almost every vicissitude imaginable. The immediate efiects of the Persian Government’s Trade Monopoly Law with which was combined control of Foreign Exchange was to create difficulties which appeared almost insurmountable. The rates fixed for Foreign Exchange were un economic and in consequence Banks were unable to sell foreign currency in amounts sufficient to meet merchants’ requirements. Although private transactions in Exchange were prohibited by law a certain amount of business was continually done in the Bazaars but on terms differ ing very widely from the official fixed rates. The Monopoly Law aimed at balancing the Foreign trade of Persia, required merchants to export goods to enable them to obtain Import licenses. Nor was this the only hampering restriction, for a lengthy list of articles, mostly of a luxury nature, were declared as totally prohibited. Difficulties were enhanced by the fact that the few Persian products available for export could not be disposed of abroad at a profit. Nevertheless, in the general scramble to export in order to import commodities which realised a good profit merchants tried, one after another, exports of the various Persian products, which in the majority of cases they sold at a loss in the hope that such losses would be more than recouped by profits on the corre- ; spending Imports. A further set-back occurred in the autumn. It arose from the uncertainty in connection with the Railway which operated from British India to Zahidan (formally known as Duzdap). This un certainty still exists. In the autumn, consequent on difficulties which arose in regard to the working of the Railway on that section which was within Persian territorial limits, the Government of India felt reluctantly obliged to cease the Railway service. Since no suitable terminal station existed near the frontier, Railhead had to be withdrawn to Nok-Kundi at a distance of 86 miles within the British-Indian frontier and 136 miles from Zahidan. Merchandise had consequently to be transported between Zahidan-Kundi and vice versa by Motor Transport. The desert track, hitherto scarcely used for Motor transport, has rapidly deteriorated under the strain of continual traffic consisting mainly of grossly overloaded lorries.2 As will be seen from the table—Appendix D— violent fluctuations in freight rates occurred. In fact rates fluctuated greatly from day to day. This factor, combined with fluctuations in Foreign Ex change, the difficulty in obtaining Foreign currency to finance Imports, and the inordinate delays suffered in obtaining Import Licenses from the Central Board of Control combined also with frequent and sudden changes in Customs dues and alterations and modi fications of the Monopoly Law, brought about a state of affairs in which no merchant could, with any degree of certainty, estimate What Would be the state of the market even a month hence, still less could it be estimated after the considerable lapse of time which must elapse between the date of application for a license to Import and the actual arrival of goods in the country—a period of several months. No sooner did the market, for some Persian pro duct, in India or Europe, slightly improve, to an extent which lessened the loss on disposal of such an Export, or at the best allowed of a meagre profit, than merchants in their eagerness to qualify for Import Licenses,' rushed to purchase for Export. Internal prices would immediately rise, while the Foreign market would fall and after a short burst of Export the scramble to find an alternative commo dity for Export would begin afresh. The operations of the Monopoly Law allowed of many irregularities which were detrimental to trade. Applications for Import of articles on the £ Autho rised ’ List Were considered in accordance with quarterly quotas fixed for each Port of Entry by the Central Authorities, and such applications had to be supported by the Local Governor’s attestation as to the financial standing of the applicant. So much delay occurred in obtaining the necessary permit that the state of the market had often varied in the meantime and the permit could not be pro fitably used. Applications by post produced no result, nor did telegraphic reminders elicit replies. In consequence traders had generally to visit Tehran j personally to obtain licenses, the cost of which I journey had to be charged in the sale price of goods. A lively trade in fictitious licenses sprung up. Tehran traders who had no desire to Import obtained permits which they sold at the Ports at 17 per cent. —25 per cent, premium. In July 1931 large quantities of £ prohibited ’ articles which Were lying in the Customs, having been Imported prior to the Monopoly Law, had to be re-exported to avoid confiscation. As a consequence of the exceptional state of •iff airs outlined above there Were considerable fiuctutations in the quantities of various articles Imported and Exported, as compared with previous years. The principal deviations from normal are commented on in the analysis below :— Imports. il Svgar .—A very heavy decrease in the quantity imported as compared with 1930-31 is noticeable—■ from 133,199 Indian Maunds to approximately 18,900 Maunds. In the report for 1930-31 reasons were given for the somewhat abnormal increase in that year. The large decrease during the cu^^t year may be attributed to :— (a) General overstocking which had resulted from abnormal imports in 1930-31. (b) The fact that under the Monopoly Law a definite quota is allocated to each Port of Entry which cannot be exceeded. (c) Some revival of competition by Eussia in the North. By the close of the year Imports of this commo dity via Zahidan had practically ceased, and since the Persian Government has recently granted an Import Monopoly to a Foreign Power, it may be assumed that this trade will cease on the India- Zahidan route. Tea .—There was a slight decrease in total Imports, and at the close of the year it was generally estimated that the market in the interior was fully stocked. Machinery .—The forecast in the report for 1930- 31, that Imports would be likely to increase, has not proved correct. Although it is the avowed policy of the Government to encourage local manufactures, and several schemes were contemplated in East Persia, none of these were brougut to fruition. The difficulty of obtaining Foreign Exchange undoubtedly had an adverse effect. As an example it may be mentioned that an Oil engine, of U. K. origin, which was imported for a Town Electricity Scheme remained nearly the whole year uncleared from Customs, the owner in the first place being unable to purchase sterling to efiect payment and secondly, unsuccessful, for many months in obtaining an Import License. Alcoholic Beverages and Scents .—Falling under the heading of ‘ Luxury ’ articles, the Import of which is practically prohibited Imports fell to a negligible figure. Motor Tyres .—In 1930-31 the Monopoly Law was little understood and worked inefficiently. There was a heavy decrease in that year and the market was depleted, a natural increase has followed. Cereals .—Consequent on good harvests and very small export, Imports except of small quantities of Seed grain for experimental purposes were Nil. Vegetables .—A considerable part of the vegetables Imported in previous years was for consumption at Zahidan, where the nature of the soil is such that none can be grown. Vegetables are now in the prohibited list, as a result of which the lot of the inhabitants of Zahidan is far from enviable.'Clothing. —Is another prohibited or at least res tricted Import and the trade has virtually ceased. Mineral Oils. —Some decrease is noticeable. Motor Vehicles engaged on the Zahidan-Kundi route obtain their requirements in India—Imports are for the interior of Persia. Cotton Thread.-—k considerable increase of Imports the fact that this was one of the commodities which yielded a profit as a result of increased demand for the Carpet Industry which slightly improved during the year. (Note. —No such improvement is evident from the Export figures for Carpets via Zahidan. This is due to the fact that Exports were deflected to other ports owing to the prohibitive transport rates existing after the withdrawal of the railway.) Textiles—Piece Goods—Mainly Woollen. —An un expected expansion of Imports occurred. 1930-31 was an exceptionally bad year, and it may be assumed that stocks were low. For Cotton Piece-Goods see remarks under Russian competition. Byes. —A marked increase. The comments under Cotton Thread, in respect of the Carpet Industry, apply to this commodity. Motors and Bicycles [including Spare Parts).— A large fall in value of Imports principally in Spare Parts for Motors. Exports. Cereals. —A considerable increase over 1930-31 which under present conditions is likely to continue. Large stocks of grain exist in East Persia and recent exchange fluctuations have enabled exports to be profitably made to India. Dried Fruits. —A heavy fall compared with last year due to competition in Indian markets by Afghanistan. Late in the year the Persians adopted better methods of packing and grading and the trade is increasing. Cotton. —The cultivation of Cotton in East Persia has increased, and in the search for commodities for export to obtain Import Licenses, this crop has attracted some attention. Considerable stocks exist in the Sistan area, which owing to the deplorable state of the road to Zahidan and consequent high freights, cannot be profitably exported : Expecta tions of the establishment of Cotton Spinning plant at the principal town of Zabul have not been fulfilled. Wool. —The stimulation of the Monopoly Law led to some increase of export, but high freights to the Railhead mitigate against much expansion. The bulk of the East Persian crop is transported North to Russia. Carpets. —The industry has somewhat revived as compared with 1930-31. The decrease of exports via Zahidan is due-to enhanced transport rates to Railhead, resulting in export being deflected to other ports of exit. Such carpets as were exported Were, in the tfiain, of the cheaper qualities for the Indian market, where they have been disposed of at a loss, solely to obtain rights to Import other commodities. Silk Cloth .—Principally Meshed Silks have attract ed particular attention as a line for export to balance imports. The low cost of transport relative to value assists this trade. Furs .—Remarks under Silk Cloth equally apply. Hides.—A remarkable fall in exports due in the main to uneconomic rates. New items of Trade. In spite of the relative set-back in the importation of Industrial Machinery it appears likely, from the policy of the government, to encourage local manu factures that the trade will expand in the near future. There is an increasing tendency among the public of East Persia to regard Motor-cars of U. K. manu facture with favour. The reduction in prices of the leading makes of light cars should now make some market available. Unfortunately none of the leading firms are re presented by local agents and agents in India have no knowledge of local conditions, and in the few cases in which they have supplied cars, have been found unsatisfactory to deal with. Concise illustrated pamphlets in Persian, would in all probability popularise British light cars, but a local agent carrying a reasonable stock of spares is the first essential. New trade channels. Nil. Growth of foreign competition and danger to British interests therefrom. Nil. Russian trading methods. Russian Cotton Piece-goods, although not popular sell readily, since they are cheap and supply the wants of the mass of the population, the purchasing power of which is low. The fact that Russian trade representatives reside in East Persia, whereas U. K. firms are entirely unrepresented by Agents, mitigates against British trade, but low prices are the principal factor. Credit offered hy foreign firms as opposed to those granted hy British firms. Under present conditions the granting of credit by British Firms, unrepresented by reliable local agents, cannot be recommended.4 Goods should be quoted F. 0. B. Karachi (India) payment being effected against documents through a Bank there. Traders in East Persia are invariably in touch with forwarding agents in Karachi. Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc. See the Russians-Trading Methods, above, in regard to Cotton Piece-goods. Motor lorries sold in Persia are entirely of American manufacture. Agents in India have Sub-Agents in East Persia, to whom they grant Easy Terms. The latter have, in the past, sold on the Instalment system, but in view of the uncertain conditions, and difficulty of recovering payment, such facilities are being greatly restricted. Openings for British goods. See New Items of Trade above. In the absence of any local representatives the forwarding of British trade interests is difficult. It must however be admitted that under the con* stantly changing conditions of trade, it is question able whether the establishment of a new-comer as a representative would pay. Advantage might however be taken for represent atives of firms visiting India to travel via Persia and establish relations with British Indian traders established in Persia. In this connection it would be advisable to seek the advice and assistance of H. M. Consular Officers resident in the provinces visited. Information as to the route India to Persia via Quetta-Nokkundi and Zahidan can be supplied on application to H. B. M. s Consul, Sistan and Kain, East Persia. Overtrading. The conditions as described at the beginning of this Report, are so uncertain that no overtrading is now indulged in. Commercial Morality. The standards are so entirely at variance with those recognised in the British Empire, that British Firms are advised to seek the advice of H. M. Consul before entering into business relations with unknown firms. Working of law courts in commercial cases. Judged by European standards, the Provincial Courts cannot be regarded as efficient. Procedure is involved. Legal Advisers with an adequate knowledge of the Law are non-existent. Appeals may lie to a Court situated as much as 600 miles distant by road and the expense involved in contesting a small commercial case is prohibitive. Financial. 2. Tightness of money—to what extent due to res triction of credit, exchange. Insecurity, extra taocation, etc. —Money was unusually tight during the year under report. Owing to the uneconomic rates fixed by the Gov ernment the Banks sold very little Foreign ^ change. Owing to the restrictions of the Monopoly Law Importers found sellers abroad unwilling to afford credit. Insecurity was universally felt due to the frequent changes in the Monopoly Law, sudden enhancements of Customs duties and long delays in securing fresh supplies of goods during which money was locked up. Evidence of private capital unemployed or held abroad. Owing to the dislocation of trade more private money is unemployed than is usual, but judged by European standards such capital is small. There is no evidence of much private capital being held abroad. Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice versa. Nil. Bankruptcies. A considerable number of failures among petty merchants unable to trade with insufficient capital, under present conditions. No failures on a large scale. Competition among Local Banks. No comments of importance. Taxation. 3. (a) Effect on purchasing power. —Customs dues have been subjected to increases amounting to 56 per cent, during the year. The multifarious petty expenses incident to the requirements of the Monopoly Law have increased selling prices of all imported articles. Petty taxation and the necessity of finding 1 Douceurs,’ the result of steadily accumulating new legal enactments, constitute a heavy burden for the masses, always on the verge of penury, and still further decrease their purchasing power. (6) Incidence of taxation.' —The burden of taxation is passed on, both by traders and landowners to the poorer classes. Tax collection is moreover subject to grave irre gularities and the wealthy not infrequently escape lightly while the poorer classes are fully taxed.wmmm rfion, year Jov- Law lord [uent tents lest iked trodi. tivate d ky tpital VOSCI jetty pital, s dues, mg to farious of tie of slf indiag j ne^ jr the i still xation ,ers t° s ino' jsoapo 5 (c) Interference and obstruction on the part of tax Colloctors—Orderly collection of taxation, as known in Europe, does not exist in the Provinces. It is largely a matter of bargaining and opportunities for irregularities are frequent. Military. jL (a) Commandeering of Transport .—A great im' p^Tement has taken place. No cases of unjust commandeering of Motor transport occurred during the year. (b) Extortions or interference with trade and indus try .—Nil. (c) Effects of conscription .—Numbers conscripted insufficient to greatly affect either Commerce or Agriculture. Agriculture. 5. {a) Area under cultivation. —No reliable figures are procurable, but the average total crop (approxi mately 50 per cent. Barley and 50 per cent. Wheat) in Sistan is between 40,000 and 50,000 tons of grain. Summer crops in Sistan are of secondary import ance and consist mainly of Vegetables, Melons and Beans. In the district of the Qainat Summer crops are of paramount importance and Wheat forms the greater part of the c.op, the average total yield being 9,000— 10,0 JO tons. (b) Introduction of new crops and new methods .—* In the Qainat a few landowners have brought into use, in lieu of the Native plough, ploughs manufac tured in ihussia. Limited experiments with Seed-grain imported from India have been carried out. The quality of the flour produced is said to be much higher than that from the indigenous wheat, but insufficient time had elapsed to discover whether the Wheat will prove free from diseases. Fruit tree pests are greatly increasing in the Qainat and as yet no effective steps have been taken to counteract the ravages. ( C ) Harm done by interference of authorities. —Nil. Irrigation. The Sistan area is Irrigated from the Helmand River the source of which is in Afghanistan. During the year under report water was above the average in quantity and abundant crops were harvested. The harvest of the Winter season 1931-32 which was taking place at the close of the year under report is considerably above the average and prices have fallen to a level which has made profitable export to India possible. During the year a dispute arose between the Persian and Afghan Governments in regard to the division of the water of the Helmand River. A Commission examined the state of affairs on the spot, but no final agreement was arrived at. In the Qainat summer crops are irrigated by Karez (underground tunnels conveying water from sources in the hills) the water supply being dependent on the abundance or otherwise of the Winter Snows. The water supply for the Summer of 1931 was normal, but very little Snow fell during the succeed ing Winter and a shortage is anticipated during the approaching Summer. It is however possible that the crops will not be very adversely affected, since abnormally heavy rains fell in the early spring and an area greater than the average has been sown vith ‘ Catch ’ (Rain) crops, which have greatly benefited from the unusually late rains. (/) Extent to which land hypothecated. —No figures are available. Opium. 6. (u) Part played in economic life. —In Sistan a very high proportion, probably 90 per cent, of the inhabitants are addicted to the drug. In the Qainat its use is also widespread though not to such an extent as in Sistan. (6) Crop. —The Crop in Sistan is comparatively small, and is mainly consumed locally—the majority of the crop, owing to negligence of the local officials, never reaches the Government store. In the Qainat in 1931-32 the total received in the Excise Depot was Ten Tabrizi Kharvars (6,500 lbs.) but it is known that this was by no means the full crop, which is estimated to have been roughly double. Owing to the fall in price of Grains, rendering the cultivation of Opium more profitable, the crop at present growing, and which will be harvested in 1932, is likely to considerably exceed that of the year under Report. (c) Working of the Monopoly Service. —Annually in November cultivators obtain the written sanction of the Excise Depot to cultivate Poppies for Opium. In the event of damage to the growing crop appli cation is made for an Inspector to examine and estimate the loss. In April a Commission of Excise Officials and locally engaged Appraisers inspect the crops and the cultivator is informed of the amount of Opium he will be required to deliver to the Excise Depot. By the end of June all such Opium is usually delivered and is paid for by the Government at a fixed rate varying from 14 to 16 Tomans per Tabrizi Maund (6| lbs.). (d) Collection of the crude. —As described in para, (c) the crude is collected by the cultivators them selves and delivered to the Excise Depot.if (e) The Export Trade. —-From Sistan export is negligible. In 1931-32 750 Tabriz! Maunds (4,875 lbs.) were sold by the Excise Depots in the Qainat for Export. The rate at which this was sold to merchants was the same at which purchased from the cultivators. Apart from the legitimate export, a good deal of Opium finds its way over the frontiers from that portion of the crop which never reaches the Excise Depots. (/) Effects of increased taxation. —Nil. (g) Smuggling. —Is everywhere rife. Small areas are cultivated without official sanction. The ‘estimation’ of crops, as described in para, (c) is open to much peculation. The Inspectors are usually venal and the amount estimated seldom approximates to the full crop. Early in the season stocks of smuggled Opium are held in the towns and villages by nearly all the licensed dealers, who keep a small stock of ‘ Excise Depot ’ Opium merely for the purpose of satisfying Inspectors. (h) Local consumption. —The sales of Opium for local consumption average 15 Tabriz! Mans a month {i.e., 97J lbs.) but it is estimated that not less than Ten Tabriz! Kharvars (6,500 lbs.) of undeclared Opium is annually consumed. In years of poor crops local supplies are supplemented by Opium smuggled from Afghanistan. (i) Apparent policy of Persian Government in regard to production and consumption. —No steps are apparently taken to limit production, but sporadic efforts are made in the larger towns to stop the smoking of Opium. Petty Officials derive a regular source of income from bribery in connection with the discovery of smuggled Opium and of crops used for preparing Opium in the form of ‘ Shera ’ for smoking, but no determined effort is made to stop consumption. Any adult is permitted to purchase up to a maxi mum of 16 Miscals of Opium daily from the Excise Depot, but there is no punishment for being found in possession of any quantity of ‘ Excise ’ Opium at a time. The smoking of Opium in the form known as ‘ Bafoor ’ is not discouraged by Law, being con sidered less harmful than )n the form known as ‘Shera.’ ‘ Bafoor ’ is t|be smoking of prepared Opium, while ‘ Shera ’ consists of the smoking of a mixture containing Opium dross. Opium smokers are less frequently encountered than persons addicted to the eatipg of Opium, which habit is very general. It is perhaps curious that 1 whereas Medical science has determined that Opium taken by the Mouth is more deleterious to health than smoking, the Persian Law is aimed only at the curtailment of smoking of the ‘ Dross ’ mixture. The effect on the country classes, who are actively engaged in outdoor labour, is not very marked until au advanced age, but town-dwellers rapidly deterio rate and the hordes of livid and emaciated beggars who infest the streets of the towns in East Persia bear perpetual evidence of the harmful effects of the habit. They are unemployable—there is no sus tained organised relief and large numbers die annu ally from the effects of exposure and starvation during the Winter months. / Industry. {a) State of industry generally. —The Hand-^J^ie Carpet Industry has somewhat revived. In the latter part of the year the demand in Europe for Birjand carpets somewhat improved. Greater care is being exercised in the manufacture as it is realised that in the ‘ Boom ’ period of a few years back much harm was done by the sale of poor work. In the Birjand area the tendency is for the workers (the industry was essentially a Cottage Industry) to be grouped in specially constructed buildings and the output is bought up by locally-formed Companies, which in turn sell to the larger Exporting Companies. The Birjand branch of the Oriental Carpet Com pany (Registered in London) closed during the year. In Sistan the industry is reviving, but the Agency of the Oriental Carpet Company having closed in 1930, the weaving has reverted to a ‘ Cottage In dustry.’ Hitherto Sistan carpets have always been of the recognised ‘ Baluchi ’ patterns, but attempts, which have met with a good measure of success, have been made to reproduce patterns hitherto employed in Kerman, Turkoman and Birjandi carpets. The workmanship is good, and Wool and Labour being extremely cheap, such reproduc tions can be sold cheaper than the originals, but as yet the colour are inclined to be over vivid. The indutsry has benefited by the effects of the Monopoly Law, but such advantages as have ac crued have been partly set off by the increased cost of Cotton-thread and Dyeing materials, which also is a direct result of the Monopoly Regulations. (h) New Industries. —Nil. (c) Lapse of old industries. (d) Electricity. —Very little used. Small town lighting installations exist at Zahidan and Zabul, and machinery (of U. K. origin) for the same purpose is under process of erection at Birjand, (/) Demands for foreign machinery. —Owing to tightness of money, and the restrictions of the Monopoly Law, schemes for the establishment of Cotton Spinning plants have not materialised. ((?) Development of mines. —Nil. Communications and Transport. 8. {a) State of Communications generally. —Very poor. The main Zahidan-Meshed road is subject torapid damage by rains and snow, and is at times impassable in Winter. The Zahidan-Zabul toad is now almost non-existent and is never repaired. (b) Construction of new roads. — Nil. Budget pro' vision has been made for the construction of a nanled road to Zabul from Zahidan, but the scheme is likely to be delayed as the Government have under consideration a plan to connect Zahidan-Zabul- Shusp, (100 miles South of Birjand) by road, and to abandon that portion of the Meshed-Zahidan road lying South of Shusp. (c) Upkeep of old roads. —Very temporary repairs only are effected which suffice to keep the roads passable for traffic. (d) Average rates on chief trade routes. —See Appen dix D. (e) Effect of Motors on Animal Transport Rates .— Motors have superseded animal transport on the main routes, except for seasonal export of grain from Sistan to Qain. Camel transport alone is used between East Persia and Afghanistan. (/) Air services whether used for commercial freights. ■ —Nil. {g) Security. —The main East Persia road Meshed- Zahidan is generally free from marauders, except in the vicinity of Zahidan, where the proximity of Afghan territory facilitates raids by Afghans, Motor traffic is not interfered with, but animal caravans have been subject to attack. The Jahidan-Zabul road which passes through waterless desert tracts is at times rendered unsafe by Afghan raiders. Social. 9. (c) Standard of living. —Very low. The Pea~ santry is in a condition of Serfdom. There is no outlet for energy in the towns and large numbers being addicted to Opium are practically unemploy able. Apart from a small class of Government Officials and Hereditary Landowners who live in a semi- European style, there is scarcely any ‘ Middle-class ’ as understood in Europe, and the bulk of the popu lation lead a hand-to-mouth existence verging on complete destitution. (b) Unemployment. —No statistics available. Conscripts are mainly obtained from the unem ployed in the town. There is no organised relief of any kind. (c) Evidence of emigration. —Nil. (d) Public Health and Hygiene. —No. Statistics available; Malaira is endemic at Zahidan. Typhoid and Influenza (of a particularly severe form leading rapidly to Pneumonia) were epidemic both in Qain and Sistan during the Winter. (e) Municipal Services. —Beyond the minimum of Street cleaning and lighting no Municipal services exist. Spasmodic attempts to control prices of local products are at times made, but are usually abandoned on a strike being declared by the sup pliers. C. K.

I have the honour to forward herewith two copies of my Annual Commercial Report on the provinces of Sistan, the Qainat and districts of Zahidan and the Sarhad, for the year 1930-31. Should the Government of India approve of the Report being printed, I request that I may be supplied with ten copies. Copies of the report have been submitted to His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. HIS MAJESTY’S CONSULATE, SISTAN AND KAIN. Annual Commercial Report for the Provinces of Sistan and the Qainat, including Zahidan (formerly known as Duzdap) and the district of the Sarhad, for the year 1930-31. 1. (a) General conditions of Trade. —Except where otherwise stated, the figures in this report are based on a conversion rate of krans 468 to Rs. 100. The figures for the year 1928-29 were converted at krans 361 ‘6 to Rs. 100 and those for 1929-30 at krans 427-3 per Rs. 100. This should be borne in mind when comparing the figures of the respective years. This report covers the Persian Year 1309, i.e., March 21st, 1930—March 20th, 1931. X Since figures for goods customed at Meshed, but exported via Zahidan, have not been available the figures quoted in this Report are for goods carried by the Railway to and from Zahidan during the period covered by this report. They do not actually agree with the figures which will ultimately be available from the Persian Customs statistics since they record the actual movements of goods to and from the country during the period, whereas the Customs figures are for goods cleared from the Customs during the period, some of which arrived in Persia before the commencement of the year but were not cleared until 1309 (1931). 2. The following table shews the total Import and Export Trade via the Nushki- Zahidan Railway during the period under report together with figures for the two previous years. In this connection attention may be given to the remarks above concerning conversion rates of Rupees to Krans and vice versa. Imports. — Batmans. Indian Maunds. Thousands of Krans.

These figures are for goods actually customed at Zahidan during the period under jpe^brU ■/’Tte'values^ differ materially from figures in Appendix B. Since different rates of cbitversiofi ' MC165FD Letts f • O 11.; L: . jv : ; Rec. 6 JUL19312 were used, the table is of interest as shewing the relative proportion of trade from Great Britain and other Countries. 3. The following is a brief Analysis of the figures for the principal commodities under Imports. | The Monopoly Commodities Sugar and Tea. —The Import of sugar which rose from 855 tons in 1928-29 to 1,420 tons in 1929-30 reached a total of approximately 4,757 tons in the year under review, a figure very nearly ap proaching the average of 5,000 tons imported annually prior to the imposition of the Monopoly tax. Various causes have contributed to this consider able increase, viz., decrease in competition of imports fron Russia. Probable decrease in stocks in the interior of the country due to low rate of import for some time after the imposition of the Monoply tax. Increased requirements for local consumption due to new industries, such as canning of fruit. These considerations were however unimportant compared with the restrictions introduced by the Persian Government in connection with dealings in Foreign exchange, which regula tions were designed to correct the adverse balance of trade and encourage exports. The result of the new legislation, details of which need not here be entered into, was that merchants were compelled to balance their imports and exports. This generally entailed exporting Persian produce which was sold at a loss abroad, and the only commodities which could be imported into Persia and sold at a rate which would compensate for the losses on exports were sugar and tea. In other words the import of these commodities was artificially stimulated. Anaylsis of the export figures would appear to shew that the object of stimulating export was secured, inasmuch as the figures reveal a substantial increase. Is evert he less the export trades has been largely carried on at a loss—carpets, the principal export from East Persia, can now be purchased in the Bazaars of Northern India at prices considerably below those ruling in East Persia. This state of affairs was possible only so long as merchants could recoup their losses by profits on sugar and tea imported. The time must come at no very distant date when the loss on exports will become too great, resulting in an inevitable slump in both exports and imports. It will be noted that the value in krans per Batman of sugar and tea has fallen considerably in comparison with late years. Machinery. —As anticipated in the report for 1929-30 Imports are steadiy increasing. A reference to Appendix A should be made to discover the relative proportion of this trade which falls to Great Britain and British India. Cotton Thread. —Imports declined in comparison with 1929-30, but approxi mated to those of 1928-29. Various schemes are being formulated for the spinning of cotton thread in Persia, which if they materialise will considerably affect import of this commodity in the future. Motors and Cycles. —Owing mainly to exchange difficulties the import of Motors fell considerably. Twelve Cars and Lorries were imported, of which one only was of British origin. In 1928-29 916 bicycles were imported of which 841 were British, 1,227 were imported in 1929-30 1,221 being from England. In the year under report the total imported was 545, all British. Piece-Goods. —It had not been possible at the date of rendering this report, to obtain detailed figures for the various classes of piece-goods. A reference to \rmendix A will however disclose the relative share of Great Britain and Butis India in this trade. It is hoped to supply a more detailed report in this respect at a later date. Textiles —Coffee and cocoa, clothing, lanterns, furniture and household effects, soap, alcoholic beverages and scents, matches, motor tyres and haberdashery .—The figures reveal a marked decrease m imports. Candles, mineral oils, paper and its applications. —Imports of these commo dities are in excess of 1929-30. 4. Exports. —'Appendix C should be referred to for details.3 A Attention is drawn to the considerable increase in exportation of the following :—- Carpets, Almonds, and other nuts, intestines. In this connection please see re marks under paragraph 3. Exports of these commodities were resorted to to finance imports of sugar and tea. Large quantities of the poorer classes of carpets were disposed of in India at. a loss. The market for the higher classes chiefly exported to Europe and America remained dull for the greater part of the year. Cereals. —Owing to the extremely low prices ruling for cereals export to the Frontier L)istricts of India was resumed. Wool. —The export of this commodity, mz., Zahidan fell considerably. The produce of East Persia was mainly bought up for the Russian market. Silk y raw. —A considerable increase in export took place. Gums. —Although the quantity exported remains approximately the same as for the previous year, the value shewes a great increase. 5. {b) New items of trade. —The market for machinery which has hitherto been relatively unimportant is likely to extend considerably in the near future owing to the policy of the Persian Government of encouraging local industry and to the imposition of a very heavy tariff on imported goods. 6. (c) New trade channels. —Although the conditions in Persian Baluchistan and the fearhad (Frontier) district are becoming more settled, the purchasing power of the inhabitants is extremely low, and, until such time as the value of agricultural produce improves, that area cannot develop into a purchasing market, as was anticipated when the province was brought under Control of the Central Govern ment, 7. {d) Growth of foreign competition and danger to British interests therefrom .— Reference should be made to Appendix A for details of the proportion of trade in the Principal commodities which is enjoyed by the British Empire. Piece-Goods. —Although the total imports have decreased the British Empire has improved its position in comparison with other countries. On the other hand loss of total trade may be partially due to increased imports from Russia and Germany via North Persia. In leather goods, Cotton thread, Haberdashery and silk goods the Empire trade has fallen in comparison with trade of other countries. On the other hand the decrease in Empire Machinery imported, although amounting to some 50% compared with 1929-30, is not relatively so great as the decrease in value of Foreign Machinery imported. In examining Appendix A it should fce borne in mind that the figures are those for goods actually cleared from the Customs during the year and do not agree with figures in Appendix B which are those for the goods which arrived in the country but which were not necessarily cleared from Customs during the year under report, owing to exchange difficulties there was a considerable accumulation of goods in the Customs warehouses at the end of the year. 8. {e) Tie Russian, their trading methods, popularity, success or failure .— Attention is invited to paragraph 17 (e) of the Annual Report for 1929-30. The remarks therein hold good. The popularity of Russian piece-goods has undoubtedly decreased. At the same time the mass of the population is not in a position to indulge in the purchase of expensive materials, and to recapture trade Iqst in recent years it is essential that every effort should be made to place cheap piece-goods on the market. The absence of any direct representation of British firms hampers the sale of their products. Samples of inexpensive goods of attractive, light colours together with some advertisement in the vernacular could not fail to stimulate j trade. 9. (/) Credit offered by Foreign Firms as opposed to those granted by British Firms.-—Oyrmg to the uncertain outlook as regards the exchange and the Govern ment restrictions on the purchase of Foreign exchange to meet payments for imports, the facility of credit to purchasers in East Persia cannot be advised in other than most exceptional cases. American Motor Companies who have in the past sold Cars to their Agents in Persia on credit, the latter selling to the public on the instalment system, haveexperienced great difficulty m recovering tlieir money, and are believed to be greatly restricting credit. 10. (g) Popularity of Foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc. —Popularity of imported goods is almost solely a matter of price. The pur chasing power of the masses is so low that the question of quality is scarcely con sidered, unless of course of two equally inexpensive articles, one is of a better quality. 11. (h) Openings for British goods. —^Machinery, the manufacture of which is impossible in Persia probably offers the best prospects of an expanding market in the future, owing to the encouragement of local industries and high protective tariff which renders such industries profitable. 12. (i) Overtrading and Commercial morality. —British Indian traders were inclined to speculate in the sugar piarket. But for a concession which was granted by the Government of India, permitting the re-export to India of a con siderable quantity of sugar on favourable terms as regards Customs, a number of bankruptcies would have been inevitable among the middlemen importers. 13. (k) Working of Law Suits. —The provincial courts cannot be said to be efficient, compared to European standards. The procedure is difficult for a Foreigner to understand. Legal representatives with an adequate knowledge of the law, cannot be engaged in the Provinces. Appeals often lie to courts situtated as much as 600 miles distant by road, and the expense and delay involved m contesting any small commercial case is quite prohibitive. II. —Financial. 14. (a) Tightness of money, to what, extent due to restriction of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxation, bad harvest, etc. —Owing to the difficulty of recovering debts through the courts, foreign traders in the provinces restrict credit. Throughout the year there has been a sense of insecurity in business circles. Frequent changes in the law regulating the sale and purchase of Foreign exchange sudden enhancement of Customs duties—prohibition of importation of certain articles, except by special permission of a tribunal at Tehran, etc., have all un settled trade. A tax on Incomes, or in the case of smaller traders a license to trade based on annual turnover has been introduced during the year. It has not, as yet, been collected in many of the provincial towns, although demands have been made. It is, as yet too early to gauge the effect on trade. The harvest of 1930-31 has been exceptionally good and crops standing at the end of the year were above the average. The cost of grain in South East Persia has fallen greatly in consequence. Al though of great immediate benefit to the mass of the population, always on the verge of starvation, the fall in value of grain has rendered it unsaleable at a profit and ready money is everywhere scarce in consequence. 15. (f&gt;) Evidence of private capital unemployed or held abroad. —There is no evidence of capital held abroad. The masses in East Persia are poverty stricken. The import trade is largely in the hands of Indian traders of small capital. The small class of wealthy landowners neither invest capital nor lodge it in banks, but hoard it, through uncertainty of the future and a distrust of Banks common to the .inhabitants of undeveloped countries. 16. (c) Diversion of capital from Trade to other purposes. —Nil. 17. (d) Bankruptcies.— There have been no bankruptcies involving any considerable sum of money. 18. (e) In addition to Branches of the National Bank and Imperial Bank at Zahidan (Duzdap) a Branch of the National Bank was opened at Birjand during the year, which is in competition with a Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia previously established. At Zabul (previously known as Sistan) the branch of the National Bank has been operating since the closure of the Imperial Bank of Persia, which had been in existence for several years. Business in all three towns has been5 very limited indeed. Owing to tiie restrictions imposed by the Persian Government by means of a Law governing the sale and purchase of Foreign exchange the Banks have been unable to operate on a normal scale. III. —Taxation. 19. (a) Effect on purchasing poiver. —Taxation though light in comparison with that imposed in a European country, is heavy when considered in relation to the poverty of the inhabitants. 20. (b) Fair or unfair incidence. —Agricultural taxation falls heavily on the poor, since the system of land tenure in S. E. Persia is such that the landowners are able to pass on the burden of the taxation to the cultivator. The newer forms of taxation introduced during the year under review, viz. , tax on Motor Cars and Lorries—an income-tax—licenses for Medical Practitioners, etc., are less likely to directly afreet the poorer classes to any great extent. They will curtail their pur chasing power of certain luxuries such as tea, sugar, imported clothing, etc., since they will cause enhanced prices, but the bulk of the taxation will be passed on by traders and transport owners to the official and middle class townpeople, who can still afford luxuries to some extent. 21. (c) Interference and obstruction on part of tax collectors. —Orderly collections of taxation as exists in Europe does not exist in the provinces. It is largely a matter of bargaining and compounding with the collector. Arrea s of land taxes in Sistan provinces have accumulated to such an extent that they can never be recovered. A commission to enquire into the matter and advise the Government on the land tenure system is shortly to be appointed. IV. —Military. 22. (a) No Military operations of any magnitude have taken place in East Persia during the year. Some minor punitive expeditions were made in Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad against recalcitrant tribesmen. 23. (6) Extortions and interference with trade and Industry. —Nil. 24. (c) Effects of Conscription. —Numbers conscripted are insufficient to adversely affect agriculture—the main occupation of the inhabitants of East Persia. V.—Agriculture. 25. [a) Area under cultivation. —^Accurate figures are not available. A rough computation is as follows. Sistan. —The area under cultivation is said to have been 2,497 Pagaos. The Pagao is theoretically a plot of land worked by six men and varies in actual size according to the locality. The average Pagao in Sistan gives a yield of 60 Sistan Kharvars of grain. One Sistan Kharvar being 1,300 lbs. The total Revenue demand, based on one-third of the total crop, was approximately 20,000 Sistan Kharvars the equivalent of about 11,600 tons, from which it would appear that the total crop was in the neighbourhood of 40,000 tons. The Revenue demand for the summer crops consisting mainly of vegetables, melons, beans, etc., amounted to krans 250,000. The winter crop in Sistan is approximately 50% each of Wheat and Barley. The Qainat. —No figures are available of the area under cultivation. The Revenue demand for the area irrigated amounted to Ts. 22,000 in cash (The equi valent of £2,444 at prevailing rate of exchange) and 1,050 Tabrizi Kharvars in kind, being approximately 314 , 'tons. The demand for Catch crops was 120 Kharvars or about 35 tons. The average conversion rate for Ton in cash was 11 Tomans per Kharvar. The demand is based on one-tenth for irrigated and Catch crops (rain crops) from which it may be deduced that the total crop produced about 9,198 Tons consisting mainly of wheat. 26. (6) Introduction of new crops and new methods. —Nil. 27. (c) Harm done by interference of authorities. —Nil. 28. (d) Irrigation. —Considerable areas were flooded in Sistan and damage to crops resulted, from inefficient control of water. Rains both in Sistan and Qainat were above the average and crop prospects for 1931-32 are good.. MC165FD6 29. (e) Extent to which Land hypothecated. —No figures are available. YI.—Opium. 30 {a) Part played by oipum in the economic life of the Province.—At least 75 % of the inhabitants are addicted to its use and their productive power suffers greatly in consequence. 31. (6) Crop. —In Sistan the yield was about 90 Mans Sistan, or 1,170 lbs. In the Qainat the crop was estimated at nine Tabrizi Kharvars or approximately 2 Tons 13 Cwt. 32 (c) Working of the monopoly service.—The control is not effective. A considerable portion of the crop is not collected by the Excise Officials and smuggling is rife. 33. (d) Collection of the crude.—In Sistan the crude was collected by the Excise Officials and paid for at the rate of krans five per seer (40 seers make one bistan maundof 13 lbs.) It is retailed by the Excise Department at krans 32 per seer. After conversion into opium. The sale amounted to one half a seer daily to eacii opium den in Sistan of which there are now ten, others have been closed bytiie Police. 34. (e) The export trade. —No figures are available. 35. (/) Effects of increased taxation. —Nil. 36 (a) Smuggling. —A considerable quantity of the crude is smuggled and prepared without the knowledge of the Excise Department It is estimated that the quantity of smuggled Opium in the town of Qain was about 3,700 Dirjandi Mans (12,950 lbs.) part of which was from local cultivation and part imported Ironi Afghanistan. It sold early in the year at Tomans 16 to 20 (rate was then -6 Tomans to £.) per Birjandi Man (3j lbs). As a consequence of energetic action by the Local Excise Officials the pries rose to 35-40 Tomans per Man (The rate then being Tomans 9 to 1 £). By the end ot the year it was estimated that all the smuggled Opium had been consumed, while only nine Tabrizi Mans (59 lbs.) of the Government stock had been disposed of. Fines to the extent of 4,000 Tomans were collected during the year for smug- oling. Two shops for the sale of Government Opium were opened u ^ t}ie town ot Biriand but sales have not increased, an indication that smuggled Op 111 ! 11 conti nues to arrive from Afghanistan or that illegal hoards are being disposed ox. 37. (h) Local Consumption. —See above. 38. (i) Apparent Policy of Persian Government in regard to production and CQn ' sumption.—There is no evidence of limitation of the area under cultivation with poppies. Spasmodic efforts are made from time to time to limit the number ot Opium dens in the provincial towns, but no sustained efforts are made and cor ruption among Junior Officials renders nugatory any instructions which may be issued by the Central Government. VII. —Industry. 39 (a) State of Industry Generally. —In Sistan the Carpet Industry has practi- eaUy ceased. The Agency of the Oriental Carpet Company which provided a good deal of employment closed down early m the year. In the Qain the industry has been in a depressed state throughout the year, but efforts are being made by the more influential traders to improve the standard of carpets manufactured as pooi quality rugs are no longer profitable to produce, in spite of the fact that the market was temporarily stimulated vide remarks in paragraph 4 of this report. 40 (b) New Industries. —Nil. There are some prospects of a local compaiTy starting a Cotton Spinning Factory either at Zabul (Sistan) or Birj and in the near future, provided sufficient capital can be raised to import machinery. 41 (c) Lapse of old Industries.—Ni\. 42 {d) Government encouragement—Nil.. 43 (e) Electricity —Very little used. A small lighting Set exists at Zahidan (Duzdap). The town of Zabul (Sistan) is electrically lighted. A small plant7 installed last year aj and for a partial town lighting supply has not proved a success. The power was so limited that current had to be sold at an uneconomic price and it is likely to be closed down. A large English Oil Engine has been im- IfV ported, but not yet installed and it is believed that the owner intends to use it for ^ a town supply and for operating a flour mill and Cinema at Birjand. 44. (f) Demands for Foreign Machinery. —There has been practically no demand in South East Persia, but there are indications that cotton veaving and other machi nery may be imported in the near future. 45. {g) Development of Mines if any. —A copper mine exists near Birjand, but has not been in use for many years. When previously operated no scientific methods were employed. VIII.— Communications and Transport. 46. {a) State of Communications Generally. —Very poor. The main Zahidan - Meshed Road is kept barely passable. The Zahidan-Zabul Road is in a worse state than for years past. It is rendered impassable for Motors by an hour’s rain and for the most part cannot be traversed at a speed 10 miles per hour. 47. (b) Construction of new roads. —Nil. 48. (c) Up keep of old. —Very little work done beyond the minimum required to keep open the main East Persia Road. Temporary repairs were effected in the autumn to the East Persia and Zabul roads, on the occasion of the visit of His Imperial Majesty the Shah, but these repairs were obliterated by the winter rains. On the Zabul road reed rafts are regularly used to transport motors across an in undated stretch near Zabul town. A bridge has been contemplated for some years, but has not been constructed. A good bridge built by British troops during the war was permitted to fall into total disrepair. 49. (d) Average rates during summer and winter on the Chief Trade Routes .—See Appendix D to this report. 50. (e) Effect of Motors on animal transport rates and turnover. —Except for sea sonal export, of grain from Sistan to Zahidan and to Qain, motors have superseded animal transport on the main routes. Camel transport is still used along the East Persian frontier and between East Persia and Afghanistan. 51. (f) Air Services — whether used for Commercial Freights. —No regular Air Services. Flights can be arranged with the Junkers Company of Tehran when required. 52. {g) Security. —The main East Persia Road has been free from maranders Animal caravans on the Zahidan-Zabul road are occasionally robbed by Afghans. Waterless streches render this route difficult for the road-guards to adequately patrol. IX.-— Social. 53. (a) Standard of Living.—Ycry low indeed. There is practically no middle class as known in Europe, except for a few officials and traders in the towns. The peasantry is impoverished and there are no outlets for energy. Carpet weaving being the sole industry other than agriculture. In Sistan the peasants are in a condition of serfdom. Provincial Officials and a small class hereditary land-owners live in compara tive comfort. 54. (6) Unemployment. —No figures available. A considerable amount in the towns. Most of those unemployed are addicted to oipum and practically unemploy able even if work existed. No organised relief for the destitute. 55. (c) Evidence of emigration. —Very little from South East Persia. The con ditions in the neighbouring country Afghanistan being no more attractive than those in Persia.8 56. (d) Public Health and Hygiene. —No health statistics available. But for the dry atmosphere and purifying effect of the sun diseases would be rampant. Typhus breaks out every winter in the villages in Qain. Malaria is frequent at Zahidan, 57. (e) Municipal Services. —During the year under report financial assistance from the Central Government to Municipalities in the Provinces was withdrawn. Such small effect as were previously made in regard to sanitation have conse quently been to a great extent curtailed. Municipal taxes on :— 1. Alcoholic Beverages ; 2. Ghee (clarified butter); 3. Shops, etc. have been authorised by the various Municipalities, but the income barely suffices, in most cases, to cover the salaries of the few officials employed and there is no surplus for town services. There are no municipal services as understood in Europe. C. K.

I have the honour to submit herewith (in duplicate) my Annual Com- ' ^ me J“ al Report on the Provinces of Sistan and the Qainat, includes Duzdap and the Sarhad, for the year 1929-30. g ar ‘ to this Consulate^ ^ iS printed&gt; 10 C0 P ies ma J bc applied3 HIS MAJESTY’S CONSULATE, SISTAN AND KAIN. Annual Commercial Report for the Provinces of Sistan and the Qainat, including Duzdap and the Sarhad, for the year 1929-30. 0 1 ^ I.—Trade. 1. (a) General conditions of trade .—The following tables have been prepared to show the total import and export trade via the Nushki-Duzdap Railway during the Persian financial year ending on March 20th, 1930. Figures for the two preceding years are given for facility of comparison. The figures for 1929-30 in regard to exports do not include those of the Khorasan area, which are customed at Meshed, but exported via Duzdap, because the Customs authorities have declined to furnish the necessary statistics. As a matter of interest the Meshed figures for the year 1928-29 are given in Appendix ‘ A ’ as a guide. They were included in the figures for 1928-29 given below. It is however, known that the value of carpets exported and customed at Meshed has greatly fallen in comparison with the figures given in Appendix 4 A Table shewing total Import and Export trade via the Nushki-Duzdap Railway for the Persian Financial year ending 20th March 1930, together with totals for the tw r o preceding years. — Batmans. Indian maunds. Thousands of Krans. Bupees. in lakhs. Imposts.

The import trade decreased to the extent of approximately seven millions of Krans in value compared with the previous year. The fall in the rupee values is very great owing to the adverse exchange. In the compilation of this report Krans were converted at the rate of 427*3 Krans to a hundred rupees whereas in 1928-29 the conversion rate was 361*6 Krans to Rs. 100. 3. Exports decreased in value by thirteen million Krans, although it will be noted that the weight of exports was considerably in excess of the total for 1928-29. This is accounted for by the fact that there was a hearvy falling off in the export of high priced commodities, such as carpets, while the export of poppy-seeds, a commodity of comparatively low value greatly increased. Even so it must be borne in mind that the difierence is not quite so great as appears from these figures owing to the non-inclusion of the figures for articles customed at Meshed. Carpets in particular are frequently customed there. .. For purposes of comparison, it is believed that 60 per cent, of the figures \| given in Appendix ‘ A ’ might be added. AlLhirtJjt h Cr4C4U2&lt;4r4 4. Imports. —For details of the imports of various commodities reference should be made to Appendix ‘ B Piece-goods. Further details of the Piece-goods included under the general heading in Appendix ‘ B ’ are given in Appendix ‘ D It will be noted that the total value of piece-goods imported, as compared with the previous year, fell by approximately two mildons of Krans. There is thus revealed a progressive decline, for the figures for 1928-29 were about four millions less than those for 1927-28. It is unlikely that the continued decrease is due to a general falling off of import ations, but is probably more than accounted for by increased import of Russian goods from the North. 5. Sugar. —In spite of the monopoly tax and contrary to expectation, the import of sugar rose from 855 tons in 1928-29 to 1,420 tons in the year under report. This increase is probably due to a partial collapse of the sub sidized sugar trade hitherto indulged in by the U. S. S. R. in East Persia. It may to some extent also be due to increased consumption of sugar in k&gt;cal Industry, such as tinned fruit, which is now produced at Meshed. Neverthe less import of this commodity falls for short of a normal year before the imposition of the monopoly tax, when there was an average of 5,000 tons imported annually by the Nushki-Duzdap Railway. 6. Tea. —The import of tea, the other commodity subjected to the ‘ Monopole ’ has declined by approximately two million Krans. 7. Machinery. —Machinery was imported to the value of 506,203 Krans as compared with 179,406 in the previous year. It is anticipated that the importation of machinery will continue to increase. Details of the countries of origin of this machinery are :— Germany . • 382,000 United States 92,000 England and India ........ 32,000 8. Cotton Thread. —The value of cotton thread imported increased by about one million Krans, in spite of the depression in the carpet trade. This may be accounted for by the increased manufacture of cotton goods in other parts of Persia. 9. Motors and Cycles. —The total value of imports has slightly decreased. On the other hand it will be noticed that there has been a considerable inc ease in the quantity of tyres imported, nearly all of which are of American origin. 10. Matches and Candles. —The import of matches was about double that of the preceding year, while the value of candles brought into the country via Duzdap declined considerably. 11 . Bicycles manufactured in England continue to be popular. 1,227 bicycles were imported of which 1,221 came from England. The total for 1928-29 was 916 of which 841 were British. 12. Import of English motors has not increased and the British share of this trade is quite insignificant, practically all cars and lorries imported being of American manufacture. 13. Exports. —Appendix ‘ C ’ should be referred to for details of the various exports. The total Kran value of exports has decreased, although the figures reveal a considerable increase in the weight of exports. The discrepancy is not quite so great as appears from the figures provided, owing to the fact that the goods customed at Meshed, but exported via Duzdap, have not been included in the totals for 1929-30. For purposes of a rough comparison about 60 per cent, of the total value given in Appendix ‘ D ’ may be added, or say nine million krans, thus making the total exports about 29 million krans, as compared with 33 million in 1928'29. Attention is drawn to the marked increase in the export of ‘ spices ’, consisting almost entirely of poppy seeds. 14. (6) New item of trade. —Nil.5 15. (c) New trade channels. —Conditions in Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad District, south of Duzdap, have been disturbed throughout the year and consequently there has been no marked increase in that area, as was anticipated. 16. (d) Growth of foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting therefrom. —The following is a comparative statement shewing the ’ chief commodities of British Empire origin imported via the Duzdap Railway, together with the imports from other countries. — British Empire. Other countries. Total. Increase or decrease since 1928-29. Kran values. Kian values. Kran values.

British Empire trade also benefitted by the increased import of cotton thread. The import of cereals from Empire sources somewhat increased, while from other sources there is a marked decrease. In spite of the considerable increase in the number of British bicycles imported the figures for 4 Motors and Cycles ’ show a further decline in the British trade under the combined heading. No improvement can be looked for until a mass-production car, suitable to Persian conditions and of low price, can be put on the market by British firms. 17. (e) The Russians, their trading methods, popularity, success or failure. —Russian piece-goods filled the Sistan and Birjand market during the year and penetrated as far south as! Kwash in the Sarhad, south of Duzdap. They were at first very popular, and Persians, always keenly interested in new goods bought them in preference to Manchester piece-goods. Towards t9 6 the end of the year it was manifest that the market was overstocked and traders were finding difficulty in disposing of the goods. The public has discovered the inferior quality of these goods and a return to British goods with which they have long been familiar appears imminent. It must, how ever, be borne in mind that the purchasing power of the public in East Persia is very low, and in a year of bad harvest the cheapest goods would find a ready market, irrespective of quality. 1 The British trade suffers from the absence of any representative who could produce samples of the most up-to-date goods, new materials and new colours. In consequence the trade is largely confined to goods which have been known in the market for years. New patterns and colours introduced by the Russians consequently appear attractive. If means could be devised to place on the market a more varied range of patterns and colours increased trade would inevitably result. For this purpose the visit of a competent representative of British firms, armed with a good stock of samples, etc., is much to be desired. A note to this effect was made in the annual report for 1928-29 (paragraph 14), but unfortunately has not been productive of practical results. Figures for the imports of Russian sugar are not available, but south of Meshed the subsidized trade appears to have collapsed, and the marked increase of imports via Duzdap bears witness to the absence of severe com petition in South East Persia. 18. (/) Credit offered by Foreign Firms as opposed to those granted by British Firms .—Credit terms are not, as a rule, offered by British firms and it is doubtful if the facility of credit would be advisable. A case has re cently occurred in which a British firm purchased goods from East Persia as per sample, making payment in advance. The goods were not up to sample and bore no reasonable relation to the prices charged. The firm is experienc ing great difficulty in effecting an agreement with the exporters. American motor cars are sold on the instalment plan, the terms generally being one-third cash, the balance plus interest being payable in six monthly instalments. Owing to the number of lorries on the roads now being in excess of trade requirements and consequently working at uneconomic rates of hire, it is reported that agents are experiencing difficulty in obtaining payment of instalments. 19. (g) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, etc .—Russian and Japanese textile goods enjoy a certain popularity owing to attractive ranges of new colours and patterns, and cheapness compared j with the well known lines of Manchester goods. They are however generally ® recognised as of inferior quality. The bulk of the machinery imported is from Germany, lower prices being quoted than British goods. 20. {h) Openings for British goods .—There should be an opening for simple agricultural machinery in South East Persia, which would result in improved agriculture. Cheap ploughs might find a ready sale. Machinery of a complicated type, designed to save labour, would not be saleable. Labour is cheap and mechanical knowledge non existent. An enquiry for plough has recently been received and it is hoped a few land-owners will experiment with metal ploughs which have proved successful in India. 21. (i) Overtrading and Commercial morality .—For the greater part of the year there was no regular court at Duzdap or Sistan, and traders ex perienced difficulty in recovering claims. Trading was in consequence restricted and no overtrading was noticed. 22. {h) Working of Law Suits .—To obtain a decision in commercial cases is tedious and difficult in the Provincial Courts. The procedure is difficult for foreigners to understand and legal representatives with an adequate knowledge of Persian law cannot be found. Appeals often lie to courts situated as much as 600 miles by road from the court in which the suit was first filed and the delay and expense in contesting an appeal is often prohibitive.7 II. —Financial. 23. (a) Tightness of money, to what extent dm to restriction of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxation, bad harvest, etc. —Owing to the difficulty experienced in recovery of debts through the Courts, British Indian traders in East Persia have considerably restricted credit. The very high rate of exchange which has existed throughout the year tended to restrict imports beyond the requirements of the immediate future. Changes in Legislation affecting exchange, sudden imposition of enhanced customs duties and foreshadowed taxation of bushiess profits have brought about a sense of insecurity, resulting in restricted trading. 24. (6) Evidence of private capital unemployed or held abroad. —The population of East Persia is, on the whole, poverty stricken. The import trade is largely in the hands of British-Indian traders of small capital. The small number of wealthy landowners neither invest their capital in industry nor place it in banks for security, but, as is so frequently the case in undeveloped countries, conceal it. There is no evidence of capital held abroad. 25. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice-versa.— Nil. 26. (d) Bankruptcies. —There has been no bankruptcies involving any considerable sum. 27. (e) Competition among local banks. —Branches of the National Bank of Persia have been opened at Duzdap and Sistan in competition with Branches of the Imperial Bank of Persia at these places. The Sistan branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia has closed. III.— Taxation. 28. (a) Effect on purchasing power, —There are no manufactures in South East Persia, apart from carpet weaving, which is a “ Cottage ” industry. The population is entirely agricultural and all taxation must tend to reduce purchasing power, particularly as none of the revenue realised is utilized in South East Persia for the encouragement of agriculture, the main source of livelihood of the inhabitants. 29. (6) Fair or unfair incidence. —Taxation falls heavily on the poorer classes. The method of assessment on crops in South East Persia, permits of a good deal of evasion of taxation by the landlords, who are able to pass on nearly the whole of the taxation to the peasantry. 30. (c) Interference and obstruction on part of tax collectors. —Organised and orderly collection of taxation as known in Europe scarcely exists. Taxation is largely a matter of bargaining between the Collector and the person liable, with the natural result that less influential persons fare wor ^e than those of stronger financial position. The collection of Agricul tural revenue is greatly in arrears and landowners in the Sistan area owe sums to the Treasury which have accumulated for years and can never be recovered. This state of affairs is unsettling, leads to continual friction between officials and Agriculturists and discourages the latter from investing capital in development, lest at any time the land be confiscated for arrears of taxation. IV.— Military. 31. (a) Owing to military operations in Persian Baluchistan, motor transport was on two occasions commandeered at Duzdap. The majority of lorries so confiscated belong to British-Indians. Owing to gross overloading by the military much damage was done, and as there is no fixed tariff for Commandeered transport, the rates promised, although reasonable enough for the journey to be performed, if lorries are not overloaded, make no allowance for delays en route, or before the lorries are released, and the net8 result is a heavy loss to the owners. Convoys being often in charge of irresponsible junior military officials, are often given insufficient time to effect running repairs, replenish water, etc. 32. (b) Extortions and interference with trade and industry. —Petty extortions by irresponsible junior officials, policemen, Road-Guards, etc., are of common occurrence. They usually take the form of deliberate misinter pretation of some regulation or law. As it is a difficult and tedious matter 0* to obtain redress, the procedure more often than not involving expenditure and costs considerably in excess of the damage already suffered, it is regret table that the victims of such extortions seldom find it worth while to bring their oppressor to justice. 33. (c) Effects of Conscription. —In South East Persia there does not appear to have been any ill-effects from conscription. The conscripts are usually of a very poor type, mainly from the towns and frequently unem ployed or casual labourers. It is probable that a term of military service will, in the long run, improve the national physique and be of ultimate benefit to the nation. V.— Agriculture. 34. {a) Area under cultivation. —No accurate figures are available, but as far as Sistan is concerned a rough estimate is arrived at as follows :—The Revenue demand is believed to have been— 1,906,306 Tabrezi Mans of wheat valued at . . . 1,525,040 Krans. 1,906,306 „ „ Barley „ ... 9,53,150 „ which should represent one-third of the total crop. The total produce would therefore be 11,437,836 Tabrezi Mans from which may be deducted 40,000 maunds remitted as a result of representations by the public alleging over- assessment. Balance 11,397,836 T. Mans which from calculations based on the average yield represents an cultivated area of about 847,778 acres. There is an area of about 60 acres under cotton annually. The Revenue demand (cash) for melons, vegetables, etc., amounted to Krans 228,813. No figures are available for the Birjand (Kain) area, which is however small compared with Sistan, although crops are of better quality. 35. {b) Introduction of new crops and new methods. —Nil. 36. (c) Harm done by interference of authorities. —Considerable damage to crops resulted from unscientific regulation of flood water frequently resulting in considerable inundation of cultivated land. 37. (d) Irrigation. —The area under cultivation could be very greatly increased by proper control of water. Climatic conditions were normal during the Summer. During the winter rains were abnormally heavy and water is abundant. Crop prospects for 1930-31 being particularly good. 38. (e) Extent to which land hypothecated. —No figures available. VI.— Opium. 39. {a) Tart played by opium in economic life of the Province. —At least 75 per cent, of the population is addicted to opium. The productive power of the inhabitants greatly suffers in consequence. 40. {b) Crop. —In Sistan the yield of crude opium was about 70 Mans Sistan. The yield in Qain District is said to have been about four Kharwars and 50 Mans Tabrezi. 41. (c) Working of the Monopoly service—In South East Persia, the control is not very effective. A considerable amount of opium never reaches the Excise Department Officials. 42. {d) Collection of the crude. —Crude opium is delivered to the Excise Department and paid for at the rate of 4 krans a seer (40 seers=l man Sistani). The crude is converted into opium by the Excise Department and is stocked. It is sold for local consumption and traders and is available for export.9 43. (e) The Export Trade.-—No figures available. Smuggling probably extensively indulged in. 44. (/) Effects oj increased taxation. 45. ( 0 ) Smuggling .—A considerable proportion of the crude is smuggled and prepared without the knowledge of the Excise. 46. (h) Local consumption. —Controlled opium dens exist. Smuggled opium is largely consumed, but a stock of labelled opium, issued by the Excise Department is generally kept on the premises for production to Excise Officials. 47. (i) Awarent policy of Persian Government in regard to production and Consumption. —No sustained efforts have been noticed towards curtail ment of crude opium supplies, or the consumption by the public. Spasmodic efforts are made by the police from time to time, but owing to corruption of Subordinate officials results are negligable. VII. —Industry. 48. (a) State of Industry generally.—The carpet weaving is the only industry in South East Persia and owing to heavy stocks in Europe, the trade is suffering from great depression. Prices have fallen to an average of 8»9 Tomans per Square Zar for carpets of medium quality. 49. (6) New Industries .—Nil. 50. {c) Lapse of old industries. —Nil. 51. {d) Government encouragement.—Ni\. 52 (e) Electricity. —Very little used. One small lighting set exists at Duzdap, one at Sistan and one has recently been imported at Birjand for partial lighting of the town. All are of American manufacture. 53 (f) Demand for Foreign machinery. —In South Persia, owing to the absence of industries there is practically no demand. Such imports as too ^ place via Duzdap were entirely for North East Persia. 54. (£) Development of mines if any.—Nil. VII.—Communications and Transport. 55 (A) State of communication generally.—Very po° r - Tlie niain road . ^ Persia Duzdap-Meshed suffered severely from abnormal ram and snow dS the winter. It remains passable for motor traffic except immediately after heavy rain or snow, but is difficult and a heavy strain on motor traffic. 7 56 (61 Construction of new roads.-ln Persian Baluchistan a road pass- r ' j wfw constructed between Danah Paneh and Jalk and able for ™tor traffic, was cons« ^ ^ at Satogin 83 A carnal track from Kain to Meshed via Khaf was made pass able for cars. It is very infrequently used being larger than the normal route and. has deteriorated greatly as the result of ram. K 7 M TTmkeev of old. —Very little work has been done. Such repairs as are effected are of a temporary nature. The Duzdap-Sistan road is in a as are enecte f bare) v passable for motors. To traverse sixty miles deplorable ® ’ f r0 ni the^natural formation perfect for motors) takes 6 7 hours in a light car. Rain renders the road impassable for several weeks afa ttae and it is liable to inundation, necessitating the use of reed rafts to cross the flooded areas. 58 (d) Average rates during summer and winter on chief trade routes.— A statement of rates is attached to this report. 5Q (e) Effect of motors on animal transport-rates and Except for seasonal export of grain from Sistan to Duzdap and Kain, animal transport has been superseded by motor lorries.10 60. (/) Air Services—whether used for commercial freights. —No regular service exists in South East Persia. Occasional passenger flights between Duzdap and Tehran are carried out by Junkers as occasion offers. 61. (g) Security.—The main East Persia Trade route—Duzdap to Meshed —has been free from marauders. One lorry was looted on the Duzdap-Sistan road by Afghans and a number of animal convoys were attacked and robbed. ^ Owing to long stretches of waterless plain and accessibility of the road to • marauders from Afghanistan and Baluchistan, effective guarding of the route is beyond the present capabilities of the road-guards. IX.— Social. 62. (a) Standard of living. —On the whole very low indeed. There is an entire absence of a middle-class. The peasantry is impoverished and can find no outlet for energy. Agricultural conditions are such that the peasants are virtually in Serfdom. Officials and landed gentry live in a standard of comparative comfort, and enjoy such luxuries as motor cars, gramophones, imported clothing of European manufacture, etc., but otherwise the standard is comparable with that of artisans in Europe. 68. (6) Unemployment. —There is a considerable amount of unemploy ment in the Towns of South East Persia. No figures are available. There is no form of poor relief, other than private charity, and deaths from exposure and starvation are not infrequent. 64. (c) Evidence of emigration. —A few hundred cultivators of the Sistan area, are reported to have emigrated into Russian territory as the result of promises of financial assistance and free grants of land. This emigration has however been stopped by the local authorities. 65. (d) Public Health and hygiene. —Accurate health statistics are not available. At Duzdap a high percentage of the population is infected with malaria. An outbreak of typhus and influenza took place in Kain and ran through the villages, resulting in a high death rate. There are no hygienic services and but for the purifying effect of the sun and the extremely dry climate, deceases would be rampant. J 66. (e) Municipal semces.—Beyond a certain amount of street align ment and lighting and a minimum of street sweeping there are no municipal services as understood in Europe. ^ C. K.

THE RUSSIANS, THEIR TRADING METHODS, POPULARITY, SUCCESS OR FAILURE. Russian piece-goods filled the Sistan and Birjand markets during the year and penetrated as far south as Kwash in the Sarhad, south of Duzdap. They were at first very popular and Persians, always keenly interested in new goods 'bought them in preference to Manchester piece-goods. Towards the end of the year it was manifest that the market was overstocked and traders were finding difficulty in disposing of the goods. The public has discovered the inferior quality of these goods and a return to British goods with which they have long been familiar appears imminent. It must however be borne in mind that the purchasing power of the public in East Persia is very low, and in a year of bad harvest the cheapest goods would find a ready market, irrespective of quali ty. j The British trade suffers from the absence of any representative who could produce samples of the most up-to- date goods, new materials and new colours. In consequence the trade is largely confined to goods which have been / known in the market for years. New patterns and|colours introduced by the Russians consequently appear attractive. If means could be devised to place on the market a more varied range of patterns and colours, increased trade would inevitably result. For this purpose the visit of a competent representative of British firms, armed with a good stock of samples etc. is much to be desired. A note to this effect was made in the annual report for 1928-S9 (para.14), but unfortunately has not been productive of practical/practical results. Figures for the imports of Russian sugar are not available, but South of Meshed the subsidized trade appears to have collapsed, and the marked increase of imports via Duzdap bears witness to the absence of severe competition in South East Persia.Amum mm PHS.

I.—Trade. 1. (a) General conditions of trade .—The following tables have been compiled to show the total import and export trade via the Nushki-Duzdap Railway for the Persian financial year ending 20th March 1929, together with those for the two preceding years for facility of comparison :— — Batmans. Indian maunds. Thousands of krans. Bs. Lakhs.

The increase is due to the re-importation into Persia of coin consisting of some seven million two-kran pieces, formerly smuggled out of the country. 3. Exports, which last year exceeded the total imports, fell short in the year under report by some eight million krans. 4. Imports .—Appendix &lt;c A ” shows the import figures for various com modities. The import of cotton piece-goods, one of the main items of the import trade via the Nushki-Duzdap Railway, which for the last two years had remained stationary at 14'30 ^million krans, dropped to 10-9 million krans. This is accounted for by the high adverse rate of exchange that prevailed between Persia and India during the year, and also to Russian competition, which penetrated as far south as Sistan, thus tapping the markets of the border towns of Afghanistan. 5. Sugar, which in the early days of the Nushki-Duzdap Railway, and before the introduction of the monopoly tax, provided the railway with some five thousand tons of freight a year, decreased to 855 tons. Any marked increase in the importation of this commodity cannot be anticipated if the monopoly tax be retained. 198F&amp;PD2 6. Tea, the other monopoly tax item, shows a slight increase, but here, as in the case of sugar, no large increase is anticipated, owing to the crushing monopoly tax. 7. Metals. —An increase of four million krans over the figures for the preceding year is noticeable. This is solely due to the re-importation into Persia of silver currency. There is no doubt that the major proportion of these coins finds its way into Afghanistan in payment for goods smuggled into Persia. Such coinage subsequently finds its way to Peshawar and Chaman in exchange for Indian goods. The Sarhad Baluchi also contrives to take a certain quantity of Persian coin to stations on the Nushki-Duzdap Bail way in British territory, for purchase of goods easily smuggled across the border. 8. Motors and bicycles. —During the year 225 motor lorries and .69 touring cars were imported via Duzdap ; of these 223 lorries and 60 touring Scars were of American manufacture, 2 lorries and 8 touring cars British and one touring car of Italian manufacture. Bicycles are becoming very popular in East Persia and 916 were imported during the year, of which 8^1 were imported direct from England, The English model most popular in East Persia is the “ b Hercules,” manufactured in Birmingham, and finds a ready market at Tomans 25—Tomans 26 per cycle. 9. Oil. —Be-importation of Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s petrol and kerosine via Duzdap has increased and such increase is likely to persist. The agency of the Shell Company at Duzdap has closed, it being unable to compete with Anglo-Persian prices. 10. Exports. —Appendix “ B ” shows the export figures for various com modities. The export trade w^hich had showm promise of further increase fell from 42-0 million krans in 1927-28 to 33’9 during the current year. The decline in the export of skins, drugs and cotton accounts for the hulk of the decrease, ■while furs and spices w r ere the only itenjs of which an increased exportation occurred. 11. (5) New items of trade. —Nil. 12. (c) New trade channels. —With the occupation of the whole of Persian Baluchistan by the Persian Government, new markets are now opening up for direct trade through Indian merchants. Already Hindi traders have transported goods to Bampur and other towns in Persian Baluchistan, and have given advances for the purchase of exportable commodities. There can he no doubt that when the Persian Government shall have established administration in Persian Baluchistan, the Baluchi, hitherto nomadic, or agriculturist in a small way, will become interested in trade and tend to form settled communities. By the construction of new roads, and w T ith a settled administration capable of maintaining law and order, Persian Baluchistan could he made a comparatively flourishing trading centre. 13. (d), (e) and (f) Competition of foreign goods with those of British Empire origin. —The following is a comparative statement showung the chief commodities of British Empire origin imported via Duzdap during the year, together wuth the imports of those commodities from other countries :— — British Empire. Other countries. Total. Increase or decrease since 1927-28.

In Kerman commercial report for 1928-29, paragraph B-12, it is stated that Russian piece-goods have practically ousted the Manchester trade from that mnrket, ai?d a decrease in importation of British piece-goods to the value of 4 million krans during the current year, as shown by the figures for imports via ttie iN'ushki-Duzdap Railway, would ap[ ear to afford sufficient proof that in a very short while the trade in British piece-goods will have ceased to exist as far as the markets of East Persia are concerned, unless energetic measures be adopted to counteract foreign competition. During the^ year 1923-24 a representative of a well-known firm of Manchester paid a visit to East Persia on behalf of his firm with surprising results. This gentleman being a Persian, was able to get into touch with all classes of the trading com munity, both Indian and Persian, and to arrange long-term credits. The results of that visit are still evident from the 5'0 million krans value of piece-goods imported direct from England during the year. IMrther visits by representa tives of British firms are highly desirable if British piece-goods are to retain a hold in the markets of East Persia. 15. Motor-cars .—This is an article of import in which the British Empire cannot hope to compete. Efforts by this Consulate to encourage representa tives of English cars and lorries to visit East Persia with cars for demonstra tion purposes have met with no result. The Consulate has, however, been able to import a few British cars for certain Persian gentlemen for their private use. Much has been said in various reports of the superiority of the British car over the American product, and this may doubtless be true for use in Europe, but the extremely severe conditions under which cars work in East Persia require high-powered engines and exceptionally good springs. In the opinion of purchasers of cars in this area, the inexpensive makes of British cars have not these requisites. The more expensive cars would find no market here. If we add to the above reasons the fact that no effort has been made on the part of British manufacturers to demonstrate suitable cars, and that spares for English cars are nowhere kept in East Persia and extremely in efficiently handled by Agents in India, it is obvious that nothing short of really energetic measures will ensure Great Britain any share in this trade. 16. With an increase in the importation of motor-cars and lorries the tyre industry has automatically benefitted. During the year tyres to the value of Krans 498,772 were imported of which only Krans 27,441 worth were of British manufacture. The Dunlop Rubber Company are still doing their utmost to improve their sales in East Persia and have recently opened a shop and agency in Meshed. It is however an uphill fight against well-organised and established American competition which will be difficult to overcome. The system prevailing in this part of Persia is for importers of American cars and lorries to always maintain a sufficient stock of tyres, tubes and spare parts, and as the lorries are in the majority of cases sold on the instalment system, the owners are practically forced to purchase tyres and tubes, as required, from the importer to whom they are indebted, and are disinclined to experiment with a British tyre. 17. ($0 and (ti) Overtrading and commercial morality. M ith the total abolition of the capitulations the tendency to overtrade on the part of Indian merchants is not so noticeable as in the past. This may be attributed to two causes—the knowledge that it is a difficult and tedious matter to recover claims in the Persian Courts, and to the very unfavourable rates of exchange, which discouraged active trading. II. —Financial. 18. The high rate of exchange that prevailed during the year, against Persia, has had the effect of restricting the importation of goods by Indian and Persian merchants trading in the Sistan Consular area. ^ Practically all the members of the trading community in Sistan and the Qainat trade on a very low capital ; consequently with the exchange rate against Persia they are unwilling to risk sending much money out of the country for goods which will probably remain on. their hands, or which when sold, bring in such a small margin of profit as to be useless to them in purchasing commodities for export.4 I lie effect of this is particularly noticeable in the case of clarified butter which has always been one of the chief exports from Sistan. During the year, although no restriction was placed by the Persian Government on its export, claiified hutter^ to the value of only Krans 41,455 left East Persia, against Krans 566,196 in the previous year. Dealings in foreign currency in this area are practically wi/, with the exception of business done by the Standard Carpet Company, and even their transactions were not on so large a scale as formerly, the reasons for which are given under Section VI. III. —Taxation. 19. (a) Taxes levied. —No statistics are available. The effect on the importation of sugar and tea of the monopoly tax has been referred to already. It is interesting to note that in spite of the monopoly taxes the actual customs receipts on sugar and tea (the monopoly tax on which is assessed on weight) shows an increase over the previous year. It is possibly explained bv the military operations which took place during the greater part of the year/ The presence of a large body of troops in Baluchistan and the pre-occupation of the tribes in warfare, may have acted to some extent as a detriment on smuggl ing. Similarly the troops employed were rationed by contractors who probably imported these commodities via Duzdap. Increasfd'efliciency in the Customs Department is likely also to have had some effect. Further, for a short period, supplies of Russian sugar in Birjand and the Qainat were low and Indian importers took advantage of the temporary situation to import more heavily. Such a concatenation of fortuitous circumstances, which gave rise to an increase of Customs revenue in East Persia, can only have resulted in a corresponding decrease elsewhere, and it is probable that next year figures will show' a decline of receipts under the heavy taxation existing. Appendix “ C ” show's the Persian Customs receipts on goods imported and exported via Duzdap during the year. (b) Incidence of taxation. —As is usual throughout Persia the w'hole of the taxes, both Customs and Municipal, fall heavily on the poorer classes, the vast majority of whom in Sistan and the Qainat live a hand to mouth existence, burdened w r ith taxes w'hick they can never hope to pay and consequently in the toils of Revenue and other officials who must be bribed to allow accumulated debts to stand over for a further period. IV. — Military. 20. {a) Commandeering of transport. —Owdng to operations in Persian Baluchistan the commandeering of transport w'as of frequent occurrence durin°* the year. Transport of trade goods however w r as not seriously affected as the supply of motor lorries is far in excess of trade requirements. (b) Extortion and interference with trade. —Although there w^ere consider able movements of military troops in all directions throughout the year, no instances of extortion and interference with trade were reported. The Amnieh (road-guards) how'ever often cause inconvenience to motor drivers, demanding by force to be carried from one post to another without payment. {c) Conscription. —A large number of recruits from the Sistan district w r ere enlisted during the year and w'ere despatched to Persian Baluchistan for training. The Qainat District however was exempt, but it is understood will furnish conscripts during 1929-30. V.— Agricultural. 21. Sistan. —The area under cultivation during the year w r as practically the same as given in the report.for 1927-28. No improvement has been made in the system of land tenure and in consequence an immense area of cnltivat- able land still remain fallow*. Much has been said in the past regarding the possibility of Sistan as an extensive wffieat growing centre, and it is deplorablethat with the abundant supply of water available no steps have yet been taken to improve the present condition of the agriculturist. As it is some four years’ arrears of rent are being demanded by the Revenue Department, which, with the present system of land tenure in force, can never be recovered. The population is in fact held in serfdom, deprived alike of security of tenure and ^ even of a fair share in the profits of their labour and having no incentive to improve either the land or their agricultural methods. Qainat. —No figures are available for the Qainat district. The total area is about 22,500 square miles, of which probably less than one per cent, is cultivated. The Qainat is handicapped in regard to an adequate water supply and is wholly dependent on winter snow and rainfall. In years when the rainfall is below the average crops are extremely poor, resulting in the im^ portation of grain from Sistan at exorbitant prices. 22. (6) Introduction of new crops and new methods — Machinery. —Nil. 23. (c) Harm done by requisitioning of Alimentation services. —Nil. 24. (d) Irrigation — Sistan. —The supply of water from the Helmand river was abundant throughout the year. Qainat. —The winter and spring rains of 1928-29 were below normal; water in the Qainats on which the district entirely depends was consequently scarce. Crops on the whole however were good, but suffered some damage from locusts. 25. (e) Extent to which land hypothecated. —No figures available. 26. (/) Part played by opium in prosperity of the Province. —A small quantity of opium was grown in the Mian Kangi district and was sold locally at Krans 512 per batman. Large quantities of opium are imported to Sistan from the Qainat, and no rigid restriction has been imposed by the local authorities on its consumption. Probably 75 percent, of the population of Sistan is addicted to the drug. Qainat. —Thirty-five Tabrizi Kharvars were cultivated during the year, the whole-sale price of which was Krans 350 per batman. YI. —Industry. 27. Carpet weaving is the only industry of importance in the Sistan Consular area. Business during the year was not however so brisk as last year, which is accounted for by the fact that several small carpet factories closed down owing to inadequate supply of labour, and to the Standard Carpet Company having to close down for a short period owing to the death of their European manager, pending appointment of his successor. The prices of carpets towards the end of the year was steadily falling. The reasons to which this decline in local market value are ascribed are firstly, that following on the acquisition by exporting companies of practically all carpets which could be described as antique, internal trade was for a time brisk, new carpets being purchased to replace old ones disposed of. Local requirements in this respect have now ceased. Secondly, during the carpet ‘ boom 5 which existed as a result of the trade in antiques and their replacement by new carpets, the standard of weaving was greatly lowered and carpets from East Persia obtained a ‘ bad name 5 in Europe, where stocks of carpets of inferior weaving had accumulated. Efforts are being now made to improve the quality. The following table shows the carpet export figures for the year, together wdth those for the two preceding years :— Value in thousands of krans. 1926- 27 .. .. .. .. 18,503-1 1927- 28 .. •• •• .. 22,320-6 1928- 29 .. .. .. .. 21,030-0 F&amp;PDThe following table shows the value of carpets exported from Sistan, Birjand and Meshed, respectively, together with the countries of destination :— Exported to Value in thous From the Sistan Consulate area. ands of krans.

Other countries .... 37 64-7 J Total 8,711-8 12,318-2 11,571 28. (d) Electricity. —There are two electric lighting sets in the Sistan Consulate area. One installed in Sistan by the local Governor affords a municipal supply, and also provides power to three flour mills, a cotton tunning machine and a cinema. One small plant is in operation at Duzdap, at present used to light the business premises of the owner. 29. (e) Mines. —Nil. Bo ADS. 80. (a) New Hoads. —As a result of the occupation by the Persian Government of the province of Persian Baluchistan the following roads have been completed for motor traffic :— (1) Duzdap-Mirjawa. (2) Duzdap-Gwarkoh-Shurab-Fahreh. (3) Gwarkoh-Khwash. (4) Shurab-Bam. (&amp;) Upkeep of old roads. —Very little work was done during the year on the main Duzdap-Meshed road, a few breaches ma le by the winter rains being temporarily repaired. These during the summer form into sandy ‘ nullahs ’ which cause inconvenience to drivers of motor vehicles. Only one small gang of about 10 men under an overseer appears to be regularly employed on a stretch of 78 miles between Safidawa and Shusp, and as they are equipped only with shovels they do little in the way of useful repairs. No attempt whatsoever has been made to improve the road between Sistan and Dorahi, the junction with Meshed-Buzdap main road. This stretch is about 78 miles in length and is in an appalling condition. The first section between Sistan and Lutak (24 miles) is a mere cart-track, deeply rutted, frequently under water and intersected by numerous dry water-channels. Durin 0, February and March, Sistan was practically isolated by a hea\y over flow of the Helm and which flooded the country for miles. It was only after repealed requests made by this Consulate to the Be\enue Department, that reed-rafts were eventually constructed capable of carrying cars, lorries and merchandise across the flooded area. 31 {d) Effect of motor transport on rates and turnover. —The increasing import of motor lorries, which as has already been mentioned, are sold on the instalment system, has resulted in such keen competition for freight that at one time 1, during the year rates fell to a figure that could scarcely meet ^ run ning expenses. Camel transport on the Duzdap-Meshed road is now practically non-existent. A certain amount of camel and donkey transport plies between Duzdap and Sistan during the winter season ; lorry-owners are reluctant to undertake a journey over a very bad road with the prospect of no-return loads. Turnover, in the case of the more prosperous merchants, is not much affected Fy the increased speed of motor transport, as they import large stocks, whichusually remain on hand for considerable periods before they can be disposed of This is not, however, the case with the smaller trader w T ho, with motor transport rates at a minimum looks for small profits and a quick return and when rates are high is liable to go out of business. (e) Security as regards the trade routes has been good. Although numerous raids have been made during the year by Afghan marauders on villages near the border in Sistan and the Qainat, no attempts were made to interfere with trade routes. Social. 32. (a) Standard of living — Qainat.—Ths standard of living in this district, although perhaps slightly better than in Sistan, is on the whole poor. With the exception of the carpet industry which provides employment for a considerable number, mostly small children, and a certain amount of agricul ture, the Qainat has no other employment to offer, and in consequence there is much distress throughout the district. Sistan. —Section VI gives some idea of the conditions of life of the agri cultural class which comprises the majority of the population. The Oriental Carpet Manufacturing Company have opened a new factory in the town of Nasratabad, which will give employment to a few, and a new town-planning scheme has also provided a certain number of the unemployed with work at rates ranging from 15 shahis to 1 kran per day. (b) Unemployment. —In both Sistan and the Qainat there are thousands of unemployed. A certain number of them have been conscripted for the army in the Sistan area, but with opium smoking rife amongst all classes the material is not good and a large number have been rejected as unfit. The Qainat is to provide 800 conscripts during 1929-30. Such employment, although undoubtedly beneficial to the individual, is not however regarded favourably. 33. (c) and (d) Public health and hygiene — Municipalities. —Eirjand, possibly owing to its situation, has escaped the town-planning schemes which have been introduced in the other towns of East Persia. The district is not unhealthy, the bazaars are clean and a certain amount of work has been done by the Municipal Committee to improve sanitary arrangements. The local Governor has recently imported pumping machinery to improve the condition of Birjand town water-supply, but the scheme is temporarily delayed owing to lack of agreement with his choice of a site for its installation. The new market at Nasratabad (Sistan) has practically been completed and is a consi derable improvement on the old unsavoury bazaars. Since last years’ report was submitted the Municipal doctor has been provided with drugs and instru ments, and the local Municipal authorities are now arranging a site for the erection of a hospital which will be fitted with an operation theatre and electrically lighted. It is doubtful however whether sufficient funds can be raised speedily. The Soviet Consulate also has been reinforced by a Medical Officer who dispenses drugs free of charge. At present, however, any major operations can only be performed in the British Consulate hospital. The health of the population is on the whole good, which is due to the health- giving north wind, which blows continuously for 120 days, and which accom panied as it is with sandstorms and intense heat, most unpleasant to endure, tends to keep the district free of malaria. (e) Emigration. —There have been no further reported instances of emigra tion to Russian Turkestan from this area during the year, hut a resumption is not unlikely, if the pressure now being applied by the Revenue authorities in Sistan on the agriculturists be not relaxed.

Annual Commercial Report of the Provinces of Sistan and the Qainat for the yeur 1927-28. I.—Trade. (a) General conditions of trade .—The striking feature of this year’s trade by the Nushki-Duzdap Railway is the fact that, for the first time since the route was opened, exports from Persia exceed imports in value. The following table shows comparative figures of imports and exports for the three years ending 31st March 1928, together with those for 1920-21 by way of contrast:— IMPORTS. Batmans. Indian Thoosands of Maunds. krans.

Imports .—Appendix “ A ” shows the import figures for various com modities. The largest individual item is cotton piece-goods, which remained stationery at 14’30 million krans, or 35*2 per cent, of tiw*—~ entire import trade. The monopoly tax commodities Ctoa—^B^*Tsugat^, u r , however, fell from 16'02 to 10-93 million krans, or 26’9 pqr cent, of total \UD\N 1iirmorts. This further fall was foreseen in last year’s report, m which it was pointed out that the crushing burden of the so-called monopoly taxes result in lessened consumption and serious injury to the import trade. 1 ia this falling-off in imports of tea and sugar is hitting the Persian (jovernmenfc itself hard will be seen from Appendix “ C ”, which shows Peisian Customs receipts for the year, compared with previous years ; customs proper tell trom 5-09 million krans in 1926-27 to P26 millions in 1927-28, monopoly taxes trom 3-46 to 2’35 millions and compound road tax from 1 69 to 1’38 million. An increase from 2'25 to 4-58 million krans in imports of metals will be noticed. Except for a certain amount of sheet copper this item represents Persian silver coinage imported from Quetta and Kandahar, there being a bus exchange traffic in krans at those places. The question is, v iy o _ ® se ra ^ ls leave Persia and collect in Quetta and Kandahar in such large quantities as to depress the exchange and make it worth while re-importing them into 1 ersia,. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that they represent the _value, paid in silver at the frontier, of goods smuggled into Persia across the Afghan an Baluchistan frontiers. If so, the value of these invisible imports,_ say krans 4 millions, should be taken into account when comparing the import and export figures for East Persia. t t&gt; •! Exports —The rise in the value of exports by the Nushki-Buzdap Bail way from 32 to 42 million krans is a most encouraging feature m the econo mic situation, especially from the point of view of Persia whose batoce of trade by this route is for the first time m history a favourable one. Appendix “ B ” shows the value of individual items of export. Carpets, which form 53 per cent, of total exports, rose from 18*5 million to 22-3 million krans, o which krans 15‘1 million or 67'7 per cent, come from the Qamat (see paia- araph 6 below). It is difficult, in the absence of official figures, to assess t e contribution of this Consular district to the total tn de, hut it may be roughly estimated at krans 19 millions or 45 per cent. Exports other than carpets rose from 13’6 to 19 8 millions, in spite of the fact that the season was excep tionally dry in the Qainat whose contribution under_ this head was probably not more than 4 millions. The chief increases ^“ e T J n t ^9 shins millions), cotton (-26 to P81 millions), silk cloth ( To to 2 09 millions), s (•78 to 3'29 millions), and turquoises (2-01 to 3'37 millions), all of v uc a e Khorasan products. (b) New items oj trade. —Nil. {c) New trade channels. —Nil. (d) (e) and (/). Competition of foreign goods with those of British Empire orioin. —The following is a comparative statement showing the chief commodities of British Empire origin imported Duzdap during the year, u i _ frrnn her countries :— — British Empire. Other countries. Total. Increase or decrease since 1926-27. ■ Piece-goods . . • • 13,131,367 1,167,440 14,293,807 — 1'8,541 Tea • • * * 8,116,343 1,386,801 9,503,144 —3,651,550 Leather goods . • • • 1,005,908 44,105 1,050,013 —316,531 Cotton thread 831,918 1,550,477 2,382,395 —1,069,496 Haberdashery . . • • 375,264 206,406 681,670 + 5,321 Motor and bycycle* 160,000 1,189,000 1,349,253 — 822,462 Cereals 394,470 ... 394,470 —145,633 Tti view of the almost entire aosencc ui ; ~ f i f rnrn Meshed [Annual Commercial Beport for 1927-28, section 1(A) j ''^KVrman' Report for 1927-28, sections 1(a) and (c)] the strength and ) f the import trade in this line is surprising. Figures for the current “kl year are even more satisfactory; nearly 5 million krans worth ot3 piece-goods were imported in April and May 1928 alone. This fact encourages the hope that when, as seems inevitable, the recklessly-subsidized Russian export of textiles to Persia and elsewhere collapses, British and Indian piece- goods will monopolise the market without difficulty. So far as the trade vid Duzdap is conceroed, our only serious competitor is Japan, which expoited krans 823,275 worth of cotton piece-goods to East Persia by this route. ^ The fall in the next heaviest import of British Empire origin, tea^ from ^ krans 13T to 9*5 millions may be ascribed, as remarked above, to the incidence of the monopoly tax So long as the Persians persist in their suicidal policy of imposing crushing taxes upon the necessities of the poor throughout the country, in order to build a railway which, if it ever comes into existence, will benefit only a few towns in the West, there is little hope of improvement in the tea market. OH '—phe Anglo-Persian Oil Company entered the East Persian market in earnest during the summer of 1^27, establishing agencies at Duzdap, Biriand and Meshed and seriously threatening the Llussian oil monopoly in Khorasan and the Qainat. A Persian educated in England, Mr. G. A Rodd, has b€;en appointed local manager with his headquarters ^ at Birjand. On the whole, Angio-Persian oil may be said to have ousted Russian from the Birjand ' market, but it has not made much headway in Khorasan. At Duzdap it competes with Shell, which is now once more being imported in considerable quantities. Motor Gars .—This is a line in which Great Britain should be much better represented than it is. In April 1927, among several hundreds of American motor vehicles on the roads of East Persia, there was not a single British car, and only one lorry. Consular Officers in this district have done their best since then to introduce British motors, and thanks entirely to their efforts five cars and two lorries of British origin are either already in East Persia or arriving very shortly In addition, three orders for touring cars have been received. Unsuccessful efforts have also been made to interest the Indian agents of two well known British makes in this market. The above-mentioned British cars and lorries have created a very good impression by contrast with the Chevrolet, Dodge and other American cars which have hitherto monopolized the market; their strength and durability, particularly as regards axles and transmission systems, give them a consider able advantage over their rivals on the primitive roads and motorable tracks of East Persia. Moreover, in the case of two or three standard makes, at any rate, ihe low clearance and tendency to overheat which have hitherto been ascribed by hostile propaganda to British cars in general are conspicuous by their absence. It is most regrettable that owing ^ entirely to the apathy of British manufacturers and their agent in India, this daity-expanding market is being allowed to go by default to the American industry. In general, it may be confidently stated that the popularity of foreign goods in this country is due not to any superiority in value for money but to the lack of interest taken by British firms in the Persian market. The quality of such British goods as are to be seen is admitted to be superior. Prices (except perhaps in the case of Russian piece-goods) are on the whole very little higher in each class, and the terms of payment are in many cases better than those offered by foreign firms. A notable exception to the general apathy is the Dunlop Company, who as a result of correspondence with this Consulate through the Department of Overseas Trade have decided to send a British re presentative to Duzdap and to push the sales of Dunlop tyres in competition with Goodyears which at present monopolize the market. {g) and (h). Overtrading and Commercial morality .—There is a distinct tendency to overtrade among both Persian and Indian merchants and many businesses are conducted on far too low a reserve. This, however, is not confined to East Persia among Middle Eastern countries. The standard of commercial morality is not high ; n evertheless, of the three c nsiderable bankruptcies which took place during the year only one was definitely fraudulent, and bills on the whole were well met.II and III.— Financial and Taxation. The remarks under these heads in the Meshed Consulate General Commer cial Report for 1927-28, sections 3 and 4, apply with equal force to the Qainat, which is economically a part of Khorasan. The situation in Sistan [for reasons given below (section 5)] is worse than in the Qainat. IV. —Military. (a) Commandeering of transport. —No considerable movement of troops took place during the year under report and the dislocation of trade by commandeering of transport by the military was negligible. (h) Extortions and interference with trade. —Sistan remained the head quarters of a brigade of troups (strength roughly 1,000 of all arms) throughout the year. Until the autumn of 1927, when Sarhang Azizullah Khan was in command, there was little or no extortion or interference with trade. After his transfer the conduct of the troops deteriorated somewhat, and until the Brigade left for Khwash in April- May 1928 there was a certain amount of oppression and extortion by the military. (c) Conscription —Has only been applied to a very limited extent in Sistan and the Qainat, the total number of recruits raised during the year being not more than five or six hundred. As there is a considerable amount of unemployment throughout the country, this recruiting does no harm. V.— Agricui -tu re. Sistan. —The following statement compiled from information supplied by the Revenue Department shows the approximate cultivated area and yield in Sistan for the year 1927-28 : — Cultivated area ...... 2,315,950 acres.* Yield {Tabrizi kharvars, 650 lbs.) Wheat. iiarley. Straw. Other grains. Cotton. Melons. 59,976 53,399 56,838 1,316 2,165 195,681 The poverty and backwardness of Sistan have often been reported on by this Consulate. They are directly attributable (i) to a thoroughly bad system of land tenure, by which the lard belongs to the Crown and is farmed out to mustajirs on short lease, {ii) to the remoteness and isolation of the district w r hich cut it off from its natural markets and also place it far beyond the reach of possible reforming influences from the capital. In the Qainat, w r here the land is almost entirely in private ownership, the land tax is practically the only direct charge on the cultivator, and the population, in spite of the extreme poorness of the soil and the scarcity of w r ater, is relatively prosperous. In Sistan, on the other hand, the State and the mustajirs between them take 70 per cent, or more of the produce, with the result that the peasantry are little more than slaves ; deprived alike of security of (enure and of a fair share in the profits of their labour, they have insufficient incentive to improve either the land or their ow r n agricultural methods, with the result that in spite of the existence of a rich alluvial soil throughout the district and unlimited w r ater to irrigate it, the crops raised are scanty and of inferior quality. The geographical isolation of the Sistan oasis is accentuated by the complete absence of State constructed reads or bridges : only with the utmost difficulty can motor vehicles reach Sistan at all from the outside world, and, once there, owing to the network of unbridged canals they can go now 7 here else. The result is that *The figure given in this Consulate Trade Report for 1925-26, 130,000 acres, is incorrect. i&amp; not known on what information this estimate was based.5 it costs between Rs. 2 and Rs. 3 according to the season to transport Sistan grain to Duzdap, and it pays (allowing for the superior quality) to import flour from the Punjab* rather than from Sistan, the natural granary of East Persia, scarcely eighty miles from the main Duzdap-Meshed road. This is a typical ^ example of the manner in which Persia’s much-deplored “ adverse balance of trade ’ is achieved. Qainat. —No figures are available for the Qainat. The total area of this district is about 22,500 square miles, of which probably less than 1 per cent, is cultivated. {b) Introduction of new crops and new methods : machinery —Nil. (c) Harm done by requisitioning of Alimentation Services. —Nil. (d) Irrigation — Sistan. —The supply of water from the Helmand was about 20 per cent, below normal during the season 1927-28. Qainat. —The winter and spring rains of 1926-27 were over 50 per cent, below normal and there was a corresponding shortage of water in the springs and qanats on which the district almost entirely depends. Daima (rain- irrigated) crops altogether failed. (#) Extent to which land hypothecated. —No figures available. {f) Part played by opium in prosperity of province — Sistan. —According to figures supplied by the Revenue Department, the total weight of opium grown in Sistan during the year was 150 lbs., and it was sold at krans 128 per batman (Rupees 450 per Indian maund). Qainat. —No figures available. VI.— Industry. The only industry of importance in this province is car pet-weaving. Birjandi carpets have caught the fancy of Europe and America during the last few years and the industry has grown out of all recognition, as will be seen from the following figures :— Export of carpets from Duzdap in Value in thousands of krang. 1920-21 667-4 **** x-*** 1925- 26 1926- 27 1927- 28 13,035-4 18,503-1 22,320-6 The Qain (including Sistan) has now left Khorasan and even Kerman far behind in output of carpets. The following table shows the value of carpets exported from Birjand and Meshed respectively, together with the countries of destination :— Value (In thousands of krans). Exported to From the Qainat. From Khorasan. From Kerman. (Vide Kerman Consulate Commer cial Report for 1927-28). England .... U. S. A India .... Other countries . 4,146-1 1,356-6 9,327-4 332-7 2,441-3 3,424-0 1,102-8 189-8 V 12,045-9 -&gt; Total 15,162-8 7,157-9 12,045-9 * 1,650 kharvars (13,729 maunds) of Punjab flour were imported during 1927-28.During the year a very large number of new looms were set up, not only in the Qainat but in Sistan, where the standing-loom carpet had never before been woven. This latter development is due to the enterprise of Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Ltd., whose local manager, Sardar Gurbachan Singh, has done excellent work in establishing what is practically a new industry in Sistan. (d) Electricity. —The only electric plant in the district, apart from one or two small lighting sets, is at Nasratabad (Sistan), where the hereditary Governor, Samsam-ud-Daula, importe 1 three years ago a steam engine and dynamo with which he lights the main streets of the town and works three flour mills, a cotton-ginning machine and a cinema. The fuel used is brush wood, of which there is an almost unlimited sup[ly in the jungles of the Sistan delta. (e) Mines. —None. Eoads. («) 'New roads. —None. (b) Upkeep of old roads. —The Duzdap-Mesbed road which traverses this district for some 400 miles has been extensively repaired and improved, and it is now possible to motor from Duzdap to Meshed (600 mi es) in 48 hours. Lorries frequently cover the dislance in 4 days. There are still, however, few or no bridges or even culverts, and the road is liable to be seriously breached at any time durino the cold weather. ic) Forced labour.— on occasions by the Revenue Department in Sistan, but the effects made to keep up even the few cart tracts of the oasis are very half-hearted and the total amount of free labour t ms secured by the State is small. (d) Effect of motor transport on rates and turnover.—There are now so many light American lorries on the Duzdap-Meshed road that competition is fierce and rates have fallen to a level with which animal transport cannot compete, namely, 10 to 12 shahis (2—2^ annas) per kharvar per mile. Very few camels are now seen on the main Duzdap-Meshed road. On the Sistan &lt; Duzdap and Sistan-Birjand roads so few motors ply (owing to the badness of the “ roads ”) that ihe bulk of the trade is still carried by camel or donkey, the rate being slightly under \ kran per kharvar per mile. Turnover is not much affected by the increased speed of traffic, as merchants Dade on a basis ol large stocks and slow turnover. The motto “small profits, quick returns” is not one tliat appeals either to the Indian or to the Persian tiader. In other words, merchants are not prepared to pay more than a small premium, say 5 or 10 per cent., for the 90 per cent, saving of time resulting from the use of motors as opposed to animal transport. (e) Security. —Has on the whole been good. Only one serious raid took place on a ma n route. In December 1927 near Bandan, 46 miles from Sistan on the Birjand road, a gang of Afghan outlaws from Parah district raided a caravan carrying carpets belonging to the Standard Carpet Company and wool belonging to the Russian Consulate and other owners. Ihe wool was left but the carpets and all the camels were taken across the bor ler. The gang has since been rounded up by the Afghan authorities, and some of the stolen property is said to have been recovered, but neither goods nor compensation has as yet been received by the owners. Social. {a) Standard of living—Qainat.—The standard of living in this district is very much the same as that in other rural districts of the Persian plateau. There are only two towns, of wffiich the larger, Birjand, boasts a population of barely 9,000 souls while the smaller, Qain, is little more than a large village. Unskilled labour in the Qainat earns krans 2 and skilled 8—10 krans per day. Sistan.—Ovrm% to the causes mentioned in section 5 above the standard of living in Sistan is probably low r er than in any other part of Persia. A large proportion of the population live on little but a handful of gritty flour and a7 pinch of opium a day. Unskilled labour receives l-l^S krans and skilled 4-6 krans pet' diem. Uor lack of outside markets the agricultural products of the oasis are exceedingly cheap and there is thus little actual distress. (ft) Unemployment .—The inhabitants of both Sistan and the Qainat are very prolific, and there is a considerable pressure of population on the land, with resulting unemployment. The problem has not yet however reached serious proportions, as recruiting for the Army and the Amnieh (rural police) has drawn off part of the surplus. (c) and (d) Public health and hygiene ; municipalities .—In Birjand, which is not too remote to be influenced by modern ideas from Tehran and Meshed, there are signs of an awakening of public opinion as regards health and hygiene, and the bazaars compare favourably with those of an avenge Indian town. Thanks to good air and water the health of the population is on the whole good. Much the same applies to Duzdap. On the other hand, tbe mud villages of Sistan, of which the district headquarters, Nasratabad, is merely one, remain much the same as they have been since the Middle Ages; there is a municipal doctor, but he has no drugs or instruments, and the only hospital in the whole oasis is that of the British Consulate. It is a curious fact, however that the place is by no means unhealthy, cholera, malaria and several other diseases epidemic in various parts of India being unknown. This is partly at any rate due to the health-giving north wind which blows on two out of three days throughout the year, especially in the summer. There are Municipal Committees in all three towns, but owing chiefly to lack of funds they are able to effect very little beyond elementary sanitation, a minimum of street-lighting and an occasional abortive experiment in town-planning. (e) Emigration —There has been during recent years a good deal of emi gration from Sistan to Russian Turkistan, and the process continues. About 500 families are said to have emigrated from Mian Kangi district alone. C. P. SKRINE, I.C.S., His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan ar d Kain. Camp Birjand, 7th September 1928.
