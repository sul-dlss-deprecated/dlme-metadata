No. 3/718 dated Pth July, 1946. ^ The chief claim that Bahrain has to the Bhopls and islands lying between Bahrain and Qattar is 'b^sed upon the fact th?^t at one time Q^ttar belonged to the Shaikhs of Bahrain who subsequently became pos sessed of Bahrain and therefore acquired the shoals and islands lying between the two shores. At a l^ter date the grandfather of the present Shaikh o^ Qattar became the ruler of Qatt^r but did not at any time assert his authority over the islands between Qattar and Bahrain^ 2. Regarding the two iabira islands which lie between Bahrain and Saud i-i^^i 3 &gt;* these were acquired by purchase by Sulman bin Daij Al-khalifah who bought them from Al-Brnicham tribe in whose possession they were. The tribe lived nt Al-Kusain, a spring on the shore 20 miles north of Al-Khobar. I understand that a s^le document exists regarding this transaction but I have not seen it. I enclose a list of the cairns which were erected on the various ree^s and islands. They were built during 1357 and l^.^P. Nos. 1 to 18 are the Hawar rroup. ■3.

I have th^pleasure to refer to Your Excellency , s letter No. C/729 'dated 9th July, 1946 (10th Shaban, 1366). Perhaps Your Excellency knows that the name with which Bahrain is known at present is not its original name, but Bahrain is a general name for the western ^rab territoMcs bordering the western coasts of the Gulf, this (Bahrain) is only (A'wal) and (ii'wal) is an island in Bahrain, and it is understood tnat this island has no contrary to ^atar which is ^a l-.rge territory ana ' depe^^^ncies, coasts, and islands. If we took into the question from the point view of equality, ^atar is to be entrusted with Deebil and Jaradah i ? ashts which are situated between ^atar and Bahrain, and they are nearer to Qatar. You see that ^atar has been treated unjustly in her clear right in the question of Hawar islands which I am still tenacious to claim their ownership, then how about the others I This is what has come to my mind to write Your Excellency about. I hope you are enjoying a good health. 1/* U.Li. Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. iLM Date..Hi D.O. No. /*? % - fs? Adviserate, Baiirain. July 22, 1946. Reference your c/791 of 21st July 1946. I think that if the whole question of the ownership of the seas and islands around Baiirain is under consideration, Eis Highness should be consulted on the matter and given an opportunity of putting forward his claims. Your letter was marked 'Secret', so I have not discussed the matter with His Highness. I am sorry that my para 1 was not clear. This is the line of the argument. The Khalifah originally ruled in Q^atar, this fact I think is not in dispute. They had their chief town at Zubara and Dohah did not exist as a place of any importance. From Zubara the Khalifah control led the Q,atar coast opposite to Bahrain and the islands off the coast. From Zubara they invaded Bahrain and turned out the Persians; they occupied Bahrain making their first set- tleiuent at Jaw on the east coast of Bahrain, opposite Q^atar. At the same time they continued to keep up their town at Zubara and they controlled the sea and the islands lying between Bahrain and Qatar. At a later date, when the Khalifah were in occupation of Bahrain and the Qatar coast around Zubara the Al-Thani family acquired influence on the east coast of Qatar and the grandfather of the present Shaikh of Qatar became Shaikh of Qatar with his headquarters at Dohah. The Al-Thani family was recognised as the Ruling Family of Qatar but their rule never extended beyond the mainland of Qatar and was never exercised over the seas and islands situated between Qatar and Bahrain, the Khalifah contend too that it was never even exercised over the whole of the Qatar peninsular because Zubara, until comparatively recently belonged to the Khalifah. Therefore it is argued that the islands and shoals lying between Bahrain and Qatar belong to Bahrain. Lieut. Colonal A. C. Galloway, O.B.S., C.I.3. H. B. M's political Agent, ^ ^ Bahrain.

I am sorry to have been so long in replying to your D.O• No. 815-dated 24tli July 1946. Fashts Deebel and Jaradeh lie within the area which was subject to negotiations between the Bahrain Government and Petroleum Concessions Ltd,, and Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited in the year 1938 when both these companies were competing for an oil concession over the additional area, not included in the area granted by the original concession. During all these negotiations the Political Agent, Bahrain, was present, also His Highness Shaikh Sulman, myself and usually Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa. The Petroleum Concessions Limited produced a map, an enlargement of one made by the Land Department, on which the Company marked in red ink the area over which they sought a concession. It is possible that you have a copy of this map in your files but in case this is not so I am forwarding my own copy, which please return. During all the talks on the subject no question was ever raised which would throw any doubt on Bahrain's ownership to this group of shoals and islands and when even tually the concession was granted to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., the boundaries of the concession area, lying between Bahrain and Qatar included the two fashts in question. Therefore, at a later date, the Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., was permitted to drill an artesian well in the island at Jaradeh which was for the benefit of Bahrain boats in that locality. His Highness wishes me to enquire whether anybody is laying claim to these shoals and islands which he states are part of the Bahrain archipelago. TejTit.J Captain H.D,H. Ranee, H. B.

After due consideration, therefore, the Company has decided to postpone operations in the open waters to the North of Bahrein (Locations 'B', 'C' &amp; 'D' on the map BR-486/1 transmitted to you with my letter No. C/PA-247 dated 13th May, 1946) until more favourable weather conditions prevail. $. 2-^- However, inasmuch as equipment and personnel are available and in order to avoid delays in their exploration work as set forth in Article V of the Deed of Further Modification dated 19th June, 1940, the Company proposes that work shall start immediately on the drilling of Structure Holes on Hawar Island, for which prior approval has been given in H.B.M.'s Political Agent's letter No. C/1C19-10/14 dated 30th October, 1941; the drilling of these structure holes was deferred at the request of the Political Agent in his letter No. C/1596 dated 20th October, 1942 due to the political situation then existing and arising out of contin gencies of war. p — t } f k ^ Geological information from location 'J' shown on the above mentioned map BR-486/1 and situated on the sandbank Sowad Janubiya, adjacent to Hawar Island, is necessary for structural interpretation and the Company propose that this structure hole shall be drilled while they have personnel and equipment on Hawar I will be glad to receive your comments on the above programme and request that you pass on, to the Adviser CoTifidential.

Dear Sir, In view of the unsettled weather conditions which prevail at this time of the year, making structure drilling operations in the open waters to the North of Bahrein impracticable, the Company has decided to postpone their exploration work in the vicinity of Fasht al Jarim and resume the operations on Hawar Island which were interrupted by political difficulties arising out of the war. Your letter No. 2165/20-19 dated 12th November, 1941 grants the Company permission to drill two structure holes on Hawar Island but, for the interpretation of any structural anomaly which may exist in that area, it will be necessary to drill additional structure holes on the Island and at least one on 'the adjacent sandbank, Sowad Janubiya. The exact number and location of additional structure holes can best be determined as the work progresses ^ill you please advise if there is any restriction to the number and location of the structure holes which the Company may drill in this area.

March 194-7. His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, The Agency, BAHREIN, Dear Sir, Thank your for your letter No. C/392 dated 25th March, 194-7, indicating (1) that His Majesty^ Government has no objection to the drilling of structure holes on Hawar Island at points indicated by the letters M G rf and 'H tf and 'I' on Map BR-4-86/I transmitted to you under cover of my letter No. C/PA-24-7 dated May 13th, 194-6, (2) that such structure holes should be drilled above high water mark on Hawar Island and (3) that H .m .G. does not wish the Company to drill at the point indicated by the letter 'J' on the above mentioned map pending the defining of the precise limits of Hawar Island. May I request your reconsideration of the proviso that all structure drilling shall be above high tide mark on Hawar Island. Plans drawn up by the Company for this work require the drilling of these structure holes by equipment mounted on a barge which will be floated onto a beach at high tide and sunk by opening a sea cock. On completion of one structure hole the barge will be refloated (by closing the sea cock and pumping out the water) and moved to the next location. A very large saving in transportation equipment and the necessary operating personnel can be achieved by this method but the location of the structure holes will be slightly below high water mark. May I suggest that some latitude in this connection be permitted while observing the intent of the proviso in principle. Your early advice on this matter will be appreciated. ^ s, ^ .03 Will you please advise the Bahrein Government regarding this structure drilling program on Hawar Island and confirm that they are in accord with the Company's proposals. Also, on the basis of the request in my letter No. FA-40 dated 4th February 194-7? addressed to The Adviser, which was attached to letter No. C/PA-273 dated 4th February 1947, determine and advise if there is any restriction to the number and location of structure holes which the Company may drill in this area other than that already defined in your letter No. C/392. $1% CoT &amp;aen^ Y ™ rs very J ruly ' .~ r q , R.
