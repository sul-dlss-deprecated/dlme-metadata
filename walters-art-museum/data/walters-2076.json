It has a flat underside with a vertically arranged bottom design with a combination of seven different script signs, six of which appear twice. The design of the scarab's back is simple with short aligned side-notches and well balanced proportions. The piece is simply made and the workmanship is good. \r\n\r\nThis multifunctional amulet should provide royal and divine support, good luck, life, renewal, and protection. The double presence of the six signs refers to the creation, and the single sun disc to the creator. The amulet should protect and support its owner in all different situations. The piece was originally mounted or threaded. \r\n\r\nScarabs displaying hieroglyphic sign arrangements without syntactical context are typical for the late Middle Kingdom and the Hyksos Period.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1911 (?)", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/28134", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1911 (?)
