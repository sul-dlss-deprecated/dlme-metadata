We have no confirmation that Dimitry Iv&amp;noff and Boris Brodski were in fact the men responsible for the 1946 strike in Ahwas. Dear Lance, You will recall that during our conversation on May 10 I mentioned a report which we have received from a 'reliable source' with regard to a program for the organisation of strikes, sabotage and technical accidents in American petroleum establishments in the Middle East According to this report orders have been sent from Moscow to establish in the Middle East a section of 'Soviet-Nefto-Indust' for the purpose of organising strikes, sabotage and technical accidents in American petroleum establishments in the Middle East. The report states that one 'Evssenko' will be in charge assisted by 'petroleum engineers Dimitry Ivanoff and B^e Boris Brodski' who are described as the 'men responsible for 1946 strike Anglo- Iranian station at Ahwaz Iran.' These men are reported to 'be at present in Beirut whence they are expected reach Cairo May 15. The report adds that the Egyptian authorities amy take action to_ stop them; if so, other unknown personnel of the same mission wilj probably go to Egypt. Yours sincerely, Sd/- A.C. Stewart.

The letter is a covering letter to an enclosed copy of another letter that was sent from Lewis Jones (American Embassy, London) to Lance F L Pyman of the Foreign Office on 11 May 1948. This letter concerns a report ('from a reliable source') that alleged that the Government of Russia had sent orders for the establishment of a network in the Middle East for the purpose of 'organising strikes, sabotage and technical accidents in American petroleum establishments in the Middle East'. The report named three individuals said to have been tasked with creating this network (Evssenko, Dimitry Ivanoff, and Boris Brodski) and claimed that they were currently in Beirut and headed to Cairo. The report also claimed that Ivanoff and Brodski were responsible for a strike at an Anglo-Iranian Oil Company station in Ahwaz, Iran in 1946. In the covering letter, Stewart states that there was no confirmation that they were the two individuals responsible for this strike.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000127#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
