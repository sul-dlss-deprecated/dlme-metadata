British Consulate General, Meshed. 4th August,1937. My dear Minister, At an interview which I had with the Governor General at Meshed on July 15th,I mentioned to hi i the subject of the customs searches carried out all along the road between Mir^awa and Meshed and the very great inconvenience caused thereby to Indian pilgrims and other bona fide travellers,vide esnecially paragraph lo9 of ay last political diary. 2. fhere is a very considerable amount of smuggling going on and the worst offenders are apparently Iranian officials on tour and on transfer. Several of them have recently been caught with large quantities of contraband at Bir^and.^* Pilgrims ,however, are rarely concerned with smuggling and I suggested that if it was indeed desired to encourage the pilgrim traffic (and travellers generally) in Iran,some method of dispensing with the repeated customs searches which at present take Jlace should be devised. 3. I told him that I had recently been compelled to advise that pilgrims from India wishing to visit Mecca and i the holy places in Iraq should avoid the difficulties of the H i land route in Iran and proceed by ship direct from Karachi. (I enclose this connection a copy of ray d.o. :lo. 733 dated the 3rd June 1937 to Hay and its enclosures). I added that whereas I had been Informed that in the past there had been as many as 1000 Indian pilgrims in Meshed at a time,the number actually in the city on that had been reported to me as exactly one. pakrev&amp;n replied that,though the road south of Bir^and was beyond his jurisdiction,he would write about it to fehran. 4. Subsequently when I saw him again on the 29th,he /informedinformed me that he had written personally on this subject to the president of the counoil (as this would he more likely to receive attention than an ordinary letter to the department concerned) suggesting that if the policy of the Government really was to encourage visitors something should he done urgently to lessen their difficulties. He also suggested that if our Legation in lenran would mention the matter in the proper quarter this might he of assistance I promised him that X would write to you on the subject. 5. fhe recent efforts mad© by the central Government in Tehran to improve matters in East Iran iaximp:KjKat«:xiaatk®rs; do not appear to have had any appreciable effect. The petty officials at every customs examination post still insist on a small present from every traveller,and if this is not forthcoming,a minute search of the whole of his luggage is carried out and some pretext for making further difficulties is easily discovered. instances have been reported in my diaries from time to time though nothing of sufficient importance has occurred to warrant a separate complaint. Of all the posts on the road that at Birjand has the worst reputation for rapacity. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Colonel parsons under my B.Q. number 152. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) G.F. Squire.COPY E 3733/584/34) No. 367/3/37 The attitude of the Iranian authorities revealed in your letter recording your Coronation junkettings in the closing paragraph of your despatch No.44 of the 1st June and in what you reported earlier about the bullying of former servants of the Consulate-General has rather shocked us. You will remember that when the Government of India appointed a member of 0 the Indian Civil Service and not a man If military origin to succeed Daly we told the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that we hoped for a friendlier attitude on the part of their local officials, and Soheily then Under Secretary of State promised to speak winged words to Pakrevan. We are now disposed to consider whether we should take any further action. 2, Broadly speaking there are two aspects of the boycott; first that of callers. It is quite illogical that when some 150 Iranians, including many officialpersons, accept His Majesty’s Minister’s invitations to his social gatherings in Tehran only four officials should be allowed to accept similar invitations in the provinces. If, however, the Iranian Government insist on restricting contacts in the provinces we can I think in the end a only acquiesce, provided that the restriction is enforced on foreign Consulates without discrimination. And if the restriction is applied to Soviet Consular Officers there might conceivably be a balance of advantage in leaving things as they are. We gathered from Urquhart that at Tabriz the boviet Consulate is watched even closer than our own. At Meshed we suspect that things are rather different; that Pakrevan is friendly with the Russian Consul General and that you enjoy (with composure) least-favoured-nation treatment. •F.Squire Esq., I.C.S., ^•/ His Majesty’s Consul General, Meshed. 17th June, 19373. The other aspect of the boycott includes the persecution of former Consular employees, the spying on members of the Consulate General and their visitors, the football episode at Zabul and what you call the 'commercial' boycott at Meshed where tradesmen can visit you virtually only with Police permission. (It is nearly as bad at Shiraz). All this petty persecution is clearly going far beyond what the Iranian Government have any title to do. 4• In all the circumstances we would like to have your considered advice and recommendations before we decide on further action. If we take it, it would be more useful if it included practical suggestions for improving matters that stand some faint chance of acceptance. Also if you ask us to try and get any aspect reversed, it would be essential to have chapter and verse for the treatment objected to - you have been very good in giving us this. The enclosed copy of a letter from Soheily dated the 2nd February, 1936, a good deal of which was sent to Daly in a private and personal letter of the 7th February, shows how attached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are to the method of evading or side-stepping the real points at issue. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter, without the enclosure to Metcalfe and to Rendel. (Signed) H.J.Seymour.Translation of a note from Monsi eur A. Soheily, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Third Political Department) to His Majesty's 1314 (2nd February, 1936). My dear Friend, 1957 Mr. Mallet, the former Counsellor to His Britannic Majesty s Legation, on his return from his last trip to Khorassan, referred to me and, in the course of his conversations, stated that the local officials in Meshed had adopted a special attitude towards the British Consulate General in that town and that they were not attending the parties given by the Consul General and had placed the latter in a worse situation than that of other foreign Consuls. He further complained that following a shooting trip made by him in the neighbourhood of Meshed a number of Iranians as well as some of the British Indian subjects were given some trouble and that even some of them were driven away from their homes. Mr. Mallet subsequently addressed a letter on the 28th Aban last (20th November, 1935) on the subject of the last item and complained against the events which have arisen in connection with his visit to Khorassan. I did not fail to refer to the competent quarters at that time the subjects of complaint of Mr. Mallet with a request that necessary enquiries may be made in the matter. Some days ago a reply was received of which the summary was communicated verbally to His Excellency Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen by Monsieur Motamedy. Now, in order that Mr. Mallet 1 s letter may not remain unanswered, I write this to confirm the matter as follows: The statements made by Mr. Mallet regarding the 1. relations between the local officials and the Consulate General in Meshed are not justified since, according to information feceived, the Governor General of Khorassan, the Heads of the Municipality and the Police are usually attending the parties given by the British Consulate on official festivals and on the occasion/occasion of the anniversary of the Silver Jubilee of late Majesty King George, the Governor-General of Khorassan accepted the Consul-General’s invitation to dinner and attended the party. On every occasion that the Consul General has aslced for an appointment or v/henever he had had businesses, he has been duly received and has never been given a different treatment from that accorded to other foreign Consuls resident in Meshed and there is no ground for the British Consul-General’s fear that he is placed in a worse situation than others. 2. The suppositions made by Mr. Mallet to the effect that following his trip to Khorassan a number of people were placed in difficulty are based on certain assumptions for which no proper justification can be admitted and that even some of the circumstances alluded to by Mr. Mallet were either being investigat ed before his arrival there or lacked foundation. For instance,the decision for the expulsion of 5 British subjects in Murdad last (July-August) was taken before the trip of Mr.Mallet to Khorassan and was in no way connected with this gentleman’s visit to that province. The deportation of Ismail was due to his being involved in smuggling and it was arranged, following this decision that this person should be sent to his native place,Azerbaijan, and was in no way connected to Mr. Mallet’s trip. With regard to the statement made to the effect that an Iranian subject placed at the disposal of Major Hamber and his wife a summer residence in the neighbourhood of Meshed and that the man was deported for this reason, no records are traced of this matter and that enquiries made of the competent quarters have revealed the inaccuracy of this statement. The allegation made regarding the arrest of the Turcoman is also denied since none of the competent quarters are aware of the arrest of such a Turcoman. Apart from this, the despatch of the Amnieh guard to the hinting-ground in the company of Mr. Mallet was only with a view to facilitating the latter’s journey and that of his party and the statement made to the effect that the reason for sending the/the Amnieh guards was with a view to keeping a watch on Mr. Mallet s acts is a mater for regret. Finally the fact that Major Hamber's shooting trip to the neighbourhood of Bojnoord was not agreed to was only due to the bad state of the road and to no other reason. I feel sure that the explanations given above will remove all the misunderstandings which have arisen which were based on mistaken assumptions. I avail myself, etc. (Signed) A. Soheily. - j , i »mmma Ho, 202 (72/49/57) Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 12th Hay the Coronation of Their Majesties was duly celebrated in Tehran and by His Majesty’s Consular Officers throughout Iran* 2* At Tehran the Bishop in Persia, who had come from Isfahan for the purpose, took the special Order of Service in the Church lent for the occasion by the American Mission* Hy Staff and I attended in uniform. For reasons of space and to enable as many as possible of the British and British - Indian community to be present, invitations were not sent either to Iranians, the Diplomatic Body or other non-British persons* This was explained in advance to the Head of the protocol Department; the Church was well filled, no British subjects had to be turned away, and some of the American community also attended the Service. 3* In the early afternoon many were able to listen on the Wireless to the coronation service in Westminister Abbey, helped by the Souvenir programme some 200 copies of which had been sold at one toxaan (2/6d) a copy* Reception was good by Tehran standards, the presentation of His Majesty by the Archbishop, and His Majesty’s responses being clearly audible. Subsequently I gave a Garden party in the Legation garden in /Tehran The Right Honourable An thony Aden, M.C*, M*P*, etc*, etc*, etc*, The Foreign Office, S*W*l*— •m mm Tehran, to which British and British Indian Subjects and a few other persons were invited. 4. In the evening, I invited a large number of Iranians, both cfficial and unofficial, the whole of the Biplo atic Body and many British and other leading residents to a Ball. Out of some 350 Iranians invited approximately 140 were pre sent, including ladies in what appeared to be the normal European proportion. After discreet sounding invitations were not issued to any member of the Imperial family. The members of the Italian Legation, as I have reported elsewhere, received instructions on the morning not to take part in the Coronation celebrations and consequently absented themselves, sending no explanation. But they were almost effusively friendly at a Roumanian function on the following day. The Ball guests, and not least the Iranians, demonstrated great friendliness and desire to share in our day of national pride and rejoicing* 5. His Majesty*s Consular Officers gave similar entertain ment. Mr* Squire at Meshed received some 350 guests at a Garden party, nairely British and British Indians, and a fifth of this number at a subsequent Ball* In Khuaistan, where the British Communities are much larger, programmes were ambitious and carried out with uniform success. Ho table features were the presence of the General Officer Cara man ding. General HuInI, to whom I have referred In previous despatches, and his wife at an afternoon Gymkhana. The General, in spite of Illness in his family, stayed for a considerable time, enabling Mr. Gardener to have a very friendly conversation with him. At Khorramshahr the British and Indian communities vied in athletic loyalty and in generosity. Ho less than £.400 were collected for the King George V Fund and Viceregal Charities. I have reason to know how much the foresight and energy of Captain Bazalgette was responsible for this satis factory showing.6* Apert iron loyalty and gratef*ul satisfaction aniong His Ma^®sty*8 Subjects, undoubtedly and inevitably in Iran as it is to-day the other principal feature of the Coronation cele bration© was the participation or non-participation of Iranian nationals; and indeed the occasion threw a good deal of further light on what may be termed the boycott, 7, several of His Majesty’s Consular Officers had consulted me in advance as to how widely they should issue invitations. As already reported semi-offieially, I instructed them, re gardless of the improbality of receiving acceptances, to invite all those persons, official, military or private,whom they could properly and naturally ask to join in our national day of rejoicing. These instructions were acted on and reports now received show that in almost every case the Governor or his deputy referred to Tehran for instructions, enquiring whether any relaxation was to be made in the existing ruling as regards visits to His Majesty’s consulates, Ho relaxation was permitted; further it was made clear to more than one of our Consular Officers that only four officials were permitted to attend such functions, namely the Governor-General or Governor and hie Deputy, the Chief of police and the Chief of the Municipality, General Muinl and Colonel Bayendor were exceptions to this ruling which was otherwise rigidly obeyed. Mo attempt to deny its existence was made by anyone except Monsieur pa kr a van in Meshed who confirmed on this occasion his reputation for unfriendliness and mendacity. His deputy at Meshed implicitly confirmed, but permitted a relaxation of the ’’commercial” boycott which virtually prevents local trademen from visiting the oonsulate—Gen®ral: and at Shiraz it transpired that the Consulate may only be visited by permission of the Chief of the police. In these circumstances the entertainments given by Hi© Majesty’s consular Officers were attended by few Iranians except the officials named, and these few were drawn /usuallyusually from big business#*! including the Aaglo*Iranian Oil Company and the Imperial Hank of Iran. As regards my own Ball there were definitely more Ministers and others present than at a private Ball that I had given in the winter. 8* I feel it only right to repeat that this apparent un friendliness is ’h&gt;y order** - many Consular Officers confirm that it is not by inclination - and that it is universally applied to foreign Consulates# It ie also a fact that great Interest, frankly coloured by admiration, was shewn in the Coronation, in photographs of the Ceremony, in the anticipated film, in the Monarchy and the present sovereign, and In London and what it stands for# 9* I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Aecretary to the Government of India In the External Affairs Department Mo. 91* I have thehonour to be with the highest respect.

Balding continues to be frequent on the border especially 'durmuk'. The road guards are usually too irighj^ned or in too small numbers to offer any effecti^ve protection. 33, The suspicion with which foreign Consulates are viewed does not diminish. Five Iranian subjects who used often to come to the Eabul Consulate for a friendly game of football were recently arrested on leaving the grounds and only released after being kept in custody for 30 hours on furnishing security never to enter the Consulate again. A son of a Consulate employee had to give a similar undertaking before he could secure a post in the Revenue Department. In Meshed past and present employees at the Consulate and anyone suspected of being friendly to the British are arrested and interrogated by the secret police. The mason who has carried out all repairs to the consulate buildings for many years la the latest victim. Apparently a great show of vindictiveness against foreigners Is the only way in which an Iranian official can be sure of retaining his post. 34. A Britten subject.

Sir With reference to raj predecessor*a despatch Jio.12 of the 9th January 1936,1 have the honour to inform you that while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have consistently refused to make any written reply to Sir Hughe Knatchhull Hugossen*a criticisms of the procedure adopted hy the Iranian authorities when expelling British subjects from Iran,on the ground that the matter is one simply of internal administra- ticn.off leials of the Ministry have,nonetheless,given certain verbal assurances,the substance of which is contained in ray circular despatch to His Majesty*s Consular officers i;o.9 of to-day*s date,a copy of which I have the honour to enclose herein. 2 . . I%ese EBBur&amp;noes are on the whole satisfactory, for although it appears that an accused man will still not be given a detailed statement of the charges against him,he should now be sure of receiving a written statement from the Ministry of the Interior that his appeal has been considered, and a total of thirty days grace is allowed for him to wind up his affairs. 3 . It remains to see the value of such verbal assur ances in practice,but the fact that they have been given is at any rate some evidence of good-will on the pert of the I ranian lovernment. 4. I am sanding copies of this despatch to the. Foreign Secretary to the Go varment of India jo .33. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, fhe Right Honourable, Anthony j£&amp;*n &amp;.Q. ,M.P., etc., etc., eta., eta •»Circular jjesuatoh lio^^ 3opi&lt;iS to; l\0, &amp; 1MD1A* Sir, March, 1937 in 1935 a numher of British subjects resident in East Iran were summarily given notice by the Iranian authori ties to leave the country* ry pradeeessor,when •xamining the matter,made a careful study of the procedure adopted by the authorities in such cases and,without prejudice to the rights or wrongs of any individual case,reached the conclusion that the methods of the police were often manifestly unfair towards the persons concerned* It was generally found that the latter wore simply served with a notice to leave the country,no reason whatever for the issue of the notice being given. A right of appeal against this notice existed to the Ministry of the ^uterior,and British subjects generally availed themselves of it; but it is clear that m less a man is aware of the substance of the charge against him,it is virtually impossible for him to draft an appeal in his defence that is worth the paper on which it is written, The next step was usually that the local police informed him that his appeal had been reJected,after which they took immediate steps to expel hi % from the coutry. £• Briefly,the injustices of the system seemed to be (a) that where the person concerned was given no indication of the reason for which the local, police proposed to expel him, his right of appeal was virtually worthless; (b} that he received no reply from the Ministry of the interior to his appeal but was merely notified,often orally,by the local x-)olice{i*o. the authority against whose order he had appealed) that his appeal had failed; and {c) that he was then expelled forthwith without being give ;2 /an# His Majesty’s Consular Officer atajuy time to wind up hi&amp; affaire,a task which he could naturally only he expected to ho gin when he learned of the rejection of hia appeal, g # Sir Hughe K natchhull-*Hugeesen accordingly raised these points with the Iranian Government early in 1936,point ing out that,while he did not wish to ©all in question the undoubted right of the Iranian Sovernment to expel foreign nationals from Iran,the procedure adopted by the authorities often seemed open to objection. He further put forward proposals for remedying each of these points of injustice. Aft ei* numerous discussions with officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,! have now been given an oral assurance that the following procedure will be adopted in future: (1) When the local Governor or the police decide to expel a foreigner,they will give him a written order to leave the country within fifteen days; the order will bear a refer ence to the section of Article E of the Foreigners* a© side nee Law in virtue of which he is being expelled (the text of this law formed the enclosure to Sir R.H. C-live*s circular despatch Mo#IB of 30th May 1931/; {£} if after fifteen days the person concerned has not made any appeal against the order,a second order will be served on him. fhls order will also specify that he is to leave the country within fifteen days from the date of service,and must be obeyed.

Non-official Iranians have called on me on two occasions only - on 1st January 1936 and at the Condolence Reception on the 25th January, neither occasion being a Social Call, 3. I have only been in Kerman four months, so it is difficult for me to express an opinion on local conditions. I have discussed the question privately with Doctor Dodson (30 years in the C.M.S, Hospital, Kerman) and Mr, iliff (10 years in the C.M.S. School), and my views are necessarily based on what they have told me. 4 ^ From the very nature of his work, Doctor Dodson has never suffered from any active anti—British feeling. On the other hand he says the Iranians are not as intimate as they were ten to fpjfeen years ago, but are more friend ly than they were three years ago. Mr. Iliff says that three years ago no Iranian would dare to go to his hou^e or even to speak to him in the road. Iranians now call on him freely and oft^ and are not 'ashamed* to be seen with him in public. 5. Both say, and I am inclined to agree with the* from /what * . 5 s Envoy Extradrdinary and Minister plenipotentiary at the Court of Iran, J r Tehran.what I have heard from other sources, that there never was any hatred against Great Britain, hut that the fear of persecution hy officials prevented intimacy in the first place, and fear ledd to a certain amount of ill feeling against British Subjects. X thank that the call oh the Consulate on the 1st January 6, was made because of a decrease of fear, not mi increase of cour-. age. The ex: Governor-General and ex; Hais-i-Shahfhani had both been friendly, if not intimate, with the Consulate, The latter came to tea, privately, at the end of last year. As a result, I think that a few local non—officials thought that they would not get into trouble if they called on New Year’s Bay. They were not censured, for vailing, and. so, when a reception was given to receive the Iranian officials’ condolences after the death of His Late Majesty, a very much greater number called. 7• In the meantime, however, the Hals—i—Bhahrbani was transf erred to Shiras and a new Bais arrived about two days before the reception. It was he who placed spies on the Consulate and sent for and censured all Iranian callers, 8. His Excellency Aqai Hass an Peernia, the ex; Governor- General had a number of personal enemies in Kerman, One complaint I have heard is that he was 'unbribable” and the first honest Governor-General for many years 2 His Brothers-in-1 aw were invol ved in the Hoads Department contract scandals. Further, his wife is the daughter of a Mullah of Main, who is known to be against the emancipation of women. The local Rais-iMuarif is said to have reported him for slackness in enforcing the unveiling of women, and to have reported his wife for speaking against unveil- ing. It is said that His Excellency is in Tehran now, on the list of Disponsible officials. The charges against him are unknown here, hut it is quite possible that the charge of being pro-British has been included, although this is only rumour.9, After he was summoned to Tehran, he was very careful to do nothing uo make his case worse* For this reason he spent his time giving or attending 'unveiled” parties. It is possible that for fear of a 'pro-British” charge, he tried to prevent Iranians calling on January 26th. It is clear that he went in fear of his subor&amp;inates, among whom he had no friend. 10. There are no signs of a renewal of social relations with the Consulate I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) J.A.IC.

Finally, the police then proposed to expel him forthwith.

From “he Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, To The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London. Dated New Delhi, the'November 1935 Sir, With reference to India Office letter No. P.2. 7860/35, dated the 15th November 1935, regarding the threatened expulsion from Khorasan of certain Berberies of British nationality, I am directed to inform you that the Government of India concur in the a^ction proposed in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Office letter No.E.6266/4982/34, dated the 30th October 1935. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, .fa Foreign Secretary to the Government of India3TIAL. Hote on the Berberis of East Iran by Lieutenant-Colonel C.£. ])aly, C.I.E. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan. This race of Shiah Muhammedans is of Mon 6 ol origin and at one time inhabited the Ghazni and Herat districts of Afghanistan* During the reign of 4k mir Abdur Bahman (grana-father of ex-£ing iimanullah) they were driven out of the country. They had revolted largely on account of religious differences, their Rulers being of the Sunni sect. Some emigrated to British Baluchistan - Quetta and neighbourhood - but the majority settled in iChoraesan and Sistan. Those in British Baluchistan enlisted in numbers in the Indian Army - the Hazara Pioneers - and through them many of their friends anu relatives who had settled in Iran went to Baluchistan to enlist* The children born in Xnaia of parents who originally went to India became British subjects, while the children of parents settled in Iran are Iranian subjects. The Afghan Government and the Iran Government, moreover, agreed that Berberis who had emigrated to Iran before a certain date could retain their nationality, while those subsequently born in Iran would become Iranians• There are thus three nationalities - British, Afghan and Iranian - the majority being oi the latter nationality* During Amanullahs reign a considerable number returned to Afghanistan and are mainly resident in the Horth, while many also are scattered in Soviet Russia on the borders of Afghanistan* AB a race they aie excitable and fanatical - the result possibly of their having been expelled from Afghanistan, as they allege.owing to religious persecution. The Hazara Pioneers were disbanded some three yearb ago, mainly I believe because of the fact that, although good fighters, the men were prone to intrigue and excitement, and were found unsuitable* Some, whose parents had originally settled in India, remained there, but many came to Iran, both because the majority of their race Is in the country and oecause the Shiah Shrine at Meshed is naturally a great centre of attraction. Almost all are cultivators. Of the disbanded soldiers, some were eligible for Military Pensions and there are 17 who draw their pensions from the Treasury of this Consulate General. Of these pensioners 7 are British subjects and the remainder Iranian or Afghan. 4 British subjects are resident in Meshed and 3 in villages. Of the other 10, 4 are in Meshed and 6 in villages. There are in addition 4 Iranian Berber! pensioners who receive their pensions at Zabul* The fact that any pensions at all are drawn from this Consulate General is a source of considers!#!* embarrassment, for particularly in the case of Iranian subjects, it is liable to be construed that these persons are in our 'pay' for some nefarious object. Sven the British Berberis who draw their pensions are of course, closely allied and inter-married with Iranian a v, uur Registers show that 37 British or Afghan Berheris. our Regies Berheri subjects have been registered as from 3®. , , and it is not Mown how many have failed to register - a nv now in Khorassan. Moreover, British many arc actually n° w 1 r • name and go on the pilgrimage. About Berberis from India come ana g 4 „ are resident in Meshed am 17 of the British Berben country, cultivators in the surrounding country the remainder are cultivavoAS foreigners they do not own land but wori for Iranian Berberis or others* It is believea that all told, British and others, there are about 400 Berberis permanently resident in Meshed. The number in the surrounding 'villages was estimated some years ago as 20,000 to 30,0 00 families, most of whom are Iranian subjects - some Afghans and about 20 or less British* The total Berber! population has presumably since in creased* as stated above they are excitable, and always mix up in any disturbance* I am told there never has been any disturbance in Khorassan in which the Berberis have not taken part. They were certainly involved IB the disorder on the Zurabad frontier and I think it safe to say that if excited by the religious leaders they will always join any movement set on foot* As regards the recent disturbances in Meshed [duly 1S35) the causes are so obvious as to require no inquiry. Some of the ignorant and fanatical element of the population staged a protest against the oraer super seding the Kullah Pehlavi by foreign hats, and particular ly against the movement for discarding the veil by women. The chief agitator appears to have been one Sheik Bahlul, of whose existence prior, to tnese disturbances this Consulate had no inowledge. He has been described in the press as a notorious agitator and criminal. If this be the case, it is truly remarkable that at the time his agitation started be was actually „ was supported by another agitator a shrine pensioner. He na P . . +ar was actually an employe named Jfawab Ittisham. The la •. i« said that he removed from his of the Shrine, ana it ifa sai h + of the official uniform he was wearing and head the hat of the oiaicxa . lt t0 Bh reds. while haranguing the crowd. tore it to anrean, ttot the This is abundantly sufficien movement/movement was spontaneous ana not at the outset connected erith the Berbers, neither is tnere any indication, or I thinJc any truth, in the statement that prior to the dis turbances the number ox Berneris in the town had increased The agitators having been allowed to continue their speeches all day, late at night their audience had dwindled to some 15o persons, who may presumably have been their staunchest supporters. In the early hours of the morning an abortive attempt to clear the Shrine was made by the military ana firing was resortea to. Unfortunately the Shrine was not cleared ana the ring leaders not arresteu. jpur the following two days no steps were taken to check tne agitation ana still more strange, no action to debar more people from entering the Shrine. Then undoubtedly villagers came in from the surrounding country armed with sticks, knives, etc* It is, I think, well known that some of the petty Mullahs sent messages inviting the villagers to support the agitation, as most of the villagers are in fact Serberis it is not sur prising that there numbers were augmented. iJevertneletie of some 7o0 or 800 persons arrested when the Shrine was finally cleared, I am informed there were not more than some 2W&gt; or possibly 250 Berceris, and among these were no British subjects. There was, however, one Hirrami subject - a laid of about 20 - unknown to the Consulate. Hu 1* sttid ,. hT»fikf=&gt;r in the town. His parents have been a petty oroier xu , o vuwe outside.

It is not known who they are. In any case those in the outlying villages only come once in 3 or 4 months to draw their pensions* I do not know what should he our attitude towarus any pensioner who voluntarily involves himself in anti-governmental disturbances of this nature and inaicentally causes highly unwelcome suspicion to fall upon us* I am indineu to think that he merits loss of his pension* In any case the disbursement uy us of pensions to Iranian subjects in Iran seems objectionable and I cannot help thinking that fin view of the small number involved) either we should, with the knowledge of the Iranian authorities, tell them that they should reside in India ana draw their pensions there, or the money should in some wa be paid through the medium o± the Iranian authorities.

Sir, Some three months ago the receipt of a petition from an Indian woman pilgrim, wno complained that some of her personal belongings had been confiscated by the Customs, and the opportunity which I had of discussing with His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan the general question of the treatment of Indian pilgrims in this country, decided me to refer the whole matter to the Government of India. 2. 1 ' I suggested that I should be authorised to make general representations on the subject and particularly with regard to the attitude of Customs officials towards such persons, and that I should accompany these representations with a hint that excessive zeal on the part of the Customs and generally unfriendly treatment at the hands of the authorities could only in the long run tend to dry up the stream of pilgrim traffic to Meshed. At the same time I referred the above-mentioned case to tne Ministry for Foreign Affairs, though I only felt able to ask for therf intervention on general and c-&gt;^.ss *° u*te grounds, since the articles confiscated consisted of ail* and cotton cloth (both of which are subject to import monopolies) and artificial silk (of which the importation is prohibited), I neve now heard from the Government of India that, while they have decided that it would ue /inexpedient 'ftie Right Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart., G.G.8.I., etc. , etc.# etc. , The Foreign Office.inexpedient for them to proceed ir, d px oce t .a to measures in i ndia whioil might oe interpreted as calculated to restrict or prohibit the pilgrimage to leaned, they consider that action auch as I had reported on toe part of the Iranian authorities must in the long run tend to decrease the number of pllgriae. They therefore concurred in the representations which I proposed to maice* 4 * having meanwhile obtained a full report on the subject from Colonel Daly, I caused a statement to be prepared which I handed to Monsieur Soheily on October 19th.

Monsieur le alrant, Your excellency will recall tiiat during the course of cur conversation on October 19th I mention ed that 1 had ^ust received a petition fro® a British Indian subject in regard to the treatment which he Lad received at the hands of the Customs officials 7 a The man concerned, by name Mohamsdal 1 Habib, a wealthy Bombay morohant, loft India m pilgrimage with &lt; his wife, sister, brother and his wife, another sister-in-law and a servant. After finishing their pilgrimage in Iraq.., they entered Iran via Khosrovi where their luggage was examined by the Customs and where they were called upon to pay Rials fifty auty on some gramophone records and two bottle© of spirits which they had with them for medicinal purposes. 3 , Leaving Tehran for Mashed, they arrived at IMghan about 4. P*»* September 39th (Mshr 6th) last /There die excellency Sunr r i»Lt:rlor* Foreign AffaireTliei'e the Customs official® insisted ® a ™~***^im their luggage # although the^ ©xplallied tl'iat they were only passing through Iran on their way bacit to India and although they produced the voucher given them by the Customs authorities at hosrovi as receipt for duty already paid. 4 * 1'he Customs official©, in searching the luggage, insisted on eoafl seating all the embroidered silk saris, which formed part of the personal / wearing apparel of the ladle® of the party, even though they had been worn 7 / 1 several times and were in some cases actually stained* They only left ^ 1 clothe® which were actually dirty and even confiscated gome cotton handker chiefs. They further fined the party a sum of Hials 3,142 (Minis three thousand, one hundred and forty two). 5 . eventually the customs officer drew up a statement in iersian, ^hioh he called upon J.ohem edali habib to sign* fhe latter, who knew no Persian, at first refused to sign a statement which he did not understand; but ®om@ third person was then found who could speas yrenoh and who explained that it consisted of an inventory of the articles confiscated as contraband goods and of a statement to the effect /thattiiat they were the afta'e own personal property. 'tohamedal 1 Hahih replied that he could only agree to sign such a statement if he was allowed to add a remark that the articles were not contraband Merchandise hut the personal etfacts of the four ladles who were aooampanying him. Me was told, however, that he must sign the statement as it stood, without further auaitions, and when he refused to do so, that unless he signed it he would he arrested. Being entirely ignorant of the Iranian language and of Iranian law, and having four ladies with him, he then felt that he had no option tout to sign the state ment, which he did. All the ladies* saris ware accordingly confiscated and, m I have said, Mehaaedail Habib had to pay the sum of Rials 3,142 (Rials three thousand, on# hundred and forty two; as a fine# Altogether the party were detained at Daagfcftn for twenty-four hour®* 6. furthermore, during the night which the party were obliged to spend there, the Customs officer sent a policeman to guard the articles which had been confiscated. In morning Mohamedali Habib was told that he must giw# this policeman a gratuity, although the articles were no longer in /hishlB OTO P 08888810 ' in the charge of the -Jastoae. The wount paid W a 8 l.'iaigairioaat, but 'ohumedali Habib has 'Voted the occurrence to »e as a further example of the manner la which hie party were treated* As a result of the confiscation of all the ladies* saris, they were left with practically no clothes to wear and were accordingly forced to out short their journey and return straight home. X have only recently brought to- Tour aixeellenoy 1 e notice the very serious misgivings which X feel at the complaints which I receive of the treatment of British Indian pilgrims in this country* Your Excellency will therefore realise that I view the present case with grave disquiet. It must surely have been evident to the Gusto®® authorities that these saris were the personal effect® of the ladle® of the party. The sari is a form of apparel for which there is no possible sale in Best Iran and the party were, moreover, only passing through the country in transit on their way back to India# The member® of the party were all of a well-to-do Indian family and, though X understand that each of the ladies had five dresses, this esnnot be considered a» an excessive nuaber of garaents for wealthy persons proceedingon a long journey. I would draw Your excellency’s attention very seriously to the fact that the confiscation of the personal clothing of visitors from India can only produce on the latter a very unfavour ah 1&lt; •impression and that it is only natural that on their return to India the^ should relate their experiences to their friends and that a most unfortunate impression should accordingly be spread* Furthermore, foreign visitors who have already had their luggage examined at the frontier can only regard it as unreasonable and unusual when they are subjected to a further examination, involving at the least consider able delay, at a post la the interior of the country and some hundreds of miles from any frontier* 10* I Iiave already requested Your ixoslleaoy to cause a thorough examina tion to be mad© of the conditions which Indian pilgrims meet with in Iran. I would now repeat this request} and I would further asic that the present cast should be carefully investigated, that the article© confiscated should be returned to their owners and the sum paid as fin© reimbursed, and finally, that strict Instructions should be issued which will prevent such /unfortunateunfortunate incisiente taking place again in the future* I avail myaelf of this opport- unify to renew to Tour excellency the assurance of my highest eonslh•ration* fSgd) H*M# Khatchbull-Hugeseen♦No* 464» Sir, &lt; ^ &lt;' j ' r - ’ C O U 0 1 _ British Legation, l ... • Tehran • / 4 '/ M ''} i B6th October, 1955.

(3) Early in the month the Census Department at Meshed received orders from Tehran to take a census of all Berbei is in Khorassan. Shortly afterwards many Peroei in foreign subje.cts ? especially Afghan Berberis were warned to leave the country. At a meeting held on the 25th August and attended by the Governor General, the G.O.C. Troops in Meshed, the Assistant Governor General and the Chief of Police, it was decided to take steps to enforce this warning. It would appear however, that this decision was afterwards modified, as none of the Berberi subjects remaining in Meshed have so far been molested and it is generally understood that no further action will be taken. This 'volte-iace 11 is believed to have resulted from strong action oaken b;y the Afghan Government. They are said to have threatened to offer to provide land in Afghanistan for all Berberis who cared to accompany those expelled owing to their Afghan nationality (who are intermarried with and closely allied to the Iranian Berberis). This would almost certainly have resulted in emigration of the Berberis en masse and the ruin of Khoiassan agriculture.Notes. Minute Paper. Register No. P. z. 6493 / 35 . SECRET.

Private and Confidential: 1 1934 J n*' e^, BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 27th March, 1934 . My dear Metcalfe, I took the opportunity of Daly's passage through here on his way to England on leave a few days ago to discuss with him the general question on the treatment of Indians hy the Persian authorities in East Persia. have for some time past heen somewhat exercised about the number of cases which come to my notice involving the ill-treatment, administrative baiting, malicious persecution and so on of Indian British subjects. The cases occur all over Persia, but more particularly in Khorasan, Sistan and Zahedan, partly because there are so many more Indians in those provinces than in others, partly because the control of the Ministries in Tehran over the administrative \ departments, at any rate in Sistan and Zahedan, is weaker there than elsewhere. 3 # Daly took the view that the present position was largely the fault of the Indians themselves. Tnen the capitulations were first abolished he found the local officials exceedingly careful in all their proceeding for instance, they used to show their anxiety to avoid giving any cause for complain'^ hy comin to to him advice and assistance whenever an Indian was arrested rtherwise in trouble. If the Indians had taken intage of this attitude from the outset, defending is elves on the merits of their case and reporting breach of the proper procedure to the neare . might have been as ml. the Persian officials mib /-* o -fn 1careful today as they were in 1928. But unfortunately the Indians very quickly fell into the habit of bribin. their way out of any difficulties and that of course was fatal. The Persian officials lost all respect for them and opened their mouths wider and wider. Today an Indian rarely brings his difficulties to the Consul until he 1 ms oribed every official in sight without success and hopelessly compromised his case from every point of view, ihe problem is not made any simpler by the fact that the officials treat the Persians, or at any rate Persian subjects, as badly as they do Indians (the only difference being that the Indian expects some sort of justice and the Persian does not) and that the Indians of East Persia are on the whole a low and unsatisfactory lot, who often deserve everything that comes to them. 4. But Daly feels, and I fully agree with him, that whatever the deserts of the Indians, it cannot be good for our reputation that British subjects should be treated in this manner. It is, however, not easy to think of a course of action likely to improve matters. So far as individual cases are concerned we keep pegging away, but it is usually a case of hard swearing on both sides and the results are meagre: It is only when something particularly blatant, like the Charbar flogging cases, takes place, that we can extract some sort of satisfaction. 5. Daly has, however, suggested to me one means of bringing pressure to bear and that is restricting or preventing the pilgrimage to A perfectly valid excuse could be found annoyances and victimisation to which the pilgrims, are exposed, such as unduly harsh customs examinati and enquiries, troubles over their travel documentsand the Government of India formally.

Monsieur T3 Ministre, I have the honour to refer to Your Highness* note No. 6513 of May 7th last (17th Ordihehesht) and to enquire jefc whether the dossier of the case of Abdul Ghaffur Jatala has yet been considered by the competent authorities in Tehran. 2 I take this opportunity of informing Your Highness that Abdul Ghaffur { Jatala is still being molested by the pol ice authorities in Khuzistan. It appears that he has addressed to the Ministry . of the Interior&gt; in accordance with his rights under the Law of Residence of Foreigners! a telegram protesting against the treatment accorded him by the local police authorities and accusing them of asking for bribes* As a result of this telegram the local Reis-i-Nazmieh has been instructed by the Chief of Police at Tehran to investigate these charges. I am sure Your Highness will agree with me that it is ridiculous to suppose that this officer will show strict impartiality in investigating charges against himself, and I shall be grateful if orders can be issued to some genuinely impartial authority t Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Ferougfei! Minister for Foreign Ax.ua. s. His Highness-verity to examine t his ease . I have the honour to point out to Your Highness that the N a Zia ieh author ities have already taken security for two separate amounts of tomans three hundred and tomans one thousand in Abdul Ghaffur Jatala's case Hnd I now learn that as a result of his telegram to the Ministry of the Interior the Reis-i- Hazmieh sent him under escort to the house oi an Indian tailor named Abdul Kerim who was marched back to the Nazmieh and forced to sign a document giving security for a further tomans seven hundred, I have the honour to protest against the manner in which the Heis-i- Nazmieh thought fit to extract this security and to request that the sums deposited as security he returned to the guarantors. 4 0 I have the honour to add that I learn that on March 25th (5th Parvardine) Ahdul Ghaffur was forcibly taken to Bander Shahpur by the police authorities in a taxi and his quarters were there searched. Abdul Ghaffur was forced to pay tomans ten for the hire of the taxi. It appears to me absolutely unwarrantable that a man under detention should be thus obliged to pay for a journey which he was forced to make by the police and I shall be glad if arrangements can be madejuade for this sum to te reimbursed to me for transmission to Abdul Ghaffur. 5 * The whole story of the treatment ot this unfortunate man has left a painful impression upon me, which I feel sure will be shared by Your Highness when you have time to study the case. I avail myself of this opport unity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration.

But this was very unlikely and Davar had given instructions that Parsons should be allowed bail in the sum of two hundred and fifty tomans. 5. Town Bh end-Smith. In this case the dossier was much more serious and Davar considered the evidence against Town ahead* Smith was grave. A large number of persons had given evidence incriminating him, perhaps twenty in all; ana thougn he aeniea all their statements the evidence certainly seemed to allow that he had been engaged in some activity other than that of selling coal. However, Daw Had given strict instructions that the exaaination should be pushed on as expeditiously as possible. 8. Mr. Trott asked Davar what exactly were the arrangeaents which ensured that the 'instruction' should take place as quickly as possible and Mentioned that in ;&gt;gypt other countries it is often found that the exaaining sagistrat. refuse* to-3 to give a further period to the -pa^uat- to continue their invaatigallons.

Jalal h&amp;h told him that in the Soviet Union there was a rule that the investigation had to be completed in ten days; if there was such a rule it was unique. There was mm great difference between the Persian system and '.European systems In this matter j vis*, that in Persia the accused persons were not allowed t© have a lawyer to help them with their replies* This was found to be better because a lawyer often ensured that a guilty person got off! A discussion then ensued concerning the frequency with which guilty parties^- escaped punishment owing to legal flaws and unfair help from clever advocates, Davar took the view that it was more important to condemn guilty persons than to give prisoners the benefit of the doubt* He cited the opinion of certain Italian jurists to show that juries were a mistake and defeated the proper ends of justice* 7 * As for the arrests in general, Davar made a very lengthy statement* To begin with# it was unfortunate thut they had coincided with the Moscow' arrests of British engineers.

You will oo s erv e that v -'oroughi 1 a ©xpl anat ions, though couched in polite and even conciliatory language, do not really explain anything at all. 2* Previous to the receipt of this note Mr. frott had had a further interview with the Minister of Justice at which he gave His Excellency additional details of the circumstances of Mr. Parsons* detention, on the lines of the statement of which I enclose a copy. Paver admitted that there were many points which required clearing up and promised to send for Mr. parsons and confront him with Kamran, the examining magistrate. Mr. frott suggested that he too might he present, hut Daver did not seem to relish the suggestion. The latter sent for Mr. Parsons on May 28th, hut Kamran, though waiting outside, was not brought into the room while £r. rarsons was there. Baver produced the dossier and asked Mr. Far .one to .tat. wh.ther hie eignature in a certain place vae genuine or not. He aaicl that it ..as. -' nT read out the statement above it which was an order of the 8 th Section of the Parquet of the Court of -irst Instance /ordering Sfe© Right Honourable Sir John Simon, O.C.S.Ic, etc., eto., • t0, » The Foreign Office.ordei»ing Mp* Pap sou® ■to be d.et» elaed wiiile espionage against him was being examined. a r . Parsons was positiwe that no such stateaent had ewer been read out to him. Underneath this statement was the question 'Hawe you ewer been a spy or not?* and the answer 'Ho”. Mr. Parsons agreed to this. Underneath was a record of the fact that Mr. Parsons wished to sake an appeal, but the appeal itself was not attached. Mr. Parsons said tb®t four days later he had signed a document that he thought was his appeal, and Daver said that he would make enquiries. 5* Mr. Parsons then asked to fee allowed to look at the dossier and found that the date against each of the above statements or questions and answers was the 25th; Daver had always assumed this to fee the 26th Hsfand, that i® to say three days after the 22nd fcsfand (March 15th) when Mr* Parson® had been arrested, and had always maintain® that the investigation had taken place and the charge communicated three days after Mr. Parsons arrest.

In connection with Your Excellency’s complaint regarding the delay of a few days in providing the means of an interview between Mr. froit and Towashend-Smith, according to the explanation© which I have received I understand that the applioation for an Interview was not refused on principle and that if Your VxeeUency has noted that some delay has occurred in the proceedings for the accordance of this request, it has been due to tne Irrevoeable regulations of prisons, and I can assure Your Excellency that the delay was not at all due to any evil intention, i’he .uttoo.ities eonoarned hare, aoreorer, been urged ana rsoowsended to expedite their notion in respeet of future applications for an interview. a connection with Your Kxsellency’s expresslo ^ , nat an accused person has remained of surprise at the faet tna ^for 58 days in a place of cmrf* confin«i«nt without being exa.ined, f Your ixoelieacy will ohTiously adi»i i +».&lt;.♦ BJ - y Baa,it ' W»t on principle no time limit can be set to the duration of the preliminary | inre.tigatione as the Judicial officials Uabeteen-i-Adlieh) ' are normally hound to extend the preliminary iareatigatlon. so far as is neeessary for the discovery of the facts, and j [ tnere seems to be no legal ground for the eomencement of the aotual trial of the oase before these investigations have been completed. The procedure of tbe preliminary investigation, no matter to what extent it may be expedited, will vary in duration of time for its completion according to the various cases at issue, and I cannot imagine that there exists any country, no matter how far its judicial system and means for the discovery of guilt may have been perfected, whose officials can assign a time limit for the duration of preliminary investigations; and even though a judicial systm might claim that a forecast might be made of the limits of duration of time for the completion of preliminary investigation®, the circumstances and the means which might he used for the realisation of this forecast would rightly arouse suspicion and anxiety* therefore, if Your Excellency, under the circumstances, has been Informed that the investigations will be soapleted in a wee* or twelve days' time, the statement has been bassd on a conjecture which has not proved to be practicable* in connection with the inferences that Your Excellency de.ir.d to draw from the intervals in the dates of the steps taken by the police authorities in their initiation of the investigations, in the ssarshing of the of fownshead-Smith, I regret house a/id in the eventual ai . s . w ith them because the Intervals to say that X cannot agree with tn *h«t the oolios authorities were guidea in themselves prove that the f /byty caution and discretion and as far as possible did not ta*e steps to arrest an^ody before eollastisg evidence in ) support of their action. Following this method of action, if the police authorities have delayed the arrest of the ' ' accused person, there is no Plane against them as the delay was only due to the feet that they were collecting evidence which cannot he construed as creation of evidence* Therefor© I.t in the stage of prcl la inary investigations! that is to say the stage which will have to be gone through for the discovery of fact© before the formulation of the actual charge and the commencement of the trial! we suppose that the accused person has remained a few days without being cross-examined! we should not presume that the investigations have been prolonged needlessly or that the arrest of the accused ha® been legally unauthorised because the investigations do not consist exclusively of the statements of the accused but include those of other persons; the '''v, ^ llXi moment that there is no need for the confinement of the accused in proceeding with the investigations and that some other sort of security can be ta&amp;en from him! no hesitation will certainly be shown in setting him free* In respect of the other accused! Persons f Your Excellency cowplained In your note Ho. 281 ooooerning the delay In ending an answer to the (juestiens made In his case and at a subsequent date you gave an account, In your j note Ho. 239, of Kr.

Although the delay of tnreei aaye was certainly Irregular, the official in charge of the investigation delayed the definite announcement of Mr. Parsons 1 guilt (charge) presuming feat the questions that he put to Mr. Parsons m the first day of his arrest were sufficient to convey to hla the nature of the charge against him. But at any rate the official in question explicitly stated to him t hree days after his arrest what the charge against hla was and the signature existing tx of Mr. Parsons on this announcement of guilt leaves no room for any doubt. As to the interference of the examining magistrate in the presence of Mr. Trott when Parsons said that he wanted to know *what the charge against hla was’ and the magistrate is reported to have said that Mr. Parsons ’should not ask this question’# I understand that the intention of the magistrate was only to say that when the accused person meets with others he should not discuss matters which concern the investigatory dossier of nis eas ® and tiie point that 'in reply to a direct due.tioa of Mr. 1 'rott, the examining magistrate added that the charges lying againat Mr. Parsons have not been announced to hi. but that he knew them well' evidently referred to the first day of his arrest and the first sitting of his examination because as already explained the explicit announcement of the nature of the charge was made to him three days after his arrest. in conclusion I nave the honour to add that Your txcellency Ueia oet free on ball a is doubtless aware that parsons has w. * few days ago. I B connection with Your Sxcelleney s statementasthat Mr. Parsons repeated to sre the British consul, j have not so far been able to aseertain the definite date of this application, but In any case it would have been proper for him if Mr. Parsons «. did make such a request and it *»S not accepted by the subordinate officials, to make the same application in writing to the Ministry of I avail myself of this opportunity, etc*, etc. (Signed) Mohamed Ali Feroughi•u * 8j 1 hegation , P.Z.

J 9 JUL 1933 J Sir, British Legation, WLHSK. June Both 19S3. 2f M '*&gt; r/ : ;f I 'i' v ’ v\ V// The latest developments of the Toraahena-aalth'ffaae. have been reported to you briefly in a series of telegrams ending with ay telegrsa No. 138 of June 26th last, m order, however, to give a consecutive account of what has passed since Sir R.Hoare tM 1 addressed to you his despatch No. 886 of June 1st it seeas desirable to record recent developments in greater detail. 2 . At the King’s Birthday party at Gulhek the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me that he had been pondering on the matter and had come to the conclusion that the best plan would be to release Mr. Townshend-Smith on bail and give him notice to quit the country, thus avoiding the unpleasantness of a trial. His Highness said that he had so far not mentioned this idea to anybody, but perhaps we might talk it over in the near future. Accordingly, when on June 5th I paid my official call upon Feroughj on my assuming charge of His Majesty’s Legation, he again repeated to me what he had said on June 3rd adding that he had not yet breathed a word of his idea to the Minister of Justice, who was, in any case, absent from town, but that he had obtained the approval of the Shah to the course of action now proposed. His Highness was, he declared, most anxious to avoid anything which might foul the atmosphere created so successfully by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company settlement and by the Gracious Message from His Majesty The King, which hah profoundly impressed the ahah. His Imperial Majesty, said Peroughi, was now in a most mxnole mood Honourable iir J °Hn Simon S.C. 3 .I., ® tc «, etc., etc., POfiNIGN C PICK. ^ caood and we ought to do our heet to p P0 nt h y it whlle it u . %ed f “ W ° UlU ^ 8 * r * at Pity if thc ferment had to bring ' , a British auhject to trial, wore eapeciaUy as m this particular V cssft the evidence wes go ffpn vp + *. so grave that an acquittal was hardly to he looked for* 3. X answered that X entirely shared His Highness' news l about the unaesirahiity of allowing any untoward gust to ruffle I the eftl* waters in which we were now so happily sailing. He Bust, however, reuieaber that there were two public opinions concerned - the Persian, about which His Highness was so rightly solicitous, ana the British, regarding which I assuaed he was iept informed from London. Xf it becaae known in ParliaBent and the press that the Persians had first kept a British subject in gaol for two and a half months and then turned hia out at a moment notice without trial and without compensation for having lost his all, a very had impression would he created in the United Kingdom* If, moreover, this story were to he reinforced by tiue astonishing and scandalous story of the treatment of Mr* Parsons, a good deal of harm might he done to our good relations. His Highness, I continued, had assured me that the Persian Government had serious charges against Mr. Townshend~3aith, I could only take his word for it, as nobody in the Legation had seen the dossier. If, however, the charge had anything to do with Mr* Tov/nshend-Saith’s purchases of dynamite for his coal mine, I could not believe that such a charge would carry convict ion* Feroughi then most earnestly assured me that the charges were much more serious and went on to speak about Russian espionage, somewhat irrelevantly, I thought. I therefore refrains from further argument on this point hut co tented myself wi saying that I must take Feroughi * s word lor it. 1 also admit that I could see no mean© of contesting the right ox the Government to deport foreigners considered undesirable, though itit mlgtxt, I said, often entail great hardship if the right were abused. His Highness asserted the absolute necessity for such a right, which existed in most other countries! Persia was full of suspicious Russians and the Persian Government jmat have the power to expel them at need. 4. I urged the Minister to he careful, if he were determined on Mr* Townshend-Smith's expulsion, that there should he no unnecessary ground for* complaint. Com not the Persian Govern ment huy his lease oi the valuable coalmine in which he had sunk £10,000 of capital ? Ought Mr. Townshend-Smith not to he given full time to clear up his affairs and fulfil existing contract© *? Ferough! said he would reflect on this. Anyhow the first thing was to get the prisoner released on hail. m 5. On Jhne 11th I received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs a private letter, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy, announcing that Mr# Townshend-Smith would he let out on hall and given w the necessary time” to arrange his affairs and leave the country. 6. On June 16th, having still no news of Mr. fownshena- Smith ' &amp; release, I sought a further interview with Hia Highness* V) We went over more or less the same ground, my object being to impress the Minister with the importance oi really adequate delay between release and expulsion. Although X spoie quite strongly the Minister 1 s demeanour I va the Minister's deaeanour throughout was most friendly. | a Se no Affairs I was able to obtain a sdio uently, as reported in my telegrm snort prolongation, ana ran No. 130 of June 19th, a further n.c;2i^ further period of grace until June 84th. intemew. with Mr. Townshend-Smlth have convinced ne that it would be u 8e i e8B bravado on ’lis port to insist on standing his trial. The evidence against him might not in a British court lead to conviction, but it is most unlikely that a Persian court would acquit him. Partly by nature ar... partly on account of his long solitary confinement he is incoherent $ vehement and. excitable and would make the worst possible witness in his own defence, Even if acquitted, he admits that he would probably find life here intolerable thereafter. There is, therefore, everything to be gained by his departure, if only means can be devised of helping him to sell his interest in the mine at a reasonable figure. After hours of conversation with myself and other members of the Legation 1 think Mr. Townsherd- Smith realizes this and is reconciling himself to the inevitable. 8. Meanwhile it was evident that he could not possibly w arrange his affairs* (to quote Feroughi’s letter to me) without a reasonable delay# and I made up my mind to speak once more to Feroughi on this subject* I found His Highness most patient and sympathetic, lie even for the first time revealed to me details of the charge and assured me most earnestly that it would be most dan aging if a trial had to take place, although if I insisted the Persian Govemjoent would order a trial. I salu that we ere agreed that Mr. Townahend-Smith’s departure would be the heat solution, if only he could go without too deep a sense of grievance. He had today written to ae asking for three thing*. (1) Seasonable delay, as the police had .uddled up ten years' correspondence in the course of domiciliary visits: Moreover, must visit his Mine, (2) help in disposing of his mine, or ^ * Urmidat© £5.000 compensation from failing that and if forced to liqui the Persian Go vacant. (3) that his Persian 'wife', to whom a a Mohammedan he is legally married in Persian law, be alio , * H „ir two children. As regards points to go with him and take th f..'z: 33 -5 (£S) (1) ».d (3) ror..,. » 0 for aonths' ^, 7 , „ 4 , B1 . t»«t . «ontt ... UX.1, to 1,. of th , p , r , lm “*'• *■«“«•• »»» mi Her oM Ur » „«U ». ,i lo „ a to leave the country. As regards coapenaetlon the matter was more difficult. How could the Persian Qovcrnment create such a dangerous precedent when they were frequently hawing to expel Russians for much less serious offenses ? j suggested purchase of the lease of the mine hy a third party who could then sell it to the Government. The lease hed still over seventeen years to runs there was a gallery of eight hundred yards into the mountain side which represented years of labour: the coal was admittedly the hast in the district and it would he a shame to allow the mine to go to rack and ruin, especially now that / the Government were so eager to develop the coal resources in the neighbourhood of the capital# Feroughi promised to go into the matter with other departments, and I have since heard through the Head of the ^uro^-ean Section of the Ministry that this idea Is being followed up# 9. Shayesteh also telephoned to the Legation on June 26th that a six weeks 1 period of grace, as fro^ June 24th, had been arranged for Mr* Townshend* Smith and that he was at liberty to visit his mine in the mountains. The details of the departure of his family are Delng worked out with the competent department I at once communicated this news to Mr. written to me expressing his of the Ministry. Townshend-Bmith who has since grat itude. 10. X am convinced that the Persian Government are animated hy a strong desire to avoid further unpleasantness about this case. They are ashamed at the muddle over Hr. Parsons' arrest, „ «r&gt;r trvina to make amends. They do not and in their clumsy way tr 3 ri g wantwant to bring although they a British subject to trial in the courts, are showing no hesitation in trying the various Germans involved in the National Bank scanhal. I have had to speak quite plainly to Peroughi throughout this case and have even at tinea bee/n encouraged by his manner to go further than the 3,,-eugth of our position night have warranted, but he -las never at any time betrayed the slightest sign of impatience or resentment.

Hoave to Sir John Simon (No. 178.) g ir ’ I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith come, nf/T’ ^ 19 ’- 1933 - my telegram N o. 76 of to-day. I told the MiniJU r f n ° tes f 1 ^ 10116 ^ in opening the discussion of the matter that the trm r 0 r • ^ orei 8' n Affairs, when mind that he hardly appreciated my de^^^ to ^ of two British subjects in Tehran from develon?^ ^ W rison nient view of the Moscow trial public opinion in Great Britain woMdUi^ediateN roused if it were known that British subjects had remained for --- lmme ? lat ?‘y time m prison without trial and without being allowed to enjoy the protection of their consular representative; moreover, public opinion would be auTte unwilling to believe that the words “ les consuls ou leurs representants anront en se conformant aux rhglements des prisons, la permission de les visiter’’ did not bear their perfectly plain and obvious meaning 2. Feroughi intimated that he fully realised foe necessity of avoiding an incident, touched on, but without pressing, the arguments which may be adduced { a ^ Ur o 0f P ersian . thesis, and suggested that I had incorrectly understood that the Persian authorities had definitely refused to allow the prisoners to be visited. 3. In justification of my use of the word “refused” in the case of Mr. Townshend-Smith, to which Feroughi had objected in his note, I went through the time table of the case : He was interrogated by the police as long ago as the 28th February; the case must therefore have been in preparation for some considerable time and there was no justification for a protracted instruction. He was arrested on the 5th April. On the 10th April I requested that immediate arrangements be made for Mr. Trott to visit him. On the 12th April police headquarters had informed the head of the English Section of his Ministry that there would be no objection to such a visit provided a representative of the “ juge d’instruetion ” accompanied Mr. Trott, The following day, however, the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Justice informed us that under section 120 of the Police Regulations a visit could not be allowed. He explained that the parquet was authorised by that section to refuse visits to be paid to persons in prison if there was a reason to suspect that such a visit might be the occasion of a conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice. Finding we had no copy of these Prison Regulations we asked the Ministry of Justice to furnish us with one, which that department was unable to do. It suggested that we apply to the parquet or to the police. Application to both these authorities proved unavailing and it was only this morning that Jelal had undertaken to supply a copy. 4. Feroughi listened very patiently, and said that there had perhaps been delay, but he imagined I had received his message that the visit to Mr. Townshend - Smith was to be permitted on Saturday next. I said I had, but why Saturday and why not to-day, to-morrow or Friday? . ^ 5. I then turned to the Parsons case, and said that m my no e o e 5th April I had asked five perfectly simple questions which foe police could have answered in five minutes bv telephone, if they had chosen to c sa „ “disregarded,” which had'also been considered objectionable, therefore seemed to me to be fully justified. Highness did not welcome a mention 6. I then went on to say that I knew bis fiignness ^ qoo\ w of the Rashidi case (see my despatch NoU82__of e . , anv' instruction *emg that he had been in prison for over two months ^ ‘^f ‘ Shf inTeS apparently having been completed against him, h' s ca® , . ul tj- l0r ities were h the view of the Persian government was hat the judicial authority ^ authorised to refuse to allow a consul to vi . ' - ^ o: f p. e ma tter his mtruction had been completed. Apart from that aspect [803 k—4]Highness had promised as long ago as the 13th February to enquire into the 'I “nd it was only a day or two ago that Jelal informed Mr. Trott that Rashid! was’“a notoriously bad character.” If this were so, it seemed to me strange hat throughout the twenty-three years that he had frequented the Legation, none of our Persian visitors, who in the past were numerous, ever suggested either to Mr Havard or to Mr. Trott that he was an undesirable. Feroughi (whose demeanour strongly confirmed my previous belief that the only reason why the man has been imprisoned is that he came to the Legation frequently) replied that the fact that he had been imprisoned showed that the authorities viewed him with disfavour and that I should cease to interest myself m his fate. I said that a m0 re seemly method of dealing with us would have been to give a hint that it was preferable that his visits be discontinued. , . 7 I then asked his Highness whether he had read your speech m the House of Commons on the Moscow trial. He said he had not done so. I told him that I had brought a copy of the Times with me in which I had marked certain passages which I thought would adequately explain to him the \ery definite anxiety which I felt about the matter under discussion. He must clearly under stand ' that I was not suggesting that there was resemblance between the methods of the Ogpu and those of the Persian police; he would, moreover, see from the character of the passages which I had marked that this was not my intention. Feroughi said he would read it with interest. ' 8. Finally I told his Highness that I found the activities of the police were rather alarming, and in justification of that statement X gave him a, bowdlerised version of a paragraph in Mr. Palmer’s political diary for March, Section A. 9. Mr. Palmer’s actual report was as follows :— “ The town police, upon fresh orders from Tehran, are extra zealous over checking all intercourse between suspected pro-Bolsheviks and other inhabitants. “ I myself went to an Armenian house in a car to fetch some new lamp shades made for ns to my wife’s specification and urgently needed for a big party we were giving next day. ‘ £ It turned out that the good lady—the only person in the town capable of making anything reasonably decorative—had a husband, working away in Tehran, who was suspected of Bolshevik sympathies. “ I learnt later that after my visit she had been subjected to a long cross- examination by the police commissary of the quarter, who refused to believe that—as the matter was urgent—I had merely literally obeyed my wife’s orders ‘ not to leave without the shades.’ One was not ready and I waited about an hour while the lady and her two little sisters aged about 8 or 9 finished it. The commissary wanted all details of the conversation! ” 10. I added that this meant that it was apparently a part of the normal duties of the police to watch the comings and goings of a British consular officer, to note what houses he visited and how long he stayed in them, and then to go and interrogate the occupants of the house. As was to be expected, Feroughi gave the Russian hare a run, saying that, while no doubt British consuls were all honourable men,” other official representatives could not be so described. It was perhaps well that the police should keep a watch on the doings of all indiscriminately; they would then gradually learn to divide the sheep and the goats, and so far as we were concerned matters would certainly gradually return o normal. And when all was said and done it was not often that British S* i!?? 8 Were arreste d- I terminated this part of my conversation by replying that there were not many British subjects in Persia. a* + ^ X&gt; en . era l impression was that to some extent Feroughi was genuinely distressed at the failure to deal more promptly with the two cases under discussion K l n a 1 - t le l imdou 1 bted con cern which he showed was mainly inspired iLvl ™ eSlre *5 n0t l ln ? ® hou ' d be done to spoil the “ atmosphere ” (a word of Tre to te conducted 8 } “ WhlCh the An g lo -Persian Oil Company negotiations I have, &amp;c.

Secretary of State... • Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. SEEN 'OLITiCAL COMMITTER* 22 JUN 193,r* Please see the previous submission on P.Z.2859/33. The seriousness of these cases lies not so much in that British subjects have been arrested on suspicion of espionage as in that they have been kept in prison for long periods without trial. Mr .Parsons was arrested on 13th i.iarch and hr.Townshend- Smith on 5th April. Mr .Parsons was not even informed of the charges a^iinst him although Persian Law lays down that persons arrested on a criminal charge must be informed of the Previous Papers charge within 24- hours. Sir R.Hoare draws attention to the fact that the practice of imprisoning persons for indefinite period? without/without trial is increasing and suggests that we may have serious trouble over the treatment of Indians unless a strong line is now taken. Papers regarding the treatment of Indians in Khuzistan have already been submitted (P ,2,2810/33.) The British Minister’s note of 5th fey to the Persian Government (P ,2.3184/33) gives a very good review of the cases of Mr .Parsons and fe.Smith up to that date and the telegrams at P.Z. 3185/33 show the progress of events since then. The latest telegram on the file of 15th May indicates that Sir R.Hoare has at last succeeded in making some impression on Persian dilatoriness. The Minister of Justice now finds that the charges against Mr.Parsons are rather flimsy and proposes after more than two months imprisonment to release him on bail! He also promises to speed up the disposal of fe.Smith’s case. I understand that in the case of the latter there are unpleasant features and it is quite possible, that, the Persians may have discovered something compromising. / «f cu* €^CCcru*Jt u**- PC SEEN -PCAL CGMM1 22 JUN \*S 'GL,In any further communication on this subject, please quote No - E 2?IU \l(oa^Uiv and address —not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. 3350 THE Under-Secretary of Sta te &lt;o\ 9^,, A j airs presentg hj8 compliments to ^ ^ Udt V and, by direction of the Secretary of State transmits herewith cop^ of the under-mentioned paper.

At my request the Minister of Justice, Mirsa Ali Akfeer Khan Davar, was present and I took Mr. Mallet with me. 3. Femughi started by reading the Persian version of my note to his colleague in a rather shamefaced manner. Davar at once seised upoa the point referred to in paragraph 7 of ay note in which I complained that a breach of section 10 of the law supplementary to the ItondaMntal Law of 14th Z1 Qa'dah, 1384, had occurred, in that Mr. Parsons had not been apprised within twenty four hours of his arrsst of ths charges to be brought against hia. If It was indeed true, a serious irregularity had occurred. His Excellency endeavoured to exoute himself for the delays of which X proceeded to complain by saying how busy he had been over the Anglo- ersian Oil Company concession, but undertook immediately to look into the whole case most carefully. I then took the opportunity of drawing attention to article. 123 and 184 of the penal prcccdnrc, chick r * ad ** Bight Honourifc le Sir John Simon 9 GcOcS.I** etc., etc*, etc*# fhe Foreign Offloe, l^ondon.

Should the latter refuse to do so or In case he is absent, or should, he have plausible excuse for delaying arraignment, the public prosecutor will call upon the President of the Court of the First Instance or one of the members thereof to be chosen by himself, to arraign the accused. Article 134 . - If the accused who has been sumionei^or arrested should remain in custody more than 24 hours without being arraigned by the Examining Magistrate and if, as stated in the foregoing Article, no action is taken for the arraignment of the accused after he has appeared before the Public Prosecutor f mieh confinement will be considered as hating been effected illegally, in which case the guilty guard shall be dismissed from service.

He defended hiaself by saying that in all countries suspected persons had to be kept under arrest until their case had been thoroughly investigated and that the investigations might unfortunately take a considerable time. Only in Russia, so far as His Excellency knew, was it possible for the police to lay down a definite period In which the evidence against a prisoner must be prepared, - and that for obvious reasons. 5 . i then reverted to the refusal of the police to supply the Minister for Foreign Affairs with the answers to my five questions contained in ? s v note of April 6 th last (eaelawir. Ho. 2 in «y despatch Ho. 169 of April 7th). I ini* special stress upon the fact that no answer had been giren to ay question, repeated at frequent internals, as to whether Hr. i arsons had expressed a desire to see Bis Majesty'» Consul.

SUBJECT. 5 041 2000 1.31 P&amp;rsia, Anti- foreign atmosphere prevailing in Persia. FOR INFORMATION. % This is an interesting despatch. According to the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the vexations and restrictions which foreigners have to suffer aree not in the least inspired by anti- British or anti-foreign feeling. They are rather the inevitable product of exceptional but temporary circumstances and of the misdeeds of the Soviet Embassy. There is now no doubt that the Persian Government are seriously alarmed at the activities of the Soviet but this handy and well-worn excuse does not explain a ,r ay everything - for example Persian interference with the flying of national flags, a * matter which has recently been raised again. The/The situation has certainly not improved since Sir K.Hoare’s despatch of 24th March and a reference is invited to his later despatches submitted below regarding the treatment of British Indians in Khuzistan (P.Z.2810/33). Papers regarding the arrest o Rashidi referred to in para.2 are at P.Z.2526/33. These cases in conjunction with the arrests of Mr .Parsons and Mr .Townshend-Smith, who are both accused, apparently on very inadequate evidence, of espionage, certainly seem to support Sir R. Hoare’s suspicion that the Shah is definitely ^uneasy about the internal situation. 1 1 With regard to Teymourtache itjis i difficult to believe that there is much truth in the allegations made against him of betraying his country to the Soviet. It is much more probable that he genuinely tried to establish good relations with the U.S.S.R., that he blundered badly in making the Commercial Treaty with them, and that he then became the leader of the dissatis faction of the trading community against the unscrupulousness of Soviet trading methods when he became aware of the mistake he had made. It is possible, however, that he tried to be too clever and he may to some extent ^like iThemistocles^ t - have played a double game. are Papers regarding Mr .Parsons and Mr.SmithINDEXED In any further communication on tWsubject^lease quote *&lt;&gt;■£ 'Ov- and address —not to any person by naml, but to ‘The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W 1 THE Under-Secretary of State for’EMgS,' *J- compliments to ^ his 1 . and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop ^ of the under-mentioned paper Foreign Office, SV* . 1933..

Sir ’ T n ATT-p-n ■*-'u tv/t* ^ T, • T ehran, March 24, 1933. I CALLED on the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 9 th March in order to hand him the note, copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 94 protestino- against the manner in which a police raid on the house of a British subject had been conducted. I did not invite his Highness to discuss the case with me forth with, but desired him to study my note with all the attention which it certainly merited. 2. I then reverted to the Rashidi case, on which I reported in my despatch No 82 of the 25th February, and enquired whether his Highness had obtained any information from the police as he had promised to do. He replied that the information for which he had asked had not yet been furnished. I begged him to press the matter, and I renewed the complaints which I had previously made against the boycott of the Legations and foreign houses generally which had been imposed, and against the restrictions on the free circulation of our cars outside the town unless we were actually in them. We were pestered by stupid and interfering circulars, such as that of last year on the subject of the flying of our national flags, and recently by one inviting us to use some new designation for &lt;£ ghulams.” There seemed,' in fact, to be an intention to make our lives unpleasant; I saw no sense or reason in all this and I resented it. 3 Feroughi replied that he had already explained to me that the activities of the Soviet Embassy rendered necessary an attempt to supervise the movements of the cars owned by members of the Diplomatic Corps, and that as regards other matters I was being hypersensitive and appeared to regard any initiative y e Persian Government as unwarrantable interference. 1 sh ° ul 1 &lt;1 , l ; ea1 '*®L he wrone- if I chose to try and understand the situation.

[775 1—6]that might appear to be vexatious was not in the least inspired by anti-British or anti-foreign feeling, but was the inevitable product of the times, which were exceptional aid needed exceptional measures These last words he repeated again and again. The misdeeds of the Soviet Embassy were mainly responsible for the measures of which I complained, and it was because of the boviet Embassy that certain people were viewed with disapproval by the P°|' ce they frequented foreigners, but it was quite a mistake if people of good character thought tha. this applied to them. After all, “ yon British would be the first to complain if communism got a hold and disorders followed, and so—with tne usual plea of administrative inexperience—I must believe that mistakes were not made on purpose, and I must be tolerant because the Ministry always tried to get them rectified. 8 . Mr. Baggallay made every effort to establish the fact to Jelahs conviction that I have had solid grounds for complaint. Jelal is honest-minded and undoubtedly well-disposed, and so I hope that, within the limits set by Jelal’s senility, Mr. Baggaliay was successful. . . . 1 • 9 . Jelal has thus categorically confirmed my suspicion that there has been something beneath the surface, of which the general public is ignorant. The chief of police, whose views I summarised in my telegram No. 57 of the 19th March, •appears to believe—and certainly wishes us to do so—that Teymourtache has been disloyal, but according to him this disloyalty was only discovered after the Shah had decided to bring Teymourtache to trial for financial dishonesty. I have studied Mr. Brenan’s record of his conversation with General Ayrom (copy enclosed), and compared it with confidences which he has previously made to members of this Legation. In September last he was complaining that his efforts to deal effectively with the communistic menace were in a great measure thwarted by the attitude of Teymourtache and Feroughi. On another occasion he told us that he had attended a conference (with Teymourtache, Feroughi and Daver) to discuss measures against communism. But now he suggests that it was Teymourtache alone who prevented the adoption of effective measures, and that since his arrest definite information had come to light of his “close political contact with the Soviet Ambassador.” Again, General Ayrom now declares that Teymourtache induced Feroughi to sign “the completely one-sided” commercial treaty with the Soviet Government, by means of the false statement that the Shah had issued express orders for its signature. What we believed at the time of signature was that the Council of Ministers had considerable qualms and wished to defer signature until Teymourtache returned from Europe, so that he might have his full share of responsibility. It is absurd to ask us to believe now that Teymourtache telegraphed from Europe that the Shah wished the treaty to be signed. Lastly, it is an undeniable fact that it was Teymourtache who organised and vocalised the dissatisfaction of the trading community with the manner in which the Soviet Government had implemented the treaty. , 10 . The charge of treason is at least still to be proved, but it has probably been thought convenient that the world should believe that such a charge would 1 ^' , i i 1 *' £, rott nas ^ ia PP en ed to meet Shari'at-zadeh, the lawyer originally se ected by Teymourtache to defend him. He said, without giving any further explanation, that he was obliged to resign the task and then went on to state that e w 0 ® lia l was a farce from beginning to end, the evidence, such as it was, manu ac me and the result according to orders. The extreme rapidity of the proceedings, the fact that the trial was held in camera, and the brevity and lle . 1 ^P ort (translation enclosed( ] )) all support this view, 11 0 P mion . wl P happier, if it believes that he was a traitor.

AFTER concluding the business on which I had asked for an appointment WiJKT&amp;KSE “ * e ”“ &gt;«t &lt;c St ^ rte ^ saying that he hated his job, which he characterised as unclean and extremely difficult and unpleasant. Evei since he had been chief of police he had always experienced an element of opposition m a certain quarter, and that quarter was Teymourtache. Whenever a question arose concerning Russian activities, whether political, economic, or purely concerning police, he found that Teymourtache would endeavour to interfere and prevent the adoption of any steps contrary to the interests of the Russian elements therein. He (Ayrom), when he first came to the post of police chief, had had very definite orders from His Majesty to watch carefully Bolshevik propaganda and to report direct to him on all matters pertaining thereto. He consequently found it difficult to reconcile Teymourtache’s attitude and behaviour with His Majesty’s orders. He, in the course of time, had grave suspicions that, for some reason or other which he still could not understand, Teymourtache was playing the Russian game. He was certain of it at the time of the signature of the Russian Trade Agreement, which, he said, Feroughi had objected to sign, and which he only signed when Teymourtache informed Feroughi that the Shah had issued express orders for the signature. When I ventured that surely it was within the possibility of Feroughi to convey his reluctance to His Majesty, Ayrom leant towards me and said : He could not.” , , Since Teymourtache’s arrest the Shah has been told and has understood tne complete one-sidedness of that trade agreement, and in a recent interview wit t ,e Council of Ministers he asked why the devil the trade agreement was signea it they (the Ministers) were at the time so opposed to it. He was told ttiat it was “ by your orders.” He exploded, and said it was nothing of the sort and hejras extremely angry. It then came out that 1 eymourtache ha ahen i 3 . name invaim His Majesty then ordered that things were to he put n 0 ht, a they were to sit down and find a way to put things light. , • f i ; e To-day he had summoned Petrovsky to an interview and the chief of police smiled and said he thought it might be stormy. ® .

I said we all were interested, naturally. He replied: Yes, but theie aie different kinds o^ interest.” Einhorn had on several occasions tried to get information out of him about Teymourtache. . tit -p t He (Ayrom) referred to Aghabekoff’s memoirs, and asked me if 1 remembered the passage about Khostaria having paid Teymourtache 50,000 tomans. Once Ayrom, thinking of this passage, had asked Teymourtache whether he thought Aghabekoff’s stories were true. Teymourtache shrugged his shoulders and said he thought the man was only an adventurer and that a^liis stories were lies. Ayrom said: ££ Oh, surely not all; perhaps embroidered ; but Teymourtache then said: ££ Oh, when 1 was once in Meshed the British military attache— [Ayrom forgot the name, so I suggested Thompson, and he said : ££ Yes! Yes! Thompson ”]—told me that all Aghabekoff’s stories were imagination, or words to that effect.” My impressions were that Ayrom, whom I have known well in the past, was not talking for effect. His manner is frank. He showed that he had, at any rate since he occupied his present post, mistrusted Teymourtache, and he is convinced that Teymourtache was a maleficent influence on the Shah and did great harm to Persia, but why he cannot yet understand.

I went there in ay car with the Mir Akhur, arriving just after 10 a.a. A number of policemen were waiting at the gate and I was evidently ejected. I was conducted to a room in which I was given a chair. A greasy-looking man named Ursa Agha Khan Kaiaran introduced himself as the M iaustajitiq n (interrogator - ’*juge d f instruction”) of the fa f aln4t; and he produced an interpreter named Mirsss Ahiaad Khan Sharifi - a young man educated at the American College. Kamman started off by saying that although the ^instruction* of Torashend- Smith was not entirely finished, there was no objection to ay seeing him. He hoped to get the * instruction* finished by the end of this week; it was practically at an end. He asked that I should be careful not to say anything % to Townshend-Smith about the matters of which he was accused. X could ask him about how he felt, about how he passed his time, how he was treated in the prison, how he liked his food, etcetera* I said that before X ©aw Townshend-Smith I wanted to say two things: (1$ About his wife. Gould it be arranged that his *ife should see him? Kamran said that it might be arranged and he would do what he could, fhe %ile, in his view, 'mast” (a word usually translated ’drunk’, but not invariably; perhaps ’dotty*, Unbalanced* or something similar *n&amp; -• he meant)* I said that if he had had his wii© taken put into prison suddenly it might make Jl4.ll a and as a matter of fact the night before last the wo,mi had taken a large dose of opium with the idee ox killing luckily•2 luckily she did not succeed. X rubhed in this point and Kaisran acknowledged that the woman had a right to ho anxious and he promised to do what he could to arrange a meeting. (2) About Townshend-Smith* s business. X mentioned the complaints that we had received that Townshend-Smlth* s business was being interfered with. Ka^ran said that they had gone into that and it was not true. Mo interference had taken place. And Moreover, if the prisoner’s business did suffer, the Persian aove*nment was responsible* if it would be proved that such interference had taken place, the Government which curing the time of imprisonment was responsible for losses suffered, would have to pay compensation* 1 then asked whether Xdwnehend-Smith could be authorised to see Haji (Townshend- Smith’s munshi). Kamran said that there was no objection. If I would tell haji to come to see him at Ho. 4 Section of the Ta’minat, he would arrange to bring up haji with him the next time he came up to the prison, in order that Townshend- Smith could see him and make all the dispositions necessary about the conduct of his business. I was then conducted to a window of the same room, which had no glass but had vertical iron bars; it gave on to the interior courtyard of the prison. 'lown&amp;hend-Smith was, so to speak ’discovered’ sitting on the other side of the bars, with a policeman standing by his side. He grinned and shook hands through the bars. He looked rather grimy, but was quite cheerful. I asked him how he was and he said he was very well, and was having a jolly good rest cure doing nothing. The only thing was he did not get enough exercise. Gould he have permission to walk about more? Kamran immediately said that he would Arrange that* And as for Hood, the only complaint he had was that he got too much. That silly woman, his wife, wouldI m in i'nil ^ ad ^ tiii would keep sending up cooked fowls, which he could not eat; he gave a lot of his food away* Perhaps I could tell his wife not to send so much meat, hut to send more fruit. I agreed to do this. He repeated that he had no complaints to make as to treatment, and evidently meant it. Ksaran and he talked to one another rather as if they were old friends. One other matter was worrying him. Certain hills or drafts, payable by a certain Jones (presumably the Manager of the British tannery) were due to be presented very soon and Townshena-Smith was afraid that if they were not presented payment woula be refused. Kamran promised to arrange this when he brought up Hajl to see him. He also asked for a towel. I am telling Haji to take cne, I told Townsnend-Bmith that Mr. Wilkinson of the Imperial Bank of Persia had promised to provide Ha^i with certain money to go on with in order that the business might be carried on. g#* 3 Lui about half an hour's talk X shook hands again through the bar© and left. The head of the prison didhot appear; I was told that he was ill; but Mi assistant, a civil looking officer, was present, accompanied by a very woe-begone person who was introduced as the prison doctor. jelal also told me this morning that he had procured a copy of section 120 of the prison regulations and was sending it to us.

It is noticed that since Lieutenant-Colonel Kirs© Ali Khan Qane’ has assumed charge of the Post of Pais- Mfasmiyeh in October 1930, insecurity in the town has been on the increase and is attributed to hie incompetence and unpopularity. The burglars are said to be working in conjunct ion with the poliee-aen on night duty. The local people have made complaints to the Governor-General on account of the prevailing insecurity. Foreign Residents are Mtterly complaining against the action of the police in connection with the ahnornal delays in having their residence permits (Jawaz) renewed and various other restrict ionsunneeessarily imposed to hamper their movements to various parts of Khuzistan. .- •— - INC _ In any further communication on this ^abject, please miote No. £ I'KU (6-n~/ lu; and address —not to any person b} name, but to-f- “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. r / v i | i THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign presents his compliments to obabe ror foreign Aq^sO^resents his and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop uu^ of the under-mentioned paper. 3 I Foreign Office, % s £ , P) lieference to previous correspondence : Description of Enclosure.

This note, as you will have seen, states 2 the offences of which Mr. Towashend-Smith is suspected, that is, espionage and the smuggling of gold out of the country, and gives full particulars of the codes and enactments under which these charges would he framed. To this extent the note is satisfactory. 5. Even more satisfactory - in view of the tendency shown of late by members of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in conversation with my colleagues (though not so far with anyone in this Legation) to regard the 'Safeguards* as a transitional measure which the perfection of the Persian judicial system has now rendered obsolete -* is the very definite reference to the 'Safeguards* in the note, even though they are described as the 'circular* of May, 1926, and not as a note to this Legation. The question whether or not the Detective 4 police really did apply to the public prosecutor for a warrant before searching the house is one upon wich son® doubt is permissible, but as it may be taken for granted that they would have had not the slightest difficulty in /obtaining 7he Right Honourable Sir John Simon, 0.C.S.I., etc., etc.. The Foreign Office etc.,- 2 - obtaining a warrant if tney had applied, the point is not of practical importance when compared to the admission of the principle. I think there is little doubt that although a preliminary search may have been made of the house while Mr. Townshend-Smith was still there, the real search, as well as the seizure of his papers, took place after he had been removed to the police station. I had intended to ask Mr. Townshend-Smith to make an affidavit as to the circumstances of the visit, but the news has just reached me that he has been placed under arrest in the Detective police prison. I have accordingly sent the Minister for Foreign Affairs the reply of which 1 enclose a copy, reserving my right to advert to this and other aspects of the case at a later date. 6 # I am not disposed to press the question of the additional visits paid to Mr. Townshend-Smith’s house in his absence on subsequent days, as his Persian mistress behaved rather foolishly on these occasions, producing identity papers that really belonged to her sister and answering incorrectly one or two questions, not, it is true, of Material importance. It is worth recording, however, that on one of these occasions she was asked whether Russians ever visited the house or whether her 'husband** had any dealings with the late treasurer of the Court, Diba (see my despatch So. 102 of 11th March, 1933). The answer in each case was 'Yes, foi in- purchase of coal'. «r. Townshend-Smith, I may explain, is the owner of a coal-mine in the neighbourhood of Tehran and conducts all his own sales in person. The arrest of Mr. Townshend-Smith follows motor-driver who has been /out on that of a Mr* Parsons,out here since the war and was only recently dismissed from the service of Hussein Qali Khan Hizaa-Qeragozlo (Amir Nizam) one of the Shah’s Masters of Ceremonies. Mr. parsons was placed under arrest about three weeks ago and though I have as yet received no official information I learn from the Chief of Police that in his case also the charge is espionage. Several others, lussians. Persians and Armenians are, I believe, detained on similar charges* I enclose a copy of a note that I have addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affaire about Mr. Parsons. 8 * I have not as yet formed any clear idea of the beat way in which to help Mr. Townshend-smith or Mr. Parsons. One is naturally inclined, especially with recent happenings in the Soviet Union in mind, to forget that the capitulations have passedgway and to regard it as inadmissible that the Persian authorities should arrest or Imprison any British subject. Moreover, when the facts become known, I fear that those elements in the country which are not abreast of modern thought on this subject may regard them as a further sign of our inability to protect our nationals - unless, indeed, they assume that this, like everything else, is done ’with &gt; our permission”. The case derives further importance from the fact thatT for a British motor-driver named Martin, who killed a Kurdish boy with his lorry and was kept for about a month in the police detention qo&amp;rtexs at Kermanshah while the public prosecutor (who eventually decided not to prosecute) was considering the matter, Townshend-dmith and Mr. Parsons are, I believe, the first European British subjects to be placed under arrest by the I Persian authorities. ' 9 , A t present I incline to the opinion that the most prudent course, end the one best calculated to /help— 4 - 1 _ help the men under arreet, will be to limit ay repreeentatiom to ineietlng that all expedition ahall be used to complete the enquiries, so that they may be either released or brought to trial at an early date, and to insist that the trial, if not hela in public, shall be attended by a representative of the legation, who shall have full liberty to inspect any documentary evidence that may be produced. 1 aay add that there is some reason to think that the police are suspicious of certain other British subjects who are engaged here in business on their own account* ll• The Persian Government seem at the moment to be almost as hysterical on the subject of espionage as the Soviet Government• Among other examples I may quote the fact that two young officers from India, one an Aide de camp to the Viceroy and one an Aide de camp to the Commander-in-Chief, who are here on a shooting trip, were followed from &amp;ahedan to Meshed by a police detective, while Sir Aurel Stein, who in connection with his work, which he explained in detail to all the higher Authorities last spring, wished to visit certain spots rather off the beaten track in southern Persia, has had so many difficulties placed In his way that he has for the present abandoned the idea and returned to India* I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) R* H.

Mr. Hoare to bir John Simon.—{Received March 14A (No. 82.) ' Slr ’t o™-n^ rrrv t ■ . Tehran, February 25, 1933. I REFOE I ED at some length in my despatch No. 55a of the 11th February on the restrictions which are being placed with increasing stringency on the acceptance by Persians of foreign hospitality. Since then a certain Habibulla Rashidi, who for over twenty years has called at frequent intervals to give the oriental secretary of the day “ the talk of the town,” has been arrested. About three weeks previously Mr. Trott had asked him whether he would not be wise to keep away from the Legation for a short time, but he pooh-poohed the suggestion, saying that there was not the slightest danger and the police knew all about him’ The chief of police, when questioned by Mr. Trott, made no pretence that there was any charge against him, and declared that he would be released at once if I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he was in the employ of the Legation. He was himself in no way responsible as the arrest was ordered by the “ police de Surete,” which was not under his control. 2. I have told the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said that he had no knowledge of the affair, that he knew as well as I did that in the past a consider able Intelligence Service was run by this Legation, directed against Russian activities in the days of Persia's weakness. He also knew perfectly well that, the times having changed, our organisation ceased to exist. If the man were a spy I should be debarred by common usage from interesting myself in his case, but spies did not come in by the front gate of a Legation in broad daylight. After some demur Feroughi promised to look into the case. 3. It seemed a good opportunity to reiterate my displeasure on the subject of the treatment to which the foreign Legations are being subjected, and I introduced my complaint by telling him that one of our consuls had just asked me whether it would be possible to transfer him. His reason was that the Persian friends he had made had recently been ordered to have nothing to do with him. Having little actual office work to occupy his time, he felt he was wasting it if he was debarred from getting to know something about the country in which he was posted by cultivating the society of its inhabitants. 4. Feroughi urged patience, saying it was a passing phase; he added, however, that in the past Persians who frequented the Legations, especially the British and Russian, were regarded by the patriotically minded rather as hirelings and despised accordingly : foreign diplomats had not always exeicised due care in selecting their Persian friends. I replied that I might shoitly line myself asking him for a list of 'respectabilities” with whom I could, W R; safety to them and to my own reputation, enjoy social relations Teroug i | repeated that patience, and especially the settlement of the Ang o- ersian 1 I Company controversy, would restore a normal situation. ,, 5.

The opportunity has also been taken by the Nazmieh authorities to tighten up the regulations regarding residence and movements of foreigners, and every effort is being made by all concerned to make life unendurable and to persuade them to leave the country.

Mr, Townehend-Smith then asked for his authority to enter his house and was shown a small metal disc attached to the police agent's belt, He was then informed that he was accused of sending gold out of Persia and that his presence was required at police headquarters whither he was then escorteC There he was detained until 9 p.m. when four of the police agents, who ho a MiMfSaed All Khan Feroughi, Foreign Affairs#remained at his house, arrived bringing with the® a large pillow-slip which proved to he full of Mr. TownBhend-8mith , private and business papers; hi© old army revolver and cartridges had also been removed. He was then handed a slip of paper on which was written in English; *someone has tola us that you have been purchasing gold and ©hipping it out of Persia, therefor© you have been brought here”. After sealing the pillow-slip, as ordered by the police, Mr. Townshend-Smith was allowed to leave and was instructed to return the next day at 9 a. a* then he reached his house he found that it had been systematically searched. 5 # When he returned the next morning the seal was broken and the papers In the pillow-slip were exeulned till 7.30 p.».. two of a purely private nature feeing retained# He was eventually allowed to leave at 8 p.o. feut ordered to present fei.self the next morning* ^ fnen he arrived home Mr. Townohand-Salth found that a party of three detectives had been there and searched the cellars, again witnout producing any warrant# 6&gt; on the following day ar.

Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 27.) (No. 55a.) Tehran, February 11, 1933. IN a recent despatch I had the honour to report the issue of instructions by the Shah forbidding Persians to frequent foreign Legations. The fact that officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs denied the story is, of course, of no importance whatever; their denial was only half-hearted, and since my last despatch on the subject I have received overwhelming confirmation from many sources that such an order was given. The following facts give the first direct instance which has come to my notice of a definite punishment meted out to a Persian who ventured to transgress the Royal command :— 2. On the 14th January Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh, a pensioned official of the Ministry of the Interior, called at his own request on Mr. Trott. He is a nephew of the present Prime Minister and a son of the late Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh, K.C.I.E.; his family have been for many years on terms of close friendship with members of this Legation. The present Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh is rather an insignificant individual: a passion for opium and the reputation of being of limited intelli gence, combined with accusations of irregularities when he was Governor of Sultanabad some five years ago, have resulted in his being unemployed for some time; and being aged nearly 60 he has been drawing his pension of 160 tomans per month in Tehran without really expecting ever to get another appointment. 3. The gist of his conversation was to the effect that the Persian Government had made a grave error in cancelling the D’Arcy Concession. He gave ceitain details which I had not heard before—-including a story that 500 troops weie sent off to the south on the day that the cancellation of the concession was announced, with orders to take over the oil-fields, but that directly the fust Bims rep ^ w as received orders were issued instructing the commander of the troops that they were to protect the oil-fields instead of seizing them. He stated his opinion that Teymourtache could easily have put through a subservient Majlis the agreement which he came to with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company m Lon on a le g &amp; of 1932, and that he ought to have done so. In fact, he laid all ^ blame ior present unfortunate state of affairs with the former Mims ei o hScl he that he could have prevented the Shah from cancelling the concession, hac W1Sh 4 d Whatever the truth of his stories or the value, ^^ig^^Mr 11 Ti^tt immediate point I wish to make is that a fortmg i a ^ ' been severely received a message from Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh saymg ^ ^ ; 0 ,i rn p SS sai( ] that the reproved by his uncle for visiting the British Legation, is &amp; ^ Mukhbir- Shah was furious that his wishes had been disregarded a^ ed-Dowleh would have to go off at once to the post of Go™ himseH by saving a salary of 90 tomans a month. Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh that he had been friendly with the British Lega 1C * ’ , ; he had no idea that many years; and as an official on pension, wi no er p . ^ ^ going to there Lid be any objection to hr y^Ung hxs f nends^ Ancl tterdea^ Damghan m winter, the salary of the P - , Led strongly to such treat- pension, was clearly a direct punishment, , / , assuage the Royal wrath ment. The Prime Minister no doubt tried his be t to assuage tne and evidently succeeded in making .t j' 1 ,';, ,. 0 f Painghan and Semnan on Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh, for he was emoSents of the two posts the 8th January and left for his post on that date, the emon being about the same as his previous peiision. Persians who consider 5. Mukhbir-ed-Dowleh thus joins the ^lect body^ ^ Qf Muham _ themselves sacrificed for friendship wi ^ 1 T h who . for one reason or merah, there are a number of Pei sums now [719 dd—3]2 another attribute their fall to their friendship with members of this Legation or to their too ardent expressions of pro-British sympathies. . 6 i mentioned this boveott of foreigners to the Minister for Foreign Affairs a day or two ago. His Highness was recovering from influenza, and as the result of his indisposition, or perhaps of the fact that the Council of Ministers now meets three times a week in tte presence of the Shah, was more spiritless than usual He of course denied that anv order had been issued, on the same principle that he declared that the celebrations in connexion with the cancellation of the IT \rcy Concession were not “ by order.” (Presumably, if anybody were indiscreet enough to ask why Tevmourtache is confined to his house under strict police super vision he would be told that no order had been given for his arrest.) I told Feroimhi that it was a matter of fact that Persians who for years had been on terms of social intimacy with foreigners were now displaying embarrassment if invited and there was not a shadow of doubt that they were not acting on their own initiative. I could think of no explanation unless it was an indication of serious political unrest, of the existence of which I was unaware. If it existed it was my duty to enquire and report to my Government. Feroughi was greatly embarrassed, and said that it had been noticed that certain individuals who appeared to have no special reason for visiting foreign houses were frequently seen in them and it was wondered what they were doing there. I replied that I did not, of course, know to whom he was referring, but I imagined that they were seen in houses where their presence was a source of pleasure. To object to their visiting the house of a foreign representative was not far short of a suggestion that the foreign representative was plotting with them. Feroughi had really nothing to say, and even failed to suggest that these precautions were aimed against the Soviet Embassy. 7. I imagine that the explanation of the Shah's action is that he is aware of the volume of criticism which the cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession pro voked, and that he fears lest his subjects hear uncomplimentary talk in foreign drawing-rooms. He may also have a suspicion that in Western eyes his treatment of Teymourtache looks ugly, and that we may be saying so. But it is not altogether a sudden development, as I remember that the Polish Minister told me not long before he went on leave in the middle of December that the Persians with whom he used frequently to play bridge at the Iran Club were displaying an increasing reluctance to be at his table. 8. With regard to the Iran Club, which was, under the presidency of Teymourtache, the great point of contact between Persian and foreign society, I understand that the Shah has been consulted and has expressed the wish that its days shall be prolonged and, indeed, that the Sunday afternoon thes dansants, which lapsed with the eclipse of Teymourtache, shall be revived. His Majesty has so far unbent as to say that the finances of the club should be strengthened by conferring on the club a monopoly for the importation of playing cards. 9. The atmosphere in which we are living to-day is rather suggestive of the mad-house (or at least of Mr. Waugh’s Black Mischief), but perhaps it will improve when the Shah and the rest of us have become accustomed to the elimina tion of Teymourtache, who was from every aspect, good or bad, the central factor in our corporate life.

On the other hand, the case (thanks to the character of the prisoner) isnot perhaps a strong one and in any event, as the foreign Office suggest, would not afford a very good peg on which to rang inspired press comment. There seems some little hope that a private arrangement may be possible and m an the circumstances we may I think rest content With the course taken in the Foreign Office despatch, hr.

It will be seen that a copy of Mr. Hoare’s despatch No. 43 has been sent by him to the Government of India. 2. The case has been considered carefully by this department and Sir John Simon trusts that Sir Samuel Hoare will agree with the terms of the enclosed copy of a despatch which has now been addressed to His Majesty’s Minister.

Sir, I have the honour to inforai you that on or about August 38th last, a railway collision occurred near Ahwaz, as the result of which the engine-driver, by name Moses Joseph Rohekar, an Indian British subject, was taken into custody* Details of this accident,and of Moses Joseph’s arrest, are contained in the despatch from —™— His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwas of which I enclose a copy. It will be seen that there were no casualties. 3. Moses Joseph first brought his case to the notice of Hie Majesty’s Consul at Tehran, through his wife, on November 8th, and after telegraphic enquiries had been made as to his identity and nationality of His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwas, I sent a note to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs asking him to make enquiries and ascertain under what regulation the prisoner had been detained fox so long without trial. I added that X was informed tost he had been prevented from eomwinicatlng with His Majesty's Legation and ashed that he should be allowed to do so in future. X sent reminders on December 7th and December 21st, and on Twruuxx^ 21st wrote again embodying some of the additional information eontaineu xn tut /dnMz despatch, which I had by then received. An intermediate reply, stating that the case had been referred to the competent authorities, arrived on January 89th. /February Might Honourable Sir John Simon, 0.C.S.I*• etc#, etc*, etc*, The Foreign Office*m February 2nd, the head tennahi, on ay instructions, saw the Public prosecutor of Tehran, and the information which he obtained was embodied in a further note to the Minister — for Foreign Affairs, of which I enelose a copy. X may add that in addition to the written correspondence X have more recently spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that oral reminders have been given to other members of the Ministry. 4. You will see from this correspondence that Moses Joseph has been detained in custody for over five months without a regular charge being even formulated, and that this delay has been/caused by his having been brought quite unnecessarily and improperly to Tehran. The present position is that the police are waiting for the Amnieh to send an escort to take hi® back to Xhuzistan. P g # Being sent back to Khusistan will not in itself help hi®, and I propose to press the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to arrange his release privately on the ground that he has already been sufficiently punishea for any act of negligence that he may have committed. There Is just a ^possibility that if an opan dispute a an be avoided the man might be able to secure re-employaent on the railway (although I hare heard rumours to the eifeot that prior to the accident he had a reputation as a heavy drinker) and if so it is naturally in his interest that « s ismite should be avoided. If, however, - amfceen a^le to arrange for Moses Joseph's wife to visit him regularly and has himself seen him in the polioe detention^ where he is kept. He has apparently no complaints to make as to his actual treatment. Els food is adequate and he may supplement it mt of his own pocket. His quarters are clean and furnished with a hed, and he is allowed a hath twice a week. When he was ill with rheumatism, he was kept for about two months in hospital, where he was well looked after. ?♦ Arrangements were being mad® for his release on hail at the time that the examining magistrate decided that he should he returned to Mhuzlstan. The arrangements were thereupon dropped. 8, I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Mo* 19 ) f and to Els MaJesty T s Consul at idiwaz (Ho. 11}.

The driver was not held responsible for the damage* on or about August 28, Hoses Joseph was responsible for a collision near to Shush which apparently occurred through negligence* According to the report sent to Ahwas the driver was asleep and handed over the control of the engine to a friend, who ran past the signal and collided with another train, damaging the engine but causing no casualties. Joseph Moses hiaself awoke in ti»e and Jumped clear, escaping injury. A further report states that a hottle of araq. was found on the engine. The driver denied that he had handed over control of the engine or that he had been drinking and stated that the brakes were defective. Mr* Wilson, the Assistant Manager, states that e of the accident at the time ww- /instruetions * E. Hoare, Esquire, C.M.G*, His Britannic Majesty’• Minister, etc., etc., etc., British Legation,no Instructions tor the driver to he put under arreet, hut charge was then or has subsequently been made against him. As It was not known what charge to maJce. The matter was referred to the local Court which was unable to advise the R&amp;lXwoy Aamini gtr at ion so to wii&amp;t charge- to pr©f* or • The Police report on the case which was forwarded to Teheran stated that the engine was badly damaged and would be a total loss. I am informed that the driver was cent there in custody on instructions from the present Minister of Communications. The reason for this is said to be that information about the first accident had been supplied privately to His Majesty the chah, who discovered that no official report on the matter was sent to Teheran. It was accordingly decided that the present case should be dealt with in Teheran to avoid further explanations! to His Majesty, who has also been informed about the second accident. In view of the fact that no criminal charge has been made against Hoses Joseph Kohek&amp;r, I am of the opinion that steps should be taken to secure his liberation. In this event it may be necessary to repatriate him. Mr. Wilson himself suggests that if no official intervention is decided on the man might employ a lawyer. If necessary, to secure an order from the Court for his release, as It Is not the intention of the aailway Administration to take any a.tlon against him.

It would appear therefore that (a) his transfer to Tehran was ordered by the Public Prosecutor of Fhuzistan at the behest of the Ministry of Communications acting ultra vires and (b) that his continued incarceration in &amp; police prison in Tehran persisted for five months without trial and without in fact a mformal charge of any crime being brought against hi®. 9 # Moreover&gt; despite the fact that the . ub 1 ic prosecutor’s Department ordered the man s return to Khuzistan a month ago he is still in prison in ienr&amp;n. j therefore have no choice but to enter a vigorous protest against what amounts to flagiant abuse adrainlstratiYe authority and against the ww soandalous delay in operating the legal procedure provided for such cases hy the Persian code.

[E 610/610/34] January 31, 1933. Seci i No. 1. :on a&gt;.z. 872 Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 3ll) 197)?^ (No. 9.) — SiL . 1 1 n Tehran, January 14, 1933. I HAVE recently received, from a variety of sources, information that Hi&amp; Majesty the Shah has issued instructions that no Persian subject, save in exceptional circumstances, should visit any foreign Embassy or Legation. My colleagues have all heard the same story, and although the members of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs deny it, and we have no documentary evidence to go upon, I have the honour to bring to your notice the evidence which leads me to think that the story is not ill-founded. 2. The first story I heard was that on the morning of a dance which I gave for the British colony and some others on the 28th December last His Majesty announced to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he had decided that no Persian was in future to visit foreign Legations. Feroughi replied that he had already accepted an invitation to a dance at the British Legation; was he to refuse at the last moment? The Shah asked whether other Persians had been invited, and Feroughi imagined that some had been bidden, to which His Majesty replied that they could go, but it was to be for the last time. I subsequently heard the same story told about the Minister of War, Sardar As’ad; and from a fellow-Bakhtiari (Sardar Zafar, K.B.E.) a member of my staff received a message that, although he was too well known a friend of the British to believe that he was forbidden to come to the Legation, yet he had heard that the Shah wished people not to mix with foreigners, and so preferred to keep away for the present. The President of the Majlis, after accepting my invitation to the dance on the 28th, did not appear : he sent an elaborate letter of apology the next day. Several members of my staff have noticed that Persians who used to come to their houses now make excuses and stay away. The most striking example of avoidance of a foreign Legation was, however, the refusals sent to the German Minister by a number of Persians whom he had invited to dine; the excuse in each case being a previous engagement, though the invitations had been sent out fully ten days 3 All these indications seem to show that His Majesty, on or about the 28th December, did issue some order or warning against normal social ^ela ions with foreign representatives. My Italian colleague ta s | • £ £ ‘ Iran Club ” as a protest; and in ordinary intercourse with Persians un c omf o rtabteuncertamtyprevai 1 S h a t ^ ^ is thought t0 h issued this remarkable order, Mirza Hussein Khan Ala ^ reported to haw brought t°^e Shah’s notice the fact btugh/t light examining the affairs of the National -nr- tomans .

From the beginning of kf'km miHtary officers and foreign Legations wished to curtail all intercourse between mima v he [691 hh—2]r i! ft. i ’ vi i m : 4 L;: It was not until last year that a definite order was issued to all officers to refrain from all such intercourse, but previously the Shah’s wishes in this respect were well known and generally observed. , „ , x 8. The abolition of the Capitulations m 1926 was hailed (according to careful instructions) as a step forward towards the great goal of freedom from the foreigners’ yoke. Not long after this foreign Legations were gradually subjected to an annoying interference in the choice of Persians whom they were allowed to invite to their official parties; an order being finally issued (it is still in force) that no Persian functionary of a rank lower than the eighth class of official could be present at such a function. Persian officials, when taxed with this stupid rule, fall back on the ingenious argument that the Persian Govern ment imposed these wise regulations in order to safeguard foreign Legations’ prestige. 9. Then, in 1929, we learnt from Miss Rosita Forbes that the Shah himself told her that in a few years he hoped that there would not be a foreigner in Persian employ. Again, we can observe the increasing difficulties of the missionary schools in Persia, both British and American, in carrying on their work; culminating in the complete suppression of all foreign primary schools last year. Rumours (the truth of which Teymourtache categorically denied when I questioned him two months ago) still persist of draconian legislation soon to be passed by the Majlis, which would practically make it impossible for European doctors to practise in Persia. 10. His Majesty has in recent years been less and less inclined to receive foreign representatives in audience. It would be going too far to cite the various monopoly regulations, exchange restrictions and passport regulations as a proof of design to make the foreigner’s position more difficult; their true explanation may be economic pressure from Russia, or retaliatory measures, or simply officious incapacity : but the result on the whole has been to make Persia a more and more uncomfortable country to live in. 11. The latest manifestation of xenophobia is a strange notice which appeared in the Persian press on the 7th and 8th January, 1933, issued by the Municipality of Tehran. It draws attention to the fact that most of the shops in Tehran have their signs inscribed with titles in foreign characters, for example, ‘‘ Bonheur,” Hotel Bristol,” Salon de Coiffure Figaro,” &amp;c., and states that as everybody must agree that this practice is in opposition with national prestige and national dignity, all shop proprietors are warned that from the 21st March next all shop signs must be inscribed in large Persian letters with the foreign characters in smaller type below.” Whether this nationalistic fervour originated from His Majesty or from his trusted servant, the uncouth General enm Agha Buziarjumihri (the head of the municipality) is not known. , ^ have personally had so few opportunities of observing His Majesty a cannot record any direct evidence from personal observation of coldness owar s oreigners. Perhaps the truth of the matter is that His Majesty, whose r™ eilC f are wel ! known and appear to be becoming more • with ojd^age, is, on the subject of foreigners, slightly demented.

I HAVE, the honour to report that, according to information received by the military attache of this Legation, a new order has been issued within the las{ few days by the Shah to the officers of his army, repeating with added emphasis the order against social relations with Europeans, reported in Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 268 of the 1st June, 1931. In order, moreover, to emphasise the importance of the matter, the order has been circulated with instructions that it should be initialled by each officer. 2. It is,, of course, natural to regard this matter as a further manifestation of Imperial xenophobia, although Persians in touch with the Legation appear to believe that its main object is to put a stop to the increasing number of alliances contracted by Persian officers with Russian women. If this is the case, the measure is perhaps justified, in order to protect the army against undesirable influences, to which it might conceivably become exposed through the inability of the susceptible Persian officers to protect themselves. 3. The recent espionage trial reported in my despatch No. 305, dated the I 1st July, would naturally tend to make the Shah uneasy about subversive / influences in the army, especially at a time when evidence of unrest is accumu- / lating, while the confidences of General Airom, reported in a separate despatch, / show that, in some influential quarters at any rate, there is anxiety on the subject/ of communistic propaganda. ^ ^ 4 I am unaware of the exact wording of the order, but an example oi the extent to which Persian officers are now restricted from associating with Europeans is provided by the following incident: While dining recently with some Persians at a restaurant which is frequented bv both Europeans and Persians, the acting oriental secretary received a message from a Persian officer, who was seated at the next table, to the effect that hecould not speak to him in the restaurant, be flad to meet him in some less public place. This officer, whom Mi. Monypenny has known well for twelve years, was careful ^ avoid^dirwt wmmumcatiom aftWh seated close bv, and sent his message through a mutual friend German lady however,' who was also present, exchanged greetings with the o™to the’amusement of a number of Persian civilians who warned him of the fate which awaited him for speaking to a Em opean la &gt;. this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the 5.

Head of English section of the Ministry of Foreign Aifairs to-day initiated discussion with me regarding demand for money compensation. He tried to make me admit moral satisfaction had keen afforded hy dismissal of officer and that if money was due to victim at all • compensation should he limited- to his medical expenses and loss of wages while incapacitated. He was anyhow only a poor man. I refused to agree with this view and its implication. He deprecated import ance attached to the case by His Majesty's Legation. I maintained that it was a matter involving an import ant principle. He insisted that question ought to be settled locally by His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire and that reference to His Majesty's Government and the government of India was uncalled for. 1 replied protection of a British subject was a fundamen tal obligation justifying such a reference. He practically invited me to name a sum of mbney .^uimat ing that he was tired of receiving and writing official notes on tho subject and would like to settle it un officially. I told him I was awaiting instructions Iren youyou and would name sum in a day or two. End ox R. It is evident that hint at publicity already given has had its effect. The ultimatum suggested in my telegram No. 182 may now be superfluous and may indeed defeat its end. But 1,000 rupees suggested by government of India see government of India’s telegram No. 2120 S to Secretary of State for India seems to me too large as unlikely of acceptance by Persian government. It will be politic to settle this case without less of face on either side by compromise. Persian government arc probably willing to buy on puolici dy for a certain small sum. If we accept it oesoon wnl not, have been lost on them and weapon of publicity will be fresh for future cases. I suggest I be authorised to accept say a minimum of 300 rupees: I will try to obtain 500 rupees but request that I may be allowed to use my own discretion.

We are proposing to submit to our higher authorities a draft reply to Dodd^ agreeing with the Government of India that the compensation to be claimed should be Rs. 1,000, and approving the course of action which he proposes. We think, however, that it might be well to suggest to Dodd that oral representations on these lines may be better than a further official note. We might add that if publicity becomes necessary, arrangements will be made for the facts ko be reported in the press here.

Sir, In continuation of / despatch ho* 170/2752, aated the December 1930, regarding the flogging of a British Inaian subject by the Officer Commanding Troops at Charter, I have the honour to state that as far as I am aware no action has teen taken in one matter at present. The Governor informs me that he is enquiring into the matter and told my interpreter verbally that he had telegraphed to Tehran and was confident that the officer concerned would be recalled. He further showed my interpreter a letter which he had addressed to the Daftar-i- Shahi in which he pointed out that this incident was a result of the confusion of jurisdiction at present prevailing at Charbar and that even if the Officer Commanding Troops there v/as under the General Officer Commanding Baluchistan he had no right to usurp the functions of governor and to claim to be exempt from the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Sardar Intisar has suggested that the present Officer Command ing Troops at Charbar should be recalled and that the Ciiicer Commanding Troops at Bandar Abbas, Charbar and Cask should be placed under the Officer Commanding Troops, .lus.ure, and tne Governors of those places should be made subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. This latter arrangement exists already I believe in theory, but in practice in these outlying places the local military authorities are ^-powerful. Sardar ■ ^ H-i or'iic sed the matter with Amir-i- Intisar added that he nad discussed .he •v • t -hiraz and the latter was strongly m lashkar Shaibam at uhir favour of the proposal. , t + gr lias now been referred In view of the fact that the matter t Busnire to the Central Government, the local authorities a - - be made I would venture to suggest that representat ^ -- a iy by you regarding this incident to the M Affairs. There are inistry for Foreign a considerable number of Indians, both Mohammadans and Hindus, living and trading in all the Gulf ports, and unless prompt measures are taken to protect them from arbitrary actions and oppression at the hands of subordinate military officials it will shortly be impossible for them to pursue their avocations in outlying places. hhe name o± txie British Indian subject who was flogged is Mukhtar Yusaf. If investigation shows that the facts are as stated in the Clerk~in-Charge*s telegram, I would suggest that a claim for compensation on his behalf should be submitted to the Persian Government. He is clearly entitled to compensa tion for the outrage perpetrated upon him and only so will the necessity for controlling the actions of subordinate military officials be brought home to the Persian Government* I a.rn sending a copy of this despatch to the government of India.* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.
