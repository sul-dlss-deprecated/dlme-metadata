GENERAL STAFF, INDIA CALCUTTA SUPERINTENDENT GOVERNMENT PRINTING, INDIA 1918NOTE. K Volume III comprises that portion of south-western Persia; which is bounded on the west by the Turco-Persian frontier: on the north and east by a line drawn through the towns of Khaniqm; Isfahan, Yazd, Kirman, and Bandar Abbas : and on the south by the Persian Gulf.ABAD (1)— Lat. 29° 2' N. ; Long. 51° 1G' E. ; Elev. A village in the Tangistan district of Ears, 10 miles north by west of Ahram. It contains 80 houses inhabited by Zanganeh, a Persian tribe 1 from the interior. Pelly says they are called Abadehis. The inhabi tants grow wheat, barley, dates and melons ; they manufacture charcoal and collect firewood.— (Petty m , Foreign Dept. Gazetteer, 1905.) ’ABAD (2)— A tribe of Hindlan district (q.v.). ’ABADAT— A division of the ’Anafijeh tribe (q.v.). ABADEH (1)—Lat. 31° 11' N. ; Long. 52° 41' 30' E. ; Elev. 6,100'. A walled town in Ears, 140 miles south-east of Isfahan, and 185 miles from Shiraz, by post-road. It is the 8th caravan, and the 9th post-stage from Shiraz. It is the chief town of a district, with a Deputy Governor (Naib Hakim). Population 6,000. Telegraph house of Indo-European Telegraph Company r with clerk in charge, and telephone communication with Qumisheh and Deh Bid. Morier says the first appearance of Abadeh announces a large place, but on a nearer inspection the town exhibits only a great extent of ruined walls without inhabitants. The present population lives within a square en closure, one side of which is a strong fort, with high brick walls, two tiers of loopholes, and flanked by well-built towers. It is in form a parallelo gram, about 350 yards by 50 yards, with two gates connected by a wide street. Some of the houses are inside this fort, which, with the post-house and another walled inclosure, forms three sides of a square ; the fourth being filled by the unwalled village. Some remarkably delicate and artistic wood-carving the art of the peasants, emanates from this neighbourhood. It takes the form of boxes, photo-frames, and sherbet spoons chiefly. Supplies of all kinds procurable, the locality being particularly noted for fruits. Water excellent and plentiful from numerous water-courses. It has a very good climate, and a dry and bracing atmosphere. The winter is severe, but less so than at Deh Bid. . Tllls village is known as Abadeh-i-Iqlid to distinguish it from Abadeh- i-Tashk.—(Moner ; Ouseley ; Petty ; Taylor ; Gibbon ; Trotter ; (Idling : Bailward ; Arbuthnot, 1905). ABADEH (1)—Disteict. Boundaries.—The boundary of the district, where it crosses the Shiraz- Isfahan road, is somewhat vague. According to one account it follows the ridge of the Gard-i-Gir range between Yazd-i-khast and Amlnabad, accord ing to another account (confirmed bv the Fdrsnameh) it lies between Amlna- Pt. 1, B2 ABA-lBl bad and Macjsud Begi. The southern boundary crosses the road a few miles north of Khaneh Khurreh ; to the east the Dum-i-Lar range divides it from the Ab kuh district, the Talingi pass being the boundary on the Abadeh-Abrkuh road. To the west a fairly well-defined range separates the district from that known as Chehar Dangeh. Population. —The annexed list gives a total of 2,800 houses in the district, excluding the towns of Abadeh and Iqlxd. Adding 200 to this number, on account of 12 villages of which we have no statistics, gives us a total of 3,000 houses ; and 1,0(0 for Iqlld and 500 for Abadeh and we have 4,500 for the whole district. This means, assuming the correctness of our figures, a sedentary population of about 25,000. The population includes some 500 Bahais. Nomads scarcely live in the district at all, but it has nevertheless suffered greatly from their depredations in recent years. The Yazd-hkhast-Amm- abad part of the main road is particularly liable to raids by Bojr Ahmadi and other tribes, but all the roads in the district are at present extremely unsafe. Miss Ross, a lady doctor travelling from Ispahan to Shiraz, was twice robbed in November 1911, once near Shulgistan. once near Khaneh .Khurreh. Products and Commerce. —Wheat, barley, cotton, gum ; a little dairy pro duce and wool are also available for export. Coal is said to exist in the Khaneh Khurreh hills. Abadeh, rather than Iqlid, is the collecting and distributing centre of the district; it has a fairly well-stocked bazaar, furnished principally from Ispahan, at present, owing to the disturbed state of the Shiraz-Abadeh road. In an ordinary year a brigade stationed here could obtain supplies with out serious inconvenience to the inhabitants. For details of accommoda tion. etc., for troops see, Route 59. Revenue. —The annual mdlidt of the district is 17,900 T. p. a., but Saulat- ud-Dauleh, Qashqai, collected 23,000 T. in 1909-10 and 40,000 T. in 1910-11, Of the 40,000 T. collected in 1911, 32,000 T. went to the Saulat and the remaining 8,000 T. to the Deputy Governor of Abadeh and his staff. Climate and Sanitation. —Maximum thermometer in 1911 was 95 Q in the shade : minimum thermometer in 19ll was 18°. Syphilis is very prevalent amongst the population of Abadeh, nearly 90 per cent of whom are infected. The disease is spreading rapidly among the neighbouring villages, For further details see Wilson’s Fars 1916 from which above is taken, ABADEH (2)— Lat. 29° 49' 45' N. ; Long. 53° 39' E.; Elev. A village in Fars, 54J miles north-east of Darab, on the north shore of Lake Nargis. It consists of a fort and a camp of about 200 tents. This is the head-quarters of the Lashani tribe and the Kaldntdr, or headman of the tribe, resides here. The valley in which the village lies is green and fertile, and furnishes good supplies. The villagers own large flocks of sheep and goats and numerous cattle and homes. This locality is very healthy.and there is an excellent camping-ground. Near here Lieutenant Stotherd’s party was attacked in 1893. Wells says that a road leads from here through Qawam ? Ali (Khwaja Jamall) to Shahr-i-Babak. This village is known as Abadeh-i-Tashk and produces wheat, barley, beans and opium winter sowins ; green, almonds, pomegranates and some grapes as summer sowings.— (Petty ; Ross ; Wells ; Stotherd, 1893.) ABADEH-I-TASHK— A small district, bounded on north by Raushan Kuh, apd the Qunqurl and Sarchahan districts : on the south by Lake Nargls or Tashk, on the east by the Niriz district, on the west by that of Kurbaland Arsinjan. Its inhabitants are of the Lashani and Chehar-rahi tribes. The chief village is Khwajeh Jamall. The probable population is about 6,500.—(Wilson, 1911.) ABADl —Lat. Long. Elev. 6,780'. A small village on the Zindeh Rud, 22 miles from Imamzadeh Isma’il, surrounded by poplars, vines, and fields of wheat and barley.— (Bell.) S ABAD ILLAHl— Lat. 30° 10' 50' N. ; Long. 49° 39' 30' E.; Elev. A village in Southern ’Arabistan, on the right bank of the river Hindian, 2 miles south-west of Gaz *AlL It is inhabited by 150 Bahrakun Arabs, who grow grain and own 10 horses, 40 cattle, 40 donkeys and 1,000 sheep. A track runs from here to Bandar Ma’shur— (Foreign Depart ment Gazetteer, 1905.) ABANDANAN— A river of Khuzistan, which rises in the hills of the Lur tribe of Sagwand, and falls into the Kharkeh in the lower part of the small plain of Patak.— (Layard .) ABARGtfH —Lat. Long. Elev. A village on the east shore of Lake Wmz.—(Stotherd, 1893.) ABAZAR— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Zaidan plain on the right bank of the river Hindian. 1 mile west by north of ’Askari. It contains 80 houses of Kurwais, a tribe from the Kuhgalu Lur country. 40 donkeys, 30 cattle and 200 sheep and goats are owned here, but no horses.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) ABBAD— A spring in Kirman about 46| miles north-east of Sa’id-abad, and 1 mile from the village of Takia. The water, although cold, bubbles up with a considerable noise, as if it were boiling.—(£;yto, May 1900.) ’ABBADAN (Island)— (Also called Jazirat-uI-Khidhar from a shrine near its centre) is a large and valuable island enclosed by the Karun on the north, by the Shatt-al- Arab on the west, by the Persian Gulf on the south, and by the Bahmanshir on the east. Its length is about 40 miles, and its width varies from about miles at the middle to 12 miles near its southern end. The centre is mostly desert, but the margins of the rivers, as far inland as th» creeks b 24 ’ABB—’ABB extend, are cultivated and planted with dates : much land is now being reclaimed in the Ma’amareh neighbourhood near the south end. A sub marine prolongation of the island into the Persian Gulf forms the great reef of Maraqqat 'Abbadan. The inhabitants are almost all Ka’b Arabs, belonging in the northern part to the Drls, and in the southern part to the Nassar main division of that tribe. A considerable tract in the north-eastern corner is known by the name of Maharzi. Its limits are Shakhab-ul-Haiak on the northern, and Huz ’Umar on the eastern shore of the island, and Muhammareh town is opposite the centre of its nor thern extremity. The shrine of Khidhar stands a little nearer to the north than to the south end of the island, about 2 miles from the Shatt-al-’Arab and 1 mile from the Bahmanshlr : it is largely visited by the Shi’ahs of the surrounding districts. Muhammadan theologians are not agreed whether this mysterious personage Khidhar is a prophet or not. Some of them even deny his existence ; but there are, on the other hand, Suf! mystics who affirm that they have seen him. He is believed to have existed in the time of Abraham, to have been a companion of Moses, and to be still alive in consequence of having drunk of the water of life. Some Muhammadan commentators identify him with the prophet Elias, others with Saint George of England : one even makes him a general in the army of Alexander the Great. The south coast of the island appears to be fairly firm and well-marked, but there are no fixed villages on it. Total population is reported to be about 24,000. The two southern administrative divisions are Manluhl and Qasbat Nassar. In each of the villages bearing these names there is a representative of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The part of the island north of Maniuhi was formerly under the chief Shaikh of the Dris Ka’b, but it is now in charge of the Shaikh of the Ahl-ul-’Arlaz Muhaisin. The island is itself included in the Muhammareh district of Southern ’Arabistan. During the Persian campaign of 1856 the Persians erected five batteries on the north side of the island, some of which were intended to prevent the British passing up the Shatt-al-’Arab, or Bahmanshir to Muhammareh. An oil refinery has been established at the north end of the Island by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (vide Arabistan, Southern), to which the oil is carried in pipes from Maidan-i-Naftun, some 30 miles south-east of Shushtar. A screw pile jetty has been constructed, alongside which ocean steamers can moor, and discharge their cargo direct to the Com pany’s trucks. There is an engineer’s shop filled with up-to-date machinery. There are two large lathes to take shafting up to 16 ft. in length and 9 ins. to 10 ins. in diameter, several drilling and screwing machines, and a circular saw for cutting steel. The fitting shop holds vice benches and vices for thirty-six fitters. In the blacksmiths’ shop there are twelve forges and a pneumatic hammer which can strike a blow equal to 8 cwt., also punching and shearing machines and plate rolls. The carpenters’ and patternmakers’ shops are under construction ; the foundry is only just commenced. The stores are lofty and commodious, and are fitted in the most up-to-date manner.Ib b— ’AbD 5 A AB BARIK— Lat. 29° 45' N. ; Long. 52° 38' E. ; Elev. A small kdrlz of good water in Shiraz.

AB-I-BEHISHTABAD— A considerable stream in Luristan draining the whole of the Chehar Mahal planteau. It has several sources, of which the Ab-i-Juna_qan from the north-east, the Ab-i-Jehanbin from the north, and the Ab-i-Shalamzar from the south-east are the chief. All three unite before the stream enters the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash at the south-west extremity of the plateau. Passing through this ravine it falls 600 feet in 6 miles and emerges just above the village of Behishtabad. Two miles farther on it runs it into the river Karun after a course of some 75 miles (vide this Gazetteer—Karun River).

It rises near Karind, flows south-east through the Karind plain past Harunabad, and down a wide, fertile valley into the Harasam plain. In a course due south from Harasam, it forces its way through the lofty ridges of the Vardalan Kuh, by an enormous rift, some miles long, called the Tang-I-Salim, emerges into the Charduvar valley, and from there turns south-east. In Charduvar, it receives tributaries from Zangavar and from the head of the valley, and lower down joins the Saimarreh river. At the Tang-i-Salim, its point of passage through the Vardalan range, the bed is about 50 yards broad. When crossed in August, there was a good flow of water .—(Rawlinson ; Mannsell, 1888.) AB-I-DALLIEH, vide DALLIEH (AB-I-). AB-I-DARREH-I-TAKHT— A stream which rises on the Kuh-i-Shuturan and, passing the village Dar- reh-i-Takht, flows into the Kamandab river, 53 miles south-east of Burujird. AB-I-DIZ or AB-I-DIZ (River)— A river of Luristan and ’Arabistan. rising in the mountains of Kuh-i- Garru, north-west of Burujird town. As to what is really the parent stream, there is some confusion, but Major Sawyer’s explorations in 1890 proved that there are two main streams, one flowing from near Burujird and draining Silakhur, the other draining upper Farldan and passing Baznui. Hence he calls them the Ab-i-Burujird and the Ab-i-Baznui. The former appears to be regarded by the best authorities as the main stream, while the latter has become one of the main affluents of the Ab-i-Diz under the name of the Gand Ab. blowing south-east for some 16 miles from its source in the mountains, the Ab-i-Diz turns south-south-east through the fertile Silakhur valley which it irrigates, and passes at 20 miles the thriving Twn of Burujird, some 3 miles from its left bank. Flowing onwards in the same direction past many villages, the Ab-i-Diz receives the tribute of several small streams from cither bank. At about 48 miles Chalan Ohulan (Alan-Chulan) is reached. Here Colonel Bell in 1884 struck the Ab-i-Diz. He says the place is 161 miles (presumably byroad) from Burujird. The valley, he sayo, is from 5 to 10 miles broad, flat and swampy in places, the soil being clay and growing fine wheat and barley. The same authority gives inter alia the following report •— “ A good mule road traverses the well-cultivated valley of the Ab-i- Diz ; soil clay; wheat growing 2 inches high ; 22nd April, barometer 24*8* ■(5,350 feet)' The general run of the valley here is 140° and 340°. Nearing the river the valley becomes very swampy, and for 1 mile horses and mules found •the. greatest difficulty in traversing it, sinking over their fetlocks into the sticky clay at each step. “ There is a ford over the river Diz, 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet deep ; current swift, 250 feet to 300 feet wide. There are here the remains of a masonry bridge, of which four arches only are now (1884) standing. Beyond the bridge the river valley is swampy ; barometer 25-0' (4,870 feet). The river is generally fordable except after rain. “ The valley is bordered on either hand by hills, those to the east being less in height by 200 feet to 300 feet ; those to west are still snow-topped. ” At 53 miles the Ab-i-Diz receives the water of a somewhat larger stream from the north-east, called by Strauss the “ Sira. ” At 70 miles Bahrain is reached, and her a large tributary, the Kamand Ab, joins the Ab-i-Diz from the east. Thus reinforced he river turns south-south-west and enters the mountain range of Takht-i-Kalan Kuh at the Tang-i-Bahrain, whence, says Colonel Bell, a Bakhtian road via Lanjaur leads by seven stages to Shushtar. From the Tang-i-Bahrain, the river forces its way through a succession of chasms and gorges, and the track along its bank is utterly im practicable : indeed this part of the range is so very precipitous that there is only one single pathway conducting across it from Dizful to Burujird ; it is followed by Itmts on foot : it is not to be traversed by a horseman, and is considered the most d fficult of all the mountain pathways. It breaks into the Sahneh-i-Lur between the hill forts of Tanga van and Kaleh-i- Shahi. During its passage through the mountains the Ab-i-Diz receives many small streams from either side. It finally emerges from the mountains after a total course of some 120 miles at a point 47 miles north-north-east of Dizful in a straight line, where its volume is increased by the Ab-i-Zaz flowing into it from the east. Near the point where the Ab-i-Diz leaves the mountains, is the celebrated Diz-i-Shahi. From here its course is indefinite, but it probably forms an arch westward round the spurs of the Kuh-i-Aialu and the Chal-i-Nark, and skirting the Dirakwand country. At approximately 140 miles it unites with the Gand-Ab—the Ab-i-BaznuI of Major Sawyer—some 15 miles south-west of Pul-i-Kul, and 32 miles north-east of Dizful town. The Gand-Ab, the other parent branch of the Ab-i-Diz and by which name it is also called, is fernud by two streams, rising one on either side ■of Kaleh-i Surkh, a spur of the mountains on the west of Farldan, which unite after some 15 miles, and flow’ south-west apparently under the name of the Golun river. After 20 miles the river, wffiich throughout its length flow's through very mountainous country, turns north-west to Baznui which is reached at 60 miles. The Chal-i-Siah forces it to turn sharp, and it flows south-south-west for some 20 miles, receiving a tributary from the east rather more than half-way dowm this bend. Turning again north west round Kuh Rita and then in a more westerly direction, its course re sembles the coils of a snake as it winds through the mountains towards Pul-i-Kul. At about 99 miles Pul-i-Shlrak is passed, and at 143 Pul-i-Kul is reached. Here the river is generally called the Ab-i-Diz and is about100 yards bf6kd and very rapid. It rushes through a gotge at iU rate of about 10 miles an hour. There is a route from Pul-i-Kul to Dizful of eight stages. The path lies along the edge of the water on slippery slate-stone rock, sometimes scarcely broad enough fot a Ulan to get a foothold. The Hats say that they lose a considerable number of their animals yearly along this route when going to and from their summer quarters. There are two ruined bridges here about l mile apart. Soon after leaving Pul-i-Kul this branch of the river leaves the mountains, and after another 2 miles in a south-westerly direction, or a total course of some 160 miles, unites with the other parent stream of the Ab-i-Diz. The united stream continues south-west along the foot of the mountains for some 23 miles, when it turns south, with a sHght bend to the west round Kaleh Shahid. The Ab-i-Diz now enters ’Arabistan, and after a course of some 180 miles from the birth of the chief parent stream above Burujird, reaches the populous town of Dizful, standing on the left bank of the river. The name Dizful from “ Diz-i-Pul, ” i.e., the “ Fort of the Bridge, ” is derived from the splindid bridge, doubtless of Sassanian struc ture,°which here spans the stream. Its lower part is of stone, and evidently of greater antiquity than the superstructure which is of brick. It is 430 yards in length and contains 24 arches of Varying shap6 and span, but is in a dilapidated condition. Some of the arches have fallen in, and one arch built of brick by the townspeople, to replace one which collapsed about 1903, is of inferior workmanship. Communication, however, exists over the river by this bridge, which is described more fully in this Gazetteer under Dizful town. At a little distance above the town a number of flour mills are worked by the current of the Diz river. The river here is swift, of no great depth, and is obstructed by rocks. For further details regard ing Dizful —vide this Gazetteer—Dizful town. Below Dizful the bed of the river is broad and shingly, and the stream flows in several arms. The adjacent country is depressed to its level, and small canals leave both banks as it flows for some 12 miles to the south west. At 191 miles the Bala Bud from the north joins the Ab-i-Diz, and soon afterwards the river turns south ^south-east. At 198 miles the river becomes more united above Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah, and at 201 miles the rhins of Susa are passed standing some 6 miles west of the right bank. Opposite this point the left bank of the river is heavily irrigated. The direction of the river continues generally to the south-south-east to a point within 8 miles of the bank of the river Karun below Wais ; but the course of this section is extraordinarily serpentine and at Ilm Kathir or Khaneh-i-Farhan about 2 miles by land above the important point known as Kut Bandar, it is only about 16 miles from Shushtar. It is said to be so excessively tortuous that frequently in its windings it recoils upon itself within a few yards, and then suddenly diverges for some miles. In one instance a bank little more than 9 feet in breadth, separates the two reaches of the river,■ which after a circuitous course of about 10 miles, returns to the same spot. This fact makes its length difficult to determine even approximately : the distance from DizMl to Band-i-Qir is only about 60 miles in a direct line, but on the basis of a rough survey of the portion between Band-i-Qir aniKtit Bandar, w6 may estimate that the distance by river is between twice and three times as great. The Ab-i-Diz, then leaving Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah, is joind from the north at some 246 miles by the ’Aurtib stream. This- latter is a permanent stream which has its sources in a spring near Kaleh Qazi and joins the Diz river some miles below Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah. At about 260 miles the Kahunak or Shureh river also flows into the Ab-i-Diz from the left ; at 269 miles, where Um Kathir is passed, the Sabz Ab adds its quota to the river ; and at Kut Bandar, which is reached after a course of some 275 miles, the Mukhaibat also pours its water into that of the Ab-i-Diz. At this point a rocky ridge, not more than 100 feet high, i&amp; pierced by the river in its course : this ridge is named Umm-ul-’Ayal. As the river approaches the Karun, its banks contain some forest, and 13 miles- from Band-i-Qlr the Shavur river (vide this Gazetteer) joins it from the north-west. Finally, the Ab-i-Diz empties itself into the river Karun at Band-i-Qir, and loses its identity as a separate river after a total course of some 360 miles. The fall of the river appears to the eye to be more rapid than that of the Shatait or the Gargar. It cuts its way through the alluvial plain between steep banks, rising 10 to 20 feet above flood-level, outside of which there is no marked valley or basin. The true banks are frequently several hundred yards apart at bends, and their re-entrant angles are occupied by low mud deposits covered with scrub jungle. From about 18 miles south of Dizffil to within about the same distance of its junction with the Karun, the course of the Diz lies through a belt of brushwood, not usually more than 2 or 3 miles wide and in places less, with frequent breaks through which glimpses are caught of limitless plains. TreeS from 30 to 40 feet in height are scattered through this jungle, yet there is no wood fit for anything but fuel; the principal trees and shrubs are the Gharab or Euphrates poplar, the Sarim, the tamarisk, the blackberry, and the liquorice-bush or Sus. Fuel for the steamers on the Karun, for the towns of Shushtar and Nasirl and to a certain extent for Dizful town, is obtained from this tract. The climate of the Diz country is undoubtedly much more humid than that of ’ Arabistan generally, and in spring there is abundant pasturage upon both sides of the river. Fuel and fodder are obtainable, and the Arabs in the neighbourhood own numbers of buffaloes, cattle and sheep. On the left bank above Kut Bandar there is much irrigated cultivation of wheat and barley.. The settled villages of the upper Diz will be found in the article on Dizful district ; the last is Khaneh-i-Farhan, already mentioned, below which the country is occupied by nomads of the ’Anafijeh and Ai Kathir tribes. In a favourable state of the river there is no obstacle to navigation, ex cept a strong current, between Band-i-Qir and Kut Bandar, which lies 85 miles above it by water. At Kut Bandar the channel is interrupted by a reef of rock ; the reef is pierced, however, by an opening about 20 yards from the left bank, which in a good river carries from 4| to 6 feet of water, but is somewhat difficult owing to the strong current. A little higher up there is a second reef, but the soundings in the passage through it are better. Above Kut Bandar, in consequence of a steeper incline of the bed, the current is more rapid ; the depth also is less, and the gravelly and, in places, rocky nature of\2 Ab-i—AB-I the channel would make it dangerous to force a thimbottomed vessel should it show signs of grounding. Kut Bandar may therefore be considered the practical limit of navigation for vessels of the type of the Shushan, which is a stern wheeler of 100 feet length over all, 23 feet beam, and 3 feet ordinary draught, and which last visited Kut Bandar in March 1905. It is stated, though, that during the spring rises of the river, navigation is possible for a large, light-draught steamer as far as Deh-i-Nau, about 100 miles by river and 20 miles by land from Dizful, but there is no surveyed route on record between these points. On March 1893 the Shushan ascended the Diz as far as Jisir, about 14 miles from Dizful in a direct line. The river, says Commander Plant, is from 100 to 250 yards wide. The current runs at 3 knots below, and 5 knots above, Kut Bandar. The following is Commander Plant’s report on the passage of the Diz from Band-i-Qir up to Jisir :— Derak /shmtb—Channels intricate, snags at top end of island. Saiyed Ahmad Ta/fK—Channels intricate. Kut Bandar. —Rocks extend across river. Good channel on south side. Shingle bed from here up stream ; no holding for anchors. Good landing place fcr troops, covered by series of mounds. Kut Lawl or Kut Halawl. —Bend in river very sharp and small ; current very strong. High mounds to south-west running north-west, afford commanding position on right bank. Tigtaka Island and Kiit Gastir. —Numerous snags in river and shallow water at both places. Um-u-Safr. —Shingle’bank stretching across river. Channel very nar row, and water extremely powerful. Ah-u-Brais and JmV.—Rapids extend across the river at these two places and navigation very difficult and dangerous. At all seasons of the year the Diz is of a darker colour than either the Shatait or the Gargar : it assumes when in flood, a deep red hue at Dizful, and one verging on chocolate at Band-i-Qir. The proportion of silt carried is about the same as in the river Karun. The river Diz is one of the high roads into the very heart of Persia, and the civilization of the country demands that it should be opened to traffic ; the country it traverses is healthy and fertile ; friendly tribes inhabit it. All considerations point to it and the Karun as a means whereby our political and commercial interests may be increased. The river Diz may perhaps be identified with the Coprates of the ancient geographers.— (Layard ; Selby ; Rawlinson ; Bell, 1884 ; Sawyer ; Curzon, 1889 ; Plant; Burton, 1897 ; Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

(Report of a Journey through the Bakhtidri country to Shilshtar — Bell — Wilson, 1911.) AFSHARS— A tribe of Persians who are spread over Kirman, Fars, Luristan, and Khu- zistan, and round the lake of UrGmieh. No good account of them is available. They are said to be of Turkish origin and to speak a dialect of that language. Morier says their two principal branches are Shamlu and Karklu, and they number 20,000 families. They principally reside in towns and are to be found in great numbers at Ab-i-Vard, the birthplace of Nadir Shah, who was of the Karklu branch of this tribe, and at Kalat, the place so care fully peopled and strengthened by that conqueror. The Afshars are looked on with great suspicion by the present dynasty of Persia. They were one of the seven Turkish tribes to whom Shah Isma’Il Safavi owed much of his success, and to whom, in consequence, he gave the name of Kizil Bash. Napier adds that Shah Isma’Il Safavi, who brought the clan from Azarbaljan, whither they had emigrated in the track of Tartar traders from the banks of the Jaxartes, settled there in the open valley of the Qibqan, in which are the hamlets of Darband Qibqan, the first village in the state of Darreh Gaz. AFZAR—Lat. 28° 15' N. ; Long. 53° 10' E. ; Elev. A district of Fars, lying south-east of Shiraz and Flruzabad. It pro duces wheat, barley, tobacco, gram, dates and cotton. The inhabitants are mainly sedentary Turks, with a proportion of Persian tdjiks or peasants. They are entirely under the control of the Qashqai Chiefs, who for the most part own the lands. The district consists of two plains, one that of Afzar, to the north, the second, immediately south of it, that of Laghar and Maku, on the right and left bank respectively of the Mund, here known as the Waz River. All the villages have extensive irrigated lands, and a vastly larger area could be brought under cultivation. The total sedentary population is about 3,000. In winter many nomad Qashqai camp in the district, which is on one of the main lines of tribal migration southwards.— (Wilson, 1911.) AGARUB, AB-I— A river 25 mi^s from Shustar on the road to Deh Luran. Banks sloping and easy. 8 yards broad. 4 to 6 inches ((Ranking, 1908.)22 * AGH—AGH AG HA JAR! (1)— “ A tribe of the Hindlan district, comprising 250 families from the real Agha Jari tribe (q.v.), who have settled in the district. (Chick 191% see correction 1911, makes this a distinct tribe.) ” AGHA JAR! (2)— A subtribe of the Liravi KuhgaHis, inhabiting the country north-west of Behbehan. They are classed among the Zir-i-Kuh tribes. History. —Prior to the time of the late Isfandiar Khan, Ilkhanl of the Bakhtiaris, the Agha Jari were a numerous and prosperous tribe, number ing some 2,000 families, under a Chief by name Fateh Agha, who had his headquarters at Julaki. Isfandiar Khan, however, picked a quarrel with this tribe and looted them completely, after which the tribe became split up into small factions, each under a petty Chief. In this state they have remained to the present day, but although split up, still retain their predatory instincts. Ethnography. —The sub-divisions of the Agha Jari are as follows :— 1, Afshar. 2, Bagdali. 3, TtlakQ. 4, Jameh-Buzurgi. 5, JagktaL 6, Daudi. 7, Kara Baghi. 8, Sha’ri. 9, Gashtil. _ 10&gt; Bar Zaban. The following were the various Chiefs of the Agha Jari ; in 1910 (a) Muhammad Husain Khan. (6) Mulla Rah Khuda. (c) Mu 11a Vali Khan, (d) Mulla ’Ali Agha. (e) Husain Agha. (a) Muhammad Husain Khan, son of Fateh Agha, has a following of about 200 families, who inhabit the villages of Dudangeh and Kumieh r but is unable to muster more than 200 fighting men, of whom only f are armed with rifles. (b) Mulla Rah Khuda has a small following of 60 families, living at Lasbid and could muster 60 armed men all told, mounted and dismounted. (c) Mulla Yali Khan, son of Barat Agha, has a following of 100 families whose habitat is at Rudkhaneh-i-Kurmuz, capable of putting 100 armed men into the field. (d) Mulla ’Ali Agha has a smaL following of about 100 families, whose habitat is at Maur-i-Lasbid and can muster 100 armed men. This sub tribe still retains its predatory habits, but descends to petty thieving more than organized looting. (e) The last of the Agha Jari sub-divisions is under the leadership, of Husain Agha, who lives at Kaleh-i-Tilagun, and consists of 100 families (150 fighting men, only 100 of whom possess rifles). The Jaghtal are a small tribe of some 150 families, subject to Mulla Vali Khan of the Agha Jari living in the vicinity of Behbehan, which thpy supply with dairy produce, viz., milk, curds (Lur : mast) and ghi. They are good fighting men, can muster 150, all well armed, under the leadership of Duhrab Agha, who has his headquarters at Mangilas, at which place there is a Fort, in which he lives. There are two other forts in the possession of the Jaghtai, one inhabited by ’Ali Nijat, the other by Lura- liisit. The Jaghtai claim to have come originally from Shiraz and to be descended from Jenghiz Khan. For resources of the tribe and further information under Kuhgalu. (Ranking, 1910.)Layard saj^s the tribe of Gunduzlu of Khuzistan is a branch of the Afshar tribe. They were found here by Nadir Shah and compelled by him to return to the north of Persia, but on his death they again went back to their former pastures. Before their deportment by Nadir, the Afshars occupied the greater part of the province of Khuzistan to the foot of the great chain of mountains, and even the country now inhabited by the Ka’b Arabs, where Dauraq was their principal settlement. The Bakhtiar! were confined to the mountains, and the Afshars were generally sufficiently powerful and united to oppose them with success if they ventured into the plain. The Gunduzlu now number 1,500 fighting-men, and acknowledge the supremacy of the Bakhtiarl Chief. The Afshars also found round lake Urumieh and in the district of Safn Keleh in the south-east of the province of Azarbaijan. In the latter the title was disputed by the Chardaur! tribe, with whom they are in conse quence in a constant state of feud. Sheil, who commanded a regiment of Afshars of Urumieh, says they are the wildest and most turbulent lot in Persia, always quarrelling, robbing and getting drunk. Nevertheless, they had fine physiques, and had the making of very excellent soldiers in them. There are also Afshars in the Kangavar district of Kirmanshah they are sedentary and of the Shiah persuasion. They have the character in Persia of being officious and loquacious flatterers. Abbott mentions coming across encampments of Afshars at several places on his route from Bam to Shiraz.— (Morier ; Malcolm ; Layard ; Sheil; Abbott; Napier.)

It contains # 120 houses of Dumukh, and a caravanserai with 50 rooms for travellers and accommodation for 2,000 animals ; also a town for defence. The village is administratively under Bushire. The villagers cultivate wheat, barley and dates. Supplies are scanty and bad in quality and the water is brackish ; animals are 20 horses, 10 mules, 200 donkeys, 100 cattle, 800 sheep and goats.— (Clerk; Hardy ; Pelly; Taylor ; St. John; MacGregor. Routes in Persia. Sec. 1, Ed. 1898. Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) AHMADI— A village in the Chah Kutah district of Ears, 9 miles east of Shif, and 25 miles from Bushire. The caravanserai is waqf or a religious bequest. A new kaleh was begun in 1909. The village is managed by the eldest son of Shaikh Husain of Chah Kutah. The approach to the Shur river, south of Ahmadi, is impassable after heavy rain, on account of the yielding mud, which strecthes for some miles, and in which a well-laden mule sinks above its knees. There are 100 tufangchis at Ahmadi. See also under Chah Kutah. — (Chick, 1910.) AHMADIEH— A principal tribe of Khuzistan, tributary to Ramuz (Ram Hormuz), and numbering one hundred adult males, inhabiting huts on the Dupal river.— (Ross.) AHMADI BAHMAI— A ub-divi ion of the Kuhgalu tribe, lassed as one of the Chehar Banicheh and located among the Pusht-i-KUh group. They occupy the moun-AHM—AHM 25 tains adjoining the Janiki Garmslr, and the Janiki Sardslr, namely north west of Behbehan and east of Ramuz. The residence of their chief is Kaleh A’ala, near the source of one of the branches of the Jarrahi. They are the most notorious robbers, and as ignorant and barbarous as any tribe in these mountains. The shedding of blood is carried to a lamentable extent among them ; the life of a man is no more valued than that of a sheep. They are treacherous and deceitful; with them no oath is binding ; and no traveller, unless protected in the strongest way, should venture to go amongst them. The Bahmal tribe was well and firmly ruled over by ’All Naki Khan and his successor Hussa’n Khan is also capable. It is sub-divided into two main divisions :— (a) Ahmadi. (b) Mahmud! (q-V.). The Ahmadi are further sub-divided as follows :— Waisi. Qambari. Shusini. Baguli. BalyabI (Bu-ul-Abi ?) Biqmi. Mulla Abbasl. ’Isavi. Ghaibl. Sa’ndat-i-Mangana Zur. Shuj a-ud-Dini. ’Ali Mihri. Malsakhti. Muhammad Musai. Yusuf! (see below). Mehdi. Mahmudi. ’Ala-ud-Dini (see below). The Ahmadi Bahmai at present number some 2,500 families, though in former times they numbered as many as 6,000 families. These, however, owing to oppression and other internal causes, little by little dispersed and settled in the Bakhtiari country. At present they could put up an armed force of about 3,000 men into the field, together with 30 or 40 sowars. The Ahmadi Bahmal are on friendly terms with the TaiyibI Garmslr, the Agha Jarl and the Bakhtiari tribes. Country .—Boundaries of land inhabited by the Ahmadi Bahmal are Kaleh-i-Baba Khan (Bulfarls), Tashan, Kuh-i-Karun, Charusak, Chehar Darreh and Barani. Their summer quarters are Likak, Tashan and Lower MumbI, and their winter quarters, Kuh-i-Safld Kuh-i-Karun and Upper Mumbl. The following forts are in their territory :—Kaleh-i-Likak inhabited by ’All Naki Khan. Kaleh-i-MumbI inhabited by Hussain Khan. Kaleh-i- Baba Khan. The genealogy of the late ’All Naki Khan Bahmal, is as follows :—’Ali Naki Khan, son of Muhammad Husain Khan, son of Khalil Khan, son of Mulla '’Ali Shir, son of Mulla Abdul Khalil, and then 2 or 3 more genera tions to Agha ’Ali, Behdarvand, Bakhtiari. ’All Naki Khan had 8 brothers, viz. :— 1. Husain Khan. 2. Muhammad Shaf! Khan. 3. Husain Quli Khan. 4. Muhammad Taki Khan Sarhang. 5. Muhammad ’Ali Khan. 6. Jalil Khan. 7. ’Ali Muhammad Khan. 8. Kubab Khan. The first two of whom assisted him in the administration of the tribe, and Husain Khan, who is a man of strong character and feared by the tribe,2g AHM—AHR succeeded as chief in 1911. Muhammad Shafi Khan is clever, but unfortu nately a heavy opium-smoker ; he lives at Likak. ’All NakI Khan, the eldest of the brothers, had a wife, the daughter of J Ali Murad Khan, Taiyibi (Garmsiri), by whom he had one son, Lutf ’Ali Khan (about 7 years old in 1909) and two daughters. The following properties, viz. Tashan (q.v.) Kai Kaus {q.v.) Dudangeh (q.v.) Kurdistan {q.v.) belong to the Bakhtiari Khans and were rented by ’Ali NakI Khan. Husain Khan Bahmai, has four wives, by whom he has 3 sons (all small, 1910) and 2 daughters. Has his headquarters at (Upper) Mumbi (4,500'), in the vicinity of which place are collected some 1,500 families of Bahmais and actually round the fort in which he lives, 40 families of ’Amalajat. The Upper -Mumbi valley contains 500 khish of unirrigated land and one water mill situated at a place called Chiri. Communications .—From Bahmai territory the main route to Ramuz goes via Jaizun and Bulfaris, that to Behbehan goes via Kai Kaus and that to the Bakhtiari country goes via Dalun. The only means of communication between Likak and Mumbi is either via the Tang-i-Laghar and the Tang-i-Daula, or the Tang-i-Maghar and the Tang-i-Daula—both tracks are extremely difficult and impassable to any thing but the very lightest loaded animals, and, even then, loads have to be man-handled twice en route. ’Ald-ud-Dmi .—The ’Ala-ud-Dlnl are technically of the same stock as the Bahmai, but consider themselves separate from them. Formerly they were numerous, and loyal supporters of the Bahmai, but, latterly, they have be come scattered and lost sight of. At present (1910) they number some 1,000 families, owing allegiance to ’AH NakI Khan, Bahmai, to whom they pay taxes as over-lord. They have the reputation of being good %hters, and can turn out 1,000 armed men on the necessity arising. Their summer quarters are Rud-i-Talkh, and their winter quarters Kuh-i- Karun. The ’Ala-ud-Dlnl are on friendly terms with the Taiyibi (Garmsiri) and the Bakhtiaris, and are subservient to the Bahmais (Ahmadi). The main routes from the country inhabited by the ’Ala-ud-Dlnl to Behbehan go via Tashan, and to Ramuz via Likak. Yusufi .—The YusufI are a sub-tribe of the Ahmadi Bahmai, under the immediate leadership of Agha Mustafa Khan, consisting of 300 families, whose habitat is in the Bahmai country—capable of turning out 200 armed men. Their summer quarters are in Maur-i-Bld, and their winter quarters in Upper Mumbi. Ihe main route to Behbehan from Yusufi country passes through the Tang-i-Sarvak, while that to Ramuz passes Bulfaris.

AHRAM— Lat. 28° 52' 45' N. ; Long. 51° 17' 30' E. ; Elev. 360'. ^The chief place of the Tangistan Persian coast-district of Fars ; it is situated 27 miles east-south-east of Bushire town and 17 miles north-north-west ofo-z fifortu. liter of rtf ’All small, ^),in iisand iamuz dtliat either id the ) any- have is the were mbe- some they iters, ah-i- and to ■ the ilies, med ns in a the Bah- uated sst ofAHR—AHS t 27 KKvw ^tij, the capital of the adjoining district of Dashti. Ateam stands at a short distance from the right bank of the Ahram of Bahush stream, a little below its exit from the hills, and is overlooked by the Kuh-i-Kaleh Dukhtar mountain, a few miles to the north-east. From the Kuh-i-Kaleh Dukhtar the Bharami range streches south-east to the Kuh-i-Khurmuj. The town, which is not now walled, lies near the mouth of a gorge lead' ing into the hills, down which comes a broad, stony ndld ; it covers an area of nearly | a square mile and is enclosed by date groves on the north and south, and palms also partially mask its western face. On the south west side is a stone fort, the residence of the Khan of Tangistan, which has walls. 40 feet high and round towers at the four corners. The town within is crowded with mud and stone houses and contains many mat huts, but a large proportion of the houses are ruinous and uninhabited. The inhabited houses number about 250. The inhabitants may number about 500 souls and belong to the various tribes, which under the name of Tangistanis, compose the population of the surrounding district. They depend on the cultivation of wheat, barley, dates and water-melons, which are irrigated by small streams and have no industrial or commercial, resources. Communication with Bushire is, how ever, maintained by constant caravans. Animals are 20 horses, 5 mules, 40 cam-els, 200 donkeys, 70-cattle and 500 sheep and goats, and the date palms are estimated at 20,000. The grazing in the neighbourhood is excel lent. The water appears to be abundant but brackish. Stotherd says it is almost undrinkable, but adds that slightly better water can be obtained about 1| miles up the gorge mentioned above. Butcher j on the other hand, says that it is plentiful and good. Near the town are some hot, sulphurous springs which are believed by the Persians to be a very efficacious cure for all diseases. The villagers used to manufacture gun-powder from sulphur procured from these springs. The water is so warm that it is with difficul ty one can bear one’s hand in it. Fuel is very scanty except from date- trees. The camping-ground here is good. St. John says that when the Ahram river is dry, or Nearly so, from April to December, the Tang-i-Bahush, 2 miles east of Ahram, is practicable for loaded mules, but rarely so during the winter. Monteith thinks it could be made passable for guns without much labour, but the Persians have never attempted to bring artillery by this route.— {Pelly ; Monteith ; Hardy ; Jones ; Ballard ; St. John ; Ross ; Durand ; Butcher, 1888 ; Stotherd, 1893 ; —Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.—Wilson 1911.)

AHWAZ— Lat. 31° 21' 27' ; Long. 48° 45' 47' ; Elev. 220'. A considerable village on the left bank of the Karun river, situated at the head of the rapids to which it gives its name, and at the western end of a range of sand-stone hills which subside before reaching it, but re-appear at some distance on the opposite side of the river. It stands upon a somewhat high bank, 31 miles below Wais and 42 from Band-i-Qlr. The country behind it is desert. At the north end of the village, on an elevated salient of the river bank, there was until recently a large, dilapidated, rectangular Persian fort but it has now been pulled down for the sake of the materials : an Imdmzddeh is still a feature of the place. In the stream, opposite the lower end of the village, are some mills which are removed in time of flood ; and a little below these again is a bluff or rock, forming part of the bank and traversed by a gallery, which probably carried mill races in former times. Immediately below this rock is a garden on the bank belonging to the Mu’-in- ut-Tujjar. The houses number about 160, and, except a few which are of stone, are built pf sun-dried bricks. The poputation is about 4,000 souls ; most of them are Arabs of mixed tribes, but there are some Persians. The majority are engaged in agriculture, but about 60 mules are owned by them. To Ahwaz belong 17 sailing boats of 10 to 15 tons burden, besides the river steamer Shushan of 30 tons’ capacity, and her barge of 50 tons. There is also an iron barge belonging to the Mu’in-ut-Tujjar. The native boats, which can be, and are, towed up the rapids when necessary, drop down the river without the help of sails from Shalilai on the Gargar to Ahwaz in 3 days, and from Ahwaz to Muhammareh in from 4 to 6 days. Some pilgrims to Karbala adopt this means of conveyance, especially those from Shushtar and the Bakhtlarl country and a few from Isfahan. There is a ferry at Ahwaz with two small boats. Ahwaz is situated in the southern 'Arabistan district of Ahwaz ; and its revenue is divided equally between the local headman and the Shaikh of Muhammareh. Any attempt to render the Consulate buildings defensible would be worse than useless and would be a waste of money.

The one and only entrance, the main gate, is enfiladed from the windows of the adjoining house on the southern side. All water has to be brought from outside, there being no wells within the Consulate precincts. Lastly, the sauitary arrangements even at present are most inadequate for even such of the staff as are domiciled within its walls. The house is exceedingly small, old and in an unsatisfactory state of repair, and in the event of trouble could never be used as a place of refuge for the European community.— {Ranking, 1910.) There is a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Ahwaz (March 1913). In August 1912 Md. Ter Menlens’ appointment as consul for the Nether lands was abolished ; and he ceased to fly the Dutch flag over his residence. The rapids at Ahwaz are formed by 7 ledges of rock crossing the river in the direction north 85° west to south 85° east. These reefs are merely a prolongation of the Pusbt-i-Kuh across the plain. The rapids are fully described in the article on the Karun river. The country on the town side of the Karun is a bare plain, with very slight patches of cultivation here and there, and on the south-east side of the town is a range of sand stone hills, perfectly bare. A few hundred yards north of the town is a ridge, round which the river passes, rendering it a very strong position. On the occasion of the advance of a British de tachment up the Karun in pursuit of the Persian troops from Muhammareh in 1857 the Persians took up a position on this ridge, but finally did not defend it. Ahwaz occupies a portion of the site of the ancient city of Aginis, with the materials of which it is built. There was once a large and flourishing city here, as is testified by the numerous ruins in its vicinity. Of the ruins of the ancient city, the most noteworthy are an old bridge and the remains of a place, on part of the side of which the present village has been erected. In the vicinity of the ancient city, and excavated on the west side wdiere the face of the hill is abrupt, are numerous hollows, some in the form of sardabs, and probably used by the former inhabitants as such, whilst others have exactly the shape and dimensions of a coffin. Under the name of Hormuz-Ardashir, Ahwaz was in former times the capital of ’Arabistan, but it suffered greatly during the rebellion of the Zanj in the 9th century A.D., and was for a time the residence of their leader. It was partially restored by the Buyids in the 10th century, and the main town, situated on the east bank of the Karun, was then connected by a masonry bridge with a quarter which stood on an island in the river. {Curzon — Ainsworth—De Morgan—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) AIIWAZ (District)— The largest but not the most important district of Southern ’Arabistan. Position and boundaries .—Ahwaz district reaches on the west almost to the Karkheh river, meeting there the district of Havizeh. On the south it is bounded by the districts of Muhammareh and Fallahieh, on the south east by the district of Jarrahi, on the east by the district of Kamuz, on the north-east by the Bakhtlari country, and on the north by the districts of Shush tar and Dizful.m AHW—AHW Natural features and general topography .—The great plain between the Karun river and the Itamuz district, which has no general name, though parts of it are distinguished and designated, lies entirely in the Ahwaz district, of which it form; about half. This plain is generally grassy, and in favourable years it is sprinkled with patches of wheat cultivation. After rain it becomes swampy, and in some seasons the mosquitoes are very troublesome. The Gupal stream enters the plain at its eastern end and forms a marsh at Shakheh towards its centre. The principal hills are those of Ahwaz and Bunneh. A considerable strip of country parallel to the Karun river on its east side, is drained by the Malih hollow, which begins near Ahwaz and ends near Gharaibeh in the Fallahieh district. A ridge of higher country divides the marshes, formed by the Malih in its lower course from the overflow southwards towards the Jarrahi of the surplus waters of the Gupal stream. The main feature, however, of the Ahwaz district is the Karun river bisecting it. The part of the district to the west of the Karun is still, except for information from native sources virtually a terra incognita.

Villages and 'populations .—The fixed villages of the district are almost without exception, situated on the Karun, the largest being Nasiri Muzaffari, Ahwaz, Braicheh and Wais, and the settled population of the district, including, besides the Karun village, the large semi-permanent settlements of Banneh and Shakheh, may be estimated at 13,000 soills. The sedentary population consists chiefly of Bavleh, A1 Bu Kurd, Dizfulis, Shushtaris and Ma’awleh ; but among them are Hamaid, Zarqan, Hawa- shim and Muhaisin, and a very few Tkrish and Sabians., The Ka’b of Banneh and Shakheh are here reckoned among the fixed inhabitants of the district, and there is a proportion of miscellaneous Arabs and Persians. The mud brick used in domestic architecture is of the same pattern as in the Jarrahi district. The nomad population is very much larger, amounting ito about 37,930 souls, and includes the bulk of the Bavleh and ’Anafijeh tribes. Besides these there are Faratiseh, Hamaid, Hardan, Hawashim, JaEtia’, Ka’b, Mara- wuneh, Muhaisin, A1 Bu Rawaleh, Bait Sad, Salamat, jShawakir, Bani Tamim and Zarqan. Of these the Hamaid, Hardan and Salamat are chiefly found on the outskirts of the district. . The following is a tabular account of the principal among the minor tribes which have their headquarters in, or are peculiar to, this district. o [ fo ; t Nam a Location. Fighting strength. Remarks.

Shawakir . , Shavveh . 50, of whom 10 are mount ed and 20 x have rifles. Remarks. They are politically con nected with the Bavieh, but pay revenue at Kut-ash- Shaikh to the Sam- sam-ud-Dauleh, II- Khani of the Bakhti- ari. They draw their fresh water at Hilweh. Their livestock are 100 camels, 200 cattle and 2,000 sheep and , goats. At one time subordi nate to the Bavieh but now recognised as a separate tribe. This tribe pay half of their revenue through the ’Anafijeh and the other half direct to the Shaikh of Muhammareh’s Deputy Governor at Nasiri. They own 100 camels, 400 cattle and 5,000 sheep and goats. The position cf the A1 Bu Rawayeh in re venue matter is the same as that of the Marawuneh. Their livestock are 100 camels, 200 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. They bear an evil reputation as thieves and robbers. They are subjects of the Shurafa of the Hawi- zeh District, but their revenue is paid through the Shaikh of the Bavieh with whom they are poli tically allied. They have 20 camels, 60 cattle and 800 sheep and goats.AHW—AIF 37 Apart from the Hawashim and Ma’awieh, all of whom are settled, and from 20 families of the A1 Bu Rawaieh in the Dizful district, these minor tribes appear to be entirely nomadic, and to represent a Bedouin popu lation of about 2,250 souls. They all cultivate wheat and barley, and 'some of the Hawashim are weavers. Agriculture, trade, and communications. —These subjects are dealt with in the general article on Arabistan, but here it may be noted that there is an old disused canal leaving the Karun at Ahwaz village, which runs southwards for 30 miles and is lost in the marshes on the right bank of the Jarrahi riv6t west of Gharaibeh. On the western side of the Karun, a canal, it is said formerly took off at Maqtu’ and run to Hawizeh. The principal route is that from AhwaZ to Ramuz town, the length of which is 60 miles. It is joined by a route from Wais, at about 30 miles from Ahwaz, passes Shakheh at 26 miles, crosses the Gupal river at 32 miles and enters the district of Ramuz at 39 miles. Administration. —The district is subject to the Shaikh of Muhammareh who manages it through a Deputy Governor, with head-quarters at Nasiri. The Deputy Governor only acts on orders from the Shaikh and has little real power outside the village in which he resides. The Shaikh of Muham mareh is also represented in the district by various political agents. These agents usually deal with their master direct and not through his represen tative at Nasiri, but there is no fixed rule in the matter. The Shaikh of Muhammareh maintains police posts on the Karun in this district at Kut- un'-Naddafieh Saghir (10 rifles), at Milaihan (20 rifles, of whom 10 are mounted), and at Qajarieh (60 rifles, of whom 50 are mounted). For ad ministrative purposes the Ahwaz district is divided roughly into two tracts, that of Bavleh on the west and that of Karun upon the river. So much of the district as lies west of the Karun is claimed by the Nizam-us-Sultaneh as his property, and it is understood that the Shaikh of Muhammareh pays him 3,000 tumdns a year on account of the tract, but does not admit the Validity of the title. It has been suggested that Ahwaz is derived from Ahwaz, the plural of the word Hftz, common in Southern ’Arabistan in the sense of a cultivated a'ea or estate. The conjecture is plausible and furnishes an explanation at the same time of the origin of the name Hawizeh and possibly even of that of Khuzistam— the old name of ’Arabistan— which may have been originally Huzistan. Another derivation of Ahwaz is given in Curzon’s Persia, Vol ume II, 351 (footnote) : see also Le Strange, page 232.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

The inhabitants, all Mussulmans, still speak Georgian. They live in a valley about 1 mile broad, at an eleva tion of 8,440 feet for Akhureh-i-Bala and 8,140 feet for Akhureh-i-Paln. The valley is clear of snow for 7 months, but for 5 months, from November to March, the snow lies so deep that the villagers have to keep to their houses ; the flocks are housed in underground chambers. Provision for man and beast for the 5 months of winter are laid in during the open weather. In June the pasture is said to be abundant. These villages contain about 350 houses and 1,500 to 2,000 inhabitants. Provisions scarce ; sheep numerous ; corn scarce ; donkeys abound, every village having 50 or 60. The popular etymology of the name is Ab-Khuran, “ given to drink, irri gating, ” because the rivers, which rise in the mountains in the neighbour hood of Akhureh, water the country all around. A road leads from Akhureh to Dizful via Gartak, 6 stages.— (MacGregor — Bell — Schindler.) AKLlT, vide IQLID. ’ALA, vide JARRAHl (River). ALAF-DAN—Lat. 29° 1' N.; Long. 50° 53' E. ; Elev.

The shrine, known as the Buq’eh-i-’AK- ibn-ul-Husain is one mile from the village.—(PemVm Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) ’ALl ILAHI— A religious sect of Persia who are said to regard’All as God. Their belief would appear to be an exaggeration of Shi’ahism, of which the foundation is an excessive devotion to ’All and his descendants. The vptaries of this creed are very numerous, though chiefly confined to the genuine Persian tribes of Lak descent. They are also found among the Guran Kurds, and around the higher parts of Zagros. Rawlinson considers them to be of Jewish origin, from their features having a decided Jewish cask It is said that their religion enjoins that at certain periods they shall congregate at night in a particular spot. At these times the greatest license is said to prevail, and the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes to form part of the ceremonies prescribed by their singular creed. It is certain that a more than masonic secrecy is maintained among them in regard to the mystical rites and ceremonies connected with their religion, and that they are exceedingly jealous of curious enquiries on the subject. The ’All Ilahi, says Jones, when journeying in Muhammadan cities, outwardly conform to the cere- monies of the established faith. They also adopt the deportment and dress of their Muhammadan rulers, so as not to excite the prejudices-of the fansftic people. This probablv is not applicable to the sect in South Turkey, but in Persia. Sheil says that, though their tenets are perfectly well-known, not the slightest attempt is made to disturb their opinions, though they do not openly proclaim their dissent from the prevailing religion of the country. The ’Ali liahi in their own villages do not deny themselves the use of wine and spirits, nor do they abstain from the prohibited food of the Quran , on’ALI—AL K 51 \ ’ ALl-SHAH-MOHAMMADI— A tribe of Fars which spends the summer in the mountains of Torn and the districts of Saimakan and Tiruzabad, and the winter in Saimakan.

The Kathlr occupy both banks of the Diz river, the Bait Sa’d being, in places, interspersed with them, from the limits of the ’Anafijeh up to a point 8 or 10 miles above ’Abd-ush-Shah ; also the country in genera} between the Diz and the Karkheh rivers belongs to them. The majority are tent-dwelling nomands, but in the Dizful district they are found in the villages of ’Abd-ush-Shah, Jirqeh Saiyid Ahmad, Kaleh Bariut and Deh Nau. Some Kathir also are settled at ’Arab Hasan on the Shatait. The Kathir, unlike other Arab tribes in ’Arabistan, not only take Persian wives, but are accustomed to give their daughters in marriage to Persians. AL KATHIR tribe— A powerful tribe of Arabs, tributary to the Shaikh of Muhammareh. They number some 2,500 fighting men. They occupy the Husainabad district {q.v.). They are in close touch with the K’ab Dubai Arabs, under Farhan Asad, and keep up relations with other tribes such as the Mushattat, Kasrij, Bani Lam, etc., who are independent and occupy the Turco-Persian border. They are not a true nomad tribe as they cultivate largely, and keep in order a considerable number of small canals.— {Wilson, 1910.) The following is a statement of the divisions of the tribes :— Section. Sub-section. Location. Fighting strength. Eemabks. Ka’b-ud-Dib- bai. •• Eight bank of the Shavur to the west of Shush near Qar- ieh Saiyid Tahir. 800, all with rifles, of whom 50 are mounted. This section is said to own 3,000 buffaloes, 4,000 cattle and 10,000 sheep and goats. Bait Earim . Bait Karim or Mauleh. Husainieh, a tract on the right bank of the Diz, 7 miles above ’Ajir-ub, ex tending from the Diz to the Shavur. 500, all with rifles, of whom 300 are mounted.. This sec tion takes its name from one Mauleh who is a brother of Shaikh Haidar ; the other name is generally pronounced Charim or Jarim. Livestock is 500 camels, 400 mules, a few buffaloes, 1.0)0 cattle and 20,000 sheep and goats. e 252 ALK—ALK ' Section. Sub-section. Location. Bighting strength. Remarks Bait Karim . Ma’allch Husainieh, a tract on the right bank of the Diz, 7 miles above ’Ajir-ub, ex tending from the Diz to the Shavur. 50, all with rifles, of whom 30 are mounted. The ruling family of the Kathir in old times were of this section. They pos sess 30 camels, 140 mules, 100 cattle and 1,500 sheep and goats. Ditto Mahmud Right bank of the Diz 7 miles above Kut’Abd-ush-Shnh 100, all mounted and armed with rifles. Called after a Shaikh whose father was paternal uncle of Shaikh Haidar. Ditto . Nasir (A1 Bu) . Husainieh 100, all with rifles, of whom 30 are mounted. The real A1 Bu Nasir were al most exterminated 100 years ago by Ghafil, grand father of Shaikh Haidar ; the section is now composed largely of outsiders who have become incorporated with it. They own 40 camels, 100' mules, 200 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. Khaltaq (mis cellaneous dependants.) Bakhaitat Left bank of the Diz between Shureh and 'Ajirub. 100, all with rifles, but none mounted. 150 buffaloes, 200 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goaG. The Bakhaitat are attached to the Daiiam sub-section below. Ditto Ditto Daiiam . Dhabbeh . Ditto Left bank of the Diz, above and close to Kut ’Abd-ush- Shah. 300, all with rifles, but none mounted. 150, all with rifles, but none mounted. 600 buffaloes, 2,000 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. They are supposed to be of the same stock as the similarly named section of the ’Anafljeh. Own 200 buffaloes, 400 cattl e and 3,000 sheep and goats. They are attached to the Daiiam sub-section above. Ditto Mahur Husainieh 100, all with rifles, of whom 60 are mounted. These are really a division of the Sarkheh of the Bani Lam, but at present they hold land under Shaikh Haidar of the Kathir, pay revenue through him and are attached to the Bait Karim. At tin es they have lived under the pro tection of Haidar’s rival Farhan Asad. They own 100 camels, 100 cattle and 400 sheep and goats. Ditto Sa’abireh j , With the Daiiam sub-section above. 100, all with rifles, but none mounted. The Sa’abireh are attached to the Daiiam sub-section above. They own (100 buffaloes, 200 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. Besides the above, or, perhaps, included in them, is said to be a section called A1 Bu Nassi, who live at Haddameh on the Diz and have 300 rifles. The whole tribe may be estimated at 700 souls, of whom perhaps not more than 1,000 have a fixed residence. The senior member of the Ma’alleh section formerly commanded the obedience of the whole tribe ; but at the present time, two rival Shaikhs divide the Kathir between them. Shaikh karhan Asad is followed by the Bait Karim sub-section and part of the Daiiam sub-section, and has his headquarters at Deh Nau ; the village of Kaleh Banut also belongs to his party. The remainder and great majority of the Kathir on the Upper Diz obey Shaikh Haidar to whom Kaleh Abd-ush-Shah belongs. Both Chiefs are recognised by the Persian Govern-/ AL K—ALL 53 ment, and the control of the country and tribesmen, and the collection of revenue are’left entirely in their hands. The total annual revenue demanded from the two is said to be 4,725 tumdns. The relations of Shaikh Farhan Asad are with the Persian officials at Shushtar, and those of Shaikh Haidar with the authorities at Dizful, consequently the tribe may be regarded as divided between the two districts of Northern ’Arabistan. It is a remark-• able fact that of the Shaikhs—who are distantly related to each other— neither really belongs to the Kathir tribe, but both are of Bait bad extraction .—(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) AL KHAMlS— An Arab tribe of Southern ’Arabistan inhabiting the districts of Ramuz and Fallahleh. About 1840 they migrated to the country between Hawlzeh and the Karun but they have since returned to their own country They are said to be connected with the Ma’adan tribe, who are located chiefly on the banks of the Tigris, though some are found on the Largar.

The former boundary of the ’Anafijeh tribe ran along the right bank of the Shatait river from its confluence with the river Diz, to a little above Chehar Dingeh ; thence it crossed to Kut Bandar on the river Diz, and, passing by Khaira- bad on the Shavur to the left bank of the river Karkheh, followed the’ANA—’ANA 59 Karkheh to a point some 10 miles above Nahr Hashim ; from this point it ran to Khar Ishtireh opposite Ahwaz, and then kept along the right bank of the Karun to the mouth of the river Diz. The ’Anafijeh are now almost confined to the right bank of the Shatait, both banks of the Diz and the right bank of the Karun within a short radius of the junction of the rivers Shatait and Diz ; a few are found also on both banks of the Gargar. The ’Anafijeh are mostly tent-dwellers, owning a number of horses, don keys and cattle, and some sheep, but depending chiefly for their livelihood oh the cultivation of w-heat and barley. The tribe can still muster some 140 fighting men, of whom about 150 are mounted, and the majority are armed with rifles. The sections of this tribe are :— Name. Location.. Fighting strength. Remarks.

Extent and 'physical characteristics .—The length of Angall is about 15 miles from north to south, but its breadth is only 5 to 10 miles. The whole is a plain and the southern part is a barren waste. The climate m winter is cold and in summer, from June to August, a very hot wind blows in the middle of the day. Population.— people, numbering only some 2,700 souls, area mixed race, the blood of Behbeham Lurs probably predominating ; there is a small Arab infusion. The men of Angall are described as bold and hardy. They wear daggers and are well-armed with Martini rifles, nearly 400 of which are possessed in the district. All the people follow agriculturalpursuits and their dwellings are huts of sun-dried bricks and mud or of wood and matting. They are Shi’ahs by religion. Agriculture, trade and £rawspor£.—Wheat and barley are, with the ex ception of a few dates and melons, the only crops. Trade is small and of a commonplace character. It is calculated that the district possesses about 100 horses, 500 donkeys and 2,000 sheep. Communication with Bushire is by boat from Shif. The local Hashim man of Angall is gqual to 18 Tabriz mans of Bushire. Building materials, chiefly Zanzibar timber and Muham- mareh matting, are imported through Bushire. Administration .—The village of Angali are ruled by a hereditary Khan, who is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, his family are said to have been originally Nuyi Lurs who immigrated from Behbeh'an 60 or 70 years ago, but they have absorbed some Arab blood. The present holder of the Khanship is Ahmad Khan, son of ’Abbas Qull Khan, son of Hassan Quli Khan ; he is about 33 years of age, a man of good sense and pleasant man ners, and has one brother, Najaf Khan.

Elev. 1,856'. A small town in Laristan, with a small mud fort, containing about 500 people, and situated in the Bastak district, 23| miles from the town of that name on the road to Lar. It possesses about 100 acres of wheat cultivation and half a square mile of date-trees. Water is good and plentiful, from at least 24 wells, averaging in depth from 16 to 20 feet, from which water is drawn by bullocks, and from about 6 hauz. About 1| miles off are said to be about 5 water-mills, each of which grinds 100 mans of wheat daily. Wheat from Lar, Bastak and the surrounding country is brought here to be ground. The mills are worked by a warm sulphur spring, which used to* be a popular Zoroastrian resort in ancient days', and is even now resorted to for the cure of various skin diseases. The river north of the town is said to rise near Ishkanan, reported to be 10 farsakhs, two marches from here, and behind the west extremity of the Kuh-i-Gavbus. Thence the river flows alongside the road down a valley, disappearing underground about 6 miles west of Anveh, and re-appearing somewhere near the sulphur springs. Thence it flows on down a great plain past Tudiran, and rounding the northern slopes of the Khamir peak, empties itself into the sea near KhamiX There is a large but stony camping-ground to the west of the town. The grazing is good, and firewood is obtained from the hills.— {Vaughan, April 1890.) ’AQALEH— A canal in the Fallahieh district, on the right bank of the Jarrahi river, | a mile below Gharaibeh.

F66 AEA—AR,A AEABISTAN (NOETHEEN)— Northern Arabistan consists of the alluvial plains of the rivers Karun, Diz and Karkheh, immediately below the mountains. In conjunction with Southern Arabistan it is at least nominally one of the provinces of Persia, with a Governor-General appointed from Tehran over it. History.— (Including Southern Arabistan.) During 1909 and following years Arabistan was almost the only province where tranquillity reigned and this was due to the firmness and ability of Shaikh Sir Khaza 1 Khan. Thanks to his friendly attitude towards British enterprise, out trade flourished considerably, as is indicated by the fact that 78 British subjects, and 614 British Indians were reported to be in the province in 1911. A severe epidemic of plague, however, which visited Muhammareb, Basrah, and Ahwaz in 1911, discounted the results of two good harvests and even attacked the European colony of Ahwaz. In 1912, there was some trouble regarding Shushtar between the Shaikh of Muhammareh and the Bakhtiaris, and the former occupies the town with his Arabs in April 1911 ; but withdrew oma neutral governor being appointed from Tehran. Boundaries. -Northern ’Arabistan is contiguous on the south with k^outhern^ Arabistan. The eastern boundary runs from 5 miles north of Band-i-Qir on the right bank of Abi-i-Gargar to BulaitI, and thence crossing to the left bank, extends to a point some 7 miles to the east of Shushtar. e northern boundary runs_along the foot of the mountains, including with- m it the plains of Aqili and Ab-i-Bid across the Ab-i-Diz to Mazraeh-i-Salih- abad, 10 miles north-west to Dizful, and thence through Paj-i-Pul on the Karkheh to an undefined place near the Dawarij stream, on the undemarcat ed lurko-Persian frontier. This frontier bounds Northern ’Arabistan on the west. Geography.—The country is flat and alluvial and lies entirely outside the mountain system. It has, however, a few small ranges of hills across it. A range extending for about 60 miles in a north-westerly direction runs from the right bank of the Karkheh above Nahr Hashim to the left bank of the Dawarij Another range runs from the south-east corner of the plain of Aqih, along the right bank of the Karun and Ab-i-Shatait, to a point a tew miles south-west of Sliushtar. On the left bank of the Karun a red sandstone range, known as the Kuh-i-Fadalak (1,200 feet) runs facing the last from the point just below the Shur-i-Labahri to within 2 miles of Shush- tar A short, rocky ridge finally crosses the Ab-i-Diz obliquely at Kut Danciar. 1 he only permanent rivers are the Ab-i-Gargar and Shatait, Karkheh ° ^b-i-Diz, wuth its tributaries ; and the Climate. Rainfall.—Rum may occur any time at intervals between the end q u C n + T an rm^ rare ly in May, and never between that month and October, there is seldom continuous rain except from the end of November to end of January, when three days at a time may be expected once or twice every year. The ramfall in Dizful and the tract along the foot of the hills is greater , an ia a | ^ iwaz. One day’s rain will make the movement of troops over the plain very difficult. From the end of May to the middle/ ARA—ARA 6t of October tbe excessive beat and the absence of shelter render marching in the plains very trying for troops.— (Official, 1907.) In February rain in scarce, in March and April heavy thunder showers occur, but of a local character. The desert near Muhammareh, being a sort of clay, becomes difficult to traverse after a day’s heavy rain. Farther up, where there is an admixture of sand, it soon dries. Winds .—During the summer the prevailing wind is north-west, dry and fairly cool in June, but later is a hot wind ; and where it comes off a sandy desert, as is the case along the Karun after roughly the first 50 miles from Muhammareh, the dust carried by it is very trying to the exposed parts of the body. Heat. Nights near Muhammareh are seldom oppressive near the Karan river, the water of which is fairly cool, being 8° less than that of the Shatt- al-’Arab. At Ahwaz the nights during the hot weather are, as a rule, cooler than at Muhammareh, and the climate there is dryer ; but owing to there being no trees in the neighbourhood it is exposed to the full force o± the hot winds during the day. After the beginning of September it is sometimes damp and the heat is no longer excessive. Cold. There is usually frost in the mornings between 27th January and 4th February and in some years in December or early January. During wet weather fever and dysentery often attack natives.—(Mc- Douall, 1907.) People —The inhabitants of Northern Arabistan are of a mixed type. The most important of the Arab tribes is the A1 Kathir,'at present divided into two factions : one occupying both banks of the Ab-i-Diz above the country of the Anafijeh, and thence westwards as far as Ajairib ; while the other is located farther west towards the Karkheh. The powerful Bait-Sa’d also dwell upon both banks of the Ab-i-Diz, while higher up the Karkheh m the neighbourhood of Shush is found the Surkha tribe. To the west of the Kar kheh and still within Persian territory are the numerous Bam Turut. Ihe Mian-ab, the country between the Ab-i-Shatait and Ab-i-Gargar also con tains some miscellaneous tribes of Arab extraction. _ The inhabitants of Dizful and Shushtar are of mixed and somewhat mysterious origin. They are considered to be of Assyrian descent with a large and now preponderat ing admixture of Persian blood. Other inhabitants of Northern Arabistan are Lurs and Bakhtiari. The former, who are wholly nomadic, come down from their native mountain fastnesses at certain seasons of the year. Oi these the Sagwand at the present time (1906) are most m evidence ; the other two remaining powerful divisions, the Biranawand and Dirakwand beino- more or less at open warfare with the Persian Government. Ihe Bakhtiari may also be considered nomadic, for although Khan own most of the land to the north between Shushtar and Dizful, they merely visit the district to collect their revenues and to administer their property. I lie Arab tribes are all nomadic, except those settled in the Mian-a b , and they as well as the nomads of other races are avowedly predatory. Hie town population is quarrelsome, and disturbances are especially frequent in Shushtar. The language of the country is formed from the various68 ARA—AHA dialects of Arabic and Luri, besides the 'patois of Dizful and Shushtar. The weapons in use are rifles or carbines of Martini pattern, and long heavy sticks used alike by Arabs and Lurs who cannot afford to buy rifles. Rifles are still (1906) scarce among the Bakhtiari, and there are not many in the Mlan-ab ; but the townspeople of Shushtar possess several hun dreds. Small depots of arms are maintained in the Arabistan, Tangistan and Dashti ports. The owners of these depots reside in Bushire, and purchase arms arranged through dalals or agents, who settle the price to be paid and either pay down, or give security to the owners in Bushire. The delivery of the aims, is, however, taken over at the depots. The dalals then pass on the rifles to their clients among the tribesmen. A demurrage charge of 3 tumans per rifle is levied by the headman of most of the ports, where rifle depots are maintained, as well as a percentage of 1 per cent of the rifles. A further transit cl arge of 1 tuman per rifle is levied by the chief of the district traversed, when taking the rifles up country. This makes a total charge in transit dues of about Rs. 12 per rifle. Most of the arms-dealers in Bushire work in syndicates, sharing profits and losses at sea, thus lessening the losses from captures and jettisonings. Swords and daggers are scarce. Population. —No attempt is made to estimate the number of the population. Produce, trade and resources. —Northern ’Arabistan is divided into two revenue districts with headquarters at Shushtar and Dizful; the boundary between the two is a line passing between Pavindeh and Kunak in the north through a point east of Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah in the south. For details of products and trade, vide this Gazetteer, Shushtar, Dizful and Muhammareh. The neighbourhood of Dizful being recognized as one of the chief centres of mule produce in Persia, its importance in this regard must not be over looked. Major Arbuthnot in his report on the “Mule-producing districts of Persia II, Dizful and Shushtar ” writes thus (1905) :— “Judging by expert reports on two samples of cotton grown near Shushtar, there is a possibility of growing a fairly good grade of cotton in the northern parts of Arabistan (1910). “ Mule breeding and supply, {a) Shushtar.—Time is no market for mules in the town of Shushtar itself, neither can it be said to be a ‘district’ from which such a supply is obtainable. There are a limited number of mules in use for cultivation and such purposes, while an equally limited number of small caravans reach there from Isfahan and Dizful. “ (6) Bakhtidri llidts. —Coming to Shushtar from the east on the last few stages of the Bakhtiari route, the encampments of the llidts (tent-dwellers) of those tribes in their black goat-hair tents are met with, but amongst their grazing herds and young stock, a mule foal is a rara avis. To tap any supply such as they may and do possess to a limited extent, it would only be possible to reach them when they come up towards the Chehar Mahal in the summer months. I would fix a limit of purchase of animals from this source between 18 months and 3f years at 300 head. Very few, if any, animals over this age could be obtained from them. (c) Dizful. Dizful itself contains a certain number of working mules of 3| 3 7 ears and upwards for purposes of cutivation, as well as a very limited i umber for transport work. A further small supply is probably obtainableABA—ARA 69 from the Arab tribes from the neighbourhood of Shush (Susa), to the west of the Ab-i-Diz. The head of these is the Shaikh Mushattat, while a Lur chief, named Karim Khan, who owns land near to them, would be of assist ance to a purchasing officer. “ But, speaking generally , there cannot be said to be any market to working mules at Dizful, and any sudden demand from India for any number exceeding 200 could not be easily met. “ As the market for young stock, however, up to 2| years, Dizful probably holds a position of its own. The mule-breeders of Western Persia are the Lurs, of whom there are several important tribes, notably the Sag wand, Bairanawand and Dirakwand, who in turn are broken up into numerous tdifehs or divisions. It may be here noted that while all Bakhtiari are Lurs, all Lurs are not Bakhtiari. “ {d) Lur Ilidts. (i) Sagwand. —The Sagwand are the largest breeders among the Southern Lurs, and the dealings of a purchasing officer would be limited at present to them. The present head of this tribe is Fazil Khan, who is represented in the neighbourhood of Dizful by his two nephews, Khanjan Khan and Hasan Khan. These two chiefs, the former especially, are intelligent men of some business capacity and seem anxious to assist an Englishman in any possible way. The Taifeh-i-Saadat (Saiyids), one of the divisions of the Sagwand, especially devote themselves to the breeding 6f mules, and are said to own young stock to a number of over 2,000 at the commencement of their selling season, viz., December. They come down into Dizful yearly from the mountains to dispose of their stock to buyers from all parts, notably the Bakhtiari, who find their market later on in the neighbourhood of Isfahan, while the Behbehanis purchase for the Shiraz market. “ (ii) Bairnawand and Dirakwand. —With these tribes there is for the present difficulty in having any dealings ; nor is it prudent for a European to enter Luristan from the south for the time being. This state of affairs is not likely to improve in the near future, unless some energetic action is taken by the British Government in reference to the arrangements lately entered into for the opening up a road from Dizful to Kirmanshah by the new British Road Company. ” Summary of mule supply.' —I would summarize the capabilities of supply of all the districts dealt with in this report as follows :— Mules. District. years and upwards. 18 months to 2i years (a) Shushtar . . f To be taoped from the Chehar 25 Nil (6) Wkhtlan Iliat &lt; Mahal during the months June C —August. ^ Nil 300 (c) Dizful 200 ] 1,0C0 (d) Lur Iliats Nil Total 225 1,30070 ARA—’ARA The above is the limit of purchase in one season by an officer arriving in the locality not later than the 15th December and lasting till 31st March. Prices .—The prices of mules 3f years and upwards are slightly higher than those of Isfahan and its neighbourhood, presumably owing to the cheaper rates of forage in these districts. That ol a two-year old mule is from Tcrans 200 to hdns 250 less than the price asked at Isfahan for a working animal at four years of age of the same class. The average prices of a mule of 24 months would on this basis work out as follows :— Rg. Ordnance, about ......... 225 Baggage . 125 Transport 90 The cost of transport per head from Dizful to Karachi would not ex» ceed Rs. 75. The currency, weights and measures are much the same as those of South ern ’Arabistan (q.v.) ; but the Shushtar man is 15-487 lbs., and that of Dizful 16-969 lbs., both avoirdupois. The unit of distance is the \farsahh, among the Arabs often called a sa’at (hour), and is from 3| to 4| English miles. Communications .—The Persian telegraph line connects Dizful with Shushtar and thence with Ahwaz and Muhammareh. From Ahwaz a line connects with Bushire via Ramuz, Behbehan and Borazjun. Administration .—The whole province of ’Arabistan, which includes the northern and southern divisions, is nominally under a Persian Governor- General appointed from Tehran. The seat of Government is also nominally Shushtar. But of late years the Governor-Generals have spent most of their time at Dizful more especially towards the end of their pro-Consulship, by which period they have made themselves personally so unpopular as to find a residence in the more turbulent town of Shushtar one of considerable personal danger. Their chief object is to obtain the goodwill of a few power ful individuals whose assistance will enable them to collect the revenu and any further sums extorted upon which they can agree. The revenue consists, in the country, of taxes on produce, not on land ; and in the town ships on industries and shops. Taxes are imposed in each district in a lump sum which is apportioned locally. The Mustaufis, who are Accountant- Generals, as well as tax farmers, are liable to be changed every year. Other officials are a Director of Customs, a Post and Telegraph Master ; each of which exists both at Shushtar and Dizful. There is no system of Civil or Criminal Justice ; a travesty of it being administered in the towns by reli gious leaders, while in the local districts it is dispensed more equitably by the local chiefs. Outside the towns the principal factors in administration and politics are the A1 Kathir, the Sagwand and the Bakhtiari chiefs. The first two named administer the country to the south-west of Dizful and to its west and north-west respectively ; while the Bakhtiari Khans tacitly assume the administration between the Karun and Ab-i-Diz up to the foot of the mountains on the north, on their arrival in the neio-hbourhood in the early winter months. ’ARABISTAN (SOUTHERN)— Southern ’Arabistan is the alluvial district of Persia, situated at the head of the Persian Gulf and contiguous to the northern province of the same72 ’ARA—’ARA dans. The principal tribes of Southern ’Arabistan are the Muhaisin and the Chaub, who have their centres at Muhammareh and Fallahleh respectively ; and the Bavleh, who occupy a large part of the country between the Karun and the Jarrahi. Important tribes upon the Karun are the Hamaid, who occupy Nadafia on the left bank, and both banks of the Haddam stream, the Zargan, located at Kraneh on the left bank and a small tract on the - Jarrahi; the Anafijeh, whose territory extends westwards from the right bank half-way between Band-i-Qir and Ahwaz to the left bank of the Karkheh ; the Salamat in the neighbourhood of Wais ; and the Bani Tamim, who extend from the right bank near Saba westwards to the Turkish frontier, south of Hawizeh. There are several minor tribes of less importance, but who are still independent. The language of Southern ’Arabistan is a dialect of Arabic, with a certain proportion of Persian words. The fighting strength of the Southern province was calculated in 1902 to be 54,500 men, an es timate founded on tribal books. They are principally armed with a rifle . of Martini pattern, of which there are computed to be at least 15,000. Cartridges are refilled locally with native powder. Besides these rifles there are a certain number of fowling pieces. Products and trade .—The Muhammareh district produces dates, the Karun neighbourhood wheat and barley ; the Fallahieh district wheat, rice, dates and wool ; the Jarrahi and Hinclian districts rice, wheat and wool; the Hawuzeh district rice, wool and ghi. As compared with the northern province the supply of livestock is very limited. A certain number of sheep and goats are grazed in the pastoral districts about Ramuz and Hawizeh, while in the villages on the banks of the Karun a further limited number are found, as woll as buffaloes in the lower country. Mules and camels are found at Nasirleh, though scarcely sufficient to meet the demand for transport up country ; and neither are bred locally. The towns of Muhammareh and Nasirleh are the only considerable centres of trade, both internal and foreign. The imports of the province are cotton goods, twist, drugs, spices, tea, indigo, rice, and metal goods from India ; cotton and metal goods from the United Kingdom ; kerosine oil from Russia ; matches and iron from Sweden ; sugar from Belgium, France, Austria and BIgypt. Exports are dates, wool, cotton and wffieat to India and the United Kingdom. The grain traffic, which is much hampered by arbitrary embargo on export, is chiefly the produce of the northern province, the output of the southern district being very small in comparison to what it has been or could be made, with proper use of the Karun w^ater for irrigation purposes. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited (capital £2,000,000), the suc cessors of Messrs. D’Arcy and Concessions Syndicate, Limited, have com pleted (1912) a pipe line (total length 130 miles) to convey oil from the fields at Maidan-i-Naftun to Abbadan Island on the Shatt-al’Arab, at which latter place an oil refinery has been constructed under a concession obtained from the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The estimated cost of the pipe line w 7 as about £400,000. The company pays a subsidy to the Bakh- tiari Chiefs for the protection of the oil fields and pipe line. In view of the prominence given in recent years to the loss to British trade, owing to the disturbed state of the route from Bushire via Shiraz to Isfahan and Central Persia, it is not without interest to compare the customs statis-} ARA—’ARA 73 tics of the imports via Bushire and the ports of ’Arabistan (to which a great deal of the Bushire trade has lately been deflected) for the last five years. The figures have been converted at the rate of 50 krans to the 11. :— — 1906-07. 1907-08. 1908-09. 1909-10. 1910-11. Bushire Arabistan . . £ 863,842 286,624 £ 1,052,043 284,747 £ 793,465 261,859 £ 717,091 300,000* £ 675,614 537,079t Total 1,150,466 1,336,790 1,055,324 1,017,091 1,212,693 It will thus be seen that while the Bushire imports have steadily declined during the last three years, the ’Arabistan figures have increased sufficiently to render the total fairly stable. The currency is that of Persia, with the silver krdn as a basis, and nickel and copper coins of smaller values. The krdn has a fluctuating value be tween annas 4 and annas 4|, the coin chiefly in circulation being a piece of hrdns 2. Besides the 1 and 2 krdn pieces there are a limited number of silver 5 krdn pieces in use. The nickel coins are pieces of the value of 1 and 2 shdhis, respectively ; 20 shdhis going to 1 krdn. Copper pieces are called 'pul-i-sidh, which are subject to great fluctuations in value ; though the unit of these coins may be taken to be worth 2 shdhis. The tumdn is an ima ginary unit, though of the fixed value of krdns 10. Besides these the Turkish lira, a gold piece of a fluctuating value of about Rs. 14, and the Indian rupee have no difficulty in finding a market of exchange. The only fixed weight is the misqdl, which is used as a standard for comparing different weights ; 100 misqdls are equal to 1 lb. avoirdupois. The commonest weight in use is the man, which is extremely variable. Those that come under notice in the province are— ■ . Man-i-Bazar (Muhammareti ) =148 lbs. avoirdupois. Man-i-Sif ( do ) =160 lbs. do. Man-i-Basrah ( do. ) =168 lbs. do. Man-i-81iushtar (Nasirieh ) = 15*4871bs. do. Man-i-Ismd’ilieh ( do. ) =392 lbs. do. Man-i-Shdh ( do. ) =13-25 lbs. do. Man-i-Tabrlz (Imperial Customs) =6’675 lbs. do. Besides these, Dizful, Fallahieh, Hawizeh and Ramuz each have their local man. Each man is uniformly divided into 8 charaks. Grain is nominally sold by the kharwdr, which contains 50 Shah or 100 Tabriz man. The unit of linear measure is the zar, which is as nearly as possible 41 inches. The unit of square measurement is the jarlb, which has a superficial area of about-2| acres, though n practice it is somewhat variable. Climatic conditions.—See ’Arabistan (Northern). Communications. —The Persian telegraph line connects Muhammareh with Ahwaz and that place with Shushtar ; while a line runs from Ahwaz * Exclusive of Analo-Persian Oil Company’s machinery, etc. t Exclusive of Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s machinery of 67,144J.74 ’ARA—ARA to Ramuz and thence to Behbehan and Borazjun, where the Indo-European Telegraph Company’s line connects with Bushire. Communication by telegram is, however, most uncertain, as the line is interrupted for long periods at a time. Administration. —Southern ’ Arabistan is nominally under the Persian Gov ernor-General of Arabistan ; though in practice the Muhaisin Shaikh of Mu- hammareh, in 1906, the Sardar Arfa ’Khazaal Mu’iz-us-Saltaneh, who bears the further titles of Governor of the Shatt-al-’Arab and Karun and Sarhad- dar, or Warden of the Marches, is almost independent of the Governor. In all provincial matters, which include those of revenue and the settlement of provincial accounts, the Shaikh is under the Governor ; but he holds his appointment direct from the Shah and cannot be summoned to his presence by the Governor. For administrative purposes the southern province is divided into the districts of Shatt-al-’Arab, Ahwaz and those of Fallahleh, Jarrahi, Ma’shur and Hindian. The last named are under tribal chieftains who are responsible to the Shaikh for their good Government. Amongst the ’Arab tribes the title of Shaikh is officially reserved for the Sardar Arfa’, while their headmen are called Khillait, and are appointed by the Shaikh. The whole force of tribal levies is at the disposal of the Shaikh ; besides which he possesses a mercenary corp of Makrans and ’Arabs, called Baluch-i-Shah, who are about 400 strong and furnish guards for Muhammareh, the Imperial Customs and personal guards. A force of ghuldms, a sort of militia, consist ing of villagers on whom the Shaikh maintains a special call, are also at his disposal. The chief officer in the town of Muhammareh is the Naib-ul- Hukumeh, who is practically head of the police. In most matters, however, the Government of the Shaikh is personal and extremely stringent. The only department of the administration which are outside the Shaikh’s con trol are those of the Imperial Customs and Telegraphs. On personally favourable terms the Shaikh co-operates with the former, wdiich, without his assistance, would be helpless. This department, as in other parts of Persia, is worked by officers of Belgian nationality ; and they also manage the post offices and are in charge of the local treasuries. The only Im perial official outside the Customs and Telegraphs is the Karguzar, or representative of the Persian Foreign Office, who has dealings with Foreign Consuls and with foreign subjects whose countries may be without consular representation. At Muhammareh there is a British Consul belonging to the Indian Political Service ; and at Ahwaz the British Vice-Consul who is a member of the same service is concerned chiefly with the affairs of Northern ’Arabistan. The only three concessions in favour of foreigners in Arabistan, except a concession for archaeological research enjoyed by France, are held by British subjects ; they are for roads to the north through the Bakhtiari country and Western Luristan, and for a steamer service on the Karun enjoyed by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. The first and third of these extend to Northern ’Arabistan, and the second is outside the limits of Southern ’Arabistan. Messrs. Lynch Brothers are the leading European firm in the Province.— (Rawlinson—Bell —Foreign Department Gazetteer, IWS—Arbuthnot—lWS—McDouall— 1907.)

The town is situated in a narrow valley at the foot of the Kfdi Guar and contains about 500 houses. A fine stream runs through the centre of the valley, the waters of which come from the Tang-i-Sardab above it. There are houses on both sides of the stream, but principally on the left bank. The town contains a bazar of 30 or 40 shops, and the houses, which are built prin cipally of wood with large projecting eaves, are well-constructed and com modious. There are numerous walnut, willow and other trees about, and also extensive cultivation. Supplies of all sorts are plentiful, including sheep, flour, barley, fruit, forage, water and firewood. The town contains 11 masjids and 4 maktabkhdnehs or schools. Ardakan belongs to the Governor of Ears, and the Governor of the town is (1891) Haji Baba Khan. The town is a centre of routes. The hill behind the village is celebrated for a soft earth used as hair-wash or soap, called gilakan or gil-i-sarshui. The district of Ardakan includes, besides Ardakan itself, the villages of Birghan and Dalln. Another account says that the district is dvided into 5 mahallas or parishes. There are 3 small tribes of Ilidts belonging to the district— the Khafri, Rais and Bakar who muster 60 to 70, 30 and 15 families respectively, and speak a Lur dialect. Population estimated at 5,000.

The village has a population of 400 in its fullest season, which is much reduced in the winter months, when the snow lies deeply on the plateau. Supplies are very limited at all seasons, as is also the water-supply. The kaleh of Ghulam Husain Khan, the Shahab-us- Saltaneh and Ilbegi of the Bakhtiari, is an imposing building adjoining the village. A suite of rooms in the kaleh is designed and furnished in the European style.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.)ARDEHSHTr!— # A section of the Lur tribe of Chehar Banlcheh, a small group of Illdts, who inhabit the Bunrud, at the sources of the Kara Aghach in the mountains west of Shiraz in Ears.— {Ross).

The ruins, which consist of the remains of stone and brick buildings, are scattered along the lofty banks of the river, mostly on the left shore, but also on the declivities of the bank, and partly along a narrow strip of land which separates the bed of the stream from its south embankment. The houses appear to have been but of one storey with vaulted roofs. Both sides of the town were united by two bridges of magnificent dimensions, as their remains and eulogiums of ancient Arab travellers would indicate.—(7m- perial Gazetteer.)

The town is situated in a valley encircled by hills. On the north-west most extensive fruit gardens stretch away from the upper part of the town, and the bills also are cultivated to the highest degree and abundantly stored with running water. There are many water-mills, no less than 10 or 12 being turned by one stream in a course of halt a mile. The houses are of the usual type and built of mud. There are three public baths, and a good large bazar. The population numbers about 4,000 inhabi tants and the kaldntdr of the district resides here. The town furnishes excellent supplies except at such times as the district and tetvn are devas tated by locusts. The town owns 50 horses, 1,000 cows and 5,000 sheep. The cultivation includes cotton, opium, wheat, rice and barley. The defile of Arsinjan, on the road just east of the town, is 3 miles in length, and m places does not exceed 50 yards in width. The mountains on either side ascend perpendicularly to a great altitude. Were the natural strength of the pass to be aided by artificial improvements, it might be held by a very small division against a large army.— {Pottinger — Stotherd, 1893.) ’ARtFS (Tribe), vide ’IKRISH. ’ARUSIEH— Lat.

Sheep and goats are pasturednear by in summer on the adjacent hills. The pass is a narrow neck, the spur that it crosses runs north-west to south-east; to the former direction the slopes are open and accessible ; to the latter, rocky and precipitous. The approach from the north is by a stony, narrow ravine, which is only practic able for laden mules, between steep earth spurs on either hand.— {Burton.) ASADABAD— Lat. 30° 52' N.; Long. 55° 20' E.

One of the Shlbkuh ports of the Persian coast; it is situated 22 miles south east of Tahiri and 4 miles north of Naband at the north entrance point of Naband bay. The village, which consists of about 200 stone houses, occupies more than | mile of the coast and has a large date grove behind it. The ship anchorage at Asalu is exposed to the Shamdl, but small boats find shelter by running over a reef, which fronts the place, and anchoring inside. The inhabitants, whose houses number about 200, are Sunnis and be’ong to the Harami or A1 Haram tribe ; they profess to be a division of the Gha- zieh (?) ’Arab tribe who immigrated from the neighbourhood of Makkah, five or six generations ago. They own four sambuqs and a score of fishing baqdrehs in which they go pearl-diving on the banks near Naband ; they also fish, especially on a ground in Naband bay off Bid Khun village, and culti vate grain and dates. ’Asalu was the residence of Shaikh Ahmad-bin-Saif, the A1 Haram Shaikh, who till his death in 1906 ruled over the villages of Bid Khun, Halat Naband, Naband Tibin and ’Amarieh and Barku, in subordination to the Khan of Dashti by whom they were held in farm ; in 1906, however, the group was brought directly under the authority of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and the connection of the Dashti Khan with them was terminated.

To the west of this spit runs the river Riz at the foot of a cliff, 36 feet high. Ross says that it is difficult to cross here in winter. The hamlet contains 60 to 70 mat houses and about 200 inhabitants, who cultivate some grain and dates. The supplies obtain able are insignificant, with, the exception of fuel of which a fair amount is furnished by the kunar bushes growing in the neighbourhood. A good and plentiful supply of water is obtained from the river Riz and from a well 36 feet deep. There is very good grazing here, and a good camping-ground. There are, by native reports, the two following alternative routes from Baghan to Darvishi, via the river Riz valley, between the ranges Kuh-i-Ka on the south, and Kuh-i-Kantareh on the north-side :— (1) Initial bearing of the road from Baghan to the village of Kantareh slightly north of north-west, and thence to Darvishi.

A large village of 300 houses, on the right bank of the Zindeh Rud, 25 miles from Julfa (Isfahan) on the Shushtar road. The Zindeh Rud is now crossed by a raft between this village and Malikabad on the left bank since the bridge at Challa, Pul-i-Kaleh, has been carried away (in spring 1884). To cross the river ( 20 th May), here 150 to 20(Xfeet wide, and 6 to 10 feet deep, with a rapid current, it was necessary to pass upstream about a mile and cross on a raft manoeuvred by two ropes and five men on each side of the stream. The volume of water is greater here than at Isfahan, much being taken off downstream in irrigation. It took an hour to make six trips with a raft, and three-quarters of an hour to swim 10 animals over. During the early spring the river is 600 or 700 yards wide and 10 to 15 feet deep. The Pul-i-Zaman Khan is 20 to 25 miles distant to the west. On the left bank barren, rocky hills, 100 feet high, border the river ; on the right the banks are low, 3 feet above level of the water (20th May). Sandy, well-cultivated and irrigated ; poppies, corn and rice grow luxuriant ly. The valley is under a mile broad. The river water is cool and pleasant to drink, but requires filtering. The village is taxed to the extent of 1,700 tumdns yearly. The headman stated that not only his own village but all in his district were ruined by excessive taxation and the dry season of 1883. Snow rarely falls here. Rice crops ripen in November. The villages about contain many pigeon towers.— (Bell — Schindler.)

It rises abruptly from the level plain and lies roughly between Jabal Turunjah on the north, and Jabal Ha mar on the south.— (Vaughan, 1890.) BAHMANSHlR, or BAHR-UL-MASHffi— The name given to the channel, which leaves the left bank of the Karim, 2 miles above Muhammareh, and forms the eastern boundary of ’Abbadan island from that point to the sea. It should be, however, mentioned that the name Bahmanshir is locally applied to the last reach of the Karun, called, and perhaps wrongly, by Europeans “ Haffar ” (vide this Gazetteer— Karun and Hafiar). The Bahmanshir has among the natives no general name, but is described by various local terms in its different reaches, such as Shatt Silaikh and Shatt Tura, taken from the villages on its banks. The total length of the “ Bahmanshir ” as accepted by us, is 54 miles by its winding course and 40 in a straight line ; its mouth in the Persian Gulf is about 10 miles east of the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab. There are two remarkable bends rather below the middle of its course. The breadth of the river varies from 300 yards in the upper reaches to 600 yards, and even ^ a mile, as it approaches the sea. Towards the middle of the nineteenth century it carried about two-fifths of the water of the Karun, and its depth at low water was nowhere less than 9 feet ; but by 1890 the uppermost 15 miles of its course had become obstructed by banks which in places dried almost across the channel at low water, and the R. I. M. S. Comet, drawing only 3 feet, grounded twice in making the passage : the 30 miles of the river nearest to the sea, however, then continued navigable for vessels of not more than 7 feet draft. Native sea-boats cannot now pass the shoals of the Upper Bahmanshir without assistance from the tide. The rise and fall of the tide, which is felt throughout the whole length of the “ Bahmanshir, ” is about 9 feet. The channel between the mouth of the river and the open sea is called Khur Bahmanshir ; at its northern end it had, in 1890, 15 feet at low water diminishing to 12 , 10 and finaly to 8 feet on the bar, which is of soft mud and 10 miles distant from the river mouth ; the river was then accessible, at low water, to craft drawing not more than 7 feet. From the Karun the banks are lined with villages and date planta tions to within about 10 miles of the sea ; low grassy plains follow the banks for some distance remaining firm and steep ; finally the stream enters a region of shelving mud-flats, covered, above the waterline, with coarse grass and reeds. When there was a steamer service with Kuwait, and Muham mareh was the port of call for that place, native sailing boats frequently made use of the Bahmanshir channel in order to escape Turkish interference on the Shatt-al-’Arab. Islands are easily formed in the Bahmanshir by staking the steam and so causing a deposit of silt, and this is frequently done. The new island is at first used for pasturage and ultimately brought under cultivation .—(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)96 BAH—BAH BAHNRAVAN— Lat. 33° IT N. ; Long. 46° 14' E. ; Elev.

BAIR AN WAND One of the sub-divisions of the Balagiriweh clans of the Pish Kuh section of Lurs. The tribe occupy about 5,000 houses and maintain 3,000 sowars. (Wilson in 1911 reported the tribe as well armed and numbering about 10,000 families.) The revenue paid by them is 9,000 tumdns. The chiefs were Lutf’Ali Khan and ’Abbas Quli Kban. The name of a section of this tribe is Haru. Order is maintained in this country by a force of about 100 sowars. These people are in very great distress on account of the tyranny of their rulers. —{Yusuf Sharif, 1889.) See also article on Luristan (tribal divisions). Wilson (1913) further notes on the tribe— This tribe, with whom, for some purposes, are allied the Ali Khani Sagwand, have their winter quarters in Pusht- i-Kuh, and spend the summer near Burujird. By far the greater part of the brigandage that has devastated the settled districts of ’Iraq and Malayir during the past few years has been due to them. It was with them that Amir Mufakhan had to fight in 1911 before he could reach Khurramabad, and though he had more than 3,000 men with him it was more by good luck than good management that he did not suffer a severe defeat. A strong Governor General at Burujird with a force of 1,000 men, or even less, if under European leaders, whilst unable to enter the hills of the Pairanwand and punish them as they deserve could nevertheless keep them in check and put a stop to all raiding northwards or in the neighbour hood of Burujird.BAl—BAI 99 It is only because there has been no sort of force at Burujird that the Bairanwandhave been able to extend the area of their raids so far north wards.

Geography. —They inhabit a district commonly known as the Bakhtiari country, on the eastern and south-eastern borders of Luristan ; and so merging with the latter as to make their boundaries indefinable to any very clear extent. Its boundaries on the north-west, north and north east, read in that order, are the Ab-i-Diz, the Shuturan Kuh, the district of Faridan and the Zindeh Rud, and the province of Isfahan ; on the east the Qashqai country ; on the south the district of Behbehan and the plains of ’Arabistan ; and on the west Luristan. The whole district is divided into three sections, both for geographical and revenue purposes— (i) Chehar Mahal, the extensive plateau at its northern and north-eastern boundary ; (n) Pusht-i-Kuh, the mountainous country between the Chehar Mahal and southern and western plains : (m) Those plain and other lands merging with the province of ’Arabistan. Mountains.—It is essentially a mountainous country, with its loftiest peaks rising to a height of 14,000 feet. The general run of the many ranges, which conduce to make this country one of the most rugged tracts on the face of the globe, is by almost parallel lines from north-west to south-east. Taking these in order from the south they may be arranged as follows :— (а) The Kuh-i-’Alwanl, rising to 720 feet above sea-level, and bounding the plain of Ramuz on the north. ( б ) The range of gypsum hills running from the Tul Khiat, south-east of Shushtar through Jaru, and rising to 2,000 feet above sea- level. {c) The Kuh-i-Darband and Kuh-i-Asmari ranges, rising to 3,200 feet above sea-level. (d) The Kuh-i-Mangasht, rising to 12,000 feet above sea-level. (e) The Kuh-i-Garreh and the Kuh-i-Sabz, rising to 13,000 above sea- level. (f) The Kuh-i-Rang or Jaihun, the Saldarun and the Zirreh ranges, with their loftiest peaks ranging from 14,000 feet downwards. {g) The Kuh-i-Gurganak, Chui, Jehanbin and Ahangari, varying between 12,000 and 14,000 feet above sea-level ; {h) and, finally, forming the boundary on the north with the Isfahan plateau, the Kuh-i-Rukh and Kuh-i-Badkun, rising to 9,000 feet above sea-levehBesides these more important ranges there are numerous shorter ones, which serve the more to score the surface of this country, and distort from it any semblance of order and regularity. Plateaux and Pasture lands .—This general aspect of nature’s convul sions is modified by the notable plateau of the Chehar Mahal; though this, from all its physical aspects, may be said to be merely a more elevated portion of the great central plateau of Persia, on which Isfahan is situated. Still it is included in the Bakhtiari territory, which also extends, though under somewhat undefined and contentious conditions, over the adjoining broad valley or p*lateau-land of upper Linjan as far as the right bank of the Zindeh Bud. The Chehar Mahal, thus situated at the north-eastern corner of the Bakhtiari country, is roughly 40 miles deep and 60 miles broad with an area of some 2,400 square miles, and a normal elevation above sea-level of 7,000 feet. Its boundary on the north is the range Kuh-i-Rukh, Badkun, while on the south it is shut in by the great Zirreh range ; on the east it fringes on the Qashqai country, while on the west it is enclosed by the tributaries of the Zindeh Rud and the Kuh-i-Rang. It is also cut up to some extent by some lofty and rugged mountain ridges, notably the Jehanbin range (13,000 feet) and the Kuh- i-Ahangari. The level and undulating portion is fine arable or pasture soil; though but little use is made of it except in the immediate neighbour hood of villages. It is well-watered by many streams, which are never dry and all of which drain through the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash into the tributary of the Kanin, known as the Ab-i-Behishtabad. It is, however, absolutely destitute of any trees or shrubs, though it is said that oak trees once abounded on it. The 'pasture lands of any noticeable extent, beyond the Chehar Mahal, lie to the south-west on the lowest slopes of these great mountains. The richest portions are those from the plain of Tfileh westwards to Shushtar and southwards to Ramuz. The plain of Malamir, covering an extensive area of some 150 square miles, affords good grazing, though overrun to some extent by camel-thorn. Beyond these places specially alluded to, the numberless higher valleys as well as the slopes of the mountains are capable of sustaining the considerable flocks and herds of the tribesmen from early summer well on into the autumn. Woodlands and vegetation .—In comparison with other parts of Persia this country may be said to be fairly well-timbered, but it is merely a com parative statement. While nature has evidently intended that it should abundantly supply its inhabitants with wood for fuel, which is a necessity in these lofty regions, the latter have done their best to diminish this kindly provision. It is, in fact, a question of comparatively few years, beyond which the higher regions must perforce become untenable during the winter season ; at least in those parts in which the present habitations exist. As an example, the Chehar Mahal may be taken. This plateau is absolutely bare of trees, beyond a few specimens of the oak to be found in the neigh bourhood of Deh-Kurd, while, on the authority of the Sardar (1905) Haji All Quli Khan, the whole district was at one time well-wooded. Evidence of this is adduced by the timber used in the building of the houses of Deh- Kurd, much of which is of oak and which further investigation has provedBAK—BAK 105 'liQrtei distort^ s COllVtl, ^ i tho^ irel J a i«, Isiafc i which ahi 8 coniitioi, 'janasiaiK situate s% 10 lie miles, aiJi idarj oi th 1 it i shit i iiqai coitit, ulehEihail lyandniM aid the II de or pash ite neighb ich are aw 'kashiatofti ; is,hoM said that i ihehar Hi untains. i .s to Shit ; an exters fh ovemnh j alluded % nountaiiffl the trteffl! irts of P®i nerelyac®' hat it shoii aneeeasW hthistff ears. M agthewiow iations exist, is absoM*! f in the ^ ■ (1905) Haj 1 Ivideoe p ises of 0^ hasH to have been grown in the immediate locality. The Sardar attributed the almost total disappearance of this tree to their system, not only of cutting down, but also of digging up, the roots for firewood. What has happened here is evidently likely to be realised in those parts which are still, though only lightly, wooded. The oak, of all trees, seems to grow most naturally, but is rarely seen of a height exceeding 40 feet. Other kinds are the ash, walnut, plane, elm, poplar, willow, ilex, beech, wild-rose, briar, hawthorn, maple, fig, vine, almond and hop. Of arborescent and herbaceous plants the variety is very extensive and their natural characteristics are those of a temperate climate. Of the Astragalus in particular there are many species, of which the most interesting probably are the A. Anisacanthus (gaz) and A. Heratensis (gun tragacanth). The manna tree produces long, flat, horizontal branches, which get covered with the sugary excretion. When ripe, the natives place sheets of cloth on the grounds underneath the small trees, which they beat with sticks and thus collect the gaz, or manna, on the cloths below. The gum tragacanth is collected and placed in small leather bags, in which it is exported for sale to Isfahan and other places. Rivers .—Nature as may be expected in a country of this physical formation, has been lavish in its water-supply, and that of the finest quality in so far as the highlands are concerned. It is, however, a curious fact that in the lower and pasture lands the water is, for human purposes, more or less undrinkable ; and the brackish streams considerably outnumber the sweet waters. Commencing from the northern end of the country, in which as is natural, the more important rivers have their birth, and taking them in this order from the map we find— (l) The Zindeh Bud. This river has several sources ; the principal being those from the Zardeh Kuh and the Galgushak ; the Chashmeh-i-Jaihun or Kuh-i-Bang; the Ab-i-Zarin and the Ab-i-Chaman-dar. It runs north-east through the Tang-i- Gaz, dividing Faridan, a district in the Isfahan province, from the Chehar Mahal still flowing north-east it receives from the north-west a considerable stream in the Khursang, after a course of some 50 miles and near to the Kuh-i-Mashzad. It then flows due east, till at 80 miles it alters its course almost due south and later south-east, and waters the broad valley of upper Linjan. The point where it bends north-east to leave the valley, after a course of some 160 miles, may be taken to be its limit on the border of the Bakhtiari territory ; which has never extended beyond its right bank. (For description of the river’s farther course, vide Gazetteer of Persia, Vol. II.) During this 160 miles of its course, it is crossed by four bridges— (i) Wooden bridge, only erected in spring, a few miles above Darsu- vadjan in Faridan. (ii) Pul-i-Zaman Khan, a stone bridge at 110 miles. (m) Pul-i-Bagh Badran, a wooden bridge. (iv) Pul-i-Kaleh, at the village of Madraseh at 140 miles. A masonry bridge of 8 arches in excellent condition. The river has a sluggish stream for the greater part of the year, owing to the comparatively slight drop in elevation from its rise until it disappears Pt. L I106 BAK-BAK i in the salt marsh of Gav-Khaneh, some 60 miles south-west of Isfahan. It is fordable at most seasons and at most points in its course within this district. ( 2 ) The Ab-i-Behishtabad. This river, which is reckoned to be one of the chief sources of the Karun river, represents the whole drainage of the Chehar Mahal. The several streams flowing through the plateau unite near its south-west corner, and leave it through the defile of the Tang-i- Darkash Warkash. Near the south exit of this gorge is situated the village of Behishtabad, from which it takes its name ; and 2 miles below that village it runs into the Karun, after a course (of its longest feeder) of some 75 miles. [For full description see this Gazetteer, Behishtabad (Ab-i-)]. (3) The Karun. This river, which is one of the most remarkable natural features of this region, has its origin at the north-west extremity of Bakh- tlari land, and within a very short distance of at least one of the sources of the Zindeh Bud. In its strangely zigzag and impetuous course it either traverses, or is conterminous with, nearly every portion of this territory. (For full description see this Gazetteer, “ Karun.”) (4) The Ab-i-Bazuft or Budbar. This river, the most important and voluminous tributary of the Karun, rises in close proximity to it. It runs into the Karun, 12 miles below the Pul-i-’Amarat near the hamlet of Charkeh, after a comparatively straight course north-west to south-east of gome 70 miles as the bird flies, or 120 miles along its bends. [For full description see this Gazetteer, “ Bazuft (Ab-i-).”] (5) The Ab-i-Shallar or Shimbar. This stream rises in the mountains north-west of the Kuh-i-Safid in Luristan ; and, running an almost due south course, it flows into the Karun at about its 265th miles, and at the apex of its great stretch almost due north after leaving the Pul-i-Shalu. It carries a considerable quantity of w T ater when in flood, being about 80 feet wide and 10 deep, at its junction with the Karun. [For full description see this Gazetteer, “ Shallai (Ab-i-).”] ( 6 ) The Bulawas. A considerable stream which rises in the mountain of that name, a spur or offshoot of the great Mangasht range to the south east of Kaleh-i-Tul. Two small streams run into it near ’Ala Khurshid and several others later during its course of some 60 miles. This is at first south-easterly, then easterly and later due southerly past Bamuz, until it finally empties itself into the. Jarrahi. (7) The Shur-i-Labahri or Shurab. This river, the last of any size in this country, has its origin in the hills about Jaru and the plain of Tuleh (2,000 feet), all its feeders being of brackish water. This feature becomes more fully developed as the river pursues its course in a north-west direction, the air in the vicinity becoming redolent of naphtha. It waters the fine pasture tablelands west and south-west of Shushtar, and eventually empties itself into the Karun Biver, about 8 miles north of that towm (vide this Gazetteer, “ Shurab. ”) Besides the above, there are innumerable streams and springs watering the many valleys and ravines of this fortunate country, of which mention may be made of one as typical of others. This is the Ab-i-Hillisat: this stream, which runs a tortuous course of something under 20 miles before losing itself in the Karun waters, bursts out of the foot of a great precipitousBAK—BAK 107 wall of the Kuh-i-Surkhun, immediately facing which the caravanserai of that name has been built. The water from this spring is of crystal purity and gushes out with such force as to form a fair-sized stream before it has run a course of twenty yards. Climate. —The climate of Bakhtiari land, owing to the great differences in elevation, varies exceedingly; and its inhabitants can accommodate themselves almost according to their pleasure. That of the country north and north-east of the great Garreh mountain is the climate of a temperate zone during most months of the year, though the cold experienced in mid-winter is somewhat excessive. As a general statement it may be taken that for three months the thermometer regularly registers some degrees of frost by night, and falls below zero (Fahrenheit) on occasions . while the highest shade temperature in summer is 80° Fahrenheit. It is m these regions, in a mise en scene which unites all the elements of natural grandeur—snowy crags, rugged hills, mountain meres, rushing torrents and profound ravines, that the tribesmen have their ydildq or summer quarters. South and west of this line, as far as the plain of Malamir, the climate is temperate for six months of the year, but almost unbearably hot during the summer months. Descending farther to the levels of the plains about Ramuz and Shushtar, the winter and early spring provide a climate very similar to that of the Riviera. During these months the Khans and a large proportion of the tribesmen move their tents and herds down to these pasture-lands, their qishldq or winter quarters, to escape the rigours of the climate in the highlands. The Khans themselves, with a large following, make their first camp at Malamir and later move down to Ramuz and the plain of Ab-i-Bid, 18 miles north-wesu of Shushtar. The climate during the summer months in these localities is intolerably hot ; the thermometer registering on occasions as much as 120° Fahrenheit and more in the shade; The heat and the multitude and variety of biting insects make travel ling and camp life painful in the summer in the lower part of the country. Language. —In general terms their language may be said to be Persian, but the Lurs, of whom the Bakhtiari are a section, have a dialect of their own. This is a mixture of Persian and Arabic, which is easily conceivable, owing to the considerable intermarriage with Arab women. Rawlinson says that their language is from the old Farsi, which was coeval with, but distinct from, the Pehlevi tongue in the time of the Sassanian Kings. Ethnology and History. —All Bakhtiari are Lurs, but all Lurs are not Bakhtiari. ’ Who the Lurs are and whence they came is one of the unsolved riddles of history. Fifty years ago they were described by Rawlinson as “ an unknown and interesting people.’ They appear to belong to the same ethnical group as the Kurds, their neighbours to the north ; though they consider it an insult to be confounded with them, and call them “ Leks. ” Most writers agree that they are of aboriginal, old Aryan, or Iranian stock, who preceded Arabs, Turks and Tartars in the land ; and that they have lived for centuries in their present habitat. The expression “ Lur ” is used by modern Persians as a^synonym for a rude or depradatory person, while the word Fail! meansa rebel. From the earliest days we read of this mountain country as a wild and inaccessible region, inhabited by uncouth and formidable tribes. They set at nought the authority of the Medes and Persians : they defied Alexander and provoked Antiochus. The invading Arabs found them a hard nut to crack. Between the 12 th and 14th centuries, however (1155 to 1424 A.D.) they were ruled over, from Isfahan to Shushtar, by a powerful Mussulman dynasty, known as the Fasluiah, under the title of Atabegs. Various travellers oi olden days have referred to them. In the 17th century Chardin speaks of them “ as having no settled abodes, but living in tents with their flocks and herds, of which they have an infinite number. They are governed by a Khan, who, chosen from among themselves, is set over them by the King of Persia : to whom they pay both tribute and tithes.” In 1722, when the Afghans sacked Isfahan, we hear of the Bakhtiari opposing them with 12,000 horsemen, who were, however, easily defeated by the invaders. Shortly after, the Turkish Pasha of Mosul, thinking to take advantage of the prevailing disorder, invaded the Bakhtiari country ; though successful in this, he was not able to remain in it. Nadir Shah made the same experiment, but with no great success. He tried to transfer a portion of the tribe to Khorasan, but they fought their way back again. An experiment, however, made by him in enlisting large numbers of them in his army met with great success ; as they acquitted themselves with great bravery at Herat and Kandahar. At his death in 1749, a Bakhtiari chieftain, ’All Mardan Khan, became virtually the ruler of Persia ; though only for a short time, as he was assassinated in 1751. In the early years of the 19th century the Sardar Asad, of the Haft Lang division of the tribe, defied the Persian Government and raided up to the walls of Tehran ; but later had to take refuge in the mountains near Deh-i-Diz, ultimately sur rendering to Muhammad ’All Mirza, son of Fath ’All Shah, and making his peace with the Government. Haft and Chehar Lang divisions .—When the Haft and Chehar Lang divisions of this people originated it is impossible to state authoritatively. A popular account is current among themselves that the whole tribe originally migrated from Syria under a single chieftain, one of whose descendants left upon his death two families of seven and four sons, respectively ; the struggle amongst the latter for the supremacy originated in a tribal division that has lasted ever since. Whatever is the true story, a bitter enmity has existed from early times between the two divisions. This has, happily, in the present day subsided, and, it is hoped, disap peared for good and all. The head quarters of the Haft Lang or north ern division is in the Chehar Mahal and adjoining valleys ; while Kaleh- i-Tul is the stronghold of the Chehar Lang or southern division. The latter were always the poorer and more nomadic of the two divisions; and friction constantly arose from the overlapping of their pastures and migration from the summer and winter quarters of the former through the Chehar Lang country. As matters now stand the supreme power has passed into the hands of the two leading families of the Haft Lang known as the “ Ilkhanl ” and “ Hajl Ilkhani ” families. To the more important Khans the history of the Zill-i-Sultan is perfectly y'ell known, and they judge the situation accordingly.BAK—BAK 109 The relative fighting value of the tribes of Persia has according to the best authorities changed somewhat during the. last five years. The chief Khans of the Haft Lang Bakhtlarl-Sirdar Asad, Samsam-us- Sultaneh, Sirdar-i-Ashja, Sirdar-i-Zaffar, Sirdar-i-Jang, Amir-ul-Mufakham, Amir-i-Mujahid, etc., are in some cases permanently, and m others very frequently, on the worst of terms with each other and their sons and younger Khans. This introduces an element of weakness and has led to each being surrounded by his own special following. Each of. the latter with their leader being bent solely on making the most of the situation of the moment. ^ ^ A varice is a failing of both high and low amongst the Bakhtians. The Khans of the Chehar Lang play a very insignificant role and are completely under the influence of the Haft Lang. A common danger would no doubt unite the whole tribe closer together, but the relative fighting power in comparison with the powerful southern tribes such as the Qashqai, Arabs, etc., far better armed than they used to be, has declined. , . Another feeling which one remarks amongst the more important Khans is that the Royal family may still obtain in the future a far more energetic support than they actually may have at the moment. The present Governor-General of Ispahan, Sirdar-i-Zaffar, cultivates the most intimate relations with the Zill’s sons—ignoring completely the blood feud that existed between the two families owing to Husain Quli Khan (Sirdar-i- Zafar’s father) having been assassinated by the Zill. _ The Khans.—The various ruling branches of the two divisions will be found set forth in the two appended statements of the genealogy of these Khans. Bt. I. K112 BAK—BAK They may be described generally as men of considerable natural intelligence while most of them have aspirations towards a higher level of civilization than they have hitherto attained. Several of them have travelled in Europe and India, besides having made the usual pilgrimage to Mecca ; and a few are able to converse either n French or Engl'sh. Their hospi tality is unbounded ; and some of the leading Khans have built suites of rooms suitable for the reception of European \isitors in theu Kalehs, which are a feature of the principal villages throughout the country. The government of the country is invested in the Sardar or Ilkhani, assisted by the Ilbegi and other lesser authorities. As it is generally recognized that neither the Ilkhdm nor the Haji Ilkhani famdy can carry on the administration single-handed, the custom approved both by the Bakhtiaris themselves and by the central government is to combine an llkhdni from one family with an Ilbegi from the other. The title of Sardar can only be bestowed by the Shah, and has apparently been withheld durng some periods for no very clear reasons. That of Ilkhani, which should be synonymous with the title of Sardar, has sufficed when the more official designation has been withheld. Besides these titles, the other appoint ments, which are made locally and are merely ratified by the Shah, are those of the Governors of the Chehar Mahal, Kaleh-i-Tul and Ramuz. The total assessment of the taxes payable by the Bakhtiari chiefs to the Persian Government, called Divdni, ’s 17,450 tumdns per annum. Tribesmen.—following the description of their chiefs, something slibuld be said concerning the people. . Tents in 1905 :—A rough census taken showed that there were about 36,000 tents or families of the Haft Lang ; while the Chehar Lang numbered about 11,000 tents. Of the latter figure 6,000 tents were said to-be joined to the Haft Lang, e.g., to be directly under the authority of the Sardar, while 5,000 tents were affiliated to Burujird : but that, on an emergency, the whole could be Counted upon to join the Haft Lang. Taking one tent to represent five persons, adult and otherwise, the total population arrived at is 235,000 souls. Life, religion, and habits .—The bulk of the tribesmen are very poor, and in their black tents will be found neither gold nor silver, but vessels of iron and copper. There is next to no education among them. The village Mulla acts as schoolmaster but his attainments and curriculum are equally limited. Outwardly and by descent- the Bakhtiaris are Muhammadans, but hold very little to any of the outward forms of that faith. They are, nevertheless, not without a crude and simple religion of their own; and entertain distinct notions of the existence of God and a future life. Their character presents a strange combination of dignity and license—on the one hand, they are modest, self-contained in deportment, obedient and hospitable, loyal to family and tribal ties, and generally free from £: any serious vices ; on the other hand, they are savage when excited, particularly in the pursuit of their blood- feuds ; while, partaking in some degree in the characteristic of the Lur, they are adroit and incurable thieves. Their general bearing presents a refreshing contrast to that of the urbane Persian. Smooth rascality finds no place here, but iu their character and mien is the free breathof their native hills. Alike in costume and complexion, darkness is the prevailing hue of the external man. Their hair is black, with its two long uncut tufts curled behind the ear ; black their bushy eyebrows and flashing eyes beneath ; black the beard and moustache ; black the crowning hula ; black the coat of the male ; and blue-black the indigo- dyed cloak of the female. Those of the men who are robust and muscular in appearance have a very manly bearing ; but, owing to exposure and privation, a large percentage present the very opposite aspect. Fever, assisted by dirt and neglect, has ravaged their systems ; and, as a rule, they are not long-lived. They wear loose trousers and a long, full-skirted coat, either a qabd or sirddri. Round the waist a cartridge-belt that holds the ammunition for the rifle, usually of the description of a Martini carbine, which is strung over the shoulder, while a dagger and pistol are carried in the belt. The women are tall and dark, of shapely limbs and carriage when in good health ; but they suffer, in this latter respect, more than the men. Absolutely neglected and despised by their male sex, they exist under the filthiest conditions ; old women before they are out of their teens and hags by the time they reach thirty years of age. Left to themselves and their own rude treatment, or more properly, neglect, the simplest cases lead to loss of life or of limb. The people generally are most ignorant of the simplest rudiments of hygiene ; and their chiefs, until quite recently, have not been much concerned about it. The disease, which perhaps wreaks most havoc among them, is that of the eyes. Nearly every man, woman, and child in Bakhtiari country is a sufferer in this respect. Dirt and neglect are undoubtedly the chief causes, assisted by the glare from the rocks or snow from which their headdress affords no protection. Besides this, the commonest affliction, which results in loss of sight in a large number of cases, the commonest ailments from which they suffer are ague, pneumonia, enteric, and typhus. Produce and commerce .—Pasture is their chief occupation, their flocks and herds being the principal sources of their wealth. They have engaged very little in any form of commerce, beyond the sale of their sheep until the acquisition in late years of the valuable property on the banks of the Karun and in the plains about Shushtar and Dizful. In these luxurious plains they have engaged in extensive cultivation of wheat, barley, and tobacco ; and, as their annual assessment shows, they are taking a much extended interest in agriculture as affecting commerce. Sheep and cattle .—It is difficult to make any precise statement as to the numbers of their sheep, goats, and cattle ; but it is probable that of the two former, together, there is something little far short of half a million head—while their herds of cattle are numerous. Horses .—In former days a considerable amount of horse-breeding was carried on ; and the Bakhtiari breed gained a repute that has not yet perished. Those animals in evidence at the present day, however, are of a weedy type, and, though probably admirably adapted to the country, being nimble, sure-footed, and enduring, are not now found in sufficient numbers to be serious’y considered. Mules .—While very few mules are actually bred within the limits of Bakhtiari land, the numbers to be found there, for carrying agricultural114 BAK—BAK purposes, besides young stock being grazed and trained with a view to ultimate sale, are very considerable. Major Arbuthnot, in his report on this subject (1905), estimates their numbers in the Chehar Mahal alone at 12,000 head. Those travelling through neighbouring districts would be included amongst this number 5 so that a fair estimate of the total number throughout the whole Bakhtiaii territory, of one year and upwards in age, would be 15,000 head. Of this number, 8,000 animals may be held to be fit for immediate transpcrt purposes. The neighbouring province of Luristan, where these mules are almost entirely bred, is the chief source of the mule-supply of Persia. Other animals.—X few donkeys of a very fine breed and a very limited number of camels, merely brought into the country for carrying purposes, complete the tale of live-stock in these regions. ' Coal and naphtha—It is asserted by the Khans themselves that their mountains contain coal in abundance, though nothing has been done by them to profit by this knowledge. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has completed (April 1912) a pipe line (total length 130 miles) to convey oil from the fields at Maidan-i-Naftun, some 30 miles south-east of Shushtar, to Abbadan Island at the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab. The original stipula tion was that a sum of £ 2,000 per annum should be paid to the chiefs for the protection of the oil-fields, and a further sum of £ 1,000 for the protection of the pipe line. Under present arrangements, however, £600 is retained by the company for the payment of the Bakhtiari guards at the oil-fields, whom it pays itself, and, it is believed that the guards actually cost the company some £ 8,200 over and above this sum. Communications — External .—The Bakhtiari country, as already de scribed, lies embedded between the provinces of Isfahan, Luristan, Pars, and ’ Arabistan . On the north its boundary lies some 40 miles distant from Isfahan by the road ; the prolongation of which is generally known as the Lynch road. The first village of any importance reached in the Bakhtiari jurisdiction is that of Kaveh, Rukh, distant 56 miles from Isfahan. From the north-west, i.e., Luristan, the approaches are through an inhospitable country and by lofty and difficult mountain passes. From the east, i.e., Fars, the approaches which pass through the Qashqai country are equally inhospitable, though physically less formidable. It is from the south that this country is most easily reached, and, more im portant still, from the sea—by the great, and only, waterway of Persia, the Karun river. This river, the origin of which has been briefly noted on above, after a tortuous course through the wild gorges and defiles of the higher Bakhtiari mountains, at length emerges from the hills immediately to the north of Shushtar, in a due southerly direction, and pursues its sinuous course over the wide alluvial plain that stretches to the Shatt-al- ’Arab and the Persian Gulf. On the way it receives at Band-i-Qir its m? n affix ent the Ab-i-Diz ; while lower down its channel is interrupted and its navigation impeded by the rapids at Ahwaz. Twj steamers work between Ahwaz and Shalalleh, about 35 miles below Shushtar, but above Band-i-Qir the river navigation during summer and autumn is very difficult. For further details see Karun River. All outside trade with the lakhtiarl, not to mention what is carried through to Isfa an and placesBAK—BAK 115 beyond, as well as that directly northwards to Shushtar, Dizfiil, and Luristan, passes, in the first instance, up this waterway. In this aspect it is, therefore, intimately connected with the present and future prosperity of the Bakhtiarl country. Internal.'—The main routes leading through the Bakhtiari country from the coast to the interior of Persia are :— (a) the Lynch or Bakhtiari road (Ahwaz to Isfahan) ; and (&amp;) the Shushtar-Bazuft-Isfahan route. Of these (a) is the main trade route from the sea-coast to the centre of Persia, and is used by the nomads of the eastern portion of the Bakhtiari country, while (fe) is the route followed by the nomads of the western portion in their annual migrations. The Lynch road starts from Nasiri, where Messrs. Lynch Bros, have established themselves, and enters the south-west limits of the Bakhtiari country 20 miles to the north of Nasiri. It had long been apparent that this road to Isfahan and Tehran, linked up by the Karun river with the head of the Persian Gulf, offered many advantages over the far longer caravan route from Bushire through Shiraz. This idea took definite shape in 1897, when the Persian Government granted a concession to the Bakhtiari Khans for the improvement of the trade- route from Ahwaz to Isfahan. Messrs. Lynch Bros., the Karun merchants, financed the scheme and undertook the construction of the road, which involved the improvement of the existing track, the building of various caravanserais, and the construction of three bridges. Work on the road was commenced soon after, the bridging material being sent out from Europe. In the result, a fair mule track was constructed after immense labour and energy on the part of Mr. Taylor of that firm ; and two bridges out of three planned, and for which material was ready, were put up. The specifications of these bridges are as follows :— 1 . Pul-i-Shalu, or Gudar-i-Balutak, over the Karun river. Wire-rope suspension, with piers of solid masonry and a lattice girder. Steel roadway and concrete flooring. Length 120 feet. Clear width of roadway 10 feet. Adapted to bear an ordinary work ing load of 2 | cwt. per square foot, or a live load, uniformly distributed, of 80 tons. 2. Pul-i-’Amarat, over the Ab-i-Bazuft. A suspension bridge of the same pattern as No. 1 . Length 70 feet. Clear width of road way 10 feet. Bearing power the same as No. 1 . 3. To replace the old bridge at Du Pulan over the Karun river. A steel girder bridge. Length 51 feet. Clear width of roadway 10 feet. Bearing power the same as No. 1 . This bridge has not been laid, and the material is said to be lying in the caravanserai at Du Pulan. The total length of this route from Ahwaz to Isfahan is 281 miles, of which only the first 42 miles are fit for wheeled traffic, an that only in dry weather. For a detailed description of this route see “ Routes in Persia, volume III part 2, route No. 15”.116 BAR—BAK Fiom the latest available returns of the traffic on the road it seems to be in a fair way of proving a commercial success. These returns, giving the number of packages or half-loads which have reached and been despatched from Ahwaz, read as follows :— 1908, 1909. 1910. Reached Despatched. Reached. Despatched. Reached, despatched 2,254 3,763 10,771 12,555 5,451 18,766. A postal service was organized in October 1910 between Ahwaz and Isfahan ; the mails are conveyed by foot-messengers, and, under normal conditions, take about 15 days, but delays and interruptions are frequent, owing to weather conditions and raids of robbers. The road from Shushtar strikes into this route on the plain of Tuleh, distant about 80 miles from Nasiri. Other roads .—Besides this the only route that can be dignified by the name of “ road ”, with its regular caravan stages, there are the innumerable mountain tracks connecting adjoining valleys. Of these, on the western side, there is a good bridle-path, with fair gradients from Dizful, almost in a direct line to Ardal. This track skirts the right bank of the Karun river, passing through the Kaleh Dukhtar, north of the plain of Aqili a ad Bhushtar : it continues thence by the Gardan-i-Nazirieh Cham into the Bazuft valley, which is again left by crossing the Gardan-i-Chari (9,300 feet), the highest point reached on this road. The track then drops dowm to the Karun river again and crosses one of its main sources by the stone bridge mar Behishtabad. From here it climbs on to the plateau of Ardal, the total distance covered being about 120 miles. This route should not be selected without due consideration, as its westerly portion passes along the border of Luristan ; and that province generally is insecure for travellers. Political importance .—Bakhtlari land, on' account of its position, is of considerable importance in regard to British interests. Situated at the head of the only navigable waterway of the whole empire, and one that empties itself into a sea, in which British interests predominate and are peculiar—inhabited by a people of considerable warlike instincts, in some contradistinction to their rulers in Tehran —and further forming, in conjunction with Luristan, a natural barrier to encroachments from the north—it is not unnatural to suppose that it may play an important role in the future, in what has been aptly termed “ the Middle Eastern question”. The inhabitants of Persia, generally, have lost, for many ages past, if indeed such a thing ever existed,- any feeling of patriotism or sympathy with their rulers ; and the Bakhtiari are far from being an exception to this rule. Hitherto, treachery, followed by cruel punishments, as well as internecine quarrels fostered by the Persian Government, have been the means by which the authority of the latter has been maintained. Such as it is, it exists merely with the idea of obtaining a certain sum of money yearly in taxation ; no single farthing of which is expended for any public purpose—local or otherwise. It is not, therefore, surprising that the Bakhtiari Khans would be inclined to welcome any change, even to the extent of a foreign Government on wdiich they could rely to free them from the intolerable burden and distrust,MNHMMHl / BAK—MK lit Xvliick general insecurity of persons and property imposes on its sufferers : und it is clear to them that they will have to make some choice in this regard within the no distant future. Military considerations.—It is interesting, therefore, to note briefly on the military possibilities of their country. (a) Fighting material and efficiency .—Various estimates and opinions have been given on the fighting material and efficiency of the Bakhtiari. Taking the latest census of 57,000 tents as correct, it may be reckoned that the numbers of adults and youths capable of bearing arms should be about 60,000, but, allowing for a wastage of 10,000 on account of disease and other causes, the real fighting strength may be estimated at 50,000. According to the Khans themselves the tribe could muster about 12,000 men, horse and foot, armed with breach-loading rifles. Of these some 2,000 • possess magazine rifles and the remainder Martini-Metfords and Martini- Henries. The Khans have, in addition, some 4,000 magazine rifles stored in their residences which they looted from the arsenals at Tehran and Isfahan. . The number of rifles, however* possessed by the tribesmen is now much greater and they are of a more modern type than the Martini, dhe Lebel 3 -charger is the chief weapon in use—the supply of ammunition, also seems plentiful as tribesmen never hesitate to indulge in match shooting at stones, etc,, against each other on all possible occasions, quite regardless of the number of cartridges used* ' u ; s ■ ) • Most of the armed men are fair, though not first-class, shots. The leaders„however, are often very fine shots from horseback, There are about 200 automatic pistols in the country in the hands of the Khans and their; immediate retainers. The number of horses that could be mustered has temporarily diminished owing to the number used up in the various conflicts against the partisans of the ex-Shah during the last two years. - Probably not more than 4,000 sowars could be mustered under any circumstances. Other guns of still more doubtful utility, to the number of perhaps 10,000, might be mustered among them. For operations against neighbouring tribesmen these weapons answer sufficiently well, but would be useless against good modern firearms. In regard to the question of the efficiency of the tribesmen, they have none in the military sense of the expression; but, tor purposes of guerrilla warfare in defending their own mountain homes, as guides, mounted infantry, for raiding on the skirts of an army, and as scouts, they would be invaluable to any European ally. The Khans are sufficiently intelligent to know that they have no chance of defending themselves against modern weapons, some of the latest types of which they possess for sporting and other purposes. This same intelligence would prevent them offering any useless resistance to any invasion of their country from the north, but, as auxiliaries, they would combine and use all their efforts to defend their country against annexation, in the mere sense of absorption. During the period preceding the harvesting of the new crops in May, supplies are a difficulty almost everywhere. At other times the supplies118 BAK—BAK available in different years vary considerably, but tbe following may be taken as a rough guide (а) The Chehar Mata 1 and Isfahan; after August, wheat 3,000 tons; barley 3,000 tons ; tobacco leaf 50 tons ; and large quantities of fruit between June and October. ( б ) Dizful and Shushtar ; after June, wheat 3,000 tons ; barley 2,500 tons ; and tobacco leaf 50 tons. (c) Basrah and the Tigris Valley ; after June, immense quantities of wheat and barley ; and in September, of dates. Estimated supply of live-stock :— &lt;«) DizffiJ, Shushtar, Bakhtiari country—500,000 sheep. (b) Isfahan plateau—100,000 sheep ; 10,000 cattle. Too much reliance cannot be placed on these figures, and it must be remembered that they are not available in the same place all the year round. Addendum. s, Tribal classification .—Various authorities have classified the different tribes or families of the two great divisions, the Haft and Chehar Lang, of the Bakhtiari. Later investigations have failed to substantiate this classi fication, which is, however, appended for possible reference .—(Extract from Curzon's “ Persia ”, vol. II, chap. XXIV.) 1. Haft Lang.

It belongs to a wealthy Shiraz merchant and contains about 100 houses. It stands in a great, open, and highly cultivated plain. Water is plentiful from a large stream, which also works a corn-mill.—(Fow/Ztaw, 1891.) BAKULA— Lat. 29° 31' N.; Long. 50° 36' E.; Elev.

It is close to the Rudkhaneh-i-Shirin. Abbott described it as a ruined village, outside which the inhabitants were living under hiyas. Durand, however, in 1878, said it was fairly prosperous, with a good spring close by, which supplies it with fair water.— {Abbott — St.John — Durand.) BALAGHl (TANG-I-)— Lat. 30° 10' N.; Long. 53° 10' E. ; Elev. 6,100'. A defile on the Shiraz-Isfahan post-road, in the province of Ears. It is situated between miles 80 and 84, on the 4th stage from Shiraz, its north entrance being 1 mile south of the Takht-i-Madar-i-Sulaiman. This is the most picturesque portion of the road on that route. The gorge has a width of from 200 to 1,000 yards. At several points where the high and precipitious cliffs close on to the river (a tributary of the Pulvar) the road has been galleried along the face of the rocks.— {Arbutknot, 1905.) BAlA GIRlWEH— A group of the Pish-Kuh tribes of Luristan. The tern! which signifies “ those that live in the high mountains ” is applied to the following nomad tribes living between the Kashgan and Diz rivers ; Sagwand, Dirakwand, Judeki, PapI, and Bairanwand. They are homogeneous to the extent that they have never accepted the rule of any individual, nor pay taxes with any regularity, but the Sagwand and Bairanwand are quite separate from the rest of the group. They were estimated in 1836 by Rawlinson at 6,000 families ; Layard, 1846, made the same estimate, and (if the Bairanwand be excluded as was done by both author ities) the figure to-day appears to be the same, as far as it is possible to make an estimate. The Saki tribe, formerly included in this group, is extinct* 'The Makan ’ AH tribe, formerly shown as one of this group, is now unknown ; it was merged in the Sagwand many years ago. The Bajulwand tribe has likewise ceased to be an independent unit.—(JE&amp;foow, 1911.)BALA RUD BILA RUD or BALAD RUD— A stream, wliich rises near Qilab in the^foot hills of Pusht-i-Kuh in Southern Luristan, and, passing 5 miles west of Dizful and 1 mile east of Bunvar, joins the river Diz on the left bank, 11 miles below Dizful. Its bed is coarse shingle. In midsummer it is dry except for pools ; in autumn it becomes a flowing stream supplying many Sagwand camps ; after heavy rain it is apt to become impassable for one or two days, the river coming down in a torrent of tremendous force. On one occasion, when the Shah of Persia was crossing it with an army, 50 horsemen are said to have been swept away, and the force was delayed on its bank for two days. There was formerly a brick bridge over this river on the road from Khu- zistan to Kirmanshah, but it is now destroyed. There are still traces of Alexander’s old road, a stone pavement and the ruins of a 5-arched bridge. Colonel Bell found the river, at 15 miles from Dizful, 100 yards wide, with st^ep banks of conglomerate. He says that rapids and shallows are numerous in its course and that the bed consists of pebbles and large boulders. Stony undulations, affording excellent grazing, border the river. A route between Dizful and Kirmanshah crosses the Bala Rud between Salihabad and Husaini.— (Rawlinson — Schindler — Bell—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BALAWAND— A tribe of Luristan. Classed by some as Dulfan, Khang Mahmud, and Lutf ’Ali. Under the influence of the Sardar Akram at present, but formerly under ’Ali Riza Khan of Pusht-i-Kuh , Rabino states them to number 300 families ; to live in the Hulailan districts in winter near Said Manch; tribal divisions Bala wand and Kaushwand. Plowden gave numbers at 1,000 families and said they paid 3,000 tumdns per annum . revenue.— (Yusuf Sharif, 1889.) BALINGAN BALAI— Lat. 32° 16' 40' N. ; Long. 48° 25 r 40' E.; Elev.

It contains a small fort and 25 horses of Kurds, Nais Arabs, under the protection of the Kathrr, and Dizfulls. There are 6 rifles. Water is obtained from the river Diz. It has gardens, much cultivation, and a large irrigation canal.— (Burton y 1903— Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BALINGAN DUMAN or PAIN— Lat. 32° 15' N.; Long. 48° 28' E.; Elev. A village* of 30 houses and a small fort in Northern ’Arabistan, 1 mile east of Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah. It is inhabited by agricultural Lurs, and has a fighting strength of 150 men, with 20 rifles. Water is procured from the Diz river.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BALINGAN PAIN, vide BALINGAN DUMAN— BALINGISTAN— Lat. 28° 21' N.; Long. 51° 15' E.; Elev.

This place is frequented by fisher men from ’Asalu, who take fish here in large seines and keep a few boats hauled on the point. The village of Bidkhun is about 2miles north-east anti f mile north from the point. It consists of 15 huts, mostly of Shi’ah immi grants from ’Asalu. On the shore of the bay opposite the village is a small anchorage protected from the west by a sandy point and reef. The village is nearly hidden in a grove of date and other trees, and there is a little stream of good water used for irrigation and to turn mills. The people grow tobacco, as well as dates and cereals, and own 10 fishing baqdrehs.

BANDAR DlLAM— Lat. 30° r 50' ; Long. 50° 12 r 15' ; Elev. 15': A small port on the coast of the Liravi district of Ears, but not forming part of it administratively ; it is situated about 85 miles north-north-west of Bushire and a similar distance east-north-east of the bar of the Shatt-al- ’Arab. Jurisdiction vested in the Khans of the Haiat Daub family. The town stands upon a low coast extending north ajid south, and consist ing of a strip of rocky land raised 10 to 15 feet above the sea-level, with swamps behind it which run inland for several miles. Half a mile to the south of the place is a little cultivation with some trees ; and to the eastward is a plain containing a few villages dependent on Bandar Dilam. A square fort stands in the middle of the town and 1J miles to the north east is the fort of Tunub, again mentioned below, which protects the water- supply. The houses are of sun-dried brick and one-storeyed. The population, seems to be decreasing, as there are now about 100 unoccupied and ruinous houses. The town is only a small trading and fishing village though at one time it belonged to the Dutch, the remains of whose factory used to be pointed out not many years ago. The fort is square (Lat. of highest tower 30° 3' 14'; Long. 50° 9' 45'). Nine miles south-east—half-east ofBAN—BAN 12T Bandar Dilam— is a small table hill of light colour with perpendicular sides (Lat. 29° 9' 58' ; Long. 50° 17' 36'). It is 165 feet high and visible for 14 miles. The coast here is merely a strip of land 10 or 15 feet above the sea, inland of which are swamps extending for miles. The anchorage for vessels, about 3| miles off th&amp; shore, is sheltered from the shimdl and partially from the Tcclus \ the bottom is of soft muff and the depth of water 4 fathoms ; native craft lie close to the beach in a creek in a mud flat. Landing is difficult because of the mud, and cargoes are loaded and un loaded by means of donkeys. Population.—The population is from 1,000 to 2,000 souls of the Behbehani tribe and is entirely Shi’ah ; all are Persian speaking, but about one-third of them can talk Arabic as well. Some are cultivators in the surrounding Liravi district; others sailors or fishermen and the remainder merchants or shop-keepers. Resources and Supplies. —The resources of the place are inconsiderable. Drinking-water is scarce and indifferent; it is brought from Tunub, about 1 mile distant. About 20 horses, 40 mules, 200 donkeys and 500 sheep are owned by the inhabitants. There are 10 bums, 10 mashuvehs and 20 small fishing boats. Bandar Dilam is the port of the wheat-growing districts of Zaidan and Behbehan, and to this circumstance it owes such trade as it enjoys. The fishermen here, using the drag net, catch large quantities of seer fish. They are split and dried and sent to Basrah by sea and to the surrounding villages on donkeys. The bazar contains 90 shops. Ordinary Persian coin, mostly krdns, is current and two units of weight are in use, viz., the local man of 14 lbs. 8| oz., English, and the Hashim man, of 16 ordinary local mans : unit of length is the gaz of 40 or 41 inches. Climate and Sanitation. —Ophthalmia is the prevailing disease here. There is very little fever and no small-pox ; in fact, if it were not for ophthalmia the town would be very healthy. Administration. —Bandar Dilam is ruled by two local Khans, brothers, who are under the authority of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, to whose charge it was relegated during the political re-arrangement of the Persian Gulf littoral which followed the fall of the Zill-us-Sultan in 1888. The Khans who defer considerably to Saiyids and Mullas, dispose of criminal matters, and civil causes are settled by the Kazi and Mullas. Bandar Dilam is said to have been ruled originally by Bani Tanim ’Arabs and after them by Bani Khalifeh. The latter were displaced 70 or 80 years ago by the father of the present Khans, Hazi Tahir, who profited by the absence of the ruling family during an epidemic of plague to make a private arrangement with the Governor of Behbehan and take adverse possession of the place. The present Khans are named Abdul Husain and Abdul Riza. Another account says there are no Khans and that the place is administered by the Customs officials ; the last Khans, named Abdullah and Ja’far, resigned as they were unable to meet their revenue obligations. The land-revenue of Bandar Dilam is trifling, but the receipts from sea-oustoms are considerable since the establishment of a post of the Imperial Customs. The Khan formerly farmed the sea-customs for 12,000 krdns per annum ; since direct management was initiated, he has been receiving compensation at the rate Pt. I. NL28 BAN—BAN of 5,000 Jcrdns annually, while the duties collected in 1905 are said to have amounted to 60,000 Jcrdns. The people of Bandar Dilam are fairly well armed with Martini rifles and revolvers.

A village constituting with some square miles of the country round it, a small administrative district in Southern ’Arabistan. It is the port of the . Jarrahi district and formerly served the Ramuz district also. Position and Boundaries. —The village of Ma’shur, generally called Bandar, is situated about a mile north of the inland termination of the Khur Ma’shur branch of the Khur Musa. According to a local tradition, the original village of Ma’shur was situated at a place called Tall Kafiran, which seems to be on the south-east bank of the Khur Ma’shur, about 3 miles from its head. The limits of the tract dependent on the village are not clearly defined, but they may be taken to include the south-eastern bank of the Khur Ma’saur, so far as it consists of terra firma, and the north-western bank down, probably to the mouth of the Khur Dauraq. - On the side towards Buzieh the limit of the Ma’shfir territory is said to be at a spot called . ’Aquleh, about 8 miles from the village. Surroundings and Communications. —The ground to the south of the town, which is mostly impracticable even for men on foot, is included in the de scription given of Khur Musa ; so also is the only route connecting the village with that inlet at the point called Sif. A direct route connects Ma’shur with Buzieh by way of ’Aquleh and of either Imamzadeh ’Abdul Hasan or Ramleh. Up to the border of the Fallahieh district at ’Aquleh, the country is mostly a saline plain with patches of grass which support con siderable flocks of sheep. A route to Fallahieh town, more northerly and less westerly in its intial stages than the last, strikes the Jarrahi river at Tuwaiqieh ; at 2 miles from Ma’shur this route runs through ground which is intersected by ravines—the beginnings of the hollow which reaches Khur Ma’shur between Ma’shur village and Sif—and would be heavy going after rain ; beyond this point, patches of wheat become frequent, and grass and scrub increase as the Jarrahi is approached. Communications with Ramuz are by various paths joining the Fallahieh-Ramuz route, which runs along the bank of the Jarrahi river, at different points. Character of the village. —Ma’shur village stands upon a mound which has the appearance of being artificial, but in all probability consists merely of the accumulated debris of a long inhabited site. A ruined burj dominates the place, and there are 3 mosques, of which the best was built in the present generation by one Haji Nasir, a merchant of the place. The houses are of the type usual in this part of Persia ; they are of mud with mud roofs and each of them encloses its own courtyard. Around the village, outside, are scattered the roofless mud walls of diminutive huts, which are occupied during the wheat harvest when the grain is heaped up outside the village. ' Sanitation is disregarded, and drinking water is largely drawn from a stag nant pool, the same as that in which clothes are washed. The atmosphere in summer is said to be very damp and the heat oppressive. Inhabitants.-^The population of Ma’shur village is about 1,000 souls ; as a whole the people are healthy and well-favoured in appearance. Half of them are Bandaris or Bandarieh and are said to be connected with the B^nl Turuf, but this point is very doubtful and the Bandaris themselves profess ignorance of their origin ; the remainder are described as Qaaavabls sr 2130 BAN-BAN from BehbeMn. The Bandaris are said to have been the founders of the place and the Qanavatis later immigrants. The entire community is bi-lingual, speaking both Persian and Arabic; but among themselves the peoples use a low form of Persian of the Lur type. Their dress is in the main ’Arab in pattern, but it is not free, especially in the case of women, from Persian modifications. Men wear the Arab Kafieh or kerchief, the ’Arab ’Aqul or head fillet and the ’Arab ’ Aba or cloak ; underneath the last is a Zabun or long cotton coat reaching to the heels. Women all wear the ’Aba, their coiffure is ’ Arab and the Persian Burqa’ is not seen among them. On the other hand, trousers frequently form a part of their costume, shoes are worn—which are not found among ’Arab women of the lower classes—and as children, they frequently adopt the bandage round the forehead which is not assumed by ’ Arab women until after marriage. Until two generations ago the permanent inhabitants of Ma’shur were all Sunnis, at least so the people themselves aver ; now they are all Shi’ahs. Ma’shur is at present the seat of a Mulla named Shaikh Husain, who has considerable local influence and receives Zaqat even from the villages on the Jarrahi. His sentiments are believed to be anti-European. The people of Ma’shur are fairly well armed and possess in all about 100 rifles. Agriculture and Livestock. —There are traces of extensive irrigated culti vation to the north and west of Ma’shur village, but the fields have long ceased to exist. The necessary supply of water is said to have been drawn from the Jarrahi by means of a dam at Haddaneh. There is now no irri gation on the north side of Ma’shur, nor is any met with on going westward till the Khatar canal of the Shatul tract is reached near Jmamzadeh ’Abdul Hasan in the Fallahieh district. Cultivation is now restricted to 50 or 60 kliish or ploughs of land in the neighbourhood of the village, on which pre carious crops of wheat and barley are grown by rainfall alone. Water-supply and other resources .—Rain-water is collected on the east side of the town by an embankment faced with brick, built about 10 years ago by the merchant HajI Nasir, before mentioned ; on the open tank thus formed, the people of Ma’shur depend for all purposes during 8 months in the year, and during the remaining 4 months they drink from wells, of which there are many small ones m the town. There is also, to the west of the town, an underground ci^lern which holds excellent water and is also due to the liberality of Haji Nasir ; the entrance is kept locked during the winter. The fact that the livestock of Ma’shur is not sent elsewhere in the hot weather seems to indicate that the water-supply is in no way deficient, but the well-water at least is brackish and unhealthy. Fodder is brought from the Jarrah and Hindian districts, and fuel con sisting of small bushes only, is mostly cut within a radius of 10 miles of the village on its east and west sides. The prices of ordinary supplies frequently range high in Ma’shur. In March 1906, the rate for wheat was 23 to 27 krdns , and for barley 14 krdns per local Hashim man of 248 lbs. English. Fish and excellent prawns are caught at Zangi and the rate for the latter, at the time just mentioned, was I hdn per Bushire man of 7f lbs. if dried, and 8 krdns if cleaned.mi ■iHlliMIMliMMMMW / BAN-BAN 131 jTra^e.—The rise of Nasiri on the Karun river has adversely affected Ma 'shur, and has taken from it the greater part even of the Ramuz export trade, of which it had formerly a monopoly,. The staple export is wheat, but the quantity available varies greatly, as elsewhere in ’Arabistan, from season to season. There is also some exportation of barley. In a good year the amount of wheat passing through the port may amount to 600, and that of barley to 50, local kdrehs. From 20,000 to 30,000 fleeces of wool, valued at from 15 to 26 tumdns the hundred, are exported in each year. Some beans, sesame, and oak-bark also are shipped from Ma’shur, but it is stated that gum arabic and linseed no longer follow this route as formerly. Imports, which are mostly of Indian origin, are received through Kuwait* Bushire and Muhammareh. The chief articles imported are qand or loaf sugar, about 200 cases a year ; shakkar or granulated sugar, about 300 bags per annum ; also piece-goods, tea and spices. The piece-goods are mostly from Muhammareh. The prices of imported goods depend on the prices at Bushire and are greater by the amount of freight and other transit charges and by the commission of the local merchant, which is at the rate of 5 to 10 per cent. The price of qand is thus 8 to 10 tumdns for a case containing 32 to 36 cones. There are only 2 merchants of consideration at Ma’shur. Both are Beh- behams by origin and both have now their headquarters at Kuwait. There is no bazar Ma’shur and all business is transacted in private houses. The weights in use at Ma’shur are the following :— 1 tvaqieh — 1 Bushire man or Vf lbs. English, 13 „ =1 Khalafabad man or 124 „ ,, 32 „ — 1 Hashim man or 248 „ „ 100 Hashim mans = 1 Kareh or 24,800 „ „ The waqieh is divided into rub’ or quarters, and nlm or halves. The unit of linear measure is the zar’-i-shdh of the Persian coast. Port and Shi'p'pinq .—The creek has banks of shelving mud, and at low tide holds 3 feet of water with a width of 15 feet. On high tides it is some 50 feet wide. The landing-place for goods is more than 2 miles from the village, and the path connecting the two becomes difficult in bad weather. Only about 10 trading boats are owned at Ma’shur and 4 fishing boats of size : of the former class 5, belonging to one owner, are capable of making voyages to Kuwait and even to Masqat. Numerous vessels from other ports call at Ma’shur, and in a year of large wheat export as many as 600 visits may be paid by strange craft : these are mostly Mdshuwehs, Ghunchehs and Baqdrehs, but sometimes they are Ballams and occasionally Baghalehsi All vessels must sail or drift up Khur Musa to Ma’shur as, from the nature of the banks, there is no possibility oftowing them. The journey from Ma’shur to Kuwait by sailing vessel ordinarily occupies about 24 hours, but in favourable circumstances it may be per formed in half that time. About 24 hours is the time usually required to reach Fallahieh town from Ma’shur by water via Khur Ma’shur and Khur Dauraq. From the Ma’shur landing-place west to the Dauraq canal the sea is reported to be unapproachable, the shore along the north being low and swampy and flooded by tides far inland.Government. —Ma’shur is understood to be the joint property of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh and the Mashir-ud-Dauleh, having been obtained by the former from the Persian Government as a tiyiil in 1895. It is farmed from the owners by the Shaikh of Muhammareh, but the terms of the lease are not at present ascertainable. The local authority until about 8 years ago was a certain Mir ’Abdullah, belonging to a tribe or family called Amareh of Khalafabad ; and to him belonged the ruined fort which is still visible at Ma’shur. In the time of Mir ’Abdullah the Shaikh of Muham mareh had not perhaps obtained the farm of the revenues of Ma’shur, for they were then paid into the treasury at Shushtar. Four or five years ago Mir ’Abdullah died, having been held in imprisonment for the last 3 or 4 * years of his life by the Shaikh of Muhammareh, whose displeasure he had incurred. Since this event the influence of the Shaikh at Ma’shur has become supreme and undisputed, and he has been represented locally by a -confidential agent named Shaikh Salaiyeh, who was at one time among his personal attendants, and whose position and powers as regards Ma’shur as well as the Hindian district, also controlled by him, appear to be indefi nite. The Shaikh of Muhammareh is exceedingly feared at Ma’shur, but there, as elsewhere in Southern ’Arabistan, he seems to be regarded as a just man. ^ i The only agricultural tax is one on land actually cultivated at the rate of 110 lerdns per khish, but the Shaikh also recovers one chehdrak per man (or the monetary equivalent) on the flesh of every animal slaughtered for food ; and there is reason to believe, though every effort is made to conceal the fact, that he collects an excise of 2 tumdns on every hundred fleeces exported from Ma’shur. The customs of Ma’shur before their transfer to the Imperial Persian Customs Department were valued at 6,000 tumdns per annum ; no proper estimate of their yield under the new regime can be framed, but it is said to amount to 20,000 tumdns yearly. There is no telegraph office. A post office managed by the customs exists, however, and a weekly service to Muhammareh, Hindian, and Bushire is maintained.— (Burton, 1903— Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) BANDAR NASIRl or NASIRlEH— Lat. 31° 19' N.; Long. 48° 45-30' E.; Elev. A small but flourishing town in Southern ’Arabistan, which has sprung up since the opening of the Karun river to steam navigation. It is situated on the left bank of the river Karun immediately below the Ahwaz rapids, and about 1 mile from Ahwaz town. It stands upon a slight elevation overlooking the river, and (1905) contains 118 houses of stone, brick, and mud, two caravanserais, two public baths, two mosques, 196 shops, of which 106 are occupied, and two coffee-shops. The importance of Bandar Nasiri which, after Muhammareh, is the chief place on the river Karun below its junction with the river Diz, de pends partly on its being the chief place in the Ahwaz district and the seat of the Shaikh of Muhammareh’s Governor, but still more upon its favourable situation in regard to trade. The run of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s steamer on the Karun ends at Bandar Nasiri, and the cargoes for the Upper Karun are here discharged and conveyed by aBAN—BAN 133, tfam-line, the property of the Mu’in-ut-Tujjar, to a point l mile above . Ahwaz town, where they are re-shipped, mostly for Shushtar. There is a weekly post from Bandar Nasiri to Shushtar and Muhammareh, With both of which places, as also with Ramuz, the town has telegraphic ^connection. Bandar.Nasiri is, moreover, the starting point of the Ahwaz-Isfahan road, which traverses the Bakhtiari country, and is the route followed by a steadily increasing caravan trade. The town is also a centre for local trade, and much grain for export changes hands in this place. The polpulation of about 1,500 souls is mixed and consists of Shushtaris, Dizfulis and Arabs. NasirI-Ahwaz (Tramway line)— General desertion.—The total length of the line is about 2,500 yards, gauge 3 feet. Starting at the wharf on the south of the Customs build ings used by the “ Nasrat,” for about 150 yards it lies along a narrow lane cutting the MuTn-ut-Tujjar’s Bazar at right angles, Emerging, it turns off at an obtuse angle to the left. From this point it proceeds along the front line of Nasiri houses, the ground on the left being open. Leaving Nasiri it proceeds over open country till Ahwaz in reached. Ahwaz lies on its left, i.e., western side. &lt; After the preliminary turn the course is straight till a point level with the middle of Ahwaz. Here it bends again slightly to the left, and there are two or three buildings here on its right or east side. About 100 yards short of the Shushan mooring place, wbere it termi nates, it crosses a small culvert and is further deflected to the left. The following are its chief features r At Nasiri, its terminus and the first 100 yards of its course are hemmed in by buildings and there is little free space. Fropa here for about 600 yards it lies in an almost continuous cutting 2 to 4 feet deep, which becomes a flowing stream in heavy rain. Loading here could be carried on from either side of the line. It then crosses a depression by a revetted embankment and two culverts about 8 or 9 feet high. After this cutting through a narrow ridge, it proceeds on a continuous earth embankment varying from 8 to 2 feet till the bend at Ahwaz is reached, only at one point striking the level of the soil. 1 At various points the surrounding country is liable to be submerged by standing water after heavy rain. It then continues on the ground level till the last culvert is crossed when it is carried on an embankment to the bank just below the Shushan. Cargo - has to be loaded and discharged on the right side, where ground is confined by a garden enclosure. There is a steep descent to the water’s edge. The track .—The rails are iron of —) section, and are laid on small crooked wooden sleepers made of wood from the Diz River. There is no ballasting and these sleepers are usually exposed, giving a very rough surface for the horses, which, however, with practice become very expert in keeping their feet. — . -The rails have been laid too close, head to head, and with the expandon caused by heat in summer they sometimes buckle and become displaced. The line exhibits minor irregularities in level, straightness, and gauge. The general alignment is however level and no brakes are necessary. Rolling stock, etc .—There are at present two old and two new trolleys, four more new trolleys are being put together at Muharmmareh. The trolleys have a carrying surface of about 6' 8' X 4' 9'. Load, | to 2 tons per trolley in good weather. Each trolley drawn by one horse. At present there are six horses. Extension .—It is not stated in what direction extension would be con templated. The ground is generally well adapted. No difficulties would be met with up the river, till the Gargar is reached at Band-i-Qir. Just beyond Ahwaz there is some elevated ground which would require negotiation, or the application of brakes which the present trolleys do not have. The line could be carried to Bamuz by the route via Raghaiweh followed by the oil carts, though the sand hills between Linhairi and Raghaiweh would probably give trouble. Down the river there is no obstacle, as far as is known, until the Mand, 10 miles above Muhammareh is reached. In the lower section of this route continuous embankment would probably be necessary .—{Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908— Lorimer.) BANDAR RIG— Lat. 29° 24' N.; Long. 50° 41' E.; Ele\% The port and chief town of the Haiat Daud district of Ears ; it is situated on the coast 30 miles north-north-west of Bushire town and 156 miles due east of Kuwait. Bandar Rig stands upon a low , sandy coast which runs north and south; there is a creek at the town fronted by two sandy islets or banks, inside which native boats be aground at low water. On the north and south the town is adjoined by cultivated lands belonging to adjacent villages, and on the east at about 2 miles distance is a chain of low sand-hills, which screen it from the view of the traveller as he approaches on that side. The only defensive work is the loopholed, semi-fortified residence of the Khan built of stones and mud. Bandar Rig possesses a few date trees, and there are two unimportant shrines. The general history of Bandar Rig is included in that of the Haiat Daud district. Here in 1754 the English East Company, whose trade in the Gulf had been seriously crippled by the troubles arising out of the Afghan in vasions, endeavoured to found a factory and sent out an agent. Owing to Dutch opposition and intrigues, the attempt was a failure, and a few years later Bushire was selected as a substitute. A little later in the same cen tury a famous Gulf pirate, an exceptional ruffian, of the name of Mir Mahanna, had his stronghold here. His fort was taken and razed to the ground by British troops. Bandar Rig is said to be very ancient. ,BAN—BAN 135 Population. —The inhabitants number about 2,000 souls ; they are a mongrel breed in whom Arab and Lur blood predominate. Persian, modi fied by the Lur dialect, is the language spoken. The people are cultivators, boatmen, sailors and traders ; they are reputed peaceable and not fana tical, but they are fairly well armed with Martini rifles, about 3 to every house. They are Shi’ah Muhammadans, but traditions survive of a time when some of them were Gabrs. Can produce 450 fighting men. Trade and Swppfes.—Bandar Rig is a fairly prosperous port, dealing principally with Bushire and Kuwait, and serving the considerable district of Haiat Daud, and a part of the district of Shabankareh. The bazar con tains about 50 shops and trade has increased during the last few years ; the monthly imports are said now to average 100 packages or bags of sugar, 5 cases of tea, 50 bags of Indian rice, 100 cases of kerosine oil, and 50 bales •of Manchester prints, all from Bushire. There is also a considerable im portation of camels from Kuwait. Exports are wheat, barley, gum, wool and cattle, all to Bushire except the wheat, of which the bulk is sent to Kuwait, Bahrain and Masqat. The Persian lerdn is the basis of the currency, but rupees and dollars also circulate. The unit of weight is a Hashim man equal to 20 Tabriz man of Bushire, and consequently different to the Hashim man of that place, which is equivalent to 16 Tabriz man of the same town. The standard of length is a qaz of 8| inches. Resources and Communications. —Water is obtained from wells, and some wheat, barley and straw are locally procurable. About 50 horses, 100 camels and 150 donkeys, also 100 cattle and 600 sheep and goats are owned in the town, and there are 8 bums besides 10 mdshuvehs and 15 fish ing boats. A Pers an post office wa opened here about 1901, and a tele graph office about 1904 ; but very little use is made of the latter, which is intermediate between Borazjun and Bandar Dilam on the Borazjun Ahwaz branch line. There is frequent communication with Bushire by sailing boat. Administration. —Bandar Rig is the residence of Haidar Khan, the here- d tary local Government of the Haiat Daud district. The system of ad ministration is described in the article on that district, vide this Gazetteer. The Imperial Persian Customs established an official here with two subor dinates about 1904.— (Petty — Bell — Curzon, 1889— MacGregor, 189o ; Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908 ; Chick, 1910.)

It was built on one of four ledges of sandstone, which cross the river at this point for the purpose of keeping up the water to fill the canals for irrigation purposes, At the west epd of it is an opening of about 40 yards broad, and through this (with the exception of the water which finds its way over the small places where the dam is worn by time or broken away), the whole of the river, here about 200 yards broad, rushes with a tremendous fall and velocity. This dam . stayed the further course of the Euphrates, one of the steamers of Colonel Chesney’s expedition in 1836, but in March 1842 Lieutenant Selby of the Indian Navy, in the Assyria, passed safely through and proceeded up the river to within a few miles of Shushtar.

The river Diz also joins the Karun here. It contains some 40 mud houses and its inhabitants are ’Anafijeh Arabs, who cultivate wheat and barley and own about 20 mules and some donkeys.The banks here, which stand about 18 feet above the Gargar at low water, are overflowed in floods. There is a boat-ferry with 3 small boats, and land routes lead through the Mianab to Shushtar. Bell says the river here is from 200 to 300 feet wide, and from bank to bank 300 to 600 yards wide, with the banks 20 feet high. A bridge at Band-i-Qlr was opened by Shaikh Chasib on the 6fch January 1912. The bridge cost 4,300 tumans and tolls have been fixed at the follow ing rates :— ’Camels ,. ..♦•&gt;• Kran. Horses 4 »» Foot passengers Free. A charge of 30 krans iot each steamer, and 5 krdns for each boat is also O proposed. The land revenue of the village was farmed for 1,500 krdns in 1904. Band-i-Qir sends most of its produce to Bandar Nasirx and receives most of its imports from Shushta. It is surrounded by the ruins of the old city of Lashkar or ’Askar-i-Mukram. the name Band-i-Qir is derived from a dyke whose stones were fastened together by “ qlr, ” t.e., bitumen. This dyke is said to have been made by Darius. It raises the water of the Gargar, here 50 yards wide and very deep, for irrigating the country. South of Band-i-Qir as far as Wais, naptha is found in the neighbourhood ; supplies are plentiful. (Bell Bayard — Robertson — Schindler — Baring — Wells — Ross—Persian Gulf Gazet teer, 1908.)

LAM— The BanI Lam countn^ proper is the plain between the Persian hills or Pusht-i-KQh and the left bank of the Tigris river, from a point opposite Shaikh Sa’ad down to ’Amarah town. In Arabistan the ordinary limit of the tribe is the Karkheh river between Pa-i-Pul on the north and the Hawizeh district on the south, but they sometimes range as far as the Shaur river, especially below Khairabad. A detached colony of the Lawaimi section even exists beyond the Karun, and there is another still more distant at the village of Mlrbacheh in the Ramuz district. Divisions and Numbers .—The Bani Lam consists of several sections, which have not generally, it is said, separate habitats, but live interspersed. On the side towards ’Arabistan the principal divisions of the tribe are the following :— Division. Sub-division. Habitat of sub-division. Fighting strength.

The Sarkhah are not of very much importance. The number of fighting men of the tribe in ’Arabistan is thus approxi mately 8,000 including those of the tribe in ’Iraq, the fighting strength of the whole tribe is probably about 15,000 men and their total number 45,000 souls. Mode of life and re sources.—The majority of all sections of the tribe are agricultural and live by growing cereals. The tribe has not, however, as a whole abandoned a nomadic life for no houses are found among them, but only hair tents, and they migrate towards the hills in the cold weather and are on the move from February to June. Wheat, barley, oats, maize, mash and lentils are among their crops, but they have not much rice ; their cultivation is shifting and desultory. The camels and horses of the Bam Lam are among the best in ’Iraq. They have also buffaloes, cattle, sheep and donkeys. The horses possessed by the portion of the tribe which lives in ’Arabistan are estimated at 1,500 and their camels at 3,000. Political 'position and military importance.—The tribe are with a few exceptions Shi’ahs ; by some of them Persian is spoken as well as Arabic. Blood feuds are rigorously prosecuted. The tribe are blindly submissive to their Shaikhs both in peace and war, and they do not fail to combine against outsiders. Their present head is Ghadhban. In Persia the tribe give much trouble to the authorities and seldom pay any revenue. The tribe are noted for their predatory tendencies, but in reality they live for the greater part a peaceful and respectable life. In Persia it is the Khasraj that give the most trouble, and the Kinanah also are said to raid in the Dizful district. The Bani Lam are now well supplied with modern rifles, chiefly Martinis, and are considered to be good shots, especially from the saddle. It is estimated that on the Persian side about one-third of the fight ing m^n aremounted and two-thirds are armed with rifles .—{Persian Gulf Gazetteer,, 1908.)

Their territory from north to south has an extent of about 20 miles , beginning a few miles to the south of Hawi zeh town and reaching to Kushk ; its eastern boundary is at a place called Shaikh Muhammad, and on the west it includes part of the Karkheh or Tigris marshes. The majority of the tribe engage in wheat and barley cultivation and own large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, besides about 3,000 camels ; but the Hiyadir, Al Bu ’Abaiyid and Bariheh sections in habit the marshes, where they cultivate rice, keep buffaloes and cattle, and move about in mashufs or bitumen canoes. The fighting strength of the Bani Saleh is estimated at 1,000 horsemen and 3,350 foot soldiers, and they own some 2,200 rifles. McDouall says their fighting strength is only about 2,000.

BANl TAMIM (2) (Tribe)— A large and powerful Arab tribe in Southern ’Arabistan They are tent- dwellers, and range the drier parts of the country between the rivers Karun, Shatt-al-’Arab and Tigris. Unlike most of the tribes of the province, in religion they are Sunni Muhammadans, and in their mode of life also they differ considerably from the other Arab tribes of ’Arabistan. They are said to be of Muntafik extraction. Their territory in Southern .Arabistan in cludes the right bank of the river Karun between Milaihan and Sab eh and they may be found anywhere to the west of that line up to the Turkish fron tier. In summer the bulk of the tribe approach the Karun m the date season they encamp on the left bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab between Nashveh and D’aiil, where many of them own date plantations ; m winter and spring they occupy the western end of their country, but a few of the Ayaisheti section sometimes encamp and cultivate in the cold weather at i aqtii, and others more regularly appear at Qajarleh. There is no estimate of their numbers by sections, but their strength is reckoned at 1,000 unmounted and 2,000 mounted men, part of the latter being camel-riders and their PL I. 0144 BAN—BAN total number may be about 10,000. They own some 2,500 camels 1 400 horses and large numbers of donkeys, cattle and sheep. They also cultivate wheat and barley, and when in Southern ’Arabistan they pay revenue to the Shaikh of Muhammareh at the rate of 10 krdns per cultivated Fadddn as well as one-fourth of the actual gross produce. Their divisions are the Bani Malik, to whom belong the members of ruling family ; the Bani Nahad, * Hamud ; Bani Sakain ; Ghizli; Ghazaiwi; Ghizzi; Baraji’eh ; Sulaiman * ’Ayaisheh ; Halaf ; ’Awainat; and Hamid. The correspondence of some of these names with those of sections of the Bani Saleh will be observed. The Bani T'amim are now all enrolled in the A1 Bu Kasib section of the Muhaisin. The ’Awainat and ’Ayaisheh sections have been so affiliated to the Muhaisin for some yesus.—(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) f BANI TURUF (Tribe)— A large and powerful tribe in the Hawizeh district of Southern ’Arabistan numbering some 20,000 souls and occupying the whole of the country watered by the river Karkheh below Kut Nahr Hashim, including the marshes. The seat of the ruling family who belong to the A1 Bu ’Azar is at Khafaji’eh on the left bank of the main stream, several hours to the west of Kut Nahr Hashim where there is a bazar of about 90 mud-built shops. The Bani Turuf are Shi’ahs and live in huts made of mats, reeds and grass. They subsist chiefly by agriculture, but are also stock-breeders ; rice is their staple crop ; some wheat and barley also are cultivated by them, and they are said to own 20,000 head of buffaloes and cattle but no sheep. They export large quantities of rice and hides tb ’Amareh via Hawizeh and send qM by direct caravan to Muhammareh and Basrah. Piece-goods, sugar coffee etc, they obtain principally from ’Amareh ; but the tobacco comes from bhushtar. The Bam Turuf fall into two main divisions, the Bait Sa’id and the Bait Saiyah of which the sub-divisions are given below in tabular form. , nn/f ** t l 1 6 Barii i Turuf can muster about 5,650 fighting men, with nearly ; but on l v some 50 men altogether belonging to the families of the Shaikhs are mounted.

The Nais are of the same origin as the separate tribe so named in the Hawizeh district, and as the Nais section of the ’Anafijeh and Bait Sa’d tribes. From the names of the sections, it may be conjectured that the Bani Tumf are largely composed of fragments detached from other tribes in ’Arabistan and Turkish ’Iraq ; but it should be added that the information obtained above of this tribe is not of a very clear or satisfactory kind. The Bani Turuf have from time to time resisted the authority of the Shaikh of Muhammareh in the Hawizeh district, but without much success. They are generally characterised as thieves and robbers.

A saddle-back connecting the Gandum-Kar mountain, a spur of the great Garreh, with the latter. It is crossed by the Bakhtiari caravan road on its 7th stage from Isfahan, between miles 110 and 113. It has received its significant name of “ Dead Lambs ” from some particular fatality which occurred here to grazing flocks. The snow' lies for several of the winter months to a depth of 20 to 30 feet and renders its crossing dangerous, if not impossible, for certain periods of the year. This is, in fact, the chief obstacle to the keeping open of the Bakbtiari caravan route, which cannot avoid crossing it. It may be found impassable by laden animals any time between the 25th December and the 10th of March.— {Arbuthnot, 1905.) BA8AIDI— Lat. 31° 12' 15' N.; Long. 49.° 38' 30' E.; Elev.

A village in the Shulistan district of Ears, some 75 miles south-east by road trom Behbehan town on the way to Shiraz, and situated in a valley of the same name. It contains a castle built of stone set in lime, standing on a low mound and surrounded by some 60 huts. The castle is enclosed by high walls and flanked with turrets. It used to be the residence of the chief of the Bui division of the Kuhgalu tribe, and resembles the castles of the old feudal barons in Europe. This chief rebelled and was executed by the Nasir-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Behbehan, and a permanent garrison was stationed here. It is now (1903) the property of Asad Khan, Sardar of the Bakhtiari, and is inhabited by his uncle. The castle stands about | a mile from the left bank of the river and would hold about 70 men. The villagers number about 100, and are said to be at feud with all their neighbours, and never to dare to wander out of sight of the castle. A few supplies of grain and sheep are procurable here, and a plentiful supply of firewood can be obtained from the hills. The stream mentioned above iurnishes the village with good water. It runs in two streams, 30 yards wide and normally 6 inches deep, over a shingly bed, but it is capable of becoming an awkward flood. The whole valley is covered with rich grass, clover and corn, and there are several gardens. Large clumps of myrtle are to be found, and rice and carraway seed are cultivated in large quantities. About 1| miles up stream is another castle. From Basht a road runs to Mian Kutal which is reported to be good.— {Jones — Wells — Baring — McGowan, 1895 ; Ho'pJcins, 1903.)

A town in Laristan, and the capital of a district of the same name, 46f miles from Charak, on the road to Lar. It is built of sun-dried bricks, and contains 600 houses with a popula tion of between 4,000 and 5,000. It is situated in the centre of a small plain, about 4 miles in length from east to w r est and 3 miles in breadth from north to south. This plain is enclosed by high mountains on all sides. The town is unfortified and unwalled. Seen from the heights above, it presents a most picturesque appearance, being surrounded by green fields €BAS—BAS 151 SS' and large plantations of palm-trees. There is a ;small fort on the hills to the south of it, about 2 miles off. Approaches .—The position of Bastak is naturally a strong one. The approaches to it are three in number, viz :— 1st .—The pass to the north (height 2,450 feet), beyond which roads bifurcate to Lar, Furg and Bandar Abbas. 2nd .—The two roads from Lingeh via Champeh and Juneh which unite at Utaii caravanserai. dr^.—The road from Ishkanan, 13 farsakhs distant. The first of these is 4| miles north-east of the town. At that point the valley, gradually ascending, grows narrower, and narrower, until it ter minates abruptly at the summit of the pass in a precipitous fall of about 100 feet. Right and left rise lofty mountains unturnable for miles. Down the face of this fall the road from Bastak descends steeply by a zig-zag track, and then, still descending, goes along a narrow valley, which is looked into from the termination of the plain above and the heights on either side. An enemy assailing the position would have to advance on a narrow front for at least 1,200 yards, and finally under a fire to which, from its elevation, he would be unable to reply effectively, ascend the zigzag track, and carry the position. On this account, whenever Bastak has been invaded from the north, it has always been via Ishkanan, in which direction the ground is more open. The detour that has to be made is great, and ample time is consequently given to make preparations for resistance in that direction. From the south the best route would be via Kalas and on up the Bastak river. There is said to be a foot-path from Kalas to Bastak, and another one thence across the Kuh-i-Gavbus to Fathura. Inhabitants .—The inhabitants are Sunnis and are, generally speaking, a fine and hardy race of mountaineers, naturally warlike. All possess fire arms, which are either old Tower 'muskets, or match-locks of native manufacture, these latter being rather scarce. Swords are but little used, men, both on horse and on foot, using fire-arms only. Lances are un known. Fire-arms are imported from Bombay via Lingeh, and also come from Bushire. Among them are Snider rifles, Martinis, and cheap muzzle- loaders. Water-supply .—There are 29 large wells, and water being about 25 feet below the surface. They are similar in construction to those seen in many parts ef India, being built over the mouth, which support a cross-beam with pulleys, two pillars through which ropes run, which are attached to bullocks, who, walking down a steep incline, draw the water up in leather bags. There are probably as many small, round wells again. Most of them are revetted. There are at least 29 domed tanks (birkehs) varying in diameter from 17 to 39 feet, and in depth from 15 to 25 feet. The water is good. . * Firewood is obtained from the Gavbus range to the north-west of the town, where there is said to be a well-wooded plateau, which also affords excellent gazing. There is also good grazing near the town, and between it and Janeh. ^ .152 BAS—BAS District .—The district contains 15,000 inhabitants and is said to be able to muster 3,000 fighting men—the town of Bastak alone supplying 800 of these. Wheat and barley form the bulk of the crops, the harvest for the former being in April. There are also large date plantations, which extend to the west of the town for a distance of 2| miles. Cattle, sheep and goats are scarce. The mdlidt is 40,000 rupees, and is paid to Lar.— (Vaughan, April 1890.) BASTAK DISTRICT— A Persian district belonging to the Laristan division of the province of Pars ; the town of Bastak, from which the district takes its name, is situ ated at least 40 (?) miles from the nearest point on the sea-coast, and not less than 60 (?) miles north-west of the town of Lingeh. Bastak has never theless an indirect connection with the Persian Gulf, and is held, in a sense, to extend to the shore of the Gulf on both sides of the Lingeh district. To the west of the Lingeh district the revenue of the villages of Charak and Tavaneh in Shib Kuh and part of Dun wan in Lingeh, for all of which the Shaikh of Charak is responsible, and similarly the revenue of the villages of Mughu and Hasineh in Shib Kuh and of part of Bustaneh in Lingeh, collected by the Shaikh of Mughu, have now for some time been payable to the Governor of Bastak. To the east of the Lingeh district again, the town of Khamir, together with the coast from the border of the Lingeh dis trict at Pulghar to the frontier of the Khamir district ot the mouth of the Rud-i-Kul, is recognised as belonging geographically to Bastak. This re cognition, however, is of no practical significance, for Khamir, the only place of importance, is actually subject, for administrative purposes, to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, while its revenues are farmed by the Mu’in ut-Tujjar of Tehran : locus standi of the Governor of Bastak in relation to this part of his territories is consequently difficult to understand. The coast of the district from Pul Ghar to the mouth of the Rud-i-Kul is about 34 miles in extent ; its average direction is from west-south-west to east-north-east, and it forms the north shore of Clarence Strait between Qishm Island and the main land ; it is a low coast, and the greater part of it has not as yet been satisfactorily examined. The village of Khamir, situated 14 or 15 miles west of the Rud-i-Kul, divides the coast into two portions, of which the western appears to be the exit of a great valley from the west, possibly of the long trough which lies behind the maritime range of the Shib Kuh and Lingeh districts, and contains Galleh-Dar, Ishkanan and Tara- kimeh. Off this part of the coast line lie miles of swamp, from which most of the firewood used in the lower part of the Gulf is obtained ; the marshes are intersected by numerous creeks, difficult of passage except for small boats. The maritime range which forms the northern boundary of the Lingeh district and which has already been described in the articles on that dis trict and on Shib Kuh, encloses this part of Bastak on the south ; and the district appears to be intersected by a higher range, similar in direction, which leaves the coast at Khamir village. This last range has two principal summits near Khamir ; one, which is 9 miles north-east of the village andBAS—BAS 15^ BAS—BAS 15^ ^ven nearer the coast, is 3,700 feet high and another, 12 miles north-west of Khamir, is even loftier but is less bold in outline. From the higher peak a spur runs off south-eastwards in the direction of Khamir ; its foot- liills contain deposits of sulphur. The following are the principal places on or near the Bastak Coast: Name. Position. Houses and inhabi tants. Remarks. Khamir On the coast 12 miles west-north-west of Laft on Qishm Is- lancL &gt; ■ r . y . See article Khamir. Lashtaghan . 2 miles west of Khamir. 40 houses. The people are mostly Sunnis.

It possesses many gardens and abundance of fruit, specially raisins, which, it exports in addition to a great quantity of wheat, walnuts, fruit of the sinjid, and jauz-dghand, i.e., flesh of pared pears or peaches rolled round walnuts. The few Europeans who have visited this place did so in search of khar-i-Girdu, i.e., the excrescences of the walnut tree ; some trees that had been matured were purchased for 400 krdns. Good wooden spoons are manufactured as also fantastically-shaped padlocks, but the locks except for being shaped like birds, and sometimes requiring two distinct keys to open them, do not differ from ordinary Persian locks.

They number about 20,000 souls, and occupy the whole of the region between the Jarrahi on the east and the Karun on the west, from the confluence of the Haddam with the Gargar in the north to ’Ali-ibn-al-Husain on the Karun in the south. A few are found also on the right bank of the Karun.

The residence of the chiefShaikh is at Kut-al-’Amareh where he has a fort aod a house. The number of settled Bavleh is about 1,500 as against 18,000 who are nomads. They muster about 2,710 fighting men, of whom 920 are mounted on horses and 800 are armed with rifles, but in practice they can only put about 2,000 men in the field. With their allies, they pay 6,000 ttimans mdlldt to the Shaikh of Muhammareh. They claim descent from the Arab hero Muhalhal, and consider their ancestry superior to that of the Ka’b. Section.

A fertile valley in Luristan, south of the Kaleh Kuh range, and situated on the Kakulistan, or Basnui branch of the Ab-i-Diz. It is inhabittd by the Zallaki section of the Bakhtiari tribe, and is a remarkably pretty and well cared for spot. A stone fort in the middle of an open space, 1 mile in extent along one of the bends of the rivers, and pushing its way up two well-wooded ravines lying close together, is surrounded by a number of flat terraces, each large enough to contain an llidt family or small group, and each separated by a screen of fruit and other trees, giving shelter from wind and sun. These rows and cross-rows of trees, in which fig, pome granate, walnut, and poplar are seen, all stand by small rivulets of their own, and give the whole valley a remarkably well-cared for appearance. Itis the chief and winter resident of the Zallaki tribe. From June to August it is, on account of its low altitude of only 5,000 feet, disagreeably warm to ' those to whom the height of 9,000 feet to 10,000 feet is accessible in a few hours’ ride, but it would considered cool by all whose lot it is to summer in the plains of India. Snow occasionally falls in the valley, but does not lie, and in the autumn, winter, and spring it is said to be a charming resi dence. That it must have been considered so from time immemorial is evidenced by many things, especially by the remains of what must have been an exceedingly fine piece of architectural workmanship in the form of a stone bridge, and by the roads leading to it from all directions. The foun dations of the bridge are still standing in perfect condition. Built at a spot where the stream, 70 feet wide, rushes between good rock banks, these foundations are 72 feet apart, their river front is 30 feet,, and their depth (built up against the rock) varies from 6 to 20 feet—-constructed of stone and hard mortar faced by large stones cut exactly to the same size (about 16' X 20'), regularly fitted, and joining in a fashion which would be credit able to the best workmanship of the present day. On these two well- preserved foundations, rising 20 feet above the low level of the river, now stand only the remains of what w~ere once the buttresses of a centre arch of a 72-foot span, connected to the steep bank on either side by smaller arches of 20 to 30 feet span, traces of the bank ends being still visible. These remains, still 12 feet high, 25 feet wide, and 10 to 15 feet thick, built of stone and mortar, having lost the outer casing of cut stone, are now yearly becoming smaller, touched up by the weather, and encroached upon one side by the wood and wicker work bridge now joining the two banks. Whatever form the original stone arch may have had, it must have taken the road level at least 70 feet above the water, and made it an easy and comfortable approach. Whoever the original builders were, the remains show they possessed a good knowledge of building, and that this passage must have been one of importance to them. Roads lead up the river-bed to it from Dizful to either bank, though now and then they have to ascend a high spur, where the river passes through a steeply cut defile. These roads contina on either bank above the bridge and lead to the Gokun valley, and cne two passes leading into the Upper Bakhtiari country, namely, the Burd-i-Mlr Jamal and the Gal-i-Gav ; but the main road to the latter pass, after leaving the bridge, follows the watershed of a low range of hills, really a long spur from the Kuh-i-Rang, known as Chin-i-Kavar.— {Sawyer, 1890.) BAZUFT— Lat. 32° 8' N.; Long. 52° 9' E.; Elev. A district of Luristan, consisting of a well-wooded plain, abounding in ruins of Sassanian villages, and divided from the districts of Chehar Mahal and Isfahan by the Zardeh Kuh and the Kuh-i-Rang. Pasture and grain abundant. The village of the same district is about 135 miles from Shushtar, on one of the roads to Isfahan.— {Mackenzie.) BAZUFT (AB-I-) or RUDBAR— In the Bakhtiari country. The most important of the tributaries of the Karun river into which it flows some 10 miles below the Pul-i-’Amarat*BIZ-BEK 159 This river, which, at the point where they meet, has as great a volume as the Karim itself, rises in close proximity to the sources of the latter. The various streams or springs, from which the Bazuft has its origin, are the Ab-i-Susan, Ab-i-Taraz-Mauri, the several Chashmeh-i-LirkI Khan, Khan- Kushteh, Haft Tanan and, Gilishah ; all of these flowing down the southern or western slopes of the watersheds of the mountains from which they take their name. These unite in a main stream, after courses varying from 20 to 40 miles, at a point about 5,500 feet above sea-lbvel. After a run of a further 25 miles, during which many small streams join it, Kaleh Bazuft (5,300 feet), an old ruined fort on the right bank, is reached. The river is still fordable here. Passing then below the Gardan-i-Chari and joined by the waters of the Ab-i-MasI and Ab-i-Muvarz, it pursues its course past the overhanging Kuh-i-Isbianeh, and receives several additional streams from the Gurab valley. At 70 miles it makes the only considerable bend of its whole course, to clear the elbow of the mighty Garreh range, again resuming its normal and almost straight course south-east, and running through the deep valley between that range and the abrupt slopes of the Kuh-i-Balut and Kuh-i-Malvarl. Below the latter it is crossed by the Pul-i-’Amarat (for description see this Gazetteer, PuI-i-’Amarat), on the caravan road between Isfahan and Nasiri, at 120 miles from the former, and at 3,400 feet elevation. The bridge is a wire suspension bridge, built .in 1900 by Messrs. Lynch Brothers for the Bakhtiari Khans. It is a neat structure, 70 feet in length, supported by solid masonry piers and a lattice girder, with steel roadway and concrete flooring, 10 feet in width. It is laid about 160 feet above the level of the water, and kept in good order by regularly applied coats of paint. The caravanserai at Shalil lies about 1 | miles distant from the bridge and the left bank. Up*to this point the valleys through which the river has run are practically destitute of villages y though it is said to have contained some 360 in the olden days_before the •Afghan incursion. Just below the bridge it is joined by the Ab-i-Shalil, a fair sized stream just fordable in parts. After a further course of some 12 miles, with a few hamlets on either bank, and a ford just above the village of Raval, it plunges into the Karun near the village of Charkak, elevation 3,050 feet. The total length of its course by its zigzags may be set down at 120 miles.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.) BAZVAND RAMIANI— A tribe of the Tihran group of Luristan (q.vS). BEHA HASANI— Lat. Long. Elev.

BEHBEHAN Town— Lat. 39° 33' N.; Long. 50° 28' E.; Elev. 1,300'. A town in Ears, and the capital of the administrative division of the same name. It is situated 128 miles west-north-west of Shiraz and 43 miles north-north-east of Bandar Dilam, in an extensive plain watered by the Kurdistan or Marun river, from the banks of which it lies 3 miles south. Pt. I. **History.— Local tradition traces the name of the town to the settlers who came there after the destruction of Arljan. These people came and camped there in Illdt fashion in black goats-hair tents, called by them “ Bohuns, ” for which they gradually substituted mud houses which they said were £C Behtar-az-bohun ” (Lur better than tents). This appellation gradually by long usage became crystalised, through various stages, into its present form Behbehan, , Behbehan is a town of extremely ancient and probably of Sassanian origin, though it is difficult to say definitely to whom it owes its founda tion. It gained notoriety only after the destruction of Arijan and Kubad, which latter name, it may be of interest to note, was the name given to the bth Kureh or district at present represented by the Behbehan district, into which, in former times, Ears was divided, viz. Istakhr, Darabjird Shahpur. Ardashir and Kubad. We may say, however, with a due amount of cer tainty, that it existed prior to the 14th century, from the fact that Sharif- ud-Din ’Ali Yazdi mentions that Taimur camped at Behbehan when en route from Toster (Shushtar) to Kaleh Safid. In more recent times, during the Governorship of Mirza Kumu (circ. 1870), owing to his refusal’ to pay the taxes of Behbehan, the then Governor of Ears sent an expedition against Behbehan under the command of Mansur Khan, who attacked the town and put its inhabitants to the sword. Miraz Kumu himself, however, escaped and took refuge with the Ka’ab Arabs in the vicinity of’ FallahieK The latter are descendants of the Ban! Ka’ab Arabs who migrated from the Hejaz. In later years, the Behbehan Governorship has been, off and on, in the hands of the Bakhtiari Chiefs, the last occasion being during the winter of 1909-10, when Hias Khan, Bakhtiari, Sarum-ubMulk, son of Haji Khusru Khan, &amp;ardar-uz-Zafar, and Fath’AlI Khan, Bakhtiari, Salar-i-Muyid, son of Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i-Mufakham, held the Governorship for a few months, the former on behalf of the Ilkhanl, and the latter on behalf of the Haji Ilkhani family of the Bakhtiaris. On the departure of the Bakhtiari Gov ernors m the spring of 1910, Mirza ’All Riza, Bahadur-i-Divan, was appoint- ed Deputy Governor of Behbehan, which post he held almost continuously till beptembei 1912, when Amlr-i-Mujahid, Bakhtiari was appointed. He departed in May 1913. There is no sign of permanence in the Bakhtiari administration of Beh behan. Without their tribesmen, who will not stay there for 6 months in the year, the Khans cannot maintain themselves in the town. Moreover, experience shows that directly a powerful Governor-General of Ears is appointed, as in the case of H. R. H. Zil-us-Sultan in 1908, and Nizam-us- feultanch as late as 1911, he takes good care that the Behbehan Government is re-subordinated to himself and administered by his Deputy. Description. The town is some 3| miles in circumference, and is surrounded by a mud wall flanked with circular towers and bastions. The south-east corner is occupied by a castle called Kaleh Naranj. It is a place of no great strength, but has thick and lofty mud walls surrounded by a ditch. Its interior is small and confined, and not capable of containing a number of troops. It is defended by 5 or 6 rusty cannons and might successfully iesist the attack of undisciplined troops. None of these defences are men-BEH—BEH 161 tioned, by Gabriel, 1905. There are no pretentious houses ; the town is mostly in ruins and wears a dilapidated and poverty-stricken appearance. The streets are filthy with heaps of offal lying about, and there is no bazar worthy of the name. The Governor, in 1903, had a beatiful garden. Population. —The actual town of Behbeban is estimated to contain 4 .000 houses and to have a total population of 20,000 souls, of whom 2,000 would be armed men. Wilson in 1912 estimated the population at only 6.000 to 8 , 000 . In the town there are two parties, the Behbehanis and the Qanavatis, in the proportion of | of the former to £ of the latter ; the town being divided ' into two mahalehs corresponding to these parties. The Qanavat tribe originally came from Kufah in Turkey, and the head of the mahaleh in 5 1910 was Mlrza Ahmad, Shaikh-ul-Islam. The Behbehanis are neither Persians nor Arabs, but a kind of mixture of the two. The chief man among the Behbehanis in 1903 was Muhammad Mu’in-ul-Islam, who was formerly examiner in Persian and Arabic at Bombay for 10 years. He had a cousin called Saiyid Muntazir who had a trade connection with Bombay, and was said to be friendly to the English. In 1910 the head of the Behbehani mahaleh was Mirza ’Ali Riza. In 1910 there was a bitter feud between these two mahalehs, causing constant fighting and bloodshed. BEHBEHAN Province— Resources. — Trade. —Behbehan is an important town, being a concen trating and distributing centre for the caravan trade of the surrounding district. Owing to the lack of a proper bazar supplies of grain are, as a rule, scanty in the town» The Behbehan plain provides grazing for some 3.000 sheep and cattle, and except in years of drought, wheat is obtainable in the neighbourhood in large quantities, there are about 30,000 acres of irrigated and unirrigated land near the town. Wheat is the principal article of export. Bhif,sd also is obtainable in practically unlimited quantities. Water. —The water supply under present conditions is meagre and bad, being supplied by a small drain which also forms the favourite washing-place of the population. Drinking water is stored in db-ambdrs, and is brought from a distance of 6 miles. There are three tanks here measuring 50' X20' X 6 ' of covered masonry. Under a more energetic regime the town might be well supplied by qandts from the Marun river, where, also any force up to a division could obtain water. Transport. —Owing to the extensive caravan traffic, to which Behbehan is the centre, transport is generally available ; 2,500 good mules could pro bably be collected without much difficulty. Donkeys and cows 10,000,. horses 500, sheep 8,000. There are 300 to 400 mules of all descriptions working on the Bandar Dilam road from here, and mules are bred in the province; ; • Sufflies. property of the inhabitants of the town was in 1910 estimated to be 1,000 cows, 20,000 sheep and goats, 2,000 donkeys, 1,000 mares and 2,000 mules. (G/./aboVe fot transport available.) It is estimated that irrigated ground yields about 100-120 maunds of grain (wheat per khish (about 15 acres), and rice about 40 maunds per acre. p 2162 BEH-BEH Arls and Crafts. —The arts and crafts of Behbehan comprise tannery, working in German silver, making of givehs and malakis (Persian shoes), weaving of 'abbas (Arab and Persian cloaks), khurs and qiltms (woollen floor coverings, other than woollen carpets). Curzon said that mind work, i.e., enamelling in gold, still survived. The art of weaving woolled cloths, etcetera, for which Behbehan was famous in the days of Mirza Kumu, appears to have been lost and to exist no longer. Administration. —Behbehan is the seat of the Governor of the province, which is sometimes under the Ears Governor-Generalship ; but has recently (1912) been placed under the Bakhtiari Ilkhdni. The total annual assessment of the taxes of Behbehan is 7,000 tumdns, payable to the Central Government. Coinage. —The coinage in Behbehan is such as is current in Arabistan, the standard being the Krdn. The rate of Krdns per 100 rupees varies according to supply and demand, usually fluctuating between 345 and 375. Notes are not current, but T£ are accepted at varying rates of ex change. Rupee drafts on Bombay, payable at sight, are much sought after by the merchants of Behbehan who do a large trade with Bombay.

Of the inhabitants of the town about 2,000 would be armed, and, as Behbehan is a regular depot for arms in Southern Persia, the armament will be fairly modern. Communications. —The Persian telegraph line from Ahwaz to Borazjun passes through Behbehan. There is practically no traffic with Shiraz owing to the unsafeness of the road. Large and well-armed caravans are made up when necessary.— {J ones — Layard — Montieth — Stocqueler — Wells — Curzon — 1889—Hopkins 1903 — Gabriel, 1905 — Chick, 1910 — Ranking, 1910.) BEHBEHAN Province-— A province geographically belonging to Ears but having an administra tion and a governor of its own. For History see under Behbehan (Town). Geography. —It is bounded on the north by the mountains which separate Traq-i-’Ajami from the southern provinces of Persia ; east by Shulistan ; south by the Persian Gulf ; west by ’Arabistan. — The whole district is watered by numerous streams, the principal being the Shamsi, ’Arab, Khanabad, Marun and Rudkhaneh-i-Khalrabad which it will be noted is the same as the Ab-i-Shirin, and corresponds with the Hindian River, which is the Arosis of Nearchus. The province includes the plain of Behbehan, situated about 7 miles from the northern mountains, and 18 miles from the Zaidan hills. It is from 21 to 25 miles in length. The soil, particularly on this plain, is a rich, alluvial deposit, which is very fertile. The climate is so mild, that in January the meadows in the vicinity of the town are covered with narcissur, jappearing spread out like a white sheet several miles in circumference, and diffusing the most delicious fragrance. Population. —For population of the town, see under Behbehan (Town). The following list shows the villages in Behbehan, their owners and the number of houses in each.

The inhabitants of the province are mostly of the Kuhgalu and Mama- sani tribes {q.v.). There is also an admixture of other tribes, immigrants from other districts and unclassified people, a mixture of Persian and Arab blood, who are generally known collectively as Behbehanis. The following nine tribes are directly dependent on Behbehan :— (a) Bu Wall (—Abu ’ All) (b) Khwaja Almas. (c) Shaikh-i-Mamu Shaikh Qazimi. (d) Buir Ahmadi (Garmsiri). (e) Kushdas. (/) Baghdili.

ItEScfijRCES.—The soil, particularly in the plain, is a rich alluvial deposit, yielding in the neighbourhood of the town a return of twenty-four fold of corn. In 1910, 9,000 tons of wheat were grown, of which about 400 tons were surplus to local requirements. Near the Gulf, cotton and rice are the staple productions. Among the fruit-trees are the lemon, orange, pome granate, and plum ; of these the last takes precedence. Wild cabbage is the ordinary weed of the plain. The districts of Zaidan and Behbehan (near the town) could each of them support about a brigade in addition to their own population.

A Bakhtiari village, on the right bank of the stream of the same name situated on a small level plain at the south exit of the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash. A bridge of one pointed arch with a 30-foot span, made of stone and mortar, crosses the stream just above the village. It is sometimes made the intermediate stage between Kharaji (16 miles) and Du Pulan (8 miles) in preference to Ardal by caravans on the Isfahan-Nasiri road, when the route by the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash is utilised. Population 600. Supplies fair. Water abundant and good (coal reported h re).— (Arbuthnot, 1905.)BEEiSHTABAD (AB-I-)— In the Bakhtiari country. This stream is considered to be one of the main sources of the Karim river. It represents the drainage of the whole of the Chehar-Mahal and has itself three principal sources. These are the Ab-i- Junaqan, the Ab-i-Jehan Bin and the Ab-i-Shalamzar. The first named rises in the mountains enclosing the western extremity of the Chehar-Mahal, and runs an east by south-easterly course of some 30 miles. The second has its origin in the range in continuation of the Kuh-i-Rukh, and waters many of the chief villages of the plateau, such as Zanian, Deh-i-Kurd, Shamsabad and Kharaji. It winds across the level plain until it enters the Tang-i-Kha- rajl where it is crossed by a well-built brick bridge with a ten-foot roadway and a fifty-foot span, 2 miles before reaching the village of that name. A second similar bridge, somewhat narrower^ crosses it at the south end of the village. To the last named place its course is south by south-east and thence south-west; its_total run being about 50 miles before its junction with the third, the Ab-i-Shalamzar, some 8 miles south-west of Kharaji. It is crossed by a third well-built masonry bridge immediately before the junction. The third source rises in the eastern extremity of the Zirreh range, and not far from Chiglia Khur. It runs a north-westerly course of some 25 miles through the villages of Shalamzar—where it is bridged by a narrow brick structure—and Dastaneh before mixing with the Ab-i-Jehan Bin. These two streams, after uniting, run a further course of 8 miles before reaching the Ab-i-Junaqan in the early portion of the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash. The stream thus formed, and which is just barely fordable at this point, now cuts its way almost due south through this remarkable gorge (vide Gazet- teer-Tang-i-Darkash Warkash), and becomes a rushing torrent by a fall of some 600 feet within the next 6 miles. It then issues from the gorge and passes under the bridge at Bahishtabad. This structure is of stone and mortar, of one pointed arch with a 30-foot span. Its roadway is not wide enough for any kind of cant, but the gorge is quite strong enough to permit of a wider superstucture of wood or other material. After a further course ot 2 miles, or in its longest branch of some 70 miles in all— it runs into the Kuh-i-Rang source of the Karun river.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.)

The plain extends from the Ab-i-Kuvnak on the west to the right bank of th Karun on the east, a breadth of some 16 miles, and a depth varying from 4 to 8 miles, roughly some 100 square miles. The mountains of Laristan rise abruptly from the plain, and from its northern boundary. The range immediately bounding the plain is called the Kuh-i-Var Zard (vide this Gazetteer). During the winter months, when the Bakhtiarl Khans are in camp on it, the village contains a population of some 1 , 200 , irrespective of the con siderable gathering of tribesmen in camp. Their flocks and herds at this season are also considerable ; but they, as well as the greater part of the inhabitants, are moved up to the ydildqs, or summer quarters, before the weather gets hot.

The princicipal place in the Dashtistan district of Fars, and the seat of the Khan who, under the Governor of Fars, rules the greater part of that district, Borazjun is situated about 28 miles north-east of Bushire town. History .—The ruling family of the Khans are descended from a certain Mulla Muhammad, who came from the district of Kam Firuz, became a servant of the then dynasty, married the Khan’s daughter, and became chief in Borazjun. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh some years ago took over the government from his aged father. He and his father have acquired great wealth from black mail on the caravans passing through Borazjhn, especially from monopolies of the sale of grain to animals. He had to take to the Giseh Khan moun tains when Ijlal-ud-Dauleh, the Wazir of Fars, attacked the chief of Dash tistan, but returned later. He is maried to a daughter of Isma’il Khan of Shabankareh, but the bitterest blood-feud reigns between him and this Khan on account of the district of Zira, which formerly was farmed by one of the Khans of Borazjun, but has for 15 years been let by Nizam-us-Sultaneh to theBOR—BOR 177 Khan of Shabankareh. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh has repeatedly tried to have his father-in-law evicted and himself given the lease. Constant bloodshed goes on between Shabankareh, Zira and Borazjun on these accounts, and raids are common. A further cause of hostility was his seizure and impri sonment, in the autumn of 1911, of his cousin Mirza ’Ali Khan and the latter’s sons on a charge of conspiracy : Mirza ’Ali Khan’s sister being wife of Isma’Il Khan of Shabankareh. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh has been noted for his oppression of caravans ; and for his hostility to the British. He probably commands some 800 rifles. Outwardly fair spoken, he is a difficult man with whom to deal, he is the most noted buyer of, and dealer in, smuggled arms and am munition among the headmen of the Bushire littoral and hinterland. General description .—Borazjun stands on the plain of Dashtistan, at an elevation of 250 feet above the sea and dominated by the lofty crests of the Gisakau Mountain, less than 10 miles to the estward ; it is surrounded by date groves which are most extensive upon the west side. The ordinary houses are poor, but there is a fine stone-built serai with loopholed walls, commanding the town and capable of being utilised as a fort; it was in fact in 1906 occupied by a Persian military detachment, and high Persian officials passing through Borazjun treat it is as residence. The town is not a place of strength, being commanded by hills from the east, which would be the best direction from which to approach. The town contains several religious shrines of slight importance. Population. —400 houses. Population, 3,500. Livestock 3,000. The only prominent tribes are the Paparis, who have dominated the place since they expelled the original bag-owners less than a century ago ; the Qaidan, also comparatively recent immigrants from other places ; and some Saiyids. The remainder of the townspeople are a medley of immi grants from other places, such as Bushiris, Dashtis, Khistis and Kazarunis. The standard of civilization is higher at Borazjun than is usual in the coast districts about Bushire, but the inhabitants avoid needless display of well being and even allow their houses to remain untepaired, lest the Persian Government should be tempted to quarter a high official permanently among them ; at the same time their attitude to the Government is said to be rather defiant. The opium habit is very prevalent. Cultivation of wheat, barley, dates, jou'dri, and peas. Water from wells and db-ambdrs. Irrigation from wells and the Dalaki ndld. Caravanserai with turrets at the four corners, suitable of mounting guns and easily defensible. Accommodation for a battalion of infantry and a regiment of cavalry. Well in courtyard. Bdld-khdneh for officers. Good stabling. Persian telegraph office in the serai. Serai commands the whole town. In 1909 Governor was Mirza Muhammad Khan. Supplies for a brigade obtain able. About 500 mules pass through daily. There is a British (E.T.D.) telegraph office. Inhabitants are all Shi’ahs. —(Sultan Muhammad, 1909.) Trade, resources and supplies .—There are no local manufactures, but the bazar contains about 170 shops. Borazjun depends upon dates and agri culture and upon the transit through it of the Shiraz and upcountry trade. About 300 mules belonging to Borazjun are employed on the Shiraz route. Q 2Borazjun is the only trade centre in Dashtistan and its trade is consequent ly an epitome of the trade of the district. The exports all go to Bushire, and comprise wheat, barley, beans, melons, tobacco, gum, wool, firewood, charcoal and lime ; the imports for the consumption of the town and dis trict are chiefly prints, rice, coffee, sugar, tea, opium and spices and are from Bushire. The water supply is from deep wells and is reported to be good and abundant ; but it has been said that though pleasant to the taste, it is apt to cause diarrhoea or colic to travellers. Excellent water can be procured from the hills a few miles to the east of Borazjun. The currency of the town is Persian, chiefly silver krdns ; the man of Borazjun is equal to about 18 lbs. 11 oz. English, giving a Hashim man of 139 lbs. English. Administration. —Borazjun, though at present farmed with its depen dencies by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, belongs to the Government of Ears and is the seat of the Khan who administers the greater part of the Dashtistan district ; he is not himself a Papri but belongs to a tribe called Maiman. A Deputy Governor also resides here on behalf of the Governor- General of Ears. The Indo-European Telegraph Company’s line from Bushire to Shiraz passes through Borazjun, and is connected at this place with the Persian Government telegraph by Bandar Rig, Bandar Dilam, Behbehan and Ahwaz to Shushtar and Dizful.

It is bounded on the north by the river Rudhilleh form Haft Jush, where it meets Angal territory, to Durudgah, and thence by the Daliki or Shur River to some few miles past Buneh Mirza. The boundary with Daliki is about 3 miles past Qaraul Khan, at a sulphur stream crossing the caravan road, and this boundary line then mounts to the summit of the hills. East, the boundary is along the summit of the Giseh Khan range past Kuh-i-Bagh-i-Taj. South, the boundary crosses the entrance to the Haft Mulla ravine, south of Nanizak and Jamileh : between Sarkurreh and Sami and Gulangun in Tangistan : then north of Bulfariz and Gandumriz in Tangistan : north of Ab-i-Tavil in Chahkutah and south of Tsavand. West, the boundary is north-east from Tsawand, Nokal being in Angali and Jarrafi in Borazjun, to Haft Jush. Resources. —The district is entirely agricultural, a quantity of tobacco being produced besides grain. Administration. —The mdlidt of Borazjun is 5,300 tumdns : the revenue of the Khan is said to be some 16,000 tumdns by taxation of land under cultivation, and 20,000 tumdns, from rahddri, alafi and the taxation of caravans, besides sale of monopolies of gum, etc. Communications. —There are paths, practicable for lightly laden animals, up the Giseh Khan range (i) by Lardeh, (ii) by Khurmi to the foot of the Kuh-i-Bagh Taj, whence the track is too difficult for animals. The Bagh-i- Taj crest is known by several names : from east to west Kamar-i-Zardak, Kamar-i-Shainahu, Kamar-i-Dubareh, Kamar-i-Bardisar. The two last paths to the top of the crest are Rah-i-Kardak, and Rah or Puk-i-Bariki.— {Chick, 112). BRAICHEH— A small canal in the Falahieh district of Southern ’Arabistan, on the right bank of the river Jarrahi, with which it connects.

BUIR AHMADT— The Buir Ahmadi belong to the Chehar Banicheh group of the Kuhgalu and are classed as Pusht-i-Kuh. History. —Tribal tradition says that they are descended from Malik-ut- Tujjar, Isfahani. One of their best known and most powerful chiefs was Karim Khan, who died in 1907. Since then the tribe has been split up, each faction following a different leader, with the inevitable result that the various factions are constantly at war with each other. In the autumn of 1909 the tribe was split up as follows part with Shukrullah Khan, part with the lineal descendants of Karim Khan, part with Qaid Muhammad ’Ali and the remainder with Mulla Kubad. Of these, Shukrullah Khan’s following is the largest ; but the actual strength of the various factions is constantly changing as one party chief changes his allegiance from one to the other. With regard to external relations, they were friendly with the Dushman Ziari and Bavi, but enemies with the Taiyibi. In November 1909 the tribe carried out a carefully planned raid on the Russian Consul General’s caravan, in conjunction with the Kashkuti under Muhammad’Ali Khan. During 1911 and 1912, when the Bushire -Shiraz-Isfahan route was a con stant scene of robberies, it was the Buir Ahmadi who were responsible for most robberies near the Urchini pass, andthey used to penetrate even as far as the Isfahan-Yazd road. They acquired so much power in this district that the Governor of Abadeh actually appointed them guardians of part of this road at end of 1912. In December 1912 Buir Ahmadis were suspected of co-operating with the Mamasanis and Kashkutis in the attack which resulted in Captain Eckford’s death near Khan-i-Zinian. Country. —The boundaries of land inhabited by them are :—Ludab, Sar Rud, Rudkhaneh-i-Sa’adat, Sa’adat-i-Shaikh Abil. Their winter quarters are Sunkarabad, Kalat, Deh Dasht, and Suk-i- Changalvar, and their summer quarters Chinar, Sar Rud. Lands along the lower slopes of the Kuh-i-Dima (Dinar ?). They own the following forts :—Kaleh-i-Chanar, inhabited by Qaid Muhammad’Ali; Kaleh-i-Sisakhti inhabited by Mulla Kubad ; Kaleh-i- Sar Rud, inhabited by Shukrullah Khan ; Kaleh-i-Tal-i-Khusru inhabited by Ghulam Husain Khan ; Kaleh-i-Kalayar, inhabited by Muhammad Khan; Kaleh-i-Fashiun inhabited by a Saiyid Dal, Kaleh-i-Azu, inhabited by Azizullah Khhn ; Kaleh-i-Dil, inhabited by Nasrullah Khan. Ethnography. — As a tribe, they own much land and, for Iliat, are wealthy.Bt}l—BtJL 181 The following table shows the sub-divisions (Lur : Taslt) into which the Buir Ahmadi are split up :— Ta Muradi (Lur : Ta or Tata, a brother) Kurrai.

Saiyid-i-Baba Muhammadi. ’Amalajat. The Buir Ahmadi, in all number 4,500 families ( 22,000 souls). Trade. —The chief trade of the Buir Ahmadi is with Ardakan and, to a small extent, with Behbehan, from which latter place they get most of their arms and ammunition, though a small amount is also obtained from Ardakan. Most of the fruit which supplies the Behbehan market is grown in their territories. Military.—The Buir Ahmadi are capable of putting about 600 horsemen and 1,000 footmen into the field. They are brave and warlike, and make good fighting men. It is for the footmen, however, that they are best known, being noted for their mobility,and credited with the power of marching 80 miles a day. They are also noted for the audacity of their raids ; their principal raiding grounds being near Khan-i-Zinian, and near Shulgistan. Chick says, “ They live in small fortresses in the mountains east of Beh behan, where they have supplies of provisions and water. The passes to their strongholds are inaccessible, and it would cost the Governor of Shiraz a very considerable sum to capture even a few of them. Divided into many hostile factions, some of which have (1910) allied themselves with the Bakhtiari. In the plains it is said that one Qashqal tufangchi is worth Bakhtiaris. ” Chick also gives their numbers as 7,000 riflemen ; but it is hardly possible that so many could be collected together. Communications. —The main roads leading from the Buir Ahmadi terri tories are to Behbehan via Tang-i-Tikau ; to Ram Hormuz, via Linda and Likak ; and to Ardakan through their own country.

It is fed by two small streams, the Ab-i-Jalal and the Sard-Ab, near ’Ala Khurshid, and by several others later in its course of seme 30 miles south-east and east. It then makes a bend to the south, leaving the plain of Tuleh to the west, and flows past Ramuz, finally emptying itself into the Jarrahi river, about 15 miles south of that place after a total course of some 60 miles. Near Ramuz it runs m a bed half a mile wide of shingle and boulders, with a breadth of 70 yards and a depth of 3 feet, and with a strong current .—(Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905 — Arbuthnot, 1905.) BULDAGlR vide CHIGHA KHUR and BULDAJl. BULDAJI —Lat. 31° 57' N. ; Long. 51°12' E.; Elev. A village of 400 huts in the Chehar Maha 1 district, 13 miles east of Chighakhur. It is situated at the junction of two valleys, one from Chighakhur, the other frem Gahrud. The two valleys are separated by a slight ridge, on which is the imdmzddeh of Hanifa ’All. Here the roads meet from Isfahan via Safid Dasht, and from the same via Shalamzar ; also the roads from Burujan and Ganduman. About 4 miles east of Chigha khur, a rocky spur is reached, and a dam holding up a large body of water. When the water is low it is possible to get round the spur in shallow water, otherwise a very steep and difficult path, about 100 feet high, has to be followed. The village of Buldaji is watered by channels from this dam. There are also several small springs of drinking water. Around and in the broad valley is much corn land (reaped at the end of August) ; there are some willows, but no other trees. To the south are the rums of a well-built Armenian village, whose inhabitants evacuated it in 1902 and moved into the neighbourhood of Gandaman. The village is well suited for defence. The walls are strong and the houses loopholed. There are several towers. Part of the village is a fort-like enclosure. A vast number of sheep are pas tured here in summer, moving towards Ram Hormuz at the end of August. Some 10,000 of these belong to refugees from the Qashqal tribes of Ears. The soil in the vicinity is alluvial and, as seen when eroded by irrigationchannels, is of considerable depth.— (Sawyer, 1890 — Burton, 1903 — Lonmer, 1906.)

BUNVAR (2)— Lat. 32° 25' N.; Long. 48° 22' E. ; Elev. A group of villages in the Dizful district of Southern ’Arabistan, begin ning about 6 miles west of Dizfiil town on the road to Pa-i-Pul and ’Am- areh. The villages stand on level ground on the right bank of the Bala Rud, and each is surrounded by trees ; the principal are Banwar Nazir, Du- bandar Mian Chughan Kaleh-i-Haji ’All and Kaleh Nau. The population is mixed, part being Dizfulis, part Arabs, part Sagasand Lurs and part a Kurdish section called ? Amaleh Karim Khan from the name of their head man, who is connected by marriage with the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh : these miscellaneous ingredients have not yet become properly fused, and the result is a community weaker for offence and defence than might have been expected of their numerical strength, which is said to be about 3,000 fighting men with the ordinary proportion of rifles. All are engaged in agricultural or pastoral occupations. They own large flocks of sheep and herds of buffaloes and cattle, and dispose of the produce in Dizful town: they grow wheat, rice, millet and mash, besides fruits, including apri cots, pomegranates, grapes, oranges, limes and dates : they also sapply Dizful town with firewood from the Karkheh river. Water is abundant and is brought from the Diz river by a small canal which takes off on the rmht bank at the Dizful bridge ; the Bala Rud, when in flood, adds its quota to the irrigation of the village lands, and a large canal from the Kar kheh, called the Harmushi, brings water close up to the settlement. Food and forage are plentiful, and about 300 or 400 mules are owned here. Banvar, though near to Dizful, is practically independent and pays no revenue to the Persian Government ; but the disunited population, though they shelter themselves behind the name of Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, suffer much from depredations of the Sagwand Lurs as well as of the Kinaneh and Khasraj sections of the Ban!

The valley is highly cultivated, with abundant water from a good stream. Supplies of all kinds are available. The village has a consider able lazdr, belonging chiefly to Saiyids attached to Agha Najafi of Isfahan. The government only is in the hands of the Bakhtiari to whom it has at times caused some trouble. The population is about 3,000. Many of these are chdrvdddrs or mule owners, and it is claimed that they own some 2,000 mules between them.

Geography and Climate.— A torpedo-shaped promontory lying parallel to the coast of the Persian district of Tangistan at a distance of 4 or o miles ; the intervening space is occupied by a grass and reed grown swamp or mashileh, across which runs a caravan route to the mainland. Extent. —The peninsula measures exactly 12 miles from its north-west tip, on which stands Bushire town, to Ras Hallleh at the opposite end. The maximum breadth at about midway is about 3| miles. The peninsula is bounded by the sea on north, west and south ; on the east it is bounded by the mashileh. Physical features and vegetation. —The site of Bushire town is rocky and slightly elevated above the sea, but immediately south of it a strip of very low ground runs across the peninsula from coast to coast ; beyond this low strip the ground begins to rise again, and the remainder of the peninsula is a sort of turtle back, attaining a maximum elevation of 150 feet in the centre at Imamzadeh village. There is a stretch of low cliff along the coast at the south-west corner of Bushire town and again in the neighbourhood of Rishahr. The low parts of the peninsula are sandy, the higher of firm, arable soil. Here and there a little grass is to be found. An occasional her and tamarisk are the only natural growing trees ; but the babul and cypress are found ; also a tree with yellow flowers. Climate. —The hottest month in Bushire is August and the coldest months are January and February ; in summer the thermometer has been known to rise to 115.5 degrees F. The worst period is between the 20 th of July and the 15th of September, when the temperature seldom rises above 100, but the difference between the wet and the dry bulb readings is sometimes only 2 degrees.Tlie average monthly rainfall for the five years ending 31st December 1S06 was as follows :— January ........ February. ....... March ........ April ........ May, June, July, August, September and October. November ....... December ....... 1 -23 at average 6 days per month. 0 73 „ „ 5 „ „ 0'61 „ „ 5 „ „ 0 45 „ „ 3 „ „ Nil. 1-72 at average 4 days per month. 2'58 ,, ,, 5 ,, , r „ During 1909-1912 th^ average annual rainfall was about 15 inches. It will be seen from the above that most of the rainfall takes place in November, December, January and February, which may be said to consti tute the rainy season. These four months are intermittently stormy and cold on shore, the sea being rough. It seldom actually freezes, but the ther mometer occasionally falls almost to freezing point. Fires are almost a necessity in December, January and February and welcome after sundown until the end of March. In March and April the rainfall is usually in the foim of brief showers, the sky remaining otherwise clear. The heat on the high parts of the peninsula is less oppressive than in the town. The best seasons for movements of troops through Bushire are (1) from 15th March to 30th April; (2) from 1st October to 30th November. From May 1st till the beginning of October the heat of the first 60 miles from the coast is excessive, while from December till February the cold on the plateau is intense. Prevailing winds. —The prevailing winds are the Shamdl or north-west, and Kaus, which blows from the south-east. The former prevails at sea for nearly nine months of the year, and blows very cold and boisterous in the winter months, a Shamdl or “ Nor’-wester ” lasting usually three days. The same wind blows almost incessantly during June and July, and though then less violent, relieves the temperatur-e near the coast. At this season it is called locally the “ 40 days’ winds. ” Health. —The sanitary condition of Bushire is bad, for the soil is riddled with cess-pools which are seldom cleaned out; yet the place is not unhealthy. Malarial fever is the most prevalent disease amongst the native population. Ophthalmia and other eye diseases are rife, caused by flies, dust glare, and the insanitary habits of the people. Plague sometimes visits the place during the early summer. In 1911 there were 118 cases and 97 deaths between the end of April and beginning of July. Population.— The inhabitants of the peninsula, exclusive of Bushire town, number about 8,500 souls and belong to mixed tribes. For further 'particulars see under Bushire Town. Resoukces. —For Trade see under Bushire town. Water .—The water of the town is bad. Almost every house has a well but the liquid which it yields is bitter ; about 10 per cent, of the houses are provided with reservoirs. The better class obtain their drinking water from Bahmani, Andar Bandar, Dahmiru and Bujikdan or Gunjashkdan, places in the Peninsula at a considerable distance from the town ; but even this water is slightly brackish and cannot be drunk with impunity by people who are not accustomed to it. The present European ^p^iulation, usually, Pt. I. ! R192 BUS—BUS either distil the local water or obtain water from ships. Wells are very numerous all over the Peninsula, but the following are among the most im portant. 1 The wells called “Bahmani” just outside the Malik’s house at Rlshahr; these run almost dry in the hot weather. These are one of the chief sources of .drinking water for men. 2. The Andar Bandar (“ Oonder Boonder ”) wells (under the telegraph line and about 2| miles east of Malik’s, house). These are said to be inex haustible, and are used freely by the inhabitants, who carry away water on donkeys. There are 6 wells, and the water is about 15 feet below the surface, and is very deep. 3 . Wells at “ Tangak ” the property of Katkhudd Zahir ’Ali, near the Mashileh, about If miles east of Sabzabad Residency, and If miles south east of “Oonder Boonder. ” These wells are also said to be inexhaustible and not so brackish as the others. 4. Shallow wells near the beach at Bandar Halileh, which are fairly sweet, and always contain water. There appears to be no shortage of water for animals. The horses and mules of the 39th Central India Horse at the Malik’s house in 1911-13 were watered, from a well just outside the south wall of the Malik’s house, which contains 20 feet of water, and apparently never diminishes. While the British Indian detachment of about 300 men was at Bushire (1911-13) arrangements were made by the provision of forty-one 400-gallon tanks to provide for a possible failure of the local supply of water. It was intended that water should be sent up from Karachi by British India steamers transferred in Bushire harbour to 400-gallon tanks on lighters, which would be taken to Rishahr, where the water would be pumped into other tanks on shore, and conveyed thence by donkeys daily to tanks in the Malik’s house. There was, however, no necessity found for putting this arrange ment into operation, as the troops, including British Officers, drank the water from the Malik’s house wells, and from the Andar Bandar wells. Agriculture.—k large proportion of the peninsula consists of arable land, which in part is cultivated by means of wells and in part by rainfall. The ordinary crops are wheat and barley, sown about December and reaped after 4 months (April-May). In places there are date groves, but not of thriving appearance. There are quantities of grapes and many other fruits grown. Vegetables of all sorts are grown except potatoes. ^ The amount of arable land under cultivation on the peninsula is about 200 gan, each ga7i producing 5 to 60 cwt, say 60 tons, altogether, in the proportion of about 5 to 2 wheat and barley. Much wheat and barley comes to Bushire from the surrounding district for export, and it is estimated that amounts varying from 150 maunds to 500 maunds of wheat, and from 100 to 350 maunds of barley, depending on the time of year, would be purchasable at any particular moment. If the crops are good, there would tie between 800 and 1,000 tons of corn available. In 1910-11 the export of grain through Bushire was 2,571 tons ; but in 1911-12 as much as 14,738 tons was exported, over § of which went to the United Kingdom and \ to Germany.BUS—BUS 193 ( 2 - 00 / In 1856 a force of 4,000-5,000 with 1,000 horses lived on the country for two or three months. A demand for rations for 400 Indians could probably be met at any time, and in 1911, at a fortnight’s notice the naval contractor, Mr. Gulzad, pro duced about 80 maunds of flour. For a force of anything over one batta lion it would be necessary to ship a month’s supply from India, and give a month’s warning for supplies in Bushire. There are no mills in Bushire, excepting small hand mills, and some mills worked by animals. Supplies {for cereals see above.) —Meat, rice, vegetables, ghi, dates and fish are procurable in the bazaars. Sheep and goats are plentiful on the peninsula, but oxen are scarce and small. Fish are caught in large quan tities (sometimes about 5 tons in a day), and are more plentiful in winter than in summer. Milk is not drunk and is difficult to obtain. Bread and soda water are not procurable. Fuel —Firewood is usually cut in October and November, in the hills east of Borazjun, and collected for consumption in Bushire and the neigh bouring villages. This supply lasts from October to February or March ; but then it ceases, and Bushire becomes dependent upon supplies brought up the coast by boat from Kangan, Tahiri, etc., etc. From April to Septem ber, therefore, special arrangements are necessary for collecting large sup plies of fuel. Charcoal is in general use ; but it is not stored. There are no coal depots, except private ones for the Royal Navy, the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Arab S. S. Company ; nor are there any large oil depots. Fodder .—There is scarcely any land left for grazing at Bushire, but hay and fodder are brought in as required from the neighbouring districts, where the inhabitants store it. In a rainless season there may be no fodder, but in a good one 500 animals could be fed for a month. Mules go out to Ahmadi both for grazing and water. The local fodder is chopped straw to which animals take some time to get accustomed. Transport. —The only forms of transport are mules, camels and donkeys. Mules .—Chiefly mule transport must be relied on for transport up the Post Road. The number available varies according to the time of year, the amount of traffic on the Shiraz Road, and the state of public feeling. Eight hundred mules arrived in Bushire on the “ Nau Ruz ” about 21st March (1912) : 500 mules arrive fairly frequently. Mules working on the Bushire-Shiraz Post Road in normal times are said to be between 2,000 to 3,000 at least. There were 1,500 on the road when the Central India Horse arrived in November 1911, and there were very unfavourable conditions then prevail ing. Mules in any numbers would be best procured by the assistance of the civil authorities, through a broker, who sends out along the road and en gages them en route to Bushire. It would take probably two to three days under ordinary circumstances to procure 500 mules. The amount of transport ordinarily present at or near Bushire may be estimated at 250 to 300 mules when the Shlf route is closed, but when it is open there are none. r 2104 Bt)S—BtJS The Persian mules are strong sturdy animals, carrying an average weight of 320 lbs ; if engaged “ by weight ” they carry up to 400 lbs. Their loads should be placed high for the Shiraz Road. The owners do not require much persuasion if engaged through the usual channels, and if good hire is given ; they might, however, fear risks. The muleteers themselves arrange for food for their mules. Camels. Camels come in frequently in small numbers, 40-50 from the surrounding neighbourhood up to 30 miles or so. They do not go up the Post Road to Shiraz. They can be obtained at a few days’ notice up to about 400. Rudhilleh owns 400, and the numbers estimated as available from Dashti and Tangistan are considerably higher. A camel carries only 320 lbs. Donkeys. Donkeys are easily obtained for local work in Bushire, they carry 160 lbs., they do not work on the Shiraz Post Road, but are said to work on the Firuzabad road. Horses. Horses suitable as chargers are difficult to obtain, and no re mounts are available. Military. Defences. —The town of Bushire on the land side has a wall 30' high and 5 ' to 6 ' thick, pierced for musketry ; otherwise there are no defences except a deserted redan at Rishahr. The peninsula can be defended from the interior, by occupying a ridge which rises 100 feet above the road level, on the western side of the Mashlleh. There are no defences against a landing, and the only fort on the peninsula, that at Rishahr, is in disrepair. Infantry. —Nominally the Governor of Biishire has at his disposal a force of one battalion of regular infantry and 50 artillery men. In reality, in 1912, owing to want of money he had not a man upon whom he could call. In Mav 1911. 300 sarbazes arrived from Shiraz to replace the force which had deserted owing to non-receipt of pay the previous August. These took bast demanding pay, at different times during 191 land 1912 at the British Residency, and at the Turkish Consulate. The Infantry is armed with the Werndl rifle, 310 of which are in use and 560 in store. There were also 280 Werndl rifles in the Customs in 1911, with 17,000 cartridges. In addi tion there were 2,000 rounds in issue and 13,000 in store. Artillery.—The artillery at Bushire consists of 36 gunners with 4 small breech-loading guns, 14 muzzle-loading guns of obsolete pattern (some unmounted), 2 breech-loading guns, mounted on carriages and 2 howitzers. These last four are at the Governor’s palace of Chehar Burj, which faces on to the Khur SultanI ; but they are of little value, as in 1912 they were rusty. There is a certain amount of ammunition for these, including 200 - shells for the breech-loading guns. These are 15 semi-irregular sowars. The Governor’s power at sea is represented by the “ Perse'polis, ” a gun boat of 600 tons and 450 horse power, having an extreme speed of 6 knots, and earrving 6 guns and 24 Snider rifles. It is usually unfit to put to sea. British Consular Guard. —The detachment of Indian Infantry at Bushire, 1 Indian officer and 58 men, is divided between Bushire town, Sabzabad and Rishahr. There are also 9 Indian Cavalry. The extra troops landed inMMmemmmmmmmmmmmrn ■MyHMHMnwaiB BUS—Btrs 195 1911 and 1912 (about 300 men) were housed at Malik-ut-Tujjar’s house at Rishahr. Harbour. —Bushire is situated on a bay, the entrance to which measured in a north-westerly direction from Bushire town to the nearest part of the Rudhilleh coast, is 5 miles in width. The greater part of the bay is very shallow, and a large part of it is occupied by mud flats. Anchorage. —The innermost anchorage for vessels of moderate draught is at the head of a channel called Khur Daireh, and is situated in the middle of the entrance of the bay. It lies nearly 3 miles north-north-west of the town, and is sheltered on the north-west by a submerged sandbank called Baq’at-al-’Ali, while on the south-east it is joined by a long narrow wall of sand called Lakfeh only 1 to 3 feet below water. The holding ground in the Khur Daireh is good and the soundings 3 to 4 fathoms, but the approach in many places has only 15 to 17 feet of water at high water, and 11 feet at low water. The deepening of a channel across this bar would be costly. There are no fixed moorings, but there are two gas-buoys which, together with a guiding light on the British Residency, are maintained by the British Government. The inner anchorage has space for about 15 vessels of the B. I. type. In a shamdl the sea becomes rough even here. The outer anchorage, which is unprotected from either a shamdl or a sharqi wind, is five miles from the town and affords unlimited space in about 5 fathoms. There are no dangerous currents or tides in Bushire bay ; the tide rises and falls from 4 to 7 feet only. Landing. —There is no pier or wharf where steamers can come alongside, and all landing has to be carried out in boats. The transference of horses, men, and stores to boats is possible all through the year, for B. I. steamers and others call regularly at Bushire ; but, if a shamdl w 7 ere blowing, the transference might be delayed a day or two. (See climate.) The coast is shelving, and generally sandy, but rocky in places, and cliffs run from the south end of the town for about half-a-mile to the south, thence no more cliffs till Rishahr (5^ miles). The following places afford facilit’es for landing. 1. Customs wAar/.—Both this place and Pudar landing place are approach ed by the Khur Sultanl, a deep creek about 200 yards broad, wdiich runs past the east side of the town in a south-easterly direction towards the Mashileh. It is unfortunately divided from the inner anchorage by a bank If miles broad, on which the soundings are only 5 to 6 feet. A canal through this bank might be dredged without much difficulty. At Pudar, If miles above the town, the creek, which has soundings of over 20 feet and is completely sheltered, forks ; one branch continues south-east to Mashileh, wdiile the other, called Khur Shakari, bearing at first to the north-east, sweeps round in a great semi-circle and eventually joins the bay at its northern end. On this creek, near the place where it opens again into the bay, is Shif (q.v.), a landing-place for travellers in the interior. Between the curving creek and the open bay is a mass of mud fists and low islands. The Customs wharf is f mile long, faced with stone, and is situated about the centre of the town. It boasts only one crane, not m good order, and has no tram lines, though there is a suitable alignment for them along the sea shore. Large covered godowns are situated within 50 yards of’ the wharf.BUS—BtjfS Sea-going craft of 150 tons can come up the Khur Sultani, and get alongside th 2 Mar.—A good firm sandy beach, no sudden shelving, suitable for landing horses. In 1911 the Central India Horse landed their horses here by heeling the boats over, and making the horses jump. It is always shel tered and is near a site for a temporary camp. 3. British Town Residency. -There is a stretch of sandy beach here. 4. Russian Consuhte.-Ooee to the town, conspicuous ; not possible m rough weather ; and, except at very high tides, is too shallow for the bigg '“TfiTsMr {Daslak).-There is a sheltered creek, below the Cable House where there is a natural landing place for infantry. On account of a bar across the creek, however, boats of large draught cannot enter, ft mi ^ be possible to blow a gap in this bar. If a southerly wind be blowing a landing cannot be effected here. There is “good covering Po sl * ™ 79th Carnatics landed here in 1911, and the 39th Central In in April 1913, embarked their horses here. 6 HaUkh.-ln fine weather this is a fair landing place; but with a southerly wind landing would be impossible. The British army land here in 1866, as opposition was anticipated; but under other condit it has no advantages to compensate for its distance from ® us b™ n ® ou of Halileh for about a mile there are too many coral rocks cr &lt; PP S P at low tide to allow of landing; but north of Halileh fishing boats come close to the shore and landing is possible.

In 1911 Gray, Paul and Company provided 6 medium-sized lighters for ing of the Central India Horse. All lighters would require adaptation f use in lightering animals and Bushire can neither provide carpenters, th W“eal^ n o ki pa g rt icular facilities for the construction of temporary landing stages ; and, except for a very small amount of timber, would be the only material available.There are about 1,000—1,500 Dashtis who unload vessels, but during spring and in August and September they are scarce. Crews tor the lighters are sometimes difficult to obtain. _ Camping Ground.— The best place for a camp of any size, say tor a brigade or larger force, is near the centre of the peninsula, south ot LuJ, near the Imamzadeh (c/. No. 2 below). This site has the advantages of bein^ easily defended, having water for animals close at hand and containing adequate space. The surface, however, is rather stony, and the distance to any landing place is considerable (2| to 3 miles). The following list shows the various sites where a force ot about a brigade could encamp :— Site and landing place. 1. Pudar. About 1£ miles south-east of Bushire town. The 39th Central India Horse, on first arrival, en camped on this site. Landing at Pudar (on the camp itself) or at Russian Con sulate or Cus toms wharf. 2. LuL.

From the Rishahr office three land lines run across the peninsula to the coast and thence to Shiraz. A short line runs direct from the office to the British Resident’s house at Sabzabad, and another line accompanies the Shiray line to the coast of the peninsula and then strikes north to Bushire town, where instruments in the British Residency and the Persian Tele graph Office are connected with it. There is a staff of 15 European or Eurasian operators at Rishahr. In 1912 a temporary wireless installation was erected at Rishahr, which has a range of 120 miles by day and 130 by night. The town Residency, First Assistant Rsident’s house, and Sabzabad Residency are connected by telephone. Postal. —There is a British Post Office at Bushire in the British Resi dency, mails not passing through the Persian posts. Postal arrangements are as follows :— Arrivals, Wednesday morning (fast mail) and Sunday (slow mail). Departures, Monday morning (fast mail) and alternately Wednesday and Friday (slow mail). The Persian post to and from the interior is irregular ; but it is supposed to arrive on Thursday and Monday and to depart on Saturday and Thursday.

History. —On December 10th, 1856, Bushire surrendered to a British force, which had landed at Rishahr on December 7th. In March 1857, the main force proceeded to Mohammerah, leaving 3,000 men 19 hold Bushire which was occupied till October 1857. In January 1911 Saulat-ud-Dauleh came to Bushire, with a horde of tribesmen to meet Nizam-us-Sultaneh, and as a consequence there was much disorder in the town. On April 8 th, 1911, Mirza ’Ali Muhammad, Muvaqqar-ud-Dauleh, arrived in Bushire as Governor of the Gulf Ports, vice the Daria Begi, Muvaqqar had been kdrguzdr in Shiraz, where he was friendly to Quvvam-ul-Mulk and hostile to Saulat-ud-Dauleh. In November 1911 the Bushire Anjuman, as well as all other anjumans, was abolished. The year 1911 was marked by much unrest in the districts round Bushire, due chiefly to Nizam-us-Sultaneh’s attempts to recover revenue ; and a more serious state of affairs supervened when the 39th Central India Horse landed at Bushire, in November 1911, on their way to Shiraz and Isfahan. In January 1912, consequent on the atack on the Central India Horse at Kazarun, a detachment of about 250 Indian infantry was landed at Busbire, which, in addition to a squadron of the 39th, remained at Bushire throughout 1912. The presence of these Indian troops at Bushire conduced to keeping the town free of disturbances during 1912, though the district was again much disturbed and Zair Khidr of Tangistan actually blocked the road within 12 miles of Bushire. In April 1913 the headquarters of the Indian battalion on arms traffic duty in the Persian Gulf was moved from Jask to Bushire, bringing the strength up to about 5 companies. About the same time the squadron of the 39th Central India Horse was withdrawn to India. Description.— Bushire is a compact town. The houses are of stone, and nearly all have an upper storey. There are only about 1,500 houses, but the population is dense and out of all proportion to die number of dwellings. The ordinary building material is a friable conglomerate of sand and shells. x ^ ,, , - - The town is divided into four wards, or mahallas, styled Behbeham, Dehdashti, Khashhabi, and Kuti; besides these there are two small quarters occunied by Jews. At the northern end of the town is an open space called Sun, between which and the water’s edge is situated a block of buildings containing the Imperial Customs House and the Persian Post Office. ^ The esplanade upon the seaward side runs at some height above the beach and along it are some of the best edifices in Bushire The furthest building to the south is the British Residency, and a little beyond it is an db-ambdr. , . -r. • 7 For climate see under Bushire Peninsula,202 BtJS—BtTS Population.— The population in 1913 was about 18,000. It is com posed of extremely heterogeneous elements, but it is predominately Persian. The following are the most important of the classes repre sented : — Bushiris rerstans. 5,000 Shambadis 1,000 Behbehanis 1,000 Kazarunis 1,000 Khanasiris 300 Shirazis 200 Tangslris 200 Duvvams 200 Dehdashtls 200 Dashtis 100 Other Orientals. Jews . Armenians . . . . Goanese • . . . . Baghdad Muhammadans Baghdad Christians . Europeans. British . . . . . Eirasians . . . . French, Russians, Belgians, etc. 600 35 20 20 18 37 10 18 As a whole the population are physically well-developed and mentally quick and intelligent ; but their naturally well-bred manners conceal an unreliable and ungrateful disposition, and they are inclined to be uncivil to foreigners, though less so than formerly. In 1912 the population was said to be quite friendly to the British Indian troops, whom they came to look upon as protectors from raiding bands. The language usually spoken by the inhabitants is broken Persian, not a quarter of the people speaking pure Persian. English is more used than French. Trade.— Bushire is still the chief gateway of foreign trade in Southern Persia. Local trade is conducted in the bazars, which are situated on the east side of the town ; the principal of these is clean, roofed in, and some 211 yards in length. In all there are about 600 shops. Timber is all imported. No bricks available. Soft stone is quarried in the peninsula to any quantity. The only bank is the Imperial Bank of Persia. The following European firms have depots in Bushire ; chiefly for the sale of piece-goods Messrs. Gray, Paul and Company Messrs. Ziegler and Company Messrs. Coddington and Lamb Messrs. Dixon and Company Messrs. Malcolm and Company Messrs. Sassoon and Company Messrs. Charles I Sassoon and Company Russian Steam Navigation Company. British. J The trade of Bushire for the last few years has been as follows :— 1906-07. 1907-08. 1908-09. 1909-10. 1910-11. 1911-12. 1912-13. Imports. £863,842 £1,052,043 £793,405 £717,091 £675,614 £932,531 £1,016,892 Exports. .. .. .. £400,892 £348,950 £669,020 £700,800 Much of the Bushire trade had been deflected to Arabistan, hence the gradual decrease up to 1911. The United Kingdom and India supply over 70 per cent of the imports and take over 60 per cent, of the exports. In 1911-12 the other chief importersBtrs—Btis 203 were Belgium, France, Germany and Turkey, while the chief exporters were China, Germany, Turkey and Egypt. In 1911 German trade flourished considerably on account of the freight rebates which the German-subsidized ships were able to offer for exporting corn. Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company shipped 11,500 tons of grain in 1911-12 against 9,500 shipped by all British firms. The following steamship lines call at the port :— The West Hartlepool Company (Messrs. Weir and Sons). Messrs. Strick and Company. Hamburg-Amerika Company. British India Steam Navigation Company.. Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company. • - • • Bucknall Steamship Lines, Limited. Bombay and Persia Steamship Navigation Company. Arab Steamship Lines, Limited. Russian Company of Shipping and Commerce. Administration. —Bushire is the headquarters of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who is appointed directly from Tehran. The peninsula is also under his jurisdiction, though in 1908 he farmed the land revenue of the Peninsula to the Katkhuda of Rishahr for 500-600 tumans a year, and the latter maintained 35 to 40 armed men to act as police in the villages. The Persian Foreign office is represented by a Kdrguzdr. In 1912 the revenue collecting was taken over by the Imperial Persian Gulf Customs under Belgian management. This Customs Administration was started in 1903. The principal office of the Persian Gulf is in Bushire. Revenue. —In 1911 the revenue for Bushire and Rishahr was £2,973, and in 1912 it was assessed at £1,983. The Gulf ports are supposed to pay £13,766 annually, but actually only pay about half that sum. Customs.—In 1910-11 the Customs receipts were £52,357, a decrease of £9,000 from the previous year, and of more than £7,000 from that of 1907-08, due to insecurity of roads and disorder in Pars. In 1911-12, the returns indicated a considerable increase, in spite of the chaos in South Persia, due possibly to improved administration : the receipts from Bushire were £96,503. In 1911-12 the expenditure out of customs for salaries, “ navy ” quarantine, and pay of Governor amounted to £32,938. Law .—There are no regular tribunals. Civil disputes are ordinarily settled by the ecclesiastical authorities. British subjects are amenable to the laws of India, for which purpose British Consuls have magisterial powers, and the Resident the powers of a high court. Quarantine.- L - r Y\\&amp; British Residency Surgeon is Port Health Officer, and the penalties for infraction of the quarantine regulations are enforced by the Customs authorities. Foreign Representation.— Great Britain is represented by a Consul-General who is also British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He has two Assistants of the Indian Political Service : the first assistant is Consul to Bushire. There are also a Medical Officer (who is also Vice-Consul), 3 Assistant Surgeons, and a Commercial Adviser.204 BOS—BUS Russia is the only other Power represented by a Consul-General. Ger many has a Consul, and France, Italy, the Netherlands and Thirkey are each represented by a Vice-Consul.

Other estimates give the distance from Bushire as 75 miles. The village is situated on the north-eastern slopes of the Kuh-i-Siah and is built in two parts, half being upon a small, isolated mound, about 390 yards to the south-west of the other portion and surrounded by mud walls. The village contains a mud fort (probably the walled portion on the mound) and some 250 huts with a few date-trees about. In the second part of the village are about 100 houses with 1,000 sheep, 200 cows, 4 horses, 20 ponies and 300 donkeys. Barley and blmaBUS—BOS 205 are procurable, as is also firewood from numerous bushes scattered over the valley. Plane trees are numerous, and fuel can also be obtained in abund ance from the nomads in the neighbourhood. There is a good camping- ground, and the water is good, but the supply is limited. It is obtained from wells and springs.— {Jones — Petty — Durand — Stotherd, 1893.) BUSIIKABAD— A village in the Anar district {q.v.) of Kirman. Bt SHU’AIB (1) (Lartstan)—Lat. 26° 48' 7' N.; Long. 53° 15' 20' E.; Elev. An island in the Persian Gulf, situated 9 miles off the coast of Laristan opposite Nakhilu. It is 12 miles long by 2| miles broad. It has 9 villages, contains 425 men of the ’Abusemate tribe, and is subject to the Shaikh of Nakhilu. The principal villages are Giru at the south-east end and Saza at the north-east, or which the above are the latitude and longitude. The outer parts of the island are rocky, and loose stones occur except at the west end, which contains good soil. The centre is a valley with good soil and cultivated. The inhabitants are civil, but great cheats. Good water and some few supplies are procurable. There is a fine pearl fishery round the island. It is separated from the main land by a channel of considerable width, particularly at its west end, from which runs a long ledge of rocks. It is said that rocks lie off its south-east end. The anchorage of the east end is well sheltered from nor’-westers, and that at the north-east part from both nor’-westers and sou’-westers ; but the ground is bad, and it will always be prudent to lay with a long scope of cable out. “ The straits of Bu Shu’aib are formed by the islands of Bu Shu’aib and Shitvar and the main. They are nearly 9 miles wide at the west part, and between the spit off the north-west of Bu Shu’aib and Nakhilu, its nar rowest parts : they are 14 miles in length, and have soundings from 32 to 5 fathoms : in mid-channel the soundings are from 32 to 16 fathoms. These soundings at the distance of 1 mile from the shore are quite regular, and in no part is there danger outside of 5 fathoms, that is outside the small bank that runs along the side of Bu Shu’aib. On the tail o* the spit run ning off north-east of Bu Shu’aib there are 4 fathoms of water and it shoals gradually, until 8 miles near the shore to two-thirds of a mile, when it shoals to 2 fathoms. No other danger exists in these five channels. ”—■ (Brucks — Taylor- Kinneir — Morier — Chesney.) BU SHU’AIB (2)— Lat. 26° 42' N.; Long. 53° 20' E. Otherwise known as Shaikh Shu’aib or Jazirat-Ash-Shaikh. An island of some importance. It subtends the coast of the Shibkuh district to which it is nearly parallel, from Shlvuh in the west to Nakhilu in the east, a mean distance of about 14 miles, but, at the east end, the coast line is within 5 miles. The length of the island is almost 15 miles and its breadth about 3 miles. It rises to a height of 120 feet on the centre and has a low plain 1 to 20 miles in extent at either end ; the greater part is almost devoid of vegetation. The anchorages off the coast are sheltered from one direction only. Water is found in wells 2 to 3 fathoms deep and is of good quality. There are ten villages on the island which are as follows:— Dehrlz, Dehkun, Helah, Kuiali Kuseh, Laz, Laza, Qurat, Has.In all there are about 300 houses on the island, and the total population is about 1,500 souls. The people are Arabs of various tribee who arc Shaft Sunnis. In summer the population is increased by immigrants from the Persian coast. Some cultivation of wheat and barley is carried on, but the ♦ principal occupations are fishing and pearl-diving. There are two fairly large sambuqs and about 85 smaller boats. The island is subject to the Hamadi Shaikh of Mugam whose authority is represented by a Naib at Laz. The people have about 40 modern rifles .—{Persian Gulf Gazetteer 1908.) BUSIN JAN— Lat. 30° IP N.; Long. 51° 43' E. ; Elev. A village in Ears, 12 miles from Fehlian and 59 miles from Shiraz, on the road between them. It is situated at the base of the Kaleh Safid.

Bustaneh w r as examined in 1914 from both land and sea points of view, and the general conclusions arrived at were that it was a possible place for a large commercial port. General Description.— Bustaneh is a thriving village of from 50 to 100 houses, inhabited by the Maraziq tribe, who are principally employed in fishing. The ground to the north of Bustaneh is low lying and shows strong deposits depicting dampness. To the west there is a small area of ground somewhat higher but shut in by hills further west. The soil is sandy and covered with low scrub. To the north and east the country appears fertile with large date plantations. It is undulating and rises gradually to a range of low hills 1 | miles distant. Climate. —The neighbourhood would appear to be hot and damp. Resources. — Water. — There are four wells in Bustaneh, all more or less bitter. Drinking water is brought from two birkehs or surface water reservoirs, to the west, f and 5 miles distant respectively. Fuel .—None available on the spot, can be procured from the mangrove swamps west of Khamir. Fodder .—? Supplies in small quantities are available. Good limestone for building is available in the hill to the west of Bustaneh, and the foot-hills are strewn with small boulders of an indifferent sandstone. The chief industry of Bustaneh is the manufacture of grindstones. Harbour. —The anchorage is well protected from the shamal, which here blow T s from the south-west and west-south-west, and though it is open to the east, winds from this direction are infrequent. The approach is easy. The low water line dries out about 4 to 6 cables from the high water line, leaving a strip of a concrete formed of dead coral and shells covered wdth stiff sand and mud 2 to 8 feet thick. Two miles east of Bustaneh the low water line is steep to the 3 and 5 fathom line, being only 180 to 200 yards distant from it. This would allow of piers being built alongside which ships could berth, though the pier would necessarily be long and some dredging would also be required. The holding ground is good.BUS—BUZ 207 Administration.- —There is a customs post at Bustaneh. Communications. —Bustaneh is near the Bandar Abbas-Lar route, and is about 20 miles west of Bandar Abbas. For description of neighbouring hill see Ras Bustaneh. An isolated mountain, some 5 miles west of Lingeh.— (Craufurd, 1910.)* The hill of Bustaneh covers almost 4 square miles, with an altitude of 1,000 feet. The whole hill appears to be composed of sulphur, of which 3 mines- have been worked. The hill is 12 miles west of Lingeh, but only about 2 miles from the coast at a point 2 or 3 miles west of Shinag.— (Cox, 1911.)

At Buzleh the creek is wide enough for two fair-sized craft to pass one another at high tide, and it is spanned by a narrow wooden bridge, 60 feet in length which connects the two parts of the town. At Buzleh the water of the Khur Duraq is drinkable, but only when the sea ebbs. The Khuli and Buzleh canals from the Jarrahi river pass the town at a few hundred yards on the east and west side respectively. There is a bazar of about 25 shops on the west bank of the creek ; the remainder of the settlement is scattered amidst interminable date groves and water courses. The population is placed at about 1,000 souls. Almost all the innabitants are Ka’b Arabs ; their chief occupation is date culture, but Buzleh is also the only port and the chief centre of trade of the Fallahieh district. The principal exports are dates, rice, wheat, barley, matting, palm leaves, melons, and a little wool. The town is subject to the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The Imperial Cus toms have a post here.

They are Sunnis and speak both Persian and Arabic. They own some 100 donkeys and cultivate wheat, barley and a few dates. The village has been described as “ a halting- place on the road from Bushire to Borazjun where there are two wells of good water, ” but the authority for this report is not stated.— (Gazetteer, Persia,, Part 111, I. B., 1885—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) CHAHAR MAHAL— Elev. 6,500'. The Chahar Mahal is an undulating plateau, situated to the south-west of Isfahan, at an elevation of between 6,500 feet and 7,000 feet. It is most easily accessible from Isfahan, and is entered from the north by the Gardan Rukh (7,725'), about 45 miles to the south-west of that city. About 8 miles from the top of the pass, the village of Kava Rukh is reached, the first within the Bakhtiari limits. The plateau, which has an area of roughly 4,500 square miles being 45 miles from north to south by 100 from east to west, is intersected by several rugged mountain ridges, rising to a height of from 3,000' to 5,000' above the plateau ; while it is encircled by high mountain ranges from 10 , 000 ' to 14 .000' above the sea level.CHA-CHA 211 The district comprises some 20 villages, with population varying £rom 300 to 2,000 inhabitants and probably double that number of smaller size, all under the jurisdiction of the Bakhtiari Khans. It may be stated in general terms that no mules are bred in the Chahar Mahal. I gather that the number of mares (from which mules are almost entirely bred in Persia) would not exceed 100 at the outside highest com putation throughout the district. A fair number of mules are bred by the Illat-Bakhtiari, or wandering tribesmen, who live in tents and roam the mountains to the south and south-west of the Chahar Mahal. But the chief source of supply is from Dizful and Luristan. From these parts they are brought up for sale, or bought and brought for grazing in the Chahar Mahal, as foals ; and drafted thence, when considered old enough to work (at 2| to 3 years) into the numerous (63) villages in the Isfahan plateau as well as through the Kashgai country, to Shiraz. These mules may be taken to be in a general way of the baggage and transport class. Though a fair number of ordnance animals are to be found amongst them. The total number of mules available in the villages of the district was about 12,000.— (Arbuthnot, 1904.) CHAH BlGl— Elev. 5,140'. Sixty-eight miles south-west of Yazd on the road to Abadeh.

The well is attached to the imamzadeh of ’Abdullah and has masonry sides. Water can be drawn here by a wheel, or fetched up by descending steps to the water’s edge some 15 feet below the surface of the ground. The water is good, and as on an average 4 caravans, say 100 animals, water here daily, and make no impression on the supply, it can be presumed that at least 300 animals could be watered daily without difficulty.— [Gabriel, 1905.)

Some 30 feet below this is an oval fissure, 30 feet by 10 feet, which is inaccessible, but stones thrown in reach water in 5 seconds, and as camels, sheep, etc., are frequently lost and swept away, the volume must be considerable. As the Chah-i-Daria is situated at a considerable elevation above the plain, it would probably be possible to utilize its waters, which would confer great benefits on the district.— {Kirmdn Political Diary, 1904.)

The village is the headquarters of an Arab Shaikh, who rules it, with several adjoining villages in subor dination to the Governor of the Gulf ports : 150 houses of Damiikh Arabs (Dawasir of Bahrain, originally Sunnis, but now Shiahs), and a few Persians of the Zanganeh tribe constitute the population of the village. Wheat, barely, melons and dates are the crops grown in the district. Estimated population o f district 1,500. With Chahkutah and its surrounding villages is now included Ahmadi which was formerly a separate entity owned by the family of which the Telegraph Ghuldms Mulla Abdullah and Agha Muhammad Quli are now the representatives. Agha Mustapha, Bahmiyar of Chaghadak and Tul-i-Blah being a near relation, Shaikh Husain of Chahkutah ejected them many years ago, but has had a hard struggle to retain Ahmadi, the importance of which arises from its position as the first stage on the caravan route. Tiil-i-Siah and Chaghadak occupy a vague position : Shaikh Husain Khan of Chahkutah considers himself the suzerain, but Agha Haidar, the Zabit of Chaghadak, and his brothers pay revenue independently to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and similarly collect road exactions at Chaghadak. Agha Haidar has, however, always assisted Shaikh Husain in his quarrel, and looks to him for support. The Zabit of Tul-i-Siah also claims the village of Ali-Changi and Gurak on the borders of Tangistan, but these are now managed by the ruler of Tanistan. The boundaries of Chahkutah and Chaghadak are on the — North-west .—Between Husainaki and Hasandun in Angall. North .—Between Husainaki and Isawand in Burazjan, between Isa- wand in Burazjan and Abu-Tawll : between Tdl-AshkI and Bulfarls in Tangistan. East .—Between Chahkutah and Samal in Tangistan. South .—Chahkuiah and Chah-:-Pir in Tangistan, between Chaghadak and Buneh-Gaz and Gurak in Tangistan. \\ est .—The district extends into the Mashlleh between Chaghadak and the main land of Bushire. The mdlidt of Chahkutah is 1,500, of Ahmadi 700 Tumdns : that of Chagha dak and Tul-i-Slah 750 : the Khan’s revenue is derived from taxation of culti vated land and also from Rdhddri and Alaji frcm caravans passing Ahmadi. Chahkutah and the nearest villages have been for generations in this family, which boasts Arab descent. The present ruler, Shaikh Husain, has been constantly at war during the past few years. His brothers Shaikh All, Muhammad and Abdullah united to force him to share their father’s villages with them and they were for years in sanctuary in Burazjan and Angall. Shaikh All was killed in a quarrel by Shaikh Husain in 1910, Shaikhs Muhammad and Abdullah raised a revolt in 1911 and were joined by Zair Khidar of Tangistan and Ahmad Khan of Angall. During some sharp fight- jng the elder brother was killed and Shaikh Abdullah wounded, took “ bast ” in the town Residency with about 80 of the Zanganeh tribe, inhabit ants of Chahkutah. Later they went back, and Shaikh Abdullah w T as given the village of Abu-Tawll by Shaikh Husain, but blood-fued and enmity still prevail between the brothers. Shaikh Husain was for many years a close ally of Darla Begl, and introduced Zair Khidar, then an unimportant KadkhudaCHA-CHA 215 of Tangistan to his favour. In 1909 Darla Begl accompanied Shaikh Husain in an expedition against Zair Khidar and again in 1910, but then the Governor of the Gulf Ports made freindship with the Tangistani chief and authorised him to attack Shaikh Husain in support of the latter’s brothers. Much fighting ensued, but Nizam-us-Saltaneh on his way to Shiraz took up the cudgels for Shaikh Husain, sent Qashqais under Amir-ul-Mulk to assist Shaikh Plusain and the Tangistanis and Angalls were beaten off. Shaikh Husain manifested his enmity against Daria Beg by threatening to cap ture him in Bushire, in consequence of which Daria Begi after his dismis sal took “ bast ” with the Besidency. Mavaqqar-ud-Dauleh, when appointe l Governor, at first supported Shaikh Husain, then turned against him and favoured Zair Khidar. Shaikh Husain was openly defiant to the Governor as long as Nizam-ud-Saltaneh was in power, and since then has been invoking the Residency’s support to prevent the Governor from taking his revenue. In 1911 he contracted with Nizam-us-Saltaneh to be answerable for the revenue of Ahram, Khaviz and Tangistan for the sum of 46,000 Tumans for a period of 6 years by arrangement with the Tangistani-Khans, proteges of Nizam-us-Saltaneh. In October 1911 these were, however, turned out of Tangistan by an uprising on the part of Zair Khidar, who bes eged some of the Khans with one of Shaikh Husain’s sons and men in the fort of Kalat. The outstanding feature of Chahkutah politics is blood-enmity with Angali on the one hand, and Zair Khidar of Tangistan on the other, and insubordi nation as regards the present Governor of Bushire. Possession of Ahmadi, which has often been threatened, is the most important factor for the Shaik because of the large revenue derived from exactions from muleteers. His is also desirous of obtaining a hold on the northern part of Tangistan. He always professes very friendly feelings towards the Residency, but is a great arms-dealer and importer, like most headmen in a postion to partici pate in the traffic. Agha Haidar lives at Chagkadak with the younger Bahmiyar and Husain Khan his half-brother. Agha Ghulam Husain and the elder Bahmiyar live at Tul-i-Siah. (Wilson, 1911). CHAH MIL— Lat. Long.

Here and there are small streams bursting through m cascades, hurrying on to au°ment the main stream below.The descent to Du Pulan for the first third is an easy gradient, the road wide, winding along the hillside, with some few stones about; the next third is bad, steep, narrow, and stony, running down a gully between two spurs of the hill, the last third descending to the village is good, the gully opening out. The whole of the hillside on both hands was clothed (April) with trees and shrubs.— {Report of a Journey through the Bakhtidrl Country to Shiishtar.) CHEHIL CHASHMEH (1)—Lat. Long. Elev. 7,200'.

A kaleh in a plain of same name in the Bakhtiari country, surrounded by high mountains and lying about 18 miles from Ardal on the road to Isfahan via Burujan. It consists of a mound rather difficult of approach on account of marshes. It is the summer quarter of the Bakhtiari and the seat of the Bakhtiari Ilkhani, being generally occupied by him during the summer months. From here the government of the tribes is conducted. The mound rises about ICO feet above the grassy and marshy plain forming the north end of the valley, and the fort on the top of it has an imposing appearance from a distance. The fort is, on approach, however, found to be almost a ruin from want of repairs. It is a quadrangular building, with a bastion tower at each corner (a fifth on the northern side to flank a breach in the wall), with a large commanding tower in the centre of the western face, but outside the keep of the whole fort. The site has had a kaleh on it from time immemorial. The present building was laid out and finished by the late Husain Quli Khan. The design of the whole edifice is on a grand scale, and the work was originally well-erected by Persian workmen from Isfahan. The doors and windows were of the best make, the public rooms ornamented in the best Persianstyle, with an dyineh-kari, or “ mirror ” durbar room and large mirrorsi of European make. The ceilings, too, were well-elaborated in wood-carvng of a particularly handsome grain. Only the traces of these once handsome decorations remain, although the fort is still a dwelling-place. It is 7 miles in length from east to west and 4 miles across at its greatest width. The valley is of great beauty. On the south it is bounded by the Kallar mountains, and on the north by the Zirreh mountain ; a small lake exists about miles south of the fort, but in summer the water-supply is poor. It is surrounded by miles of green pasture, but there are no grain supplies (June). Grain is brought here from Shalamzar and orher places. There are a few T temporary shops on the mound. The best camping-ground for troops is at the foot cf the hills, not in the plain. Burton, writing in August 1903, says :— The country is typical of Persian bleakness, the mountains being between 3,000 and 6,000 feet in height. Water is very scarce, and the mountains dry and lifeless, but covered with oak forest and grass. There are a number of streams from the mountains and considerable cultivated land, but no trees. Pasture is, doubtless, now at its worst, and is found only near the edges of the swamps and streams. There are some clumps of apricot-trees and a few apple-trees. Few arms or horses were seen. Flocks of sheep and goats were numerous, and there were some cattle and donkeys. The people were mainly in rags, and without arms. There was no evidence anywhere of the strong, well-armed, or well- mounted tribes that it was hoped to see.— {Sawyer, 1890 — Ramsden, 1902 Burton, 1903 — Arbuthnot, 1905 — Lorimer, 1906.) CHIGINl— Elev. 3,900'. A grassy and undulating plain of Luristan lying for some miles along the southern base of the Safil Kuh ; it is traversed by the Pusht-i-Kuh road from Khurramabad. The plain is occupied in the summer by the ChaganI tribe of Lurs to the number of 250 tents. The grazing is very good, and there is a considerable amount of dwarf oak forest. Water is scanty and confined principally to the springs of Naukash and Dura.— {B.) A tribe living between Khurramabad and the Kashgan river at the foot of Kuh-i-Safid. Their principal divisions are the Tahmasp Khani, Hatim Khani, Fathullahl, and Hajiha. The Hatim Khani section includes the now extinct Mirzawand : no recognised chiefs. The divisions of the Tahmasp Khani section are Haji, Sabzwar Budaq, Fathullah Juma’t Karim, Hatim wand, Shakarwand, and Waiskareh. Those of the Hatim Khani section are Husiwand, Mirzawand, Sharaf, Darwish, Hammam, and Jawwar. For practical purposes their masters are Agha Rabbia and his brother the Beglerbegi of the Chaqarwand family of Khurramabad, but their authority is not great. This tribe forcibly extorted some 50 tumdns from Lieutenant Wilson in June 1911, though he was travelling under the auspices of the above-named leaders, and in company with Mirza Hidayat, the Beglerbegi’s. They are said to number 2,000 families; their proper assessment is 3,000 tumdns ; the Sardar Akram, on behalf of Government, managed to get 1,200 tumdns in 1910.— {Wilson, 1911.)CHIGlNl TAHMASP KHANl— Lat.

It is about 13 miles in length from north-west to south-east, and varies in breadth from 2 to 3 miles ; to the north-west it runs into the Gillan valley, being watered by the same stream. Its elevation at Kaleh Shah Taqi, an ancient ruin at the lower end of the valley, is 3,860 feet, and at the higher, or south-east, end is 4,435 feet. It is filled to a great extent by low hills, which follow the general run of the mountain chains between which it is situated, viz., from north-west to south-east. The ranges on either side rise from 1,000 to 1,400 feet above it and they are well-wooded, the ravines, especially those on the south slope into the valley, being densely crowded with trees, chiefly oak. The place is well-watered by springs and streams ; the grazing is good. It is inhabited by the Siah Siah Kurds under Akbar Khan. They number 1,000 tents, of which about half are in this valley. In winter they move down, leaving, however, 200 tents at Kaleh Shah Taqi, which remain there all the year round. The tribe owns a certain number of horses and mules, as well as large herds of sheep and goats, which latter probably number not less than five or six thousand.— {Vaughan.) CHILEAN— Lat. Long. Elev.

The ruins of a post-house stand on a hill in this valley, where pasture is excellent, but timber scarce. The rivers which water this valley are the Rigan and Kapkan, which meet in the Chimashk gorge and form the Tajin river, which eventually falls into the Kasbgan.— (Schindler.) Bell, 19th April 1884, writes :— “ From Kuh-i-Ghazal the road from Dizful to Khurramabad, by easy gradients (a few of £), skirts the Chimashk stream flowing west ; rapid, 30' wide, 2 ' 6 ' deep ; stony bottom ; its valley, 200 yards wide, is shut in by steep cliffs of gypsum and red clay. 200 feet high ; stunted trees grow in its bed (4,640 feet.) “ The valley opens out and the hills to the south lower in height ; good pasture ; barometer 25-25' (4,840 feet). There is room for a large camp in this now broad valley. “ The Chimashk stream forces its way through a narrow gorge in the Kuh-i-Ghazal. The track here crosses it, and, ascending by an easy gradient, passes over the range ; the ford is a difficult one. A road also goes through the Chimashk gorge, but, being at the time blocked by the flocks of the Ilidts, it was not taken.

A village in the Dashtiitan district of Ears, 13 miles north-north-east of Borazjun, adjoined by hills on the north-east and surrounded on the other side by date-plantations. The village, which is the 3rd stage on the Bushire-Shlraz route, consists of about 40 houses inhabited by bilingual Arabs, who are said to be the descendants ol immigrants from Bahrain. The villagers cultivate dates, wheat, and barley, and own about 39 mules and 40 donkeys. There are 100 road guards here (1912). Fuel and forage are procurable, as also are supplies and cattle in very small quantities. Good and plentiful water is obtainable from the stream, but the water from the wells is brackish, as is also the water from the river. DalakI is celebrated for its naphtha springs. On approaching DalakI from Bushire sulphur springs are first met with ; they well copiously from the base of the hilk and flow in streams across the road. A little farther on the brown naphtha may be seen floating on the white sulphurous waves. The whole plain on the left of the road is converted into marsh by these streams. Ihe pungent odour from this swamp is abominable and spreads over the surrounding country for a great distance. A concession for the working of the petroleum springs suspected to exist here was obtained by Messrs! Hotz of Bushire m 1884. The boring was unsuccessful; but the experi ment was renewed by the Persian Mining Rights Corporation, who sunk a bore to the depth of 800 feet ; they also apparently met with no success and abandoned the workings. The temperature of the water in the DalikI oil springs was 95 ° Fahr. : Drops of oil appear on the surf?, &gt; of ' he water* and are collected bv the natives. J244 DAL—DAL The sheet of oil is probably at a very great depth, and Mr. Winklehmer was of opinion that mining operations here would not be a success.— (Winklehmer, 1891.) In the plain south of Dalaki is a bitumen pit, the substance of which is collected by the natives chiefly as an ingredient for a prescription which they apply to the sore backs of their camels, but also for the smearing of boat and roof timers. The bitumen at Daliki, being more protected by the covering strata and less exposed to atmospheric influences, is softer and purer than that at Narasgmn.—(JTwAMwer, 1891.) Some mills are erected near the banks of one of the streams. The marsh is covered by a dense jungle of reeds, which swurms with wild boar. The village is a wretched one, consisting only of a few mud huts, surrounded by the extensive date- plantations for which it is famous, and which, contrasting with the hills of various and strange hues in the background, give it quite a picturesque appearance. It stands at the foot of a range of salthills, which, rugged and sterile, rise to a considerable height behind it. These salthills are remarkable in shape and colour, as is always thk case with salt- hills in Persia. They are angular and abrupt, curiously stratified, and coloured red or brown, green, light blue, grey, and white. They are said to abound with wild goat and ibex. A small fort that once existed here is now in ruins, having been destroyed some time ago by the people of Borazjun. There is a clean mosque of white stucco, and a small bath at the extremity of the village. The Budhilleh river is 1 mile distant. Dalaki is considered one of the hottest places in the country, and a missionary, the Revd. H. Martyn, wdio visited it in^ 1810, when the thermometer stood at 126°, described the place as “ one of Nature’s ulcers. ” Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a medical report on the part of Persia adjacent to the telegraph line, writes thus of the country between Dalaki and Bushire as regards its sanitary conditions :— “ The district is now'here many feet above the sea, and for 4 farsakh reaching to Chaghadak high spring-tides sometimes overflow the plain. Dates, cereals, melons, etc., are extensively cultivated ; the country around Borazjun is very fertile. From Bushire to Chaghadak no w-ater is pro curable ; beyond this it can be found every 1 or 2 farsakhs, though general!} slightly brackish ; 1 farsakh before reaching Dalaki are numerous naphtha springs which impregnate the water. The drinking supply at Borazjun is from wmlls and is fairly good to the taste, but here, as w^ell as along the road, it is apt to cause diarrhoea or colic to travellers. Excellent water can be procured from the hills a few miles to the east of Borazjun, and also from a spring 1 mile east of Dalaki. The climate is very hot, damp, an sultry during the greater part of the year ; at times hot winds are prevalen • From April to September, inclusive, no travelling can be done during t e heat of the day, and during June, July, and August only at nl gjjjh Jvf* Bushire and, to a less extent, as far as Borazjun, from about 20 th l ] to the end of June, during the shimdl, sea breezes are felt towards evening, and these make the climate somewhat more endurable. “ Dalaki is,one of the hottest places in Persia, and when the wind is rom the direction of the naphtha and sulphur wells the air is most obnoxious.Dal—dal 245 In the spring midges and sandflies abound, the former on the march and the latter, together with mosquitoes, during a halt make the traveller’s life a burden. Dates and bread from the staple diet, supplemented by rice, gJfi, and eggs. In the spring and summer mast, dung-melons, and cucumbers are plentiful, and quantities are eaten. There is not a large consumption of meat; the better classes occasionally eat mutton or fowl, and the poorer, goat’s flesh. On the whole I do not think this district is especially unhealthy, though the summer is very depressing and enervating especially to Europeans.

DALIKI (District)— History .—Riza Beg, grandfather of the present Khan, was killed in 1856 at the gate of Bushire ; he originally was Katkhuda of Ziarat in Boraz- jiin. Habibullah Beg, his son, was powerless ; and the district was taken by the Khans of Borazjun. He was in the service of the Khan for some years, and then transferred to Daliki as Kalantar under the Ears Govern ment. After his death, Muhammed Riza Beg ruled as Kalantar of Daliki, and was killed at Kumarij by Haidar Khan some 11 years ago, his wife having been a cousin of Haidar Khan. Nur Muhammed Beg succeeded him, and the district was sold by the Shah to the Nizam-us-Sultaneh. Nur Muhammed was later given the title of Khan. He is on terms of enmity (1912) with the Khan of Shabankareh, and an ally of Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh of Borazjun. Owing to his close relations, as tenant, with Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Nur Muhammed Khan has succeeded in getting the control of the villages of Dava-guni and Banaki on the Khisht plain, given to him; his brother Husain Beg generally resides at Banaki. Thus, the Kutal-i-Malum pass is wholly under the control of the Daliki Khans. His nephew Mansur Beg farmed from Mushir-ud-Dauleh in 1911 the village of Jamileh, in the mountains up the Daliki river, and district. Extortion of large revenue from caravans is the all-important object of the Khan’s policy. In 1912 he was considered ill-disposed toward# the British. Geografhy. —This small district, containing 3 villages only, is bounded on the east by the mountains ; south by the Borazjun frontier passing about 3 miles north of Qaraul Khaneh ; west, the boundary lies along the Zira border to the west of a narrow strip containing the large date-plant ations of Sarkavardun and continues about f mile to the west of the Shur river till it reaches the mountains behind Behbara and Mazra’eh; north by the bridge of Daliki: there is nothing but mountains each side of this. Administration. —Daliki is the property of Nizam-us- Sultaneh, the Khan paying some 8,200 lumdns each year to Nizam-us-Sultaneh, and 500 tmndns to Maghz-ud-Dauleh, his ‘ peshkar ’. Its revenue consists of about 8,000 tumdns from the date-gardens and many thousand tumdns from taxation of caravans, and the monopoly of the sale of grain to them. The villages of Daliki district are :—Dalik (with about 400 houses) Sarkavardun (west of the river), and Kaleh-i-Safld.246 DAL—DAL For climate, resources, etc., see Daliki village.— (Chick, 1912.) dalak! river— There is a ford at Harigah (q.v.). There is also a ford at Kullul, down in a steep cutting, which is said to have a soft bottom, and to be impassable in April. The approach to the ford near Kuraband (which appears to be the one at Kullul) is impassable after heavy rain, on account of the yielding mud, which extends for some miles before the river is reached, and in which a well-laden mule sinks in above its knees.—(Chick, 1910.)

That he was not successful in this nefarious plan is proved by the fact that the Damukh are still found in a group of settlements in the south-east corner of the Dashtistan districts, Ohah Kutah being the largest.

DARAB District — A district of Ears about 145 miles south-east of Shiraz measured to its capital town Darab or Drabgird {q.v.). The district extends 50 miles east and west and 27 miles north and south. The soil of the district is reputed to be of great fertility in many places, and, when rain falls in sufficient2. DAM—BAR 249 quantities, grain yields from 10 to 50 fold. The products of the district are wheat, harley, zurat, suffered (a kind of millet), rice, tobacco, sesame, seed, and cotton. The district possesses numerous flocks and herds ; of the former, which are usually black and brown, or red, as in other parts of Ears, goats are more numerous than sheep. The climate, of course, varies with the elevations, but for a general description of it, as also of the administration of the district, vide this Gazetteer, Ddrdb Town. The revenue of the district is £6,300 annually, divided amongst a fixed population of 2,500 families, probably 10,000 souls. The hills on the south side of the plain have no water, and are uninhabited. (Kinneir — Malcolm — Jones — Abbott — Preece, 1884 — Vaughan, 1890.) DARAB oe DARAGIRD.— Lat. 28° 45' N. ; Long. 54° 37' E. ; Elev. 4,045'. A town in Ears, and the capital of the district of the same name, lying about 140 miles south-east of Shiraz, and 208 miles north-west of Bandar ’Abbas. South-south-east of the town lies the Kaleh-i-Dar b (q.v.). The town has a fine situation on the banks of a river, in an extensive plain interspersed with villages and cultivation, and is surrounded by groves of lemon and orange-trees. The mountains on the north of the Kuh-i-Ma’dan {q.v.) form an amphitheatre, the deepest part of which is about 1 mile from the town, w r hich extends towards the two horns of the crescent. Nume rous palm or date-trees, planted wide apart, are scattered over the surrounding country. Town and 'population. —The town is not as well built as Fasa. The houses are mostly built of mud and stones ; very few kiln-burnt bricks are to be seen. The main street is long and straggling, and, owing to the numerous, and apparently thriving, gardens, the town appears to cover a lot of ground. The town proper contains about 1,000 houses, of which the central bazar accounts for something over 100 shops. The total population is about 6,000 souls. Trade, supplies, and resources. —The lemon and orange-trees yield such an abundance of fruit that the juice is exported to every part of Persia. Tobacco is cultivated to a great extent, and is so excellent in quality that it is exported to Shiraz and even to India and Arabia. The people appear to have neglected the date palms which flourish here, and out of 100,000 w r hich were formerly said to exist only about 30,000 remain. As well as the date-palm, apricot, peach, plum, almond, and pistachio-trees flourish here* and grape-vines grow on the hillsides. On the Kuh-i-Ma’dan above, ■copper, silver, and iron are all said to be found, but none is now worked. Gach also can be obtained from the hills. Kiln-burnt bricks cost 15 hrdns per 1,000 ; and sun-dried bricks 2 krdns per 1 , 000 . The labourer’s hire is from 10 to 15 shdliis per diem (=4d. to 6 d.). The villagers own 400 donkeys and 4,000 sheep, and provisions of all kinds are abundant. Climate. —The climate is oppressively warm in the plain during the sum mer months. In winter snow is rarely seen. On the whole the climate is so mild that lemons are found ripening on the trees all the year round. Administration. —Darab may be termed the family seat of the Quyvam- ul-Mulk, who is hereditary mayor of Shiraz. The exactions of this potentatecaused serious roits in Shiraz in 1893. The malidt of the town is 24,000 tumdns annually. Date-palms are taxed according to their bearing.— (Kinneir—Malcolm — J ones — Abbott — Preece, 1884 — Vaughan, 1890—Sykes, 1893.)

DARlA-I-NlRlZ or NIRIZ or NAIRIZ BAKHTIGAN— Lat. 29° 30' N. ; Long. 53° to 54° ; Elev. 5,250'. A large lake in the province of Ears, its most westerly point, when its waters are highest, being about 35 miles east of Shiraz. The252 DAR—DAR length of it is about 60 miles, with a breadth of perhaps 3 to 5 miles. The water of this lake is almost entirely derived from the river Kur, better known as the Band Amir. In a dry summer season the water evaporates entirely and its bed may then be traversed on foot. The inhabitants take the opportunity of collecting the salt with which its bed is encrusted. The salt is esteemed remarkably fine and is in general use throughout Ears. The banks are often completely whitened by the presence of innumer able water birds, chiefly swans and flamingoes, which latter also may be seen wading far into the water in search of their prey. The oyster-catcher is seen abundantly, but is very timid. The water is extremely salt. The shores have no sandy beach, but soft, fine mud, which has an unpleasant saline smell when stirred up, and no shells are to be seen in it. The inhabit ants say that it contains no fish or any living animal, but it is not im probable that in the mud are found polypi and other living creatures, upon which the birds feed.— (Abbott.) Wells (30th April, 1881) describes the lake from his halting-place, Khan l-Kat, as follows :— “ Walked down to the lake for a bathe, but found it impossible to get into water above our knees, though we trudged away or at least I mile. Large flocks of flamingoes were flying to and fro, and a large sort of black-and-white duck. The shore of the lake had an unpleasant, soapy, saline smell when the mud was stirred. In marching along the banks many fine streams of clear water are passed, but they are all brackish to within \ mile of Khir, when suddenly one comes on a sweet spring. 15 miles from Khir the lake dies away into a sodaish, white ooze, and a good stream of fresh water flows in here. ” Dobbs, who skirted the south shore of the lake in April 1903, had much the same experience when wading into the lake. He describe the lake as being studded with numerous wooded islets. As the summer advances the quantity of the water greatly decreases, as is apparent from the following description:— “ Judge from the appearance of the lake-bed in June it is not a hollow of the ground, but simply one of the level plains, which in this part of the country occupies the intervening space between the ranges of hills ; and as it has a slightly lower elevation than the surrounding plains or valleys the water draining into it cannot escape, but forms after the rains a very large, shallow lake, the waters of which rapidly evaporate at the commencement of the hot season. The limits of the lake at the conclusion of the rainy season are shown by the line where a light, sandy loam, covered by a saline deposit, commences. In June the water has so far receded that only a narrow streak is visible in the far distance about the centre of the bed, while all the remaining surface is left exposed, covered with this deposit, which glitters in the sunshine like snow, and is so soft that a short way from the edge it is impossible to walk upon it. The slope of the groun towards the centre is so gradual as to be almost imperceptible. The natives say that a little water always remains about the middle of the bed, even after many months without rain, due to the streams which drain in anc have no outlet ; all the bays and inlets are, however, quite dried up, nothing- being visible but a white expanse of salt. Lake Nargis in no way differs•Ski* DAR—DAR . 25S in the above respects from Lake Niriz. There was water remaining in it only at its western end. I was prevented from ascertaining by personal inspection whether the second smaller channel between the lakes really exists but, from all accounts, when the tide is at its full height, the water entirely surrounds the end of the promontory shown in the maps, and makes an island of it for the time being. The whole of the promont ory inquestion is barren, desolate, and uninhabited. The long inlet by the villages of Tashk and Kushkah is totally dry by June ; and, though at that time the exposed bed cannot be crossed, the inhabitants say that later on in the hot season it is quite possible to walk over, as the deposit gets firmer. The northern shore of the lakes is inhabited by the Lashani tribe. There are smaller tribes on the other shores of these lakes, but the country, as a whole, is too sterile to attract many settlers, and has, moreover, suffered severely for some yearspast from great swarms of locusts.

A gorge in the Bakhtiari country, through which the whole drainage of the Chehar Mahal carried off by the Ab-I-Behishtabad (vide this Gazetteer) from its south-western extremity. Its name may be translated into English as “ the gorge of ingress and egress ”. It is a remarkable defile, with a width hardly exceeding a mile at its widest point, and narrowing down to half that distance at others. Its mountain walls rise precipitoiiely to a height of from 1,000 to 4,000 feet on each side above the bed of the torrent, and throw into perpetual shade the sea-green riband below. The whole length of the defile ,from its northern exit on the Chehar Mahal to its southern outlet on to the small plain near the village of Behishtabad, is 7 miles. The track, which runs through it, may, at its best, be described as a difficult mule-track ” and in the winter months a dangerous one ; it is one of the alternative routes taken by the Bakhtiari caravan road between Kharaii (4th stage), and Du Bulan ( 6 th stage) from Isfahan Its passage through this gorge is marked by a combination practically of a defile and three ^passes. At its entrance from the Chehar Mahal the track runs alongside the stream for about 1 mile, when it crosses by a ford the Ab- i-Junaqan, which enters the gorge by another opening from the north, and just before its junction with the main stream. This ford is negotiable with some difficulty by laden animals when the waters are high in the sprinm The track now scends and crosses a pass of some 500 feet m height, when it descends and follows the course of the river on its right bank and about 100 feet above it. An ascent of some 1,200 feet then takes place over a second pass, the gradients of which are very steep and the pathway very narrow in places. A less steep descent again brings the track nearer to the level of the river for about | mile, when a final ascent of some 2,000 feet to the highest point in its course through the tang is reached a about 8,000 feet. The road then winds along the contour of the mountain for some distance, and eventually descends by a series of steep zig-zags on to the plain of Behishtabad.—(Preece, 1902—Arbuthnot, 1905.)

It is found both in the form of an oxide and associated with copper. It is reduced to a metallic state by pulverization, washing, and hBatins' in a blast furnace, all of which operations are performed in the most primitive manner. The refuse copper ore is thrown away, as the miners are not acquainted with the manner of reducing it to a metallic state, llieie are about 40 miners here.

BASHT ARZHIN on I-ARJAN— Lat. 29° 40' N. ; Long. 52° 3' E. ; Elev. 6,600' {Routes in Persia) 4,100 — {Odling.) A plain in Ears, 47 miles west of Shiraz, across which lies the main road from Bushire. The various estimates of the size of the plain are bewildering, especially as it is completely mountain-locked and, therefore, incapable of elasticity. They vary from 16 miles by 10 as a maximum to a minimum of 5 miles by 2 . Curzon gives the probable dimensions as 7 to 8 miles length by 2 to 3 miles breadth, and this is probably nearly correct. In summer it is said to be very verdant and to afford good pasturage, the beauty of the scene invoking a rhapsody from Malcolm. In winter, however, it is very bleak, and the cold is said to be intense. In the wet weather the hollow of the plain is filled by a lake mentioned as long ago as the tenth century by A1 Isbakri which, at other times, becomes a swampy marsh. This is the source of one of the tributaries of the Shapur, afterwards the Rudhilleh river. The plain is bounded on the south by limestone rocks in irregular masses, divided by valleys, filled with dwarf oak and hawthorn ; on the east and west are limestone cliffs, about 200 feet high ; and on the north sandstone and gypsum. The soil is a black alluvial deposits The valley is remarkable for its ample supply of water, and for its being a favourite haunt of the nomads during the warm season. In spring there is a good deal of grass on this plain, and fuel is always procurable. The climate, however, is said not to be good, fever being prevalent, and a serious cause of irrigation existing in the very numerous and venomous serpents which are found here. The neighbourhood is said to abound in wild beasts ; wild boars, hyaenas, wolves, antelope, ibex, and mountain sheep are found in the surrounding hills. The maneless lion of southern Persia was formerly found here, and Sir O. St. John was attacked on horseback in 1867 by a lioness. The lion, however, seems now to be extinct. The village of Dasht Arzhin is clustered against the base of the northern hills, and immediately outside of it are the compound and rest-house of the telegraph office of the Indo-European Telegraphs, which is open for adminis trative purposes only. The village contains a tumble-down serai and 800 inhabitants. Plentiful water and firewood are obtainable here, but food supplies are scarce, though the grazing is good. In the neighbourhood of the village a small quantity of bitumen is found in the crevices of cretaceous limestone. This bitumen exhibits a262 DAS—DAS very homogeneous constitution ; it is black and of a consistency equal to that of osokerite. It exists here in such inconsiderable quantities that it is of no commercial importance.— (Allahrerdiantz, 1891). One mile from the village, on the road to the Kutal-i-Pir Zan, is a small, domed building covering a kadamgdh said to bear the imprint of ’All s horse- hoofs and in connection with which the villagers relate the customary astounding miracle. Mr. T. F. Odling, M.R.C.S., in a medical report on the part of Persia adjacent to the telegraph line, writes regarding the district between Kazarun and Dasht Arzhin :— “ There is a fair supply of drinking water on the road, which, after -climbing the Kutal-i-Dukhtar, leads through the Oak Valley. Here, in early summer, is a large fly mosquitoes also are numerous. The former attacks horses, producing large, brawny swellings, and quickly causing a loss of condition ; the latter effectually prevents the traveller from sleeping. “ The road now leads up the Kutal-i-Pir Zan (7,400 feet). Half-way up, at a caravanserai, is an abundant supply of excellent water. Descending, (water generally abundant) the plain of Dasht Arzhin is reached (4,100 feet above sea-level). Nearly one-half of this plain is covered by a marshy lake which apparently has no outlet. The climate here varies greatly. The Qak Valley has a mild winter, but it is very hot in summer ; on the top of the Kutal-i-Pir Zanthe winter is very severe, and the same may be said of Dasht Arzhin.—Here in summer the sun is hot, but the nights are generally cool. About the Oak Valley and the Kutal-i-Pir Zan the population is very small. The diet is principally acorn bread. Intermittent fever, dyspepsia, and ophthalmia are prevalent. At Dasht Arzhin intermittent fever is always prevalent. ”— (Monteith—Ouseley — St. John — Pelly—Jones — Stack Odling —Curzon, 1899.—Newcomen, 1905.)

A village in the Shabankareh district of Pars, on the right bank of the Rudhilleh stream, 2 miles above Basri. It contains 100 houses inhabited by original Persians, and a small fort with four towers. The villagers own 20 horses, 100 donkeys, and 1,000 sheep ; they grow wheat, barley, and a few dates. Some wool also is exported .—(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) DASHTl (District)— A large and important district of the Persian Gulf littoral of Pars; inland it begins at ’Arab!, 27 miles east-south-east of Bushire town, and on the coast at a point 40 miles south-south-east of the same place ; its termination is at the mouth of the Bardistan valley, 105 miles south-east of Bushire. Limits .—Dashti is bounded on the west by the sea and on the east, approximately, by the seaward face of the main maritime range; somg places connected with it lie in valleys within the range. On the north Dashti meets the district of Tangistan, its extreme inland village on ths side being ’Arabia, as already mentioned, and the extreme coast village,■DAS—DAS 263 Kalat. On the south Dashtl meets the district of the Shlbkuh Ports, of which the nearest to Dashti is Kangan. Physical characteristics .—The physical features of Dashti are few and simple. The principal one is, of course, the great maritime range, which rur.s south-eastwards and forms an almost continuous background to the district. 6 miles to the north-east of Khurmuj it rises in a grand peak 6,430 feet high, which is generally known as Kuh-i-Khurmuj, but possesses also the more distinctive name of Kuh Bair ami. Below Khurmuj town, for 15 or 20 miles, the main range is fronted, towards Dashti, by an out work of low, sandstone hills called the Kuh-i-Kaki, terminated at its south-east end by a gap 4 or 5 miles wide, through which the Mund river issues from the highlands of Pars. South of the Mund gap the main range, at first under the name of Kuh-i-Namak, resumes its course, and finally impinges on the coast at Kangan a few miles beyond tbe end of the district. Kuh Bairami is a huge mass of limestone, having a quaquaversal dip, and is sometimes crowned with snow for 2 or 3 days in winter. Kuh-i- Namak, 4,000 feet high, is of sandstone below, and towards the summit consists largely of salt, which is visible from afar as glistening streaks of white or gray. A minor, but important, feature is the sandstone coast range, reaching- height of over 2,500 feet, which bears the name of Kuh-i-Mund or Kuh-i- Kar and is described in the article on the Tangistan district, to which it partly belongs, and in this Gazetteer — vide Kuh-i-Mund. The trough con tained between this subordinate range and the main range in the Khurmuj valley, extending from near Ahram to the Mund river, with a length of 30, and a breadth of several, miles, a string of palm-leaf village extends along its western side, and there are a few also upon the east ; it drains by a longitudinal channel called Shur, which is 10 yards broad and contains above 2 feet of brackish water in places, to the Mund river at Chaghapur. Kuh-i-Namak is adjoined on its southern side by a range of which the highest point (3,270 feet) is Kuh-i-Darang, not far from Kuh-i-Namak. This range runs first southwards for 16 miles and then eastwards for an equal distance ; the result is the enclosing between it and the main range of a triangular plain, called Bu Saif, which has no open exit except at its south-eastern corner on the coast between Daiyir and Kangan. Kuh-i- Darang is of sandstone, and is connected with Kuh-i- Namak by mounds of sandstone and gypsum intersected by ravines containing brackish water. Dashti thus consists of 2 plains or valleys which both drain south-east wards, and are separated from one another by the plain or serpentine valley of the Mund river, of which the average direction is at right angles to theirs. The coast of Dashti has not been thoroughly explored, and part of it is unapproachable by vessels owing to extensive shoals. 6 miles off the mainland at about 27 miles south-south-east of Khur Ziarat, and approxi mately the same distance west of Daiyir, is a low islet, | mile in diameter, called Nakhilu : it appears to be the meeting-place of several hydrographi cal features, and marks the point where the direction of the coast changes from south-south-east to full east. From Nakhilu a great shoal, called Ras-ul-Mutaf, runs for nearly 20 miles to the east-south-east, with a deep channel inside, which is open to the east, but blind at the other end i2G4 DAS—DAS except for a boat passage round the north side of Nakhilu, and between this shoal and the mainland again is a second shoal with yet another deep channel inside. The inner channel appears to be called Khur Umm-ub Karam from the name of a small island at the head of it : the outer is perhaps called Khan : both Umm-ul-Karam and Khan are excellent havens for native boats, and are used as such by the people of the nearest main land villages. On the north side of the Nakhilu boat passage, already mentioned, begins a narrow strip of sand called Jabrin, which runs north- north-west for 6 miles and then joins, or almost joins, the mainland. From Nakhilu northwards to Khur Zlarat the coast is a mass of swamps and small creeks, of which little is known. Climate .—The climate of DashtI is accounted good ; both on the coast and inland it is cooler in summer than that of Bushire. Population .—The population of the district between the mountains and the sea is probably not less than 20,000 souls. The following are the better known tribes of the district :— NaTie. Approximate number of souls. Remarks. Amranis 600 This tribe is said to have immigrated from the neighbourhood of Soq-ush-Shtiakh in Turkish ’Iraq. Bahrainis Only a few Chiefly at Daiyir. Faqiha 1,000 Believed to be indigenous. Hajian. 2,500 Reputed the bravest of the Dashti tribes and to be indigenous. Jatut . 1,000 . Camelmen of unknown origin. Found also in Tangistan. Khwiijaha . 550 Said to have come from Behbohan a century ago. Lurs . Very few Also said to have come from Behbehan. Mirzaha Not numerous Said to be descended from a family of brothers whose mother was a Saiyid : hense their name. Mullaha 550 Better educated than their neighbours, but depend on charity for their support. Ruuseh 1,500 The Khan appoints all his deputies from this tribe. Sadat . 600 Salih Ahmadis 150 The Khans of the dynasty preceding the present one were of this tribe. Most of these tribes are of Arab descent, but nearly all are now Shfahs, and speak Persian only. Besides the above there are a numbermmDAS—DAS 265 of &amp;mall and obscure tribes, including the Dahashiha, Dehdarha, Kab- ganis, Khanasir, Muhallls, Qaidan, Shaikbani, Shaikhha, Tangasir, and ’Umruha ; and at some villages, especially on the coast, are found colonies of Arab immigrants from Shibkuh and elsewhere, who are mostly bilingual and Sunnis. The Dashtis differ from their northern neighbours, the Tangistanis, in being peacefully inclined, partially civilized, and comparatively amenable to management. In the large places their houses are often of stone and mud, but the ordinary villages consist merely of date-frond huts. Most villages are, however, defended by one or more burj tufangchls, or rifle towers of stone and mud. The greater part of the people is agriculturists or, on the coast, sailors and fishermen ; a few make a living by trade. They have a number of Martini rifles but, on the whole, are not so heavily armed as the inhabitants of other districts of the Persian coast. The proportion is about 3 rifles to 5 houses on the coast, and 2 rifles to 3 houses inland. The Dashtis are a healthy, sturdy race, and nearly all labourers and boat men at Bushire town are of their number. Vide also Stotherd’s report given in the article on Pars. Agriculture and trade. —The chief crops are wheat, barley, and dates ; the date-plantations are everywhere watered from wells. There is not the same quantity or variety of fruit as in Tangistan. The water-lift used is called charkheh-i-chdhab, and is worked by a bullock, which is made to walk down an inclined cutting in the ground. Cattle are fairly numerous and sheep and goats are kept in great numbers. Trade on a small scale is general, but there is nowhere any large bazar or mercantile centre, unless the towns of Khurmuj and Daiyir may be so accounted. The exports of the district are cattle, ghl, wheat, barley, dates, tobacco, onions, firewood, charcoal, and earthenware, also some ’abas of local manufacture. Imports are cotton piece-goods, rice, coffee, sugar, and tea. The ordinary currency consists of Persian Jcrdns, but the Indian rupee circulates in some of the coast villages. The standards of weight are a local man of 5 lbs. 13 ozs. and a Hashim man which is 16 local mans. The chief port is Daiyir. Communications and transport. —The only known routes in the district are a section of the Bushire-Bandar’ Abbas route, which passes through Khurmuj town and leaves Dashti by the gorge of the Mund river ; and a route which runs from Khurmuj town by Kald, Daiyir on the coast; neither apparently presents any difficulties. Donkeys and camels are available in considerable numbers. Administration. —The Dashti district belongs to Pars, but it is sometimes farmed from the Governor of Pars by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. It is administered by a hereditary Khan, of reputed Arab descent, who has his residence at Khurmuj and became master of the district, after numerous smaller Khans or Shaikhs had reduced themselves to impotence by their internecine feuds. The Khan pays 16,000 tumdns a year for the district of Dashti to the Governor of Pars or the Governor of the Gulf Ports, accord ing to circumstances. There is no organized police force, but the Khan’s personal retainers maintain order on the roads, and village affairs are regulated through the headmen. In the large places there are some highlyrespected Mullas, whose decisions in civil disputes are accepted by the people The land revenue is 50 kmns per gdu (250 X 250 yards), and there is also date-tree-tax of from half a krdn to 2 krdns per tree, besides a poll- tax of 5 to 20 krdns. The last two taxes are unpopular and, in conjunc tion with general misgovernment resulting from the incompetence and great a^e of the present Khan, have been responsible for much emigration from the district in recent years. The present Khan is Jamal Khan, son of Haidar Khan, son of Haji Khan, son of Jamal Khan Haidar Khan. The father of the present Khan died in June 1882 at Bushire, where he was in close imprisonment lor arrears of revenue. The Khan holds m farm and administers several of the Shibkuh Ports to southward, which are outside the district. For these he pays 8,000 tumam yearly-(Pe%- St John Ross—Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) DASHT-I-BARI-Lat. 28° 32' N. ; Long. 56° 11' E. ; Elev. 3,080'.

Supplies of all kinds may be readily obtained from the nomads.— (Jones.) DASHTlSTAN (District)— A district, natural and physical, rather than administrative, of the Ears mainland of Persia, in the vicinity of Bushire ; its principal place is Borazjun, situated exactly in the centre of the district and about 28 miles north east of Bushire town. Limits. —The length of Dashtlstan, from Blbara in the north to Chah Kutah in the south, is about 30 miles, and its breadth, which is greatest towards its southern end, averages 10 to 15 miles. On the south Dashtl stan reaches to the coast opposite Bushire ; on the west it is enclosed by the districts of Angall and Zira, and on the north-west by the district of MuzaraT ; on the north-east and east it is bounded by hills of which the Cisehkan mountain forms part. Physical characteristics.—The whole of Dashtlstan, as its name— “ the plainland ”—denotes, is a plain forming a slight declivity between the mountains on the north-east and the seacoast on the somii-west, a cir cumstance which determines the direction of the various streams and hollowsby which it is crossed. The principal stream is that which passes Dalakl and, uniting with the Rud Shirin, forms the Rud Hilleh river. Of secondary importance is the Ahmadi water-course, which rises in a part of the hills called BairamI and reaches the sea a couple of miles to the east of Shif; and the Chah Kutah salt stream which pursues a parallel and similar course, a few miles farther to the south-east. The part of the district adjoining the hills enjoys less of the sea breeze, and suffers from scorching winds in summer between the end of May and the beginning of October ; otherwise, the climate resembles that of Bushire, vide also this Gazetteer —Bushire and Dalaki—climate. Traces of sulphur, bitumen, and petroleum occur at the north end of the district. Water nearly everywhere is obtained from wells varying between 30 and 50 feet in depth. These usually contain 4 to 10 feet of water and never dry up. Inhabitants .—The population of the district is exceedingly composite, and amounts to some 15,000 souls ; a majority of the inhabitants appears to be descendants of immigrants from neighbouring Persian States, especi ally from Dashti and the direction of Shiraz. Deserving of special notice are the Persian tribes of Bag, who inhabit the villages of Jimeh, KhushAb, and Khushakan in the centre of the district ; they were originally masters of Borazjun but were expelled by the Paparis about 2 generations ago,, and have now sunk to the level of ordinary cultivators. The Papari and Qaidan tribes are noticed in the article on Borazjun, vide this Gazetteer. A few Zanganehs or Zanguis are found, especially at Chah Kutah. This is a Persian tribe of uncertain origin, but reputed courage. There are also a number of Arab settlements in the district, of which the most important is a group in the south-east corner, Chah Kutah being the largest; this group is inhabited by Damukh, who are a section of the Dawaslr of Bahrain,, and, until recently, were all Sunnis. Now about -|ths of them are Shi’ahs. Other Arabs, said to be of Bahrain origin, are found north of Borazjun, and Arabs, believed to have come from the Hindian district, occur at 3 or 4 scattered points. With the exception of the Damukh and a few of the other Arabs the whole population is Persian-speaking and Shi’ahs. Further details of the population of each village will be found in the separate descriptions of places given in this Gazetteer. Except in Borazjun the dwellings of the inhabitants are nearly all huts. The inhabitants of Dashtistan were described more than 2 decades ago as very vicious and very warlike. Agriculture .—The chief staples of Dashtistan are wheat and barley, which are grown in summer, and dates. In summer water-melons, musk-melons,, cucumbers, maize, cotton, castor-oil, beans, onions, garlic, and sesame are cultivated by irrigation from wells. Live-stock is represented by an ordinary proportion of cattle, sheep, and goats. The unit of land measurement is the gau, or that area of land which requires 6 Hashim mans of seed grain and can be ploughed by 1 yoke of animals (whether cattle, horses, mules, or donkeys) in a single day ; it is said to be represented by a square of which the side is 250 yards. In a good year the return to cultivation in Dashti it an is from 8 to 16-fold. Dashtistan agriculturally resembles Dashti, but it is considered the superior district. The cultivators of Dashilstan are many of them embarrassed with debts originating in loans taken at exorbitant rates of interest for the purpose of buying seed-grain.DAS—DAS 269 (2/7v Trade. —Borazjun is the commercial cetre of Dashtistan and the article on it may be consulted for an account of the trade of the district. The standard of weight is not uniform throughout the district, but varies from 16 to 20 Tabriz mans of Bushire, being 18 at the important centres of Borazjun and Chah Kuah. Communications and transport. —The district contains no natural obstacles. Within it lie the first 3 stages on the ordinary route from Bushire to Shiraz. The transport resources of the district are estimated at 200 horses, some camels, 350 mules, and 2,500 donkeys. Some quantity of wheat and barley is purchasable locally, but not, as a rule, until the prospects of the coming harvest are assured ; until this occurs the stocks in hand are hoarded. Administration .—In the middle of the eighteenth century much of Dash tistan was under the power of Shaikh Nas, who ruled in Bushire, and the history of the province seems to have followed more or less the fortunes of that town, vide this 6 raze£teer—Bushire Town. In 1888 Dashtistan was placed by the Amin-us-Sultan, under Prince Nasir, but, later, was given to the Governor of Shiraz, and administered by a sarti'p acting as his deputy. At the present time (1905) the political organization of DashiLtan is a patch- work of marvellous complexity. The bulk of the district is under the Governor of Ears, but some of the southern villages, including the group for which the Shaikh of Chah Kutah is responsible, are subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The system of farming the revenues is re sponsible for further confusion, especially as a certain degree of executive power is always conferred on the ‘ farmer ’ along with the right to collect the taxes, and the more so in the present case that the farmer of the greater part of Dashtistan is the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who has leased it from the Governor of Ears. Nor is the administration of the Governor commonly direct, whether he be actual or titular. Half or more of the villages to the north of Borazjun are held in farm, or, as it is frequently said, as a tiyul or fief, by the 8 alar-i-Mu’azzam. Borazjun and its dependent villages, forming the greater, part of the district, are ruled by the Papari Khan of Borazjun, who also collects the revenues, a privilege for which he pays 5,000 tumdns annually ; he is properly answerable to the Governor of Ears, to whose jurisdiction Borazjun has always nominally belonged, but, in consequence of the farm in favour of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, to which we have alluded, the relations of the Shaikh are at present, it would seem, exclusively with the Bushire Government. The Shaikh of Chah Kutah, who, in executive charge of that place and of several adjoining villages, is subject, both in theory and in practice, to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. With the exception of a deputy Governor and a telegraph official at Borazjun, who looks after the Persian Govermnent’s telegraph to Bandar Rig and beyond, Dashtistan contains no salaried employes of the Persian Government. The lot cf the subjects of the Khan of Borazjun is not a happy one ; they are rack-rented and are obliged to yield their master military service whenever he may require it, supplying their own arms and ammunition. The subjects of the Salar-i-Mu’azzam and of the Shaikh of Chah Kutah are probably little better off, and, of late years, there has been a good deal of emigration from the district. The nominal land-revenue averages 50 to 60 i270 DAS—DAS krans per gdii, but the Khan of Borazjun, at least, endeavours to extort more. The total revenue of the Dashtistan district is said to amount to 10,000 krdns, Rs. 2,500. There is no sort of criminal justice, and civil justice is synonymous with the good offices of Mullas in arranging private disputes. Quarrels between villages are either adjusted by Saiyids or else fought out to the bitter end The antecedents and position of the Khans of Borazjun and Chah Kutah are described in the articles on those places, and further information regard ing the style of Government and local politics will be found in the article on Bushire vide this Gazetteer.

A village in the Pusht-i-Kuh district of Luristan, 96 miles south-west of Kirmanshah town, on the road to Kut-ul-’Amareh. It is the summer residence of the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, whose houses, a fine brick building, built with corner bastions and loop-holed walls, is the only permanent residence in the valley. The Lurs, retainers of the chief, camp in booths of branches scattered about the plain ; some 2,500 of these booths were observed. Near the house is a garden, 500 yards long by 250 broad, enclosed with a masonry wail 4 feet thick and 15 feet high, with corner flanking towers. It is well- laid out, with tanks and fountains down the centre, and rows of poplar and willow trees. Vineyards, groves of peaches, apricots, and vegetables grow on either side, with some fine walnut trees. At the north side stands the Vail’s principal residence, a square, fortified building, built of brick and stone, of 50 yards’ side. The outer walls are 30 feet high, 3 feet thick at the base, and have a small, circular tower at each corner. In the centre is a courtyard, with a tank. Several suites of rooms open on to this court. Along the wall, on the flat roof, is a double tier of loopholes. The arrange ment of these is peculiar ; they are simply slits, with no splay at all, the upper tier cut at right angles to the wall, and meant for direct fire ; the lower cut alternately, slanting in different directions, and meant tor oblique fire. The interior of the house is well-furnished, and the water-supply, from a large spring at the foot of the hill, particularly good. There is a stable inside for 20 horses. The door of the house is in the south wall and opens into the garden, with a second gateway in the outer wall, defended overhead with a banquette and tier of loopholes. The house and garden had been recently built when visited, and its situation as a stronghold for a feudal chief, in this secluded valley, is well-chosen.

The position seems at least secure against anything the Persian Govern ment would care to attempt. The valley is irrigated from springs at the foot of the mountain, and grows abundant maize crops. Supplies of rice and wheat are usually brought up from the plains. Large numbers of mules are bred here by the Fail! Lurs.— (Maunsell, August 1888.) Situated in a broad valley.

Coal is said to be found in the hills about 10| miles north-west rom Deh Bala.— (Ranking, 1909.) DEH BALi (2)—Lat. 31° 30' N. ; Long. 54° 10' E. ; Elev. A valley, and a village of the same name , in the Yazd district. It lies at the foot of the highest peak of the Shir Kuh to the south-west of Yazd town. The valley is about 6 miles in length and 4 miles in breadth at its south-west or broadest end. It is triangle-shaped, the apex pointing to the north-east. It is a bright valley, with terraced fields on either side of a full sparkling stream, and overshadowed with all manner of goodly fruit- trees. There is abundant grazing in the valley, and an ample supply of fresh water all the year round. Firewood is procurable from the surrounding hills. The centre of the valley is full of villages which are surrounded by gardens, fields, and trees. The names of the villages, commencing from the lowest, are :— 1. Baghistan. 2. Tu Deh. 3. BIr Bagh-i-Shah. 4. Mazraeh’-i-Shah’AH. 6. Jumbarazun. 5. Gurukh. 7. Deh Bala. The valley has a permanent population of 2,000 inhabitants, which swell to 5,000 during the summer months. The flocks and herds number 100 cows and 3,000 sheep ; and the transport animals comprise 250 mules and 300 donkeys. The valley is bounded on the north-west by the Shir Kuh, which rises abruptly for the last 700 or 800 feet in a sheer wall of rock. To the south east lies an impassable spur thrown out by the Kuh Tizarjun, and to the south-west is an impassable offshoot of the Shir Kuh. There is only one road through the valley. The enters the valley at Baghistan through a defile, 200 or 300 yards in breadth, which passes under lofty cliffs. The road leaves the valley by the Gurdar-i-Nil pass, with an elevation of 11,257 feet. This forms a strong position. There are about 50 yards of open ground on the pass, along which is a granite breastwork about 5 or 6 feet thick, through which the road runs. A clear view is obtained of the whole of the narrow valley ahead for 4 or 5 miles. On either side of the pass rise lofty, inaccessible bills, rendering it quite unturnable. If the entrances to the pass were forced the defenders would be compelled to retire. There is a good position 13, miles farther up to the vadev.where it again narrows ; and there is a precipitous rock, on which is a ruined fort, jutting out into the passable space and reducing it to a couple of dry water-courses and a few yards of hilly ground. The valley altogether forms a strong, natural fortress, which contains its own supplies. A post of observation on the Shir Kuh, an outwork to command the track up to it, and men flanking the heights on either side of the lower entrance, would, if the north pass were properly held, render the valley quite impregnable. The mean height of the valley is about 8,000 feet, and any enterprising body of men holding it might sally out occasionally and take contribufions from Taft, Fizariun, Nil, etc., and block the roads to Yazd from the south-west.— {MacGregor — Stack — Vaughan, 1890.)

It contains 40 houses, with a little cultivation and numerous vineyards on the surround ing hills. The country is well-wooded with bushes and small trees affording a supply of firewood. The hills around have a reddish tinge. There is good camping-ground and supplies are procurable in small quantities. The water-supply is plentiful. The village is approached both from the north and south by passes which are impracticable for guns— (Vaughan, 1891.) DEH BID (1)—Lat. 30° 36' 47' N. ; Long. 53° 15' E.; Elev. 7,500'.

A village in the district of the same name, in Fars, some 130 miles north- north-west of Shiraz and the 5th caravan stage, and 6 th post stage thence on the road to Isfahan. It is a small village of domed huts and a square wal led garden of poplar trees, in which stands the telegraph station. It stands in a plain which is a favourite camping-ground for Arab and Qashqal nomads, and is surrounded by hills rising from LfMlQ to 3,000 feet above the plain. The population numbers only 200. The village is well supplied with water, and, though treeless, is in summer green with crops and grass. A new and spacious caravanserai was completed in 1907. The supplies obtainable here are very limited. Water is good from a spring and small stream. The village is an important station of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, owing chiefly to the fact of the line being broken almost yearly by heavy snows this stretch of line marking the highest altitude crossed by it ( 8,000 feet) between Bushire and Tehran. The company has built a good house, with a rest-room for privileged travellers ; and there is an official always in change. Telephone communication exists to Shiraz and Isfahan. The climate is excellent, though the cold in winter is great, and the place is said to become rather bleak and desolate. Mr. Odling, F.R.C.S., says that the place is in every way fitted for a sanatorium for those requiring a bracingatmosphere after long residence in hot climates, and for convalescents after illness. Were in not for infectious diseases the district might be regarded as remarkably healthy, Smallpox is very prevalent here and is often fatal. 150 mans (1,950 lbs.) of grain are sown yearly ; 60 tumans taxes ; 20 houses ; population 90. In summer large numbers of Arabs come and pitch their tents here and graze their cattle. It belongs to peasant proprietors ; gilims and carpets are woven here. Near the village are the remains of an old mound of the Ghabrs. At 2 farsalchs* distance, kaolin and lead.— (Altahverdiantz, 1891.)

It is enclosed by a low stone wall on three sides and by a rocky hill on the fourth ; on the hill also are the ruins of stone buildings.

That of one ascended by Durand in 1878 is about 14,900 feet. Mists and rain upon the summit prevented the position of places below being fixed. Ascent was made with much difficulty, owing to the steep slopes of shingle which have to be surmounted. A camp should be made on the top, in order to explore properly. A great number of sweet and strong-smelling herbs are found on this mountain, the ascent of which is asserted by the natives, to cause sleep ; hence many Rip Van Winkle stories of persons who have been thus overpowered. Cakes of dried buttermilk are eaten by the natives to counteract the effect of these plants. Snakes are found on the summit. Many ruined villages in the valley below.—(Zhmmd.)

They ate most notorious thieves, and are as barbarous and igno rant as any tribes in the mountains, and it is only through fear of their more powerful neighbours the Bakhtiari, that they are kept in subjection. They muster a few good horsemen and are admirable matchlockmen. They cultivate corn, barley, and rice, and possess large flocks of sheep and goats.

DIZFUL (District)— One of the two districts into which Northern ’Arabistan [vide this Gazetteer) is divided : the other being Shushtar. The boundary between the two is a line passing between Pavindeh and Kahunak in the north through a point east of Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah in the south. It may also be noted that while the district stretches westward of the Karkheh to the Turkish frontier, the influence of the Persian Government never extends beyond that stream and not always so far. Produce and Trade .—The agricultural and mineral products are the same as in the Shushtar district, with the exception that indigo is grown in place of opium, and may be said to be the principal industry. A certain number of fruits, such as promegranates, limes, sweet limes, oranges, apricots and some grapes, are also produced in addition to the melons of the other district; while bitumen and pitch are not found. The indigo, which ap pears to be exclusively cultivated for use in Persia and not exported to foreign countries, is of three qualities varying in price from 30 to 60 krdns (Rs. 7-8 to Rs. 15) per Tabriz man. of 6 | lbs. The crop is sown in the middle of March and cut 120 days later when about 5 feet high, and 40 days later it is again cut. The best sort of indigo is clear blue, but much of the crops is yellow. The average output is estimated at 3,000 Dizful mans, or about 50,0001bs. It is said that both soil and climate are exceedingly favourable for its production, and did the people only understand the preparation better, the produce might be considerably increased for ex port purposes. As it is, lime and other ingredients are used in its prepara tion, and the quality accordingly much deteriorated. Other crops of wheat and barley are sown in December and reaped in April; cotton is also grown somewhat extensively, but the crop is often destroyed by locusts, Imports .—Dizful city is the only centre of trade.DIZ-DIZ 293 The neighbourhood of Dizful being recognized as one of the chief centres of mule produce in Persia, its importance in this regard is very great {vide this Gazetteer, “ ’Arabistan—Northern : Produce, Trade and Resources). Coinage and Weights are the same as in Northern ’Arabistan, except that the terms Hazdr or Real are used by preference to denote the Krdn ; and that the Dizful man is equal to 16.969 lbs. avoirdupois. Revenue .-—The revenue demand for the whole Dizful district, including that portion gathered in the city, is 26,000 tumdns a year ; of which 4,000 tumdns are assessed on Shaikh Haidar’s section of the A1 Kathir. There is also an impost of 1,200 kharwdrs (each of 650 lbs.) of grain in kind, half in wheat and half in barley, to which Shaikh Haidar’s people do not contribute. N.B .—The tumdn (krans 10) varies in value from Rs. 2-8 to Rs. 3. Villages .—Almost all the villages in the Dizful district are consructed to resist sudden attack. They consist of a high enclosing wall, with usually only one entrance. Occasionally a two-storeyed building rises above the' level of the outer wall and is loop-holed. Most of the villages derive their water-supply from qandts or subterranean ducts similar to the kdrizes on the Afghan border.— {Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905—Arbuthnot, 1905.) DIZFtJL (City)—Lat. 32° 21' ; Long. 48° 21' ; Elev. 660'. General description.— city of Dizful in Northern ’Arabistan is situated on the left bank of the Ab i-Diz about 20 miles below where that river emer ges into the plain after turning the corner round Kaleh Shahid. The site is elevated and somewhat uneven, falling away on the river face in conglo merate cliffs about 100 feet high, the foot of which is washed by the river when in flood. On the left bank these cliffs do not extend beyond the town in either direction, but they are found again on the right bank a short dis tance up stream. Arriving from the east, the town has an extended appear ance, being drawn out along the river bank to a : length of about \\ miles with a depth, inland, of about f of a mile. The houses are closely packed, mostly of two storeys, with flat roofs and many of them provided with sard-dbs. Many are of brick and well built. The streets are narrow and crooked, with gutters neither paved nor cobbled running down the centre of them. These are used as common sewers and become, in wet weather, rivers of black and putrid filth. Raised side walls, about 18 inches wide, for foot passengers run along the edges, but are as often as not made use of as latrines. In many places on the west side of the town the houses are built on the face of the precipitous cliff, the foundations of the lowest being on a level with the water’s edge, or are built in tiers up from the river bed, which gives the town a very picturesque aspect from the right bamc of the river. Several steep, narrow pathways lead from the streets down to the river. In the outskirts of the town the houses are mostly in ruins. Dizful contains 38 mosques and 24 shrines, some of which are Imamzddehs (tombs of saints) and some Kadamgdhs (sanctuaries). The shrines are said to be still used to some extent as places of Bast : the most important are the Imamzadeh of Baba Yusuf, in tbe south-east corner of the town, and that of Sultan Husain, on the left bank of the river above the town, in a294 DIZ-D1Z suburb called Ruband. A canal called Qanat-i-Gavdul takes off front the left bank of the river between Ruband and the main town. Towards the southern extremity of the town, the river is spanned by an ancient bridge of the Sassanian period, 430 yards in length, and built on 24 pointed arches resting on piers. The latter are of large blocks of cut- stone ; the superstructure being of brick, with a road for the most part about 16 feet wide and roughly cobbled. The parapets in some sections have disappeared. Several of the arches have been swept away within late years and have been replaced by narrower structures, with the result that a part of the bridge towards the centre has a considerably narrower roadway than the original, and the bridge presents an unsightly aspect from a distance. About 400 yards above the bridge a line of mills, 39 in number, run into the river at right angles from the left bank. They are built upon rocks assisted by artificial dams and are connected with each other in some instances by gangways ; and all are liable to be submerged in the spring floods. A permanent canal, known as the Nahr-i-Kilmilak leaves the river on the east side below the bridge. The only edifice on the right bank of the river is the place of Kushk of the Persian Governor-General of ’Arabistan. It is of modern construc tion, and consists of a rectangular enclosure 500 feet by 300 feet, in which are several buildings. The high enclosing wall is of brick and has no pre tensions as a citadel. The ground about here affords the best camping- ground, of an area practically unlimited. Inhabitants .—The population of Dizful is some 15,000 souls and is in creasing. It has absorbed many heterogeneous elements, and some of the groups into which the inhabitants are formed, bear names or cherish tra ditions indicative of foreign origin. Such are the Jama ’at-i-Giveh Kashan who claim to be of Lur extraction : the Afshars, descendants of Nadir Shah : and the Khavanin, who name Changiz Khan as their ancestor. Neverthe less, they have now become fused in one common community and homo geneity of language, customs and dress, and may be said to constitute a type of their own. No Lurs, Kurds or Arabsreside within the town. The most prominent sections of the inhabitants are the Saiyids, numbering 6,000 and divided into many sub-sections : the Tujjdr or merchants, who are 500 households : the Mashdikh, some 250 houses ; and the Khavdnin, whose num ber of males is estimated to be some 100 houses. The lower orders belong to a poor type ; they are dirty, discontented, unhealthy and ill-favoured in appearance ; many of the better classes are respectable and well-mannered. The only religion is the Shi’ah faith m its standard form, and there are no Bahis or ’AU Ildhis or avowed infidels. Although bigoted and fanatical in regard to their particular form of religion, they show no signs of hosti lity to strangers—in somewhat marked contradistinction to the attitude of the inhabitants of Shushtar. Trade and Industries. —The religious vocation is practised by a consider able number of persons : the shopkeepers number about 2 , 000 , while the remainder are employed in local industries. The indigo of Dizful, though inferior to that imported from India, enjoys-local favour and the annual average output is estimated at 3,000 Dizfuli mans. It is graded in three qualities and fetches 30 to 60 krdns per Dizfuli man. At the present timethe indigo works are closed, and the traders have removed their plant on account of the excessive imposts placed by the Sardar-i-Mukarram, the new Governor of Northern ’Arabistan, upon the industry. Agricultural implements, stirrups, bits, horse-shoes, knives, tools, and some rifles are manufactured at Dizful from imported steel and iron : copper is converted into cooking pots ; and brass and German silver are used for samovars, pipe bowls and for inlaying iron. Floor cloths, 'abas, felt kalahs (caps), cotton textiles, both plain and striped, for clothing, cotton webbing, woollen 'abas, riding and pack saddles, earthenware, and enamelled pottery, linseed oil, gunpowder, and bullets, lacquered and papier-mache ware, also native soap, are among other local manufactures. Besides those occupied in hand trades, such as stamping and dyeing of cloths, lime pounding, cotton ginning, mak ing cotton shoes, and preparing hides for tanning, there are those employed as builders, bricklayers, millers, basket-makers, bath-keepers and butchers. The curious profession of Sagpd deserves mention: he being one who keeps a large number of watch dogs for hire for the protection of flocks or culti vation. The 39 mills already mentioned grind flour and are worked by wooden water-wheels: though only 12 cf them can ply when the water is at its lowest. The charge for grinding is 7 sidh pul and a handful of flour for every Dizfull man ground. The annual cash earnings of a mill vary from 20 to 50 tumdns, of which half goes to the owner and half to the Persian Government. The owners are people of the town and some of them are exempt from the Government demand. All foreign goods and most goods from a distance are imported from Shushtar or ’Ammareh by the large merchants, and as a rule are deposited by them in their private houses ; for, except Messrs. Lynch Bros, and four of the principal merchants, the business men of Dizful have no warehouses other than their private residences. The smaller dealers and shop-keepers purchase from the larger merchants, and even they do not, as a rule, keep their more valuable goods in their shops. Small shops are found scattered in various streets, but there is also a large bazar which consists of 3 or 4 lines of booths, each row of stalls standing back-to-back with the next; it is always crowded with purchasers from town and country. Cara vans from ’Arabistan for Khurramabad start from Dizful. Water and other supplies .—The water-supply is unlimited, and is used not only for domestic purposes, but is also taken off by qandts or subterrannean conduits on both banks above the town. A large supply of grain and meat iis always available, and recently (1905) a Persian military force of over 2,000 men has been drawing its supplies from Dizful. Firewood is obtained from the banks of the Ab-i-Diz below Kut Abd-ush-Shah and from the neighbourhood of the Karkheh : while during floods the supply is increased by inferior drift wood retrieved from the river. As one of the chief centres of the mule-supply of Persia, Dizful is of the greatest import ance. It is estimated that 300 camels and 1,000 mules with professional drivers could, in ordinarily favourable circumstances, be obtained at Dizful on short notice. For Major Arbuthnot’s report (1905) on the subject, vide this Gazetteer—’Arabistan, Northern. The surrounding country is remark able for its beautiful herbiage in spring time ; and the waving prairies flushed with red poppies, both between the rivers Diz and Karun, as well296 DIZ—DIZ as west-westwards towards Shush and the Karkheh, may be literally de scribed as a “ sight for the sore eyes ” of travellers arriving from the deserts of ’Arabistan or the barren mountains of Central Persia. Administration—The business of Persian Government of Dizful is carried on by a Deputy Governor, who is usually also the telegraph master, with a staff of two mirzds or clerks and four farrdshes or orderlies. The real power, however, is in the hands of the religious leaders of the community, the most important of whom are the Mujtahids, without whose countenance the civil authorities find it difficult to get their orders carried out. Thus Lur or Arab chiefs, who may have reason to distrust the intentions of the Persian Governor, will only obey his summons to appear if it is accompanied by a safe conduct from the chief of the Mujtahids. The most influential of these is Agha Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, Hujjat-ul-Islam (1905), aged 70 years. His son and grandson, aged 47 and 17 years, respectively, are Agha Shaikh Muhammad Bakir and Sadr-ud-Din. The next most important Mujt_ahid families are those of Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, aged 70 years, and Agha Shaikh Muhammad Riza, a nephew of the chief Mujtahid. The supreme power is in the hands of the chief Mujtahid, who has shown himself friendly and polite in his dealings with the representative of the British Government. The Mujtahids are the dispensers of public charity ; and collect and distri bute the zakdt, or alms, prescribed in the Koran, but some part at least of these does not reach those for whom it is intended. There are 27 schools in Dizful, in which reading, writing, and religious subjects are taught. Some are kept by mullds, while others are held in the houses of the Mujtahids ; that of the chief Mujtahid being attended by 150 to 200 pupils. There is also at Dizful an official called the Imam Jundeh, whose office is virtually hereditary and at present a sinecure ; he is supposed to lead the Friday prayers in the principal mosque, but this function has fallen into abeyance. The appointment was originally ecclesiastical, but the recog nition of the Persian Government has rendered it semi-secular. The present holder of the office, Saiyid Ab-us-Salam, is possessed of considerable private property, receives a salary of 300 tumdns a year in quarterly instalments from the Imperial Customs treasury, is on good terms with the Mujtahids and has some influence with the surrounding Arabs. A Persian telegraph office and post office exist at Dizful ; and there is a custom-house presided over by a Director, under whom are a dozen guards.

DIZ-GAH— Lat. 28° 10 '; LonCx. 52° 20'; Elev. 850'. A village in Pars, 36 miles from Kangan on the road to Firuzabad, from which it is 60 miles distant. There is a small fort here, and the place has some date-groves. No supplies are procurable and the water from the stream is brackish ; sw^eet water is to fee had from wells.— (Jones.) DIZ-I-ARJANAK— Lat. 33° 8 ' N, ; Long. 49° 36' E. ; Elev. 7,100'. A mountain stronghold in the Bakhtiari country north of the Kaleh Kuh range, and owned by the Tsawand section of the Bakhtiari tribe. The valleyflHMMHHMi DIZ—DIZ 297 in which the celebrated stronghold is situated is a most remarkable canon cut 800 feet below the neighbouring heights, which themselves are but the level of the main valley. The canon has perpendicular cliffs, 500 feet to 800 feet of conglomerate imbedded in clay almost as hard as stone, and about 1,200 yards apart. At the bottom is a torrent well lined with willows and occa sional grassy banks. The “ Biz ” is situated in the perpendicular rock behind the hamlet, and consists of half a dozen scooped out shelves in the face of the cliff, the largest 12 feet deep (into the rock), 10 feet high, and 20 feet (along the face of the rock), the front being protected by breast-high, loopholed, rubble walls about 6 to 9 inches thick. These several cavities are accessible only by difficult tracks in the face of the rock, and always open to view. There is no inter-communication in the rock itself or hidden from view. One of the chief advantages of which it boasts, is a perennial spring situated in one of these natural or semi-artificial caves, but, like all the other places of refuge, all access to it is open to view. The several places are said to be able to hide 50 to 150 men, and the “ Biz” is considered impregnable. A direct assault would perhaps beco stly of life, unless the fire, often unseen, had first been thoroughly subdued ; but it is needless to say that one moun tain gun could from the opposite side clear out each of these caverns with one well-directed shell. The range is everything desired, and the places are most beautifully indicated by every upper portion being blackened by smoke. The stronghold is a shell trap and rat hole, nothing more nor less.— (Sawyer 1890.) DIZ-I-SHAHI or KALEH-I-DIZ— Lat. Long. Elev. A stronghold in Southern Luristan situated near the Ab-i-Diz and about 18 miles north-east of the town, in the possession of the Duraki division of the Haft Lang Bakhtiaris. It is a remarkable plateau about 12 miles in circumference, crowning the summit of a lofty hill nowhere less than 150 feet high, the sides of which are almost perpendicular and only to be ascend ed by a steep and difficult pathway, which may easily be defended or per haps totally destroyed. As water is abundant on it, and flocks have been conveyed to the summit of the Diz, villages have been built on this table land and form the ordinary place of residence of the Duraki tribe. The soil is rich and under cultivation, producing grain of various kinds, suffi cient to withstand a prolonged siege. McSwiney visited it in 1891, and describes it as a natural stronghold, being a plateau about 4 miles square on the summit of a hill with perpen dicular sides of 200 feet. The highest part of the hill is 2,560 feet above sea-level. As there are no higher hills nearer than a radius of from 8 to 10 miles, it cannot be commanded by artillery. From its summit, a clear view can be obtained of the town of Dizful, distant some 11 or 12 miles. The summit is only reached by a zigzag path partly cut in the face of the cliff and partly built out on stakes driven in the face of the hill with brushwood laid on them, which can be easily destroyed by being thrown down or set fire to, thus cutting off all access to the summit. Water is obtainable from several springs. Grazing is said to be good till the end of April. There is no fuel. Supplies in winter could be obtained in considerable quantities from the plain of Dama Khail.— (Layard — McSwiney, 1890.)DIZKURD.— Lat. 30° 46' ; Long. 52° 4' ; Elev. 6,800'. A village and small hilly district of the same name, bounded on the N, by Shish Dangeh, on the E. by Chehar Dangeh, on the S. by Kam Flruz and on the W. by the Mamassani and Kuhgalu country. It is about midway between Asupas and Kuh-i-Dina according to Durand, who states that it is inhabited by Circassians (Charkas) and that the revenues are payable to the Qashqai. The district includes the following places or villages :—* Bukar, Charkas. Chashmeh. Deh Haji Bihruz, Kufteh. Laili, Kuh-i- Mand. Shahid§,n. Sharqi. buchu (Lat. 30° 40' ; Long. 52°G'). Tang-i-Rahbagi Ziniah. The estimated population is 500. DIZ MALIKAN— Lat. Long. Elev. A fort in Luristan in the Bakhtiari mountains to the north of the Katun river, north-east of Shushtar, 56 miles. It is a mass of rock, about 3 miles in circumference, which rises out of the centre of a vast basin formed by lofty surrounding hills, and whose perpendicular sides overtop the neigh bouring mountains. From the bottom of these cliffs the detritus slopes rapidly to a considerable distance, and even the cliffs themselves cannot be approached if this slope be in any way defended. The cliffs are naturally inaccessible. The rock is a conglomerate in which a limestone, abound - 1 ing with small fossil shells and ammonites, is chiefly conspicuous. The summit has only one accessible point, and that can be defended without difficulty, even by one person, when the approaches are not destroyed. The ascent is made by a very long ladder and small steps, or rather holes, cut in the rock. When this ladder is removed, all communication with the summit is cut off. The Diz is divided into upper and lower. The ascent from the lower to the upper is equally precipitous and difficult. The lower Diz consists of a small platform on which there are three springs of water and a few huts. This is the usual residence of the chief. The upper Diz is without water, except that which may be collected in reser voirs during the winter rains. It contains a few acres of good arable land, which are frequently under cultivation. About 3,000 lbs. of seed may be raised without artificial irrigation. Sheep and goats have been conveyed to the summit, and beasts for the plough, when needed, are raised by ropes. It is not extraordinary that a natural fort of such strength should have defied the regular troops of Persia for centuries. There is little doubt but the summit might be reached by shells and the crops easily destroyed. The approach, however, to the Diz from every quarter is exceedingly difficult, and the mountain passes might, if defended with skill and courage, be held against any number of men. The springs in it are not abundant, and are probably incapable of supplying any large body of men. Wheat and other necessaries are always kept in store, and several flocks find pasture on the summit : so precipitous are the cliffs that even the mountain goats cannot descend them. It belongs to the Baidarwand division of the Haft Lang Bakhtiari. It is also called Diz Azad Khan.— {Layard.)DIZ—DUD 299 DIZ MABDAN —Lat. Long. Elev. A hill fort in Ears, near Behbehan.

Water is obtained from a small stream and many good springs. The stream is said to be afterwards lost in marshes. The plain is overlooked by the Kuh-i-Humeh and Kuh-i-Dil mountains. It is reported that lions used to be numerous in the vicinity, but they appear to have been superseded by robbers, who frequent this part of the Behbehan-Shiraz road, living in .the hills to the south and taking toll of passing caravans whenever opportunity offers.— —(De Bode—Wells—1881—Hopkins, 1903.)

DU PULAN— Lat. 31° 53' N.; Long. 50° 42' E.; Elev. 4,850'. A village in the Bakhtiari country, the 6 th stage from Isfahan (93 miles ) 1 on the Bakhtiari caravan road. It is situated on the left bank of the Ab-i- Sabz Kuh or Tang-i-Siah, about a quarter of a mile above its junction with the Karun river. It derives its name from the two bridges which here cross the Ab-i-Sabz Kuh and Karun rivers. The former river, which has a strong swift current, is crossed by a ricketty structure of piles and wicker work. A bridge to its brick piers was being built in 1913. The stream itself is fordable, just above its junction with the Karun, being there 30 yards broad and two feet deep (August) with easy banks and a firm, stony bottom. Farther up, it is only 6 or 7 yards broad, with a swift current and unfordable. The bridge over the Karun, close to the caravan serai and about | mile distant from the village, consists of a single-pointed arch of burnt brick, with a span of 12 yards, a road-way 11 feet broad, and walls 2 feet high. The arch is 6 feet thick at the crown. The approaches to it are difficult for any but pack animals and its camber is excessive. The bridge was built in 1900 by Isfandiar Khan, Sardar of the Bakhtiaris, and is in good repair. The river here flows 60 feet below, through almost per pendicular walls of rock, and is about 10 yards wide. In flood the water- level is about 20 feet higher than this (August). Up stream are the remains of an old rubble bridge on the same level. Down stream are the remains of another built by the father of Isfandiar Khan in 1880. It fell in 1900. Additional suspension bridges could be made at any part for 200 yards down stream from the present bridge. The bridge is faced at 1,200 yards down stream by a good artillery position on the same level, beyoad the Ab-i-Sabz Kuh junction, and commanded from the road and ridge to the east at ranges up to 3,500 yards. There are artillery positions to either side of the bridge ; to the left, 30 to 40 feet above, and to the right, 40 to some hundreds of feet, both on rocky ground. The hills and gorge up stream are inaccessible. The village of Du Pulan belongs to the Cha’ab-us-Saltaneh. The caravan serai is in good repair, but is kept in a filthy condition. Supplies are limited, but under ordinary circumstances sufficient for 50 men and 200 animals for one day. Firewood in plenty is obtainable, and water is good and abundant. The village is deserted in summer, when supplies for men would probably be nil.DUP—DTTR 303 The following statistics with regard to population, stock, etc., have been obtained :— Houses. Population.

They are under the leadership of Surab Khan, and, together with the Tayibi, are in the habit of attacking and looting caravans on the Lynch Eoad, the usual scenes of their attacks being the Gardan-i-Barrak, Kaleh Madrasseh and Kikat (Darreh Barfi). Their best known Chief was Muhammad Riza Khan, who was executed by the then Governor of Shiraz, Prince Faridun Mirza, in 1840. In 1905 their Chief was As’adullah Khan. The sub-divisions of the Dushman Ziari are as follows : They number in all 400 families, and are capable of putting 600 fighting men into the field, 400 of whom are armed with rifles. Of these rifles a large percentage are Martinis, while the remainder are 5-shot rifles of German make, and a few British -303. The latter are very highly prized and much sought after, not only by this particular sub-tribe, but by the Kuhgalus in general. In former times the Dushman Ziari used to number as many as 1,000 families, but, owing to the oppression of their chiefs, they have scat tered, some to the Bakhtians and some to the Arabs in the Zaidan district. They inhabit the country between Behbehan, Kazarun, Ardakan and Shu- listan, and Kaleh Safid to Basht.

Failieh is the headquarters of the Shaikh of Muhammareh’s administration ; here are the offices of his govern ment, and here is quartered his mercenary force of about 400 armed Arabs and Baluchis. The village has a small quay of date-logs in the angle between the rivers, and about a mile up the Abu Jidi canal is a small dock in which the Shaikh’s steamers are repaired. The Shaikh has at Failieh about 20 brass and iron muzzle-loading guns, and his battery stands just below the entrance to the canal. Below the battery is an orchard and a young date-grove. Failieh is connected with Muhammareh town by a private telephone belonging to the Shaikh. The village itself con sists of about 300 brick, mud, and reed houses, with 12 or 15 shops ajid two coffee-shops. The inhabitants are Muhaisin and mixed Arabs, Baluchis and negroes. The principal buildings are, however, two palaces; they are still occupied by part of the household of the Shaikh, but Khaz’al Khan himself now (1905) resides in an imposing new mansion called Kasr- i-Khaz’alieh, three-quarters of a mile farther up the same bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab.

FALLAHlEH TOWN.— Lat. 30° 40' N,; Long. 48° 41' E. ; Elev. The chief town of the district of the same name in Southern ’Arabistan, and the capital of the Ka’b tribe. It is almost buried from view in date- groves, and is situated on both banks of the Fallahleh-Marid canal about 3 miles below Khazineh, the place where the Jarrahi river ends and the canal begins. The part of the town on the left bank is surrounded by a dilapidated stone wall, which encloses as well as houses a large amount of marsh. Therefore it is not surprising that this is considered the most unhealthy town of ’Arabistan. About 250 mud houses and 130 shops compose the town. The people are mostly Ka’b of the Khanafireh division and number about 1,500 souls. Movement is chiefly by water and the town possesses many hallams. Mahailahs also come up from Muhammareh by the canal, and there is good water-way conducting to Buzieh. The town lands produce abundant dates and rice, but trade is slack and the bazar is generally closed at noon for want of business. Lately the power of the Shaikh of Muhammareh has become absolute in Fallahieh .—(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) FALLAHlEH DISTRICT— The most central of the districts of Southern ’Arabistan, having on the south-west the district of Muhammareh and on the north the district of Ahwaz, on the north-east the Jarrahi district, on the south-east Ma’shur and on the south the Khur Musa and the open sea. Boundaries .—The border of the district begins on the sea at the mouth of Khur Silaik and follows that creek to Qubban. Then the boundary is the Salmanieh canal until some marshes near the Karun are reached ; it then runs more to the north than before and passes in succession by Maqtu’ and ’Ataishi to a locality named Khuwaiseh where there is some rising ground. The line then turns eastward and goes by way of Qusaibeh, at the right bank of the Jarrahi river just below the village of Qarqar. Crossing the river it continues in a south-easterly and then in a southerly direction. It passesm FAL—FAL by ’Aquleh, a spot 8 miles west of Ma’shur, and finally reaches the Khur Musa near the point where that inlet breaks up into the two Khurs of Dauraq and Ma’shur. Physical geography, climate .—The Jarrahi, which runs through the middle of the district, is bordered by a belt of canal-irrigated cultivation. Outside this cultivation are at the eastern end of the district flat, alluvial plains, which are waterless except after rain. On the north of the Jarrahi, on the borders of the Ahwaz district, there are large swamps both to the east and the west of Gharaibeh. In the damp parts the heat in summer is almost intolerable, and mosqui toes abound to an almost incredible extent. From June to September mill* tary operations would be practically impossible owing to climatic reasons. In the drier parts of the district tamarisk and camel-thorn are found. Inhabitants. —The population of the district is almost entirely of the Ka’b tribe; the people form fixed communities and should therefore be regarded as settled. The probable number of souls is about 45,000. Most of the villages are settlements situated on canals from the Jarrahi river, and known by the same name as the canals. Agriculture and trade. —Dates are the principal crops of the district. Rice, wheat and barley are also cultivated on a considerable scale. Sheep and goats are plentiful and numerous herds of cattle are to be seen ; there are a few horses and donkeys. The chief exports are dates, rice, wheat, barley, hides and melons. Buzieh is the only port situated in the district and most of the trade is carried on there. The Fallahieh man is equal to about 248dbs. English, and is equivalent to 16 Shushtar mans ; it is divided into 12 waqiyahs of 20 lbs. each. Communications .—The drier tracts can be traversed in any direction. In the moister parts progress is difficult, but even there in places there are paths practicable for laden animals. There is little information about sup plies, but canals being numerous there should be no difficulty as to water. The first step in a military occupation of Fallahieh would be to seize a position near Janjireh commanding the irrigation of the district; this would prevent the inhabitants resorting to their usual tactics of flooding the coun try, and by manipulation of water-supply combined with a blockade they should be brought to submission. Water communication. —The main artery of internal communication is the Jarrahi river, which boats of considerable size can navigate to the upper most limits of the district. The Jarrahi is not connected by a navigable channel with the Khur Musa, but it is prolonged to the Karun, which it enters at the Marl creek by the Fallahleh-Marld canal. For a number of miles in the neighbourhood of Fallahieh this canal is only a ditch 6 to 8 feet wide with a depth of 11 to 2 feet, and it is therefore impracticable to boats of more than 5 tons, but it could probably be widened without much difficulty. At 10 miles from the Karun the canal begins to become wider and deeper. Very few boats are owned by the riverside population of the Jarrahi, yet there is said to be no lack of small craft when necessary. About 300 ballams are said to be at Fallahieh. 1 1 &gt; fi 1S10 FAL—FAB &gt; Administration. —Tlie district, which belongs to the Shaikh of Muham* march, is administered by two Shaikhs of the Ka b tribe. The only institution belonging to the central Persian Government are a customs house at Buzieh and a post office at Fallahleh.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer t 1908.)

FARlDAN or FARlDUN— The correct form is Faridan ; in Armenian, Peria. One of the divisions of the Isfahan province, with an area of 1,000 square miles, situated at the back of the south-western ridge of the mountains of Khwansar, consisting of several plains wuth a mean elevation of 7,800', en closed by ranges of high mountains. Faridan is entered on the east by the Isfahan-Burujird road, about 74 miles from Isfahan, near Dumbani at the northern end of the Qahiz plateau and on the slopes of the Kuh-i-Dalan, and extends to the north-west as far as or a little beyond Chehar Chashmeh, joining the Burbarud district of Burujird. To the west it extends to the northern slopes of the Zardeh Kuh range, where is situated the Parsisht plateau wuth the ruins of Parsisht (a former city ?), called Puasisht by some. On the north and east Faridan joins the Gulpaigan and Khwansar district, on the south the Linjan district. In it rise the head-waters of one of the principal tributaries of the Zindeh Rud and those of the Karaj Rud, which flow^s to Gulpaigan. On its hills growls the manna-bearing tamarisk {Tamarix mannifera), which supplies the manna from which the best Isfahan “ Gaz ” is made. The tamarisk inFAR—FAR- 313 Persian is (jaz, its manna is gaz Angabm, i.e., tamarisk-honey, and the Isfahan gaz is made of manna, flour, almonds, etc. Faridan is peopled by Georgians and Armenians brought here by Abbas the Great in the 17th century and by Bakhtiari. The former, residing in the Gurjl (7e., Georgian) sub-district (principal place Akhureh-i-bala, with 350 families), and amounting to about 1,000 families, profess the Muhamma dan faith, but some of them still speak Georgian. The yearly taxes of the Giirji sub-district with 19 villages, amount to 18,334 brans. The Armenians of the Faridan, rather more numerous than the Georgians, occupy 9 villages (these are government property) altogether and 16 villages partly. They have about a dozen churches which form part of the Julfa (Isfahan) diocese. » The 9 villages form a separate administrative sub-district, called Khaliseh Arinina Nishin {i.e., state domains where Armenians reside), and are taxed in the government lists to the amount of 23,621| brans per annum. The Bakhtiari of the district number about 1,200 families ; altogether Faridan has a population of about 18,000 to 20,000 souls. The total amount of taxes exacted from the district by the central government is 92,284 brans— Rs. 36,914 the local Government probably takes double that amount. The Governor of Faridan generally resides at Daran, a little town with about 300 houses. The district is sub-divided into five sub districts, the chief being Buin, Afhus, Akhureh and Mlan-Dasht. The northern Chinarud ; only village standing, Kij, all others ruined. The western, the GurjT with 20 villages ; the southern, Chadugan with 50 villages ; chief place Chadugan ; other villages : Mashhad, Ahangazan, Sharshagun and Jammalu.

FARIDAN •(?)— On Bushire-Shiraz road ? FARRASHAH —Lat. Long. Elnv. A village situated in a narrow valley between ’Aliabad and Taft, near the western road from Shiraz to Yazd, and 21 miles from the latter. The village is owned by Mu ; In-ul Mulk and is divided into three mahallehs (parishes). It contains 100 houses, population 500 ; 6,500 lbs. of grain are sown yearly and there are numerous gardens ; eight jaribs are watered by qandts in 24 hours ; 140 tumans paid yearly in taxes.— {Schindler.) FARRASHBAND— Lat. 28° 50' N. ; Long. 52° V E. ; Elev. 2,400'. A village in Fars, about 63 miles south-east of Kazarun, 84 miles east of Bushire, and 30 miles west of Firuzabad. It belongs to the Mashir and was formerly a much more important place than it is at present. It is a large village embosomed in palm-groves and situated in the plain of the same name. This plain runs in a direction north-west and south-east, and is said to be about 30 miles in length, by 4 miles in breadth. It has a fort and 800 huts. Its soil is generally very free from stones, and its surface is extensively cultivated. It is a fine tract, but so sill-watered as to depend for moisture almost entirely on rain. This being uncertain, theFAR—FAR produce of the field varies greatly ; wheat and barley seem alone to be raised. The land is never manured or left fallow ; but when new )ts are cultivated, the produce is said to be as high as 30 or 40-fold, though in ordinary cases on old ground it would only be 10 or 12 -fold. There ace about 5 or 6 villages in this plain, which on the south is bounded by Dashti and on the north-west by Kuh Marreh. It was formerly a well-inhabited tract, and furnished a considerable military contingent, but from various causes it has declined since the reign of Karim Khan, Zand. Considerable supplies are procurable here, as well as cattle for slaughter and burden ; the latter chiefly asses. Rice, fuel and ghl can be procured from the nomads in the vicinity. Jones says good water is procured from hill springs, but Abbott remarks on the want of water. There is good pasturage for cattle round here. A road branches off from this place to Shiraz via Giri, by which in the war of 1856 the Persians brought down 12-pounder guns. The estimated population of the district is 2,000.— {Abbott — Pelly — J ones — Durand. FARS or PAKISTAN Province— A southern province of Persia and one which, both in name, history and population, has the best right to be regarded as Persia Proper and as the central hearth-stone of Iran. Extent .—The boundaries of Fars are as hard to define accurately as its administrative arrangements. The province may be taken approximately as lying between 27° 20' and 31° IF latitude, and 50° 10' and 55° 15' longi tude, and having the shape of a quadrilateral, each side of which is about 220 miles. The superficial area is said to be 44,335 geographical miles. Starting from a point a few miles north of Bandar Dllam on the coast of the Persian Gulf, the western boundary coincides first with the limits of the Hindlan district of ’Arabistan. From about the junction of lati tude 31° with longitude 50° it turns north-east, separating the Qashqaf country, which it includes, from the land of the Bakhtfarl, and passing the northern point of Kuh-i-Dinar and including Basaki, meets the southern frontier of Iraq ’AjamI on the Isfahan-Shiraz road a short distance south of Aminabad, and half-way between that village and Yazd-i-Khast. In denting to the north and then turning south-east the boundaries of Fars and Iraq ’AjamI coincide, until Abrquh is passed and the province of Iraq ’AjamI gives way to that of Kirman, whose western boundary meets that of Fars, some miles west of Isfinabad in the kavir or sand desert. The joint boundary now runs south-east to Abu Bakr, where the most northern point of the Laristan Province is met. Turning south-west to Nlilz and then slightly eastward to Darab, the remainder of the east ern boundary of Fars is co-terminus with the western limit of Laristan ; the same district accompanies Fars on the south, as the southern boundary now runs west and slightly south to Jahrum, finally turning more south ward and meeting the coast of the Persian Gulf about Tahirl in the Shlb Kuh District of the Persian Gulf Ports. The southern boundary thence forward is the Persian Gulf, which, turning the promontory formed by the Nakhilu shoal and Jabrin island, turns north-north-west past Bushire and Bandar Rig, and returns to its starting point north of Bandar Dllam.In the southern boundary however are included the two islands of Kharak and Khargu which lie in the Persian Gulf off the coast of the Haiat- Daud District. Physical GeogrrapA?/.—Pars may be divided climatically and to some 'extent physically into three divisions :— The Sardsir (sarhadd) or high country forming part of the Central Iranian Plateau. The Garmsir or low hill country through which access is obtained to the plateau from the sea. and the coastal plain, which varies from 12 miles in breadth near Dilam, 30 miles from Bushire to only one or two miles or even less behind Daiyir Kangan and Tahlrl. Sardsir .—The following districts are reckoned sardsir or sarhadd by natives : they cover, roughly speaking, that part of the province north of a line drawn through Mian Kutal, Firuzabad, Jahrum, and Darab, thus including the greater part of the province. Abadeh-i-Iqlid. Abadeh Tashk. Abra j. Ardakan. Khafrak. Kuhmarreh, Kurbal. Mahin. Arsinjan. Marvdasht. Baiza. Bawanat. Mashhad Murghab. Niriz. Chehar Dangeh. Dizkurd. Qunqurl. Ramjird. Istehbanat. Sarchahan. Kam FIruz. Sarvistan. Kamin. Shiraz. Kavar. Shulistan. Khafr. Salkh. From the sea as far as Shiraz, the mountains form a series of ridges roughly parallel to the coast, divided from each other by valleys of from four to ten miles in breadth. They are in general very fertile, and afford abundant grazing ; even in the garmsir, water is always obtainable at no great depth, but lack of population, and the anarchy, that with rare intervals has long prevailed in the province combine to retard its agricultural development. From Shiraz northwards the mountains system is less regular and the valleys generally more undulating though very fertile; the limit of cul tivation is about 8,000'. The hills are as a rule barren ; oak forests, which abound in Luristan, are reproduced in Fars only along a narrow belt scarcely 15 miles broad near Mian Kutal, extending far to the north-west, but not more than 50 miles to the east. North of Shiraz there is little forest, except near the Tangi-i-Bulaghi; mountains are seldom over 4 , 000 ' from top to base, except in the Kuhgalu ; from the sea northwards they rise tier upon tier, increasing gradually in elevation, the folds being generally quaquaversal, and fairly regular, and the increase in height of the intervening valleys proportionate to that of the hills. The Garmsir .—This term, in native parlance, signifies all districts lying between the sardsir (y.s.') and the sea, though for our purposes it is conveni ent to consider separately the coastal district which forms a part of it It consists of valleys, seldom more than 5 miles wide, running roughly parallel to each other in a north-west and south-east direction, separated by310 FAR—FAR barren mountain ranges, some 3,000' in height. It is Sparsely populated^ villages in some of the ’Bulukdt lying at a great distance one from another ; numerous ruins demonstrate the existence in lormer times of a much larger sedentary population ; the plains and valleys are sparsely wooded, the only common tree being the kundr or jujube, but on the higher hills there is a very large quantity of wood, small trees as a rule, wild almonds, banak and kulkhung predominating. Grazing is usually excellent, but dry afcer May ; nomad tribes frequent this tract from November to April, spending the rest of the year in the sarhadd. The date palm flourishes everywhere even in the more northerly district of Firuzabad, Fasa and Jahrum ; the fruit is but little exported, but forms an important addition to the indigenous food supply. Kazarun represents about the most northerly point of cultivation of the date palm along the main caravan routes. The Coastal strip. —The following districts, taken from west to east, are comprised in the flat alluvial tract lying between the sea and the most southerly mountain ranges of Fars Name.

The above tract is generally level, partly alluvial, and partly sandy, studded with date palm plantation, and very sparsely wooded with kundr bush. It supports, as will be seen from the above list, a relatively large population, which has, despite a sedentary life, not yet learned to forego the luxury of blood feuds, and internecine was on a small scale. It is nevertheless better ordered and governed than the rest of the province. Regarding the country from Bushire to Jahrum, Stotherd (1893) reports :— General character of country .—“ A level, sandy strip of over 30 miles broad, studded with date plantation runs along the coast near Bushire, only broken by one long ridge beginning uear Gurak and followingFAR—FAR 317 in direction the main mountain system, of which it is an outlying part. The mountains ranges have a uniform direction of north-west to south east. They are bare and rocky, and rise higher in successive ranges inland from the sea, the altitude of the intermediate valleys also increasing the farther they are trom the coast. The country is very sparsely populated, about 15 miles being the average distance between villages, while in some cases it is over 20 . Numerous ruins show signs of a former prosperity ; but at the present day there is very little that is not desert. There are no trees, and only a few scattered thorn bushes in places, and nothing much else in the way of vegetation, except that after the rains there is a crop of grass which is much scorched up by the middle of May, though still affording a certain amount of grazing. The most fertile part of this section is the plain of Firuzabad, wdiich is well-watered and fairly populous, though for the last five or six years suffering from swarms of locusts. Every village, however small, has a patch of cultivation around it, the intervening country being desert.” The hills in Fars are situated at different distances from the sea. At Bushire they are distant 2f miles. Towards Bandar Rig the plain becomes contracted and a few miles to the west of the village of Ganaveh, in the Haiat Baud District, a low ridge suddenly projects out to the south and, touching the sea, separates that district from the district of Llravi. This projecting point is known by the name of Kuh-i-Bang {q.v.). It is of no great height, and in breadth about 7 or 8 miles. Beyond this hill lies the plain of Liravi. Here again the mountains are about 20 miles from the sea, at which distance they continue for 8 or 9 miles, when they again ap proach the south and form a circle in the neighbourhood of Bandar Dilam. This low and advanced branch is known by the name of Zaidan, from a small town not far from Behbehan. On turning the southern point of the hills of Zaidan, they again abruptly retire to the north. At the port of Bandar Ma’shur in ’Arabistan they are 30 miles from the sea, and at Shushtar their most southern extremity crosses the thirty-second degree of north latitude in the forty-ninth degree of east longitude. South of Bushire, except for the valley and plain of the Mund river mouth, the hills lie right along the coast line ; the first range is the Kuh-i- Mund, and south-east of the Mund river, the range containing Kuh-i- Darang. The face of the country on the south-eastern side of Fars towards Darab and Fasa, is somewhat difierent; here it is more open, the plains are of greater extent, the soil more sandy and water less plentiful. Finally, on the eastern side almost from Darab to Abrquh, is found one of those kavlrs or sandy wastes, which, under the influence of a strong sauth-south-easterly wind, occasionally invade the neighbouring cultivated tracts with results similar to what occurred at the city of Rhages, south-east of Tehran, which is said to have been abandoned on this account. Fars contains the salt lakes of Nirlz or Bakatigan and Mahar-Lu in the vicinity of Shiraz and the Daria-i-Parishan near Kazarun which is also said to be salt. The main rivers are the Kara Aghach and its tributaries, which becomes the Mund river and pours into the Gulf at Khur Zlarat; the Band Amirwith its two large tributaries, the Pulvar and the Kur, which empties its waters into the Daria-i-NIriz ; the Kudhilleh which flows into the Gulf near Khashm AhmadI; and the upper branches of the Hindlan river. Of antiquities, towards the north, Madar-i-Sulaiman marks the tomb of Cyrus ’ to the west are the ruins of Kaleh Safid ; nearly in the centre are those of the ancient capital Persepolis ; and north-west of Kazarun the ruins of Shapur mark one of the spots where the first monarch of that name gratified his taste for building, on a scale more extensive even than that adopted by any other Sassanian ruler. ^ £&lt; , Communications roads.-Captain Wilson in 1915 wrote: Theioads of the province resolve themselves into two groups—those from the coast to Shiraz, and those from the coast northwards. “ There are half a dozen or more alternative routes from Bushire to Shiraz, the best known being — (1) No. 59 Bushire-Kazarun-Shiraz (the telegraph route). (2) No. 38 Bushire-Jirreh-Shiraz. (3) No. 37 Bushire-Firuzabad-Shiraz. “ The remainder are variants of combinations of these three. Though many attempts, to some extent successful, have been made to divert trade from the telegraph route, it remains the only one which is likely to be used for any length by commercial caravans, and, political considerations apart, the only road worth considering seriously as a caravan route. It is the shortest, and best furnished with fodder and water, the hiruzabad route being deficient in respect of the former, the Jirreh route in respect of the latter: it passes through two centres of trade, Burazjan and Kazarun, the latter being, in addition, a centre for muleteers, many of whom make their homes and headquarters here. The Jirreh route has no soraw, few permanent villages, and is a worse track than the telegraph route which is saying a good deal. The Firuzabad route suffers also from lack of mmis and villages, from which fodder could be obtained, but its most serious defect is a lack of running water from which mules can be easily and rapidly watered and the alleged existence in the vicinity of the road of a poisonous weed, which is said to be dangerous or even fatal to mules who eat it. The writer is of the opinion that any attempt to divert traffic, whether by means of a cart-road, motor-road or otherwise, to either of these routes is foredoomed to failure, and that an alignment passing through Burazjan and Kazarun, and not unsuitable for the construction of a carnage or motor road can be obtained, the Shahpur River being followed from Burazjan until the Kazarun plain is struck, or, as an alternative possibility, past Shahpur and up stream to the Dasht-i-Barm, thus avoiding the formid able Kutal-i-Dukhtar. , , . . From Shliaz northwards there are only two commercial roads of import ance, the telegraph route (No. 65), of which the carriage route is a variant,, and the sarhadd route via Asupas (No. 66 ). The latter is used, when the state of the countiy permits during the summer months, by muleteers, on account of the excellent grazing it affords, and the Saulat-ud-Dauieh forced caravans for his own purposes to use it extensively during the years 1909 and 1910. It was formerly very safe during the summer from raidsby Boir Afimadi. as the Qashqai were in the vicinity, but the exactions of the latter have more recently neutralized this advantage. It is with out sarais and for commercial purposes is in every way inferior to the main road. Except in very exceptional seasons, the telegraph route is open all the year round, except for a few days, whereas the sarJiadd road may be closed by snow for as much as two months at a time. The Shtraz-Isfahan road is now used very little by wheeled traffic : it could undoubtedly be converted into a good commercial cart track, but it seems unlikely that expenditure in this direction would prove remunera tive. From Abadeh to Isfahan it is regularly used and post horses will be found at every stage : south of Abadeh there are no post horses and. the mails are carried on foot. The following are the only other roads of any commercial import ance :— ( 1 ) No. 37, Flruzabad-Shiraz, easily adaptable to wheeled traffic. ( 2 ) No. 29 and Yol. 3, part 2,13, Jahrum-Shiraz, easily adaptable to wheeled traffic : passes through well-populated country. (3) Nos. nil and 29, Lingeh-Lar-Jahrum, a difficult track as far as Lar, but no account of it seems to be extant beyond that. (4) No. 29 Bandar ’Abbas-Iar-Jahrum, very little used now; badly off for supplies and water as far as Lar, but physically easy. (5) Nos. 27 and 44, Fasa-Sarvistan-Shiraz, could be easily adapted to wheels. ( 6 ) Nos. 54 and 66 , Shiraz-Bawanat-Yazd ; alternative to routes from. Bandar ’Abbas via Kirman or direct. (7) Nos. 64 and 59, Shiraz-Abr Kuh-Yazd ; alternative to routes from. Bandar ’Abbas, via Kirman or direct. Military considerations.—A. detailed account of each road will be found- in the Routes in Persia, Volume III : all that will be attempted here is- a brief summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the various roue's leading northwards from the Gulf. There can be no doubt that were the inhabitants to offer any organized resistance to the movement of a force up the telegraph route, it would be extremely difficult to force a passage up the series of kutals between Bushire and Kazarun and the Jirreh route would be just as bad. The Firuzabad route is less objectionable, from a purely tactical point of view, and the lack of water and supplies would tell less against it in spring when water and grazing are ample. It becomes therefore ? matter for considerafapn whether Bandar ’Abbas could not be used as a base from which to despatch a force in case of necesdty. It has certain notable advantages : (I) the country passed through is generally fairly open ; ( 2 ) as far as Lar at all events it is wholly beyond the sphere of the Qashqai; and (3) very few nomads will be found in the vicinity as far as Jahrum ; (4) camels if used could find fair grazing all the way. Disadvantages are: ( 1 ) lack of supplies and scanty water at several stages beyond Bandar ’Abbas ; (2). absence of telegraph line along, the route.The Lingeh-Lar route is a good deal. shorter, and fit for mules. We have no information with regard to it, but it seems that supplies are available ; though not in large quantities, that the road is rough and crosses several steep passes, but does not pass through country tenanted by important nomad tribes, and that resistance by the inhabitants is improbable. Lingeh moreover is not on the telegraph line and troops could probably be landed and despatched up-country without the Persian Government or the tribes being aware of the fact in advance. The above facts indicate the desirability of early steps being taken to send a qualified officer to investigate and report on the Lingeh-Lar- Jahrum-Shiraz road. As already explained in Chapter IV, the physical difficulties of the main Bushire-Shliaz road make it practically impossible to move more than one regiment of cavalry or infantry, with transport, over it simultaneously. Were resistance to be encountered, however, at the principal kutals, only infantry could hope successfully to clear the hills and occupy the passes and it would be a task to which infantry unaccustomed to hill-warfare might well prove unequal. The support of mountain guns would be essential, and indeed without the aid of artillery the numerous stone and mud rifle towers which crown the heights and various points of vantage along the road could not be captured without very heavy losses. It would seem therefore that a force intended to operate anywhere on the roads between Bushire and Isfahan should be composed between Bushire and Shiraz of | infantry and £ cavalry, from Shiraz to Dehbid the same: from Dehbid to Abadeh, where the country is well suited to cavalry, | cavalry and | infantry. The problem of supply is much more difficult where cavalry are concerned, owing to the great bulk of fodder needed : the supply arrangements for infantry present fewer difficulties, which should seldom prove serious, as comparatively little transport is needed to carry three days’ rations for them. Supplies.—In 1915 Captain Wilson wrote : “ Before entering on a discus sion regarding the amount of supplies likely to be available for a military force moving or stationed in the country, it is necessary to define the condi tions under which we assume such a force to enter the country. If with the consent, or at all events without the active opposition, of the Persian Government it is safe to assume that we shall eventually be able to obtain the co-operation of tribal and other authorities. If on the other hand we are acting without the consent of the Persian Government, or in direct opposition to local authorities, we can no longer count upon the complais ance of the latter, and a new set of conditions arises : this possibility must be taken into consideration.” Supplies for troops moving on the Bushire-Shirdz-lsfahdn road with consent of local authorities. —In order to meet the demand for fodder and provision which is created by the passage of large mercantile caravans up and down the main road, the stocks of fodder available at various stages are generally considerably in excess of the quantities actually grown by the village con cerned, as fodder is brought in for miles round for sale to persons in the village who make a business of supplying caravans.!? 321 FAR—-FAR It thus happens that, with a few exceptions, noted in the route, large stocks of straw and barley are available at every stage from Bushire to Isfahan and more could be brought in at short notice. Straw and barley are not, as a rule, stocked in large barns, but in pits and small rooms, scattered over the village, and one of the principal diffi culties in supplying troops in the collection of fodder from the various caches r it all has to be weighed before it can be taken over, and this wastes much time ; 25,0001bs. of straw and other things pro rata may be taken as the limit which it is generally possible for a single agency to remove from store, weight, and issue, at the end of a day’s march before nightfall, unless by any chance it is possible to obtain all requirements from one storehouse ; even then the time taken in filling sacks, and removing them through narrow entrances, militates against handling much more than the above quantity. I his fact, combined with the difficulty of moving large numbers - of baggage animals simultaneously over the narrow track, which constitutes the main road from Bushire to Isfahan, makes it undesirable to have a larger body than one regiment of cavalry or infantry at any one stage on the road, except at Burazjan, Ivazarun, Shiraz, Abadeh and Qumisheh, where supplies are sufficiently plentiful to enable two regiments to camp simultaneously without serious difficulty. At one stage, Mian Kutal, the camping ground is so limited that only 2 squadrons of cavalry and half a regiment of infantry with transport could find room to camp ; the infantry could however manage somehow or other, no doubt, in the woods round. The stage can be avoided by camping at Ab-Gineh, and proceeding thence direct to Dashtarjan, or by moving from Kazarun to Kaluni, and thence by the main road, or by the short cut known as Rah-i-Kal to Dashtarjan. The latter could be used by infantry with transport, though the main road is less difficult for loaded mules. Supplies for troops stationed at various points in Fdrs, consent of local authorities being assumed —- Behbehdn. A regiment could be supplied without difficulty always and a large force could live on the country in ordinary years. Burazjdn. —Ditto. Kdzarun. Iffiis town is an important centre for muleteers, and large stocks of fodder are usually available. Two regiments could be garrisoned here and live on the country. Jahrun. This town is well supplied with straw and barley from unirrigated lands ; both are cheap in normal years. Two regiments could live on the country in ordinary years here. Fasd.—Ai times it is very difficult to obtain fodder at all, especially after passage of Khamseh. There is also extensive irrigated cultivation ; it is the centre of the Khamseh tribes’ country, and has some importance from a military point of view in consequence. Two regiments could live on the country in ordinary years. Abddeh Iglid.— The market town for a large district: not much difficulty should be experienced in keeping one regiment here but for the winter supplies would have to be laid in before December.322 FAR—FAR Firuzabad.—The market town for a large district: not much difficulty should be experienced in keeping one regiment here; no difficulty in winter. In fact, one regiment of cavalry or infantry could live on the country almost anywhere, as supplies would be always obtainable from villages in the neighbourhood, Iqlid, Mahin, Bawanat, Ardakan, Baiza, Marvdasht, Arsinjan, Sarvistan, Istehbanat, Darab, ’Alamarvdasht, Khurmuj, and anywhere in Dashti, Dashtistan, and the other coastal districts as far as Behbehan would be favourable centres. Supplies for troops on the march without the consent of the Persian authori- tieg '—in these circumstances it is conceivable, though extremely unlikely, that the Persians might lay waste the country, burning all stores of straw, barley, etc., along the road ; this would not be a very difficult task and would create serious difficulties except in the spring, when grazing is excel lent all over Fars and the necessity for grain and straw less urgent. For these reasons the spring is preferable for military operations. If opposition is encountered from villages at which it is desired to purchase supplies, only mountain-guns could effectively break down their resistance and force them to give up their supplies, which are, as has already been pointed out, generally scattered in small store-houses all over the village ; it is improb able however that villagers would offer more than passive resistance to an invading army. Supplies for troops stationed at Shiraz without the consent of the Persian authorities. —The possibility of a general boycott must always be reckoned with, even if the Persian Government do not actively object to the presence of the force at Shiraz ; it is therefore undesirable to send a force to Shiraz which is not in a position, if necessary, to compel the sale of food-stuffs which it requires. But it must be realised that the force, whether in Shiraz with the consent of the Persian authorities or not, must be dependent mainly on supplies of fodder, etc., brought in from outlying districts, either directly by its own transport, or through native agency ; if disturbances prevail outside the town, or if the tribes are taking active measures to make a boycott effective, villagers will be prevented from bringing in supplies, and prices will rise rapidly, obliging the commander of the force to make his own arrangements to bring in fodder and food-stuffs, possibly by force from outside. For this purpose the best district would generally be the following: (1) Kavar, mostly owned by Qawamls : very fertile, not subject as a rule to raids by Arabs or Qashqal. (2) Khafr, south of Kavar, mostly owned by Qawamls : very fertile, not subject as a rule to raids by Arabs or Qashqal. (3) Saristan : fertile, 30 miles S. E. of Shiraz, population adherents of Qawamls. (4) Kurbal, Marvdasht, Baiza and Ardakan : all very fertile, but have suffered heavily of recent years from depredations of nomac s. Firewood is plentiful near Kavar, and at Khan-i-Zinian and Dashtarjan. Factors affecting size of force that could live at Shiraz on the country.—* It has been shown in Chapter I that the population of Shiraz and of t n** 323 PAR—FAR agricultural, as distinct from the nomadic, districts round it approximates to 140,000 witlt a density of 40 per square mile. Of these about 100,000 or 20,000 families are agriculturists. Taking an average from the static tics of some 50 villages north of Shiraz obtained in 1907 by an official of the Indo-European Telegraph Department (and checked with satisfactory results by the writer in 1911), it seems that the average crop of wheat and barley per house in a village is about 1,200 mans Shirazi, or 9,000-Ifes. ; if half be available for sale to the outside public, the produce destined for the market would be about 2 tons per house, or 40,000 tons for Shiraz and °0 miles round.* Of this quantity half should be available for the use of an occupying force in a normal year, though of course prices would go up rapidly if so large a quantity were needed. In a bad year, 10,000 tons should be available. Assuming the requirements of a cavalry brigade with transport to be about 20 tons a day of wheat and barley, I deduce that a force of this size is about the maximum, which, it can be safely assumed, could live on the country as far as grain is concerned ; a rather large number of infantrymen could be supplied, but it might be necessary occasionally to feed them on barley flour. Stratv. Turning to the question of straw, I am unable to say what pro - portion of straw is produced to a given quantity of grain, nor can I give e\ en an estimate of the proportions of wheat and barley grown, and it is the straw of wheat that is required as bhusa. Were the force to come up in early spring, grazing could be extensively resorted to, etc., and large quantities of grass laid in ; straw is awkward to carry long distances and difficult to store. The commander of a force at Shiraz would have to send out mules under escort to districts two marches distance from the town to collect straw and would have to make careful arrangements in advance for storing it. Flour.—It has been shown elsewhere that the population round Shiraz is well over 100,000 ; the bulk of them eat bread made of flour ; there should in consequence be no difficulty in providing 10,000 men with flour, as long as native agency is not relied on to bring in the wheat from the districts. Flour is never stored in large quantities ; the wheat is sent to the mill to be ground in small quantities as required. Mills are numerous round Shiraz, and there should be no difficulty in hiring one or more for the use of a force. It is very uneconomical to purchase flour ; it is better to buy wheat and have it ground under supervision ; this is the only way of obtaining good flour with certainty ; bran and barley are largely used as adulterants. Gunny bags are practically unobtainable in Shiraz ; the local equivalents are not obtainable in large quantities and though very strong and dur able, are expensive. Gunnies should therefore be brought by a force of whatever size entering the country. Meat. Is a commodity comparatively little subject to fluctuation in price m Persia. The supply is very large and of very good quality. If the force arrives early in spring flocks could be brought and kept till needed ; fin rnJ!^ W !^ at P °V£ e coun PT f0 miIes round Shiraz was estimated in 1893 at over w,UX) tons (Gazetteer of Pers a—Shiraz).324 FAR—FAK if grazing is obtainable, it would be economical to buy a fair reserve for the winter before the nomads go down to the plains, as once they have - left, the sources of supply become considerably restricted. QJii, This and other minor articles of diet (except dal) can probably, in part at all events, be imported into Shiraz, if large quantities are likely to be reouired. Ghi is not by any means universally used ; the poorer classes both in town and country cannot afford it ; it is one of the most valuable of the products brought into the towns for sale by nomads and is also largely bought by pedlars in exchange for cloth, etc., being readily portable There is however no large reserve of it available as a rule, and any exceptional demand would send up the price rapidly ; it is usually of excellent quality, and can generally be bought much cheaper south than north of Shiraz. The following notes on wheat cultivation in Dashtistan and Behbehan 1910-11 are from a report by Mr. H. G. Chick for these years, and may serve as a guide for the amount of wheat available in these districts m normal ^ The biggest holders of wheat in each district are the ruling Khans, a large portion of whose revenue is obtained from dealings in produce, though they do not trade much in their own names, purchases can be made through their brokers.

Fars or Farsistan is the same word as the Greek “ Persis,” which, originally the title of the empire of Iran only, has begotten the name which Europeans have, from remote times, applied to the whole. In this province were Pasargadae, Persepolis and Istakhr, the capitals of the Sas- sanian Kings, where they often resided though favouring a more western capital, and where they have left, in close proximity to the palaces and tombs of their predecessors, the sculptured records of their own majestic rule. Here a succession of ambitious soldiers of fortune, springing as a rule from a humble stock, found it possible, in the early disorganisation and ultimate atrophy of the unwieldy Empire of the Khalifs, to carve with their swords the scarcely-disguised reality of an independent Kingdom. The first of these was Ya’qiib-bin-Lais of Sistan, the founder of the Sufarl dynasty, in the_latter part of the ninth century. After the Sufari came the Dilami or Al-I-Bulah family, whose founder was a fisherman. Next came the Seljuk invasion. A Turkish General was appointed Governor in Fars, who managed affairs so skilfully that his family provided seven successive Viceroys between 1066 and 1149. Sunkur-ibn-Modud, a Tur koman chieftain, threw off the Seljuk yoke in that year and proclaimed his own independence. It was during the reign of Abu Bakr that Sa’di, the poet, lived for 30 years at Shi az, composed his “ Gulistan ” and “ Bustan” and died. Next, Jangiz Khan, the Mongol, appeared on the scene and to him Abu Bakr was wise enough to prefer his allegiance. The Atabeg line terminated with the son of Hulaku Khan, and Fars remained a Mongol province until Mubariz-ud-Din Muhammad founded the Muzaffari dynasty. In the reign of the fifth prince of this family in 1387 Timur first came to Shiraz, in which town the poet Hafk was then living. After the desola-326 FAR—FAR tion of Timur’s empire Fars fell successively into thfe hand's of the Turko* man Black Sheep and White Sheep dynasties ; from them it passed with the rest of Persia under the sway of Shah Isma’il, the founder of the Safavl royal line ; since which time it has remained an appanage of the Persian crown. Few territories have ever succeeded in retaining for so long a period, six centuries, the almost continuous reality of an imperium in imperio, an achievement largely due to the mountain barriers by which it is on all sides defended. Recent History.—The history of the last few years in Fars has been one of incessant disorder, with lawlessness at a premium. Governor-General has followed Governor-General in rapid succession, but up to the present not one of them he-s been able to cope with the administration of this backward and lawless province. In 1911 robberies on the Shiraz-Bushire road reached their height, even an English lady Doctor being severely maltreated. The British Government were obliged to strengthen the Consular Guards and the 39th Central India Horse were sent to Shiraz. In the autumn of the same year the formation of a Gendarmerie under Swedish officers was commenced. In December the escort of the British Consul was attacked and he himself wounded. 1912 brought little relief to the situation, the 39th Central India Horse remaining virtual prisoners in Shiraz. In December Captain Eckford of that regiment was shot by raiders while on a shooting expedition. In 1913 the cavalry were withdrawn from Shiraz. The Gendarmerie gradual ly improved and by the end of 1914 order had been completely restored on the Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan road, while the security of other roads had greatly improved. The outbreak of the war and German intrigues leading to the defection of the Gendarmerie threw matters back and the province once more relapsed into a state of anarchy. No census of Fars has ever been taken and there are no figures of any kind from which it is possible to deduce a reliable estimate of the population : the figures given herein are based in some cases upon detailed tables of the number of houses in each village, and in others are estimates based on the relative area and populousness of each district. In making such estimates five souls have been reckoned per house, a figure which has been found in practice to be fairly reliable when applied to villages. Nomad tribes have likewise been reckoned at five per tent and where different estimates of the number of tents have been given the highest figures supplied have Been taken. The total of the nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes works out as follows Tents. Qashqai . o Khamseh .... Boir Ahmadi MamassanI .... CheharRahi .... Basham .... Minor Kiihgalu tribes in Fare, say 45,000 22,800 4,500 3,000 600 300 800 Total 77,000 tents or 385,000 souls.FAR—FAR 327 f l*~ The sedentary population, deduced from the detailed figures given in the appendix, works out at 550,000 for the whole of Fars including Laristan. Some important deduction may legitimately be made from these figures, as size of population is the chief factor in the production of revenue, and exports, and in the consumption of imports. The area of Fais, including Laristan and the Kuhgalu country being about 100,000 square miles, the density of population works out at about 9 per square mile for the whole area. The most densely populated districts are :— (1) The coastal strip from Dllam to the mouth of the Mund river, commercially and, to a large extent, administratively dependent on Bushire, with a population of over 100,000. ( 2 ) The country north, north-east, east, and south-east of Shiraz within a radius of 60 miles of that city, with an estimated popu lation, including that of the capital, of 140,000 made up as follows :— Name of district.

The inhabitants of the province are of several quite dis tinct types ; along the coast and for some distance inland, from Kangan eastwards, are colonies of Arabs from the opposite coast, some of them comparatively recent arrivals, some of long standing. The population of the Shlbkuh ports is predominantly Arab, as is also that of the Gabandl district. These Arabs are mostly Sunnis with a few Shl’ahs. They are bilingual and are gradually being absorbed by the stronger Persian element around them ; they keep to their Arab dress, and, amongst themselves, to their own speech, and it is plain from their features and other physical characteristics that they are of a different racial type from their Persian neighbours.In the Behbehan and Haiat Baud districts and even further east will also be found colonies of Arabs, mostly Sunnis, with a few Shiahs fro .11 Hindljan. The population of the coast is however for the most part Persian, but of a type quite distinct from that met within Central Persia. They are Lurs. not unwarlike, of a good physique, and great agriculturists in the inland district. Those from the ports are much in demand as coolies in ports even as far afield as Karachi and Basrah. They are skilled sailors a id fishermen, professions which employ a substantial proportion of their number, and, wdien trained and subjected to discipline, they would be in many respects superior to lascars for work on board sh p. The crews of the Customs launches and of the Persian gunboat “ Persepolis ” are drawn from this source, and seem a useful and handy lot of mei. Of the Kuhgalu tribes no mention is necessary ; they are described in detail in Lieutenant Planking’s “ Notes on the Kuhgalu Tribes ” (LB. 1910). The Mamassani and Boir AhmadI, adjoining them to be east, are Lurs; they are described in detail in Chapter III. It is enough to say he'e that they are the wildest of the nomad tribes and a menace to the civ Tzed life of Pars, which can be removed by nothing but a well-organ zed punitive expedition, a consummation which would seem unlikely to materialize at present. The Qashqal nomads are of Turkish origin and monopolize with the Khamseh the lion’s share of political influence in Pars. They are suffi ciently powerful to disregard the Persian Government, if it suits them to do so, but have been prevented hitherto by dissensions among their chiefs from showing a united front ; nor is there any sign that this state of things is likely to alter in the future. PhytLally they are perhaps the finest of the tribes of south-west Persia, except the Mamassani who are said to be physically fine men. Of the Khamseh or five tribes only two, the ShaibanI and Jabbareh are of undoubted Arab origin and form the so-called Arab tribe. They aggre gate 15 000 cents and are immigrants of the YII Century A. D. from Arabia ; they still retain their ancient tongue. The origin of the remaining tribes, is doublfal: all alike are marauders. Lastly comes the sedentary population ; north of Shiraz : this is pre dominantly of old Persian stock ; lacking enterprise, personal courage and the power of co-operation ; these wretched villagers are the prey of the nomads, w 7 ho have in recent years so despoiled them of their livestock and crops as to make it almost impossible for them to keep body and soul to gether ; these remarks also apply, though in less degree, to the population of the Fasa, Sarvistan, Kavar and Khafr districts. South of Jahrum and Shiraz the villagers are more virile, with a strong admixture of Lur or nomad blood, and in Laristan the villagers are not less savage and pre datory than the nomads. The populations of the towns of Bushire and Shiraz are again well-defined types, and recognized as such all over Persia. That of Bushire is much mixed: Ar^bs, Persians, Lurs, and tribes of mixed blood, shell as Behbehanls have settled in the town and intermarried, forming a peculiar type; they wear peculia ■ dress, into which the kulah does not enter.329 rf~'~ &gt; FAR—FAR The townspeople of Shiraz are said to be less of a mixed Iranian type than is encountered elsewhere, but it is difficult to fix upon any feature as predominating or distinctive of them. The town population includes a certain number of Armenians. Shirazis are notably given to philosophical speculation, and the Babi movement has found widespread support in the town. Trade, suf plies and resources .—The produce of Fars consists mainly of tobacco, fruits, opium, grain, oranges, limes, sulphur, lead, red and yellow -ochre, cotton, horses, sheep, mules and donkeys. The manufactures are arms, cutlery, glass ware, ornamented pen-cases, silver and gold kalians, tobacco pipes, cotton cloths, cotton and woollen stockings and wine of two sorts. Nearly all of these are manufactured at Shiraz —vide this Gazetteer. Shhaz is the capital and emporium for the whole of the manufactures and resourcces of Fars, which are described in the article on that place, while a full account of the import and export trade of the province will be found in the article on Bushire town and harbour. Transport .—The question of transport is dealt with as far as possible in the articles on the various districts, but it may be useful to here recapitulate the numbers of animals owned by the districts regarding which information is available.

Colonel Ross says the animals are generally strong and trained for pack work. They are usually shod. Pack saddles are made in Shiraz and else where in the interior, and any number can be procured in a reasonable time. None, however, are available at Bushire. Climate.—The climate of Fars varies according to the configuration of the province. In the high levels it is salubrious, and this region may be said tocommence about the latitude of Kazarun. The best idea of the climate of this part will be obtained from the article in this Gazetteer on Shiraz. Of the climate of the coast line and plain land writers have vied with one another in saying the worst things possible. Mr. Odling, M.R.C.S., has reported on that of the country lying adjacent to the telegraph line, and his remarks will be found in the articles on Bushire, Borazjun, Dalaki, Kamarij and Kazarun. Of the district between Bushire and Jehrum, Stotherd (1893) writes :— “ It is very hot here from May to September and during the winter the cold cannot be excessive, as the date palm flourishes nearly everywhere in this region. The nights are cool ; in fact there is a most remarkable difference in temperature between day and night; the highest day tempera ture, I observed, was 112 ° in the shade (this was near the coast), the night’s temperature being 69°. The prevailing wind during May and June was north-west, warm and irregular in force. When it blows with any strength it raises dense clouds of dust. It always dropped about sunset, the peculi arity of it being that the farther inland we removed, the later in the day it seemed to get up. There are swarms of the common fly during the hot weather, which are rather troublesome, and in some places transport animals suffer from gadflies which are very large and venomous. Mosquitoes are not so numerous. ” Topography .—The principal modern places are :—on the north, Deh- Bd, Abadeh ; on the east, Darab, Fasa, Niriz ; on the south, Jehrum, Firuzabad ; on the west, Bushire, Borazjun, Kazaran and Behbehan ; and in the centre Shiraz. From the articles on these places, a better idea will be obtained of the details of the various parts of Fars than it is possible to convey in one single and comprehensive description of so large and widely varying an area. The seaports comprise Bandar Dilam, Bandar Rig, Bushire, Daiyir and Tahiri. Administration. —Fars, as mentioned before, is an appanage of the royal crown, and is generally ruled by a member of the royal family under the title of Governor-General of Fars. His jurisdiction does not, however, extend over Behbehan which has a Governor of its own, nor over some of the coast districts geographically included in Fars, which are administratively subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The prince-royal appointed to the province is often little more than a nominal ruler, and does not always find it an easy matter to pay into the royal treasury the sum insisted on, or even voluntarily offered in return for the appointment. The Governor- General resides at Shiraz (or Isfahan) and rules his province by farming out parts of it to various local rulers, who, in their turn, farm out their districts in yet smaller portions. Towards the south, especially, the jurisdiction of the Government of Fars is interspersed with that of the Government of the Gulf Ports and of Behbehan (which both have separate Governments) in a bewildering and apparently inconsequent manner. In many places also the authority of the Governor is encroached upon in a piece-meal fashion by leases of the land-revenue in favour of high Persian dignitaries, which carry with them the right to exercise certain executive powers ; and every where the jurisdiction of the Governor is honeycombed with minor and semi-independent jurisdictions of local hereditary Khans and Shaikhs. Inm®m FAR—FAR 331 some parts it appears impossible to determine whether the representative of the central government, or of the lessee of the revenue, or of the petty- local chieftain actually predominates. Of the climate between Jehrum Niriz Stotherd says :— “ The climate appears healthy, but hotter during the summer months than might be expected at an elevation of 5,000 feet. This is due doubtless to the absence of trees and vegetation and the paucity of water. The ther mometer in June was invariably over 90° in the shade during the day ; the nights, though, were pleasantly cool. Fasa marks the limit of the tem perate winter zone ; north of this there are no date palms or vegetation that can survive a cold winter.” One of the most recent Governors was Shu’a-us-Saltaneh, a younger son of the Shah Muzuffar-ud-Din, who was given appointment in 1901. His harsh government and his propensity for cornering grain resulted in serious riots. He was re-appointed in 1904, but his rapacity and bad government led to further serious disturbances and his removal after a second period of office which lasted 18 months. The present Governor is Zafar-us-Saltaneh (1910). Communications .—The only communications are caravan roads. The main routes of Fars centre at Bushire and Shiraz, as also does the telegraphic communication ; and full information on these points will be found in the articles on those towns in this Gazetteer. None of the rivers of Fars are navigable.■BOBFAR—FAS 333 FARSAIAN —Lat. Long. Elev. A village on the north shore of ’Abbadan island opposite Mahammareh town.

FARUR (Island)—Lat. 26° 16' N. ; Long. 54° 34' E. ; Elev. Known formerly as “ Polior.” An island in the Persian Gulf, almost 20 miles south of the Shibkuh Port of Mughu : in shape it is an ellipse, with its greater diameter of 4 | miles from north to south and a lesser diameter of 3 miles. Except for a reef with a few detached rocks on the west side, the island has deep water all round it, and the coast consists of rocky cliffs, 30 or 40 feet high. The tides here are strong, and there is one dangerous shoal between Farur and the mainland, apparently identical with the pearl bank known as Niveh Jazirat Farur. Otherwise the island is easy of approach. Farur is covered with dark, volcanic hills which, in one conical but table-topped peak, attain a height of 465 feet. Most of the island consists of bare rock and talus, but the ravines contain numerous trees, and one on the east side has wells and some date-palms. There is little bird-life, but there are a few gazelle. On the east side of the island is a small village of about 40 souls, oftudan and of miscellaneous Arabs from the Persian side. They own a couple of fishing-boa's, but most of their provisions are imported from Mughu. The people of Mughu send their cattle here to graze, and obtain some firewood from the place. Farur is under the Marzuql Shaikh of Mughu. The Persian Government have not as yet shown any interest in this 5 island.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) FASA— Lat. 28° 58'’'; Long. 53° 43'; Elev. 4,600. A town and district of Fars, 43 miles N. N. E. of Jahrum. The district is bounded on the N. by Sarvistan, on the E. by Istehbanat, on the S. by Darab and Jahrumron the W. by Khafr. It extends E. and W. 45 mil s, N. and S. from 9 to 15 miles. The population of the district is cs Jmated at 13,000 exclusive of the town, which may be put at 4,000.334 FAS—FAT Products and Commerce —The district produces tobacco, opium, sesame, corn, rice, dates and every kind of fruit. The principal trade is in opium and tobaccco which are sent to Shiraz. The Fasa opium is as good as any produced in Persia and fetches a high price in the market; exports vary from 300 to 6 ,COO Tabriz mans a year. There is a little earthenware made locally, and a variety of cJ alar is weaved in the town and sold in Shiraz and elsewhere, but with this exception agriculture is the sole occupation of the bulk of the inhabitants of the district. Fasa is notable for its mild climate : the date does not bear fruit N. of the town and it is said that only in Fasa can ripe dates, snow from the mountains and various garden fruits such as grapes, pomegranates, etc., be placed on the table simultaneously. The town is fairly well built and there are several gardens with summer houses on the outskirts. The Tcaldntars of the town in 1911 were Muhammad Hasan and Mlrza Hasan ’All. The mdliydt of the town is about 70,000 Tcrdns a year, that of the district about 200,000 krdns. Most of the villages belong to the Qawarms or to their adherents. There is a P. O. with a weekly post to Shiraz, and occasionally to- Jahrum. FASA PLAIN— Lat. Long. Elev. A plain in south-east Fars in the district of the same name. In the centre of the plain stands the town of Fasa. The plain is completely surrounded by hills, and presents somewhat the appearance of an elongated diamond. It is probably about 20 miles long, east to west, and 12 miles broad, north la south. On it are numerous villages dotted about, and also a number of watch towers, but the latter are falling into ruins. Although the plain has been said to have a dreary and deserted appearance, Preece in 1884 said the soil was apparently alluvial and rich, being cultivated everywhere with barley, wheat and opium, and in some places with Indian-corn and Stotherd, who visited it in 1893, described it as fertile, well cultivated and dotted all over with numerous small villages and camps of Illdts. — (Ouseley — Abbott — Jones — Preece, 1884 — Stotherd, 1893.) FASHT (?) AL-MUl—IRlTH (?)— Lat. Long. Elev. An extensive bank of sand and mud in Fars, extending 11 to 12 miles: south of Has Tunub, and dry in patches at low water. A channel, called Khur Ghazlan, separates it from Has Tunub, and the shoal is divided in two parts by a narrow channel, running east and west, with 5 to 7 fathoms in it.— {Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot.) FATHABAD (1)—Lat. 28° 37' N. ; Long. 54° 44' E. ; Elev. A village n the Darab district of Fars, 17 miles south-east of Darab town and a j mile south of the road thence to Furg. Near it are the ruins of a large mill.— {Preece, 1884.) FATHABAD (2)—Lat. 29° 15' N. ; Long. 52° 45' E. ; Elev.

It is the second halting-place! from Shiraz on the road to Isfahan. It lies 12 ^ miles north of Zarqan and consists of 200 houses. The inhabitants possess 50 rifles. Camping-ground is extensive; water abundant and supplies fair.— (Webb — Grahame, 1908.) FATHABAD (4)—Lat. 31° 10' N. ; Long. 56° E. ; Elev. A village in the Anar 'district (q.v.) of Kirman. „ FATHABAD (5)— Lat. 30° 28' N. ; Long. 56° 11' E. ; Elev. A village in Kirman, situated on the outskirts of the Rafsinjan oasis, about 7 miles north-east of Bahramabad. The road from the latter place to Khinaman here crosses the track from Baft to Nuk.— (Sykes, 1900.) FATHABAD (6)— Lat. 30° 50' N. ; Long. 56° 16' E. ; Elev. A hamlet in Kirman, 5 miles west of Yazdanabad (q.v.) on the road to Yazd. It lies at the western extremity of a fertile oasis.— (Sykes, 1894.) FATHABAD (7)— Lat. 30° 18' N. ; Long. 57° E. ; Elev. A hamlet about 3 miles north-west of Kirman, on the road to Yazd via Zarand.— (Sykes, 1894.) FATHURA— Lat. Long. Elev. 1,800'. A village in the Bastak district of Laristan, 15| miles from tne town of Bastak, on the road to Lar. :* It is situated at the foot of the northern slopes of the Kuh-i-Gavbus, surrounded by date-groves and a considerable area of wheat cultivation and contains some 60 houses. In the vicinity are numerous ancient Zoro- astrian ruins. Water is plentiful from wells and springs, and there is also a hot water spring, of which the temperature is 103°. The camping-ground is spacious though stony, but supplies are scanty with the exception of firewood, which is said to be obtained in abundance from the Kuh-i-Gavbus.— (Vaughan, April 1890.) FEHLlAN (1) or PALIAN— Lat. 30° 17' N. ; Long. 51° 35' E.; Elev. A town in the Shulistan district of Ears, some 72 miles north-west of Shiraz, and the principal village of the Talaspid plain. It is situated in the Shi’b Bavvan valley, at the northern base of the hills, some 2 miles west * of the Behbehan-Shiraz road at Gureh. In the winter months narcissus grows here in great abundance. DeBode describes it is a paltry little town of most sixty or seventy houses, but enclosed by walls now in ruins, which show that it was formerly not quite so insignificant. It is supplied with water by a canal cut through the hills from the snow-capped chain beyond Kaleh Safid for a distance of 14 miles. It is surrounded by fine palm trees and has a fort it ruins on the summit of a small hill. As a precipice rises close behind the town, it is probable that the heat in summer must be in tolerable. Supplies of grain and cattle can be obtained here, and wood is procurable from the Bakhtiari tribes in the neighbourhood. Ft. I. 2 cmmmm 336 FEH—FID The district of Fehllan, which formerly extended from Muninahl on the south to Basht on the north-west, and from Ardakan on the east to Khisht on the south-west has been encroached upon by the Mamassani, who by degrees have made themselves masters of all the arable land formerly pos sessed by the inhabitants of Fehllan, who complain bitterly of the exactions to which they are subjected. The water of the Fehlian or Ab-i-Shur river being, as the name implies, brackish, can only be used for irrigating the fields. The soil here is very fertile and water abundant, but hands are want ing for the cultivation of the land. The fields artificially irrigated yield from 25 to 40-fold in the winter crops ; the proportion is lower in the lands called ‘ daim ’ (debt) and ‘ bakhs ’ (deficiency), i.e., fields watered only by rain and dew, and not artificially irrigated. Rice, which is grown, yields less than that which is planted, the produce of the latter being to that of the former in good years 150-fold. Sesamum is also cultivated here and yields 100 -fold. The duties paid by Fehlian to the government of the province of Fars do not exceed £480.— (DeBode — Jones — McGowan, 1895 — Hopkins, 1903.) FEHLIAN (2)— A division of the Mamassani tribe (q.v.). FEHLIAN (3)—Lat. Long. Elev. A river in the same locality as above. It is shown as Ab-i-Shur (q.v.) in St. John’s map, and is also locally known by the names Rudian, Tang-i- Khast, and Shish Pir. It flows through the Talaspid plain in which the village Fehlian is situated. Rice-fields seem to absorb the whole of the water, and numerous irrigation channels are to be seen, notably the one leading to the head of the Sarab-i-Siah valley. Near the mountain, Kaleh Safid,. the Fahlian is joined by the Shul stream from the north—the main stream from the east being here called the Tang-i-Khast. It is 18 vards wide and 3 fee* deep, flowing very rapidly. — (Vide ^ 4 &amp;- 4 -Shur.) A village in the Haiat Baud district of Fars, 15 miles north by east of Ghanaveh. It contains 70 houses, inhabited by Lurs and old Persian tribes ; some of the houses are said to date from pre-Muhammadan time. The village stands on a plain where wheat and barley are grown. —(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) FEHRAJ— Lat. 31° 46'; Long. 54° 32' ; Elev. A large village, 17 miles (Abbott says 30) from Yazd on the road to Bafq. It is beautifully shaded by mulberry trees and its qandt brings cold snow water from Shir Kuh. It has a slender minaret of mud from which the towers of Yazd, 17 miles distant, can be seen.— (Stack.) FIDAGH— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Laristan, Persia, 87 miles north of Bandar Mugan and 39 miles south-south-east of Lar, on the road between them. There is a fortified enclosure here, described as somewhat solid, but with no guns. Water is procured from wells.— (Jones.) FEHRABARl or FARAKHURI— Lat. Long. Elev.FIDAGH, KtJH-I— Lat. Long. Elev.

They consist of sandstone and conglomerate, and rise a few hundred feet above the plain.— {Schindler.) FIJAIJAT— A sub-division of the Ban! Turuf ( 9 .?;.). FIDISKU EH— Lat. 28° 40' N. ; Long. 53° 45' E ; Elev. A large village in south-east Fars, 30 miles from Jehrum, on the road thence to Fasa. The village has Extensive fruit-gardens and excellent cultivation. Very good supplies are obtainable here, and the water-supply is abundant. The surrounding country is infested by gangs of robbers. Caravans usually hire escorts of 15 to 20 men armed with long guns when passing through this district.— (Stotherd, 1893.) FILAT —Lat. Long. Elev. A district occupied by the tribe of Mai Ahmadi Haft Lang Bakhtiari. It is passed through on the road from Qumisheh to Khuzistan. This is evidently the same as Falat and Falard.— (Layard.)

Wheat is largely cultivated.— {Sher Jang, 1902.) FlRGZABAD (1)— Lat. 28° 51' N. ; Long. 52° 33' E. ; Elev. A town in Fars, 72 miles south of Shiraz, and 119 miles from Bushire by road. It is the eighth stage on the Bushire-Jehrum road. Town and inhabitants. —Though prosperous, Firuzabad is now less im portant than it was in the middle ages, and (1893) has a population of 2,000, or if outlying villages are included, of 3,000. The town is surrounded by a mud wall and ditch, and there are a few plantations of date trees round it. It contains some 600 houses ; on the outskirts of the town is a large walled house, the residence of the IlkhanI of the Qashqai tribe, who is the ex-officio governor of Firuzabad and Farrashband. The town though walled is incapable of offering any resistance to an army, and is commanded by a low range of hills on the east side. The inhabitants are for the most part engaged in fruit-farming and cultivation, but there are also a few carpet-makers. The people are civil and disposed to be friendly. Firuzabad is the best place along the route to Niriz from Bushire via Jehrum. Its chief importance from a military point of view is that it is admirably situated for a halting-place and a supply depot. 2 c 2338 FIR—FIR Climate—This district enjoys a moderate climate and is generally healthy. The heat is never excessive. Colonel Taylor recommended it as being in every way eligible for a cantonment. Surrounding country .—The whole of the plain around the town is extreme ly fertile, and for Persia, well inhabited. It bears the same name as the town and is elevated, well watered, and bears rich wheat and famous rice. It is one of the best corn-producing and grazing districts in Persia. For the most part it is 7 miles wide, but at the south-eastern extremity narrows to 5 miles. Here it oidy produces grass, and has a rocky mountain ridge on either hand, that on the north-east rising to 2,000 feet. It had 30 villages about 50 years ago, but the number is now reduce to thirteen. It is watered by the Firuzabad river which has its source in the Dasht-Miik, and enters and leaves the plain by great gorges in the mountains which bound it. The river is full of fish. * Before arriving at Baba Najm it forces its way through three more of these gorges, the last of which has perpen dicular cliffs, 500 feet high ; it then joins its waters with those of the Kara Aghach and flows into the Mund river, vide this Gazetteer—Firuzabad and Mund rivers. Trade, Resources, Transport and Supplies .—Supplies here are good and much above the average. Rice, gram and barley are exported into the surrounding country, and fruits and rosewater to Bushire. The total value of exports does not exceed Rs. 4,000 annually. There are about 50 horses and a few ponies in the town, and some thousands of donkeys (tould be collected, as large numbers are employed on the caravan routes. Mules are very rarely seen in these parts. There is excellent camping-ground for a very large force here, and an abundant supply of good water for both men and animals. Firewood in large quantities could be obtained from Maimand, where there is stated to be any amount of wood of all sorts. History .—Near the town, about 4 miles to the north-west, are some ruins known as old Firuzabad or Kaleh Firuzabad, evidently once a considerable town and surrounded by a ditch and embankment, the former 40 to 50 paces in width, forming a wide circle nearly a mile in diameter. The original town was built by the Achsemenian, and subsequently embellished by the 8 assanian monarchs, and bore the name of Jur, Gur or Khur. The name “ Firuzabad ” or the “ Abode of Victory ” was subsequently given to it by the Asad-ud-Dauleh of the Buieh dynasty, in the tenth century. Here Ardashir Babakan built a palace and a great Atish-Gdh or fire temple. The remains now visible are briefly— (1) The Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, a ruined castle upon the heights command ing the Tang Ab, a defile to the north of the town. (2) Two Sassanian bas-reliefs sculped on the walls of the same defile. ( 3 ) The ruins of a great vaulted building, generally recognized as the palace of Ardashir. (4) A ruined tower, pillar or obelisk of unhewn masonry, commonly identified with the Atish-Gdh of Ardashir, though Perrot attri butes to it a secular or military origin. It is 12 feet square and 60 feet high, and forms a conspicuous landmark all over the plain. It retains traces of an outside winding ascent from terrace to terrace, like the Babylonian temples.(5) The remains of two tanks also supposed to have belonged to the Gabrs, or fire-worshippers. These are now the only remains of the former race, about whom the present inhabitants seem neither to know anything nor to care. Legend says that Alexander the Great built a dam at the gorge at the southern end of the plain, thus flooding the plain and destroying old Flruzabad. In a later generation, Flruz Shah broke the dam, drained the plain, and founded the modern town on which he bestowed his own name. Administralign. —Flruzabad is the official residence of the nominal II- khani of the Qishqai tribe of Fars, who is ex-officio governor of Flruzabad and Farrashband. With these distinctions the incumbent has to be content, the titular rank of Ilkhani being all that is left to him of tribal power. This is part of the policy of the government of the Shah, which in order more effectually to control the nomad element often summons them as hostages to the provincial capitals, or to Tehran. In the meantime, the headship of the tribe is vested in the Ilbegi, a sort of second-in-command,, who pays in to the provincial governor the revenue in the shape of a poll-tax upon their flocks and herds, which the collects from his followers. The terms upon which land is held in this district are as follows :—Land which is the private property of the former is cultivated at his sole expense, the labourers receiving in lieu of wages one-fifth of the produce ; out of the remainder the former accounts to Government for one-third as tax. When the labourer furnishes seed, plough, and labour he receives one-third, Government one-third, and the land-owner one-third of the produce. On the Crown lands the Government takes two parts of the produce, but furnishes seed and ploughs : the labourer gets the remainder. When the land belongs to the peasant, he cultivates it, giving one part of the produce to Government and keeping two parts for himself.

A town in Laristan, situated 156 miles from Bandar ’Abbas, 189 miles from Lingeh, and 197 miles from Shiraz.MO FUR—GAB The town is built in the form of a square with sides of about 400 yards, and is surrounded by a high mud wall, flanked at intervals of 75 yards by round mud towers, while a larger tower in the centre is used as a keep. There is, however, no ditch, and the defences are in a very dilapidated condition. Furg was formerly a place of some importance, but now, though the area within the walls is capable of containing over 1,000 people, the town has only from 100 to 150 inhabitants, while the total population of the Furg plain, exclusive of wandering Arabs, of whom many pitch their tents in the neighbourhood, does not exceed 500. The town is governed by a naib, who is subordinate to the Governor of Lar. It contains but few shops, but among the residents are to be found two or three small merchants, a butcher, a blacksmith, a tinsmith, and a couple of tailors. The people are armed with smooth-bore guns, some of European and others of native manufacture, amongst which are Tower muskets of 1859. Cheap English double-barrelled and single-barrelled guns are in use, but the ones preferred are either Tower muskets or guns of native manufacture, as they stand more rough usage. The people are fair marksmen, considering the roughness of their weapons', which carry about 200 yards with accuracy. Caravans from Bandar ’Abbas to Jehrum, Darab and Lar frequently pass through the town. Resources .—The principal crops raised in the district are wheat and barley, but Indian corn, opium, oranges and limes are also produced, as well as dates. There are three mills in the town for grinding grain, driven by water power. The transport available consists of 500 bullocks, 100 donkeys and 10 horses. The inhabitants own some 3,000 sheep and 6,000 goats. Excellent grazing for these is found in the surrounding hills which contain quantities of deer, hares, partridges and other game. Water is plentiful from wells, qandts, and streams, and from the Furg river which rises to the west of the town. Two miles to the south-east in an ancient fort, now in ruins, called Kaleh Bahman. Its walls are of solid masonry, in parts 15 feet thick, and it con tains several wells, now dry. West of the town is another fort. These ruins and the remains of ancient aqueducts and villages testify to Furg’s previous prosperity, while the fertility of the soil gives promise of what it might once more become under a better Government.— (Stack — Vaughan, 1888.)

The villages, in order from north to south, are distinguished as Shamali Miani and Qausi. The place is defended by half a dozen towers, and comprises altogether about 150 houses. The inhabitants are Lurs. A short way to the south of the villages is a creek called Khur Khalil deep enough to admit native boats of 25 tons burden ; but the anchorage for large vessels is at some distance off-shore, there being only 3 fathoms at 1| miles and the landing is bad at low water. Dates, wheat and barley are the chief pro ducts ; there are about 40 horses, 30 mules and 200 donkeys, and the fowls are said to be remarkably fine. Water good from wells. Ganaveh is governed by Murad Khan, son of an uncle of the Khan of Haiat Daud who resides here. A customs official is stationed at this place to prevent the smuggling of rifles into the country, but as yet the trade has suffered little from his interference. Near Ganaveh are some of the extensive ruins for which the Haiat Daud district is celebrated, marking the site of the Jannabeh of the mediaeval Arab and Persian geographers .—(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) GANAVEH (2)— Is 11| miles north-west of Bandar Rig. A port of Haiat Daud, 10 miles north of Bandar Rig, where a cousin of Haidar Khan’s resides.

GANDUMKAR or GANDUM-KAL— Lat. 31° 48' N. ; Long. 50° 50' E. A valley and mountain in the Bakhtiari country, the latter being a spur of the Kuh-i-Sard Ab. The Bakhtiari caravan road, on its 7th stage from Isfahan, traverses the former, and crosses the latter between miles 112 and lined with willows, a anas and oaks. Many hundreds of sheep and goats are met with in summer in and around the valley. The slopes of the moun tains are stony and covered with small oaks and other scrub and are alive with grey partridges in the early spring. The crests of the hills rise about 200 feet above the valley and form something of a circle. The surface of the road over the pass is, on the wiiole, good. The lower part of the Tang-i- Gandum-Kar is a narrow gorge between perpendicular heights. The stream, wLich is here perennial, finds its way down the Tang-i-Hazar Jarrb and emerges close above the Sarkhun caravanserai. Farther up the stream the gorge gives w r ay to a wide open basin. Up to the point where it reaches the hills which head the valley and basin, the ascent is gentle and the going good. It then becomes steep and stony and finally ascends up a steep hill in rivetted zigzags. The face of the hill is of loose stones and earth. The crest is the Garden-i-Gandum-Kar. It presents no serious obstacle to pack transport. There is a good camping-ground at Gandum-Kar, but no supplies at hand except fuel and water.— {Burton, 1904 — Arhuthnot, 1905 — Larimer, 1906.)

It consists of an open watershed connecting two valleys, viz., the Syehes and Pusht-i-Tang-i-Jumark. A high range of hills is south of it and a lower one to the north. The approaches to it are very easy. The hills and slopes on either side of it are well wooded, principally with dwarf oak. There is good ^ grazing upon it and immediately east of it is a small spring. It is a small * camping-ground of the Kalhur Kurds. Its elevation is 5,920 feet.— (Vaughan.) GARDANEH DARREH DARIGH— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on a road between the Asmanabad and Ivan valleys. It passes through Bankur after leaving Asmanabad. The pass is about 9 miles in length, and out of this 7 miles are either over rocks or else along a roadway strewn with loose stones. Its summit is reached at the 6th. mile from the northern side. The ascent from the north is not steep ; it runs over a series of rounded hills, each higher than the other, with the intervening ground nearly level. It runs through forest throughout. The summit of the pass is about 6,200 feet in height' the actual pass being 100 yards broad, between low, rounded hills which are easily accessible. The descent on the southern side into Ivan is down a narrow vallev with a dry water-course : lower down there are high cliffs some distance apart on either ^ side. The high ground above the cliffs being smooth, the rounded slope of the range easily accessible from the summit of the pass. The pass can be easily defended by a small force from any attempt to force it from the south. It could be defended by a large force from the north, but with con siderable difficulty, their line of retreat down the gorge, if the enemy gained the heights on either side, being cut off. The only water is at Chab Gam Gam, 2| miles north of the summit of the pass. It is turnable south-east and north-north-west by the Gardaneh Duruga, distant about 6 miles.— {Vaughan.)

A pass in Ears, 5 miles north-east of Kham Man. The ascent from the northern side runs up alongside a dry water-course, amongst big rocks, boulders and trees, and is impassable for guns. The top is open and level, and clothed in grass and trees. The descent on the southern side is at first alongside a ravine between two hills. The sides slope steeply and the road is impassable for guns. Then, crossing a low spur, the descent continues by a steep, zigzag road with a gradient of 15° down to the Khur valley, the total length of the descent being 2J miles. Horse flies are very troublesome ^ on this pass.— (Vaughan, 1891.) GARDANEH-I-AB BARlK, see KUTAL-I-ZARGHUN. GARDAN-I-AZAR DURAR— A pass over a low spur of the Kuh-i-Sufeh by which the post-road from Shiraz to Isfahan approaches the latter.

The tpo of the pass is marked by a ruined tower. About 200 yards beyond the tower and west of the road is an ab-ambdr. The tribesmen, who use this road in the spring and autumn migrations, say the supply of water in this reservoir never fails.— (Grahame, 1908.) GARDANEH-I-MAIDAN— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Ears on the road from Surian to Simakan, which is 20 miles south- --- east of Deh Bid ; the ascent from the north is in a sou h-east direction, gradually getting steeper until near the summit, when it is easier : as far as this point the road is narrow but not obstructed ; over the top it turns ^ south-west with a slight descent over undulating ground, till it reaches the bed of a mountain stream.

The summit is 1 mile from the northern side, and the descent thence is down a valley over loose stones. Its southern exit forms a good position facing south, the road for | of a mile after leaving it running within 800 yards range of the crest. The northern slope of it might form a position facing in that direction. It is turnable to the east by a road from Harunabad, which runs over or through the range, under a hill whose summit is marked by clump of trees 4 or 5 miles off ; and to the west by the road from Gardaneh Chah Zuyar to Gavarra.— {Burton.) GARDAN-I-SHAH NLSHIN— A ridge in the Pusht-i-Kuh division of Yuzd, over which the road from Deh Bid passes, 12 miles south-east of ’Aliabad. The road passes in places over slippery rock and would require to be improved for the passage of wheeled guns.— {Howe, 1906.) GARDANEH KAMAR ZARD— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on a road between Mandall and Kirmanshah city. It crosses the Kaluja range. The ascent from the Asmanabad valley on its south side is easy. The descent on the farther side, north into the Guar valley, is said to be, and is, probably, steep. The pass runs through oak trees. It is turnable to the north-west by the Gardaneh Amrula, dis tant about 4 miles, and to the south-west by the Gardaneh Vurmaziar. It is passable to laden mules, but not to field guns. Its elevation is about 6,000 f eet .—{V a ughan.) GABDANEH MILA NEH— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from the Kifraur valley into that of Gilan. It is on the Kaluja range. It is about 4 miles in length, the summit being 2| miles from the northern entrance. Its elevation is 5,495 feet. The pass runs through forest. The road is steep and rocky and in most parts covered with loose stones. The summit is about 300 yards broad between the peaks on either side. The descent on the southern side is veiy steep, and after the foot of it is reached there are numerous low hills to descend. It is impassable to guns, being a difficult mountain track. The. e is no water on it, but room for troops to rest under the trees on its sum mit. It forms a better defensible position facing, sou,h than to the north. The southern faces of the hills on both sides terminate in high cliffs, while to the north the hills descend in a gradual slope. It is turnable south-east by the Gardaneh Timanjik, distant 14 miles, and north-west by the Tang-i- Shashra, distant about 17 miles.— {Vaughan.) GARDANEH RUNU— Lat, Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from Deh Bala into the Ivan valley, and thence to Kirmanshah. The pass is 4| miles in length. Teh slopes on both sides of the summit are equally bad. The road crosses an immence ridge of upheaved crags which bar the exit of the Ivan valley to the south-east. The height of the pass is 5,650 feet. The road up it on both sides runs up a steep zigzag amongst loose stones, rocks and boulders overhung by oak trees. Mule-loads have to be carefully arranged as otherwise it is Pt. I. 2 d352 GAR—GAR impossible for them in places to pass. The summit consists of a pathway just broad enough for laden animals to pass between large rocks, which farther back are perpendicular masses of rock. Facing south the range, the Kuv-i-Zavil, is topped with cliffs several hundred feet in height. Its lower slopes are in many places concealed from any position that might be taken up at or close to the crest. At the same time, owing to the great difficulty of the ascent, the narrowness of the line of advance, and the ease with which the summit of the pass could be completely blocked with stones in a very short time, and held by a few riflemen, it is the most likely point at which opposition from the surrounding tribes might be expected in an advance in either direction along this line ; the more so as it is turnable east only by rounding the Manisht Kuh in that direction, and advancing up the Asmanabad valley, a detour of over 20 miles : while to the west it is not known to be turnable by any road nearer than Dubrideh, distant 30 miles, and involving a detour of many more.— (Vaughan.) GARDANEH SHISH DAE— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from Kirmanshah city, via the Ivan and Chavar valleys, to Deh Bala. Its summit is miles west of Deh Bala. The ascent to it from Chavar is an easy one along which a carriage might be driven. The descent into the Deh Bala valley is slight, the road winding about amongst low hills. The country through which the road to it runs is well covered with forest. It is overlooked by a range to the south and commanded thence within 800 yards. To the north the ground is broken, being full of ravines and hills, one of which flanks the road during the last 1| miles of the approach to the summit from the Chavar valley. The country north of it between it and the Manisht Kuh is said to possess one footpath by which mountaineers can get from one valley into the other, but there is said to be no water on it. The summit of the pass, whose elevation is 5,540 feet, consists of low, rounded hills, passable anywhere for several hundred yards. The pass could easily be turned by troops moving along the north slope of the range south of it.— (Vaughan.) GARDANEH TIMANJIK— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass of Kirmanshah on the road from Gilan up the Chila valley to the. north-west end of the Guar valley and thence to Kirmanshah. It crosses the Kaluja range at the east foot of the Kachal Kuh, the highest peak of the range. The ascent from the south is easy, but the descent into the Guar valley to the north is very steep. At the bottom of this descent is a ruined caravanserai on a road from Sar-i-Pul to Harunabad. The pass is turnable to the east by the Gardaneh Amrula, distant 1| miles, and to the west by the Gardaneh Mila Neb, distant abou 15 miles. It is of the same height as the Gardaneh Amrula. The hill it crosses is well- wooded. The summit of Kachal Kuh, about 4 miles off, would form a good signalling station. This pass is said to be easier than the Gardaneh Amrula. It is passable to laden mules, but not to field guns. Its eleva tion is about 6,300 feet,— (Vanghan.) GARDANEH VURMAZIAR— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Kirmanshah on one of the roads from Mandall to Kirmanshah city via Harunabad. It crosses the Kaluja range.

A pass in Laristan, which crosses the Kuh Zahml range 2J miles north east of the village of Bahristan, and over which the road leads from Bushire to Bandar ’Abbas. It was traversed in 1888 by Butcher, who thus described it “ The mouth of the pass is about J mile broad, but, as we ascend in a direction north by east, decreases to about 20 or 30 yards, the hills on either side sloping up very precipitously or in cliff-like sections. The defile slopes gently upwards and presents no difficulty, till at 2 miles 2 furlongs it is barred by an abrupt rise of about 60 feet in 100 yards, giving a slope of about 30°. On surmounting this slope we find a sm^l, level space, covered with good grass, from which we can see down the gorge for some distance. At this point the pass becomes more difficult and rugged, and continues for 6 furlongs to rise by alternate ascents and descents. At 2 miles 7 furlongs, looking southward down the pass a portion of the valley and the range of Haft Chah are visible between the precipitous sides of the gorge. Two furlongs farther up, this vista is again afforded us. The pass now becomes very steep and difficult, .between huge, jugged rocks so close together as hardly to afford room for loaded fnules to pass. On nearing the summit we ascend over smooth, rocky strata, sloping upwards, and pass on uncovered and empty cistern close to the east side of the road. At 3 miles 3 furlongs is the summit. From this point hlso a portion of the valley to the south is visible between the walls of the gorge. To northward we have an uninterrupted view down the northern slope of the range Balimi, and across the valley lying at its foot. The pates called “ Zarguzadun, ” on the northern side of the range, winds for a short distance round the brink of a deep crevice or chasm, which splits thi$ slope of the range almost from top to bottom. The path is both narrow and steep, at times just leaving sufficient room for loaded mules to pass. At 4 miles 4 furlongs (1 hour 38 minutes occupied in the descent) we reach the foot of the pass called “ Damimansur, ” a green, grassy spot dotted with a few kdndr and other bushes, ground undulating with low hills round about. The pass over the range Zalimi is practicable for infantry and mule batteries, but not for wheeled transport or field artillery. This pass might be turned by marching round the south-east extremity of the range Zalimi, which route, I believe, presents no difficulties. The range on either side of the pass is rocky and precipitous, and wmuld be diffi cult for infantry to cross, at least for any considerable body. The road, after leaving Damimansur, trends east-north-east, and is fairly easy going- — (Buicler, 1888.)GARD AN-I-ZIRREH— Lat. Long. Elev. 8,686'. A pass over the Zirreh mountains between Ardal and Shalamzar, on the Shushtar-Isfahan road. The ascent from the north side is steep and rough'—a rise of 2,000 feet. This kutal separates the Chehar Mahal from the Bakhtiari country proper. In one place on the northern side, the path passes through narrow rocks, where loaded mules have to be got through carefully. There is a small lake near the southern end of the pass on the plain. The road is blocked for mules in winter. The descent to the south is not difficult and is only a drop of 600 ieeb.—(Sawyer.)

GARGAR (River)— This channel, the uppermost part of which is artificial, issues from the left bank of the Karun just above Shushtar, and rejoins that river at Band-i- Qir. Its direction is thus almost exactly from north to south and its length in a straight line about 30 miles, but between its extreme points it forms a regular curve to eastwards, of which the maximum divergence from the direct line is about 8 miles. The Gargar forms the eastern boundary of the Mian-Ab island. At its head are the remains of a massive barrage, formerly called the Band- i-Kaisari and later the Band-i-Shahzadeh, and now known as the Band-i- Nurgan, built of hewn stone, with six narrow openings through which the water passes, leaving the crest dry and traversable except when the river is high and pours over it. Below this barrage the stream flows for | mile through a channel of 100 feet depth, artificially excavated in the sandstone rock : it then reaches a second dam cabed Pul-i-Bulaiti which carries theroad from Shushtar to all places east of it. At the Pul-i-Bulaiti the water is forced into tunnels in the precipitous rock, which conduct it through a number of flour mills built in the honeycombed rock side of the channel a little farther down. Below this dam the rock of the banks yields to earth, but the sides continue to be nearly 100 feet in height till the end of Shushtar town is reached. Half a mile below the Pul-i-BulaitI a natural ledge of rocks crosses the channel, with an opening in it only 20 yards wide but passable for native river boats. The stream then splits into three or four small but navigable channels, and so continues to a point 5 miles lower down, where the river-bed is again nearly traversed, by another barrier, partly natural, partly artificial, by which the course of the stream is considerably deflected to the east and made to form an acute angle ; this place is called Mahi-Bazan or Bazaniat, meaning in the Shushtari patois “ a place where fish play,” from the numbers of fish which come there to spawn and are caught. On the right bank 7 or 8 miles below Shushtar is the important landing place of Shalaill, above which there is not, for practical purposes, any navigation, either native or European. From Mahibazan to a short ■distance above Band-i-Qir the Gargar meanders through low ground several hundred yards broad, enclosed up on either side by steep clay banks from 40 to 50 feet high, with which the river in its windings from time to time comes in contact. As Band-i-Qir is approached the high banks close in upon the river and show remains of brick buildings, vestiges of the ancient city of ’Askar Mukaram ; parts of these are sunk as much as 10 and even 20 feet below the present surface of the ground. At Band-i-Qir the banks do not ordinarily rise more than 18 feet above the river in its lowest season ; and in the high season, during floods, they are frequently overflowed. The width of the Gargar varies from 50 to nearly 100 yards, and at Band-i-Qir it is about 60. The flood discharge of the Gargar is about 7,000 cubic feet a second, but in March 1905 the discharge at Band-i- Qir was only about 2,000. Owing to the height of the bank the river does not lend itself naturally to purposes of irrigation, but in some places there are small inundation canals watering low- lying lands. The silt of the Gargar at its maximum is only about one- e’ghtieth of its volume. The navigation of the Gargar is difficult chiefly on account of the sinu- nsities and the narrowness, in places, of the channel, of which the breadth varies from 20 to 40 yards ; with a low river obstacles in the shape of stones, sand-spits and tree stumps are super-added. The Shushan which runs from Ahwaz to Shalaili at all seasons of the year, is a stern-wheeler, 100 feet in length over all, with a beam of 23 feet, and draws 3 feet of water, when carrying 30 tons of cargo ; her barge, 65£ feet by 15| feet, carrying 50 tons of cargo on a mean draught of 3 feet, can only be used in a good river. A longer vessel could not negotiate some of the turns, and an ordi nary paddle-steamer would find some of the channels too narrow. The average depth of the Gargar in the low season is from 6 to 4£ feet, but the channels are subject to perpetual alteration in consequence, chiefly, of sandbars, which are thrown across the river by small tributaries during the last freshets of spring. These the reduced river of the summer season is unable to wash away, and they often give soundings, of as little as 2|GAR—GAR 359 feet o£ water. Among the large tributaries are the Malih, 6 miles below Hilaleh, the Chai-un-Naft coming down, 2 miles below KraidI, from the neighbourhood of the naphtha-springs in the Ramuz district ; and the Haddam, 1 mile below Saiyid Hasan ; these are all upon the left bank and contain water only after rain. Tree-stumps and similar snags are common in he middle reaches of the Gargar ; many of them are known and can be avoided, but new ones are frequently met with when the river falls. About 2 miles above Band-i-Qir the river contains piles of old cuttle fish which make the passage dangerous in the low season, and also afford a point of formation for sand-banks. The times of the river’s rise and fall vary from year to year, and the difference between the summer and v inter levels is also inconstant ; but by the middle of June the water has ordinarily fallen to a low level, ard continues decreasing until the first rains of winter fall at the end of October, or the beginning of November. The discoloration in flood time is of a light buff hue. The current varies from 5 to 2 knots, and is strongest in the upper reaches near Shushtar. Since 1894 the Shushan has plied regularly on the Gargar at all seasons, but when the river is low she frequently runs aground or strikes the banks, and sometimes sustains injury. The only fuel is wood, which'all comes from the banks of the Diz, and of which 15 tons are used on the trip from Ahwaz to Shalaill and back. Shalaili is the port for Shushtar from which it is distant some 7 miles by road. There is no landing stages at this place ; the steamer merely being moored up against the mud bank. A fuel depot is maintained at Band-i-Qir. The time occupied by the steamer between Band-i-Qir and Shalaili is from 20 to 30 hours in ascending, and from 9 ^ h£ urs . in descending, according to the state of the river.— (Arbuthnot, 1905—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

A village reported t© be 5 stages from Khuzistan, the mountain range intervening being crossed by a large pass.— {Wilson and Cruickshank, 1907.) GUNJANCHUM— See KUNJIAN CHAM. GUPAL— A brackish stream which traverses the great plain common to the Ramuz and Ahwaz districts of ’Arabistan, forming a somewhat serious obstacle on the road between Nasirl and Ramuz town. The Gupal consists at first of merely the surplus water of a canal which takes off from the right bank of the Ramuz river at a piont about 5 miles east of Ramuz town. At about 4 miles north of the town the water of the canal is augmented by a brackish tributary, which has its rise in the gypsum hills bounding the Ramuz district on this side ; the increased stream continues to flow north-westwards, keeping within a mile of the hills and parallel to them, until the mounds of Kut-ash- Shaikh are passed, lying about 2 miles to the southward. Three or four miles on the Gupal changes direction to the south-west, and so passes about 6 miles north of the village of Mirbacheh. Near this it receives on the left bank two tributaries, the fresh stream which has its course about a mile eastward of Mirbacheh, and the salt Muwailhah stream. About 9 miles after passing Mirbacheh a salt stream from the north called the Kindak falls into the Gupal on its right bank. Eventually about 12 miles west of Mirbacheh the Gupal intersects the usual route between Nasiri and Ramuz ; there is some choice of crossing places. At this point in its course the water of the Gupal is salt even after rain. The banks, which are in most parts perpendicular and of clay, rise about 20 feet above the level of the bed, and the distance between them varies from 20 to 70 yards. In summer the Gupal is almost dry ; in winter it sometimes rises 20 or 30 feet and overflows its banks and at that season it may be found either fordable or unfordable. Quicksands occur. About 300 yards below that points the river bends to the west, and 8 miles farther on it is drawn off in a southerly direction in numerous small canals, some of which, being 3 feet deep, are difficult to cross. The Gupal now ceases to exist and the surplus water which is not used for the cultiva tion spreads out to form the Shakheh marsh. {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)382 GUR—GUR GGR— Lat. 28° 51' N. ; Long 52° 33' E. ; Elev. The ancient name of Firuzabad (q.v.) also Ardashir Khuirih. It was one of the principal town of the Sassanians. Istakhri speaks of it as follows : “ Gur is one of the foundations of Ardashir—hence the name Gur, or 4 foundations. ’ It is reported that the place where it stands was filled with stagnant water and resembled a lake, and that Ardashir made a vow to build a town on the spot where he should conquer his enemies, and to con struct on it a fire temple, and he was victorious at Gur. He contrived to remove the water of the place by making an opening for the water to flow away ; and he built on that spot ‘ Gur.’ ” (For further descriptions see Durand.) In short the town would seem to have been built by Ardashir Babakan, the founder of the Sassanian dynasty, on the site of an older town, Gur, and he then changed the name to Ardashir Khuvrih, or “ the glory of Ardashir. ” In the 10th century it was taken Iby Azad-ud-Daulat, who was of the Dilamite dynasty, which held the mastery in Fars in the 10th and part of the 11th centuries. The name then became Firuzabad at the dictates of its new master.— {Durand.) GURAB— Lat. Long. Elev. ( Pass, 8,650'. 1 Valley, 6,000'.

The pass (8,650 feet) is one south of the Chari pass, and connects the valley of the Bazuft on the west with the valley of its own name on the east. The latter is perfectly flat, about 4 miles wide by 10 miles long, flanked by the Kuh- i-Isbanieh on the north, and has an elevation of 6,800 feet. A small stream, the Dinar Rud, flows through it with a south-easterly course, and later falls into the Karun river at 5,300 feet, just before that river enters the Tang-i-Ardal.— {Sawyer, 1890 — Arbuihnot, 1905.)

A village in the Tangistan district of Fars, two miles south of ’Ali Changi on the road between Bushire and Ahram, of which it is the inter mediate stage. It contains 50 houses mostly of Shi’ah Saiyids. They are supposed to be of the line of ’Abbas, but their pedigree is doubtful, conse quently they are treated with little respect by their neighbours. Their claim to wear black turbans has, however, recently been admitted by the Sadr-ul-Islam of Bushire. They are renowned as cheats and swindlers.

Good water is obtained from one well, while there are several others with good drinking water for animals. Firewood is rather scanty. Good camping-grounds are available. From here a road runs south by west connecting the sea-coast villages of the district. The place was at one time called also Mir ’Abdullah. The Gurak ridge, and which it apparently does not, is important as offering a position facing south-west to a force advancing on Bushire from the east or south-east. It commands the low-lying sandy country towards Bushire and has a mean elevation of 300 feet above the plain. The northern or right flank is the weakest, and is open to a turning movement under cover of date plantations. The same ridge would also afford a position facing north-east to a force covering Bushire against a force advancing from the east. Its extreme length would, however, necessitate a very strong body of troops to occupy it adequately. It would afford some good artillery positions covering the plain towards the main mountain ridges.

HAFFAR (Canal)— An artificial canal, forming the short reach by which the river Karun after the out take of the Bahmanshlr, discharges its water into the Shatt- al- Arab. Colonel Bell says that three-fourths of the water of the river Karun comes this way. The canal is between 2 and 3 miles Ion- 400 yards wide and has a depth of from 3 to 4 fathoms. The head^of the canal where the Bahmanshir takes out of the Karun is 60 miles above the bar outside the Shatt-al- Arab, 40 miles above the entrance to that estuary at fiau, and 20 miles below the Turkish port of Basrah. When this canal was cut no one knows Mr. Watson, in his History of Persia, says it was cut by Alexander the Great in order to avoid the necessity of sailing down the Karun into the Persian Gulf, but there appears to be no ground for this hypothesis. Its construction was presumably intended to open commu nication from the Karun to the Shatt-al-’Arab, and thus promote trade between Arabistan and the then existing predecessors of the Turkish fi° r ! S ^ f Srah f! 1 ? ^ a g hd ^ d - Some authorities on the other hand believe that the Shatt-al- Arab once flowed into the Karun by this channel instead of vice versa as at present, and that the united river then found’ the sea by the Bahmanshir channel : this, however, does not appear to be a likelv hypothesis. y On the north banks stands the town of Muhammareh {q.v ) on the southern side are the ruins of an old Persian fort where 60 years ago’the Shaikh used to reside, and which, in co-operation with larger works on the northern banks, attempted to dispute the entrance of the river with the British m 1857.

(Chick, mo.)HAIAT DiCD and RlG (District)— The most northern district, if we except the town of Bandar Dilam, belonging to the province of the Gulf Ports on the coast of Pars. Its capital is Bandar Rig, and the district is situated on the coast of the Persian Gulf between the Liravl district on the north and the Rudhilleh district on the south. Limits .—The Haiat Daud district is bounded on the west by the sea- The eastern boundary in the northern part meets the Kash KulT branch of the Qashqai, some 15 miles north of a range of hills, called Kuh-i-Haiat Daud, about 15 miles inland ; and in the southern part the boundary is a salt stream called Rudkhaneh-i-Shur, which comes down from a hill called Bikarzwa-Mishan dividing it from the Shabankareh district. The most northern village is Bahmiari and on the south the district extends almost to the Rudhilleh°stream ; its maximum length consequently is 40 miles ; but its extent upon the coast is less, as in the north it is overlapped upon the sea by the Liravi district which contains Kuh-i-Bang. The island of Kharak belongs to the Haiat Daud district. Physical Geography—The whole district appears to be a plain ; it has good soil in certain localities and is intersected by water-courses, some of considerable size, which traverse it from the hills to the sea. Close to Ban dar Rig there is an outcrop of light grey sandstone. The chief features of the coast are a creek, called Khur Qusair, frequented by large boats, mid way between Bandar Rig and the Rudhilleh stream ; and Khur Khalil, a tidal inlet, 1 mile south of Ganaveh, which is used by the boat owners of that place. Population.—k list of the villages of Haiat Daud is subjoined under the heading of topography. The people are mostly Lurs whose ancestors immigrated from the Behbehan province, partially submerging an ancient Persian population whom local tradition represents as having continued to be Gabars or fire-worshippers till about five centuries ago. In some places there is an infusion of Arabic blood and the village of Gumarun is a settlement of Saiyids. The total number of the inhabitants appears to be about 12,000 souls. The Persian language with Lurish modifications is ' practically universal, so also is the Shi’ah form of the Muhammadan reli gion. Inland the people are cultivators, and upon the coast cultivators, sea-farers and fishermen. Outside of Bandar Rig huts are the only kind of dwellings. The generality of the inhabitants are peaceable and partially civilised, but they are well armed with Martinis and possess, it is said, on the average about one rifle to every house. From January to April the population is swollen by Dareh Shuri and Kashkuli Iliats, who camp in the vicinity of Bandar Rig and make their purchases for the year in the town. , • • , Agriculture and Livestock.—Wheat and barley are the agricultural staples but dates also are cultivated. The banyan, fig and castor-oil plant flourish. There appear to be few cattle, but sheep are numerous and are estimated to amount to 10,000 in the whole district. Water is all from wells. Trade .—The subject of trade is disposed of in the article of Bandar Rig, through which all the external trade of the district passes. The internal trade is of no account.HAI—HAI 391 Transport and communications. —The district, it is believed, apart from the town of Bandar Rig, can furnish about 350 horses, 250 camels, 150 mules and 2,000 donkeys. There appear to be no serious obstacles to the move ment of transport. It is possible to march along the coast, and the inland route from Borazjun to Zaidan traverses the district via the villages of Char Rusta, Gah Safid, ’Abbasi, Mahmad Sadi and Bahmiari; there is also a route from Bandar Rig to Deh Kuhneh in the Shabankareh district. Haidar Khan Administration. —The district is governed by a hereditary Khan of Lur descent, who has his residence at Bandar Rig and is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. At present he pays 8,000 tumdns yearly for the farm of the district. Criminal justice is dispensed by this Khan and by one of his brothers who acts as his deputy at Char Rusta. Documents are attested and civil disputes are settled in every village by the local Kazi or Mulla, except matrimonial cases which it is usual to refer to the Kazi or Mulla of some neighbouring village. The general administration is conducted through the headmen of the villages, who in this district are termed Raids. There are no regular police, but the retainers of the Khan look to the safety of the roads. Land-revenue is collected at the rate of 60 or 70 krdns per gdu of cutivation ; there are no other taxes. The only direct representatives of the Persian Government are a postmaster and a telegraph master at Bandar Rig and Persian Custom officials at Bandar Rig and Ganaveh. Armed forces.—The, armed forces at the disposal of Haidar Khan are estimated at 1,500 to 2,000 tufangchis in normal times. In May 1909, Haidar Khan despatched some 400 armed men to Bushire to assist the Daria Begi in his expedition to Tangistan. Haidar Khan can also dispose of the armed forces of Rud Hilleh, some 700 tufangchis, as well as the con tingents of Ganaveh and Liravi, numbers unknown. Haidar Khan afforded courageous personal assistance to the British Resident, and H.M.S. Highflyer, in arresting pirates at Ganaveh in 1908. History. —The district abounds with ruins and traces of an extreme civilization which have not yet (1905) been investigated ; and there is muck mention, in local traditions, of fire-worship surviving to a comparatively recent period. The bricks found at some of the old sites are said to resemble those of Ctesiphon. A century ago, the town of Bandar Rig was in the possession of a family of the Zab tribe, who are now found chiefly in Trucial Oman ; another account says that the Mir tribe, under Mir Muhanna, were in possession of the town. According to this version the Mirs came from Hindiagan and drove the Persian officials from Bandar Rig, and, at a later date, the Dutch from their settlement on Kharak island. They are said to be the descendants of Mir Muhanna at Kuvait. The leader of the Zab is said to have been Mir Mahran, but he was killed in a practical expedition against Basrah ; the tribe consequently lost their hold on the place, and were succeeded by a family of Lurs whose founder had been a follower of Mir Muhanna. These maintained their position until about 1870 when the father of the present Khan of Bandar Rig, who was already Khan of the Haiat Daud district, succeeded in removing the Bandar Rig Khan of that day, the grandson of the first Lur Khan, by treacherously throwing him down a well at Arash, which he then caused to be filled up. He then in corporated the Khanate of the town with his own rural Khanate.HAI—HAJ' 393 HAIDAR! (I)— Lat. Long. Elev.

HAJAMAL or SHUR or DUNDIL (River)— A river in Laristan which rises in the hills north of Hormuz, and, passing under the west .side of that village, flows in a generally south-easterly direc tion. Its waters are salt and in the month of April are very scanty. The Lar-Bandar ’Abbas road follows its course for many miles, lying sometimes on one bank and sometimes on the other, and occasionally, as when it enters the Tang-i-Shu and the Tang-i-Dalan, lying in the bed of the river itself. The bed is for the most part shallow, with shelving banks and a pebbly, sandy bottom. It varies in width from 100 to 200 yards except where it passes through the defiles above-mentioned, when the channel becomes much narrower, at one point in the Tang-i-Dalan not exceeding 30 yards. The road continues to follow the stream, which, befow the Tang-i-Shuk, is called the Shur, as far as Jlhun, beyond which they separate—the road continuing on its old alignment towards Bandar ’Abbas, the river taking a sudden bend to the south. Its subsequent course is not accurately known, but it probably joins the Rud-i-Kul another salt water stream which flow T s into the sea at Khamlr, some miles above its mouth. {Butcher, April 1888.)

Several ruined water reservoirs of large size are to be found a quarter of a mile south of the ruins, two of which measured 150 by 40 feet and in 1857 were still 24 feet deep. A qandt led from these to the town, nearly \ a mile in length, cut in the solid rock and running at its deeper end 20 feet below the sufrace : it had about 10 shafts at intervals of 15 to 20 yards apart, and the bottoms of the shafts were accessible in four cases by a stairway of shallow steps cut in the rock. It contains no water now. The history of Al-Wassaf written in the 12th century may be consulted regarding this place and its trade.

On its northern side it is bordered by two parallel hill ranges, called Minlur and Misdakh. The limits of the district are otherwise indefinite. As one porceeds from Nasiri to Hawizeh, extensive wheat and barley cultivation by hamlet com munities dependant on Hawizeh commences some 15 miles east of that place and extends intermittently up to it. Similar cultivation extends again intermittently from Hawizeh to Shu’aib ; in fact the whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib and Kish-i-Basri is regularly occupied and cultivated in patches more or less frequent and extensive in proportion to the rainfall by the Arab tribes of Bani Salih and Bani Sakain, dependant on Hawizeh and Shu’aib. Although mainly dwellers in tents these can hardly be recognized as nomads in the'-'sense that the Kashgai are nomadic, but must rather be looked upon as settled inhabitants. In the winter they spread themselves all over the tract in small tent dwelling communities—families or clans pasturing their flocks and cultivating the land around them. As soon as they have gathered their harvest, in the month of May and sold or stored their produce, they break up their encampments, and while a proportion remain with their404 HAW-HAW flocks in and around Hawizeh and Shu’aib and the marshy ground north of these centres, the rest, probably the majority, migrate to the date gardens of the Karun and the Shatt-al-Arab where like our hop-pickers in Kent, they find employment for the summer months, returning after the date harvest at the end of September or early in October to make preparations for their winter camp. The nomads appear to number 60,250 souls. The chief exports of the district are rice, fish and a certain amount of the plumage of birds. Frontier and Jurisdiction.—To the eastward of the village of Shu aib, or rather of the marsh on the edge of which it is situated, and southwards as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction nor of Turkish status. The marsh is clearly a natural boundary. The Bani Salih and Bani Sekain tribesmen who exclusively inhabit, and, where possible, cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh which has been a recognized district of the Persian Province of Khuzistan or ’Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal Shaikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula, ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid, or did not pay, the Central Government, until 1902, at whi h juncture, fortunately for the Persian Government, the Shaikh of Mohammareh assumed responsibility for the district, since when the tribesmen have paid revenue and become definitely submissive to him. The point of vital importance is that Hawizeh and the “ Hawizeh district should remain with Persia in its ent rety, the reason being that it has always formed an integral' part of the province, and that the possession of it is strategically essential for the security of ’Arabistan. As at present constituted, the Hawizeh district is very securely protected on the north and west by geographical features, and this fact relieves the Shaikh of Mohammerah, as Warden of the Marches, of a great measure of anxiety in regard to the frontier in this direction. It is clearly important that these conditions should endure, and should be fixed on the basis of the natural features existent. Since 1902 the Shaikh of Muhammareh has assumed responsibility for the revenue of the district, and Hawizeh has been included in the administra tive division of Southern ’Arabistan .—[Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908 Resident's Report, 1912.) HAWIZEH (Town)—Lat. 31° 24' N. ; Long. 48° 9' E. ; Elev. A town in Southern ’Arabistan, situated about 40 miles west by noith of Nasiri in the centre of the Hawizeh district, of which it is the capital. Formerly a large town, it was ruined by the bursting in 1837 of the dam at Eahr Hashim on the Karkheh river, which upset the whole irrigation system of the district, caused the main stream of the Karkheli to take a more north erly course, and reduced the town, which stood on the left bank of its former bed, to comparative insignificance. Hawizeh whatever it may have been in its palmy days, is, at the present time, a dilapidated and squalid settlement of mud-built dwell ings. The resident population is about 2.000 souls. Signs of the foriher more extensive settlement are still of course plen iful. in the shape of ruined houses, and compound walls, while numerous imams or shiinesHAW-HAZ 405 scattered far and wide in the neighbouring country bear evidence to its - former prosperity. The settlement is situated on both banks, but mainly on the left or west bank of a stream from 50 to 100 yards wide and, in April, 4 to 5 feet deep in mid-channel, which flows from the direction of Kut Nahr Hashim, and is said by the inhabitants to be the Kerkha, though it can only be one of the many tentacles of that river. The inhabitants say that, at the present day, this stream gives a regular flow for eight months in the year, from November to June inclusive, but, during the remain'ng four months, it dries up and they are reduced for their drinking supply to water holes sunk in the bed. From November to June they have a regular highway by water to Shu’aib, and thence to Amarah on the Tigris, and this accounts for the fact that they trade with Amarah rather than Nasiri. The water of Hawlzeh town is now bad as well as scanty, but it remains the seat of the hereditary Vali, who governs it and its immediate neighbour hood under the Shaikh of Muhammareh. Hawizeh in the 14th century A.D. was one of the most flourishing places in ’Arabistan, and the centre of a dis trict which produced corn, cotton and sugarcane. The Sabian community already existed at that time.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.—Political Report, 1912.) HAZAR CHAM— Lat. Long. Elev. 6,750'. A small spring in the Bakhtiari country and a halting place for caravans 116 miles from Dizful on the road to Kaleh Bazuft, and 14 miles from the latter. No supplies, but good grazing.— (McSwiney, 1891.) HAZAR DARREH— The name given to the Bakhtiar! range in Khuzistan to the east of Behbehan.— (Chesneij .) HAZAR JARlB— Lat. 33° 6' N. ; Long. 50° 5' E. ; Elev. A village in the Farldan division of the Isfahan province. It is govern ment property and inhabited by about 100 Armenian families, who pay yearly taxes to the amount of 410 tumdns —Rs. 1,640. It lies 3 miles west of Zarneh and 108| miles from Isfahan on the road to Burujird.— (Schindler.) HAZAR YAK (TANG-I-) —Lat. Long. Elev. 4,950/ A narrow, deep valley, in the Bakhtiari country, running north and south between spurs of the Garreh mountain for about 5 miles. Its southern exit debouches into the northern end of the Hilisat valley, with the river of which name the stream that runs down it merges.— (Morton, 1905- - Arbuthnot, 1905.) HAZBEH— „ r ^ &gt;T - A section of the Ka’b tribe ((pv.). . HAZIR MIL— Some springs of water 93 miles south-south-east of the site of Kurdish camps in a grass-grown valley, which runs down to the plain of Tumatuma on the Deh Bala-Dizful-road. Some of the ground is cultivated, and the grazing on the adjacent spurs and mountains is’ very abundant. There is no fuelnear, and the mountains on the southern aspect are quite bare of trees. The road from the Mama pass to Tumatuma runs through Hazir Mil.— (Burton.) HlADIR— A sub-division of the Bani Saleh tribe (q.v.). HILALAT— A section of the Muhaisin tribe (q.v.). HILALEH, vide GARGAR (AB-I-). HILISAT— Lat. 31° 44' N. ; Long. 50° 41' E. ; Elev. 4,850'. A village in the Bakhtiari country, situated in a valley of the same name, through which the Bakhtiari caravan road runs for a few miles on leaving the caravanserai at Sarkhun, on its 8th stage from Isfahan. The valley runs almost due north and south, the village being situated on the left bank of a stream of the same name. The valley is well cultivated with wheat and barley, but the village itself has a poor aspect and supplies are scarce at some seasons of the year. It belongs to peasant proprietors. 54,000 lbs. of grain and 13,000 lbs. of rice are sown annually. The number of houses is estimated, in 1906, at 400, and of fighting-men at 500. The livestock comprises 40 horses, 30 mules, 5,000 donkeys, 500 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. 200,000 mans of wheat and barley are produced annually. 500 tumdns cash, 100 mans of rice and 30 of (jhi are paid in revenue annually. There is a tax of 10 krdns on each mare, 5 krdns on each pair of oxen and 4 krdn on sheep.— (Preece, 1895 — Arhuthnot, 1905—Report of a Journey through the Bakhtidri Country to Shushtar — Lorimer, 1906.) HILISATI (AB-I-)— Lat. Long. Elev. 4,900' (at spring head). A stream in the Bakhtiari country, which bursts out at the foot of a great, precipitous wall of the Kuh-i-Sarkhun, immediately facing the caravanserai of the same name, and, running an almost due southerly course, waters the Hilisat valley. The water at its spring head, where it is crossed by a wooden bridge, is of crystal purity, and gushes out with such force as to form a fair sized stream before it has run a course of 20 yards. Its total length is about 20 miles, when it falls into the Karun river at about the 152nd mile of the latter’s course, and at 3,550 feet above sea-level.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.) H1MMATABAD— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Kirman, 81 miles from the town of that name, on the road to Yazd. It contains about 60 houses, and has a qandt of brackish water. (Wood, October 1899.) HlMUN— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Tihran-Karvan district, 6 miles north-north-west of Var- pusht to the left of the road from Isfahan to Burujird.— (Schindler.) HINDARABl— Lat. (N. W. tower of village fort) 26° 41' 9'; Long. 53° 37' 31'. An island near the coast of the Shibkuh district: its eastern extremity is about 4| miles west-north-west fo Chiru. Hindarabi is over 4 miles inHIN—HIN 407 length from east to west and nearly 3 miles in breadth : and separated from the mainland by a strait, 4 miles broad, the navigation of which is very dangerous. It is of a brown colour, and rises gradually from the side to a flat centre about 100 feet above sea-level. There is no natural vegetation except a certain amount of grass in spring. The island is fringed by a reef which impedes landing at low water, and is surrounded by pearl banks except at one place on the east side. About the middle of the north shore is situated the village of Hindarabi, in which are about 100 houses of ’Ubaidli Arabs, Sunnis ; it possesses wells of which the water is brackish in summer, a few banyan trees and some cultivation of wheat and barley ; the flocks and herds amount to about 50 cattle and 100 goats. There are about 400 date-palms, chiefly on the west side of the village. The people are mostly fishermen and pearl-divers owning 15 or 20 small craft, baqdrehs and shu’ais, which they use for fishing in winter and for pearling, near the island in summer. Hindarabi island is subject to the ’Ubaidli Shaikh of Chlru whose local representative is styled Naib. About a quarter of the fighting men are armed with modern rifles.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) The harbour is safe and commodious, and a vessel is well sheltered in it from a north-west wind. The water is deep close to the land, with fathoms and a soft mud bottom. The strait of Hindarabi is formed by the island and the mainland. It has regular soundings all over until you approach the reef of Ras-ul-Chiru, when it suddenly shoals from 17 to 10, 5 and 4 fathoms, under which depth a vessel should not go. There is no danger outside 5 fathoms towards the island, of 4 fathoms on the spit, the channel between these having from 22 to 27 fathoms. The narrowest part is between the island and Chlru reef, being there only one mile wide. A course, one-third over from the island in passing Ras-ul-Chiru, will be found the best.— (Bracks.) HINDIAN (District)— The most eastern and one of the most extensive districts in Southern ’Arabistan. The name is locally pronounced Hindian. According to local tradition the Hindian district was once held by the Portuguese. Extent. —The Hindian district is enclosed on the south by the Persian Gulf ; on the west by a khait, or strip of slightly elevated land, which runs more or less parallel to the Hindian river about midway between it and Bandar Ma’shur ; on the north by a line traversing part of the Shah Nabi plain eastwards to some hills, along which it continues to a point near Gargarl, a distance in all of about 15 miles ; on the east by a line which cuts obliquely across the maritime range from Gargarl to a point on the coast between Shah Abul Shah and Bandar Dllam. This district has thus a length upon the coast of about 50 miles and a depth inland of about 30 miles. Physical characteristics. —Neglecting the hills which run from the north-east corner of the district to the neighbourhood of the sea at Shah Abul Shah and which encroach but little on the surface of the district, we may say that the Hindian district consists wholly of plains. The soil is saline in places, but generally it is good and firm ; and the prairies, grass-covered after rain, seem to offer every advantage for the breeding of cattle and408 HIN—HIN horses. The chief feature of the district is the Hindian river —for a descrip tion of which vide this Gazetteer. The sea is shallow upon the Hindian coast, and as a rule a depth of as much as 3 fathoms is not found within 4 miles of land. Climate.—The climate is described’ as salubrious and is not unhealthy. Hot dry winds from the north-west prevail in the summer, but in some years the temperature has ceased to be unpleasant as early as September. Population ^—An idea of the composition of the population may be obtained from the list of villages on the banks of the river Hindian; vide this Gazetteer. The principal inhabited places are Hindian town and Deh Mulla. The only village on the coast is Shah Abul Shah—for a description of which vide this Gazetteer. The fixed inhabitants number some 14,000 souls, and to these must be added a quota on account of nomad tribes, including Sharlfat, who wander in the district. The settled population includes both Arabs and Persians; some of the latter call themselves “ Koya. ” The following table gives the principal tribes of the district but few oi whom are common to the other districts of ’Arabistan :— Tribe.

By some accounts they are of Afghan origin. m Nidharat Buzi and Kut 1,000 Said to have immigrated from Central Arabia in the beginning of the seventeenth century. Qanawati Chehil Main, Daruhak, Gaz ’Ali Hind Ian town, Rusainabad Chasa * Kalgeh. Cham Khalaf Tsa, Cham Kharnab, 4,500 Now the principal tribe of the district. They are said to have immigrated 50 years ago from Behbehan to escape oppression. According to tra dition their original home was Deh Mulla and Zulmabad. in the neighbourhood of Kufa. Sharifat . Shirabad and Hindian town. 350 Vide this Gazetteer —Sharlait. About 600 nomad Shariat come to Kaleh-i-Mashraki 1 a in the harvest season. Shir ’Ali . . . j Upper Gargari 150 Came from Behbehan about 1899 in consequence of ill-treatment. It will be seen that the Qanawatis enjoy a great humercial predomin ance. Agriculture .—Cultivation is confined to the vicinity of the river. From Deh Mulla downwards it is all Daimi, that is, dependent on rainfall : above it is Fdridb or irrigated. There appears to be no impediment to the con-410 HIN—HIN struction of canals on the lower course of the river, apart from the poverty and indolence of the cultivating classes. The nature of the canals is noticed in the article on the Hindian river (q.v.). On the Lanjir canal rice is grown; elsewhere the chief cereals are wheat and barley, the quantity of wheat standing to that of barley in the proportion of 4 to 1. Other common crops are beans, sesame and linseed (kitan buzurg), musk- melons and water-melons. Owing to the uncertainty of the rainfall in recent years, cultivators in the Hindian district have adopted the practice of storing the grain of one season in large mud receptacles outside their houses, until the prospects of the next crop are assured. Each village possesses a due complement of donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats, besides a few mares, and in the wet tract at the head of the district there are some herds of buffaloes. The cattle of the district are humped. Grain is sold by weight. The unit of land measurement in the gdu or area that a pair of bullocks are supposed to plough in a day. Trade and Communications. —The only exports of value are grain and wool which have the district in considerable quantities. Horse-breeding is on the decline, and the stamp of animal produced is not saleable in the Bombay market. The imports consist of the ordinary necessities and simple luxuries which the district does not produce. There are no local manufactures. The Hindian village man is equal to about 240 and the Deh Mulla man to about 2471 lbs. English. The plains of the district present no obstacles to the movement of man or beast, except such as arise from their being slippery after rain, and are waterless at other times. The most frequented routes starting from Hindian village are :— 1. To Bandar Dllam by Shah Abul Shah. An adjacent route is from Chehil ManI to Shah Abul Shah, 24 miles ; the track first crosses good grazing land with numerous flocks of goats and sheep ; at about 14 miles it traverses a plain with sparse herbiage which is muddy in wet weather, and near Bandar Dllam it runs along some sand-dunes between mud-flats and the sea. 2. To Zaidan by Chehil ManI and the Karsch pass 9 farsakhs, about 31 miles. 3. To Zaidan the river bank 16 farsakhs, about 56 miles. 4. To Jaizan in the Ramuz district by Deh Mulla and Asiab 21 farsakhs, about 73 miles. There are also two routes from Hindian town to Behbehan town ; one by Zaidan, from which the route lies for 25 or 30 miles northwards towards Behbehan ; the other Gargarl to Cham Siah on the Marun river, and up that stream to Behbehan. A track to Bandar Ma’shur, moreover, leaves the right bank of the Hindian river at ’Abad Ilahl; and the right bank of this river is a highway through out the length of the district. There is a small boat-ferry about 4 miles below Deh Mulla. Supplies and Transport. —No statistics are to hand as to the amount of grain or other supplies procurable in this district. Grain, however, is grown in every village, and a list of the villages of the district will be found in this Gazetteer, vide Hindian river. Each village is separately described in this ■ \ 1 T *Gazetteer. The villages muster among them (1905) a total of some 200 horses, 4,700 donkeys, 1,000 camels, 30 mules, 4,800 cattle and 24,000 sheep. Administration .—The Hindian district is subject to the Shaikh of Muham- mareh, who has officials representing him at Hindian village and Deh Mulla. The tenure on which he holds it has not been precisely ascertained. The revenue is fluctuating, and is assessed at so many tumdns per gdii of actual cultivation. In 1905 the revenue of the Deh Mulla neighbourhood was farmed for 5,000 tumdns, and the revenue of the rest of the district for 18,000 tumdns ; this was an advance on former years and has not been realised without hardship and oppression. The Imperial Persian Customs have posts at Hindian town and at Tuwaisheh near the coast. In the 10th century the Hindian district contained the remains of a fire- temple and some water wheels of ancient construction. The local tradition that the Portuguese once held the district receives some support from the fact that the name “ Purgal ” is still recognized, and that there are traces of buildings and several old iron guns of the usual Portu guese type at Deh Mulla. Deh Mulla may perhaps have been a Portuguese factory, the river being then navigable above Hindian town as it was to some extent, as late as 1836.— (Bailward — Gabriel—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) HINDIAN (River) or ZAIDAN or AB ZUHREH— In flood in April 1910. Its several branches are very difficult to cross, for the current is very powerful and the water 4J feet to 5 feet high. The river breaks out into many streams when in flood. Bed hard. Water slightly brackish.— {Chicl, 1910.) This river is formed by the junction in the plain of Zaidan at a point 22 miles north by west from Bandar Dilam on the coast of two streams, the Khairabad or Ab-i-Shirin and the Shulistan or Ab Shur, both from the east ward. The more northern of the two streams, the Khairabad, is sweet : it is said to take its name from a ruined settlement upon its right bank a few miles above its junction, and to take its rise in a high range of mountains in the Kuhgalu Lur country. In its course the Khairabad gathers to itself the water of several streams, of which the chief are the Zuhreh and the Kumbal. The Shulistan, which has bitter waters, is stated to have its origin in a mass of hills to the west of the Kazarun-Shiraz road which were former ly inhabited by a tribe called Shfil, and have now been occupied for some centuries by the Mamassanis. The Shulistan, like the Khairabad river, has several tributaries, and one of these, the Shish Pir, which comes down from the north of Shiraz, is exceedingly bitter, strongly impregnating the Shulistan and even tainting the Hindian below the junction with the Khair abad, yet not in such degree as to make the water of the Hindian undrink able. Even at the driest season of the year the Khairabad and Shulistan are both considerable streams, with a breadth, at their junction, of 2 5 yards and having a shingly bottom. The upper course of the river formed by their union is generally known by the name of Zaidan not of Hindian, and may be taken as extending from Haidar Karar, a small Tmdmzddeh situated on the tongue of land between the Khairabad and the Shiilistan, to the border of the Hindian district, where412 HIN—HTN J it issues from the hills ; in other wards the length of this section is about 3d miles and its direction is from east-south-east to west-north-west. Here the Zaidan flows with a breadth of about 70 yards and a strong current of 3| miles an hour through the Zaidan plain, a valley, 5 miles wide, governed from Behbehan, and enclosed between a northern ani a southern range of hills ; the former has an elevation of about 1,500 feet, and the latter, which is the subsidiary maritime range forming the island boundary of the Liravl district, of about 1,000. The caravan route from Bandar Dilam to Beh behan crosses the river near Cham Zaidan, where there are two or three fords : the bottom there is shingly and good, but the strength of the current necessitates care in crossing with laden animals. The average depth here is from 3 to 4 feet, and the current runing at 3| to 4 miles an hour over a firm, shigly bottom. In February, however, Lieutenant-Colonel Bell found it hard to cross. He says : “At this season the river is both deep and rapid and it is necessary to pass up stream about 3 miles and to ford it to the south-west of the village Sardasht, where it flows in three channels; its right banks are low and pebbly ; its bed is covered with boulders ; its width is from 600 to 800 yards ; the deepest channel is about 3 feet 8 inches deep ; it must be forded with care ; its right bank is fringed by a belt of low bushes ; its left bank is elevated 20 to 30 feet above the stream. There are a few huts and a little cultivation close at hand on the left bank near the ford. ” The valley hereabouts is well cultivated, wheat being the staple product ; a considerable quantity of rice is also grown. Cham Zaidan is situated mile north of the right bank of the river. The villages and other notable places in the Zaidan plain are given in the article 5£ Zaidan, “ vide this Gazetteer. Cham Zaidan is at present (1905) the headquarters of the representative of the Shaikh of Muhammareh in this district. The total population of the valley is 3,000 souls, distributed in small hamlets containing from 50 to 200 inhabitants each, the chief being Zaidan, Sardasht, and Askari, the latter being situated close to the confluence of the two streams form ing the Hindian river, and some 6 miles east of Zaidan. Opposite Lunjlr which is on the left bank of the river some 14 miles below Cham Zaidan, the river throws off an artificial canal which, circling round to the west- north-west and then to the west-south-west, passes the villages of Cham Charata, Upper Gargari, Lower Gargari, and Asrab ; and reaches Suvaireh, there to be absorbed by numerous small distributaries, when on the point of rejoining the main stream. The Lower or Hindian course of the river begins between the village of Ghuleh and the Hindian village of Shirabad. It is doubtful whether Ghuleh belongs to Hindian or Behbehan. The stream now, turning the north end of Funnel Hill, emerges on the open plains of the Hindian district. From Shirabad it runs first for 5 miles west-north-west to Suvaireh ; it then turns, and its average direction from Suvaireh to Hindian village, a distance of 22 miles in a straight line, is due southwards. Passing Kut and Deh Mulla 4 miles below which are a village and a small boat-ferry, the river con tinues southwards until Hindian town, which stands on both banks of the river, is reached. At Hindian town the river is unfordablc, the breadthHlN—IIIN €3^ 413 in February being about 8 yards. It can, though, be forded 9 miles above the town. From here its course becomes winding and. after all but reaching the sea at a place 10 miles south-south-west of Hindian village, it meanders due westwards for another 9 miles, keeping within 2 or 3 miles of the coast the whole way, and eventually attains the Persian Gull at a point 16 miles south-west-west of Hindian village as the crow flies, but double that distance from it by water. At its embouchure the Hindian cuts its way through mud flats, and its mouth is difficult to discover from seawards owing to the flatness of the coast. The entrance has not been examined since 1836, when a bar of soft clay was in process of formation which it was feared might impede navigation ; but it is still navigable for native sea-going craft up to Hindian village, but not farther. In 1836 vessels of 20 and 30 tons burden used to ascend as far as Kut, though even at the time few boats proceeded above Hindian town. Boats can, and still do, ascend to the latter place. The navigation of the river was examined by Lieutenant Whitelocke of the Indian Navy in 1836, who, inter alia, reported as follows :— “ The entrance to this river is in latitude 30° 4' 30' north. It is difficult to find, as there are no landmarks to guide you ; you must be acquainted with the soundings to find the entrance. From Bushire boats steer in a west- north-westerly direction carrying 5 or 6 fathoms from Ras Shut. Keeping in this depth of water, you will be about 5 or 6 miles from the coast. Off the Khur of Bahrakan, you will lessen your water to 2f and 2 fathoms ; you steer then about south-south-west, and south, altering it as your depth of water will guide you. “ In this Khur you have from 2 fathoms to 1|, If- and 1 fathom high water. This Khur leads into the Khur of Hindian. The Khur of Hindian extends about here If or 2 miles from the river ; you will be steering, when you enter this Khur, east and east-north-east carrying from 1 to If fathoms. The hill called Kalat, the nearest range, bears about north-east by north. “ The distant hills behind Kalat, which are higher, and are called Zattam, bear from north f east to east by north. “ The banks of the river at the entrance are covered with bulrushes for about 2 or 3 miles ; no other vegetation. “ At a place called Nakhal Bagush, there are one or two date-groves. Two miles from this is another date-grove, but none afterwards until you reach Hindian town, nor any signs of vegetation with the exception of a few tamarisk trees. “ From the entrance you have 2J and 3 fathoms low water as far as Gaz ’Ali in September. “ The banks for some miles are low and covered with a layer of salt, but gradually rise in height, from a village called Annonat to the town of Kut. “ The rise and fall, as far as Gaz’Ali, is 10 or 11 feet spring tides; water is sweet and very clear ; the bottom hard mud. “ This river is about 200 feet wide at the entrance ; at Gaz ’Ali not so wide, but at Hindian town only 180 feet, at Deh Mulla 150 feet, and at Kut not more than 100 feet. “ In April, May, June and July, when the water comes from the hills, it overflows the bank, 15 feet high.“ There are plenty of fish in the river, one kind in particular of about a foot in length, which sticks to the bottom of the boats, and causes them to leak. Unless you are very careful in examining them well and often, it is probable that all your cargo and goods will be spoiled, in one night. I had several things spoiled during a night, and found early in the morning the boat half full of water. “ The boats that come up the river are from 20 to 30 tons. But they cannot go farther than Kut, as the water is low and there are several banks reaching across the river. ” The average width of the river from Deh Mulla to its mouth is from 50 to 70 yards ; but at Kut it is said to be less than 35 ; the height of its banks diminishes from 25 feet at Kut to 20 at Deh Mulla, 14 at Hindian town, and 8 Ga ’All. Above Suvaireh the Hindian is broken up into more than one channel, but from Suvaireh downwards it flows in a single bed, having high bank and a nearly constant width of about 60 yards. The bottom from the beginning of the district till 6 miles below Suvaireh is shingly, and thence to the sea it is of hard mud. The water of the Hindian is drinkable, as already observed, though impregnated with a salt or alkali brought down by the Shulistan, which gives it a better taste but does not prevent the lathering of soap. It has, however, been reported as sweet and clear in September. In winter the river flows with a strong current throughout its course. The country on both sides of the river consists of featureless plains which the stream, except near the north end of the district, has not been utilised to irrigate. Here and there are patches of musk and water-melons in the actual bed, but the banks bear nothing except an occasional tamarisk until a fine grove of all date-trees, called Nakhl Bagush, belonging to Tuwaisheh, is reached near the river mouth. The banks for the last 2 or 3 miles before reaching the sea are covered with bulrushes. From Gargar to 6 miles below Suvaireh there is irrigation by means of jubs, or water-cuts, taking off from various natural branches of the river. The following is a list of the villages on or near the river in the Hindian district where supplies and livestock are procurable. Each is described separately under its own name in this Gazetteer. The villages are given in the order in which they occur descending the river Hindian from Gargar downwards :— 1. Shirabad. 2. Kaleh Mashraqi. 3. Gargari Bala. 4. Gargar Pain. 5. Asiab. 6.

(Whitelocke — Bell — Gabriel—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)HIN—HIR 415 HINDIAN (Town)—Lat. 30° 14' 24' ; Long. 49° 43' 5' ; Elev. A town in Southern ’Arabistan on both banks of the Hindian river, at a point 16 miles north-west of its mouth. The town is mostly in ruins, and the population, which was formerly greater, had declined in 1863 to about 500, and now numbers 500. Baghlahs come here from Bushire, Bahrain, Lingeh, and Kuwait, and grain, live sheep and wool are exported : also oak bark, sesame and ghl. Hindian is one of two depots (the other being Dilam) for the Behbehan line of trade. Formerly that part of the town only which is on the right bank of the river belonged to the Shaikh of the Ka’b Arabs, whilst that on the left bank was under the governor of Behbehan ; but now the town is, like the rest of the district, under the Shaikh of Muhammareh, and is controlled by his representative. The inhabitants consist of Qanawatls, Sharifat, Haiad, and Ka’b Arabs of the Sha’abanI section (here called Shdbrunls), the last predominating. The people are cultivators of grain, boatmen and traders, and possess some 20 horses, 800 cattle and donkeys and 1,000 sheep and goats. A political agent on the part of the Shaikh of Muhammareh has his residence here ; and the town also contains a post of the Persian Imperial Customs, which is reported to produce 18,000 tumdns a year. There is no telegraph, but communication is maintained with Behbehan and Bushire by the Persian Post Office. Ophthalmia is the prevailing disease. Bell says the water of the river is scarcely drinkable in February, being tainted in passing through the low hills south of Zaidan. In September it is reported sweet and clear.

It now contains only some 200 inhabitants, but round the village lie the extensive stone ruins of what must once have been a town holding 3,000 or 4,000 people. A round mud tower on a hillock overlooking the village commands both it and the fort, a small, square mud building. There are two small caravan serais, but they are so dilapidated as to be almost in ruins. Water is plentiful from wells, 6 db-ambdrs, and from a spring flowing 3 feet in 11 seconds and of section 4 inches by 18. This latter is situated in a clump of date palms to the east of the town. A mountain path leads up the gorge in rear of the village over the hills to Anwi, which by this road is only 2| farsakhs distant. The village possesses 100 cows, 1,000 sheep and goats, and 60 donkeys, and the valley to the west is said to produce 100,000 kharivdrs of wheat and barley annually.— (Vaughan, April 1890.)HUM-HUL 417 HUMEH —Lat.

To my mind the former seems to be the more likely, as no Persian would build a wall where a few stones would be equally effective.”— (Schindler .—■ Report of a Journey through the Bakhtidri Country to Shushtar.) HUSAINABAD (District)— A district of ’Arabistan. It was acquired by the late Nizam-us-Sultaneh by grant from Government about 1898.

Mats— The name given in Persia to designate those tribes who lead a wander ing life, and who subsist by their flocks.ili—IlI 425 “ The Iliats are not originally Persians, but may be compared to foreign shoots grafted on the main stalk. The original Persian is to be found In the cities and in the old established towns and districts of the provinces. The accretion of new population flowed in both from the east and from the west. Until th3 conquest of Persia by the Saracens, her people might be said to be unmixed ; they, having conquered the country, spread themselves even to Balkh, Bukhara, and Marv, were incorporated with the Persian nation, and, it is said, first innoculated it with roving propensities. The next tribe of wanderers was brought from the east in 1234 with Jangiz Khan, which was followed by Timur, who crossed and re-crossed Persia so fre quently that many of his hordes were left in Turkey. Such, in general terms, may be called the origin of the Iliats, but each tribe has its own particular history, recording whence it came and by whom it was introduced into Persia. Many have become inhabitants of cities and villages ; there fore the tribes are classed into what are called Shahr Nishin, or dwellers in cities, or Sahrd Nishin, or dwellers in the field. A few only have adhered to their original modes of life, and abide all the year round in tents, in the winter keeping to the plains, and in the summer seeking the pasturage of the mountains. In their own estimation they look upon the Shahr Nishlns as degenerate, applauding the hardihood and simplicity of manners of those who have no other dwelling place than the tent, and reviling those who recur to the luxuries of a house and the protection of a city. “ The principal tribes are as follows : 1, KajAr ; 2, Afshar ; 3, ’Arab ; 4, Lak ; 5, Fail!; 6, Bavat; 7, Kurd ; 8, Ku d Bachah ; 9, Aimak ; 10,’ Hazareh ; 11, Baluch ; 12, Bajilan ; 13, Khuda Bandehlu ; 14, Bakhtiari; 15, Shakhagi; 16, Shah-Sivan ; 17, Mamassani. It does not appear that any of the tribes have written records, and it must be confessed that the information here acquired concerning their numbers must be held as very uncertain. The traditions of the tribes are oral, and whenever they pretend to great anti quity, they immediately ascend to the fabulous ages of their historians, where all is darkness, and they do not possess any popular ballads, which can throw light upon their history. Each tribe has a patois of its own, bearing more or less affinity to the Persian, but whatever books they possess are in the Persian language. “ The different tribes are now so much spread throughout the provinces that they have almost lost that union which could render them formidable. It is evidently the policy of the Government to disperse them, and it does so, keeping their chiefs as hostages about the person of the king. Great efforts have been made to disperse the Arab tribes, but ineffectually ; consequentlv their chiefs are feared, and precautions taken to secure proper hostages for their good behaviour. . “ Such of the tribes as have become inhabitants of cities are subject to the laws and regulations which rule the community they have adopted : generally speaking, they are employed as servants, attached to their Khans, either in a military or domestic capacity. “ The Sahrd Nishins, although taxed in various ways and made to contri bute to the military exigencies of the state, are comparatively less molested than the other inhabitants. Their wealth consists principallv in cattle, which yield them a considerable revenue, and which they prefer to thatproduced by the cultivation of the soil. They breed camels and horses for sale, and their sheep yield milk, which is made into rughan (liquid butter), and sold throughout the country. The peculiar privileges of the Illats consist in liberty to range over districts from which no one can dispossess them. They ascend in the summer to cold regions called ydlldqs, where they find pasture, and in the winter keep to their qishldq tracts, which enjoy a warmer climate. These ydlldqs and qishldqs are defined to each tribe by the Government, and whenever their limits are encroached upon by unprivileged tribes, violent strifes and battles ensue. “ The existence of these migratory tribes being advantageous to the Gov ernment, they are little oppressed. They are taxed at certain established rates upon each head of cattle, and are called upon to serve in the king’s armies. They pay at the rate of five piastres for each camel, one piastre for each cow, the same for mares, one ’abbdsl, or quarter-piastre, for a sheep. When they cultivate the ground, they are fined according to the rates exacted from the other ralyats. Should they not be cultivators, each ten khdnehs (houses) provide one horseman, mounted and armed ; and each five one footman, or tufangcld. These receive forage from the Shah. The horse man’s pay is about eight iumdns annually, for which he serves six months in the field ; the other six he remains at home. He is paid twice in the year, half and half in advance, and during the time he is in actual service receives a daily allowance of one man of barley for his horse, and straw in proportion. The horsemen are obliged to attend the muster and the review, which the king makes after the Nauruz, of all his troops, properly mounted and equipped, or they are severly punished. The tufangohi, or foot soldier, gets 7 tiimdns per annum, and half the year remains at home. The wages are paid into the hands of the Khan of the tribe, who then delivers over the money to the subaltern officers, called Sultans and Bimldshis, who pay the soldiers. This promotes peculation ; the Khan subtracting his share, the Mlrzd or scribe his, and the subalterns theirs, while the poor soldier deems himself very lucky if he gets one-half of that which is his due. Agha Muham mad Shah, the eunuch king, used to pay the troops with his own hand. The great advantage of being military servants is protection to their families, the Governors of villages and other men in office not daring to molest them under such circumstances. “ The Iliats are not compelled to bestow their labour upon public works like the other ra’iyat ; they keep exclusively to their tents and tend their cattle. The taxes they pay are levied by their chiefs, who account with the government. Those who are inclined to elude taxation frequently do so by hiding their cattle in the mountains. “ In their different small .communities, they are governed by Risk Sajlds (literally “ white beards ”) or elders, who have no other emblem of power or superiority to show than a white beard. Old age is extremely respected by them and generally by all Persians, and is indulged with great liberties. A Risk Safld, a poor, miserable old man, will not fail, whenever his tribe is oppressed, to make a journey purposely to remonstrate with the governor of the province, and abuse him to his face ; and so careful are the Governors not to offend these influential persons that they bear their re proof with moderation, and are fain to be civil. Their disputes areIlI—IL l 427 decided by their Risk Safids ; even the ordinances of their hakims, or governors, are referred to them. In all cases of marriage the elder is first consulted and his consent procured as a preliminary. The tribe seldom intermarry. The elders recommend families whose daughters may be selected for wives ; but whenever one refuses to give their daughters in marriage to another, it is esteemed an affront and a motive for strife. “ The Persian Government is ever jealous of the migration of these tribes, and they cannot remove from one province to another without first having obtained the Shah’s pei mission. In times of trouble, such as the death of the king, frequently, if they be strong enough to encounter opposition, they pass from their old haunts to better places. “We have said before that the possessions of the Iliats consist of cattle. These are camels, horses, mares, cows, oxen, mules, asses, sheep, and goats, besides a fine race of dogs. Their pastures, although open to the Shah, the princes, and the other great men of the country, may also be said to be their property, inasmuch as they have liberty to range over them unless there has been issued a quruq, or prohibition. “ From the pastures which are appropriated to the use of the Shah and the princes, such as Sultanleh, Ujan, etc., they are totally excluded, unless they receive permission, for which they pay a certain quantity of the produce of their flocks. For instance, in 1815 the Shah did not go to Sultameh, and he allowed the Iliats to feed their cattle there, provided they furnished him with 1,000 mans of raughan or preserved butter. “ Their property, if it may be so called, consists of tents, carpets bedding, cooking utensils, large cauldrons in which they boil the raughan, or pre served butter, skins to shake the butter and sour milk in, and all the rude furniture of shepherds. Much of their furnitiure consists of camel pack saddles, ornamented bridles form the chief camel, besides other ornaments in beads, etc. Among the Kurdish tribes the women ride in kajawahs, which are cage-like penniers placed on each side of the camel, each large enough to contain a woman. Then there are saddles for horses and paldns for mules, and a sort of padded cushion for the back of their tents. “ An lliat of middling fortune possesses about a hundred sheep, three of four camels, three or four mares, ten asses, etc., which may yield'him a revenue of 40 to 50 tumdns. A man who possesses a thousand sheep, thirty camels, twenty mares, etc., is reckoned a rich man. Each sheep may be valued at 2 piastres, a camel at 10, a mare at 8, and an ass at 3. Such a property would yield a revenue of 400 tumdns. This is derived from the wool and milk of sheep, the w T ool and hire of the camels, the colts from the mares and asses ; the female camel brings forth once every two years, the mare every year, and the sheep once a year. In some parts of Persia, particularly among the Kurds, who enjoy the finest jrjasturage, the ewes produce twice a year. There are a few rich Persians, whose pos sessions and modes of life assimilate to those of the patriarchs of old. Such was I’sa-Khan of Turbat, who was calculated to possess 160,000 sheep, 20,000 camels, 6,000 mares and other cattle in proportion. Ahmad Khan of Maragheh was also an immensely rich farmer. The Vali of Siheneh and several others might also be classed among those leading patriarchal lives. , . i i .428 iLl-ILl “ The patrimony of an Iliat is divided among his children, according to the Mussalman law : two-thirds to the sons, and one-third to the daughters, the latter taking the clothes and valuables belonging to the mother. “ The value of an Iliat tent is about 6 to 7 tumdns. It is made of goats’ hair, consisting of cloths about a foot and a quarter in width, woven by the women. All the members of the family—men, women, and children— are usually employed spinning goats’ hair, which is either in actual use in the loom or laid by for sale. “ They weave the cloth in a portable loom, which they fix in the rudest manner possible, but which answers all the purposes for which it is in tended. This cloth is of strong tecture, impervious to rain, and will last 20 years. The covering of one of the tents is generally about 40 feet in length and 20 in breadth, and is erected upon a range of poles, the back and sides being fitted up with reeds, made into walls, and is fastened to the ground with pegs. The tents are extremely rude, and do not show any appearance of attention to comfort. In Azarbaijan, and the more northern and consequently rainy countries, they have another sort of tent which has been borrowed from the Turkomans. This consists of ribs united, and, when open, is like a cage on which thick felts are thrown, and it is entered by a narrow door ; it is called aldchuq ; the goats’ hair tents are called ‘ kara chddar, ’ or black tents. “ The encampments of the Iliats are generally of about twenty to thirty tents together, which they pitch mostly without any great attention to regularity. They are also to be seen in a circle, as well as in line, and appear conspicuous on a light soil owing to their black colour ; on a dark soil they are scarcely perceptible, particularly under the shadow of a moun tain. The tents are close to each other, but the different encampments may be a mile or two asunder, according to the convenience of grass and water. “ The Iliats feed principally on the produce of their flocks, and eat sour milk, cheese, dough or buttermilk, and much raughan or preserved butter. Their annual expenses are much less than those of the inhabitants of cities ; for, excepting their clothes, copper utensils, pack-saddles, and ornamental luxuries, they supply all their own necessities. Their simple manner of living (not to mention their being out of the way of extortion) may be cal culated at one hundred per cent, cheaper than in the town. They make their own tents or dwelling-places, weave their own carpets and hammocks or felts, cut their own wood and burn their own charcoal; they kill their own meat, make their cheese and butter, and their lives are far more free from disease and local complaints. Their dress does not differ from that of other Persians, except in its extreme meanness. A man rich in cattle will appear with a coat to his back that scarcely holds together, and in such indifferent dresses, but with no other covering over their heads than their tents, their women and children will brave all the rigour of winter. The favourite wife or child enjoys whatever luxury of dress belongs to the tribe, consisting of gold bracelets, necklaces, silver and gold ornaments for the hair ; frequently a handkerchief is edged with perforated silver coins, and bandeaus of the same are tied about the head and neck. It is not uncom mon to meet with ancient medals suspended about the neck and heads of the Iliat women and children.“ The time of the Iliat’s rest is the winter, when his flocks are not produc tive and require no other care than being led to pasture. The men then help the women to weave carpets and tent cloths, or spin goats’ hair. At the approach of spring all is then full of activity : the ewes bring forth, then the lambs are tented, then shearing comes on, the flocks require constant milk ing, and the numerous uses to which the milk is consigned that is butter, dough, and rauqhan, require much work, which the men perform. The women, too, are very laborious; they pitch and unpitch encampments when on a march, load and unload the beasts of burden, attend the children and the young animals ; they sit down in companies to spin and help to churn and make sour milk. The drudgery is for the women ; the business of pro tection, purchase, and sale, and all the greater interests of the community for the males. “ The Illats break up their winter encampments one month after the festival of the Nauruz — i.e., one month after the sun has entered the sign Aries—and travel by easy journeys of 2 to 3 miles each day to what they call the Sarhad, or the boundary between the cold and hot region ; there they stay for about a month, and then travel on again to their Ydildq, where they encamp during the heat of summer and where they remain about seventy days ; they then return to the Sarhad, where they remain another month, and at length reach their old haunts in the qishldq for the winter. Many direct their motions by the rising of the stars, and many by the appearence of the snowy mountains. They are unmolested in their passage, and perhaps may give a sheep or so to the lords of the villages near which they travel. The ground upon which they encamp is improved by their presence since it is strengthened by the manure they leave. “ Their mode of calculating property is by sheep ; they pay their shepherds in sheep. In their own dealings, in their purchase of oxen, etc., they pay in sheep. A man killing one of their dogs is liable to be fined 4 sheep. Among the villages, too, in their smaller dealings, the Persian rd’iyat deals with his neighbour, not in money, but in kind—corn, wool, straw, etc. Three months after the Nauruz, they separate the rams from the ewes and feed them till they are mast. At the beginning of the sign Mizdn, or Libra, they turn them into the flock, by which the ewes bear at about the Nauruz, and some of the Illats celebrate this event by music, songs, and merry-mak ing. Shearing takes place twice in the year ; the first time after the Nauruz. about the 20th of May ; and the second at the Mizdn. They give of their wool and other produce of their flocks, which is called by the general name of kashf,-to the poor in alms. At the time of the new lambs they take por tions of their milk, which they make into curds, cream, qaimdk and fresh cheese, and send it to their friends as a complimentary gift, marking the return of the season. A shepherd has the care of three hundred sheep, and is paid in kind, both in wool and lambs. “ From what has been said, it is evident that the Iliats, as raw material for the formation of troops, must be of considerable consequence to the state of which they are the subjects. They are soldiers by nature, as far as the mere habit of the man goes, but, it must be added, they are difficult of dis cipline, owing to their clan-like propensities. Those on the frontier frequent ly give rise to feuds and war. One of the principal objects of the war carriedILI—ILI 431 The following is a concise and more recent account of the I Hats by Bell, 1884 :— The llldts of South-West Persia. The peoples inhabiting the south-west of Persia are chiefly Iliat, or nomads, of foreign origin, the residue of the overflowings from both the west and east of the Saracen conquerors and of the followers of Jangiz Khan and Timur. They constitute, perhaps, rather more than one-fourth of the inhabitants of Persia, and are now both ShaJir and Deh-Nishins (settlers in towns and villages) and Sahrd-Nishins or lliats (nomads) ; the former are despised by the latter and considered by them to be degenerate, and hillers-off from the simplicity and hardihood of nomad life, and recurrers to city protection. This sentiment is but one of envy ; the life of the Deh- Nishms-wovdd attract all did not the counterbalancing fear of exactions and increased taxation serve to force them to a mode of life less under government control. A foreign race, they are prone to rebellion, and if assisted from abroad would not submit to Persia. The Sahrd-N ishins are taxed, kept dispersed, and their chiefs kept a * hostages at T ib r an ; they are made to contribute to the military power of the State, but are less molested than the Shahr-Nishins ; the limits of their pastures are defined by government. Their flocks are taxed ; and if they cultivate the soil they are taxed as cultivators. A moderate fortune for an Iliat consists in the possession of 100 sheep, 3 or 4 mares, 10 asses, yielding a revenue of from 40 or 50 tumdns. A rich Khan will possess ten times the above. They possess a fine race of dogs ; sheep constitute their chief wealth. They are good raw material for troops, but difficult to discipline. llidt. —The Persian irregular cavalry is chiefly recruited from the lliats. Individually they are excellent horsemen, expert in the use of carbine, sword, and lance, but they cannot act in unison. Their officers are no better trained in tactical knowledge than the rank and file, and the troops, being commanded by their own local chief, family jealousies prevent a unity of feeling and aim. The cavalry horses (when a force of lliats is embodied) are sent out under a small guard to graze whenever possible ; in quarters their food consists of chopped straw and barley ; an average daily ration is 7 lbs. of barley and from 14 to 20 lbs. of chopped straw. This is also the ration given by the chdrvdddrs to their mules on the line ot march. llidt infantry. —Although the lliats furnish to Persia the greater part of her cavalry, an arm on which she almost wholly relied in past times, yet their infantry has often been called into the field ; the Bakhtlarl infantry was renowned as the best in the kingdom. Numbers, power, occupations, etc. —The lliats scattered over Persia have been estimated to number 2,700,000. They are brought up in ignorance of everything except tending their flocks, weaving, and martial exercises. They are taught to despise peaceful occupations. The Shah can call upon them to furnish for service one horseman and two foot soldiers for every ten families, or about 130,000 men if a universal levy were made. Ft. I. 2 iILI—ILI 4S2 The advantage of military service consists in the protection which it affords to the soldier’s family ; of the pay they see little, as it passes through the hands of the Khan, the Sultan, the Mirza, etc., of the regiment to which the soldier belongs, and each appropriates a share. They are inured to danger and fatigue, and tenacious of the honour of their tribes; hitherto, they have been the prop and glory of Persia. They were ubiquitous, and, hovering round about an enemy, never allowed him to rest. Jealousy of their power now causes them to be less drawn upon than formerly for recruits ; many of their number are kept at Tihran as hostages for their loyal behaviour. At best such troops are but lawless and savage marauders and dangerous to a weak government. The cavalry are more highly esteemed than the infantry simply because every man thinks it degrading to walk and dignified to ride ; every Persian is a good horseman, being accustomed to bestride some animal, donkey, mule, or horse from early childhood. Until good legislation shall turn them into peaceable and industrious communities the fertile regious over which they wander must be vast pasturages, adapted solely to armed shepherds and lawless freebooters. Persian 'policy towards the llidts. —It has at times been the policy of the Persian Government to split up unruly and dangerous tribes, and to transport them to distant parts of the empire ; thus, the inhabitants of Diz-i-Kurd, Deh-i-Kurd, etc., are of Kurdish origin. Mr. Schindler considers that the proportion of souls per family among the nomads is smaller than that of residents in towns and villages. Of the Mussulman population 50*5 per cent are females and 49*5 per cent males. The Lurs of Lur-i-Kuchak are under the jurisdiction of the Governor, resident at Khurramabad. 1 The Lurs of Lur-i-Buzurg are under that of the Governor of ’Arabistan, resident at Burujird, and of that of Isfahan. The Kuhgalti and Mamassani are under the government of Behbehan (Shiraz). The Qashqai are under that of Ears (Shiraz). llidts of Pars, etc. —The most complete account of the Mamassani and Kuhgalu Lurs and of the Qashqai, as well as of the other dwellers in Ears, will be found in the works of Dr. Andreas. All these tribes were reduced to order by Prince Farhad Mirza by a ruthless shedding of blood (since 1877). Border llidts. —The Iliat tribes along the border of Turkey and Persia have ever been noted for their predatory habits; the Turk being regarded by the Persian as an intruder on the limits of the ancient Persian empire ; the former, the orthodox believer in ’Omar and the omnipotent Allah ; the latter the disciple of the martyred ’Ali—the one a Sunni, the other a Shi’ah. The Faili Lurs occupy the Persian border from Dizful to Kirmanshah. It is difficult to treat with the border Iliats diplomatically, they occupying Turkish territory at one time and Persian at another.^— (Bell.)and now all that remains of them are a few robbers, who wander about plundering every one that come in their way. (5) Inanlu, brought over from Turkestan by Chingiz Khan. They used to spent the summer in the buluks of Ramjird and Marv- dasht, and the winter in those of Khafr, Darab, andFasa. They plundered on the high road of Fa s, Kirman, and Yazd until 1877, when the tribe was severly punished by Nesred Din Shah. After this the Inanlu became a sedentary tribe inhabiting the plain of Fasa. They number 5,000 families and are sub divided into the following tirehs :—Abul Verdi (they were the chiefs of the whole tribes of Khamseh), Islamlu, Afshar-Uchagi, Amir-Haji, Iranshahi, Bulaqi, Bayat, Chahardeh-Charik, Chian, Daubaglu, Dahu, Dindarlu, Rais-Beglu, Zarind Quli, Zangineh, Suruglu, Sakkareh, Qurtbaglu, Qurt, Qaragara, Chaglu, Kurrai, Kurkbar, Mahmudbeglu, Yaqirmarlu. , They were formely under the Ilkhani of the Qashquis but are now attached to the Qavam family. Military qualifications .—The Khamseh, united probably 'or the first time in history when they came to the assistance of the Qavamis against Saulat-ud-Dauleh, certainty raised quite 3,000 well-armed men, who showed greater spirit and determination than the Qashqai, upon whom they inflicted heavy losses and a severe defeat. Under the most favourable circum stances they might put 4,000 men into the field, but not more. The tribesmen are not fully under the control of the r own chiefs, and would seldom fail to be a source of acute anxiety to the commander of any army to whose assistance they saw fit to come. The tribes, as a whole, are probably as well armed as the Qashqais, but seem to possess a greater variety of rifles, in contrast to the latter, whose rifles are for the most part Mausers. The tribe has hitherto, however, never been sufficiently united to be ab'e to undertake any concerted action, whether against the Persian Government or a rival tribe ; and to this fact, in a large measure, must be ascribed the recent increase of Qashqai influence in Fars.— (Rabino, culled from Demorgny’s “ Reforms Adminis- tratives en Perse, 1913,” and Wilson, 1916).

Jahjah is the Bakhtiari pronunciation of Gahgah ; it gives its name to theGahgahl, or Jahjahi tribe.— {Preece — Schindler.) JAHRUM, or JEHRUM District— A district of Fars. Its extent measures 30 miles by 15 miles, and it contains 18 villages of which Jehrum town is the principal one. All the' villages about are enclosed in mud walls, with small turrests, as disputes regarding boundaries, water, etc., are always arising between villages and generally result infighting.— {Abbott — Stotherd, 1893.) JAHRUM— Lat. 28° 30' N. ; Long. 53° 27'; Elev. 3,200'. A town and district, 90 miles South-east of Shiraz, situated in an extensive plain of the same name under the North slope of Kuh-i-Alburd of the walls of the town practically nothing now remains ; access can only be obtained by the gates of the town, of which there are about 6, connec ted with each other by thin garden walls or the backs of houses. Many of the houses possess turrets, which are used for the faction fights prevalent in the town. The number oF houses is a bout 2,000 ; the town is com pletely surrounded by date-plantations, which make it appear larger than it really is. There is only one large sarai, at the South-west of the town ; it would hold \ a squadron. The population of the town was estimated in 1893 at 10,000 ; by Lt. Wilson in 1911 at 5,000, exclusive of the district, 2,500. The principal produce of the district is tobacco, which goes principally to Shiraz. The land round Jahrum is for the most part irrigated with water drawn &lt; -by bullock from wells ; the plain is everywhere dotted with these wel’s, many of which are brackish. There is good running water 2 miles East of the town, supplying large gardens. There is a post weekly to Shiraz, and occasionally to Lar. Fruit is ex tensively grown for local consumption ; raisins are exported and some times dates. Malikis (Persian cloth shoes) are largely manufactured and sent for sale to Shiraz. Few mules or ponies are available, but plenty of446 JAH—JAI donkeys. The people are as unpleasant and unmannerly as are to be found is any town of 8.-W. Persia. There is no Persian garrison ; the town is managed by one or more kaldntars, who are responsible for the revenue ; a deputy governor seldom makes his appearance and is never, even when present, in a position to enforce his authority. Some 15 miles to the E. of the town in the Baharlu fort of Kalat-i-Tawar, a hill fort, formerly garri soned by 100 Persian soldiers, but now in the hands of the Baharlu (Wilson, 1911.) Water. There is good camping-ground for a force of any size. The water here requires careful selection, for, though there is a fair supply of good water, there are several wells in which the quality of the water is very bad. The excellent water-supply which is found on the road from Firuzabad seems to suddenly stop short from Dagh, the last stage before Jehrum onwards. Iransport. For transport there are numbers of donkeys available here, but very few mules. Stotherd saw a few ponies of the right class em ployed in caravan work.

It normally consists of 125 houses, ch'efly of Kuhgalu Lurs r of the Agha Jan, Bahmai, and Buvair Ahmadi sections, but also partly of Arabs. At present the village is reduced to a third of its usual dimen sions, having been plundered by Kuhgalu Lurs at the instigation of the Shaikh of Muhammareh during a spilt in 1906 between two factions of the Bakhtiari Khans. Some of the houses are of mud ; the rest are grass huts. The lands of the village are irrigated. It is the property of the Shahab-us-Saltaneh and the Muin Humaiun.

The Karun is here a stream of 100 yards’ wddth between cliff banks 200 yards apart. It has a shelving shingle-bed. The village contains 200 houses of Haft Lang Bakhtiarl, who possess about 100 yifles. It is owned by the Bakhtlari Khans, who seized it 20 years ago from a Kalantar of Shushtar. There is a small mud fort and some date-trees. Water is obtained from the river. There is no irrigation. There is dry cutivation of wheat and barley. Livestock comprises horses, mules, donkeys, cattle and sheep. The annual Persian revenue assessment of Jallakan is 280 tumdns. — [Burton, 1903 ; Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) JAM— Lat. 27° 49' 37'; Long. 52° 24' 10' ; Elev. 2,689'. A town of Fars on the road from Bushire to Lar and 144| miles from the former place. It is situated about 3 miles from the south-east end of a grassy, fertile, and well-cultivated valley, dotted with frequent kundr trees, runniirg south-east and north-west, length about 12, and breadth 8, miles. The portion tq the north-west of Jam is plateau, elevated from 100 to 200 feet above the rest of the valley. On the south-west side is the rocky range of Kuchur, containing Kuh-i-Puzeh Padri; and on the north-east, near the foot of a rugged range of hills, flows the river Riz, or, as it is here called, Jam, in a few threads of water meandering over a very broad bed covered with small, white pebbles. The north-west end of the valley is bounded by low hills, and that to the south-east by a series of rugged ranges. The population is about 1,500. The majority of the houses is of stone and mud ; there are also numerous mat huts. The streets in many cases are too narrow for the passage of loaded mules. Dates, barley, wheat, and tobacco are plentiful. Butcher observed little fruit, but, to judge from the soil, the abundance of good water, and the climate, there seems every reason to suppose that most kinds of fruit andJAM—JAM 449 vegetables would flourish here. Mutton and beef are procurable in moder ate quantities ; and the supply might, by breeding and importation, be increased ad libitum. Good and plentiful water is obtainable and the kunar bushes furnish a considerable supply of fuel. There is very good grazing and cultivation here. The transport appears to be very limited, hour or five horses were noticed, but no mules, donkeys, or bullocks. The headman of Jam said that, every harvest, he could send to the port of Tahiri 50,000 Hashimi mGms=65,000 Indian maunds (one Hashim man—IQ Bushire or Tabriz mans). The ground about Jam consists of limestone strata, with gravelly sod superimposed. Underneath the limestone, at a depth of 12 feet, fresh water runs in subterraneous streams. This water is filled with innumerable very minute fish. . The road from Bushire (near Bushire) to Jam is fairly good, and presents no difficulties for pack animals. The seaport for Jam is Tahiri; general direction south by east, J east, distant 17 statute miles over hilly ground. The road to this port leads, by the south-west corner of the valley, between Kuh-Puzeh Badri and the hills closing the south-east end of the valley. As seen from the summit of Puzeh Padri, a water course, called Ghaba, flows on its south-west side, and thence south-east by south to the sea, which is plainly visible, between low, hills progressively decreasing in height. In this quarter the ml s are very low, and Butcher understands that by this opening proceeds the road to Tahiri. It has been from the earliest times, and, although at presen traversed only by pack animals, might, he believes, be readily adapted to wheel traffic. _ . , Jam can, if required, be easily and economically put m telegraph com munication with all the stations of the Persian Gulf section 0 e ^ European Telegraph Department. This might be effected by tapping which ever of the two gulf cables lies nearest to the coast by a branc ca e ea ing into Tahiri and thence by land-line to Jam. The nearest mam cable lies at a distance from Tahiri of 32 statute miles, and the atter por is, as mentioned above, 17 statute miles from Jam. Such lengths of cable and land-line are insignificant, and would entail but little extra expense. With a telegraph station thus joined up at Jam the country on ei ei side, towrads Bushire on the west and Bandar Abbas on t e eas , be speedily opened out. and the way would be thus paved or a an me from Bushire to Bandar ’Abbas and thence to Jashk. If this latter line were constructed the Indian Telegraph system would be connected through to Constantinople, and the European system by a continuous land-line through Makran, Southern Persia, and Turkey in Asia. The maximum temperature noted here in March was 7 an e minimum 38°.— [Butcher, 1893.) JAMALABAD (1)— Lat. 29° 51' N. ; Long. 53° 15' E. ; Elev.

JARRAHl (District)— A district in Southern ’Arabistan, lying upon both sides of the Jarrahi river in the upper two-thirds of its course. Boundaries. —The north-easternmost corner of the district is at the tomb of Shah Nabi, at the foot of some hills to the east of the river Jarrahi; thence the boundary runs west through the southern extremity of Cham Man! village in the Ramuz district to a mound named Rumais. From Rumais it runs s uth to Qarqar village on the right bank of the river Jarrahi, crosses that river at Dub-ul-Mir on the left bank, continues south for 5 miles ; it then runs south-east to ’Aquleh, about 8 miles west of Bandar Ma’shur, where it turns to the north-east ; finally, it passes through a large mound named Radhwan, 8 miles east of Khalafabad, and so returns, following a range of low hills to the point from which it started. Physical features. —With the exception of a few miles of broken ground and ravines in the extreme north-east of the district it consists of open, and generally level, plains of alluvial soil. Parts of these are fertilized by rainfall, and there is some permanent cultivation along the banks of the Jarrahi. The only trees are a few date trees near villages and a little scrub along the river. People. —The population is sparse ; in 1902 in numbered only 3,400 fighting men, and it has further declined since then in consequence of a succession of rainless years. It comprises representatives of the A1 Bu Ghubaish, Khanafireh, and ’Asa Klreh sections of the Ka’b tribe, of the BanI Khalid and Amur sections of the Bavieh, of the Ma’ammar section of the Zargan tribe, and of the Muwayid section of the Hamaid. To these must be added the Haiyadir tribe—who number 300 fighting men, own some horses, many donkeys, sheep, and cattle, and are engaged in agriculture—also the Maqatlf, a small section said to belong to the BanI Tamim, and the Rajaibat and BanI Rashid, who are described as sections, of the Sharif at, possibly indentical with the Shurafa of the Hawlzeh district. The Rajaibat and BanI Rashid till the ground, but they inhabit tents and possess some 200 camels, besides horses, donkeys, sheep, and cattle ; their fighting men together number only about 50. The chief village of the district is Khalafabad, and there are about 30 other hamlets on the banks of the Jarrahi, some of which are described in the article on that river; many of them, however, are only occupied in the seasons of sowing and reaping by cultivators from the Fallahleh district. Agriculture and trade. —Canal irrigation is confined, in the Jarrahi dis- tric t, to a space of about three square miles in the neighbourhood of Cham us-S abl, and the crops, except on the banks of the river, depend entirely oqJAR—JAR: 455 Tainfall. Wheat, barley, and a little sesame are the staple produces of cul tivation. Onions and inferior tobacco are grown in the gardens of villages. The exported produce of the district finds its way chiefly to the town of Bandar Ma’shur and Buzieh, from which it procures in return its require ments of piece-goods, spices, tea, and sugar. Dates are brought from Falla- hieh and rice from Ramuz. Communications.-—The Jarrahi is navigable by boats up to Khalafabadr and the country on both sides is free from obstacles to movement. Administration. —The Jarrahi district was once a part of the old Dauraq principality which belonged to the Ka’b Shaikh. In 1865 the Persian Government separated it from Fallahieh and constituted it, together with the districts of Bandar Ma shur and Hmdlan into a separate governorship r now it is a district by itself and is under the Shaikh of Muhammarreh who is locally represented by an agent at Khalafabad. Revenue is assessed at one-fourth of gross produce on canal irrigated lands at Cham-us-Sabi only, at one-fifth on river bank lands, and elsewhere at a cash rate of 44 krdns fer fadddn. The revenue was farmed 10 years ago to a Persian official, who paid 3,000 tumdns down and engaged to render a yearly tribute of 6,500 tumdns. Another account says that 14,000 tumdns are payable annually to the Persian Government, while 600 go to the Mustaufi.— {Foreign Depart ment Gazetteer, 1905; Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) JARRAHI (River )— This river is formed within the bounds of Ramuz district by the junction of the Ramuz river with the Marun. Passing a place called Chan Mani, 4 miles below the conflnence, the river breaks through a belt of low hills and emerges near Cham-us-Sabi into the Jarrahi district. Thence it runs via Khalafabad to the village of Maqtu’, 11 miles north of Ma’shur, where it changes direction and runs for about 10 miles west-north-west to Qarqar, where it leaves the Jarrahi district and enters that of Fallahieh. It then flows practically west for 14 miles, and then turns south-west and runs for 5 miles to Khazineh, 2 miles north of Buzieh town, where it mostly is dissipated into canals. The remaining stream now becomes the Fallahieh-Marid canal. Above Cham-us-Sabi the river is broad and rapid, with a breadth of about 80 yards, and the banks, which are of no great height, are covered with tamarisks. For some miles below Cham-us-Sabi the same charac teristics are preserved, and the stream is divided by islands. Below Khalaf abad the Jarrahi runs with a slow current, and is 60 to 70 yards broad. From this point onwards its breadth gradually diminishes to about 40 yards. The river is fordable in summer at numerous places, and some fords near Khalafabad are fordable for laden animals during the greater part of the year, except after recent rain. There is a ford difficult in winter, 1 mile below Cham-us-Sabi, and another unfordable in winter at Rahaneh, 8 miles above Maksar. A ballam, which can be used as a ferry boat, is kept at Maksar, and there is another at Haddameh. Boats 40 feet long, with a beam of 6 to 8 feet and drawing 2 to 3 feet of water, can ascend the river as far as Khalafabad at all seasons.JAR—JAR 457 Name. Miles below last village and on which bank.

A village in the Dizful district of Northern ’Arabistan situated about 16 miles south-east of Dizful and 22 miles north-west of Shushtar. It is the ordinary halting-place for travellers between these two towns. Kahiinak stands on the left bank of the stream of the same name, which is an affluent of the Ab-i-Diz. The bed of the Ab-i-Kahunak, at the village, is usually a dry, or nearly dry, stretch of shingle about a mile across! After moderate rain, however, there is a good flow of water in several distinct channels, and heavy rain renders it impassable for short periods. The village consists of about 100 mud houses. It is not surrounded by a wall as are most of the villages of- the Dizful district. A caravanserai stands about 200 yards north of the village. It is a mud-walled enclosure, but some of the interior buildings are of brick, and there are a few small lodgings for better class travellers in a bdldhhdneh. This building, along with the right to maintain 2 shops in the village, is held on lease by a private individual, who pays 50 tumdns yearly to the owner of the caravan serai and 2 tumdns to the Kadkhuda of Kahunak. The only defences of the village are a small mud tower, with a timber roof, just outside it on the Dizful side, and a couple of two-stoned buildings in the town, which show a few loopholes. The inhabitants are Bakhtlaris and a few Dizfulis, and there is one shopkeeper from Shushtar. The fighting strength fluctuates. At best - there are but 10 to 12 rifles and, in September 1904, when an attack by DL akwand Lur was expected, the place was almost deserted. -470 KAH—KAI Kahflnak belongs to the Bakhtiari Khans and to Agha ’All MustaufL of Dizful. Rice, kunjid, mash, wheat, barley, beans, and cotton are cul tivated on the village lands which are irrigated from the Ab-i-Kahunak. A canal runs out of the stream a few hundred yards above the village and beyond Kahunak, reaches a group of hamlets called Gumar, which also it serves. There is a fair supply of water at all seasons of the year, but it is rather brackish. No transport is procurable at Kahunak, except about 50 donkeys. Cattle number about 150 sheep, and goats about 60. There are four shrines here—the imdmzddeh of Bibi-Qulkhan, close to the caravanserai, a kadamgdh of Hazrat ’Abbas and another of the Imam- i-Riza, both on the south side of the village and close to it; and, lastly, a kadamgdh, called Amir Vazir, | of a mile from the village in the direction of Shushtar. These shrines are visited by the surrounding Arabs, as well as by Dizful is and Shushtaris. The revenue of Kahunak is paid into the Dizful treasury. With that of Gumar, it amounts to 1,000 tumdns per annum for crops, except rice, being assessed, it is said, at the rate of 2 tumdns per plough. Half-pro- duce in kind is paid on account of rice cultivation. The annual cash assessment of Kahunak, separately, is now (1907) reported to be 318 tumdns. A flour mill, belonging to the village, which charges customers 1 bran and 1 Dizfuli man of flour for every 12 Dizfull man ground, is assessed to revenue at 500 tumdns a year .—{Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) KlHCNAK (AB-I)— A stream in Northern ’Arabistan which, in the spring, brings down a considerable body of water from the melting snows, but is dry in summer.

These merge into one deep channel on passing through a low range of hills, which divides the plains of Kahunak and Ab-i-Bid, A few miles later it flows past Kahunak, where the road from Shushtar to Dizful crosses it by a brick bridge and, after a farther course of some 18 miles in a south-westerly direction, it flows into the Ab-i-Diz, about 42 miles (by river) south of Dizful.— {Arhuthnot, 1905.)

From the ZallakI village of Makhadi {vide this Guzztteer) the track descends more than a thousand feet to the bed of the Rakulistan (6,300 feet), which stream, now 20 yards wide and 3£ feet deep, has cut for itself a channel through mud hills and rocky ranges regardless of natural formations, and forms an important physical feature of this country. Owing to the low altitude of its bed an immediate vicinity, and its narrow defiles here and there, there are no habitations on its banks and no track along its course. The high, flat broad mud spurs alongside form the cultivable portions on which the llidts from neighbouring villages reside.

A ruined fort about 8 miles south of Saidabad in the Sirj an district of Kirman, of which province it is said to be an ancient capital. The fort, which is also known as Kaleh-i-Baizeh, is shaped like an egg. Its direction is from north-west to south-east, and it is about 400 yards long with a breadth of about 200 yards. The white limestone rock on which it stands rises about 300 feet above the plain and is a conspicuous landmark. The area enclosed by the great outer wall is very considerable, and the town must have held, in its prime, some 8,000 or 9,000 inhabitants. An inner wall of defence, with swelling bastions and pierced with two openings which must have been gates, rises at some distance from the outer wall and the place must have been immensely strong. There is nothing to indicate the actual age of the fortress, but an inscrip tion on the rock shows that the hammam within the walls was constructed in A. D. 1019. Kaleh-i-Sang was taken by Timur, and destroyed. When the district recovered from the Tartar ravages a new capital was- built, and named Shahr-i-Bi-Umidi, or the City of Despair. Upon the Afghan invasion the old fort was again occupied, but was captured by the enemy and, Shahr-i-Bi-Umidi having been destroyed, Saidabad was founded by a certain Mirza Saiyid in its immediate proximity.— {Sykes, 1902 — New comen, 1905.)

A village in the lower Bakhtlarl country, the 5th stage from Nasirieh (100 miles) on the Bakhtlarl caravan road, and 32 miles east by north of Bam Hormuz. The fort outside is fairly strong, but inside it is entirely ruined. Apparently, it has few rooms fit to live in the half towards the gate ; the other half, which may be better, is occupied by the women. The fort appears to have been built by Muhammad Saqi Khan, Layard’s friend, and to have been restored several times since. There is a well inside the ramparts. It has now 6 flanking towers of plastered masonrv and a square one in which is the gate. The mound on which it stands is 100 feet high, sloping to the south-west and falling steeply to the north-east, whence it can be approached to the foot of the walls, out of view and of fire, through gardens. It would be difficult to take without artillery. The bulk of the village lies to the south-west of the mound, but there are also habitations to the south, north-east, north-west and north. It is the seat of the chief representative of the Chehar Lang Bakhtiari, Khuda Kariam Khan (1906), who is of local importance and friendly to the British. To the south-east of the fort, and some 500 yards from it, is a garden with pomegranate and large trees. The surrounding plain is barren and stony. Banking (1910) says water ad lib from stream ; 150 houses ; supplies for 200 mules. Ful scarce, from hills some distance off. Supplies are limited and water is said to be scarce although it supports a considerable village and a certain amount of rice cultivation.

Wells are numerous, though the water in some of them is brackish and used for irrigation only. A narrow bank of sand, 12 feet high, here contitutes the coast line.

KALEH SAPID— Lat. 30° 13' (approx.) N. ; Long. 51° 28' (approx.) E.; Elev. A rocky hill and fortress in the Shulistan district of Fars, some 70 miles north-west of Shiraz ; on the left bank of the Fehllan river. The hill gets its name from the white colour of its rocks, and from the fact of it being used as a stronghold in times of disturbance. It is an isolated, precipitous hill, 4 to 5 miles in length, 2 miles in breadth, and has a broad base, perhaps miles, in diameter. Near its summit it presents an abrupt rampart, and its crest :s said to be accessible by three paths, only known to the Mamas- sani, though other writers say that there is only one way to the top and that not an easy one. The sides are scarps of perpendicular rock. There is a road cut along the face of the rock defended by two towers and a gate. At the summit of the rock, which is about 1,000 feet above the plain, is a fine, level plateau about f of a mile square, the soil fine, and with numerous springs of water. It was taken both by Alexander and Timur. The only fortifications are a line of huge stones ranged in regular order round the edges of the precipices. Each of these is wedged beneath by another of smaller dimensions ; when the smaller one is removed the large one is hurled in an instant from the top to the bottom, sweeping before it with irresistible force every thing that tends to interrupt its course. The hill is a positionKAL—KAL 495 of some importance as it commands tke high r-ad to Shiraz from ’Arabistan and Bchbehan. The rock runs from north-west to south-east and is composed of limestone, on all sides very precipitous, but least so towards the west. There is abundance of oak and other trees on its summit, and plenty of water but no habitations. To the north runs the Talagun branch of the Tab river, nearly in a north-west direction. There are four principal entrances to the fort, which face to the north-east, south-east, west and south-west ; these are approached by very difficult and stony paths liable to have masses of rock thrown on them from above. Even in the present state of the neighbouring roads, guns might probably be brought with great labour near enough to the west entrance to cover an attacking party from a lower height close to it called the Shutur Khwab ; at all events a road could be constructed for that purpose, but the capture of the fort in this manner, which must be attended with considerable loss, seems a matter of doubtful importance provided it could be strictly blockaded ; as its surrender, if shut out from the surrounding country, must soon follow from want of supplies. The Fehlian river, on the bank of which it stands, is here 18 yards wide and 3 feet deep,- running with a rapid current. Just by the hills it is joined by the shul stream from the north, the main stream from the east being here called the Tang-i-Khast, from a narrow gorge through which it flows,— (Monteitk — DeBode — Kinneir — Jones—Wells Baring — MacGowan, 1895 —• Hopkins, 1903.)

KALHUR— ’ name a tribo of Kurds who live in the province of Kirmanshah. ey number 6,365 te^ts or families and are partly nomad, partly seden- taiy. Their garmsir or summer quarters are the mountains to the north- P us ht-i-Kuh; their sardsir or winter quarters are the plains o uhab and Qasr-i-Shlrm as far the Turkish frontier. A section of this ■ e ' some 300 famillies, inhabit the Saklz district of Kurdistan, the men aie tall, manly, strong, and excellent marksmen, the women too are hand-some. Sir H. Rawlinson fancied from the marked Jewish cast of counten ance that they might be decendants of the Samaritan captives who were placed in the Assyrian city of Kalhur Halah, identified with Sai-i-Pu3-i- Zuhab, on the main road from Baghdad to Kirmanshah. They are variously reported to be ’All Illahls and Shl’ahs. The land occupied by the Kalhur is milkuat (or “ private property ”), i.e., the proprietary right is vested in a chief of the tribe, and not in the Shah of (except when they have bought their fields for money) in indivi dual members of the tribe. It rests with the chief to distribute the land for cultivation as he pleases. The usual arrangement in case of ddi land is for the raiyat to provide all the labour and seed ; after the corn crop has been threshed, he takes as his own share two-thirds of the gross-produce, leaving the remaining third for the mdlik (or “ owner ”). When the land is daim the cultivator takes three shares out of the four. The cultivator also pays as mdlidt an annual sum in cash, which varies in amount according to his own supposed capabilities and the exigencies or rapacity of the mdlik. The relations of the chief with the Government are of a two-fold character : first, he is Sartip (or Colonel-in-chief) of the military contingent which the tribe has to furnish ; secondly, he is Hakim (or Civil Governor) of the Kalhur country, and is responsible “for the revenue (mdlidt) due from the landed possession of the tribe. The appointment of Sartip is made by the Shah, and that of Hakim by the Governor of Kirmanshah, consequently the two appointments are not always united in the same individual. The military force, which the Sartip of the Kalhur is properly bound to furnish for the service of the State, consists of a regiment of fcot 800 strong and some cavalry, but in practice he only maintains 100 infantry and a personal cavalry escort some 200 strong. The ruling family of the Kalhurs belong to the Shahbazi clan. In 1892 the chief of the Kalhurs was Riza Quli Khan.* The chiefs, like all the Kurdish chiefs, are always ready to take refuge in Turkish territory, and it is doubtful if the Persian Government could trust them in case of need. The tribe own some 1,500 breech-loading rifles ; up till quite recently they paid taxes 49,400 krdns, receiving back 50,000 krdns pay of the regi ment, they now have to pay 250,000 krdns and get nothing back as pay of the regiment. The tribe leave their winter quarters about May, and move to the high ground. They commence to return in October, and by the end of that month have all left their summer quarters. They are civil and inoffensive to the accredited European traveller, but whether they are so to the Persian one is doubtful. A considerable number of horses and mules are reared by them, the chief being said to own 400 mares and 250 mules, while a vastly larger amount are dispersed amongst the various branches of the tribe. They own vast flocks of sheep and goats which, at the moderate allowance of 20 to each ten, number not less than 126,000. In their annual migrations donkeys, of which there are great numbers, not less than two or three per cent, are the chief means of transport.— (Schiel — Rawlinson—Curzon — Preece — V aughan.) * The present chief (1J03) is Daiid Khaa, who is said to bo able, to put 4,©00 mcumted men in the field.KAL—KAL 503 The following is a list of the nomad branches of the tribe :— Chieftain.

It must be considered an important and strategical point on the line of advance from Bushire to Shiraz. This would form a good spot for a depot in the event of a force advancing by this road from Bushire. The cavalry and heavier guns might be left here while the infantry were clearing the passes in advance. Forage during the spring is very abundant, all the hills being covered with excellent grass. On this village converge three routes from Bushire, viz. :— (1) via Tang-i-Bahush. (2) via Haft Mulleh, (3) vm Tang-i-Sehdar. From Kalimeh to Shiraz are two routes, viz. :— (1) via Firuzabad.

A village of Ears, situated in a plain of the same name between Kunar Takhteh and Kazarun, 87 miles from Bushire on the road to Shiraz. The plain is situated near the summit of the pass called Kutal-i-Kamarij. It is a level patch 9 miles by 4, shut in by hills 600 to 800 feet high. The village has about 500 inhabitants and lies at the foot of the hills on the north-western side of the plain. Its grey houses are flat-roofed and built of stone. It has also a fort, a ruined serai, a telegraph rest-house and bald Jchdneh, a superior sort of chdpdr khaneh. Very few supplies are pro curable, but forage is abundant, and fuel is obtainable from the nomads in the vicinity. The water is good and plentiful from a well at summit of pass. The Kutal-i-Kamarij is remarkable for the singular conformation of the long flat-topped hills at its foot, and the extreme badness of the road. Half-way up the road becomes so narrow that a laden mule strikes its load against the rocks on either hand. It is literally a staircase, ascending 1,200 feet, shut in by overhanging peaks on the left (going to Kazarun), and with a torrent bed far below on the right. The opposite side of the torrent-bed is flanked by a black wall of rock, 300 feet high. On account of its narrow ness great inconvenience is experienced when caravans from opposite sides meet in the middle, vide this Gazetteer, Kutal-i-Kamarij. Salt is found at Kamarij.— {Petty ; Stack ; Ross ; Curzon ; 1889, Routes in Persia, Section I, Ed. 1898.) KAMARIJ (District). History .—About 1905 in the time of Haidar Khan, its late chief, the district of Kamarij was more important than to-day. Haidar Khan, by force of arms, obtained unlimited control from the top of the Kutal-i-Malum to Kazarun where he established himself as Deputy Governor, and turned out and defeated Khwaja Ibrahim, Kaldntar of Kazarun. Haidar Khan died of wounds inflicted by a slave at Kazarun in September 1919, leaving an infant son, Farajullah Khan, in the guardianship of a black confidant Khurshid. The latter possessed considerable talents, and great bravery. He had to repel attacks by a brother of the late Haidar Khan, and constant aggression from men, whom he had outlawed from Kamarij, including the well-known ’All Muhammad. The Kashkulls were bitter enemies of his, and coveted the district. In the spring of 1911 Kizam-us-Sultaneh deter mined to attack Kamarij, urged on by Saulat-ud-Dauleh. Several hundred Qashqais with other partisans of Nizam bombarded the village and Khurshid after shutting himself up in the Khans’s fort, on which many of his own villagers fired, escaped to the Kuh-i-Mast. He was gradually joined by his adherents, and returned in June 1911 to Kamarij, when he destroyed most of Hia m -rpia/rp Lo prevent the inhabitants oppos-ggBHBHBHBnMMB I 1 EAM—KAM 503 ing him again. He made a great show of ruling, not in his own right, but on behalf of Farajullah Khan. Khurshid Khan had always been friendly to the British, and in December 1911, gave warning about the attack on Mr. Smart at Rahdar. In August 1911, he was accidentally killed, and Kamarij was taken over by Mulla Qull on behalf of Haidar Khan’s son. Haidar Khan’s widow had married Husain Beg of DalikI and his daughter had married Khwaja ’Abdullah, Nasir-ud-Divan, Kaldntar of Kazarun, so the family was closely connected with its neighbours. During the latter part of 1912 the Kamarijls w^ere continually quarrelling with the Kashkulis being supported by the Kazarunis. Kunar, Takhteh (Khisht) Dalakr, Borazjun, and Shabankareh were all mixed up in these quarrels, the last three siding with Kamarij. In 1912 Kamarij maintained about 70 road guards. Geography. —The principal portion of the Kamarij district consists of a level plain stretching from a little beyond the top of the Kutal-i-Kamarij to the southern end of the Tang-i-Turkan, and measuring some four miles by three miles. But the actual boundaries at present are : on the north, the southern end of Tang-i-Turkan ; south, the village of Charum on the banks of the Shapur river, beyond the foot of the Kamarij Kutal; east the, mountains Kuh-i-Mast and Kuh-i-Gunjisbk, which separate the district from the Kazarun plain ; west, the river Shapur at Rudak, which belongs to Kamarij; Only five villages are in the district :•—Kamarij (about 150 houses inhabited), Rudak, Banaft, Charum. Caravanserai (Deh Kuhneh). It formerly was part of the sub-government of Khisht, but is now owned by Mushir-ud-Dauleh, to whom the revenue is paid. Qashqai clans are neighbours to the district on three sides : the Kashkull and Chehar Bunicheh tribes outside the further extremity of the Tang-i- Turkan and near Bushakun : the Farslmadan about four miles the further side of the Kuh-i-Mast : the Kashkull again about seven miles to the west of Rudak. KAMAR-I-QARAVUL— Lat. Long. Elev. A hill west of Tihran-Karvan, from the top of which an outlook was kept by sentinels (qardvul). — (Schindler.) KAMAR-IZHAK (?)— Lat. Long. Elev. A village between Pul-i-Gurg and Chambinaki or Aiyub, Fars, to north of Shiraz— (Durand). KAMAR SURKH, RUDKHANEH-I— A brackish stream in the south of Pusht-i-Kuh, crossed about 5 miles north-west of Deh Luran. Its breadth varies from 5 yards to 50 yards, •and after one night’s rain its depth was 6 inches with a current of 4 miles an hour. The banks are steep and precipitious, except at the crossing place. •— (Ranking, 1809). KAMARUN— Lat. Long. Elev. A hamlet in the Bakhtiari country, situated in a fertile, well watered valley about 5 miles long, of which the stream joins the Gukun (vide this Gazetteer) through a narrow, deep gorge.— (Sawyer, 1890.)504 KAM—KAM n KAM FlRtJZ (valley)—Lat. 30° 12' ; Long. 52° 27' ; Elev. A valley, plain and buluk of Ears, situated on the upper reaches of the Kur or Band Amir river, north-west of Shiraz. It is a beautiful valley between two ranges of high mountains, clothed with trees and bushes. To the south-west the Kuh range, covered with snow and about 14,000 feet in elevation, stands boldly up. To the west the summit of the Kuh Dina is just visible. The valley is highly cultivated and full of fine crops ; it is covered with villages, 20 in number, and down its centre flows the fine, broad, fresh water river Kur, whose banks are clothed with trees and bushes. The river here is a clear and rapid stream containing large fish, and has numerous fords passable by men on foot. The chief ford by which the road crosses is almost due south of the town, and runs straight across the river, which is 40 yards broad, with clear, cold water and a swift current. The ford is 2 to 3 feet deep over a bed of gravel and shingle. The forests to the south and south-west contains the bear, leopard and wild boar. The names of the villages are given by Durand as under :— 1. ’Aliabad. 2. Bagh-i-Nau. 3. Bilu. 4. Cham-i-Zami. 5. Kahmin. 6. Kaleh-i-Chugheh. 7. Kaleh-i-Chukan. 8. Kamin. 9. Khurreh Vakan. 10. Khani Man. 11. Sir-i-Mangan. 12. Majnaveh. 13. Mansurabad. 14. Palangi or Palan gari. 15. Tal-i-Surkh. Five other names doubtful. Khani Man is the chief town. The valley in 1878 belonged to Haji Nasir- ullau Khan ; and Durand says that it appears he sold Khani Man, Bilu, Bakian and Palangi to the Mushir-ul-Mulk. Vaughan, however, says in 1891 that the village numbered 19, apparently exclusive of Khani Man and the Governor of that town (and presumubly of the whole district, for he administers Dilkhun) in that year was Haji Khuda Khan. The estimated population of the district is 3,500. Vide also this Gazetteer—Khani Man.— {Durand — Vaughan, 1891.) KAMlN— A district of Ears north-east of Shiraz.

KANA (River)— A stream in the south-west of Laristan, which flowing from south-east to north-west, drains the Gallehdar plain. It is crossed by the road from Bushire to Bandar ’Abbas in the vicinity of Asir, and its bed is here 20 feet to 30 feet wide, with gentle shelving banks, and a small flow of brackish water. Lower down in its course this stream is known as the Riz river.— (Butcher, March 1888.) KANAYEH, vide GANAVEH. KAND ’ARAB!— Lat. 29° 20' N. ; Long. 54° 38' E. ; Elev.

A very narrow part of the pass between Kalimeh and Ahram in Ears, which a few men could hold against an army.— (Taylor.) KANGAN— Lat. 27° 49' 20' ; Long. 52° 8' 45' ; Elev. With the exception of its small dependency, Banka, Kangan is the northernmost of the Shibkuh ports on the Persian coast, and the only one of them lying north of the region in which the main maritime range falls directly into the sea. These high hills first strike the coast about 5 miles w T est of Kangan Kangan is situated at the eastern end of a large bay, open to the south but fairly well sheltered from the Shamdl, at the opposite end of which, 9 miles to the westward, stands the rival port of Daiyir Kangan is about 20 miles north-west of the next considerable Shibkuh Port, that of Tahiri and is exactly opposite to Bahrain, from which it is distant about 140 miles. The place, at the present time (1906) partially abandoned, normally consists of some 300 Arabs of mixed tribes ; about two-thirds of the popu lation are Sunnis and the remainder Shfahs. The people are fishermen, pearl-divers and sailors owning eight large boats which run to Qatr, Bahrain, Qatif, Basrah and various Persian ports, also a dozen baqdreh of the kind called amileh which are used for fishing ; they also cultivate dates and grain ; there are about 2,000 palms. There is good water-in 3 wells, 4 to 5 fathoms deep, and a hot spring resorted to on account of its curative proper ties ; and a fair anchorage, inferior, however, to that of Daiyir, in a Shimdl. A square fort stands in the middle of the town. The number of shops is about 20 ; imports are sugar, tea, rice, and piece-goods ; exports are wheat, barley, sheep, cattle, firewmod, charcoal and onions. Kangan, once the site of a Portuguese factory, has always been a bone of contention between the Khan of Dashti and his neighbours in the south. It was formerly in the possession of the Khan of Gavbandi, who about 1858506 KAR—KAR put the Katkhuda to death on suspicion of an intrigue to hand the place over to the Khan of Dashti. Thereupon the Khan of Dashti attacked and destroyed Kangan, ravaging the coast and destroying all the date-groves as far as Tahinl. The Persian Government twice appointed a commis sion to report on the occurrence, but on both occasions the Commissioner was bought over by the Khan of Dashti and no result followed. For at least 7 years Kangan remained a heap of ruins, to the material advantage of the neighbouring Dashti port of Daiyir. It is now governed on behalf of the Khan of Dashti who holds it in farm. A post of the Persian Imperial Customs was established herein 1904. Kangan is the port of Jam and Riz in the interior, 10 to 20 miles distant northwards.— [Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

The village contains 30 mat huts and a grove of date trees. A little wheat and barley are grown, but the supplies available are insignificant ; here is good and plentiful water, and kiindr bushes afford a supply of fuel. The camping-ground here is good, as is also the grazing. Native information says tnat a road leads from here to Daiyir on the sea-coast, 32 miles distant—{Butcher, 1888.)508 X Aft—EAR KARDINEH— Lat. Long. Elev.” The lower of two villages in the Dashti district of Ears, aboht 6 miles south-east of Lavar, 1 mile east of the road between Bushire and Lar situated near the foot of low, tumular, grassy h\\h.—(Butcher, 1888.) KARIAN (1)— Lat. 28° 3' N. ; Long. 53° 37' E. ; Elev. A village in the district to Bldshahr, Ears, the governor of which in 1882 was Lutf Ali Khan. The village, which once must have contained 2,000 inhabitants, had only three families at the time of Stack’s visit. It is on the load fiom Lar to Flruzabad. There is a mud fort close to the village, and two others in the plain about a mile to the east. One of the latter is the mud fort (Kaleh-i-Gileh) built when Karim Khan was reigning in Shiraz (1780) ; it is a square earthwork with a side of 120 yards, and had a tower every 13 yards. The other is the “ Fort of the Fire Well, ” so called from the discovery of naphtha in a well hard by ; it is a tower fort with a wall on a mound. Forts and well are in ruins now. Karian stands in the middle of three rocky hills, and these also are said to have been fortified. The tradition of the place is that Shah Karan was besieged here by 12,000 Mussalmans when the Arabs first invaded Persia. While they were at their prayers, he sallied out and slew them all without resistance. In the Mussalman camp were 40 virgins, 37 of whom, in answer to their prater for deliverance, were swallowed up by the earth. The remaining three fled in various directions. The cave which sheltered one is called Ghar Bibi, or “ Lady’s Cave ” to this day. The second died of exhaustion at a spot where the shrine called Blbi-Darmandeh or “Tired out-Lady' is, a famous place for childless wives. Hajat who had conquered Kir, hearing of the catastrophe, came to avenge his brother, but could not take the fort until Shah Karan was betrayed by his wife, who was a second Delilah and who had fallen in love A\ith Hajat. Hajat married and then killed her, as he had no wish to be betrayed. Being informed that the way to find Shah Karan’s treasure was to make blood flow down the hill-side, he proceeded to cut the throats of the inhabitants at the top of the hill, and an old woman, when her turn came, revealed the secret, by advising him to get the great store of wine from the vaults and pour that down the hill-side ; the last jar of wine hid the door of the treasure house. Karian was evidently once a flourishing and well-built place. Conical domes of dh-ambdrs rise among the ruined houses, testifying to a large water-supply and a large population in former years. The neighbourhood is infested by robbers, and the few remaining inhabitants complain of the misgovernment of the Kajars. As a proof of the insecurity of property, it may be observed that the herdsmen on the hills are armed with guns. The surrounding countrv in good seasons ought to be very fertile, and there is some very fine wheat under Karian. An ancient qandt waters the village, and Luft ’All Khan attempted to make another unsuccessfully.— (Stack.) KARIAN (2) Lat. Long. Elev.

KARIND (1)— A river of Kirmanshah, which rises close to the Gates of Zagros, a few miles west of the town of Karind, and has a tortuous course of nearly 100 miles in a south-east direction. Its principal source is, however, immediately above the town in large clean pool of fresh water full of springs, with a sandy bed, in which the sand is continually being displaced by water push ing it up. It then flows through gardens above the town where numerous other springs increase its volume and down through the town on to the plain whose south-east border it skirts, until, in the latter part of its course, it forces its way through the Zagros by a tremendous gorge into the plain of Zangavar. Thence it takes the name of Ab-i-Shirvan as it passes in a south-south-east direction through the valley of Rudbar, being increased by the Zangavar, Ab-i-Shlrvan, and two other streams, all of which come from the west. It flows south-west and joins the Kara Su and Karkheh in Zangavar ; the united stream is called the Karkheh.— (Rawlinson—St. John — Vaughan.) {See also Ab-i-Karim in Gazetteer of Kirmanshah.

A town in Kirmanshah, 56 miles west of the town of that name and some 170 miles from Baghdad, on the road between the two places. It is510 KAR—KAK described by Fraser as grotesquely, rather than picturesquely, placed at the' mouth of a gorge between too precipitous hills. The houses, though small are neat and built in terraces on the slope of the gorge, with the naked and scarped rock rising abruptly above them. Rich gardens extend up the defile and along the base of the mountain, which produce a variety of fruits (including the celebrated stoneless grape known as that of Karind) which ripen during the end of July and August. The willow and the lofty poplar attain a considerable size on the margin of a mountain stream that bisects the village, and is afterwards turned off into smaller channels for the supply of the gardens in the plain. Several copious springs issuing from the plain, which is here about 3 miles broad, add their water to numer ous mountain streams and from the sources of the Ab-i-Karind, the north west tributary of the Karkheh river. The temperature is very mild, when Jones visited it in August the maximum point of the thermometer was only 85°. A mild east wind prevails throughout the nights, and is followed by a refreshing west wind that lasts during the day. Karind has long been celebrated in Persia for the excellence of its steel work ; the inhabitants however mainly live by agriculture ; a few carpets are made. The gunsmiths at Karind are reputed to be the best workmen in Western Persia. They turn out exceedingly good Martini rifles at about tumdns 20 (Rs. 45) a-piece and will copy anything. There are four gun smiths in the town, and the average output of rifles amount to about 100- per annum. Cartridge cases, however, cannot be made ; they are obtained from Europe or old once are recapped and filled, home-made powder being used, which is described as being better than the usual Persian powder. The population may be 3,000 mainly belonging to the ’All Illahi sect; 32 families of Jews. There are several mills in the town, each being able to grind 6,5C0 lbs. of wheat in 24 hours, and a Persian Government Telegraph Office. The fine caravanserai built by Shah ’Abbas is now in ruin. Supplies : cattle and plough oxen, 3,000 sheep, 500 goats, firewood. A road from here to Gavarreh, distant 14 miles, said to be practicable for mules.—(Jowes— Curzon — Preece — V aughan — Gough , 1806 .) (See also Gazetteer of Kirmanshah.) KARINDl— A tribe of Kurds partly nomad, partly sedentary, living in Kirmanshah. Their country extends from the Bishaveh plain to Khusrauabad, 12 miles from the town of Karind ; beyond this is Kalhur country. They are estimated at 1,000 families. In the summer they occupy the hills above Karind ; in the winter the Karind plain. They are supposed to provide a battalion of infantry. Their chief is generally Sartip of the battalion and Governor of the tribe. The arrangements for cultivation are the same as those obtaining amongst the Kalhurs (g.v.). They are for the most part ’AH Illahis.— (Curzon — Preece.) (See also under Kerindi in Gazetteer of Kirmanshah.) KARIZ KHANEH —Lat. Long. Elev. A village 111 miles north-west of Yarpusht in the Tihran-Karvan district, a mile to the left of the road from Isfahan to Burujird.— (Schindler.)KAR KUNAN or KANUN— A project for diverting a portion of the head-waters of the Karun river to increase those of the Zindeh Rud. Its original initiation is ascribed to Shah Tahm Asp in the sixteenth century, who began to excavate a tunnel, but is said to have been repelled by the noxious vapours. ’Abbas the Great commenced a cutting on an enormous scale, but was vanquished by the snows and the cold in winter. ’Abbas II tried the experiment of damming the river and mining the rock under the direction of M. Genest, a French engineer. Both schemes were failures, and there the matter has rested till the present time. The main sources of the Zindeh Rud are in the Shur Ab valley. Separating the bed of the Karun from the Shhur Ab valley is a long, narrow col called Gal Gushak, a spur of the Kuh-i-Rang. At this point, where the real Karun is augmented by the Sar-i-Chashmeh shring and the head-w r aters from the Kuh-i-Rang, this work, known as the Kar Kunan, was commenced. The idea has been described as a grand conception worthy of a mighty monarch ; in reality it is an illustration of the parable of the man who royally neglected first to count the cost. Though many thousands of workmen have been working for years, at the most advantageous appraising, but one-twentieth of the necessary wmrk can as yet have been accomplished. And if the same cheap manual labour were to be employed to finish this “ mighty conception, ” probably one-fiftieth of the cost only has as yet been defrayed. The levels are favourable, and in European hands the task could be accomplished without difficulty, probably by tunnelling. But as to the expected practical effect of such a contemplated diversion, it is w T ell possible for divided opinions to exist.. The Karun can spare the amount of water without hurting an inhabitant on its banks, for it may be safely assumed that such a diversion, if ever accomplished, would not lower the water level at Shushtar by the thousandth part of an inch. On the other hand, it is open to doubt whether, if left to itself in the dry bed of the Zindeh Rud, a drop of the acquired inflow would ever reach Isfahan. — [Sawyer, 1890—Curzon 1892.) KARKHEH— One of the most important of the rivers of Western Persia. Its sources and its upper courses, before it takes the name of Karkheh, are described under the various headings Gamasiah, Kara Su and Saimarreh in this gazet teer. From the junction of the Ab-i-Zal with the last named, at a point some 30 miles north-north-west of Dizful, these streams continue their joint course as the Karkheh. This course is almost due south from the point of junction ; the river thence skirting the south-eastern slopes of the Kabir Kuh, and winding through the hummocky hills which divide the great mountain ranges of Laristan from the plains of ’Arabistan. At 20 miles it receives a brackish affluent on its right bank called the Siahgu, and some 8 miles lower down and on the same bank, another nameless brackish stream. Twelve miles farther on, or at 40 miles of its course, it enters the plains of ’Arabistan, about 15 miles to the west of the Ab-i-Diz. Near its exit from the hills, where it is still a rapid mountain stream of whitish water, it was formerly spanned by a bridge, remains of which.. Pt. I. 2 o512 KAR—KAR bear the name of Pa-i-Pul. Immediately below Pa-i-Pul the river is ford able in summer, but not without difficulty, the fords both here and a Aivan- i-Karkheh and Susa being shifting and dangerous ; on the left bank name less mounds marking the site of a town, and remains of large canals, adjoin this ford. About 4 miles south-west of Pa-i-Pul to the right of the river and half a mile from it, are the Sassanian ruins of Aivan-i-Kasra or Asiran- i-Karkheh. At Aivan-i-Karkheh the river flows in several arms divided by low islands. Being little below the level of the adjacent country, it is immediately available for irrigation, and a number of canals diverge from its left bank and water the lands of the Sagwand Lurs, and of the tribe of Karim Khan, west of Dizful. Below Aivan-i-Kasra, 60 years ago, the banks were thickly wooded, and the river then appeared to be navigable for vessels of light draught. Leave- ing Shush, the ruins of Susa, at 56 miles and some distance from its left bank, and in some places approaching, it is said, within a short distance of the Diz river, the Karkheh pursues its course with numberless windings in a general south-south-east or south by east direction to a place at 120 miles and about 25 miles west of Band-i-Qir, where it swings suddenly to the south-west and so runs for about 20 miles, passing in this stage between the hills which form the north-eastern boundary of the Hawizeh district and the low range which form their prolongation and crosses the Karun river at Ahwaz. This bend of the Karkheh to the south-westwards appears to be a recent feature ; there is reason to think that the river fell into the Karun a few miles below Ahwaz, and it is believed that at the present day this condition of affairs could be restored by artificial means. At the enc of this reach, or at say 150 miles, the Karkheh reaches Nahr Hashim in the Hawizeh district, the site formerly of a massive dam by which the whole irrigation of the district was regulated. When his dam was in existence the farther courses of the river lay first southwards and then through Hawizeh town ; but since the dam gave w T ay in 1837, the main stream of the river has taken a north-westerly course from Nahr Hashim, and its waters, dissipated in streams and marshes, have submerged and ruined the district. At the western extremity of the district the river gradually re-assembles its waters, and finally under the name of the Shwaib and augmented by the overflow of some of the Tigris marches, it enters the Shatt-al-’Arab about 4 miles below Qurneh. A small steam-vessel ascended the Shwaib to 10 miles from its mouth in the autumn of 1841, when the stream was at its lowest. The waters of the upper Karkheh are celebrated for their purity, but lower down the stream is contaminated by the stagnant fluid of the marshes. Some of the villages of the Dizful district are irrigated from the Karkheh. The river is the western boundary of effective Persian jurisdiction exercised from Dizful. The country to the west of the Karkheh above Pa-i-Pul is Pusht-i-Khuh ; below on the same side are the locations of the Bani Turuf and other virtually independent tribes.— (Burton—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908 — Arbuthnot, 1905.) Character of banks .—The banks are wooded with tamarisk jungle and small trees. A belts of scrub, known as Jangal-i-Gharabi, extends for aKAR—KAR 51$ distance of about 50 miles between the Karkheh and the Shaur rivers, and has an average breadth of 5 miles. Irrigation and villages. —The waters of the river are used for irrigation to a large extent. In places it dissolves into a network of canals. The only village of importance on the Karkheh above the point where it enters the Hawlzeh district appears to be Khairabad, which is on the left bank below Shush. It has 80 houses.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) KARMlZ KUH— A range of hills in Laristan, running roughly east and west, about 1| miles north of the town of Girash.^— {Butcher, 1888.) KARMUSTEH— Kuh-i-Karmusteh, a cliff , a few farsakfis south of Lar, once mined for iron and sulphur, but now no longer exploited for the purpose.— {Wilson and Cruickshank, 1907.) Karmusteh is a valley some thirty miles long by twelve miles wide, lying to the south-east of Lar. To the north it is bounded by the Kuh-i-Gach, a high range of mountains, which are well-wooded on the higher slopes. The range derives its name from the white cliffs on its crest, which are a conspicuous object in the land scape. The western spur of this range known as the Saihtak Bala, has three salt-mines, as well as sulphur mines. A considerable export trade of sulpher is carried on. A lower spur to the east is known as the Cheha Behmishk, from the numerous springs which rise in these hills. To the south, the valley is shut in by a high range of mountains knoon as the Kuh-i-Burh or “ high- hills. ” This range is covered with forest. Its highest point is the Kuh-i-Chan-i-Shur, said to be some 9,000 or 10,000 feet high and to consist of jagged and unclimbable cliffs of salt. It throws off two big spurs ; that to the north forms the eastern boundary of the valley and is known as the Kuh-i-Badini ; that to the south forms the eastern boundary of the Dehuntal [probably the same as Dehun (&lt;/.v.)} valley, and apparently eventually merges into the lower slopes of the Kuh-i- Rudbar range to the south. Both these lower spurs of the Kuh-i-Shur are wooded. The Kuh-i-Badini gradually falls away to the north. It is crossed by the Bandar ’Abbas-Lar road at the Bazan pass, so called from its sinister reputation for raids, from the Sarhad mountains to the east. To the east of Karmusteh is an isolated range of salt, about three miles long, and known as the Siahtak-i-Zar. Both sulpher and salt are Worked from this range. The road from Badini to Karmusteh is said to be fit for wheeled artillery. There are no villages en route for the first 15 miles, but shortly after passing the karizes of Birkeh Gilu the outskirts of the Karmusteh cultivation are reached. Karmusteh is dwindling in importance owing to its exposure to raids^ The inhabitants used to own about 500 camels, but Owing to raids, the majority of camels have been taken elsewhere. The valley has outlets to the west via Hormuz and Zuruvan and to the north-west via the Sanikhud pass to Lar. All these villages north of the Kuk-i Burh acknowledge Saiyid Haji Baba of Lar as their head. The 2 o 2514 KAR-KAR latter was called in from Bairami, 4 marches north of Lar, where he was the local kaldntdr, to take over charge of Lar. This happened four months ago (about September 1910), but the whole district has paid no taxes to Persia for over two years. The inhab tants of Karmusteh are Saiyids and Rais (?). Kaldntdr (1910) Mulla Abdullah. Two passes lead over the Kuh-i-Burh to the south :— (a) Over the Parun Pattar Kutal (where there is a caravanserai and cistern) to Tudru [perhaps the same as Tudiran (q.v.)) and thence to Bastak by the Hormuz-Bastak road. This road from Karmusteh to Tudru is a camel track. , t ■, ,i (b) Another route leads via the Sar-i-Kuh Kutal and Ganda, and thence to the Bandar ’Abbas-Lar road. As far as Ganda, however, it is only a mule track. i The villagers from Anveh to Ganda, south of the Kuh-i-Burh, acknow ledge Saiyid Ishaq of Dehuntal as their head. Under him Muhammad Amin is Kaldntdr of Anveh.— (Onm/wrd., 1911 from native information.) KARMUSTEH VILLAGE— Some 300 well-built houses. A fort in disrepair. It is dwindling in importance, owing to mids.-(Craufurd, 1911, from native information.) KARRAPl KUH— Lat. Long. Elev. A range in the Pusht-i-Kuh district of Luristan, traversed about 14 miles from Deh Bala on the road to Kut-ul-’Amareh, by the Karrapi Pass, at an elevation of 5,840 feet. The portion to the north-west is known as the Shanachir, and that to the south-east as the Karrapi range. It is the outer range of the Pusht-i-Kuh, the hills lying below being small offshoots of it. The Tigris and the plain are visible in the distance from the pass.—(Mmm- sell, 1888.) KARRI— Lat. 28° 27 ‘ N. ; Long. 51° 12 ’ E. ; Elev. The most southern village of the Tangistan district of Ears. It is situated on the coast 6 miles south-south-east of Bulkhair and contains 100 houses The inhabitants grow wheat, barley and dates, and own four cargo and fishing-boats. The village belongs to the Baraki group {q.v.).— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) KARUN (River)— In the Survey of India Sheets 71 and 72 of south-west Asia, the Karun is shown as making a long semi-circle to the south. There is no such bend really.— (Scott, 1910.) . . , This is the largest and only navigable river in Persia. It rises Irom tne western spurs of the Kuh-i-Rang or Jaihun in the heart of the Bakhtian country, about 100 miles due west of Isfahan. Its course is south-easterly for 75 miles. Within the first 20 miles of its course it skirts the flat col of Galgushak, which is a divide between this river and the Zindeh Rud. It is at this post, which is known as the Kar-Kunan (q.v.) or “ The Workers, ^ that the earlier Safavi Kings designed to divert waters of the Karun into the Zindeh Rud, by tunnelling through this col. This project was initiated y Shah Tahm Asp ; and later carried on by ’Abbas the Great, who abandone the idea of a tunnel for a cutting through the mountains. Both these anKAR—KAR 515 olher attempts, however met with failure : though it is evident that modern engineering would accomplish it without difficulty by dams and tunnels. It is further unlikely, looking to the volume of the water in the Karun, and the numerous tributaries by which it is subsequently fed, that the river level would be lowered one inch thereby at Shushtar. Leaving the Galgushak the stream, a few miles further on, enters the Dirigan valley, in which it is increased by the waters of the two remarkable springs of Marbarreh and Kulungchl. The former appears, from the foot of the Zardeh Kuh on the right, as a river some 20 feet wide and 3 to 4 feet deep. Th s stream runs a course of 12 miles before joining the Karun. Continuing, the river enters the Binisgun valley at 40 miles; and shortly after cuts its way for 3 or 4 miles between the Kuh-i-Kaisari (10,500 feet), on the right and the Kuh-i-Luisi (11,000 feet), on the left, whose respective peaks are not 2 miles apart. This gorge, known as the Tang-i-Kaisarf, presents in many parts a sheer wall of 4,000 to 5,000 feet in height. Emerging into the valley below, it receives the waters of two streams, called the Duab, from the right and rising from the Kuh-i-Chari. Two miles below this point it is crossed by a temporary wooden bridge, of a span of 50 feet and a narrow footway 6 feet in breadth called the Pul-i- All-Kuh ; although the village of the same name is some 3£ miles farther down stream. Again at Rustami, 6 miles below, it is crossed by a temporary wooden structure, near the remains of a large and ancient stone bridge, and just below which it is fed by the fine spring of Sard Ab. This spring gushes out of the rocks J mile away and pours as a foaming torrent straight into the Karun. Five miles lower it is crossed by a stone and mortar bridge at the village of Kaj (6,010 feet). This is a structure of one pointed arch built of stone and mortar. Four miles beyond, and after a course of some 75 miles, it meets the Ab-i- Behishtabad. This considerable stream, which represents the drainage ol the whole of the Chehar Mahali plateau, has several sources. Its three principal sources are the Ab-i-Junaqan, the Ab-i-Jehan-bin and the Ab-i- Shalamzar. All three unite before the stream enters the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash, at the south-west extremity of that plateau. In forcing its way through this remarkable ravine it falls 600 feet in a course of 6 miles ; and passes under the bridge at its exit from the gorge just above the village of Behistabad. This structure is also of one pointed arch with a 30-foot span and is of stone and mortar. Two miles farther down it runs into the Karun, of which it is considered to be one of its main sources, both having run an almost equal course of about 75 miles to this point. The united waters now form a river which represents the drainage of 8,000 square miles of country, and which is unfordable at any point beyond this. The river now takes a general southerly course and shortly rushes through another deep rift, some 10 miles long, with almost perpendicular Walls from 1,000 to 1,500 feet high. About 3 miles above Davazdeh Imam, which is 500 feet above it on the right bank, it is crossed by a well built stone and mortar bridge (5,480 feet) of two arches. For these few miles it runs through a valley with some pasturage, but only to tear its way again through a tremendous rift, known as the Tang-i-Ardal. The whole scenery about here is one mass of stupendous surface convulsions. The river zigzag with several acute bends through erpendicular and overhanging scarped»■ 6 KAR—KAR walls of rock some 2,000 feet high. With a final bend at right angles, it points due east for a few miles and reaches the hamlet of Du Pulan (5,000 feet) after a total run of 105 miles. It passes out of the narrow, deep and gloomy gorge, under a brick bridge of a single arch, 12 yards span and with bad approaches, and is joined a few hundred yards below this bridge by another considerable affluent. This is the Ab-i-Shabz Kuh, which also rushes down past Naghan, through a great rift of the Tang-i-Siah. This stream is bridged by a pile and wicker structure opposite the village of Du Pulan and shortly before it reaches the Karun. The river now assumes a southerly course for a few miles, but later changing to south-west, it strikes through between the Kuh-i-Sard Ab on the right and the Kuh-i-Sabz Kuh on the left. At 115 miles the walls of the latter overhang it precipitously, and later, the Kuh-i-Buz Man closing in on the right bank, the river enters a defile known as the Tang-i-Agha. Continuing its course between these cliff walls, it makes another acute bend at 135 miles in a west by south-west direction ; and passes the hamlets of Sunak on the right at 142 miles and Baghak (3,600 feet), at 145 miles on the left. A small stream runs into it near the latter village. At 152 miles it receives the Ab-i-Hilisat from the north-west and 1 mile lower down the Ab-i-Rig from the south-west. Bending now slightly north of west it winds its way through deep valleys, until at 166 miles it receives one of its largest tributaries in the Ab-i-Bazuft, a little below the hamlet of Charka. The Kuh-i-Mazarim here checks its course and makes it rather conform to that of its latest feeder ; the direction now becoming almost due south to 170 miles. From here the river makes a bend again to north of west to 175 miles, where a small stream joins it from the Kuh-i-Shapir on the right. Then flowing south-west past Sir-i-Chal on the left bank, it receives a considerable addition from the Ab-i-Lurdigan, at 181 miles, from the south-east. This stream is joined by the Ab-i-Burs shortly before it runs into the Karun, and together they form a good-sized river. At this point the river makes a bend again to a little north of west and with many windings reaches the village of Shapir at 188 miles. Continuing now due north-west and flanked by the mighty Mangasht range on the left and the lesser ranges of the Kuh-Sawa, Qalandaran and Banistan on the right, it passes two ferries ; the first established a little below the Deh-i-Darkashi at 205 miles and the second 1| miles lower down. At 209 miles a stream draining the Diz valley, the Ab-i-Kukat, flows into it from the right. From this point the river makes some sharp zigzags to clear the spurs of the Zir-i-Kuh or Pa Kuh on the left ; and at 215 miles flows under the Pul-i-Gudar-i-Balutak (2,900 feet) at a bend which here makes its course north-east. For a specification of this bridge, the materials for which Messrs. Lynch Brothers brought out from Europe for the Bakhiari caravan route, vide this Gazetteer—Shalu (Pul-i-). After a short stretch the river makes a bend due north and then gradually changes its direction to north-west. It winds through deep gorges and ravines between the great Kuh-i-Safid on the right and Kuh-i-Razandan on the left. At 228 miles it passes the site of an old log bridge, while a few miles farther on it passes through a deep rift below the Kuh-i-Safid. At 235 miles the river may be said to pass beyond any accurate descrip tive knowledge. We know that it flows north-west beihind the Kub-i-51? KAR—KAR Gugird and the Kuh-i-Rashid, bounding the plain of Malamir on the north and continuing its direction north by north-west to about 265 miles, and to within a few miles west of the sources of the Ab-i-Bazuft. It is near this that a considerable stream, the Ab-i-Shallar or Shimbar, some 80 feet wide and 10 feet deep in flood time, flows into it. From this point it makes a bend to the south-west, and after a stretch of some 25 miles in this direction, makes another bend north west to a point about 15 miles due north of Shushtar. It once again comes within descriptive possibilities, when emerging from the Tang-i-Kaleh-i-Dukhtaran, north east of the plain of Ab-i-Bid. The total length of its course to this point may be taken to be approximately 375 miles. The defile through which the river now passes is some 3 miles long. On the heights above the left bank are the extensive ruins of old forts* known as the Kaleh-i-Dukhtaran. Tradition differs as to the story of these interesting ruins. One explanation given is as follows :—In order to carry out the colossal engineering works on the river which are in evidence at Shushtar, it was necessary to import large armies of workmen from distant places. Having done so it struck the astute originators of these great schemes that their enormous cost might be reduced, as far as the payment for the labour was concerned, to the bare cost of subsistence of the workmen by the provision, not only of all foodstuffs, but also of a liberal supply of the gentler sex for their enjoyment in their periods of leisure. The arrangement was so contrived that the great portion of the money paid in wages found its way back to the source from which it issued, by the exaction of exorbitant charges on the provisions supplied and a heavy toll on the earnings of the ladies. Another version is that when the Lurs descended into the plains to rape the neighbourhood, they carried away their prizes to these strongholds. Not far below its exit from the hills at Kaleh-i-Dukhtaran the Karun passes the village of Gutvand on its right bank. Here there is upon that side a fertile, alluvial plain, sloping down slightly from the west, and opposite to it the fertile plain of ’Aqili, round which the river flows in remarkable curve. This plain, which contains ten prosperous villages, is the most luxuriant and valuable land on the banks of the Karun. Every inch of it is under Wheat, barley, tobacco, cotton and other cultivation. The plain of ’Aqili, as well as a portion of the plain of Ab-Bid on the right bank, is the property of the Shahab-us-Saltaneh Ilbegi of theBakhtiari (1905). The remainder of the plain of Ab-Bid, also very fertile and valuable land, is the property of the Salar Arfa’ Bakhtiari Khan. Farther to the west and south-west almost as far as Dizful, extend the properties of the Ilkhani and others of the Bakhtiari Khans. Completing its bend in a north-east direction, the river buckles round the elbow of a range of hills on the right bank and the makes as acute bend almost due south. It shortly after receives the brackish waters of the Shur—Labahri, one of its largest tributaries, which flows into it from the left along the foot of the ridge known as the Kuh- i-Fidalak (1,200 feet). This range on the left and the lower hills on the right bank form a defile through which the river passes, until it emerges into the plain about 3 miles above Shushtar. Some 2| miles beyond518 KAR—KAR this barrier and about 600 yards above Shushtar it divides into two streams, the left branch being called the Ab-i-Gargar. The branch to the right retains its name as the Karun and on the north side of the town forms a broad sheet of water, and then, turning to the south and passing an ancient dam and bridge once known as the Band-i-Kaisar, but now called the Pul-i-Dizful (400 feet), changes its name to the Ab-i-Shatait. The Ab-i-Gargar and Ab-i-Shatait are separately described in this Gazet teer : as also the island enclosed between them, which is called the Mian-Ab. At a point 30 miles south in a direct line from Shushtar, or at 453 miles of the river’s course (reckoning by the Ab-i-Gargar), the two branches reunite with the village of Bandd-Qlr situated at the angle of their con fluence. At the point of junction the Ab-i-Diz (q.v.) from the west also adds its waters to the Karun. There is a ferry established on the Ab-i-Gargar just opposite the village of Band-i-Qir. From here on to Wais on the left bank, at 465 miles, the river is almost straight with a due southerly course. From Wais to Ahwaz (496 miles), on the left bank its general direction is south-west by south, the river making a number of bends and nearly doubling the distance between these places, as compared to that by the land route which is only 14 miles. Immediately above Ahwaz where it is now about 600 yards wide, the river is divided into two streams by the small island of Umm-an-Nakhl. On re-uniting it breaks through a ridge of sandstone hills, which here tra verses the river’s course at right angles, and in doing so forms a series of rapids. These rapids obstruct some 1| miles of the river’s course and ter minate at the lower end of another small island called Umm-us-Saba. Just below them the settlement of Bandar Nasiri Nasirleh has sprung up. From Nasirieh the general direction of the river is soutli by south-west. It makes a series of extraordinary bends as far as the tomb of ’Ali bin al Husain, which is some 40 miles in a straight line from Nasirieh, though approximately at 575 miles of the river’s course. From this point onwards its bends become less frequent and pronounced, eventually reaching the Shatt-al-’Arab at a point situated 25 to 30 miles in a direct line to the south west of ’Ali bin al Husain. At 593 miles it throws off the Salmanleh or Salmaneh canal, now almost dry, from its left bank ; and at 3 miles farther down, opposite the island of Hair, there is another outlet from the left bank called the Marid-ul-A’ma, which runs inland for about a mile and forms the mouth of the Fallahieh-Marid canal, which is supplied with water by the Jarrahi river. On the south-west bank of this creek, at f of a mile from the entrance are some heaps marking the site of the old village of Marid. A dry hollow, containing bushes at the end towards the Karun, connects the Marid-ul-A’ma with the Qanaqeh branch of Khur Musa : at one time, no doubt, the Karun discharged a part of its waters by this route of the sea. On the right bank, opposite to the Marid creek, is the site of the old Ka’b settlement of Sableh. At 607 miles the Bahmanshir channel leaves the Karun on the left bank and follows an independent course to the Persian Gulf. This channel was the main course of the Karun in former times (vide this Gazetteer, Bahman shir). Its present debouchment into the Shatt-al’Arab, 2 miles farther down at 610 miles, is called the Haffar, or canal. It was originally a small’'canal cut for irrigation purposes, but the river, finding this course more appropriate, wore down the dam which regulated its out-take of water and eventually burst through in full force, thus forming a new and more import ant channel for its final exit into the estuary. Navigability and character of banks .—From Band-i-Qlr to Ahwaz the normal width of the river is about 300 yards and ordinarily offers no obstacles to navigation, but sand banks and heaps of stones occur, and the depth of the water is sometimes insufficient. The banks vary in height from 10 feet to 30 feet, the land above them being gravelly plains ; towards Ahwaz they are of marl, the brushwood which once clothed them having mostly disappeared. The rapids of Ahwaz, though passable by towing, are a serious obstacle even to native boats, especially with a very high or very low river. The steamers Assyria and Shushan, however, ascended the rapids by steam successfully in 1842 and 1890 respectively. Bulk is commonly broken at this point, goods being conveyed by a horse tramway from Nasiri to a point a | of a mile north of Ahwaz for re-shipment. The length of the rapids is about 2,000 yards ; they are reckoned to be 5 in number and the real obstacle to navigation is the second one from the top. At this place a reef runs out from the left bank, leaving between its point and the right bank a channel only 100 yards wide, through which the water rushes with a fall of 1 in 50 ; this channel is, moreover, broken up by rocky islets into 2 or 3 passages, of which the one adjoining the right bank is the easiest of ascent, but has a width of only 50 yards. Both the reef and the islets carry masonry remains, those of a great irrigation barrage which raised the surface of the water to the level of the surrounding country. This barrage was called Shadurwan and existed in the 10th century A.D. Above the rapids the river is 400 yards broad, between them in places as much as 700 and below them only 200 to 300. Between these points the total loss of level is foot with a high river and 7 or 8 feet with a low one. From Nasirieh to Muham- mareh, a distance of about 120 miles by the river, the Karun has a normal breadth of a of a mile and flows through uncultivated plains. The banks are gt nerally low in this part of its course. In winter they are occupied by Arab encampments around which some slight and shifting cultivation is carried on, but in summer, with the exception of the permanent habitations mentioned below, they are deserted. The current varies from 4 to 5 knots in the flood season to 2 knots between August and November ; and the difference between low and high river is ordinarily only about 12 to 14 feet. The Karun, however, is liable to more violent and irregular changes of level than the great river of Mesopotamia, and there is a difference of 24 feet between the highest recorded (February 1903) and the lowest (Octo ber 1901). When the river is full it carries a brown silt and in its lower course runs level with the banks. It is at its lowest from the middle of October to the end of November, while the highest floods occur in March and April. In most parts and at ordinary seasons there is little difficulty for the safe navigation of a vessel of 5 or even 6 feet draught, but in the 20 miles immediately below Ahwaz, which is the worst reach for steamers, those of only 3| feet draught sometimes have difficulty in navigating it, when the water is low. There are ferries for crossing the river at Wais, Kut, ’Abdullah and Ghazzavieh ; but no bridges below those at Shushtarl520 KAR—KAR The sea tides are felt as far up as Isma’ilieh and lower down Cause a risie and fall of 4 to 5 feet ; but no salt water ever reaches the Karun. The average slope of the river below the Ahwaz rapids is about 5 inches in the mile. The minimum discharge has been calculated at 10,000 cubic feet a second and the flood discharge at 120,000 to 140,000. Date groves begin on the right bank at Qisbeh, 8 miles above Muharm march, while both banks for the last few miles carry fine plantations. Duck, teal, snipe, pelicans and gulls are seen on the river, while the country on its banks holds francolin, hare, wild-boar, and, it is said, some lynx and lion. Sharks travel up stream, when the water is low, to Ahwaz and even Shushtar. The difference in temperature between the Shatt-al-’Arab and the Karun is very remarkable. Lieutenant Selby found the former in the month of August to be 96°, while the latter, not 200 yards distant, was under 80°. Districts and villages .—Above Band-i-Qlr the course of the Karun lies in the Shushtar district ; the river then enters the Ahwaz district which it traverses. The next and last district on the Karun is that of Muham- mareh which begins on the right bank immediately above Sab’eh, and on the left bank just above the ruined tombs at ’AH bin al Husain.

Jurisdiction on the river banks .—To summarize the course of the Karun as described in detail above, it is seen that for the 250 miles of its career it flows through Bakhtiari territory. Though running through the wildest and most remote parts, it is in this section of its course, owing to the comparatively good government of the Khans, that it is most secure for the ordinary traveller. From 250 miles onwards until its appearance to accurate knowledge once again on the plains of Ab-i-Bid and ’Aqill, to about 375 miles, its right bank is conterminous with Luristan, while on the left is still Bakhtiari territory. This portion of its course, which may be said to be almost unexplored offers no security to life or property, as no kind of government exists within the province of Luristan. Entering now within the jurisdiction of the government of ’Arabistan, matters become slightly, though not much, improved. As far down as Wais, to which the authority of the Persian Governor of this province is reckoned to extend, consider able lawlessness prevails, and the steamer Shushan, which plies on the upper Karun and onwards up the Ab-i-Gargar, is often obliged to cease running for a month or more at a time on this account. From Wais down wards commences the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. A dis tinct improvement is attmee evident ; and, though the right bank of the river from Ahwaz downwards is temporarily somewhat insecure, on account of the operations lately undertaken by the Shaikh against the Hawlzeh Arabs, under ordinary conditions the country on either bank is comparatively safe for travellers and caravans. The right of armed vessels or boats under foreign flags to enter even the lowest reaches of the Karun is disputed by the Persian Government ; and on each occasion that a British gun-boat has anchored higher up than the British Consulate at Muhammareh, a protest has been lodged by the local representative of the Persian Foreign Office. These protests have nevei been followed by any result. 2 p 2530 KAR—KAR Steamers and native craft. —It is over sixty years since the immense latent value of the Karun trade route, as an avenue of expeditious approach to the great cities and centres of grain cultivation in the west of Persia, and as an opening, more especially for British and Anglo-Indian commerce, was first brought prominently before the notice of the British by the united labours and writings of Sir H. Layard and Lieutenant Selby. But it was not until October 1888, that by a decree of the Shah, the Karun river as far as Nasirieh was, subject to certain somewhat vexatious conditions, opened to the mercantile marine of the world. Immediately this permission was obtained, Messrs. Lynch Brothers, of the Euphrates and Tigris Stream Navigation Company, detached one of their steamers from the latter river for the Karun service ; and have continued to run a boat at intervals of a fortnight between Muhammareh ani Nasirieh ever since. The boat first employed was the Blosse Lynch, a fine paddle streamer ; but she was found to be both too long for the abrupt bends and zigzags of the river, and of too deep a draught to pass over the shoals in low water. Accord ingly she was replaced by the Shushan. The Shushan, a stern-wheeler of 100' in length, 18' beam, with a draft of 2' 11' with 30 tons of cargo : it tows a barge holding 45 tons of cargo at the same draft ; and subsequently in 1890 by the Malamir, a paddle-wheeler, a good deal larger than the Shushan and somewhat smaller than the Blosse Lynch. The Shushan was then taken up in the spring flood time above the rapids and berthed just above Ahwaz. By a free gift of this boat to the Shah’s Government, Messrs. Lynch Brothers were enabled to override the difficulty of the embargo against the navigation of the waters of the upper Karun by foreign stean e^s ; and they run the vessel on behalf of the Persian Government all the year round as far as Shalaili, a point about 8 miles below Shushtar on the Ab-i-Gargar. She has been run ever since under the Persian Flag and Messrs. Lynch Brothers have a claim amounting to some krans 1,821,681 cents 33 against the Persian Government in respect of losses said to have been incurred in the running of the vessel from 1890 to 190», when stimulated apparently by competition with the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s steamer it began to pay its own way. The draught of this steamer is no more than 2 feet 11 inches ; and even so, she experiences considerable difficulty in navigating the Gargar in the dry season. A considerable number of native craft, mostly of the type locally known as mahaihlas, and varying from 5 to 70 tons in burden, ply for trade on the river. They are wedge-shape with a raking prow, flat bottoms and a raised open door for the accommodation of the crew. The mast, placed somewhat forward, has a list forwards and carries one expansive lateen sail. When the wind is unfavourable they require to be tow^ed on the journey up stream. This is an extremely laborious process, especially when the current of the river runs strong, as the banks in most of its reaches are quite unsuitable for this work. A boat 90 feet long, 20 feet wdde, carries 70 tons and draws 7 feet 3 inches. Besides these larger crafts a small boat, hallam, worked by paddles, as well as by towing is much in evidence especially in the neighbourhood of Muhammareh. They run from 16 to 20 feet in length and from 3 to 4 feet in breadth. A somewhat heavier and deeper ty r pe of the same craft isKAR—KAR 531 used for the ferries at the different places, where they exist. At the ferries in the higher stretches of the river, above Shushtar, boats are not used owing to the rush of water. In their place kiliks, or rafts on air bladders, are found safer : these rafts will bear some dozen human beings, besides a fair quantity of baggage. The Mu’in-ut-Tujjar’s steamer, the Nasrat, has recently (1907) arrived on the lower river ; it has been secretly helped by the HajI Rais, and has taken away, up to the present, the bulk of the passenger traffic from the Malamir. There has been plenty of cargo for both boats. The Nasrat appears to be tolerably well run and is on the whole giving satisfaction to the people of the place. Particulars of the Nasrat are as follows :—• Stem wheeler. Length over all approximately ....... 122' Between perpendiculars . . .... 106' Beam ....... 0 .. . 20' Capacity 55tons. Plus 45 tons on a barge hired from the Rais-ut-Tujjar. Passengers about ...... ,. 100 Draft with 45 tons ......... 2' 9' The captain is a Baghdadi Christian. The crew, with the exception of a few Baghdadis, are Arabs. She moors at a wharf a little below the custom house, at the end-of the tram-line. There is also (1913) on the upper river. The Ma’win a twin screw steamer of about the same size as the Shushan owmed by the Mu’in-ut-Tujjar, the moving spirit if not the whole embodi ment of the Nasiri Company, which has the concession for the navigation of the Upper Karun. In addition to the Shushan and Ma’win, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have a motor launch and three barges in use on the Upper Karun between Ahwaz and Darreh Khazineh, whence a road runs to the Bakhtiari Oil Fields. Trade .—The trade of the Karun river is dependent in great degree on the success of the harvest in the North ’Arabistan ; as well as the action of the Persian Government in regard to the embargo on the exporation of wheat. Its imposition appears to be exercised with no regard to the prosperity of the inhabitants, but rather to the advantage of the local Government and officials. A good harvest with no embargo on the exportation of grain, although the duty imposed is heavy, causes increased prosperity to the inhabitants, and permits of larger dealings in imported goods. Irrigation and other works. —The great dyke at Ahwaz, the massive remains of which are still existent, is commonly attributed to the Sassanian monarchs. It was designed to hold up the waters of the Kartin, which were then diffused by means of ditches and canals through the surrounding country, at that time and for long after renowned for its rich plantations of sugar-cane. The ruins of the dams, upon which it is likely that, as at Shush tar, there may have been superimposed a bridge, survive in the shape of big masses of masonry, still held together by an indestructible cementjJ ■■BHHHHHBHii 1 i2 KAR—KAR Tliere yet remains sufficient of these works to show the effect they must have had on the prosperity of the country, as compared to the present day when it can only be described as a howling wilderness. Various schemes have been set in motion to revive these irrigation works : the last so late as the year 1905, when a Dutch Engineer, M. van Rogen, was deputed by the Persian Government with this object. Major Morton, R.E., was deputed by the Indian Government to examine and report upon this scheme, which he did, condemning it unreservedly on the grounds of its cost and the impossibility of its ever becoming a paying concern. No further really serious plans have been devised, nor have matters definitely shaped themselves in any way. The same comment applies in regard to schemes put forward for the improvement of the navigation of the river. As noted above, it is at Nasirleh that the principal obstacle is encountered, and it is necessary to break bulk between that place and Ahwaz, 2 miles above. A light horse tramway at present assist in the transfer of cargo between these two points, which can not be other than a most laborious process*. To overcome this difficulty the best suggestion is that made in Captain Wells’ repbrt who visited the spot in 1881 and carefully examined the obstruction, as well as the river above it. In his opinion, to merely open a passage through the rapids, which could be easily effected-by blasting would do more harm than good, owing to the difference in level between the Upper and Lower Karun. This fall is estimated to be between 8 and 10 feet. His suggestion is that locks should be built, two of which would be required to control the waters properly. It would not be necessary to excavate more than 25 feet at any part, to obtain a canal even 8 feet deep : and as this canal would run for the most part of it required length (2,350 yards) through the sandstone, the walls of this formation would be of the greatest benefit to the work and materially lower the cost of the undertaking. The political value of this work, as well as the clearing away of the obstacles which are met with in the Ab-i-Gargar and Ab-i-Shatait, and which prevent them from being made full use of would be very great. If signifies the possibility of bringing troops within 200 miles of some of the most important towns in Persia. From a commercial point of view it would appear to be the only method of successful competition with Russian trade from the north.— (Kinneir — Chesney — Layard — Selby Rau- fanson — Champain — Wells — Ross — Robertson — Thomson — Sawyer — Curzon— Persian Gulf Gazetteer — Arbuthnot, 1905 — Lorimer — Gray, 1913.)

KASHGAN RUD— A river in Luristan—formed by what remains of the Alishtar rivers, after they have supplied all the water needed for cultivation, joining at the southern end of Alishtar the river Kaka Riza, the united waters then taking the name of the Kashgan Rud. It is stated to rise in two branches on the Kuh-i-Chehil—Na Balighan, some distance north of Khurramabad and in the plain of Kuh Dasht. It runs through the difficult defile of Tang-i- Gav Shumar, the general direction being south through the town of Madian Rud to Pul-i-Dukhtar. Where crossed on the Khurramabad—Deh Bala road 26 miles from the former place (elev. 3,350 feet), it flows south-east through a broad valley, wooded and grassy. The banks are lined with grassy plateaux, the bed broad, of sand and stones, and wooded with tamarisk. The hills, well wooded and grassy, rise gently to the north-east, more abrupt ly above the right bank of the stream. The river has a stream of whitish water with a strong current : the banks are shelving of pebbles and sand ; the bottom is of loose, round stones affording an insecure foothold. The width of water is 40 yards with a maximum depth of 2 feet 6 inches. It is joined by the united streams of Khurramabad, Karun and Tain or Tian. This latter river, according to General Schindler, is formed by the junction of the Rizan and Kip):an rivers in the Chimashk gorge, between Shah-in-shah and Chimashk. Rabino gives the name of this river as Chulv-e-Hul, and says that it is formed by two streams, one from the mahal of Rikan, running west to east and the other running west of Kaleh Chimashk, the two uniting at 100 paces from Kaleh Chimashk. After receiving the tribute of these confluents, the Kashgan runs south west through the plain of Jaidar and over a number of precipices form ing a succession of magnificent cataracts as it struggles through the outer rampart of the Zagros into the valley of the Karkheh, some thousand feet below the hills about 1 mile above Pul-hGovmishan, after a course of some 106 miles. Just below the gorge, through which it enters the plain of534 KAS—KAS : Jaidar, the river spreads mifc and divides itself into two arms, thus admitting of being forded except during a few months in the spring, when its waters are unusually swollen by the melting of the snows. The rapidity of its stream makes it difficult to ford, and Lieutenant Wilson found it quite unfordable at Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dukhtar in June 1911, and only fordable with difficulty at Pul-i-Kashgan. When Rawlinson visited it in Febuary, the stream, though very rapid, was not more than 3 feet deep. Rawlinson also says that it is crossed 7 miles from the village of Rabat (14 miles from Khurramabad on the road thence to Kirmanshah) at a point where it divides into a number of narrow branches by Illdt bridges of woven boughs. Higher up on the direct road from Khurramabad to Kirmansl ah, says the same authority, it is crossed by the Pul-i-Kashgan, a magnificent Sassanian bridge now in ruins. The Pul-i-Kashgan is described as follows by (De Morgan) :—A superb ruined Arab bridge, which the Persians have several times clumsily tried to repair without the least success. Formerly this bridge bore a Kufic inscription, giving the date of construction : the stone which bore the inscription has now fallen and is much worn. Down stream are the remains of two other smaller and older bridges, one of which recalls the Zish bridge, and is probalby Sassanian : it is most carefully built, the base being of cut stone with boulders at the top : up and down stream the arches are protected by buttresses. The main bridge is several hundred yards long, 60' high, and consists of 14 large arches, and a number of smaller ones. The Pul-i- Kalhur, in the Kashgan gorge, is a smaller bridge, where the river narrows between walls of rock. The Kashgan is also called the Madian Rud ; and it is probable that one or the other name applies to certain distinct parts of its course which are at present not clearly definable.— (Rawlinson — Burton, September, 1897 — Rabino, 1905.) KASHKULT— A tribe of the Qashqai of Fars. This tribe, in numbers third in importance among the Qashqai is in influence at present (1912) the second or even the first. The Khans of the Kashkuh estimate the number of tents at about 5,000, and the number of armed tribesmen at 2,000 to 3,000. The chief of the tribe was said to main- train in 1912, about 400 road guards. They are extensive agriculturists both in their summer and winter quarters. The former are fh the Kuh-i-Mihr and Kakan, the latter all round the Mehlatun hills. The Kashkfills were originally a Fars tribe pure and simple, i.e., their winter haunts were in what they call “ Fars, ” between Jahrum and Lar : their rise in importance among the Qashqais dates from early in the 19th century. Some families of the Zend tribe (to which Karim Khan belonged) migrated or fled from the Kirmanshah district, and settled with the Qashqai. One of these families soon attained to leadership among the Kashkfilis, and formed matrimonial alliances with Jani Khan, the Ilkhani, and his family. The most noted of these Zand or Kashkfili Khans was Qasim Khan, who died in the year of the British war. He was respon sible for the branch finding a new habitat in the mountains from Shapfir to HaTat Dafid, for the Kashkfilis and Qashqais had not spread to .thatKAS—KAT 535 54-2, side before. The descendants of his brother Haji ’Abbas ’Ali are still settled in the direction of Gallehdar and Qir and Karzln, and the tribe is apparently known not as Kashkull, but as (Afshar) Kirmani. All Kashkulis meet round the Kuh-i-Mihr (Qumeir) in the summer. Qasim Khan and his brothers had a numerous progeny, so that the Khans say that of their grandfathers’ descendants they can muster a hundred riflemen. The late Ilyas Khan was famed throughout southern Persia for his extra- oridnary strength. The Ilkhani, Saulat-ud-Dauleh, is not only the son of a Kashkuli mother, but he is married to a daughter of Haji ’Abdullah Khan, nephew of Qasim Khan : his wife’s sister is married to Haidar ’Ali Khan Kashkull, brother of Muhammad ’Ali Khan. Like the Ilbegi, Saulat-us-Sultaneh, some of the younger Kashkuli Khans have begun to take lessons in English. Owing to the character and warlike qualities of Muhammad ’Ali Khan and Muhammad Beg, 1 he Kashkulis have acquired great importance. There is usually enmity between the two sections, led by the brothers, but they once joined to oppose Saulat-ud-Dauleh. The Kashkfilis are said to breed mules, of which they own 400.

The village of Kavar is surrounded by orchards and a cluster of small villages. The grazing is reported to be fair. The whole plain is under cultivation. Wood is largely cut in the hills round and sold in Shiraz. The boundaries of the district are to the north Sarvistan, to the E. Khafr, to the S. Khwajai, to the W. Siakh and Shiraz. The estimated population is 2,500. The district is not inhabited by nomad tribes and has hitherto been but little subject to their raids.— {Wil son, 1911.) KAYARUKH, see QEHFARUKH. KAWAMIL— A section of implanted Arabs of the Ka’b tribe {q.v.). KAZARUN— Lat. 29° 37' ; Long. 51° 43' ; Elev. 2,800'. A town and plain in Ears, 95 miles north of Bushire, situated in a valley 30 miles long and 4 broad. The drainage of the valley flows into the Famur lake on the south-east of the valley. The town is divided into the upper {Bald) and lower {Pain) and covers a considerable space. The buildings are of stone and mortar and have an appearance of solidity and neatness which is wanting is mud habitations : they are also frequently stuccoed. Many of them are fortified, possessing parapets and loop-holes for musketeers. Excepting in size, the place hardly deserves the name of a town, as it is, more properly speaking a conjunction of two large villages and possesses only about a hundred shops. The situation is on the north-west side of a well cultivated vale on a slight rise. Palms and walnut, orange and lemon trees are nearly the only verdure it possesses.amKAZ—KAZ 537 There is nothing of interest to be seen in the place, except the anti quities which are to be found on the hills behind the town. They consist of some traces of an old fort and an empty cistern which supplied the fort with water. The town suffered severely in the famine of 1879-80. The qandt, on which the water-supply depends, dried up, many people died and many more had to leave and seek work and food in Bushire and Shiraz. There is an office of the Indo-European Telegraph Department here, open for international traffic, as well as a telegraph office of the Persian administration. Population .— The population is variously stated at 4,000 souls and 1,500 to 2,OCX) families. Stack in 1881 estimated the number of inhabitants of Kazarun at 8,000 ; in 1889 Curzon estimated the population at between 2,000 and 2,500 ; Newcomen in 1905 said the population was 5,000 to 6,000 and Gibbon in 1908 said there were 1,200 houses. Chick gives it at 12,000 in 1912. The total population of the valley is about 20,000 souls and is well armed. They are quick-tempered and are always fighting each other. Supplies and Resources .— Excellent opium is produced in the villages around abtained from the white poppy. The people are proud of their orange gardens, but the oranges are either sour or bitter ; great attention is given to the cultivation of the poppy. Pro visions are abundant here, except in spring,, and the valley abounds in forage ; it is said to be very healthy except in the autumn months. Water is supplied principally from qandts, It is noteworthy that Kazarun is the home of many muleteers engaged on the Bushire-Shiraz road. Fire wood can be procured. Warm felts, coarse carpets, hair ropes for draught cattle, pack saddles for draught cattle and an easy shoe for hill marching form the manufactures of the place. Blacksmiths, farriers, leather-dressers and tent-makers are to be found here and in the vicinity. Timber, called safiddr, which is a white poplar, plane and walnut trees, are procurable. Saltpetre is found in the neighbourhood and powder might be made here with little labour. Snow is collected in the mountains to the north-east of the town and brought down for use in summer. Towards the Shahpur end of the valley are rice swamps and a large amount of rice is imported from Khuzistan and the Mama&amp;sam district. Mules and horses of a good stamp could be bought during the cold weather from nomad tribes and a few are often available in the town itself. The revenue of Kazarun is chiefly in kind, some 700,000 lbs of grain being taken by the Divan. The village of Dawun is formed to the Parsi bankers Jamshidian. The district of Kazarun pays 25,000 Tumdns mdlidt per annum. The place would form a suitable base for a force advancing against Shiraz from Bushire. Camel grazing scarce : 3,000 men and animals would find food for a month at least. Climate. —Warmer than Shiraz in summer, but not oppressively hot. The Government of Kazarun has been for the past few years entrusted to Khans of Qashqai clans or to underlings of the Governor-General and the llkhdni ; these, however, change constantly and the permanent ruler of the town is Khwajeh ’Abdullah. Nasir-ud-Diwan, hereditary Kaldntar, brother538 KAZ—KAZ of the late Khwajeh Ibrahim. Three generations ago this family emigrated from the Khwajeh family of the Haft Long branch of the Bakhtiaris. He is connected by marriage with the Sadar-i-Naidun. The village of the Shahpur end of the valley are in the hands of the Kashkull Khans, who encamp on the banks above the Shahpur river, spring and autumn. Similarly the caravansarai Khwajeh Ibrahim, off the end of the Tang-i-Turkan, is occupied by Kashkull tribesmen and others. Daris is a large village with some 100 tufangchis ruled by Darodar Rajab. Pul-i-Abgineh is in the independent control of Muhammad Isma’il Khan, its Kadkhudd, who is a near relation of the Kadkhuda of Kaluni in the Dasht-i-Barm. The Kunja’-i-Khamseh were owned by the Imam Juma of Shiraz, but the Kashkuli and Farsimaidan Khans forcibly took posses sion of them in the autumn of 1911.

Sweet water is contained in 17 large reservoirs and brackish water is a dozen wells. Hills called Kuh-i-Dumdumdeh, one mile to the north-west, yield lime ; and 3 miles to westward in a spur of the higher mountains which is called Kuh Ma’dan, are deposits of sulphur in con junction with gypsum and a hot, sulphurous spring.

The shipping of Khamir consists of 4 ghunchehs and 22 baqdrehs, some of which run as far as Basrah and even to Indian ports. Exports are fish, lime in large qantities, mill-stones and a little sulphur, but the trade in sulphur has ceased to be remunerative under the expensive method employed ; firewood is also sent to the towns of Trucial ’Oman and to Bahrain. Khamir belongs properly to the Bastak district, but it is under the poli tical supervision of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and the local adminis tration is carried on by a Kalantar appointed the MuTn-ut-Tujjar of Tehran, who is revenue-lessee of Khamir and its dependencies.

It consists of 200 houses on the banks of a fine stream, which is here a tributary of the Kara Aghach river.' The latter river is some 5 miles distant, and is crossed by a stone bridge. 2,000 mules would find bhusd and barley here daily, 500 mules on an average are said to halt here every day. Firewood is plentiful and the water of the stream is excellent. There are two caravanserai here ; one in a white quadrilateral built about 1860 by the Mushir-ul-Mulk, Yazir of Fars. Felly thinks this the most suitable spot between Bushire and Shiraz for the cantonment of European troops, as it is some 100 feet higher than Shiraz and the situation is open and well- watered. The small plain on which it is situated is mostly cultivated and enclosed on every side by low hills. From 5,000 to 8,000 men might easily encamp on the plain and along the banks of the river, the bed of which is broad and full of jungle. Taylor mentions that in May there was ice at this place. For medical considerations, vide this Gazetteer —Shiraz. On the road between here and Shiraz, Corporal Collins,. R. E., with his wife and attendants was attacked by a band of robbers and killed in 1871, but not before the Corporal had accounted for 2 or 3 of his assilants.

A considerable island in the Persian Gulf ; its south-eastern point is 34 miles west-north-west of Bushire town, and 2| miles north of it begins the smaller island of Khargu. Kharag is over 4 miles in length from north to south, and its average breadth is about 2 miles. The greater part of the island consists of almost barren, table-topped hills, highest in the middle and at the south end where they exceed 25 feet ; northwards they decrease in elevation and terminate in cliffs only 20 to 30 feet high. The only low grouped is a plain, about 1 square mile in extent, which forms a protuberance on the north-east side of the island, carrying at its extremity the only village on the island and the remains of a Dutch fort. The low part of the island possesses a sandy soil, mixed with particles of disintegrated rock, and capable, when irrigated, of producing crops. About 100 acres are thus employed by the inhabitants, and during the cold season upwards of 500 are cultivated ; when the rains fall, the soil, though meagre, is capable of great improve ment. The breach is of small breadth and rises somewhat abruptly from the sea, whose bottom is covered with coral rocks. The island is surrounded by a reef about \ a mile broad : the best anchorages and landings are off the village, but they are exposed, and the holding-ground is rocky and indifferent. In the interior of the island are some caves which are possibly prehis toric places of sepulture. They were originally divided into recesses by three partitions of living rock, which were grooved for the reception of four tiers of shelves, but they are now used as cattle-pens, and the old work is much defaced. A Muhammadan shrine of Mir Muhammad, also in the interior, appears to have been in existence for more than 600 years and is still a place of pilgrimage. Climate .—The climate of Kharag has always been deemed very salubrious, it is like that of Bahrain, but is cooler in summer. The atmosphere is less moist than that of Bushire. The maximum range of the thermometer in the hot season is seldom above 9o in tents and by the use of tatties it can be kept down to 75 . Population, supplies and resources .—The village consists of 120 houses and the inhabitants are degenerate Arabs, talking a mixture of Persian and Arabic who describe themselves as originally from the island of Qais, from Kaleh Giilabl and from Hajari: they are all Sunni Muhammadans except those from Kaleh Gulabi, who are Shi ahs and compose about gth of the population. In character the Kharakis are quiet and unwarlike, but they possess a few Martini rifles. The people are mostly pearl-divers and pilots, but a little agriculture is carried on. There are 1,500 date trees and some wheat and barley are grown. Irrigation is partly from springs, of which there are four large and three small, and some old (jandts exist , there are also wells of good water close to the beach, and on these the drinking supply prin cipally depends. The inhabitants possess 50 donkeys, 50 cattle and about550 KHA—KHA 500 sheep and some goats. Provisions, however, are mostly imported from Bush ire. Turtles have been caught on the breach, and fish are plenti ful. There are a few wild gazelle in the hills of the island. The wood on the island is sufficient to afford a supply of fuel which is therefore imported. Pearl banks occur between Kharag and Khargu, and also on the west side of Kharak to a considerable distance from the shore. The earnings of the people as pilots are considerable; they are employed by steamers from the United Kingdom proceeding to Basrah, and Its. 140 is paid as pilotage for the voyage and return voyage. The people of Kharag also go to the Arabian coast for pearl-diving, and since 1901 pearling operations have been prosecuted with success on tie reef of the island itself. The number of divers on the Kharag reef con tinued increasing until 1903, in which year Kharag pearls to the value of Rs. 12,500 were sold to Bahrain merchants. In 1904, however, the value of the take declined to half of what it was in the previous year. The Kharag pearls are said to excel those from the banks about Bahrain in colour and lustre. Administration. —The 'sland is subject to the Khan of the Haiat Baud district, who is represented on the spot by his kail or deputy, at present (1905) his own cousin Mirza Husain Khan. Taxation appears to be heavy. It is reported that a poll-tax of 2 tumdns yearly is levied by the Khan on every male adult, besides which he takes the greater part of the pilotage fees and £th of the pearls obtained by divers. The Persian Imperial Customs have recently emulated his example in making the most of the island by posting an official of the department on it. No import duties are at present collected, but exports are taxed in the same manner as elsewhere.— (Oliver — Malcolm — Morier — Wilson — Taylor — Bracks — Winchester — Fontanier — Con stable — Stifle—Persian Gulf Pilot — Curzon, 1889 — Persian Gulf Gezetteer, 1908.) KHARAJl — Lat. 32° 6' N. ; Long. 50'x55‘ E. ; Elev. 6,500'. A large village in the Chehar Mahal district of the Bakhtiari country, situ ated on the right bank of the Jehan-bin river and at the south-east end of the Jehan-bin mountain. It is the fourth stage from Isfahan (71 miles) on the Bakhtiari caravan road. It is a prosperous village of about 150 houses with considerable cultivation surrounding it, and a population of some 700 souls. It is the residence of Nazir Khan, the Saram-ul-Mulk, joint governor of the Chehar Mahal. The river, a sluggish and muddy stream, lined with willows, is crossed at the southern extremity of the village by a bridge of brick on stone buttresses. The dimensions of the bridge are 10 pointed arches of 7| foot span each roadway 11J feet broad between low parapets, length of the bridge 50 yards, with made approaches on either side for 120 yards. The bridge is strongly built, but the approaches are in bad repair. It can be crossed by carriages. There are weeks in winter of flood, 12 feet above the lowest autumn level. The river is then a deep and dangerous torrent and the bridge unapproachable. The river valley is of deep alluvial soil and well cultivated. There is one mill. The banks of the river near the village are thickly lined with willows and some poplars. The stream is deep and muddy and fordable only just below the bridge. The banks are deep cut and unsound. ThereKHA—KHA 551 are large flock of sheep and cattle. Wheat, barley and much poppy are cultivated, and the opium manufactured is valued at a higher rate than tnat of Isfahan. Supplies of all kinds are obtainable in plenty and water from the river is abundant. T1 e vibage belongs to the Cha b-us-Saltaneh. 48,000 lbs, of grain are sov n yearly. Taxes 9,000 krdns.

Pass ing still-up-stream, over the bouldery and sandy strip of land between the two arms of the river, the Chaujehan branch is forded ; it is shallow, with a bouldery bottom ; width 200 feet ; its left bank is steep and 100 feet high. The tw r o branches join at 1 mile in a direction of 325°, to form the Ab-i- Khirsan ; the general line of the ualiey of the rivers is here 175 £ and 280'.” — {Bell.) According to Bell’s map the Khirsan appears to fall into the Karun, a few miles from Hilisat. KHISHT (1)— Name of a river and district in Ears, reached on the road from Bushire to Shiraz by Kazarun, after the ascent of the Kutal Mallu pass.

IKHI—RHI 557-&gt; RHISHT (2)—Lat: 29° 33' N.; Long. 51° 25' E. •; Elev. about 1,800.' A plain in Ears, situated about two-tbirds of the way from Shiraz to Bushire at the head of Rutal-bMalu. It is a plain of an irregular oval shapfe, some 10 miles long by 5 miles broad, and surrounded by hills except at the point where it overlooks the pass. A river winds down through the hdls past the rums of Shahpur, and, bearing that name enters the plain of Khisht in a fine, drinkable stream on its eastern side, and, keeping close be ow th6 hills which skirt the plain on its east and north sides, passes below the town and fort of Rhisht, and finally descends, to the Gulf far to the north of the Beh behan and Shushtar line. Numerous water-ducts have been cut across the plain leading from the river-bed, and this portion of the plain is well cultivated with wheat, barley, rice, tobacco and cotton - it contains also extensive date groves, perhaps upwards of 2,000 date trees may be found The plain is further dotted with old stumps of trees and brushwood. In the centre of the plain and on the high road is the group of hamlets called Runar Takhteh. There are some 31 villages or hamlets subordinate to Rhisht, which is considered as a revenue division. The following is a list of them with their distances from the fort of Rhisht : North. Miles from fort. East. Miles from fort. West. Miles from fort.

The produce of the country no requi ed for home consumption is either consumed by passing caravans or is exported to Razarun or Bushire. The imports are piece-goods, sugar and coffee for home use The revenue, amounting to 7,000 tumdns, is levied in the lumn The safety of the road traffic is provided for by the chief of thp rli f • who maintains 50 irregular footmen for that purpose. The chief is respomsible for all goods lost or plundered from caravans within his district, and charges a sort of transit due of 25 cents per krdn on every load of piece-goods, and 124 cents on every load of miscellaneous merchandise. Colonel Pelly is of opinion that English troops could not summer in tents or huts at Khisht without suffering. He passed two days in the serai during July and two days in the early part of September ; during both periods a fircely hot wind blew all day. In July the thermometer was at 96° in the early morning and about 110° in the heat of the day. The Frenchman, Petisdela Croix, in 1674 found it so hot that he spent the whole day lying in the river.

It is about 35 miles in length, running in a general south-easterly direction from the town of Buzieh to Khur Vasteh. At Buzieh which stands upon both banks the creek is spanned by a bridge of date-tree logs: two or three villages occur upon its right bank in the 8 miles next below Buzieh. The right bank is occupied by the A1 Bu ’Abadj and A1 Bu Dahaleh sections of the Ka’b Arabs, and the left bank of the A1 Bu Hammadi section of the same tribe. The latitude and longitude given were those of the entrance about 1884, at which time there was one fathom of water at the entrance in low water, and 3 and 4 fathoms inside. Both the bearings and the depth of the water have since then probably varied.— (Bracks—Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) KHURDEH ISMA’IL— Lat. Long. Elev.

It is formed by the island of Abbadan on the west, and ’Ali Maidan on the east ; has soundings from 15 and 18 fathoms in the southern part to 2| at low water at the upper, where a narrow channel runs into the Euphrates. This is an excellent mark, coming from the eastward, for making the river. If you cross the ’All Maidan in 3 2 fathoms low water, you will cross Khur Khafgan in 8 or 9 fathoms, and ought to keep down to the southward a little, as this is in the parallel of the Maiyu- neh(?) If you cross the ’Ali Maidan in 4 or 4| fathoms, which is the best line, you will cross Khur Khafgah in 13 to 15 or 16 fathoms, according to the time of tide, and the toil of the ’Abbadan in 4 to 5 fathoms, when a course west, if a flood tide, will bring you on the ’Abdullah bank, 2| or 3 fathoms lowKHO—KHU 561 water, which is a fair berth for anchoring if the tide is not favourable for entering the river, as from this you can always run into Khur ’Abdullah if it conies to blow hard from the south-east, at which time no pilot will cross the bar.— (BrucJcs.)

The principal town of the Dashti district of the Persian coast of Ears ; i is situated at an elevation of 465 feet, nearly 20 miles from the sea at the* toot ot the great maritime range, and is distant 40 miles south-east from tfusflire town and 17 miles south-south-east of Ahram, the capital of the r ^ an ^ S ^ n C ^ S ^ C ^* The present town is adjoining by traces of an older one, which was destroyed by the Persian Governor of Shiraz at the beginning of the 19th century. Ihe place, which has doubled in size during the last 40 years consists of about 3o0 houses, of which one-third are mat huts and the remainder of mud and stone. The population numbers about 500 souls. On the out skirts of the town is a substantial stone fort, the residence of the Khan of ashti, which internally, in 1865, was comfortable and elegantly furnished, mere are water-mi Us driven by a small stream from the high hills behind the* town, and water for irrigation is brought from the same quarter in open chan- eis. Ihe water is good and grazing excellent. Barley and wheat are plenti- 5 mutt011 and beef are procurable, though not in large quantities. Routes 2 r 2562 KHt—KHU, from Bushire town, Kaki and the sea-coast meet at Khurmuj. Six miles north-east of the town is the lofty peak Kuh-i-Khurmuj which forms a good landmark. Khurmuj is the third stage on the main Bushire-Bandar ’Abbas road, and has good camping-grounds. (Hdjl Mirza Saiyid Hasan — St. John — Butcher, 1888—Persian Gulf Gazet teer, 1908.) KHUR MUSA (1)—Lat. Long. Elev. One of the five towns forming the town of Mahriz (q.v.). — [Vaughan, 1890.) KHAR MUSA (2)— A remarkable inlet of the sea, which leaves the Persian Gulf at its northern extremity to the east of the Shatt-al-’Arab, and affords easy access to Buzieh and Ma’shur, the port respectively of the Fallahieh and Jarrah districts of Southern ’Arabistan. Course and main features .—The channel of the Khur Musa begins in the sea at a distance from the land, and the position of the entrance may be taken as approximately 29° 55' north and 49° 3' east, or about 30 miles east of the bar of the Shatt-al-’Arab. For the first 31 miles within the entrance the Khur Musa is nearly straight and runs north-north-west ; in the course of the next 5 miles the channel gradually bends round to the east ; and for the remaining 7 miles, to a point where it divides into branches running to Buzieh and Ma’shur, its direction is slightly to the north of east. Near the entrance the banks of the channel are not visible on either side, being covered even at low water, but on the east side from 5 miles within the entrance up to 23 miles, there are patches of sand and mud which are dry at low water. On the opposite side from 14 miles and upwards banks of mud with rocky patches are exposed at half tide. Navigation.—The entrance of Khur Musa is crossed by a bar which carries only 3 fathoms at low spring tides, but is practicable for large vessels at high water, the spring rise being 10 feet. The bottom is of mud and could be easily dredged if necessary. Inside the bar the depth steadily increases, and at a little over 11 miles there is no bottom at 9 fathoms, a conditon which is maintained the whole way to the head of the main Khur. The whole of the Khur Musa proper is navigable for large vessels, and a branch of it called Kfiur Qanaqeh, which branches off west at 29 miles, is navigable for a distance of 7 miles. The only difficulty arises from the invisibility of the edges of the channel except at low water. Naval advantages .—The principal anchorages are completely protected from all winds, and could be easily defended against attack from the open sea. Fresh water could be easily brought from the Jarrahi river which is not far distant, and the climate is probably less trying than in some other parts of the Persian Gulf. On the other side it is not certain that the navi gable portions of the channel could be made approachable, without great expense, from the landward side ; the chief natural anchorage mig t require adaptation in order to form good harbours ; and the bar at t e entrance would require dredging to admit ships in all states of the tide.

KHURRAMABAD— Lat. 33° 32' ; Long. 48° 34' {Bell) ; Elev 4 400' Wilson ; 4,200' {Bell). The capital of Luristan, situated on the Kashgan river, at the foot of a rocky hill crowned by a fort. Khurramabad now lies on the right bank of the river* but the old town is situated on the left. History. When the Arabs overran Persia, Khurramabad became a point of great strategical importance. It was from here that their religious pro paganda spread through Luristan. They constructed two roads through the town, the_ first leading north to Burujird and south to Dizful, the second to Hulaitan and thence to Kirmanshah. From somewhere about 1100 A.D. to 1600 A. D. Khurramabad was the capital of the powerful Atabegs of Luristan who governed this part of Persia. The Khuramabad district is said to have been formerly called Samha. The Akrad Nameh states that Atabeg Shuja’-ud-Din sent his sons Badr and Haidar from Manrud to Samha to fight the Sungardi tribe. The sons went there and besieged Diz-i-Siah, a name still occasionally given to the citadel of Khurramabad. Climate.—In winter, the cold is severe, with a considerable fall of snow, but the transition to summer is very rapid. From the end of March the country begins to be covered with flowers and verdure. The summer is torrid, and during the months of June, July, August and September, the inhabitants move to the hills. In October there is heavy rain. Populations .—This has been variously estimated. De Moro-an gives it as 5,000 ; Wilson in 1911, as 10,000 at least. Resources .—Khurramabad is the principal market of Luristan, but its * bazar is poorly furnished. The environs are well cultivated and fine gardens abound though much spoilt by Lurs of recent years. The Fizful road having been closed for many years, everything is very costly 100 per c ent. and 200 per cent, more so than in Dizful.— {Wilson, 1911).564 KHU—KHU Revenue. —Assessed (with the Chigini) at 10,000 tumdns'm cash and hind. Military. —The town and fort are commanded from high ground to the eastward within easy rifle range. The place is of no military strength. The camping-ground suitable for a brigade lies to the west of the town. Khur- ramabad has never been sacked, as the inhabitants are well-armed and never fail to offer a stout resistance. Post and telegraph.—There is a Post Office with weekly mails to and from Burujird, and fortnightly to and from Dizffd. A Dirful-Khurramabad telegraph line existed at one time, but it was destroyed a very short time after its erection. Bridges. —A bridge, now broken, crosses the river 1| miles south of the town, leading to the old town. The present bridge was built by ’All Mardan Khan in the 9th century and was repaired by Muzaffar-ul-Mulk.

Here, in February 1857, a force under General Sir James Outram defeated the Persian Army. The British force having occupied Bushire, advanced on Borazjun, when the Persian Army, under the Shuja’-ul-Mulk, consisting of 5,000 infantry, 800 cavalry and 18 guns, incontinently fled. Sir James Outram decided to retire. The Persians interpreted this movement as a sign of discomfiture, and the cavalry made a night attack, while the infantry were drawn up at Khush Ab. The contest was soon decided, and by early morning the Persians were in full flight, leaving 700 dead. The British loss was 16.— {Clark — Pelly — MacGregor — Curzon — Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

KHUZISTAN— Lat. 30° to 32° 30'; Long. 48° to 51° ; Elev. A province of Persia, situated in its extreme south-west corner. It is bounded north and east by Luristan and the Bakhtiari mountains, south by the province of Fars and the Persian Gulf, and west by the Shatt-al-’Arab and the Pashalik of Baghdad. Layard gives the following boundaries of Khuzistan :— “ The following are at present generally considered as its proper bound aries ; —To the north and the east mountains of the great chain on which the first snow usually falls ; to the west the river Karkheh, although the pastures on its western bank are inhabited by tribes under the Yali (Governor) of Hawizeh, and are usually considered as Persian ground ; to the south the Jarrahi or Kurdistan river, and a line drawn across the desert from the Karun to the Karkheh, a few miles above the junction of each of the rivers with the Shatt-al-’Arab, or Euphrates ; to the east the Kurdistan. Within this province, therefore, are included the towns of Shushtar, Dizful and Hawizeh, the plain of Ram Hormuz, the Bakhtiari, part of the Faili and part of the Ka’b Arabs : the latter tribes, however, have hitherto been assessed by the Governor of Fars. Behbehan, although in our maps included in the province of Khuzistan, is properly in that of Fars. “ Khuzistan has a length of about 200 miles from Kaleh-i-Rizeh to the Jarrahi river, a breadth of 130 miles from Muhammareh to the northern mountains, and an area of 25,677 square miles. “It is divided politically and administratively into two districts, viz., that of the Shaikh of the Ka’b Arabs and the Government of Shushtar. Its southern portion is composed of low-lying plains indented by numerous khurs, or inlets, and often inundated by the rivers which run through itKHtJ—KHtr 569 in such profusion. The northern part consists of fine, open plains, bounded in their highest parts by the mountains. “ To the south and west of the province are homes of the wandering tribes of Arabs under their different Shaikhs, and on the north and east are tribes of Lurs and Persians. “ To the north-east of Khuzistan is the lofty chain of the* mountains of the Bakhtiaii—a continuation of the main Kurdistan range. Their summits are frequently within the range of perpetual snow, but they are interspersed with fertile valleys, which are well-watered and possess a generous soil. These mountains are the summer residences (ydildq) of the Lur tribes. To the south of them are found highly fertile valleys and spacious plains, on which are the winter encampments of the same tribes. Beyond these, again, there occurs a range of hills, varying from 5,000 to 2,000 feet in height, running parallel with the great chain, and consisting of sandstone and a very friable limestone, much intermixed with gypsum ; and to the west of these are vast plains stretching in one almost uninterrupted flat to the Tigris, the Shatt-al-’Arab, and the sea.” The only hills in Khuzistan are the above-mentioned hills, which Layard mentions as a parallel and separate range to the main range. This, pre sumably, must be a mistake, and it seems more probable that the low hills are merely the ends of spurs from the main range, which spread out into an appearance of distinctness from their parent. Khuzistan is abundantly supplied with rivers, being in this respect different from the rest of Persia. Of these the most important are the Karun, Dizful, Karkheh, and the Jarrahi. The climate of the upper part of Khuzistan, about Shushtar and Dizful, is very healthy. Of mineral products, near Mai Daud are found white naptha and bitumen, and limestone abounds in all the low hills. The population of Khuzistan is mostly composed of wandering tribes : these are the Fail!, Bakhtiari, the Kuhgalu Mamassani to the north, and in the south the Arab tribes of Anafljeh, A1 Kathir, the Ka’b, and Badi Lam. In addition to the care of cattle, which is the prevailing occupation, agriculture is carefully attended to, and the quantity of tobacco, rice and other grain (especially barley) produced along the banks of the river is con siderable. Some cotton is likewise grown, and in the district of Ahwaz sugar was abundant at no very distant period. On the lower parts of the Karun and Karkheh, as well as in the Ka’b country, dates are sufficiently abundant to be an article of commerce. In addition to the bitumen and naphtha of Band-i-Qir, Darreh-i-Naft, etc., tents, red cloth, coarse woollens, and some cottons are manufactured, the last chiefly at Dizful, where dyeing is extensively practised. Large flocks of sheep, with a portion of goats, camels, horses and mules, are to be seen on all the rich pasture grounds of Susiana. Occasionally permanent walled villages are met with, but the greatest part of the inhabitants live in tents, which are of a large size, being sup ported by a number of poles in parallel rows, lessening in height from the ridge towards the sides, which are very low. This kind of tent is more570 KHtt—KHt commodious than that which is in use in other parts of Persia or in Arabia. In the latter country, more frequent changes of residence render one of a higher and smaller construction necessary; The principal towns of Khuzistan are Shushtar, Dizful, Ram Hormuz, Fallahieh. The communications of Khuzistan to the foot of the mountains are extremely open and easy, by means of the numerous rivers which intersect it, especially the Karun. The Ka’b country is difficult by reason of its flooded state in winter and the almost total absence of water in summer. From Shushtar there is a route to Isfahan and Shiraz by Behbehan, and to Baghdad through the country of the Bani Lam Arabs. From Dizful there are routes to Khurramqbad and Burujird, and thence to Kirmanshah and Hamadan. Khuzistan is under the administration of the Governor of ’Arabistan who is usually a member of the Royal family. The holder of the office in 1879 was Prince Hamza Mirza, better known by his title of Hashmat- ud-Dauleh. His nominal residence is Khurramabad in Luristan. The collection of revenue is the only function of Government which the Prince Governor performs all other matters being left to the discretion of chiefs or Governors of the six districts into which Khuzistan is divided. The revenue is of two kinds : — divan, which goes to Tehran and pishkdsh^ which the Prince Governor takes for himself. The six districts, their present chiefs, estimated population, and the revenue of both kinds which they paid in 1879 is as follows :— District. Present chiefs or governors. Estimated population.

They have adopted many Persian customs, and greatly esteem Persian women as wives. There is howeverKHV—KHW 573 The frontier village above Dilam is Shaikh ’Abu-Shaikh or Shah-’Abu-Shah. The Government of Behbehan adjoins that of the Ka’b ’Arabs to the south and west and is under that of Ears, the headquarters of which are at Shiraz. The mionor settlements to the southward^of the Hindian to Bushire emblace a series of petty tribes, both Persian and ’Arab, living in their own circles of villages, and interfered with the Central Persian Government verv much in proportion to their several means of resistance. They are subordinate to the Government of Bushire. Of the settlements, fths are probably Persian, |th ’Arab. As a general rule the ’Arab circles of villages are farmed and administered by their own Shaikhs, who arrange their own civil disputes, and pay a lump sum as revenue per annum. They are coming every year more and more under the local officers of the Shah. The Persian circle of villages or a Persian port comes directly under the local officers of the Shah. Khuzistan .—The following information was obtained in January 1913 con cerning the supply of rifles at the head of the Gulf. The only trade centre from which the Bakhtiari obtain their arms in the Gulf is Ram Hormuz. Arms reach Ram Hormuz from Falahieh, Mashur and Hindian. A few are also said to find their way by land, round the north of the Gulf from Kuwait. The supply of rifles for sale at Ram Hormuz has fallen off very considerably during the last year or two and it is estimated that not more than 200 rifles are now sold there yearly. The Martini-Metfords which are known as “ Mausers ” in the Bakhtiari country, now fetch tumdns 50 to 70 a piece, whereas three years ago they could be bought for tumdns 20 to 25. The Bakhtiari have, during recent years, obtained very large supplies of rifles from the north, Tehran, Isfahan, etc., and during their various campaigns. The Kuhgalu obtain their arms from Bandar Dilam, Mashur and Hindiad, to which places they are brought over from Qatar. The Kuhgalu very rarely sell their arms to the Bakhtiari.

A road thence to Sar-i-Put passes through it.- It is about 10 miles in length from north-west to south-east and about 4 in breadth. Its elevation is from about 4,200 to 3,600 feet. The valley itself is bare of trees, though large quantities grow on the range bounding it to the south, a continuation of the Kuh Kalich. The Kuh Kal Kush to the north of it is practically bare, a stream flows down the centre of the valley which is well-watered by numerous springs, and the grazing, though no doubt excellent in the spring and early summer, is now (September) dried up, except in a few places. The place is inhabited by the Manish Kalhur Kurds under ’Aziz Khan, an old man, his elder son being Mahdi Khan. They number 200 tents with 100 horses, 200 cows and 3,000 sheep. There are also about 300 donkeys. These people do not migrate, but live during the winter inside rough stone walls built against the southern face of the Kuh Kal Kush, and in them they pitch their tents. The place appears to be self-sustaining to a great extent, as there are considerable crops of wheat and barley ; tobacco, also, and pumkins are grown, and there are several water-mills. The valley must have been in ancient days a place of considerable importance, judging by the numerous ruins of forts and towns that remain : they are now, however, but little else than mounds of stones. They are said to have been the work of the Zoroastrams popu larly known in Persia as the “ Gabrs.” This valley leads into the Guar valley by a road 8 miles in length up a narrow valley much blocked up with low hills, but containing a good supply of water and well-wooded. To the north-west a road is said to lead to Sar-i-Pul, about 18 miles distant; the exit in this direction from the valley is over a low ridge and down a steep descent.— {Vaughan.) KlFTEH— Lat. Long.

The summit is 6| miles north-east by east from Dilam, and has snow on it for 6 months in the year.— (Constable — Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot.) KUH CHIREH ZAVIL— A range of hills in Kirmanshah bounding the Ivan valley to the south. The range to the south-east becomes a knife-like ridge which runs for 6 miles till it joins the Manisht Kuh. The top of the ridge is indented like a saw, and it is through the most western of these that the Gardaneh Runu passes. West of the Gardaneh the range rises steeply from the Ivan valley to its north and on the south side, and terminates abruptly in cliffs several hundred feet in height, below which are steep slopes well-wooded and terminating in the Chavar valley. The northern slope, which is well-wooded, contains numerous broad and deep ravines of short length. These are thickly wooded. The strata, like those of most of the other ranges in this part of Persia, are upheaved towards the south-west, pointing in that direction at angles between 20° and 60°.— (Vaughan.) KUH DASHT or KIASHT— Lat. Long. Elev. 3,850'. A broad plain in the Pish Kuh district of Luristan, on the western edge of which flows the Madian river. The plain stretches some 8 miles in all directions, and is bounded on all sides by hills. The road from Khurrama- bad to Deh Bala crosses it to the bridge over the Madian Rud, at its south west corner. The elevation is not sufficient to make it a good pasture ground in the summer, and it holds water only in the Madian streams and on the edges below the mountains, where only are Lur camps. In spring and winter it is more thickly inhabited. The plain lies within the territory of the Amrai Lurs. The Madian Rud rises in this plain.— (Burton, 1987.)580 Kt)H—KftH KCH DUNOSKH— Lat. Long. Elev. A mountain in Kirmanshah terminating the Kifraur valley to the north west. It is a rounded hill with easy slopes on the eastern side, and it throws out a rounded ridge to the south, which connects it with the Kaluj range bounding the valley in that direction. The stream down the Kifraur valley from Guar and that from Tirau meet in this ridge on a deep rift, and the united waters flow on into the Dehyra valley and thence on towards Sar-i-Pul. The hill is bare of trees. A road from Kifraur to Kaleh Shahin runs north of it. (Vaughan.) KUH GACHI (KtH GACHlN)— A range of hills running from a point about 5 miles north of Birkeh Band- -i-’Ali to a point 2 miles south of Gachin ; direction about north-east to south-west; highest from 800 to 1,000 feet. The south slope is precipitous and impassable from Tang Chakabak to the east of the range, the north slope being fairly gentle. West of Tang Chakabak, the range is broader, and much intersected by ravines. KUH GADEH— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Dashti district of Ears, 1 mile south-east of Faqih Hasanan containing 10 houses.— (Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) KUHGALU (COUNTRY).— For History, Ethnography, Administration and Military see under Kuhgalu (Tribe). Geography. The information at present available regarding the Kuhgalu country is very scanty. Boundaries. —On the north, the boundary of the Kuhgalu country is indefinite : but it may be said that the head-waters of the Ab-i- Ala, rising in the Mangasht mountains are in thir hands, and that the country to within a few miles of the Karun near Bars is theirs. Their territory also extends to near Lurdagan—a district inhabited by a settled Bakhtiari population. To the east, w T e know nothing of the Kuhgalu-Qashqai boundary, beyond the fact that Bell mentions Sisakht and Khurra sa Kuhgalu territory. We may assume, then, that, at all events in 1888, the prominent Kuh-i-Dmar formed the Kuhgalu-Qashqai boundary. To the south also w’e know nothing definite. Kaleh-i-Aru is in the hands of the Buir Ahmadi, Basht belongs to the Bavi, a tribe of Arab extraction, who many years ago joined the Kuhgalh. South of Basht and Behbe lan are various gwasi-Kubgalu tribes, classed by Baring in 1882 as Zir-i-Ku Kuhgalu. They are Kuhgalu, however, only in name, like the Bakhtiari in the Ramuz district. , , To the west, our knowledge is somewhat more exact, but is comphca e by the fact that certain sections of the Bahmai tribe, who are undou te } Kuhgalu by origin, have in recent years owned allegiance to the Bakhtiari, to whom they pay a light tribute. Their territory must, however, be considered as Kuhgalu country, though not within the administrative province of Fars, as is nominally the case w r i bother administrative tri es.KtH—Kt)H 581 Kai Kaus, the site of Sassanian mins, and of a fire temple in good preserva tion, is just on the Kuhgalu side of the border, which runs north-west, nearly parallel to the Ramuz-Behbehan road, to a point 2 miles west of Pijan on the Ab-i-Bulfaris. From this point it runs north-east, crossing the Dalun-Bulfarls road midway between Batik and Bulfarls, and Kuh-i- Bengistun and Tanbulun to a point midway between Talavar and Kaleh- i-Ala. The former is a Bakhtiari village, the latter the headquarters of a section of the Bahmal, tributary to the Bakhtiari. North of Talavar, a small tract of land, known as Saiyidun, extending to Shah-i-Mangasht, is in the hands of another section of Bahmal, under Zaki Khan, also tributary to the Bakhtiari. The south slopes of the Mangasht, for the most part, and all the east slopes, are in the hands of Bahmal who own allegiance to Muhammad Husain Khan of Kaleh-i-Ala, or to ’All Murad Khan of Dishmuk. Rivers .—The Kuhgalu country is drained by two great rivers, the Karun and the Jarrahl, and by both the main branches of the latter, viz., the Ab-i- Ala and_the Ab-i-Marun. The principal Kuhgalu tributaries of the Karun are the Ab-i-Bars and the Daria-i-Gandum. The Ab-i-’Ala rises on the east slopes of Mangasht, and drains the cuntry to within a few miles of Dishmuk, falling eventually into the Rud-i-Zard, of which it forms the greater part. The basin of the Ab-i-Behbehan, or the Ab-i-Marun, is apparently entirely Kuhgalu country. Dishmuk (6,500') is near the head of each of these systems : the Dishmuk Valley itself drains south to Behbehan. Two miles todhe east the country drains into the Ab-i-’Ala, and a few miles to the north, into the Ab-i-Bars. All these streams are snow-fed, and sweet. The mountains run north-north-west and south- south-east, as elsewhere, but the rivers cut through them forcibly, and, generally speaking, have a north-east and south-west trend. Mountains. —From Malamlr south-south-east, to Behbehan extends a lofty, though not continuous, range of limestone hills from 9,000' to 10,000, m elevation, which contrast sharply with the low sandstone and gypsum hills of the Bakhtiari Garmslr. They form a solid barrier between the Bakhtiari and the Kuhgalu territories, and are the cause of the backward State of the Kuhgalu as compared with their neighbours. East of this barrier, extends an elevated plateau, at the head of which lies the Dishmuk Valley : the plateau is broken by hills, prominent amongst which are the gaunt limestone saddle-backs of Kuh-i-Barf-i-Kun, and Kuh-i-Nll. The latter is probably not less than 10,000' high, and its summit is over 4,000' above the general level of the vicinity. Places of importance. —The capital of the Kuhgalu country, if any place can be called such, is Behbehan (q.v.). It is here that the governor of the Kuhgald resides. Other important places are Dishmuk in the north, and Basht in the south. For forts in the Kuhgalu country see under the separate tribes Bulr AhmadI, Dushman Zlari, Bavl and Bahmal. Climate and Health. —The climate of the Kuhgalu country resembles that of the Bakhtiari country in being hot in the low country in the summer (as high a temperature as 124° in the shade having been registered in mid summer), and temperate in the winter. In the high country, the tem perature is equable in the summer, but extremely cold im the winter.582 KCH—KtfH The little valley of Dishmuk (6,500') is said to be under snow for several months in winter, but the flimsy dwellings of the inhabitants, who live there all the year round, indicate that the cold is not severe for long. Resources. Water. —The streams mentioned under Rivers are snow fed and sweet, but there is no further information regarding water except along the routes {q.v.). Supplies. —The Kuhgalu country is inhabited by probably not more than 10,000 familes, the majority of whom are pastoral, relying upon acorns rather than corn, for their daily bread. There is no export of grain as far as can be ascertained ; yet the country is well-watered and fertile, and could support a population 20 times as great as it does at present. Little grain is grown in the district, the crops only sufficing for the normal needs of the population. The surplus for sale is thus small, and large caravans would have difficulty in obtaining supplies : a reserve, at all events for horses, of several days’ grain should therefore be carried. For mules, the excellent grazing available will serve as a substitute for grain for the brief period when none can be obtained (see tables). It is well wooded, mainly with ballut (dwarf oak), but there are many other trees, such as walnut, apricot, jujube, fig, etc., whose fruit, together with the acorn, is a staple food for the tribesmen. Cypress trees, from which large quantities of timber are cut, are found in the Tang-i-Sarvak : the timber goes to Behbehan. A tea plant is found growing wild on the hill slopes between the Kuh-i-Siah and Kuh-i-Safid, and is to some slight extent used by the poorer of the local Lurs, who cannot afford, or who run out of the more costly manufactured imported article. Animals.—There are few horses, mules or donkeys, in the district. The people are not really migratory, and do not need them, Their winter quarters are in the valleys ; their summer camps in the hills, 6 miles or so off. Mule breeding does not seem to be practised, though these animals are frequently stolen from the Bakhtiari road. Bullocks are commonly in use for local transport, but even these only suffice for actual requirements. (See tables.) Trade. —The principal exports are ghi, wool and country cloth, rope of goat-hair, skins, and walnuts. In return, felt, cotton cloth, iron goods, tea, sugar, etc., are purchased at Ramuz or Behbehan, as well as arms and ammunition. Some trade, especially that of the Buir Ahmadi, goes to Ardakan. The Bahmai deal mainly with Ramuz. This traffic, such as it is, is carried on, not by the tribesmen themselves, but by agents, whose general usefulness ensures the safety of their caravans wherever they may go. Such men form the necessary link between the various hostile tribes and the external markets. Arts and Crafts. —The women of the tribe weave coarse woollen carpet 8 and gilims from wool produced by their own flocks, the dyes being obtained from the trade marts mentioned above. Unfortunately, however, the practice of using an admixture of aniline with fast dyes is on the increase, to the detriment of the industry concerned. The women also weave coarseKOT—KttH 583 woollen wrappings (Lur : Khur) about 9' 6' by 3', which are used chiefly for sewing up into sacks for the transport of grain, etc. The black goats’ hair cloth, used exclusively in the construction of their tents, is also woven by the women and girls of the tribe, usually in lengths of about 20' by 3'. Crafts found among the tribe are few and of the very simplest nature, the most common being that of the blacksmith, with here and there an armourer or a carpenter, and each sub-division has its own “ medicine man. ” Minerals .—Iron is found in the Tang-i-Maghar, and coal and lignite in that place and the Kuh-i-Dinar in Buir Ahmadi country. Oil and bitumen are obtained in a valley close to, and east of the Tang-i-Tikan, and in a valley near Tashan (q.v.). At the Tang-i-Tikan the oil exists in a form which is technically known as “ shows ” and flows into a local stream, on the surface of which it is borne away. Sulphur is found at Tang-i-Bin, Tang-i-Bizak, Tang-i-Shibr, off the Tang-i-Chavil, and from numerous sulphur springs. Mumai, or “ mumani ” as it is called by the Kuhgalu, is found in various places in their country ; the best being obtained at Tang-i-Tikan, whence 200 misqdls are taken annually to Behbehan and there sold for export to various parts of Persia. It is also found at Tang-i-Bin, Kuh-i-Bivara, and Kaleh Nauzar (Kaleh Nadir). It is a black wax-like substance valued for its healing properties. The following tables showing the supplies and animals of the Kuhgalu tribes were drawn up by Lieutenant Ranking in 1910. The figures are necessarily only a rough estimate arbitrarily computed. Wilson says only sufficient grain for the needs of the tribe is grown. Supplies :— Tribe. Acres of cultivat ed land. Available per annum after CONSUMPTION. HOME Tannin. Other products.

The Kuhgalu country can be entered by any of the following routes, the first of which is the easiest and most convenient from a British point of view. 1. Bandar Dilam to Behbehan 48 miles in 3 stages. The route is only for mules, though there are no serious obstacles, but it is very hot in the summer. Water is abundant and some supplies procurable, except at the first stage where both are scarce. From Behbehan a further advance could be made into the heart of the country via Baba Ahmed and the Tang-i-Saulak north-west of Behbehan, or via Deh Dasht north-east of Behbehan. 2. Kazarun to Behbehan via Tal Aspid, 133 miles in seven stages. This route traverses Mamassani and Zir-i-Kuh Kuhgalu territory, and is mostly over rough hilly country only passable for mules. W ater is procurable in ' abundance, and supplies at several places. 3. Ahwaz to Dalun via Ramuz 86 miles in 5 stages, and also to Dishmuk 109 miles in 8 stages. Both difficult roads after Ramuz, but might be useful for getting into Bahmai Kuhgalu country. 4. Asupas on the Shiraz-Isfahan road (Sarhad route) to Sisakht (Kuh-i- Dinar), on the eastern border of Buir AhmadI country. Nothing is known regarding this route. There are probably other routes across from the Shiraz-Isfahan road. 5. From several points on the Bakhtiari (Lynch Road, e.g., Kaleh Mad- rasseh via Bars to Dishmuk, for the Dushman Ziari and Bahmari tribes , Du Bulan to Lurdagan for the Nuyi tribe ; and Ardal to Sisakht (Kuh-i- Dinar) for the Buir Ahmadi. There are no tracks in common use by large caravans across the Kuhgalu country. This absence of routes is, however, probably due rather to the inhospitable nature of the people than to the difficulty of the groun .KtfH—KUH 585' From Ahwaz to Isfahan straight lines via Ramuz and Ganduman are 218 miles against 275 by the Lynch road. A track exists via Tang-i-Chavil and Dishmuk, which is almost exactly on these straight lines, and which could be easily improved sufficiently to make it, at all events, better than many parts of the Lynch road. Tribal feuds, however, prevent this road being used for the present (1909), and Dishmuk must be reached either via Tang-i-Saulak of via Bars. From Dishmuk to Lurdagan a reasonably good track is said to exist via Bard-i-Kirm, and from Lurdagan to Isfahan the road is known to be good. Such a road would be 25 per cent, shorter than the Lynch road, and the fact that its existence and practicability was known to us would be a valuable asset to us in dealing with the Bakhtiari Khans, should difficulties arise regarding the road. The crossing of the Karun would be avoided, and, as it appears that no streams not easily fordable are met with, the construction of‘expensive bridges would be unneces sary. De Bode (1845) mentions an ancient paved way leading up the Tang-i- Saulak to Isfahan, and he saw Parthian sculptures on rocks at the same place. This might well have been an ancient route between Behbehan and Isfahan. KUHGALU (TRIBE). History. The Kuhgalu are sprung, in all probability, from the original Lur stock, but who they were, and whence they came, is merely a matter of conjecture ; for they are a people without history, literature, or education, and with few tribal traditions. Baron C. A. De Bode in 1845 visited the country and mentions among other things a spring with sacred fish at Tashan ; but in 1910 no trace of this could be found, though Tashan shows the remains of what, probably at the time of the Atabegs, was a large town. There are also ancient inscriptions and archaeological remains at Tang-i-Band, Tang-i- Sarrak, Gurri and Siah Gul. About 1882 the Kuhgalu were the object of a merciless visitation by Farhad Mirza, who was Governor General of Fars up to that date. They, however, soon recovered and resumed their predatory habits. Circumstances have hitherto (1909) prevented His Britannic Majesty’s Consul from opening up direct relations with any of the Kuhgalu Chiefs, though it is admittedly desirable that this should be done. Captain Lorimer in 1907 met Husain Khan Bahmai, brother of ’All Naqi, and received a cordial invitation to visit the Kuhgalu country. This fact, added to the favourable reception by ’Ali Murad Khan of Dishmuk of Lieutenant Wilson in 1909, shows that the Kuhgalu chiefs were anxious to open friendly intercourse. Tribal dissensions make it impossible for the Kuhgalu to present a bold front to an enemy. Some of the Bahmai have in consequence made a show of submitting to the Bakhtiari, but the bitterness between the rank and file of the Bakhtiari and Kuhgalu tribes is (1908) great, and not likely toD86 KtfH—KtH diminish. The predatory tendencies of the latter at the expense of the former culminated in an expedition by the Bakhtiari against the Bahmai of ’Ali Murad Khan in February 1908. A force of about 3,000 men, after a long delay at Dalun and Sarileh advanced up the Tang-i-ChavIl to Dishmuk. But they effected nothing, beyond killing a few Saiyids, and burning their huts. The fort of Dishmuk itself was too strong for them to storm, and they were compelled to withdraw. The tribe principally concerned in the highway robberies and murders of Bakhtiaris on the Lynch road is by universal consent the TaiyibI, but it is asserted that their operations would be impossible without the assistance, or at all events the permission of ’All Murad Khan of Dishmuk, whose land must be crossed by them on their raiding expeditions. ’Ali Murad Khan was therefore fastened upon as being morally responsible, and as being a man of substance, the TaiyibI on the other hand being nomads with no immovable property. The Kuhgalu seem to have been entirely unaffected by the disturbances of 1909, which culminated in the deposition of the Shah. They did not raid the roads, nor cause any trouble, except perhaps near Shiraz in con junction with the Qashqal. In November 1909 the Bulr Ahmadi, in conjunction, it is said, with Muhammad ’Ali Khan, Kashkull, made a carefully planned and successful raid on the Russian Consul-General’s caravan. In July 1911 ’Ali Naqi Khan chief of the Ahmadi Bahmai was murdered at the instigation of his nephew Darvish Khan, who took over the chieftain ship and the chief’s fort at Likak ; but the murdered man’s brother Husain Khan, by means of treachery, managed to murder Darvish Khan, and in turn assumed the chieftainship. During 1911, Bahadur-i-Divan was Deputy Governor of Behbehan and consequently in charge of the Kuhgalu, and though Nizam-us-Sultaneh was appointed to the post in February 1911, he did not himself take it up, and his deputies only held it for a short time, during which disturbances were rife. In October 1911, Amlr-i-Mujahid, Bakhtiari, was nominated Deputy Governor, partly because he was a relation of the Bahmals, but neither he nor his deputies reached Behbehan till a year later when, at the instance of Sardar-i-Jang, Illkhani of the Bakhtiari, under whom the Kuhgalu were placed, he was at last persuaded to take up the appointment. He then seized Dishmuk and garrisoned it with Bakhtiaris. During 1911 and 1912 the Kuhgalu maintained their notoriety for raiding. The TaiyibI freely plundered caravans on the Lynch road, and the Bakhtiaris made no effort to restrain them. In March 1912 a band of about 400 Kuhgalus had possession of the Urchlnl pass on the Shiraz- Isfahan road and plundered caravans at will. At the end of September 1912 the Bulr Ahmadi attacked and routed two parties of sowars sent out from Shiraz to meet the new Governor General, and in December 1912 the same tribe was said to be responsible for the attack, in which Captain Eckford was killed.■P' tie nai [ter ml ids, k ders it it nee, and han ling no ces lot in ter CafKtH—KtfH 587 Early in 1913 Amir-i-Mujahid arranged for two columns to enter the Kuhgalu country, in order to coerce the Taiyibi Dushman Ziari, and part of the Buir Ahmadi into submission. A northern column, composed chiefly of Bakhtiaris with some friendly Bahmai, entered the country from Ramuz and Mamatain. This column was cut off by the Taiyibi Kuhgalus, who held the Tang-i-Chavil in its rear, and was then attacked and dispersed. Another column operating from Behbehad, supported by Shukrullah’s section of the Buir Ahmadi, was reported to have achieved wonders against the Buir Ahmadi. This column also attempted to coerce the Mamassani, and with this obejct called in the co-operation of the Kashkuli. The net result, however, of the whole appears to have been negligible, and the Bakhtiari road was subjected to Kuhgalu raids as usual. About this time the strange phenomenon was presented of some Buir Ahmadi under Mulla Qubad, regularly escorting caravans on the Bushire- Isfahan road, between Aminabad and Abadeh, and thus rendering the road comparatively safe. Ethnography. The Kuhgalu or Kuhgilui, as they are sometimes called, find a meaning for their appellation in the derivation “ Kuh-i-Gilui ” or the “ Dwellers of the earth hills. ” They are, for the greater part, nomads like their neighbours the Bakhtiaris, with the difference, however, that their annual migrations are much shorter than those of their neighbours, and are often restricted to moving from the valley bottoms to the upper mountain slopes. They are sub-divided into tribes and sub-tribes, given in detail later, which are sub-divided into tribes and sub-tribes, given in detail later, which are often separated by bitter and implacable blood-feuds. The Kuhgalu consider themselves distinct from the Bakhtiaris ; their dialect, however, differs but little from that the Bakhtiari, and their manners, customs character and religion are the same. Few Kuhgalu can understand ordinary Persian. The mode of life and habits of the Kuhgalu are very primitive, and their Chiefs have even less of the veneer of civilization than those of western Luristan. They are roughly dressed, often without shoes, and are more uncouth than the Bakhtiari. Their administration {q.v.) is of the patriarchal form, common to all tribes of the Lur stock, and their form of taxation is light. In looks, they are living images of the figures which are found in the rock carvings in their country, both in features, mode of dressing their hair and, to a great exent, their clothing. The tribe numbers about 25,000 families, and estimates vary from 10,000 to 20,000 regarding the number of fighting men the tribe could raise (see table under Military). These figures take no account of the settled population of Behbehan, Zaidan and Liravi-Dasht (q-v.). The Kuhgalu tribe is divided in two different ways, ethnographically and geographically, thus causing some confusion, especially as authorities differ588 KUH—Kt)H as to the classification in each case. The two main sub-divisions ethnographically are :—• (a) Chehdr Banleheh, sub-divided into :— Buir Ahmadi. Dushman Ziari Churam. Nuji. Bavi. (b) Lirdvi, sub-divided into :— f Ahmadi. (_Mahmudi.

When divided by locality they are known as Pusht-i-Kuh (hill tribes) and Zir-i-Kuh (plain dwellers), and are grouped as follows :— (D Pusht-i-Kuh. Buir- Ahmadi. Dushman Ziari. Churam. Nuji. Ba\ i. Bahma TaiyiLi Ahmadi. Mahmu&lt; i. Sarhaci Garmsiii. (2) Zlri-Kuh. Khadiri (Liravi). Agha Jari. The inhabitants of Behbehan, Zaidan, Humajat, Liravi (coast district) and Bandar Dilam are also classed as Zir-i-Kuh Kuhgalus, but they are sedentary and sometimes excluded from the classification of Kuhgalus, and this system is followed in this article. For a description of the inhabitants of those places see under their respective names. Details regarding the sub divisions of the Kuhgalu will also be found under the individual sub-tribes. Military. Characteristics .—In 1909 Lieutenant Wilson said the Kuhgalu were generally of smaller build, less good looking, less striking in appearance but more daring, more supspicious, more thievish, and more savage, though less well armed than the Bakhtiari. Probably only one man in three had a serviceable rifle, and grown men carried a little sling, wherewith to slay birds and other small animals. In 1910, however, Lieutenant Ranking said :— “ The Kuhgalu are infinitely better armed and physically are a finer race than their neighbours the Bakhtiaris, or the tribes who inhabit Western Luristan. They are wild and lawless, most notably the Taiyibi, who have gained an unenviable notoriety in connection with their depredations on the Lynch Road (Ahwaz to Isfahan via the Bakhtiari Country).” Since then they have probably armed themselves still better as Behbehan had become, in 1912, a depot for the sale of arms, and many cargoes were probably run across from the Arabian coast to near Bandar Dilam. jiRelations with British.—In 1909 Lieutenant Wilson wrote as follows regarding British relations with the Kuhgalu. “ The principal Kuhgalu chiefs are anxious to open up friendly relations with the British. That it is desirable from our point of view that such should exist is indisputable. The existence of important British interests, in the shape of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s works, at Mamatain close to the Kuhgalu border, is in itself a sufficient justification, for the population of Mamatain consists mainly of Kala Kaj Kuhgalu (Bahmai). We must not put all our eggs into one basket by cultivating the friendship of the Bakhtiari to the neglect of the Kuhgalu, whose virile qualities will sooner of later ensure them a position and a hearing in the settlement of local problems. ” Should the Kuhgalu wish to annoy the Bakhtiari, they could easily seize Mamatain, and could not readily be turned out, though their numbers, only one-fifth of the Bakhtiaris make it unlikely that they could offer a prolonged resistance. Feuds .—The Kuhgalu as a tribe are much weakened by the almost incessant feuds existing between the different divisionc. In 1909 the principal inter-tribal feuds were as follows :— Buir Ahmadi versus Dushman Ziari. Bahmai versus Taiyibi (part only). Bahmai of Zaqi Khan Bahmai of Muhammad Husain Khan subse quently appointed by ^versus Bahmai of ’Ali Murad Khan. Amir-i-Mujahid to be sole head of the Bahmai tribe {Grey). Mr. Chick in 1910 said the Kuhgalu as a whole leant more towards the Qashqai than the Bakhtiari, with whom they are usually at enmity. They have also been known to combine with the Mumassani, who are sometimes even classed as Kuhgalus. Travels .—On account of the fact that the Kuhgalu tribes are split up into a number of mutually hostile factions, these must be reckoned with when moving from valley to valley. In 1909, however, Wilson said that there was no reason to suppose that any serious obstacle would be encountered by a suitably qualified officer, who took care to travel as far as possible under the auspices of the various Khans. A qualified officer would have no difficulty in seeing most of the Kuhgalu country, though he would have to be chary of open note-taking and of instrumental observations, as the Kuhgalu tribes men are suspicious in the extreme of such doings in their country. The best time for travel in the Kuhgalu country is spring and early summer, when grass is abundant, and animals can graze. Grain and fodder are scarce. Punitive measures. —It would be extremely difficult to inflict summary punishment on any section of the Kuhgalu, especially on the Buir Ahmadis or the Taiyibi, who are the worst offenders, as their country is difficult of access, their property mostly moveable, and their migrations short.KUH—KUH 591 Administration. Revenue. —The Kuhgalu except the Bahmai, who are under the Bakhtiaris r are under the Governor of Behbehan, who until recently was under the Governor-General of Ears, but is now under the Bakhtiari Ilkhani (1912). Each division has its own chiefs, who are responsible for the annual tribute. So long as this is paid, and the tribes do not harass their Persian neighbours or engage in serious hostilities among themselves, their internal govern ment is not greatly interfered with. Speaking generally we may say that all the various sub-tribes, which go to make up the Kuhgalu, are taxed on the same principle, with but minor points of difference between the various systems. Their malidt or taxation is of two kinds, viz .:— (a) Khaki and (6) Badi or Sari, Khaki being taxation on cereals and property, while Sari is a poll-tax. Tenants usually pay Khaki, at a rate of | or | produce in kind, to the landlord, in addition to the Sari. The taxation is not heavy and bears but lightly on the tribesmen. The following list shows the amount of tribute demanded from each tribe :— Tumans Tribe. per annum. Bulr Ahmad .......... 4,000 Dushman Ziarl ......... 1,000 Churam .......... 900 Nuyl ........... 1,000 Bavi ........... 3,500 AhmadI Bahmai ......... 3,000 Mahmudi Bahmai ......... 2,000 Taiyibi Sarhadi ......... 2,500 Taiyibi Garmsiri ......... 2,000 Khadiri 4,400 5gha Jart .......... 620 For coinage, weights and measures see under Behbehan.— {Ranking, 1909 — Wilson, 1908—Grey, 1912.)

This is a belt of mountainous country, averaging only a few miles in width which bounds the province of Ears on the north and north-east and runs in a general north-west to south-east direction from near Lake Niriz to the extreme south-east corner of Ears. It is a very little known tract of country, and for a good many years past has paid no revenue whatever. The present chief of the Sarkuhis is one Shaikh Abul Hassan, a brother of the lateKUH—KUH 597 Shaikh Zaharieh, but his authority is only nominal, and the bulk of the country is practically independent of any control whatever. These people, through their various headmen, have written to the Kawam stating that they are prepared to pay a certain amount of revenue, but limiting that amount to one-tenth of the value of the produce of their country for the year. As it is of course quite impossible either for the Kawam or for the Revenue Department to make any estimate of the value of the produce of this wild region, the offer has little real significance, and the Kawam regards it merely as a pretext for raising difficulties and as a means for escaping any payment at all. Besides this, he says, the Kuhistanis are a truculent lot, and really to fight and subdue them would mean a military expedition on a much larger and more expensive scale than his will be.

At its northern extremity, called Ching Kauntar, its height is only 467 feet, and it attains its highest elevation at the Burial peaks in the middle behind Bu’lkhair. It is crossed in one or two places by passes between the coast and the khurmuj valley. The southern end of the range abuts on the Mund river, whence its name, but it is also called the Kuh-i-Kar.— (Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.)KUH-I-MAZARIM— Elev. 7,800'. A range of mountains in the Bakhtiarl country. Its eastern slopes abut on the right bank of the Ab-i-Bazuft, about 8 miles below the Pul-i- ’Amarat. The BakhtiarT caravan road runs along a northern spur of the range, on its 9th stage from Isfahan, between miles 146 and 150. The pass of the same name is crossed by the Isfahan-’Arabistan trade road, immediately above and to the west of the Pul-i-’Amarat bridge over the Bazuft river. It seems to be known as the Gardaneh-i-Marvarid also. The ascent from the bridge is a steep and stony zig-zag. It must always be severe from its length, but the state of repair makes a great difference. In 1906 it has been cleared and improved. The bottom portion is in rocky soil and hence the track is narrow and rough. The immediate ascent from the bridge is a steep rock surface. Half a mile below the pass on the Pul-i-’Amarat side is the Chashmeh- -i-Marvarid, a spring of scanty water, and the Kaleh-i-Marvarid is passed almost immediately afterwards. The Kaleh has now only some walls left standing. It was built of rubble and gach. To the south-west of the pass, the road crosses connecting ridges to the Manak ride, above Deh Diz. To the north of the pass, the mountain falls steeply to the ravine running down to the Bazuft river. The hills around are well wooded. There is no water except at the Marvarid spring. The ascent from the Pul-i-’Amarat to the top of the pass is about 2,000 feet and the descent 1,750 feet by an easy gradient and a good, broad road, the last few hundred feet being steep. Height of the pass 5,800 feet.— {Burton, 1903—Report of a Journey through the Bakhtiari Country to Shush- tar — Morton, 1905 — Arbuihnot, 1905 — Lorimer, 1906.) KUHIMEH— Lat. Long. Elev.

A range of mountains in the Bakhtiari country, crossed at 83 miles by the track from Dizful to Kaleh Bazuft via Duma Khail. The roadway, rising by gradual gradients to the crest, wus originally built with care, and is even now sufficiently good to ride up. The descent on the north side to Shimbar is very rough.— (McSwiney, 1891.) KUH-I-MUMIAU —Lat. Long. Elev. A hill in Ears, about 20 miles west of Darab. A blackish, bitumenous matter issues from the rock here, which is regarded by the Persians as a sovereign remedy for cuts, bruises, and even fractures, but it really has no qualities superior to other bitumen.— (Ouseley.) KUH-I-MURDEH (?)— Lat. Long. Elev. A hillside along which the caravan route from Isfahan to Shushtar passes* north of the Malamlr plain.

Elev. 4,000'. A mountain of the maritime range of Ears, and the continuation of the same on the south of the Mund gap. It is of sandstone below, and towards the summit consists largely of salt, which is visible from afar as glistening streaks of white or grey.'— {Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) KUH-I-NAMAK (2) — Lat. Long. Elev. A hill in Ears, about 10 miles west of Darab and north of the road thence to Fasa. It appears to consist of nothing but fine salt. Its variegated colours together with its numerous sharp pinnacles standing out against the dark background formed by the hills beyond, make it a remarkable land mark.— {Preece, 1884.) KUH-I-NAMAK-I-ANGURU— Lat. Long. Elev. A mass of hills, about 8 miles north of Gachin. The strata curve up from all sides and appear to be level at the summit ; the centre is occupied by a depression, partially filled by a mass of greyish rock tinged with red. There is no sign of a gap through which the Shur river could flow and it is probable that the latter flows round the east end of the hill.— {Wilson and Cruickshank, 1907.) KUH-I-NISAR— Lat. Long. Elev. Name of the highest part of a range stretching apparently from north east to south-west of Farrashband, Ears. St. John’s map makes it ter minate in a southerly direction, about due west of that place {vide Durand’s Report of a Tour in Ears, 1878). The lesser range above Farrashband is about 3,200 feet high.— {Durand.) The summit of the pass over this wide and broken range is reached 9 miles after leaving the plain of Farrashband on the road from that place toKalimeh. There are slight traces of the road made by the Persian Army in 1856-57.— {St. John.) KUH-I-NU— Lat. Long. Elev.

KUH-I-PISH AMBADI— Lat. Long. Elev. A range of hills in the Chehar Mahal district, south-west of Isfahan and north of Qehfarukh village.— {Schindler.) KUH-I-PUZEH PADRl— Lat. Long. Elev. 4,216'. A mountain forming the south-eastern extremity of the Kuchur range on the south-west side of the Riz river valley. This mountain is perhaps identifiable with Siri Aianat, whose altitude above the sea by Admiralty chart is 4,660 feet. Mr. Butcher’s observations, by boiling point thermo meter and four-inch aneroid corrected for index error, etc., give the altitude above sea 4,216 feet and above Jam, 1,527 feet. This mountain bears from Jam 225| , distant three and a half miles. Near its northern foot are the remains of two large hands, also a plantation of date trees with the ruins of several old houses. From this point the ascent of Kuh-i-Puzeh PadrI, which occupies 1 hour 45 minutes, is usually made. The base of the hill is composed of solid limestone rock, from a cleft in which a stream of pure fresh water issues and runs into an artificial cistern. The hands mentioned above were probably intended to store this water, as also the surface dainage. The north-east side of the mountain, although very steep, forms ledges and slopes, which might be utilised for building. Paths also might readily be made. On the side of the hill are passed, in the ascent, the ruins of small stone houses said, by the natives, to have been inhabited by white men, presumably the Portuguese. The mountain, which is rocky and stony, is generally bare and devoid of trees, shrubs or grass. The summit forms a level area of considerable extent, length roughly 400 and breadth 200 yards. From this point precipices drop, on the south-west and south-east sides, to the depth of 350 to 450 feet, and a fine panorama is afforded of the sea coast to the south-east and of the surrounding mountain system. The ascent from the north-east side, although very rugged and precipitous and diffi cult, would be practicable for mule batteries.— {Butcher, 1888.) KUH-I-QALANDRUN— A hill, visible from a distance, situated in a desert country about 14 miles south-west of Zaru close to a track to Abadeh.

It is passed soon after leaving Kand ’Arab! for Bishneh.— {Dobbs, 1903.) KUH-I-RANG— Lat. Long. Elev. 12,800'. A mountain approximately in the centre of the Bakhtiari country. The highest peak is 12,800 feet and is probably the highest of the Zardeh Kuh group. The Kuh-i-Rang is the centre of this range and the central sponge from which all the rivers in these parts have their so'urces. It consists of large, rounded spurs trending the usual course north-west to south-east, withKUH—KUH 603 gentle slopes and far-reaching limbs to the south-east, and with abrupt, rocky and deeply gutted ravines to the north-west. At a distance of a few miles these are cross-cut by the water system, of which the Gukun river, run ning north-east to south-west, is a part, at an altitude of 6,000 feet and below the Zardeh Kuh peaks. The Zardeh Kuh peaks are five in number, united together by round-topped watersheds, affording an abundance of water (snow), fuel and fodder, with a magnificent view in every direction.

The Kuh-i-Rukh is the watershed of the country south-west of Isfahan, and is crossed by the road to Shushtar at about 45 miles from Isfahan, by the Gardan-i-Rukh, 8,120 feet (q.v.). It forms the boundary between the Isfahan and Chehar Mahal districts. The ascent to the Gardan-i-Rukh is steep and strewn with stones and boulders, ruling gradients ^ to T \,. The last ascent consists of steep zig zags. The descent is more gentle than the ascent, but the boulders blocking it are of larger size, some over 6 feet high. For 100 yards the road is very narrow and for 100 feet the gradient is ^ ; it then becomes a stony and broad path with gradients T V to T V-— (Bell 1884.) KUH-I-SAFID— vide SAFID (KUH-I-).

A range of mountains in Ears, bordering on the district of Padina, near the mountains of Dina.— (Durand.) KUH-I-SIAH (3)—Lat. Long. Elev. A range of hills in the Sarvistan district of Ears. On the north-west side, where the Sarvistan-Fasa road ascends it, are two towers, one on the side of the hill, the other on the top of a spur. The whole of this piece of country resembles that on the top of the gach hills between Kamarij and Kazarun. The road runs almost along the north-west side of the Kuh-i-Siah, and the ground between it and the hill is completely seamed with water-courses and gullies, and has a very scored appearance.— (Preece, 1884.) KUH1STAN (1)— The name of the mountainous tract lying to the west and south-west of Yazd town. Roughly speaking it extends from Nadushan in the north-west to Kalvand in the south. It consists of several ranges running from north west to south-east, and connected by high ground with an average eleva tion of 5,500 feet. The highest peaks of the range are the Shir Kuh 13,740 feet, the Kuh-Tizarjan 13,986 feet, and the Kuh Ardarushk about 14,500 feet. These hills as a rule rise gradually from the Yazd side, and fall abruptly on the other side to the level of the plateau. Kuhistan is divided into three parts :— (1) Pish Kuh. (2) Mian Kuh. (3) Pusht-i-Kuh. (1) Pish Kuh comprises Taft, Khunsar, Fakhrabad, and other adjacent villages and towns ; (2) Mian Kuh, all the central towns such as Deh Rala, Tizarjan and Masheh ; while (3) Pusht-i-Kuh comprises the remainder of the elevated region to the west. The richest, most populous, and most productive region is that of Mian Kuh, which is also the most elevated, Deh Bala being 7,992 feet, and Masheh, 8,291 feet above sea-level. Kuhistan contains many rich and fertile valleys, well watered by copious streams which are always running. ■ The principal of these are the ’Allabad valley, which extends as far as Taft, the Deh Bala, Tizarjan and Mashed valleys. These are all densely populated and contain numerous gardens and plantations of trees. Habitations .—The people live in flat-roofed houses built of mud, like those in the plains, but the walls and roofs generally have large projecting caves to protect them from the heavy rainfall. Most of the towns are built on the banks of streams. The gardens are frequently unwalled, the terraces, which hill cultivation necessitates, being considered in many cases a sufficient boundary. Population .—The total population numbers about 27,000. The strict seclusion usually practised by Mussalmans as regards the privacy of their houses and wives is not carried out, and the people appear to be a quiet andKUH—KUH eos simple lot, devoid of latent fanaticism. In Taft, Parsis and Muhammadans live peaceably side by side. A large proportion of the population are Babis, or else openly sympathise with them. The greater part of the inhabitants of Masheh belong to this sect. Climate. —The winter, as might be expected in these elevated regions, is very severe, and the inhabitants of the valleys are frequently cut off from all communication with the outside world for days together. The first falls of snow usually take place about the end of November, and the thaw usually set in February. The higher hills are snow-clad until March or April, while the crevasses and ravines of the loftier peaks contain snow and ice all the year round, and supply the city with large quantities during the summer months. During the month of June, the hot weather sets in at Yazd. At this season a large number of the inhabitants leave the city and come up to Kuhistan, where they have gardens and summer houses. Towards the end of September, when the weather becomes cooler, they return to the city. Produce and supplies, etc. —All the supplies of Yazd, such as sheep, fruit, vegetables, firewood and grass come from these hills ; and also the chief water-supply is led from here by qandts. The followbxg are among the products of Kuhistan :— Fruits. Mulberries, white and black, apples, cherries, melons, plums? walnuts, filberts, apricots, greengages, peaches, quinces and grapes. Vegetables.' Potatoes, cabbages, spinach, lettuces, cucumbers, beetroot, radishes, onions and celery. Besides fruit trees there are an abundance of others, chief amongst which are the poplar and the willow. On the hills every sort of shrub is found • while the asafcetida plant provides a lucrative employment to the inhabi tants, who collect the juice which is exported in great quantities to Bombay. Many of the villages and towns contain numerous silk-worms, and in others such as Sanij, one cannot walk a few paces without stumbling over a beehive ; for in this country, with the usual disregard for the safety and convenience of the general public, the hives are all placed on the ground. Minerals. —There are no mines working in the hills, but there are some caves near Taft which are partially artificial, and there are traces of copper ore in places. In the Palangan hills near NarakI, there are marble rocks and traces of iron ore in places. Antimony is found in the Kuh Ardarushk pieces having been picked up on the surface by shepherds ; crystals are found in the hills w T est of Masheh, and there are some celebrated marble mines at Turum Pusht. Game. —The wild sheep, ibex, antelope, leopard, hyaena, wolf, jackal, fox, grey partridge, quail, pigeon, and sandgrouse abound, and the imperial sandgrouse and hare are found on the plateau. Game however is very wild, being much shot at. Water. —There are large streams flowing down from the Deh Bala Tizar- jan, Bavanat and Masheh valleys but such is the dryness of the soil that they totally disappear on the plain west of Sar-i-Yazd. There is sufficient water flowing from the eastern slopes of Kuhistan to form a rapid river, 20 yards broad and 3 feet deep. The streams flowing from the western slopes of the hills are smaller, but contain an ample supply of water ; and the soil also on the plateau to the west appears to contain more water, assprings appear oozing out of the ground in all directions, and wells reach water at a few feet below the surface. The stream at Kal Bal Biz above Mehrfz contains numerous fish, as also do some of those near the city, where the fish run to 2 lbs. in weight. Topography. —The chief and largest towns in Kuhistan are Taft, Nasira- bad, ’Aliabad, Nil, Sanlj, Deh Bala, Tizarjan, Gasheh and Masheh.— {Vaughan, 1890.)

A lofty range in the Pusht-i-Kuh district of Luristan. To the south-west of the Band-i-Nua (the ancient Zagros) is a long ridge commencing near Qasr-i-Shirin and running south-east, called in succession the Sumbuluh Kuh, the Kalajeh Kuh, and vardalan Kuh ; these are all the same range and form the backbone of the mountains. This range is steep and impass able for the greater part of its length, and at its South-east extremity merges in the mountainous country of Pish Kuh, at the head-waters of the Kashgan river. It is crossed on the track between Kirmanshah and Deh Bala by the Vardalan Pass, at an elevation of 6,000 feet between 50 and 60 miles from Kirmanshah. On approaching the range from the Kirmanshah direction, a series of high, parallel ranges, running north-west and south east, are met with. The rock is hard r grey limestone, the strata well marked arid occasionally standing out perfectly vertical. Although stony, the soil is rich, with some fine trees, 30 to 50 feet high and 3 to 4 feet in diameter, usually in the most inaccessible places. Most have been used for firewood. The principal trees are balul oaks, pistachio, hawthorn, and numerous shrubs and undergrowth. In spring time the grass is-rityh and very abund ant. The passage of the Vardalan range is difficult,, but passable for mules and carefully-led horses. Near Charduvar, the valley on the Deh Bala side into which the track emerges, the southern slope is an almost per pendicular sheet of rock extending for a considerable distance. The ridges are very steep with razor-edge summits, and the road might be aptly compared to the track of an ant crawling along the teeth of a large saw.— {Munsell, 1888.) KUH-I-ZALIMI— Lat. Long.

KUR or BAND AMIR— A river of Northern Pars, which rises in the Dinun mountains and flows, south-east to lake Niriz. Its main course in the Chashmeh-i-Durdaneh, and in the upper part of its course it is known as the Asupas and Kam Firuz river. The Kur is joined by the Puru Ab river, 32 miles north of Shiraz, a little above the point where it is crossed by the Pul-i-Khan, a bridge with two main arches of irregular size and shape. The river runs strongly at the bridge, though it is elsewhere slow and deep, about 45 feet broad, with mud banks about 10 feet above the level of the water. It is generally unfordable, and the water fairly good. The river forms a wide, deep pool below the bridge. Eight miles farther down is the famous dam of Asad-ud-Dauleh (circa 970 A. D.), which crosses the river, and upon which stands a bridge of 13 arches, 120 yards in length. From this dam or band, the lower course of the river derives its name of Band Amir. Five more dams obstruct its course and divert its waters before the residue finally reaches the lake. Some 30 odd miles above the Pul-i-Khan, the Kur is dammed by the Band-i-Nasirl, so called from the late Shah, who in 1890 repaired a structure originally erected by the Achsemenian kings, and frequently restored since. The river contains many fish and is the resort of numerous water-fowl.

Most of the water in the Band Amir river is exhausted before it reaches lake Niriz on account of the numerous irrigation channels in this district, which is one of th:s most fertile in the country, producing abundance of rice, barley, wheat, tobacco and some cotton. The cultivation of rice in this plain is inconceivably great, and it is admit ted to be by far the richest and cheapest in the Persian Empire.

It adjoins the village of Kut Suwaiyid, from which it is separated only by small ridge. Detached on the south side at about J of a mile, is a part of the village called Bait Haidar, which is owned by Mirza Hamzeh, the principal Arab agent of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. There is a ferry at Kut ’Abdullah with one small boat.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) ■ KUT ’ABD-USH-SHAH, vide KALEH ’ABD-UL-SHAH. KUTAL-I-DUKHTAR.— Lat. Long. Elev. 4,250'. A pass in Ears over a low range of hills between the Kazarun and ’Abdul plains, on the main post road from Biishire to Shiraz,.about 60 miles fromKUT—KUT 621 the latter. The ascent commences at 9 miles from Kazarun, is gradual for about two miles and then steep for miles, rising 1,500 feet. The path has been carried up a re-entrant, up the steepest face of the rock, and is paved with irregular blocks of stone, worn smooth, which form difficult stepping- stones for animals. A low stone parapet-wall guards the road in places. At the summit of the pass there is a coffee shop, tower, and a reservior which only holds water after rain. It was here that the 39th Central India Horse were attacked by road guards on the 24th December 1911. The descent into the Abdul valley is easy, and only about a mile in length. The pass is a difficult one to tackle from the south-west, and if the tower were strongly held by riflemen, it could not be seized without the help of artillery. The hills on both sides of the path would have to be occupied, and both are very steep, rocky, and difficult to climb. By moving eastwards, however, and crossing the Daria-i-Parishan, nearer to the Lake Famur, where materials for bridging would be necessary, an easier ascent could be found, up to the tower. Once one the top, the whole hill could easily be cleared, from the north-east the pass is easy to take. There is another way of turning the pass, namely, by branching, off the post road at Rahdar, northwards, and proceeding through the Tangi-Chakan, up the valley of the Shapur river past Naudan, and thence to the Abdul valley, or direct to Dasht-i-Arjan over the Mulla Nairu Pass. Th : s road is more than ten miles longer than the road by Kazarun over the Kutal-i-Dukhtar, but is sometimes used by caravans. The path over the Kutal-i-Dukhtar could be much improved by throwing earth over it, and filling in the crevices between the huge boulders. It is not known whether the present alignment could be utilized for camels after improvement. The road was first made by the mother of Imam Quli Khan, Viceroy of Pars, under Shah Abbas, when it was called Kutal-i-Ushanak. At the end of the 18th century it was reconstructed by a merchant, Hap Muhammad Husain of Bushire. About 1820 it was put in repair by Kalb ’Ali Khan, Governor of Kazarun, and earned the name of £ the Simplon of Persia.’ It was again repaired in 1834 by the mother of Timur Mirza, and about 1870 by Mushir-ul-Mulk, Vazir of Pars. Since then (to 1912) it does not seem to have been attended to.— (Thevenot — Rich — Monteith — Deode — Taylor — Clerk—Hardy—MacGregor—Curzon, 1889—Newcomen, 1905—Douglas, 1912.) KUTAL-I-GIASH— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass through which the road runs from Bushire to Kazarun just before it enters the Kazarun plain. From it a fine view of the Shahpur plain can be obtained.— {MacGregor.) KUTAL-I-GULMlRZA— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass between Du Pulan and Ardal, on the road from Isfahan to Shushtar. Elevation about 6,350 feet. A steep descent thence down to Du Pulan Road would require making for carriages. A stream runs below the pass, a feeder of the Karim river.— {Mackenzie.)622 KUT—KUT KCTAL-I-KAMARIJ.— Lat. Long. Elev. 3,100^. A pass in Ears, on the road between Bushire and Shiraz, about 60 miles- from the former. At the foot of the pass there is a singular conformation of long flat-topped hills. Half way up, the road becomes so narrow that laden mules strike their loads against the projecting rocks on either side, unless the loads ride very high ; and except at a few spots, it is impossible for laden mules to pass each other. The path is steep and difficult, and in places obstructed by rocks fallen from the cliffs, which overhang it on the left (west). In places, where it ig carried high above a torrent bed on the right (east), the road has been built up and revetted. Near the top of the pass there is a tea house, and a sulphur spring in a ravine. From here the path descends about 150 feet to Kaniarij, passing a qandt, which is unsuitable for watering animals^ The ascent which commences about 8 miles from Eunar Takhteh, is 2 miles long and takes at least 2 hours to accomplish ; the rise is about 1,200 feet. The path, which is not paved, affords a good foothold for animals, but notwithstanding this, it is very trying for animals owing to the steep climb. The track could be quickly improved because the soil is easy, and it is estimated that it could be made passable for camels in a week by a double company of pioneers. Guns are reported to have been carrjpd across this pass, but in its present state it is impassable for field artillery. If adequately defended, the pass would be very difficult to force unless turned by another road. There is a path sometimes used, which follows the Shapur river, and avoids Kamarij. There are excellent positions for signal ling up the pass. It was on the worst part of this ascent, known as the Kumar (or ledge) of Asa’d Khan, that the Afghan of that name found himself, in 1752, entrapped between the followers of Rustam Sultan, chief of Khisht, hidden in the crags above, and the soldiery of Karim Khan Zand in the valley below, and realized to his cost, the small chance of escape from such a man-trap.— (Ouseley — Monteith—Chesney- — MacGregor — Curzon* — Douglas,) KOTAL-I-MALU— Lat. Long. Elev. 1,800' (?) A pass in Fars about 60 miles from Bushire, on the Bushire-Shiraz post road between Dalaki and Kunar Takhteh. The ascent commences about 8 miles from Dalaki, and zigzagging up in an almost due northerly direction is at first fairly easy. About f of the way up there is a paved causeway, which is slippery, and should be avoided by taking a track to the east of it. This leads to the top of the first part of the pass. After this the track descends some 50 feet, and then leads almost level up the stony bed of a ravine for | a mile. In this ravine there is a spring of good water. From here the final ascent of 200 feet is very steep and difficult. At the top there is a tower and a tea house. The ascent is about 3 miles, rising over 1,000 feet, and occupies from 2 to 3 hours. It is tiring for animals, and horses have to be led. In October 1911, 1,000 animals completed the march from Dalaki to Kunar Takheth (15 miles) in 9| hours. The road could be much improved with a little work, and it is estimated that a double company of pioneers could make it passable for camels in a week. It is impassable for field artillery.KUT—KUT 623 In forcing the pass against opposition it would be necessary to seize both sides, but especially the rocky side on the left (west). The seizure would not be very difficult with the support of mountain guns. It could be turned by following the course of the Shapur river to the west of the hills, but this road is considerably longer. The name Kutal-i-Malu, which means the “ cursed pass ” and was pro bably given by reason of the epithets of ascending travellers, is not always used : other names are sometimes substituted.— {Clerk — Monleitli— M a cGregor—Curzon — Douglas — Hewlett .) KUTAL-I-MUSHGUN— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Ears crossed on the road from Shiraz to Kazarun between Musghun and Garreh.* On the Shiraz side the pass itself is steep, but the road is fairly good and lies nearly throughout on very soft lime. On the Kazarun side the road is more stony perhaps than before, and the descent is sharp and unpleasant.—(.Dwrawd.) KUTAL-I-PlR ZAN— Lat. Long. Elev. 7 500'. A pass in Ears between Abdul and Dasht-i-Arjan, on the Bushire-Shiraz post road, about 50 miles from Shiraz. The ascent of the pass, which commences from the Abdul plain about 6 miles after crossing the Kutal-i- Dukhtar, is steep and stony, up a hillside covered with small trees but is nowhere a defile. After about 2 miles of climb the cdravdvserai of Mian Kutal is reached, which stands on a spur and cannot be seen till one is close to it. If held, it would be difficult to tackle as, though commanded by the hills above it, these could not be reached from the foot of the pass without passing close to Mian Kutal. In case of it being held it would be an advantage to camp the night at Kaluni, as it would be easier to attack from there, and an opportunity would be gained of reconnoitring it. After Mian Kutal the path continues to ascend, and follows the telegraph for a mile when it bifurcates, the old road still following the telegraph line, and the new road keeping to the north. The old road goes over a lower part of the range, along the side of the hill and then down a valley to the plain. It is longer, rougher, and less easy to traverse under opposition than the new road. The latter crosses the range at a point 2 milps to the west of and 200' higher than, the old road. It is comparatively free from stones, in fact after rain owing to the clayey nature of the soil, the descent, which is steep becomes very slippery. The descent by the new^ road is made direct to the Dasht-i-Arjan, and is commanded the whole way from the top of the pass. The pass which is about 6 miles long, is less arduous than the other passes on this road, and it is thought that field artillery could be got .across wit h the aid of drag ropes. The pass is covered with snow in winter which increases the existing difficulties, but does not entirely block the road Curzon mentions that “ the pass could be avoided by striking the hills 9 miles to the east, wiiere they dip into the Dasht-i-Arjan,” but this path is not identifiable, unless it means to the west, and the Kaleh Abdul and Mulla Nairu passes are indicated. These afford an alternative route.
