P.Z.1580/35. JViy dear Powle^ L X enclose copy of a memorandum surrmarising the correspondence between hylles and the A.P.O.C. between 26th February ana 3rd March, which was left with me by Lefroy on 5th March, we discussed the points arising on the various articles with the following result; Article 1 . No comment, except that it seems desirable that both the A.P#O.C. and the India Office shoula see the redraft. Article 2 . The Sheikh’s suggestion that the period must turn upon the financial terms is, of course, a matter of bargaining. Article 3 . Reports on demand. I gather that the Company see no objection. Article 4 . Royalty basis to be won and saved as in previous draft. This is the same point as arose in the/ COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL The Hon'ble Lt.Col. T,G. Fowle, C.B.E., Bush ire.Article 12/ 3 Article 7. There need he no Question of any Government pressure in regard to the acquisition of land, etc. I gather that the Company see no special difficulty about agreeing to reversion to the sheikh, free of cost, of land, etc. surplus during the period of the agreement. Article 8. Artesian wells. I understand from Lefroy that the A#P*0«C# think it very unlikely that wells if sunk will produce fresh water. But here again I gather that the point is not one of vital importance and that they are likely, if the Sheikh presses the matter, to agree to his request. Article 9. i gather that no special difficulty arises over this. Article 10 . imports to he free, hut right to re-export oo he covered hy a special payment additional to royalty. This, I gather, will he a bargaining point, and attention is invited in connection with it to the Sheikh* s demands in respect of Article 15 as set out in the summary of the telegram from Qatar dated 2nd torch in the A«P*O.C„ summary. Article 11 . I understand that the A.P#0.C. see no special difficulty about this.4 fT Article 12 , This proviso that transferee companies shall Pe subject to approval by the Sheikh, coupled with the intimation on the same Article in the telegram from Qatar of 2nd March that only one subsidiary company will be permitted, is, I gather,, taken rather seriously oy the A.P#O.C., who are, of course, bound to transfer to the IfP*C« any concession which they may obtain. The question was not discussed in any detail with Lefroy, but I gathered they have in mind the possibility of establishing a Qatar oil company which would be a subsidiary of the I.P.C, and to which the concession could be transferred to be worked, with the Sheikh’s approval, once it had been obtained by the A*P.O*C, Article 15 . I gather that the Company have in mind a variation of the Sheikh’s counter suggestion on this to the effect that termination will be possible only within three years of the date of the agreement (which is, of course, a very different thing from the date of the commencement of operations). I pointed this out to Lefroy, but did not go beyond that in our conversation. The sheikh can be relied on to look after his own interests on this. Article 14 . It seems desirable that both we and the A.P*Q.C# should see the redraft, though if if is a redraft/5 'redraft without alteration of the sense' no special difficulty need he anticipated. Article 15 , I gather that the Company agree. Article 16 of telegram of 16th February, From the telegram of 28th February you will see that the sheikh has now agreed to the retention of the reference to the Political Resident. Article 1 7. The company, I gather from Lefroy, do not at all like this and feel that if the sheikh is to be at liberty to disapprove of 'any employee' and if the Company are thereupon to be bound to dismiss him, they may find themselves in a difficult position, I said that here, as elsewhere, it seemed desirable for the Company, if they wished to get this concession, to meet the Sneikh on all points that were not entirely fundamental,_but that possibly they might think it worth while asking lylies to get a rather clearer definition from the sheikh of the precise type of employee to whom he wished to he in a position to object. He might wish for a completely free hands he might, on the other hand, be chiefly concerned to be able to object to individual Arabs or other native employees. I gather that the Company will probably do this. Article 18/I7 - 6 - Article 18 . Here, as in the case of Articles 1 and 14, it seems desirable that and the A*P,O.C. should see the redraft, so as to* ensure that there is in fact no alteration of sense. Article 21 . As the result of discussion with the Company it has already been agreed that as the sheikh apparently knows only Arabic and has nobody in his service who has a fluent knowledge of English, there are special reasons for allowing the Arabic text to prevail. 2. Question of local refinery . The demand for a local refinery (which would have been very acceptable to the Admiralty) appears to have been dropped (compare telegram of 28th February on Article 16 from Qatar). 3. Telegram from qatar of 2nd March , Article 11 . I said to Lefroy that tha Company, under the terms of this article, were already required to pay the wages of the guards who were to be appointed in consultation with the sheikh; that the sheikh under the terms of his Treaty was precluded from obtaining arms, save with the approval of H.M.G,, but that H#M*G. would raise no objection to arms (after consultation with the Political Resident), being imported in sufficient quantities to equip the guards, but for no other purpose, so long as this/this was done through the proper channels. Article 15. I gather that the Company see no difficulty about force, majeure involving delay of operations in Qauar only. V/e see no objection to payment in rupees. The question of annual payments in addition to royalty to cover exemption from customs duties, etc. and the right to re-export is a matter for bargaining. 4. As regards the substantial gift, I gather (though Lefroy will not probably wish to be quoted) that rumours, which are thought to emanate from Holmes, have been spread locally, the most moderate of which is to the effect that the Sheikh of Koweit received 45,000 rupees as a personal gift on the conclusion of his contract, and that this has sent up the sheikh of Qatar’s demands. The Company are, it appears, prepared to consider a substantial gift rather on lines. 5* It is most satisfactory that the Company /&lt;Lv&lt; ^ L should/obtain/an extension of the option until 4th May. 6. The Company appear to be a good deal disturbed about Holmes* alleged contacts with the sheikh. Lefroy mentioned (again I am not sure that he will wish to be quoted) that it had been ascertained through the local postal authorities that a letter addressed by Holmes to the sheikh had been received in Qatar and that other letters/9 - 8 - letters addressed to the Sheikh had been received from Mohamed Yat/im. They attach great importance to preventing him from visiting Qatar if ? as hyiles remarks in his telegram, 'repetition of the Koweif experience is to he avoided'. 7. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Political Agent, Bahrein and to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, J.G.LAIIHWAITE.A 10 i rorii Q,au r 9 N o , 2, 26th February .

INDIA OFFICE , CONFIDENTIAL&gt; Note of discussion at tne India Office with A.P.Q.C., regarding Persian G,ulf oil questions, on Thursday, 10th January 1935. Mr. Walton and I saw Mr. Lefroy of the A.P.O.C. and Mr. iylles to-day. a. qatar Oil . The Company f s representatives said that Mr. Ivylles was prohahly returning to qatar hy the air mail 0 'f the 22nd January to resume negotiations with the sheikh. Mr. Ivy lies thought that there was a reasonable chance of agreement with the sheikh and did not think there was any risk of the sheikh negotiating with other parties within the period of the option which he had grantee to the A.P.O.C. j though he had reason to believe that overtures of an unofficial character continued to be made to him by the Hasa Oil Company. The intermediary for such overtures was understood to be sheikh Nazir, a brother of the Sheikh, resident in Hasa. 3. Mr. Lefroy said that the company were anxious(Ta) to secure the concurrence of H.M.G. in certain modifications in the dihit of the qatar oil concession dated L5th October 1934 (copies of which have been circulated to the interested departments); andjTb) to reach agreement as to the doe-ioi^-^a^^garr^-to- map to be attached to any concession granted. Va. 4. As regards trie first of these points, the amendments which they desired were the following;- ch preamble, line 7 . For 'lawful heirs' substitute 'successors'’. &amp; (H) Article 4 (c)(a) After 'royalty' insert 'per ton (aa4Q English pounds)'. 4b (&amp;■£ Article 4 (c)(3) After 'royalty' insert 'per thousand cubic feet'. $ (f-V) Article 10, sub-para. 1, line 5 . ilfter 'lorries' insert 'aircraft'.

Insert rt Tiie terms year, month, day, as used in this Agreement refer to the solar calendar of England and to no other 1 '. 5. The Company’s representatives were informed after discussion that no objection was seen to alterations I, II, m and IV above; V, having regard to the terms of the treaty between H.L.G. and Qatar and to the correspondence which had passed on this subject, was also unobjectionable. As for VI, it was not quite clear whether the proviso had been inserted in the interests,of the Company or of , but in view of the arbitration provisions of Article 16 no objection was seen to accepting the Company’s proposal. No objection was seen to VII. *s regards VIII, the Company explained that the Sheikh conducted no banking transactions and liked his payments in cash. He would not welcome a reference to a bank, (the reference had been inserted by the Company in the hope that it might facilitate dealings with the sheikh). It was agreed that if this was the case there was no point in pressing for the inclusion of the Article, no objection was seen to IX. As regards X, it was impressed on the Company that it was in their interest as well as to some extent that of H.L.G. that provision should be made that the English/English text shoula prevail. They replied | | that the Sheikh of Qatar nad very strongly | urged that he knew no English himself, nad no one in his State who knew English and did not employ for hanking or for other purposes anyone with a knowledge of English. It was felt that in these circumstances there was some justification for his request and the Company were informed that if they found it impossitle to secuie nis m acceptance of the Article as drafted they might assume our concurrence in their redraft. No objection was seen to XI. The object of the alteration was to , prevent contusion owing to the use of a lunar calendar Toy the ihe-t-hn. 6. The company undertook to furnish a revised text of the agreement. 1. As regards the second point referred to in paragraph 3 above, the Company referred to the map produced by the A.P.O.C. geologists (copies of which/were circulated in February 1934), which showed a southern boundary for Qatar which had been indicated to the geologists by the Sheikh himself on the ground. The company were anxious to know whether this boundary was satisfactory to H.M.G. for the purposes of the nap to be appended to any agreement under the5. flvC &lt;^c*~3S*~** / bearing structure and Ibn 3aud was/^anxious to include tbe whole of it in his territory( while the Sheikh was not prepared to accept his view and claimed that his boundary ran either as shown in his map or south of it to Salwa. The Company were informed that the important thing seemed to be the limit of their concession, which need not necessarily be identica^-with--the boundaries' of the Sheikh*s territories recognised by h.M.G. or of any protection which they might give to him. It would, however, be necessary to examine the limit which they were anxious to fix with the other interested U-Ur*, Departments. Th-er agreed in these M.s circumstances ta furnish copies of a map showing the suggested boundary and -it wao that endeavours should be made to let them have a decision before Mr. ivy lies* s departure trim for Qatar on 22nd January. The point was important as it would be necessary to attach the map to the concession^ut forward to the sheikh. 8 . Mr. Mylies, in conclusion, was asked what difficulties in particular he anticipated with the Sheikh. He replied that the main difficulty would, of course, be finance. The sheikh, on the other hand, was also suspicious of references to the Political Resident or of suggestions of closer control by H.M.G. The Company could see no alternative to the reference to the Political Resident in Article 16 of/6. 10/ of tliQ draft or they would have suggested one. But it might he that there would he difficulty on this point. The Company were given no reason to hope that h.M.G. would accept any modification of tne draft on this point. 9 * Kuwait-Neutral Zone, for. Lcfruy&gt; enquired what the present po^itionwas in regard to the Nejitra^zone and was inf ormedthat^so far as we were aware it hevi'-~-unrC4~io*ng''ed■ ——iiati they ^any'~news*&gt; Mr. uefroy said that the Company had no further information as to developments in the Neutral Zone. He was informed that H.M.G. were unaware of how matters at present stood, hut that Mr. Jansen, Jnr. had some time ago intimated that the Arabian Development syndicate, who retained an active interest in this question, were endeavouring to follow up their earlier negotiations, hut would, if they secured a concession, he prepared to transfer it to the A.P.Q.C. on reasonable terms, e.g. something corresponding to out of pocket expenses plus an understanding about royalty. The ■C4» Companyjpere informed that no difficulties were seen about giving tnem this information, as there had been no suggestion that it was confidential eumernaiAr to h^ thCXfahian D r v r-H p7 10* ki • Lefroy, a-Xter furtjlier ciiscussion, enquired whether H.M.G. would see any objection to the despatch of an I.p.c* geologist or representative to endeavour to secure from the Sheikh of Koweit an understanding in respect of the Neutral Zone corresponding to that which was understood to have been reached between Ibn 3aud and the Standard Oil. He was informed that prima facie we saw no objection to action on these lines, which, indeed, closely corresponded to what had previously been discussed with the A.F.Q.C., but he was invited to make a proposal for consideration in writing. 11. Oil in abu Dhabi , id*, Lefroy referred to the fact that, with the approval of facilities had been given to an A.P.Q.C. geologist to assist the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi by sinking wells, an operation in the course of which he might have some opportunity of assessing the oil possibilities of tills area. The geologist who had been sent was interested in what - haor - 1 a k on -pfee-ef The discovery of petroliferous strata in Bahrein (coupled with the probability that there was a valuable petroliferous strataSTin Hasa and in the Jebel D^uk^h in Qatar) had led to increased interest in th: *ea. what would be our attitude towards the despatch (U of am American exploratory geologist.who had now been attached to the with a small party, to conduct further researches in Abu Dhabi?8 . 1£. Mr. Lefroy was informed that we were very anxious to facilitate the taste of the British element in the I.P.C. of establishing themselves in these areas. But we should not at all welcome the U (£. Ct^*k desp^tchfOT an American, or of any ioreigner. As he and Mr. Mylles were aware j even hnglisn nationals were not at present allowed into the Trucial States except in quite exceptional circumstances. To send down an American geologist, following especially on the establishment of the standard Oil in Rasa and in Bahrein 3 mightPTery^well prejudice their negotiations with the .Sheikh of Qatar and might leave on the local in-habitants the impression that the Americans were tSSSSS of real importance. Would they in these circumstances consider, even though it might cause them inconvenience, finding an English geologist to do the work? If so, no obstacles would be placed in his way and he would be given all facilities. The Company would appreciate the political considerations involved ; and the fact that the alternative for H.M.C. to allowing feiadgn (TTSvelopment these areas ^was to close them (as had been their policy hitherto) for purposes of oil development to all parties. Mr. Lefroy undertook to consider the matter further. 5AiXic-L' /-vn ivany triaxiics lor your D.O.USb- i of 10th Deceuiber about clauses 4 ana b of tile a tar oil concession ani i^ygd?^ Government /^reeiuent.

CW, ^ ^ W ‘ 1 % Please refer to the Qatar Oil Concession Draft Government Agreement received under India Office Printed Letter No * 1786/34 . 1803/34 2. Clauses 4 and 5 make a reference to a political representative of His Majesty's Government in ^atar if and when such a representative is appointed. I dare say that for some time at least there will be no representative actually at Qatar and if he is appointed he should I think be an Assistant Political Agent under Bahrain. Moreover one of the reasons for creating the post of Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain was that he could make frequent tours to Qatar in order to deal with oil questions on the spot. 3. Under the Clauses quoted above neither the Political Agent Bahrain nor the Assistant Political Agent come officially into the picture, though in fact the Political Agent - and on his behalf the Assistant Political Agent - will be the political officer who, under my general control, should deal with Qatar Oil matters. 4. The Company having agreed to the Government Agreement - vide letter dated the 10th October 1334 from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Ltd. to you 6327/34 of 19th October 1934) - 1 do not think that it is necess ary to open this question with them. As Qatar has been for / J.G.Laithwaite Esquire, The India Ofxice, London■4 ' - 2 - bo for many years under the political control of the Political Agent Bahrain, when and if the Company succeed in getting' their oil concession, and we succeed in getting the Shaikh to agree to the Government Agreement, we can inform the Company and the Shaikh that His Majesty's Government's representative for ^atar is in fact the Political Agent Bahrain (assisted hy the Assistant Political Agent) under the general control of the Resident, and that while we do not intend hampering either the Company or the Shaikh by insisting that local relations between the Chief Local Representative and the Qatar Authorities shall be conducted through the Political Agent, who is at some distance away at Bahrain, nevertheless we expect that the Company will keep the Political Agent informed on all important matters connected with their local relations with the Qatar Authori_ ties.

Yours sincerely, J.G. LAlTHWAITEo4 An' 1 -' . ’v' V J. G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.l vfd &amp; Dear Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter of the 1st December about the Qatar oil concession, under reference P. Z,7512/34 . Letters we have recently exchanged c 1 e ar upl^thinlc what misunderstanding may have existed between us. I now see your point that in principle the altered wording in Article 10 of our draft of^the 25 th October is 'much more restrictive', but from the practical point of view from which alone we looked at it it was in our view no more restrictive than the draft ofHBhe 13 th March 1934 and had the same meaning. Under the March draft we considered that we were liable for Company imports for the personal use of its employees, but the Company in practice imports nothing for the personal use of its employees for which they do not pay. It is simply our experience elsewhere which led to the suggestion from one of our staff recently returned from Persia of a rewording to render impossible claims recently made in that country by the Customs officials. - — RC W WEEKLY LETTER £W gh sao&amp;ei 934 ., 0 H°- 61i r ... RV po_h.-' u from c Eca- ■ ' ’ . { y iK ofiiS&gt; SEOR-i - COPY SENT EY AIR MAIL o f 1 4 DEC 1934Among several instances I can quote that o± coir matting imported solely for placing under neath 10,000 ton tanks, which Customs have argued might be used for the dirty feet of our employees and therefore was dutiable as an article imported for their personal use. Since you explained in your letters of the 15 th and 26th November the existing and prospective restrictions on that avaricious Shaikh*s powers of taxing British employees, the position appears quite changed as a practical question. As I have explained to you, since our redraft of the 25 th October, what our previous experience has frightened us of is not 5 ^ duties, but such situations as now exist in Persia, where for example an oil heating stove brought to Abadan at a c.i.f. cost of 17 /I 0 d. costs if landed f^.ll.Q, and an oil cooker with a c.i.f. cost of £ 7 . 7.5 costs £25*14.5 landed. If you had ever had to do work outside in such a country, you would again appreciate the difficulty of producing contentment in the staff with beer at a cost of 2 / 6 d. or more a bottlel In view therefore of the prospect of import duties of 5 ^ or thereabouts, we should be ready to take the risk of any misinterpretation of the wording of Article 10 in this respect as it stood in the draft of the 15 th March last. Yours sincerely.p,—^— f '*mm**' Mr. Walton, To see.

W dear Gilbert, I see from Lefroy*s letter of November 19th to you, of which you sent us a copy in your Printed Letter No• P#z, 7118/34 of November 20tii, that he suggests that the sheikh Of ^atar has no intention of undertaking any serious negotiations with the A.P.ChC. for the Qatar oil concession pending the completion of the negotiations for the concession in Koweit. d. Had the position in Koweit really been as favourable as we recently imagined when we were informed that only minor points were outstanding between the sheikh and the Koweit Oil Company, this might not have been a very disquieting statement. But in view of our new information as to the Sheikh's commitments to the Hunting group, it seems to me that this indication of the attitude of the Shaikh of Qatar towards the A*P«0*C. is extremely unsatisfactory. o. X am not quite sure what action you are contemplating regarding the sheikh of Koweit 1 s commitments to the Hunting group, but I am inclined to think that what Lefroy says about the Sheikh of Qatar makes it very desirable that a decision should oe reached with the least possible delay. 4. As you know I have long felt that our position towards these Sheikhs is anomalous and may at any moment become impossible. These latest developments suggest that we ought perhaps to reconsider the whole question of our relations nou only with the Sheikh of Koweit, but with the Sheikh of Qatar also.

The draft of the 25 th October as C read it appears to give you all the satisfaction ^ou want in requiring a liability on the Company to J)ay import duties both on food supplies and on merchandise etc. imported by it for sale to its e mployee s. As I pointed, out in my letter of the 1st “November, we reworded the draft of the 13 th March • but without altering in any way its sense - in order to avoid future claims that the Company was liable to duty on goods or materials imported purely for Company purposes, for example geological expeditionary equipment, which is issued to geologists from store and taken back into store on their return, against which we have elsevdiere experienced claims that such material was dutiable.67 - 2 - In our view the goods on which the Company should be exempt are those which are imported as' the property of the Company and remain the property of the Company; goods on which the Company is dutiable are foodstuffs and goods imported by~ the Company directly for its employees, and in which the Company does not retain property but hands over the goods to the employees against payment. In Persia until the duties became perfectly prohibitive large quantities of goods were so imported for our employees and the normal duties paid. The distinction we make is very definitely as to whether goods are ft on charge' against an employee or the personal property of an employee. As you have not told me in what respect the wording of Article 10 in the draft of 25 th October, as explained in my letter of the 1st November, is objectionable, I hope that this explanation will clear up the question. I cannot read into our redrafted Article 10 any attempt at avoiding any of the duties for which you are suggesting that the Company should be liable. Yours sincerely.l H*** j Mr. Waiton, * Mr. Letroy*s letter of 19th November brings to notice one slightly disturbing fact vvnich has hitherto been overlooked, viz. that tne sheikh of Qatar’s Treaty is personal to himself and does not in terms bina his heirs ana successors. The point was never raised or referred to in the discussions of 1913-1915 which culminated in the present Treaty, and there is nothing to show why in this instance we departed from our general practice. Tne fact that the position of the present sheikh was somewhat uncertain at the date of the Treaty is haraly a sufficient reason, ana the most probable explanation is perhaps oversight. In practice we should, 1 imagine, recognise a particular successor and require him, as a condition of recognition, to accept the obligations contained in the Treaty of 1916 in return for a reciprocal acceptance of the obligations which, under that Treaty, fall upon ana we might then enaeavour to modify the Treaty so that the reciprocal obligations accepted under it shall apply not only to the huler, but to his ’’heirs and successors”. 2 /7/ &amp;. The point is of importance because on the existence of the Treaty hangs our whole position as regards control of the grant of oil concessions by the Sheikh; the alienation of land; the acceptance of a Political Agent, etc. If the Qatar oil concession goes through we shall be undertaking a new ana specific obligation to tne Sheikh as regards protection by land and we could, if necessary, make this an excuse for suggesting a revision of the Treaty of 1916, in the course of which the obligations undertaken by the two H.C.P. would be expressed as extending to tne Sheikh’s heirs ana successors,(am it might be possible even to make some play with tne concession which an extension of the benefits of the Treaty^ represented on our parti But on the whole I am still rather apprehensive of the Sheikh’s reaction to any suggestion of revision. He might well make difficulties over the clauses about slavery and the right to appoint a British representative, which we have hitherto refrained from enforcing. For the moment I propose, if you agree, to reply to Mr. Lefroy as in the draft below. But we must bear/1 2 - 3 - tear the Treaty point In mind ana might consider It furtner when the negotiations have reached a more advanced stage. ZZ' ^4*— ' Draft Paper. P^ ni! political Department.

A Thank you for your letter of the 15 th November regarding Qatar oil, under reference p.z.6792/54. The information you give as to the limitation to 5 / ad valorem of the duties which this Shaikh at least may levy on foodstuffs which we might import entirely alters the picture. It is not 5^ duties that we are frightened of on food, but the 255 $ 01, more which we have experienced elsewhere. I see little protection from our point of view in any provision that customs dues shall not exceed those levied on Qatar subjects, because our experience elsewhere again has been that our food and other private requirements are not those required by the inhabitants of the countries in which we work, and it is therefore very simple to introduce taxation involving no discrimination in principle but an unbear able burden in practice. If the Shaikh T s Treaty of 1916 is to bind him and his successors during the currency of a possible concession, we should not ask for reconsideration of duties on foodstuffs. I hope that you will not make water similarly dutiable, as I have just heard from Qatar that virtually all the springs there are ,T straight Epsom salts'!■ r v - 2 - I agree with your view as to the likelihood of the Shaikh being familiar with the provisions of the Kuwait Agreement. We have every reason to believe that he is closely informed of every step there, and that he has no intention of any serious negotiations pending the completion of the Kuwait negotiations. I am glad that such variations as were effected in the draft dated 25th October are accept able to you. I enclose another six copies of the draft. Our geological party should by now I think be in Qatar, and Mylles will begoing there this month to have a look at them and at the Shaikh, but does not anticipate as I said any serious discussions, since during Hamadai^ the Shaikh proposes to retire to an inaccessible part of the desert and will be prepared to hold discussions only during the night season. Yours sincerely.— sSV CJ M.02145/34. My dear L^ithwaite, I write to let you know that the A&lt;3miralty have agreedjto accept in the Qatar Government Agreement a 'refinery clause' similar to that in the Koweit Agreement• We understand that there will be no difficulty about pre-emption clauses on the Koweit model, I am sending a similar letter to Starling at the Petroleum Department.

If the Company are prepared to insert an exemption payment, on the same lines as were followed in X- Koweit, we should be quite ready to accept the modified wording which you now suggest, and to exempt food supplies from duty, but failing this we fear we must hold to the existing draft. Will you let me know your views about this? I may point out, as regards the rates of duty, that Article 6 of the Sheikh’s Treaty of 1916 provides that n the customs dues on goods of British merchants imported into Qatar shall not exceed those levied on my own subjects on such goods and shall not in any case exceed dfo ad valorem . British goods shall be liable to the payment of no other dues or taxation of any amount whatsoever beyond those already specified'. This, as you will see, constitutes a substantial protection for the Company against any attempt on the Sheikh’s part to raise his duties to an unreasonable figure. It is,however, froma quite different standpoint also relevant in this connection that there can he little question that the Sheikh will he familiar with the provisions of the Koweit Agreement, and that any marked difference between its terms and those of the concession which he is asked to accept may give rise to difficulty. We agree to the redraft of Article 14 and the omission of the words 'at any L/ime 1 • As regards the penultimate paragraph of your letter, \uu L'iinnlrh nti ~1 i pr^ 1 f r r |bhat the words 'in accordance with Your Excellency’s Treaty obligations' should he inserted in the letter referred to in paragraph 2 of your letter to me. cf 10th October. shpiVo- La- -Treaty wi Hi II.M.Q. fs—a' public one and as it is already proprose to inform him in the letter that the Agreement is subject to the approval of H.M.G. we do not see that the addition of the words in question need be embarrassing from the Company’s standpoint. But if Mylles in the light I of his discussions with the Sheikh feel^ / strongly when the time comes for the conclusion of the Agreement that their insertion might lead to difficulty with the Sheikh, we should then be 'epared to fsgree to their omission. —— hj* ^ I Ca*s~&lt;L^ j/iaa. lr\ w fvA-&lt;v^oC (-SIaA*-7 (Aa If** &gt;€&gt; VtA ^ J.

V 1^1 • v Dear Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter of the l 8 th October, (P.Z. 6527/54), about Qatar oil. On that letter and our conversation on the 20th October I have had a redraft made of the last draft dated l^th March, and enclose six copies, dated 25 th October 1954&gt; of the redraft of the concession. I have marked on one of these copies the passages or wording different from the last draft dated l^th March 1954, which are as follows: Preamble . Mylies 1 name is substituted for Chisholm 1 s. Article 6 . In accordance with the suggestion in paragraph (l)‘ of your letter, the following words / have been added at the end of the 3 rd paragraph: 'and in times of national emergency the Shaikh shall have full use, free of charge, of the Company r s wireless and telegraph installations and railways for governmental purposes'. 1 C ik&lt;31 - 2 - » In the hope of obviating cLIfficnlties actually ©xperienced. slsewhepe^ we have re?/orded the last sentence of the first para graph. In Persia it has even been claimed that 9 such articles as medical supplies and geological expeditionary equipment, for example, are imported for or applicable to the personal use of employees, and are, therefore, dutiable. As you will see, we propose to restrict the dutiable category to articles sold to employees for their personal use - with the exception of food supplies, all imports of which will be liable to duty. Considering the desert nature of the country we still feel this to be a harsh requirement of H.M.G., and we feel it unreasonable to place in the hands of a Shaikh notorious for his cupidity the power to make the ordinary amenities of life for Europeans unattainable by reason of excessive duties which affect strangers only. We hope that you will reconsider this point and remove your insistence on its offer to the Shaikh. &gt;1*7 n' Article 14 . The third paragraph of the draft of l^th March has been deleted in agreement 1 / with you; it is to be covered as in Kuwait by an exchange of letters. For purposes of construction the article / has been divided into two clauses of which (b) covers ^ the point in paragraph ( 2 ) of your letter of the l 8 th October. It was felt here that this division of the article into two clauses gave undue stress to the words T, at any time n in the opening phrase of the articleA ■ - 3 - To avoid misinterpretation, and since the occasions on which the Shaikh can terminate the agreement are clearly defined, we have deleted those three words. Article 16 . In consequence of the new 7 reference to default in Article 14(b) it became necessary to insert a default clause in the arbitration provisions. A paragraph on the lines of the Kuwait draft has been added at the end of the article. Article 21 of the draft of 15th Ma rch. This has been omitted from the present draft, and is to be covered by an exchange of letters. With reference to the suggestion in paragraph ( 5 ) of your letter under reply, we would pray you excuse us from adding 'in accordance with your Excellency f s Treaty obligations' to the letter which is to be handed to the Shaikh when the Concession is signed. We feel that it is not for us to remind in writing such a Potentate of treaty obligations towards another State, and you promised to reconsider this point. As I told you, Mylles will be instructed to remind verbally the Shaikh of the common knowledge as to his treaty obligations regarding concessions in handing him the letter. We are sending copies of this draft of 25 th October to Abadan shortly, with the reservation that our instructions as to negotiations may still be subject to understandings with His Majesty*s Government at this end, though you will doubtless have learned that the Kuwait refinery provisions are now acceptable to the Admiralty for Qatar. The negotiations are not going to be easy, I fear.' \ jf Q jf 1 Ml 25£h_0ctgber A _!92i• COMERCIAL AGREEMENT. v--\ ry , -v / U . .. , ' ; / L ^ r.

Our negotiator (C.C.Mylles, who is well known to Colonel Fowle) has liberty to reopen negotiations in Qatar at the earliest convenient^date and to^sign a concession agreement with the Shaikh on the lines of the draft dated l^th March 1934, of which you had copies, with the excision of the last paragraph ,f If the Company this Agreement ’ 1 of Article 14 and the whole of Article 21 (see 4 below)* Subject to 2. Mylles on reaching the stage of signature mu«t sien ad referendum by handing to the Shaikh with the signed concession a letter worded effectively as follows itj have signed this agreement on behalf of mv Company on the understanding that it is subject to the approval of H.M.G. Tf fc-v O i f / a ’!Thereafter copies of the concession agreement as signed and the signed letter are to he sent to the Political Resident, who will take up with the Shaikh the question of the ^Government Agreement ,r which is to he a condition of H.M.G. ! s approval of the concession agreement. That agreement in the form of the draft sent with Walton f s letter of the 16th March last is acceptable to us with Clause 9 worded as in the Kuwait agreement, hut is not to he signed hy us^prior to^the conclusion of the concession agreement with the Shaikh. ^ 4 . The Political Resident will exchange with the Shaikh letters similar in effect to those exchanged between the Political Agent at Kuwait and the k-haiKh of Kuwait on the 2 Jrd May 19^4 (C.I 89 ) and 26 th May 19M (R.4/1519), and this will cover the excision of the last paragraph of Article 14 and the whole of Article 21 referred to in (l) above. On receiving your confirmation of our under standing we shall he in a position to send Mylles definite instructions as to his negotiations in Qatar. Yours sincerely.—___ I— ™ 1 /V ===== , -SC OCT 1 !*'^ i ' ) / ; ' &lt; V 1 nd 96 i ' HOTS . | !■ . 1 ! - :•J : ^ Mr. Fraser, Mr. Gas si', and Mr.* Xefroy of tlxe Anglo- Persian Oil Company called at the India Of!ice on 10th October to discuss the question of the Q,atr oil concession. Mr. Walton, Mr. Laithwaite, Mr. Cromhie and Colonel Fowle were present at the meeting. Mr. Fraser said that, except for the question of the Refining Clause, the terms of the Political Agreement had now been agreed between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. With regard to refining, he had been in correspondence with the Admiralty and hoped that a settlement was now in sight and that this would be on the lines of the Refining Clause in the Koweit Political Agreement. The Admiralty were disappointed that he was unable to go farther than this, but it was impossible to get the foreign constituents of the I.P.C. to agree to anything more. He explained that the Shell Company had one Butch and one British Director while similarly the American interests in the I.P.C. had one American and one British Director. Turning to the commercial negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatr, Hr. Fraser said that these would continue to he carried on by Mr. Mylles in whom he had every confidence who would have a Power of Attorney from the Company to conclude an agreement with the Sheikh. The question decided was the most suitable time for introducing the Political Agreement into the negotiations. Should a representative of H.M.G. approach the Sheikh and clear this question up now or would it be better for the Commercial Agreement to be settled first? Mr. Walton, Mr. Laithwaite end Colonel Fowl a all agreed that it would be best that the Commercial Agreement should be settled first and Colonel . , +Vie+ +1115 Agreement should be ^ V Fowle suggested that this Ag j ^**7 r2%hi- s iKuaSTSSThave an subject to the approval of H.M.G. unfavourable reaction on the Sheikh. In reply to an /’■'ill '1 tT /!€&gt;( 2 . enquiry from Mr* Fraser, lie explained tliatjas in tlie case of Koweit, the Sheikh of Q,atr mas precluded hy his treaty obligations with H.M.G. from giving a concession without their approval* Mr* Walton recalled that in the Koweit concession there had at first been a clause linking the Commercial and the Political Agreements, but that this had finally been taken out of the Commercial Agreement and put in an Exchange of Notes. Colonel Fowle suggested that the Sheikh of q,atr might say that he was prepared to sign the Commercial Agreement but that before actually signing he would like to see the terms of the Political Agreement, or, alternatively, that he might sign the Commercial Agreement and leave it to the Company's negotiator to explain that the Agreement must be subject to the approval of H.H.G. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that it would be best, if possible, to get the Sheikh to sign subject to the approval of H.M.G. without mentioning the Political Agreement. It was finally agreed that the most suitable procedure would be that, simultaneously with the signature of the Commercial Agreement, there should be an exchange of letters between the Sheikh and the Company to the effect that the Agreement had been signed'sub j ect to the Sheikh's treaty obligations to H.M.G.' There would thus be no necessity for any reference to the Political Agreement in the concession and the Sheikh need not know that the terms of the Political Agreement had in fact been agreed in advance between H.M.G. and the Company. H.M.G. would then produce the Political Agreement for the parties to sign and. subject to this, would^ give their consent to the concession, the Sheikh simultaneously sending a letter to the Political Agent agreeing that the Commercial Agreement would be subject to the terms of the Political Agreement. The negotiations would thus be concluded by four sets of documents: (a) the Commercial Agreement, exchange of letters between the Company ona (h) an3. the Sheihh; (c) the political Agreement; and (d) an exchange of letters between the Sheikh and H.M.G* that there was still /t Mr. Wanton reminded the Coja^any another srtjiai political question outstanding, viz. the question of the channel of correspondence to be employed between the Sheikh tjni the Company if and when ijn oil concession was obtained. He explained that H.M.fit had at present no permanent representative at qatr anjd that communications would probabtLx-’h'ave to pass through the P^itdcal Agent at Bahrein. At the end of the meeting Mr. Lefroy rema i ^ e ^ t ^ t ^ it had been clear during thejprevious negotiations^that the latter was maintaining very close contact with the Standard Oil Company in Hasa end that he was also fait_with the situation in regard to the Koweit Oil negotiations. He expressed the opinion that if the Kuwait Oil Companyj&gt;btained their concession at Koweit, the position at ftatr would be much more favourable to the Company. ■ H n ' 'ft ^ ft / f ■Hr.

Mr. Hearn has already suggested that another meeting at the India Office will he desirable in order to settle all outstanding points in the draft Q,atr Government Agreement.

The Admiralty are prepared in principle to accept a letter such as that suggested by Mr. Agnew at the meeting on the 21st March. you will remember that it was arranged that he should communicate direct with us, tout we have heard nothing at all and I think it is a reasonable inference that his suggestion did not meet with the approval of his Angle-Persian colleagues, especially as the proposals now put forward bear a strong family likeness to the Koweit formula. The Admiralty attitude remains muph the same as it ?/as in March, namely , that we think that H.M• Government could reasonably expect a greater concession Walton, Esq. from10=1 from the Company at Qatar than at Koweit, having regard to the very considerable lengths they are prepared to go to secure the former concession for the company. We do not feel, therefore, that we can accept Hearn’s present proposals and we think that it is for the Company (who have apparently 'ratted' from Agnew’s proposal) to suggest something more nearly comparable to this proposal than the colourless clauses no?/ put forward.

Dear Laithwaite, Thanks for your letter of the 50th inst., P.Z. 4758/54. I await your further communi cation as to when we can have a talk on the Qatar situation. I have no doubt that when we come together it will take very little time to arrive at a complete understanding, - provided al ways that the Admiralty, with a due sense of perspective, will not make matters difficult with respect to the question of refining.

He thinks that the right course is to proceed as in the case of Koweit. viz, H.M.O. and the Company to conclude a hinding Political agreement at the outset, the Company thereafter to pursue commercial negotiations with the Sheikh, and the Political agreement to he drought in at an appropriate point at those negotiations, if necessary with the hacking of the political authorities. He thinks that if we were to adopt the course suggested hy the Company we might very well either frighten the Sheikh into abandoning negotiations, at any rate temporarily, or drive him into the arms of the Standard Oil. In either event the A.P.O.C. would he able to suggest that the j onus of the breakaownirested with us. In his opinion once the commercial negotiations have proceeded a reasonable distance with the Sheikh and the Sheikh is in sight of a substantial sum of money, serious difficulty will not arise over the Political Agreement 2 /7 I ( 7 L - 2 - £. 1 have mentioned Colonel Fowle’s views informally to hr.

I write with further reference to lour letter of 18th July z 'i- - about Qatar Oil( that we understand from Fowle that he has now discussed with you in detail the question of procedure, and that in the light of his views you are now prepared to adopt the same proceduref'as in the case of Koweit, viz. to enter into a political agreement with H.M.G. on the same general lines as in Koweitj and thereafter to proceed Sheikh. The political agreement would in due course be disclosed to the Sheikh^ * of the commercial negotiations. We feel strongly ourselves that this is the right course to adopt, and we are outstanding points in the political agreement might take place once we have the views of the Admiralty about refining.

Agnew's proposed draft for the ’ Refining* clause in the ^tar Government Agreement enclosed with Mr. Hearn* s letter of 11th July differs a good deal from the suggestion made by Mm. Agnew at the meeting on 21st March (please see the record of trie meeting at flag , A* ). 2. I submit a draft d.o. letter to the Admiralty ashing for their views on the alternative drafts lor the ’Refining’ clause put forward by tne Company, together with a draft interim reply to Mr. Hearnf ctlcrMPte if n . 3 . The subject of Mr. Hearn's’ letter oi 18th July will no doubt have to be discussed with the other departments and with Colonel Fowle. There is a great deal to be said for clearing the •'political' points with tne aheihh in advance of any commercial negotiations and so avoiding the difficulties with which we have been faced in Koweit; but the tactics to be adopted with the Sheikh in this event would need careful consideration. There/11^ 2 There might he advantage in letting him have in the near future a clear statement of the ,,, politica^ , points on which we should require him to meet us as a condition of our approval to the grant of a concession to any company, whatever its composition or nationality (those points will incidentally in the case of Qatar include an understanding regarding jurisdiction and prohahly also an understanding regarding the making of air regulations hy the Sheikh, in addition to trie points covered hy the Koweit Political Agreement), and letting him think them over during the currency of the extended option. 4. Action on these lines might further impress on the Sheikh that H.M.G. mean business in regard to the concession and that they intend that if he grants one it shall he on terms which they approve. There is on the other hand the risk that hy confronting the sheikh with a number of demands, some of which at any rate are likely to he very unpalatable to him, we may (a) lead him to say that he will give an oil concession to no one; (h) encourage him to call our Dluff aria, commit himself to the Standard on quite different terms in the hope that we shall not he prepared or able to press our points against American interests.Ws could view (s.) witjii eQuaniniit/y so long as “tne .Sheikh’s refusal was of universal application, (h) might he rather more awkward. But in the case of Qatar, before we took action on the lines referred to above we should have to reach a clear understanding here with the Poreign Office and the other departments that we intended to maintain our desiderata against any applicant for a concession, whatever its nationality, and that even in the event of the Sheikh acuing as in (b) we should refuse to recognise any concession so given or to accept any concessionnaire for Qatar which did not comply with our requirements.

Dear Mr. Walton, QATAR Further to my letter of the 11th July, Mr. Mylles has now succeeded in ob taining an extension of our agreement with the Shaikh over a period of eight months from 6 th August. This, of course, greatly relieves the tension. Having regard to our experience in Kuwait, we feel that it would be very desir able for all political” matters to be settled between the Government*s political representatives and the Shaikh before our negotiator appears on the scene. If you concur in this view, we can, no doubt, arrive at a mutually satisfactory t ime table for the future. As I remarked in my previous letter, I suggest it would be desirable to nave another meeting at the India Office in order to settle all outstanding points. They are not considerable.

Mr. Hearn rang up on the 15th July to say that Mr, Mylles had secured the consent of the sheikh of Qatar to an extension of the present option for a further period of 8 months at a rent of Rs,2,500 per month. The A»P#0.G. regarded this as very satisfactory. They had, however, no information as to whether the Sheikh had given any indication in the course of the discussions of his attituae on the question of a concession, hut they woula let us have a copy of Mr* Myites’ report when received. 2. Mr. Hearn went on to say that the Company would prohahly ask for a meeting with us in the near future to discuss future procedure. For various reasons it would he some time before they could resume active negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar for. the grant of a concession. They propose, however, to suggest to H.JVHG, that the political points involved in the grant of any concession should in the near future be cleared out of the way by discussion between the political authorities in the Persian Gulf ana the Sheikh. Once these had been disposed of it t woula be possible for the Company to take up negotiations on the basis of the commercial issues only. J.G, LAITHWAITE.

However, at a discussion I recent ly had with him, in which he learnt that the Kuwait Political Agreement would not be published to the world, or referred to in the Commercial Agreement, he agreed that, subject to the same procedure being followed in the case of Qatar, he would no longer object to accepting the precise Yarding of the Kuwait Clause 10. Alternatively, and arising out of the views he expressed at the meeting at the India Office, he has prepared a new draft clause which he wou equally willing t.o accept. 12JUL 1934Continuation: Date 1 1.7 *1934, | 'b'f- Page 2• I enclose herewith a copy of the alternative drafts.

Mr. Agnew explained that even two constituent groups of the I.P.C. were not allowed to negotiate for a concession within the Red Line without the approval of the I.P.C. Board which, in this case, the A.P.O.C. had already obtained, the question having been discussed informally with the I.P.C. at group meetings.

The A.P.O.C. had oeen afraid that if none of the other constituents of the I.a.C. agreed to come in they might be left witn a concession on their hands which, under the terms of the Oil Agreement, they would be unable to work themselves without the participation of some other constituent group. ire Royal Dutch Shell had accordingly agreed to participate with the A.P.O.C. in working any concession that might be obtained and the French group had said that anything which proved acceptable to the A.P.O.C. and the Royal Dutch Shell would be acceptable to them. Sgr. Agnef thought, thereiore, that the formation of a Shell A.P.O.C. G r01 - l P ■lonld be tactically undesirable at this stage since it would appear to the other constituents of the I.P.C. as a sort of all- British front. In view of this explanation the meeting agreed that in spite of the rather informal nature of the present , . ata r\ P c. it S t V| P T p 0 . it would arrangements between the 1 .r . .. - • be preferable on the whole that the Agreements should be made in the name of the A.P.O.C. only. lhe rlRsirability/—: m —mi ’j;T»3r ri .gr^ Oo 3. desirability of informing the Sheikh that the A.P.O.C. were acting on behalf of the I*P,C. was also discussed. It was agreed that the Sheikh could have no formal ground of complaint in this respect in view of Art .12 of the Commercial Agreement and Sir Louis Kershaw suggested that the position might suitably be explained to him informally by Col. Fowls at a later stage. It was not anticipated that there would be any difficulty with the Sheikh on this point. The meeting then turned to consider the terms of the draft Government Agreement. Article 1 was acceptable to the Companies. Nationality of subsidiary Companies . Article 2. Mr. Agnew saw great difficulty in the provision that subsidiary Companies should be registered in Great Britain since this would involve a liability for U.K. taxation# Under the constitution of the I.P.C. its subsidiaries might be of any nationality. He did not think that the French and American groups would mind subsidiary Companies being registered in Great Britain except for the fact that this would involve them in double taxation to which they very naturally objected. The Shell and the A.P.O.C. cared nothing themselves for this point since they were in any case liable to U*K.taxation. Sir Louis Kershaw suggested that this tax liability might be an additional reason for the foreign elements in the I.P.C. not wanting to participate in the concession, but Mr. Agnew said that the jealousies within the Board ox the I.P.C. were such that there was no prospect of the two British gr oup s/4. groups being allowed to take up any concession without the others participating. They might complain vigorously about its terms but they would come in nevertheless. Mr. St an ling and Mr. Seal suggested that this might be a reason for insisting on U.K. registration in spite of the taxation difficulties and Mr. Rendel explained that since any conditions imposed in the Government Agreement must be of universal application, H.M.G. could not make them easier for the A.P.O.C. - I.P.C. than for example a purely American Company. Mr. Hearn and Mr. Agnew said that if H.M.G. made things difficult for foreigners in British territory, British Oil Companies would be faced with retaliation in foreign territory and referred to their present negotiations with the Syrian Government, but Mr. Rendel pointed out that there was no analogy between the mandated territory of Syria and the independent Sheikhdom of Qatar which was not British territory and where there were special dixficulties in regard to protection of xorsigners• It was finally agreed, however, that in view of the taxation dixiicult^, the registration of subsidiary Companies in the United Kingdom might be dispensed with but thau any subsidiary should be registered in the British fmpire and that its chairman should at all times be a British subject. Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the draft Agreement were acceptable to the Oil Companies. Kr. ilalton explained with reference to Article 4 that it was possible thu,t H.M.G. night decide to designate the Political Agent, Bahrein as Political Agent also in Qatar and Article 4 as drafted would cover this though in so far as the P.A. might/13^ 5. might not be resident in Qatar the obligation to conduct local relations through the Political Representative of E.M.G. would in practice have to be interpreted rather more loosely. Mr. Agnew and Mr. Hearn took note of this and saw no objection. It was agreed that words to the following effect should be added to the third paragraph of Article 6 of the Qatar Commercial Agreement:- H and in times of national emergency the Sheikh shall have full use free of charge of the Company^ wireless and telegraph installations and railvmys for governmental purposes,' and that a new Article 7 identical with Article 7 of the Howeit Government Agreement should be incorporated l in the 'Qatar Government Agreement. Articles 7 and 8 were acceptable to the Companies. Refining . Article 9 . Mr. Agnew said that in view of the international character of the I.P.C. the Government Agreement would soon become known all over the world and if any refining clause were included in it ioreigners would impose a corresponding clause on British Oil Companies in foreign countries. It was true that a clause such as that in the Kcreeit Agreement would not involwe the Company in any definite obligation vio-a-vio H.M.G., but South American Republics would usea similar clause as a means for getting at the Company’s bank balance. Oil Companies always preferred, if possible, to refine at the point of production so that a refining clause on the lines of the Koweit Agreement could not really give any tangible advantage to the Government, but it would mean a great deal6 . to the Company and might have diastrous resalts on British interests elsewhere. He thought that H.M.G’s real safeguard lay in the existence of the British groups in the I.P.C. Sir Louis Kershaw enquired whether the same difficulties were not to he feaxed from the clause in the Howeit Agreement, hut Mr . Hearn hoped that since only two Companies were interested in this the clause would not become widely known. Mr. Starling said that H.M.G. were at present negotiating with various foreign countries and trying to get them to agree that they should impose no conditions on British Oil Companies which were not imposed on other Oil Companies. Having in mind these negotiations he felt inclined to agree generally with what Mr.Agnew had said. Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty were somewhat perturbed at the very small number of refineries in British territory in view of the difficulties which might arise in time of war in obtaining oil for the Hsvy from neutral countries. The Admiralty particularly desired that there should be more refineries in British territory in Asia. He said that it was a well established British policy to ensure if possible that oil should, oe refined in British territory and he suggested, and Mr. Starlijig agreed that this policy was well known abroad. Sir Louis Kershaw also doubted whether the omission of a refining clause from the present agreement would really make it much easier for British Companies vis-a-vis, for example, South American Republics who might produce earlier documents which contained conditions regarding refining. There was, for example, the/f 35' Q. v;ould be forthcoming. H W 8 .G agreed that the propo by the Admiralty and by the Companies and that the Companies should prepare a draft of a letter such as had been mentioned. Mr* Agnew said that in the event of this proposal being accepted by both parties he would put it informally to the American and French representatives of the I.P.C* in London without however prejudicing in his conversation with them the terms of the Government Agreement. added that neither could I.P.C. to this prop o sal aL &amp; I ® ( 9 KJPY SENT BY AIR MAIfc * f . yl /i ^ ^ Jt^Kote of a meeting held at the India Offiq^/ on hist March with representatives of the Royalrcv -/ V, Dutch Shell and Anglo-Persian Oil Companies to discuss the Qatar Oil Concession, present:- Sir Louis Kershaw (in the chair), Mr, G.

It was agreed that a clause should he inserted in Art. 14 of the Commercial Agreement on the lines of Art. 11 A(c) of the Koweit Agreement providing for termination of the concession by the Sheikh if the Company should be in default under tne Arbitration provisions of Art.16. Relations between A.P.O.C., Royal Pu t on Snell arid Iraq Petroleum Company . Mr,Rendel put forward a suggestion which had been previously made by him on behalf of the Foreign Office, namely that if the formal Agreements with the Sheikh and with H.M.G. were made in the name of the A.P.O.C. only and if, when these were put before the Board of the X.P.C., the I.P.C., objected to their terms, they might olaim that the A.B.O.C. had exceeded its powers and that the/the Agreements vaere ultra vires under the I.P.C.Oil Agreement; on the other hand if the Royal hutch Shell were brought in now as a party to the Agreements, the I.P.C. could not legitimately object to Agreements made by two of its constituents or to the concession being worked by the A.P.O.G. and the Royal Dutch Shell. Mr.Agnew explained that even two, constituent groups of the I.P.C. were not allowed to negotiate for a concession within the Red Line without the approval of the I.P.C. Board which, in this case, the A.P.O.C. had already obtained, the question having been discussed informally with the I.P.C. V at group meetings. It had been left to the A.P.O.C. to get a concession in this area and the A.P.O.C.exploration licence in Qatar was held on behalf of the I.P.C.

The Royal Dutch Shell had accordingly agreed to participate with the A.P.O.C. in working any concession that might be obtained and the French group had said that anything which proved acceptable to the A.P.O.G. and the Royal Dutch Shell would be acceptable to them.

There was, for example, the/the standing example of Trinidad where not less than 50^ of the oil had to he refined locally. Mr.Agnew , however, thought that a modern Agreement made in London might have great weight, and he mentioned that British Companies were coming up against this difficulty more and more in their relations with foreign countries* They would rather give H.M.G* their safeguard in some other way than in a formal public document. Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty felt that in Qatar they might go rather further in insisting on their refining desiderata than in Eoweit though, if course, they would not press the Company beyond reason . Mr. Agnew suggested as a possible solution that the I.P.C* might be asked to give H*M.G* a letter saying that the Company would be prepared at all times to discuss with H.M.G* the question of refining and that H.M.G. would have the right as soon as production in Qatar amounted to a modern refining unit to ask the Company to erect a refinery. He explained that this would mean the erection of a refinery when production reached say 2,000 tons a day or 700,000 tons a year. They would expect H.M.G* to treat them reasonably in regard to this obligation if it proved impossible to find a market for the oil. At all costs he wished to avoid the appearance of a refining clause ii/a formal Agreement. Sir Louis Kershaw asked whether this letter would be obtained before the Government Agreement was signed. Mr, Agnew said he thought it would be best that the letter should be sent say a month after the signature of the Government Agreement but that a guarantee might be obtained before signature oi the Agreement that such a letter would oe fortncoming*•^TT—- j* 8 .

The Admiralty have Ween considering the best means of utilising the proposal to give the Anglo- Persian Oil Company what practically amounts to a monopoly (and security) in Qatar as a bargaining factor in order to secure the best possible safeguards for the Government Agreement. At first sight, it might seem attractive to make aH arrangements with the Sheikh first, and to wait until the Company are up against the Standard Oil Company after August next (when the Anglo-Persian option expires) before attempting to negotiate. There are, however, two fatal defects to such a course of action. The first is that the Political Resident’s activities in Qatar are bound to leak out, sufficiently at any rate to give the Company an inkling as to what is happening. The second is that tne Company is pressing /forward .C. Walton, Esq.., C.B., M.C.forward with the negotiation of the Government Agreement and it will be difficult to revise anything which is accepted now as satisfactorily meeting the Government requirements. In view of these considerations, we are strongly of opinion that the Government proposals should be made known to the Company at the earliest possible moment, having regard to the pfogress Fowle makes during his present visit to ^atar. vVe should much prefer that our desire for a better refinery clause (together with your desiderata about British character) were made known to the Company at the same time, and negotiated with them as a definite quid pro quo* We are, if necessary, quite prepared to meet the Company here at the Admiralty to discuss the refinery clause with a view to preparing the ground and to educate Agnew, hut we cannot expect to reach a satisfactory settlement if we are unable /toto use the proposal to give the company a virtual monopoly as a bargaining counter. Inevitably, therefore, such a discussion would have to end in disagreement, to be subsequently reconciled when you are in a position to show your hand. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office and Starling at the Petroleum Department. Yours sincerely.The Company undertake to erect a refinery capable of dealing with a substantial portion of the oil exported, so soon as an output of 200,000 tons per annum of crude oil shall have been assured.

We have the following alterations to suggest in &lt; c the draft of 2nd Jany., 1934, enclosed with Mr. Fraser’s letter of 10th Jany., 1934: Art. 2 .~ After 'State of Qatr' in second line insert 'as defined below', and for last sentence of this para, read: 'For the purposes of this agreement the State of Qatr means all territory ruled by the Sheikh lying to the north of the line shown on the map annexed hexebo.' 2621 6000 3/34 c note ; We propose to prescribe a southern boundary of Qatr as the limit of the ' guarantee of orotection proposed to be given to the Sheikhf (but not necessarily as the limit of his jurisdiction for all purposes, as this would leave a vacuum which might be absorbed by Ibn Saud). The concession boundary would be either identical with this guarantee boundary, or some boundary to the north of it. Art. 4 .- ho alteration to be suggested, but it should be stipulated that the Joy. 's negotiators will keep in close touch with the Political Resident during the negotiations, and give him prompt information of all developments; this would include information of the financial terms offered during the process of bargaining; these terms should be such as to give full weight to the fact that the Coy. would obtain an exclusive concession over the whole of an area of apparently over 3,000 square miles. Moreover, the Sheikh should clearly understand that the effect of his acceptance/acceptance of the royalty formula proposed would be that royalty would be paid only on oil actually exported from or sold for consumption in Qatr, and not on the oil produced, and that royalty does not commence till after the commencement of exports from Qatr (there being no provision, as in the Koweit case, for a declaration that petroleum has been found in commercial quantities and quality).

Art. 12 .- The word 'British' which we had proposed before the words 'commercial coy.' in the second line need not be inserted if the relevant clause in the Govt, agreement is agreed to.

Iirnsdiate a India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 1st February,1934. My dear McClaughry, Many thanks for your letter of the 29th January, Fo. S.32797, on the subject of air facilities in Qatar. 2. Walton will write separately to you about the point raised in the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 3. He asks me to say that he has noted the verbal alteration suggested in your paragraph 6 . 3. As I have explained to you informally, we are taxing up in the light of the telegrams of which you nave had copies the question of giving the Sheikh oi Aaoar a guarantee of protection against landward aggression in return for tne grant by him of an oil concession to the Anglo-fersian Oil Company, and an official letter consulting you with particular reference to the question of protection and the coirirui aments v/hicu would involve will I hope reach you tomorrow. 4 . We are particularly anxious, subject, ofcourse, to the concurrence of the interested departments, to put the Resident in a position to say sometning definite to the Sheikh about the grant of protection, should oircumstcn. 6 es in nis opinion make this desirable, and while we entirely agre^. Miat the two points dealt with in paragraph 4 of your letter under reply will have to be considered bei ore any final co^orriitnont is entered into, we trust that the Air Ministry in tueir replv to our official letter will be prepared to agree that consideration of them need not delay progress with regard uo general policy and/ € C ommand e r W. A * Me C lau ghr y,DSG. , MC., DF C. , lir Ministry, Adastral House, Hingsway, W.C.2.1^4- ana that the Resident should he given discretion, if he thinks fit, to give a general undertaking (subject to consideration of at any rate the point raised in the first sub-paragraph of p a r a gr ap h 4} i inme d i a t e 1 y. 5. Our general view would he that the question of any reconnaissance over Qatar should he left until the question of protection has been broached. . Particularly if it is broached by the Sheikh, the Resident will he in a position to take the line that, while the matter must he referred to His Majesty's Government, they will obviously he anxious in the first place to ascertain what difficulties are involved in the grant of protection, and for this purpose it would he possible for him to obtain the consent of the Sheikh to reconnaissance flights of the nature which you suggest. As the result of. these reconnaissance flights, which need not, I imagine, take very long, it would presumably he possible for the Air Ministry to reach final conclusions without delay as to the landing grounds which they would require in the event of a guarantee of protection being given. The connected question of intelligence is one for settlement between the departments concerned in consultation with the Political Resident, and is not of immediate urgency. 6 . On Hie points to which you refer in paragraph 5 of your letter, I may say that in the event of our entering into closer relations with the Sheikh of //Qatar consequent on the grant of an oil concession by him, we should, as at present advised, proposed to aim at securing that the air procedure which hasbeen agreed with the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office in the case of Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat should equally apply to Qatar - in other words, that there should be a formal agreement with the Sheikh covering civil aviation (and providing for the payment to him of a certain rent in respect of such civil aviation facilities as might be provided), accompanied by a binding exchangeoi letters in regard uo the activities of military aircraft. This would cover point (a) in paragraph 5 of your letter so ±ar as aerodromes were concerned, and the conditions under which military aircraft coula fly over the principality as a whole could De worked quo oetween us and the Resident with a view to proposals uo uhe bneiidi on this subject also being considered. 7. Point (b) in the same paragraph is closely connected v/itn the question oi protection. If the Sheikh is offered and accepts our protection we assume that no difficulty would arise about the provision of refuelling facilities. Detailed arrangements in regard to the provision of labour for the making or improveiiitnu oi landing grounds could be a matter for local agreement. A guarantee for their safety would be covered by the agreement referred to in the preceding paragraph. The question of wliat, ii any, payment would be necessary, is one on which we should .in due course like the Resident’s advice. He would no doubt consult Air Officer Commanding Iraq in connection with it. 3. Ihe question raised in paragraph 5 (c) can be considered in due course. It is not a matter of immediate importance. 9. as regards paragraph 5 (d) of your letter, the draft Concession contains no provision for the use of independent air iacilitias by the oil concessionnaire. If we can secure an agreement with the Sheikh on the same lines as we propose in ‘-Rirem, XCoweit and Muscat, it will secure in practice complete control to His Majesty’s Government of any air facilities, and if the Company should ever wish to establish a landing ground of dneir own, a condition such as you suggest could be considered as a term of approval to it. We' think it unnecessary to take up the point now. 10.

My dear Walton, With reference to your letter of 12th January, No. P#Z # 248/34, the following are the only outstanding points I have to make in regard to the draft Qatar “Commercial Agreement 11 : Articles 5 and 13. If the Company prove very difficult over the amendment we have suggested to Article 13, we might propose as an alternative, that there should he added to Article 3 words to the effect that “the Company shall maintain in good working order all wells drilled so long as they are economically productive* 1 . This would correspond with the provisions of the I.P.C. Agreement in Iraq and would give us really what we want to secure. I should not think they would object to this hut I agree with you that in the last resort we shall have to let this point go. We ought not to overlook that we have made a reservation on this Article which will enable us to look at the financial terms when the last stage of bargaining is reached. See note on this Article in the Memorandum which accompanied Laithwaite’s letter to Hearn of 29th December last (P.Z. 8329/33). r * C. faltoh, Esq., C.B. , M.C. , india Office, Tng Charles Street, 5.W.I. Article 4.- 2 - Article 6 . I agree with you that the word 'as' should he inserted after 'works” in line 5. (See paragraph 6 of your letter.) Article 12. The question of maintaining the British character of the Company and of any transferee Company is being covered in the 'Government Agreement' which is now under consideration. We have not yet discussed the relevant Clauses with the Company, but you will remember that at our inter departmental discussion on these Clauses I suggested we could press our desiderata both in respect of the transferee Company and any subsidiary. I cannot be sure that we shall succeed finally, but we should, I think, do our best and not give w r ay at this stage. I agree with paragraph 4 of your letter as to the wording of the second paragraph of Article 12. As you point out, a clause will have to be added that the agreement does not come into operation until H.M. Government has given its written consent. But I gathered in a recent conversation with you that you have rather changed your view about having it put in straightaway. I am sending copies of this letter to Warner and Seal. Yours sincerely.Suggested, points to be included in agreement bet^ieen His Majesty’s Government and the Koweit Oil ** . Company Ltd,, 1 .

C&amp;py to: Sir, Further to previous correspondence regarding our negotiations with E.3. the Shaikh of Qatar we now have the honour to report the latest stage in these negotia tions, which is as follows. Mr.Chisholm arrived in Dohah on 15th December, and discussions took place with the Shaikh on 16th, 17th ana 18th December. It was explained that as the result of our previous discussions we had redrafted the general terms of our proposals so as to cover various points which the Shaikh wished to have included in them, and we had also decided to offer him cash terms considerably in excess of those previously offered. At the Shaikh’s request Mr.Chisholm gave him an Arabic translation of our proDOsed new general terms (as forwarded to you under cover of our letter GM/1327 of 15th December) omitting Article 4 which concerned only the cash terms; as regards the cash terms Mr.Chisholm also communicated to the Shaikh the figures which we were now prepared to offer. The attitude adopted by the Shaikh however was, while admitting the length to which we had gone to meet him as regards both general and cash terms, to refuse any offer which did not embody to the full the very large demands made by him at our October discussions. He made quite plain his opinion that, if we would not accept his terms, there were other parties who would be ready to do so on the expiry on 25th August 1934 of our current agreement with him. As the Shaikh could not be persuaded to abandon this attitude, Mr.Chisholm suspended negotiations and returned to Abadan on 21st December. The Shaikh, while expressing regret that agreement could not yet be reach ed, and stating that unless his demands could be accepted in full it was unnecessary for our representative to re-visit Qatar, said that he would be glad to receive and consider any communications received from us. We have reported on this situation to our London Principals and will inform you in due course of any further developments.

His idea is that, whatever condition under this head we propose to the Anglo-Persian or the new Anglo-American Co. in Koweit, it would not he possible to propose a more stringent condition to a purely American company which might come into the field if the Anglo-Persian or the new Gulf Co. drop out of the running. I doubt whether we need at the present stage seek a decision of quite such general and universal application as suggested. There seems no great advantage in deciding definitely in advance that we will he content, vis-a-vis a purely American company, with the exact amount of safeguard that may satisfy us in dealing with the Anglo-Persian (whose subsidiary in Qatr would at any rate he partly British), or with the new company in Koweit, which will he 50% British. If we make certain proposals to British, or partly British, applicants, and they accept them and obtain the concessions then the question of American competition does not arise; if, on the other hand, the present applicants fail to get the concessions and American competitors come into the field, it does not seem/seem that the latter would have much -cause to complain of discrimination if we propose to them a safeguard more stringent than that which had heen discussed or even agreed on in previous discussion^ with British applicants, since ex nypothesi the latter would have failed to obtain the concessions, so that the conditions of the safeguard would not have come into actual existence. Moreover, if a general decision on a controversial question is to he sought, considerable delay may occur before we are in a position to let th$ Anglo-Persian and the Koweit Oil Go. know the exact terms of our requirement in regard to local personnel this will hold up the conclusion of the contemplated agreements between H.M.G. and the Cos., and consequently delay the final conclusion of their agreements with the Sheikhs. On the other hand, in order to expedite the negotiations already started with the Anglo-Persian in regard to Qatr and the Anglo-American group in regard to Koweit, it is desirable as soon as possible to decide what are the minimum terms in regard to this safeguard with which we will be satisfied in the course of the negotiations with the companies. We should, I think, decide to aim at securing the most satisfactory terms that the companies can b e got to accept, and in neither case less than the minimum suggested in the attached draft letter. J.G. WALTON. 11.1.34.India Office, P.Z,286/34, Whitehall, S.W.l. 13th January,1934. Sir, Immediate. In connection with the Questions of granting an oil concession in Q,atr to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, acting on behalf of the I.P.C., and in Koweit to a company to be equally controlled by the A.P.O.C. and by the Gulf Company of the U.S.A., I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state that he has had under consideration one of the conditionsto be laid down as a political safeguard in the case of either concession, namely, that the local personnel operating the concession should be either exclusively, or so far as possible, British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh concerned. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare attaches the highest degree of importance to this condition for well known reasons, which need not be fully recapitulated. In view of the primitive conditions obtaining in the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf, the backward state of the administration, and the uncivilised character of the local and neighbouring populations, it is impossible to ignore the risk of unfortunate incidents or disturbances which might result from the introduction of any considerable number of American or other foreign personnel of the artisan type into Q,atr or iCoweit. The danger of incidents would be much greater in the case of foreign than in the case of British personnel, as the former would be less amenable to the advice and instructions of the local British authorities, and at the same/ Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office,same time any such incident in which a foreign national suffered might give rise to internetional complications, as the foreign Power concerned would naturally demand that His Majesty's Government should eithertake steps to enforce reparation, or permit it to intervene itself on behalf of its nationals. 3. The Secretary of State therefore considers that every endeavour should be made to secure the agreement of any company seeking an oil concession in any of the Arab sheikhdoms to a condition, providing the fullest possible safeguard that the circumstances of a particular case may permit, in regard to the nationality of its local personnel. He doednot suggest that it is necessary to impose a condition in id.entical terms in all cases, since circumstances may differ, and in some of the sheikhdoms the safeguard desired is of even more importance than in others. 4. It will be remembered that the American-controlled Bahrein Petroleum Company agreed to a condition that as many of its employees in Bahrein as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. This clause does not altogether exclude the employment of American personnel, and in effect it is largely left to the Company to decide whether the employment of individual Americans is necessary for r 'the efficient carrying on of the under taking 11 , since this is laregly a technical point on which it would be difficult to dispute the Company's opinion. 5. The Secretary of State agrees with the suggestion, which has been made in inter-departmental discussions, that the various political safeguards desired in connection with the grant of oil concessions by the Sheikhs of Q,atr and Koweit should/should be embodied in agreements to be concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the companies concerned. He also agrees that it is desirable not to insist on such conditions as the and the new Anglo-American Company&gt;in tatr and Aoweit respectively, would clearly be unable to accept. But the importance of the safeguard in regard to the nationality of local personnel is so great that he suggests, firstly, that we should aim at securing its embodiment in the &gt;&lt;iatr and Koweit agreements to the fullest extent that may be possible, and secondly, that our minimum requirement should be a clause following that agreed to by the Bahrein Petroleum Company slightly modified so as to provide that as many of the local employees of the Company as is consistent, in the Judgment of the Company, with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh. This, it is suggested, should be the absolute minimum but every effort would be made to induce the Companies to agree to the omission of the words !I in the Judgment of the Company ’ as otherwise it might not be possible to question in any way the action of the Company in regard to the number of its foreign employees. 6 . Sir Samuel Hoare would be grateful for a very early reply to this letter. As the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is aware, the matter is urgent, since agreements between the Companies and the Sheikhs concerned cannot be brought into force - and ought, perhaps, not to be finally concluded - pending the conclusion of parallel agreements between the Companies and His Majesty 1 s Government. 7. Copy of this letter is being sent to the Admiralty and the Petroleum Department. I am, etc. (Sd.) J.C.Walton.FILE COPY P .2.248/34, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 12th January 1934. Will you please refer to the papers sent to you on 12th January regarding the Qatar oil concession, viz . Mr. Fraser 1 s letter covering the A.P.O.C.'s revised draft of a commercial agreement and certain notes on the draft. You will see that the Company have accepted the majority of the amendments proposed in the note enclosed with Laithwaite's letter to Mr. Hearn of 29th December, but that there are certain outstanding points in regard to Articles 12 and 13, which they propose to discuss ah the same time as the Government agreement. 2 . I should be grateful for your views as to the amendments which we had suggested to Article 13. My own impression is that though we desire if possible to secure them we should not allow the negotiations to break down on the* point. We might however stick out for them at any rate for bargaining purposes, but possibly be prepared to withdraw them if necessary in the last resort in order to facilitate securing our desiderata in the Government agreement which may be a matter of some difficulty. 3. As regards Article 12, I presume that we shall make an effort to secure the inclusion in the Government agreement of our desiderata in regard to a certain measure of British control at headquarters, vis * - (a) that any r ir’ansferee company shall be registexed in Great Britain and have its principal place oj. business in/ ^•C.Starling, Esq., Petroleum Department, Mi ne s De par time nt, Dean Stanley Street, S ♦¥. 1.Ill ic b 2 . in Great aritain, and that the Chairman shall at all tiim he a British subject; and (b) a sinitial obligation (ii possible ) in regard to subsidiary c ompanie s. I gather rrom the previous discussions that there is little chance 01 the Company agreeing to (b), but they might agree go (a) being included in the Government agreement. Is this also your reading of the situation ? In the Company are agreeable to the inclusion of (a) in the Government agreement, we might, I suppose, agree to their proposal to omit the word ,r British” before if dinaxy commeicial company” in the first paragraph of ai tide 12 On tne commercial agreement. In any case ihe even more important safeguard of local British personnel will of course be dealt with separately in the Government agreement. 4. I’here is a point which is probably only a matter of drafting in the second paragraph of Article 12. The Company 1 s redraft, as compared with ours, transfers the limiting words”so far as they are applicable to its operations” to the end of the paragraph where they might oe read as referring only to engagements and responsibilities instead of (as in our redraft) only to rights and privileges. We might agree to such redraft of this article as will make it clear that the limiting words refer to both rights and engagements; e.g. ”so far as such rights privileges engagements and responsibilities are applicable to its operations”. But in any case it should of course be understood that the limiting words will not in/3 in any way affect the engagements and responsibilities in respect of such political safeguards as the government agreement will make applicable to subsidiary companies. Might it therefore not be best to omit the limiting words \ as they do not seem to be doing any work? 5. On another quite small drafting point, the word ”as M should apparently be inserted in the fifth line of Article 6 of the Company’s revised draft before the words n it may re quire”. 6 . You will see that the Company have not yet inserted in the draft the clause to provide that the commercial agreement shall not come into force until His Majesty’s Government have given their written consent. I think that, if everyone, agrees this clause ought to be added before the draft is sent out to Mr. Chisholm and to the Political Resident. 7. As regards the procedure for getting the Government agreements (both in regard to Qatar and Koweit) into shape, I propose, as a first step, to have rough* drafts sketched out with the aid of our Legal Adviser and on the basis of informal discussions with the representatives of the Companies and then to communicate them to you, the Foreign Oxiice and the Admiralty 1 or consideration, aitei wniMi can negotiate them with the Companies. 8 .

We will then deal with all the points mentioned in that letter and suggest an early meeting, which we hope you will be able to arrange. I might say that we have found it possible to adopt a good many of the suggestions affecting the negotiating agreement and to pass them on to Elkington. We will deal, however, with all these points specifically when we write you offi cially. In the meantime we hear that the Political Resident is not likely to visit Qatar until after Ramazan, and I much hope that we shall find it possible between us to come to a full understanding here before negotiations are resumed there.

II. qatar Oil Concession. The meeting resumed consideration of the revised which had taken place with the representatives of the Company on 14th December, (P.Z. 8212/33)* The meeting took note of the position* oil concession communicated informally by the A.P.O.C. on 11th December 1933, in the light of the record of the, discussion Mr.Laithwaite said that the A.P.O.C. were pressing for the earliest that H.M.G. might desire, in t information before Christmas. That was impossible, but it information befox^e Christmas, seemed desirable to let them have a The meeting agreed* letter early next week. consider the general procedure t&lt; with the Company and the Sheikh; amendments, if any, to be sugges Articles of the revised draft coi thirdly, Article 12 and the conn control, exclusive British explo granted (though this point stric the maintenance of a British Chi Company in Qatar* The India It was ag agreed that it would be best first to l procedure to be adopted in negotiating ld the Sheikh; secondly, the supplementary to be suggested to the Company ih draft concession other than Article 12; and the connected questions of British British exploitation of any concession s point strictly arose on Article IT), and a British Chief Local Representative of the ; The India Office ^^^frluon/3 . consideration in this connection of certain special restrictions, arising out of political conditions in Qatar, which would apply to all Companies applying for concessions whatever their nationality. III. A. procedure.. On the question of procedure,, jir• Laithwa.1 te said that as the A.P.O.C. were apparently willing to cover certain points of special interest to H.ii.G, in an exchange of letters (which must of course be of a character binding on the Company and on any transferees or assignees), the simplest course, in the light of previous informal discussion with the Foreign Office, and subject to the views of the meeting, appeared to be that there should be: (a) an agreement between the Company ana the bheikh which should be purely commercial in character, possibly on the general lines of the revised draft concession which the i mi tted With such modification of Article Company had now submitted, +o in other articles as might h 12 and such minor amendments in otn thought necessary; p&gt;0&lt;c . and H-M.G- to (h) a subsidiary agreement between • + primarily to H.M.G. and the Company, cover matters of interest pixmaniy „ + h H G and the Sheihh, or to the Company and rather than to H.M.G. ana t „ .1 essentially with political points. This Sheikh, and xo deal essential roml3an y, &gt;, bindiny not only on the Company, agreement, which should be bmdi fe either an + ‘Atiaferee company, could hut on any assignee or i preferably formal agreement, perhaps P exchange of letters or - 14 th December Q+ thfi discussion on 14th neceu the latter. The Company joints of m deal with certain pomie had indicated their readiness • on exchange of letters. Such an this character m an exchang n cover e.g&gt; safeguards for aerodromes agreement could cover, g , e safeguards for wireless and other seaplane bases, saiegua ^ they wou; ld communications, undertakings by the P pay/4 * pay due deference to the advice of our political representatives and the views of the Sheikh, possibly (a point to be discussed later in connection with Article 12 of the revised draft Concession), exclusive British exploitation of any concession, the appointment of a British Chief Local Representative, etc. Apart from the points covered by (a) and (b), closer examination of the problem had shown that the grant of any oil concession by the Sheikh, whether to the A.P.O.C., the or an American Company, would give rise to ditlicult political problems in connection with jurisdiction over the concessionnaire*s employees, the grant of protection by H.M.G. in cas»s in which local conditions made this necessary and the Sheikh for any reason failed to afford it, and, probably, the appointment of a Political Agent to represent H.M.G. and would make it necessary to consider bringing into force certain articles of the Sheikh’s Treaty of 1916 which were at present dormant. Such questions could best be dealt with in a third agreement or exchange of letters between the oheikh and H Considerable difficulty might be anticipated m disposing ox them: and if we were to take them up with the Sheikh and try to r«ach a general understanding with him on political points, it might be thought desirable to take the opportunity also to secure the air facilities in Qatar which the Sheikh ha hitherto refused to give save in return for guarantees protection which H.M.G. were not prepared to undertake. Mr.Rendel said that, speaking personally, he was^ entirely in favour of a procedure such as had been m Higher authority at the Foreign Office had not ot course consulted. But action on these lines would, he was confident, be consistent with their general xri5. view as at present advised: which was that, so long as the interests of H.M.G. and of the Sheikh were adequately safeguarded nothing should 'be done which would tend to hamper the conclusion ^ of an agreement between the Sheikh and the A*EhO.C. in the immediate future* Delay would inevitably increase the risk that the Standard Oil Company of California might actively interest themselves in obtaining the concession. Were they once to enter the field, they could rely on the active support of the U.S. Government, and however strong the case on meiits for any special conditions which might be anxious to secure in respect of British control, British exploitation, British local representation &amp;c., we should almost certainly find it much more difficult to have our way on such points when dealing with a wholly foreign company backed by the U.S* Government than when dealing with a company such as the Iraq Petroleum Company in which there was a substantial British element* The procedure proposed, with an important proviso which the foreign Office had already recommended to the India Office, would make it possible for the A.P.O.C. to pursue negotiations immediately with the Sheikh with a view to reacning agreement on commercial points, - such an agreement uo contain no clau apolitical character such as provision for jurisdiction &amp;c. While those negotiations were in progress, we could separately discuss with the company the points to be covered in the proposed Agreement between the Company and H.M.G. : while the local political authorities, after consultation with H.m.O. and Government of India, could press on with a settlement of the points in issue between H.M.G, and the Sheikh. The proviso to which he had referred,, and which if accepted should fully safeguard the special interests of H.M.G., was that a clause should be inserted in any commercial agreement A.P.O.C. and the Sheikh to the effect that the Agreement could not/6. not come into force until the consent of ELM.G. had been obtained to its provisions.. Such a clause merely reaffirm'd the Sheikh’s existing treaty obligations and ought not therefore to cause difficulty with him. Vis-a-vis the Company it would emphasize the special position of H.lvl.G. in the matter. Mr. Re ridel added that in his view it would be desirable that the conditions to be laid down in respect of British control and exploitation of any concession, in whatever form they might emerge as a result of discussion by higher authority, and if necessary of refei’ence to the Cabinet, should be conditions which would apply not merely to a British concessionaire but to any other Company, of whatever nationality, which might enaeavour to secure a concession in Qatar. We had not yet thought out in detail at what conditions it would be desirable to aim, the questions involved were difficult and would need careful consideration, and it might therefore be impossible at once to inform the A.P.O.C. what precisely the conditions would ue. nut so long as their general outline could be communicated to the Company without delay, and the Company given to understand that whatever detailed conditions were finally laid uo.m would be of universal application, it ought considerably to reduce their difficulties in negotiating either with the Sheikh ox with tue I.P.C. Mr. Seal said that, so far as he could judge, the Admiralty on the understandings stated by Mr. Rendel, were unlikely to object to the procedure suggested. He thought that it was essential that the main lines of the agreement With H.M.n. should be oanmunicated to the Company in the. Ve - L './ near in order to avoid any suggestion that the Company. had been allowed to proceed with the commercial agreement with the Sheikh on false pretences: also that if any difficulty were 10 be experienced,/experienced, in getting ttie Sheikh to agree to oar terms it would be important to devise some means of avoiding the imuression that pressure was being brought to bear upon him in m the interests of the Mr» haithwaite said that the India Office fully agree! with the proviso to which Mr. Handel had referred, to which they attached great importance. As regards the conditions to be laid down, he thought that it would be well to give the Company a fairly clear idea of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which His Majesty 1 s Government would 'be likely to require vnien we informed them next week of our comments on the revised draft agreement generally. It was obviously essential that they should have this information before they concluded any agreement with the Sheikh, even if such an agreement covered commercial points only and contained the proviso which had been discussed. It would not be overlooked that the A.P.G.C. could no* conclude agreement with the Sheikh without the approval of the I.P.C. and that it might well be that safeguards such as we had in view might be of great importance from the I.P.C. standpoint. Mr. Starling said that we must take care that the minimum safeguards etc. which we might presence, should not such as to be impossible for the A.P.O.C. acting as they would „ „ t b o -o accent. We must not overlook that, be on behalf of the I.P.C. acccpo. . . them if the conditions laid down whatever the justification tor hiap, +• h a T P G mi girt be ujuvuilli^S ^ ^ t&amp;hs by H.M.G. YJere too stifi, trie I.i.b. . o up, or to proceed with negotiations for, a concession, and if they were themselves unwilling to take it up a position might ^ ■ 0 n p could not take it up independently. I-*- arise vuiere the iuP*O.C. coui • • v+ ourselves confronted immediately that happened we might imd oi -r p'ft drew attention to the with the Standard Oil of California* „ rinvjn b ir the Cabinet to general principles which had oee govern/ i ! ! I8* govern the grant of oil concessions in British territory * and the conditions to be satisfied in the case of such concessions, The most important of these Viere: {1} Registration in British territory; (2) Majority of Employees and if possible Managing Director to be British subjects; (3) 50^ of produce to be refined on British territory, and the oil to be suitable fox Admiralty use; (4) pre-emption in time of viar* Mr. Laithvsaite pointed out that the decision in qaastion Had bad in view British territory only. Qatar was not British territory, nor a British Broteotorate. It was an independent irah State in special treaty relations with H.lvI.G. The view that the Cabinet decision referred to did not cover the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, had consistently been held by the India Office in the inter departmental discussions which had taken place in connection Yilth the Kovieit oil concession. Mr. Rendel agreed and suggested that it had been accepted at the time of the assignment to American interests of the Bahrein oil concession that oil concessions to be granted in the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf must he dealt with separately and on their merits. It wo necessary to consider in the case of Qatar whether the conditions laid down by the Cabinet to apply in the case of concessions in British territory oi more strit g conditions, and if so whof, should apply. Mr. Starling/9. # Mr. Starling t reverting to his previous remarks, enquired whether, if we so stiffened up our conditions that the I.P.C. dropped out, we should feel quite sure that we could impose the same conditions on an American Company, e.g* the Standard Oil Company of California* Mr .Laithwaite said that he thought our general view was that such conditions as may he laid down should apply to any Company, whether British or foreign. The two important points were control and exploitation; and it would have to he decided what our minimum requirements in respect of them were to he, If K.M.G, decided to lay down the principle that both control and exploitation must he British, whatever might he the nationality of the Company ultimately controlling the oonoeesion, and we could secure acceptance of these terms from any concessionaire, so much the tetter. If it proved impossible in practice to go so far, and to secure effective British control^, then xve ought as a minimum to require that local representation and exploitation should be in British hands. We could make a good case fer this on the ground of the special local political difficulties of Q.atar, where we should be dealing with a State with ill-defined boundaries, a backward and scattered population, hitherto little in touch with the outside world, and not easily susceptible to pressure by H.M.G. The Sheikh was precluded by his treaty engagements from dealings with foreign powers - engagements to which it was regarded as desirable to hold him. If foreign subjects were massacred in Qatar by a tribal uprising or the like, responsibility for securing effective punishment would thus fall on K.M.G. , and here as in dealing with air procedure we might reasonably take the line that while we were prepared to face certain nnlitical/10. \ 1 political difficulties where our own nationals were concerned, we were not prepared to in the case of foreigners* On the face of it, too, we had a ^ood answer to any American complaint that such conditions represented a refusal to maintain an open door policy in oil matters in the Gulf. The Trucial Coast \vas closed to all concession hunters, whether British or foreign. The Bahrein oil concession had already been reassigned, with our approval, to American interests; and the latest information was that in Koweit , in which .American interests had been allowed full liberty to compete, we should in future be dealing with an Anglo-American combine. Our excuse for restricting exploitation in Qatar to British personnel would be the special political difficulties presented by that area. Mr.Starling said that it was relevant, so f&amp;r as the nationality of exploiting personnel was concerned, that Ibn Saud had agreed that the concession granted m jiasa to the Standard Oil of California should he operated by American personnel. Mr■ Rendel said that the question of nationality of the exploiting personnel and of the safeguards would clearly have to he considered separately, hut from the Foreign Office standpoint it would he easier to impose terns in respect of these on the I.P.C. than on a purely American Company, such as the Standard Oil Company. Mr-Seal said that the question of safeguards for pre-emption would probably he regarded as more important from the Admiralty standpoint if the Qatar concession tt ci p^mna-nv than if if went to the I.P.C. were to go to a U.S. Company tnan The fact to he faced was that the Admiralty must have the oil in War, and if the Company were American certa diplomatic difficulties might arise which would he very25&gt; *w- 11 . much more easily handled if the agreement provided for preemption. Mr.Lait hwaite said that the A.P.O.C. had been warned in the meeting on 14th December that in the event of their failing to secure the concessioner of competing interests entering the field, H.F.G. must not be regarded as permanently committed to approval of whatever terms they might in present conditions think suitable in the case of the A.P.O.C. We could if necessary endeavour to make special provision in such circumstances for pre-emption. Mr.Rendel regarded it as of great importance that any conditions made by H.M.G. regarding safeguards, British control, pre-emption etc., should he of universal application. He thought that if we demanded certain conditions from the A.P.O.C. or I.P.C., but demanded different or stiffer conditions from a purely u.S. Company, our international position would he much more difficult, since the U.S.Government would certainly accuse us of differentiation. If, on the other hand, we could work out conditions which would he applicable universally irrespective of the nationality of the concessionary Company and could he defended on merits in view of the political situation, our hands would he much strengthened in dealing with possible eventual representations of the U.S. or any other foreign Government. Mr.Laithwaite expressed agreement as regards the impo of making our conditions universally applicable. He asked what importance was attached to a special safeguard for refining locally ? Itr.Eendel said he had the impression that the A.P. 0. C.would object to being required to refine in Mr.Starling suggested that they might oe asked to ag refine in Qatar or in British territory, and this was agreed. After further discussion it was agreed ,subject to the approval of higher authority, (a) to accept in principle the procedure suggested a opening of the meeting; , the Deportments (b) that a letter (to be concurred in by ^ ono ^ r , ttd)■'7 4^C'&lt; rl % * I 12 . concerned) should be sent by the India Office to Mr.Hearn in the course of next week, suggesting in the first place the adoption of the procedure which had been discussed as between the Sheikh *and the Company, and the Company and secondly, recording t^e points on which agreement had been reached or which had been raised but not disposed of in the discussions with Mr.Fraser and Mr. Hearn on 14th December; thirdly, indicating in .general terms the nature of the, points (including safeguards &amp;c. ) which would desire to see covered in the proposed subsidiary agreement 'between the Company and themselves. It would be desirable, in dealing with this last point, not to intimate a ^ipion to the Company. The points in question were controversial and - the risk apart of deterring the A.P.O.C. from proceeding with negotiations if they were stated in too categorical terms at this stage - it might be some time before H.M.G. had themselves reached decisions on them. It would probably therefore be preferable to indicate them in outline and say that a more detailed statement would follow; that we should be prepared to discuss them further with the Canpany if necessary latex , out that in the interest of clearing the ground for their ccrnmercial negotiations with the Sheikh, we thought it undesirable . + . ^ nlir , oomm ent on the draft agreement and postpone communication ot our cammeno on the question of procedure until the special desid H.M.G. had been more fully elaborated. B • .Amendm e nts in Revised._Dr aft^C^aP^ The meeting then considered and approved the amendments which had been provisionally agreed or on 14th December with Mr. Fraser and in articles of the revised draft other than Article and reached agreement as t o the supiolementary poin be raised with the A.P. O.C. on the articles in question. (These are set out in the enclosure to the draft letter13. to the Company attached). Subject to their acceptance and to a satisfactory solution of the problems raised by Article 12, the meeting agreed that the revised draft concession which had been submitted by the v r as generally suitable. /I.3. It may be recorded that a point raised for the first time in connection with the draft Agreement which gave rise to considerable discussion was that of the definition of the Sheikh's dominions in Article 2 (c). The Southern and Western frontier of Qatar is at present somewhat indeterminate. At the same time it is important that there should be no risk of Ibn Saud being given an opportunity to call in question the line established by the unratified nnglo Turkish Convention of 29th July, 1913 i.c. a line running from the coast just east of Uqair due South to parallel 20 North, on the Eastern boundary of Ncjd. If a map is attached to, or a definition included in, the concession, it will be necessary either to include in or to omit from Qatar as shown on the map or in the definition the territory between the various frontiers of Qatar as described in the Political Besident s despatch No; 41 of 24th June, 1933, to the Colonial Office, (P.2.4642/33) and the 1913 Anglo Turkish line, and this would inevitably lead to friction and controversy, particularly in vi- the fact that the Standard Oil C.mpany of California are now operating on the Hasa Coast. It was agreed therefore that it would be better to omit the map from the concession and to leave the definition as vague as possible, at any rate pending the further report on the vfhole awaited from the Political i*eeidont in question which is the Persian Gulf* The position could be frankly explained to the n. * 7»' — - ZiT7 1 14. C. Article 12 and connected questions . The meeting then turned to consider Article 12 and the questions arising out of it. it was agreed that these were: (a) British control; (h) Position ana nationality of Chief Local Representative; (c) Nationality of exploiting personnel; (d) pre-emption ana refining arrangements. The discussion on points (b), (c) and (d) may be briefly summarised as lollows:- (b) Position ana nationality of Cnief i^ocal Representative . It was very important, particularly so long as there was no resident Political Officer, that he should (as in Bahrein) be a British subject whose appointment should be approved by H.M*G. r md that he shouia be persona grata to H.MrG. It ’would oe desirable also that if and when a Political Agent was appointed, transactions between the Company and the Sheikh shouia be dealt with through the Political xvgent. The Company haa suggested that it might be easier to secure our desiderata under tills head if we expresses them as a wish rather than a demand. But Hie point seemed too important to leave open in this way. ( c ) Nationality of employees . The case on merits for requiring that, whatever the ultimate control ana nationality of any Company operating an oil concession in Qatar, local exploitation (and representation) shouia in present conditions be wholly British, had already been developed in the discussions above on procedure. It was agreed that a ruling would have to be sought on the difficult points it raised, pending which we could not commit ourselves to it as a-2 5^ 15. ( Cl ) P ^ O lii-jj U -t-Q ll cL lIcI llU Z ip- • It was agreed that an understanding as to the right Ox pro - einp u ion in uiiue oi Vvc^r was uesiraDle snci that this shouid te inaioateci to the Company. As regards refining they should, he informed that it was regarded as important that oil won should he refined either in ^atar or in British territory ana that they should he asked for sal assurance on this. The possibility of Karachi was mentioned, (a) British Control . The meeting considered the tentative redraft of Article 12 which haa been put forward by Mr. Hearn at the meeting on 14th December. 'Hie effect was to secure that any company to which the concession might be transferred would oe a inritisu Company&gt; registered in ureau jdi stain p having its principal place of business in Great Britain, and with a British subject at all tunes as Chairman, out to give any such company the rign u ^o xoxm su^siciiaiiSD under its own control to work the concession which, while enjoying the rights and accepting uie ouligavions oi the parent company under the Agreement, would ce unaer no restriction as regards nationality or British control. It was agreed that tne first paragraph of the redraft was unobjectionable so far as it went. The second, paragraph was unoDjectionaole if trie words 'except uie engagements expressed in the final sentence of bne eceding clause were omitted. There would be no objection, if the Company thought this would facilitate negotiations with the Sneikh, to leaving the Question oi dt ioisn contioi ouy of the commercial agreements to be negotiated between them and the/ ;ithe Sheikh altogether, so long as it was agreed with the A.P.O.C. that provisions to govern it satisfactory to M.ivi.G. would he included in the separate agreement to he negotiated between H.M.G# aiid the Company. It was generally felt, and Ivir. starling in particular emphasised that the A.PvO.C#, negotiating as they must as agents of the I.p.c., might find considerable difficulty in accepting in respect of subsidiary companies British control provisions such as were emoodied in Ivcr• Hearn 1 s redraft of sub-paragraph 1 of article 12 in respect of this connection kr. Starling a transferee company, m considered that the British control element in any assignee or subsidiary company would not be less, and from what Mr. Fraser had said on 11th December there was a prospect that it might be considerably more than that in the I.P.C. He was averse from asking in these conditions for a formal guarantee that it should be as large as possible and in no circumstances less than that in the I.P.C., and it was decided not to pursue tills suggestion. Mr. starling said that the points of real importance to us were, he thought, local exploitation by British personnel, the rignt of pre-emption in time of war, and the refining of any oil won either in Qatar or in British territory. The representatives of the Admiralty arid the Foreign Office suggested, after further discussion, that even if we could persuaae \ the A.P.C.C. and the I.P.C. to agree that any subsidiary ■ company should be registered and have its principal place of business in Great Britain, and a Britisn Chairman, the control/*260 17 control whicn tnis would sacure to us might not in practice prove very substantial, ana that as our ^ ^3 o a a 'i -t- i a. o jo S- ^ x a* ta were those which had been mentioned by Mr. starling, it might be that in the long run we should finu it simplest to agree with the Company not to press the British control clause on the understanding that they wouiu meet us fully as regards our other desiderata. Mr. Mendel pointed out In particular that if we could secure our main desiderata by other means, it might well be bad tactics to insist on the strict application ox the nritish conurol provisions to subsidiary companies - since tnis might only further complicate tne already delicate position of me A• r• 0 •C• on the Board of.the I.p.C. - while it would probably be possible in practice to secure by other means that subsidiary companies were under the adequate control ox their parent companies. Questions connected with the registration ana nationality of subsidiaries were often based on technical and financial considerations regarding taxation etc. and it aid not follow that the non application of the British control provisions to subsidiaries would in fact mean that those subsidiaries would escape from British control. It was finally agreed that in the letter to be sent to the Company our desiderata should be indicated in general terms and that a door should be left open lor the Company to come back, on the &gt; ground tnat it would oe unfortunate if, on hearing what our desiderata were, they decided that it would be useless to proceed with their negotiations, secondly that while the terms to be used would require careful consideration we might hint that H.M.G. as at present advised would require British control clauses/ III26/ clauses in respect ox subsiaiary companies of the nature emoodied in suo-clause 1 oi Ivil* • Hearn 1 s tentative redraft ox Article It, togetrier with an understanding as to British exploitation anu tne position ox trie Chief Local Representative, trie right oi preemption in time of war, and the refining of oil won either locally or in British territory. If as the result of further discussion we were to secure the Company's agreement to British exploitation ana representation ana an under standing as regards preempt in time of war, the question of refining might assume less importance ana need not be pressed. INDIA OFFICE. 2nd January 1934.^.8321. 3^ Sir L. Kershaw, 'Z Ti^f Qatar Oil . Qatar is a principality of some 3,000 square miles on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf in special treaty relations with H.M.G. under a treaty of 1916. The Sheikh under the terms of that treaty cannot grant any concession and cannot sell, lease, etc. any portion of his territories without the prior approval of H.M.G. 2. The principality is backward and primitive. Very few Europeans have ever entered it. Its population in 1917 was only 26,000, of whom some 10,000 are in its principal town, Dohah. The Sheikh appears to be suspicious of the intentions of H.T.G. and to be anxious so far as possible, despite his treaty with us, to have a free hand and to avoid undertaking further obligations towards us. 3. Qatar falls within the area attributed to the Iraq Petroleum Company, of which the A.P.O.C* is a subsidiary, under the International Oil Agreements Any oil concession granted to the A.P.O.C. must, therefore/2, ^ 3 2. therefore, he transferred hy them to the I.P.C. The A^P.O.G., with our approval, started negotiations with the Sheikh last year, and have obtained from him an exclusive exploring licence which expires in August 1934* The negotiations have been carried on direct between their representative and the Sheikh, as we have at present no* Political Officer in Qatar. The draft agreement produced by the A.P.O.C. appeared to us, on examination, to be unsatisfactory in various respects from the point of view of the Sheikh* It was also unsatisfactory from the point of view of H.M.G. because it gave us no security as to permanent British control or as to exclusive British exploitation of any concession granted. Since December 11th discussions have been proceeding with the A.P.O.C. on these subjects. 4. As a result, we are now in a position (with the concurrence of the other interested Departments) to inform the Company of the various amendments which we ■Bhartl- wish to see made in the draft agreement (we cannot yet tell them in so many words precisely what special safeguards H.M.G. will require in respect of British control, exploitation, etc.) The draft to Mr. Hearn (for/ ______3. for rny signature if approved) attached explains our general position ana is concurred in hy Foreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department. The specific amendments which we wish to suggest are set out in the enclosure to the draft. 5. A separate submission will he made on the question of the safeguards which we are to seek in Qatar and on the connected political questions (exercise hy the Sheikh of jurisdiction over European employees, the appointment of a local Political Officer, etc.) which the grant of any oil concession to any company will make it necessary to consider. 1^7 ■ -51The essential point to bear in mind is that, while all the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms are more or less backward, Katr is particularly so; its inhabitants are uncivilised (largely wandering Bedouin), its hinterland unadministered, its territory unexplored, and its boundaries undefined (a fact which might easily lead to disputes with Ibn Baud). In consequence of these facts, there are considerable political risks involved in the exploitation of an oil concession at all; and it is especially important that any exploitation should be so far as possible in British hands, because (a) foreigners would obviously be less amenable to the advice of our political authorities than British subjects, and (b) if foreigners got into trouble, international complications might ensue, sarere the foreign Power concerned might demand either that we should take steps to rescue its nationals (which might be extremely difficult;, or that we should permit it to intervene itself on ^heir benalx (which would make our position as the protecting Power an impossible one). It/1 '' It is therefore very desirable (a) that if possible the concessionaire should be British, or under British control, and (b) that, whether the concessionaire is British or foreign, certain safeguards - for example, in regard to the employment of British personnel - should be insisted on. It is satisfactory that the F.O. agree as to (b), though they would probably be much weaker in insisting on safeguards in the case of the Standard Oil of California than m the case of the A.P.O.C. r If the A.P.O.C. obtain the concession, they will transfer it to the I.P.C., which (counting the shares of the A.P.O.C. and of the Shell Co. - to whatever extent the latter is British) contains a large British element, but certainly less than 50%. It is possible, however, that the foreign elements in the I.P.C., or some of them, may not interest themselves in the concession, and consequently that the ultimate assignee may be a company more than 50% British. This is what ?/e (and doubtless the A.P.O.C.) hope for, but m the nature of the case there can be no guarantee. We shall apparently be able to secure, however, that the transferee company will be at any rate technically British - i.e., that it will be registered in767 the U.K., and that it shall have a British Chairman. There still, however, appears to be a possible risk that the A.P.O.C.rpight, if they obtained the concession and then for some reason lost interest m it, transfer it to one of the foreign partners in the I.P.C., which might form a company technically British, bat really Under foreign control. This risk may not be a considerable one, but in view of it I thought that it might be as well, if possible, to secure an understanding that any assignee should contain aslarge a British element as possible, and at any rate not less than that in the I.P.C. ^ ^ ^ ^ ’ difference between us and the representatives of the A.P.0.0, as regards subsidiary companies. The Co. is willing to agree that subsidiaries should be technical _ British, because (we understand) this would make them liable to British taxation. Provided that the subsidiary is fully under the control of the paient transferee company, we need not perhaps insist on our point, though we might put it again to the Go. as is proposed m the draft letter to i r. Hearn. A A further point is that there is at present Whatever the extent of British control (in the sense/sense of shareholding) in the transferee company, it is at any rate important to insist on necessary safeguards as regards the British nationality of the personnel actually operating the concession, etc. /ojp.z. 8329/33. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 29th December 1933* * kf identia lU. Dear Mr .Hearn, The revised draft of the concession which the Anglo-Persian Oil Canpany are anxious to secure in respect of the State of Qatar which was. communicated to us at our meeting with you and Mr. Fraser on the 11th December has now been examined by the Departments concerned. As you will see frcm what follows there are certain points on which we are not yet in a position to let you know in detail the views of His Majesty’s Government. But we are anxious to facilitate amd expedite so far as possible the course of your negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar and we hope ohat, even if further discussion is necessary between the Company and the representatives of His Majesty’s Government on certain points, the information contained in this letter will vo you a general idea of the position, and will enaole 9 ou wv., give the necessary instructions without delay to Mr. Chioholm 2, Procedure. We should like in the first place to make certain suggestions as regards procedure. fou will remember that in the course of the discussion on l^th Decern the attention of the Company was drawn to His Majesty Government’s desire to safeguard certain matters ^Uox. wireless and telegraphic arrangements, the relations Company with the Sheikh and the local repreoentatives His Majesty's Government etc., and the suggestion was ma your side that it would be preferable that matters these should not be included in the actual agreement the Canpany and the Sheikh and that they might egaa satisfactorily/ C.Hearn, Esq. , Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, E.C.2.satisfactorily be disposed of by a.n exchange of letters between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. As the result of further consideration we now think that the simplest course would be that there should be two agreements, the first between the Company and the Sheikh, the second betv/een the Company and His Majesty’s Government. The Agreement between the Canpany and the Sheikh would be essentially a commercial agreement which would deal with canmercial points only and would not include anything of a purely political character. It would, however, contain a clause to the effect that it should not come into force until His Majesty’s Government had given their written consent to it. This would be in accordance with the Sheikh’s treaty obligations and difficulty should not therefore arise so far as he is concerned in agreeing to it. Subject to this and to the modifications discussed below such an agreement could probably be substantially identical with the ’revised drait agreement’ which we are now considering. 3. The proposed second Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company - the completion of which would oe a condition of the approval of His Majesty’s Government to the first, or Commercial Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh - would cover points of special interest to His Majesty’s Government. We think on the whole that a formal agreement would be a more satisfactory method of dealing wiuh these questions than an exchange of letters, though on the understanding that legal effect could be given to any undertakings embodied in an exchange of letters and that such undertakings would be binding on any assignee, transferee or subsidiary company formed to operate the Q,atar concession, as well as on the original concessionaire, 'we should not regard the/the question of form as one of vital importance. The matters which His Majesty’s Government, as at present advised, contemplate that such an agreement would cover are set out in paragraph 5 and following below. I ought to make it clear that it is intended that the conditions to be embodied in this Agreement would be conditions which would apply not merely t® your Company or another British concessionaire, but to any company, of whatever nationality, which may endeavour to secure an oil concession in Qatar. 4. Amendments in ’revised draft concession ’. Bor convenience these have been set out in the enclosure to this letter. Save in respect of Article 12, on which, as you will remember, it proved impossible to reach agreement at our discussion on December 14th, and of a suggestion on Article 2, they are substantially identical with those which were th^n provisionally agreed between us and which you have already communicated to Mr. Chisholm, though there are two or three points of minor importance which were not included in your communication to Mr. Chisholm and which, according to our record, were discussed at our meeting. I 5. Content of special Agreement between Anglo-Persian Q:.i Company and His Majesty’s Governme nt. I now turn to the question of the matters to be included in the special agreement or exchange of letters referred to in paragraph 3 above between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. As already explained the requirements of His Majesty’s Government under this head will apply equally to any company, whatever its nationality, which may seek to obtain an oil concession in Qatar. As you will appreciate, certain of these matters involve c onsideration/4. consideration of points of some difficulty on which it will he necessary to consult the Government of India and the Politieal Resident in the Persian Gulf before His Majesty’s Government can reach a final decision. Partly for this reason, and partly because in the short time at our disposal it has been impossible to be certain that we have exhausted the various aspects of the matters in question, we propose at this stage to indicate them only in general outline, he will in due course, and I hope before very long, let you have a statement in greater detail and possibly in a form suitable for inclusion in an agreement of the nature which we suggest, and we shall, of course, be ready to discuss matters further if on receipt of that statement the position seems to you obscure in any respect or there are any points you wish to raise. 6. We are anxious in the first place to secure an | understanding that any sites which His Majesty's Government i may select for aeroplane or seaplane bases in Qatar m the future (at the moment there is merely an informal arrangement in regard to a particular landing ground at Dohah) shall he secure from interference. As was mentioned in our discussion on 14th December an undertaking of this nature has been given by the American interests which are operating the Bahrein oil concession. The understanding would equally apply to harbours in perhaps improbable event of His Majesty’s Government deciding at a later stage for any reason to develop a harbour in I Qatar , and it would be necessary also to cover the question of wireless and telegraphic communications. 7. Secondly, as you will remember, we have emphasised in the discussions which we have had on the question of this/Z73 5. tnis concession trie very special political conditions of Qatar. As you Ionov, it is practically unexplored by Europeans; its hinterland is unadministered, its people are backward, scattered, and unfamiliar with the elements of ordinary western civilization; danger of serious political trouble, responsibility for dealing with which would fall back on His Majesty 1 s Government, in connection with the Company 1 s activities in so far as these might either cause misunderstanding on the part of the local inhabitants or in any way affect religious or similar institutions or buildings, cannot be overlooked, and a further complication arises from the fact that the boundaries of the State of Qatar are undelimited. His Majesty 1 s Government regard it as most important in these circumstances that there should be a clear understanding with the Company (which would, of course, extend to any assignee, transferee, or subsidiary company working the concession) that they will undertake to pay due deference at all times to the wishes of the Sheikh (which His Majesty^ Government will on their side see ere not unreasonable in character) and to the advice of the political representatives of His Majesty T s Government in the Persian Gulf, whether stationed in Qatar or not. 8. Thirdly, while we are not yet in a position to make a positive proposal to you on this point, it is not improbable that His Majesty 1 s Government as at present advised will require provision to secure the same degree of British control as has been discussed with you in the case of the parent or of any transferee Company, in respect of any subsidiary companies operating the concession, of the nature embodied in sub—clause 1 of the tentative redraft of Article 12 of the revised concession which you drew up at our/~Z14 h'YrttTfJt/Lj our meeting on December 14th. In particular it will oe regarded as essential to secure that the concession is operated locally by British personnel exclusively. Provision would also have to be made in regard to the nationality and position of the Chief Local Representative of the operating Company (this would of course include the question of the channel of ccmmunication between the Chief Local Representative and the Sheikh), the refining of oil won either locally in Qatar or in British neighbouring territory, and the right oi pre-emption in time of war. These are all matters which can, we think, best be included in a separate agreement between the C cm pan y and His Majesty’s Government which would be communicated to the Sheikh but to which he would not be a party: and we feel that, other considerations apart, such an arrangement may facilitate the task oi negotiating a c cmmercial agreement with him. 9 , x hope the information contained in this letter, incomplete or provisional in character as it inevitaoly still is on certain important points, will meet your purpose. If there is anything on which you are not clear, perhaps you would be so kind as to let me know. I should be grateful if you would let me know the views of the Company on the procedure suggested, and if you would confirm that they are prepared to accept the amendments to the 'revised' concession set out in the enclosure to this letter, and also the understandings subject to which certain amendments have been inserted or omitted. .n one further point, which was mentioned in the course of our discussions, I ought perhaps to put on record that while the draft Agreement, with the modifications ana subject to the supplementary Agreement proposed, would m ■ore sent/XI 7. present circumstances be generally acceptable to Kis Majesty s Government, it would of course be understood that they are not permanently committed to the terms in question and that should the present negotiations between the Angl o-Persian Oil Company ana the Sheikh break down, or any other material alteration in the situation take place (such as the appearance of a competing company) they must reserve themselves full liberty of action. •Inoswl}’* &amp; fj, LAITHWAITE.iix XOk 'i3£X %XtLX. t 2 9 DEC 1955 .rv* w * learn, £ Bear h\ Huarn, Tiie revlmd araft of to© Britannic Haa* # Finsbury circus, cone®salon wnich t/ie A*;#o.c. ara anxious - «&lt;«w # a, ^ k Po fa* Jt ' |0: 1^1 * COPY SENT BY A^R . io/a/i^ A ©T. to secure in respect of tae ,tate of ^t&amp;r #nich was cosaiimic aoa to us at our iwotin^ witn you ana „.r* Fraser on in a ikth uecambar has no v. been a xarilneu w o tire oepaa“uroiits concerned* As you ^lil see froii* what follow a there are certain points on which o ^re not yet lii i% position uo let you know rn u stall the views of But we are anxious to facilitate ana ex pa alee so far as possible the course of / &gt;ur ne^oti, .• ionf witii true heikh of t^tar '.no wo that, even if further oi, cuss Ion Is necessary between the Company anu tuo representatives of on certain points, the infomation contained in this letter will &amp; ive you a general idea of the position, ana will emtie you to give the necessary in struct lone w; a slay to fr.

The following redraft is suggested to make the position clear:* 'or such normal extensions of such religious lands, cemeteries, or buildings, as the Sheikh may indicate....' (c) In addition to the amendments above we should like to suggest the omission of a reference to a map, at any rate at this stage. The precise boundaries of Qatar are at the moment under investigation by the political authorities. It is hoped that a very early decision will be reached regarding them and a map can best be produced ana attached when agreement has been reached on this point. The point could best be met by the omission of the words '(as shown generally on the map annexed hereto)®. (d) The Company have agreed to omit the words at the end of the first sub-paragraph “and any/any subsequent extensions thereof. H Article 3 . The Company agreed, to consider amplification of this article on the lines of Articles 12A and 13 of their Persian concession, subject to certain verbal moaifications. We suggest that the article might oe revised to read somewhat as follows:- 11 3* The Company shall make a thorough investigation of the state of Qatar by 4rticle 4. such methods as may in its opinion best enable it to ascertain its oil possibilities. In carrying out its operations under this Agreement the Company shall employ all means customary and proper and shall exploit its Concession by methods in accordance with the latest scientific progress. 'The Company undertakes to keep accurate plans, maps, sections and such other data whether topographical, geological or of drilling such as it is customary to keep and such material shall be open to inspection by the .Sheikh or his duly authorised representative. 'The Company shall supply an annual report to the .Sheikh of its operations under this Agreement.' It was agreed on December 14th that so long as (a) the financial terms to be given to the Sheikh under this article were such as to give full weight to the fact that the/ ■■■Article 5 . Article 6. j v/ 3. the Company would obtain an exclusive concession over the whole area of Qatar, which appears to he rather over 3,000 square miles, and (b) the Sheikh fully understood that the effect of acceptance of the royalty formula proposed would be that royalty would ha.ve to be paid only on oil actually exported from or sold for consumption in Q^tar and not on the oil produced, no modification of this article need be suggested. No comment. The Company agreed at the meeting on 14th December (a) to insert the words 'subject to the provisions of Article 7' after the word 'right' in the first line of this article; (b) to insert at the end of the first sub-paragraph the words 'but not otherwise' after the words ^for the purposes of its operations'; (c) The question of a special safeguard in respect of telegraphic and wireless installations was discussed in connection with this clause. We do not wish to press that this should be specifically covered in the Commercial Agreement with the Sheikh so long as it is understood that it will be included in the separate agreement to be concluded between the Company and (d) On a separate point, the Company’s representatives were very reluctant to agree to any specific safeguard for the political2 1-' ft Ml f *# &amp; C SiuJjj Article 7. V interests involved or for tne position of the oheikh in the danse, and the suggestion was made that it might he possible to meet the difficulties felt by the interested Departments of H.M.G. by an exchange of letters in which the Company would under take to give all due deference to the views of H.lvi.G-* and the Sheikh in the exercise of their rights under this article. To this we understood that the Company’s representatives agreed and so long as it is understood that the point will be covered in a separate agreement between the Company and H.M.G* we do not wish to press for its insertion here. (a) So long as the safeguards desired by H.M.G. in respect of air facilities etc. are dealt with in a separate agreement between H.M.G. and the Company, no modification of the first sub-paragraph of this article to cover this point will be necessary. (b) The Company have agreed to insert *with the consent of and* after the words ^leased by it* in the openingsentence of sub-paragraph 2. We suggest on a point of drafting that in the same sentence the worda H but the terms of such purchase or lease shall not be in excess” etc. should be substituted for the words 'but such conditions ^iall not be in excess.' Article 8/company, registered in Great Britain, having its principal place of business in Great Britain, and Idle Chairman shall at all times be a British subject.' The Company shall be at liberty to form one or more subsidiary companies under its own control should it consider this to be necessary for the working of this concession. Any such subsidiary company shall, so far as they are applicable to its operations, enjoy all the rights and privileges granted to the Company hereunder, and shall assume all the engagements and responsibilities herein expressed, except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause.' The redraft in question has been further considered by the interested Departments of H.M.G. Their position in regard to British control, British exploitation, the position and nationality of the Chief Local Representative, etc. in any oil concession in Qp,tar is referred to in paragraph 8 of the covering letter, though, as there stated, they are not yet In a position to set out their minimum conaitions in so many words. So far as the commercial agreement between the Company and the Sheikh is concerned they would however be content to accept as Article 12 the first two sentences of sub para. 1 of Mr. Hearn's redraft and sub-para.2 of the same redraft less the words 'except the engagement expressed in the final sentena of the preceding clause' and to omit any reference to British control from the commercial/1 . s 1 7 * j coianercial agreement with the Sheikh ao long as it was understood that the question would oe covered in a separate on a point of drafting, it is suggested that the word 'Agreement' be substituted for the word 'Concession' in the first sentence of sub-para.2 ®f the redraft. Tne Company agreed, subject to discussion with the Shell Company, to the insertion in sub-para 2 of a provision that 'producing wells or borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit fc“ further working” and to make a for the words 'in such working condition as the property then is' in sub- para.2 and 3. We have not yet heard the result of their discussion: but we note that Article 20 (II) and (III) of the revised Persian Concession requires wells to be handed over in good order and that there appear to be no lack of precedents for a provision of this nature (e.g. in the Brunei concession, which is operated by the Shell Company, Clause 19 reads: *19. The Lessees shall (save in respect of any operations of vhich the Lessor shall have sanctioned the abandonments «+, the end nr* agreement Detween H.M, G. and the Company corresponding amendment in substitution8. Article 15 Article 16. condition and fit for further working all productive wells or borings which shall have been made by the Lessees under the liberty and power in that behalf herein before contained...'; while the Iraq concessions both of the I.p.c. and the British Oil Development provide that “the Company shall maintain in good working order a.11 wells drilled so long as they are economically productive.”) It was suggested to the Company, who, it is understood, saw no objection, that the words “the period of such delay, together with any such period as may be necessary for the restoration of' might be amended, in the interests of the Sfreikh, to read 'the period of such delay together with such period as may be reasonably necessary, subject to the approval (or in the view) of the Political Resident, for the restoration, etc.* It was made clear at the meeting on 14th December that H.M.G. attached importance to the restoration of the Political Resident in substitution for the Court of Internation al Justice as the person to be responsible for nominating the third arbitrator. It was understood that the Company saw no objection to this. H.M.G., while attaching importance to the modification, see no objection to the Company's postponing comnunication of it to the sheikh until their negotiations with him have reached a more advanced stage. When such/Article 17 . m 3j^ 1L such a conrnunication is made they are equally willing that the Company should inform the Sheikh that the modification is made at the request of who have intimated that it is in accordance with th practice in other Persian Gulf oil concessions and that they must make it an essential condition of any concession granted to any company, (a) The Company agreed, in the second sentence of the article, to add the word •suitable' before the word •labourers' in line 5, and to delete the words 'or demand unreasonable wages.' (b) They have also indicated that they would welcome the exercise of jurisdiction by H.M.G. and that they are not prepared to accede to the Sheikh r s request that he should exercise jurisdiction in disputes between their employees and his subjects. The question of jurisdiction is one which can most suitably be decided in direct discussion between the Sheikh and H.M.G.

This, as indicated in para.8 of the covering letter, is a matter which, in the view of H.M.G., can most suitably be covered in the agreement to be reached between them and the Company, and on the understanding/understanding that it will he disposed of in that connection they do not desire to suggest any modification of the terms of the article.

PETROLEUM DEPARTMENT, (Mines Department,) Dean Stanley Street Millbank, Westminster, London, S. 23rd December, 1933 Dear Laithwaite, Arising out of our recent discussion on the Qatar Concession, I undertook to let you have the terms of Clauses 12 (a) and 13(1st and 3rd paragraphs) of the Anglo-persian Oil Company's Persian Concession. I enclose a copy herewith. The point arises on Article 3 of the araft Concession and I suggest that this Article might be revised to read somewhat as follows: The Company shall make a thorough investigation of the State of Qatar by such methods as may in its opinion best enable it to ascertain its oil possibilities. In carrying out its operations under this Agreement the Company shall employ all means customary and proper and to exploit its Concession by methods in accordance with the latest scientific progress. The Company undertakes to keep accurate oopioo plans, maps, sections and such other data whether topographical, geological or of drilling^aS it is customary to keep and such material shall be open to inspection by the Sheikh or his duly authorised representative. The Company shall supply an annual report to the Sheikh of its operations under this Agreement. u omcr ite ’ Es&lt;1 -’ teiiali, S.Vl.- 2 - I also undertook to let you have a note on Article 13 as to handing over productive wells in good condition. Apparently the Shell are objecting to our suggested clause. There are plenty of precedents for such a provision. In the Brunei Concession which the Shell has there is a clause which reads 19. The Lessees shall (save in respect of any operations of which the Lessor shall have sanctioned the abandonment) at the end or sooner determination of the said term deliver up to the Lessor in good order repair and condition and fit for further working all productive wells or borings which shall have been made by the Lessees under the liberty and power in that behalf hereinbefore contained Article 20 (II) and (ill) of the revised Persian Concession also requires -wells to be handed over in good order. In the Iraq Petroleum Company and British Oil Development Concessions in Iraq, this matter is not mentioned in the surrender clause, but there is a provision that w the Company shall maintain in good working order all wells drilled so long as they are economically productive”. This I think is just as effective. But the Anglo-Persian Oil Company may argue that our proposed additions to Article 3 will give the same result. I think that at this stage we might put our proposed Clause to the Company but if they accept our suggested alterations to Article 3 I think we might later on let Article 13 stand as it is. Yours sincerely,' ■ Z &lt;: t Extract from 'Anglo-Persian oil Company Ltd. Persian Concession, 1933 - 1993 .' ARTICLE 12.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 21st December 1933. % dear McClaughry, I write with reference to our recent telephone conversation to say that the A.P.O.C. are now pressing on wloh their endeavours to secure an oil concession from ohe Sheikh of Qatar in respect of the whole of his ^enioory. a copy ox a revised draft concession which they have recently communicated to us informally is enclosed. As you will see, the draft contains no provision to safeguard our position in respect of aerodromes, present or future, in Qatar. We are, of course, in the difficulty that at the moment we have no regular aerodrome, hut merely the emergency lancing ground which has oeen marked out with hags of chalk consequent on the ^ 6 '^Gompany^s Sal giV6 US ws want.

The Company were very reluctant to agree to this, but ultimately indicated their readiness to consider dealing with the point in an exchange of letters. The draft agreement raises various important Questions of policy and will necessitate further examination of the general safeguards which it might be thought desirable to ask the Company to agree to (either in the concession itself or in a subsidiary agreement or exchange of letters between H.M.C. ana the Company) as a condition of our consent to their proposals. We should be very grateful in these circumstances if you could let us/terms, what your views are as regards future air requirements* If, by any chance, consequent on the grant of an oil concession to the A.P.O.C. (or any other competitor) we had to reach a general agreement with the Sheikh on questions such as jurisdiction and the maintenance of a political representative in Qatar it might well be that the opportunity would be a convenient one to dispose of the question of air facilities. 5. I am sending copies of this letter to Bendel at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty, and Starling at the Petroleum Department. Yours sincerely, J.G.

The meeting followed immediately al meeting, a note of which has 'been o n th e in t e r a e pa rtme it - circulated under P.2.8073/23. Mr. Fraser was present only for the first half oi the discussion, ihe note which follows records tne points on which agreement was reached with the Company anu. deals in greater detail with the discussion which took place on the question of Article 12. It was made clear to the representatives of the A.p.o.C. Defore the discussion began that while the draft concession riad been informally examined interdepartmentally the results of that examination had not yet been laid before higher auuiority and that the discussion would pro-ceed on that oasis. On the other hana, it was understood that the Company would welcome any immediate indication of the points on which difficulty was likely to be felt by so tnat they could inform Mr. Chisholm, in the event of nis resuming negotiations with the sheikh of Qatar before 17th December, of the line which he should take. COPY CENT ffY AI Q f Article 2/3 2. ^rtTICLE 2 . (a) The Company were Informed that while H.M.G. had !| not as yet any regular aerodrome in qatar it was to he anticipated that aerodromes would os estaolished there in mie rutui g and tney wore anxious to secure safeguards in respect of tnem f rom the Company. They had secured similar safeguards from the Bahrein Petroleum Company , by an exchange of letters, In the case of Bahrein. H.M.G. would probably also wish to obtain a similar understanding that any wireless arrangements which they might make in the future would not be obstructed by the operations of the Company. Mr. Fraser was very averse from the inclusion of any specific provision in Article 2 to cover these points, but thought tnat they could be satisfactorily disposed of by an e xchange of letters. It was agreed that the India Office should suggest drafts to the Company. (b) The Company agreed tnat the words H or such normal extensions thereof as might be indicated by the sheikh' referred to religious lands and religious buildings. They were understood to be willing to improve the drafting sd as to make this clear. (c) The Company agreed to emit at the end of the first sub-paragraph the words 'and any subsequent extensions thereof.' APTICLB B . Mr. Starling pointed out to the Company that the article as it stood was very vague. It seemed desirable to amplify it on the lines of Articles 12A and 13 (first and third paragraphs) of the Company’s Persian concession, so as to make more specific their obligation to pursue the development of the oil resources of the territory and to use the latest scientific measures in doing/3/6 3. doing so. Mr. Frassr incilcat/Sd. tlie Company were reluctant to assume deiinite drilling odligations and that no reference had therefore been made to such obligations in the article. These obligations if undertaken would be very expensive to the Company and if they did not result in production of no benefit to the Sheikh. They would much prefer to improve the finaneial terms given to the sheikh. It was pointed out to him that if drilling operations were unsuccessful the Company had the right to determine the concession after notice under the conditions of Article 13. After further aiscussion the Company agreed to consider amplification of this article on the lines of Articles 12 a ana 13 of the Persian concession subject to certain verbal modifications. Inis would involve the acceptance by them of an obligation to carry out operations in a proper manner and to keep plans ana other data which would be made available to the Government. Adl'lChh 4 . Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that under the concession as drafted the Company would obtain an exclusive concession over the whole area of Qatar, apparently rather more than 3,000 square miles. Thii clearly was a fact which we should have to take into consideration in considering whether the financial terms, when these were communicated to us, were satisfactory. It was obvious that if the Sheikh were to grant them a mining lease in respect of a portion of his territory only he would be at liberty (as had happened in the case of the Sheikh of Bahrein) to entertain competing offers from other oil interests in respect or the balance of the territory. He also drew attention to the fact tnat die draft/in 4. draft embodied the formula which appeared in the case of ori6 psrbiciii conceiDbion in psspGcij of friG poyiiionf of roysl’ty» tiio cffocf 'being uiictf roydlfy would, iiave fo bo paid only on oil actually exported from or sold for c on sump t ion in Qa ta r an cl no t on the oil p rod uc e d. Ivn# Fraser said that in his view the provision was a perfectly fair one. Certain grades of oil products often involved in certain conditions loss in manufacture. For example, if there were an expanding market for motor spirit but not for heavier products, it was to everyone^ advantage that as much of the light stuff should be sold as possible. This would be impracticable if the Company had to pay a royalty on all oil tnat was produced* The A*P*0»C bad for some time overcome this difficulty by returning the heavier products to the ground where they once again aosorbed light products and gases. The Persian Government had accepted the formula now suggested after a fuil discussion. Mr. Starling said that the adoption of this formula represented a new departure and was regarded as a matter of considerable importance. He had therefore taken instructions on it* It was obvious that the adoption of the formula suggested might have a material effect on the financial consideration granted to the Sheikh. He did not suggest that the arrangement was a bad one so long as the Sheikh appreciated what it meant. After further discussion it was agreed that the provision might be allowed to stand. The official representatives emphasised the importance of making clear to the Sheikh what exactly was involved in it. Mr. Fraser said that he thought the sheikh fully understood its effect. Article 6/5. 311? ARTICLE 6 . (a) The Co nip any agreed to make the provisions of this article specifically subject to the Compensatory provision of Article 7. (h) Mr. Laithwaite emphasised the possibility of political difficulties arising if the article was allowed to stano. in its present form, on the lines which had been a and developed the argument greed by the preceding official interdepartmental conference. He suggested that the rights granted under the first sub-paragraph of Article 6 should be made 'suDject to the agreement of the Sheikh, which shall not. be unreasonably withheld.” The A.r.0.u. repi esentatives said that they could not agree to uhib. me only effect would be tnat the sheikh would hold the Company to ransom each time the necessity for his approval arose. In their view the phrase 'which shall not be unreasonably withheld' was one which in practice was no safeguard. Their experience of the sheikh went to show that he would lose no opportunity of opening his mouth as wide as possible. Mr. Hearn added that provision on the same lines was included in the Company’s Persian agreement. Mr. Laithwaite said that that might be so, but that the political position in Qatar, with its wide hinterland and its extremely backward condition and semi- civilised inhabitants, was entirely different from that in Persia or Iraq, where there was a central government and &amp; more or less effective control by that government over the whole country. It was understandable that the Company should wish for some safeguard in respect of their technical establishments, such as refineries, workshops, etc., but it w as conceivable that serious difficulties might arise in the event of their wishing to operate inland or to establish/I 6. establish wireless stations, etc. iVir. star 1 ing po in ted. out that in the hasa a,greernent the facilities was specifically left to subsequent agreement. arrangement of air be settled in a The official representatives suggested that as a compromise it might oe possible to distinguish between essential oil operations (which might include telephones for local communication) and general communications such as telegraph ana wireless. The Company’s representatives were very reluctant to agree. Mr. Laithwaite said that there were important political interests to be safeguarded which we coulu not overlook. He did not Know that there was anything very material in the form of the understanding reached with the Company so long as it was binding. If it would ease matters it might be possible to meet the situation by an exchange of letters, in which the Company would undertake to give all due deference to the views of H.M.G. and the ,Sheikh in the exercise of their rights under this article. The Company agreed to this suggestion. They further accepted a suggestion that the words f, but not otherwise' should be added after the words 'for the purposes of its operations' in line 5 of Article 6. (c) Trie Company said that sub-paragraph (ii) of Article 6 had been inserted in deference to the Sheikh's ^lews• ABTIGLS 7 . (a) it was agreed that if the safeguards desired by H.M.G. in respect of aerodromes were ultimately not included in the agreement but embodied in an exchange of letters, a froaification of the first sub -paragraph of this article woula be unnecessary. The attention of the Company was drawn/I • drawn to the tact tn&amp;t the ownership of certain areas in Qatar might vest in a trice and. not in the Sheikh. (h) suh-paragraph (ii). The Company after discussior agreed to tne revision of the opening sentence to run; Auy other lands, houses or buildings required oy the Company may he hougnt or leased hy it with the consent and on conditions to he arranged with the proprietors whereof, hut uiuterms of such purchase or lease shall not he in excess, etc.' (c) The phrase 'and such land less than tne whole cirea of Qatar' been inserted by the sheikh. shall at all times he had, the Company stated ARTICLE 8 . ouo-paiagraph (i). Second sentence. The Company ^re-d to make tnis sentence suDject to the same proviso as that set out in the first sentence. ARTICLE IQ . In connection with this article the question was raised whether the Company’s operations should he free of harbour aues and what the position of the sheikh would he in respect of any harbours which they might develop in Qatar for their own purposes. Mr. Hearn saw no objection to the adult ion of a provision that the sheikh 'shall have uhe right to use harbours utilised or constructed by the Company provided that such use in no way hampers the Company or interferes with the safety of its operations.' He expressed the opinion that it was not improbable that no regular harbour might be developed since oil exported would probably be taken out to sea by a submarine pipe and &amp;U that might be necessary would be a pier for landing purposes. Article 11/ARTICLE 11 . Ivlr. Laitmvaite ruferrsd to the correspondence which had taken place between Mr. Elkington and the Political Resident on the subject of the Sheikh's request to be supplied with iilles etc, by the Gonrpany. He said that H.M.G. agreed with the views expressed by the Resident, and that in any case the ,Sheikh's request was in contravention of his treaty obligations. Mr. Fraser said that the Company quite agreed tnat there could be no question of meeting trie Sheikh's request on this point and that this had been made clear to Mr. Chisholm. APTIOLE IS . Mr. Laithwaite said that he wished to repeat that this article, which was obviously of great importance, was one on which H.M.G. could not commit tnemselves at the present stage. At the same time he and Mr. Starling would be glad to discuss it with the Company with a view to clearing the ground so far as possible. It has been recognised that the Company were negotiating in Qatar on behalf of the I.P.C. * which was an international bo ay with a British percentage substantially less than half of the share holding, and Mr. Fraser had made it clear at a recent meeting that the ioreign interests represented in the I.P.C. could claim a voice in proportion to their interest in the operation of dny concessions which might be granted. The question of safeguards had, however, never been discussed in any detail in connection with the Company's negotiations and H.M.G., while difficulty need not probably be anticipated with them as regards formal transfer of any concession obtained to the I.p.C., would probably attach the greatest importance to securing that the exploitation of the concession/9. $ concession was oy British personnel ana that certain other safeguards for its British character were included; notatly, that the Company should he registered in Great Britain, with offices in London, and a British Chairman, ana prohahly that a proportion of its Board should he British. It would also he necessary to consider the question of the Chief Local Representative in Qatar, hut that could he considered separately. He thought that it would also he considered desirable that the approval of the Cheikh should he required to any assignment. He suggested that Article 12 might he amended to read ’’The Company shall he and remain a British Company, registered in Great Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times he a British subject. Subject to these conditions and to the approval of the Sheikh and on conditions laid down by him, it shall have the right to transfer this agreement to any other commercial company, hut not to any government^ subject to such company being able to fulfil ail the duties and obligations of this agreement. The Company shall Inform the Sheikh if it so transfers tnis agreement. ’’The Company shall also have the right to iorm one or more subsidiary commercial companies under its own control for the working of this agreement, which shall enjoy tn-a rights and privileges and assume the engagements herein expressed. Alternatively, we might specifically provide in the first sub-paragraph for transfer to tire I.P.C., if that was what the Company wanted to cover, leaving the second sub- paragraph as redrafted above. Mr. Fraser did not consider that the second alternative would be acceptable to tne Company. In the first place, the I.F.C. might never want this concession and/323 10 . and it wa^ quite conceivable that it might be taken up by the A.P.O.C. and the Shell only. But he thought that the I.P.O. would see objection to the proposed redraft of sub-paragraph 1 and he was quite clear that there would be very serious difficulty as regards the proposed orovision in the case of sub-paragraph 2. Save on the question of British control he saw, however, no objection to making any assignment subject to the conditions of the agreement as it now stood. He was opposed, however, to giving the Sheikh any voice in approving the assignment. As he had made clear elsewhere, the Sheikh would use any right, however unsubstantial, given him under the agreement, to extort larger sums of money. As regards the composition of any assignee company, Mr. Fraser and Mr. Hearn said that their difficulties, if they endeavoured to force a British assignee company upon the Board of the I.P.C., would be very great indeed. /Mr. Fraser left at this stag§7 Mr. Hearn pointed out that Mr. Fraser had oeen entrusted with the negotiations in respect oi this concession by the I.P.C., whom he must be regarded as representing. I'he I.P.O. was an international concern and it was most important not to give its Board anv feeling that through allowing negotiations to be handled by the A.P.O.G. thev had sacrificed their interests. One point o of particular importance in this connection Was that ii a Company was registered in Great Britain, wit/i its headquarters in this country, it would become liable to U.K. taxation, foreign element in It was unreasonable to expect the the I.P.C. to submit to U.K. taxation on/on the Company f 8 turnover. Hr. Laithv/aite enquired whether it would oe po os idle to meet this point bv providing that a subsidiary Company might be registered, for example, in Canada, emphasising, however, that he did so purely as a suggestion and without any authority. Mr. Hearn, however, apparently thought that the same diifioulties as regards British exploitation and control would still have to be faced with the I.P.G., if an attempt were made to impose conditions on these points. After considerable further discussion it proved impossible to reach any agreement on this point. Mr. Hearn was not prepared to go beyond the following redraft of Article 12, which might, he thought* without committing himself, be acceptable to the I.P.C. ‘ ABTICIZ 1 2. The Company shall have the right to transfer this agreement to any other British commercial company, but not to any government, subject to such Companv being able to fulfil all the duties and obligations of this agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh if it so transfers this agreement. ouch other commercial company shall be and remain a British company, registered in Croat Britain, having its principal place of business in Croat Britain,' and the Chairman shall at all times be a —j British subject.'* ‘'The Company shall be at liberty to form one or more subsidiary companies under its own control should it consider this to be necessary for the working of this concession. Any such subsidiary company shall, so far as they arc applicable to its operations, enjoy all the rights/3 ** 12 . rights and privileges granted to the Company hereunder, and shall assume all the engagements and responsibilities herein expressed, except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause. 1 ' * . * Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that while paragraph 1 of the redraft accepted certain safeguards, the under the terms of paragraph 2, would he completely free immediately on the transfer of the concession to them by the A«P.O*0. to form subsidiary companies to operate the concession which would he wholly foreign. The prospects of H.M.Gr. modifying their requirements were very small and if the redraft represented the best the Company could do it might be that the negotiations would break down. AilkSti nn . _q f Gh jel„, Lp ,qs1 2kpresejitaMve. Mr. Laithwaite said that the question of the Company f s representation in Qatar was one of some importance to H JLd. Lhat arrangements did they contemplate? Mr. Hearn said that probably at first there might be a Fields Manager, or possibly even a geologist: in either event a man of some little standing, Mr. Laithwaite said that here, as in Bahrein, would probably regard it as of great importance tnat the C.L.P, of the Company (particularly so long as there was no Political Agent in Qatar) should be a British subject, persons grata to and appointed with their approval, Mr. Hearn said that he thought that the prospect of persuading the Board of the I.P*0. to agree to this might be greater if H.M.GL were to express it as a wish rather than as a demand. The point was not further discussed. ARTICLE 13/A5TI0LE 13 . The 13. Company agreed to consider the insertion in sub-paragraph fii) of a provision that ^producing wells 01 borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working*', and to make a corresponding amendment in sub-paragraphs fii) and (iii) in substitution for cho words in such working condition as the property Shell Company who were co-operating with the A.P.O.G. in this matter. (a) The Company stated that the Sheikh had been anxious to restrict force majeure to conditions to any such restriction and had made it clear that the clause must be in quite general terms. ”the period of such delay, together with any such period as may be necessary for the restoration of n might be amended to read : 'tho period of such delay together with such period as may be reasonably necessary, subject to the approval (or in the view) of the Political Besident, for the restoration, etc.’* The Company saw no objection, but pointed out that it was the Sheikh who was anxious to keep the Political Besident Mr. Laithwaite said that H.M.C. attached importance to providing that the Political Resident This would have to be discussed with the ART I GIB 15 in Qatar. The Company wore quite unable to agree Co) Mr. Laithwaite suggested that the words out. hould/J27 14 should be the person responsible for nominating the t.aird arbitrator. Ihe Oompany said that they were perfectly willing to accept the Political Evident. Ths Gourt of International Justice had been substituted in deference to the dheikh, who had indicated that he saw objection to bringing in the Political Resident and wished for some other authority. The Ooananv x «&lt; had thereupon originally suggested the President of the Gourt of International Justice, to which the uuoixLt 1A ad replied that he might be an Englishman, and in these circumstances the Court had been substituted. h was agreed that there was no need for Mr. Chisholm to raise this point with the Sheikh at the present time. ARTICLE 17 . The attention of the Company was dr asm to the fact that this article as it stood raised several very important questions. U) Jurisdiction . This had been referred to in the discussion at the India Office on 11th December. The Company stated that they would welcome the exercise of jurisdiction by HJLO. and had already made it clear that they were nor- prepared to agree to the °heikh f s request that he should exercise jurisdiction in disputes between their employees and his subjects. (b) The Company agreed in the second sentence of the article to add the word i? suitable” in front of the word “labourers” in line 5 and to delete the words “or demand unreasonable wages”.. (c)/15. (o) Mr. I.aithwaitc drew attention to the fact that here, as in connection with articles 2 and 7, Serious risks of political' difficulty were involved, ine introduccion of labourers from outside might well cause considerable local difficulties. Thi-° was a point v/iiich H.M. 1 ., on whom would fall the burden of dealing wiih a serious local situation, if one arose, must consider in deciding the terms subject to which they were prepared to approve the concession. He added that the terms of the article as it stood left the question of the nationality/ of non-Asiatic employees open. Hould it be possible to have an understanding, if not a positive guarantee, that employees v/ould in fact be British? The difficulties in connection with any employment of foreign employees were real, Mr, Hearn pointed out the difficulties to be anticipated in securing agreement on the part of the I.P.O,,to any such understanding. They could do no more than put it to the Board. They would be quite willing to do this if we asked them to do so. The fact that the American interests in Bahrein had agreed to a special provision might possibly ease matters, and he awreed that a reference to that fact and to the special treaty relations of H.M.G-. might be made in any communication which we sent on the subject to the Tcmpany. The Company intimated that they intended to stand out for an Arabic and an English text. The/321 16. The following general points wore put to the Company. (a) The possibility of the revision of the concession after a certain period. As drafted it ran for 75 years ~ a very long period: longer than either that of their concession in Persia or of the American concession in Bahrein. It might be to their interests as well as to those of the Sheikh to have some provision for revision at an earlier date. The Company said they were strongly averse from agreeing to any such provision. It would merely put them in the hands of the Sheikh. They would much prefer to leave matters, as they were. It would be a considerable time before they knew where they stood in respect of oil in Qatar. (b) It was made clear to the representatives of the Company that while subject to their being satisfied that the interests of the oheikh were secured and that their own special interests ana responsibilities wore also adequately safeguarded, might now be prepared to approve certain terms in a concession put forward by the A.P.0.0, in the interests of assisting the A.P.O.C. to secure the concession, they were not to be taken as in any way tying their hands as regards the future. If the A.P.0.0. failed now io secure the concession from the Sncimh on -ucli toms as H.M.S. might approve and if subsequently other parties, c.g. the Standard Oil, came into the field, H.M.G. must regard their hands as entirely fruc, and th^ term,, of any concession would have to form thu suoj^ct of further discussion. The Company said that they appreciated the position. (c)/330 17, (c) Considerable emphasis was laid at earlier stages in the discussion on the special responsibilities of H.M.GL and the fact that the unsettled and uncivilised nature of Qatar and the fact that it was neither an island, like Bahrein, which could easily be controlled from the sea, nor in a more or less advanced state of civilisation, like Persia or Iraq, made it necessarv for H.M.O. to watch all developments very closely and to take special precautions which might not otherwise be necessary or appropriate, and for the Company on its side to exercise extreme caution in taking advantage of certain of the rights given them under concessions and in their dealings with the local authorities and population. The representatives of the Company appeared to understand the position, and it was agreed, in connection with articles 2, 6, and 17 (see record) that their specific attention should be drawn to these facts. Mr. Hearn said that he thought it would be possible to inform Mr. Chisholm by telegraph of the more important amendments which had been agreed at the meeting. As it was clear that the question of Article 12 was still entirely open and would necessitate further consideration and discussion, Mr. Chisholm would be instructed to avoid committing himself in any way regarding it.

It was proposed that it should be followed the same afternoon by a further meeting between Messrs. Fraser and Hearn of the A.P«O.C.r at which Mr. Starling and Mr. Laithwaite, in the light of the views expressed by the Departments, could indicate in general terms the directions in which it was desired to amend their draft. It would of course be impossible to commit H.M.G. in any way on the major question of assignment. Neither on this question, nor, indeed, on the details of tne draft, had instructions yet been taken from higher authority. But if amendments Fr not raising points of principle, but representing improvements from our point of view, could be secured in the draft in the course of discussion, with trie Company's representatives, no difficulty would presumably be seen.33 £ 2 . The other Departments concerned expressed their general agreement, in particular as to the importance of avoiding any camnitment on the question of assignment or safeguards. The meeting then proceeded to consider the revised draft put forward 'by the Company. It was agreed that no question arose on this. A-i. Attention was drawn to the fact that the revised article gave exclusive rights 'throughout the State of Q,atar. M The area involved was, so far as could be estimated, something over 3,000 square miles. It was decided that no objection need be taken to the grant of an exclusive concession to the Company and that it was unnecessary to require that the rights of exploration, prospecting and mining should be specified in separate schedules. The Petroleum Department drew attention to the fact that the article as revised gave the Company the exclusive right to 'carry away' the substances which it was entitled to secure, but saw no objection to this, as the Company was the sole coneessionnaire and there was no provision for surrendering a part of the territ ory. Mr.Laithwaite said that the Government of India had sent a reminder to the Political Resident on the question of the boundaries of Qatar. If this question was raised by the Company it would be better not to commit ourselves. We could wait to see what map they produced. The Foreign Office representatives emphasised that they attached importance to this question, since an inaccurate definition of the boundary might lead to trouble with Ion Saud. Article 2. The following points were raised: (a) the desirability of making provision to safeguard the position of aerodromes. It was agreed that this snould be put to the Company, though the decision was con plicated by the fact that we had not yet acquired a permanent site. In reply to a question by Mr .Laithwaite as to the probability of any specialC 3. Admiralty interest developing in connection with harbours, Captain King expressed the opinion that it was unnecessary to make special provision for this at the present time. (b) It was not clear whether the words u any such normal extensions thereof” referred to extensions of the Asreoment or to extensions of religious lands, thougji presumably to the letter. It was agreed that the Company should be asked to make the position clear, but that no objection.neea be raised if the assumption stated was correct. (c) The phrase at the end of sub-paragraph 1 !, and ary subsequent extensions thereof' appeared dangerously wiae. We were dealing with a period of 75 years and it was conceivable that difficult political problems might arise if the sheikh or one of his successors were, e.g., to conquer a portion oi Saudi Arabia or, to take an extreme case, to occupy Bahrein. It was agreed that the Company should he invited to omit the words. (a) Period of agreement . No objection was seen to an agreement for 75 years, although this period was longer than that of the Bahrein ana Persian concessions. (e) The petroleum Department said that it was unnecessary to specify areas for mining purposes under this article now that it was proposed to Company rights over the whole area oi tne 0 ive the State. (f) .Attention was drawn by the India Office to the fact that in a semi would be necessary warily in anything susceptibilities. -civilised area such as Qatar it for the Company to walk extremely which might offend religious We should find ourselves faced with responsibility for safeguarding their interests in the event of serious trouble breaking out and it would be well/4. well to impress upon them the delicacy of the position. The meeting agreed and thought that this might be put to the Ccsnpany as a general point in connection with the concession. (g) Te rri t oria 1^ wat^e rs . ihe Question was raised whether territorial waters were covered by the draft concession. It was agreed that they were included under the terms of Article 1. Arti.clftJLs. The Petroleum Department suggested that it would be desirable further to safeguard the interests of the Sheikh by amplifying this article on the general lines of Articles 12A and 13 (paragraphs 1 and 3) of the A.P.O.C.'s Persian concession, which provided for carrying out operations in a proper manner and also dealt with the keeping of plans, and other data which were to be made available to the Government. It was agreed that this should be put to the Ccmpary. Article 4^ This article v/as likely to be that of the greatest importance to the Sheikh. The Foreign Office representatives expressed the general view that, subject to consideration of our own interests and those of the Sheikh, it was desirable to meet the A.P.O.C. so far as possiole over tne terms of this concession since any delay in settlement increased the risk that American interests might be brought in. The Petroleum Department agreed, and the Admiralty said that they thought their higher authorities would probably also agree, subject to the reservations in question, as did Mr.Laithwaite. Mr.Laithwait e said that the Company had already made it clear that they did not wish to disclose their bargaining figures at the manent and we could not very well press them to do so. On the other hand, it would be material, in considering the terms to be accepted, that under the present concession they were to receive an exclusive licence in respect of the whole area of Qatar - some 3,000 square miles. Mr■Starling said that the use of the phrase 'exported from or sold for consumption in' raised an important point. This formula was one which had been used in the Persian concession. The/The effect would be that the Company would not pay royalty on any oil used locally; on wastage, on loss in refining if done in Qatar, or on oil which might be returned to ground. He had regarded the point as so material that he had taken the instructions of higher authority on it. As a result he expressed the opinion that it was unnecessary to take exception to it, so long as the financial terms offered by the Company proved adequate, (i.e. such as adequately to safeguard the Sheikh’s % interests after taking into account the possible effect on his receipts of the fact that royalty would be paid not on all oil produced, but only on such oil as was exported from or sold for consumption in Qatar) though it seemed desirable that the Sheikh should fully understand what was involved. Article 5. In the light of Mr. Starling’s statement on Article 4 it was agreed that no question need be raised as to the use of the words ”exported from or sold for consumption in” instead of some phrase such as ’’produced”. Article 6. (a) It was agreed that it would be desirable t o make the provisions of this article specifically subject to the compensation provisions of Article 7 (as in the case of Article 2 of the revised draft).. (b) Considerable discussion took place as to the risks involved in giving the Company an absolute right &gt; as in the terms of the article, in any circumstances, to construct conmunications, railways , refineries, etc. The meeting mere reminded of the difficulties which had arisen m Hasa in connection with the provision of landing grounds for aeropl , and elsewhere in Saudi Arabia in connection with wireless Local prejudices and the danger of inflaming the r&gt;edouin been alleged by Ibn Saud as a reason for postponing action or refusing concessions. If similar difficulty arose in Qatar our position, if it proved necessary for us to intervene in support of the Company, might be difficult. On the other hand, the Company would clearly require some definite provision that they had liberty to erect such buildings, etc., as were essential for6. their purpose, e.g. refineries, pumping stations, harbours,, pipelines, workshops,, etc. The meeting was inclined to think that the simplest course might be to draw a distinction between ^•constructions of this nature and communications taken in a broad sense - wireless, roads, railways, etc. - and that in discussions with the Company we should aim in the first place at making the Company s rights under the first sub-paragraph of the article subject 'to the agreement of the Sheikh which shall not be unreasonably withheld'. (The Petroleum Department did not wish to support any arrangement which gave the Sheikh the right to interfere with the construction of any works &amp;c. necessary to the operations of the Company, and pointed out that roads, small- gauge railways and telephones were an essential part of any large scale operations.) If this proved impossible to endeavour to make a special exception in respect of communications and wireless, putting them on a different footing from the other matters referred to. It was thought that here, as in the case of Article 2., the importance of walking extremely carefully, having regard to local conditions, might be impressed on the Company. Mr.Warner raised the question whether steps should be taken to secure the participation of the political authorities in dealings between the Company and the Sheikh after the granting of the Concession. Mr.haithwaite , while agreeing as to the desirability in principle of ensuring this, drew attention to the difficulty of requiring or enforcing it so long as we had no resident political representative in Qatar. Article 7. ( a ) it was agreed that the desirability of specifically safeguarding the position of any aerodromes acquired by us in Qatar should be considered in connection with this article, (b) Attention was drawn to the possibility that considerable areas might be in the possession, not of the Sheikh, but (as appeared in the past to have been the case elsewhere on the Arab littoral) of the Jowasimi Arabs. That was, however, a point for the Company.331 7. (c) ine second sub-paragraph was too widely stated and did not sufficiently safeguard private possessors against expropriation at the request of the Company. It was agreed that the Company should be invited either to adopt a wording on the general lines of Article 4 (B)(2) of their Persian concession or to revise the first sentence of the sub-paragraph to run as follows:- ’’Any other lands, houses or buildings required by tne Company may oe bought or leased by it with the consent of and on conditions to be arranged with the proprietors thereof, but —iAPPlP cf such purchase or lease shall not be in excess. . . . H (d) The phrase t? Such land shall at all times be less than the whole area of Qatar’ 1 caused some surprise, but was assumed to have been inserted at the request of the Sheikh. Article 8. It was agreed that the Company should be invited to insert in the second sentence of the first sub- paragraph the words ’’subject to the same proviso”. Article 10. (a) Some discussion took place as to the desirability of fixing a maximum period during which the general customs exemption granted to the Company should run. The general feeling of the meeting was, however, in favour of letting the article stand, particularly now that the Company had to some extent met us by agreeing te pay duty on food supplies, personal goods, cMhing and general merchandise imported by it for the personal use of its employees. (b) The question was raised of the desirability of giving the Company complete exemption in respect of harbour dues. The meeting felt that as any harbours made would be developed by the Company, it would be unreasonable to request them to pay harbour dues. On the other hand it would be worth ensuring that they would agree to the free use of such harbours by the Sheikh. Goods imported by private individuals through such harbours/8 . naruours woula 01 course be liable for any ordinary iiiipox Xj auty charged, out it would be unreasonable to give tne Sheikh the right to charge harbour dues in addition in respect of the importation of such goods. Attention was drawn to the oorrenponience which nad taken place between the Political Resident and Mr. ^1Kington, and also to the fact that under tide 5 oi tne ^atar Treaty oi 1916 the sheikh was piecludea from obtaining arms, save under arrangements therein defined, to oe made and approved by H.M.G. it was agreed tnat tne Resident's view in the matter, as expressed in paragraph 3(1) of his letter dated 24th November to Mr. Elkington, should be accepted. n diidfLAd Assignment . It was recognised that this article raised fundamental questions and that no decision could be taken on it except after reference to higher auunority. On tne other hano. it seemed desirable so far as possible to clear the ground with a view to exploring how far the Company .were in iact prepared to go and what their intentions were In the matter. It had throughout oeen appreciated that as the A.P.O.C. were conducting as agents negotiations in Qatar only/on behalf of the I.P.C., which was itself an international Company containing a British, elemei which represented only about 3R. of the shareholders,it wouldnetba poasib] in practice to insert full British safeguards or provision for full British control in the concession granted. Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty had originally proposed the following five safeguards designed to maintain British c ontrol: - (a) The assignee company to be registered in Great Britain; (b) The Company's office in Great Britain to he run by a British subject; (c)/331 (c) British director; (d) Chief Local Representative to he p ersona gr ata to H.M.G. and a British subject. (e) As many British employees as possible to be employed. Of these, he thought that (a), (b) and (d) should appear in the concession itself, and in view of the necessity for transfer to the I.P.C., he suggested that the other two might be inserted if at any stage the I.P.C. decided to sell the concession to a foreign Company. For this purpose a clause should be inserted forbidding assignment without the consent of the Sheikh, and then only on conditions to be laid down by him. Mr .Starling suggested that we might provide that the Company should be and remain a British Company registered in Great Britain, having its place of business in Great Britain and a British Chairman, on the same lines as the Mr.Laithwaite said that might be possible, but that he thought the ^ India Office would be content (if this was found to be sufficiently x. legally watertight and would ease matters) to cover certain of these points in an exchange of letters with the Companyparticularly the point about the Chief Local Representative. It seemed desirable also to provide that the Sheikh should approve the conditions of transfer. Mr.Seal said that apart altogether from safeguards for British control, the Admiralty were concerned that they should be in a position to acquire or buy the oil produced in time of war, and he was anxious therefore that there should be no reassignment to American interests without provision for pre-emption, as otherwise serious diplomatic difficulties might arise. Mr ..Starling drew attention to the difficulties of entirely safeguarding the position when we were dealing with an international company such as the I.P.C Mr. Seal agreed that it was desirable to make provision that the consent of the Sheikh and approval of the conditions of assignment should be included. Mr.Warner suggested that the simplest course might be to meet the Company in so many words as regards transfer to the I.P.C, if that was the point which they had principally m mind in the first sentence of the article and then make provision to safeguard .our position in the event of any reassignment.346 10 . After considerable further discussion it was agreed that the Company should be invited to agree to a redraft oi 'k-Oo -i-ii. bf hu-pcii o.gi’Q.pli 0 .L tills article on the following lines: 'The Company shall he ana remain a British Company ^ registered in Great Britain, having its principal place of ousiness in Great Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times oe a British subject* subject to these conditions ana to the approval of the Sheikh and on conditions to be laid ciown by him, it shall have the right to transfer this agreement to another commercial company etch' It was also agreed that hr. Warner’s suggestion might be put to the Company• The meeting then considered the second sub -paragraph of Article Is. ivir. Laltnyvaioe said that in seemed most importau that the terms on which the subsidiary commercial companies should be formed should be subject to the prior approval of . The meeting agreed. n • ivi * G • / Mr. Star i ing suggested that (following the example of the British Oil Development Concession) we might insert the words 'under its own control' after the words 'subsidiaf/ commercial companies' and might also provide that any such companies should enjoy the rights and privileges ana assume the engagements of the parent company. It was agreed that this should be put to the A.P.O.C. un a general point nr. La i on waif t? said that i u might be desirable to emphasise to the A.P.O.C. representatives that while we were prepared to regard their draft concession as generally satisfactory (subject to their meeting us over assignment, etc.) they were not to assume that if negotiations between the A.P.O.C. and the Sheikh broke down we were in any way permanently committed to these terms. ]f other competitors came into the fiela the competitive offers put up would have to be considered one against another. The meeting agreed. Article 13Article 15 . It was agreed that the Company should he asked in sub-paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 to insert provision that producing wells or borings should be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working. Article 15 . M r. Lai t nwaite suggested that in the interests of the Sheikh it might be desirable to reword in lines 7 &amp; 8 after th e word H de layed n this&lt;Ao run; 'A period oi sucn ael'ay'j together with such period as may be reasonably necessary in the view of the for the restoration &amp;c. Political hesident&lt;/ **, If would' d f course be open to the Sheikh to go to arbitration on trie point, but something less uicfoorato seemed preferable. The meeting agreed. Article 16 . Mr. Laithwaite said that the India Office on general political grounds regarded it as undesirable that the third arbitrator should be nominated by the Court of International Justice at The Hague. They would much prefer the Political Resident (on whom this responsibility had devolved in the original draft). The meeting agreed that this should be put to the Company. Article 17 . (a) It was pointed out that this gave us no guarantee as uo nationality ox &lt;^ny non—asiatic foreigners who might be introduced.. Secondly, that serious political dilficulties might well arise if the Company were to import, say, Bahreinis or Iraqis, to operate the Qatar concession, on the ground that the wages demanded locally were unreasonably high. It was agreed that the Company should be invited to consider the oniisoion of the words r, or demand unreasonable wages’ 1 •. On the question, of nationality oi non-Asiatic employees, Mr.Fraser had already made it clear tnat uiey could not commit themselves and it seemed difficult, important as the point was, to do more than had been done in Bahrein and endeavour to secure that as large a proportion as possible should be British.12. iv-x o Laithwaite_ s^iQ Cb) / lii is article' raised the difficult Question of jurisdiction, iiio Coiupniiy nud iiicuie iu clQur tiiu.t they were not frepared to accede to the Sheikh's - request that disputes Detween its employees and uis suejsets siioulci 'be decided by him ana it would probably be necessary to reach some agreement with him over the cession to H.IvLG. of his jurisdiction over foreigners, though this was likely to be by no means easy. Mr.. Warner said' that here, as in me case of Articles 2 and 7, it was necessary to in mind the possible responsibility with which we might find ourselves burdened in connection with the protection of / foreign employees etc. in Qatar, and the contingent risk of foreign interference if we proved unable to safeguard their position adequately. Mr. Laithwaits expressed agreement and said that if the concession was developed it seemed likely that we might have to consider some time in the future the appointment of a political officer to Qatar. (Conpare in this connection comment (• ) on Article 6, above). , . , Article 16 .- A similar article appears m the A*. ¥«o * C Persian concession and it. was agreed that while Its meaning was obscure it was unobjectionable. Article 20 . The Political Resident had expressed the opinion that a careful Arabic text might at a pinch representatives suffice.

(b) (i) Article 2, The Company were averse from inserting in the Article a specific safeguard for aerodromes, particularly as we have not yet any regular aerodrome, but expressed their willingness to consider giving us an undertaking that aerodrome or wireless arrangements made by us would not in any way be obstructed, in an exchange of letters, if we would suggest a satisfactory formula.

Petroleum Department, Admiralty India Office. Deputy Chairman, Anglo- Persian Oil Comnany. Anglo-Persian Oil Company Mr. Wakely said that Mr. Fraser and Mr. Hearn, of the A.P.O.C. had, he understood, been good enough to offer to attend a meeting at which they could explain to the interested departments the position and policy of the A.P.O.C. in the Gulf. The Company were of course aware of the general position, which was that the Sheikhs concerned were precluded from granting any oil concessions without the prior concurrence of H.M.G. who had, while paying special attention to the interests of those Rulers to consider applications for concessions from all points of view. A statement from the Company would, he felt, be of much assistance. Mr. Fraser explained in the first place that in Qatar the A.P.O.C. were precluded from acting on their own behalf and could act only as the agents of the Iraq Petroleum Company since Qatar was within the area covered by the I ,P. 0 , Convention. Any concession would, however, if granted by the Sheikh, be in the name of the/■BSE2 . 3&lt;1 the A.P.O.C. They had reason to believe that the Standard Oil Company of California, a purely .American H Company who had already obtained a footing in the Gulf at Bahrein and at Rasa, were also interested in Qatar, The Sheikh of Qatar had entered into an agreement with the A.P.O.C. expiring in August 1934 during the currency of which the A.P.O.C. had the right to apply for concession . giving them sole rights to work oil in Qatar and the Sheikh had undertaken not to consider the grant of an oil concession to anyone other than the A.P.O.C. This would not prevent the Standard Oil Company of California from making suggestions to the Sheikh meanwhile and thus making things difficult for the A.P.O.C. in their negotiations. Those negotiations had proceeded some distance this autumn, and Mr,Chisholm, the A.P.O.C. representative, had returned home to report progress in November. The Sheikh had, however, now suddenly and quite spontaneously intimated that he wished to see the A.P.O.C. representative by the 14th of this month for the purpose of further discussion and Mr.Chisholm v/as already on his way out to Qatar by air with a revised draft concession. The Political Resident would, of course, be consulted regarding the terms of the concession but the A.P.O.C. v/ere anxious if possible to avoid the delay which would result if the Political Resident had to refer home for instructions on every point which might arise during the negotiations, Mr.Fraser suggested that a great deal of time might be saved if H.M.G, would consent to give their blessing in advance uo the general terms oi the revised concession subject to any reasonable modifications which they might desire to make, end which could be the subject of informal discussion hQT ^ mFTaQQT3. 3(?0 j'i.- 1 :-*, uiien circulated copies ol tlie Willcn T,tr. Chisholm was trailing out to Qatar• draft concession Mr. Wakely suggested that the draft could best be considered departmentally in the fii st instance ? and this was agreed, Mr. Eraser, however, emphasising the anxiety of the Company that it should be dealt. with as expeditiously as possible. Eraser then turned to the activities of the A.P.O.C. in howeit• Here the position was different since Koweit was outside the area covered by the I.P.C. Convention* Por some time past the A.P.O.C, and the American Gulf Oil Company had both been negotiating for a concession in Koweit, but hitherto the A.P.O.C. had been unable to reach any agreement with the Sheikh. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were most anxious that there should not be a rival foreign oil concern in Koweit on the flank of their own operations in Persia and this was why they had themselves wanted to obtain a concession in Koweit. They had all along felt themselves at a great disadvantage in negotiating at Koweit in competition with the Guli Oil Company, a very wealthy concern, owing to the danger that by granting too favourable terms to Koweit they might involve themselves in difficulties with the Persian Government who might also accuse them of frittering away their energies outside Persia. They had therefore considered it desirable to endeavour to make an arrangement with the Gulf Oil Company. An arrangement o-l a nature which fully safeguarded the interests ox the A.P.O.C., bo work jointly with them for a concession through a new oompany to be formed on a 50/50 basis, had been signed, and now only a?/aited ratification, a decision as to which was expected this week. The negotiations with the Sheikh if the agreement in question \yas ratified would be carried on by Mr. Gass, acting on behalf oj- the A.P.O.C., and assisted by Major Holmes, on behalf of the Gdj.i3&amp;( 4. Oil Company, Hg pointed out 'fchai iiie Gulf Oil Company was one of the parties interested in the I.P.C. through the ^ American portion of the shares of the latter* while the Standard Oil Company of California was not. On this point ih. rlaser explained that the A.P.O.C. felt that they had a legitimate griewance against the behaviour of American oil interests in this area since the war. When, after the War* tne Americans ana the french were admitted to participation in the I.P.C, the A.P.O.C, had understood that the American oil interests would then be satisfied with their share in the I.P.C. This* hoY/ever* had. not been so, since the Standard Oil Company of California had later appeared and obtained oil concessions in Bahrein and Hasa; they now threatened to come in also at Qatar. The Standard Oil Company of California (now established in Bahrein and Hasa) was an entirely different Company from the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (interested in the Iraq Petroleum Company) but there were occasions Y/hen these large American groups appeared to worh in sympathy with one another, Mr. Fraser suggested that the position would be very much simplified and delay avoided if the same procedure could be followed here as he had suggested in Qatar* i .e. if H.M.G.. would be good enough to examine the draft concession at this end and make suggestions beiore it was presented to the Sheikh. He sincerely trusted that the Company could look for the support ox His Majesty^ Government, Mr, Fraser then offered to give further exp 1anations/z&amp;z 5. explanations on any points in connection with either Q,atar or Koweit wnich the meeting might wish to raise. said that subject to the opinion of the meeting he thought there might be advantage in informal discussion such as the Company had suggested of the terms of draft concessions. This procedure had been adopted with advcm oage in the case of ?Bahrein. But it was important not to snort-circuit the authorities in the Gulf# Mr, Walton and Mr. haithwaite said that H.M.G. and the Resident both felt that they had been kept rather in the dark regarding the details and the course of the A.P.0.C.negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar. In particular they had no clear idea of the financial terms which were being offered to the Sheikh for the concession. Mr. Fraser said that it was difficult to arrange the financial terms at this end and thought that this side of the matter could best be settled in the negotiations between their representative and the Sheikh of Qatar. He could assure the meeting, however that the financial terms were likely to be not ungenerous to the Sheikh. They might indeed have to be rather too generous from the A.P.O.C .point of view, since the Standard Oil Company of California had paid a very large sum for their concession in Hasa and this could not be without effect on their own negotiations. Mr. Starling said that the Petroleum Department would favour the adoption of Mr. Fraser’s suggestion for informal preliminary discussion in London of points arising out of the draft Qatar concession but that if they were to give their opinion about any co-ncession whether in Qatar or Koweit they would of course have to have some idea of the financial terms since, in some cases it was impossible to form an opinion whether the terms of a concession were fair without having this information. Mr. Hearn ( A.P.O .C.)reminded the meeting that Ramazan started/6. started on the 17th December. The A.P.C.G. 3 63 representative was due to arrive in Qatar on the 14th so that it the Sheikh really intended to make progress ,/v 'i ux negotiations for a concession there would he very little time to spare* ithwalte said that it was relevant that the Company’s application for a concession in ^atar raised certain political issues which could not he disposed of without consultation with India and the Resident, which would take time, e.g. the issue of jurisdiction, which with the Company the Sheikh had already raised/ and the bringing into force of certain dormant articles of the sheikh*s Treaty. mr« Praser said the Company had no intention of agreeing to tne exercise of jurisdiction hy she Shaikh over their employees. hr. derm el suggested that on this point it might help the A.P.O.C. in their negotiations in Qatar vis : -a-vis the standard Oil , Company of California or any other competitor if His to Majesty’s Government were now/point out to the sheikh that certain conditions as regards jurisdiction over employees would apply in the case of any concession which he might grant. Mr. Hearn said that the A.P.0.0, understood that the Sneikh had lately asked the political Resident about the procedure to be followed if a second Company came along in search of a concession, which seemed to imply that there was a real danger of the standard oil Company of California coming in at Qatar. . Mm Walton referred to Article 12 of the draft concession circulated by Mr. Fraser which provided for the transfer of the concession from the A.P.O.C. to another party and asked what tne position was as regards assignment and what the Company had in mind. Mr.Fraser explained that this provision had been inserted because any/any concession would have to he handed over to the i•P♦d* f (in which British interests were represented hy the a*P. 0*C* and hy the British element in the Shell group). If a subsidiary company were then formed the A.P.O.C* would claim and would have a percentage of interest in it not less than the percentage (23$) of their interest in the Iraq petroleum Company. Such a company might, indeed, contain a larger British element than the I.P.C. if , for example, the French interests represented in the latter aid not wish to share in the new operations at Qatar. The A.P.O.C. of course wanted any new company to he as British as possible and he reminded the meeting that the alternative, that is the standard Oil Company of California, was a purely American Company. He mentioned that nobody knew how the standard oil Company of California intended to market the oil which it obtained from Bahrein or Hasa, since the various Standard groups had never yet been known to compote with one another in marketing “The petroleum Dopartment state that there are several standard Groups/ Mr* Laithwaite asked wnether, 11 tne Qatar concession were handed over to the Iraq petroleum Company the exploitation of the concession would still be British. we attached much importance, both on general grounds and because of the difficult question of jurisdiction that might arise, to keeping exploitation here (and in Koweit) wholly in British hands* Mr. Fraser *said that the personnel of the I.P.C* in Iraq was mostly British, since this had been found convenient by all parties concerned, though in theory the other participants in tne I.r.C* could insist/365- 8 . insist on personnel in proportion to their share interest in the Company. He mentioned that over 52% of the material for the Iraq Petroleum Company pipe line had been ordered from the United Kingdom. He suggested that there was in practice no need for apprehension on the point. It would be better to avoid making specific provision in the concession, since that might lead other nationalities represented in the I.P.C. to claim the percentage to which their holdings entitled them. Turning to Koweit, Mr.Wakelv said he understood that the A.P.O.C. and the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate had first of all been negotiating against one another for a concession and that the latter had resigned their interests to the Gulf-Company. The position now was apparently that the A.P.O.C. had entered into an agreement which was signed and merely awaited ratification to obtain and work a concession jointly with the Gulf Oil Company on a 50/50 basis which would extend to exploitation as well as to distribution, Mr. Fraser, said this was the case and that his Chairman, Sir John Cadman, had particularly asked him to emphasise at the meeting in case any criticism was raised that this 50/50 arrangement with the Gulf Company had specially received the blessing of H.M.G., before the Company had entered into it. Mr. Wakely said that the India Office had no knowledge of any such approval having been given. Mr t Rend,el. said he understood that the A.P.O.C. had had discussions with certain members of the Foreign Office but that the Foreign Office had understood that the 50/50 arrangement was to cover distribution of the oil only and not exploitation. Mr.Fraser reiterated that the idea/m; id.0ol Ol cl 50/50 *3 y*T , c; &gt;n rr pvv-jpy-, 4- 4- _ i &gt; , x a,x xaxit.euient to extend to SX.plO itcltion Il8,n hppn rn-xpr.-r ,-. n 1 , ^au jtieh ppeoLUui-Ljiy approved b’ H.M.G. He would if ^oppqQ 0 T&gt;v ^rr.^ + 0 . ,, --^ubbary &gt;/vrite a letter giving further details if desired. The arrangement -.■ioh tau ^uii oil Company had been forced upon tae a.jt'.u.C. because it was embarrassing for them to offer large sums of money in Koweit (where perhaps tnere was no oil) in view ox possible reactions on the Persian Government. Moreover they understood that the sheikh himself wished for an international Company.

Oxiers uo tne Sheikh and hau in their possession full copies of the correspondence that had passed, while the a.p.o.c. ^ r^CaiVoa no similar information about the offers made oy the Gulf oil Company. In answer to a question from Mr. W&amp;kely, f ir.Fraser said that if they succeeded In reaching an agreement vith trm Gulf Oil Company the latter might easily alio personnel at Ko we it to oe even 100% British, but that it would not be politic for the A.P.0.0, to suggest any arrangement about personnel to the Gulf company at this stage, since it would only lead to a counter claim on their part. .Hie A.P.O.C. (as in the Cc^se of autar) thought it oest to have no provision out personnel in their agreement with the Gulf Company• With regard to the employment of Major Holmes, c/ao, ue understood, was not entirely persona drata to H.M.G., Mr^Fraser assured the meeting that their own representative, Mr. Gass, would take the chief part in the/367 10. the negotiations with the Sheikh ana that Major Holmes, vvnu would he nseiul on accounu oi his local Knowledge ana influence with the Sheikh, woula merely assist. He would, he well looked after hy the A.P.O.C, representative and in any case the alternative to Major Holmes would he an American. M r. haithwaite said that it would he necessary to consider this Quest ion separately. It would, he thought, he desirable that all negotiations at Koweit should he conducted solely through the Political Agent. This procedure had now been laid down in Bahrein in the negotiations between the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the one hand and the sheikh of Bahrein on the other. Mr. Fraser said that he hoped this procedure ’would not he insisted upon in Qatar and Koweit. Indeed he thought that under these conditions the Sheikh of Koweit would refuse to negotiate for a concession at all. The A«P*0.0. would of course gladly keep the political authorities fully in touch wion what was &amp;oing on. xva . no,.x.uiiv^ciito said that there was no political Agent at Qatar and that so long as this was the case there could he no objection to direct negotiations between the A.P.O.C. .and the She i kh, hut he re mi nded Mr.- Fraser th at th is would also apply to any competitor who appe&amp;rod in Qatar, and that we could not discriminate in favour ox the a. P. 0 * G. In Ko we it, vvhei e tnex a was a Polioical .agt/ii t, the position was different and he did not see that American interests could object so lon^ a,a we did not discriminate against them. Direct negotiations might lead to serious difficulty on certain points. He reminded Mr. Fraser that the Sheikh was not able to11 . grant a concession without the consent ol H.M.G. ?raser said that hitherto the Americans and the Sheikh had been allowed to negotiate direct and that if that policy were now changed it would have an cXmemely oad effect both on the Gulf oil Company and on tne Sheikh, hr. '.Vakely said that H.M.G. could not corrmit themselves on this point and that the Departments concerned would have to consider the matter. Mr. wnlton asked whether, when the arrangements with the Gulf Oil Company had been completed, the A,x *L/.C* would, inlorm :l,M»G. of tno posioioxi. —said that if Mr* Walton meant that the A.P.O.C. should show H.M.G. a copy of their agreement /vitn the Gulf Oi-± Company the A.P.O.C. would have no ohjection hut he thought that this might he embarrassing for H.M;G., who, as Mr. Wahely had oAplalned, had to consider the interests of the Sheikhs. In making their agreement with the Gulf oil Company the A.P.O.C. had had in mind the protection of their own interests (in which they had, he thought, been very successful) ana not those of the Sheikh of no wo it and it might embarrass HMvhG. in advising the Sheikh if they had previously seen the agreement reached between the A.P.'O.C. ana the Gulf oil Company. From our standpoint it would no doubt be satisfactory if the Sheikh received a substantial yearly sum, irrespective of whether the concession was actively operated or not. Any draft oil concession would, of course, be shown at once to H.M.G. In conclusion Mr.-Fraser again emphasised the anxiety/anxiety of the A.P.O.C. that nothing should, if possiDle, oe allowed to delay their negotiations at Qatar, and asked whether the Departments concerned uoulu give an opinion about the revised A.P.O.C. uiait concession as soon as possible. He hoped that H. ivi • u-., subject to any r e a so na hie ame n dmen. ts idiat might oe agreed here, would feel able to instruct the Resident to regard it with a favourable eye. MO....Wakely. said that certain major points had been raised which would, nave to oe carefully gone into; out this would be done as expeditiously as possible, livery effort would also be made to examine the revised draft qatar concession without delay, ihc; amendments desired by the Departments concerned could then be discussed* with Mr. Fraser by the petroleum Department and India Office. He wished go repeat that it was the concern ox H.M.G. to safe guard the interests of the Sheikhs; but that subject to tiiis and to consideration of their own special Interests and obligations in the Gulf they were naturally anxious to give any assistance properly possible to British concerns. Mr. Fraser expressed uhe hope that ail possible assistance would be given to the A.P.O.C., and added that he was anxious that the discussion which had taken place should be treated as strictly confidential. This was agreed. It was also agreed that the Company should cable Mr.Chisholm to give a copy of the revised Qatar concession to the Political Agent, Bahrein on his arrival there, and to arrange that a copy should go by mail to the Political Resident.

Protection . Mr. Elkington has informed the political Resident that the Sheikh has requested 'If he has not sufficient arms for guards required by us, f whether we can supply trie necessary rifles and ammunition. Could you inform me if we are tied in any way in dealing with such a request?' The Resident has replied that under the draft the responsibility of protection is on the dheikh 'and 1 think it would be undesirable for the Company to supply any arms or ammunition to the sheikh. The latter coula always purchase arms from India or elsewhere under a 'no objection' statement from me.' We may agree with the Resident. ARTICLE 12 . Reassignment . Tnis raises a major question for consideration. As the Company will operate on behalf of the -fraq petroleum Company, which is not under British control, we can hardly press for a British nationality oltiuse. But a decision on the point must await interdepartmental discussion in consultation with the political Resident and the Government of India. Re cond sub-paraKrath . The agreement to provide that the terms on wnlch special subsidiary companies shall be formed shall be subject to the prior approval of HJVi.G.y 5. and the Sheikh. We haa better ascertain in the same connection what arrangements the Company propose for representation in Qatar. Their concession is to run for 75 years and it may well prove necessary to consider establishing a British Political iigent jjq this area in tne j-U.ou.re. Particularly having regard to the international character of the I.P.C. it might he well to provide that once the concession has been granted (if the Company are allowed up to then to deal direct with the Sheikh) they shall thereafter, if and when a British political representative is appointed in u,atar, deal with the Sheikh only through him and that their Chief Hepresentative in Qatar shall at all times be a British subject, persona grata to H.M.G. ARTICLE 15 . This has been substantially modified to the interest of the Sheikh. i ARTICLE 14 . No observations.

The British Government was keen that the concession should be obtained by a British company.The papers cover: discussion and drafts of the commercial agreement between APOC and the Shaikh of Qatar [‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī]; drafts of the political agreement between HM Government and APOC; minutes of meetings at the India Office between British Government officials and representatives of APOC; the attitude of the Shaikh of Qatar; the risk of the Shaikh granting the concession to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (folio 293); the need to keep exploitation of oil in Qatar in British hands, in order to ensure greater political control and avoid international complications arising from the safety of foreign nationals (folio 265); the particular difficulties involved in developing an oil industry in Qatar (e.g. folio 262); the question of the development of air facilities in Qatar, including correspondence from the Air Ministry (e.g. folios 236-237); the involvement of the Admiralty in the discussions (e.g. folios 209-210); the modelling of the Qatar oil concession on that of Koweit [Kuwait] (e.g. folios 194-197); the possibility of constructing an oil refinery in Qatar (e.g. folio 104); the potential effect on APOC of customs and import dues in Qatar (e.g. folios 68-69); British political representation in Qatar (folios 59-60); the southern limit of the proposed Qatar oil concession; and the potential for disputes with Ibn Saud [Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd], arising from the definition of Qatar's boundary with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (e.g. folios 20-21).The main correspondents are senior officials at the India Office (especially John Gilbert Laithwaite), and representatives of APOC.The Arabic language content of the papers consists of two place names on a map entitled 'Sketch Map of Qatar Peninsula' on folio 14.The file also contains a small number of papers dated 1914-16.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
