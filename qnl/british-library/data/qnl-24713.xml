[43944] Sfxtion 1 . Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 7.) (No. 779.) Sir, Pera, November 3, 1911. WITH reference to my telegram No. 206 of the 17th September in which I expressed the opinion that it would be wiser not to take any action with the idea of inducing the Turkish Government to discontinue their obstruction to the fulfilment by Messrs. Lynch of their contract with Sir J. Jackson (Limited) for the transport of material to the site of the Hindieh barrage, and to your desp itch No. 280 of the 17th October, I have the honour to report that as Sir J. Jackson’s agent here has earnestly requested me not to take any steps for the present, I have agreed to do so pending further instructions from yourself. Mr. Eady has informed me that he lias been told by the Minister of Public Works repeatedly and in the plainest language that, if the goad relations which Jackson’s have hitherto enjoyed with the Turkish Government are to continue, the contract with Lynch must be cancelled, and Mr. Eaiy being convinced that to obtain the consent of the Turks to the contract on any conditions whatever will very seriously jeopardise the good prospects of his firm in Mesopotamia, has urged his principals in London to annul the contract even if it entails considerable loss. Sir J. Jackson’s, however, influenced by the representations of Mr. Lynch, have somewhat reluctantly, it would seem, declined to follow Mr. Eady’s advice and have instructed him to lay before the Turkish Government a letter from the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company giving an undertaking that the vessels to be employed under the contract will not be used for any other purpose, &amp;c., an undertaking which they have been induced by Mr. Lynch to believe will bring the Turkish Government to waive their objections. This Mr, Eady is now about to do, very much against his own judgment, as he believes that his firm have been led by Mr. Lynch to form an incorrect opinion of the situation here, and I am constrained to say that an examination of the statements made by Mr. Lynch both to your department and to Sir J. Jackson (Limited) in London, as reported by them to Mr. Eady, brings me to a similar conclusion. A statement of this nature is a serious j one, and I therefore think it incumbent on me to give one or two instances of loose statements in Mr. Lynch’s account of the position which appear to me calculated to mislead. 1 . In his letter to you of the 2 , 7 th September Mr. Lynch stated that the Idareh Nahrieh declined to undertake transport at all, i.e., either by the Euphrates or by the Tigris. This appears to me to be incorrect, for the Turkish Company’s refusal referred to the Euphrates only (Sir J. Jackson to the Vali of Bagdad, 3 rd May, 1911), and they appear indeed never to have been invited to undertake the transport by the two rivers alternatively. 2 . In his letter to you of the 13th September Mr. Lynch says that the Turkish Government raise no objection to the contract, a statement which a month later (Jackson’s to Mr. Eady of the 13th October) is “expanded” into an agreement by the Turks to the contract. Now a comparison of date* shows that the Turkish authorities had no reasonable opportunity to raise objections, for on the 9 th May the Vali of Bagdad was informed by Jackson’s representatives in Bagdad that satisfactory arrangements were being made in London for chartering vessels, no names being given, and on the 11 th May, only two days later, the arrangement between Jackson’s and Lynch was practically concluded. 3. In an account, dated the 20 th October, of a conversation with Mr. Lynch, Sir J. Jackson (Limited), informed Mr. Eady, that “ Mr. Lynch said that he had heard from the Foreign Office that when the Turkish authorities were made aware of the fact that craft would not be used for any other purpose excepting for transporting the plant and material for the use of the Mesopotamian work up the river, that [sic] they would have no further ideas of wishing to cancel the arrangements with Lynch.” I find it difficult to believe that anything can have been said to Mr. Lynch at the Foreign Office which would warrant him in making the above statement, which is so directly at variance with my own opinion of the Turkish Government’s attitude and feeling towards [^266 &lt; 7 - 1 ]f USA' ' the Lynch Company, and I, therefore, feel confident that Mr. Lynch _ has been “expanding” a “could have” or “should have no objection” into a “ will have no objection.” Other circumstances tend to show that Sir J. Jackson (Limited), in London, are conscious that they are being “rushed” by Mr. Lynch. Your first instructions to me on this question (Foreign Office telegram No. 337 of the 14th September) were sent at Mr. Lynch’s request and without the knowledge or consent of Sir J. Jackson (Limited), who were annoyed that their sub-contractor should have approached you on his own authority and, writing to Mr. Eady on the subject on the 28th September, they say, “ it is a little annoying, but, we think, Mr. Lynch now understands that anything of this description (i.e., applying for official action by the embassy) that is done must be done through us. Moreover, Colonel Picot’s letters to Mr. Maxwell of the 8 th and 10 th October, tend to show that Mr. Lynch had doubts as to Sir. J. Jackson (Limited), agreeing to the letter of the 27 th September to your department. Taking all these circumstances into consideration, although Sir J. Jackson (Limited), have been inveigled, by the somewhat inaccurate representations employed by Mr. Lynch, into agreeing to endeavour to persuade the Turkish Government to allow the contract to stand, they have considerable misgivings as to the wisdom of that course from which they have been and are still being strongly dissuaded by their local representative who must be in a better position than his principals in London to judge of the effect which it may have on their relations with the Ottoman Government in future, and I have, therefore, thought it more prudent and more fair to Sir J. Jackson, whose interests must take precedence of those of his sub-contractor in this matter, to suspend action until we know the result of Mr. Eady’s last recommendations to his firm, who will then, no doubt, inform you of their wishes. In my own opinion, Mr. Eady takes a just view of the situation, viz., that the hitherto friendly attitude of the Turkish Government to Sir J. Jackson (Limited), is likely to undergo a complete change if the Lynch contract is forced on their acceptance. (Very confidential.) To speak quite frankly, the very name of Lynch is offensive to t he T urks, partly, no doubt, for political reasons connected with the flying of the British flag and because of his successful competition with the Idareh Nahrieh, but still more because they think that the business of the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company is not conducted in the straightforward manner that all over the east is expected from an English house, and are inclined to suspect him of having ulterior motives in the present case. To show that I am not alone in this view, 1 may mention very confidentially that Mr. Whittalfs reasons for resigning the Lynch agency were mainly that he recognised that to be identified with the Lynch Company must compromise his other interests in Turkey. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.MiiipniMnvi [ This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] (Confidential.) IN view of the fact that the Germans are now making all their arrangements for the dispatch of a very large quantity of railway material for the Bagdad Railway early next year by way of the Tigris route to Bagdad, it is of immense importance that we should not lose the Jackson contract for the carriage of material up the Euphrates. The Bagdad Railway concession gives the Germans the right to put steamers on the Euphrates as well as on the Shat-el-Arab and on the Tigris. If the Turks succeed in cancelling our agreement with Sir John Jackson Company (Limited), nothing is more certain than that the Germans will make a hid for the carriage of the Jackson material in conjunction with the carriage of their own Bagdad Railway material. In that case Sir John Jackson Company (Limited) will probably find in the course of time that they too will be supplanted by German engineering enterprise. The Germans will be unable to resist the temptation of profiting by what they will regard as indifference on the part of our Foreign Office. The Germans are at present engaged in carefully thinking out the best way of transporting their railway material to Bagdad, and have been for some time past in negotiations with our Bagdad agents in connection with this matter. The suggestion is that we should carry the material up for them under the powers which they possess according to the terms of the Bagdad Railway concession. They realise that this course would be far the cheapest for them, but they are being pressed by German local enterprise to profit by the hostility displayed towards British enterprise in Mesopotamia by the Turkish Government in order to put steamers on themselves. In that case we have gathered that the German idea would be to constitute a river company for the purpose of conveying material, and that their hope would be to get these powers extended to the conveyance of general merchandise, which would of course decrease the cost which would have to be borne by the Bagdad Railway material, as the steamers conveying such material would be able to engage downward freights. At present those responsible for the Bagdad Railway affair have come to no definite decision in the matter. If they find that we are well supported by His Majesty’s Government in the matter of the Jackson contract, they will probably decide to go on with their negotiations with our Bagdad agents for the carriage of their railway material. In the contrary event, they are likely to yield to German local representations. I may add that I recently made it my business to enquire whether it is at all likely I that the rivers of Mesopotamia will be rendered (innavigable by irrigation works. I find that there is no present prospect of this, and I would therefore urge that the maintenance of the British position on the rivers should be one of the principal considerations governing British policy in these countries. As matters now stand, we propose to instruct our agents in Bussorah to resume the carriage of Sir John Jackson’s material in our steamers directly the rains have provided a sufficient volume of water in the Euphrates, which is likely to occur early in November. We should instruct them not to yield to any verbal representations on the part of the Vali of Bussorah, but only to yield to written orders to desist. Should any interference of this contract take place, we will at once inform the Foreign ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [October 27.] CONFIDENTIAL. [42585] No. 1.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, ielati\ e to the transport ol material to the Hindieh barrage. The powers held by Sn John Jackson (Limited) enable him to organise a special service of steamers for the purpose of the transport of his material, provided that the Turkish Steamship Administration decline to undertake the transport. There is nothing in the contract restricting Sir John Jackson (Limited) to the use of the Euphrates only, and our contract with Sir John Jackson (Limited) provides for the transport, in case of need, of the material up the Tigris via Bagdad to the barrage at an increased cost. Before entenng into the contract with us Sir John Jackson (Limited) satisfied themselves that the Turkish Steamship Administration declined to undertake the work at all. The cost of conveying material up the Tigris and hauling it overland to the ban age on the Euphrates is so great that it was never contemplated that the Tigris route should he used except in case of emergency. Moreover, the Turkish Steamship Administration have at present a large quantity or ordinary merchandise detained at Bussorah in transit for Bagdad owing to want of space. The obstacles which the new Vah of Bagdad is placing in the way of our fulfilment of our contract would seem to be in pa it dictated by the fear least, after the contract had been completed, we should refuse to take the special steamers off the river. This of course is not the case. We should be prepared, if necessary, to enter into a formal arrangement to remove the special steamers directly the contract had been completed. Meanwhile we would claim the protection of His Majesty's Government in having the contract upheld. I would remind you that, as stated in my last letter, we have, on the faith of the contract ordered special vessels in this country for its prompt execution. Some of these have already been shipped and the remainder are approaching completion. I must add that the River Euphrates may be expected to rise very shortly—directly the rains fall. We may therefore at any moment be enabled to send up the two special steamers which we have devoted to this work, and which had already conducted operations on the Euphrates before the river fell.

(Referring to your telegram No. 337 of the 14th instant.) In the event of Turkish Steam-ship Administration refusing to undertake transport of material, Jackson is empowered by his contract to arrange for transport as he pleases. The Turkish administration declined to undertake transport via Euphrates, and the contract for transport by that river was made subsequently with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. It seems likely that transport will now be effected via Tigris and Bagdad, as lack of water in the Euphrates has rendered navigation of that river impracticable. An offer had been made by Turkish company to transport material by this route, and this would seem to give them right to first refusal for any contract for transport in this manner. Messrs. Lynch’s object, according to Messrs. Jackson’s agent here, is to make use of the latter firm, and Messrs. Jackson’s agent is therefore opposed to his firm becoming an instrument in the hands of Lynch and so compromising themselves with the Turkish Government. He has sent telegrams to Bagdad and to London asking for full details. Until further information can be obtained respecting points noted in preceding paragraph, I think it best to suspend action.

WITH reference to my despatch No&gt;551, Confidential, of the 2nd instant, I have the honour to report that M. Bompard yesterday again referred to my observation that a French firm had entered into competition with Messrs. Jackson and Messrs. Pearson as regards Mesopotamian irrigation schemes, and his Excellency said that enquiries which he had made had convinced him that all that the “Societe des Batignolles ” had done was to ask at the Ministry of Finance for the “ cahier des charges ” and make some observations on it. It may be quite true that the French Embassy has not given the French company any support, but the letter addressed by the latter to the Ministry of Public Works, copy of which is enclosed herewith, indicates very clearly that it went further than M. Bompard states. M. Cugnin, the person named in the letter, was in the employ of the Civil List in 1906, and was engaged in works round about Hilleh, on the Euphrates. In 1907 he was taken on by the Ministry of Public Works, and was employed in drawing up plans and a scheme for the new Hindieh barrage. His plans were accepted, and the work was estimated to cost about 180,000h Tenders were asked for, and Messrs. Pearson were induced to look into the matter, and sent an engineer out. On the engagement of Sir W. Willcocks these plans were set aside, but M. Cugnin was employed by Sir W. TV illcocks, and was put in charge of the repairs to the Hindieh barrage. After the repairs had been made, a portion of the older structure of the barrage gave way, and it was said at the time that the accident was due to Sir W. Willcocks’s instructions not being carried out. M. Cugnin has probably entered the service of the company with a view to getting his original scheme, which was set aside by Sir W. Willcocks, adopted by the Turkish Government. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. | * Enclosure in No. 1 . “ Societe des Batignolles ” to Ottoman Minister of Public Works.

Therapia, July 9, 1911. 11 ’ IN reply to your telegram No. 263 of the 8 th instant, I have the honour to report that no other firms besides those of Messrs. Pearson and Sons and Sir John Jackson and Co. have submitted tenders for the Hindieh Barrage, and in these circum stances it appears unnecessary for me to take any action with a view to securing the business for either of them. j One of the conditions of the contract is that the contractor shall take over the work already executed, the price thereof to be included in the total of the tender. I am informed that Messrs. Pearson and Co. have inserted a stipulation m their tender that they will not consent to a price higher than 110 , 000 Z. for such works, in spite of the well-known fact that a much larger sum than this has been expended on them. The difference between their tender (£ T. 1,147,624) and that of Sir John Jackson (£ T. 1,159,142) is only £ T. 11,518, or about 1 per cent., and it seems likely, in the circumstances, that the adjudication will be in favour of the latter firm. 1 note also that, by the financial law of this year, the terms of the contract must be approved by Parliament. This will involve a considerable delay—in fact, it is unlikely that the future contractor could take over the works before the end of the year, and during this period the provisional expenses will be accumulating, and the price of the work already executed correspondingly increased. The result of the adjudication should, according to the official announcement asking for tenders, be made known in a few days, but it is probable that there will be a certain amount of negotiation before a definite agreement is reached.

I have the honour to forward for information a copy of a suggestive note on “ The Port of Basrah ” which Sir William Willcocks has lately written, and which will form an Appendix to a general report on irrigation projects in Mesopotamia that he is about to lay before the Turkish Government. Appendix S. The Port of Basrah. Steamers drawing over 5*5 metres of water cannot enter the Shatt-ul-’Arab and ascend to Basrah owing to the Basrah bar. Now if a channel were dredged across the bar on the alignment taken by the steamers, which is nature’s natural outlet for the waters of the rivers, it should not be a costly matter to keep it clear. I base this statement on the fact, noted in paragraphs 16 and 18 of the Beport, that the only deposit in the water is that brought down by the Karun river, for 24‘25ths of the sediment carried by the Tigris, Euphrates and Karkha is left behind in the marshes. No special study has been made of the subject of dredging across the bar, but from conversations with Captains of the British India Company and examinations of the charts and information in their possession I estimate that the quantity of soft mud to be removed in order to obtain a channel 130 metres wide and 10 metres deep would be 15,000,000 cubic metres on a length of 32 kilometres. In order to obtain a channel 130 metres wide and 8 metres deep we should have to dredge 7 , 000,000 cubic metres of soft mud on a length of 24 kilometres. These quantities seem very small for so important a work, and would justify the Government in undertaking a serious examination of the question. I cannot leave the question of the port of Basrah without mentioning the fact that a channel 32 kilometres long and l'o metres deep, along the ancient course of the joint waters of the Euphrates and Tigris, would put the Euphrates in communication with the western head of the Khor Abdullah, and if a port were needed on this Khor, sweet water would be available far in excess of anything Port Said possesses. Similarly, by digging a channel 10 kilometres long through the desert south of the Khor Abduliah-Bubian bifurcation, Euphrates water could be sent down the Bubian channel where it travelled thousands of years ago.

It seems to me that the value of a Mesopotamian railway is and must be local, and that such a railway can never be come a section of an important world-route. The German scheme, in my humble estimation, was based on a different and fundamentally wrong notion. J. G. L. * / No. W- Not sent to Foreign Office. Sent in duplicate. Sent to Government of India. Your Excellency, Q,„ With reference to my despatch No. 229-9 of the 20 th March 1911, forwarding c i a rough estimate by the Indian Railway Board (upon certain data supplied to them) of the possible earnings of a Baghdad-Basrah railway, I have the honour now to enclose copies of some papers with which Sir William Willcocks has favoured me, relating to railway construction in Mesopotamia. The first paper (Enclosure A) is the draft of an appendix which will accom pany a general report that Sir William is about to submit to the Turkish Govern ment on the subject of irrigation works in Mesopotamia. It shows, by means of cogent instances drawn from India, how desirable it is that irrigation development and railway construction should go hand in hand in this country ; and it concludes with the best forecast that Sir William has been able to form—necessarily a very rough one—of the amount of traffic in agricultural produce with which a Baghdad- Basrah Railway might be expected, ultimately, to have to deal. The second paper (Enclosure B) is a map illustrating the possible interdepend ence and mutual subservience of railways and irrigation work in Mesopotamia, supposing the latter to be executed in accordance with projects which Sir William is now recommending to the Porte for adoption. I would respectfully suggest that if the map is reproduced, copies of it should be sent to the Government of India, to whom a copy of my present despatch is being sent, as well as to this Resi dency. The third paper (Enclosure C) is meant to elucidate the second, by indicating “ to what extent the cost of railway construction is unavoidably enhanced if the irrigation and railway requirements are kept separate. ” I have understood from Sir William Willcocks and some of his engineers, in conversation, that a great (possibly the greater) part of the country through which a Baghdad-Basrah Railway would pass lies below the flood level of the Iigns and Euphrates * that the line must, therefore, run, to a great extent, along embankments; and that the most economical and only proper way of arranging this would be to make the banks of the main canals carry the railway line. It, therefore, seems that a suitable scheme for the general development of the country can only be arrived at as the result of consultation and collaboration between the bodies charged with canal and railway c instruction respectively. A railway of some sort connect ing Baghdad and Basrah could, no doubt, be constructed without reference to the canals; but such a railway would either be absurdly * aligned, leaving the popu lous and cultivated parts of the country on one side of it, or it would be unnecessarily expensive from its having to contend, un assisted, with such difficulties .arising from low levels, floods, and irrigation require ments as it might encounter. C63FDIf, by sny means, the experience of the Government of India’s engineers in dea mg with kindred problems could be drawn upon, the result would obviously be much to the advantage of the Turkish Government. The case seems to be one m which independent action by the canal and railway departments might lead to inextricable engineering confusion and great financial waste. 8 I have the honour to be, with the utmost respect, Your Excellency’s Most obedient humble servant, J. G. LORIMEK, Political Resident in Turkish Arabig, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad. His Excellency the Right Honourable Sir Gerard Lowther, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, ; Constantinople.i 3 *) ENCLOSURE A. Appendix R. “ It became evident, early in the history of the Chenab Canal, that a rail- “ way for transport of produce was very urgently required. The re- “ quisition for this railway came from the railway department unex pectedly, it had not been contemplated in the programme of the time being, and some delay occurred before funds could be made avail able. It is scarcely too much to say that the success of the coloniza- “ tion scheme was seriously threatened by the difficulty the settlers “ experienced in conveying their enormous produce to the market. ' This need has now been so fully recognized that in the case of the “ newly opened Jhelum Canal, a similar railway down the centre of the “ Jech Doab is being constructed and a considerable portion of it will “ probably be open for traffic by the time an urgent need for it arrives.” This is a quotation from the completion report of the Chenab Canal in North ern India, a canal traversing lands similar to those of Mesopotamia in their climate and in the condition in which they found themselves before the canal works were carried out. Here is a description of the country from the original report: “ The “ country was one of extreme desolation ; the rainfall w r as only 5 inches per annum “ and one might travel for miles without seeing a living thing The “ distinctive feature of the landscape was the camel thorn. The only inhabitants “ of the country were the indigenous tribes known as the Janglis and their herds. “ The Janglis w'ere a people of pastoral and nomadic habits, ekeing out a precarious “ existence by means of their camels and cattle.” In such a land, so like great part of Mesopotamia, canals have introduced in a few years nearly a million of inhabitants, and the resurrection of the country has been so rapid that its very success has been jeopardized by a railway not being able to be made quickly enough to transport the enormou^s produce. A lifelong experience in India and Egypt has firmly impressed on me the maxim that in the arid regions of the earth water should be monopolized for irriga tion and railways for transport. You cannot leave the waters of the rivers in their channels for purposes of navigation and at the same time take them out of their channels and irrigate the country with them. For navigation you may sub stitute railway transport; for purposes of irrigation nothing can take the place of water. In countries depending entirely on irrigation, the railways should f jllow the banks of the main canals and traverse the centre of the tracts they mean to serve. Now the Baghdad Railway is a desert railway, and though it will put Baghdad in communication with East and West, it will not serve the irrigated parts of the delta of the two rivers. I therefore sho w on drawing No. 52 the different alignments of the railways which would serve the country we hope to irrigate. On the map itself are given the main features of the different lines and the task of selecting the best line and estimating its cost may be left to railway engineers. I confine myself to a statement of the probable quantity of produce such a railway would have to transport. The area to be irrigated between Baghdad and Nasiriyah wdll be 750,000 hectares, and if from this area w r e export so much as represents the rents calculated in paragraph 22 of this report we shall have to handle annually 375,000 tons of cereals and 1,250,000 cwt. of cotton. As the country is famous for its breed of animals, there will be a considerable movement of live-stock, but I have no idea of what this number will be. ■f f W. WILLCOCKS.5 ENCLOSURE C.

Pearson and Son to Foreign Office.—[Received November 17.) Sir, ] 0, Victoria Street, Westminster, November 16, 1909. WHEN Mr. C. S. Palmer had the honour of an interview with you on the subject of Mesopotamian railways, he promised to send you, for Sir Edward Grey’s information, a note of what he then told you. We have the pleasure of enclosing herewith a copy of Mr. Palmer’s report to us on this subject. We have, &amp;c. Eor S. Pearson and Son (Limited), [Illegible], Director. Inclosure in No. 1. Report by Mr. Palmer respecting Railways for the Development of Mesopotamia. IN my report of the 1st instant, which dealt entirely with irrigation, I stated that in my opinion Mesopotamia is not in a position at present to take advantage of large developmental irrigation works. The reasons I adduced were that successful irrigation on a large scale requires a correspondingly large population and cheap and ready means of export. Without these requisites, neither of which Mesopotamia now has, large irrigation works could not be taken sufficient advantage of, and would not therefore return a profit such as would induce capitalists to finance the works either directly through concessionaires or indirectly through the Turkish Government. 2. In my report of the 1st instant, I submitted that Sir William Willcocks advocated, and had submitted designs and estimates for irrigation works that would in one way or another cost many millions sterling, and in addition he had advocated still other irrigation works; but I also stated that Sir William appeared aware of the diffi culties in the way, and therefore, in his last report of the 10th October, 1909, had reduced his irrigation proposals to a moderate present programme ; and it was also mentioned by me that Sir William had recommended the Turkish Government to enter on the construction of a railway from Bagdad to the Mediterranean. It is to explain the conditions affecting this railway that my present memorandum has been prepared. 3. Reference to the accompanying map* shows that Mesopotamia can communicate with the outer world in two directions : one to the west and north-west connects her with the Mediterranean, and the other to the south with the Persian Gulf. In neither case as matters stand, can the existing means of transport be considered satisfactory. So far as the westerly route is concerned, export by water is impracticable, for though the Euphrates is navigable (except for certain cataracts) by native boats ; on the other hand, both wind and current constantly tend to the south, and prevent profitable carriage. Export therefore does not take place in this direction, except in the case of stock, which are driven overland when the season is favourable. Import, however, does take place, goods being carried overland from Aleppo to a point on the Euphrates, thence in rafts to about opposite Bagdad, and finally by road to this place. The time occupied is fifteen days to three weeks, dependent on the season and good luck in escaping stranding or upset. There is also a caravan route from Damascus via Palmyra to the Euphrates. 4. To the south—that is, to the Persian Gulf—both export and import are effected by water, native boats being employed on the Euphrates and native boats and steamers on the Tigris. The difficulties of navigation, however, are great; and although the distance by railway from Bagdad to the Gulf will be only 300 miles, steamers take four days down and five days up, while the native boats take twenty to twenty-five days down and as much as a month and a-half up. The scale of freights is also high. Thus, the up-freight is about 30s, a-ton by steamer and 20s. a-ton by native boat, while * Not reproduced. [2518 r—-1]2 P the down-freight is 18s a-ton for general cargo and at the very least 10s. a-ton for g-ra ' ”’ h ‘t S ' « t0D ° n , t 16 , ave ™g e for g r,lin - liquorice, &amp;c„ by native boat. 8 As the freights between Bussorah and the United Kingdom are 30s. fir imports and o2s for exports, the gross charges, including lighterage, warehousing, dock dues &amp; c at Bussorah reach a considerable amount per ton. It will be seen, therefore, that the vant of efficient communications is one reason for Mesopotamia’s present condition S. bo far as water carriage is concerned, there is not, to my thinking either probability or possibility of permanent improvement between Bagdad and the Gulf he rivers are tortuous, and, even if money were spent on improvements these could not have permanent eftect, for the difficulties of navigation are not least wh^n the water 1 the rl ', ei 15i ow &gt; and of course extension of irrigation must reduce the flow in the rivers and render navigation more difficult. As the fall of the country is sliVit the m u s could no doubt be dredged and canalised m the worst parts, bur the cost would not be small. The revenue from such works would not be large ; they would not pay dmectly, and are therefore debarred from practical consideration. Moreover as regards any canals that may be constructed for development, it need only be mentioned that it is now recognised, even in India, that navigation and irrigation cannot too-ether for it to be seen that canals also must be removed from practical consideratfon when mpio-vement of communications is in question. There remain railways which have proved such immense factors in the progress of all undeveloped countries and which North° AmeKca! 7 eVen ° r Canada ’ ^withstanding the great inland waterways of . • 6 ' 0f such railways there are two, both of which would be of benefit to Mesopo- na, viz., one to the south and the other to the west. The first-mentioned from firSt Sigh .^ a PP ears unquestionably the better to COnstiuct. It would (see map)-- be some 300 miles long only, it would be along a route where there is already a large transport trade both ways, and it would traverse ^rWillia .'wilT k ' lar S® Popufiltion if and when the schemes advocated by Sir WilJiam \V illcocks are carried out and fructify. But to this line there are also strong objections. It would be liable from first to last to competition from river- bome carriage, it would terminate either at Bussorah, a port with a bar, or on the Gulf a some port yet to be created, and whichever port the line terminated at freights U ml 11 WOU t be c 2'' 1 l ,ara t u ’ el y heav y. for the trading vessels to the markets of Europe would have to round the Cape or pass through the Suez Canal. Europe 7 Another objection, and the strongest, is that the route of this railway is west Gift ^ C °* ^ r!' 6 W ” uId be lar « e oom pai'ed with that of a railwav to^he ff St ; , , , e ma P 18 show n in cross hachured blue lines the tracts ofcounti-v affected by the works Sir William Willcocks has received sanction to proceed w”th and m single hachured blue lines the tracts of country that would be improved in some future time when the works Sir William advocates'are constructed, ‘it is not even certain at present that the main works he has advocated will be the ones to be constructed, and even if it were so certain it is at present entirely unsettled where e canals will run. The country is low lying, and earthworks would be heavy unless canal banks were utilised for the formation, and this could only be the case m parts. 1 here is an entire absence of ballast and other material for construction and he maintenance of banks built of the friable soil would not be cheap. Therefore although this must be an important and a paying line in years to come it also appears tliat it cannot be a paying line at the outset. tb,t o' rher “ r 0ne other factor, due to the strong international jealousies in Turkey tint comes into consideration. A German company has an agreement with that countiv as explained below for the construction of a railway to Bagdad from the north-west, and one of the conditions of this agreement is that no Either countrv CnfimtiUh P n * ht t0 , W ° rk a raiiwa y between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf until this German company has reached Bagdad with its railway.

The Turkish Government ovvns the lines south of Damascus ; the French have the lines from Damascus to Alenno ml apparently all rights to the coast west of this line ; while the German railw .v concession, above referred to as blocking a railway between Bagdad and Bussorah also blocks construction of a railway by any but themselves from any part ol the coast west of a line connecting Aleppo and Adana. “ 1 LOast * Not reproduced.3 ^ 10. This German concession known as the Bagdad Bail way is highly advantageous to the concessionaires and burdensome to Turkey : indeed, the only hope of overcoming the adverse conditions embodied in the contract is because they are so burdensome to Turkey. The agreement which dates some years back provides for payment by the Turkish Government of a fixed sum per kilometre of railway constructed; and, secondly, of such a sum per kilometre worked as is necessary to bring the gross receipts up to a certain minimum. The construction cost per kilometre is independent of the class of country traversed and is high as an average. The railway has to be constructed in sections of a uniform length and the payment per kilometre is, as I have said, uniform and independent therefore of the class of country traversed. The railway which started from a point opposite Constantinople under a previous agree ment was extended some six years ago under the present concession to Eregli, and here for a time it halted. The reason is plain. The line, as I have said above, has to be constructed in sections; and the two sections east of Eregli are in highly difficult country where the probable cost of construction is above the Turkish subsidy. The next two sections, however, up to a point opposite Mardin are in easier country, and the efforts, therefore, of the concessionaires were directed to persuading the Turkish Government to sanction and provide funds for all four sections. This, they achieved some eighteen months ago, and apparently they have now persuaded a group of continental banks to finance the work which, it is reported, is to be pressed on with at once. 11. It must be some years, however, before the four sections now to be constructed are built, and after that there will still remain some 000 kilom. of line to finance and build before Bagdad is reached. And after all when this is accomplished it will still mean that from Bagdad to Mersina, the nearest port by this route, the distance will be some 1.250 kilom.—all through country sparsely populated and which cannot, therefore, spare agriculturists for the development of Mesopotamia. In any honest consideration, therefore, of the case the Anatolian Bagdad Railway can be left out of count. 12. An alternative to the railway just described is what used to be known by the name of the Euphrates Valley Railway. This line would start from Alexan dretta, crossing mountainous ranges to Aleppo, then across desert country to, say, Meskene, on the Euphrates, and down this river to the neighbourhood of Bagdad. The railway would be largely along an existing trade route, through country settled to some extent and capable of improvement; but, on the other hand, construction would be costly, the line, on a small-scale map, looks as if it would affect, the German Bagdad Railway, and, above all. Alexandretta, the port, is on that part of the sea-coast blocked by the German Bagdad Railway Company. 13. There remains a line from Bagdad along the Euphrates to Abou-Kemal, then across country to Palmyra and the sea-coast. In combination with the French this line would provide the shortest route to the Mediterranean if carried via Homs and Tripoli. It would be along an existing caravan route, and should intercept a fair proportion of the trade in stock now carried on overland. It would mostly traverse uncultivated and apparently unculturable country between Homs and Abou-Kemal, but, on the other hand, both construction and maintenance along this length should be cheap, while the whole of the trade from /or, at least, should reach the railway at Abou-Kemal by water. 14. Briefly put, therefore, it would appear that the best railway of the future is certainly one from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf, but it would be costly per kilometre compared with that to the west; it would have to compete with water carriage ; its location and success are dependent on irrigation works, and a port yet to be determined and designed ; and the project is hampered by the conditions of a contract already entered into by the Turkish Government with the German Bagdad Railway Company. The line trom Bagdad via Palmyra to the Mediterranean is not hampered by this contract; it is not dependent on the design of prospective irrigation works, and the cost per kilometre should be low. On the other hand, it would be 70 per cent, longer than the Bussorah line, and it could not expect to have the same amount of traffic and receipts as the Bussorah line. It ought in no long time to pay at least interest on construction, but it would be at much disadvantage when the line to Bussorah and the Gulf is built. C. S. R. PALMER.

Reference to previous letter: Description of Inclosure.[This Document is the Property ef Hig Britannic Majesty's Government.] SECRET. Sir Edward Grey, SIR W ILLIAM WMLLCOCKS called upon me yesterday, having arrived from Constantinople on the previous evening. I asked him to explain to me as far as he was able his views and plans in connection with the irrigation schemes in Mesopotamia. He told me that the Turkish Government had decided for the present not to employ any contractors to carry out the survey and preparatory measures for the big irrigation scheme. The idea had been that Messrs. Pearson should be employed for six months in executing the most urgent part of the repairs to the existing barrage and canals, but the Turkish Government had come to the conclusion that it would be better that they should do it themselves, and that later on the big scheme of irrigation should be submitted to tender. He (W 7 illcocks) had asked the Turkish Government for a certain fixed sum, with which he considered he would be able to complete these preliminary works, and every farthing for which he had asked had been granted to him. He had now come over to England to engage competent engineers, and to make contracts for various materials which would be necessary before he commenced operations. He hoped to be able to get Messrs. Pearson to lend him one of their principal engineers for the space of one year. After he had concluded these arrangements, he proposed to return to Constantinople at once, and to go thence to Mesopotamia. I annex a map, in which I have roughly indicated what he proposes to do as regards irritration. You will observe that there is between Bagdad and the Euphrates what is marked as the Saklawiyeh Canal. The people in Bagdad are always afraid that, when the Euphrates is in flood, the banks of this canal may give way, in which case Bagdad would be flooded. In the middle of this canal there is a lake which does not appear on the map, but which I have marked as drawn by YVillcocks. He proposes to build a barrage where the canal joins the Euphrates. This barrage will stop much of the silting which, he says, is very considerable, so that clear water will come into the lake. From the lake he proposes to make a canal 200 kilom. long in a straight line on the right bank of the Tigris. From this canal others at right angles to it will be made covering tbe country intervening between the Tigris and the Euphrates. All this country will, he declares, become an enormous wheat granary or cotton-growing country, and the exports from thence should in a few years’ time be of very con siderable value. Were a railway to be constructed from Bagdad to the Gulf, the only line for it to follow would be one between the Tigris and the canal of 200 kilom., which he proposes to construct. It would then -have to take a south-easterly direction, and cross the Euphrates close to Azanieh, and go thence to the Gulf. Such a railway is, however, in his opinion, absolutely useless for the export of the grain or cotton that would be grown near Bagdad. Instead of such a railway, he strongly urged the construction of one following this line :— It should pass straight from Bagdad to Hit on the Euphrates, where the rocks on each side of the river would form a suitable foundation for the building of a bridge. From Hit the line should, instead of following the course of the river, which has deep ravines on each side of it, continue along the high ground at some distance from the river to a town called Abou Kemal, which has a considerable stationary population. From Abou Kemal the line should go straight to Tadmor, and from thence follow the carriage road to Damascus, where connexion would be made with the Syrian Railway. Willcocks explained that anyone who now went to the Euphrates would tind both banks of the river more thickly populated than could be imagined, and |95C»]crowded with enormous flocks of sheep, and with cattle, horses, goats, and buffaloes, all waiting for the first rain, when the grass springs up like magic and grows all over the desert. Then slowly and on foot the natives drive these enormous herds to the coast for sale, losing many on the road by robbery and death. To reach the coast takes these people several months, while, if a railway were to be constructed, all these cattle could reach the coast within the space of two days. The result of this would be that the breeding of cattle would be enormously increased, and the Syrian desert would become as valuable a breeding-ground for cattle as the grass lands of Argentina and Texas. He argued also that such a railway is essential for the export i of the cotton or grain which is to be produced on the irrigated lands. Were these products to be dependent for export on the Bagdad-Persian Gulf Railway, the cost would be so great as to make it hardly worth while to cultivate the crops. After arriving at the Persian Gulf, the crops would be taken to Bombay, and probably re-exported to Europe, passing through the canal, with its heavy dues. There would thus be very great delay, before the crops reached Europe, and a much longer sea journey than if there were an exit at Tripoli or Haifa. 11 Sir William further expressed his conviction that this railway would become the chief route for pilgrims on their way to Mecca from Transcaspia, Afghanistan, and Northern Persia. They would pass through Kermanshah and, reaching Bagdad, would take the new railway to Damascus, from whence there is a direct route by rail to Mecca and Medina. Were this railway to be built, he felt quite convinced that the Bagdad Railway would never go further than the four sections which are now being built, since the line from Mosul to Bagdad, instead of following the populated country on the left bank of the Tigris, was to follow the right bank through an absolute desert. He further added that, were such a railway to be budt, it would form an excellent channel for the importation of British goods, especially of British cottons, which would be able to compete successfully at Bagdad with Indian cottons, and for which there was a great demand. He realised that this might be disadvantageous to Indian trade on account of the competition which it would meet with from British manufactures, but he could see no reason why British trade should not also have its opportunity. He strongly urged the absolute necessity of Great Britain taking a leading part in the construction of this railway. He understood that the French were ready to go in for it, but that they recognised that British interests were predominant at Bagdad, and they would do nothing without British participation. He was strongly opposed to the construction of a big railway, such as the Germans were building in Asia Minor ; he preferred that it should be a light railway, such as is being built in Nigeria at a cost of about 3,000/. per mile. The length of the line would be 550 miles, and he calculated that, in leaving a fair margin, it might be built for two and a-half million sterling. He expressed his absolute conviction that within a very short time it would be a paying railway, and, were a guarantee given for the first few years, he felt certain of its future success. Sir William intends, I understand, to lecture before the Royal Geographical Society on his irrigation schemes in Mesopotamia, and we may thus be able to obtain from his lecture fuller information than he has given me. I asked him, in view of the importance of the question which he has raised, to go to the Board of Trade and put his views on the Bagdad-Damascus Railway before them, in order to discuss the commercial questions which the construction of such a line will bring into being. He agreed, and I have arranged for him to see Mr. Stanley, of the Board of Trade, to-day. C. H. Foreign OJfice, November 6, 1909. This is very important, and has a bearing on Lynch concession as well as on Bagdad Railway. I do not quite gather whether Sir W. Willcocks thinks a railway from Bagdad to the Gulf will be useless or not, if the Bagdad-Abou Kemal-Damascus Railway is made. We cannot contend that navigation concessions on the Euphrates and Tigris should stand in the way of irrigation. The object of means of communication is to develop country, not to block the development. It seems to me that if the Turks would give us a concession for the Bagdad-Abou1\ ^ en \ a l~-D aiI } ascils liailway, with a right to prolong it to the Gulf, we might let the Bagdad Railway alone. The Turks would have a free hand in irrigation, and the steamer concessions below Bagdad would become relatively unimportant. The Germans ^ would probably claim that we must come to terms with them about any railway from Bagdad to the Gulf, but this might be arranged. We ought, as soon as possible, to have a complete scheme to put before the Turks. The information points to some thing of this kind F 1. The Turks to go ahead with Sir W\ WRlcocks as to irrigation. 2. We to have the Bagdad to Damascus Railway concessions. 3. An arrangement with Turks and Germans as to Bagdad to Gulf Railway. The Turks will probably insist upon dropping the Lynch concession if all this is to be done, and, if so, I do not sfee how we can help that. The vsooner the Bagdad Railway Committee can put this into shape the better. E. G.[This Docmnaiit is the Property ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received October 25.) (No. 849.) Sir, Thcrapia, October 15, 1909. SIR WILLIAM WILLCOCKS, who has been employed by the Ottoman Govern ment during the past year in surveying in Mesopotamia, returned here a few days ago to report to the Government the result of his work. On the irrigation works he has already reported in detail, and His Majesty’s Government are in possession of these reports. At the request of the Minister of Finance Sir William has now furnished a general report, of which I am now enabled to send you a copy. Y r ou will observe that Sir William lays special stress in the interests of this country on the building of a railroad to connect the Tigris and Euphrates delta with the Mediterranean in preference to the construction of a line to unite Bagdad and Bussorah. This enterprise Sir William regards as likely to be profitable, but he tells me that he has not been encouraged to think that British capitalists will favour this scheme. The remainder of the report deals with the irrigation works, which should be undertaken immediately, and the work designed and estimated during the last year, and which is about to be undertaken. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Inclosure in No. 1. Sir W. Willcocks to Ottoman Minister of Public Works. Excellency Constantinople, October 10, 1909. AS directed by you, I have the honour to forward the following memorandum on the development of Mesopotamia. The subjects treated are the following 1 . The question of railways to connect the Tigris-Euphrates delta with the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. 2. The irrigation works which should be immediately undertaken. 3 A resume of the works designed and estimated in 1908—9. _ . 4. An approximate estimate of the work in hand and what will be designed and estimated in 1909-10. 1. The Question of Railways. The Tigris is open to navigation for steamers between Bagdad and Bussorah throughout the year, but as water will be gradually withdrawn fhm the nver for irrigation, this navigation will gradually deteriorate. The need for railways along this line is not immediate, however, and its consideration may be postpone! . Every merchant I have conversed with m Irak is convinced of one thing, and that is that communication between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf ^k^lhTrfn'We whieh the country needs. The hopeless condition of affairs in the delta is m L ge measure due to the fact that the principal productions of Irak have their markets in the Eastern Mediterranean and in Europe, and it is from these same countries that Irak requires its imports ; while in this direction there is no outlet. I am in entire accord with this opinion. The principal productions of the country sheep cattle buffaloes wool liquorice, wheat, barley, and rice-all want to go westwards ; and it is to the lack of means to export these cheaply and to import cheaply the productions of Europe that the present deadlock is due. Immense areas which could be cultivated are not cultivated because the price of transport is prohibitive. It is not, however on y the trade of Irak which would feed this railway, the trade of 1 ersia would follow t e same line via Kermanshah and Khanikin, and in addition we should have the transport [2100 bb —1]9 V. of passengers, and especially of Moslem pilgrims from Central Asia and Persia to the holy cities of Islam. This latter traffic would assume such proportions that the Hedjaz Railway would become remunerative and relieve the Treasury and country of a heavy burden. The railway to Haifa would also benefit. Irak itself would at last be open to European and American travellers, who would come in thousands to see •Baalb''^ Palmyra, the site of the Garden of Eden, and the ruins of ancient Chaldea and Babylonia. These same travellers would see the possibilities of the country and capital would follow them. x The accompanying map shows clearly the proposed lines of railway. Hit is the termination of free navigation on the Tigris , for above it are cataracts. The railway should start from Bagdad, cross the Euphrates at Feluja, and keep in its valley to Hit, a distance of 170 kilom. ; at Hit the railway would leave the Euphrates Valley and cross the level desert by a straight line to El Kaim, near Abu Kimal, where the cataracts end. From El Kaim upwards the Euphrates has no cataracts, while the valley from Her Zor to El Kaim past Mayadin (the ancient Rehaboth) and Abu Kimal is capable of great development. So also is the Khabour River, which flows into the Euphrates near Mayadin and is itself free of cataracts. All the productions of this region capable of great development would reach El Kaim by boat and be from there taken on to the railway. From El Kaim the railway would go to Tidmor (Palmyra) along the old trade route across the level desert provided with wells. At Palmyra are springs. From Palmyra the railway would go to Homs on the Damascus-Aleppo Railway. The railway from Homs to Tripoli on the Mediterranean has been approved of by Government, and will soon be executed by the company owning the Damascus- Aleppo Railway, and may be considered as completed as far as this railway is concerned. When trade is developed, a branch could be run to Damascus from Palmyra, putting Beirout aod Haifa in direct communication with Bagdad. The length of the railway from Palmyra to Damascus would be 200 kilom. The distances work out as follows :— Tripoli to Homs From Homs to Palmyra „ Palmyra to El Kaim ,, El Kaim to Hit .. „ Hit to Bagdad ,. Of new railways to make Kilom. 110 140 300 210 170 820 From Bagdad to the sea by railway will be 930 kilom., of which 820 kilom. remain to be conceded. The distance from Hit to the sea will be 760 kilom. or 425 miles when the railways are completed. The Hedjaz Hail way and the railways from Beirout to Damascus and Haifa to Damascus have a gauge of 1*05 metres (3 ft. 6 in.), while the Rayak-Aleppo line and the line from Tripoli to Homs have a gauge of 1*44 metres (4 ft. 8^ in.). All the South African railways, the East African Railway, and the Soudan railways have a gauge of 1*05 metres (3 ft. 6 in.), which is considered an excellent gauge by many experts for lines crossing long stretches of barren country and connecting important trade centres to each other. I estimate the cost of a railway from Homs to Bagdad, including ample waterway for streams and economy in every other direction, ? at £T. 2,750 per kilometre (4,000/. per mile). 1 recommend American practice in these pioneer railv/ays and not European practice. The total cost from Homs to Bagdad works out to 820 kilom. at £ T. 2,750 or £ T. 2,255,000. Traders at Bagdad estimate that such a railway would transport in its first year from Bagdad alone to Damascus— Tons. First-class passengers .. 1,000 Grain .. .. 6,000 Second-class passengers 2,000 Gales .. 600 Third-class passengers .. 5,000 Wool .. .. 4,650 Horses, cattle, and buffaloes 27,000 Gum 500 Sheep, calves, and goats .. 100,000 Dates .. .. 2,500 The mails Liquorice .. 1.200 The traders estimate that this trade would bring in £ T. 110,000. In addition to this there would be the passenger and pilgrim traffic back to Bagdad, the imports into the country from Europe, including coal, and the local trade between the different3 stations, and the imports and exports at El Kaim station. Hit would supply bitumen and stone to the Tigris, and Bagdad would supply Mosul timbers to the Euphrates. Taki ng everything into consideration we may count on a total gross revenue of A J;wice £ T. 110,000, or £ T. 220,000. With such earnings the working expenses would &gt;e 50 per cent., or £ T. 110,000, leaving £ T. 110,000 as the net profit before the great irrigation works began to have their effect. The moment the railway was open the whole country along the Euphrates up-stream of the Hindia would find itself gifted with cheap transport, and for one acre cultivated to-day a dozen would be cultivated to-morrow. Buffalo-rearing in the marshes would assume great proportions. Whatever system of irrigation may be adopted, it must never be forgotten that Mesopotamia will always be a great centre of live-stock production, and the whole of this stock will have its outlet on the Mediterranean. Once irrigation is introduced, live-stock will increase faster in numbers than the cereal crops and cotton will in area. The soil and water with their 15 per cent, lime are favourable to the rearing of animals, and so are the great steppes which surround the country, and which may one day be covered with herds of ostriches, as in South Africa. 2. The Irrigation Works to be immediately executed. Certain of the irrigation works should be undertaken immediately, to ward off disasters and ensure the country against inundations, which, if allowed to continue, would doom every irrigation scheme in the delta to failure. The works which fall within this category are three in number, viz., the Hindia barrage works, the Habbania-Sakhlawia works, and the Tigris navigation works near Amara. I have written of these works so fully in my reports Nos. 1, 2, and 6, that I need not recapitulate here. 1. The Hindia Barrages on the Euphrates. —The total estimate amounts to £ T. 352,440. These works should be undertaken and carried on with all the vigour the State is capable of. To allow the Babylon branch of the Euphrates to completely disappear would be a national disgrace which would hurt the Government throughout the whole Arab world. The loss of revenue on this branch has been £ T. 50,000 per annum since the river began to change its channel. 2. The Habbania-Sakhlaivia Works on the Euphrates. —The total estimate amounts to £T. 345,840. The day these works are carried out the whole delta of the Euphrates will be free from the danger of inundations, and I speak with some knowledge when I say that the revenue of the delta will be doubled without the execution of any other works. Every high flood on the Euphrates, since the closing of the Sakhlawia branch by Midhat Pasha, has worked a havoc which has discouraged agriculture along 300 kilom. of the river ; and these high floods come on an average once in three years. They frighten people into sowing a smaller area than they would otherwise sow, and when thev come they completely destroy what is sown. If the Sakhlawia branch were left open the crops^ would not be destroyed, but half of Bagdad would be under water. The only solution for the difficulty is the one I propose. If Noah had been an engineer he U would have carried out the Habbania project instead of building an ark; and he would ,'; f&lt; not only have saved his family, but his country as well. 3. The Tigris Navigation Works near Amara. —These works are estimated to cost £ T. 70,100, and are recognised as urgent by everybody. The day the Tigris ceases to be navigable Bagdad will be cut off from the world, for the Euphrates has already left its channel of centuries, and is not navigable to-day except for small boats. The estimated cost of the two works on the Euphrates is £ T. 698,280, and of the works on the Tigris £T. 70,100, or £ T. 768,380 in all. No time should be lost in the construction of these works, as the position is daily aggravated. I propose to the Government to carry out these works by Government agency until contracts have been written with solid contractors of good repute ; and when the contracts are written the contractors will take over what we have done at the cost we have incurred. We know our business and will waste no money. We shall insist on contractors whose names command respect in the financial world, for the great financiers look as much to the reputation of the contractors who are going to carry out the works as they do to the remunerative nature of the works themselves. I request immediate sanction to my proposal and a grant of £ T. 25,000 for this financial' year, £T. 150,000 for the following year, and £ T. 600,000 during the two following years, or £ T, 768,380 in all.4 These are the preliminary works on which will be based the regeneration of the country. 3. Works designed and estimated in 1908-9. _ works surveyed, designed, and estimated during the year 1908-9 are the-* following:— * Aj On the Euphrates— 1. The Hindia barrages .. 2. The Habbania-Sakhlawia works 3. The Feluja barrage 5. Half the Bagdad navigable canal £ T. 352,440 345,840 263,600 72,180 Total 1,034,060 On the Tigris— 4. The Koot barrage 5.

Works estimated in 1908-9 and the Programme for 1909-10 continued. The works on the Euphrates will therefore amount to £ T. 1,856,760, and on the Tigris to £ T. 1,820,480, or £T. 3,677,240 in all. The area irrigated on the Euphrates will amount to 700,000 hectares, and on the Tigris to 300,000 hectares, of which a large part will be date groves and gardens. The taxes may be estimated at £ T. 750,000 per annum. I have, &amp;c. W. WILLCOCKS. o1 t J K Ifio 3 hen) &lt;?q No. 896, dated Baghdad, the 20th August 1909. From Lieutenant-Colonel J.

In continuation of my letter No. 874, dated the 12th August 1909, I have the honour to enclose herewith copies of the seventh, eighth and ninth reports subm.t- ted by Sir William Willcocks to the Minister for Public Works at Constantinople on Irrigation Works in Mesopotamia. The plans referred to in the above reports are being sent separately by registered parcel post. Seventh Report on the Irkigation Works in Mesopotamia. Reclamation Works at Basrah. An examination of the plan of the Tigris will disclose the fact that between Gurna and Garmat Ali near Basrah, a sheet of open water stretches from the 8 hat- el-Arab to the desert on the south. This shallow lake has its bed at a level of about one metre above mean sea, in its deepest parts, and through it the Luphratei is at present cutting its course to join the Tigris at ^ ar ^ at - downstream of the open water, past Basrah, Zobeir, the heads of the Khor Abdulla, and we may say almost up to Fao, stretches a belt of comparatively high-lying land about *1‘8 metre above mean sea level. As the Tigris and Euphrates, travers ing their swamps, can never have brought down much deposit to this part of their delta, the comparatively high land has evidently been formed by the deposit of the Karun river. In ancient days, when the 3 0iat wate J® °/ Tigris entered the Persian Gulf by the western head of Khor Abdulla, and e Karun by the eastern head, the muddy waters of the Karun swept over those lands and laid down their deposit. For the Karun, unlike the Euphrates and Tigris, traverses no swamps, but comes straight down from the Persian hills at a hig vc o- city and carries its muddy waters into the sea. An exammation of the present courses of the Euphrates and Karun, with respect to the two heads of the Khoi Abdulla, and of the contour of the three-fathom line, south of Bubian Island and nearly closing the entrance to Koweit harbour, amply bears this out x That this action has by no means terminated will beevidentbyexamining the nositions and levels as between the southernmost creek at the Garmat All entrance'and the western head of the Khor. AMulla w ere a s ghUy marked bu evident depression shows how the surplus waters of the Jiupbrates in Hood are making a way for themselves across the plain between Basrah and Zobeir towar s the Khor Abdulla. And this is in no way strange, ior at flo £, d tim f: Lvel of the water at Garmat Ali and that at the head of the Khor Abdulla, there L a mean difference of possibly one metre. And just as, in the course of centurTes the Euphrates has left its channel at Gurma and is now flowing into th't’el lrab P at Garmat Ali, so it would eventually leave its channel at Garmat Ali and flow into the Khor Abdulla south-east of Zobeir. The land under the permanent open water, and the comparatively high-lying jand between Call and Zobeir, are both extraordinarily level, and though level- 430 F. D.2 Ung with instruments, the very slight differences of height are disclosed, in riding or walking or driving over the plain the eye can detect no difference. ? and ^ , dea j with an cxtensive level plain inundated in flood, and a large stretch of level land permanently under shallow water. The land it self is exceedingly rich, and the strip of comparatively high-lying land, stretching west of a line joining Basrah and Zobeir, some 16 kilometres i/length by 12 in «n/ h&gt; rV n th A tim ® of ^ e ea l rly ^ hallfahs covered with date groves, gardens, d orchards, and considered at that time as one of the four earthly paradises. How th T- a . nd ls . ea f y understand from the description of the Arab historians. The Tigris joined the Euphrates higher up its course, probably at Irurna, and the low-land liable to inundation was heavily flooded during the inun dations ; a substantial dyke was constructed from the Shat-el-Arab, north of the pre sent Harmat Ah, and a channel was dug along the edge of the desert from the open water to opposite Zobeir which was then known as Basrah. This canal took a right angular bend at Zobeir and went straight to the Shat-el-Arab, down the line of the present Ashar Creek, to the modern Basrah, which was then known f.s Ubulla (Apollyon). This rectangular canal, which was known as the “ Faid or (flood canal) of Basrah, provided the irrigation of those lands, and the appearance of the country was undoubtedly very like what we see on a small scale round buk-es-Shuyukh on the Euphrates to-day. In projecting works for the reclamation of the swamped lands of the Euphrates and Tigris Delta, my first idea was to drain the swamps (an easy opera- Ar -f nS i?[ a C connecting the permanent open water, west of Garmat v! J w i • 6 j or Abdulla, having near its tail a powerful self-acting regulator which taking advantage of the 3-metre tide, would allow the water to flow out and prevent the ingress of the tide Some 800,000 hectares of land could be thus the e , ffects would b ® dlsa strous, and we should have c( nverted 800,000 hectares of swamps, worth much even to-day, into a desert, and the Shat-el-Arab deprived of this reserve of fresh water, would find itself for many months of the year full of sea water, to the great detriment and perhaps destruc tion of many of the 10,000,000 date tre* s with which the tract is credited. A ft er six months’ study of this question, with plan, levels and discharges of the rivers before me, I consider the conservation of these swamps as of the ui most importance to the country, and the works I now pro pose are based on full know ledge of the requirements and capacities of the two rivers, and I make my pro posals with great assurance. J ^ . r J he fi f t work necessary is the construction of a barrage across the Garmat Ah Channel, so as to prevent the cutting back of the Euphrates and the forming up of a deep channel m the open water between Suk-es-Shuyukh and Garmat Ali which would enable the marshes to drain themselves of much of their reserves of fresh water, and so contribute to the salt water travelling up the Shat-el-Arab. While . the Euphrates joined the Tigris at Gurna, some 70 kilometres above Garmat Ali, • it was not able to drain these swamps, as it will be able to do once it has sc ured a deep channel through the open water. In this connection it must be borne in mmd that the Sha.-el-Arab owes much to the steady and constant discharges of the Karun river and if the Persians at anytime begin Irrigation Works on the Karun, and deflect its waters on to their own lands, the position on the Shat-el- Arab will be very serious, unless water has been conserved as I now* propose. At the site of the section at Garmat Ali, marked A A on the plan, I propose building a barrage of the same type as those to be constructed at Root and aluja: viz., a waste weir, 200 metres long, across the present channel of Garmat All, with its crest at K L O O and in continuation of it a regulator with .0 openings of 3 metres each, having a joint waterway in flood of 1,300 square ^ ie t reS 'll p ThlS W1 ! ne&lt; ; d Jo t ck ’ since naviga-ion in the future, as in the pa.t will be carried along the old Euphrates at Gurna. Here the waterway is 900 f0 v Ur 7 0ther ® ma11 openings between Gurna and Garmat Ah, which would have their beds raised to R L O 0 by stone bars thrown across, supphmg an aggregate waterway of 100 square metres. V\'e should thus have a c ear waterway of 2,300 square metres which would be in excess of that utilized to-day in high flood, while a contraction of the waterway in low supply across^ armat Al1 Channel would prevent the marshes being drained at a quicker ^der control 8 COnSldered necessar 7&gt; ^ by means of the regulator they would be As the material of the waste weir settled down, and after a few years assumed a tmal position it would be possible, if considered necessary, to construct piers, and openings for regulation on its crest. This would become necessary the day he Persians employed the waters of the Karun river to irrigate their own lands. Once the Euphrates is eontroUed at the Garmat Ali Creek the reclamation works will follow in natural order. They divide themselves into two classes: first the reclamation of the swamped land between Suk-es-Shuyukh and Garmat Ali: &lt;scco?wc, the reclamation of the higherdying land from between Basrah and Zobeir down to Fao. Between the Euphrates and Tigris lies an enormous swamp of absolutely fresh water covering 800,000 hectares. With the aid of this water, and with its share of what comes down the two rivers in time of flood and freshets, it will be possible to reclaim and irrigate one-third of this area. I propose to con- ime this area to one tract stretching from Khamasia, east of Tel Mughaiver (Ur of the Chaldees) to Garmat Ali. Its southern boundary would be the desert; its northern boundary I shall propose a bank as depicted on the plan to a scale c 66,000 w ^ 110 ! 1 accompanies this report. By dredging along the left of this bank on the hard deposit of the Euphrates, the right bank of the river would be formed on a length of 120 kilometres. The Euphrates Channel would keep to its left, and on its right would be formed a series of basins of a joint area of 200,000 hectares of land, which could all be reclaimed and Cover d with date groves, orchards and gardens (the special feature of Basrah) as well as lucerne and winter cereals, both of which also flourish at Basrah. It would not be necessary to undertake the w T hole o f A^ e u WOrk at ° nCe ' • Tke reclarnation might be made in blocks of 1,000 and 2,000 hectares. In designing these compartments care would be taken to so align the irrigation inlets to the edge of the desert that the same inlets would provide outlets for the rain waters coming down the deserts, and so ensure their not entering the compartments. Towns and villages would be located on the healthy dry desert, a railway would connect them with Zobeir and Basrah, and a numer ous and prosperous community would find homes where to-day not a living being is met with. &amp; 6 Before proceeding to the details of the cost of the works for reclaiming the 200,000 hectares of low land, I turn to the project for reclaiming the 90,000 hec tares of high-lying land past Basrah. Here, the day a barrage is constructed across the Garmat Ali channel we shall be wdiere the Mir Hajjaj was in the early days of the Khalifate, when, by his energy and skill, he converted 20,000 hectares of this land into a veritable agricultural paradise. By constructing two canals, as shown on both the plans which accompany this report, parallel to the course of the Shat-el-Arab, and six kilometres apart, and by constructing two escapes to the two lands of the Khor Abdulla, we shall be able to cover this plain with irri- gants fed from both ends : the existing irrigants being fed from one end only, open to the Shat-el-Arab. One set of irrigants will stretch from the Shat-f 1-Arab to the first canal, receiving their alternating supply from the Shat-el-Arab at one end, and at the other end from this very canal, which will take off from above the barrage at Garmat Ali, and will always carry high level'water. The second canal will take off at the same point as the first, and the second set of irrigants will run from one canal to the other and te open at both ends. Relief will be afforded, when necessary, by means of the two escapes, and the system of irrigation will be very perfect, and wdll be accompanied with as happy results to-day as it was 1,200 years ago. The difficulty of extending irrigation at Basrah under present conditions is that the irrigants are fed from one end only, by the Shat-el-Arab with the rising tide, and the cultivation extends only as far as the water can travel. I have often followed the water of a canal and seen it reach the last clump of miserable half starved date trees, deprived of the water by the outgoing tide just as they were going to receive it. Canals fed from both ends will remedy this evil. It might indeed be partially remedied to-day by self-acting shutters on the creeks, which would pe mit the water to enter, and prevent egress at w ill, but such regulators would be very costly works, and useless in the hands of the present landowners.4 Moreover, with these high-lying canals in existence, if the Karun were used up in Persian territory, the date groves of Basrah would be independent of the Shat-el- Arab, and suffer no harm, even if nothing but sea water came up the river. So irrigated, this part of Mesopotamia should become one of the richest tracts of the country. The only tracts between Basrah and Baghdad which are developed to-day are those which border the opaque waters and swamps of the Euphrates. Irrigation here is easy and free from serious silt troubles, depending only on the maintenance of dykes formed of stiff clay and capable of resisting the action of water. These dykes will be strengthened by the scientific growth of willows, so cut and pruned as to really protect the banks, and not in the ignorant fashion we see to-day, when willows are allowed to grow into big trees, whose branches instead of protecting the banks wave high in the air, and naked stems alone stand between the banks and the waves. The development of these low-lands was always easy, and always the first to be undertaken. All the most ancient towns of Chaldea lay up against the swamps, which have always been fresh water swamps, owing to the action of the Karun river, and which find no parallel in the desolate salt water lakes of the Egyptian Delta. In the earliest settlements of antiquity the dykes to keep out the floods were, doubtless, very ordinary works : but as the country protected by the dykes became more and more wealthy, the ancient Chaldean, and Babylonian Kings constructed magnificent works which were a gauge of the value they placed on this reclaimed land. I have seen hundreds of kilometres of banks bordering the lower Euphrates, from 30 to 40 metres wide, and from one to two metres above flood level, c To reclaim the land at present permanently under water, operations should I think be begun on the lines indicated in the plan, scale 200 ^ 000 . The land would be divided into blocks or compartments of some 20,000 hectares each. This land shallows considerably as one apprc aches the desert. The pumps would be placed along the line of the outer embankment, while the irrigation water would be led back from the side of the desert, as indicated on the plan. In this way, judging from analogy and from estimates of reclamation works carried out in the valley of the Po, I calculate that the cost of reclaiming one hectare of land, and render- ins it fit for cultivation would be as follows:— ’ £ T. Cost of fully equipped bank per hectare .. .. . . 4-0-0 Cost of drainage cuts . . .. .. .. 2-5-0 Cost of all masonry works and structures .. ... .. 2-5-0 Cost of pumping plant erected at site .. .. .. 3-0-0 Total .. 12-0-0 For a capital expenditure of £ T.12 and an annual maintenance charge of 50 piastres per hectare for pumping and protection, we should have land provided with perennial irrigation and perfectly drained. A beginning might be made with an experimental plot of 2,000 hectares, and the experience gained from it utilised for future extensions, so that no serious risks would be run, nor leaps made in the dark. For such a work I recommend an expenditure of £T. 24,000 on 2,000 hectares. I have purposely chosen the desert side of the depression, as the inhabitants would either live on the edge of the desert, or in villages along the main bank or the banks of the canals as suited them. It would be just as easy, however, to reclaim the land on the Shat-el-Arab side of the water. For settlements of Arabs the desert side would be perferable. For settlements of colonists the Shat-el-Arab side might be considered more suitable. On this side the question of provision for the rain water from the deserts would be eliminated. Taking count of the climate, the kind cf cultivation and the comparatively cheap cost of lifting drainage water, I have considered the development of the low-lands as more profitable than that of the higher lands, stretching from Khama- sia past Ur of the Chaldees, and to the north of Suk-es-Shuyukh and north-east of5 Nasrieh on the edges of the delta of the ancient Tigris. But if my calculations are wrong, there is an equal area of land at a suitable level, south, south-east and eas of Nasrieh, which could be developed by flush irrigation for some five months in the year, and by lift irrigation for seven months. The capital cost of such reclamation would amount to not less than £T. 13 per hectare, for though the cost of the banks would be economised, that of the necessary pumping plant would be increased. The maintenance charges would be £ T. 1 *50 per hectare, or three times tha o e low-lying land where drainage water only would have to be pumped. By selecting the most suitable sites of both kinds great economies might be effected, but if the country is to be developed on a large scale, such considerations do not, to my min , carry so much weight as the concentration of settlements. The cost ol reclaiming the whole of the 200,000 hectares capable of irrigation would be £T 2 400 000, and if the work answered the expectations, this land would OTentuaU^at^very moderate estimate, be worth £ T. 10,0(^,000 or £ T. 50 per hectare. ' On such land an expenditure of £ T. 20 per hectare would in reality be no ext’-avagant sum, especially when it is considered that we are quite close to the port of Basrah, with which there would be easy communication both bv water and rail, for, whenever the inevitable development of Mesopotamia comes, Ur of the Chaldees will become, as of old, a great trading centre, and the junction of all lines of railway coming down the Euphrates or Tigris. No railway could avoid it if it wanted to. To obtain land such as this in Egypt, without any salt, provided with easy perennial irngation and drainage, and in the neighbourhood of Alexandria or Port Said, one would consider £ T. 250 per hectare a very good bargain. I now turn to the higher land between Basrah and Zobeir. The proposed - 9 ’ 1 /---i- i i ) sen t with thia 200,000 50,000 canals are clearly depicted on both plans (scale ^ report. The reclamation of the plains lying on both sides of the road below Basrah and Zobeir should prove a very profitable undertaking. Here, allowing for main canals 50 metres wide and 3 metres deep, which would be ample for the thorough irrigation of this country, an expenditure of £T.12 per hectare would be needed. The people who took up the land would dig their own smaller imgants, and here again it would not be necessary to take up the whole 90,000 hectares at once but a beginning might be made with the 5,000 hectares situated between the first 16 kilometres of the proposed Basrrh canal, the first 5 kilometres of the pro posed Zobeir canal, and the existing cultivation between Basrah and Garmat AH. This will entail an expenditure of £T. 60,000, which I recommend on the comple tion of the Garmat Ali Barrage, estimated and cost £ T. 118,200. I therefore recommend for the Basrah reclamation works the following expenditure Garmat Ali Barrage, £ T. 118,200: reclaiming 2,000 hectares of low-lymg land £ T 24 000 : reclaiming 5,000 hectares of high-lying land £ T. 60 000 . or £ 1. 203,200 in all. ’ This expenditure I recommend the State to undeitake, order to (ncourage capitalists to take up the works : but if capitalists can be found, willing, in conjunc tion either with the local people or with the Government in return for a share in the taxes to undertake the whole of this great reclamation scheme, carrying with it the insurance of the 10,000,000 date trees existing to- day against the invasion of sea water, they should be encouraged to undertake it. With respect to the swamps on the east of the Tigris, I recommend that they be left as they are to-day. They enter the Shat-el-Arab high up near Gurna, and constitute a valuable reserve of water for the river. We have so far considered only the direct gains from perennial irrigation: we now come to a new industry which has yet to be intro due d into Mesopotamia, and which accompanies such irrigation in the sub-tropical regions of China. I mean pisciculture. I quote from General Tcheng-ki-Tong’s paper read at the Pans International Congress in 1889 “ i ma y add that witheut these gigantic irrigation works the Chinese could never have carried to such a point of perfection one of their most important indus tries. I speak of pisciculture. Thanks to the abundance of water, the whole of my countrymen, instead of conten'ing themselves with covering with their fishing boats, the seas, rivers and lakes of our country, have devoted themselves to the breeding of fish. The spwan is everywhere carefully collected : far from leaving 430 F.D.it to take its chance, the peasant gives this source of wealth a safe shelter in some spot where a perennial supply of water can be assured. The irrigation reservoirs teem with fish. During winter the rice fields are fallow, the water is let into them and instantly they are full of carp. This industry allows us to make fish a con siderable factor in the food of our people. The fish are either eaten fresh, or salted and dried they are despatched to all parts of the Empire, and sold at a price which is remunerative though it is extremely cheap.” Baghdad ; The, \§th August 1909. (Sd.) W. WILLCOCKS.9 r [r~jf \ 7 c 1 Eighth Report on Irrigation Works in Mesopotamia. The Beled Barrage on the Tigris. The Tigris enters its delta at BeRd, near the site of the ancient Opis, the term'- nation of free navigation on the Tigris, where were situated the famous works of antiquity written of by the historians of Alexander. In reading the desenp- tion of them I used to think thattho'e weirs were altogether artificial, but an examination of the site, together with a survey and levels of the locality, has convinced me that though the weirs themselves across the anc ent bed ot the Tigirs, may have consisted of blocks of conglomerate, put there to raise the summer level of the river, the real dam itself, which tradition has ascribed to Nimrod (Sadd Nimrud) was a massive earthen bank thrown across the bed of the modern Tigris, which prevented the waters of the river from flowing down the natural slope of the conglomerate towards the east, and forced it to main tain a high level down its ancient course. A belt of conglomerate, some 10 metres thick, composed of pebbles cemented together by time, as hard as compact crystalline limestone, overlay a thick belt of stiff clay - , and had superimposed upon it a thick belt of indifferent conglo merate. This conglomerate had a dip towards the east, and can be s en along the left bank of the river from Samarra to nearly opposite Beled. It has a thickness of over 10 metres at Samarra, and under it can be seen some six metres of stiff clay above the water’s edge of the Tigris. The bottom °f the cong o- merate dips under the level of the alluvium of the Tigris below Beled and its upper surface is not far below the level of the land at Samarra. From Samarra toKadasia (north-west of Beled) (the water?) flowed oyer the surface of this hard conglomerate at a high level, while Nimrod’s earthen dam prevented it from undermining it. The high level water above the dam was utilised for feeding the three heads of the Nahrwan Canal on the left bank of the mer, and the Dijail and some eight canals on the right bank. Judging from the level of the flood to-day, as compared with that at the El Gaine head of the Nahrwan, and from the level of the bed of the canal cut through the hard conglomerate, the flood level m the Nahrwan days was some 8 metres higher than it is to-day.. This part of Mesopotamia must have been exceedingly rich, for, however low might be the summer supply of the Tigris, or however late the flood in coming, these canals could draw on all that the river supplied before it could reach any other locality. During the time of the later we*k Khalifs of the Abasside Dynasty, when everything in Mesopotamia was allowed to fall into ruin, even Nimrod s dam, which had stood for thousands of years, was allowed to be swept away. The Tigris kft its high level ancient channel, flowed swift y over the surface of the hard conglomerate, undermined it (for under it lay clay, as before described), and slowly cut back. This cutting back must ha^ occupied hundreds of years for though the changing of the course of the Tigris took place about A. D. 1000 , when Tavernier pasted through Mesopotamia he saw the action still going on, Tud the river tossing over a mighty cataract. The length of time is further testi fied to by the perfect maze of silt banks which cover large parts of the country testifying to the desperate struggle of the hundreds of thousands who bved there to keep themselves alive. But it was all to no purpose ; the river cut back relentlessly and to-day the small decaying village of Sumaicha is all that remains of the once flourishing tract. Mesopotamia had fallen indeed when during all these years we read of legal disputes between landowners, whose title deeds gave them lands on one bank of the river, and the lands lay on the other : but we read of no efforts to restore the dam of Nimrod. To dav the Nahrwan system of irrigation on the left bank has completely fBaanneared Though it is possible that when Mesopotamia sees its great days again some future Nimrod may once more build an earthen dam across the course Tthe nresent Tigris near the site of the ancient one, force the Tigris again down Rs ancient chanief and, utilising the present Tigris up to the village of Sind,a a, a carrying channel of the Nahrwan, construct another dam there, and restore the ancient Nahrwan in all its historic grandeur; such schemes to-day are mere chimeras. 430 F.D.The Dijail system on the right bank, is represented by one very deep canal maintained by heroic efforts on the part of the people, which irrigates the town of Beled and just permits the village of Sumaicha to exist. The people of Beled are expert gardeners and singularly industrious; they represent probably the ancient people of the country. The maintenance of this irrigation and its further development are worthy objects for the Government to undertake. To insure the irnga ion of this tract I propose to construct a cheap barrage of conglomerate thrown across the bed of the river, after the fashion of the temporary barrage con structed m Egypt before its prosperous days permitted of the permanent works now to be seen on the Nile. The conglomerate rock overhangs the site of the barrage and could be blasted and put into the river at a minimum of cost. The pebbles and shingle of which the bed of the river is composed would provide all the material needed to staunch the dam, and we should be able to construct a work which would provide ample water for the irrigation of this tract and permit of its serious development. The water itself, if in sufficient quantity, would course bank o^th^Ti^r^ 111 and Western Ba g hdad &gt; irrigating the gardens on the right There would be no necessity to build a lock, as the river would be open to the passage of rafts and boats for four months annually, and during this time all the produce of the north might be brought to Baghdad. At other times the rafts would have to be re-made at the barrage, though there should be no necessity for this Rivers m North America, on which the transport of material is a thousand times greater than that on the Tigris to-day, are open to navigation or only a few months m the year, and these months are utilised for transport. The proposed work consists of a regulator of 15 openings of three metres °t- he S ° ld and of a waste weir, 600 metres long, thrown across the Tigris opposite the rums upstream of Kadasia. In this work I have proposed pouring bitumen over the uppermost layer of stones of the weir and so cementing the crest. The total cost of the work comes to £T. 72,000. ’ y 0 n k ’ ^ P ro P osed embankments at Baghdad, and the proposed Akkar Kuf Canal Project, covers the whole of the country on the XTank T rl!! 16 dl g rls u P to K o°t : As these works are more or less connected together I do not recommend the immediate execution of this project, but shall wlit till the surveys and levels of the coming winter are completed, and I can submit a complete project for the whole of the country extending from Beled to Koot. , (Sd.) W. WILLCOCKS.13 Ninth Report on Irrigation Works in Mesopotamia. The future of the Tigris-Euphrates Delta. 1. The Delta, an “ arid region ’’.—The Tigris-Euphrates Delta begins at Samarra on the Tigris, and at Hit on the Euphrates, and may be said to comprise a dry area of some five million hectares. Of lands such as those President Roosevelt has well said in the arid regions it is water, and not land, that measures production ”, and the first requisite therefore is to know what supplies of water are available in the two rivers for the different agricultural seasons of the year. 2. Discharge of the rivers.—The crops of the winter season, consisting prin cipally of wheat, barley, beans and root crops, reed irrigation from November to May : the summer crops of millets, lubia beans, sesame, melons and inferior nea need irrigation from April to the middle of July while superior rice needs water from April to the end of August. During September and October water would be needed only for gardens, and possibly for cotton of superior grades when this crop comes to assume a higher place in the ag iculture of the country than it does to-day. To meet these demands, the discharge of the Tigris and Euphrates, independeutly of the supplies provided by reservoirs, may be taken as follows: January February March April May June July August September October November December Discharge in cubic metres per second. Tigris. Euphrates. .. 750 700 1,450 .. 1,400 1,000 2,400 .. 2,100 1,700 3,800 .. 3,300 3,000 6,300 .. 3,000 2,500 5,500 .. 2,000 1,500 3,500 .. 1,100 800 1,900 .. 550 550 1,100 .. 450 450 900 ... 350 350 700 .. 700 700 1,400 ... 900 700 1,600 12)16,600 12) 13,950 12) 30,550 1,380 1,160 2,540 During the winter months, as a general rule, the rainfall is a not considerable factor in the success of the crops, and over large areas of Mesopotamia barey is sown and matured in sole dependence on the winter rainfall, which is consider able enough to allow of the deseits of the country being classed, not as absolute deserts, like those of Egypt, but as steppes, capable of sustaining millions of sheep. In years of exceptional drought the parts of the country liable to inundations in flood are the great stand-by of the pastoral wealth of the country. That the sheep are habituated to drought, and at the same time capable of withstanding it, is testified to by the fact that they are, without exception, of the heavy tailed species. 3 Area capable of being irrigated —Assuming that the duty of water in Mesopotamia would be the same as that of the hottest and driest parts of the Nile valley near Luxor, and in addition allowing for a waste of one-third due to careless agriculture, we may say that one cubic metre per second of water will in winter, irrigate 2,000 hectares, and in summer 400 hectares of rice or 800 hectares of dry crops, such as millet, sesame etc Using the discharge table of the two rivers, given above, we may say that it wil permit of 3,000,000 hectares of winter crops, while the summer discharge will permit of 3,000,000 430 F.D.14 hectares of inferior rice, of 600,000 hectares of superior rice, or 1,300,000 hectares of millets, sesame, cottou, &amp;c. 4. Reservoirs. —In addition to the supplies of the two rivers for the irrigation of the summer area, we have reservoirs situated within the Delta itself, capable f of storing the excess waters of the months of April and May, and aiding the rivers in July and August. The Akkar Kut Reservoir is capable of maturing 100,000 hectares of superior rice : the Babbania 100,000: the Euphrates Valley above the Sakblawia 20,000: and the ijatural reservoir east of Baghdad 20,000: or 240,000 hectares in all. In addition to the above, the swamps, marshes and overflows of both rivers will be available for the future development of the country: but even without them we have sufficient for all the requirements of the country for many years. As to the duty of reservoir water I consider that all such water should be utilised in the falling flood for the cultivation of superior rice, so as to have the minimum of loss from evaporation and at the same time irrigate the most valuable crop of the country. During the months of March, April, May and June the rivers have ample for all requirements: it is in July and August that the want will be felt. Allowing the very liberal discharge of 160 cubic metres per day per hectare for supe rior rice for 60 days, a hectare would need nearly 10,000 cubic metres, or a depth of one metre of water. Nearly the whole of this water, after irrigating and helping to mature the rice would flow through the fields, reach the swamps at the junction of the two rivers and swell the reserve of water available for irrigation near Basrah. I have seen such water, in highly developed countries, doing double duty, irrigating one field, then another, in years of exceptional drought. Similar results could doubtless be produced here, but that will come when the country is developed far beyond what it is to-day. 6. Tracts to be irrigated. —It will be evident from the above that the whole of the area of 5,000,000 hectares in the Delta is not capable of being irrigated : and in a comprehensive scheme for the whole Delta the first point is to decide where the available water can be utilised to the best advantage. For it must be borne in mind that never in the history of Mesopotamia has the whole of the country been under irrigation at one and the same time. In the earliest days the centre lay in the country between Niffar, Erech, Ur of the Chaldees and Tel Lo. In later times the centre moved up to Babylon, embracing the country from Sippara in the north to Shenafiya in the south, and extending towards the modern Koot. In the time of the Persian domination Ctesiphon became the centre of the irrigated regions, extending from Opis in the north to Babylon in the south, and embracing the great Nahrwan system on the east of the Tigris. During the early and prosperous days of the Khalifate the irrigated areas lay round Basrah, Wasit and Kufa, while remnants remained of the earlier Babylonian and Persian systems. As the Khalifate dimiriished in vigour, one by one these irrigated tracts fell out of cultivation, till all that remained was the easy direct irrigation along the Euphrates past Hilla, and the centres round Suk-es- Shuyukh and Basrah. After all this vicissitudes, ranging over many centuries, what remains to-day is the restricted irrigation from near Bumadi to Hilla and from Samawa to Suk-es-Shuyukh on the Euphrates: that on the Shat-el-Arab, and the rice tracts of Amarah and the low lands of the Hindiya branch. 6. Rice. —It is rice that introduces a new element, and that a very impor tant one into the consideration of irrigation in Mesopotamia. In earlier times, apparently, no rice was grown here: to-day it is unquestionably the most valuable crop in the country: and tracts which were once of comparatively small value, have now, owing to the introduction of rice cultivation, the most brilliant prospect before them. 7. Question of silt. —The great canals which, without the aid of barrages on the main river, carried the muddy waters of the flood, required a dense population to furnish the immense amount of labour necessary to keep them free from silt. These canals have all practically disappeared, while the lands dependent on the clear water of the Euphrates, which were the first to be reclaimed, are to-day the only flourishing tracts. The clear water obviates the necessity of silt clearance, and allows of development of the land, at the hands of a comparatively sparse V 6- f V f V' r15 € W V v V F r'- population: moreover, as already stated, rice has introduced a new element of agri culture, unknown to the ancients, and created new centres of cultivation. To meet the requirements of irrigation, as I have shown in the Fourth Report f on the Koot Barrage) the Tigris and Euphrates are happily placed in respect ol their relative levels. The water of the Euphrates can be made to r^ddy irrigate the whole area capable of irrigation between a line j oining Feluja to Baghdad, and another joining Hilla to a point on the Hai some kilometres south of Koot, and. also (as far as levels are concerned) all the land on both the Hilla and Hmdiya branches along the entire length. The Tigris, on the other hand, is capable of irrigating the lands i.orth rf Brghdad, which the Euphrates cannot reach and also the whole of the lands along the course of the Hai, or ancient Tigris, from Koot to Nasirieh, as well as all the lands along its present course past Amarah. 8. Selection of tracts to be irrigated—Seeing that the area capable of being irrigated is exceedingly large, and the water available for the valuable superior rice crop insufficient, it would be unwise to bring under cultivation any tract that could be utilised for the storage of the surplus flood water : for not only will such water serve the rice crops, but the beds of the reservoirs themselves will also pro vide pasturage for sheep and cattle when the water has flowed ofi. To take the Euphrates first, there are large tracts along the river which could be so utilised to the great advantage of the pastoral and agricultural community alike. The first such is the stretch between Hit and the head of the ^aknlawia on both banks of the river. Owing to the deltaic nature of the country all the high lands lie near the rivers, and the lowlandsaway from themalongthe deserts. Bv the construction of the proposed works at the head of the Sakhlawia, as detailed in the second report, and the excavation of a canal two kilometres in length, provided with a regulator at Bustan on the left bank of the Euphrates, water sufficient to mature 20,000 hectares of superior rice could be stored, while m addi tion 20,000 hectares of pasturage would be systematically irrigated. 9. Habbania escape.—On the right bank of the river similar conditions prevail, and in addition we have the Habbania depression south of Rusadi. This depression could not onlv be utilised as an escape for excessive flood, as proposed m the second report, but by the construction of a regulator m the desert cutting south of the lake, and a canal some seven kilometres m length, along the edge of the desert, be made to provide a milliard of cubic metres of water capable o matur ing 100,000 hectares of superior rice. In this region all the high lands along ^ Euphrates would be cultivated, as they are to-day, directly from the nver. For this tract therefore I consider no irrigation works necessary beyond the provision of suitable dykes, and of openings from the river, capable of regulation, together with the works set forth in detail in the second re P? r ^- J h 0 e ® e n ^ ks kave b ?f n estimated to cost £ T. 199,300, to which should be added £ T. 20,000 for the smaller regulators and dykes, making a total of £- T. 219,300. 10. Feluja Barrage Tract.— Continuing down the Euphrates I recommend that the areaof 260,000 hectares lying between Baghdad and Feluja to the north, and Museyib and Sawera to the south, be irrigated directly from the Euphrates by means of a barrage at Feluja (see third report) and the system of canals and drains depicted on the plan-scale J^-and designated as the canal system depend- ent on the proposed Feluja Barrage. Knowing the country to be traversed by this system well, having run three lines of levels along it, and made the preliminary calculations, I find, taking it as a typical tract, that an area of 260,000 hectares requires £ T 328.000 63.000 88.000 60,000 260.000 Major canals 220 kilometres at 2,400 Minor canals 310 300 Drains 220 400 Dykes 100 600 Masonry works .. • 999.000 333.000 Total .. 1,332,000 Contingencies at 331 per cent.16 This represents a cost of £ T. 5*2 per hectare. The Feluja Barrage has been esti mated to cost £ T. 241,600, or roughly £ T. 1 per hectare for 260,000 hectares, mak ing a total of £ T. 6*2 per hectare for the whole area, or allowing for further con tingencies £ T. 7 per hectare for the net area. This may be considered a reason able figure. This tract of 260,000 hactares, therefore, with its barrage, may be considered as necessitating an expenditure of £ T. 1,620,000. Such land, at a moderate esti mate, may be taken to be worth £ T. 50 per hectare, representing a total value for the area of £ T. 13,000,000. I do not, however, recommend the immediate expenditure of all this money, unless capitalists are prepared to take up the whole of the works, in conjunction with the Government. For the Government I recommend the construction of the Feluja Barrage estimated to cost £ T. 241,000 of the Regulating Head of the Nahr Melcha, described in the fifth report, and estimated to cost £ T. 22,700, and of a canal down the proposed alignment of the Nahr Melcha, along the left bank of the Euphrates. This canal would connect the existing Abu Garaib, Radwania, Mahmudia, Latifia and Iskandria canals with the river upstream of the Feluja Barrage, rendering them independent of the rise and fall of the flood. Such a canal, j l with the necessary regulating works, would cost £ T. 107,000. The Baghdad navi gable canal might wait until some decision was come to about the Euphrates valley railway. The area irrigated by the abovenamed existing canal is greatly hampered, under present conditions, by the fact that the flood arrives too late in the season to full benefit the winter crops, and recedes too soon to permit of full advantage being taken of it for the summer crops. With the construction of the barrage and the canal which I recommend, these adverse conditions will be remedied, and the pre sent fluctuating supply give place to systematic perennial irrigation. The cost of the above works would be as follows:— r i ■' &lt; i The barrage at Feluja The Nahr Melcha Regulator The Nahr Melcha Total £ T. 241,600 22,700 107,000 371,300 V These works I very strongly recommend for immediate execution. With the aid of the above works an area of 30,000 hectares of summer crops and of 80,000 hectares of winter crops might be irrigated, and with superior crops such as perennial irri gation would insure, the taxes should amount to £T. 95,000 per annum. The water consumed in summer would be 40 cubic metres per second, and in winter 40 cubic metres per second. 11. Hindiya Barrage Tract ,—Still following the course of the Euphrates I recommend the construction of the proposed Hindiya Barrage : the restoration and improvement of the cultivation on the Hilla branch : the construction of right and left bank canals from above the Hindiya Barrage for the Hindiya branch: and lastly the construction of a barrage on the Shamia branch of the Hindiya, near Kefil, so as to save the Kufa branch from impending extinction. For the closing of the Sakhlawia head, which has resulted in the whole of the Hilla branch flowing into the Hindiya, seems now to be in a fair way to rob the Kufa branch of all its water, and obliterate the cultivation which has existed for centuries. The Hindiya Barrage works, including the extra cost due to the fact that the right flank of the existing barrage is built on sand, will cost £T, 526,200, as detailed in the first report and its supplement. The alignment of the right bank canal from upstream of the Hindiya Barrage has been inspected by me, and will terminate at the heads of the canals near Tuarej. It may be estimated to cost £ T. 20,000. The country to be traversed by the left bank canal has not been seen by me, but this canal will be far more expensive than the other, and may be estimated at double the cost or £T. 40,000. The Shamiya Barrage, judging from analogy with the works on the Hindiya, will cost £T. 120,000. / jr-17 For this branch therefore I recommend an expenditure of £ T. 180,000. Money here will be well spent. We have a large and industrious population, * . accusv.omed to work, and the moment their water-supply is assured they will take full advantage of it. With the aid of the above works an area of 40.000 hectares of superior rice, and of 40,000 hectares of winter crops might be irrigated, and with the superior Crops such as perennial irrigation would insure, the taxes should amount to £ T. 60,000 per annum. The water consumed in summer would be 150 cubic metres per second, and in winter 30 cubic metres per second. For the Hilla branch a series of cheap barrages will prove the most efficacious and economical means of development, leaving the canals to the interested parties. Of such, barrages I propose three, costing approximately £ T. 25,000 each, or £ T. 75,000 in all. I also propose regulating heads for three branches which seems capable of mastering the main branch itself. These regulators would cost £ T. 6,000 each, or £T. 18,000 in all. The total expenditure proposed is £ T. 93,000. With the aid of these works an area of 20,000 hectares of summer crops and of 80,000 hectares of winter crops might be irrigated, and with superior crops such as perennial irrigation would insure, the taxes should amount to £T. 50,000 per annum. The water consumed in summer would be 75 cubic metres per second and in winter 60 cubic metres per second. The Hindiya Barrage and the Hindiya and Hilla branches would cost as follows:— . _ Hindiya Barrage Hindiya Branch Hilla Branch .. 526,200 180,000 93,000 Total .. 599,200 12. Works on the Euphrates.—The total immediate expenditure on the Euphrates is therefore— recommended £T.

The hectares of summer irrigation would amoun t to 9d(X)0 and of winter irrigation t o 200,000. The taxes rn.ght b-xP-ted to realise £ T 206,000 per annum: while the expenditure of water summer 265 cubic metres per second, and in winter 130 cubic metres per second. i o Baghdad To turn now to the Tigris. Here as well as on the Euphrates are to be femnd large areas of land on which flood water could be stored for subse quent usJ Subareas, though eminently -table for cuU.vation am better reserved for reservoirs and pasturage, for reasons already given. In the eign n (rm thp Beled Barrage) I have described how the Tigris to-day enters its deha over the ruins of one of the most interesting works of antiquity. Fiowing eastTancTsouth past Beled, Hindiya, Sadiya and Mansur.a aWng the new a ^nmen which the river cut out for itself some 900 years ago, near to Jedmda it rejoins t old course. At this point, I should imagine, since the days of the catastrophe ^ river in high flood has invariably breached its right or left bank or both, and flo Wlv over the iowlvinv lands on both sides of Baghdad. Compared with what it is at Jedaida, the channel of the Tigris at Baghdad is so contracted that if by any 430 F.D.18 i chance the banks were not breached at Jedaida during a very high flood and the whole supply of the river were to come down its channel, the highest houses in Baghdad would have a metre of water flowing over the sills of their doors. . Bui]* and situated as Baghdad is in the middle of an enormous depres- s,on and liable as it is to be flooded out directly by the Tigris, and indirectly by the Euphrates through the Sakhlawia Branch, the best course to follow in the interests of Baghdad itself and of the country in general is to accept the situa tion and provide the best remedy to hand. At one time, thinking of Baghdad alone, I imagined that it would be good for the country if some escape could be found into the desert for the excess waters of the Tigris as has been found for those of the Euphrates. After a careful survey of the short-lived floods of this river I should consider it detrimental to the country in general to deprive the valley of the sur plus floods, while there are depressions in which the water might be stored in order to maintain the discharge of the falling flood. Fortunately the valley of the Tigris is well suited for water storage. On the east of Baghdad lies a depression 30 kilo- metres long by 7 kilometres broad, eminently suited to water storage, while on its west lies the Akkar Kuf depression, capable of storing milliards of cubic metres of water every cubic metre of which could be utilised to help the falling flood b or Baghdad therefore I propose two strong embankments, one on either side of the town. I he left bank embankment would stretch from above Kadhimain to the Carara Bridge. The trench from which this dyke was made would provide opposite the wa is of Baghdad, sufficient material to fill up the unhealthy holes and depressions within the city walls which are a curse to the inhabitants. Ibe embankment on the right bank would stretch from above Kadhimain to the Sakhla- wia. It would be well, both in Kadhimain and Baghdad, to leave the horrible pits full of P u trid water round the brick kilns, outside the bank, so that the muddv waters of the flood running down the trench from which the bank was made, might m time nil them up and obliterate them: but considering how close the houses lie it may not be practicable. By medical men, who speak with knowledge, some of the worst diseases wath which Baghdad is afflicted, are attributed to the drink- mg of the water which collects in these pools during very high flood. The trenches will allow the water, once the flood has begun to fall insteadxf stagnating as it does now for months round the city, to flow c.utkly away while it is still frt sh and wholesome, aiding the river with its added supply and after having ccoled the atmosphere of the town for a couple of months, not to pollute it with miasma. Moreover the pasturages round the city and the brushwood which provides fuel for its inhabitants, would be improved. U The Akkar Kuf Depression.—1 have stated that the Akkar Kuf depression is capable of storing 1J milliards of cubic metres of water, but this I think is but a small portion of what this lake can do for the amelioration of Mesopotamia. If an examination is made of the level of the flood water in the lake, and of the long line of depression in continuation of the lake, between the tv o rivers along the right bank of the Tigris, I think it will be possible by means of an embankment provided with a regulator not only to control the water, but also to irrigate and reclaim partly for agricultural and partly for pastoral purposes, the whole tract stretching V?? Baghdad to Koot on the right bank of the Tigris, and well into the interior of the Delta. The works that would be needed would be breed trenches cut through the massive embankments of the ancient canals r,rd the Delta from the Euphrates to the Tigris, and prevent this water from flowing southwards The line 1 should propose for this canal I have indicated on the map (scale 1 ) which accompanies this report. If the surveys which I hope to make in October next conhrm what I have said, it may be possible to utilise not onlv the surplus waters of the Tigris, but aho the surplus waters of the Euphrates in low floods, and put the tract of country stretching past Kutha, En Nile and Niffer again under cul tivation. It might even be possible to lead this water-if levels suit—across the line of the great Sarat canal of the Khalifs, west of En Nile into the Hilla branch of the Euphrates about 30 kilometres downstream of Hilla. This point will be settled by levelling this winter. This water will have deposited its silt m the great Akkar Kuf depression and will flow southwards very like the whole some opaque water which we see in the Euphrates past Naserieh and Suk-es- bhuyukh, giving no trouble for silt clearance, and able possibly to generate a r19 cultivation as Wealthy as that we see on the lower Euphrates to-day, which for 12 months in the year never sees any water but what is of this character. The possibility of dealing with large bodies of water in flood, free of deposit, may be of inestimable value to the country. All canal engineers will appreciate what I say. Indeed it is a common saying among us in India that devoted irriga tion engineers die with the letters SILT engraven on their hearts. The irrigation down this depression could not have been possible in antiquity. But during the last 800 years, the great canals which took the muddy waters of the Euphrates and spread them over the delta have ceased to exist, while the Tigris and Euphrates being deltaic rivers, have been steadily raising the level of the land along their banks, so that deep depression has formed between them along the whole length of the Tigris, which may enable us, with a comparatively small initial expenditure to irrigate a tract of country as large as can be irrigated by the exist ing surplus supply of the Euphrates and Tigris. To this project I hope to turn my full attention and employ all my engineers, as soon as the great heat of the summer passes, and we are able to take the field again. Judging from the levels it is evident that a canal some 20 kilometres long, going east from the north of Musayib, and crossing the ancient Arakhtu and Kutha canals, would lead the water of the Euphrates into this depression on a very sharp slope.' Though it would be unwise to lead the muddy waters of the Euphrates flood into the depression, and so obliterate it, it would ensure the cultivation of the crops dependent on the water coming down from Akkar Kuf, if at the time that the clear waters of the Akkar Kuf reservoir came to an end, the clear water of the Euphrates which follows the flood were drawn upon in si.flicient quantity for the requirements of the cultivation. The proposed line of canal from Akkar Kuf southwards, and the line Irony the Euphrates north of Musayib eastwards, are both depicted on the plan in conspi cuous dotted lines. During flood time the irrigation of this area could be aided by canals drawn directly from the right bank of the Tigris and leading the muddy waters of the flood along alignments which would not interfere with the free flow of the clear water from the north. 15 Adhem River .—We have so far considered the right bank of the Tigris from Beled to Koot. On the left bank, judging from the plan and the basins which he along the Adhem river upstream of the Hamrin hills, the construction of a dam at the point where this river enters its gorge through the hills, a reservoir could be constructed capable of storing one milliard of cubic metres of water which accord- ing to calculations given above, would suffice for maturing 100,000 hectares of rice, and be a reservoir of great value. No work constructed, as in ancient days, at the outlet would, probably, be of such value : but in the interests of the people who inhabit this part of the country, as distinct from those of Mesopotamia as a whole, it would undoubtedly be of advantage to reconstruct the ruined dam of antiquity and reopen the ancient Nahr Batt. This work I recommend. It would be carried out in conjunction with the local people who are very anxious to see the ancient irrigation restored. 16 The Duala River .—of Baghdad I have already proposed a reservoir which, on a preliminary estimate, will be capable of maturing 20,000 hectares of rice. Of the Dyala river which flows into the Tigris below Baghdad, and its irrigation, and capacity to feed the Nahrwan canal, if restored, I can speak with no knowledge, as this country has y&gt;t to be inspected by me this winter. The lands letween the old Nahrwan and the left bank of the Tigris arc, according to analyses of the soil, the richest in all Mesopotamia, end their development should prove exceedingly remunerative. As the channel of the Dyala in its last 40 kilometr s is strangely de' p. and at the lowest stages of the n\er permits of Tigris water travelling upstream, it would be well worth the while of a i oncessionnaire company to consider the irrigation of this tract by means of powerful pumps placed on the Dyala some 20 kilometres above its junction with the Tigris, which would pump Tigris water over this region. By the construction of a h arrage across the Dyala It this point the water of the river itself could be utilised by free flow while the river had sufficient water, and the pumps would always be at \hand to make up deficiencies. In this way an economical system of free flow com bined with pumped wate, might be provided for the irrigation of this great tract which stretches from the Dyala to Azazia and cover some 60,000 hectares. What ever proportion of the ar/a were taken up I think the scheme would be a profitable one, worked in conjunction with the local proprietors or with the Government. 17. Left Bank of Tigris.—From Azazia onwards to Kc^t I propose to allow the Tigris, whose right bank here will be piovided with a strong dyke to prot ct the extensi\ e cultivation on that bank, to find free vent for its excess waters over the lands on the left bank. Care should be taken, however, that all the great depressions into which the water can flow on this bank are provided with ample outlets for the wat r. In this way the water stored during high flood will be imme diately available for the rice crops, and the depre sions themselves being quickly drained will be available as healthy pasturage for sheep. By thus utilizing the large area of land liable to submersion we shall be able to provide water in addition to that of the river itself for some 20,000 hectares of rice (possibly twice as many) and also increase the pastoral wealth of the country. J 8 - K° ot Barrage.—We have now arrived at Koot. Here I prop ~ se to construct the Koot Barrage, and a new head for the Hai branch as detailed in the fourth report. We shall have converted the existing channel of the Hai—at present dry for six months m the year—into a canal providing perennial irrigation, while the present channel of the Tigris will afford ample scape for all the exe ss waters of the flood ; an ideal state of affairs anywhere in the world, but rare in M* sopotamia. For the tract to be irrigated by the channel known to-day as the Hai branch or Garraf, but which was the mam stream of th 5 Tigris for thousands of years, I antici pate the happiest of results. Even in the days of the early Khalifate, when the great ISahrwan and Dejail systems of canals commanded the head waters of the Tigfis Delta, there was enough surplus water available to allow this tract being call d by Arab historians a wheat granary. The day the Koot Barrage is constructed this branch will command the supplies which in ancient days fed the Nahrwan and Dejail systems, and it will be the centre of a great system of irrigation This winter the necessary surveys of the Hai will be made, and levels taken, tin order to fix the sites of the regulating barrage and the heads of the irrigants. For this tract, as for all others in Mesopotamia, I propose that the Government construct the barrages, and leave the canals and water courses to the cultivators themselves. It is tne rule of the country, and eminently suited to it. In a soil so easily sxured out as that of Mesopotamia it is waste of money, in the beginning o its development, to spend millions of pounds in digging canals which the current, if well directed and regulated, can scour out for itself. All the ancient systems of irrigation here were harassed by the fact that the canals were under taken by the Government of the day and the rivers left to themselves. I propose to r gulat' the supplies of the rivers by barrages, and let the canals be looked alter by the interested parties, until the country has reached a stage of development far in advance of anything we see to-day. Levels and soil both encourage one to adopt this principle, and moreover barrages are comparatively cheap both in con struction and maintenance. For this branch therefore I recommend the construction of some six barrages Tv oTon 6 ^ th £ f0rmer costin g some £ T * 25,000 each, and the latter e V Koot Barrage, estimated to cost £T. 640,900, the six barrages c t* an&lt; * ^ cana l heads £ T. 30,000, the total expenditure comes to i. ozu,yuo. i nt ^ °/ t'hese works an area of 80,000 hectares of superior rice, and of 150,000 hectares of winter crops might be irrigated: and with superior crops such as perennial irrigation would ensure, the taxes should amount to £ T. 180,000 per annum. The water consumed in summer would be 300 cubic metres per second, and m winter 100 cubic metres per second. On this branch, as on the Hilla and Hindiya branches, I have allowed for an extravagant use of water during the early years of development. Indeed I have allowed fully fifty per cent, in excess of that on the Feluja Barrage canal system. As the country develops and water and land become more and more valuable the waste will gradually disappear.21 19. Tigris Navigation. —From Root downward to Curna the development of the country may be allowed to follow its natural lines, which are those of rice cultivation in the low lands and barley in the higher tracts. I do not consider the country sufficiently developed or found to invite public works of any kind, except those detailed in the sixth report for ensuring the navigation of the river. These have been estimated to cost £ T. 70,100. For the large reserves of water in the swamps on the left bank of the Tigris I have proposed, in the seventh report, that they be left as they are, a reserve of water for the Shat-el-Arab. 20. Basrah Reclamation—To the reclamation of the low lands on the right bank of the river, and of the higher lands from near Basrah, to F&amp;o, the whole of the seventh report has been devoted. In this report I have described how the Euphrates has changed its course, and instead of joining the Tigris at Curna now joins it near Basrah. This action of the river is not in the interests of the country, and makes the date groves of the Shat-el-Arab more than ever dependent on the Rarun. If at any time the waters of the Rarun were to be utilised in Persian terri tory the position of these groves might become critical. To put these valuable plantations of some 8 to 10 millions date trees out of the leach of danger, and make it possible to develope about 90,000 hectar.es of land near Basrah, inundated only in flood, and some 200,U00 hectares of land per manently under water, I have recom mended the construction of the Garmat Ali Barrage at the tail of the Euphrates, at an estimated cost of £ T. 118,200. In addition to this I have recommended that some 5,000 hectares of high-lying land, and 2,000 hectares of low-lying land be reclaimed as an experiment in order to encourage capitalists to u ^ertake the whole scheme. These experiments have been estimated to cost £ T. 84,000, which with £T.118, 200 for the barrage amount to £ T. 202,200. 21. W(yrks on the T^m.—Summarising what has been said about the Tigris, we have first of all the Beled Barrage north of Baghdad, designed to replace, though in a very partial manner, the dam of Nimrod round which so much interest centres. The immediate execution of this barrage (described m the eighth report) I regret I cannot recommend. We have next the dykes for the protection of Baghdad and its suburbs on both banks of the rivers; the alignment of these dykes will be fixed this winter in conjunction with the President of the Municipality. Until then the cost cannot be estimated. Following the course of the river we have the scheme for the irrigation of the right bank of the Tigris to Root, which will be studied this winter. Then comes the Root Barrage and the Hai bran h, on which an immediate expenditure of £T. 820,900 This is the only irrigation work recommended on the Tigris. The anticipated revenue is estimated at £T. 180,000 per annum, and the expenditure of water at 300 cubic metres per second in summer and 100 cubic metres per second in winter. £ oitt. .1 over m«00 h.eU.e, ol land fn the Basrah Vilayet, I have recommended an expenditure of £T. 202,20 . The total expenditure so far recommended for the Tigris is therefore £T.

Government. A 7 under Government and work the canals by22 h / Mesopotamia, the policy I propose is, I am convinced, the most suitable to the country. The Government undertakes those works which it can best execute and maintain, and which gives it complete control of the waters of the rivers • whil- th&gt; w ‘“ ,h * y “ 23 EUP,nates Valley Railway.—Taking therefore both the rivers we have seen SSfi ono IT expend * ture 0f £T - \2 8 3.000, yielding an estimated revenue of £T 386,000 per annum the area capable of being irrigated will be 520,000 hectares Besides this we have areas of cultivation of kinds scattered over the country, which cannot be under 200,000 hectares in extent, and there are also millions of hectares of pasturage to be gradually converted into irrigable and cultivated land. All this agricultural and pastoral wealth depends for its full development on cheap transport to the markets where it is consumed. Such transport the lands round Basrah enjoy, but the progress of the rest of the country will be absolutely depen dent on railways leading direct to the Mediterranean. Fortunately for Mesonot- amia the same markets where she can dispose of her products are those from which she obtains her supplies of manufactured articles and coal, and the railways could I be counted on to yield a steady revenue. . A line of railway ma Aleppo to Alexandretta would secure the shortest route A line ma Damascus to Beyrout would secure the pilgrim traffic to the sacred cities of Islam. A line via Damascus to Haifa and continued to Egypt would secure, m addition, direct communication between this country and Eevot and introduce the superb agriculturists of theNile valley into the valley of the Euphrates The development of Mesopotamia is so bound up with the construction of the Euphrates Valley Railway, that I press its claims as much as I do those of the great irrigation works. With Hit, the terminus of free navigation on the Euphrates d is- 800 klloI ^ etres from the Mediterranean by a possible railway, the truth of what I say must be patent to all. ^ From Baghdad to the Mediterranean there are three lines possible, each with its special advantages, but from Baghdad to Basrah, when once the development of the country has begun, the really remunerative through line will be from Bachdad down the right bank of the Tigris and the Hai, by way of Ur of the Chaldees. Such a Ime would at first have to face heavy competition with the river-borne traffic but as development advanced, and the water of the rivers were used up in imitation there would be no question of its absolute necessity and its power to pay This railway would traverse that part of Mesopotamia whose development seems the easiest, and which would be the first to feel the effects of the reclamation works. I close this report with a direct appeal to the new spirit which animates the ^iriEmpire The last voyage I made before coming to this country was up the Nile from Khartoum to the great Equatorial lakes. In this most desperate and forbidding region, described by travellers as “ a damp hell ” I was filled with pride to think that I belonged to a race whose sons, even in this inhospitable waste of waters were struggling in the face of a thousand discouragements, to introduce new forest trees and new agricultural products, and ameliorate in some degree the con ditions of life of the naked and miserable inhabitants. How should I have felt if in traversing the desert and swamps which to-day represent what was before the Arab conquest, the richest and most famous tract of the world, I had thought that I was a scion of a race in whose hands God had placed, for hundreds of years, the destinies of this great country, and that my countrymen could give no better account of their stewardship than the exhibition of two mighty rivers flowing between deserts to waste themselves in the sea for nine months in the year, and desolating everything in their way during the remaining three. No effort that Turkey can make can bi too great to roll away the reproach of these parched and weary lands whose erv ascends to heaven. J Baghdad; n The Aiujust, 1909. J (Sd.) W. WILLCOCKS. G. M.

FOURTH REPORT. On Irrigation Works in Mesopotamia. Ill (2) The Kut Barrage. I now come to the second of the directly remunerative works for the amelio ration of the country, viz., the construction of a Barrage across the Tigris about 11 kilometres upstream of Kut, and the moving of the head of the Hai branch to this point. We thus gain a head of water proportionate to the slope m 10 kilometres length of the river, which will be of signal service m restoring the Hai branch to the position it occupied for thousands of years at the main branch of the Tigris. For thousands of years what is known to-day as the Hai branch, and locally as the Garraf, was the main stream of the Tigris. Midway between Kut and its junction with the Euphrates are the ruins of \Vasit, one of the three capitals of the early Arab conquerors, the remaining two being Basrah and Kufa. During the ^6 of the Baghdad Khalifat Wasit was considered as the granary of the country, which could always be relied on in every condition of the river. Not far distant from the point 334 F. D.of junction of the Hai with the Euphrates is Tel Lo, one of the most ancient ruins in Mesopotamia, and opposite the junction itself is Tel Mughaiyar, the ancient Ur of the Chaldees, the port of Chaldea. Of this tractIbnSerapion, writing in the time of Haroun-el-Rashid, says*— “ Now from the Tigris, at various points below the city of Wasit, are taken many canals which either flow into the swamps, or else flow into one another. Of these we have already mentioned the finest and largest. The Nahr Ban passes by villages and domains, and flows into the swamps. The Nahr Kuraysh flows by villages and domains and falls into the swamps. The canal As Sib flows through villages and domains and from it many minor canals are derived. The Barduda is a fine canal and flows into the swamps. Such therefore are the canals which are taken from the Tigris, and we have so detailed them that thou shouldst understand the matter/' The work which it is proposed to execute will restore all this ancient pros perity to a tract comprising from 700,000 to 800,000 hectares of irrigable land and will moreover provide for the Tigris a navigable channel straight to Basrah’ far superior to the tortuous course of the present Tigris past Amarah. I know’ of no work in all Mesopotamia which will have such far-reaching consequences Whether navigation or irrigation be considered, there is no remunerative work in the country which can be compared with this. During the last 900 years that the Tigris, deserting its ancient course at Kut has flowed in its present channel, scarcely any water from the Tigris has helped to raise the level of the lands along the Hai branch. And in addition to this no water from the Euphrates has reached the tails of the great canals which, in’the times of the Babylonians, Sassamans, and the early Khalifs, used to pour the muddy waters of the Euphrates over the plains south-west of Kut, helping to raise their level. During all this time the bed and water level of the Tigris itself has been steadily rising, and with it the level of the lands near the river ; so that to-day as far as levels are concerned, we are in a very favourable position forthe irrigation of all this land. But this is not all. The Euphrates and the Tigris are very happily placed for mutually aiding each other in the irrigation of the country From opposite Baghdad down to Hilla the Euphrates lies higher than the Tigris' and its waters can be utilised for the irrigation of the country between the two rivers to within a short distance of Baghalia upstream of Kut. From this point the Tigris begins to command the country, gradually becomes higher than the Euphrates, and is capable of carrying on the irrigation of the country to the extre mityof the delta by the agency of the Hai branch, which is a magnificent natural water course, large enough to be the main channel for the irrigation of 800 000 hectares, and possessing a length of 200 kilometres. Such a canal could not be excavated to-day at a less cost than £ T. 1,500,000. This valuable canal is at our disposal the day the Kut Barrage is construced. The level of the Tigris is high, the whole of the land lies at a convenient level, and is capable of easy irrigation : while the main Tigris of to-day provides a magnificent flood escape for the excess waters of the inundations. Owing to this not only will it he possible to irrigate directly from the Hai throughout the tweleve months of the year but we shall also have a flood escape which will protect us from inundations Such ideal conditions exist nowhere else in Mesopotamia. As at Faluja I propose building the Barrage in the dry, at a severe bend of the river where there is hard soil for the foundations. At the extreme mht flank there will be a lock 75 metres by 20 metres. The Barrage will have 40 openincrs of 5 metres each, with 7*5 metres depth of water on the floor in flood. In con tinuation of the Barrage, and to its left, will be a waste weir 400 metres lonf? across the bed of the Tigris. The method of construction of the weir will be the same as at Faluja. The masonry core has been designed in sections, so that as the pitching settles gradually into the bed of the river, it will adjust itself and when in three or four years'time the stone has settled to its full depth, the section^ will be cemented together. In the estimate of quantities for the waste weir I have allowed 50 per cent, as at Faluja, in addition to the quantity of pitching so that ample provision may be made for settlement. Both here and at Faluja I propose to burn the massive pitching at site in kilns where the bricks will be allowed to be fused together, as is being done at the Hindiyah Barrage. These kilns will beburned on the weir itself, well above the level of low-water, and when burnt as massive monoliths, they will be blasted into large fragments and deposited on the down-stream side of the river. On the Tigris where there is neither stone nor lime of any kind, this method of construction will exactly suit the requirements of the work. The clay of Meso potamia is eminently suited for bricks, providing hard and heavy blocks, which is exactly what is wanted. The smaller pitching at Faluja will come from the desert at the site of the work. At Kut such material will come from the countless mounds which mark the sites of ancient cities in the vicinity. I calculate the maximum discharge of the Tigris as 5,000 cubic metres per second. The Barrage, the waste weir and the channel of the Hai, which will be 100 metres wide and five metres deep, will provide ample waterway for this dis charge. I estimate the cost as follows:—The Barrage £ T. 136,200: the Lock £T. 103,700, the waste Weir £ T. 87,000, the diversion of the Tigris £T. 174,000, and the diversion of the Hai £ T. 139,300, or £ T. 640,900 in all. The irrigable aYea is, as already stated, between 700,000 and 800,000 hectares of the very best land in Mesopotamia. If this work is not remunerative no irrigation work in the world can be expected to be so. It stands almost unique in its capabilities of development. The work will take four years to build, and will be capable of being utilised from the day of its completion.

(Navigable Canal between the Euphrates and the Tigris at Baghdad.) The moment the Barrage at Feluja, dealt within the third report, is con- T a L nossible dv means of a navigable canal, to secure navigation Btructed, it will b ii,n T^nubrates and the Tigris. It would be difficult the whole of g such a scheme; for the to exaggerate the imp ? commun i cat ion, by water, between inconveniences attachmg to ^ejac^f Nervation. The existing means of trans- the two rivers is a matter rf ever^cm^ c ance and caravans over inferiot tr^kf The’Sent lime stone and bitumen which are abundant on the Euphrates tracks, ineexcciieui . R on fUe Tigris, and the timber which comes cannot find ^ way ^ t t0 the town3 0 n the Euphrates, except ^an^w tSirexpense. If, moreover, navigation is interrupted on the TiS the Euphrates route cannot be utilised and vice versa. I have mstanccd w ^ tion 0 f intercourse and the interchange of readily be imagined +T „ ots gRuated on the two rivers is hampered and pre-8 tion is provided. i x will also be possible to run a line of small steamers from Bagh dad to the neighbourhood of Karbala and Nedjef, creating a traffic which should prove remunc rative. The drawbacks above referred to are obvious enough even in the present condition of the country. They will be greatly accentuated immediately irriga tion works on a systematic scale are started, and the true development of the country begun. Not only will the execution of the works themselves be greatly facilitated by the existence of the canal, but, thanks to cheap communication by water, the increased produce of the country between and along the two rivers will readily find its way to Hit, the northern limit of free navigation on the Euphrates and the na tural future port of Mesopotamia. Hit is situated at a distance of only 800 kilometres, by possible railway communication, from the Mediterranean Sea. A large increase in the quantity of cereals and in the numbers of cattle and sheep reared, may be confidently expected from the inception of systematic irrigation works. The natural outlet for this agricultural and pastoral wealth is to-day, as it was in ancient times, the shortest and cheapest 1 rade route to the Mediterranean and the ports of Egypt and Europe. There are to be found the markets for the sale of the exports of Mesopotamia and for the purchase of all the commodities which Mesopotamia needs. I had hoped at one time to find a comparatively cheap navigable passage throughout the year between the two rivers by the way of the Sakhlawiya branch of the Euphrates, but further study convinced me that this would entail spreading the water of the Euphrates over hundreds of square kilometres of country, with a consequent enormous loss of water by evaporation if left lying in the depressions the whole year round, and also the loss of very considerable areas of arable and pasture land. The real route for a perenially navigable canal is by way of 1 he Abu- Gharaib canal. Reference to the plan will show that I propose taking navigation, for the first 16J kilometres, down the Nahr Melcha or great central canal from which the whole country between the Tigris and Euphrates will be irrigated. From this point a canal, to be known as the Baghdad canal, will leave the Nahr Melcha and make for the Tigris south of Baghdad, being put into navigable com munication with the Tigris at its 40th kilometre. The canal itself will then flow parallel to the Tigris for another 30 k lemetres, irrigating the country beyond the ancient Seleucia. The Baghdad Canal will therefore, in addition to providing navigation between the two rivers, irrigate 25,000 hectares of very rich land, the taxes on which should amount, on the most moderate estimate, to £ T. 25,000 per annum. Much of this land will produce food stubs and garden produce for the Baghdad market. With the report I send the following plans :— (1) Plan of the country between the Euphrates and Tigris along the line of the Navigable Canal: Scale (2) Head Regulator and Lock for the Nahr Melcha. (3) Head Regulator and Lock for the Baghdad Navigable Canal. (4) Tail Regulator and Double Lock into the Tigris. (5) Longitudinal Section of the Baghdad Canal. Now the Nahr Melcha itself will be made 35 metres wide, while the width of the Baghdad Canal will be 10 metres. If this latter canal were made independently of the°Nahr Melcha, it would need no Regulator besides its head Regulator on the Euphrates, and would require a bed width of 10 metres from head to tail. In order not to confuse the accounts as between the Nahr Melcha system and the Baghdad canal, which is a thing apart, I have, in the estimates, debited the Bagh dad Canal with the whole of the cost of the Head Regulator and Lock on the Euphrates (£ T. 22,700), with as much earthwork on the Nahr Melcha, in its first 16-i k'lometres, as a 10 metre wide canal would necessitate, and with the whole earthwork of the 40 kilometres of the Baghdad Canal up to the Tail Lock on the Tigris. The Nahr Melcha will be debited with the cost of the Head Regulator and Lock for the Baghdad Canal (£ T. 11,900), and the earthwork on the first 16^ kilometres of its length, assuming a bed width of 25 metres. This is a very fair division and represents exactly the cost divided proportionately between the two works.11 No. 841, dated Baghdad, the 4th August 1909. From— Lieutenant-Colonel J.

The Navigation of the Tigris .—The River Tigris on a length of 805 kilo- (*-' metres between Baghdad and Basrah, is the only means of communication worth the name between the capital of Mesopotamia and the outei world. If this navigable channel were interrupted, Baghdad would be completely isolated, and looking at the state of the river as it i&lt; to-day, this is not a remote possibility. Baghdad to Kut .—Between Baghdad and Kut the distance by water is 345 kilometres, though the distance by land, neglecting the sinuosities of the river, is only 165 kilometres. Baghdad stands at 35 metres above mean sea level, while the level of Kut is 17*5 metres. In this reach of the river navigation at low water is impeded owing to the existence of shoals, but is practically uninterrupted. The width of the river may be taken as 350 metres, with a depth of 8 metres in flood, diminishing to 2 metres in low supply. The fall of the water surface is 1 in 20,000. The discharge in flood may be taken as 5,500 cubic metres per second and in low supply as 300 cubic metres : while the velocity in flood is 6 kilometres per hour, and in low supply 2 kilometres. In this length of 345 kilometres no works are necessary. At Koot the Hai branch, itself the ancient Tigris, leaves the right bank of the river, discharging up to 1,000 cubic metres per second in high flood and dry in low supply. Kut to Amarah .—Between Kut and Amarah the distance by river is 245 kilometres, as against a direct land route of 190 kilometres. The fall in the level of the land is 9 metres, Kut being 17*5 and Amarah 8*5 metres above mean sea level. In this reach navigation is easy all the year round. The width of the river may be taken as 300 metres, with a depth of 8 metres in flood diminishing to 2 metres in low supply. The fall of the water surface is 1 in 35,000. The discharge in flood may be taken as 4,500 cubic metres per second at the beginning of the reach, and in low supply as 300 cubic metres along the entire length: while the velocity in flood is 6 kilometres per hour and in low supply 2 kilometres. In this reach the first of the branches which deprives the Tigris of water in low supply is met with on the right bank above Amarah. This branch known as the Bitara discharges about 1,000 cubic metres per second in flood, dimi nishing to about 100 cubic metres per second in low supply. But it seems as though the water which enters the river by infiltration between Baghdad and Amaiah during the time of low supply, makes good the loss of the water taken by the Bitara, for the lew supply down stieam of the Bitara seems to be the same as at Baghdad. In addition to the Hai and the Bitara numerous small branches and overflows teke off the waters of floed, so that the Tigris above Amarah, at the tail of the reach, may be considered as discharging 2,500 c. metres per second in high flood. Amarah to Gurna. —Between Amarah and Gurna tin distance by river is 140 kilometres as against 105 kilometres by the direct land route. The fall in the level of the country is 5*5 metres. Amarah being 8*5 and Gurna 3 metres . above mean sea level. In this reach the Tigris experiences many vicissitudes, and it is here that all the difficulties of navigation are to be found. At Amarah on the left bank of the river, the Chala branch leaves the Tigris, with its bed about 2 metres lower than that of the Tigris itself, and dis charging 1,000 c. metres per second in flood and 150 c. metres in extreme low supply. The extreme high flood discharges of the Tigris, therefore, below Amarah may be taken as 1,250 c. metres per second and the low supply discharge as 150 c. metres. The width of the river averages 180 metres, with a depth of 4 metres in flood, diminishing to 2 metres in low supply. A short distance down stream of Amarah on the right bank the Majar Kebir leave &gt; the Tigris. This branch discharges about 500 c. metres per second in high flood and 30 in low supply. Immediately below it on the left bank the At al ant a branch takes off, discharging about 300 c. metres per second in high flood and 30 in low supply. Both these branches have their beds lower than13 that of the Tigris, and with the Chala, they constitute a distinct menace to the existence of the Tigris as a river. In the reach below Kila Saleh, after all those branches and overflows have left the river, the Tigris itself is about 60 metres 9 wide, with a depth of 4 metres in high flood, and 2 metres in low supplv. The discharge may be taken as 300 c. metres per second in flood and 70 in low supply. In this whole reach navigation is extremely difficult at low water. Steamers have to be handled with considerable skill, and are delayed again and again. In some years the large steamers have had to suspend their running, the mails being conveyed in launches. This state of the river continues to near Ezra^ Tomb. Here the waters which have left the river by various branches, enter it again through the swamps, and the river gradually swells its volume, so that at Gurna it is some 180 metres wide, with a depth of 6 metres : the water being nearly free of deposit and of a dark transparent colour and marshy odour. The effect of the contrary current due to the tide from the Persian Gulf is felt up to Gurna, though the tide helps to swell the river to near Ezra’s Tomb. Gurna to Basrah .—Between Gurna and Basrah, on a length of 75 kilometres, the river is from 250 to 550 metres wide, with a depth of 8 to 14 metres. In ancient days Gurna was the point of junction of the Euphrates and Tigris, but is no longer so. Indeed a little Tigris water may occasionally travel up to the Euphrates, but no Euphrates water reaches Gurna. A little below Gurna, on the left bank, the Shat-es-Suaib which brings in th* waters of the Kharka and the marshes, joins the river which, though known from Gurna to Fao as the Shat-el-Arab, is in reality the Tigris. A short distance above Basrah, on the right bank, the Euphrates flows into the Tigris at , Garmat Ali^ Where the two rivers meet the Tigris may be taken as 380 metres 1 ° r • wide and 10 metres deep, and the Euphrates as 190 metres wide and 24 metres deep. The water of the Euphrates at this point has no deposit, and presents an opaque and wholesome look, in marked contrast to the dark marshy water of the Tigris. Immediately below the junction the river increases to a width of 550 metres, with a depth of 14 metres. Basrah is 2'5 metres above mean sea level, and the extreme difference between high and low water, as affected by the tide and by the discharge of the river itself is about 3 metres, extreme high water being about 2’5 metres, above mean sea, and low water minus 0’5. At rhe head of the Khor Abdulla, about 25 kilometres south of Basrah, the difference between high and low water from the Persian Gulf tide, on the 11th and 12th January 1909, was found by Messrs. Watts and Moore to be P854 above and below zero, making a difference of 3'7 metres. Basrah Zo Fao.—From Basrah to Fao is 100 kilometres, and this length of the river is navigated by ocean-going steamers. On the left bank at Muham- marah, about 35 kilometres below Basrah, the Shat-el-Arab is joined by the Karun river, some 400 metres wide and 11 deep, and discharging from 4,000 c. metres per second in flood to 150 in low supply. The Karun is a river esse tially different to either the Euphrates or Tigris. It traverses no marshes, but comes straight down from the Persian hills, carrying in flood the same deposit that it carries at Ahwaz: and the addition of its rich and plentiful supply is one of the principal factors in considering the Shat-el-Arab or Basrah river. From the above it will be seen that there are four branches of the Tig’ is which endanger the navigation of the river. The first is the Bit ira above Amarah. Here I consider the danger is not very serious, as the velocity in low supply is insignificam: and though, in order to furnish a complete project, I have designed and made estimates for a work at the head of this branch, I have done so on academic grounds, and do not recommend its execution. But t he three remaining branches, the Chala, the Majar Kabir, and the Atalanta are a strious menace to the existence of the river, and works for the proper regulation of all of them should certainly be taken in hand, if any serious effort is to be^ made for keeping communication open between Baghdad and Basrah. The principles which underlie the designing of works such as these are well known to hydraulic engineers, and I have designed these works in accordance with them. Three main points are essential: firstly to allow that portion of the high flood to fully escape from the river which the river itself could in no wise carry ;14 to prevent the water at low supply from so escaping that the main river itself run dry : and thirdly to provide a fixed sill, so that no regulation be necessary. The first of these th r ee essentials, viz., the necessary waterway in flood, nrght be found by building the Barrage at an angle to tl.e cur ent of the stream, but I &amp; have thought it preferable to obtain it by lengthening the Barrage and build ng at right angles, whatever the respective cost may be. The second point is gained by keeping the level of the crest of the weir a little b^low extreme low water. The crest has been designed always at 50 centimetres below low water. The third point is gained by designing the Barrage as a solid weir. The work may therefore be described as a solid substantial waste weir, with its crest 50 centimetres below low water, and its length such that the area below the crest and high flood level is exac r ly that of the branch itself in high flood to-day. The work as designed will be an asset to the country when, eventually, navigation has found its way down the Hai branch, in that they will consist of great masses of pitching which will be ready for transport to any locality where they may be needed. I estimate that cost as follows: -the Bitara £ T. 46,300: but I do not recommend this as a work to be carried out immediately : the Chala £ T. 42,300: the Majar Kabir £ T. 17,300: the Atalanta £ T.10,500. These last three works should certainly be undertaken, and I recommend the expenditure upon them. If the work on the Chala, for which the public seem very insist ent, were alone canied out, the entire water available in the Tigris in extreme low supply would very likely deepen the Majar Kabir and the Atalanta, and make them even more dangerous than they are at present. The treatment of the Sakhlawiya branch of the Euphrates, and tli3 disastr ous consequences which have followed it, have taught us that no works can be undertaken in this country without a study that shall be both comparative and comprehensive. I had at first thought of many other works for much-needed improvement of the navigation of the Tigris, especially by means of “ mattrasses,” growths of pophr and willow, river training by spurs and the cutting off of severe elbows, but I cannot recommend the execution of any of them, as I feel confident that t-e construction of the Kut Barrage will make the Hai branch an excellent navi gable channel, as it was for 1,000 of years, and the present tortuous channel of the Tigris may be left to itself. But this statement in no way refers to the Chala, the Majar Kabir and the Atalanta, the works on which should certainly be carried out, or Bag ' dad may any day find itself cut off completely from the outer world, and Basrah and Baghdad lose all their Customs duty for goods in transit to Persia: Muhammarah will become the port of the Shat-el-Arab, and the Karun the highway. An examination of the plan and longitudinal section of the Tigris, which have already been sent, and of the Gauge and Discharge diagrams, which I now send together with a plan of the first 12 kilometres of the Chala, showing its width and depth and favourable situation for taking the whole discharge of the Tigris, will amply bear out what I have said above., (Signed) W.

To The Director, Commercial Department, Intelligence Branch, Board of Trade, 73 Basinghall Street, London E.C. With my letter Be. 839 dated the 4th August I sent you a eery of Sir William Willcocke* sixth report on irrigation works in Mesopotamia. I understand that after writing the report Sir William telegraphed to the Minister for Public Works point ing out the grave danger of the Tigris leaving its bed and following the course of the Chshla, Me jar Zebir or Atalanta canals, in which case Baghdad would be cut off from water com munication with the sea, and the Turkish Government would lose its present large Customs Revenue, while Uuhammarah might become the pernmnent port for the Persian trade. This telegram a , ; p eari to have caused some consternation in Constantinople for the Minister has now telegraphed to Sir William Willcocks to say that Parliament has voted £.T. 14C000 for expenditure thisthis year in addition to £.T. 7C10C for the works on the Chahle, Hejer Eehir and kk Atalanta canals. 2. I have alec heard from E.B.U'e Ambassador at Constanti nople that it is proposed to leave the giving of contracts for irrigation works in the hands of Sir William Willeocks. Sir William informs me that, if he were a Contractor, he would be willing to take a contract for any of the works at the prices estimated. Sir William would probably be ready to accept any tender submitted by a firm which he recognised as of first class reputation, if the tender was based on his estimates. 3 . I cannot quite understand how it is proposed to spend tll9 soa of £.2. 14C0C0 , but I understand that it has been practically decided to carry out the works costing £. 2 . 70100 on the Chahla, liejer Eebir and Atalanta canals. The estimates and drawings of these works should reach you via fc Bombay about the same time as this letter. 4 . 13y suggestion is that some first class firm should at once offer to carry out these works at the estimated cost sub.ect of course to subsequent agreement as to specifica tions and dates of payment and completion. With a definite offer before him Sir William would probably be able to ' ottain the approve. 1 of the Llinistry cf Puu 1 j.c Wor^s and a practical ‘beginning might “be made. These comparativelysmff.ll works would provide most useful experience, ..^ich could be utilised when the big works are undertaken. 5.

I have, etc., Sd/- Z % Ramsay, Lieut. Colonel, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia &amp; H.E.K's Consul General, Baghdad.Supplement to the First Report on Irrigation works in ICesopotamia. The Rindiya Barrage . j&amp;O y Vfhen designing the v/orks for repairing and adding a Lock to the existing Hindiya Barrage I had assumed that the whole of tills work was founded on soil such as that depicted in the boring made by Cugnin and shown in hie plan. On the 7th August, as immediately reported to the Minister for Public Works, M. Mougel, who had been present when the foundations of the work were laid, came to my office, with photographs, and informed me that though the left flank and the middle of the Barrage were founded on stiff soil, the right flank was founded on the fine sand of the river bed, and owed its preser vation only to the fact that it was not submitted to the seme action of the river as the rest of the Barrage. Tith these new facts before me it was evident that the opening in the -middle of the weir, which relieved the right flank oi its full share of the work, ought not to be completely closed until some other provision had been made for relieving this part of the Barrage. I therefore immediately re-designed the proposed lock, and instead of having a solid connection between it and the existing Barrage in continuation of the present crest,I have added seven openings of three metres each between the lock andand the existing B&amp;rrage, so as to provide an opening under control in place of the present opening which is not under control, and is gradually 'but surely under^sjnining the v/ork. As this work must he carried out before any final repairs can he made to the existing Barrage, I very strongly recommend its immediate execution. The cost of the lock as originally designed without the Regulator 7 /as £.T. 26500; the cost of the work as designed now with the Regulator is £.T. 39800, making a atxffKxen difference of £.T. 13300. This expenditure is unavoidable, and would have been included in the original estimates had I known the fecte I knew today. The addition of £.T. 13300 to the cost of the works given in detail in the first report brings the total to £.?, 3,26200 and it is this latter figure which appears in the ninth report. Sd/- H7.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No* 656 dated the 21st June 1909, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a report by Sir William Willcocks on the Barrage he proposes to build at Feluja on the Euphrates. The five plans in connection with the above scheme I am sending you in a separate cover. 2. As these documents are being sent to you at the same time as Sir William Willcocks is sending them to the Turkish Government, I beg that they may be treated as confidential. I have etc*, Sd/- J* Ramsay, Lt. Colonel, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and H* B* M's Consul General,on Irrigation Works in Mesopotamia I nv first report I divided the works to he proposed into three classes. ( 1 ) Works necessary for the prevention of disasters. (2) Works necessary for the maintenance of the navigation and irrigation which exist today. (3) Works necessary for the amelioration of the country. The two reports already sent in have dealt with the necessary projects in the first of the above classes. Projects in the second category are in hand. After an examination of the behaviour of the Tigris and its branches I har e been led to the conclusion that the very expensive works which will be necessary to maintain navigation on the Tigris between Kut and Basrah via Amarah, in a thoroughly efficient and permanent manner, will be rendered unnecessary by the construction of the Kut Barrage, which will ensure not only irrigation but also navigation to the whole country from Kut to Basrah. The report therefore, dealing with navigation as such, will follow that on the Kut Barrage, where it finds its natural place. Ill (1) THE PB L UJA BA BBAGE. I now come to the first of the remunerative works for the amelioration of the country, vis, the Feluja Barrage on the EuphratesEuphrates* It is proposed to construct a Barrage on the Buphrates f south of Eeluja, at the head of the present Abu Garaib canal. This Barrage will ensure perennial flush irrigation to the tract of country lying between Eeluja and Museyib on the Euphrates and between Baghdad and Kut on the Tigris. Of this tract Ibn Serapion, writing in the time of Haroun-er-Rashid, when the canals were, far inferior to what they were in the old Babylonian and Sassanian days, says 'This country is irrigated by four canals taking off from the Euphrates and tailing into the Tigris. The Euphrates feeds a canal called the Nahr Issa (the modern Abu Garaib). This canal irrigates the villages and domains on both its banks. The canals of the City of Peace (Baghdad) are fed by this canal. The Euphrates feeds also a canal called the Nahr Sersar (the modern Mahmoudia). This is a great canal whose waters irrigate the country by means of charads and levers. A. bridge of boats crosses the canal, along whose banks stretch villages and domains. The Nahr el Malik (the ancient Nahr Melcha) also takes off from the Euphrates. Numerous villages and fertile domains stretch along both its banks. A bridge of boats thrown across the canal serves many fields and villages. The Nahr el Malik itself feeds numerous canals'. (This canal used to tail into the Hai branch of the Tigris south of Kut, and was considered by the ancients as the most important public work executed by the Babylonian Kings). 'Prom the Euphrates takes off also a canal calledcalled the Uahr Kutha, which feeds numerous canals and numerous villages. It is crossed hy a bridge of boats. At its tail it flows into the Tigris ten leagues south of Madain (Seleucia) w . This last canal was the special object of regard of the Kings of Babylon, as one of its branches supplied flush irrigation to the city of Babylon, through which it flowed as a navigable canal. main Euphrates it was exceedingly difficult to keep up perennial irrigation on canals taking off directly from the river. With canals fed by one important feeder canal, which will maintain flood level throughout the year in every canal which it feeds, irrigation will be far otherwise. As soon as the Peluja Barrage is completed, it will not be necessary to wait for the excavation of all the ancient canals nication with the modern canals Abu Garaib, Radwania, Mahaoudia impetus will be given to the irrigation of the country which will encourage settlers from every part of Turkey in Asia. It is owing to this fact that I am of opinion that the Peluja Barrage will be remunerative from the day it is completed. It will moreover permit of a canals navigable throughout the ye&amp;r, being opened between the Euphrates and Baghdad. In ancient days owing to the absence of Barrages on the which depend on this feeder, but ^digging a canal along the alignment of the proposed Nahr el Melcha, and putting it in commu- and Latifia, which receive irrigation throughout the year, an / TheThe Barrage will be constructed in the dry on the outcrop of desert at the head of the Abu Garaib canal, and will in consequence have sound foundations. Like the new Hindia Barrage it will be provided with a lock 50 metres by 8 metres, and / will have 30 openings of &amp; metres each, with 6 metres depth of water on the floor. No masonry Barrage or Regulator can be built on the light sand of the Euphrates or Tigris, but across the bed of the river I propose to eonstruct a waste weir of pitching thrown into the river, which will sink into the sand until it is stopped by friction. This waste weir will be constructed of very large blocks of stone on the down-stream side, gradually diminishing in size towards the up-stream side where it will consist largely of pebbles and coarse desert sand. The muddy waters of the Euphrates filtering through this barrier will leave a deposit behind them and gradually cement the weir, just as the waters of the Nile have cemented a similar work thrown across the Rosetta branch of that river. The greatest depth of the Euphrates, at the Eeluja waste weir, is nine metres, while on the corresponding work on the Rosetta branch of the Nile it is 17 metres. This combination of waste weir with Barrage, which I consider a happy one, will allow of economical regulation, ensure aa^le water way for the sudden floods which descend on these rivers, and allow of the required canals being taken off at severe bends of the river, like every canal in Babylonia was takentaken off for thousands of years. This point I consider essential to the success of the canals, especially in keeping them from silt. This work will probably take about three years to k construct, during which time it will possible to dig a sufficient A trench along the upper length of the proposed Nahr el Melcha to put all the existing canals between Baghdad and Museyib in communication with up-stream sidd of the Barrage, which will be independent of the rise and fall of the river. The proposed Barrage and Lock are estimated to cost Ic.T.86200, the waste weir £.T.53800, and the diversion of the Euphrates £.T. 101600 or £.T.241600 in all. I strongly recommend the construction of this work at once,. as its waters will immediately irrigate lands in the vicinity of Baghdad, and put heart into the capital of the country. The total irrigable area of the section as depicted on the accompanying plan is 260000 hectares, capable of being eventually increased to 400000 hectares. Sd/- ¥.

IN continuation of my letter No. 43, dated the 24th April, 1909, 1 have the honour to submit the following report on Sir William Willcocks’s latest recommendations to the Turkish Government. The sketches attached will help to make the recommendations intelligible to persons who do not know the geography.* Shortly after the Euphrates enters the plain is a place named Rumadi, and down to this point the bed of the river is capable of carrying 3,500 cubic metres a second. From the most ancient times there was a large escape at Saklawiya, but some twenty or thirty years ago this was closed, and ever since the Euphrates, when it is in flood, breaks its banks on one side or the other ; it must do so, because the bed of the river lower down near the barrage is only capable of carrying 2,500 metres a second. The existing masonry barrage needs repairs, but the Hilla branch of the Euphrates has silted up so much that, in order to make use of it, a second barrage will have to be built above the existing dam, a new channel will have to be dug, and silt clearing will have to be done in the Hilla branch. Sir William has represented that the work is very urgent, and has asked that it should be taken in hand at once, on the understanding that, should it be decided later on to give the work on contract, the contractor should take over the work already done at cost price. The drawings for all these works are complete, but they have not yet been copied. If I can obtain copies I will send them to the Board of Irade as soon as possible. Sir William’s proposals for dealing with the extra 1,000 cubic metres a second that used to be taken by the Saklawiya Canal, are still being prepared, and it is roughly estimated that they will cost something under £ T. 100,000. 2. I enclose a copy of the estimates for seven works, amounting to £ T. 312,000. 3. The amount of manufactured articles that will be required from Europe are approximately:— 20,000 barrels of cement. 70 tons rolled beams. 80 tons cast-iron grooves. 50 tons wrought-iron lock gates. 3,000/. worth of pumps and pumping engines. I have, &amp;c. J. RAMSAY, Lieutenant-Co Ion el, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Bagdad. P.S.—I am sending a copy of this letter to the Board of Trade by this post, together with ground plans and drawings of the works proposed. The ground plans and drawing can be shown, confidentially, to firms of established repute, but they should on no account be published, as they are only being sent to the Turkish Government by this post.

Mr. Willards to Mr. R. Graham.—(Communicated by Mr. R. Graham., March 22.) Dear Graham, Bagdad, February 14, 1909. THE inclosed may interest you. I find travelling over the country that the development of this country will come much more quickly than I had expected. We have 16,000,000 acres here, of which 6,000,000 acres can be irrigated like Egypt with the water available, while the remaining 10,000,000 acres can be irrigated as pastures and produce millions of sheep. The pasture land needs only flooding, and that will be done readily the day we have weirs. I am acting on Sir Eldon’s advice (though at first I did not think I could or should), and am designing economical works to begin the development straight away. The irrigation of the 10,000,000 acres of pasture land (which I had not at first thought of) has given a new direction to my project. I hope to travel via Aleppo, Adana, and Konieh, to Constantinople, 20th April to 20th May, and then Egypt, when 1 hope to meet you. Yours sincerely, C&lt;rC'K*o (Signed) w! WILLAR-BS. Inclosure in No. 1. Letter addressed to Mr. R. Graham respecting Babylonia. (Private.) I HAVE been very carefully examining the country between Samarra and Babylon (Hilla), part Bagdad et Ctesiphon, and have had a special opportunity, owing to the fact that I am spending 30,000/. on the repairs of the Hendia Barrage, and the first thing that strikes me is the fact that all possibilities of the real development of this country depend as much on a railway direct from Bagdad to the nearest port on the Mediterranean as on irrigation. The best route is Bagdad, Hit, Anab, Der, Aleppo, Alexandretta—and the next best is Bagdad, Hit, Anab, Der, Palmyra, Damascus, Beirout. These are the two real trade routes of the country. Both are under 600 miles. Nearly everything we produce goes to Europe, and very much of it to the Eastern Mediterranean countries. What we chiefly want are European goods and cheap coal. This is a country strongly devoid of fuel, and we pay for coal in Bagdad 3/. 155 . per ton by the time it has gone through the Suez Canal to Bussorah and come up to 520 miles of the Tigris. Now, if we had a railway direct from the Mediterranean we should have coal here as cheap, at any rate, as it is at Assouan, which is considerably more than 600 miles from Alexandria. The railway, moreover, which ran from Beirout or Alexandretta here would have cheap coal brought on the Mediterranean, and not dear stufi bought in Bussorah and Bagdad. The Euphrates Valley is very rich and can be irrigated, and is irrigated very cheaply by water power the whole way, as the current is strong enough to turn wheels and lift water. It is too strong for navigation. We here are a great grain-producing country with unlimited capabilities for extension, and the whole goes to the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe. What, however, has struck me more than anything, and I am preparing my projects accordingly, is the fact that the country is even more a sheep- and cattle- and horse-breeding country than a granary. We can irrigate with the supply at the rivers 6,000,000 acres, but we can irrigate in addition, as pastures, 10,000,000 acres on which millions of sheep and cattle could feed. All these would go west. In a year of drought like this sheep are worth a song, because they cannot be got out of the country (and droughts are common here). If we had a railway to the Mediterranean direct, the transport for sheep and cattle alone would occupy a line the whole winter, and then would come the harvest of wheat, barley, and winter cereals, and then the summer harvest of rice and Indian corn, all going west. 1 uinips for sheep feeding are grown over large areas, and could be grown over tens of thousands by irrigation the day we have weirs. The turnips are very fine, indeed the [2205 y—1]2 best I have seen, and as they are a winter crop here swedes and mangolds would do well. The 12 per cent, lime in the soil and water are excellent for all animals, and the animals of this country are in consequence very fine. All this needs an outlet on the Mediterranean. A railway from Bagdad to the Mediterranean would fill the country with visitors, who would see for themselves, bring money into this country and open it. If the Nile opened into that hole-and-corner place, the Persian Gulf, and not into the Mediterranean, and there was no railway connecting it with the Mediterranean, the value of the produce and the land of Egypt would fall over 100 per cent., if not 200 per cent. The more li think, study, consult local merchants, and understand the country, the more I am convinced that in a Euphrates Valley railway lies the development of the country. The Euphrates Valley can produce, and does produce, every kind of fruit to perfection, and the valley, compared with what it was fifty years ago, is already another world. To transport wheat from Bagdad to Bussorah costs 1/. 8s. per ton, and from Bussorah to London (including transhipping) l£. 2s. or 21. 10s. per ton. Put that on Argentine and Canadian wheat and you would strangle the trade. Mesopotamia could produce some 4,000,000 tons of wheat barley for export, and, without exaggerating, many millions of sheep, all for the West. English trade w ould benefit immensely, for English goods would come direct here instead of going round by Aden and Kurrachee and Bussorah, while the trains would take back all the things England needs. I say nothing of oil seeds, excellent beetroot for sugar, and cotton which we can produce They would be an additional asset. And all that is needed is under 600 miles of railway, the whole length 'of which very nearly is capable of being- cultivated, and in ancient days was cultivated and thickly populated.

'he object of the survey operations is to facilitate the preparations of the following; projects:- (1) To restore irrigation near Babylon and ”illa by send ing water down the old bed of the Euphrates. This can be done by the completion of the works at the lindiya oarrage, (;M 'o insure navigation between Basrah and Baghdad. (3) To restore the ancient irrigation round Baghdad, Ctesiphon, and Selucia by means or; tne Saklawie, Abu Gharaib and Bahrwan canals: and the protection of this irrigation against floods. (4) To restore the ancient irrigation round Basfrah. f 5 ) To restore the ancient irrigation on the Hai canal by means of a d&lt;t ross 4 - igris at Wut. The respective levels of the water in the Tigris and Euphrates are such that all these works oan be conveniently carried out. T. 'welve Engineers have been employed, of whom five are Entliahmen, each of whom gets £ 30 a month: which is far less than was expeeted. All the men are well trained and have only accepted such small pay because the work ie interesting and offers the possibility of a good career. All these Engineers are working in the fields. 3. Ofi arrival at Baghdad early in December it appeared desirable to divide the Engineers into three brigades of four each, but the Resident and British Consul General kindly gave me a copy of a map of the vg^ris between Baghdad and Basrah and he also lent me the 'Comet' on condition that I paid for the cost of fuel. I was thus able to make a minute inspection of the river and to start at work six brigades of two Engineers each. All the Engineers began to work between the 6 th6 th &amp;nd 15th December and the mx weather nas been very favonrable; consequently by the 15th January i shall have a olan of the Tigris from Baghdad to the sea, showing sections, levels, discharge, and all the details necessary for ^reoaring project So. P. mentioned in paragraph 1. Owing to the plan of the river givoitme by Colonel MM*, six Engineers have accomplished in one month work which, without the plan, would have required twelve Engineers working for three months. A great deal of work has thus been done. The three other brigades of Engineers have fixed benohr.arke on the Euphrates at ?eluja, at the intake of the Saklawie canal, at the Hindlye barrage and at Hilla. A benchmark has also been fixed on the Diehxw an nc ar 01 e s ipiion* 4 . Tents have been locally made. 5 . A house has been rented at Baghdad. 6 . 3 y means of the information furnished to me weekly by the various parties of Engineers I am able to direct the operations in the field by telegraph without losing a day of this extraordinarily good weather. -he schemes, in addition to that of improving the navi gation of the Tigris already mentioned, which we hope to prepare this winter are:- (1) A complete project for the lindiya canal.

WITH reference to your No. 327 of the 15th August and your No? 341 of the 24th August on the subject of the Hindid Barrage, I have the honour to report that on the recent arrival here of Mr. R. Money, Messrs. Pearsons’ engineer, I instructed the Chief Dragoman to introduce him to the new Minister of Public Works, who showed himself very favourably disposed. The present position of the matter is the following: The only other competitor is a German firm of Dusseldorf and Bremen. They, as well as Messrs. Pearsons, estimate that the work, if carried out on M. Cugnin’s plans, will cost nearly double the amount that the Turkish Government had set aside. Mr. Money informed the Minister that his firm, while unable to guarantee work done on the Drench plans, are prepared with plans of their own, drawn up after consulting Sir W. Willcocks, and estimated to cost considerably less than those of M. Cugnin. The Ministry of Public Works quite recognized that the latter’s plans must be considerably altered, and has telegraphed to Bagdad with a vie\t to his re-examining the site of the dam. The Minister was also thinking of inviting the German firm to tender on the basis of Messrs. Pearsons’ plan, and adjudicating between the two without calling for further tenders. In introducing Mr. Money to the Minister of Public Works, Mr. Pitzmaurice took an opportunity of discussing with his Excellency the general subject of irrigation in Mesopotamia and Sir W. Willcocks’ projects for such work. He gave the Minister copies of Sir William’s reports, after examining which his Excellency discussed the matter at the Council of Ministers, where it was decided, in principle, to employ Sir W. Willcocks, if possible, to report on and insist in the execution of irrigation projects in Mesopotamia. In response to a telegram of mine intimating the above to Sir W. Willcocks, the latter arrived here on the 10th instant, and entered at once into communication with the Minister of Public B orks, who, in the light of Sir William s condemnation of M. Cugnin’s plans, practically decided to abandon the latter, and requested Sir William to draw up a report for him on the whole question. In view of this change in the situation, Mr. Money has returned to England until Sir W. Willcocks and the Ministry of Public Works come to a definite decision as to the Hindid Barrage and, perhaps, other irrigation works in the Bagdad Vilayet. The Grand Vizier informed me yesterday that the Ottoman Government’s present intention is to employ Sir W. Willcocks in connection with the irrigation under a five years’ contract, but nothing has yet been signed to that effect. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) GERARD LOWTHER.

My official reports will have shown that M. Cugnin has been very friendly to me. When I asked him what he was going to do now, he said that he should return to France, as he had nothing to keep him here, but he said that he woidd stay on here if he could find any work to keep him employed. I fancy that he would like to stay on, so as to be on the spot if the Turkish Government decide to carry out his project for the Hindie barrage. He tells me that under the terms of his contract he is entitled to superintend the work if it is carried out in accordance with his project, but he says that he will raise objection if the Turks employ another engineer to carry out his plans. The official reason given him for his dismissal is that there may be delay in carrying out the project.

A\ ITH reference to yonr despatch No. 7G of the 25th ultimo respecting the Hindie barrage scheme, I have the honour to report that Mr. Money, Messrs. Pearson and Sons’ engineer, who arrived here on the 29th ultimo, was introduced to the Minister of Public Works and the other proper officials of that Department by one of the Dragomans of the Embassy, and had several interviews with them. Up to the 13th March, the last date announced, no other firm had put in a tender, apparently thinking, like Mr. Money and Sir W. Willcocks, avIio came here from Egypt for a few days, that the Turkish plans for the barrage were unworkable, especially in a climate like that of Bagdad, where ferro cement would not be durable. Both Mr. Money and Sir W. Will- cocks w r ere of opinion that a suitable barrage, together with the indispensable accompanying w r ork in the Hilla bed of the Euphrates, could be carried out at the same expense as that fixed for the Hindie barrage alone, according to the plans of the French engineer, and Mr. Money proposed to the Minister of Public Works to visit the spot and then submit plans. The Minister said that he could not definitely accept any proposal of the kind, but that he was thinking of publishing a notice extending by six months the period for tenders. Mr. Money arranged with his Excellency that this notice is not to appear in the newspapers until he has had time to consult Messrs. Pearson, and left for England for that purpose on the 22nd instant.

WITH reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, respecting the Suklawiya Canal between the Tigris and Euphrates, I am directed by the Board of Trade to say that they have seen Mr. Hyde, M.P., of Messrs. S. Pearson and Son, Limited, on several occasions recently with regard to their intention to send an engineer to the East. Mr. Hyde has informed them that they definitely propose to send a competent engineer to Constantinople in connection with the Hindie Barrage, and also to Bagdad in connection with the Suklawiya Canal. The Board were also informed by Mr. Hyde that, if the plans of the canal were available in London before the engineer started for the East, Messrs. Pearson and Son would be in a better position, with the help of their skilled staff, to ascertain the probable cost of the work involved. In these circumstances I am to suggest, should Sir E. Grey have no objection, that Mr. Ramsay at Bagdad should be informed by telegraph that Messrs. S. Pearson and Son, Limited, the well-known contractors, propose to make an investigation of the Suklawiya Canal scheme on the spot, and that they would be glad to know whether M. Cugnin has any objection to the firm seeing the plans which were forwarded in Mr. Ramsay’s despatch to the Foreign Office confidentially. Mr. Hyde has informed this Department that he would be quite willing, in the circumstances, to guarantee that they would make no use of the plans to the disadvantage of M. Cugnin. I am further to add that the Board have mentioned the matter of the construction of the proposed iron bridge across the Tigris at Bagdad to Mr. Hyde, which is referred to in Sir N. O’Conor’s despatch to Foreign Office of tim'd 4th ultimo, and that Mr. Hyde informed them that his engineer will look into this matter when at Bagdad, with a view to undertaking the construction of the bridge.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 118, dated the 19th October, 1907, I have the honour to submit a further Report on the Suklawiya Canal. 2. On or about the 21st October, 1907, M. Cugnin received intimation that his services were not at present required by the Turkish Government. He got these orders when he was at Kananiya, and as he is interested in the work that is going on there, he stayed to see how it was being done, and he made use of his time in further studying the question of a site for the head works of a future canal taking out of the Euphrates at or near Kananiya. He has drawn up a note on the subject illustrated with three plans, and I have now the honour to forward, for your Excellency’s information, a copy of the note and of the plans which M. Cugnin has had the kindness to give to me.* After reading the note, I think that there can he no doubt that the dam recently made will not last for long, and consequently the Turkish Government will again be forced to give attention to the question of controlling this part of the Euphrates. If the matter is neglected beyond a certain point, there is a danger that the Euphrates may permanently join the Tigris near Bagdad, and this would of course he a disaster of great magnitude for the country and the Government, and also for the Sanneyeh Department, which has valuable properties on the Hindiya Canal, which would then be dry. The position, therefore, seems to he that if the Turkish plan of entirely closing the waterway is successful, a valuable tract of land is kept out of cultivation, and if it fails Bagdad and all the country along the lower reaches of the Euphrates are in danger of being laid waste either bv floods or drought. ° 3 . 3. Several Turkish attempts to control the water of the Euphrates at this point have failed, and it seems probable that the latest attempt will also fail. Consequently, it seems just possible that the Turkish Government may realize that the matter is one that can only he satisfactorily settled by the grant of a concession to a powerful Company. Such a Company would be obliged to protect its canal—and at the same time Bagdad— from the floods of the Euphrates, and the Canal would not therefore be a real danger to Bagdad, but an insurance. At present it is not the personal interest of any capable and responsible person to see that the dams along the Euphrates and above Kananiya are kept in good repair. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) J.

M Cuenin mformsme that no formal specification (cahier des charges) has been me? knowledge 1111 ’ ^ n ° responsible firm would tender for the work without local 2. One of the most serious items of the cost of the barrage will be the cost of transporting the material to the site of the work, and on this subi'ect I ven- ture to offer a few remarks for Your Excellency’s consideration. It is esti mated that the weight of cement and metal will be 7,200 tons. If this were ail brought up the Tigris to Baghdad, it would probably cost not less than fifteen shillings a ton from Baghdad to the site of the barrage, or a total sum onwards from Baghdad of about £5,500. To this would have to be added the co^t of carnage, on ipachinery and other miscellaneous articles. 3. The information which reaches me about the passage of sailing yes^U between the Hindiya Barrage and Basrah leads me to believe that the Turn's steamers could get up to the site of the proposed work during about three nr four months m the year. The season of high water is during the late sprint and early summer, the time at which agricultural produce would probablv hf available as downward cargo. No survey has ever been made of the Euphrates smee it took to the channel of the Hindiya Canal, but in the absenceof anv detailed information I do not see any reason why it should cost more to take l steamer up the Euphrates to the site of the barrage than to bring it to Bae-h Euphr^t^oule! 116 CaSe ’ ^ W0Uld ° b5d0Usly be a lar S e saTin S b y using the A / s4. These remarks suggest that it might be as ■well if the following matter were considered either by Your Excellency or by Contractors who wish to tender for the work :— v- • First .—Would it not be a good thing to send the “ Comet ” up the Euphrates next spring to make a survey of the river ? ^ This could be done, as has recently been the case on the Tigris, without landing parties or putting up flags. Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co. could send an Agent to form his own opinions on the suitability of the Company’s steamers for use on the river. This would probably reduce insurance charges. Second.- Should not the Foreign Office try to persuade Mr. Lynch to be content to accept a rate on the Euphrates that would ensure him against loss by putting a steamer on that river ? Third .—Should not an attempt be made to get the Contractor permission to run a steamer on the Euphrates for the carriage of his material, and only downward cargo ? I understand that Lynch will soon have a spare steamer lying in Basrah. Fourth .—The question of this extra steamer is important, because unless an extra one is available, Lynch could probably not spare more than one of the three which he is allowed, and one steamer would probably take four or five years to do the work. 5. I enclose a copy of my letter, dated the 7th December 1907, to Baghdad Agent of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. the Dated Baghdad, the 7th December 1907. (Confidential). Frcm—M ajor J. Kamsay, C.I.E., Ofig. Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and Acting British Consul-General, Baghdad, To—A. W. M. Tod, Esq., Baghdad. You know that I am anxious to do what I can to get the contract for the Hindiya Barrage for a British firm. The scheme is estimated to require about 7,200 tons (weight) of cement and metal work, in addition to which there will be machinery and a mass of miscellaneous gear. It in clear therefore that the co&gt;t of transit wall form a serious item in the accounts. as There is no very definite information about the navigability of the Euphrates, it has never been surveyed, or even visited by a steam vessel, since it took its present course along the Hindiya Canal. From the information which reaches me I am inclined to think that a steamer could get up to the barrage for about three or four months of the year and that the chief difficulty will be in the Lamlun marshes: these are nothing new and have frequently been passed by steamers. . I can see no reason to suppose that it would cost more to take a steamer to Hindiya than to Baghdad, and if this opinion is approximately correct, there would obviously be a large saving if the Euphrates route was used for the material. If your firm is approached, it seems to me they can adopt one of two policies: First, they can calculate what it would cost to take the material via Baghdad and offer something a trifle more favourable to the Contractor : Second?t\&amp;j can calculate what their steamer would earn on the Tigris and j demand a rate which would be equally or slightly more profitable to themselves. The rate would obviously vary according to the policy adopted, but I hope the latt* r will commend itself to your Directors. The advantage of developing the country and of getting irrigation works undertaken by British firms are too obvious to need argument on my part. I therefore merely now write to ask you to consider the matter and collect such information as would enable your firm in London to discuss terms with any would-be Contractor. If I can obtain any more information about the navigability of the Euphrates, I will let you know. AI am desired to forward, for information.

O’Conor, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople. I have the honour to enclose for the information of Your Excellency a copy of a memorandum giving a brief outline of the proposals formulated by M. Cugnin for putting a dam across the Hindiya Canal. I am sending a copy2 of the memorandum, the contents of which are known to M. Cugnin, to th e Board of Trade, to the Government of India, and to the Inspector-General of Irrigation in Egypt. 2. The present scheme, which is estimated to cost £^140,000 is^not perhaps in itself sufficiently large to attract the richest and the most powerful firms. Your Excellency may however think that it is highly desirable that the first irrigation work of importance in Mesopotamia should he undertaken by a British firm rather than by a foreign one. I personally veuture to think that the matter is of sufficient importance from a political point of view to warrant my suggesting that special assurances of support should he given to any thoroughly respectable firm that is prepared to examine the scheme seriously. The contractor must he brought into touch with the Arabs along the Hindiya Canal and the Euphrates from Musayib to Gurna. Note on the proposed Rindiya Barrage. The Hindiya Canal was originally made to use the waters of the Euphrates river, but it has become so large that it takes the whole of the stream, except at the time of high floods. The old bed of the river is dry for many months of the year. 2. The Turkish Government has employed a Erench Engineer to prepare a scheme for putting a barrage across the Hindiya, with a view to dividing the water of the Euphrates between the Hindiya and the old bed of the river. 3 . The barrage, including a lock, is estimated to cost about £T. 1,40,000. The Engineer’s proposal is to make a dam in armed cement having twenty-three openings each 9*80 metres wide, connected by masonry piers each E20 metres wide. °It is estimated that the dam will require 3,800 tons of iron and 3,G00 tons of the best Portland cement. The openings in the dam are to be closed with gates of wood, which can be removed at will, so as to allow the waters of the flood to pass. 4. It is thought that the working seasons will be from July to the loth November and from the loth December to the 15th Eebruary. 5. The idea of the Engineer in Charge is to have the work given on con tract to a reliable firm, who will undertake the whole thing for a fixed sum. 6. It is estimated that it will take three years to complete the work. 7. The materials will have to be of the very best, and the Portland cement used will be submitted by the Engineer to severe tests. 8. Any mechanical power that is used will probably have to be provided by oil motors as there is neither coal nor wood available for fuel. 9. The formal specifications for the contract have not yet been drawn up. 10. The Engineer’s scheme has not yet received the final approval oi the Central authorities at Constantinople, and the Turkish Government is notoriously dilatory in carrying out improvements. 1 think however that this scheme is likely to be carried out before long, and for the following ) reasons. Eirst, the Turkish Government has employed a foreign Engineer for the purpose. Second, a sum of £T. 1,00,000 has beenF^lodged with the Ottoman Bank in order that funds may be readily ava^ible. Third, the Turkish Government is suffering heavy annual loss on account of the old bed of the river having run dry, and if water is not soon provided for the date gardens along the old bed of the river they will cease to exist. lourth, the local landowners ore continually bringing their urgent need of water to the attention of the authorities. Eifth, the present Vali of Baghdad is in fa\our of irrigation schemes. 11. The contractor will certainly have many difficulties because (1) there is practically no local supply of skilled labour, (2) all imported materials will(W3) r have to be taken up the river which passes through the countrv of Arab tribes, over which the Turkish Government has only the most nominal control, (3) there are always difficulties in Turkey, but of such a nature that thev can generally be removed by “ bakhshish,” (4) the heat during the summer is very great, and it is intense in August and September, (o) there is no wood ^ivaila ole for fuel. On the other hand the firm which obtains this contract may obtain very valuable advantages, for it will obtain unique experience of the work in this countiy and will therefore be more likely to obtain future contracts. The nligation possibilities of the country are almost unlimited. 12 . The French Engineer would he glad to get into communication with any lirm of repute that is inclined to seriously consider the question of tender, ing for the contract. He does not know English, and would therefore prefer to he addressed iu French. His address is Monsieur Cugniu, Baghdad, Turkish Arabia. J.

I have seen the French Engineer since the Vali’s visit to the Hindiya Canal. lie thinks that the scheme for pumps is dead, as local opinion is in favour of a small temporary dam and canal.

Willcocks proceeded to Southern Mesopotamia, where he spent the winter in examining the districts between the Tigris and Euphrates in the vicinity of Bagdad, with a view to ascertaining what schemes' of 11 ligation would lie practicable m that region. “ Th ° l \ • t - ll ° . C01np J et . 1 / [ )n oi hls . studies Sir William compiled a pamphlet entitled The Iiugation ol Mesopotamia, which was printed in Egypt in April 1905 (A No C 306 of^he ml! 1 T 1 ^ tG ^ ? 0rei ^ 11 0ffiie in Sir O’Conor’s Ao. oOb ol the 1 Ah dune, 1905, q.v. for explanation of general lines of Sir William’s ^projects 4 and 9.) Although Sir William caused this paper to be marked “ Confidential and Private ” lie distributed copies with such freedom that the contents were soon made known to all persons (both British and foreign) interested in the matter. However, it would be as ' , Il0t( ' tl . iat k'r Williams brochure only contained general suggestions and calculations, and avoided entering into very precise details. In June 1905 Sir William visited Constantinople and asked his Excellency the ^ mbassadoi whether he would draw the attention of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan to the schemes 4 and 9 outlined in his pamphlet, saying that he hoped to be able to iorm a Company m London for the purpose of carrying them out, should the proposals meet with the approval of the Turkish Government. . ^r Nicholas O’Conor laid the general features of the two schemes before His nipeiial Majesty, who stated that he would be prepared to consider them when a Company had been formed and its terms made known to him. Sir W . YV illcocks then proceeded to London, but was unable to obtain sufficient c . arr - y 0l P ^i s schemes, and for a time the matter dropped. Althouo-h Sir \\ dhams projects excited considerable attention both in France and Germany winch resulted m various vague comments in the Continental press, no definite proposals were brought forward, though the Turkish authorities themselves dispatched a french Engineer (M. Cuny) to inspect the Hindie Barrage, and to examine the bed of the Euphrates, to find aid whether the river could be made navigable. Curiously enough both the navigability ol the Euphrates and the bad condition of the Hindie Ilarrage were touched on by Sir W. Willcocks in his pamphlet. It has been ascertained from a private source that M. Cuny submitted his reports to Sir W W illcocks for correction before sending them to the Turkish authorities. In October 1905 Sir \\. \\ illcocks formed in Egypt a Company, named the Anglo- ' J g} ptian Land Allotment Company, for the purpose of acquiring, improving, and reselling lands in Egypt and the Soudan, with a power of further interesting itself in works ol agricultural development in t lie neighbouring States, presumably the adjoinino- provinces of the Ottoman Empire. 1 he Directorate of this Company is composed almost &lt; ntiii 1\ of Egyptians, several ol whom are persons of Anglophobe tendencies in politics, and of slight importance financially. [1828 f-l] eneral §Sir W. Willcocks is at the present time engaged in endeavouring to secure a concession to work the two schemes already laid before His Imperial Majesty the Sultan. Sir \\ illiam says that he has obtained sufficient financial support to work these projects, and that the capital will be one-third German and two-thirds British, the composition of the British share, however, is doubtful, as it may comprise some of the capital of the Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment Company, although it is generally supposed that the bulk of this is already engaged in other schemes. Sir William desires to obtain his concession from the Civil List, which has large properties in the areas to be developed. Sir William stipulates that the payment for the improve ment of these properties should be made by free grants of derelict land, which he proposes his Company should reclaim, and sell at a profit to Ottoman subjects. Whether Sir Will iam will gain his object or no seems at present a matter of doubt, as there are reasons both for and against his success. The fact that Sir William is an Englishman militates strongly against his obtaining concessions in zones in such close proximity to the Persian Gulf, where British aims are viewed with undisguised suspicion. Sir William's connection with the Anglo-Egyptian Land Company counts against him, as the presence of wealthy Egyptians on its Board of Directors would cause apprehension in Constantinople. On the other hand, Sir William is dealing with the Civil List, a Department inclined to take a view less political and more practical as regards matters touching the development of its properties. Sir William is also prepared to make considerable concessions to the sentiment of the Turkish authorities by giving his Company a sympathetic name, which would make it appear as if it were under the supervision and direction of the Civil List, a line of conduct which may influence that Department in his favour. Much depends on the view the Turkish authorities take of the plan of remunerating Sir \\ illiam’s Company with grants of derelict but reclaimable land. It is possible that the economy of this method of repayment may commend itself to the Civil List Department, but it is obvious that unless the Company is bound down by very precise terms, the authorities will find it difficult to oblige the Company to sell the lands, should it find it more profitable to retain them, and the prospect of a foreign Company becoming the permanent owner of a large area is one which would fill any Ottoman official with alarm. If on the other hand the Civil List binds down the Company to sell the lands to Ottoman subjects within a given period, it is hard to see how the Company could prevent the Turkish Government from taking steps to make such sale impossible at a profit, with the object of buying the lands itself at a low price. However, these difficulties may be overcome by Sir William’s making such terms with the Civil List as would give him a tenure of the lands handed over to him, of sufficiently long- duration to enable Sir William’s Company to make a profit before compulsory sale. There is one other point of considerable importance as regards Sir William’s schemes in Mesopotamia, and that resolves itself into the question as to what will be the attitude adopted by the Bagdad Railway Company towards the development of Southern Mesopotamia by a Company in which the greater part of the capital is English. It will be generally admitted that, supposing Sir William succeeds in putting his schemes into operation, his Company will assume a position of far greater importance than the Bagdad Railway in Mesopotamia, as the railway would then sink into the comparatively insignificant position of transport agent to the Irrigation Company, upon which the whole internal prosperity of the country would depend. Now it may be presumed that the Bagdad Railway is only intended as a stepping-stone to greater things, a glance at its Convention is sufficient to demonstrate that that document is only a cloak which conceals under the name of a railway a multitude of equally important ventures, such as the exploitation of mining, forestry, river navigation, and petroleum deposits. The whole intention and purpose of German financiers and politicians is evidently to engross for themselves alone the whole wealth and industry of the Ottoman Empire by running a number of smaller Companies under the aegis of the Bagdad Railway. Now the advent of a British Irrigation Company in Mesopotamia, which would undertake neither to push German trade, subordinate itself to German interests, nor even attempt to spread German influence, would be in the highest degree repugnant to those who are at present interested in the Bagdad Railway. It would seem more than probable that, unless the German financiers could obtain a representa tion on the Board of Directors of Sir William’s proposed Company sufficiently strong to make it their tool, they would strain every nerve to frustrate its designs. The only legal weapon of which the Bagdad Railway Company could make use to interfere with Sir William’s schemes is Article 0 of the Bagdad Railway Convention,o O o.n&lt;l altliougli it is obvious that tlie Article only refers to rights of quarryin 0 ', yet the vagueness of the word “ fitablissement ” is such that with a little good-will the Article m question could be made to mean almost anything the Directorate of the Bagdad Kailway Company wished.

Willeocks’ proposals for the irrigation of Mesopotamia, I informed your Lordship that I laid the general features of Sir W ilham’s schemes before His Imperial Majesty, who seemed to appreciate fullv the importance of the suggestions, hut stated that so large an undertaking required considerable capital, involving the formation of a Company, and that he would not be able to judge whether the scheme promised to be advantageous to the State until th conditions and terms proposed by the Company were made known to him. At the time Sir William Willcocks was extremely sanguine as to the possibility oi raising the capital in London, and expressed himself ‘confident that he would have no difficulty in doing so. He subsequently left Constantinople with the intention of conferring with London financiers, having in view the raising of a Company to carry out his schemes, and, bv my advice, he called at the Foreign Office before doing so. However, as far as I can judge, the capitalists in the citv, when he approached them, did not seem inclined to fall in with his proposals, as they suggested that he would obtain more encouragement, both official and financial, at Berlin. Apparently Sir William intends submitting his project to the Deutsche Bank and other German financiers, and is going to Berlin for the purpose of startin- negotiations. Should Sir &gt;V ilham’s attempt prove successful, and if lie succeeds in interesting German groups in his undertaking, any observations His Majesty’s Government may make on the subject to the Turkish Government will probably meet with the reply that they had waited for the terms and conditions which the Sultan had asked for before giving his opinion as to the feasibility of the project, and that, as they had not been forthcoming from British groups, the Turkish Government was at liberty to consider other proposals. In view of this happening, I think it well to put on record the present position of a project which, if it took a practical turn, would materially affect our interest in those regions.

II.—Appendix giving the History of the Scheme to the end of 1904. SECRET. 47 B. 2, Whitehall Gardens, January 26, 1905.7 he Baghdad Railway. THE General Staff, in w, Memorandum of the loth November, 1904 (45 B), has noted the military aspects of the Convention of 1902 (section 3), and has pointed out the disadvantages, political, commercial, and strategic, which the control by Germany of a line to the Persian Gulf would entail upon Great Britain (sections 7 to 9). 2. 1 he history of the proceedings in regard to this railway down to the end of 1904 is summarized below (see Appendix), and it will be seen that the line has now reached Eregli. Further progress depends upon the arrangement of a kilometric guarantee embracing the next two sections, which prolong the line through the Taurus range as far as Tell-Habesh. The crossing of the Taurus is estimated to involve about 100 miles of blasting and tunnelling. 3. Under the Convention, the German Anatolian Railway can be extended to the Persian Gulf, and Article 29 provides that no section of the line between Baghdad and Bussorah may he worked before the completion of the portion between Konia and Baghdad. This provision was intended to prevent the construction of a British line from the Gulf to Baghdad, which is now possible only as part of the German scheme, or on condition of the grant by Turkey of a separate concession to this country. 4. When British co-operation was sought, on terms which could not be granted, political considerations were probably in the ascendant. The German Government was apparently anxious not to stand alone in the prosecution of a scheme which Russia viewed with dislike, and British support was, therefore, desired in view of eventualities. Now that the war in the Far East has disclosed inefficiency throughout the Russian army, and will probably have the effect of curbing Russian activities for some years^ the desire for British co-operation in the Baghdad Railway scheme from the purely political point of view only, may be somewhat abated. f). The main question at the present moment is whether the German Government can secure sufficient financial support to complete the railway to the Gulf, even if the Turkish customs duties are not raised sufficiently to serve as a security for the kilometric guarantees. In other words, can Germany complete the line without British co operation ? 6. The financial arrangements made by the German promoters of the railway with the Turkish Government are somewhat remarkable. That Government is to issue its own bonds at the rate of 10,700/. per kilom. (equivalent to 17,186/. per mile), in respect to each section of 200 kilom. Such bonds are to bear interest at 4 per cent., with a sinking fund providing for their redemption during the period (99 years) of the concession. They are to be secured by the particular section of the line in regard to which they are issued, and in addition by such other special security as may be agreed upon between the Railway Company and the Government. Thus, in the case of the Konia-Eregli section, the special security—up to the value of £ T. 36,000—is an assignment of the tithes in certain cases of the Vilayets of Baghdad, Aidin, Mosul, and Diarbekr. As the total annual amount so hypothecated is 50,000/., the margin of security is ample. In a letter to Mr Townley of the 26th November, 1904, Vice- Consul Townsend states that the Company is only spending about 50 per cent, of the guarantee, and is thus getting 9 or 10 per cent, interest on its actual outlay. As a single 5 ft. 6 in. gauge line in India costs about 10,000/. per mile, this statement is probable correct. The expenditure on the Taurus section will, however, be largely in excess of the average. [139] B7. It appears, therefore, that bondholders are fully secured in so far as Turkish credit is to be trusted, and that the raising of the customs dues is required m order to provide an ultimate guarantee by the hypothecation of a definite bianch o m .is revenue over which foreign creditors might hope to exercise some contiol. \ 8. From the Turkish point of view, the arrangement seems to leave much to be desired. There is nothing to prevent undue expenditure upon railway plant in the interests of the German producer. In other words, Turkey is saddled with the responsibility for providing interest upon money the expenditure of which lies outside her control, and which might be saved by due regard to economy. At the same time there is a curious provision that if there is a defalcation in the special security allotted to any section of the line (as, for example, that referred to in paragraph 6), the ^ompany can foreclose upon the section in question. On the other hand, the Convention a ows the Turkish Government to redeem its indebtedness to the bondholders by stipulated cash payments. As that Government rarely has cash at its disposal, this pio\ision can only be regarded as a practically valueless set-off to the arrangement ena ding e Company to assume possession of the line in certain ciicumstances. 9. The Turkish Minister of Public Works is to receive a monthly statement of the receipts of the railway. If the gross receipts exceed 4,500 fr.^ per kiW, but not 10,000 fr., the excess over 4,500 fr. is to be handed over to the Turkish Government, If the gross receipts exceed 10,000 fr. per kilom., the excess over this figure will be divided between the Turkish Government and the Railway Company in the proportion of 60 to 40 per cent. The scrutiny of the railway accounts will require to be exceedingly severe if the above provisions ever become operative. 10. The Turkish Government bonds will be replaced by Company bonds when the financial situation permits. 11. The general arrangements are such that while the railway is nominally an undertaking financed by the Turkish Government, the powers wielded by the Company will be very large, and are certainly capable of being exercised in various ways not immediately apparent in the letter of the Convention. If the security of the iurkish Government were equal to that of France or Germany, the whole of the necessary capital would doubtless be immediately available, and the construction of the line could proceed to completion without hindrance. 12. The only present obstacles are the uncertainties of Turkish credit, and the political considerations, arising from the susceptibilities of Russia, which appear to have been partly instrumental in inducing Germany to seek British co-operation As pointed out in paragraph 4, these considerations may now possibly have less weight in certain directions than at the time when His Majesty’s Government was originally approached. 13. The life of the present Sultan is not likely to be prolonged. The Germans are well aware that the exceptional position they have succeeded in obtaining at Constantinople will probably not endure after the disappearance ot Abdul Hamid. They have, therefore, strong inducement to take full advantage of the Convention before any change occurs, and they wish, on political grounds, to secure our co-operation before any change takes place. 14. As matters stand, it would be unwise to assume that money will not be found to finance the whole line, if the support of the German Emperor is forthcoming on behalf of a project which is evidently regarded as important lor the furtherance o German policy. On the other hand, it is probable that the German Government wou | be reluctant to press the project upon capitalists and investors, as such action won have the effect of drawing attention to German motives. 15. It seems clear that our position at the head of the Persian Gulf provides no means of obstructing the progress of the railway, if the requisite capital is available. Koweit is not essential as a terminus, as other suitable harbours, directly un er Turkish control, exist; but it offers special political advantages as implying the countenance of the Naval Powers at present paramount m these waters There will apparently be no scope for diplomatic action at Constantinople until the death or deposition of the present Sultan.16. We are, therefore, confronted with a project which, if carried out under German auspices, will undoubtedly inflict grave injury upon our commerce, and must ultimately destroy our political influence in Southern Persia and in the deltas of the Tigris and the Euphrates. We have the strongest grounds for preventing the control of a railway from Baghdad to the Gulf from falling wholly under the control of a Power which regards its own interests exclusively and which well understands the manipu lation of railway rates. 17. The main obstacle to the completion ot the railway is financial. Already, as pointed out in paragraph 1, difficulties have arisen in regard to the kilometric guarantee for the two sections beyond Eregli. If these difficulties are now overcome, others of a similar nature will probably arise later, since the country to be traversed is for a long distance unproductive and inhabit ed by unruly tribes who would require to be controlled. The prolongation of the line through this country could be justified on economic grounds only if the section from Baghdad to the Gulf is certain to he completed. It is from the profits which this section may be expecte 1 to secure that the loss on the non-paying portions of the line must, in great measure, be recouped. 18. It would be unwise to minimize the financial difficulties with which the German Company is confronted, or to assume that the line cannot be completed without British assistance. There seems, however, to be a probability that we shall again be approached with a view to securing our co-operation, and it appears essential, therefore, t at we should consider the conditions on which such co-operation might be practicable. 19. A railway connecting two seas must usually be an advantage to this country, whatever may be its status and ownership. In the present case, however, Britis interests require— (a.) That freight rates discriminating against British goods shall be impossible ; and (b.) That our political influence in Southern Persia and the delta ot the ngris and Euphrates shall not suffer at the hands of a foreign Railway Company controlling com munication between the Gulf and Baghdad, and consequently able to undertake the irrigation works, by the agency of which a great development of the region of the lowei Tigris and the Euphrates can be brought about. 20 Under Article 9 of the Convention, it is provided that the Railway Company is to have a monopoly of the provision of the materials required for the line, and is to be granted the privilege of transporting itsagentsand workmen on the waterways of the Shatt-el-Arab, the Tigris, and the Euphrates. This privilege is to last only during the period of construction,” and is to be “ under the surveillance of the Minister ot Marine. It is however, extremely doubtful whether the use of steamers, river wharves, bin mgs, improvements in navigation, &amp;c„ made at considerable expense for the purposes of rail way construction, would suddenly lapse when the line was completed. 21. The Sultan is already taking part in water transport on tbe Tigm. and ^us steamers, the management of which has greatly improved compete mth ^ means permitted to the British firm of Lynch her ^. J h . e X a y that water transportation, with any developments aus , whose private purse construction, may tend to pass largely to the contro of the ^ an &gt; would benefit. If this view is correct, an attempt to dev p g hands as a scheme competing with a German railway would pioba&gt;l&gt; fa . 22.

From information I have received, there appears to be no doubt that the German Foreign Office stands behind the Railway Company, and that the idea of a line to the Persian Gulf under full German control is cherished at Berlin. If, however, financial difficulties dictate a further attempt to secure British co-operation, private agencies will doubtless be employed for the purpose. 25. In this case I believe that our best policy would be to sound the French Government with a view to ascertain whether they would be prepared to co-operate in the scheme. Isolated co-operation on our part would probably be turned to political account at Berlin as a means of weakening the Anglo-French “ entente.” 26. Summing up the considerations above set forth, I submit the following general conclusions, viz. :— (i.) It is vital to British interests that the railway should not be completed to the Persian Gulf under German auspices alone. (ii.) Existing international conditions render it probable that the Germans may desire to hasten the progress of the railway. Financial considerations will apparently induce them again to seek British co-operation. In this case, it should be our policy to co-operate if sufficiently favourable terms can be secured. (iii.) British interests require the fulfilment of the conditions laid down in section 22. (iv.) Political conditions appear to demand that we should, if possible, go hand in hand with France, or at least that we should not conclude a separate agreement with Germany until we have approached the French Government. (Signed) G. S. CLARKE. January 26, 1905.APPENDIX. History of the Baghdad Railway Scheme to the end of 1904. THE first attempt to open up Asia Minor from Constantinople by railways was made in 1871, when the Turkish Government constructed a line from Haidar’Pasha to the head of Ismid Bay, on the Asiatic shore of the Sea of Marmora. This line was leased in 1880 to a British Company on a twenty years’ lease, the Turkish Government reserving to itself the right of determining the lease at any moment subject to the payment of compensation. In 1888 two Imperial trades were issued, the first conveying to the nominee of the Deutsche Bank the right ol working this line, and the second granting a ninety-nine years concession for the extension of the line to Angora, with a kilometric guarantee by the Turkish Government of 10,300 fr. for the original line and 15,000 fr. for the extension. The extension to Angora was completed in 1892. At this time the only two other railway lines of any importance in Asia Minor were the English Smyrna-Aidin Railway, for which a concession had been granted in 1850, and the Smyrna-Kassaba Railway, which was also at that time in the hands of an English Company, under a concession granted in 1863. In 1893 another Imperial Irade granted to the German Company two further concessions, one for the construction of a branch line from Eski-Shehir to Konia, and another for the extension of the Angora line to Kaisarieh, with the right to prolong it eventually through Sivas to Diarbekr and down through the valley of the Tigris to Baghdad. The latter concession was abandoned, ostensibly because a careful survey of the country between Angora and Kaisarieh revealed physical difficulties which would render the cost of construction prohibitive, but really it is believed in deference to Russian opposition to the scheme. In 1893 the Turkish Government bought back the Smyrna-Kassaba Railway from the English Company, and immediately transferred it to a French Company, which extended the line to Afium Kara Ilissar. The German line to Konia, which was completed in ] 896, passes through this place, and, had the French line been allowed to make a junction with it, much of the traffic of the latter line would have been deflected to Smyrna. The Ottoman Company of the Anatolian railways, supported by the Turkish Government, however, refused to allow this junction to be made, and eventually the French line was forced to accept the terms offered by the German Company, and passed practically under the control of the Anatolian Railway Company. No sooner was this arrangement effected than the Porte reversed its former decision and allowed the junction to be made. The British Smyrna-Aidin Railway is now 7 the only one in Asia Minor which remains outside the control of the Anatolian Railway Company. German influence at Constantinople has successfully defeated all the efforts of the former Company to penetrate further into the interior of Asia Minor, although no kilometric guarantee from the Turkish Government w r as asked for. In 1899 the Porte formally conceded to the German Anatolian Company the right to extend their railway to the Persian Gulf from Konia, instead of by Sivas and Diarbekir, as originally arranged under the concession of 1893; and on the 16th January, 1902, an Imperial Iradd w 7 as issued approving the final Convention. As a counterpoise to the development of German enterprise in Asia Minor, Russian diplomacy exacted from the Porte, in 1900, an undertaking known as the “ Black Sea Basin Agreement,” under which Russia is granted priority of rights in respect of railway construction throughout the Asiatic provinces of Turkey which drain the Black Sea. Germany’s favourable position in Turkey r is dependent to a great extent on the [139] D8 good-will of the reigning Sultan. The Liberal party in Turkey views with alarm the preponderance of German influence at Constantinople, and, when opportunity occurs, its energies will no doubt he directed towards the frustration of German schemes. A further menace to the security of Germany’s position lies in the jealousy with which the Baghdad Bail way project is viewed by Russia. And, finally, as the construction of the railway progresses, the kilometric guarantee will bring such a heavy burden on Turkey that, unless she is permitted to raise additional revenue by increasing the duties on foreign imports, she may default. For these reasons Germany is anxious, without sacrificing the control which she holds over the Baghdad Railway, to enlist as many foreign interests as possible in support of the undertaking. With this object in view, negotiations were carried on in Constantinople through out 1902, which resulted in the creation of the Imperial Ottoman Baghdad Railway Company, under a Convention signed at Constantinople on the 5th March, 1903, between the Deutsche Bank and the Turkish Government. Under the Convention the route of the line will be from Konia to Eregli, and thence across the Taurus and Giaour mountains to the valley of the Euphrates. After leaving the mountains the line will he carried in a straight line across the desert between the Euphrates and Tigris to Mosul. Erom Mosul the line will run down the right bank of the Tigris to Baghdad, passing through a desolate country covered with a network of swamps. From Baghdad the line will run due south to the Euphrates, and, after crossing that river, the route will be along its right bank to Bussorah, the chief port of the Shat-el-Arab. Thence it will eventually be extended to a terminus on the Persian Gulf which is yet to be decided on. Provision is made under the Convention that the whole line to the Persian Gulf and its branches should be completed within eight years from the date of the Concession, subject to the punctual fulfilment by the Ottoman Government of its financial obligations towards the concessionnaire, and to delays arising from force majeure, which expression includes, in addition to war between European Powers, any radical change in the financial situation of Germany, England, or France. The Turkish Government guarantees a two-fold kilometric annuity, one of 11,000 fr. for each kilom. built and opened to traffic, and one of 4,500 fr. towards working expenses. Under Article 20 of the Statutes of the Imperial Ottoman Baghdad Railway the Council of Administration of the Company is invested with the widest powers for administering the property and affairs of the Company. It was in virtue of these powers that the Germans, being in sole control, were able to negotiate abroad and to make proposals for British and French co-operation in the undertaking. To put the control of the Railway on an ostensibly international basis, the Germans agreed that the participations in the capital of the Baghdad Railway Company should be in the following proportions :— Per cent. The Anatolian Railway Company .. .. .. .. 10 „ French group .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 25 „ German „ .. .. .. .. ,. .. .. 25 „ English „ .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 25 „ other countries—Austria, Switzerland, &amp;c. .. .. .. .. 15 A conditional assurance was also given to the effect that the Anatolian line should be brought under international control upon a similar basis as the control of the Baghdad Railway. From France financial support only was asked for. As French participation was closely connected with a project for a unification of the Ottoman debt, the bulk of which is held in France, the scheme was favoured by stock exchange interests in Paris. The French Government, however, gave the project no support, and finally declined to sanction tne participation of the French group, and even refused to allow their shares to be quoted on the Paris Bourse. Such French support as has been accorded is therefeore purely financial and unofficial, and the position of the French group is so markedly inferior to that of the Germans that it is considered improbable that the French public will be induced to subscribe on a large scale to the undertaking. British co-operation, however, was, and is, far more important to Germany. It was as much British political as financial support that was sought for ; although, incarrying on the negotiations, the Germans gave prominence to the business and financial side ot the transaction. British financial houses were unable to give their support to the undertaking without an assurance of the support of their Government, the granting of which was dependent on ^ adequate provision being made for safeguarding what were regarded as the chief British interests concerned. The Germans were prepared to make such provision only subject to certain con ations, the most important of which were that the British 'Government should give assurances : (1) that they would not object to a reasonable increase of the Turkish customs duties, of which a part should be used in guaranteeing the Baghdad Railway; (2) that if the Baghdad Railway should prove to be a substantially better route for the conveyance of mails to India, it should be so used on terms to be agreed on later; and (3) that Great Britain should lend her good offices in providing a proper terminus on the Persian Gulf at or near Koweit. These assurances the British Government were unable to give, and the negotiations fell through. The Germans pretended that the abstention of the British group was of no consequence, and that adequate financial anangements had been made for proceeding with the construction of the line without British assistance. In point of fact the section onward from Konia has now been completed to Eregli, and the payment of the kilometric guarantee has been duly arranged for. The real difficulties of the undertaking will come when the next section is taken in hand. After leaving Eregli, the Taurus range, which separates the Anatolian plateau from the plains of Adana and the Giaus Dagh, separating that plain from the basin of the Tigris and Euphrates, will have to be crossed. These sections—from Eregli to Adana and from Adana to Tell-Habesh—will prove difficult and costly, as they will involve nearly 100 miles of blasting and tunnelling. The Turkish Government have expressed their willingness to give the guarantee for the next section of 200 kilom. which would bring the railway across the Taurus Mountains, but the Company is endeavouring to secure the guarantee for two sections (400 kilom.) together, in order that they may recoup themselves on the level plain for the great expense which would be incurred in the construction of the Eregli-Adana section. To this arrangement the Turkish Government has refused to consent, and there is thus, for the moment, a financial deadlock. PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY J. W.

PrlJ', Wfj/irT EFFECT OF THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY ON OUR RELATIONS WITH PERSIA AND ON THE DEFENCE OF INDIA. Memorandum by General Staff, War Office, November 16, 1904.Memorandum by General Staff. THE Prime Minister has asked for the opinion of the General Staff regarding the effect the construction of the Baghdad Railway would have on our relations with I ersia and on the defence of India, assuming:— (fl.) I hat we share or assist in the construction of the railway. (6.) That we stand aloof. \\ ith respect to (b) an opinion is also required as to the practicability of any counter-nioasui es w e could take, such as the improvement of the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, or the construction of a raiiwav from the Persian Gulf to Baghdad. 2. The Baghdad Railway Company, under the title of the “ Societe Imperiale Ottomaine du Chemin de Per de Baghdad,” was formed at Constantinople in April 1903, with a nominal capital of 15,000,000 fr., of which 10 per cent, was to be held bv the lurkish Government, 10 per cent, by the Anatolian Railway Company (the owners of the railway from Scutari to Ronia), and the remainder to be divided between German, Trench, Austrian, Swiss, Italian, and Turkish financiers, but in what proportion was not stated, nor do we know whether the 10 per cent, was taken up by the Turkish Government. 3. From a military point of view, the chief points of interest in the Convention regarding the railway are: — (a.) The concession is for 99 years for each section of the line from the date of issue of State bonds, and the original concession to the Anatolian Raiiwav Company is extended to run for the same period. (b.) The line to be constructed in sections of approximately 200 kilom. each* The first section (Konia-Eregli) to be completed within two, and the whole line within eight, years, subject to delays caused by non-payment of kilometric guarantees, or to the occurrence of a state of war, or to any radical change in the financial situation of the proposed participants in financing the scheme. (c.) The line to be of 4 ft. 8J in. gauge, and to be single in the first instance, but to be doubled later, when the undertaking pays. (d.) Should connection with the Syrian Coast be established between the line and a point between Mersina and Tripoli, the Company has the refusal of construction. (e.) Five years after the opening of each section the executive staff, with the exception of the superior employes, to be Ottoman subjects. (/.) The Company has the right to establish ports at Baghdad, Basra, and the terminus on the Persian Gulf. (g.) The Ottoman Government has the right to erect entrenchments and defensive works at any point it may think fit on the main line or its branches. The Company to defray the cost, within limits, of the establish ments of military posts considered necessary by the Ottoman Minister of War. (h.) No section of the line between Baghdad and Basra to be worked before the completion of the line from Konia to Baghdad. 4. A loan of 54,000,000 fr. having been negotiated, work on the first section to Eregli was completed in October last. Apparently it is intended to proceed with the next section as soon as possible, and there is no reason to suppose that if we stood aloof the eventual completion of the line would be prevented, though it might be delayed. [1465] B5. No place on the Persian Gulf is specified in the Convention as the terminus of the line, and nothing has yet been decided in this respect. Koweit, Um Kasr, and Kadima have been mentioned, and of these the two former appear to be the most fa\ ourably situated. A British officer who last year reconnoitred the route the railway will follow reported that Um Kasr was preferable to Koweit, and other information tends to show that if we prevented Koweit from becoming the terminus, Um Kasr, v now occupied by the Turks, would be selected. The facilities offered by the two^* places respectively as a terminus and for the establishment of a naval base are described in the “ Memorandum on the Persian Gulf ” prepared by the Naval Intelligence Department, and dated the 4th March, 1904. (&gt;. If we participate in the further construction of the railway, and can obtain a share equal to that of any other Power in respect of construction and management, more especially of that portion of the line extending from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf, with a preponderating influence as regards the control of the terminus, the rail way would not, as far as can be foreseen, exercise any detrimental effect, from a military point of view, either on our relations with Persia or on the defence of India. 7. If we do not participate in the scheme, we must expect to see a diminution in those political rights and commercial interests which we have in the past two centuries secured in the valley of the Tigris and Shatt-el-Arab, and on the Persian and Arabian shores of the (iiilf. It must also he remembered that the country between the Tigris and Euphrates was once the most fertile district in the world, and there is no reason why its former prosperity should not return. Moreover, the terminus on the Gulf, being the point of distribution and transhipment, will eventually become a great focus of trade, and therefore of great strategical value, and as it is doubtful whether Turkey will be able to give the commercial and military security which the situation will require, the duty of controlling the terminus may, of necessity, devolve in course of time on one of the other Powers. 8. Should this control devolve on Germany, as the principal participant, she might, taking advantage of Turkey’s alleged inability to give the requisite security, and, by a skilful twisting of the conditions mentioned in (g) of paragraph 3 above, succeed in gradually converting the port into a naval base, notwithstanding promises and agreements to the contrary. We know that she cannot carry out her scheme of expansion without the possession of naval ports on her lines of communications, and at present she has none outside Europe with the exception of Kiaochou. This disadvantage would be seriously felt by her in a war with France or England, and it would clearly be diminished by the establishment of a naval base in the Persian Gulf, although the north-western extremity of the Gulf might not be an ideal position. Such a base, com bined with the use of the railway leading to it, would furnish Germany with more rapid means of communication with her Colonies in the Pacific and East Africa, and with Kiaochou, and would enable her to keep a fleet in eastern waters, independent of the Mediterranean route, for protecting her maritime trade and for attacking that of the enemy. Should she not enjoy the free use of the railway, the naval base would be of loss value to her, but its existence would nevertheless he incompatible with our predominance in the Gulf. 9. It would also place her on the flank of our communications via Suez with India, and if in a war between England and Russia she were found, directly or indirectly, on the side of Russia our difficulty of reinforcing the Indian garrison, which s a rtady a seriou s one, would be rendered still greater. If the above arguments are sound it follows that we ought, if possible, to keep the control of the Gulf terminus in our own hands. (Note. —These observations on the value to Germany of a naval base in the Gulf are made with some diffidence, as the question is primarily one for Admiralty consideration.) 10. With regard to measures which we might take in the event of our standing aloof, in order to counteract the effect of the railway, it may be noted that most of the inland trade from the northern end of the Persian Gulf is water-borne. Navigation for ocean steamers up the Shatt-el-Arab is fairly easy, but at the mouth there is a mud bar, limiting the draft of steamers ordinarily to 14 feet. At low tide there is only about 7 feet. At high tide vessels drawing 16-18 feet have to discharge a portionof their cargo before entering the river. Between Basra and Baghdad the arbitrary restrictions of the Turkish Government reduce traffic to a minimum. The English firm of Lynch Brothers are allowed to employ only two steamers at a time, a third being kept laid up at Basra is case of accidents. These steamers draw about 4 feet ^^f water, and are not allowed to ascend beyond Baghdad. The time taken between ^^Basra and Baghdad is from 78 to 100 hours and about 4/ hours on the return journey. Owing to the neglect of dredging operations the navigation is becoming increasingly difficult. 11. On the Tigris, rafts are utilized going down-stream from Diarbekr to Baghdad. Ihe current at its fastest runs 4 miles an hour. Below Mosul there are rapids. The Euphrates, judging from recent reports, is navigable only at certain seasons, owing to the remains of ancient dams and obstructions. In the flood season it could be ascended by light-draught powerful boats. Much could, perhaps, be done to enhance the value ol these waterways by improving the means of navigation and causing the restrictions against British trade to be withdrawn, but they would nevertheless, in course of time, probably prove unable to cope with the facilities afforded by the projected railway. 12. So far as topographical features are concerned the principal obstacles to the building of a British railway from the Gulf to Baghdad would be due to the adjacent marshes, and these could apparently be avoided by a proper system of river con servancy. The main difficulty would lie in obtaining the necessary permission from the Sultan, and now that his assistance is practically pledged' to Germany, the permission w r ould be still more difficult to obtain. Eurther, as the British railway would presumably start from Koweit, the distance between the Gulf port and Baghdad would be some 50 miles greater than between Baghdad and Um Kasr, the probable port of the rival line, and the shorter line would no doubt secure the greater part of the trade. 13. In fact, no effective counteraction on our part appears to be feasible, either in respect to the improvement of the waterways or the construction of railways ; and even if such action were feasible w r e should, by standing aloof from the international scheme, still incur the risk of seeing another Power, perhaps Germany, acquire a strong, if not predominating, naval position in the Gulf.

EARLY last autumn Sir William Willcocks passed through Constantinople on his way to Bagdad, and spent the winter in studying a scheme of irrigation of Mesopotamia between the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, a summary of which by Mr. Mark Sykes, taken from the pamphlet which he has published (of which I inclose a copy), is sent herewith. Lnfortunately Sir William communicated the result of his studies and investi gations to some of the Consuls at Bagdad, as well as to other people, and sent a copy of his pamphlet to the Director of the Bagdad Railway, Dr. Zander, although I had impressed upon him the importance of not confiding the result of his studies to any one until we saw how the question shaped itself later on, and whether any British financial group would be willing to take up the matter. I have no doubt that both the German and French Consuls sent a report to their Governments embodying the plans and proposals of Sir William, and I heard a short time ago that a Frenchman had come out here in connection with a scheme of a similar kind, and was seeking for a concession from the Sidtan. I believe that the King of Italy has been also interested in the scheme, and that he is anxious to have full information, with a view to seeing what chances it offers for Italian enterprise in those parts. I had enjoined discretion upon Sir William Willcocks when I saw him last summer, but I am afraid this is a quality foreign to his character, and I know that he holds the opinion that he does not care in the least who carries out his plans provided they are executed, though he would be willing to give a preference to a British Syndicate. Finding the Sultan last Friday in a very gracious and conversational mood, I took the opportunity of enlisting His Majesty’s interest in the scheme, which I described as one for reclaiming the waste or marshy tracts of Lower Mesopotamia by means of a main canal from Faluga to Bagdad, and a canal parallel to the Euphrates joined up by a series of subsidiary canals, by which a territory of some 640,000 acres would be restored to cultivation, and thus provide for an enormous additional popidation, while adding proportionately to the wealth and prosperity of the country. I further briefly developed some other main features of the scheme based on a Memorandum, of which I also inclose a copy. His Majesty expressed himself pleased with the idea, the importance of which he seemed fully to appreciate, and asked me to furnish him with a brief summary of these proposals in Turkish. At the same time His Majesty observed that, however excellent the idea in itself might be, it w r as not possible for him to form a definite opinion until he was in possession of more particulars. An undertaking of this magnitude demanded the employment of judge whether or not the scheme promised to be advantageous to the State when the conditions and terms proposed by the Company were known. His Majesty added, however, that he would be pleased to give the matter his best consideration. CONFIDENTIAL. [June 19.] Sir N.

THE essential difference between Mesopotamian and Egyptian schemes of irrigation lies in the fact that the Nile is a river that inundates its banks during August and October, while the Tigris and Euphrates are in flood in March, April, and May. Thus the Nile recedes during a cool season, while the Mesopotamian floods subside just when the burning heats of summer commence, with torrid days and dewless nights, to parch the soil. Consequently Mesopotamia requires perennial irrigation, as opposed to the basin system. Area under consideration. The district affected by the proposed irrigation schemes is that country bounded on the north by Ana and Tekrit and the Persian Gulf on the south. Rivers within the Area. The Euphrates .—This river flows past Musayab, Hilla, and Diwania. A little below Musayab it turns into the Hindia Canal, the Hindia barrage (a stone weir 230 metres long) has failed to arrest the silting up of the Euphrates past Babylon and Ildla, consequently the true Euphrates is dry during August, September, and October, and almost dry in winter. At Karma it flows into the 1 igris, after being rejoined by the diverted waters from the Hindia Canal. The maximum discharge = 3,000 cubic metres per second in April. The minimum discharge = 300 cubic metres per second in October. At Musayab, width = 250 metres. Tigris .—From Tekrit to Amara the Tigris is a fine river, but between Amara and Kurna the cuts and overflows into the swamps reduce it by much of its volume until Kurna is passed, where much of the water returns from the marshes. Width of Tigris = 300 metres. Flood rise = 6 metres. Maximum discharge = 5,000 cubic metres per second in April. Minimum discharge = 250 cubic metres per second in October. Ad hem River .—Flows into the Tigris from the Hamrin Hills. Since the turning of the Adhem River dam its canals have ceased to irrigate. Discharge = 250 cubic metres per second. Dyala. —Flows into the Tigris a little below Bagdad. It feeds numerous canals, and its waters are utilized in winter and autumn. Discharge = 500 cubic metres per second.Kerkha .—Flows into the swamps east of Kurna, finally entering the Bussorah River by the Shaab mouth, east of Gurna. ... Karun .—Flows into the Bussorah River at Mohammera, carrying with it much rich mud. . Bussorah .—This river is formed of the combined waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, am. runs from their point of junction at Kurna. While passing through the swamps the waters lose their rich mud, but is supplied with this fertilizing medium from the Karun. The inflowing sea tide distributes the mud up the Bussorah River, above the point of influx of the Karun. N.B.—If the Karun was in any way diverted, the loss of mud would be severely felt, by cultivators along the Bussorah River. The Country has been divided into 15 Sections of a Total Area of 5,010,000 hectares. Table of Sections. No. No. of Hectares. Name. Remarks. 1 270,000 Tekrit Samarra..

New Difficulties for the Bagdad Railway Undertaking. —Next to the question of the construction of the Bagdad Railway itself has notably stood that of the irrigation establishments in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates. It seemed, so to speak, to be the natural economic continuation of the German railway undertaking. Many a German explorer and traveller has made studies at the place itself, and many books have been published on the question. Two years ago there appeared also an article of the former Head of the Egyptian Department for irrigation establishments, Sir William Willcocks, which discussed the possibility and costs of such a project. And, again, the English, to all appearances, have worked quicker than the Germans, for the highly significant announcement comes from Constantinople that Sir William Willcocks has submitted to the Sultan, with the support of the British Embassy, an extensive plan for the irrigation of the Vilayets of Bagdad and Bussorah. The announcement says nothing more nor less than that the English are on the point of beginning the great work of laying out new irrigation canals by the Euphrates and Tigris, and therewith to undertake the work of colonizing in those territories. While we have dispatched one Commission of discovery after another—the last one in the spring of this year—to Mesopotamia without commencing any practical work, English experts have completed their preliminary labours, which have enabled them to submit to the Sultan a finished prospectus for the construction of canals in the old cultivated territories. The permission to execute this plan has not, it is true, so far been granted by the Sultan, but there is little hope that it will be withheld. It is to be hoped that the German Embassy in Constantinople will take up the matter with the utmost energy, in order to frustrate at the last moment this paralyzing impediment to German undertakings.

Willcocks. As is well-known, Sir William Willcocks, the designer of the Assouan reservoir and creator of the modern irrigation system of Egypt, has long been interested in the possibility of restoring and extending the ancient irrigation works on the River Tigris and the recreation of Chaldea. Two years ago he delivered a fascinating lecture on the subject in Cairo, in which he calculated that on the Tigris alone by an expenditure of eight millions sterling a million and a quarter acres could be irrigated, equal to a capital sum of thirty-eight milJions and producing a revenue of two millions a year, or twenty-five per cent, on the outlay. Then in Lower Chaldea there are a million and a half acres awaiting reclamation at an estimated expenditure of thirteen millions sterling with an estimated return of twenty millions. Or for the whole of ancient Chaldea 2,800,000 acres, at an expenditure of £21,000,000 wuth a return of £60,000,000, Sir William has just returned from a further visit of exploration among the ruins of the vast ancient system of irrigation in the Euphrates valley, and as he transferred from the Gulf steamer Linga to the P. and O. Caledonia at Bombay, he was caught by a representative of the Times of India, who obtained from him much valuable information regarding the possibilities of irrigation in what was once the great granary of the world. “ Satisfied,” he cried, in response to the first natural query as to the fruits of bis enterprise ! “ I am more than satisfied. I am amazed at the scope there exists for irrigation on the Euphrates and Tigris, and at the ease with which the necessary works can be constructed. One thing is clear, here irrigation and navigation must go hand in hand, and the Tigris and Euphrates carry enough water for irrigation and navigation combined for half a century. When I saw r it in January the Euphrates at Babylon was twelve yards wide and one yard deep : it was, I believe, dry for three months in the summer. The Tigris above Ezralent w'as forty yards wide and ten feet deep ; in summer it is forty yards wide and three feet deep. Both rivers, however, need vigorous taking in band to prevent complete obliteration owing to the heavy silt they carry. “The country is literally made for irrigation. One river being fifteen feet above the level of the other, there is a natural slope for the canals. I divided the irrigable area into fifteen blocks, each self-contained, and yet form ing, when complete, .one part of a co-ordinate whole. This is most essential, because, owing to the heavy silt carried by both the rivers all irrigation works must be comprehensive, working and tailing into one another in order to obtain good velocities. When the country had a strong Central Government, this all- important detail received close attention, and the magnificent canal system was maintained in complete working order. When the Central Government weakened, the canals began to silt, with the appalling ruin and desolation seen to-day in what was once the granary of the world. The first work would he for a combined irrigation and navigation canal joining the Euphrates and 3Tigris near Baghdad. Then the other seetions could le taken in hand as soon as the country was ready and money was forthcoming. When the fifteen sections are complete I estimate that it will be possible to irrigate five millions of the fourteen or fifteen million acres comprised in the deltas of the two rivers, without the necessity of providing reservoirs for them, and also to ensure the necessary navigation.” “ The cost ? Eor the first section I estimate that a sum of about ei^ht millions sterling will be required. Nor, when the possibilities of the country are realised, do I think there will be any difficulty in raising the money, havina regard to the promptitude with which capital is forthcoming for any well-con ceived reclamation project in Egypt. The returns ? Those must for the most part be conjectural for the present. I never form any opinion until I have the advice of the chemist to support it. I have collected a very large number of specimens of soils, some eighty in all, and many of these have alreadv been sent to Egypt for analysis. So far as I can judge, the best soils are extremely good and in even the salt lands I have been unable to detect the presence of any of the dreaded black alkalies. These, as you know, are quite hopeless, as the salts are insoluble in water; soils impregnated with white alkalies are reclaimable as the salts can be washed out. The engineering difficulties are unimportant! The problems to be faced are far less serious than those we have to confront in Egypt every day. As for the work of construction there is plenty of excellent building material on the spot. Labour, I was also assured, would be forthcoming in abundance as soon as it was known that it would be paid for.” Thence the ta!k drifted to the magnificent works of the Sassanian Kin^a described in the lecture already referred to. “ Did I see any evidences of them ?” exclaimed Sir William. “Why man, the country is full of monuments of those old engineers. Is this a dining saloon ? We were sitting in the solnnn of the Caledonia —“You know it is by the chairs and the tables and the lights cO lor anyone who has eyes to see—I have been an irrigation engineer all mv lite on every hand there lie in Chaldea the remains of their splendid irrigation system. Ton can see where their main canals ran, where the regulators 0 were constructed, where feeders took off. You can see where the ancients made mistakes, and where and how they rectified them. So clear are these indication* that they greatly lightened the task of taking levels. I could gauge bow tlm land sloped and to what extent. As for utilising these old works in mv proiect the Chaldean engineers were handicapped by the want of iron. In cases where this did not affect their designs I should utilise the remains of their works ^ here tbe command of iron confers upon us material advantages, we should naturally strike out a fresh and distinct line. ” 8 As to his own plans, Sir William Willcooks was equally frank “ Tlipfir-t essential,’ he said, “ is to obtain the consent of the Turkish Government and that I shall strive for. The Turk has firm hold on the land and has quite ousted the Arab. Most properly too. The Arab is a human locust, destrovin- everything before him, contributing nothing to the productivity of the soif leaving nothing but desolation in his train. So well rooted is Turkish n, that my authorisation from the Government carried me everywhere. [ was treated with far greater consideration and respect in ancient Chaldea than I an Englishman aud a Christian, would receive in Egypt. ” ’ One little incident must not be omitted here, because of the hVht Uirows upon Turkish methods and upon the character of Sir William Willcooks One Moughal Bey, it seems the son of that Moughal who built the g^ barrage at Cairo and bequeathed it, a shaky heritage, to the British irr.vftfnn engineers who came to restore prosperity to the distracted land has been engaged for many years in irrigation works on the Euphrates. The' ent.W ,ng de ails are obscure, but the point is this, the water pours through opSs in the barrage and Moughal is afraid to close them. Said Sir WilHnm “ r “ S plored him to close them. ” &lt; No,’ said he, - the dam wilt break ™’ . I'Z mind was my response, let it break ; if it does, build it up If it „ build it up again. If it break a third time, build it yet Lain for each ff™’ your foundations will be stronger. But close the dam^Ln and feme tL rorront down the Euphrates, if only for one glorious hour of spreading tlie wator 4tover the thirsty land and restoring fertility to this desolate soil. ” There spoke the mnn who in the teeth of the croakings of the prophets of disaster closed the gates of Moughal Bey’s quaking barrage at Cairo, held up water enough to give Lower Egypt a bounteous crop, and saved the money which set the country firmly on the path to prosperity. It was trenching on the domain of politics to touch upon the prospects of the German railway to the Gulf. Sir William is one of those who believe that it will come and at no distant date; it is now only a question of money As he reads their concession, they could, too, if they had the command of capital, begin the line at Baghdad and run it to Nineveh and to Khamkin. lie holds, also, that it is undignified of Great Britain to sulk and have no part in this enterprise. “The natural line for the railway,” he said, “ is from Baghdad to Khamkin, Kermanshah, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman, to link up the Nushki- Quetta railway, now in process of construction. British enterprise should construct the Khamkin-Nushki railway, which would traverse a country capable of development, not a God-forsaken tract like the Gulf shore. The recent discovery of oil wells at Khani-I-Shirin, on the route of the projected Khamkin- Nushki railway is most important and would have a great etfect on the work ing of the line. The steamer companies should build hotels at Basra, Baghdad and Babylon, to encourage tourists. In all facilities for travel the country is most backward. There are eight or ten steamers on the Tigris; none on the Euphrates. The Germans could cover the Euphrates and the Tigris with their steamers for the transport of their railway materials and stores duty free. We ought to be doing something to put life in our half-dead influence in the country.” And your own work in Egypt, Sir William ? “ Ah !’* was the response. “ I have said my last word about the Nile. My new book, The. Nile in 1904, the proofs of which I corrected before I came away, embodied the last word I had to say about the Nile. I have squeezed myself dry, I have not, and never shall have anything to add to what I have there written. My hopes now lie in the re-creation of Chaldea. As I stood there, surveying the remains of what was a superb irrigation system, I felt like the prophet Ezechiel when he gazed upon the Valley of Dry Bones. Here were the dry bones in the empty watercourses, the abandoned canals. I longed to call them to life, to clothe them with flesh and blood ; to make this land smile again with the fruits of the earth. My hopes, my ambitions, my work, are bound up with the re-creation of Chaldea.” G.C. P&gt;Mt| Simla.—No, 101 T. D.—50.— H, A.

Major Newmarch also makes some observations of the importance which such a scheme may assume in connection with the German Bagdad Railway. Whatever may be the result of Sir W. Willcocks’ studies and reports, it is to be regretted that he communicated his views at this stage to the German and French Consuls. They are sure to report the circumstances to their Governments, and it will be in the interests of Germany, and probably of France also, to impede any negotiations that may possibly take place here until they are satisfied that their own interests will be fully protected. I am, however, somewhat sceptical as to the possibility of putting through any scheme sucli as Sir W.

SIR WILLIAM WILLCOCKS is still staying with me. He has travelled down the course of the Nahrwan Canal from a little north of Samarra down to Ctesiphon, and down the Euphrates from Faluja to Musayib. He has also examined the old canals and the country between the Euphrates and the Tigris. He is much pleased with the results of his journeys, and speaks in the most enthusiastic terms of the prospects and facility of irrigating Mesopotamia. He is convinced that it would be most remunerative and quite easy—far easier, indeed, than he had anticipated—because the level of the Euphrates is 4 or 5 metres higher than the level of the Tigris. He contemplates irrigating Mesopotamia from the Euphrates by canals wdiose surplus waters would flow into the Tigris, thus increasing the depth of that river in its low season and lessening the extent of the marshes, which are at present the curse of the lower Euphrates. He has collected much information regarding those two rivers, [1958 r—1]3 they are disappointed with what they have seen.

The foregoing information may be useful when collated with similar information The Bagdad Railway. I have had a conversation with one of the party referred to in my diary of last week a geological expert who is a Swiss subject—I think his name was Dr. Kiesslin-. I gathered from him that the opinion of himself and his party was that the railway would not pay south of Mosul, if even so far south, and that their object was to find out how it could be made more remunerative by the development of mineral production, agriculture, and irrigation. I gathered that, so far, he had been disappointed in the geological aspect of the country, but seemed much impressed by the fertility of the soil and the prospects oi agricultural development by irrigation. He dwelt much on Sir William Willcocks’ schemes for irrigating Mesopotamia. The visit of this party of exploration has, of course, given rise to much local comment, and the American Consul, with whom Dr. Kiessling has been staying, and with whom he has apparently discussed the subject a good deal, is of opinion that the progress of the railway depends almost entirely on the present relations between the German Emperor and the Sultan, and that if either were to die the future progress of the railway might be obstructed by the Turks. ° An opinion seems to be gaining ground here that if the railway ever o^ets as far as Bagdad it will never go south ol it, but will discharge its contents into the river steamers here, whose number will be largely increased. River carriage would of course, be cheaper than carriage by rail. . „ The . foregoing is almost gossip, but it may be useful when compared with inlormaticn from other sources, and that must be my excuse for noting it. from other sources.

Sir William Willcocks left Bagdad on the 17th January. His object is to make another Egypt of Mesopotamia, and lie seems to me to be just the man to do it, if only the Sultan can be persuaded to give him the opportunity. His idea at present is to start a Company (English, if possible; failing that, international; or, lastly, German) for improving the irrigation and the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates. He hopes to get the_ large capitalists of Europe to support his scheme, and to bribe the Sultan into accepting it by offering him a large share of the profits, or by offering to improve and develop his private lands (the Saniya)—which are already extensive, and yearly extending, in this part of the country—by irrigation, or by offering to develop his line of steamers (now six in number) in carrying the produce of the newly-irrigated land to Bussorah. His schemes are very large, and the capital required would probably not be less than 20 millions. The great, and probably the only, difficulty will be to secure the Sultan’s consent. The development of Mesopotamia in this direction would give a stimulus to, and even provide funds for, the Bagdad Railway, though if ttie navigation, of the river were improved the railway would probably find it difficult to compete with the river- borne traffic, and the Sultan would develop his line of steamers at the expense of the railway.

The details of the new war loan are now announced The interest is to be 5 per cent., and the total amount of the issue will be 52,000,000/. As I hinted, 20,000,000/. is to be taken up by German financiers, and the balance by 1 renchmen. The remarkable features of the whole matter, however, do not appear in these dry figures. They lie in the advantages which Germany has been able to squeeze from her unfortunate neighbour. These represent a very substantial bonus beyond anything that France—the real ally—has obtained. Russia has made a definite promise to spend some 200,000,000 fr. of the loan upon German war-ships. Moreover, Count von Billow has extracted a promise that Russia will withdraw her opposition to the Bagdad Railway scheme. Germany evidently has determined not to throw away any cards she may think of value, though playing them may scarcely seem to be within the rules of the game. It must, however, be pointed out that this mixing of commerce and finance with diplomacy is not a desirable thing. International politics are none too sweet at present, and their condition is not likely to be improved by the introduction of a large measure of German-Jew finance.’’ Tht date coincided very nearly with the departure from Germany of certain representatives (Herr Quandt and another) of the Deutscher Bank, who are now in Bagdad, in company with four or five other persons of different nationalities, who are said to be either engineers of the Bagdad Railway or prospectors for petroleum. My information leads me to think that they have come to examine the country generally, but perhaps chiefly for petroleum. They have come from Aleppo down the Euphrates, and intend to return northwards, vi&amp; Mosul, along the Tigris.

Answer. His Majesty’s Government are not aware that any steps have been taken for the construction of the Bagdad Railway beyond the Koniah-Eregli section, which was completed in October 1904, and paid for by a loan raised at Berlin ; and they have no knowledge of any schemes for raising the funds necessary for the continuation of the fine to the Persian Gulf. .

Sir William Willcocks, who has returned from Mesopotamia, believes that the Tigris and Euphrates have water enoxigh to allow of the irrigation of live million acres and navigation to the sea. The hydraulic problems involved are easier than those connected with the Nile, but measures against silting will be necessary. The first work needed is an irrigation and navigation canal joining the two rivers at Bagdad.

NEWMARCH, Major. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Diary of Political Intelligence sent by Consul-General Newmarch to Government of India. December 20.—On the 20th December the late Yali of Bagdad paid me a long private visit. He is going to command the expedition which is being sent by the Turks into the region known as Kasim, and he told me that his total force will consist of about 7,000 men, of whom about half are coming from Medina, some from Yemen, and the rest from the Bagdad Vilayet. If these do not suffice, troops will, he said, bo brought from the Vilayet of Adana. He said that, on hearing of this expedition, both Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saoud had written to him to say that they wished to make peace and would accept the Sultan’s authority. He said he did not expect there would he any serious fighting, because his force would be too strong for any opposition. When I asked him how he proposed to feed so large a force, he replied, in a most easy-going way, that he supposed they would live on biscuits or tinned foods; hut he added that they might occasionally get mutton, because there are a good many sheep in that country, which, he said, was by no means so barren as generally supposed. He said the place had some perennial streams coming from the Jabal Shammar, and that in the neighbourhood of these there was some, and might he much more, cultivation. Also, he said, there were several wells and oases in the neighbouring desert. He was, and has always been, most friendly towards me as far as his limited powers and the suspicion of the Turks would allow. He stayed for a long time, and we parted in the most cordial manner. December 22.—On the 22nd December, 1904, I paid a visit to the new Vali, accompanied by Sir William Willcocks, who presented to him a letter of introduction from the Minister of the Interior at Constantinople. The Vali promised to give Sir William Willcocks every assistance, and Sir William promised to tell the Vali on his return what he had seen. Sir William Willcocks intends going for about ten days up to Samara by the right bank of the Euphrates, and to return via the bed of the Nahrwan Canal to Bakuba and Bagdad. He later proposes to go to Hillah to see the canals in that quarter. [2329 gg — 3]2 Six hundred infantry (Redifs or reserves) left to-day by the Turkish steamer-' Mosul ” on their way down the river. It is said that 300 of these men are §oing to the Muntafik country, and 300 to be stationed at Bussorah. These troops have recently arrived from Mosul and Kirkook. I have heard it said here that the Sultan is pressing on the construction of the Hedjaz Railway in order to secure a terminus at the head of the Gulf of Akaba, and that the ultimate terminus of the railway will be at Mocha. This rumour may be worth notice in connection with the efforts now being made to strengthen the Turkish authority and position in Kasim and Central Arabia. December 23.—The Consular Agent at Mosul reports as follows:— 'On Sunday, 11th December, the Redifs (reserve troops) which have been collected from this Vilayet (Mosul) left for Bagdad in four rafts. They are about 300 in number. It is said that about forty of them deserted the second day alter their departure, because the Government had not supplied them with bedding and clothing in this winter season. Some say that these reserves are going to join the light which is now going on between Ibn Saoud and Ibn Rashid ; others say that they are going against the Sharit of Mecca, who has disobeyed the Government and destroyed the Hedjaz Railway, and that now the Government will have to overcome the Sharif.”_X“ Documenl is the Property ol His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] ERSIA AND ARABIA.

It would seem as If some occult influences were inspiring the French people with mistrust of the growth of British influence in Arabia. The indi cations of this feeling, which have become evident from timo to time, deserve attention in England if only because they manifest themselves in quarters well-disposed towards the Anglo- French entente and desirous of promoting its development. Thus last August Professor Lorin, of Bordeaux, in the course of a cordial apprecia tion of Lord Curzon’s work in the DSpeche Ooloniale, the organ of the Colonial party of which M. Etienne is the leader, significantly inquired whether the Viceroy was not presuming too much upon his good fortune in pursuing a policy which was “ capable of disquieting Tur key, Germany, Russia, and also France, which is a Mussulman Power.” This referred to what 1 Professor Lorin described ns the remarkable progress of British influence in Arabia, which, he said, was gradually extending towards Mecca, both from the coast of the Persian Gulf and from Aden. * To-day the Petit Parisicn, the responsible and influential Republican organ edited by the 1 former Minister, M. Jean L)upuy, publishes an article on the same subject. It goes so far as to state in so many words that England is now 1 engaged on a great enterprise which is nothing i less than the “ dismemberment of the Ottoman - dominion in Arabia and the dislocation of the l native States, real or nominal vassals of Turkey.” j-Jdt goes on to say that the object is to subject these States to a new supremacy—namely, that of British India or of Egypt, but more probably of the latter, adding that in the last resort this, of course, would be equivalent to English supremacy. Whatever may be thought of the inherent improbabiHty of these statements, there can be no doubt as to the importance of the fact that they received credence in responsible quarters. Englislimen can have no interest in permitting the propagation of such mischievous views as to their intentions. The Petit Parixien asserts that Lord Cnrzon, no longer content with dominating the Persian Gulf, proposes to conquer Arabia. England, it says, possesses in the Khedive a vassal Sovereign, who may claim great influence over Islam, and one of whose ancestors some 60 years ago made the Turk tremble at Starabul. *If this young Prince could extend his power over the holy places of Mecca and Medina, that change of regime would greatly enhance the prestige of England. The secret design of the English is eventually to seize Sheikh-Said, which in their hands would bo converted into a Gibraltar on the route to India. But the French have long standing rights upon Sheikh-Said, which' is also claimed by the Turks. The problem is therefore a difficult one, yet the British Government is discussing it with the Porte. The Italians, who jcsiYet the possession of Hodeida, may be a source of difficulty, but the main obstacle in the way of the English is the action taken by the commander of the faithful. Abdul Hamid, realizing that the loss of the holy places of Islam would undemine his own authority, is, according to the Repub lican journal, straining every nerve to hasten the construction of the railway from Damascus to Mecca, which will shortly approach Sinai. BRITISH INFLUENCE IN ARABIA.' y (FROM OUR OWN CORRISSPONDENT.) PARIS, Dia 11. The occult influences that have apparently been endeavouring for some time past to inspire the French people with mistrust of British action in Arabia, as mentioned in the Paris corre spondence of The Times on November 25, are evidently determined to lose no opportunity of making mischief. The Moderate Republican organ, the Petit Parisian, a favourite medium for these “ revelations,” accused England a fortnight ago of aiming at nothing less than the “ dismember ment of the Ottoman dominion in Arabia,” and the conquest of that territory. To-day it boldly affirms that the ‘‘ great project of Anglo- Saxon Imperialism, which consists. ... in substituting the Khedive for tho Sultan in tho suzerainty of Mecca and Medina,” is now in course of execution. Tho “ significant and highly important act ” upon, which it bases this sensational announcement is a complaint said to have been addressed to Lord Cromer on behalf of certain Egyptian pilgrims to Mecca against an abuse of power by the GrandSherif of that sacred place. This is represented to be a very serious matter by the Republican journal, which speaks of the “ policy of expansion in Arabia pursued by Lord Curzon more or less in agreement with the British Government.” The Petit Parisien adds :—“ This js the first time that the authorities of tho holy cities have appealed to tho Khedive, thus recognizing Ills civil and religious jurisdiction. . . . Abdul Hamid, who has been very much, affected, has sent tardy representations to his vassals. Tho anxiety at Constantinople is all the greater as the son of the Iman Sheikh Hamcd Eddin, who is known to be an ally of tho English, has just begun a holy war in Yemen.” —— r- I11S j-^OC a t is A' ASIATIC TURKEY.
