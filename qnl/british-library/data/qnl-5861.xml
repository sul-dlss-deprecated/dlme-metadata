His .Excellency read the Regulations when th^y appeared in Umm ul ^ura in October and although they are announced as coming into force from the date of publication no change in practice has taken place. 2 # In the case of the towns it has long been customary to leave arms at their gates, which is often also convenient to the carriers of Che arms themselves as well gg reassuring to the authori cies. It is the existing lule in Kuwait to do so. 2 ^ Assuming that the ohaikh is correct in thinking that the Regulations are not enforceable in this area, then this agency has no comment. If alternatively security in the desert were to change so much for the better, implying a closer mesh to Laudi Arab authority which hardly seems practicable in the open deserts of North Hast Arabia there could also be no objection to the enforcement of the Saudi Arab Regulations from Kuwait.imhb N; I I - 2 - 4. That the Saudi Arab authorities have instructions under these Regulations arbitrarily to remove arms from those who may approach their posts from this side is already disproved by practice which has continued since October and publication as before.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 24th March, 1936. Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No.E 7321/7321/25 of 3rd January, 1936, covering copies of correspondence exchanged hetween this Department and His Majesty’s ?dinister at Jedda regarding the regulations prohibiting the import, sale, carrying and possession of arms in Saudi Arabia, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a further despatch on the subject from Sir Andrew Ryan. 2. Mr. Eden is inclined to share the views expressed in paragraph 5 of the enclosed despatch, but would be glad to receive Lord Zetland*s observations. 3. A similar letter is being addressed to the Colonial Office and copies sent to the Air Ministry, War Office, Board of Trade and Department of Overseas Trade. In view of the circulation given to the correspondence, Mr. Eden does not think it necessary to ask Sir Andre?/ Ryan to prepare a memorandum on the subject as suggested in the final paragraph of the enclosed despatch. I am, etc., (Sgd.) G.W.RENDEL The Under Secretary of State, India Office0 'H British Legation, Jedda. 12th February, 1936. Sir, I have some difficulty in replying satisfactorily to your despatch No*369 (E 7321/7321/25) of December 10th regarding the new regulations on fire-arms promulgated by the Saudi Government on October 31st last. Many regulations are made in this country, thanks to the passion of the more modern-minded of Ibn Saud’s advisers for making laws, which have so little relation to the conditions or the country that they produce very little effect. My firsx inclination on receipt of your despatch was to regard the regulations now in question as having this character and as being little likely to be seriously enforced, except perhaps in the larger t owns• 2. On further consideration I am impressed by three facts, as follows (a) Ibn Saud’s general policy is fundamentally, though cautiously, hostile to the perpetuation o'’ the old tribal system. He has aimed at creating a pax Saudiana and he has had considerable success in certain areas, most notably perhaps in the central portions of the Hejaz. In these areas tribesmen may still carry arms, for to carry arms is a matter of pride, but it is doubtful whether the arms are absolutely necessary for self preservation. In remoter and wilder areas, the need must obviously be greater, but Ibn Saud may be convinced that he is now strong enough to extend his system of security even in such areas. (b) There has been a recent tendency to accentuate the control of the central Government by sending commissions ■'V ’ \ of organisation, increasing the number of governors, who The Right Hon. Anthony Eden, M.C. , M.P., etc., etc., etc* are/are state officials rather than local personages, and augmenting gradually the number of police posts under the control of a Director General of ;olice in Mecca. (c) A passage in the H.A.P. Intelligence Report, Jerusalem, for December speaks of the widespread discontent caused by the regulations under consideration and the opposition to their enforcement in the Northern Hejaz. 3. These considerations cause me to think that the regulations may be an experiment in which the King himself is interested, but, if so, he would probably see that the rigour of their enforcement was adapted to the conditions of particular regions. He probably has a greater general knowledge of the management of tribes than anyone in this country and his sense of policy will always outweigh any legal considerations, other than taose of purely religious law. 4. As regards the specific points raised in your despatch, I would offer the following observations:- (a) I see nothing remarkable in the provisions of Article 7 of the regulation, having regard to the conditions of a country in which every high personage has his retinue of retainers. Any prince or governor for instance who was not attended by armed men of this kind, would be put to shame and would fail to inspire respect for his authority (b) As regards the point raised in paragraph 4 of your despatch, I have had the translation of Article 9 of the regulations checked and am told that it is correct. The conclusion would appear to be that the drafter o° the regulation was unwilling to contemplate any carrying of arms by non-Saudis and therefore provided that persons applying for permits must provide positive proof of Saudi nationality. This may be the modernist touch, based on the assumption, so dear to Syrians and others with legal minds, that every one has a nationality and suould be able to/to prove it; or it may be one of the many devices adopted in this country to ^orce as many people as possible to accept Saudi nationality* (c) I think Article 16 is clearly meant to safeguard the carrying of arms by Saudi tribesmen in the open country but I am not sure what is meant by 'and others’* unless it is intended to allow for elasticity e.g. in the case of travelling merchants, who need to carry arms no less than tribesmen. It may be said that such persons should take out licences before starting on a jo\irney but muddled thought is frequent in the drafting of Saudi regulations. 5. I pass to the most difficult question raised in your despatch, that of the combined effect of Articles 16 and 16 of the regulations. I think the conclusion reached in paragraph 3 of the despatch is logical, but there is little logic in this country, except what is chopped in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Only experience can show whether the practical effect of the regulations, having regard to what I have said in paragraph 2(a) above, corresponds with the logical conclusion. In any case I think it would be difficult to take the matter up with the Saudi Government, without having concrete evidence thal the operation of the regulations was in fact seriously disadvantageous to tribes from adjoining countries. They would be very ready to reply that, if foreigners were afraid of danger in a country so admirably administered as Saudi Arabia, they need not come in. I can only suggest that the British authorities in Trans-Jordan and other areas which may be affected should be invited to watch the situation and report any incidents attributable to the enforcement of the regulations. 6. I have considered whether I should do well to discuss this matter informally with Fuad Bey Hamza. I have decided that it would be better not to do so, unlessa specially favourable opportunity should occur in the course of private conversation, without awaiting further instructions. 7. You will have noticed that Articles 3 and 4 of the regulation under consideration refer to earlier regulations on sporting guns. As Saudi legislation is so difficult to keep track of, it may he worth noting here that the earlier regulations in question would appear to he those enclosed in my despatch No.228 of June 18th 1931, supplemented hy those enclosed in my despatch No.186 of June 17th 1933. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty^ Ambassador at Bagdad. If the suggestion at the end of paragraph 6 above is adopted, it may be desirable to circulate to the other posts concerned a memorandum on the whole subject, rather than to distribute copies of all the correspondence. You may prefer to arrange for this in London but, if you wish, I can in due course circulate from here the more important articles in the regulation with a memorandum of my own on the points requiring attention. I have, etc., (Sgd.) ANDREW RYAN.P.2. 2102/36. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 15th April 1936. Sir, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for. India to refer to Mr.Rendel’s letter of the 24th March, No.E.1131/ 112/25, regarding the regulations prohibiting the import, sale, carrying and possession of arms in Saudi Arabia. 2. In the light of Colonel Fowle’s demi-official letter of 27th February (copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office on 25th March) and subject to any further observations that may be received from him as to the effect oi the regulations on the Trucial Coast, the Marquess of Zetland agrees with the views expressed by Sir Andrew Ryan in paragraph 5 of his despatch enclosed in the Foreign Oil ice letter under reference and proposes accordingly to confine himself to sending instructions to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to watch the situation and report any incidents attributable to the enforcement of the regulations. 3. His Lordship agrees that it is unnecessary to ask Sir Andrev/ Ryan to prepare a memorandum on the subject. 4. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Colonial Cilice, Air Ministry, Far Office, Board of Trade and Department of Overseas Trade.
