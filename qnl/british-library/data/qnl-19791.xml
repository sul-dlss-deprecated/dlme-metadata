I have the honour to bring to the recollection of the Government of India Vide correspondence ending with Foreign De- about 6 years ago, a rumour emanat- partment endorsement No. 38i4-e. b ., dated asth ing from a newspaper correspondent in eptember 1906. 7. V - x Constantinople, got abroad to the effect that Germany was negotiating with the Porte for the acquisition of the Island of Halul in the Persian Gulf. 2. In connection with this rumour endeavours were made to ascertain the precise status of the Island ; but the record of no specific test case was then forthcoming and such information as could be obtained without specifically raising the issue, rather tended to show that the Island was resorted to alike by boats from the Trucial Coast, Katar and Bahrain, and that none of the Shaikhs con cerned seemed to possess any positive or exclusive claim to it. In the course of examination of records bearing upon the buoyage question, some correspondence of 1869 referring to Halul has come to light, from which it will be seen that one of the Shatt-al-Arab buoys having got adrift and been thrown up on Halul Island, reference was made, apparently as a matter of course, to the Shaikh ot Abu Dhabi as overlord of the Island. 3. In case the ownership of the Island should over come into question again, t , -i . „ it seems desirable that this piece of evid- Fust Assistant, to Resident, No. 109, dated oth 1 1 1 &gt; i i e ^ March 1869. ence should oe on the records of the Resident, to First Assistant, No. 153, dated 27th Government of India ; I therefore venture March 1809. . f , • r 1 to forward copies ot the papers.
