Hudson has asked to he allowed to resign whether he is sent to Muscat or not. Am writing separately' on this subject. 3 . Jackson is possible alternative for Muscat appointment but he is doing important work on Tmeial Coast , and I am anxious that he should be allowed to go on leave early in May as he has not had home leave except for a few days since 1943. In the circumstances I propose to send either Andrew or Stobart to Muscat. Either could carry on there for two months especially as Sultan who knows English is present. Work is light and there is plenty of time for study* Stewart considers Sultan unlikely to raise any objection to appointment - of junior Officer if situation is explained to him* 4. I accordingly request urgent approval to appointment Qp either Andrew or Stobart at my discretion temporarily in place of Stewart. I am inclined to favour Stobart leaving Andrew to take over as assistant Political iigent Bahrein if no replacement for Hudson can be provided.

The position seems to be:- , (1) The Foreign Office &gt;(Mr. Glasse and the Clerks Department) wash their hands of anything less than a diplomatic car. (2) The Ministry of War Transport (Mr. B ere don, Extension 2188) say that (a) If we are paying the freight the car can be classed as an official consignnent. There will be no need of an export licence and if we fill in form M.C.B**/^ (there is said to be a supply in the Military Department) they will take the whole thing over and deliver the car to Galloway’s doorstep in Muscat. (b) If Galloway pays the freight he will have to get a Board of Trade export licence and put the matter in the hands of a shipping company. They would, however, give him shipping priority on a recommendation from us. They suggest that we adopt course (a) and reclaim from Galloway. « (3) The E &amp; 0 Department (Mr. Clarkson) say that the M.W.T. are talking through their hats, that the War Office refuses to allow cars to be shipped to India, using shipping space that might be allotted to a military vehicle, and would certainly refuse to allow them to be sent there for trans-shipnent to the Gulf. The only hope would be for Galloway’s car to be shipped by a direct ime remte to the Gulf, but sailings are few and far between. Mr. Clarkson suggested that we should take the matter up with Mr. Rumbold on his return from leave. (4) The Ministry of Supply (Euston 1260, Ext.2277) say that it would be extremely difficult for Galloway to get a new car, which would have to come out of India’s allotment, and there would certainly be a fuss about it. At any rate he would not be allowed to have a new car of over 10 h.p. unless he could / pro\fe *prove that it was for military purposes. They advise very strongly that he should find a little used second-hand high powered car which he can buy without a permit, and not bring up the question of an official supply.

Felly took over charge on/21 st Januaiyj, 192f2, and the Commission would have to be 'with effect' from that date.

Unless therefore, the distinction between 'act ing' and 'permanent' Consuls is based on some consideration other than length of tenure of the post, 1 think that 1 deserve the Warrant. 1 would like very much to have it.
