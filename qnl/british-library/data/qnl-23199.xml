Memorandum There is shortly going to be a complete change in the administration of the Education Department. Until now the Sunni Schools have been controlled by an independent committee, pre sided over by Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, with Yousuf Fakhroo of Muharrak as Treasurer. Shaikh Abdulla has now asked that the Education committee should come under direct Government control. Most of the members of the Committee are p rsons with scanty educa tion, and they feel that they cannot suitably supervise the work of Education. An ins pector of Education is shortly to be appointed and the department will have its headquarters in an office in the Government buildings. The proposed alteration is a most excellent one, especially as emanating from the Committee themselves.Under the new arrangement, the two Shia Schools will come under the supervision of the central department though there will probably be two separate committees, one Sunni and one Shia, There are now in Manama two Persian Schools attended by a large number of boys; at least one of these schools is subsidized by the Persian Government. I think I am correct in assuming that in most countries all sorts of Public Schools are subject to the control of the local Education authorities. 1 suggest that when the new rejime comes into force the Government Education Department should have some control over the Persian Schools as well as over the Khalifieh and Jaffarieh schools. I may say that this suggestion has already been made by Shaikh iibduj-la bin Isa. Before considering the matter any further I should be glad to hear your views on the subject and to know whether you approve, or not, of the suggestion.

Ramadhan T 48 To Ii. B. L f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memoranduia Recently various changes have been under consideration by the President of the nducation u committee, among other questions it mas decided after the- expiration of the sta,-f T s present agreements, to make a new scale of pay v/hich would, depend mainly on the educational certi ficates held by the master. This iact toge ther with the resentment felt by the Syrian Read- master of the Iluharrak school at the appointment of an Inspector of education, is the reason for the present '.rouble. ^ R week ago, wit!: no w- rning,pthe headmasters of the two Sunni schools in Ranana and n harrak suddenly dismissed the boys, after making very revolutionary and unsuitable speeches, and then closed the schools. On the following day the President of the education Committee, Shaikn ^bdulla bin Isa, summoned the two men; they would not appear but sent a letter stating their demands which inclu dedincluded requests that two of the masters should be members of the Education council, that no changes should be made in the staff’s pay, anci that appointments should be permanent, and the school inspector should have no authority to inspect schools. The other masters and the boys proceeded to parade the town, aking speeches in the bazaars and causing considerable excitement. The whole affair was undoubtedly organised by the head master of the Muharrak school who considered his position secure as he had already been able to shift several masters and headmasters and to intro duce a number of his own relations. The masters were then informed that no discus sion could take place until they returned to work. They replied that until every single request which they made had been granted they would remain on strike. The two headmasters were then dismis sed and sent off by boat on the same day. Their departure was the occasion of an hysterical demon stration. J The schools have now been closed by order of the President for a week and it is thought that during this time the rest of the masters will return to work. The President has managed the affair himself with no reference to the committee as various mem bers of it are unsuitably sympathetic with one of the headmasters.

Memorandum In connection with my letter No. 1339/2E of 11th Ramadhan 1348, on the subject of the school strike. H. E. Shaikh Hamad has sent me the enclosed petition and has told me to ascertain your views on the question of recalling the two dismissed headmasters. The petition was organised by Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz Kozaibi, Haji Yousuf Fakhroo and Haji Abdul Rehman bin Shaikh iibdul Wahab Ziani. I under- stand that the signatures were collected by Ali bin Khalifah, ex Secretary of the Manamah Municipality. The gist of the petition is a request that the two , j headmasters should be re-infe^ated. Since my last letter there has been various developments. Shaikh Abdulla held a meeting which was attended by Manama members of the education * committee, the Sunni 0,adi, various local personages,% and all the teachers of religion in the Goyermnent schools. The disturbing rumours about curtailing religious teaching and abolishing Arabic were discussed and the meeting arrived at the unanimous conclusion that there was absolutely no foundation in these malicious reports which were circulated with what appears to be a deliberate intention. Shaikh Abdulla informed the meeting by real facts of the affair and also stated that though various accusa tions had been made against the Inspector of schools he was entirely free from blame. The strike was planned end organised by the headmaster of Muharrak school. The religious teachers admitted that they had been wrong, but stated that they had been per suaded to take oath not to act except unanimously and so could not at present return to work, though they wished to. Another meeting of the Education committee was held. All the teachers /ere present and they all agreed to return to work at once. They repre sented themselves as being misled. -After this the r £ meeting resolved]itself into an attack made by K. B. xkbdul -uziz Kozaibi supported by Yousuf Fakhroo, upon the President, Shaikh Abdulla. These two persons stated that even in England strikes frequently ocurred and persons were not punished for taking part in them, they questioned the ri ;ht of the Government to T interfere’ in questions about the school end claimed that the schools belonged to the public because ten years ago when they- were first opened&gt; c-'N Rupees Three lacs were collected by public subscrip tion. They considered that the masters should not have been dismissed nd asked for their recall The following.day Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz Kozaibi, Khan Bahadur Abdur Rehman Zayani, Yousuf Fakhroo and Abdur Rehman bin iibdul Wahab Ziani called on me and Shaikh Abdulla and asked for the recall of the masters. Yousuf Fakhroo became very excited and expressed very violent opinion as to the bad management of the whole affair. Shaikh iibdulla replied that the Muharrak master could not possibly be recalled but that the question of the Manama master was somewhat different as it now ep eared.that he was a party to the strike not the instigator. The deputation expressed hopes that Shaikh Abdulla and myself would change our opinions after thinking over the matter. Peyeenelly My personal opinion is that Shaikh Abdulla, with the assistance of the Inspector of Schools is quite capable of managing education in Bahrain without being constantly hampered by a com mittee who are themselves, with one exception entirely uneducated and of whom several are, in my opinion, influenced more by personal interests than by any genuine desire to raise the standard of education in their country. Adviser to the Government.Translation of an artiola which appeared in the n Al-Ayiani” News-naper, in its issue No, 26, dated Basrah 11th iiarch 1930 corresponding 11th Shawal, 1348, under the following heading- DO THEf WANT TO DESTKOY THE EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT IN BAHBAIN? A good educational movement has dawned in Awal Island (Bahrain), this was five years ago. We have rejoiced as other also rejoiced for this good movement in an Arab country which connects us with its people the most strongest ties of relationship. We thanked the Shaikhs of Bahrain and its residents for this good enterprise, we never thought that the British Government which made itself as a protector of Bahrain Island would become one day as an enemy to education and would try to ultimately destroy the educational movement, this was our idea wo knew that the British Nation is on© of the most advanced nations in the world and truly knew the value of education t it was unreasonable that it ( British Government) would commit the offence of oppressing the education which it sanctify in its country and worships it as it worship God. Our idea was not right in this connection as we have heard with great and profound sorrow and regret that the British Consul at Bahrain had began to interefere with the Bahrain Educational affairs, his itereference with these affairs has delayed the progress of education in that Arab country, it is feared that if his such intereferenoe has continued it will completely destroy the educational movement of that country. The worst of what we heard of the intereferenc&lt; of the above Consul is his enforcement on the teachers to force the students to learn English lessons from the very first class (first standard of the school) which the administrator of schools (Mudir A1 Mmdares) had refused to accept such an unjust demand, c ^also the most worst of what we henrd thst this refusal ^as enraged tlie obove Consul and heboe issued his orders for the deportation of the administrator (Mudir) Professor thoman Al-Horani and some of his companions who were actually departed from Bahrain. lour days ago they passed on us here In Basrah on their way to Syria, it is understood that the professor and his companions will rise « great stir in the Syrian news-papers (Press) about the autocracy 01 the British Consul at Bahrain and his enemity to every reform which the Arabs wish to instal in their towns. e or selves in our turn/vthe course followed by the representative or the British Government at Bahrain and reouest the wise nngiish pcoole to justify the Arabs of Bahrain who were the first people of the Arabian &lt; eninsula who spread to them ( to English people) their hands of love and friendship.

This is what I have actually seen and heard on the spot and there is a vast difference between what one hears from others and what he actually sees on the spot. The Government of Bahrain is keeping pace with the time in organising the various branches of its administra tion. In doing so, they have taken into consideration the two important elements, e.g., the time and the Islamic traditions. The Government carries out such improvements with unrelenting energy with the final aim of bettering the system of administration in its various departments. It is an admitted fact that the basis of advancement lies in Education. Education is imparted in the schools, which have therefore to be adequately supervised. I am going to discuss this subject in order to assure such of your readers as may have sympathised with local schools on hearing of their closing, or abolishing, whichever way it may have been reported to be. The 'Al-Khalifah' who are the Rulers of these islands since years are solely responsible for the civilisation of the(J# 3- the country, its wealth and for the prosperity of the inhabitants of all classes. They infact represent the soul of the different categories of life in Bahrain. The responsibility of the Govern ment lies on the shoulders of the Ruler, H.E.Shaikh Hamad bin Isa, one of the most pious, and one well-acquainted with the necessities of the time. A kind Ruler, and of noble disposition, he is alive to his duties in the interests and welfare of his subjects, and never rests until their needs are satisfied. Thus has he secured the love of his subjects and the admiftie-tration of others far and near. The one man who sacrifices his own comforts to revive education and further its scopes and acts as its zealous guar dian is H.E.Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, the president of the education committee. He deputed a graduate of the American University of Beyrout, who had taught there mathematics for three years. Satisfied with his credentials, the President entrusted him with the adminis tration of the department. He merited the confidence reposed in him and carried out his duties in a most able manner. The Government appreciated his endea vours, and so did the enlightened section of the inhabitants who could differentiate aIOH\ No r / 1 Sir, I am directed by His Excellency the Acting High Commissioner to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your letter ib • 637 dated the 18th of June, 1929, regarding Musa Saleh who was selected for service as a teacher at the Shiah School at Manama. 2. The Inspector General of the Iraq Ministry of Education, through whom the services of Musa Saleh were obtained, has informed His Excellency that Musa Saleh has now returned to Iraq. The latter states that no money was paid to him by the Bahrain Government either for his return journey or in respect of the leave earned by him. It appears, however, from a letter in Arabic given him by yourself that, as he enjoyed three months of last summer holidays on full pay, he is not considered to be entitled, in addition, to the two months leave on full pay to which reference was made in your letter lb. 865 dated the 17th of December, 1928, to the Adviser to the Ministry of Interior. His Excellency is informed that in this country, and in most other countries, if teachers salaries are paid monthly, they are held to S f, into be entitled to full pay during the holidays as well as during the term. It was therefore understood from your letter referred to above ' conveying the terms on which teachers were to be engaged, that the “two months leave on full pay” was intended to be in the nature of a gratuity offered at the end of the year’s service. If it is a fact that Musa Saleh has $ received no pay for the two months leave, and no funds to cover his return journey to Baghdad, His Excellency would be glad to know whether you are prepared to arrange for additional payments to be made to him on account of these items.

E. the High Commissioner for Iraq, on the subject of Musa Saleh, teacher at the Manamah Shia School. I regret the delay in replying. Owing to the absence of the Director of Education, on leave^I have had some difficulty in obtaining the files and necessary information to enable me to reply. The teacher in question,Musa Saleh, gave every satisfaction during the time that he worked here and was, in fact;the best master in the Shia School. Towards the end of the school term, as you are possibly aware, there was considerable trouble between the President of the Shia School Committee and some of the masters, especially the headmaster. For this reason, and owing to the complete reorganisation of all the sshools all the masters were told that when their contracts were completed they would not be renewed but should any of them be required again they would be notified and offered new contracts, on regular scale of pay;drawn up by the Bahrain Government, not by the two Education Committees. It was intended that Musa Saleh should be offered a new contract if he wished to take one* Musa Saleh arrived towards the end of the school term andGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. ~ 2 ~ an d after doing about three months work he was given three months leave on full pay, although according to the terms mentioned in my letter No* 656/? of the 25th Jamad A1 Thany, 1347, he was only entitled to two months leave on pay* He returned and completed another school year, at the end of this he was informed that he was entitled to one month’s leave on full pay owing to having availed himself of three months leave the previous year. He declined to take his leave pay and left Bahrain without seeing me or making any complaint. Other masters who were taken on by the School Committee were given three months leave every year on full pay, that is to say the period of the School Holiday^. If Musa Saleh wishes to return we are prepared to offer him a new contract and three months leave pay, but not passage money. If he does not wish to return we will pay him the two months leave pay and his fare. I much regret that this misunderstanding should have occured in the case of this teacher whose services we should be glad to retain and whose work was conspiciously better than that of the other foreign masters in the Shia School.

The enquiry is in connection with mis-delivery of a telegram addressed to **Allham, Secretariat Bahrein**. I have the honour to he, Sir, Persian Qulf Section. t // /4 pZCi//'- &amp; (/Translation of an anonymous letter dated 16th Jamadiul Than!,1349,i*e.6.11*30, to the Honourable the Political Resident, Bushire, Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain* After compliments etc*, , Being encouraged by the kindness and mercy which is shown towards the poor and helpless, and the great interest which is taken to educate the ignorants, by Your most Exalted j ana Benign Government, we dare to lay a few words for Your Honours’ perusal which would reveal the hardships and difficulties which our State Education has been destined to suffer* The hard blow which this country has received is of a very serious nature and sufficient enough for the deterioration of its sons* The result which these circumstances foreshadow is complete destruction* The bad state of affairs of which we are complaining, is not one of today’s or a recent one, but one which began last year when Sayyid Uthman and Sayyid ’Umar, the Head Masters of Muharraq and Manama Schools respectively, were deported and things were made over to Faiq Adham the Inspector of Schools* The said Inspector was appointed by the Bahrain Govern- . ment at a time when the education was flourishing and at its hei^it The first thing that he did, after his taking over, was to in troduce changes* and alterations in the system of teaching, which created a sort of misunderstanding between himself and the Headmasters. This was followed by mismanagement and want of discipline in the Schools. The Inspector requested the Bahrain Government for their deportation and they were deported according ly. The deportation resulted in a great protest from the teachers and students, who refused to attend classes. The students have gained nothing during the last year. During the summer vacation the Inspector went to Syria and brought teachers with him who are not trusted by the people, and consequently the number of students is one fourth of the last years number* ^-ne Moharraq School had 180 students last year but now there are hardly more than 47. The Government does nottake any interest and it pays no heed to our complaints, and we think that the Government does not know the miserable condition of the Schools. •He therefore request Y 0 ur Honour to give the matter your kind c onsideration.. and save us from the present state of affairs. If such a reformatory Government leaves the matter as it is, the result would oe greatly disappointing. The blame | would fall upon the shoulders of the British Government in the Persian Gulf, if Bahrain is deprived of the facilities of education which are common at other places. All Bahrainis are gteatly disappointed and they have no i other topic except this in their Majlis for discussion. Your ^onour mi.Jit presume that there was no such grief here otherwise there might have been demonstrations, but the fact that we are oppressed by the Government. The Shi'a sect is against the Inspector and they requested the Government for his removal, but a deal ear was in their lot. If the matter continues in the same ■ way Sunnis may join and you can imagine the result. That is the present condition of our Schools here. Me hope that Your Honour will be pleased to consider our grievances and settle the matter in a satisfactory way.

The Government is desirous of sending this young man, at its expense, to one of the Shia religious schools in Baghdad or Kerbala or Najaf. On completing his education Mohomed Saleh will probably work in the Shia Wakf depart ment and possibly, ultimately may become a Qadi. There are at present no suitable men for appoint ments of this description and I think it is essential that one or two suitable candidates should be educated- 2 - educated abroad; Iraq is the only suitable country for such education. 3.

''0 Ijjio Memorandum yS' With reference to your memorandum Mo* 895-6/18 dated 16th April 1937, regarding religious education for Mohomed Saleh son of Syed Adnan, I think the Shia school at Lucknow would be suitable for Mohomed Saleh son of Syed Adnan. I have seen him today and he expressed his willingness to go to India. He does not however speak English or Hindustani. Is it likely that Arabic is used in teaching at Madrasat al faizin? I should be grateful if enquiries could be made from the school. Mohomed Saleh is 19 years old, he has never been out of Bahrain and his education is slight. He knows a certain amount of religious history and has some knowledge of arithmetic and of religious law. He was educated partly at one of the Government schools and then by a local Alim. I think he is intelligent though* somewhat conceited.x_ It is desired that he should study moslem law, Islamic and modern history and mathematics, subjects which would fit him to work in the Shia Wakf department and eventually in the Shera Court as a Q,adi. Mohomed Saleh belongs to a respected family and is the son of a Shia Q,adi who died some years ago. There are at present no persons among the Shia in Bahrain capable of filling such appoint ments and if the experiment in the case of Mohomed Saleh appears to be likely to be a success the Government will probably wish to send two or three other young men to this or to similar schools.

Gan you obtain details about them, including ages and what previous education they have had? The Schools are due to open on 15th September and I expect to go on leave just about then. The Senior School was run mainly by Vallance himself who taught there and looked after the Boarding establishment. The matter of Schools is rather a problem this year as there is no English Director of Education and several of the foreign senior teachers are not coming back. I feel that Shaikh Abdulla is scarcely suitable to deal with details of a boarding School! I will do all that I can to get things running but I think it might be safer to suggest that the boys should not arrive till the end of Ramadhan. Yours sincerely, Captain R.D. Metclafe, Bahrain.

Dear Alban, I enclose a memorandum from Wakelin regarding the Muscat students. We are having exactly the same sort of trouble with them as we had with the Kowait boys when they first came here and I quite agree that their behaviour will have a bad effect on the other boys who are now all working and behaving well. I saw them myself the day they arrived and noticed at once that they did not seem to be able to speak English. One of them belongs to the Ruling Family of Muscat, I thought it had been decided that a 'com moner' was to be sent here and not a young Shaikh. Young men of that position always seem to be difficult. I think what the boys probably dislike is being subject to discipline and not being allowed to roam the bazaar at night. In Baghdad they lived out and there were no restriction on their private lives. The boys asked for pocket money and cash for buying clothes. I authorised Wakelin to advance them Rs.25/- each and to allow them Rs.15/- per month pocket money, as in the case of the Kowait students. This point has not been mentioned in the correspondence about them. I enclose a copy of the School time table, it appears to be a very reasonable programme. I should like to discuss the matter with you as soon as possible. I have no copy of Wakelin*s letter so will you please return it? Yours sincerely, / Major R.G-.E.W. Alban, O.B.E., H. B.

Muscat Students. Soon after the arrival of the Muscat Students I examined them in all subjects and found that apart from their English the standard of their education is rather higher than that of boys in the upper class of the Kulliyeh.Cn the other hand their English is no better than that of a normal boy in class 5 of the Manama Boys* School. I therefore decidea to put one in class 2 and the other two in class I. In no case wasethe ooy equal to the remainder of the class in English.The only subjects in which they in any way excelled were History and Geography. I have since received two letters from them.One asked for extra classes and extra staff.The other demanded them* I have seen the boys several times and have had long talks with them. They point out that they expected a ’ , i^alliyeh' , and not a secondary school of lower standard than the one they were attending in Baghdad, In addition to this they complain of the food,the beds,the general ^ conditions and the restricted life. In Baghdad they lived in private houses with all modern conveniences. The complaint about the food is that the rice is poor and that they will not eat Karachi rice. The beds must be of iron,carpets on the floors,proper bath rooms and more variety in the breakfast provided. The daily eggs must be brightened oy tomatos and porid&amp;e-and so on at great length. When these points are settled they will then be ready to discuss the special arrangements to be made for their classes’ We arranged a picnic on Friday last for all the Kulliyeh and hostel boys in which the Kuwait Boys readily took part. The Muscatis preferred to reiiiain in the Hostel. Last night I went along about 6. ^p.m. to see the arrangements for the evening meal. All the boarders cameGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. out to chat with me with the exception of the Muse at is. Even when the bell was rung for dinner they would not come out of their room hut sent word that they were not hungry. AP’ain this morning I have seen them and had a further talx with them but with little result. They have not as yet attended a single class, I am very concerned with the effect their behaviour will have on the other memoers of the Hostel:particularly the older members such as the Kuwaitis. We are not in a position to provide any more advanced instruction than we have at present.Their complaints about the food are groundless. The rice that we provide is the same as is used in the oetter homes of Eahrain. We can not entertain the idea of providing fancy breakfast foods.The meal we now provide consists if fried eggs, bread and sweet tea. Dejani,the House Master enjoys the same meals as the boys and prefers it to the food provided by the local hotels. The o.uly course open to us is to return them to Muscat, and that as soon as possiole, I regret having to ask you to do this but I fear the effect upon our own boys.

Dear Alban, With reference to telegram No. 2519 from the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Publicity Officer, Bahrain, a copy of which was sent to the Director of Education, Bahrain, Mr. Anwar Tamimi, Director of Education, Muscat, was not on the last up boat. The conduct of the Muscat boys has deteri orated. They have now been here for about 6 weeks living at the School but doing no work and setting a very bad example to the other boys by their behaviour and their insolence to those in authority. Today I discussed the matter with Shaikh Abdulla and Wakelin and we are of the opinion that the boys should leave the School at once. Shaikh Abdulla has suggested hiring rooms for them in Moharraq in a house where one of our masters is living and if these rooms are unobtain able Shaikh Abdulla has offered to put them in part of one of his own houses in Moharraq and to let them feed with his household. We think that they should return to Muscat as soon as possible, which is what they themselves wish to do, before they do any more harm by their bad example to the Kowaiti boarders and to the other boys who are living in the School. m Yours sincerely, Maj or R.

Their behaviour was most unsatisfactory and tnough they spent about two months in the School they^ refused to do any lessons. Eventually they were sent back to Muscat;. These boys had spent some time at School in Baghdad and their manners and behaviour cpnfirms my opinion that education in Iraq almost invariably produces unsatisfactory results. Boys trom Bahrain who have been educated or partially educated m Syria have not turned opt much better. The Secondary School has not been long enough in existence to become a regular institution and at present it is not a suitable place.for boys who have previously been at Schools in Baghdad or peyrout. Should any further applications be made to send boys from other Gulf States as boarders to the Bahrain Secondary School the Bahrain Government woul not accept candidates who have previously been in Schools abroad. Applications will only be accepted for boys from local Schools in theGuli States. I think it is necessary to make this decision m order to prevent any recurrence of the Muscat students affair. sent to P.R., Bushire, P.A. Muscat and P.A. Kuwait, for information. H. B.

I visited the Girls' schools in Manama and :,u:6.”'aq on Saturday March 14th and was very favourably impressed by the standard of education for girls reached in the State. We went first to the school in Manama, where the are about 150 girls. This school does net possess the advantage of a building specially designed for the purpose, and for tWs reason some of the class rooms are dark and not V'ry well ventilated, and there is not enough room to accommodate all the girls properly. One class has actually to be held in a room which is also the only passage between two parts of the school, and the constant passing and re passing is very disturbing. There are six classes here, and the children start to attend school about the age of six, but there is no Kindergarten proper owing to the lack of trained Kindergarten teachers. X visited each class and thought the standard of work good, but in almost every class more atten tion needs to be paid to neatness and cleanness. The weakest subject is arithm* tic. The needlework is very good, the girls take a great interest in this subject and produce excellent results, but here again they need to keep their work cleaner. Muharraq « The school in Muharraq occupies buildings specially designed for it, and most of the class rooms are light and well ventilated. The number of girls has increased very repidly and still more could be taken if there were room for them, -to Arab house standing in the compound is now being used as class rooms and these are dark aid rather stuffy. In this school there are two Kindergarten forms where the chil dren do their work on the Froebel system, and use apparatus specially made for them. English is taught from the third form upwards, but the children in the Kindergarten 1-ara the / letters »- 2 - letters of the English alphabet at the sane time as they learn the Arabic ones. The standard of work in both Arabic and English is good, but a little more care is needed in the pronunciation of the latter. In this school also the standard in arithmetic was not so good as in the other subjects. tShe needlework is excellent and the work clean and neat, and in the sixth form the girls arc also taught dress making. I was very much struck by the keenness and interest shown by the girls in both the schools, and their health seemed good except for the appallingj^high percentage of eye troubles. A nurse attends twice a week at Muharraq to dead with minor treatments and look after the general health of the girls. I think it would be an excellent thing to start girl guide companies and Blue Bird. Flocks in the schools, as this would give the girls an interest connected with the school apart from their actual lessons, and also encourage them to do more in the way of physical culture. Sd.

It is fat rly clear that anyone who has 3e arnt English according to the basic system will have to unlearn a good deal before he can proceed to an intensive study of the real language. For this reason I can only regard, it as a fairly easy method of acquiring a sufficient knowledge of English for simple working purposes.Ho. ot 136£ Office of the Mviaar to the Gov«rm jsnt.

Memorandum: - During the last two yoars it has become the practice of the Government Schools to charge for the tickets for annual school plays which are performed by the students towards the end of every term, the custom of having a school play every year is itself well established, I understand that the first one was given over twenty ymut&amp; ago. His Highness Shaikh Salman after discussing the matter with His hccellency Shalich Abdulla has come to the conclusion that it is not desirable to commercialise these performances, in which boys and girls of the Government Schools appear. Ho does not doubt that the various objects to which money from plays has been cont ributed in the past were laudable and suitable but he does not think it proper that parents and relatives oi the students at the schools should be expected to pay in order to see the annual school plays. Hi j Highness considers that ail parents of boys should h^ve the opportunity of attending the annual play of school where their children are bain ; taurht {I without being asked to pay for a tic&amp;et, other people who wish to attend can apply for tlcxets to the school authorities.is - 2 - Hi 3 Hlghneds doas not wish in any way to dis courage ‘the perforj&amp;in^; of plays, though h® does thinlc that it is a pity that so many should be staged within a few weeks of eachother.

Dear Sir: The Company is very much interested in the work being done by the Bahrein Government Department of Education in the Manama schools. It is the desire of the Company to help in the fostering of education in Bahrein Island, and it is considering the establishment of several scholarships. I have had the pleasure of visiting the Bahrein schools and have had several talks with the Director of Education, Mr. Wakelin, along this line. I understand from Mr.Wakelin that it costs approx imately Rs.1,000 per term to keep a boy in the Technical School, and Rs.960 per term in the Secondary School. It is tentatively proposed to establish four scholarships, two for the Technical School consisting of Rs.1,000 per term each, and two for the Secondary School, consisting of Rs.960 per term each. The money would be paid to the Bahrein Govern ment and administered by a suitable representative of the Bahrein Government, presumably the Director of Education, subject to the approval of a Committee which would be set up to supervise the plan. My idea would be that a Committee would be formed consisting of, say, the Financial Adviser, the Director of .Education, the Principal of the Technical School and the Manager of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. It would be the duty of this Committee to select the can didates who were to receive the benefit of the scholarships. The candidates for the ensuing term would be selected on the basis of - (a) scholastic attainment (b) financial need (c) character, and (d) general potentiality and/...2—Major T. Hickinbotiiam, Bahrein: June 28, 1944. and the candidates would be interviewed personally by the members of the Committee. Their progress in the schools would be followed, and if it were decided they were not pro gressing satisfactorily, the scholarship would be withdrawn during the term. It is understood that there would be no obligation of any kind on the part of the student to work for the Bahrein Petroleum Company upon completion of the schooling, and the granting of the scholarship does not obligate the company in any way to offer the student employment upon com pletion of his schooling. to the attention of the Bahrein Government and if accept able, the Company would be pleased to proceed with this plan. I would be pleased if you would bring this matter Yours very truly, Chief Local Representative, The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited. i'.j o • “’Oy Xv_&gt; J. wij-L i J.O.i V J.J A x 1 a 1 «J. i. ft, Xi. • ±ho 3rd July 1944.

B. M T s Political Agent, Bahrain. With reference to your endorsement No.1898-6/18 dated 3rd July 1944, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Chief Local Representative, the Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limited, the Bahrain Government much appreciates the Company’s practical interest in the education work and welcomes the suggestion that the Company should offer four scholarships in the Government Schools. Regarding the conditions governing the scholarships I agree to the suggestion made by the Chief Local Representative in his letter but I should like to propose that Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, who is the head of State Education, should be a member of the committee and I would also suggest that the scholarships should be for boys of Bahrain nationality. ^ The inclusion of Shaikh Abdulla on the 7 Committee would be regarded with favour by the public and I think if he was not a member of the Committee there might be some criticism and comment at his not being included among the members. There are now in the Government Schools a number of foreigners including Indians, Iraqi Jews and various other nationalities. It must be admitted thaif frequently these boys are more intelligent than the local boys but at the same time I see no reason for foreigners being given scholar ships in the local schools and I believe I am correct in assuming that the intention of the Company was to grant scholarships to Bahrain boys not to sons of foreigners who happen to be attending the local schools.
