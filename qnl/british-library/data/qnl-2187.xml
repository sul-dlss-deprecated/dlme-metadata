Cn receipt of your despatch No. 287 (S 2169/1421/93) of May 6th, I asKed Colonel Ward to let me know trie present position in regard to the small fleet of armed river vessels, the purchase of which is now being undertaken by the Iraqi Government Colonel Yard is the adviser of the Iraqi Government in this connexion and knows their requirements exactly. Yhile on leave in the United Kingdom last summer, he discussed the matter with competent shipbuilders and brought back detailed designs which were submitted to the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Defence. As a result, the Crown Agents for the Colonies were recently requested to call for tenders for the largest of the vessels mentioned in my despatch No. 118 of March 3rd last - a 150 feet quarter wheeler. Further consideration in the light of recent experience on the lower Eupnrates has, however, led the government to think that tneir immediate needs will best be served by their purchasing this year two of the smaller vessels listed in my despatch, and it is probable that the Crown Agents will be asked to modify their call for tenders accordingly. So long as Colonel Yard remains as Director he Right Honourable / Anthony Eden, M.C., M.j . , ®ic», etc., etc. etc.of the Port of Basra and Director of Navigation, there need be no fear of orders for vessels going to other than British firms or of vessels being acquired which are not of the latest pattern. In the circumstances, therefore, there would seem to be no point in reminding the Iraqi Government of the stipulations of Clause 5 of the Treaty of Alliance. 5. Incidentally, Colonel Ward informs me that the Prime Minister has now agreed to the ordering, through the Crown Agents, of a fourth dredger for the Pao Bar dredging service. The need for this vessel has long been felt and Colonel Ward assures me that, once it is in action, the Rookr. Channel will be safe against the heaviest floods. You are aware from his annual reports that, in the past, he has felt very great anxiety on this head. I have etc., (Sgd..)

(E 2169/1421/93) Sir, v/ith reference to Your Excellency's despatch No. 118 (258/5/36) of the 3rd March, regarding the intention of the Iraqi Government to form a small fleet of river gunboats, I transmit to you, for any observations which you may have to offer, the accompanying copy of a letter on the subject from the Admiralty. 2. while your despatch under reference does not report the intentions of the Iraqi Government in regard to the construction of these vessels, my attention has been drawn to paragraph 76 in the Intelligence Summary for February 1936 prepared by Air Headquarters of the Royal Air Force in Iraq, in which it is stated that the Iraqi Minister of Defence announced in the Iraqi Chamber of Deputies in the course of discussion on the defence estimates that orders had been placed with British shipyards for several armed vessels for use in Iraqi waters. 3. It is perhaps relevant to recall, in connexion with the proposed construction of these river gunboats, that sub-paragraph 2 of Clause 5 of the Annexure to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930 provides that His Britannic Majesty shall grant, whenever required by His Majesty the King of Iraq, all possible facilities for the provision of, inter alia , ships 'of the latest available pattern' for the Iraqi forces.

CAark Kerr to Mr. Eden.—(Received March 16.) (No. 118.) Bagdad, March 3, 1936. I HAVE the honour to report that the Iraqi Government are taking steps for the formation of a small river fleet. This idea may have been suggested to them by the existence of a Persian fleet with its base at Muhammerah, but I have little doubt that they have been brought to the point of action by their experience during the Euphrates rising in the spring, when two armed vessels, which were hastily fitted out by the director of the Port of Basra, rendered considerable assistance to the Government by their successful operations in and about the Hammar Lake. 2. Colonel Ward, who was asked to submit recommendations regarding the type of vessels required, informs me that the Government have now practically decided to purchase five vessels—one 150-ft. quarter-paddle-wheel vessel, two 100-ft. quarter-paddle-wheel vessels, and two 45-ft. motor-boats. The Inspector- General of the Iraqi army was consulted regarding their armament, which will be as follows :—• The 150-ft. vessel— One 3 7-inch howitzer. One 12-pounder gun. Two Stokes mortars with four mountings. Four machine guns. Each 100-ft. vessel— One 12-pounder gun in the bow. Two mortars with four mountings. Four machine guns. Each 45-ft. motor-boat— Two machine guns. 3. The cost of this fleet, which is estimated at 127,000 I.D., is to be spread over three years, and a draft Bill now before Parliament provides for the allot ment of 60,000 I.D. during the coming financial year. Colonel Ward informs me that this sum will meet the cost of the largest vessel and her armament, and that he is only awaiting the formal sanction of Parliament before calling for tenders. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have, &amp;c. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.P.Z. 1133/36 SECRET. EXTRACT PROM THE PERSIAN GULP INTELLIGENCE REPORT DECEMBER, 1935• 37* Iraqi Navy . The Port Director, Basrah (Colonel Ward) has stated that the future Navy will probably consist of one modified 'INDUS' class sloop and some river gunboats armed with one U-inch gun, howitzers and machine guns. He has prepared plans and specifications and, it is understood, has called for tenders. The construction of these ships awaits Iraq Treasury sanction.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001b1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2890</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001b1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2890</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 17/28 'Iraq.
