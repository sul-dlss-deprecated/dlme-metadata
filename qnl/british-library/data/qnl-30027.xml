We hove of course already informed you of our approval of the said Doctor, for what we saw of his good treatment to ourselves and our family and subjects. We were all grateful to him.

Muscat, the 18th May 1937* Sultan's request for services in muscat of Mr* Yemkenmardi, Subordinate Medical Service Officer* r- In accordance with your instructions given when at Muscat last month I am writing in to you regarding the request of the Sultan,expressed in the form of a recent letter to me, to be allowed to engage the services of Yemkenmardi in his private employment* 2# Yemkenmardi left for India in November 1936 on leave after having served some nine years as Sub-Medical Officer Agency Hospital Muscat. During the last few years of his service here Yemkenmardi succeeded in becoming very much persona grata with the Sultan who now wishes to engage him on deputation from his own Department, as his personal medical attendant* 3 # I understand that x^remner who at first thought some what highly of Yemkenmardi to judge from the remarks in letters he sent in to the Residency subsequently altered his opinion and submitted certain co ifidential reports on him of an unfavourable nature* No copies of these reports can be traced in the confidential files here but it is possible that no copies were even made and that the originals are The Hon'ble Lieut.Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, M.C.I.fi*, C*B*L*, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e*to be found at Sabzabad* 4. From what X saw of Yemkenmardi before his departure I cannot say X was favourably impressed. Shortly after my arrival in Muscat in oune 1935 Yemkenmardi was brought up in front of me for disciplinary action by his superior officer the Agency Medical Officer ( riasy) for gross insubordination • ^asy stated at the time and my subsequent investigations confirmed this y that Yemkenmardi had become mixed up in State politics and that to advance his own interests he was intriguing against hiaay and causing mischief and bad feeling between the Sultan and his officials and the Agency Hospital. X do not think it advisaole that Yemkenmardi should be allowed to return to muscat in any capacity. 5. Yemkenmardi has some eight ye&lt;~rs to serve before he becomes eligible for a pension from Government. Under the regulations ( article 418Cai of the Civil Service Hegulations) if he retires before the completion of his full period of service except in certain exceptional circumstances as laid down in Articles 426and 441 of Civil Service .Regulation which would not apply in this case a Government servant forfeits all claim to a pension. X do not therefore consider it in the least bit likely that Yemkenmardi would be so rash as to resign from Government service for the sake of taking on what would ue afterall a temporary employment undefc the Sultan terminable at short i notice and thus give up entirely the whole of the pension for which he has put in 23 years service. 6 . When Yemkenm&amp;rdi was granted his last extension in Muscat the Govenment of sombay, ( to the Provincial Service of which he belongs) while agreeing to a further period of service of one year stated that they would not be--3— .. &gt;• • be able to entertain any further request for the extension of the period of his deputation* I suggest that under the circumstances tkst it will not be necessary to refer the matter to the Government of ±ndia but that if you approve the iiultan may be informed that as already stated by them the uombay Government are not willing to allow Yemkenmardi to proceed again on deputation in view of the fact that he has already spent the long period of 9 years away from his own Apartment* A Yours sincerely,f ' ; 0 / i} &gt; ' * Translation of an undated letter from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman to the Political Agent, Muscat. Personal. My dear Friend, We have received your personal letter Ho. R-65 dated the 9th August 1937, from Ziarat, and have understood what you stated in regard to Our request for the services of Dr. Govind Balkrishna Yemkenmardi, that Sir Trenchard Fowle has asked you to reply to us that he does not consider it suitable for us to employ the said doctor and that he therefore asks us to choose another doctor. This is Our reply. We thank the Honourable Sir Trenchard Fowle for what he explained. But We you have already informed/both verbally and in writing that We have chosen this doctor only because We personally knew him for a long time when he was in Muscat, and because We have confidence in him and want his services for us personally. We want him always to be in Our attendance both in Muscat and when We move to any other place in Our territory. When Sir Trenchard Fowle paid Us his visit in the month of April last in Muscat We reminded him oW Our request and it is now about a year since it first was made. He at the time promised to ask the Government of India for the services of the said doctor, and did not suggest that it was unsuitable for us to employ him. Atthat time We made full explanations to him on the subject, and hoped that he would have approached the Government of India in this connection. We do not know mMjc any (other) doctors to selffct from, but we know Dr. Yemkenmardi intimately and we do not want to select another, as the matter concerns Us personally, and we ought to have confidence in whatever person We want to employ. Therefore,/!l - 2 - Therefore, I would request you to inform Sir Trenchard Fowle that We would be pleased if he could kindly reconsider what he has asked you to write to Us in your letter referred to above. We hope he will write to the Government of India, requesting them to lend Us the services of Dr. Yerakenmardi as soon as possible. Usual Ending.Confidential. D.O. No. C/94/36 30th September Iy37e Subjects Desire of Sultan of Muscat to employ the services of S.A.S. YemkenmaBdi. I forward herewith translation of a letter received from the Sultan on the subject of employing Sub Assistant Surgeon Yemkenmardi. 2 . During my last interview with the Sultan a few days ago I asked him if he had yet decided what matters he desired to discuss with the Viceroy on his visit to Delhi in November next* He replied that he was still considering the question ahd would inform me about it as soon as possible but added that one point he definitely wished to talM about with His Excellency unless in the meantime his desire was acceded to was his wish to employ Yemkenmardi. 3 . I presume tnat under these circumstances you will take up the matter with the Government of India. In this connection I have nothing further to add to my demi-official letter to Sir Trenchard Fowle No* 63 dated the 18th May 1937* I consider that the return of Sub Assistant Surgeon Yemkenmardi to Muscat in any capacity would have most unfortunate results and should not be permitted* MBwuau-i, Cwfoa,, I.C.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire*f OO^-PIDWTTAL, D,0.

Oaroe desires me to say that he has written to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe giving him briefly the facts of the ^emkenmardi case and making suggestions for a non committal reply, should His Highness approach the Viceroy on the subject. Tou should not at present say anything to the Sultan about the treatment which his case is likely to meet with at Delhi, or advise him as to whether he should or should not approach the Viceroy. 3• As regards a reply to His Highness* letter to yeu, you should write to His Highness saying that TT r. Saroe is concerned that His Highness is unhappy over this matter, but feels that the case having been dealt with by Sir Trenchard Howie, its further considera tion must await the permanent Hesident*s return.

Pear Sir Trenehari Foirle, fould you pleaee refer to your demi-official letter No.C/418 of July 4th 1938 on the subject of the Sultan's desire to obtain the services of Sub-Assistant' Surgeon Desai as his personal and State Doctor. 8 . I tooj£ the matter up as soon as possible both with the Sultan and Desai. A difficulty has however arisen over the terms. Desai declares firmly that he would not be prepared to accept the appointment for less than fis 500/- per mensem with free quarters and a month's leave yearly with passage paid to India. The Sultan cays that fis 400/- per mensem is the maximum he is prepared to give with free quarters and two months' leave every two years with passage paid to India. 3« Neither the Sultan not Desai seem inclined to compromise. As you stated in your letter quoted above that the matter was urgent I am writing to inform you of the situation in case you might think fit to approach the Government of India with a view to obtaining the services of some other Sub-AssistantSurgeon. Personally I rather think that Desai rates the value of his services somewhat highly and that a number of similarly qualified officers of his service would be only too glad to accept the terms offered The Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel Sir Trenchard Powle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,by the Sultan. 4 # I have informed the Sultan that in addition to the pay etcetra given by him to the officer appointed there would be his pension contribution which would be payable to the Government of India by the State. To this the Sultan said he was quite agreeable, and for this reason I think has fixed Rs 400/- as the maximum pay of the post. 5 # It is possible of course that after further consideration both parties may come to terms but I rather doubt it.

The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.Related matters covered in the correspondence include the following: the Sultan's initial request for the services of Dr Govind Balakrishna Yamkanmardi (spelling varies throughout the file), a former Sub-Assistant Surgeon at Muscat Hospital, now returned to India; the Political Resident's reluctance to approve the request, on the grounds of Yamkanmardi's apparent 'gross subordination' while previously employed in Muscat; a later request from the Sultan for the services of another Sub-Assistant Surgeon named Dr P B Desai; Dr Desai's unwillingness to take up the post in Muscat, on account of his wife's illness; Dr Yamkanmardi's acceptance of the post, via direct correspondence with the Sultan.The Arabic language material consists of correspondence between the Political Agent and the Sultan. There is no material covering the period 1939-1942.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Doctors</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Recruitment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003e1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
