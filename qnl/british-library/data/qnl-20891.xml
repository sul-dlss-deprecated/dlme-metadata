Mm of a promise made when here to give us his views. As it happened Major Cox had gone 'to .oahrem. Milborrow howver replied to me on May SIstrand this is an extract ' My idea of paying the Sheikh of lahrein the. tax of a dollar per oar,due by the divers,and m lieu ot same to receive from the boats a bag of shells for each dollar paid by us,is I think workable,but not this season(the tax for this season has already been collected) and it is my intention to arrange if possible for next season. If I do succeed in obtaining the Sheikh's sanction 1 tale it that the Residency will approve and not hesitate to support us. I sent his letter on to Major Cox at Shiraz and have just received an answer,of which I append a copy. I venture to send it you because Milborrow may ment/ion his i lans to you, as he is recommerlded by the Resident.

Bef ore next season(1909) probably before this season is over we shall doubtless hear their views on the question. I gathered from inquiries while at Bahrein that the Sheikh was apparently not levying any 11 dollar-per-oar 1 ' tax now-but in connection with that idea or any other likely to be effective we should be anxious ,where we legitimately could,to support Messrs G.P.&amp; Co. He will no doubt cbnsuf' Major Prideaux as to tne details of any local scheme which may seem likely to be workable,' I have replied direct to Milborrow as directed above. p,s- )'t~A ^ j—fx- ^ _ 'f t^_ o^r,(a ^ ^ curr^k 9</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002f0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/17</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002f0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/17</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File B/6 Shell Trade: Exporters of Shells'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1907/1918</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-04-18T00:07:51</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (22 folios)</extent><extent>The contents of the file have been arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest items at the front of the file to the latest at the rear.</extent><extent>Foliation: The file is foliated from the front cover to the inside back cover, using circled pencil numbers located in the top-right corner of each recto.

The principal correspondents in the file are the British Vice-Consul at Bushire, Herbert Chick, and the Political Agent in Bahrain, Captain Francis Beville Prideaux.In a letter dated 27 April 1907, Chick wrote to Prideaux, informing him that he had received news from Lynch Brothers of Basra, that the German firm Wonckhaus &amp; Company had monopolised the oyster shell export market at Bahrain, diverting the European market for the product (from which mother of pearl was derived) from London to Hamburg. Chick requested Prideaux to furnish him with a report on the industry, and the prospects for British commercial involvement at Bahrain. Prideaux’s reply to Chick, a typewritten report dated 3 June 1907 (folios 6-8, with preparatory notes on folios 3-5) describes the market at Bahrain, including volumes exported, the split between British, German and native traders, the prospects for future demand, and the reasons for German advantage in the market, including increased domestic demand and higher offer prices. Further correspondence between the two men in 1908 discusses the possibility of a duty payable to pearling ships for each bag of shells received, as a measure to thwart German dominance (folios 11-12, 13-14).The final item of correspondence in the file (folios 18-19) is a request from a T. Southwell of the Government of India in Calcutta, dated 8 October 1918, for a large amount of shells currently being held by the Agency in Bahrain, formerly owned by Wonckhaus and seized by the British after the start of the War. The shells are urgently required to cover an acute shortage in India, where they are used to make Bengal buttons for the Munitions Board.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Shell trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002f0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
