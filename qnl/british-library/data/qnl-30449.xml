Whilst there is still no evidence available to indicate (a) the precise identity of the Persian vessels or (b) that the capture of the dhow referred to in 'Poway's' signal of 14th June too* place in Muscat limits, the expressed anxiety of the Council of an infringement of territorial waters seems justified. 4. Whilst, in the absence of any valid plea of 'stress of weather', the present action of the Persian commander may be attributable to either ignorance of international custom and courtesies or to a mistaken idea of his sphere of authority, it would seem most desirable that the matter be brought to the attention of the Persian authorities con cerned in the shape of an energetic formal protest from the Muscat Government. 5. Such action would possibly have the desired effect of preventing a repetition of the incident both here and elsewhere on the Truoial Coast (whilst keeping ourselves in the background) and at the sams might afford the suitable&lt;3) i letter Ho. 160(B-1772/114/34) of l*th A^ril W33 to H.

On behalf of his highness, the Sultan of Muscat, * &gt;*cSi.re to enter emphatic protest against the action of this armed launch in using Muscat waters as a base for operations, in visiting a Muscat port without prior His Highness Mirza Moh&amp;med Ali Khan Feroughi Minister for Foreign Affairs. notification- 2 - notification, and in keeping a captured dhow under arrest in Muscat territorial waters, even though the dhow was a Persian one. 5. I have the honour to request that lour Highness will bring the facts to the notice of the competent authorities and will call for the explanations that the serious nature of these facts demands. I understand that during the period in question the 6 weather was uniformly fine and that the Persian vessels did not provision or water at Khassab, so that the encroachment can evidently not have taken place on the grounds of stress of weather or lack of food and water.

Passage and Anchoring of foreign Warships in territorial Waters. The question of innocent passage of foreign warships through territorial wateirs has already been raised in Point IX and +he Oovem^nents have furnished information on this point. Here, in addition, this question has given rise to a further request for information, stated as follows: 'Regulation of the passage and the anchoring in 'territorial waters of foreign warships. 'Penalties for non-observance of the local laws and 'regulations. Ri^it to require the ship to depart.' The reolies made by the Governments were as follows: GREAT BRITAIN. States are entitled to regulate the passage of foreign warships through their territorial waters and the anchoring of such warships therein. A copy of the Admiralt y memo ran dum containing the regulations to which foreign warships entering the territorial waters or ports of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are expected to conform is annexed. If a foreign warship fails to comply with the regulations issued by the authorities of the State whose ports or waters she enters, the attention of her commanding officer should be called to the fafct of such non-compliance. if failure is persisted in, the foreign warship may be required to depart.CONFIDENTIAL.

The likelihood of their taking action under the froclaaatlon would be Increased by the act of cancellation# which would draw their attention to an Instrument the existence of which they have otherwise probably forgotten. 3.

You will observe that the reply is a denial in toto and no attempt is made to raise any of the points of principle which the alleged action of the eustoas launch involved (aee, for example, your despatch No. 394 of September 36th, K 3609/114/34). 3. It is true thet there wms some uncertainty as to the identity of the customs launch, but it seems unlikely that the well of Kfcssseb would have fabrlooted the entire story. 4. If further evidence regarding the launch*a identity and movements can be secured, 1 suggest that 1 should communicate it to the Persian Government and ask for further investigations to be mads. My not# would have to add that the question of representations on behalf of Arab rulers had been, or would be, treated separately. 6.
