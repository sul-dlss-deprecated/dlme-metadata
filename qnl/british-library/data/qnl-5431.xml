Major Daly described this water supply as highly unsatisfactory and even dangerous for drinking purposes, but it is apparently the best that can be done without incurring great expense.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to Foreign and Political Bepartment letter No.F.231~li/31, dated the 16th November 1931. 2. The situation has been examined a'fresh. Actually it has been found that the Assistant Transport Officer of Quetta Division who worked out the original estimate of expenditure for pumping made a miscalculation at the time and calculated for 3001bs of wood to work the engine 4 hours daily, v/hereas the actual requirements are 600 lbs. Owing however to less water being i required in winter, His Britannic majesty 1 s vice-consul has contrived to keep within the limits of the sum sanctioned by using the pump for a lesser period daily, my attention was however drawn to the fact that a great part of the fuel was expended daily on heating the pump before actual pumping started. I therefore suggested that arrange ments be made to store the water and the pump be used - lessless frequently. Such arrangements can he made and water pumped twice weekly. The cost of this arrange ment will he Rs.125/- per mensem (assuming that the kran exchange does not further fluctuate). This however will not provide water for washing purposes etc., and for this purpose it will he necessary to fit small pumps to wells existing, the water from v/hich is ahsolutly unfit for drinking and cooking. The cost of these pumps is estimated at Rs.oSO/-. 3. It is therefore proposed to re-appropriate a sum of Rs.1400/- from C.2. Fay of establishments Zahidan Vice-Consulate to meet current expenditure till the end of the present financial year. It is- estimated that about .1270/- of this will he required for expenses of pumping and the balance will he available for purchase of the small pumps required. The amount by which the small surplus will fall short of the price of the pumps can he met from the Office allowance of the Zahidan Vice? Consulate. 4. In the event &amp;f the Railv/ay question not being settled the arrangements for next year will therefore entail a monthly expenditure of Rs.125/- The only alternative to this would he to instal further and larger pumps on subsidiary wells, the capital out lay on which would he about Rs.1200/- and then the water supply for drinking purposes would he highly' unsatisfactory and in fact, dangerous to the health of the inmates of the Consulate, over a prolonged period. 5. If the above proposal he approved I shall he glad to he informed, in order that the above re-appropriation he made by me. The sum of Rs.2400/- proposed to he hudgetted in statement part II B freshfresh charges for next year can, in accordance with the above arrangements he reduced to Rs.1500/- and in the event of the Railway being reopened the balance will at once be surrendered to Government.

Are there any other conditions which in your opinion might appropriately be attached to offer ?1953. Telegram R. No.39, dated 10th (reed 11th) July 1931. From Dodd, Tehran. To Daly, Duzdap. (Repeated to Foreign 100.) Your telegram of the 8th instant 62 last paragraph. Exact position is not clear to me but subject to view of Government of ^ndia I see no necessity to make any presents to Persian Government. If General Officer Commanding requires water can you not make provision for new pipes nnd supply water from British source conditional on guarantee of free water to our official buildings. Guarantee should be obtained in writing from competent local authorities before pipes are handed over and in view of possibility that latter may later call in question right of Vice-Consul to occupy buildings at Mirjawa these buildings should be enumerated in engagement, if possible in terms constituting an implicit^ acknowledgment of hi^ right to occupy them. t (N.

(Repeated Tehran 66.) . s Referring to your telegram 1725-S and to Tehran telegram 39(100 to India). Information given me by Railway was not correct:source and seven miles of pipe line are all in Persia. Number of pipes of requisite for repair known to Railway Department-I understand about 30 to 40 short; earthenware of little value. In return I shall stipulate tor (1) free water for houses which are now occupied by us and which have no other means (11) right to take a pipe across frontier for use of our levies at Fort near frontier which has no supply and which in my opinion should now be occupied for protection of road. If pipes not necessary (111; righo for levies to draw water at Mirjawa - see my letter No.327 sent to India 10th July. Awaiting your instructions whether to include condition(It) in negotiations and offer of pipes which should not be given until I have written to confirm condition which would be tacit acceptance of our occupation of buildings. General Officer Commanding must refer (11) but stated he would accept remainder on his own responsibility (N.,U.D. and Railway Dt.)No. 327 Camp Zahidan 10/7/31. From Major G.K. Daly C.I.B. His Majesty^ Consul Sis tan &amp; Kain To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India Foreign and Political Department Simla. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my telegram No 325 regarding the water supply at Mirjawa. The statement made in the abovementioned telegram, that the source of the pipe line supply was in British territory, was, I regret, inaccurate, &amp; was based on information supplied me by the Railway authorities. Having since seen the pipe line I am convinced that the whole supply lies in Persian territory. This important modification made it impossible for me to dictate terms as to the continuation of the supply. I learnt, however, that the G.O.C. was most anxious to maintain the pipe-line, but at a loss as to how to repair it. Having ascertained from the Railway authorities that the earthenware pipes intended for its repair are now lying at Dalbandin &amp; are of no great value, I told the G.O.C. that I would suggest for the consideration of the Government of India that these pipes be presented to the Persian Government on the conditions that - 1. The water required for our buildings at Mirjawa should be guaranteed, free of all payment. 2. That water for our levies at C^ileh Safid, just over the frontier should be given at Mirjawa, if required, either by delivery by camels or by means of a small pipe to the fort, should we desire to put one in. TheThe G*ChC. immediately replied that he could of his own initiative guarantee the continued supply of water to our buildings &amp; permission to draw water for Qileh Safid by camel* but that tne question of putting small pipe would require the sanction of his Government, but that if the matter be referred to him he would support all the proposed arrangements. Kow that traffic on the road between Mirjawa &amp; Kundi is likely to increase greatly &amp; will include the regular carriage of mails etc I would suggest that the former Levy post of &lt;iileh Safid should be reoccupied, as the road is at present very poorly guarded A: for a considerable distance is within easy reach of raiding parties from Afghanistan. It was because of the possibility of our reoccupying ^ileh Safid, that I thought it prudent to include its water supply in the conditions of our possible gift of the v^ter pipes to the Persians. In the agreement regarding the boundary at Mirjawa made in 1905 one of the clauses had been that the post at Pad aha (wnich is presumably another name for Qileh Safid) should be permitted to draw water at Mirjawa. If my proposals meet with the approval of the Government of India, I would suggest that His Majesty^ Charge d» Affaires at Tehran, might be asked to obtain the concurrence of the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the proposed arrangements at Mirjawa, since a purely local arrangement might be disputed at some future date. Doubtless the G.O.C. will have reported our conversation &amp; supported the proposals. On receipt of the Persian Governments consentv consent to the arrangement, &amp; with the approval of the Grovemment of India by whom authority might kindly be given to the Kailway Dept, to hand over the pipes lying at Dalbandin to my representative, I would arrange for the G.O.C. to oollect the pipes, at their expense, from Dalabandin. He has already signified his consent to transport the pipes, if presented. A oopy of this despatch is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, and to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Grovernment of India in Baluchistan, with special reference to the proposed re-occupation of the Fort at Q,ileh Safid for the protection of the road.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00009b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3593</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00009b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3593</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/32 'Duzdap (Zahidan): water supply; effect of the closure of the Duzdap railway'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1936</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-06-23T14:09:24</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (61 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 62; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns water supply issues related to damages to the Duzdep Railway pump.The file covers:water supply for the British official buildings at Mirjawa (Mirjaveh, Iran)water supply for the Vice Consulate at Zahidan: Government of India's proposals for meeting expenses in 1932-33.The file is composed of correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Government of India, the Consul at Sistan and Kain, the British Minister at Tehran, the Treasury, and the Vice-Consul at Zahidan.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consulate, Seistan and Kain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consulate</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Treasury</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>British</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomatic service</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Water supply</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00009b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
