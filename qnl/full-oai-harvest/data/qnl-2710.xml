The letter is a covering letter to an enclosed copy of another letter that was sent from Lewis Jones (American Embassy, London) to Lance F L Pyman of the Foreign Office on 11 May 1948. This letter concerns a report ('from a reliable source') that alleged that the Government of Russia had sent orders for the establishment of a network in the Middle East for the purpose of 'organising strikes, sabotage and technical accidents in American petroleum establishments in the Middle East'. The report named three individuals said to have been tasked with creating this network (Evssenko, Dimitry Ivanoff, and Boris Brodski) and claimed that they were currently in Beirut and headed to Cairo. The report also claimed that Ivanoff and Brodski were responsible for a strike at an Anglo-Iranian Oil Company station in Ahwaz, Iran in 1946. In the covering letter, Stewart states that there was no confirmation that they were the two individuals responsible for this strike.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000127#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000127#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
