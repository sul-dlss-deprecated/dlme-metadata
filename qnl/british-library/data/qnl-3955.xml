Consequent on representations received from these officers, oovernmert of India consider that abnormal rise in cost of living in Persia and Persian Culf and the fact that His Majesty’s Government have sanctioned to their officers ’Pormula* and other cost of living allowances for increased cost of living justify greater relief to Indian service officers stationed, m these areas. They,therefore, propose to grant to their officers in rersia and Persian Gulf, a local compensatory allowance, which will be in addition to existing war allowance, on following terms with effect from the 1st July 1944, the date from which the war allowance has been given to officers in india, up to end of September 1946;- Married officers with families residing in stations of duty Married officers whose families reside elsewhere at 17*% at 10% on first fe.1500/ of pay irr espective of total pay. unmarried officers at 7*% on first &amp;.1000/ of pay irr espective of total pay. further continuance of this allowance, in part or full, will be subject to review of position with regard to cost of living in different localities concerned. 3.

As income tax concession will result in benefit under your scheme being not markedly less than that intended to be granted under ray scheme I am prepared to accept your proposals as regards percentage increase* 3 , As regards question of retrospection, it seems to me that as original grant has been shotfn to have been inadequate Services can reasonably argue that they ' Should not be required to bear consequences of miscalculation by Government and mistake should be corrected with full retrospective effect. In case of higher Services a large part of arrears might be expected to be used to clear overdrafts, meet debts and replace savings already used.up. and risks arising in respect of low paid Services can be considerably reduced by spreading payment of arrears over suitable period.

IMPORTANT 1942* Your telegram No*5928 dated February 19th* War allowances* Our proposals for your Services formed Part of a general scheme of revision of war allowance and dearness allowance which we would find it very difficult to alter. To discriminate in favour of the Secretary of State’s officers would not De justified on economic grounds and would 'be impossible politically. 2. Our proposals would have increased cost in respect of all your officers from present 5 lakhs per annum to gpout (? 9 lakhs) Your proposals would increase cost to 21 lakhs. This hy itself not serious hut effects on cost in respect of all Central Government servants would he embarrassing and would give more than we consider justified in present circumstances to those on lower pay rates* Present cost to Centre of all war and dearness allowances including railways approximates to l 3 i crores per annum* Our proposal \vould have raised this hy about 9 crores to which your proposal would add a further 5 crores* There would also he heavy increases in cost to Provinces^ 5 * y/e fully agree with principle enunciated in your paragraph 2 * In framing our original proposals we took account of the fact that new income tax proposals for differentiation between earned and unearned income will give some relief to your officers* V/s consider combined effect of this and our proposed increase in war allowance will give adequate relief which is in fact not much less than would be given on your scale if no relief were to be given in income tax. On this basis difference in net benefits between our scheme and yours, varies from Rs.25 per mensem to Rs*33 per mensem between Rs.500 per mensem and Rs*l,000 per mensem if no overseas pay drawn and between Rs«23 and Rs.12 if overseas pay is drown. Above Rs*1,000 per mensem differences are still less. 4 » If retrospective effect to July 1st 1944 were given in case of your officers it would be impossible to withold similar concession from Central Government servants drawing present war allowance. In turn we should either hove to give similar retrospective effect' to revised dearness (V omission) to low paid servants or face great discontent with agitation from labour unions. Expenditure involved would obviously be heavy and would embarrass both Centre and Provinces while to place at one time several crores of rupees in the hands of low paid servants would be highly infla tionary» 5.

The Government of India have already sanctioned an increase of Rs.ljS^OO® (£ 112 . 10 . 0 ) to cover the cost of repairs to the Shiraz Consulate buildings (Ext.4131/44 flagged in attached file). Essential repairs to these buildings will have to be carried out eventually and further delay will only result in their further deterioration, while there seems little likelihood of any reduction in the cost of labour and materials in Persia in the near future. The proposed increases which altogether (but excluding the grant to Shiraz) amount to Rs.34,700 (£2,602.10.0) are non recurrent. Since the expenditure is divisible between Imperial and Indian Revenues and is more than £1,000, the amount which, under the present arrangement^,the Government of India can sanction without reference to H.M.G., a draft letter to the Foreign Office is submitted. 0 . i^dZocA^ Financial Secretary AQcountant Genera l for concurrence or any observationsNo. 18(11)-E/43. , . - ■ GonfidentiaL By l^ast Air %il 3 Fr ( bm To The Secretary to the Government•of India in the External Affairs Department, a &gt;*/^ 2969 The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, London, i 1 943 Dated Simla, the /t/7A May 1943.

The ilon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf represented that the cost of living in the Persian Gulf and Iran had increased tremendously on account of the conditions created by the war and the grant of relief, by way of a dearness allowance, to the clerical establishment was a matter of urgent necessity. Also that it was difficult for him to find personnel on the existing emoluments resigned and it was . . . unless relief was granted immediately. On the basis of the comparative statement, furnished by the Political Resident, of prices of essential articles of consumption at the commencement of the war and in the autumn of last year, at the various places at which the ^ ■ staff are stationed, the percentage increasesiLn cost of living per head ipvar that in 1939, works out to be a^out 150 to 260/ The P^plitical Resident also reported that Foreign Office had sanctioned liberal rates of dearness allowance (at 170% since June 1942 and at 200% since February 1943 for Munshis) for their- low paid staff in Iran with effect from June 1942. He recommend-- ed the grant of dearness allowance to the staff in question at the following scales with effect from 1st August 1942:- Area. 1 . Percentage of dearness allce. calculated on pay, special pay and all allowances excepting customs compensatory allce. 2 . 3.

The Government of India will remember that for 16 months prior to his arrival the Persian Gulf Independent Sub-division had been left in the charge of the Secy. who had no technical training whatsoever and a supervisor who had been promoted from the rank of draftsman* It is not tnerefpre surprising that during that period many repairs etc*, were either carried out inefficient ly or were left undone and it is only now that we are beginning to collect sufficient technical staff to ascertain the full arrears of essential work, 3.

I have endeavoured to avoid ask ing the Crovernment of India for a large increase in the Residency Central Contract Grant but for the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs I can no longer do so. The construction of new quarters for the greatly increased clerical staff, of new garages for the recently sanctioned Govt, vehicles and the placing of the house rented for the Vice-Consul under the administrative control of the P.,t/.D, have all added considerably to the expenditure under Central Contract Grant, In explanation of the reference to the Vice-Consul 1 s house it must be remembered that no Persian landlord will ever lease his house unless the leasee~ agrees to bear the cost of all minor repairs painting, whitewashing, etc*, and in particular the fitting of wire-gauze to windows and doors. Wiregauze is a particularly heavy demand on Central Contract Grant and at the beginning of the year 107 rolls were ordered through the Government of India. In their telegram Nq. 465 N dated the 27th March f 1944 Government of India informed me that ' r its cost would be 1*5*13.915/' and during the last few days they have stated in their telegram No* 1336 ME dated the 22nd August 1944 that its cost has risen to therTahtastic figure of te ? 32,86l/~. Part of this wiregauze has % to be paid for fuft^my Central Contract Grant amounting to Rs.30 # 100/- out of which only fc.21,2O0/' have been allotted to Bushire. 5. I therefore request that the Central Contract Grant allotment for the Persian t Gulf for the current year be increased to fc.54 f 300/' which is the minimum sura which will cover essential repairs. It will be obaerv ed that this will be only 200% of the pre-war grant whereas Shiraz has already been given an increase of 389/T while the cost of materials in P.T.0./Extracts from Express Lettet* No•1803*^60/42, dated the 3rd November, 1943, from Britconsixlr Bushin to Foreiffn, New Delhi, Despite the strictest economy having been exercised the sanctioned budget estimates of this Residency for the current financial year under B«5«Oth er Charges ^ have proved to be inadequate and it has oeon found necessary to apply fer the following additional grants X X X X x XX 6. CENTRAL -GQNTBAGT OR AI^T^ The present allotment of fe*18|100/- which is based on 2% of the capital cost of the buildings is now quite inadequate. Out of this allotment, reallotments have been made by this office as below Shiraz ,, Kerman *, Bandar Abbas Kuwait Khorramshahr Bus! lire fee 1,500/- Rs, 900/- Rs, 1,200/- Rs. 3,500/- Rs. 300/- Rs. 10,700/- V-3L Vide Government of India 1 s telegram No•73-A/0agp dated the 7th July, 1943-^a further Rs, 1,500/- has to be provided by re- appropriation for Shirag Consulate, 7, Wliole of the allotment of Rs,10.700/-(for Bushire) was spent during the 6 months ending 30th September 1943, and a further sura of not leas than IS*10,500/-will be required to meet the cost of ordinary and urgent repairs to the Government buildings in Bushire alone. The /t4 reason for the additional expend!tureZ,in the phenomenal rise in wages and cost of building materials, For instance a carpenter who was previously paid Rials 30 per day now will not work for less than Rials 100/-. Similarly a mason who used to be paid Rials 15 now receives Rials 50 per diera,. The wages of unskilled labour have reached fantastic^heights and cooLiesnow receive 500S more than they did in 1939, Cost of paints, varnish, cement, gach, wood and in fact of all building materials has risen and is still rising and the extra amount required, vis fe, 10,500/* is the lowest possible figure that can be given. The offices subordinate to Bushire are expected to ? ut in supplemen^ry demands as they also are suffering rum the great rise in wages and cost of building materials, Shiraz has already applied for its allotment to be doubled and demands on this scale are likely to be made by all other sub-offices.a ri L£ No. 35/393. 1 I V J i ■ y| The Secretary ot the Governneiit oi 1 India in External Affairs Department, S p 4 Subject:- Liveries for inferior^eataBIishment of 3 ^ .

While I was examining tue problem of ^ranting further relief to t*k manial staff Utie porfsition suddenly det riora - ed owing to the Persian Crovernment sanotion^ng very consider able increases in ^y for their inferior eatablisnment. The dskx minimum pay of a newly joined Persian Government Farr six is now Rial** l, 0 u 0 /-,i.e. double tne pay drawn in November 1943, by the senior Residency FarrtiSh-baahi who has 31 years’ loyal service. In order to avoid mess resignations, i as obliged to revise the scales of pay of the Residency menial establishment with effect from the 1 st December, 1943. Details of their old and new 3 c?des of pay are given in the enclosure. It will be observed tnat I ha ve discarded the old basic rites of pay which are now meaningless and have divided a man ini* a total emoluments in f o basic pay and ra dons. (Althou^i the ' purchase and issue of rations involves a great deal of time and labour it has been found by experience that it has a steadying effect upon Residency employees.) The current pur chasing value of the rial now bears no relation to its v.uue prior to 1941. and it is most improbable that the rial will over return to its old value. For some time past the rates of pay for Residency menials have been noticeably lower than those offered elsewhere in Bushire and ’Khuziatan*, but it is hoped tli&amp;t the revised re*.tea will prevent rxtKS further resignations tho it will be aeon that there are still .dim plenty qf better paid posts in other local oqncer&amp;a. The *8 Government of India may rest assured that as soxn aj ^age xxto mtea decrease in Buanire tiie pay and rations of tiie rieoicency menials will be aiailarly reduced. 7 .as question is constantly unaer review since we are now compelled to pay our private servants vastly increased wages toge her v/itfi free rations. 4. The ttddiiSHxl additional expenditure involved for the current financial year will t&gt;e 3 - 1214 li0 f Z - *~f ! I a flat rate of &amp;. 10 /per head for the menial aatabliah- menta of the Politioal Agencies at $&amp;h r ai.n and Kuwait. It appears that this method of granting relief was de cided upon as a result of the Sheikh of Kuwait granting a similar allowance to his servants. Since September 1943 the menial staff at both Agencies have found it impossible to live on their emoluments. In order to avoid resignations on a large scale I have sanctioned dearness allowance as follows Bahrain — 40 per cent basic pay. Kuwait — 50 per cent basic pay plus a free issue of §7 lbs. wheat. It was essential to grant greater relief to the menial establishment at Kuvrait where there had been a marked and steep rise in the cost of living. 2. The approximate additional expenditure involved at Bahrain and Kuwait together during the current finan cial vear will be Ks.3,300/-. This sum will, as far as possible, be met by reapproriation and in the event of tine existing grants being insufficient the extra sum required will be included in the statement of savings and excesses.

In May 1943 the Government of India sanctioned, subject to the concurrence of H.M.G., increases in the scale of Dearness Allowance granted to the clerical staff of the Persian Gulf establishment. These increases had been recommended by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the grounds that the cost of living in Persia and the Gulf was rising rapidly owing to the war and that it was extremely difficult to find personnel for temporary war-time appointments or to recruit staff to fill permanent posts on the existing emoluments. The Government of India later increased the allowances in the case of Kerman, Bushire and Khoramshahr. These increases were sanctioned by H.M.G. in December 1943* The Government of India now request the approval of H.M.G. for further increases in the Dearness Allowances which have been sanctioned by them at the following rates:- With the exception of Bahrein, the cost of which is borne wholly by the Government of India, the expenditure involved is divisible between Inqperial and Indian Revenues. In a note at EXT.2969/43? the Financial Secretary advised that the grant of Dearness Allowance should be regarded as one measure and should not be considered as separate grants to individual persons. The rule under which the Government of India may sanction diplomatic and consular expenditure up to the limit of £1000 at each post does not, therefore, apply in this case, and it is necessary to obtain Foreign Office concurrence before approving their action. In view of the rising cost of living in this area which is fully borne out by the Intelligence Summaries from the various posts, and of the increasing competition in recruiting staff for the expanding services in the Gulf owing to the war, the increases in Dearness Allowances would appear to be justified. ?

Cost of living at all posts h&amp;s again risen since I made my last recommendations for dearness allowance in August 1943 and at several posts prices heve shot up suddenly to great height.

This graph, however, no longer indicates full increrse in cost of living since prices of every day necessities have during last six months increased even more th«n prices of foodstuffs Owing to export prohibitions and restrictions imposed by the Government of India articles such as toilet requisites, shoes, clothing, etc. are now only obtainable at famine prices.

A revision of the basic pay of the menial establish ment of this Residency has long been overdue; and tie continued decline of the purchaaing power of Persian currency vis-a-vis the rupee (which the dearness allowance granted in March last ^'ould only temporarily palliate) had eventually reduced our . iy could not, arrord to give 3. -jx family a ration( on which the calculations in para.3 are based) ponsiderably inferior to that of an Indian Army sepoy. In fact u . if the‘Residency had not. so far, been able to procure them a monthly ration of wheat from the Persian Government, they would have been s ub si sting on dates alone. Even bread and dates are no better than a prison diet. 3. As illustrations of this point* I give the cost the various years in which the wage scales nave been revised, of this minimum raiion for a family of five persona :- laaF Cost in Rials 1939 . • ... ' 62.40 1931 .. 72.60 1938 • • .. 162.90 1939 .. .. 230.10 1942 •. • • 456.60 It will be noted that this is not merely a wartime phenomenon, as the figures for 1939 decnonstrate that the cost of living was then greatly increased 'over the previoos year. 4* It will also be noted that, although the rial was 440 to the 100 rupees in 1930 and Rials 605 in 1938, whereas it is now 984, its purchasing power has fallen far more than the exchange rate has risen. Although one gets 2i times as many rials for one's rupee now than in 1930, the rials one gets buy less than a seventh as much goods. 5. This matter had been under consideration for some time when the position became acute through a strike on the part of a considerable section of the ^section of the menial establish ment. . w • * Retrospective, sanction is therefore sought to revision of the basic wage rates of the menial establishment from 1 st January 1943, which has in fact already been granted. The additional cost will nornElly be fe.250/-p.m.; out while the war allovyance is in force, it will be &amp;.350/-p.m. The necess ary addition may kindly be made to my- contract grants under B-5-0ther Charges. The additional amounts required for January to March 1943 were obtained by re-appropriation. oia tTTEH : £ /v fcD ■ y- rb'Upovsa •on Jopy of Memorandum No^lBC^J-HV^, dated New Delhi the 20th August 1943, from the Under 3ecy. to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department to’ the Hon f bla the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Previous papers :— 4136a 1000 10.35The Government of India’s letter below informs us that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had submitted proposals to them for the grant to the clerical establishment in the Persian Gulf of dearness allowances on account of the very great increase in the cost of living. The scales of allowance recommended by the Political Resident are set out in paragraph 2 of the Government of India’s letter. As he had represented that it was urgently necessary to afford relief to these members of his staff, the Government of India sanctioned his proposals, provisionally and pending approval by H.M.G., for the period from August 1st, 1942, to June 30th, 1943. They estimate the additional cost involved at some Rs.76,800 (£5,760) a year, (including that in respect of permanent staff at Bahrein and Muscat, the cost of whfcjt* is not divisible but is borne entirely on Indian Revenues). The Government of India ask for the sanction of H.M.G. to the Political Resident’s proposals. 2. Our papers do not show that any previous action has been taken with a view to increasing the emoluments of the Persian Gulf clerical establishment on account of the higher cost of living due to the war. 3. In a note which will be found below the draft, the Financial Secretary advises *0 -*bhc eo-k that the Government of India’s proposals cannot properly be regarded as covered by the rule under which they may sanction, without reference to K.M.G., diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf up to a limit of £1,000 at each post. Before the Secretary of State approves the Government of India’s action, therefore, it will be necessary to obtain the concurrence of the Foreign Office. A draft letter for this purpose is submitted, which makes it clear that we propose to authorise the Government of India to continue these allowances after the end of the period for which they have been sanctioned by the Government of India, and which has already expired. 4. Please see also the similar case of dearness allowances for the subordinate staff of K.M.

The Government of India have sanctioned, provisionally and pending approval by H.M.G., the grant of dearness allowance on the scales recommended by the Political Resident and shown in paragraph 2 of their letter, for the period August 1st 1942 to June 30th 1943. 3. The Government of India estimate the additional cost involved at about Rs. 76,800 (£5&gt;76o) a year. This covers expenditure at - (a) Bushire, Bandar Abbas, Kerman, Khorramshaii^Koweit and the Trucial Coast, the cost of which is divisible between Imperial and Indian revenues; and (b) Bahrein and Muscat, the cost of which is wholtly borne by the Government of India. 4* Since February 1942 the Government of India have had the power to sanction, without reference to H.M.G., diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf up to a limit of £ 1,000 ^F. 10 248/431)* I believe that this limit refers to the amount which may be sanctioned at each individual post . Since the action taken by the Government of India in this case applies to six posts where expenditure is divisible, it appears that they would have been justified in themselves according final sanction. If you agree with this interpretation of the^ule, we might inform ,the Government of India accordingly, without referring the idatter to the Foreign Office (though a copy of the correspondence wbuld be sent to them). The Government of India will then be anle to arrange for the continuance of these allowances after the end of the sanctioned period, which has already expired. 5'.

(7.0, hi' Ti With reference to India Office letter PZ 2551/41 of the 12th June concerning the office allowance assigned to His Majesty^ Consulate-General at Bushire, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that a copy of this correspondence has been submitted to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury with the request that Their Lordships may sanction the payment by His Majesty’s Government of one half of the increased office allowance expenditure at Bushire which will result from the increase proposed in the salary of the clerk at that post. 2. With regard to the question of the financial responsibility for this post, Mr. Eden is unable to agree that the fact that the post of the consular clerk was created by the Foreign Office, and that the clerk’s salary was raised in 1932 without prior reference to the India Office, is in any way relevant since the financial &lt; arrangements relating to the office allowance at His 1 Majesty’s Consulate-General at Bushire were revised in ■“*1934. Mr. Amery’s attention is drawn to the semi official correspondence concluding with India Of!ice official letter PZ 6428/34 of the 30th October, 1934. It will also be observed from India Office letter PZ 7834/ 36 of.the 24th November, 1936, that the amount of the office allowance was then assessed by the Government of India, the Foreign Office being subsequently required J»The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. r* KECd.

In 1923, when the present Consular Clerk was appointed, his rate of pay was fixed be the Foreig st Rials 550 u - per mensem whici?, at the* rate of exchange oi Rials 3.65 to the rupee then existing, represented approximately Rs.l50/- per mensem. 3, . In 1932, in order to meet the increased cost of living the ay of the Consular Clerk wa^ raised from rials, 550/- per mensem to Rials 750/- in addition to which he was also given a small allowance and bonus sc that his total emoluments amounted to Rials 1,100/- per mensem at wmch rate he had been paid ever since. Though this coubted his salary on paper, actually, owin : to the fall in the purchasing power of the rial, the efiect of this increment was.merely to place his financial position on the same footing as it had oeen in 1923 when he was first recruited, end, as the rate of exphange had dropped from Rials 3,65 m 1923 to Rials 7.47 m 1932 the cost of his salary to Government still r emained at Rs.lDO/-, Between 193^ and 1940 there have been many variations in the rate oi exchange and, though the Iranian Government's control oyer the sale or foreign exchange kept tna rate as low as Rials.6 to the :upee fop some time, the post of living has gteadily increased.

In view, however, of the Foreign Office’s known objections to paying the salaries of locally engaged staff in anything other than the local currency, I would recommend, for your Lordship’s consideration, that the Consular clerk should in future be considered an employee of the Government of india, and that the Government of India should be empowered to sanction any alterations in the rate of his emoluments.

It will be observed that the Foreign Office take the view that 'the question of the clerk's salary is one for the Government of India to decide and His Majesty's Consul General should accordingly refer it to them ,, . I therefore trust that the Government of India will now accept the position that this clerk is subject to their control, and will consider hie case on its merits. The possibility that he may again have to work under a Foreign Office Vice Consul is for the time remote. Fven were he to do so, the resulting anomaly could scarcely be greater than that existing already; for this clerk, occupied though Ae2. he is with subjects some of which are of no leas concern to the Government of India than to the Foreign 01lice, is the only employee in the whole Residency and Consulate General who is not under the Government of India.

In addition, it is a fact that employee a of the Oil Companies who show more than ordinary ability have many opportunities of rapid advancement to eoales of pay far beyond those which even the ablest of Government employees could hope to attain* 5* In these circumstances, it is obvious tnat unless steps are taken to improve the rates of pay now offered to our Vernacular Cadre the time will oome when not only will it be impossible to reoruit new candidates, with the exception of those who have been rejected by the Ml Companies, but it will be difficult to retain even the clerks already serving in our present lower grade appointments* 6* To remove this danger and to render the conditions of servloe sufficiently attractive to enable us to compete with the Oil Companies I make the following proposals* / The3- Th« present soheme under which the appointiaente on the Vernacular Jadre are divided into three eeparate divieione, / special grade, upper division and lower division, each on a distinct scale of pay, should be abolished, and in future all clerks not serving in a special grade appointment should be included in a single grade on the time scale Ks*120*6*240, plus Gulf allowance and house rent on the scales shown in the attached proposition statement, and, in the case of those clerks serving in Iran, a custoaa compensatory allowance of He«i5/*« This will not only make the time scale more attractive but will have the advantage of facilitating tranafers, which have been oromped by the exiatenoe of on upper and lower division* 7, It will be seen from the proposition statement that there arc at present three clerks serving in the upper division on ths time scale Re.120*6*150*10*250 and it is presumed that, should sanation be accorded to the nsw time sole, they would be permitted to continue to draw their increments on the old scale, since to include them in the new scale would involve them in a lose of pay* 1 am aware that any proposal a for Increased expenditure are likely to be unwelcome at the present moment, and have oast about for some means of reducing the cost of these proposals* At ths same time, I am most reluctant to recommend anything which will diminieh the already meagre prospects of the Vernacular Cadre* In order, however, to bring about the deeired improvements, I am prepared to reduce the existing special grade appointment of Arabic Munshi, Bush ire, to the proposed nsw time soals* 3y this means the total average extra cost to Government of the scheme would ultimately amount to no more then He*1090/* per annum, while even assuming thst the three upper division / clerks* 4 * 1940 J oX«rk« continue on their present scalee of inoreBient 9 the israediate effect of the scheme would result in a slitjht saving to Government due to the reduction In the pay of the * Arabic iunehi* 8« I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosure by air to His H&amp;jeaty** Secretary of State for India t and would be grateful if aanotlon to the proposals could kindly be conveyed as early as possible* £j m v. 5344 X have the honour to bs 9 Sir* Tour most obedient servant* sd.

There is, moreover, another reason for not alien4ting the custom of the Iranian subscribers; the protection of trie line, which carried the current over several miles of country, ca.inot be ensured without idle goodwill of the local aub-ioritres, Said especially of the ^olice* Cince, amon^ others, the officials of the Police Department vould suffer considerable inconvenience through the cessation of the Residency supply, anu since moreover this would in the^r opinion be due to mere lack of consideration on the part of the Residency, they could hardly be expected to devote much attention to steering for the Residency the full enjoyment of benefits which they themselves were not privileged to snare; and while indeed they have no clai whatsoever to share in these benefits, it is clear that if deprived of them they are both able and ready to diminish their value to the Residency by permitting, if not by actually conniving, at damage to the lire* is an example of tae extent to which the Residency is dependent in this respect on the goodwill of the local administration it may be remarked that curing tiie past few days when the Governor of Bushire, who is himself a private consumer of current from the Residency plant,has been seriously considering the alternative of ceasing to use our current, should we not agree to reauce the rate now charged, it has been necessary to ask him to take specially stringent measures to protect the main power line from which considerable lengths of wire have recently been stolen, 6, I have, therefore, the honour to recommend that for cnarges paid by Iranian subscribers, a flat rate of Rials 5/- per unit should be sanctioned irrespective of the rate of exchange, A timely decision to this effect will not only preserve a useful source of income which will otherwise be lost, but muld also assist in retaining the ^Lodwill and cooperation of the local authorities, without which it would be cifficult to maintain our own supply#Telegram No. 34-i(Cam0) f dated 30th April 1 From - Foreign, Simla.

We agree to the transfer as proposed, having ascertained that the Treasury will raise no objection. They do, however, suggest two conditions and we support them in this because we think the conditions are entirely reasonable in the circumstances. They are: (l) that the Iranian authorities shall continue to run the system as at present and maintain it in a state of efficiency; (2) that the Iranian authorities should undertake not to increase without proper justification their charges in such a way as seriously to reduce the estimated saving of/ J.P.

Bushire telephone system was taken over by the Government of India from the j War Office in 1925 for the sum of Rs.3,500. A moiety of this sum was recovered from the Foreign Office by inclusion in a claim for £9,243 in respect of expenditure in connection with Indian | troops serving in S. Persia preferred in | this Office letter dated 19th October, 1925 / No. A.G.11969/25. There appears to be no information on record in this Office regarding the offer stated to have been made to the Iranian Telephone Coy. in 1929. 3. From correspondence received from the Government of India in 1936 regarding the secret service and toohakhana expenditure of the Residency (vide correspondence sent to you with 1.0. letter of the 23rd September, 1936, No.P.Z. 6460/36) the information is gathered that in 1934-35 the expenditure on the maintenance of the telephone/ 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38f telephone installation amounted to about Rs.1,400. It appears from the Government of India s telegram under reference that despite such charges as may have to he paid for telephone services to the Iranian authorities a saving of Rs.800 per annum in the office allowance of the Residency is anticipated as a result of the suggested transfer. Having regard to this circumstance and to the presumably low capital value of the telephone system at the present time Lord Zetland v/ould propose for hie part to agree with the Government of India that the proposal for the transfer of the system may be accepted on the understanding that the Iranian Government will continue its operation, and I am to enquire whether Lord Halifax concurs in this view. c (Sgd.)

In fact he thinlcs it would be difficult to resist Iranian request. 4. We estimate that we could surrender permanently from Office allowance Rs.800.

As regards the presents delivered by these representatives for Sir Miles Lampson and Mr. Teichman, to telegram. Sir John Simon would suggest that, as it would clearly be impossible to return the presents to the Panshan Lama without causing great offence, the presents should be held at the disposal of the Government of India. 3. I am to request, therefore, that Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare may be so good as to enquire by telegraph of the Government of India whether this suggestion is agreeable to them and, if so, what are their wishes as regards the disposal of the presents and whether they share the view of Sir John Simon that a presentation should be made to the Panshan Lama in return. S 4. In that case I am to invite suggestions as to what form the presentation should take. Sir John Simon assumes that the Government of India would be prepared to detray its cost. If it were agreeable to the Government of India, the presentation could be made at Peking before the ianshan Lama leaves for Mongolia.

Cft 0-, I have the honour to request that the allotments of Rs.2,700/- an d Rs. 4,000/- for the Secret Service and Toshakhana expenditure of this Residency included under the Head *Bushire C.6 Contingencies - Office Allowance* may he supplemented hy an additional grant of i&amp;.4,500/- and x*. 1000/- respect!vely. 2. The reasons for the additional expenditure, part of which has already been incurred, are as follows: (a) In my letter No.1039-3, dated the 8th November 1934, an additional grant of £s.5,500/- was asked for under Secret Service and Toshakhana for the financial year 1934-35. The Government of India sanctioned a total additional grant of ks.9,900/- under 'Office Allowance' of which Rs. 2,742/- only was utilised to cover excesses under Secret Service and Toshakhana, the remainder being used to meet excesses caused by the fall in the exchange value of the rupee. For Instance it was not found possible to obtain last year the rifles and ammunition promised to the Shaikh of hibai in connection with the unrest there (vide paragraph 2 (c) of my letter quoted above). These ) were purchased this year at a cost of Rs. 3,184/-* (b) Expenditure on the despatch of Agents to the hinterland to obtain infonnation required by His Majesty* s EHCU'SURE IN2 Majesty^s Government (e.g. India Office telegram Ho. 2903* dated the 7th March 1934) in connection with the negotiations regarding the South-Eastern Boundary of Saudi Arabia. These negotiations have not been concluded and some additional expenditure in this connection is anticipated, vide India Office telegram (c) Somewhat heavy expenditure has had to be incurred in connection with the negotiations for the &lt;^atar Oil Concession recently successfully concluded, vide India Office letter No.P. Z. 3921/35, dated the 13th June 1935, to the Government of India. (d) The desire shown by the Trucial Coast Shaikhs for the oil exploration of their territories, and the possibility of competition from foreign interests has necessitated more than normal expenditure on intelligence work in this area, which continues and cannot be reduced (e) The investigation lasting for several months of a Report from His Majesty^ Legation of a recrude scence of the Arms Traffic between the Oman Coast and Persian Baluchistan resulted in an additional expenditure. A similar report has again been recently received (vide Government of India telegram No. 1756, dated the 17th July 1935) and additional expenditure is anticipated in connection with the further enquiry ordered by the Government of India. (f) The action of the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah in removing his flag from Tanb Island at the end of last year and the suspicion that he was acting in collusion with the Persian authorities necessitated special expenditure by the Residency Agent. &lt;A No.20Q4, dated the 28th June 1935. without detriment to our interests. ( g).....- 3 iWtker air facilities from local Stiaiklis are required in connection with the development ox the Arab Air Route and the proposed expansion of Imperial Airways Services and there will he unavoidable expenditure in this connection curing the Autumn and Winter. (h) The Royal Air .Force propose in the coming Winter consolidating the Muscat-Murhat section of the Mu scat-Aden Air Route. This will inevitably mean extra expenditure on the political side of the work. 3 . • With the additional grant asked for, the total expenditure for the year under the Heads of Secret Service and Toshakhana will amount only to ks. IS^OO/'- which, having regard to the important interests enumerated above, many of which have only come into being during the last few years, is, I consider very moderate. I trust therefore that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction the allotment of the additional sums requested. ■E ■ 43 B G H M I.

M. - •Extract from a Note recorded loy the Accountant G-eneral, Central Revenues, New Delhi, dated the 17th May 1954. 2 The charges on account of the Vice Consul, Bushire, are not under the audit of this office. This office will Include the expenditure on account of office allowance in the annual statement of expenditure incurred hy the G-ovem- ment of India on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia which is divisible in moieties between Imperial and Indian Bunds. It is presumed that audit will continue to be conducted by the Auditor, Home Accounts, as heretofore. It is therefore, essential that the provision on account of the 'Office Allowance of the Vice Consul, Bushire, w should be made as a separate item under 'Contingencies'* in the Indian Budget and not merged in the office allowance grant of the Political Resident, Bushire, in view of the fact that this office is responsible for watching the progress of expenditure of the office allowance grant of the Bushire Residency proper. ******■ INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. K 'sL+iio and address— s V' not to any person by name, but to- “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. 4179 ! 1934 j THE Under - Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to ^Xa^&lt;Llu ^ 5/v&gt;xbux/ and begs to enquire, by direction of the Secretary of State, whether a*^answer may shortly be expected to the Foreign Office letter No. !&gt;4 xb | of the Ko^tA^ respecting \JMJL ' o||vCC cvt' Ga^Q^W^-C/ _ -£t«sv f\o , e.2.i*-)kU4 ^ /^l/Vv CJ (zS) ^ -^p-/ rtfINDEXED In any further communication this subject, please quote No. K 5426/5426/254 and address— m not to any person by name. but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,’’ Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.

I am # Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) JAMES RAE.From The Hon , t)le Lieut,-Colonel Sir Hugh Biacos, K.B.E. , To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, I have the honour to state that I have recently Been examining the establishment of the Bus hire Besidency office with a view to the possibility of effecting those economies which are so urgently required by the present financial position. The establisomant of this office, however, on a modest scale compared with offices of a similar status in India, and this, I think, will be clerks and two copyists. This cannot be considerel in any way excessive having regard to the large amount of work dealt with, and I have satisfied myself that no reduction is feasible, and that the clerical establishment is fully on behalf of the Navy, etc., while exchange matters add to Political Besident in the Persian Gulf Si mla. Proposed abolition of post of interpreter Bus hire Besidancy. Sir, admitted when I describe it in detail 2. The General Office consists of a Begistrar, three emuloyed. r thoirtheir labours. No reduction is possible here. 4. The Confidential Office consists of a Confidential Assistant, a confidential Clerk, a Stenographer ana a Cypher ClerK. The work of this office is exceedingly heav# and moreover is steadily increasing; wher^s the General Office keep normal hours the confidential office frequently have to work on holidays and often till a late hour at night. There is certainly no possibility of any reducv.ion of the establishment in this office. 5. There remains the vernacular Office. This consists of an Indian interpreter and two munshis, both of whom are Persians. The labours of the vernacular office have been enormously increased by the Persian import restrictions: special applications have to he made for every single article that/ I or my staff or the clerical estaDlishment desire to import into Persia, and 14 copies have to be made out of each application, i.e., 6 in Persian, and 6 in English for the Persian authorities, add 1 for the Legation and 1 Office copy. Subsequently constant enquiries have to be made to the Customs Department to ascertain what permits u. have been rec ived, etc., and it is no exaggeration to sa^ that half the time of my vernacular Office is nowadays taken up in trying to cope with the everchanging regulations introduced by the Persian Government. Though no reduction in the strength of the establishment is possioie, 1 1 consider that unuer present circumstances the cost of the vernacular establishment could be reduced without serious loss of efficiency* 6. formerly it was desirable oo have a senior Indian official on my staff for dealing with local Persian officials, 1 etc. Things have now changed, however, and Persian officials - witu the exception of the Governor - are not allowed nowadays to have any dealings with the officials of Foreign Consulates, and the importance of the duties devolving upon the Interpreter nave bean reduced. The/The retention of an official on so high a rate of pay, at a time of financial stress, is hardly necessary. The Head Munshi has acted as Interpreter in the past when the Indian Interpreter has 'bean on leave and has fulfilled his duties adequately, ani is competent to discuss minor matters with the local CJovernor. I would therefore recommend that the appointment should be abolished. 7• On the other hand ever since I have oeon here I have experienced great difficulty owing to the fact that I have no Arabic munshi on my staff, and though the Indian Interpreter Jmows Arabic to a certain extent, he obviously cannot be expected to write letters in Arabic as would an Arab, or to interpret as would a native of the country* When I visiteu lun baud in January 1S30 I had the greatest difficulty in drawing up the notes which fcaa to be exchanged as I ha no Arabic interpreter with me, and actually the notes were drawn up by Ibn Saud’s officials with such amendments ana criticisms as suggested themselves to Colonel Dickson and myself, not a very satisfactory arrangement. T. r hen visiting the Trucial coast I have twice had to borrow an Arabic munshi from Bahrain, thereby interfering with the normal working of the Bahrain office. I think it will be agreed that this state of affairs is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and that the Resident whose work is now very largely centered cn the Arab coast, should have a competent munshi whose mother tongue is Arabic. I would therefore request sanction to the creation cf a post of Arabic munshi to replace the Indian Interpreter. 8 . The pay of the Interpreter is Be.350-20450 plus Gulf Allowance Rs.75, Customs Allowance Rs.50, and House Bent Allowance Rs.60, and as the present incumbent, Khan Bahadur Muhamad Ali Soofi, is now drawing Bs-430 his total emoluments come to Rs. 505, the averaoS cost of toe post being/■bein^ Bs, 604. Ttio pay ttiat I would recomiiiand Tor the Arabic rnunshi io the saLie as that drawn the Head Mans hi (who would in future he knomi cis Persian munshi) viz, Hs. 250-10-300, plus Gulf Allowance f^s. 50, House Bent Allowance As. 40 and Cus toiae Allowance As. 25. fhe average cost of the post would thus he Bs. 407-4-0, There will thus* he a saving to Government of ±As. 196-12-0 per mensem. 9, I would recommend that the present incumbent of the post of Interpreter, Khan Bahadur Muhammad Ail 3oofi, should he granted the terms stated in Foreign and Political depart ment confidential memorandum No. D.5062-E/32 of the 21st November 1931. The Khan Bahadur has rendered many years of valuable service and before coming to Bushire was serving in Iraq, both during and after the war. He therefore merits every consideration aixd concession that can be accorded to him and had it not been for the urgent need for effecting economies I should not have advocated the abolition of his post.
