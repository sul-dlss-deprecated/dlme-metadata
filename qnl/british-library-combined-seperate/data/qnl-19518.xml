Pelly goes on to request that if the men are overworked or sick then standard notice should be used to bring attention to this.The letter also refers to a letter from headquarters regarding the outpost at Sambhur [Sāmbhar] lake being taken over, and the hope that other outposts and escorts could now be furnished from local corps.The letter further requests in official form the present state of troops under Macdonald's command and exact details of which officers and men are serving and will be serving during the cold season and emphasising his displeasure that an officer addressed him demi-officially on such matters and disobeyed a Political Agent's orders and also stating his displeasure at Macdonald's approval of the officers actions.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023902057.0x000039#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
