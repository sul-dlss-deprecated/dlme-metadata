The payment of these goods were to be made by installments within five years. The mentioned French firm was represented in London by Messrs. Fleming and Company. While this con tract was signed the Afghan Government, showing her good- faith and for the encouragement of the successful realisa tion of the contract, paid a considerable sum as a security. Out of this money the French Air Company,through its London Agents, Messrs. Fleming and Company, made the payment of a sum of money to the British Government in form of security. After the troubles in Afghanistan came to an eM, the new Afghan Government took the necessary steps to re-new the above mentioned contract, and reduced the quantity of the rifles to 18,000. The Air Company agreed to this and also oonsented to credit the sum previously paid as security of the contract and to include that amount in part payment of the merchandise. The British War Office during the payment of last installment has deducted the sum of £4329/0/0 for expenses incurred for protecting and keeping the mentioned goods for the period of four years, and considering this amount as an indemnity has decided to deduct this sum. The Afghan Legation, therefore, requests the British Foreign office to place the matter before the British War Office so that the said indemnity may kindly be cancelled, and the deducted sum be restored in our favour.““'Tdrkish omoB, s.wa 7th February, 1934 /43/97) Sir, Vlith reference to your note lo* 1993 of December 1st last regarding the alleged retention by the British War Office of the sum of £43E9 paid to them in connexion with the sale of arms and ammunition t&gt; r the use of the Afghan Government, I have the honour to inform you, after consultation with the Army Council, that, since the transaction in question involved the /ar office in ' no contractual relation with any party other than Kessrs* | Af Fleming and Company, the Department cannot assume financial I liability in the matter towards any third party* y; g, njjg gum to which alaim is made was part of a deposit paid to the tfar Office hy Messrs.

Ammunition for Afghan Government 0 2. Government of India in the Army Department recently received enquiry from Machine Tools, India, Limited, Calcutta, for quotations for supplying four million cartridges. Tlieir letter stated that Afghan Government had placed order with Hashmi and Company, Government Contractors, Kabul, for whom Machine Tools, India, Ltd., act as agents in India 0 Firm was informed that munitions are not sold to private dealers and advised to inform their clients that, if Afghan Government desired to purchase ammunition from Government of India, they should approach them through proper channel.Foreign Office Minutes . ^ S 1 Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles reads ’’Importation into Germany of arms, munitions and ’’war material of every hind shall be strictly ’’prohibited. ’’The same applies to the manufacture for,, and ’’export to, foreign countries of arms, munitions ’’and war material of every kind”. Presumably it would apply if these arms had been manufactured in Germany, but probably they were not - the German firm acting as middleman. I doubt if we need take up this point at present.

In reply, I am to say that the contract for the sale of the rifles, etc. , was between the War Department and Messrs. A. Fleming and Co. , the Department has been in no contractual relation in the matter with any party other Than Messrs. Fleming, and has not been in any way concerned with any arrangements which may have been made between Messrs. Fleming and the French Air Co. and/or the Royal Afghan Government. In these circumstance it is obvious that the Department is under no liability in connection with tne contract to any third party, nor would the Army Council have ordinarily communicated any information regarding the contract to a third party. It is understood, however, that for political reasons it is considered desirable to give certain information to the Afghan Legation. The Council have accordingly taken steps to obtain the consent of Messrs. A. Fleming and Co. to the communication of the following /information *ider Secretary of Stale, Foreign Office, S.W. 1.information:- The deposit was paid to one War Department hy Messrs. A. Fleming and Go. in respect of the original contract for 50,000 rifles etc., under the terms of that original contract. Later, the Department having been satisfied that no further stores beyond the 18,000 rifles and 18,000,000 rounds of ammunition already issued would he taken, terminated the contract, and in August 1933 refmided the balance of the deposit, £4,329, uo Messrs. A. Fleming and to. , xrom whom it had been duly received.

After satisfying themselves that no further stores would he taken heyond the 18,000 rifles and 18 million rounds of ammunition already issued, the War Office later terminated the contract and in August 1933 refunded to Messrs.

Afghan Government have given me order four million at six pounds^ five shillings per thousand net and will instruct their Minister, London, pay you £5,000 advance at once. They have signed acceptance of terms offered. Consider that it would be very unwise to ask them sign formal sgreeraent in fortnight 4 s time. They are unversed in legal natters and would become suspicious and would probably make sndless difficulties. Consider the present Government can be relied on to stand by its written acceptance. In any case, we have only their good faith to rely on, and if they meant to fail to carry out agreement, we have no power to force them as no court decree would be enforceable against them.

Kay S, 1S33 Monsieur le Finistre, I have the honour to invite a reference to my - letter /°* _ 386/XI of the 27th N e hruary last regarding a certificate issued by the Afghan Consul a t Karachi to the effect that certain goods, contained in five truntis ana one case, which had been imported per S. S.WachtfeIs *, were the property of the Afghan Goverr Kent. The Director of the Western Department of the Boreign Office who called on me on the 20th March, alter explaining that the certificate was given in error and that the contents of these packages consist ing of a certain book, a sword, five pistols and a quantity of cartridges were in fact the property of Abdul Hadi Khan, late Minister a t Berlin, requested me on behalf of the Afghan Government to recommend that transit of these articles (with the exception of the hook) should be allowed. It will be realised by Tour Excellency that mistakes of this mind in official documents signed by Afghan Consuls, apart from the serious effect they are likely to have on the credit of the Consuls themselves and on that of their Government, constitute an infring ment of the Treaty of 1S21 and I accordingly have the honour to request that steps may kindly be taken to ensure that mistakes of this kind do not recur. In the present instance the Government of India have, a s an exceptional concession which will form no precedent for the future, accepted the request made By the Afghan Government ana have given facilities the property in question, other than the proscribec book/'book, to “be forwarded to Afghanistan.

The Consul had received informs- tion that a consignment intended for the Afghan War Ministry might arrive shortly at Karachi and had assumed that-the five trunks and one case now in question etituted that consignment. These packages were in fact the private property of Abdul Hadi Khan, ex-Minister at Berlin. In regard to the prescribed book the Afghan Government had no wishes to express and the Government of India would presumably confiscate it. The Af^aan Government would be grateful if transit of the other property, including the arms, to Afghanistan could be allowed. '•C'SUftE IN iGS SECRETARY'S No [Sd'' ,Indian. •. • • • 5* * said that as the rules had apparently 'been infringed I did not know what view would be taken by the Government of India. I pointed out that such incidents inevitably shook the credit of the Afghan Consuls in India and of their Government. The Foreign Office representative said that this was realised and repeated his expression of regret. 6. I am not aware of any exact precedent for this case, and the nearest I have been able to find is the importation by S» Ghulam Siddiq Khan, when returning from the post of Afghan Minister at Berlin in 1926, of certain arms not covered by a laissez passer wnich he had obtained from His Majesty* s Embassy Berlin (Secretary of State for India’s telegram Ho.455 dated the 15th February 1926). Whether the present case is a more serious one than that seems to depend on decision of the question whether it is worse to import arms under a false declaration by an Afghan Consul, or to misuse a British diplomatic laissez passer for the same purpose. In the case of Ghulam Siddiq Khan the baggage was allowed to go forward and a mild reproof administered to him. (Letter from the Foreign Office London to the Afghan Minister London Ho.N.767/469/97 dated 24th February 1926) 7. I have no information to show whether the Afghan Consul was or was not acting in good faitn in this matter, or, if he was not, whether the Afghan Government were implicated in the attempt to v,v^de ti e«• 3 • 2ii i 'J'iCffl mi lo | HOI 8i Mi,„ =u.t»» regulations.

(Afgianist^ Annual Report for 1932 paragraph 3 ) The fact that the Afghan Government have chosen to state their attitude orally rather than reply formally to my letter is an indication that they realise the seriousness of the case, since they always dislike offering an unqualified apology in writing* 8* The GOTernment of India may, in the circum stances I have described consider that the requirements of the case will be met if I write officially to the Acting Foreign Minister recounting what his assistant has said to me* emphasising the importance of this incident, and stating that, while the book will be confiscated, their recommendation in regard to the other property will be accepted as an exceptional concession which cannot be repeated in any future cases of this kind*Copy of a latter H0.386/XI dated the 27th February 1933 from His Majesty's Minister, Kabul to His Excellency M.

As this description was not considered adequate, the Agents (A.R.Khan and Sons, Karachi) were called upon under the rules either to ampin fy it in greater detail or to open the packages for examination. The Agents opened the packages, which were then found to contain, among other articles :** (a) One seditious publication, the import of which into India has been prohibited by a notificafckn of the Government of India. (b) One uniform sword. (c) Five pistols (7.65 mm.) (d) Five hundred and ninety cartridges.

Full enquiries have been made of Messrs. Fleming, the suppliers, and Messrs. Thos. Cook &amp; Sons, the shipping agents for the Afghan Legation. Cook’s in turn, have been in communication with the shipping company and Woolwich Arsenal with the result that no explanation can be furnished as to where the two extra cases of cartridges can have come from. They have reviewed records dealing with the movements of the large consignment, and there is general agreement that no extra cases were present when the consignement was (1) checked out of Woolwich by Woolwich Arsenal officials, (2) tallied into barges by officialsand lightermen, and (5) out again by lightermen and shipping officials, and (4) checked into the vessel by the shipping company. The chits and other documents have been examined, and all go to show that only the authorised number of cases viz. 5502 was handled. With regard to the 200 V^ry pistols, I am afraid we are responsible for any confusion which has arisen in Karachi* When Messrs. W.W.

The provisions of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1981 relating to the importation of arms and munitions into Afghanistan are contained in the latter part of article 6 and in letters T^gnd II attached to the Treaty. The relevant texts are given in appendix Uo.l. The meaning of ^arms and munitions 1 is considered in paragraph 12 . 2. although these provisions allow His Majesty’s G-overnment in certain circumstances to detain arms passing through India or through British ports on their way Afghanistan, His Majesty’s Government are for all practical purposes under a treaty obligation to leu uhe Afghan Government import without hindrance or leotriction whatever arms it desires. 3. With regard to the supply of arms from this country, me effect of the Treaty is not equally clear, but His Majesty's Government are in any case under no obligation to sell arms and they can always bring pressure bear in order to stop private firms from doing so. It is, however, desirable on military and commercial grounds that if the Afghan Government purchase arms at all they shall purchase them in this .Country or essential on political grounds that His Majesty's „ . nractice do nothing to give the Government snail iu pi^coxoc impression that they desire to prevent the .fghan Government from acquiring arms in any quuntity.it -t-upr-pfore with the possible pleases. Here again, therefore, j. t-. q «r* o ui red f i 1 ony exception of arms which Co - I - n 0 r .^o+v-ts Government have for all other source, His Majesty -i tpriv tive but to let the Afghan practical purposes no olten.^ Gover^nentGoverment pur chase in this country and export to Afghanistan whatever arms they desire. 4 . These conditions are unliely to change except as the result of major developments in our relations with Afghanistan and form the background to the problem of ensuring that arms imported into Afghanistan through Indian territory are really intended for, and reach, the Afghan Government. 5 . That measures to ensure this are necessary is apparent from past incidents suggesting that ^fghan officials both at home and abroad have been in tne habit of purchasin service rifles on their own account ana with the object of selling them to private persons in .Afghanistan or in tribal territory on the Horth-West frontier. These purchases have sometimes, but not always, been maae in the name oi hie .Afghan Government. 6 . is a result of these incidents His Majesty's Government have decided, after consuloation wi h Government of India and His Majesty's Minister at M-oui, that permission to export arms from this country will not be given unless or until the Afghan Government have formally notified His Majesty's Minister ai. intention to import such arms for onei- own This procedure must apparently be re^ar . slight upon that provid.d Pot by «&gt;. sctnl .stding OP letter II eU.ehed .»• ““ o. , 4 -^ furnish to His Majesty s Afghan Government undertake tn b^ imported into xJTghan Minister details of all arms territory from the ports of Great Britain and British India before their import at ion^t British po ^ ■ v, m -rhe case of goods originating m expression which, m die it aouears, only mean British Great Britain, can, i ^ •t-hprefore, that ohe Indian ports). In demandmg.therefo . notificationnotification required ‘by letter II shall take place before exportation from British ports (i.e. ports of Great Britain), His Majesty 1 s G-overnment cannot perhaps claim to he acting on the strict letter of their treaty rights; hut the demand is a logical extension of the principle involved in letter II, and insofar as it reduces the chance of arms exported from Great Britain being subsequently detained in India, it is as much in the interests of the Afghan Government as of His Majesty 1 s Government (see paragraphs 8 and IB). Applications by the Afghan Government for the importation of arms not by themselves, hut by private traders, will be resisted to the utmost. 7. As additional precautions His Majesty’s Government have decided that all arms (except those exported under sections viii, ix, x and xi of appe^uix Ho.2) must be consigned to, and their cases lo-oe^xed xor, the Afghan G-overnment (or the King of Afghanistan) c/o Afghan Consul at Karachi (or Bombay), and that when rifles are exported the manufacturer's numbers shall whenever possible be ascertained and communicated to the rm ,-yP these lessens i&lt;o some a Government of India. fhe iirs the* arms reach India extent the risk of misdirection a rhile the second facilitates enormously the tash of .racing the origin of rifles found in tribal territory. Phe names of vessels by which arms are shipped and Port of destination in India must also be furnished by the Afghan Government or their representatives abroad, or by the agents to whom the licences are is-u • in advance to the order that they may be communicc / 2 section C). Government of India (see ap^. ^ » to His Majesty’s 8 . Prior notification , . e - P the important point, as the only Minister is, however, Hie ¥ . j.__ i c Government and the means by which His Majesty ^ -» o-p of arms and Government of India can checn tne - amnufiitiammunition into tribal territory is by being able to bring home to the Afghan Government themselves the ultimate responsibility for all arms and ammunition found there. Incidentally it is in the interest of the Afghan Government, whatever they may do on their own account, to prevent leakage through the negligence or dishonesty of their officials and they have in the past welcomed, and even suggested, strict adherence to the procedure of letter II. 9. Although this procedure is well known to the Afghan Government and should be well known oo their representatives abroad, applications for exporu licences may still be received from time to time without the necessary notification having already teen made by the Afghan Government. It is therefore desirable that working rules should be adopted for dealing with them. The details of these as agreed upon between the Departments concerned are given in appendix Ho.d. 10. These rules must, however, be interpreted in the light of the following considerations; firstl;;, communicating their decisions to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul His Majesty's Government have reserved the right to waive prior notification at Kabul when Afghan diplomatists desire to send or take arms to Afghanistan for their personal use. ?or tiiis there are special reasons. The difficulties of interfering with diplomatic privilege are considerable and His Majesty's Government cannot ordinarily preven ^ 4 -alr-i nxr with frim rilS a departing foreign aiplomatisu i of rifles or private property, whether Ciiis ^ ^ -oea^ing . . ^ « -vni ies strictly speaking anythin^ else The same principle Pf any tnmg else. . f he is returning to his passage through India, especi ^ hile/effort will be made to from his post. Accordingly, ■v-h- nf arms under Giie •educe to a minimum the movemen . .gViiie the working rules guise of diplomatic privilege -nu indicatem indicate a certain line to be followed with this object i view, there may be occasions when it 7/ill be necessary to acquiesce in the transit of arms not actually destined for the Afghan Government, As to what constitutes a reasonable quantity of arms for the personal use of a diplomatist, no final ruling can be given. Even a single service rifle might be considered too many, but on occasions it may be judicious to allow a larger number. 11. Secondly, these measures are adopted purely on grounds of expediency and if a case occurs in which the expediency of immediate compliance v/ith some application outweighs the expediency of taking the usual precautions, His Majesty’s Government will have no hesitation in over-riding their own working rules. Such a case occurred during the King Amanulla’ s visit in 1928, when, in order not to mar by any argument of unpleasantneso the excellent effect which the visit was producing, permission was given for the delivery the Afghan negation of a qucdtioj rifles, supposedly ordered by the King, out suspecte being a private purchase by some ox hio suite. 12. There is no definition in the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921 of what is meant by '’arms and munitions^, + ^ international instrument nor is Afghanistan a party to an^ containing such a definition. In general, Uie ooject of the measures set forth in this memorandum is to regulate the entry into Afghanistan any aim ammunition which might form the equipment of an organised ■. 0 T’mc; and ammunition. force or of material for making sue nri -nv rifles which, though These include revolvers and any ri o q-tp of bores professedly imported for sporting purpooe • ~ T*-i-fips and are . . rhnqp of service rixie which approximate to oho-.e ° • or auasi-military capable of effective use m mi ^ ^ ^ „ aras and 4 .. t +. 4 0 -i-n this sense operations. It io m ouxo munitions' have been interpreted m the ppractice no difficulties have arisen, lut it is scarcely possible to lay down a hard and fact definition and each application ipust in the last resort be treated on its merits. xhe treaty procedure has never been applied to sporting shot-guns and air rifles. 13. The working rules treat as a single operation what is technically two distinct operations;' (a) the issue of a license for the export of arms from this country and (b) the granting of permission for their transit across Indian territory. In dealing with the Afghan Government it is necessary that His Majesty 1 s Government and the Government of India act together, not only in fact but in appearance. Although, therefore the distinction between ‘the two operations should be borne in mind, they should be regarded as mutually dependent. For His Majesty’s Government to issue an export licence when the Government of India might clearly have grounds for detaining the arms would be disingenuous; equally it is desirable that the Government of India should not, save for very grave reasons or in the circurastances foreseen in the working rulos, detain arms for which His Majesty’s Government nu\ e ox±ce issued a licence (the detention of arms as a sanction unaer the Treaty is not of course being considered nere). majority of eases i.e. those in which a formal notification has been made to His Majesty’s Minister at x^abul, bhe little likelihood of this happening, although ouboe^ information may at times render detention necessary. In '’diplomatic rr cases, the India Office will explain Government of India the circumstances in which has been issued and will state whetner o- not 4 -_ -hp on e in which Majesty’s Government consider Hie Ccx^ transit should be allowed irrespective of a notificati by the Afghan Government.-^fghan Treaty of 1921 . Article 6 With regard to arms and munitions, the British Government agrees that as long as it is assured that the intentions of the Government of Afghanistan are friendly and that there is no immediate danger to India from such importation in Afghanistan, permission shall he given without let or hindrance for such importation. If, however, the -arms Traffic Convention is hereafter ratified hy the Great Powers of the world and comes into force, the right of importation of arms and munitions hy the Af ghan Government shall he subject to the proviso that the Afghan Government shall first have signed the Arms Traffic Convention, and that such importa tion shall only he made in accordance with the provisions of that Convention. Bhould the Arms iraffic Convention not be ratified or lapse, the Government of Afghanistan, subject to the foregoing assurance, can from time to time import into its own territory the arms ana munitions mentioned above through the ports of ttie British Isles and British India.

Please see papers P.5143/30 where Messrs.Flemings inform F.O. that they had a contract with the Afghan Government for the supply to them of 50,000 rifles and 50,000,000 rounds of ammunition. This contract was made with Amanullah 1 s Government in 1928* When King Nadir came to the throne his Government reduced the figures to 18,000 rifles, and a corresponding amount of ammunition. The first consignment of 8,000 rifles and 8,000,000 rounds was despatched in March, 1931, and this is apparently part of the balance. It is, however, desirable we should insist on the Afghan Government carrying out their treaty obligation to inform His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, of the proposed importation arms and ammunition from this country before facilities are given under Article 6 of the Treaty for the importation of the munitions India. It is proposed, therefore, to instruct Sir R.Maconachie to mention the matter to the Afghan Government, and enquire whether, in fact, these arms have been ordered by them in London, this enquiry may hold up consistent, and that it It is possible that onment. and that itforeign Office Minute, Query, concur in draft telegram to Kabul.

The Government of India have said that facilities will he given (N105G/299/97) and I think that we should give consent without delay. The present moment, when we know that King Nadir Shah is in peculiar difficulties, is one when we should make as little trouble as possible about formalities. It is true that the Afghan Government spoke of 9,000 rifles and 9,000,000 rounds S.A.A. captain Hall told me some days ago the transaction had been reduced by 1,000 rifles, though he did not know why. VJhatever the reason, and it may be connected with prices, the greater number may be held to include the less. It is worth noting that however much the. price paid to the Office General de 1’Air by the Afghan Government may have charged, the price ..c-.id a ceived. by Messrs. Flemings has not done so to any large extent. 8,000 bears the same relation more or less to 50,000 that £42,000 does u o Q. Copy to India Office with minutes, draft reply and draft telegram.

I gather that the Contracts Branch feel in all these cases that their first duty is to British contractors and that it is not for them to assist foreign buyers to beat the contractors down. Foreign buyers are usually well able to look after themselves and ordinary trade competition tends to make prices fair. In the case which occurred two years ago the Contracts Branch were able to say quite honestly that the Afghan Legation were getting a good bargain and as this was likely to help the contractor they had no hesitation in doing so. But this did not ian that if the bargain had been a bad one ,r the Afghan Legation they would have been lually prepared to say so; in -ni*- c&lt; -' e 3 uld probably say they could express no opinion from which the Legation could draw what con- Lusions they liked. , 1 + -n q a Guns It also appears tha u B.b.A. tap official government contractors .o re now the oi-lICIpu B »en&gt; » oreign governments. ,il- ■ - con _ u. +-horp arc Qw itJ - “•- -*• ractors ^ Quite t M11 „ e4 •uns, though Captain ' actedacted for the Contracts Branch in respect of certain arms.

WALTON, kggallay, Iso# t Foreign Office.Mr. Walton, 1 assume that the War Office Contracts Branch would he most reluc tent, for political as well as commercial reasons, to negotiate sales direct with the Afghans. X thinlc they might reasonably be asked to give the names of two or m ore agents who handle their material, and that the legation would have ample spportunity, by comparing the quotations received from these agents ( and also, if they wished, the prices asked by firms like B*S.A. and Vickers for new material), to judge the reasonableness of the prices asked, e might 3ven undertake to ask the ar Office on their behalf whether any particular quotation was reasonable; the War office fcave such an opinion in 1928 when they refused to iiaclose actual prices. X suggest that we need do no more at ires nt than ask the %'ar Office for the names of agents.Zulfacar Khan telephoned to me yesterday with reference to Mr. Seymour-e utter of Auguet 23rd, end asked whether It would be possible for the tfar Office to give the ..ignen Legation the names of agents through whom enquiries could be made, with regard to the prices of arms ; seeing that the «ar Office could not answer such enquiries directly. l said 1 would see whether anything could be done.

The attitude expressed in the letter is 0 f -our^e strictly correct within commercial limits. The War Office cannot disclose the terns of their , contracts with arms agents and if the Afghan Lega tion desire to buy arms from such agents they must use their own judgment as to the offers made to them. iou o I arn not at all sure that this is the point in the present case, although our information is scanty and it is possible that Mr. Dowding and other agents in fact have options upon all War Office sur plus arms of the kinds- described by Zulfacar Khan. Moreover there are political considerations: e.g: A refusal to help is at variance with our general policy as exemplified in the gift of arms and money. If the Afghans buy arms here it is to •that they should get good our interest value for their money. A reply on the lines of the Mar Office letter may leal te a request from the Afghan negation for a quotation to Be given on the assumption that th.y nought Ih. anus direct from the »ar Offteq and in tnat ease I do not thinK » could refuse, however much the contracts Wirt ment might shrinK from the prospect o. direct dealings.Against this must he placed the fact that we do not want to be involved in any way in Afghan negotiations with arms agents like Mr. Dowding, that the Afghan legation ought to be more specific as to details and that we want to play for time until we see whether the Afghan Government do anythin with the cash gift which they will soon receive. On balance therefore I am in favour of not returning to the charge with the War Office at once, but of sending off a letter to Zulfacar Khan on the lines of the draft now submitted, on the under standing that if the Afghan Legation ask again we shall have to press the War Office for a more helpful reply.

We have also examined the Trade Returns for India and note that exports of arms and ammunition to Afghanistan are not separately specified hut that as the total value of the re-exports of such goods to all unspecified foreign countries is' negligible it is clear that arms are not being exported from the United Kingdom to India and subsequently re-exported to Afghanistan; also there were no exports to foreign countries of arms and ammunition manufactured m India.

I iuvite a reference to Cabinet Minutes Nos. 47 (29) of 13th November, conclusion 9, and 53 (29) of 17th December 1929, conclusion 6 (b). In the first of these the Cabinet took note that the sale or gift of arms to King Nadir of Afghanistan was not in conflict with their previous decisions on the subject of the sale of arms and ammunition to foreign States, and in the second they agreed that the decision not to dispose of surplus munitions and arms to foreign Governments should not debar a gift by the Government of India to Afghanistan. It appears probable that the Afghan Minister in Loudon may shortly ask for facilities to purchase from Avar Office surplus stocks and to export to Afghanistan the whole or a part of a consignment of 50,000 rifles an d 50,000,000 cartridges for which an English firm, Messrs. Fleming, were in negotiations with the War Office in 1926 under instructions bom the former Afghan Government. Messrs. 4leming had in 1928 applied for an export licence, and it had been agreed that this might be granted, but the matter lapsed at the time of the fall of King Amanullah’s Government. Messrs. Fleming have recently informed the War Office that they expect to receive rnstructrons from the Afghan Minister in London to negotiate the purchase of a portion, at any rate, of tie origma consignment. _ _ T i •.

Draft letter to war OfficeP. 492/30. * Minute Paper. political Department. P. 270/29. The essential points in the Government of India’s telegram are that:- (1) they see no political objection to allowing the Afghan Government to import the large consignment of arms to which Messrs.Flemings’ request relates (we have heard that they have already allowed the Afghan Government to take over anus ordered by King Arnanullah and detained till now at Karachi); (2) they suggest that it should oe hinted through Messrs. Fleming to Shah fall that an export licence will be required as well as facilities for transit across India. The question as regards reaffirmation of the Treaty of 1921 discussed in their telegram is pursued further in connexion with Mr. Henderson’s interview with Shah Wali in another telegram (No. 180-S) of the same date which has been separately submitted, and need not be discussed here. I have ascertained from the &gt;Yar Office that they have put to Messrs. Fleming the question suggested in India Office letter of 14th January, but have not yet had a reply. But the War Office point cut that Messrs. Fleming are probably not the principals in this matter, but are acting as agents for others, e.g., m. Clemenceau in Pans (who revealed, on returning from Afghanistan after his railway survey, that ne was interested in the import of these arms for King Amanullah). If so, Messrs. Fleming may not be able to communicate direct with Shah Wali as the Government of India suggest, and it may therefore be some time oefore the hint suggested reaches him. ^ 'N / J jfoera / 3818a 5000 8/29There is another possibility, viz*, that ohah ^ali may, if not now, eventually, asK the foreign Of lice for financial assistance to cover the import ^of these arms (Mr. Maconachie has already reported a request lor facilities in regard to a consigh men f 5,000 rifles made to him by Shah Wall - see his memorandum attached). If Shah fali makes any such request it will be for consideration whether we should not offer to give the arms (and possibly new rifles rather than 1914 stock) outright instead of money which would in a large measure be deflected into itching palms. The immediate action seems to be to write to the War Office as in the draft below, provided Foreign Office concur.

Fleming approached tne War Office with a view to buying 50,000 1914 Service rifi.es and 50,000,000 cartridges from surplus stock for the Atgnan Government. The War Office were somewnat doubtful of the propriety of disposing of this large stock to Afgnanistanj and views were exchanged on tne suoject with the oa and our Minister at Kabul, in the course of 'hicn it was j decided to insist that, in accordance witn Letter Ii attached to the 1921 Treaty, all applications for facil -ities for transit of arms via India must be made by the .

I understand from tne T A‘.0. that they have no informationas to whether Messrs.Fleming have in fact sounded the new Afghan Grovernmentj and I think; tnat tnis should in the first instance be suggested to the firm if they have not already done so. if it appears that tne Afghan Government nave com- -missioned Messrs.Fleming to go on with tne contract, it would still appear necessary for the Afghan Government to to make a definite application for facilities for transit via India.This cannot be done at Kabul while we have no representative there, and the Afghan Government may be left to raise the question tnrough Snah Wali in London if they so desire. This however brings up in a concrete form _ ~h the question, already raised by Mr Walton on papers rel- -ating to the question of our treaty relations with Afghan -istan, whetner it would not now be desirable to ootain through Snah Wali some formal admission that the present Afghan Government recognise tne obligations of the Treaty of 1 92 1 and the exchange of letters which accompanied it* signature. Whether this snould be taken up with Shah tfali by way of a formal note from the Foreign Office or intro- -duced orally'in conversation witn nim, e.g. unofficially by Mr Maconacnie, is for further consideration. In any tase it does not seem possible to proceed on tne strict letter of the 1921 Treaty in the present case, and in will be well to make sure that the Afgnan Government gettGi-ere^ Q e:implications of article .

I think that the first step is certainly to ascertain whether Flemings are acting on their own or have been in communication with the new govern ment. If the new government do apply for the arms, I do not think we can refuse to let them import them, treaty or no treaty. Nor should we, If we can possibly help it, refuse to let them b^y. them here. So far as we can judge Nadir Shah regards him self as the inheritor of King Amanullah's inter national relations, including treaties. Moreover, procedure with regard to arms in the 1921 treaty consists of conditions which we are in a position to impose whether that treaty is valid or not. In fact its only effect is to impose a legal obligation On us to let arms pass through India while Afghanis tan is friendly. So far as arms at any rate are con cerned, therefore, my personal view would be that it is scarcely worth while worrying about an exchange of notes- But there is no harm in asking the Government of India’s views- Qy.

A. Fleming &amp; Co. for an extension of the time, until 5th March, 1930, for removinp* the first consignment of arms. t* It appears to the Council that the present conditions in Afghanistan are very different from those in which the grant of the export licence was originally agreed to. Tne original application came tlirougb the government of the Ex-King Amanullah, and, at that time, political considerations made it desirable to supply the arms. In the altered conditions now obtaining in Afghanistan, it seems that the whole question requires I reconsideration, and the Army Council are not even aware 1 whether the present King requires these munitions or, l indeed, whether he is in a position to pay for them. 3. Before giving a reply to Messrs. A. Fleming &amp; Co., the Council would be glad to receive confirmation that the Afghan Government still require these arms, and further that the Government of India have no objection to the supply. 4 4. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Foreign Office. 3 JAN193D Your ie Under Secretary of State, India Office, London, S.W.l. am, Sir, obedient Servant,Zh&gt;lY MKM04 nm&amp;. MiAlo.eUons I'or Uiz Sx^ost of ..raa t .nd unltlona to X* l*he provisioas oi' the r nglo-JVIv in Treaty of 19B1 relating to the importation of arms ana munitions into Afghanistan are contained in the latter part of article 6 and in letters X and II attached to the treaty* fixe relevant texts are given in appendix Io*l. The meaning of %rms and munitions ' Is oarusiaerfed in paragraph ill though these provisions allow His Majesty’s Government in certain elrcum tances to detain arms parsing tiirough India or through British ports on their way to Afghanistan, His kale sty* s Government are for all practical purposes under a treaty obligation to let the Af gh&amp;n Gov or mum t import without hindrance or restriction whatever arms it desires* 3* With regard to the supply of* arms from this country, die effect of the Treaty is not equally clear, but His Majesty’s Government are in any case under no obligation to sell arms and they can always bring pres ure to bear in order to top private firms from doing so* It is, however, desirable on military and comraercia grounds that if the Afghan Government purchase arms at all they shall purchase them in tills Country or in India, and essential on political grounds that His Majesty 1 s Government shall in practice do no thing to &amp; • ve the impression that they desire to prevent the Afghan Government from acquiring arms in any quantity it pleases. Here again, therefore, *ith -fee possible exception of arms which cannot be* acquired ••• roa my other source. His Majesty’s Gwwwwnt have for all practical purposes bo altern tive but to let the Afghan governmentOoyernraent puroiiase in this country and export to Afghanistan whatever arms they desire* 4* fhes conditions are uniiely to change except as the result of major developments in our relations with Afghanistan ana form the hac&amp;ground to the problem of ensuring that arms Imported into Afghanistan through Indian territory are really intended for, and reach, the Afghan Government* 5. fhat measures to ensure this are necessary is apparent from past incidents suggesting that Afghan officials both at home ana abroad have been in the habit of purohasin service rifles on their own account ana with the object of selling them to private persons in Afghanistan or in tribal territory on the Horta-4est frontier. These purchases have sometimes, but not always, been ataae in the name of the Afghan Government* 6* As a result of these incidents His Majesty* s Govermaent have decided, after consultation with the Government of Xiidia and His Majesty 1 s aiiaistar at IGauul, that permission to export arms from this country will not be given unless or until the Afghan Government have formally notified His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul of their intention to Import such arms for their own use* This procedure must apparently be regarded as a slight advance upon that provided for by the actual warding of letter II attached to the treaty, by which she ^ghan Government undertake to furnish to His Majesty’s Minister details of all arms to be imported into Afghan t rritary from the ports of Great Britain and British India before their importatjU m^t British ports (an expression which, in the case of goods originating in Great Britain, can, it appear-..-, only mean. British Inuian ports) ♦ In demanding,therefore* that the notificationnotification required by letter II shell tahe place before .exportation from British ports (i.e* ports of Great Britain), His Majesty’s Government cannot perhaps claim to be acting on the strict letter of their treaty rights; but the demand is a logical extension of the principle involved in letter II, ana insofar as it reduces the chance of arms exported from Great Britain being subsequently detained in India, it is as much in the interests of the ^ufghan Government as of His Ma jesty 1 s Government (see paragraphs 8 and 12). Applications by the Afghan Government for the importation of arms not by themselves, but by private traders, will be resisted to the utmost. 7. *vs additional precautions His hjesty’s Government have decided that all arms (except those exported under sections vlii, ix, x and xl of appendix Ho.2) must be ccnsigned to, and their cases labelled for, the Afghan Government (or the .. Ing of Afghanistan) o/o the Afghan Consul at Karachi (or Bombay), and that when rifles are exported the manuf acturer * s numbers shall whenever possible be ascertained and communicated to the Government of India. The first of these lessens to some e extent the risk of misdirection after the arms reach India, while the second facilitates enormously the task of tracing the origin of rifles found in tribal terrltoiy. The names of vessels by which arias are shipped and the port of destination in India must also be furnished by the Afghan Government or their representatives abroad, or by the agents to whom the licences are issued, in order that they may be communicated In advance to the veminent of India {see appendix 2, section v;• 8. Prior notification to His Majesty’s nister is, however, the important point, as the only ians by which His Majesty’s Government and the &gt;v eminent of India can one oh the leakage ofammunition into tribal territory is by belne able to bring home to the ^ghan Government themselves the ultimate responsibility for all arms and aramunitioaa found there. Inoluentally it is in the interest of the Afghan Government, whatever they may ao on their own account, to prevent IeaJcage througli the negligejice or dishonesty of theiu officials and they have in the past welcomed, and even suggested, strict adherence to the procedure of letter II. 9* a.1 though this procedure is well known to the Afghan Government and should be well known to their representatives abroad* applications for export licences may still be received from time to time, without the necessary notification having already been made by the Afghan Government. It is therefore desirable that working rules should be adopted for dealing with them. The details of these as agreed upon between the Departments concerned tire given in appendix Ho*3. 10. These rules must, however, be Interpreted in the light of the following considerations; firstly, in communicating their decisions to the Government of India and His lia^esty f s Minister at Aabul His Majesty’s Government have reserved the right to waive prior notification at .Kabul when .vfghan diplomatists desire to send or take arms to Afghanistan for their personal use* For tills there are special reasons# The difi iculties of interfering with diplomatic privilege are considerable and His Majesty’s Government cannot ordinarily prevent a departing foreign diplomatist from taking with him his private property, whether this consists oi rifles or anything else. The same principle applies strictly speaking to his passage through India, especially if he is returning ev ery from ills post, icoordingly, rhil*effort will oe made to reduce to a minimum the movement of arms under the frui ,« of diplomatic privilege ana while the worhin t . rules indicateIndicate &amp; certain line to be followed with this object in view, there may be occ sions when it will be necessary to acquiesce In the transit of arras not actually destined for the .uf&amp;ham Government* As to what constitutes a reasonable quantity of arms for the personal use of a diplomatist, no final ruling can be given. Even a single service rifle might be considered too many, but on occasions it may be Judicious to allow a larger number. 11* Secondly, these measures are adopted purely on grounds of expediency and if a case oco.urs in which the expediency of immediate compliance with come application outweighs the expediency of taking the usual precautions. His Majesty’s Government will have no hesitation in over-riding their own working rules. Such a case occurred during the King Amanull&amp;’s visit in 1938, when, in ©rtMMf not to mar by any argument of unpleasantness the excellent effect which Hie visit was producing, permission was given for the delivery at the Afghan Legation of a quantity of rifles, supposedly ordered by the King, but suspected of being e private purchase by some of his suite* 13, 'There is no definition in the x*nglo-.-Xgh&amp;n Treaty of 1931 of what is meant by 'arms and munitions’, no* is Afghanistan a party to any International Instrument containing such a definition. In general, the object of th. measures set forth in thi Memorandum is to regulate the entry into Afghanistan of any arms and ammunition which might form the equipment of an organised force or of material for micing such arras and ammunition. fhese include revolvers and any rifles w-ich, though professedly imported for sporting purposes, are of bores which approximate to those of service rifles and are capable of effective use in military or auasi-military operations.
