A set of office notes at the end of the volume (folios 188-99) mirrors the chronological arrangement. A subject index at the front of the volume (folio 1A) refers to the volume’s earlier, uncircled foliation system.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence begins on the front cover and ends on the inside-back cover, and uses circled pencil numbers in the top-right corner of each recto. A second foliation sequence runs between ff 3-188; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled and can be found in the same position as the main sequence. Circled index numbers written in red crayon are also present throughout the file. The following foliaton anomalies occur: 1 and 1A; 2, 2A and 2B.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume’s contents relate to Anglo-Saudi negotiations over the extent of Saudi Arabia’s borders, and are a continuation of the contents of file IOR/R/15/1/607.
