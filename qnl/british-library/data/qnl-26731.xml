Upshot was that he would consult with the Turkish Q-overnment and let me have an answer as soon as possible. Conversation went better than I had expected. 2. I began by reading him in French a paper based on your telegrams Nos.1207 r and 1231 which I had prepared beforehand (text'’ iiY my immediately following telegram). I did not leave him a copy but he took notes of the more important passages* 3, Minister for Foreign Affairs then remarked that there had been certain n injustices' in the past which Turkey always desired to see removed at a proper time though she had^avoided raising these matters for fear of creating various complications. (In this connexion he mentioned the post-war settlement of Cilicia which had been subsequently rectified). 4. I said that he was looking at what I had said from the point of view of permanency. His Majesty's Government however, had in mind only, a temporary measure. Minister for Foreign Affairs said he understood this. 5,. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed receptive I repeated that our proposed action naturally had a direct bearing on Turkish communications and said that if Turkey contemplated any action on her side you thought this could easily be justified as an essential step for the protection of her vital interests. I added that on our side we should only be too happy if Turkey, occupied Aleppo and the i surrounding district. We had our own plans but for the time \ being our troops would be somewhat stretched out and the 1 presence of Turkish troops in that area would be undoubtedly of assistance. I then emphasised, at least twice, the essential importance of third paragraph of your telegram No.1207 saying that we did not want more trouble with the Arabs just as we had cleared things up in Iraq. Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed agreement,, 6 . Though I avoided any direct suggestion that if Turkey took the action suggested she might find herself directly up against Germany this aspect of the circumstances cropped up and we discussed it. Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed less | apprehensive than I had expected. He could justify his action on grounds suggested at end of second paragraph of your telegram No c 1207, he could even say that he was holding Aleppo in order to prevent the British from doing so, moreover Herr Hitler/Herr Hitler himself had promised to take into consideration Turkish ’’legitimate interests”. He mentioned that he had on one occasion informed the German Ambassador that if Italy occupied Syria, Turkey would go to war. He told me that Turkey had recently strengthened her troops on the frontier (this is the first intimation which I have had that the Turkish Government knew of this, see my telegram No. 1246 p aragraph 5) and went on to suggest a further increase might be made and be z 1% allowed to become publicly known. 7. I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we were anxious to act rapidly and begged him to let me have the earliest possible answer. 8 . My impression was that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was largely attracted by the possibility of taking a first step towards securing tne long coveted control over the whole railway and also possibly that he felt himself more secure vis-a-vis Germany than I had realised. (He expressed the view that the Germans had had such a knock in Crete that it would be some time before they could begin their next step ’’and they could not attack Turkey in the winter'). 9. Minister for Foreign Affairs may find his colleagues more cautious. I should hesitate to prophesy the final result. Please repeat to Cairo with my immediately following telegram*.

R. 4.00 a.m. 3rd June, 1941. eeeeeee IMMEDIATE . MO ST SECRET . Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram, 2 nd paragraph. Plans for action by the Free French and the British in Syria have been approved and will be put into force with the least possible delay. A declaration will be made by General Catroux on behalf of the Free French movement with the official support of His Maiesty r s Government promising [grp. undec] the termination or the mandate and guaranteeing the freedom and independence of Syria and Lebanon. This declaration will accompany the action raken. His Majesty's Government feels that since they are planning the occupation of Syria to meet the existing situation, they are bound from the outset to consult Turkish interests, both because the Turkish Government are our allies and because Turkey is limitrophe Syria. Action which is contemplated will, of course, touch the question of safeguarding Turkish communications via Aleppo. This question has already been touched on during the military conversations last winter. In the light of the above considerations, we should be interested to have the views of the Turkish Government and to know in particular their wishes and attitude in regard to the northern districts of Syria which border on Turkey and more particularly in regard to Aleppo and the railway which passes it. His Majesty s Government feels it natural that they should obtain the views of the Turkish Government on a matter which obviously interests them so closely. His Majesty's Government wish to emphasize the need for keeping this maxter absolutely secret.

'The circumstances of war in this matter as in others may outweigh difficulties between representatives of France on one hand and inhabitants of Syria and Lebanon on the other, difficulties of which recent events in Iraq oblige us to think.

Special statement regarding the minority rights seemed too arbitrary a matter to be included specifically in the declaration, which is, however, (conveniently or inconveniently) of considerable vagueness. The solution of this and other problems linked with the interpretation of the declaration ought to be worked out with Catrons and de Gaulle as we go along. As much will depend on the building up of trust and a common policy with them as on the text of the declaration.

' ./ A ^ ( 2 ). Memorandum section 1 on the necessity for collaboration \^~°[My hope for obtaining progressive improvement is collaboration. Food supplies in France insufficient, where the people cannot obtain even rations: in Syria ’ it is impossible to appreciate difficulties in France. (N). France can only obtain additional supplies from countries controlled by Germany. ' - ' ' (c). ^ Only way of obtaining an amelioration of the let 01 prisoners is by collaboration. “Detention of prisoners represents loss of 300,000 children per annum. This represents the equivalent of the number of casualties and is state of affairs that cannot possibly be allowed to continue. Policy of collaboration has already led to-the release of 100,000 prisoners. (c). It is - hoped to obtain more releases provided collaboration continues. (3). Section 2 . Recent events in Syria.2 . (a) * Uppermost primary unity of France to defend the Empire, Germans have no right to interfere .in the Levant nor will they v &gt; do so, .... . . (b) . Passage of German planes raised questions in all minds 0 These aeroplanes only touched in Syria in transit for Iraq without involving any infringement of Syrian independence, (c) . Article 12 of Armistice states that even in non-occupied France aerodromes are to be under German-Italian control. This control has been regularly and rigidly enforced in non- occupied France, Germans have been more lenient in Syria but their rights entitle them to land in transit. Syrian aerodromes however remain at full disposal of the French authorities, (d) . Article 10 of Armistice. French Government undertake not to utilise remaining armed forces for hostile action against Germany and Italy. Not therefore possible for the French in Syria to take military action to oppose the passage of German aircraft. (e) . As for vast [?grp 0 undec.] Syria, at the request of Germans this material, by the Armistice terms, belongs to Armistice Commission. Germans have therefore the right to dispose of this material as they please. (L). Section 3 is suppression of’Gaullism. (a). References made to officer killed opposing the passage of Colonel Collet's troops. Statement of Free French airman deserter Labas dealt [?with] in great detail is summarised as follows: (a) .

Following for Spears Mission from General Spears. [Begins]. E.L.S. 112. Berthoud just returned from Syria makes the following points. His sources .are French officials of proved reliability, American consular officials and petroleum executives. 1. French authorities in Syria not expecting imminent attack. % 2. Use of aerodromes by Germans although causing certain revulsion of feeling in our favour has not altered main loyalty to Retain. No indication of substantial portion of the population wishing to throw in lot with Free French. 3. French seem to consider the Germans only making symbolic gesture of assistance to Iraq by sending very * limited number of aircraft. This involves only technical but not actual infringement of Syrian independence. French administrative therefore consider that their (repeat their) honour has been saved by our (repeat our) attacks on Syrian aerodromes. They ask for more such attacks presumably on the ground that the heavier our onslaught the more striking their vindication. 4. Very little evidence of large number of Germans in civilian clothes. Their presence at Beirut would have been noticed. No evidence of Gestapo organisation. 5. Overwhelming consensus of opinion is that British attack on Syria would be resisted on Vichy instructions It is held that if attack not on sufficiently large scale* and if Vichy forces met with early success their fighting power would rapidly increase. Underlying desire to Vindicate military qualities and wipe out the stain of the past defeats. 6 . ? It is, however, held that if attack made in overwhelming force and it was believed effective resistancewas useless, will to fight would very soon crumple and that operation would he carried out very rapidly with little bloodshed. ^ Advantages of naval demonstration were emphasised by lorce. ° * . . 7. v Source is informed that already established impression was that use of Free French in attack on Syria would be serious mistake. Their appearance would stiffen resistance and cause revulsion of feeling against us. It is believed in Syria Free French would not fight well, ihis anti-Free French feeling based on loyalty to Petain and belief that only chance for France is for Frenchmen to hold together in opposition to ’German, claims. , 8 . Source, on the other hand, considers Free French forces encadres by British open to less serious objection, that^there would be positive advantages in their following ^ 00 P s slid occupying the country. Source states that above views were held by all his responsible French informants and by American Consulate in Beirut. 9. ^ French in Syria feel that it is not Germans but movement in Arab world which is at present endangering- them. ^ Revolt in Iraq was partly engineered by the Arabs in S^ria. There is a committee of help, for Iraq in almost every village. There is imminent danger of union between Iraq and Syria to form Arab confederacy. New block would be formed under the protection of Germany. 10* If British forces advance after this has taken place L? group omitted: there] would be attacks on newly formed Arab State wnich might lead to dangerous reuercussions in the neighbouring countries. d n ide above convfcngsqy Germans would obtain the use of Tripoli harbour and derive considerable supplies of crude oil through this branch of the pipe-line from Kirkuk. General manager of Iraq Petroleum Company told source there is now nothing to prevent supplies of crude oil up to capacity, ( 2 , 000,000 tons per annum) from being sent to Tripoli. Refining facilities at this port very limited but could be sent by sea along the coast to be refined in Roumania, Italy or France. ^ 12 . Petroleum situation in Syria precarious. Existing stocks of aviation spirit would only suffice for 200 aeroplanes operating under war conditions for a fortnight. Supplies of motor spirit only sufficient for ^ J ' ; ' few weeks.. Source has located stocks and a few successful air raids would materially diminish the French power of resistance. [Copy sent to Mr. Somerville Smith.]TIC [Cypher] Sir M.- Lamp'son.

It is, however, important on general grounds to avoid emphasising gratuitously and publicly any intention we may have to over-ride the existing international instruments establishing status of Syria and the Lebanon. 2. From this point of view, there are obvious objections to phrase ”1 abolish the mandate' in draft proclamation. Whatever the correct procedure may be for terminating the Syrian Mandate, it cannot be maintained that a proclamation by General Catroux would in itself suffice. 5. This part of declaration should, I think, revert to something like the original wording and read as follows:- ”Acting in this capacity I come to put an end to the 'Mandate and to proclaim you free and independent. '2. This freedom and this independence may be enjoyed 'from now on. You can at your desire ' 4. If coup succeeds, Free French had better take such steps as are open to them to give some colour of legality to xheir dealings with Syria, e.g. by keeping League of Nations informed, as they did in the case of the French Cameroons.2985 1941 @ [CYPHER], DEPARTivIENTaL NO. 1, FROM C.JRQ TO FOREIGN OFFICE. 1.55 a. m. 2/th May, 191.1. 8,45 a.m. 27th May, 1941.

A fortnight' ago negotiations were concluded in Jerusalem for resumption of trade on a large scale between the British on the one hand and Syria and the Lebanon on the other. This resumption of trade was to take the form cf a clearing agreement between Syria/Lebanon and Palestine, but it would have enabled Syria and Lebanon to obtain supplies from much further afield and would have thrown open the gates for a flow of imports from the sterling area. On'the export side it would have provided Syria/Lebanon with a market for her surplus produce. (Here advantages to Syria/Lebanon in terms of specific imports and exports could be elaborated) Agreement provided for exchange of goods in a full year to value of something like a millon pounds. 4* Everything was ready for this agreement to be put into force, A British representative was to have gene to Beirut last week to initial the agreement and the frontiers were to have been thrown open for trade on the 1st June. 5* Then the news came that the French authorities in the Levant were allowing their airfields to be used by the Germans as bases for attacks on the British and their friends In face of this capitulation, the British could not allow the trade agreement to be put into force.

At the moment when the forces of the Free French, united with the forces of Great Britain her ally, are entering your territory, I declare that I assume the powers, responsibilities and duties of 'La France du levant'. ^ This in the name of Free France which identifies herself with the traditional and real France and in the name of her chief, General de Gaulle. Acting in this capacity I abolish the mandate and I proclaim you free and independent. You are therefore from now on sovereign and independent peoples and you can at your desire either constitute your selves into two distinct States or unite in a single State. In either event your statute of independence and sovereignty will be guaranteed by a treaty in which furtherance of our * 1 reciprocal relations will be defined. This treaty will be negotiated as soon as it is possible. Until its conclusion your mutual position will be that of allies united in pursuit of a common idea and aims. Inhabitants of Syria and Lebanon! You will see from this declaration that if the allied forces are crossing your frontier, which they have scrupulously respected up till now, it is not to take away your independence but to assure it. It is not to desecrate territories, it''is to frustrate the designs of the Germans'who are their enemies and yours. It is guaranteed to you to drive out of Syria the forces of Hitler. We cannot tolerate that the 'Levant' should pass into their hands and become an offensive base against our allies and ourselves.We cannot tolerate, we who are fighting for the # liberty of the peoples, that they should little by little inundate your country, take possession of your persons, your goods and your resources, and make of you deportees and slaves. We cannot permit that the populations which France had undertaken to defend should be delivered into the hands of the most pitiless master whom history has known. This is why cur forces are advancing. Inhabitants of Syria and Lebanon.' I satisfy your political aspirations. If you respond to our proposal and rally to ourselves and our Allies I give you the assurance that the British Government will grant you all the advantages enjoyed by free countries who are associated with them. You will immediately obtain entry into the sterling bloc which will open the widest possibilities for your inoorts and exports. You will be able to buy one to sell in all free countries. You will consider these advantages but above all you will meditate upon one last and important point.

United States Government are [grp. undec. ?doubtless] unlikely to be prepared to go so far as to associate themselves with a guarantee.

His Majesty^ Government are prepared, in view of the extreme urgency, to authorise you to accept the best text that you can arrange, but they would like you to be guided by the following views. 2. It would seera most desirable that the declaration, in order to have maximum political effect, should be made at the earliest possible moment, before the Free French enter Syria. Text of declaration will have to be amended accordingly. 5. Declaration should apply to the Lebanon as well as to Syria, and General Spears’ version would require amendment on that point. 4. General Catroux’s version seems to require some drafting amendments. The statement that he 'comes to ma :e France live again for you' is unlikely to appeal to the Arabs, and should be * omitted. The sentence regarding joining the sterling group might be reworded on the lines suggested by Gen ral Spears. In the phrase 'two sovereign States bound to us by a treaty of alliance it might be best to replace the words 'bound to us' by the words 'united with us'. 5. We think General Spears’ draft in some ways preferable to General Catroux’s, but we do not know how far it would be acceptable to General Catroux. It might be better to add to parng ranh 6 of vour telegram No. 1436 (Gen eral Spears* draft) something on the lines of paragraph 5 of General Catroux s draft. 6. It is clearly desirable that we should be associated with General Catroux’s action and we wish to give him all political help in our power. You have authority to support his Declaration and associate His Majesty’s Government with it. You should inform me of the time of its issue in order that we may support it with an announcement in London. 7.

We and our Allies cannot tolerate that G-ermans should use your air bases to attack your neighbours and our troops. We do not wish your countries to become field of battle. My action will protect you against German occupation. Paragraph three.You know what has always been course of events. Germans arrive at first in small numbers. There- follows complete occupation of country. * * ■ V Paragraph four. Once Germans are installed in your countries, you will become their slaves. • They will take possession of all your belongings. If they so decide, they will send you like animals men on one side, women on other, to work for them. They are, remember, most pitiless masters which world has ever known. The Germans begin gently, but once installed in your countries, you will be lost. Paragraph five. I corne to satisfy your political aspirations to put an end to mandate and to proclaim you independence. Henceforth you will be sovereign independent states free to determine yourselves whether you will remain separate or whether you will unite into one state. In either case we are prepared to negotiate with you treaty to ensure these objects. Paragraph six.

[Gp.undec. ?Following] report by Captain Massey British Liaison Officer with Free French in Palestine should be compared with that of Captain Repiton (my telegram No. 77 E.L.S.). From Arab point of view the entry of Free French would not be so unpopular in Lebanon, but an advance there would bring them into contact with Vichy troops. Massey believes that Polish troops might be used with advantage; Repiton does not. 2.. If British forces cannot be sent into Syria there should be at least enough troops to give an impression of a joint Anglo-French operation. 3. It should be made very clear by dint of propaganda that French or Anglo-French forces were only crossing the frontier with a view to attacking the Germans and holding lines of communication. 4. The problem of how the Free French could hold Syria against a possibly hostile population should not be lost sight of. Massey believes that a declaration of Syrian independence by the Free French guaranteed by Britain would do much to allay Arab hostility. He also thought tha a British official of high standing stationed in Syria would tend to give the Arabs faith in the French pledge to respect the independent administration now. 5.. The immediate economic advantage we could offer and pegging of Syrian currency would have a powerful and favourable effect on Arab opinion. 6.. He confirms that the display of British air strength has had an enormous influence on Arab opinion. He also believes that Germany has created a psychological opportunity, as far as the French are concerned, which is not [2 gps.undec. ?likely to recur]. 7 7. The present moment is one of absolute chaos in Syria. Opinion is divided, troops are moving. This latter circumstance would give us considerable advantage if we are in a position to act rapidly.TOl'T (cnnt'.p .) typtr OKP ART ? CKT AL ( £CU 7? ) r*?Pt 0&gt;;1R0 ?0 FOR aGK QFPICK . Sir i .

The Minister for Foreign Affairs thereupon sent for the French Ambassador, reminded him of French obligations to permit the use of the railway by Turkey and said that if the French threat were carried out the Turks would take their own steps to ensure that communications were maintained. I asked whether this would mean control of the railway including AleppQ. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said ’’yes”. 3 3. He thinks the French threat must be due to German pressure. He says there is no^concentration on the Syrian frontier. The Military Attache tells me that the position now is that the Turks have, apart from frontier troops, strong-mountain brigade concentrated in Islahiye area, 17th division at Diarbekir and cavalry division at Urfa.

There is talk of the formation of mild Nationalist Government under Damad Ahmed which the Shahbandar party would apparently support. Further arrests of minor Nationalist and pro- German agitators (action which reduces chancesof successful German inspired troubles and for which my friend is partly responsible), together with increased military patrols etc. have resulted in better order.

Following are points from talk v/hich he had with Oriental Secretary on March 15th. No. Ibn Saud had declared his own steadfast friendship with British # Government and had strongly advised Syrians (and Iraqis in fact) to be patient ana to have confidence in Britain. He was perturbed by German occupation of Bulgaria. B.B.C. Arabic news bulletins were most clearly heard and most popular of all bulletins received at Riyadh. Jamil Mardam had not yet had reliable news about situation in Syria but it seemed to him that trouble would spread and be prolonged unless French authorities met reasonable nationalist wishes. He thought the movement was mainly the result of bad French administration and he did not believe stories of either British or German instigation. He disclaimed any personal participation but offered good offices to help solution. He had no recent contact with Shukri Kawatli. I shall see him myself in a few days when he has had time to collect more news and ideas. He talks of returning to Syria at the beginning of April.

Cairo telegram No. 554 [of March 15th] to the Foreign •- Office [Syria]. — * Decision has now been taken in principle to relax economic pressure on Syria, and you 'should take the * opportunity without delay to extract the maximum political advantage from this. 2 . I leave it to yon to decide how.best to achieve this end. I would, however, suggest that you might seek an early interview with General Dentz and inform him that His Majesty s Government have noticed with satisfaction that, although attitude of French authorities in Syria towards us still leaves much to be de sired, there has been a .noticeable improvement since his arrival. His Majesty's Government are, moreover, some- ,what disquieted by situation in Syria; and they have .therefore decided, as you should be in .a position to [explain in detail very shortly, to relax their economic pressure on Syria to a considerable extent in the hope ;hat this may make his position easier. 5. You might add that it might well be possible to establish even closer measure of co-operation if means could be found to dispel the existing uncertainty as regards the attitude of the French authorities in certain eventualities, of which he will be aware from General Gatroux s letter. 4. You could add that in our view High Commissioner^ main difficulty is political, not economic. By accepting defeat French authorities have obviously shaken their position In Syria and encouraged those elements which wish for independence. It seems to us that to make concessions to these aspirations may be regarded as signal weakness and therefore dangerous. To refuse concessions may prove difficult. In fact if he is to maintain French position in Levant he cannot in our view afford to make false moves. We are-convinced (as you said at the time) that admission of Hentig was serious mistake. We believe that, if recent disturbances were not instigated by this German intriguer, they were direct consequence of excitement caused-by his visit, and^that his return or indeed any further German infiltration might prove disastrous. We would urge High.....High Commissioner therefore most earnestly to avoid these risks in future. 5. You should endeavour to convince him that though v/e do not hold with Vichy we are speaking as friends. He must know that we have no ambitions in Syria, and you can assure him that we do not want trouble there of any sort. We shall continue to use what influence we have with the Arabs to counsel prudence, but surely French Authorities must realise that it is their attitude towards the Germans and Italians which will largely determine Arab attitude towards themselves. Any sigp of yielding to German domination must inevitably cause. Arab unrest. 6 , The most important thing, however, is, as suggested in last paragraph of Cairo telegram under |reference, to prepare the ground as carefully as ! possible for the moment when we shall have to make a definite request for transit facilities. A hint on the lines of paragraph 3 above.may be as far as it is wise to go at a first discussion. But if favourable opportunity occups, you might say that you know that both His Maiesty s Government and the Turkish Government attach great importance to this question of transit facilities. We should for our part be glad if it were possible to reach with the High Commissioner some understanding on the subject, which could if necessary }be kept strictly secret. We trust' we are right in assuming that the French authorities would nox wish in any circumstances to obstruct our war effort. We greatly hope that critical.situation will not arise, but so long as the attitude of the French authorities in Syria remains uncertain we cannot in common prudence give tiem all the help which we would be happy to afford if a satisfactory agreement respecting transit could be reached.

MUM v£vV Your telegram No*13 and my immediately preceding telegram. — * 1* Because of.their inefficiency, corruption and especially their weakness, public opinion has been turning against the French since the Amistice. Prosperity of Palestine and the bankruptcy of Syria through the olockade etc. has contributed largely to the anti-French sentiment. During this period the Italians commenced subsidizing Nationalists but without much effect. Following the Italian defeats Germany took hand and von Hentig's arrival brought matters to a head. He was dissatisfied with the Nationalists on account of their disunion and weakness but not on account of their political principles. 2. Then came the bread scandal which brought anti-Fr^ch sentiment to a head. Profiting by the occasion the Nationalists desiring to redeem their bad reputation with the Germans, started strike^ other parties joining in for prestige purposes but limiting their aims to economic and food questions. Nationalists persisted with the strike although the French, if they had imprisoned a few leaders, stopped meetings and Axis gold, could have easily broken the movement. They took no action and to the Nationalists' surprise and probably the Germans' also the strike succeeded. I do not think the Germans were ready with their organization to profit by the strike and are therefore urging its continuance. 3. Nationalists are I am sure entirely sold to the Germans but they are not really numerous and their power is derived from gold. More moderate elements of the Nationalists everywhere have given way to the fanatics headed by Quw&amp;fJi who have entirely changed the complexion of the party. If Mardam returned to his position L? ultimately] the Nationalists would be uncertain and he could not join Shahbandists. f* _ A P ar ^ from all parties, commerce, industry and landed classes together with the Christians are in the main pro-British in sentiment for economic reasons but they do not raise their voices. ^ e P ea ^ e( ^ Cairo telegram No*39, Please send copy by bag to Jerusalem and Bagdad.

I recognise that main function of the Shahhandar Party is- presumaply, m their own view, to oppose the Nationalist Party, but it is not (repeat not)the policy of His Majesty's Government to pay one Syrian party to fight another. Moreover, our information does not indicate that all the Nationalists have thrown in their lot with the Axis as yet. 0 n .: h L colltrary ’ believed that Hentig was dissatisfied with the Nationalist Party. It is therefore desirable to avoid if possible driving the Nationalists into line with Mufti, and Iraqi pan-Arab extremists. 2 . No final decision has yet been reached about subsidising Syrian parties. There are objections to such a policy which have to be considered in relation to wider developments in the Middle East. It is realised, however, that continued disregard of Syrian approaches to us is dangerous in view of German activities.

He and his colleagues had offered to resign because they were entirely unsupported by the French but offer was not accepted.

Conty than referred to the violent campaign against the French Smnire at present being conducted m German and German-controlled press and radio, in which Syria was named. High Commissioner thought that German plan was to send German Commission here as at Casablanca and had already taken the initiative of telegraohing to Vichy that he aid not want a German Commission here as it would undermine his powers and prestige and could only cause chaos. He had, moreover', warned Vichy that if Germans were permitted to come here violent reaction from us must be expected, probably culminating in our occupying country,' which he would be unable to prevent . 5. Gonty added that another German objective was likely to be Bizerta; if so French Empire would in all probability resist and would re-enter the war; this country, would of course, follow the lead given by Weygand.

His idea is to organize the leading families and respectable people into a party which could, he thought, amalgamate in two or three months with the ShaUta y vW Party whose principles he entirely approved but most of whose leaders he distrusted and who must be eliminated. This is also my view but I am not certain that he is strong enough to do so though it is eminently desirable. 4. He claimed to have great influence over some quarter of a million Kurds in Damascus^ Jezirah and Kuneitra ? through their paramount chief. I know of intimate friendship with ohis chief but do not know the extent of the latter s influence. 5. Again I found it difficult to extract estimated expenditure as he said it depended on our ideas and on future events. Eventually I got him to agree press would cost £100 per month, youth movements, running expenses car travelling and bribes to officials for information, grant of £100 whiles50 would be needed fof parties and presents to the leaders of families etc., i.e. £250 per mensem. As he would be without a car if he left office, he would need a car, costing say £500. He subsequently asked whether we could Secret increase/Qur^cuA. 2 . increase this amount at the beginning until the crisis whi^ he expected in the three months ending July next, reducing expenditure thereafter but I consider this unnecessarye 6 . He preferred non frequent lump sum payments in gold to reduce chances of compromising himself 0 'He could go to the frontier of Transjordan or to the neighbourhood of station T5. on Tripoli pipe line to collect the goldjif gold was not possible he preferred iadH-o-ofr money and alternative to that Palestinian or Iraqi notes which would have to be changed on the Black Bourse. ?• If the scheme is approved His Majesty's Consul General at Beirut can spare me the Syrian equivalent of about £1,000 to start the scheme.

I doubt whether their genuine co-operation could be obtained by money without an assurance of some measure, of sympathy and support for their political aspirations. It might not be necessary to publish such an assurance at this stage, but of course its existence would soon become known. 3. In considering their attitude towards the nationalist movement in Syria-H-is majesty's Government will no doubt weigh carefully the reactions which developments in Syria will have presumably in Palestine but certainly in Iraq. Here political leaders are much more royalist than the King and egged on by the ex-Mufti and other external influences are keenly, if foolishly, determined to assert Pan-Arab interests in both Syria and Palestine, You will have noticed from my vV/ telegram No. 1 6 of the 6 th January how Nuri at once sought to / exploit in Palestine story that French were about to put Faisal oh the throne in Syria. A. I trust therefore that endeavours to keep on good terms with Jamil Hardam and his friends, the value of which I entirely appreciate, need not be such as to stir up dangers existence of which are evidently realised by General Catroux - see paragraph 3 of Cairo telegram No. A3o I imagine too that French suspicions in Syria France and perhaps elsewhere will need as careful handling as Arab effervescence. 5. It is not clear to me what help His Majesty^ Government expect to need from the population in Syria especially now that our own position in the Middle East is so much/\ [Copies sent to Mr. Loxley]. much stronger than it was last summer. If however the time does come for an assurance on the lines envisaged in paragraph U of your telegram No, 30 to Cairo it may be prudent not to follow too closely Iraqi model and to maintain for example restrictions on a native army and on extent of external independence, a diplomatically independent 'Syria for the Syrians' might easily become Syria and Lebanon for the Turks, Greeks, Italians or Germans if not also the Russians and cause a sea of future trouble agitating Palestine, Iraq and the whole Arab world.

Nuri recalled that it had always been thought that Fuad Hamza (Saudi Arabian Minister at Vichy) had special mission of canvassing Faisal’s claims to Syrian throne and that only a little over a month ago, Iraq Minister at Vichy had reported that something of this kind was in the wind. He also suggested that sudden departure of Syrian politician Saadullah Jabri from Bagdad on pilgrimage to Mecca was connected with this plan. 3* Nuri thought that Syrian nationalists would accept Faisal and had no doubt that Ibn Saud would welcome offer of throne to one of his sons. He suspected that the plan had German inspiration and said tha'c if put through it would sfrengmO'n'pro-Nazi feeling amongst Arabs. In conclusion he expressed the fear that British policy in Palestine would appear in a still more unfavourable light by comparison with these developments in Syria and urged that early steps should be taken to go forward with constitutional development in Palestine envisaged in policy of May 1939.

No. 1, b b b b h b Pour separate sources state that the French authorities are seriously considering change of regime here. Two reports say that the proposal is: (a) to institute some form of Nationalist Government, (b) to establish a Kingdom with either Faisal’s son, Ibn Sa or a Moroccan as king. Two reports including the best 2. Motives for such a policy might be (a) to minimise our chances of provoking internal disorder to assist British occupation-a fear constantly displayed, (b) to satisfy Italian demands to see the Nationalists, their proteges, in power. 3. Although the Proc ureur General in the Shahbandar murder trial yesterday withdrew the charges against the {Nationalist leaders, their accession to power would arouse bitter resentment in the Shahbandar party who would then be lall the more on our side. The French seem to recognize this as they have approached two minor Nationalist leaders, the first of whom is alleged to have refused responsibility. 4-. Opposition policy might be expected also from the Nationalist Party who would probably demand more liberal treat ment than the French are at the moment prepared to grant, and from adherents of the present Government of functionaries who would lose their jobs. 5. A source very near to the President of the Council says that meeting of some 500 persons having [? heard] of the proposals sent a protest to the High Commissioner when he was here on January 5th and 6th stating that their preferences in order were (a) continuance of the present regime, (b) Government formed as a result of free election, (c) Military lav/. mention only (a).

I cannot guarantee the.accuracy of the above reports , but on general grounds there is .reason to believe that any change 01 regime at the moment may provoke more disorder than it would allay. 7*. If 'khe French come to this conclusion and make no cnange immediately it might be useful for us to make a declaration of benvolence towards post-war Syrian independence i which would tend to unite both parties with us against Vichy i and the Axis, and would steal their thunder.

What they apparently •have in mind is a Round Table conference between ; us and 1 leaders, of all political parties in Syria, at which we jwould undertake to use our influence after the war to ;ensure the establishment of an independent Syria. In ’return they would regard Syrian question as distinct from that of Palestine and rally to our cause. 2. As you are aware from.my telegram-N o. 57 1 to Bagdad [of November 10th], I am not inclined to under estimate difficulties of working y/ith Syrian Nationalist leaders. Nor should I take very seriously any under taking by these leaders to leave Palestine politics alone. : Moreover, anything in nature of Round Table conference or i public commitment'seems impossible in present circumstances, if only in view of French reactions. At the same time it is, I think, important to prevent Nationalists lining up with Axis Powers as Mufti has done, and it would have better effect still in Iraq and other Arab countries if they were actually to look to us for support. Further, although I agree with High Commissioner of Palestine and General Catroux that it would be unwise to precipitate Arab revolt (see paragraph 4 of Jerusalem telegram No. 1206 to Colonial Office [of November 21st]), it seems clear that unless ground is well prepared beforehand, neither we nor Free French can expect any help from population in Syria if and when we need it. 3. In spite of the difficulties I am therefore inclined on balance to think that an effort should be made to establish contact now with Syrian refugees in Iraq, and that, if they appear genuinely anxious to c o-operate with us, we should consider providing them with money for expenses of their organisation. At the same time it might be desirable to establish contact with other elements in Syria, in particular the Druzes. Please consult General Catroux and let me know his views as soon as possible. 4. There is a further complication on Y/hich I should also like his views indue course. We are, for obvious reasons, anxious to avoid commitments of any kind, and have good reasons for representing to Syrians that it is not reasonable to press us to commit ourselves.

Delegate went no further but other two said that since &lt;=l. Italian Disarmament Commission arrived they had been working hard in this direction. Iraqi added that the bands were being formed in DeirEsZor region to operate against Iraq and especially the oilfields c He said French knew of this move and while not helping it were not preventing it. Apparently Italians are seeking mercenaries mainly amongst Kurds but Iraqi said that Italians were also working with ex-Mufti in Bagdad (whom he urged should be much more closely watched) and that the latter having received promises that he would be made Arab ruler had askeu Nationalist bloc here to raise disorders in Syria and Palestine,, Bloc were, he said, prepared to create disorders here but not in Palestine because they considered their aims were best served by a British victory. Iraqi Consul-General considered danger very real and urged that action should be talien at once to counter Italian activitv. He suggested best way would be to imitate these tactics and raise bands who would bribe or intimidate Italian organisations. He added that he had been requested by Nationalist bloc to approach me with an offer of 'their services in this connection. That^party would, however, greatly prefer to declare a provisional Syriaiq Government based on Palestinian frontier which would, he said, act under our guidance: to do this they would rerpiire financial backing and some arms. Iraqi Consul-General said he had consulted Turkish Consul who was submitting to his Government the io.ea of forming counter-bands to operate from Turkish frontier. Iraoi^ considered his Government, if consulted, would uive unofficial (facilities to anti-Italian bands. I feel there is some truth in these three reports that the Italians are fomenting trouble in Palestine and here. I am, however, suspicious or Iraqi’s insistence on use of Nationalists who are known to be Iraoi nominees and who have always been suspected of intrigues with Axis Powers.

As movement towards British in Syria gains impetus the education is bound to arise as to what financial responsibilities Great Britain v/ill be prepared to assume in respect both of French troops and civilians and of general administration of the country. As tempo of movement is accelerated by change in situation in Syria or in the course of the war, the question might become of utmost important at any moment and might even be decisive factor affecting success of any coup. I therefore consider that those who might be consulted by French Authorities should be in a position if occasion should arise, to make an authoritative statement on the present intentions of HcM’s Government in the matter. 2« I have not overlooked the previous general statement of H = M 0 Government’s intentions in regard to the financial support of the French Empire if it adheres to our cause which was contained in the concluding paragraph of your circular despatch No,. 108 but should be glad if it might be confirmed that this would still apply in the event of re-entry of any part of the French Empire into the war. The form of subsidization outlined in paragraph 11 of Foreign Office telegram NOo53 to Beirut is not in ray opinion to be recommended at this stage as, even if such an ultimatum were accepted by the French authorities it could only lead to a further period of dtting on the fence and half-heartedly benevolent measures which might be more effective in killing the spirit of resistance among French Troops than oppression or overt enemy action. 3 U I suggest that any statement to be made should cover not only salaries and pensions of serving civil officials and troops but provision of maintenance of social services at least for a given period of stocktaking.. I further recommend that arrangements be made for the despatch to Syria immediately following upon the adherence to us of supplies^ of those commodities&lt;f which she is most in need, as a material advertisement of benefit of action taken.r f 7 t 6.

Telegram to Mr. Joint (Leopoldville; Foreign Office, 12th September 1940. No.187. IQKET . Your telegram IIo.l69 (of 5th September: Syria and the Lebanon .j Please give following message to General de Larminat. Begins. H.M.G. have recently receive: information from various sources showing that: (a) movement in favour of General de Gaulle is growing among Frenchmen in Syria and the Lebanon. This is largely due to arrival of Italian Armistice Commission with consequent humiliating demands, but also to letters describing deplorable state of France, and example of revolts in Central Africa; (b) movement is particularly noticeable among younger military officers and civilian officials. Gmail groups are working in all principal centres. (c&gt; main difficulty at present is that these groups lack leadership and are not always aware of each other's existence. If their efforts could be directed and co ordinated they mi^t spread very rapidly. (dj a valuable impulse might be given if General de Gaulle could now send some well-known representative to Middle East with whom his supporters could get in touch and who could, in suitable broadcasts, stress points made in (a; above and describe efforts of 'Free Frenchmen' elsewhere to continue struggle. (ej High Commissioner is now regarded in French circles as weak and over-cautious and is almost universally discredited. (f; Although prospects of movement are favourable, much preparation still remains to be done before a coup could be attempted. 8. H.M.G. woulc naturally welcome a coup which restored French administration and forces in Syria and Lebanon to Allied front. But situation there differs fundamentally, as you yourself will be aware, from African territories inhabitedby primitive negro populations, and have to take account of possible reaction on Arab sentiment, both local and external, which naturally tends to regard collapse oi Prance as heaven-sent opportunity of achieving independence. In view of explosive qualities of Arab problem, H.M.G, consider it important that no action should be taken which would lead to weakening of French control (under whatever leadership; to a point where internal security could no longer be main tained. They think it equally important to avoid action which would lead to a hostile attitude towards them on the part of French forces. 5, They therefore consider that (i) coup should be organised from within (that is to say by Frenchmen among Frenchmen); (ii; leaders of coup should realise that they will be faced immediately with question of Arab aspirations towards constitutional advance, and that requirements of Allied war effort in Middle East may render desirable some declaration on this subject. (iii/ No coup should be attempted until there is reasonable probability of complete success. 4. In view of your experience and high prestige in Syria, H.M.G. would warmly appreciate any recommendation you might feel able to make for promoting an internal coup while avoiding the dangers referred to above. In particular they would be glad to receive your suggestions as to the most suitable representative of General de Gaulle to send into Syria and Lebanon to report if the moment seemed ripe to initiat*^ more active measures. Such a representative would naturally keep in closest contact with General 'avell. Repeated to Cairo No.924, Jerusalem No.826 and Beirut Ho.107.

Meanwhile all indications suggest that right moment is fast approaching and selection of leader urgently necessary. 3. For various reasons it will unfortunately be physically impossible for General de Catroux to arrive on scene for at least three weeks, even if he feels able and willing, when we can get in touch with him, to go eastwards himself (he is arriving here shortly, having already pledged himself to General de Gaulle)* If, tuerefore, there is to be early action, leader must be found on spot. 4. Pending eventual suggestions from General de Larminat and General de Catroux, I shall be glad if you, as well as His Majesty's Ambassador at Cairo, Commander-in-Chief Middle East, and High Commissioner, Jerusalem, to all of whom this telegram is being repeated, will put forward any suggestions you may have for this leader. Name of General Arlabosse suggests itself, I realise from your telegram Ho. 108 [of August 30th:J that he was not then in favour of immediate action, although he might now agree that situation has ripened rapidly. Moreover, I am not sure whether he could leave mandated territories, and while it would be for the leader eventually selected to judge for himself it seems doubtful whether necessary appeals and preparations could be made adequately by anyone working from inside mandated territory only. There is just a chance that General de Catroux might be willing to send him a message urging him to take the plunge in person.

They csn and roust, however, adopt the line that whatever the solution is to be, it is of interest to other Arab States all of whom have some claim to be consulted. This point would become of special importance should any question arise of adoption of a monarchical form of government in Syria. 2. Following for your c nfidential guidance. If therefore support of His Majesty’s Government were desired with French authorities or people of Syria for any candidate for throne of Syria, they would probably reply that they could not give it without knowing attitude of Ibn Saud, Emir Abdullah and Regent of Iraq towards that candidate. As this line would no doubt make it very difficult to find a candidate at all, it mi^ht also have to be made clear at some stage that it did not mean that any of these three rulers was, in the view of His Majesty’s Governriient, necessarily entitled to hold up indefinitely a solution/ -£&gt;\3Ad.dre»ii«d to Foreign office.

R. 6.48 pdiio 3rd September, 1940. No. 117 IM PORTAN T SECRET My telegram No. 1C1, first paragraph. During the past week there have been indications that the local movement in favour of General de Gaulle has increased considerably. Increase is expected to continue as German attacks on England fail during the current month. Following resume of the views expressed by some of the many Frenchmen who have been privately in touch with this Consulate-General and Damascus Consulate, is passed to you for transmission, if you see fit, to de Gaulle. 2. Possibility of the Syrians eventually joining in the Gaullist movement is no longer as remote as it seemed until recently, as a result of the demonstration of the British will and power to resist, arrival of letters from France describing its deplorable state, revolt in French Central African territories and local economic difficulties showing inability of the Syrians to live independently of the neighbouring countries^ 3. Support for Viehy Government is now on the wane amongst the younger military officers and civilian officials, many of whom are wondering whether joining with de Gaulle would not be the better course. Small groups are working in all the principal centres to spread propaganda on behalf of de Gaulle. 4. Main difficulty at present is that these groups lack leadership and are not always aware of each other’s existence. If their efforts could be directed and co-ordinated they might spread very rapidly. 5. It is suggested that a valuable impulse might be given to the movement if de Gaulle could now send some well-known representative to the Near East with whom his supporters in this country could get in touch and who could, in broadcasting Cairo and particularly Jerusalem the facts in second paragraph above, stress the humiliation of the presence of Italians in Syria and describe the efforts of the free Frenchmen elsewhere to continue the struggle. He should not attack Vichy or High Commissioner until reaction here became clearer.6. General has 'been mentioned hy several persons as being ideal for such a representative on account of his reputation in this country. If he could he sent to Cairo thought he could.exert important influence on French opi here. 7. As stated, preceding paragraphs represent views expressed by French themselves. I would add the following comments. 8. High Commissioner is now almost universally discredited in this country for his supineness. His broadcast of 30th August (my tar.egrams Nos. 115 andjLlb) and his apparent failure to secure from the Vichy Government the small concessions necessary to restore normal relations with His Majesty’s Government, begin to suggest that he is incapable of fulfilling desiderata of His Majesty’s Government otf of resisting any attempt of Italian commission to create a base of hostile activity in this country. I venture to suggest, therefore, that we should as far as possible encourage pro-Gaulle propaganda (which could be linked with pro-British propaganda advocated in my telegram under reference) here in the hope that the situation may eventually becone ripe for a complete volte face . For the benefit of surrounding Arab countries we can truthfully stress the economic advantages that would result for the Arab population from adhesion to British orders, though I have in any case no reason for believing that the Arabs in general would not view with favour the re-entry of Syria into the war on our side.

He then stated that although alleged agreement had been negotiated with Palestine, His kajesty T s (government had refused to consent, thus subordinating the normal excnanges between Palestine and Syria to^settlement of the maritime dispute born of aggression against the French Fleet. It had seemed permissible to hope that His majesty s Government in the interest of the Arab population of the Near East would not raise such economic barriers, but on the contrary economic pressure seemed about to be generalised, for when the High Commission had turned to Iraq they had been told that the petrol there belonged not to the Government but to British companies which disposed of it as they liked. Syrians and Lebanese must understand that if the blockade appeared to be in process of imposition round their frontiers France which had always shown itself favourable to free exchanges throughout Arabic countries was in no way responsible. His Majesty’s Government hah it was true now authorised export of limited quantity of petrol but the question of principle remained unsolved and the population must prepare for further restrictions. 2 0 I will telegraph further what are local reactions to this ill-timed tirade.

He did not mention cutting off of oil supplies l l rom — Iraq, but according to his account the proposed representations included a somewhat threatening statement that Arab Governments would not be responsible for the consequences if their recommenda tions were not adopted. 3. *Yusuf Yasin* said he had reported *Nuri's* enquiry to *Ibn Saud* who had indicated to him confidentially that he would not answer until he had obtained the views of His Majesty's Government through His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. *Yusuf Yasin* added that he hadnot yet received any further instructions and had been obliged to invent excuses with which to meet ♦Nuri's* impatience for an early reply. 4. I ascertained from *Yusuf Yasin* that he had no independent * corroboration* of *Nuri's* account of French oppression in Syria and reminded him that, as I had already observed to Minister for Foreign Affairs, earlier and similar stories which had been widely believed had subsequently proved to have been greatly exaggerated. 5. I then remarked on delicate and varying nature of the situation in Syria and [3 grps. undec.] the points summarised in paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 445, observing that the fact that the King *Ibn Saud* himself had immediately sought the views of His Majesty s Government showed my advice to *Nuri* to do the same had been good. 6 . *Yusuf Yasin* begged that our conversation and the fact that *Ibn Saud* had consulted His Majesty's Government should be kept strictly confidential.

Release of crews without ships is a concession of very doubtful value and in any case, as a matter of principle. His Majesty's Government must insist unon release of ships before they permit resumption of traffic by sea. Moreover', supplies to Syria of petroleum products will in any case have to be strictly rationed and I entirely agree with High Commissioner for Palestine that in present circumstances it would not be prudent to allow importation of as much as 2,500 tons, which I understand represents about one month's supply. On the other hand, the High Commissioner seems to be doing his best to get outstanding issues satisfactorily settled, he has already met with considerable success and it seems reasonable to allow him a little more time to win round Vichy Government further. 2. You may, therefore, inform him that His Majesty's Government must stand out for release of British ships as well as sailors. They recognise, however, that he is doing his best to get matter settled satisfactorily, and in order to allow a little more time for his representations to Vichy Government to have effect, they are for their part prepared to authorise release of certain amount of petroleum products for immediate Syrian requirements, Sciy supplies for one fortnight. Tnis is of course, conditional on High Commissioner being able to make satisfactory arrangements with oil companies as regards payment and transport by land. Companies are being told that they may enter Into negotiations with High Commissioner on basis set forth above. 3. Please inform High Commissioner accordingly. You should make it clear that this is purely interim arrangement to give him a little more time, and cannot be repeated. 5.

He and his near colleagues are friendly and if he is recalled he may well be replaced by somebody less friendly. Should we not therefore try to help him to carry on his administrative duties by treating the German agreement as a •Hirely local arrangement beneficial to each of the parties?

Secretary General expressed the view that there would be no legal grounds on which the Turkish Government could refuse to allow such a commission to pass through. Even if they did not ask for facilities as a commission, they could ask for them as private individuals and there would be no grounds to refuse. Horeover, Turkey was at present relying on transit facilities through Italy for a number of Turks who are returning from France, 4.

Your telegrai'as _Nos c 66^ 69 [Doth of the 31st July] and 72 [ of the 1 st August: SyriaX In view of what seeraed on the whole satisfactory attitude of French High Commissioner in his conversation with you. His Majesty’s Government were prepared to authorise High Commissioner for Palestine to bring clearing agreement into force at once and to permit oil companies to supply petroleum products of all kinds sufficient for immediate Syrian requirements. Action of French authorities with regard to British ships has, however, radically altered position. For obvious reasons, His Majesty’s Government have made general rule not to permit any ships under their control, whether British or not, to call at any ports where British ships have been or might be seized. Nor can they be expected to furnish economic or financial assistance to territory where action is taken directly inimical to British interests. 2. Action of Vichy Government shows that their alleged lack of interest in Syrian questions does not, as the High Commissioner seems to think, provide sufficient basis for maintenance of satisfactory relations between French authorities in Syria and His Majesty's Government. In the interests of their position in Syria French authorities must be prepared to take a more positive line than they have as yet seemed to contemplate, either by ignoring certain instructions from Vichy or by arranging for them to be cancelled. It seems necessary to bring this home to them on the present occasion. 3. With this end in view, alternative courses of action open to His Majesty's Government seem to be (1) to refuse to bring clearing agreement into force until ships and crews have been released (in return for which retention of s.s. 'Patria' would be brought to an end), or (2) to allow clearing agreement to come into force forthwith, but withhold all supplies of certain essential requirements, in particular petroleum products, until question of ships has been satisfactorily settled. I would prefer former course as being likely to prove more effective, and unless High Commissioner for Palestine informe you that he anticipates that continuance of present volume of trade, without clearing agreement would lead to serious consequences for Palestine currency, you should tell M.

The passage of an ’'Armistice Commission,” which must be composed of military officers and whose object would be to ensure disarmament of French forces as prescribed by terms of armistice and thereby to facilitate conduct of war by Germany and Italy against Great Britain, should, I am advised, be regarded as falling within this prohibition.

He said that according to the Treaty of Lausanne* Turkey had relinquished all its rights in the territories detached, from the 'ottoman State to the people of those territories including Syria, The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs also stated that there was a document in Turkey f s possession which stated that France would not cede Syria to a foreign state without Turkey*s I approval* In addition he said that it was natural that Turkey should not wish that raxy foreign state should enter Syria and Turkey preferred and esen wished that Syria should become an independent State, 2, The president of the Republic confirmed the fact that the Government supported entirely the independence of Syria but considered that we should take our time in adopting that course and that it would be best if the claim to independence was made first by the Syriana(?) themselves after which the two states Turkey and Iraq could support it whenever the nQcei-.sity for support arose, TheTurkish Government would open die cuss.ions with the British Government on the subject of the restoration to Syria National(?)

IIviPORTANT. • • O C O 9 C O • • • « / Your telegram No. 53. On July 29th I discussed all points raised hy you. Discussion was frank and cordial hut whilst Monsieur *Puaux* left me in no doubt as to his person* 11 sentiments which he expressed frankly in words ;i every true Frenchman can but hope for a British victory”, he was equally frank in stating that he would submit to all orders from Vichy. At the same time he gave me to understand that he would seek from Vichy as few instructions as possible in the hope that he would be left alone to carry on administration of these territories as unobtrusively as 'possible. He said that for the time being neither axis partner had time to think about *Syria* and it was to our mutual advantage to do nothing to bring *Syria* into limelight. Referring to your telegram under reference by paragraphs: (1) High Commissioner fully realised this and counts on clearing agreement with Palestine and perhaps also on similar arrangements with Egypt and Iraq to overcome existing difficulties. As regards financial position it v/ould seem that there is no shortage of Syrian currency to enable administration to carry on for some months. _ So far only soldiers conscripted in neighbouring countries of the Levant have been demobilised. ' Rest of demobilisa tion must take place in France but no transport is available and no date for demobilisation is fixed. (3) High Commissioner will of his own [grp. undec.] do nothing to hamper war effort of His Majesty's Government: negotiations for clearing agreement with Palestine are actually under discussion in Beirut and pending its conclusion perishable goods are again going free into Palestine. As regards economic help High Commissioner mentioned blocking of balance of original 200,000 pounds exchange and i gave him explanation contained in your telegram No. 0057. I added that His Majesty's Government's wish to see a strong and stable administration here and if it were really friendly would be prepared to help it materially. He then informed me that he had heard that sterling credits *of Banque de Syrie* had also been blocked. (4.a) In discussing this High Commissioner said that fortunately such an attack could not take *olace since there was no way open ■' to Italians or Germans. Coulcl it conceivably happen it would seemingly be in contravention of terms of armistice and in absence of orders would be resisted. He added in answer to my further ^ question that he could not imagine Vichy Government agreeing to it. (b) As reported in my telegram No^_56 _a section of Arabic impress has been publishing Anti-British articles and I again drew hat 9 ki UAo % ao*w: fc.tj, l UjC High(i) 1 ffl Vt&gt;ai^U*v»*»ce of Ordcf. 2 . High Commissioner’s attention to this and said that in view of censorship of press I could hut conclude that censorship authorities connived at spreading such sentiments, I added that [grp. undec. ] French broadcaster who is also censor was often at fault m suppressing certain facts such as who torpedoed the Meknes and who saved thousand odd lives whereas he stressed the point that neither Vichy nor Germans were informed in advance of date of sailing or of ports of departure or arrival. I added that I considered this attitude on the part of Ilonsieur Chambard distinctly unfriendly. High Commissioner premised to instruct Chambard to change his attitude and to take more care^about what was published in Arabic press. In answer to my question as to whether he would prevent German and Italian agents of any kind from coming here he said it was unusual for such people to come to former enemy country until a peace treaty had been signed and so far as he knew armistice did not provide for return of Consular or other agents. He con cluded by saying that if question arose Vichy would have to decide. I emphasised the importance of this point and said that His Majesty s Government would take a very grave view of a situation which would allow enemy agents possibility of fomenting trouble on door^step of Palestine and on fringe of Arab countries. High Commissioner told me in this connexion that the Turkish Government had assured French Ambassador at Angora that if a disarmament Commission wished to come here by way of Turkey passage v/ould not be allowed. (c) High Commissioner was fully alive to this in the interests oi his own country 5 and would do nothing to disturb Arab opinion. He added he had for a moment thought of bringing nationalist bloc back to power in Damascus, but had decided it was best to deal with Arab aspirations only when war was finished. He complained of meddlesomeness of Nuri and asked whether we could not influence him to stop his present interference in Syrian affairs. He also mentioned two Palestinians at present here who were meddling in Syrian problem and said he would have a warning conveyed to them. He did not think Syria would be a nuisance if outsiders would not meddle. (d) This point had High Commissioner's wholehearted approval and he^added^when he heard my complaint a few days ago that his Economic Adviser had stopped Syrian produce from going to Palestine mTl No. _62). he nad the matter put right. c~urabaJ (e) High Commissioner quite realised this and said there was no chance, so long as we controlled the sea, of any crude oil falling into enemy hands. He said he hoped to be able to [grp. undec.] this oil by some amateur process for local use. Hi g h Commissioner fully endorsed this and in a tentative drait letter covering Syrian-Palestinian Clearing Agreement he mentioned necessity of so doing. (g) There is in fact no hindrance to this. ^(n) There was a certain difficulty over this point, High Commissioner taking the view that normal foreign representatives did not have Press offices in neutral countries but that their side of the case was presented by local news agencies. I did not wish to argue this point too far at present but rather to wait and see the result of my complaints under (b) above. French and Arabic broadcasts from Jerusalem, Cairo and London are listened to widely and I doubt whether our pre^s office could usefully add much even if we could get it publ^beci. w&gt;tf&gt; PevteaKn* . Covvsd &amp;.&lt;■ . H M. 6 .% 3. £*) I told High Commissioner that in my opinion, question of detained ships spoilt our relations and I ashed whether he could not get Vichy to agree to an exchange. I pointed out to him that normal and only satisfactory way of getting petrol supplies from Haifa was by sea but that this was impossible so long as the French authorities maintained their order to keep three British ships here. He replied that he realised the importance of getting these ships freed and of fixing up some modus vivendi for the future but Vichy seemed obdurate and Admiral Carpentier had been severely scolded for having agreed to an exchange without the consent of Vichy., He, however realised its importance and said he would think over ways and means of again presenting a proposal to his Government. % own feeling as regards the relations with local French authorities is that if we crould get this question of ships cleared up we should go a long way towards getting back to a state of normal relations. 5. I put the point to High Commissioner that he might find himself unable to discharge his mission at some given time without help from His Majesty's Government and whether in that case he would put the case bluntly to Vichy, he avoided a direct reply but said Vichy did not seem to wish to be bothered with Syria and he himself did not wish to bother Vichy. He had some time ago asked for a certain [?discretion] to carry on; this had not been turned down, and he took it for granted that be could exercise a certain liberty of action in so far as his administrative duties were concerned. The above covers all points raised. I would only add that High Commissioner does nor appear to have any great influence at Vichy and that Vichy would appear to have little time to devote to Syria.

(5) Demobilisation of French forces from whatever cause must mean that French position would be insecure if His Majesty s Government were to cease to restrain Arab nationalists and might become untenable, in spite of French forces, if His Majesty s Government were to give nationalists active encourage- men t. 2 . All this seems to give His Majesty's Government strong lever over French authorities. t- . 2 n °ther hand, it is most important for His Majesty s Government that Syria and Lebanon shall not be used to hamper their war effort. Moreover, Palestine Government are anxious that their supply position shall not be complicated by cessation of imports from these territories. To secure these desiderata His Majesty s Government are prepared to give French authorities political assistance in maintaining their position and sympathetic consideration to requests for economic or financial help. 4. It is obviously impossible for His Majesty’s Government to define in advance all the points on which they would expect -French co-operation. So far as can be foreseen, however, their immediate requirements can be summarized as follows, it being understood that they might make additional requests from time to time, but would not press demands inconsistent with the position of the French administration as the controlling authority in Syria and the Lebanon: (a) French authorities should in the event of attack by Germany or Italy, whatever instructions they may receive from RECd.

Form of the article strongly suggests it has been inspired. 2. It is noticeable that ban unofficially imposed by High Commission on all Syrian exports to Palestine (ray telegram No. 56 to Jerusalem first paragraph) has been /kept out of the press here (though I understand I notification of it appeared in Damascus press probably through oversight) and only the inspired paragraph appeared, suggesting that it is Palestine authorities who are stopping these exports entering Palestine intentionally (gr.undec.) to prepare the ground for blaming on His Majesty’s Government any shortage here 5 which may result from any action of the latter caused by unsatisfactory attitude of French authorities. 3.

My tele grain No. i.0 to the Foreign Office. Attitude of I 7 .. Reclus, Economic Adviser of the French High Commission, in respect of negotiations with Palestine seems to he covered by the conviction that Palestine must accept whatever terms this country offers because she has more need of Syrian products particularly of foodstuffs than Syria has of Palestinian products. At a meeting with representatives of Oil Companies yesterday he stated publicly that British Army hcrses in Palestine were about starved through lack of Syrian barley. He appears to have privately forbidden all exports to Palestine since 12th July on the pretext of making a starting point for his agreement with Palestine but actually no doubt [? was] coercing Palestine. 2. As regards petrol , need for which is becoming imperative he has nov/ place[?d] at the disposal of Shell and Socony jointly the whole remaining £A0,000 of his sterling credit in England in exchange for £30,000 worth of petrol, balance to go towards debts owing to them by the Administration, if they are unwilling to accept he appears to think that he can obtain ample from Roumania in exchange for Syrian cotton. 3. Reclus’s ignorance and inefficiency which have long been notorious here probably prevent him from appreciating full seriousness of the economic position as indicated in my tele grain under reference. If settlement with Palestine is not reached too soon he may become more amenable as facts become more obtrusive. No. •k Vl vl • Repeated to Foreign Office.

The Foreign Office have declared at Angora, Bagdad and M 0 SC 9 W that Syrian situation may develop disadvantageously •for Turkish; Arab and Russian interests. The British plan provides for : giving greater part of Syria to Iraq; Iraq to cede to Turkey certain Kurdish districts and parts of the oil-producing area; Iraq to give Great Britain the right to land 500,000 British soldiers at Basra to garrison Syria; Turkey to recover Northern Syria especially Aleppo and parts of Mosul region; England to have the right to occupy during the war ports, aerodromes and strategic points of Syria including part of Tripoli, also a provisional occupation of Aleppo. 5. Article states in conclusion that the President of the Republic and the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs have refused this proposal which had been supported by Nuri Pasha during his visit to Angora, but that they agreed with Nuri Pasha that in the event of France giving up Syria, the Arabs and Turks would not allow a third Power to instal itself in Syria.

Follov/ing is general appreciation of present situation in this country as seen from here. (2) I understand that General uittelhauser is to hand over his comand to General Lucgere, Admiral Carpentier, whose two years of cojiMand ho.s expired^ has handed over to Admiral Couton, (3) Attitude of the senior officials is now one cf complete^subserviency to Retain Government and such impulse to revolt as existed amongst subordinates has disappeared. There is besides a large body of French opinion favourable to Great Britain which has been unaffected by Oran affair but it is silent. (A) Tone of French press and local broadcasting is fairly satisfactory in that British news is still given prominence beside the Retain Government communiques. Arab press is however being allowed and perhaps encouraged to print occasional ! tendencious articles and British-propaganda has been almost ! eliminated uy telegram No. hi regarding closing of our Rress Office). British Broadcasting Corporation's French broadcastings seem to be jammed and are barely heard, though. Jerusalem French broadcasts are excellent and are clearly heard. Nevertheless, large preponderance of news from French sources is not without effect on French opinion generally,, (3) Brmy has not yet been demobilized though this is likely to start soon. I have the impression its morale has improved with collapse of the move suggested into Palestine, i.t present I consider it could with difficulty be persuaded to march against the British even if this were contemplated but would resist on orders any British attempt at incursion. ( 6 ) Local population leaders passive but still hoping for British interference with consequent relief from imminent economic distress. They seem, however, to realise that French control of 1 | internal situation has again tightened up. (7) By relations with authorities are still friendly and whilst/v/i—1st sometines obstructive and always suspicious of British intrigue in Syria, French will probably continue to do what they can to maintain atmosphere of co-operation so long as they have hope of economic assistance from His Majesty's Government [grp, undec;.] Palestine, imperative need for which they are coming to realise. Hhilst they will meekly accept any orders from Pptain Government they will probably try as far as they dare to minimise any adverse effects should they [grp. undec.] on British interests here. ( 8 ) Unless relations between His Majesty's Government and Petain Government undergo further marked deterioration I see no present reason why British subjects should not visit or continue to reside in this country.

The High Commissioner pointed out that His Majesty’s eLamini* so, cer J-V this Government were counting on his ability to country and seemed ready to help him to do so, but that broadcasts of the above nature merely incited Syrian hotheads and would make his task more difficult.

I am repeating to you, Cairo and Jedda my telegram No. 35 to Foreign Office July 6 th, which gave position at that date. High Commissioner told me this morning that he had had no further communication from his Government 'but he indicated in the course of conversation chat whatever his personal feelings were he would have to subordinate them to orders from his Government. Repeated to Foreign Office, Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad and Jedda.It may be uaeful at this stage to stress the ^ xce Y^ * 0 ™ i 1 8Y ® c .?il, 0&lt;n ^ c a 1 inti 1 1 on of French Mandated territories at the presentTI-ne ah&lt;^ extent oT their dependence on the good will of His Majesty’s Oovernment and surrounding countries. According to reliable info nation the present stocks of the following articles of absolute necessity, all of which must be imported, are sufficient for les than two nonths: coal, petrol, kerosene, rice, sugar, condensed milk, spare parts for wars, medicine and industrial chemicals. 3. Owing to drastic restrict! ns of the grant of im&gt;ort licences during the past few months (sec ray telegram No. 9) ^ stocks of many other articles of iraport inee are low. 4. Greater part of all these com,io&lt; itiea must be paid for in sterling or Allied currencies in view of interruption of maritime coramuni cat ions with France, even if the latter could supply, which is unlikely. 5. I understand that local currency co Viands little or no confidence outside the country owing to the disappearance or freezing of gold backing and other securities foimerly in Banoue de France. Syrian pounds are practically unacceptable e*g. in Palestine. Kseential frames can therefore only be obtained (a) by barter or (b) by provision of sterling credits by His Majesty*s Government. 6. Harvest this year is reported good and the country will have surplus cereals which the High Commission hope to dispose ox in Palestine or Greece. Latter possibility depends on blockade not being enforced by the Royal Navy as a result of detention of British ships at Beirut (ray telegram to the c.omrisnder-in-Chief, Mediterranean, repeated to you as No.38). Country may also hope to dispose of exportable surplus olive oil, eggs, tobacco, 1&lt;ether, wool, cotton and potatoes but chiefly in Palestine an perhaps other neighbouring countries. Kstimates I have received suggest th; t even with planned economy ensuring minimum imports and maximum exoorts difference betwe* n the values of former and of the latter may be £8,000,000 sterling per annum. Such planned economy la in any l( case unlikely of fulfilment with the present officials in 4 charge. Difference may therefore well prove greeter. wFill copy SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION &amp; WAR pABIIffi-f Prom SYRIA. * V, • i v-.- w V»/ Decypher. Mr. Gardener (Damascus) . . V 'fifrrMly, 1940.

He was extremely angry |{ over Nuri s visit ? and inferred that he did not believe Nuri had really given the Nationalists advice to remain quiet. 3. He was also angrv over a broadcast from Cairo in Arabic on 4th July in which a commentator is alleged to have said that His Majesty’s Government was involved in a plot based outside Syria to establish Syrian independence. He also said there was another broadcast from Cairo on 6 th July purporting to give account of Nuri’s visit to Damascus followed by Nuri’s denial. These broad casts with those from London and Jerusalem have made relations ver rr tense. __, Egypt was an independent country and nis Majesty s Government could not be responsible for broadcasts., I tried to calm him by assuring him that nis majesty s Government wish to collaborate in maintenance of status quo. 5.

A mo t dangerous situation might arise if Arab politicians came to think that they might, by staging demonstrations or encouraging revolt, lead us to intervene in Syria.

All had heard on the radio His Majesty’s Government’s declaration regarding Syria and all expressed the greatest pleasure thereat. 3. Nuri said neither he nor the Nationalists had any confidence in the French and were convinced that the French policy was to hand over Syria to Italy at any time even before the peace conference hoping thus to lose the minimum of French colonies in North Africa and to ^separate* Italy from Germany, ui ui £ UJ DC o Ui o T&gt; i 2 £ t _J &lt; 2 9 o CM £ e H 141 UJ O 4.

He added in the event of occupation it would be preferable if His Majesty’s Government could make a declaration to the effect that the occupation implied no prejudice to the future state of Syria which must be detenninea by the peace conference, 5. I then read to Nuri a copy of the declaration. He asked whether His Majesty f s Government considered that despatch of a * disarmament* commission or enemy consuls would be giving cause for occupation. I replied in the negative saying as I understood the declaration His Majesty’s Government did not wish *to occupy Syria unless obliged to do so. I explained our occupation would mean distribution of our military force over wider area than originally intended while from a political point of view any occupation would give the Germans dangerous material for anti-British propaganda in Arab States, 6. Nuri replied, the British occupation would not be misunderstood in any Arab State including Syria because it was a military necessity. He added that Iraq would be prepared for the occupation of Mahommedans if His Majesty’s Government would defend Christians i.e. the coastal region. I replied that while I was unaware of *[2 groups undec:]*, I felt sure that they would prefer the sole responsibility. 7. I then continued by saying that on present indications I saw no reason for British occupation, adding I could not believe that the French would wish to transfer Syria to Italy, I concluded by asking him to exert all his influence to restrain Syrians from creating trouble by respecting present constituted R!£Cd.

He added that if after the war French did not grant liberty he would resume his Nationalist campaign. 5. He said that enemy propaganda was now being actively conducted here, being probably based on Iraq. He advocated active pro Ally propaganda campaign to combat it. 4. I am unable to confirm his statement but I consider it probably correct. Organization of such a campaign would probably arouse French suspicions and hostility though Dr. Shahbandar said he would be prepared to have a French-nominated Arab on his committee as a guarantee of good faith. 5.

The first of these facts is that the French still have a very large army in Syria (much more powerful that in 1956) which whatever future may hold has not collapsed yet, and against which Arabs would be completely powerless. Relative reasonableness of Syrian nationalist leaders is presumably due to this factor. Secondly, any form of disturbance' in Syria would facilitate external aggression and might lead to most dangerous situation, not only for Syria, but for other Arab States as well. Thirdly, though this is a point on which opinions might differ, it seems at least very probable that prospects of ultimate independence for Syria have been greatly improved'by the weakening of France, if Axis Powers can be prevented from establishing themselves there and if only Arab politicians will keep quiet. 5. Please do everything in your power to persuade Iraqi politicians to take a more realistic view of the situation. .

I communicated the text of the declaration to the Prime Minister yesterday evening. At the sane time in order to mitigate the dangers forseen in my telegram No.^JOo I explained that it v/as irapossihle for His Majesty s^ Government to decide immediately how they would act in a great variety of possible contingencies ano. thao tne declaration had therefore to avoid aiy promise or commitment. Its object was to make it clear that, while His Majesty^ Government were considering their course of action, they held themselves free to take any measures necessary to safeguard the position. 2. I added that His Majesty's Government must clearly move with caution and that they trustee onat the Iraqi Gov ernment would co-operate with them in preventing any action at present which might increase the difficulties of tne trench authorities in Syria. 3. The Prime Minister said that the declaration so far as it went would be reassuring but it v/ould disappoint those who still hoped that Britain would show the way to the realisation of xirab hopes for the future independence of Syria. He agreed with me that the first need was to safeguard the present but if hot-heads were to be kept quiet hopes must be given for tne future. At present the future was dark and there was no^ indication of hov/ it could be made lighter. ^ There was, he said, a strong demand among the nrabs in Syria and Iraq alike that what was widely believed to be the opportunity presented by the present situation to make a bid for byria s freedom should not be allowed to pass. Though hasty action might, as I had said, do great harm there was no promise that patience would bring better results. M. As the Prime Minister talked in this strain he became rather vdld and seemed to range himself on the side of the hot heads. At one moment he went so far as to ask whether Iraq would be held responsible if insurrection broke out in Syria. 5./w w wmm *S - ^ 2 * 5. In conclusion he said that although Syria was now in the forefront his remarks applied equally to Palestine* I objected that the situation was quite different because our policy had been set forth in the White Paper, whereupon he expressed doubts whether that policy could succeed.

Moreover fresh permutations and combinations occur or are reported daily* 3. Among the few things which are clear are the following: (a) That stability in Syria would be in our best interests but that^there are too many interested parties in and outside the country to afford much hope of this at present. (b) That the plan outlined in telegram under reference would precipitate and aggravate trouble for some of the very reasons attributed to the delegate of Damascus in its favour becuuse of the appointment of a Saudi prince in Syria would at once throw Trans-Jordan into a ferment. 4. I presume that we must await upon events but I very much hope that it may be possible for His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda to dissuade Iba Baud from any tendency to take advantage of half baked schemes formulated by political parties in Syria in the same way as we dissuade the Amir Abdullah from doing the same The Syrian plum is not ripe and is likely to be very indigestiblecmmmmmmmmmmmmmrn* could give «ny sort of promine that thl» would N poaaibl© in all c Ircunata *.ces.

C 111111111 MOST IMMEDIATE o 1 ' You have doubtless seen telegrams passing between the War Office and Liaison Officer about General liittelhauser. 2. Positi 9 n as I see it is as follows: in view of public declarations made by High Commissioner and the General fhe world at large believes that French authorities in Levant States will continue the fight against Germany and Italy in co-operation with Great Britain, Even if General obeys his orders from Bordeaux to demobilise his forces except for those necessary for local security, fact that French authorities would not oppose an attempt by Germany or Italy to occupy Syria and the Lebanon (assuming such an attempt could be made despite the British fleet) will not necessarily become apparent until High Commissioner and General contradict their previous declarations by word or deed (e.g. acknowledging authority of Bordeaux Government). . 5. Within a short time, however, doubts would inevitably begin to grow in Turkey and in the Arab countries about intentions of mandatory authorities and some declaration by His Majesty s Government,for which there is already some pressure, would probably become inevitable. 4. This declaration (about which His Majesty’s Government have not, however, taken any decision) might perhaps be to general effect that His Majesty’s Government could'not allow Syria or the Lebanon to be used by Germany or Italy as a base for attacks on the Arab countries whom Great Britain is pledged to defend, and would have to resist by all the means at their disposal German or Italian attempt to occupy those two countries. It might be necessary to add something to the effect that whatever His Majesty’s Government might find it necessary to do during the war, their action would be entirely without prejudice to the positional Syria and the Lebanon after the war. Wording oi any declaration, if it were decided to make one, would need consideration in order to avoid arousing the suscepti- 01, the French authorities, the Turkish Government and me Araos, 5. In view, however, of the difficult position which will arise if tne French authorities abandon any intention of defending their territory, every effort should be made to encourage g General Mittelhauser to abide by his original intention. For tms purpose it is being suggested to Sir Archibald Wavell that/ 7rECd.FOL.DEPt. 29JUN 940 INDIA OFFICEA ^_I94Q_J 2 . that he should if possible visit Beirut, ahould he do so, please show him this telegram and ask him to do Ms best^ to persuade the General in last resort, if nothing will induce him to stick to his previous declarations, to avoid letting this become generally known at least for a few days, so that His Hajesty*s Government may have an opportunity of considering their course of action. 6. You should in any case do what you can in discussion with the High Commissioner. The various measures of support which His majesty's Government can give to Frenchmen fighting for the Allied cause overseas are already known to you. If there are any further ways in which His majesty’s Government can help the French authorities you should let me know.

Following is paraphrase of telegram from United States Consul General at Beirut of July 11th. [Begins] After General Dents learned what the terras v/ere, he seemed anything except pleased. Every time he came across a reference to Free French Interests he snorted audibly and said it was outrageous and disgraceful of Great Britain to encourage Frenchmen to v/age civil war. He added that he would have no dealings with the Free French, but would deal exclusively with the British. Instructions to do likewise have been given to all French officials v/ho were remaining behind. Dents wanted it distinctly understood that these terms [grp. undec.] serve exclusively as a basis for discussion because several of them were unacceptable in their present form, especially surrender of war material, etc. Our British friends should be prepared, even at the risk of renewing hostilities, to be firm with Dents. It would be dangerous to yield on any but unimportant details or to allow Dents to engage in protracted quibbling. He is already taking advantage of every hour of respite he can gain to move men and material northward and to consolidate fresh positions.

Following is text of a telegram wiaich State Department have sent to-day to United States Embassy in Vichy explaining reason of delay in communicating our terms to Dentz. The sequence of events regarding General Dentz 1 request for armistice terms is as follows:- On morning of July 8 th General Dentz requested Engert to inform the British authorities that he (Dentz) proposed an immediate cessation of hostilities e Engert immediately forwarded this information by triple priority telegram 281 July 8 th, 10 a.m* addressed to London, Vichy, Jerusalem via Angora, and Department, where it was received at 1,15 a*m. July 9th # Immediately upon receipt of telegram, the Department informed the British Embassy in Washington July 9th. As early as noon on July 9th British Embassy in Washington had received British armistice terms from London and handed them to the Department, At 3 p.m, July 9th the Department despatched these terms by triple priority telegram 132 to Beirut, At 6 p 0 m, July 9th the Radio Corporation of America informed the Department that all endeavours to get the message through to Beirut had failed. An effort was then made to send the message by Western Union cable via London and Berne c At 6 C 30 a a m, July 10th Western Union reported that it was also impossible to get • through to Beirut by this means. The Department began communicating terms to you early on morning of July 10th, ,..for (Co) REGd. F'GL, C'&amp;Pt. INDIA OFFICEfor repetition to Beirut and also for coiunrunicatioh to the French Government. The Department also endeavoured to communicate the terms to you hy telephone on the morning of July 10th, hut French telephone authorities refused to permit the connexion, citing the Franco-Geman Armistice provisions as their reason. It is apparent from the above that British Government acted with the greatest pix)mptness in drafting the armistice terms, and that the delay in communicating them was occasioned entirely hy transmission difficulties which Department tried hy every means to overcome. An important fact for which no explanation has heen found is that throughout July 9th and July 10th Department received telegrams from Beirut within a few hours after they were despatched, yet Department lias heen unahle to send any messages to Beirut. The French authorities may desire to investigate the reasons therefor. Furthermore, it might he pointed out to French Government that had Department heen permitted to communicate with you hy telephone, some of the delay against which Vichy authorities complain would have heen avoided. The Department regrets that it was impossible to get the terms to Beirut sooner. It should hardly he necessary to remind French authorities that it was possible at any time during the period under discussion for General Dentz to seek an armistice under a flag of truce, hy direct conversations with his military opponents. [Ends], (2) State Department have also shewn us a telegram dated to-day from United States Embassy in Vichy describing reactions of French Foreign Office to . terms. In spite of information in my teleg ram No.3259 (most immediate) French Foreign Office according to this telegram informed the United States Embassy that our terms would he rejected and that Dentz would he instructed to make such arrangement as he could on the spot.

Consul General reported at 2 a.m. that he had been informed that leaflets had been drooped by the British calling upon Dentz to declare Beirut an open city and requiring answer by 5a.m. Consul General had at once seen Denfz - and urged him either to accede to this demand, or if he felt unable todo so at all events to get into direct touch with British military authorities, even offering to try to go himself with message from Dentz to General Wilson. Dentz had been very indignant, claimed that pamphlet was the work of Free Frenchman not of the British and declared he could not take the initiative in establishing contact with British Military authorities. At Consul General's earnest entreaty he finally consented to try and establish contact by radio but subsequently said that this was impracticable and that he would do nothing to get in touch with the British. When the Consul General urged him to declare Beirut an open city, Dentz declared his inability to turn a Naval base into an open city. He said, however, that he would not fight nearer the city than Khalde, or after the outer defences were pierced, that he would order the heavy guns at Ras Beirut not to fire on British positions unless they themselves were shelled by British Navy and that his A.A. batteries would not fire on British aircraft unless the latter dropped bombs, 3h asking^that this information he communicated to the British authorities, Consul General expressed the opinion that Dentz was insincere in everything he said, and was still playing for time hoping that the Germans would come to his rescue.

Dated July 9th. Begins. Our Military Attach^ was requested by General Huntziger to call on him this morning. The General discussed the situation in Syria at some length. He said (as Rochat had said) that General Dentz had been given “'very wide authority to treat with the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces 11 . There are three possible solutions in arriving at a settlement of this conflict, Huntziger went on to say. two of which the French could 'accept with honour'. He said the third would only serve 'to widen the gap in Franco-British relations'. In view of the fact that they were defeated the French could, Huntziger said, be agreeable to sector in which the French flag might still fly to the French, thus indicating to the world that 'Britain did not desire to acquire French colonies. He feared the third possibility which 'might be forced upon them but would never be acceptable', i.e. that de Gaulle’s units would be placed 'as the occupying forces of Syria and the hoisting of the de Gaulle flag over that area'. The hope was also expressed by General Huntziger that the British would see their way clear to permit the repatriation of the French forces which have been fighting in that area, as well as the possibility of returning to metropolitan France under favourable conditions the widows and children of those French officers and soldiers who had been killed in action.

I agree also with Gardener’s opinion as quoted that declaration should be made that the treaty will not only be accepted but made more liberal. On the other hand I do not understand the further suggestion for modifications in what seems to be the opposite direction. It Is stated that ff military clauses will also have to be lntroduced ,, ; but the treaty of 1936 (or annexed military convention) contained military clauses of a wide character (French garrisons in Jebel Druze and Latakla for some yearsj two specified air Oases.in Syria and military garrisons of unspecified strength and location in ?Lebanon for the duration of the treaty). I have always understood that the reason why the French would not ratify this treaty was that the military party regarded these military clauses as Inadequate whereas the byriana v/ould agree to nothing more. It would appear to be a case not of 'introducing” but of 'excising' or cutting down the military clauses if there is to be any chance of the 1936 Treaty being palatable to the Levant and of avoiding serious trouble. v On this last point it will not have escaped your notice that a very ominous parallel is developing between the course of events in 1919 and 1941. in 1919 there were;-* . ( a ) Similar agitation for unity and independence (including, I may add, restlessness on the part of the Amir Abdullah). (b) National antagonism to the French with political tension leading to grave disorder. (c) Demands for British and not French garrisons* U)19 4 1 (d) Frerch suspicions or our nefarious intentions. 0 ?hese were followed in 1920 after San Remo by (e) Bitter Arab accusations of betrayal against the British on the grounds that we had encouraged them and let them down* (f) French venality and incompetence* (g) Oubreak of revolt in Iraq, Syria and Palestine. 3 0 The parallelism is too close for comfort and constitutes my justification for drawing attention to the dangers inherent in the present position and the urgent need to insist upon the formulation of a treaty based on the 1936 model but scaled downwards and not upwards in order to obtain its Arab acceptance 0 The risks arising from an hostile Arab world accordingly are clearly far greater in that the war is not yet finished as it was in 1919 0 — I ■■ i— ■FILE COPY retained 'by the kiithorrsedJrecib ient and not passed on.] IIvUEDIATE . Your telegram No. 3863. J Just 'before receipt of your telegram, State Department gave us the following information. United States Consul General at Jerusalem had telegraphed to Y/ashington on June 30th reporting that General Lavaraclc with the approval of General Wilson had requested that a message he forwarded on his behalf to General Dentz, suggesting a meeting between their respective representatives. Consul General f s telegram also gave the text of a second message which Lavarack proposed to send to Dentz through his representative if this procedure should be accepted. You will, I take it, be in possession of texts of both these messages and I am not therefore repeating them. 2. As His Majesty's Government had authorised the United States Consul General at Beirut to act as intermediary in any negotiations which had approval of General Wilson. State Department had transmitted to him General Lavarack's request without thinking it necessary to consult us. Owing to the delays in transmission Consul General did not receive this telegram until July 7th. He thereupon telegraphed back to the State Department pointing out that as General Lavarack^s request was a week old, military situation had changed in the meantime, he wanted specific confirmation from His Majesty's Government that they wished Lavarack's message to be delivered to General Dentz. He commented that His Majesty's Government ought to give French no fresh excuse for asserting that they were taking the initiative in these overtures and that if they had wished the message to be delivered they should link it .up with the original enquiry from the French about terms and with the British reply thereto. 3. State Department asked us whether we wished them to instruct Consul General at Beirut to deliver Lavarack's message. I have now given them the information contained [CYPHER] Ky-y WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION. 4 From: UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, FROM WASHINGTON TO FOREIGN OFFICE, Viscount Halifax No. 3196 Hth July, 194.1.

This appears to have been largely die to fatigue after twelve days engag3mcnt and paucity of ri^it equipnont, lack of tanks, etc. poor morale found expression in reluctance to fl$it coinpatriots. The attitude of Legion was doubtful largely due to Colonel Monclare’s influercc He himself took no part in engagements owing to dislike of fighting French. However, Legion when engaged before Damascus fought well. II. After capture Damascus Free French morale rose and is now very high. The feelings towards Vichy are at Civil War pi tch. There are several examples of prec French being shot by Vichy under conditions which have been considered to justify shooting without trial Officers in charge of detachment s concemedo III.

Matter hanow been satisfactorily smoothed out for the time being.

To my mind he carries this to absurd lengths. But I do understand his position and have myself found that if handled v/ith tact he usually responds and becomes quite mellow and amenable. Unfortunately he lias undoubtedly latent suspicion that we ourselves are after Syria for our own purposes: and he completely misunderstands our motives in wishing to keep the Arab world well encouraged. In this he reads deep designs to detach Syria from Free France. 3. We have all done our best to disabuse his mind of this fantastic idea: but I doubt if he really believes us.

MOST IHLIEDIATE . French Ambassador left with me absurd note in following sense: ^For some days British air force has been systematically bombing Beirut, aiming particularly at the most populated quarters. During the night of June 30th/July 1st alone, this town received about thirty explosive and incendiary bombs which destroyed or damaged numerous houses. On instructions from their Government the French Embassy have communicated to the United States most serious protest against these attacks, still more to be condemned in view of the fact that the French air force has strictly \ refrained from attacking thickly populated tov/ns such as Damascus and Jerusalem although the presence in the former of about 10,000 British troops and in latter of an important military headquarters renders it impossible to describe the two cities as open towns. Similar protests have already been made to the American Consulate-General by the Government of the Lebanon and by the French Government to the United States Government. I said to him that speaking personally it seemed to me tragic that French and British lives should continue to be sacrificed in Syria. Why could not the French acknowledge the fact that continuation of the fighting was useless and prevent further loss of life? The Ambassador replied that it was just because some of the troops were so good that they would hesitate to surrender. I said that we had all been struck by the skill and courage of the French garrison but the fact that they had shown to the world their loyalty and courage now justified them in laying down their arms.

He suggested in particular that we should answer his note with . great care mailing it plain that we were anxious to stop the loss of life'and the destruction of property. He added that the Germans had four times offered Vichy military assistance in Syria but Vichy had refused. Germans had [? now] dropped the request as they realised that the entry of German troops against French wishes would drive the French garrison on to our side. The Ambassador, who at the end of the talk seemed to feel that ne had gone too far, made it very clear that his only instruction was to hand me the note and to make no comment. If there is anything in what he says, it appears to me that an appeal from the United States Govern ment to Vichy, coupled with a carefully phrased answer to the note and a very generous tribute to ' the courage and resolution of the French troops, might bring hostilities to an end.Chief of (yff^ 0 ^ th n enpe) Staff War Office* r Chief of the Air Staff -rr Air Ministry., ^ -A Chief of Naval Staff n ^ Admiralty^ /^ * * ^K, Assistant Chief of Air Staff Air Ministry , Director of Military Intelligence L ;* War Office Director of Naval Intelligence Admiralty Colonel Hollis (Offices of the War Cabinet) Major Morton (No.10) Mr. Peel (India Office) Mr* Boyd (colonial Office) AK u REOo.

He did not think Palmyra^could long hold out, but was hopeful of continued resistance m Northern Lebanon. Great problem was munition supplies. He had sent a personal message to Turkish President through Benoist Mechin asking for permission to send supply through Alexandretta. If this was agreed he hoped the supply ships could proceed through Turkish coastal waters. 2.

I notice that spokesman of Vichy, High Commissioner at Beirut, who no doubt appreciates the importance both for the present and the future point of view of Free France, asked Washington not only conditions of the British Government but also those of Free France; but that Your Excellency telegraphed Washington as if the British Government alone were qualified to answer, which I consider unjustified.

Begins: The British, through the intermediary of the American Consul-General at Beirut, have made proposals for the cessation of hostilities to General Dentz: In reply the French Government transmits to the Embassy of the United States in France the following text: 'The French Government is disposed to authorise General Dentz to enter into contact with General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson to examine conditions for the cessation of military operations. It considers that it is itself all the more justified in giving authority to this end to General Dentz since it has never ceased to consider that the opening of operations was founded by no real motive and that the British Government therefore bore the entire responsibility. It is obvious that the proposed negotiations imply the recognition by the British Government of the maintenance of all the rights and prerogatives that the mandate guarantees to France over the whole of the territory of Syria and the Lebanon. The principle of the agreement should be the fixing ofa line | of demarcation determined in the light of the present position of the armed forces, line to the south of which the British command would have the powers which are recognised by International Law to an occupying force.It is under these conditions that the French G-overnment is disposed to envisage the immediate cessation of hostilities on land, in the air and at sea (Eastern Mediterranean including the Aegean Sea). If the provisions to be agreed upon do not correspond to its desire to respect its obligations towards local populations and does not confirm to the sentiment of dignity which motivates under all circumstances its line of conduct, the French Government remains determined to continue to assure by all means in its power the safeguarding of the territories of the Levant' # Ends.tru l [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained hy the authorised recipient and not passed on]. IMMEDIATE * United States Consul General at Beirut has reported that High Commissioner has communicated to him te^rt of Vichy’s message. In doing so latter said that he had been instructed to make use of Consul General as an intermediary 'when proper time comes' and that he would not (repeat not) take any further action unless instructed by Vichy. In his telegram reporting this to State Department 5 Consul General asked them to transmit his personal view of position to His Majesty’s Government. He recommended that we should use French proposal cautiously in dealing with this French feeler. He suspected verv strongly xhat Germany was at the back of it and that her object was to gain time to enable French to complete their organisation of defence of Northern Syria. He alluded to the urgent reinforcements described in previous telegrams (and reported by us in Medal 7 section 4 and Medal 8 section 5) and expressed view thax if these were allowed to continue, they would 'prove hard to dislodge. He recommended that we should make a rapid advance on Homs [S] and thence on Tripoli [S] which would enable us to reduce risk considerably. It was clear that French Government were trying to imply that we had started conversations. Political adviser at State Department thinks it likely that when Dentz informed Vichy of British terms for cessation of hostilities, he did not reveal that these had been defined in response to an approach on his part.

'The British, through the intermediary of the American Consul-General at Beirut, have made proposals for cessation of hostilities to Dentz', and continues to state the French conditions, which are clearly inacceptable. 3.

Finally, we should propose to state that if General Dentz has not asked for an armistice on these terms within 96 hours from the time when communication on above lines is made to M* Benoist-Mechin, His Majesty's Government will consider their offer to have lapsed. 8. If you obtain concurrence of Commanders-in-Chief • and General^de Gaulle, please telegraph to that effect to His Majesty s Ambassador in Angora, to whom this telegram is being repeated. 9# Please urge on General de Gaulle necessity of not losing this opportunity. If General Dentz has not asked for armistice before expiry of time-limit given, we could consider making public ultimatum to him as suggested by General de Gaulle (your telegram No.2032). I consider, how ever, that public ultimatum would probably lead to German pressure on Vichy to continue resistance and that confidential negotiations may produce better results. 10. As for offer to repatriate troops, you should again emphasise that owing to shipping and other difficulties it seems inevitable that considerable time will elapse before they can leave.

My immediately preceding telegram. t aft As you know de Gaulle regards himself as bound by the terms proposed in my telegram No.1,916 and not by any others. These are, in the essentials the same . as those in your telegram No. * 2136, repeated to Washington except that the latter make no mention of de Gaulle, Catroux or the Free French. If the United States Consul General at Beirut is to make further approach to General Dentz, I suggest that he should now transmit tne terms contained in my telegram No. 1916 or at least the terms containing points 1,2,1,5,6,7 and 10 in paragraph 1, paragraph 2 being duly observed. Paragraphs! and 2 of your telegram No. 2136 and points 3,6,8 and 9 contain additions or amplifications to which I anticipate no objection from General de Gaulle if the matter is put to him. In any case it seems to me essential that the offer we publish have de Gaulle’s approval. 2, The fact that Dentz has not accepted the terms contained in your telegram No. 2136 which were dependent on the cessation of hostilities gives us in any case a valid ground for any modification. 3, Commander in Chief Middle East concurs[This telegram^is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on]. MOST IMMEDIATE. Your telegram No. 2229. Commander-in-Chief Middle East, (who returned to Cairo last night), General de Gaulle and I discussed this morning the question of whether further pressure cannot be brought to bear on General Dentz to accept an armistice without further delay. . 2. General •Vavell does not believe Dentz will accept yet as according to reports received he is hoping for early reinforce- j ments. At the same time we are all agreed that pressure on Dentz could do no har^i and might do good. - Further General de Gaulle does not consider that after the fall of Beirut, Dentz will 1 be able to offer further organised resistance in which case there.„ would no longer be any need to bind ourselves by special undertakings* He therefore favours a further offer at once if at all. we there fore recommend that United States Consul General at Beirut be asked to inform Dentz that the offer by British and Free French is renewed but is dependent upon^immediate cessation of hostilities. If resistance does not cease immediately they would not consider themselves indefinitely bound to maintain the offer to repatriate individuals who do not join the Free French. We recommend that this approach to Dentz be on your part accompanied by an announce ment of our offer which should be made known in Syria by wireless, by tracts and by all other means. 3. General de^Gaulle repeated his earnest desire that time and opportunity be given to the personnel of Vichy forces to choose freely whether they will join Free France. He is confident that considerable numbers will do so. He has already formed a Syrian baUalion temporarily at Damascus and some Vichy Army and Air onicers have come over._ _Fe are all agreed on i:his. General Vavell and I assured him that there is no question of objecting [sicj to the existing offer of 26th May that the whole units as such would be oifered immediate repatriation. ^ [Cypher] FROM CAIRO TO FOREIGN OFFICE.

I am communicating a copy of it to General Wavell and suggesting that we should all confer as early as possible. 3. Meantime General de Gaulle is much puzzled. He does not recollect (and nor do I) that we ever offered to repatriate troops from Syria. , He made it clear to me this morning that he has no intention of agreeing to unconditional repatriation, but only to sending back those who, after a reasonaole interval and full opportunity, make it clear that they do not wish to join Free France..EXT 3747 19 41 [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

(Begins): I have never understood or agreed that under any oircumstances the Vichy troops in Syria should he repatriated as troops. I have need of troops in Syria and when the operation is over I shall have no difficulty in making use of many of those who are there. 2. I have only understood and agreed that if Dentz rapidly ceased to resist,the military personnel who wished to be so should be repatriated individually but only after we have taken the delay and measures necessary to ensure that their choice is really free and taken after full reflection. 3. I consider that these conditions could have been put forward by us at any time. But it seems to me that the moment has now come to send at once an ultimatum to Dentz informing him publicly of our conditions. If this ultimatum were not accepted by him within 48 hours the above conditions would no longer be open and we need no longer be bound by any engagement. We should not await the fall of Beirut to send this ultimatum. If Beirut is taken Dentz will find himself incapable of supporting’ organised resistance and there will no longer be any reason for further repatriation.

He knew the people of the country and his experience there was proving of great value. The natives of Damascus had been most encouraging in their reception and he, de Gaulle, felt that there should be no great difficulty in getting native inhabitants of the whole country well behind Free France once we had ousted Vichy, which he believed would follow a capture of Beirut. 3. De Gaulle spoke at length on the question of liaison with Catroux and the importance (1) of our having the right man at the head of our mission (2) on everything being centralised through him (3) on interfering as little as possible with Catroux 1 s conduct of affairs (L) on chief of our Mission being a civilian (and on ..no account Havard ) and finally (5) on the Mission being a sub-Spears mission. _ General de Gaulle made it very clear that what he is especially anxious to avoid is that the proposed mission should be purely military. ■rJv s\TJ\aJL9 \ Chief of the Imperial General Staff War Office.

It lies at present in about 52 waggons in sidings between Afyon and Isahiye, The Germans have been informed that sufficient rolling stock is not available. Minister promised that as soon as German pressure was renewed and he was compelled to let some further spirit go forward, Air Attache would be given 24 hours warning. 4. As regards further shipload expected at Istanbul (Constantinople) rolling stock would not be available and in any case it could easily be delayed for about 3 months.

WITH reference to my telegra m No. 88 of t he 6th April, in which I reported the end of the disturbances in Beirut and the projected formation of a Lebanese Government on new lines, together with the elaboration of a statute somewhat similar to that recently granted to Syria, I have the honour to state that M. Alfred Naccache, after his appointment as head of the Government on the 9th April ( my telegram No, 94 of the 10th A pril), was able on the following da\ to foi m his Government, consisting of the four following Lnder-Secretaries of State:— (1) Ahmed Daouk (Sunni Moslem): Vice-President of the Council and Under-Secretary of State for the Departments of Public Works and Posts and Telegraphs. (2) Joseph Ray year (Greek Catholic): Under-Secretary for Finance and Food Supply and Control. (3) Philippe Boulos (Greek Orthodox) : Under-Secretary of State for National Education and Youth. (4) Fuad Ousseirane (Shia’ Moslem): Under-Secretary of State for National Economy and Public Health. M. Naccache himself retains the post of Under-Secretary of State for the Interior. 2. M. Naccache, who is himself a Maronite by religion, has followed the time-honoured custom of choosing his collaborators from each of the leading leligious denominations of the Lebanon, with the exception of the Druses, an omission which has caused some heart-burning amongst that sect. The Govern ment, moieover, is to be assisted by a Council of State—yet to be nominated— whose duty it will be to elaborate laws. There is also to be an Advisorv Council (Conseil consultatif) composed of the leading political, cultural and economic elements in the country. 3. I beg to enclose herewith copies( I ) of Decrees Nos. 80 LR and 81 LR of the 9th April, which deal with the new statute and with the appointment of the head of the State. It will be seen that article 6 of Decree No. 80/LR abrogates articles 3, 4 and 5 of Decree No. 246/LR of the 21st September 1939 which, as reported m my telegr am No. 47 of the 22nd S eptemhpr 1939 made certain provisional amendments to the Lebanese Constitution: tt- had the honour t0 re P ort in my telegram No 87 nf Hp April the High Commissioner invited President Edde and his Secretary of State to resign their offices and thus make way for the formation of the new Government. his radical change and the rumours that the Lebanon was no longer to be governed by cliques and clans was welcomed by all classes of the population who had become heartily sick of the type of politician who had usurped the’hio-h positions m the State during the last few years. o. Short biographies of the members of the new Government form another enclosure to this despatch.! 1 ) M. Alfred Naccache is a young man who eniovs universal popularity and has an unsullied reputation. As president of the Court of Appeal he has shown himself to be an honest and conscientious iudo-e and no criticism of his appointment has been heard. It is true that neither he nor am of his collaborators have had previous experience of Government administration and would appear, as a team, to lack drive, yet they all come to the task with t 1 ) Not Drmtect.

The majority of the inhabitants of the Lebanon are poor. The war and the blockade have hit the poorer c asses badly, and have deprived many of their means of livelihood. The supply and distribution o food will be the first problem to receive the new Ministry s attention. ^carut&gt; of supply, caused by lack of transport and unwillingness to sell, has caused a lame rise in prices, and Lebanese commercial instinct has led to hoarding a d cornering. M. Naccache and his collaborators have a difficult though not impossible task ahead of them. , , , . xt- 6.

Wit! 4-U u the Complinnent* of tho -c e^ary of Stati Minister for Foreign affairs morning that French Chargd d'affaires had three times been to him with instructions from Vichy with a suggestion that Turkey should send a mission to Syria to ascertain whether or not there were any Germans in Syria. This suggestion had been on one occasion unofficially supported by the German Embassy. 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs had refused on all three occasions and, as he told me, the matter had dropped. 3. I asked him what was the object of this French demarche. He replied that in his opinion, as our advance in Syria was slowing down and we might not be able to accomplish our purpose, it might be useful for Turkey to send such a mission as a means of conciliation between ourselves and the French. His idea seemed to be that if the Turkish Government declared that after investigation they found that there were no Germans in Syria, a favourable means could be found for arranging a reconciliation. A. I said I thought this idea fantastic and trusted that he would do nothing about it without previously consulting our selves, Minister for Foreign affairs replied that the matter had dropped and that he would take no further action unless requested to dc do so by His Majesty's Government. I said I thought such a request was entirely excluded. 5.

Dents has long had an agreement with Darlan to allow Germany by infiltration to establish themselves in Syria and to use it as a base against Britain. B. The Free French have intervened to prevent Syria being handed over piece by piece to Germany as Jndo~China is being handed over to the Japanese. Darlan is deceiving you when he says that there are no Germans in Syria. Some of them may have left but only because the Allies approach. C. Honour does not demand that French troops should obey Darlan’s orders to resist their comrades. The Darlan who now orders the French troops in Syria to fire on their fellow Frenchmen Is the same who ordered them not to fire on the invading German. D. Darlan s past career shows him to be a bungler and a not very honest one. It was he with his peculiar sense of honour who precipitated the Druse revolt. His record is full of such blunders. 2. The communique issued by H.M.G, on the 8th June provides good material for use by ourselves towards the French and native population alike but so far concerns the latter and with reference to paragraphs 3 and 9 of Cairo Unnumbered Empax telegram of the 14th June I would stress ( (2 corrupt groups) No. 386) t he advisability of avoiding any unnecessary parade of altruistic sentiments and sympathies for the political aspirations of the people of Syria and the Lebanon until we have considerably more assurance than we have now regarding Free French reservations,, * * Distributed as Moat Secret.r .Of* j .'-E X rm .

Sir H. Gough, Reuter's correspondent is also quoted as speaking of 'flank attacks' 1 . 2. It seems most important that such phraseologies as 'invasion, attack' etc. should be avoided as far as possible in speaking of operations in Syria and words such as 'penetration, advance' etc. used instead. 3. It is equally desirable to lay stress on collaboration of local officials and the rallying of military and civilian personnel to the Free French or the Allies, if this takes place. Any idea of military defeat of the French should be avoided. [CYPHER] WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM: EGYPT FROM CAIRO TO FOREIGN OFFICE Sir M.

He spoke vaguely of issuing an explanatory statement in Trans- Jordan and of getting in touch with the Syrian Government. British Resident rightly advised him to abstain from any action without the prior concurrence of H.M.G.

On instructions from his Government the French Ambassador has the honour to communicate to His Majesty’s Ambassador the following text of a note handed this morning by Admiral Darlan, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the United States Ambassador at Vichy ’’The French Government have just learned by a telegram received from the French High Commissioner at Beirut that Syrian territorv has been attacked this morning near Merdjayoum, soulh of Djebel-Druse and that enemy reconnaissance elements, armoured cars and infantry have come into contact with our posts. Fighting is in progress. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs again draw the attention of the United States Embassy to the fact that there has been no collaboration between the French and Germans in Syria and that all German air material and personnel which might have been there during events in Iraq have been withdrawn with the exception of two or three damaged machines and about 10 men. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs v/ish most particularly to draw the United States Embassy’s attention to the fact that any British attack, which nothing*'in the present situation in Syria can explain, risks producing the gravest consequences. As the Embassy are already aware, the French Government is determined to defend its territory and possessions wherever they may be attacked and with all' the means at its disposal. Every measure is being taken accordingly to this effect in Syria. Aware of the danger of the present situation« the French Government will for its part avoid ? £enhing f ur ther [? information], taking any action which might aggravate or spread the conflict. If trouble is in fact extended, the French Government will find itself obliged to assure by necessary measures, the defence of territories under French sovereignty.”[This telegram is of particular secrecy anh should he retained hy the authorised recipient and not passed on]. j [OxrHER] , WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION . 1941 FROM: SPAIN.
