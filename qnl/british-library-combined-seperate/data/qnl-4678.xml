An additional foliation sequence is also present in parallel between ff 2-238; these numbers are also written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file is concerned with the Bushire Residency [Persian Gulf Political Residency] Toshakhana — a store of gifts kept with the Bahrain Political Agency, so that they would be available for presentation to the Trucial Coast Shaikhs when needed. Regular stock accounts are submitted to Bushire to keep the Residency updated on the number and range of articles being held on its behalf. The file is primarily concerned with the acquisition of new articles for the Toshakhana, their circulation to British officers serving in the Persian Gulf, and the purchase of surplus stock by said officers; weapons and ammunition make up the bulk of these transactions, and wartime restrictions are reflected in the file. The file therefore contains supporting correspondence, invoices, payment receipts, as well as export licenses and 'No Objection Certificates' to facilitate the export of weaponry. The principal supplier is Suleman Omer and Company, and the principal shipping agent is Gray Mackenzie and Company Limited.The main correspondents within the file are as follows: the Political Agent, Bahrain (Edward Wakefield, Michael Dixon, and Tom Hickinbotham); the Political Resident, Persian Gulf (Charles Geoffrey Prior and William Hay); the Secretary to the Political Resident; the Political Officer, Trucial Coast (Maurice Patrick O'Connor Tandy, Richard Bird, and Raymond Murphy); the Political Agent, Kuwait (Cornelius James Pelly); and the Political Agent, Muscat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Ammunition</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms sales</topic></subject><subject><topic>Gifts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Guns</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00015f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00015f#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00015f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00015f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
