We are dubious about licensing export of second consignment of 50,000 (half of 60,000) tons of wheat to Iran, Bullard's Despatch 7 dated January 9th to Fox-eign Office indicates that the first consignment of 50,000 (half of 60,000) tens plus etspected releases by hoarders will suffice for all requirements. There is therefore danger of re-export to enemy countries irrespective of undertakings given by Iranian Government.

No. 34. b b b b b b Please pass to Ministry of Economic Warfare with reference to my telegram No.39 to them. Oriental Secretary, who returned to Tehran after an absence of four years and has been seeing many Iranian acquaintances, is astonished at the detestation in which the Shah and his sons are held by all kinds of people and at the unanimity with which His Majesty's Government are held responsible for having, it is alleged, helped him to seize power. However absurd this belief, the danger it involves for British interests in case of an upheaval in Iran is obvious. I think that our broadcasts in Persian should often stress that we are for the independence of smaller countries and that, unlike the Germans, we abstain from interference in the internal affairs of other countries, particularly their forms of Government. If the Government of India grants the application of Iran Government for second -purchase of wheat (see my telegram No.59 Arfar) we should also make much of that, though very.careful wording will be required. „ Repeated to Government of India telegram No.22, copy by mail to Bagdad M.
