In reply to your letter of the 7tli April, 1938, No. F. 3 (3)-Il.I.138, I am directed to inform you that the Secretary of State accepts the views of the Government of India that it is reasonable to allow officers recruited overseas to count service for leave and pension from the same date as they began to draw pay under their agreements. Copies of the amendments of the Fundamental Rules and Civil Service Regulations are enclosed. The amendments made by the Secretary of State to the Fundamental Rules and the Civil Service Regulations include those consequent on the alteration in the ruJes for the probation of officers of the Indian Civil Service. As regards the proposal that the new sub-clause of Fundamental Rule 9(6) (a) should have effect from the 1st January, 1922,1 am to observe that the Secretary of State has no power to give retrospective effect beyond the 1st April, 1937, to any amendment of civil rules, but he is advised that it is not neces sary to give retrospective effect to this amendment. All that is necessary is that the Accounts Officers concerned should recalculate the leave accounts of all officers at present in the Service who are affected by the new su -c ause, e additional days leave (if any) being credited now and taken some tune m the future.

OFFICE MBD/DMfflmL Subjects- Restriction on substantive appointments against temporary posts. Under Fundamental Rule 26, if a Government servant's tenure of a temporary post is interrupted by leave, the leave counts for increments in the time-scale applicable to the temporary post if the Government servant returns to the temporary post, 0 but if a G-overnment servant officiating in a permanent post takes leave and returns to his officiating tenure: of that post on the expiry of his leave, the leave does not count for increments In the time-scale applicable to the permanent post as during such leave he is treated as .—reverted to--his substantive post, if any. This difference in the treatment accorded to leave granted under similar .circumstances arises from-the fact that appointments to ■temporary posts even of short duration are usually me.de in a substantive cape^city. The G -overnment of India do not regard either tne practice ,of making almost all appointments to temporary posts ;In-.a. substantive capacity or the difference of' treatment it gives rise to &lt;s justified. After careful consideration of the matter ill consultation with the Auditor- Greneral of India, they have come to the conclusion that while the Fundamental Rules, as they stand at present admit of both a substantive and officiating tenure of a temporary post, substantive appointments to temporary posts should be made in a limited number % of Cc .ses only ^s, e.g., when posts are to all intents and purposes quasi permanent or when they have been sanctioned for a period of not less than, or there is reason to believe that they will not terminate within a period of/-2- of s three years. In all other cases, appointments to temporary posts should fee made in an officiating capacity only. Such a practice is already in vogue in the Audit Department andcan, Fith advantage, be followed elsewhere also. The\^ is accordingly directed to request that these instructions may be carefully followed whenever appointments to temporary posts are made.

Subject .—-AmendTnents of Articles 475-A and 475-B, Civil Service Regulations (Conditions of service attached to the post of Deputy Director, Intelligence, Govern ment of India, Peshawar.) I am directed to refer to the correspondence resting with the Government of India, Home Department letter No. 44-F-40/XLVI/34-Police, dated the 18th of June 1936, on the above subject, and to forward for the consideration and approval of the Secretary of State a redraft of Articles 475-A and 475-B, Civil Service Regulations, as prepared by the Government of India in consultation with the Auditor-General'. The redraft reproduces the rules contained in the draft resolution of 1927 received from the India Office with Mr. Brown's demi-official letter No. F.-1385/36, dated the 3rd April 1936, with such modifications as have been found necessary. All important variations in them are explained below:— Article 475-A, Civil Service Regulations. (1) To bring the phraseology of Article 475-A, into line with that adopted in Article 475-B, in accordance with present usage, the word ' post' has been substituted for the word ' appointment' wherever it occurs in the former article. (2) Clause {3). —This clause has been added with a view to embody in the main rule the decision of the Auditor-General regarding counting of temporary service for additional pension, as suggested in paragraph 2 of the India Office letter No. F.-1385/36, dated the 1st of April 1936. In order to prevent troublesome requests for additional pension in respect of service in a temporary post after it has actually been held for some time it has been provided that the authority competent to create the post should declare whether it carries the same duties and responsibilities as a post listed in the Schedule to Article 475-A. (3) Clause (4). (а) In this clause an attempt has been made to redraft clause (3) of the rules contained in the draft resolution of 1927 with a view to define more precisely the expression ' effective service ' used in Article 475-A. (б) Sub-clause (i) and Clause (4). —A temporary post of the nature mentioned in clause (3) has to be treated on the same lines as a permanent quali fying post under clause (6) of Article 644, Civil Service Regulations. Accordingly the term ' effective service ' with reference to such tempo rary post would include besides periods of duty in the post, duty performed in a post of corresponding rank and responsibility in foreign service or on deputation on special duty or in another temporary post, or in a permanent post in an officiating capacity subject to certain conditions. This sub-clause also includes a provision to this effect. (c) Sub-clause (ii) of clause (4). —With reference to the words ' periods of such service, passed on privilege leave ' occuring in clause (6) of Article 644, Civil Service Regulations, it has been held that for a period of priviege leave or leave under the Fundamental Rules corresponding to privilege leave for the purpose of calculating service for pension to count for additional pension it should be in evidence that had the officer not been on leave, he would have continued to officiate in, or hold, the post concerned. In order to make this position clear a proviso has been added at the end of the this sub-clause in which the case of the holder of the temporary post mentioned in clause (3) has also been included. (4) Clause [6).—Note. —The proviso under this note has been newly added for the reasons specified in the comments on Sub-clause (ii) of clause (4) above.2 (5) Clause (7)—This clause embodies tlie interpretation approved by the Secretary of State in Mr. Saunder's letter No. 5085/24, dated the 23rd of October 1924. (6) Article 644, Civil Service Regulations, as amended by correction slip No. 98, dated the 5th of April 1935, provides that the substantive holder of a qualifying post counts all active service (including privilege leave) while officiating in another permanent post. Necessary provision to this effect has been made in clause 4 (i) {d) of Articles 475-A and 475-B, as redrafted. Article 475-B. Clause (5) Note. —The proviso to this note has been newly added for the same reasons as referred to in the comments on clause 4 (ii) of Article 475-A. 2. After the above amendments have been sanctioned, the Government of India, propose to adopt them mutatis mutandis for members of services under the rule-making control of the Governor General in Council and to invite provincial Governments to adopt similar amendments in respect of services under their rule making control. Draft Amendments to the Civil Service Regulations. 1. For Article 475-A, and the Note appended thereto the following shall be substituted, namely :— ' 475-A. —For officers mentioned in Article 349-A, the rule for the grant of special addit'onal pensions is as follows :— (1) Officers who have held posts listed in the lower grade in the Schedule below may be allowed by the Local Government an additional pension at the rate of Rs. 300 a year for each completed year of effective service in any post included in that grade, provided that no officer may draw an additional pension in excess of Rs. 1,500 in respect of service classed in the lower grade. (2) Officers who have held posts listed in the upper grade in the Schedule below may be allowed by the Local Government an additional pension of Rs. 500 a year for each completed year of effective service in any post included in that grade, provided that no officer may draw an additional pension in excess of Rs. 2,500 in respect of service rendered in the lower and upper grades combined or in the upper grade alone. In the case of an officer who has earned an additional pension both in the upper and in the lower grade, service for any broken period of a year in the upper grade may count as service in the lower grade if the pension of the officer is increased thereby. (3) An officer who has held a temporary post which has been declared by the authority competent to create the post as carrying similar duties and responsibilities and which carries the same rate of pay as a post listed in the Schedule below may be allowed by the Local Government an additional pension in respect of that post at the rate and subject to the conditions prescribed in clause (1) or (2) of this Article as the case may be (4) For the purposes of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this Article the expression ' effective service ' includes, besides periods of duty in a post referred to in these clauses, (i) duty performed— (а) in a post of corresponding rank and responsibility on foreign service, or (б) on deputation on special duty, or (c) in a temporary post, or {d) in a permanent post in an officiating capacity, to which an office is transferred or appointed while holding the post mentioned in clause (1), (2) or (3); if, in the case of an officer who hold the post mentioned in clause (1) or (2) in an officiating capacity or of an officer who held the post mentioned in clause (3), the Local Government certifies that he would, if he had not been so transferred or appointed, have continued to officiate in or hold the post concerned.3 (u) privilege leave or leave under the Fundamental Rules corresponding to privilege leave for the purpose of calculating service for pension taken by the officer during his service in a post mentioned in clause (1), (2) or (3) or during the period of duty covered by sub-clause (i) of this clause, if, in the case of an officer who has held a post mentioned in clause (1) or (2) in an officiating capacity, or who had held a post mentioned in clause (3) the Local Government certifies that he would, if he had not pro ceeded on leave, have continued to officiate in the post mentioned in clause (1) or (2) or have held the post mentioned in clause (3). (5) An officer of pensionable status who has held a post in foreign service with a State owned Railway worked by a company, which is certified by the Government of India to correspond in rank and responsibility with a State Railway post listed in the Schedule below, may be allowed by the Government of India a special additional pension in respect of that post at the rates and subject to the conditions prescribed in clause (1) or (2) of this Article, as the case may be ; provided that for the purpose of this clause £ effective service ' means duty (including privilege leave or leave under the Fundamental Rules corresponding to privilege leave for the purpose of calculating service for pension) in the foreign service post. (6) An officer who has received, under the second proviso to Fundamental Rule 30 (1) or under Fundamental Rule 113, officiating promotion to one of the posts listed in the Schedule below, or in whose case the local Government certifies that he would have received such promotion had he not been on special duty or holding a temporary post may be allowed by the Local Government an additional pension at the rates and subject to the conditions prescribed in clause (1) or (2) of this Article, as the case may be, as though he had held during the period for which he officiated or would have officiated, a post listed in the Schedule. Note .—For the purpose of this clause the period of officiating promotion includes any privilege leave or leave under the Fundamental Rules corresponding to privilege leave for the purpose of calculating service for pension taken during the period, but no other leave, if the local Government certifies that had the officer not been on leave, he would have continued in the same capacity.

These orders have in effect, tended to invite claims for the grant of personal pay to quite ordinary and undistinguished officers merely because they had completed five years on the maximum pay of the ir appointment. It has, there fore been decided that the decision contained in this Department letter No.D,4i71-Ex»13/33, dated the 26th October 1933, should be cancelled. 3.It is pointed out that the mere fact that a man has been on the imximum of his grade for a number of years is not a sufficient reason for granting him persoml pay, and that in future no case will be entertained which is not of an entirely exceptioned character. I am to request that in submitting cases for the grant of persoml pay to the Pimnce Department in future in accordance with this Department letter No.P. 14-XXII-Ex.il, dated.the 28th September 1936, these instructions may be carefully borne in mind.Copy of a letter No.P./14-.XXII-Sx^II ? dated Simla, the SStii September 1936, from the Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Finance Department, to All Minor Local Governments.

I am directed to invite a reference to paragraph 2-ll of the'Finance Department Resolution N0.358-E.A, dated the 3ist of August 19i2,' in which it was prescribed that no application for the grant of a compensatory personal allowance should be entertained unless J ' ' ', (a) the officer's service has been consistently ; spatisfactoiy ind his been of a cbaracter superior to what is ordinarily expected of , • the incumbent of the appointment; -(b) the officer is fit for promotion but there is no possibility of giving him any advancement in the near future; and (c) the officer has been at least five years on the same pay, or if his pay is progressive, on the naximum pay of his ^appointment. It was further stated that the more fulfilment of the above conditions;.should not bo regarded as securing a . &lt; perqoml allowance: to ; an officer as a : matter of course, the purpose cf the coniitipns being tA enable obviously weak claims,, to be summarily rejected. 2. The Governnient qf;,.India tavo reason to believe that these oiders .have .not always been strictly observed in considering claiias to the grant of personal pay under clr.use (b) of Fundamental Rule 9(23), especially in the case cf inferior Government servants. The cnximum cf a grade is definitely fixed as being the maximum pay which it is justifiable to give to a man performing the duties of the post. The fact /- 2 ~ fact ttot owing porlaaps to luck in promotion, roachQs thd imximuiii of Ms gradQ some years bofora ho is-, due to retire is not in itself a sufficient reason for inc3 ?easiiag ;ttet..i.mxin]Um by tJae grout of pars anal pay. On the other hand there is every reason why no personal pay should be given, because a mm who reaches the maximum of his grade earlier than was intended when the grade was fixed should consider himself fortunate in being able to draw the maximum for so long a period in his service. It is understood that in some cases the personal pay hus even been increased after a recipient has drawn it for a few years, and this is equivalent to creating an entirely false and unintended scale in additibn to the maximum which was considered adequate f or the work which the recipient is called upon to perform. 3. It is very desirable that the principles laid down in 1912 should be strictly observed in future and that there should be a greater measure of uniformity in the practice of the various authorities who are competent to sanction the grant of personal pay. I am accordingly to reiterate the principles laid down in 1912, and repeated in pc-ragraph 1 above, as those which shoulu in future govern the grant of personal pay under Fundamental Rule 9(23)(b) to a Government servant.Telegraphic Address—ACCOUNTS.

As the rules are not clear on the subject I should be grateful for a ruling. 3. I should also be glad to be informed of the method of calculation of average pay of a Government servant who has not completed 36 months service prior to proceeding on leave.(*■ V Copy of letter Ho»TA 8-7-1104, dated the 1st November, 1938, from the Accountant-General, Central Revenues, Kotb Delhi to the Secretary to the Hon»ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your letter Noo1726-64/203, dated the 29th September, 1938, regarding the method of calculation of leave salary of a clerk of your office who proceeded on earned leave vdth effect from 16th March, 1938, I have the honour to state that in accordance with item 2 of the Government of India decision 'below Rule 16 of Appendix 7A of the Posts and Telegraphs Compilation of the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules, Volume II as inserted hy correction slip Ho»115, dated the 27th February, 1937, his average substantive pay referred to in rule 16(l)(a) of the Revised Leave Rules is to be calculated on the basis of the permanent service rendered during the 12 complete monthsjimmediately preceding the month in which the leave is taken. If the period of the permanent service be less than 12 months, the actual period of such service should be taken into account. Accordingly the clerk's average pay should be calculated for the period from 21st July, 1937 to 28th February, 1938 excluding any period of leave taken during this period. As regards paragraph 3 of your letter under reply, it may be stated that the method of calculation of average pay of a Government servant who has not comple ted 36 months' service prior to proceeding on leave is the same as stated in paragraph 1 above. The only difference is that the actual period of service if it falls short of 36 months may be taken into account for calculation of average pay. But this calculation is necessary only ^hen the leave salary is greater than his average substantive Pay.A copy of the undermentioned papers is forwarded to: The Political Agent, Muscat The Political Agent, Bahrain^ The Political Agent, Kuwait His Majesty's Consul, Herman His Majesty's Consul, Bandar A'bba» •His Majesty 's Vice-Consul, Khorrarashahr for information and guidance.

Mainprice 'a new recruit to the Indian Civil Service 1 after his arrival in Quetta by the overland route® ■ Fundamental Rule 17 read with Audit Instruction (2).and the Government of India's decision thereunder, governs the joining time admissible and the date from which pay should be drawn by Indian Civil Service recruits who travel to India, by sea. But in case of journeys by the overland route these orders cannot be applied automatically, since there is no 'date of disembarkation ,, . The Government of India are, therefore, unable to give an authentic ruling on the point raised by the Provincial Government, The solution would be to allow Mr. Mainprice to draw pay from the date from which he would have drawn it, if, having travelled by sea and availed himself fully of -'the joining time, which would then have been admissible , he had reported for duty on the date on.which he, actually does-,after- travelling overland. Alternatively, Quetta might be treated, as the 'port of disembarkation' in cases of journeys by the overland,route, in which event Mr. Mainprice would get ,the joining time admissible under Fundamental Rule 17 a.s stated above. ■ 2. I am to request that a ruling on the .point may be obtained from the Secretary of State and intimated direct to Mr. Mainprice= I am also to request that the Government of India may be informed of the decision in due course, to enable them, to dispose'of uhe cases of certain other Indian Civil Service officers who travelled to India by the over Land route by car last year.

Under the existing orders officers of the Indian Civil Service commence to draw pay in India from the date of disembarkation in India subject to their proceeding to the place of duty without avoidable delay and the intervening period is treated as duty. The duty period for transit is5 however 9 to be reckoned from the date of landing at a port of disembarkation in India* The orders therefore contemplate journeys to India either by vessel or by air-craft and the cases of journeys to India by road in motor car are not covered by these orders, I am therefore to enquire how the case of Mr» Mainprice should be treated.

Subject: Counting of military service for civil pension. /k/yv /T I am directed to refer tp the correspondence ending with this Department letter Nd.P.11(24)-R.II/35, dated the 3rd October 1935^ on the subject indicated above, and to say that it has come to the notice of the Government of India that some misapprehension still exists on the question how military service rendered during the Great 'Var should be dealt with for the purpose of calculating civil pension. I am to explain below the position as it subsists under the orders issued so far:- Military service rendered during the Great War, i.e.. War service, may be classified into two categories:- (1) Where the War service has been rendered in addition to other military service pensionable under the military rules and rendered before or after such War service; and (2) where the War service stands alone, i.e., where no military service has been rendered except service during the War period, viz., the 4th August 1914 to the 31st August 1921. In regard to War service falling in category (1) above. Finance Department letter No,F.11(24)-R.11/55, dated the 3rd October 1935, applies and the Government servant concerned is permitted to count his War service (i.e. the portion From To Sir,portion of service rendered between the 4th August 1914 and the 31st Ailgust 1931) for Civil pension either under Article 356. C.S.R. or under Article' /Zbl A, G.S.R. whichever may be more advantageous to him^ subject, of course 3 to the limitations prescribed in the respective Articles&lt;&gt; • - In regard to War.service falling in category (2) above, the position is different. In such cases the Govern ment servant has no option and such War service must be counted under Article 357 A onlysubject to the limitations prescribed in that Article, 3. In other words ? the position is that ordinarily War service should be counted if admissible.under Article 357 A, CLS.H. only; but in cases where the War service has been rendered in addition to other military service pension able under the Military Rules,■ .either before or after the War, and in such cases only, the Government servant concerned is given the option to count, if it.is more advantageous to him, his War service under Article .356, G-S.R, if otherwise admissible. 3, It is likely that due.to misapprehension about the orders contained in letter No 0 F.ll(24)-R 9 II/35, dated the 3rd October 1935, an option to count war service under Article 356, G,S.Re.has been allowed in theipast in cases where no such option was permissible. The Governor General- in-Gouncil has decided that no advantage will be gained by re-opening such,cases and they should, not be re-opened.

The question' has been raised as to what the intention of this rule is in regard to the counting of increments which fall due during leave.preparatory to retirement. 2. The Government of India consider that it is equitable that in this matter a Government servant in inferior service should be treated on the same footing as a Government servant in Superior service. They have, accordingly decided that in the case of an inferior Government servant governed by the Central Subordinate (Inferior) Services (Gratuity, Pension and Retirement) Rules who takes leave preparatory to retirement, the principle underlying sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 27 in Section III of the M anual of t».^fitruetfcrns» (corrected upto 31st March 1937) should be followed in determining for the purposes of rule 7 of those Rules, the monthly substantive pay which he would have drawn. 3.

Subject: Method of calculation of leave in the case of officers placed on deputation while on leave out of India. • Sir,. I am directed to invite a reference to the letter from this Department No,F.23-III-C.S.R./27, dated the 20th May 1927, which communicated the decision of the Secretary of State that, subject to the consideration of special cases, where an •officer is placed .on, deputation, in Europe or America while on leave out o,f India, the deputation shall be regarded as an interruption o : f the leave already granted. The effect of this ruling, as-st^te^ is that in ordinary circumstances the leave of such an officer is extended by the period of the deputation, but the deputation does' not entitle him to a fresh grant of leave. It was further explained in.letter No.F.7(12)- R. 1/34, dated'the March ■i93^ that in such cases there is no fresh grant of leave on the completion of deputation and th^ leave enjoyed is the' leave already ' however • ' ' '/ granted. Cases have/be eh' brought to the notice of the Gcvernment of India in which the literal application of the ruling referred to above, has resulted in the increase of the leave already granted. To avoid this-2- the Governor General in Gouxicil nas. decided that m such cases the balance oT the lir.enjoyed leave should be worked Out before the dep'utatioh intervenes and the amount of leave to be enjoyed subsequently on the expiry of the deputation should be r'eBtri 'cted 1 'to this'available balance. 2. ; These' orders take effect from the date of this letter and the pas^. cases need not be reopened, that is to say, no readjustment of leave'salary heed be made in such cases, though the leave accounts should be debited with the amount of leave actually taken, any period of leave on average pay taken in excess of the limit of 8 months being treated as leave on half average pay. . • I have the.honour to be, '' ' ; • Sir, Your most obedient servant, —-— ^ Under Secretary to-the Gov.er.nment of India. . . , No.F.7(5)R.l/39o • Copy forwarded to all Chief Commissioners; the several Departments of the Government of India;(including the Financial Adviser, Military Finance, the Finance Officer, Communications, the oe'crfetary to the executive Council of the Governor General, .and secretary.to tne Governor General(Public)); the Political Department, the Crown Finance Officer; -the Financial Commissioner, Railways; the Military and Private-Secretaries to His ■Excellency thQ Viceroy; the Central Board of Revenue, the Auditor General; the Mint Masters;' the Master&gt; Security Printing, India;- a,!!

By order, etc., S. A. HASNIE, Under Secy, to the Govt, of India. Copy of letter No. F. 11(13)-R. 11/38, dated the 15 th September 1938, from the Govern ment of India, Finance Department, to His Majesty's Under Secretary of State for India, London. Counting of service for pension of personnel transferred to a Service or post to which the Civil Service Regulations apply from a Service or post to which they do not apply. I am directed to refer to para. 2 of Mr. Grist's letter No. F. 1523/38, dated 14th April 1938, conveying the orders of the Secretary of State that officers transferred to a Service or post to which the Civil Service Regulations apply from one to which they do not apply should be per mitted to exercise the option of coming under the Civil Service Regulations for pension inde pendently of that in regard to leave. This deci sion involves an amendment of the Civil Service Regulations as under Article 4 of those Regula tions an officer's claim to pension is regulated by the rules in force at the time when he retires from the service of Government. The Govern ment of India consider that a new rule should be inserted after Article 4, Civil Service Regula tions to the effect that an officer transferred to a Service or post to which the Civil Service Regu lations apply from one to which they do not apply and who has not exercised the option of coming under the pension rules in the Civil Service Regulations shall remain under the pen sion rules to which he would have been subject had he not been transferred. It is proposed to fix a time limit within which the option of coming under the pension rules in the Civil Service Regulations must be exercised, as questions affecting pension, or service qualifying for addi tional pension and the like may arise and it would be undesirable to defer consideration of such points for an indefinite period until the officer choses to 'opt'. The Government of India consider that a period of six months from the date of transfer or, if the officer be on leave on that date, within six months of his return from leave would suffice. This will not however cover the case of officers who may have already been transferred before the promulgation of the new rule. It is not considered necessary to make a provision for this class of persons in the rule itself. It would suffice if executive orders are issued that any officer transferred in the circumstances contemplated by the rule before its promulgation may exercise the option of remaining under the pension rules to which he would have been subject had he not been trans ferred within six months from the date of the executive orders or, if the officer be on leave on that date, within six months of his return from leave.2. I am to request- that if the Secretary of 8tate agrees he may be moved to accord sanction to the enclosed draft amendment to the Oivil Service Begnlations. The Governor-General in Council proposes to make a similar amendment in respect of personnel under his rule-making control and to invite Provincial Governments also to do the same. Thaft amendment to the Civil Service Regula tions. After Article 4 of the said Regulations the following Article shall be inserted, namely: — 'Article 4-A. An officer transferred to a Service or post to which the pension rules in these Regulations apply from a Service or post to which they do not apply remains under the pension rules to which he would have been sub ject, had he not been transferred, provided that it shall be open to him, within six months of the date of transfer or, if he is on leave on that date, within six months of his return from leave, to elect to be governed by the pension rules in these Regulations from the date of his first appoint ment. The intention of exercising this option must be specifically declared to the Local Government or the Governor-General in Council as the case may be. The option once exercised shall be final'. C opy of letter N o. F. 4526/38, dated 18 th N ovember 1938, from I ndia O ffice F inancial D epartment, L ondon, to the G overnment of I ndia, F inance D epartment. I am directed by the Secretary of State to refer to your letter of the 15th September, 1938, No. F. 11(13 )-R. 11/38 and to say that he approves the proposal of the Government of India that Article 4 of the Civil Service Regu lations should be amended in order to provide that an officer transferred to a Service or posr to which those Regulations apply from a Service or post to which they do not apply, should have the option of being governed by the pension rules in those Regulations or by the pension rules governing the Service or post from which he was transferred, and that a time limit should be fixed within which the option must be exer cised. With regard to the form of the amendment, that proposed by the Government of India would have the effect of excluding the officer from the pension rules ordinarily applicable to his new Service or post, unless he elects to be governed by them. The Secretary of State is of opinion, however, that the officer should become subject to those rules unless he elects to remain under the pension^rules of his parent Service, and he has accordingly made the amendment to the Civil Service Regulations, a copy of which is enclosed. F 4526/38. Amendment. I, Lawrence John Lumley, Marquess of Zetland, one of His Majesty's Principal Secre taries of State, in exercise of the powers con ferred upon me by Section 247 of the Govern ment of India Act, 1935, hereby make, with the concurrence of my Advisers, the following amendment in the Civil Service Regulations, namely:— After Article 4 of the said Regulations the following Article shall be inserted, namely: — Article 4-A. An officer transferred to a Ser vice or post to which the pension rules in these Regulations apply, from a Service or post to which they do not apply, becomes subject to the pension rules in these Regulations, provided that it shall be open to him, within six months of the date of transfer or, if he is on leave on that date, within six months of his return from leave, to elect to be governed by the pension rules to which he was subject immediately before the date of transfer. The intention of exercising this option must be specifically declared to the local Government or the Governor-General in Council as the case may be. The option once exercised shall be final.

Sir 5 I am directed.to state that the Government of India have hitherto taken ,the view that Article 470(b), Civil Service Regulations permits a penal recovery from a pension to make good loss caused to Government by... negligence or fraud on the part of the person concerned.whi,le he was in service - vide the orders contained! in.the Auditor-General's letter No.117-A/103-34 r dated 1st July 1935. .They have now reconsidered the question and-have arrived at the following conclusions s- ^ ' (a) Article 470, cannot be used directly to effect a penal recovery, but Governmeht' are justified in making proof of a specific instance of fraud or negligence .by an officer the groiond for a finding that his service has not been thoroughly satisfactory within the meaning of the Article for the purpose of reducing his pension• (b) The measure of'the reduction in the amount of pension made under the Article should be the extent by which the officer 1 ^ service as a whole has failed to reach a thoroughly satisfactory standard, and any attempt to equate the amount of reduction with the amount of loss caused to Government is incorrect. (c) The Article contemplates permanent reduction in the amount of pension ordinarily admissible and does not admit of the reduction of the pension payable in respect of any one particular year. 2. Necessary amendments to the letter quoted in paragraph 1 above will be issued by the Auditor-General in due course.3. In this connection I am to state that the rule issued with this department notification No.F.6(8)-R.11/39, dated 23rd February 1939, a copy of which has been communicated to you separately, permits direct penal recovery from the pensions-of new entrants to services under the rule-making control of the Governor General in Councilo Copy forwarded for information and guidance to all.

Generally, temporary appointments are snnctioned for specified periods and it has been the practice to offer the posts t'o candidates for these periods Without inserting a'Saving : clause in the letter of appointment providing for the termination of employment before the ^expiration of the periods for,which the posts are sanctioned. The effect of this is that, if for any reason, it is not found possible or desirable to retain the candidate for the full period, he cannot be discharged unless and until ah enquiry has been held under Rule 55 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control' and Appeal) Rules and the candi date's unfitness for 'further' service-has been duly established, vide ' rule. 49 .of the above ; Rules . aimd the government of India, Home , Department letter No ,F. 9-1-3O-ESts'., dated the 22nd- November 1930 ; printed ^Sj item,; (1) of the -Gdvernjieht . pfj t^dia^ decision below rule 49 -ofthe,.Civil Services .(Classification, Control and Appeal) Ruies in .the Posts &amp; Telegraphs. Compilation of the 'Fundamental and the Supplementary Rules. To,avoid embarrassing situations 'which,result-owing;to the absence' of safeguard in the offer of appointment in such cases, the Government of India have decided that the wording of the offer should in future read as followsi- ,t Mr . ....is offered a temporary post-ef. on a pay of Es.......... Per mensem in this office. His employment is likely to last for a period of about.. ...but may be terminated, without any reason being specified, at any time within the first _six months of that period. He will have to join the post at his own expense. If he accepts the post on these conditions he should report himself for duty as soon as possible» The offer will be cancelled if no reply is received by .o 0 .*.oOr if he fails to report for duty by The last eight words in the second sentence of the above form should be struck out if the period does not itself exdeed six months. The / reason for the mention of the six-month period is that, on adminis trative grounds, it is desirable that, if a temporary employee is to be discharged summarily, it should be within the first six months of his service and people who have served for more than tha period should be given the protection afforded by the Classification Rules from arbitrary discharge. 2. I am to request that the above model form may be adopted in Copy forwarded to all Departments of the Government of India .(including the financial Commissioner, Railways^ the Financial Adviser, Military Finance5 the Central Board of Revenue and the Finance, .Officer ?

New Delhi, ^.o^tgii^ecretary to the Government of India, Finance Department Subject:- Interpretation of the words 'initial period' in Fundamental Rule 91(a) I have the.honour to state that Colonel Sir Alexander Russell, C.B.E. 5 D.P..H. ? D.T.M. 9 K,,H-S. ? I .M.S. ? Public Health Commissioner with the Government of India.will be out of India on leave and on deputation as detailed below:- (i) On leave on average pay from 24th Marqh 1939 to 21st April 1939. (ii) on deputation from 22nd April 1939 to'17th May 1939. (ill) on leave on average pay from 18th May 1939 to 9th August 1939 9 and (iv) on leave on half average pay for 20 days from 10th to 29th August 1939. The officer wishes to draw his-leave salary in India for both the-periods of his leave on average pay i.e. ? from 24th March 1939 to 21st April 1939 and again from 18th May , 1939 to 9th August 1939 though- this leave will be spent ex- Asia. ' 2. Proviso (a) under clause 2 of Fundamental Rule 91 9 as amended by Government of India, Finance Department Notification No.F.7(41)-R.1/35, dated-the 5th September 1935, permits the drawal of leave salary in India or in England at the option of the officer, without' reference to the country of actual residence for the initial period of the leave on average pay not exceeding 4 months. So the request of Sir Alexander will be admissible only if deputation,- for which pay has to be drawn necessarily in England, is considered as not having the effect of interrupting the initial period of leave on average pay for which it is permissible to draw leave salary in India. There are orders to the effect that the two periods of leave immediately preceding and immediately following a period of deputation forms one spell of leave2 vide, sub-paragraph, 3 of Government of India Order No.^ and Order, No.4 under Fundamental Rule 81 on pages 222 and. 223 of the Accountant General 9 Posts.and Telegraphs' Compilation of the Fundamental Rules but it does not seem to follow therefrom that both the periods should be treated as the 'initial period' of the leave. T tien there is an interruption in the drawal of leave salary the second period should ? it seems j cease to' be the* 'initial period'. 3, It would appear that the concession of allowing an officer to draw his leave salary for the initial period of leave in India has been'granted on,the consideration that an officer should not be compelled to revise his banking arrangements for short periods.of leave or immediately he proceeds' out of Indiao If this is the object of the rule, then an officer who has necessarily to make arrangements in England to draw his deputation pay should not be in need of the concession of being allowed to draw the leave salary in ■ India for the period immediately following the deputation. In my view Colonel Sir Alexander Russell can be .allowed to draw his leave salary in India only up to the date from vihich his deputation commences. 4. I shall be glad to know whether the Government of India agree., If ? however 3 it is decided that the officer wiu. be entitled to draw his leave salary in India even, for the period immediately following the deputation, I may kindly be informed whether the period of deputation intervening, during the leave on average pay should also be taken into account in calculating the maximum period of 4 months prescribed in Fundamental Rule 91,&amp; Ret.

In continuation of this Department ondorsenent Ho.F.6(82)-R.Il/35 dated the 15th July 1937, forwarding a copy of Secretary of State's Resolution No .F.m/37 dated 8th June 1937 amending Article 526(h) of tho Civil Service Regulations, I am directed to say that the precise effect of the amendment to Article 526(r,) introduced by correction slip No.77 dated 7th September 1933 docs not appear to have been appreciated by the authorities competent to fill civil posts under their control. With e viev, to removing any misapprehensions that may exist, I aja to say that the purpose of this amendment which came into effect from tho 30th MT-y 1933- ms. to give, tho authority competent to fix the pay and allowm cos_2fJL- civil post in which it mas proposed to re-employ a military pensioner, tho ..pqwor t? tate the military pension of such an officer (i.e. one appointed to a civil post after tho 30th May 1933) into account, including any portion that might have boon commuted, in fixing the pay and allowances of such an officer in tho civil post,, 2. Article 526(b) as now amended with effect from the 30th 1933 has also end in view and, while allowing the military . „ ponton t; b» dra^^'tte'^te from which it is gmnted by tho military cnployer, gives the authority competent to fix the pay and allowances of the post in civil employ, the discretion (which must be duly exorcised i;. each case) to take into account the military pension a«d to reduce the pay and allowances of such on officer from the date the military pension is granted, if it thinks fit. 3. Tho effect of both these amendments, therefore, is to require the authorit: competent to fill the particular post to approach with hie recommendations the authority competent to fix the pay and allowances of the post for tho fixation or relation of pay in each case in which a military pensioner has boon entortained in a civil post or in which a military officer has been granted a military pension while employed in a civil post after the 30th May 1933. P.T.O.' ar** ~2~ , . . 4. It is now A o'cqs3 ary for the authorities onpoworcd to fix tho pay ,n »d dlomnoos of all civil posts concerned to royieis all cases of appointaents made under Article 526(a) or (b) (new) after the 30th Ugy 1933 and to retain or refix pay accordingly. Any pay which, as a result ef any failure to take the action decided in paragraph 3 above, nay have teen overdrawn botwooi the 30th May 1933 and the date of this letter nay he waived. Gases, however, where proper action under para 3 above was duly taken under the 1933 amendments, and pay re- .fixed, should not be reopened. 5.

Subject;-Application of Regulation : 2(g) in Schedule - IV to the Superior Civil Services Rulesi I have 'the' honour to state that a question has arisen as to what Should he considered as the 'cost of a journey' under Regulation 2(g) of the Regulations in Schedule IV to the Superior Civil Services Rules when the fare changed by a company for a sea or air journey of an officer or a member of his family is hot quoted iii'the company's published rates. 2. It has been decided by the Auditor General with the • concurrence of the Government of India that the intention of regulation 2(g) is to lay down, in so far as a journey by sea or air is concerned, a criterion for the Audit Officer to go by in arranging for passages. The Audit Officer is to apply the rule strictly as it stands# When, therefore, the actual fare charged by a shipping company is not quoted in, or deducible from, the company's published list, the Audit Officer should not admit the charge on his own authority but he should refer the matter to the Government of India for orders. Who may decide whether the fare , a actually charged should' be deemed as the 'cost of/journey' under that rule. Similarly• when a claim for the refund of a passage is presented by an officer and the fare actually charged by the company is not apparently covered by its published rates, the Government of India may decide that such fare is the 'cost of a journey' within the me fining of Regulation 2(g). Such claim, how,ever, should always .be supported by a certificate from the company that the fare for the particular journey of the officer or a member of his family was actually charged by it 9Res.

Has the Government servant lost an eye or a limb ? 2. If the answer to (1) is in the negative, is the injury equivalent to the loss of a limb ? 3.

If the answers to the questions above are in the negative, the injury should be classified here as ' severe ' but not likely to be ' permanent', or ' slight and permanentor in similar terms. Instructions to he observed by the Medical Board, preparing the Report. 1. The medical board before recording their opinion should invariably consult the proceed ings of previous medical boards, if any, as also all previous medical documents connected with the Government servant brought before them for examination. 2. If the injuries be more than one they should be numbered and described separately ; and, should it be considered that, for instance, though only ' severe ' or ' slight ' in them selves, they represent together the equivalent of a single ' very severe ' injury, such an opinion may be expressed in the columns pro vided. 3. In answering the questions in the pre scribed form the Medical Board will confine itself exclusively to the medical aspect of the case and will carefully discriminate between the Government servant's unsupported state ments and the medical and documentary evi dence available. 4. The Board will not express any opinion, either to the Government servant examined, or in their report, as to whether he is entitled to compensation, or as to the amount of it, nor will it inform the Government servant how the in jury has been classified.

XX XX XX XX XX XX. XX XX : 61*; 00;:: .Ll'i's (1) Oompensatory allowances are to 'be, regarded as . included in remuneration for the purposes of the proviso to Section 247(1) and .Section 250(3) of the .. Act ..of 1935. (2) These allowances can 'be withdrav^i or reduced on satisfactory proof that the circumstances on which the grant was 'based have, in fact, altered to an extent justifying withdrawal. .or • reduc ti on. (3) Rules regulating these allo?/ance.s should continue (unless and until the Secretary of' State decides to exercise his rule-making powers in respect of ■ such allowances under Section 247(1 Hh) of the Act) to he made 'by the Go ver nmen ts in • India • (4) As regards Secretary of State's officers, the authorities competent 'both to decide the question of fact in (2), and to authorise .withdrawal or reduction of allowances (other than travelling allowances) are:- ■ (a) In the case of officers to whom subsection 3 . of Section 258 of the Act of 1935 applies, the Secretary of State. . ) j..:, mm2. ( I d ) In the case of other officers, the &gt; ■ aovernor-G-eneral exercising his individual judgment as regards officers serving in connection with the affairs of the Federation and the Governor exercising his individual judgment as regards officers serving in connection with the affairs of a Province. I am asked to add, as regards the decision in (2) ahove that no inference should 'be drawn as to what, if any, power of variation may exist as regards pensions and, in particular, special additional pensions. As the G-overnment of India are aware, the Secretary of State is awaiting a reply to a reference addressed to them in regard to the conditions of award generally of special additional pensions and any interpretation that may he required of the expression 'terms as respects (remuneration and) -pension ' will he reserved for consideration when that reply is received. As regards the decision in (4)(h) that the Governor shall exercise his individual judgment in deciding the question of fact and authorising the withdrawal or reduction of allowances granted to Secretary of State's officers it was fully realised in reaching this decision that these allowances have 'been in the past normally granted, reduced or withdrawn 'by Provincial Governments, i.e. under Provincial autonomy 'by Governors acting on the advice of their Ministers. In the case, however, of members of the provincial and subordinate services who were in the service 'before 1st April, 1937, only the Governor exercising his individual judgment can authorise reduction or withdrawal of compensatory allovrances once granted in virtue of the terms of the direction issued under Section 241(3)(a), and in the case of Secretary of Stated officers to whom subsection (3) of Section 258 applies only the Secretary of State can approve the reduction or withdrawal of such allowances. X X X X xxx x x t x y X XCoot of letter No .261l37/545, dated the 4th rehruary 1939, from the Government of Burma, finance Department, to the Burma Office, London. Subject:- Intention of the Secretary of State under J section 105(1)(h), and interpretation of 'remuneration' in the proviso toseCtion lOSUKti), of the G-overnment of Bumia Act, 1935. I am directed to request that if there is no objection the Secretary of State may he moved to give a ruling on the follomng points 24 Section 105(1 Kh) of the Government of Burma Act, 1935, presdrihes that as respects matters not included in section 105(1)(a) the Governor may make rules governing the conditions of service of persons appointed by the Secretary of State in so far as the Secretary of State does not think fit to make such rules. The Secretary of State has not so far made rules governing the grant of compensatory local allowances in Buma. It is presumed ttorefore that the Governor is competent to make such rules for officers appointed hy the Secretary of State (including officers appointed hy the Secretary of State in Council prior to the 1st April 1937) hut ■before this power is exercised it seems desirable to ascertain whether this omission ht the Secretary of State is deliberate or Whether he intends, to frame rules at some future date. In this connection a reference is invited to the despatch Military No.l dated 29th March 1938 from the Secretary of State for iniia to His Excellency the Governor-General of India (copy of extract attached) in which it was stated that as regards defence services in India amendments to existing rules need not be submitted to the Secretary of State for previous approval if they concern compensatory and local allowances. 3. The proviso to section 105(1)(b) prescribes ^2. that as respects remuneration no rules made by the Governor shaai have effect so as to give any person appointed -by the Secretary of State less favourable terms than were given to him hy the rules in force on the date on ^vhich he ^as first apyointed, or, in the case of officers appointed hy. the Secretary of State in Council prior to 1st April 1937, than those given oy the rules in force on 31st March 1937. it is necessary to ascertain whetter compensatory local allowances (other than Burma allowance) are remuneration within the meaning of this proviso. It is presumed that such allowances are not remuneration hut a reference is invited' to paragraph 70 of the Confidential Circular issued hy the Secretary of State regarding the future of the All-India and Central ■ Services in Burma, in uhich he has ruled that Burma allowance is to he treated as 'remuneration'. 4.; The circumstances necessitating this reference are as follows. Certain officers appointed hy the Secretary of State in Council who were on the 31st March 1937 serving , in departments which were then central are entitled to draw Bangoon Compensatory Allowance according to the rules prescribed in Covernment of India, Finance Department Resolution No.5067, Civil Service Regulation dated 10th October 1924 (copy attached). The Government of India have since withdrawn the correspooiing compensatory'allowances from similar officers stationed in Calcutta and Bombay m their 'Finance Department Resolution Ho.?. ^-XXTI/Bx. 11/36, dated 8th April 1937 (copy attached). In these circumstances it is considered that the continued grant to the above : mentioned officers of Rangoon Compensatory Allowance at the m c-e favourable India rates is no longer justifiable, and that the Secretary of State's assurance to members of the All-India Services contained in his Confidential Circular referred/referred to in paragraph 3 a'bove will in no way 'be contravened if a direction is issued, as in the draft notification a copy of which is submitted herewith, . that these officers shall in future draw Bangoon Compensatory Allowance according to the rules applicable to other officers in Burma. 5. If it is the Secretary of State's intention to make in due course for officers appointed hy him rules governing the grant of compensatory allowance in Burma then it would appear desirable to modify the draft notification to exclude such officers from its scope. If compnesatafy local allowances (other than Burma allowance) are to he regarded as remuneration then, even if it is decided that there is no objection to the Governor making this notification applicable to the Secretary of State's officers, it will be necessary to modify the draft and make it applicable to future recruits only. 6.

I am directed to say that the position is that though leave on medical certificate, as such, cannot he taken except in EWpplement of ordinary leave on average pay earned hy duty, there is nothing to prevent an officer frcm talcing ordinary leave on medical grounds, that is, leave on average pay should he consumed first whether it is on medical certificate or otheiwise and that the additional leave on medical certificate subject to the limitations prescribed in the relevant rules of the Model leave Terms can be granted only in continuation of the leave on average'pay or ^en no such leave is admissible.

Subject*- Recall of officers from leave out of India on the outbreak of war. In view of the enquiries that are being made as to the rules applicable to the officers recalled from leave out of. India on the outbreak of war, the undersigned is directed to issiie the following general instructions for guidance (1) The recall to duty will be treated as compulsory in all cases where officers were directed by competent authority to return to duty before the expiry of their leave, irrespective of the period of leave curtailed. (E) An order to report at an assembling centre by a specified date prior to the expiry of leave will be treated as a'compulsory recall. (3) The officers so recalled will be entitled to the concessions that may be.admissible under Fundamental Rule 70. (4) For the purposes of this rule, under the peculiar circumstances of the recall, the period of voyage will be taken to commence from the date on which the officer boarded the steamer irrespective of the date of sailing, and for those that reported at an assembling centre prior to embarkation the period of voyage will commence from the date of reporting. (5) These concessions will be given even to an officer who may actually have resumed charge of his duties in India later than he would have in the ordinary course, after the expiry of the full period of his leave, provided he had been compulsorily recalled as described above and the delay in resuming charge of his duties was due to his having followed specific' instructions from competent authority regarding transport. (6) No travelling allowance will be admissible for journeys in England from the places of residence to the various assembling centres; nor will any halting allowance be given for the period of detention at such places. Travelling allowance for journeys in India will, however, be admissible in accordance with the provisions of Supplementary Rule 142. (7) The cost of the passages arranged for by Government will be borne by Government. In the case of those who had themselves arranged previously for their return passages, the refund obtained in respect of the tickets returned to the High Commissioner will be re-imbursed to the officers except that in the case of officers entitled to passage benefits the refund will be credited to their Passage Accounts to the extent..,.extent to which the cost of the passage was originally paid from that accounts j^c&gt; vva&amp; Under Secretary to the^Government of India, J.. . : • ■ : • ■ ■ ' V ' 1 ' ' To , &amp;i j r , , ; i; i. .

Sir, I am directed to state that the Central G-overnment have had under consideration the question of the passage 'benefits for superior officers on contract on their retention in permanent G -overnment service. In accordance with rule lik(a) of the Superior Oivil Services Hules, the date of substantive -appointment is to 'be regarded as the date of appointment for the pruposes of regulation 5 of the passage regulations in Schedule IV to the Superior Oivil Services Rules. It is considered, .however, that these officers should not oe deprived of any passage benefits that may 'be due to them on the date of their substantive appointment to Government service under the terms of their old agreement. The-Governor General in Council has, accordingly, decided that an officer on , contract on permanent retention in Government service in a service or post under his rule-making control, should receive, in addition to such credit for passages as may be admissible to him on the date of his permanent retention in Government service under the passage rules and regulations applicable to him, a further credit equal to the sum which would be admissible to him under the terms of his contract on account of a return passage to England (or at his option of a passage to any other country, at a cost not exceeding that of a passage to England) on the termination/termina.tion of his contract in the ordinary course, provided that;the total credit does not exceed that which ftfould have he en admiqsihl| to him had he t^en- substantively appointed to a permanent post from the very beginning. No such benefit will be allowed in respect of any passage which the 'contract may have provided to enable an officer to proceed on leave on medical certificate, whether any such passage was availed of by the officer or not.

With reference to your-letter Nd.D.II.7/29/1726, dated the 18th November 1939, on the subject mentioned above, I have the honour to state that in Fundamental Rule 22(a) the expression 'If he holds a lien on a permanent post' should be held to include the lien on a permanent post to which a Government'servant is appointed in a provisional substantive capacity under Pundarnental Rule 14(d), and the expression 'substantive pay in respect of the old post' ih that rule be held to include' hia substantive pay in-respect of that provisional substantive appointment. Fundamental Rule 22(a) should therefore be held to- permit the substantive pay in respect of a provisional substantive appointment being taken into account in determining the initial pay. 2. in the case referred to by you the pay. drawn in the permanent appointment of Senior Accounts clerk in the scale of Rs.105-5-125 held by the person concerned in a provisionally -p ; - &gt; substantive capacity should be regarded as suUstahtive pay for the purpose of fixing initial pay under Fundamental Rule 22. Once his pay is so fixed in the post of Divisional Accountant his pay in that post should not change even if the clerk reverts from his provisional appointment during the tenure of his appointment in the post of Divisional Accountant^ 3, The Government of India have concurred in this view.9^ OFFICE OF THE A C'CCUNTAITT GENERAL ■ CENTRAL REVENUES ' NEW DELHI. » ■ No,C 13-30-59&amp;, Gated xhe 31st January, 1940, From The■ACCOUNTANT GENERAL,. ■ CENTRAL RE VETOES'r To P-FEB 1940.

I to V of Chapter X of the ■Secretary of State 's FUndajnental. Rule-s, did' so 'and'tes 'thereby held to havQ lost under, Fundamental Rul's 93-A all leave he had at credit on the ..dat e of his- 'transfer, nbtw ith- st an ding the fact that;,.,the two ••sets-' of^ru^-es--wer e identi cal. I am to point out, w ith the concurrence of the Secretary of State that fundamental Rule 93-A should not be given retrospective effect, and that it'applies only to those persons who. are transferred from one service to another, as contemplated in that rule, on or 'after the 13th of April 1938. . i ■ 2. At the time fundamental Rule 93^'was framed, it was not appreciated, that those who were before such transfertransfer subject to leave rules identical with those in* the EUndaraerital Rules also would-be called upon to elect*. Otherwise the rule would have been different ly worded and- the possibility of an election serving •no special bbject would have beeft avoided. In view of the anomaly resulting from such election I am to suggest that all accounts officers should, when asking any such officer to elect under Fundamental Rule draw his attention to, the fact that where the leave rules to which he 'was subject before his promotion, are identical with these'in the Fundamental Rules, he gains no advantage by electing the latter. - - 3. As regards officers so transferred prior to the 13th^pril 1938, they become compulsorily and automatically subject to the Secretary of State's Leave Rules under fundamental Rule 58. In their case the question arises whether the unspent balance of leave earned by them under the rules formerly applicable to them should lapse as a result of their coming'under the Secretary of Stat e f s Rules. As the rules'stand, the only, provision in the fundamental Rules, which enables an officer to carry forward the unspent balance of leave earned under rules other than the fundamental Rules, is fundamental Rule 77. . This rule permits leave earned under the Civil Service. Regulations and the Military Leave Rules to be carried forward, but it does not contemplate cases in which the leave rules applicable to an officer before his transfer are identi- cal with those in the fundamental Rules which became applicable to him after the transfer. The change of leave rules in such cases is purely, nominal and the intention was that the balance of leave standing to the credit of the officer on the date of bis transfer should\ 1 : - 3 - toe allowed to stand, although the intention was not strictly covered toy the provisions of the.rules (Funda mental/Rule. 77) * The Governor General in ,Council now -raakgs:this.Intention clear toy issuing this interpreta tion under, JUndarnent ^r Rule 8« 4. These interpretations will similarly apply also to cases of transfer from a Provincial service to a service under the rule making control of the Governor General in Council.

Subjec:t: - Grant of compassionate allowance under Article 353, Civil Service Regulations. With a view to clear the doubts that 1 appear to exist in respect of the tfactors that generally guide Government in dealing with applications for such' allowa J nces and the consequent difficulties experienced by the Departments in making-recommendations in this behalf, the undersigned is directed to.state as follows:- Article 353, Civil Service Regulations, vests Government with an absolute discretion to grant or hot to grant any compassionate allowance-, the only restriction being that, if granted, it shal l not exceed the maximum of two-thirds of the pension that would be admissible .to'the officer concerned on retirement on medical certificate. I : t is practically 'impossible: iix vi^w -of the .wide' variia.tions^tha t na turally •esxist in- -the circums tapc^B.''a^t&amp;'n case , to lay down categorically precise principles that c.an uniformly be applied to individual cases. Each case has therefore to be ' . ft \ i;&gt; considered on its merits and a conclusion has to be reached on the question whether there were any such extenuating features in the case as would make the punishment awarded, though it may have been necessary in the interests of Government, unduly hard on the individual. In Considering this question it has been the practice to take into account not only the actual misconduct or course of misconduct which occasioned the dismissal or removal of the officer, but also the kind of service he has rendered. Where the course of misconduct carries with it the legitimate inference that the officer r s service has been dishonest, there can seldom be any good case for a compassionate allowance- Poverty is not an -CBSontial....essential condition precedent to the grant of a com passionate allowance; but special regard is also occasionally paid to the fact that the officer has a wife and children dependent upon him, though this factor by itself is not, except perhaps in the most exceptional circumstances, sufficient, for the grant of a compassionate allowance • .

Under the Central Subordinate (Inferior) Service? (Gratuity, Pension and Retirement) Rules, inferior Government .servants who are recruited after the 1st April 1936 have to retire on reaching the age of 60 years, and under these rules, as amended by Notification No.F.6(23)-R.11/40, dated the 8th May 1940, an inferior servant has to put in at least 35 years' service before he can earn full retiring pension. The amendment to the Administrative Instruction is thus intended, as far as possible, to eliminate persons entering service at advanced ages and subsequently^ entertaining a grievance that they are not allowed to continue in service till they earn the full ponsion. If in any special case, therefore, the Head of a Department should desire to make an exception to this age-limit, it is considered de ir?ble that at the time of recruitment the recruit should be made aware of the fact that he is unlikely to be able to earn full pens ion, I have the honour to be, Sir , Your most obedient servent, (1 Under Secretary to the Government of India.

OFFICE I EUORANDIB: Subject ; Medical leave imder the Revised Leave Rules, 1933. The undersigned is directed to state that a case has recently come to notice in which a person to whor the Revised Leave Rules, 1933, apply has within a period of a little over t:o years practi cally exhaused all the medical leave admissible under Rule 14 ibi d., his total service being only 6 years. In viev^ of the undesirable consequences that may result from using up all such leave, in the early part of one's service, it is considered tha long stretches of such leave should not be sanctioned without careful scrutinj. In particular the sanctioning authority should be satisfied in each case that after the expiry of the leave the Government servant will be fit for duty. Medical authorities are precluded fror recomend- ing the grant of leave in cases in which there appears to be no reasonable prospect of a Government servant bein ever fit to resure his duties. In doubtful cases, the sanctioning authority can further satisfy itself by asking for the medical authority's opi nion specifically on this point, or where the leave has been recom mended by an authority other than a medical committee, by referring the case to such a committee. The Supplementary rules clearly lay down that the possession of a medical certificate as prescribed therein does not in itself confer upon the Grovernment servant con cerned any right to leave and in extreme cases it may be necessary to refuse the leave altogether in order that the Government servant may be invalided from service. The Departments of the Government of India are requested to bring these facts to the notice of the various authorities competent to sanction leave, (Sd.) S.

I am directed to state that the Governmentjof Madras, have, as a consequence of the abolition of the system of commutatioh of pensions in respept of persons ...under, their rule-making control , (vide their G.O, NO,51, 10th January, 1939*(copy enclosed), further decided not to permit commu4iation even in the case of a person, governed, by rule 4 of the Civil Pensions (Commutation) Rules, • who retires from the. service of the Central Government if his pension becomes wholly a--' charge'on the Maciras Government. , 2. ; Under the existing' arrangement a pension, that is. divisible ^between the Madras Government and the Central Government becomes .wholly a Provincial or a Central charge according as it is drawn from a Provin cial or a Central treasury and either Government discharges its entire liability tp the other by paying in lump the capitalised value of its Share. fHe ; decision of the Madras Government, therefore, . .'precludes the consideration of an application for commutation of pension in the case ,of an.officer who having served under that Govern ment.: retires from the Central Government- and draws his pension from .a Madras treasury if he applies for commutation after pension has been sancticnei- the preamble to the regulations governing,.the.•procedure for the commutation of pensions requiring .such an application to be made to the Madras Government ' and thus places him at a disadvantage as com pared with. a similar, officer who either applies before the pension is sanctioned or who draws his pension from a Central treasury, 3. The Government of India have decided, therefore, to abrogate^the existing arrangement regarding the discharge of pensionary liability referred to above, in so far as it concerns pensions sanctioned on or after the last April., 1340,. divisible between the Government of Madras and the Central Government, of those who retire from the service of the Central Government'and. who are governed in the natter of commuta tion by rule 4 of the Civil Pensions (Commutation) Rules. Inter^ governmental adjustments in such cases will be effected by the liquida- tion of■shares of actual pensions disbursed.by means of monthly debits, 4. It has further been decided, that .applications for commutation by such persons afte;p the pension is^anctioned ___ whether the sanction was before or after the.1st April, 1940, _ which till now had to be made to the Government of Madras should henceforth be made to and dealt with by the authority of the Central Government who would have been competent, to deal .with them had they been made prior to the sanction of the pension. Since, however, the Central Government cannot commute the share of the pension that has to be borne by the Madras •Government, 'Which'will be met by that Government only in monthly instalments, the amount to be co,mmuted in the case of such persons will hereafter be restricted to the Central Government 1 s share of the pension air half t'he total pension whichever is less, ^whether they - apply for commutation before or after the pension is sanctioned and irrespective/, •»'irrespective of the . treasury from which it is drawn. In \ the case of such persons^ however, whose pensions had been sanctioned before 1st Apri^,_1940 and have become wholly the charge of the Central Government in pursuance of the arrangement mentioned in paragraph 2, it has been.decided not to restrict the commutable amount to the Central Government's share. 5 if it is less than half the full pension,'since the Government of Madras have already liquidated their liability in full* by payment in lump# 5. Rule 32 of Part IV of Appendix 3 to the Account Code, 'Volume I, First Edition, 1940, wiir c hereafter cease to be operative in the case of such pensions divisible between the Central Government and the ODvernment of Madras and -it has been decided in consultation with the Auditor-General that the entire' commuted value in such cases should be debited to the Central Government. 6. Though.the abrogation of the existing arrangement is to take effect in respect of such divisible pensions sanctioned on or after 1st April, 1940, it. will be' noticed that such persons whose pensions were sanctioned prior to- that date also .have been permitted to apply to the competent, authority of; the Central Government: If th'ey. desire to commute a. portion of their pension. Xf in the case of any such ,, person v/hose pension was sanctioned prior to 1st April, 1940, and had become wholly a Provincial charge, the-cauthor,ity of the Central Government concerned permits commutation, it has been agreed with the Madras Government in consultation with' the Auditor-General that the commuted value of the pension originally paid by the Central Govern ment to Madras less the amount actually disbursed by.,them - in respect of the Central share of the pension should be- refunded to the Central Government. ■ J ,' .... o •/.• j r 7. The Government of India have in this connection further considered .the question whether persons who retire from service under 'the.

He should not be restored to his original position unless this is specifically laid down at the time the order of punishment is passed or revised on appeal; (3) An officer in respect of whom the penalty preferred to was imposed will on repromotion count previous service in the higher grade under Fundamental Rule 22 unless the order of punishment or the order passed on appeal directs otherwise; and (4) An order debarring an officer from counting his past s ® r y i QeJ-n the grade from which he is reduced, if and when reappointed to it, amounts to an order of reduction to a stage of that grade lower than that admissible under Fundamental Rule not » therefore, fall outside the scope of rule 1 I t J 1 A ^ lassif ica ' fc ion Rules or rule 3(iii) of the rules published with the Home Department notification referred to above K t t0 r qU ?! t ttoat the ab0Te de °i8ion a may be noted lor information and guidance.0 s Copy of letter fro^ the Grovernment of India, Finance Department tb. the PrbTincial Governments, Ho.F,2(3)-.
