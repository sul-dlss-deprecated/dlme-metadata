Karachi, 17th November 1931 My dear friend, During the two interviews I have had with ):our Highness regarding your proposed abdication, I have explained to Your Highness the very serious effect on the financial position of the Muscat State that this step will have^Your Highness has finally asked me to communicate the decision of the Government of India to you in writing in order that you may give me a written reply. 1 wri-to therefore write to inform your Highness that in the event of your persisting in your intention to abdicate* ^i) The Government of India will find themselves constrained to advise the Muscat State Council that Your Highness’ allowance in India should be reduced to Rs.2000 per mensem and { ii) That the Arms Tra ffic Suo^ year to the Muscat State will ceasje. As Your Highness is aware almost every country in the world is going through, at the present time.a period of financial difficul * ' , . * l/- and economic distress and the Muscat is no exception, with great difficulty and owing to the most drastic measures of retrenchment the State has succeeded in balancing its budget, but the coming year is likely to be even more difficult than the last,^it is hardly necessary to point out the disastrous effect of the loss of Rs. 1 lakh on the finance of the State which Your Highness 1 abdication will impose. Surely it is not much to ask that to avert this Your Highness should agree to spend the short period of 3 months at Muscat at a time of year when the climate is exceedingly pleasant and healthy. I hope therefore that even now Your Highness will reconsider the decision that you have given me verbally. Sd. H.V. Biscoe•wbn g* V* + ^ VH Q n-O-l PB Copy To The Hon f hle Colonel H.V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf A. C In accordance with Your Honour's telegraphic request to meet you at Karachi on the 7th November to discuss important matters relative to the question of my proposed abdication pf . the Sultanate, I complied with your request and we met on the 16th November and discussed the matter* I replied verbally to your s . , advice^persuasion and encouragement and explained at the same time the cause of my ailments which I fear may increase on my return to Muscat and which did happen during my past visits. t greatly regret that I am unable to return to Muscat and have explained this in my previous correspondence to Your Honour and the Political Agent, Muscat. I desire only the welfare of the State of Muscat and have accepted ( according to the instructions of the Government of India to the Government of Muscat, the reduction in my personal expenditure. I do not wish to over burden our Government finance with my personal expenditure while I am out of Muscat. I accept Rs.2000/- per mensem as stated in Your Honour's letter dated Karachi the 17th November 1931. With regard to the Arms Subsidy which would go to the revenue of the Muscat State, if the Government have proposed to discontinue the payment, it is left to their kindness ana they are free either to pay or to discontinue it: I have nothing to say whatever. We are all well aware of the financial difficulty and crisis prevailing throughout the world; had we not known it we would not have agreed to enforce economics in our State as instructed by you. I request Your Honour to refer to the Government my decision to abdicate the Sultanate abrogating all Government rights from today and appointing as my successor ( my son Saiyid Said bin Taimur ( the Sultan of our State. 1 have no objection2 administration and I have recommended that he should consult the Political Agent Muscat in all important matters. I regret 'being unable to return to Muscat for a few months during the year as requested by Your Honour. I did not refuse to come when I was in a position to do so. 1 had considered my previous visits^as you are aware, provisional. 1 have reconsidered this matter several times since many years but find nothing to change my intention. I wish well to the loyal friends of the State and its officials. Yours sincerely Sd. Taimur.

At the same time having regard to the peculiar re la oi ous w A hch exist between His rajesty’s Government and the Huscat state, wh-ich - though nominally independent - is in reality, to rany intents and purposes, under British protection, I mmnr i u would be most desirable to obtain from the new ruler some statement that, in re darn lor recognition, he wcula be pre^areu to follow the advice oi that Government.

Ihoy obviously cannot be asked to elect a fttltat* ohooe authority they do n t acknowledge. 7. jJic Sultan has appointed aehie succecaor hie son, Baiyid Said. ^.he latter is now 22 youre old. no has for the last two years acted as 'resident of the Council and has acnuired a practical knowledge of %}m ac* Mi n is t rati on of the State. while during the first year he took 'but little active part in the administration, which was largely in the hands of Mr.ihomt* and the elder mmbara of the Council# during the last 12 months he has very definitely asserted himself.

I would suggest therefore that if the trovernaent of India accept the abdication of Said Tairaur and agree to the succession of Saiyid Bald I should be authorised to accord Saiyid Said formal recognition as Sultan of Muscat. This I would do at a public durbar which I consider should be as imposing a function as the financial position of the State will permit of, and to which if possible same of the Shaikhs from the interior should be invited. At the same time, I would suggest that I should be authorised to write him another letter bringing the above passage in Said Taimur’s letter to hie notice am recalling the financial assistance and armed support given to the Btate in the past and inform him that the Government of India trust that until the finances have been put on a satisfactory footing and the debts liquidated, he will keep the Political Agent generally informed regarding the condition of the finances, and that the strength of the Levy Corps will nt»t be reduced below the present figure of 150, all ranks, and that adequate provision will be made int&amp;« budget to smintein it i» e state of l mmM Utm&amp;m feefdreham verhelly for BaAyid MM to ohoe mo hie draft reply ead eouid eoe tlmt it mm ouitabXy oorded. at aXi XntmetabXe.

Sir, j,.# 1 *- In continuation ©f my telegram No.40 ©f '' hruary x 1932, I have the honour to enclose herewith a letter in Arabic, with English translation addressed to you by His Highness. 2. His Highness’s accession to©lc place on the 10th instant without incident. There was a certain amount of discussion between his uncles when they were informed of the lat© Sultan’s abdication, but the latter’s letter to His Highness nominating him as his successor, and your letter conveying the fact that the accession had the approval of His Majesty* Government disposed of any serious opposition that might have been offered. As a matter ©f fact considering that His Highness had already acted virtually as Sultan in his capacity of President of the Council, that he was the eldest son of Sir Taimur bin Faisal, and that he was generally looked on as the Hair Apparent, n© other member ©f the Royal Family had any claims to the throne. 3.

On t&amp;e 11th instant, as arranged with His Highness I aade mj official call on him, with Captain Mackay, t© offer my congratulations on the 'Id and on his accession* There were present members of the Royal Family and notables. I made a short speech to which His Highness replied. 6. As far as can be judged the abdication of Sir Taimur bin Faisal and trie accession of Kis Highness have caused little stir or excitement in Muscat* The late Sultan owing to his prolonged absence from his dominions had faded out @f the picture, and his son was looked on as the inevitable heir* Moreover the population of Muscat ar© eoimiercially not politically minded, and such matters as the export price of dates and fish, and the import price of piece goods together with the rise and fall of the dollar, are probably of more real interest to them, especially in these hard times, than the accession of a new Sultan. Such interest as has been displayed in the town is all in favour of His Highness. The tribes along the coast, and in the interior, will doubtless display more concern. ;ihen indications of their attitude are received I will submit a further report.

This kharita is sent as a sign of the long standing friendship that has existed for nearly three centuries between the Government of India and the Stat-e of Muscat and ’Oman. Throughout these years relations between India and Muscat nave been very close and the Government of India . have given many proofs of their deep interest in the fortunes of the Muscat State, In good times they have rejoiced in her prosperity, and in times of difficulty they have frequently extended to her their practical sympathy and support. Since a long time the Muscat State has been in close treaty relations with the British Government, who have always evinced their lively interest in its I II-;- 2 - its fortunes, and it gives me great pleasure to come here today as the bearer of this letter, an outward sign of these friendly relations, which I am confident will always endure. May I now strike a more personal note ? It is now about 2-|' years since I have held rny present appointment, and during this time I have watched with interest*and with sympathy Your Highness 1 career, and have devoted much considera tion to the welfare of your State. Owing to the fact that Your Highness* father was for long periods absent from the State, it was necessary for Your Highness, despite your youth, to assume the very responsible post of President seen of the Council, and I have aodxcdxxk with sympathy and admiration the manner in which, at a time when most other young men in your position are leading irresponsible and care—free liveo, ycu have fulfilled the heavy duties of this jiigh position.

Shaikh gubair is a quiet, steady-going individual who was formerly on the Council for many years past, and will, I hope, supervise the adiainis ration oi justice adequately* His Highness does not desire that these persons should receive the title of n Ministers ,, , and I think proposes to take a very active part in the administration himself. 4 ^ in this connection I would venture to put before the Government of India certain considerations which, I think. and which are the outcome of numerous conversations which .• have had on different occasions with His Highness the Sultan. Ve have now to deal with a very different personality to that veryvery attractive personality and l do not thin* he will be difficult t© deal with, provided he is not, if I may use an expression so much in vogue on tills side of the Gulf,‘pin- pricked' over minor matters, and given at least that measure of autonomy which is enjoyed ty the states in India• j &gt;&gt; Xo illustrate ay aeanins 1 would Mention that in a I disouesion which 1 had with His Hijinesa at. Sar reaardin* the finances of the State, the question of the increase of tariff came up and His Highness asked ae auout the difficulties that had arisen in connection with obtaining the consent of the American Government. X mentioned that, as he was aware, the American Government in return for their consent-were asking for most favoured nation treatment in respect of perswial status for their subjects. in m Hxpress letter iio.Vo-o of 12th February 1932, I expreseed the view that the State were unwilling to give this moat favoured nation treatment to American subjects largely for reasons of amour propre. In their telegram Ho.669 of 1st March 1932 to the ueoretary of State for India, tne Government of inula expressed the view tuat i had perhaps exonerated somewhat this sentiment, i can aseure the Government of India that this is not so. His Highness spoke very strongly on the subject ef these treaties and asked whether the State was to be bound for ever oy treaties entered into a century ago with his ignorant fore fathers, and whether the State could not denounce them. 'Surely*, he said,* there must be some way of enuoig a treaty'. He went on to ask why he should *.ive the same treatment to American subjects as he accorded to British subjects; his relations with the British were totally different to those With any other Gtate. He owed much to the British but nothing to other countries. 1 could not help feeling much sympathywith His Highness* point of view 6. Again, some Muscat subjects in Clmrtear are encountering certain difficult is© about passports with the Persians, aiid have appealed to the Muscat State for assistance. His Highness has addressed a letter to the Political Agent saying that if his subjects in Char bar are ill-treated he will retaliate on Persian subjects resident in Muscat. I am investigating the matter, but merely mention these incidents now as examples of the feeling© and character of the ultan with whom we are called on to deal. in the Persian Gull' to administer their own States with as little interference by ua in internal affair© as possible. ,; f e are adopting this policy elsewhere, and it is in accordance with present day views arid sentiments moreover i bel icvu it to ue %lm most advantageous policy for ourselves, as ms strongly emphasised by the Government of India in respect oi Bahrain, in their telegram Bo.3458-3 of 27th November 1929 to His Majesty 1 © secretary of dtate for Iraiia.

To sum ups hare now in Muscat a youn c ” Sultan who if tactfully handled should, I think, turn out a good ruler* He should, X thi!^ be given every chance to administer his State on Arab lines and every effort should be made to free him from those relics of the past which are galling to him, I while we should try at the same time to build up a facade of independence in the eyes of the world* 1 do nc t thi hk tnere is any risk of his failing to abide by his undertaking to be guided by us in important matters; he is certainly desirous of retain ing Captain Alban* s services as long as possible and told me that he felt that he would for many years to come need the services of a European to manage the finances of his State, since there was no local official who was in any way cozapetent to d© so* I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India* X have the honour to be.
