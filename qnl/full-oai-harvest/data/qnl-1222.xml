The first of two items in the file is a letter (dated 28 January 1932) from the Special Secretary to ‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd (Ibn Sa‘ūd) King of Hejaz and Najd, to Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Biscoe, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (folios 1A-5). The letter summarises a number of points arising from a meeting that took place between Biscoe and Ibn Sa‘ūd.All of the points concern the development of formal relations between Najd and Bahrain, and other British protectorates and colonies, including India. Points covered include the instigation of formal procedures for issuing passports and visas for travellers between Najd and Bahrain, Kuwait and India, the set-up of wireless communications between Najd and Bahrain, the extradition of Najdi criminals from Bahrain, exchange of mail, and papers for commercial vessels. The English translation of the letter (folios 3-5) has been annotated, with parts relating to visas for Indian subjects highlighted.In Tuson,
