The only cover in the Order in Council for charging consular fees seems to be article 90 which refers to the 'Court' performing consular functions and this is very vague. elsewhere for the application of the consular fee table it looks as if there should be an additional Order in Council authorizing all Gulf posts except Muscat (who is a Consul) to apply this fee table. His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident,* Persian Gulf, Bahrain. The Judicial Assistant informs me The service is clearly a notarial I notice, however, that while the Political Officer Bahrain is, under Article 83 Unless provision has been made Yours H.G. Jakiils / \ ^ nnr ^ )Thanks for your/let R-421-5/2 of the 17tn September- ab^utr' consular fees. I propose to refer this and similar legal conundrums to Judge Haines when he arrives as my Judicial Assistant. Meanwhile, I suggest that you should charge consular fees when they are due as though you were a Consular Officer. Your authority to do so is not likely to be challenged but if necessary you can quote article 90 (ii) of the Crder-j-ii- Council. H.G. Jakins, Esq., Political Agent, Bahrain.© COPY w.85/64/49 85/64/49 I think that article 90(ii) is wide enough to enable the Court of the Political -agent to charge Consular fees for any Consular jact it performs. We could provide in the Court Fees Rules which need revision something to the effect that when the Court of the Political Agent performs a Consular function the appropriate fee of the Consular lee Table may be charged. This will put the matter beyond doubt.
