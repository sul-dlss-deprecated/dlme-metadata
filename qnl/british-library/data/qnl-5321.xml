As Mr. Metcalfe got free 'board and lodging there is not sufficient justification for granting him a customs compensatory allowance of Rs. 100/- p.m. The Governor General in Council is, however, pleased to sanction the grant to him of a customs compensatory allowance of Rs. 50/- p.m. 3. The extra expenditure involved should he divided equally between His Majesty^ Government and the Indian revenues as the appointment of Lieutenant Metcalfe as Personal Assistant obviated the necessity of filling the temporary post of the Personal Assistant on Rs. 200/- p»m. which is equally divisible.

I have (besides my cook and bearer, both of whom I shall want in Bushire) (i) a Goan butler, (ii) a man who does bath water and waits at table, (iii) a masalchi and (iv) a cook's mate. I would suggest your taking them on for the period during which you are officiating and then you would have plenty of time before I return to find suitable men for your own house. I vmuld propose to leave the butler in chaise of the house and will gladly pay half his wages (his pay is iis.70/-). You would find him valuable for running 'At Homes' and so on, and he would be definitely under your control for disciplinary purposes. You would, as a bachelor, perhaps hardly want a butler when Assistant Political Agent, so you may like to use him in this way while ofiiciating as Political Agent. Phe others receive (ii) &amp;S.22/', (iii) Ks.14 and (iv) gets paid by the cook, to whom I give t{s.lO/~ extra because of some (alleged and partly true) difficulty in getting hold of mates.

If Hickinbotham 1 s leave is sanctioned, I would suggest that, provided that you think that he is suitable, Howes who will be acting as Assistant Political Agent should continue in that appointment for the period of Hickinbotham's leave. this arrangement would be useful in training Howes and would prevent my having to start again with an Assistant Political Agent entirely new to the work at the beginning of the cold weather.

Hickinbotham hurried his journey and reached Bahrain on the 22nd March at my telegraphic request (although Captain G.A. Cole was not proceeding on leave till the 4th April), as owing to various changes in the staff of my office and reorganization of the Confidential Office, it was desirable that he should have a few days with Captain Cole in order to familiarize himself with the work and help to get the new arrangements into working order. 3, I had intended (but fear that I did not make myself clear) that a request should be made, if necessary, for an extension of Captain Hickinbotham 1 s joining time. 4, I would now request that my letter mentioned above may be cancelled and that Captain Hickinbotham' s joining time may be extended by 6 days, the period Vj /by which 'the Joining time ordinarily admissible , , has been exceeded. 6.
