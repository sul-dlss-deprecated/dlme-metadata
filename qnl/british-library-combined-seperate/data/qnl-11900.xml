An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-210; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled.The foliation sequence does not include the front and back covers, nor does it include the leading and ending flyleaves. A previous foliation sequence between ff 189-243, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume consists of correspondence concerning the Administration Annual Reports of the Muscat Political Agency and of the Muscat Infantry for the years 1942-43 to 1945-46 and contains copies of all the reports.The volume features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Director General of Customs, Muscat; the President of the Municipal Council, Muscat; the Military Adviser to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; Cable and Wireless Limited; Gray, Mackenzie and Co.There is some correspondence in Arabic, with the President of the Municipal Council, Muscat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>President of the Municipal Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Muscat and Oman, Director-General of Customs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Gray, Mackenzie and Company Limited, shipping agents</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000072#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000072#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000072#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
