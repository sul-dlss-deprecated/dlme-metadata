Sir, \ I have the honour to forwwrad for the disposal of the Hon’ble the Political Resident the evidence I have recorded in the case of the accident between S.S.handra and a dhow on the I2th August at 6.a.m at a spot about 12^ miles from Bahrein taken in the matter without the aid of naval assessors, and I ^ave no doubt the case will be forwarded to the Government of Bombay who will dispose of it in the usual way. amined the only two passengers of the boat available, and went on board the S.S.Bandra and took the evidence of all the offi cers and men who were in any way connected with the indident. This I have submitted. Council sections 8.(6) and 19 (2) does not appear to extend to trying a case of this nature, and indeed, until the owner of the jollyboat make some claim, (no doubt he considers in giving evidence before me he has done so ) I do not see what I can do beyond recording statements as I have done. tion have asked me for copies of all the evidence I have taken in the matter, and I would be glad of telegraphic orders as to whether I should comply with their request or not. Their only locus standi is that they are the agents of the owners of the vessel. I would be glad to know if such copies should 2. It is obvious that no further action can be 3.

(about a mile from the Agency office)* I could not take any other direction or change my course because if I bad done so my boat would have capsized. The steamer never changed its direction but kept straight on not altering its course. I was on the watch myself and made sign and waved to them. ?.e were about 150 yards away when we shouted* The steamer never blew its whistle. We were about 150 yards away when we thought they would hit us, but we thought they would change their course and would not touch us. I could not take my sail down as the wind was very high and I should have had water filling the boat and we would have sunk. I had a cargo of rice, sugar, tea, ghi, dates and coffee fuel (firewood) and five hundred rupees in cash end also pearls which I think were worth ten or eleven thousand rupees. I had a crew of 21 men including myself of whom eight were divers and seven haulers and four assistant haulers and an apprentice. I do not know if any were drowned as I saved my children and put them on diving boat. Two sailing ships which were near there came up and lowered their sails and picked up some sailors. These ships had been sailing in the same direction as us and were behind us. There were also some boats that were going before us, but they did not turn back as the wind was high. Our boat was smashed to pieces and the pieces floated. We swam off naked and everything we had was lost. \ The air was quite clear when we first saw the ship and there was no fog of any kind. We had been out there for diving and that was the reason of our being out at sea. All this happened today. I and another came to Bahrain on 112.8-29 Read over admitted correct. on the ship, and all the other or some of the others swam to the other ships. Our ship v/as lifted up on the side of the steamer* It never slowed up before the accident. I dont know whether the steamer anchored or not as I was shivering with fear. I think it did not, as it seemed to have turned round. I dont know how long they took to put down their jollyboat, but when I had reached the other ship they pointed out to me that the steamer ha had put down its jollyboat. We all clung to the pieces until to the sailing boats came near/us. The sailing boats were about two hundred yards from the steamer and slightly behind us. Of course south west, and the steamer was on a westerly course. The bows hit us, and cut it in half. When we saw there was going to be co&amp;lision we all jumped overboard, and when I came up the ship bumped my face. I had my son aged 12 or 13 with me and my two nephews with me aged 15 and 12 or 13. The jollyboat belonged to the late Shukr bin Shukr and the goods in it were taken by me on credit. The cargo I had was simply to feed the crew on. I had not shown my pearls to any merchant. The valuation was my own. The food we had in the boat was worth 85/-. The jollyboat was worth 1300/- or 1400 rupees and about 24 Bhras the length of the bis. The steamer jollyboat did not take sailors off the sailing boats and they could not swim to it on account of the waves which would have been in their face. I left my son and nephews and swam to the jollyboat of the steamer, with this other man as I wanted to get to Bahrain and complain. The ship’s jollyboat were tired on account of the waves and could not go nearer to the sailing vessels.V 9 © I was on the boat when the accident occured yesterday mor ning an hour after sunrise. I was awake when it happened, l^hen we first saw the steamer it was far away, from here to the Eora (the telegraphs, about a mile). The steamer kept absolute straight on and did not swerve in its course. We were on a south westerly course, but I dont know what course the steamer was on. When we were about 150 yards away(distance pointed out in Court) I told the nakhuda and said f what about it ! and he said it was far and he (the Captain of the steamer) will be able to turn it from us, we cannot do it as the waves are very high. Then the ship hit our vessel near the mast and we all went down. We hit the bows of the steamer. We did not jump from the jolly- boat before it sank. The boat was broken to pieces and floated in fragments. All the cargo and money and pearls were lost. The cargo was rice and dates and wood and coffee an., other small things which we eat. I cant say what the value of the rations was. It was food for 21 men for 16 days. Five hundred rupees in cash was lost and the pearls which we cannot estimate exactly, but which I think were worth about 12 thousand rupees. It was a seven days catch, and the last two days we had taken two good pearls. The pearls were kept with the nakhuda in his box. The sailors had all seen them. They did not know the value of them, as they dont understand them. So far as I know the two pearling boats that came to our help picked up all except two men whom I did not see. I dont know what happened to them* I swam about till the steadier^s jollyboat picked me up from a pearling boat. I jumped into the sea and swam to the steamer*3 jollyboat. The others were afraid of the sea and so did not go too to the jollyboat* The jollyboat remained in the sea about twenty minutes. The sea was very rough and the waves were so strong that the crew were very tired when they reached the ship. It was difficult for the ship to pick us up, and they had to turn to do it. We never changed our course, as we could not go to right f Dulaim son of Abdul Hadi of Muharraq states on s.a. or- 2 - or left on account of the waves, before the accident* le did not let down our sail because we thought we should pass the steamer before it reached our course* We estimated the pearls at 12000/- rupees but that is an estimate* No merchant has seen them or made an offer for them* Head over and admitted correct. 13-8-29 Sd/- C.O.Prior* f); ■19 * Captain Arthur Danbrook, Commanding S.S*Bandra, states on s#a* At 6*4 a.m* on the 12th August the vessel was steaming on a westerly course towards Bahrein# At 5#30 a#m# we ran into a large pearling fleet most of which was sailing on southerly course. Several were heading towards the west apparently bound for Bahrain. The course had been altered several times to pass under the stern of crossing boats and somewhere about 6 a.m. I had altered the course to pass under the stem of a boat bound south. Fine on my bow at the time of altering the course was sailing boat heading westward, and also numerous other boats heading south on my star board hand# Just as I had cleared the vessel for which I had altered the course, the boat that was heading to the westward suddenly swung round and headed towards my bows# Owing to the proximity of other boats on my starboard hand 1 had no alternative but to put the helm hard astarooard. The vessel did not answer her helm very quickly probally owing to the heavy beam wind and sea. When she did swing round I was so close to the other boat that a collision was unavoidable he having made no effort to alter his course or get out of the road# I at once put the engine full astern to take the way off the ship, and within a minute the boat crashed on my starboard bow. It seemed to me that we struck it a glancing blow, but itd^ is impossible to say exactly how we struck it. The men in the boat appeared to have lost their heads and sometime before the vessel struck had all leapt clear into the water. By the time we struck the boat the way was practically off the ship and the emergency boat was got ready, the engines having already been stopped. The enia engines had been stopped a second or two before the impact. On arrival near the wreckage, the crew vho were all clinging to the wreckage all refused to come on to our boat with the exception of two men, and they were taken off by pearling vessels in the viwe vicinity. As far I could ascertain everybody was picked up* I have no idea why these men would not come onr on to the ships boat# After seeing that all in the vicinity had been picked up the emergency boat returned to the ship seeing that nothing further could be done, and the voyage was continued# The position of the ship at fh- time of the accident was in latitude 26*25 M and 51#2 E. The time of the impact was 6#4 a#m* and by the time I picked up the boat and was on my course again it was 7.15 a.m. ?0ien I left the wreck it was afloat and the deck was awash# The mast had come down* I think some of the cargo might have been recovered but there was a big sea running and I could not get my boat nearer as there was danger# The crew would have time to remove any small objects on deck. They all jumped clear before the impact, but returned and clung to it until the other dhows came up when they swam off. The depth was about 6 fathoms. I had the anchor on the bottom while the emergency boat was away, just enough to keep the ship from drifting. There v^ere so many boats about I could use the engines. At 5.52 the engines had been rung to stand my below. This was because I was a bit doubtful of my position. At 6.2 a.m. the engines were rang full speed astern. At 6#3.a#m. the engines were rung to stop. At the raoment of impact I think my speed would have been about 5 knots# I was in charge of the bridge at the time. The chief officer was in the chart room working out observations# He came out after we had struck and he went to get the boat away# The boat actually left the ship f s side at 6*10. The men who were saved did not report any injury# A number of life buoys were thrown over at the time of the accident. Head over and admitted correct.

It was about 6.5 a.a* I was at the compass when I saw the boat about 200 yards away. The captain told me to f Iijao Ghikar* which mean to..put the helm hard starboard. The sailing boat made no attempt to alter course but came straight for us* They could have avoided us had they ported their helm, but they did not so so. I did not see them at the point or time of impact. After the accident I saw that their boat though damaged was not sunk but was awash. I could not say whether they were clinging to the wreck or not.

I was in my bunk when the accident occurred, I was called by the bridge chokra and went to the bridge when Captain ordered me to take away the emergency boat and pick up survivors. About 6.15, but I glanced at the bridge clock when I went on the bridge and it was about 6,10. I headed the boat for the wreck. There were bits of wreckage about but the boat was just awash, the top of it being just visible. When I arrived there were about three men clinging sitting on top of the boat, on the deck which was awash* X cant say what the size was. The men made no attempt to save anything from the boat. I noticed about three other men in the water, and I called to them but they refused my assistance and prefersed to make to the pearling boats, I cant say why. There was only one which was near enough to pick up anybody and the next nearest one would have been about a quarter of a mile away. I asked the two men who swain from the wreck to us if they knew if everybody had been picked up. They did not understand me very well; I did not go to the boat which had picked some up for on account of the sea running it would have been dangerous. I searched the wreckage and found nothing* I first of all had three men and then one jumped overboard and swam to the dhow. I picked up one of the ships lifebuoys and decided to return to the ship* Me returned without incident at about 7 a.m.. I was confident that nobody was left in the v/ater who could have been picked up. Head over and admitted correct. S&amp;/~ C.6.Prior, P.A.Bahrain 13*6-29.

It appears that the Captain of the 'Bandra' is under suspension at Bombay pending the conclusion of the case. 3. I would also be glad to know, what instructions I should give the owner of the dhow, when he again refers to the question of compensation. There is no doubt that Bombay is the most suitable place for the Court to assemble, but it for will be a great hardship ta/the woner of the craft to go there and present his case. Perhaps, since it is so much in their interests to have the Court held at Bombay, the British India Steam Navigation Company would allow the dhow owner and his witness or witnesses to travel the^ without charge. 4. I enclose, in original, some statements made at Bombay by certain members of the crew. It will be noticed that the 3rd Officer made no mention in his statement before me of the incident referred to in paras 3 and 4 of Purshottam Morar T s statement and paras 4 and 5 of Tindal Bhagwan Laloo’s statement. 1 ^ Political Agent, Bahrain. ^5«r'V^7 111 L tVjr '' .. v - ; e . • \j Zi'J u J-l) and In the matter of a pearler he longing to the late Shnlir bin f Inner surd: off Bali rain.
