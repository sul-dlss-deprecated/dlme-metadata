The request made for supply of hydrogen is more difficult as there are transport difficulties in the way of supply of gas in cylinders.

I am to state that, according to the decisions of the Partition Council, the Governments of India and Pakistan are agreeable to maintaining such of these stations as may still be required by H.M. Government ? until it is possible for them to be taken over by the U.K. Meteorological Service. 3 . I am to say that of these former Indian operated meteorolo gical stations, only those at Bahrein and Sharjah are considered to be carrying out functions for the United Kingdom. There is, however, already a U. K. meteorological station at Bahrein, and so far as this Department is concerned, there is no need for the former Indian station to continue in operation. A. As regards Sharjah, it is anticipated that it v/ill be possible to open a station there by about September 1948, and I am therefore to request that the Pakistan Government may be asked t continue to operate this station until the U. K. Meteorological Service is able to take over. I am.

Both these stations are at present filling a require ment of the R.A.F* and B.O.A.G* At Bahrein there is an Air Ministry Meteorological Station which is now being equipped to make regular radio-sonde observations of conditions in the upper air. It is understood that when these observations start in the fairly near future, the Indian Meteorological Department will withdraw thrill station from Bahrein. P V a MINISTRY, King Charles Street, Whitehall, S.W.1. 24th June, 1947* In the case of Sharjah, we have recently agreed to a request from H.Q., Mediterranean and Middle East that in view of the reduced R.A.F* commitments at Sharjah, the responsibility of providing weather reports should be transferred to the Indian observing station* The Director General of the Indian Meteorological Department has agreed to this step. If, later, the Indian station were closed, the Air Ministry would have to open a new station at Sharjah. I am sending a copy of this letter to Jones and Pyman* Yours sincerely. [.w* LOW) King Charles Street/ COfa'IDE-m D.O.No.947-S 'BlKRAXK, thf J7th May 1947. ihiMp BEaiDEHCY, LIS, It has come to my notice that e are observatories of the Indian Meteorological Uepartmenf at Bahrain and Sharjah. The number of personnel in each observatory is five and they are subordinate to the Director, Regional Meteorological Centre, Karachi. I have nothing on my records about the establishment of these observatories or their original object but I understand that the one at Bahrain has been in existence for 20 years. 2. I understand that the B.O.A.C. make use of these observatories both at Bahrain and Sharjah. There are also R.A.F. observatories in both these stations and there is therefore a certain amount of overlapping. I am told it is possible that the R.A.F. observatory at Sharjah will shortly be closed down. The one at Bahrain however is to be maintained and will shortly be in a position to supply the same services as the Indian observatory here. I enclose a statement prepared by the Observer in charge of the Bahrain observatory explaining its activities. 3. I am reporting this matter to you as with the transfer of control of the Persian Gulf administration to His Majesty*s Government it will have to be decided whether the Government of India should be asked to continue to maintain these observatories or not. I have no very strong views on the subject and know nothing about its technical side but am inclined to recommend that H.M.G. should take over responsibility for the maintenance of observatories at Bahrain and Sharjah and that the Indian observatories should be withdrawn on the understanding that the Government of India will be supplied with such meteorological reports from the Gulf as they require. 4. I am not sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India in case the suggestions I have made in the last paragraph are not acceptable to H.M.G. If opportunity offers I propose to mention during my forthcoming visit to Delhi that the future of these Indian observatories remains to be decided. • •' -'B* P.

In an official letter, reference number as above, dated 27th February, 1935, the India Office informed us that the Director General of Observatories had noted that no allowance haa been made for cooking facilities for the Observers to be stationed at the Rest House at Sharjah. Phis letter is to let you know that information has been received from the Chief Engineer, Royal Air Force, Iraq, that separate cooking accommodation for Hindus and Muslims has now been completed. Would you please arrange for the Government of India to be informed by telegram as suggested in their letter of the 19th February, 1935, which was forwarded under cover of the India Office letter quoted above.

LONDON Accommodation for the Indian Meteorological Staff in the rest house at Sharjah* Sir With reference to Mr. Walton f s letter No. P.2.7784/34^ dated the 21st December L934, I am directed to say that the D-».rectorKi-eneral of Observatories has pointed out that the plan of the quarters for the Indian Meteorological Staff at Sharjah, a copy of which was received from the Air Kead~ quarters, Hinaidi, does not show whether there is a fire* 1 place in any of the rooms. Of the five rooms provided, three are intended for the three Observers, one will be used as an office and one as a store room. There thus appear to be no arrangements Tor the Observers to cook their food, and the Director General has accordingly suggested that either small fire-places for cooking may be made in three of the rooms, or it for any reason cooking is not allowed within the fort, two special small cook-rooms, one for Hindus and one for Muslims, should be set up for the Observers alongside the fort wall and well within the barbed wire. 2. As regards the opening of the station at Sharjah, the Director General is of opinion that the need of transfer from Muscat to Sharjah is not so urgent as to require the Observers to go until it is known that the rooms are ready andfc&gt; @ and the cooking arrangements complete; hut that as soon as he receives an intimation that all is ready he would arrange for the transfer of the Observers with the minimum delay* I am therefore to request that the Air Ministry may be asked to make the necessary cooking arrangements as suggested by the Director General and the Government of India informed by telegram when this has been done* am to add that the Government of India accept the arrangement about rent suggested in paragraph 3 of the Air r, s letter of the 19th December 1934* I have the honour to be.

The Council note that in India Office telegram dated 27th July to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf it was intimated that the cost of the provision of the accommodation viz., £700, would be recoverable from the Sheikh of Sharjah by the usual method of withholding the rent of Rs.300 a month due to him under the agreement.. The Political Resident considers, however, that the Sheikh, who regards the cost of the Rest House as unduly high, is likely to object to any expenditure which will have the effect of putting off still further the time when he hopes to receive rent. 3. I am to state in this connection for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that the intention the Council wished to convey in Air Ministry letter to your depart ment dated 20th July last 191562/32/P.W. was that they were prepared to regard the accommodation in question as an addition to the Rest House for which the Sheikh would not be called upon to pay. The rental payable by the Government of India for the accommodation would, of course, accrue to Air Votes. 4.

The Air Council propos e that the accommodation for the Indian Meteorological Staff should form an integral part of the rest house, and that the Indian Meteorological Department, which has indicated its willingness to pay a suitable rental, should be charged £70 per annum for the accommodation provided. In reply I am to request you to inform the Air Council that My Lords sanction these proposals and the consequent increase in the total estimate of the service from £15,000 to £18,000 on the understanding that - (a) any additional expenditure drring the current year is met from savings under the subhead or the Vote, and (b) the Air Council are assured, after consultation u' in m with the £ olitioal Resident in the Persian Gulf that • ' '* their proposals in regard to the provision of accommodation for the Indian Meteorological Staff are* ♦ * not contrary to the Agreement of 22nd July, 1932, with thevFheikh of Shargah and that .the,rent in respect of such accommodation will be payable to your Department and not to the Sheikh for such time as the tenancy of the Rest House continues. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) R.V. HIND HOPKINS.COPY. 0 191562/32/F.7. 7th June, 1934. Sir, 1 am commanded by the Air Council to refer to the Part I Item Ko.3 of Subhead D of Air 'Vote 8 for 1934, Expendi ture on Arabian Coast section of the Egypt-India Route, which was opened in 1932 primarily for the construction of a landing ground and rest house at Shargah, and to ash that the following information be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury. Their Lordships are aware of the considerations which led to the transfer of the air route to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf and to the establishing of a landing ground at Shargah, but the details of the arrangements made with the Sheikh of Shargah for the provision of the necessary facilities there have not been formally communicated to them and are therefore detailed below:- The agreement which has been concluded with the Sheikh provides for (a) a rent to be paid for the air station of Rs.800 a month. (b) a personal subsidy to be paid to the Sheikh for the protection of the air station of Rs.500 a month, (c) payment to be made to the Sheikh in respect of guards supplied for the protection of the air station. 2 head guards © Rs.40 a month, 35 guards ® Rs.20 a month. (d) a landing fee of Rs.5 to be paid for each civil aircraft using the aerodrome, (e) a rent of Rs300 a month to be paid for the rest house. The Council's original intention was that the rest house should be constructed at the cost of, and remain the property of, the Department, but the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf represented that if ownership of the property were allowed to remain with the Sheikh his apprehensions that the establishment of the air station would involve the loss of his independence would be allayed and it would be possible to pro ceed more speedily and economically with the construction of the station and rest house. He further represented that although he realised that a tenancy for an indefinite period, determinable only at the option of the Department was desirable, a lease of 11 years with an option to renew, was the longest term which he considered the Sheikh could be prevailed upon to grant, though he had little doubt that such an arrangement would, when the Sheikh's immediate apprehensions had been allayed, provide satisfactorily for the permanent retention of the rest house, should this be desired. The/ The Secretary, H.M.Treasury, S..7.1.The Sheikh was not in a position to finance the construction of the building and it was accordingly provided in the Agreement that sums should be advanced by His Majesty's ^Government for the work of construction, that doors, windows, steel framing and fittings should be provided free, and that payments of the monthly rental for the rest house should not commence until the amounts advanced for the work of construction should have been covered by the amount of rent due. In accordance with the terras of this Agreement the work of constructing trie rest house has been completed at a cost of £9,500, of which £5,300 is in respect of advances made to the Sheikh, or payments made through the Political Resident for materials purchased on his behalf. The latter sum will, in due course, be recouped by with holding the rental payments of Rs.300 a month, though the operation will involve an extension of the lease to cover a period of approximately 20 years. The Council are, however, satisfied that the difficulty of obtaining a reasonably secure footing on the Trucial Coast in the face of the keen opposition of the Sheikh's own relatives and neighbouring chiefs rendered it impossible to obtain better terms. There remain to be provided, however, certain improvements to the accommodation and certain defensive measures as detailed below, which the Council re^Q-rd as essential for the safety and security of the service. (a) Generating Plant £3,500 (b) Floodlights, defence lights, and obstruction lights £2,000 ( c) Bulk petrol installation £ 550 (d) 7/a ter Supply and Distillation Plant £1,000 (e) Accommodation for Indian Meteorological Staff £ 700 (f) Minor improvements to accommo dation including strengthening of defence wiring and con tingencies ^ 25Q £8,000 Items (a) &amp; (b) &amp; (f) are already in hand. as regards item (c), the existing arrangements of storage in tins and drums are unsatisfactory in that they present a considerable fire risk, particularly in the event of attack, and it is proposed to provide underground tanks, those provided by the Company on Persian territory having been rendered unserviceable in consequence of the transfer oi the mute • The question of water supply at dhargah has given the Council much concern. At present the supply is obtained by donkey-carrier from wells two miles away, where the risx of/ * -3- , contamination is very great, both in the wells and from the containers in which it is carried. Some supplies are obtained by boat from Bombay, but to ensure an adequate supply by this ^method would entail the provision of a tank barge, the capital and annual maintenance costs of which would be higher than that of the distillation plant and storage tanks now proposed. The Meteorological requirements along the Persian Gulf have been met at the cost of the Indian Meteorological Service and that Department has indicated its willingness to pay a suitable rental for accommodation provided at Shargah, Having regard to the fact that for defence purposes the accommo dation must be within the walls of the rest house, the Council are of opinion that the necessary accommodation should be pro- , vided as an integral part of the Rest House being erected at the Sheikh's ultimate expense, and that a rental of £70 a year 11 (lO/o of the cost of construction) should be assessed for its use by the Indian Meteorological Service. Apirt from services at Shargah, the new works services involved in the transfer to the Arabian side of the Gulf con sist only of the installation of the //.T. equipment at Bahrein and the provision of a control line to the aerodrome, the cosu of which is not expected to exceed £500 in all. The total cost of the above services amounts, however, to £18,000 and I am accordingly to ask that you will be good enough to move Their Lordships to sanction the necessary increase in the approved total estimate for the Part I Item concerned to that figure.
