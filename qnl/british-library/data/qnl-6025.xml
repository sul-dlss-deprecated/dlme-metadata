Kuwait , Dated the 1st July, 1948 # To. The Secretary to His Excellency the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain . Subject:- Financial Adviser to His Highness the Shaikh. MEMORANDUM: A copy of a letter dated the 16th June, 1948 received by this Agency from the Regional Manager of the Ottoman Bank, Baghdad, is enclosed. 2. It is not known whether His Highness made any approach to Major Tandy on the matter under reference, but in spite of the very large dollar sums which have now come into his possession on the signing of the Neutral Zone Concession, he has made no further mention of expert advice regarding investments. It is also understood that no approach has been made to Mr. Kilinartin on this subject, but should such advice be sought, there is no reason why Mr. Kilinartin should not be able to give it very adequately, unless it is considered that His Highness would be more Impressed by the opinion of outside experts.

I consider Tandy's action in suggesting to Schooling that he should approach the Shaikh through Abdulla Mullah on the subject of the investment of his surplus funds most ill-judged especially as it is our object to persuade the Shaikh to accept a permanent British adviser for financial matters of this nature. Please request the Ottoman Bank as politely as you can to disregard anything Tandy may have said on the subject and take no further action. Andrew, Esquire, Political Agent, KUWAIT •LB'D.O.No.M/16 The Political Agency, ^ Kuwait * Dated the 24th July, 1948. My dear Mr. Kenny, I am afraid that Major Tandy left no record behind of the conversation he had with Schooling while in Basra about financial advice to the Shaikh of Kuwait, which you mentioned to me in your letter of June 16th. 2. It would, of course, be very useful for the Shaikh to be able to turn to expert advice in the matter of his investments, particularly, as I mentioned to Jordan when I was up in Basra the other day, now that the sale of the Neutral Zone Concession has increased his wealth considerably: however, in the absence of any information, I cannot say whether Tandy approached Schooling at the request of the Shaikh or on his own initiative. I am inclined to think almost certainly the latter, as the Shaikh tends to adopt a rather independant attitude in his money matters: and this is a subject on which we cannot press him over much. I feel therefore that this is a matter which we shall have to wait for the Shaikh to raise himself, and meanwhile I will keep your comments in mind and let you know of any further developments.
