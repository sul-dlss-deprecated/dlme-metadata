I am of course not concerned with what is dome on the ’Irag portion of the road a.e. from £ubair to Safw&amp;i), but I absolutely agree with the Shaikh that none is necessary - or indeed of any use - on the Kuwait portion of the road. Unlike soae roads on which an escort would be worth anything, the danger on this road Is not fror* two or three robbers, but from large bands of raiders, and for them no escort short of an armoured car or two would be the slightest use.

I have enquired about this case from the Dhafir. The camel in question seems to have had a chequered career.) It was not stolen, 'but was raided from Araihdar a long time ago, at tne uime of Duwish 1 s /v raid on Jahrah, v/ith a grwat many other camels. The remainder were taken apparently 'by Ihn Mu’ammar, a man of Ihn Baud’s. I do not quite follow all this part of % the case, hut it is not really material. In any case, sucn camels as the Dhafir had were given hack, with the exception of this one, which ¥/as taken hy Mukhlif al Khufaij, a man of Bani Hussain. I take it that, in the Shaikh’s letter, Hussaini means a man of Bani Hussain, and refers to Mukhlif al Khufaij,/^ll this was about eight years ago. As .you know, two years ago a large portion &gt; — of the Dhafir went over to the Akhwan, including Mukhlif al Khufaij. He swri Shuraiyif last year, when camped in A - E Hajd with the Akhwan, came to Kuwait on a visit to &gt;^ Subah, Mukhlif being mounted on the disputed camel. ^ •! , They dismounted at Ibn Subhh’s Mudhif, ate his dinner ‘ | and stayed as his guests. The Dhafir allege that, when staying as guests of Ibn Subah, they were deprived of the disputed camel by the Shaikh, and told to go home on foot. This kind of thing is emphatically not done | amongst Arabs. A guest is a guest, even if he be found in possession of all one’s property. However, that fact | remains that Mukhlif al Khufaij set out to return to seized one of Ihn Suhah’s , Najd on foot, and on the way camels, and returned to Najd.2nd xhis year, a number of Bani Hussain returned from Hajd to Iraq, and amongst them Shilaxwih ash Shurayif. Shilaiwih, however, neither was in possession of the original disputed camel, nor is he now in possession of the camel taken from Ibn Subah, nor has he anything to do with the case, except that he accompab- ied Mukhlif i%!*i Khufaij to Kuwait on the journey, when the incident occurred. Mukhlif al Khufaij is still in Hajd, with Ibn Subah T s camel, where he is said to be camped with Hazza ibn Agab of the Dhafir. I am afraid that I cannot recover the camel from Najd. —-— ——~~ Incidentally, in the Shaikhs letter, the expression w the other day” should read last year. (b) . Your No. 247-S of 23th March, 1929. There was no question of stealing in this case, nor did the ts bearer of your letter make any such accusation^.. The two camels strayed from Araibdar, and arrived at the camps of the Dhafir, where they were kept by Ibn Badi until the owner arrived. The only trouble arose over a matter of fifteen rupees, which Ibn Badi claimed as expenses incurred in looking after the camels. The owner objected that there was no custom of paying expenses between Araibdar and the Dhafir. The Dhafir thereupon quoted the case of Dhahir ibn al Ihiraihi, (see your No.D.O. 538 of 8th March,) As Ibn Subah took expenses from this man, I did not feel in a position to tell the Dhafir that the taking of expenses was not allowed. In the end, I gave the Kuwaiti the fifteen rupees to give the Dhafir, from my own pocket, to get rid of him i there was no question of theft involved. ( c ) # Your No. 173-S of 17th March.

Administrative Xnspeotor in ohar c e Southern Desert of 'Iraq.Office of the Administrative Inspector In-charge Southern d q ^^ Sulman, dated the 21st Ap /7 Dear Your Djtf.O.No. 291-S of 15th April, 19S9. My No* D*0# 1075 of 18/4/29 seems to have crossed your above letter* In it, I answered most of your letters outstanding at the moment* The delay, as I pointed out, was due to the fact t^at I have been at Sulman and Baghdad the whole of this month, except for a three days visit to Safwan a few days ago* that Iraq tribesmen have 'stolen” various things from his followers, I feel that I must make a few remarks. In none of these cases have I yet discovered any evidence of evilful robbery at all* In the case referred to in your No*247-Sof me that there was no question of theft and that he never brought any such charge* out: (a) The incident occurred last year, not 'the other day'* . &gt; (b) Shilaiwih and A1 Khufaij were then living in Najd. and the latter retaliated by taking a camel from Ibn Subah. Shilaiwih had no camel and did not take one* (d) ^he case was one of 'wesqa', not theft* of theft* In this connection, I attach a cdipy of my No*/Y7^£/ have no power to make diplomatic protests to Ibn Subah, or to you, and I therefore send a copy of my letter privately* In this connection, I would point out that I think that ^nere cannot now be the least doubt that tne ^feaixh xiad a private Regarding the Shaikhs constant accusations 29th Marcfci for example, the owner of the camels himself told Agaii^, in your No* 254-S of 30/3/39, as I pointed (c) Ibn Subah took a camel from Mukhlif al Khufaij, In the numerous car cases, I do not find any case This is for your private information only. Iprivate understanding with the Akhwan, according to which ne helped them in various ways in return for immunity for his trihe from raiding. There is no further need of proof for this really, except the absolute immunity of Araibdar from attack thi s year, when the subjects of both the Iraq Government and Ibn Saud were being attacked right l and left. Both Ibn Hithlain and Ibn Shaqair’s raiding parties passed close to or even through the midst of Araibdar camps, without laying a hand on anything. Note also that, during the long period in which Ibn Hithlain was camped with his raiding party at Khabari Wadhha, Araibdar were grazing only a few miles from /him in the Minaqish Umm Rus area • Now the Akhwan did not spare Araihdar this yaar because/ they loved them* The weakness of the Kuwait tribes invites attack, and they have always, as you know, been the first victims in past years* But the Akhwan spared Araibdar because they were being useful, both in obtaining information from them, and in providing them with supplies, when both Ibn Saud and iraq were blockading them. I have only mentioned one side of the evidence here* Every informant from Najd, d including ) or three Mutair prisoners captured by us, state H that Ibn Subah and Araibdar were in alliance with Mutair. Indeed many men of Araibdar said the same. /frcfyCzChf Now I daresay that Ibn Subah, ijiir ■'% had a good deal to be said for him. Neither His Britannic Majesty’s Government nor Ibn Saud have ever really made a serious attempt to defend him, and he could, if he liked, have made a strong case for his right to look after himself as he thought best. Anyhow it was a typical piece of Arab Siasi. My point, however, is not to hold a moral tribunal on Ibn Subah, but merely to point out the facts of the situation. Now of course all the Iraq tribes were fully aware that Araibdar were allied to the Akhwan, and were acting as scouts and spies for them. At the same time, the daily expecting to be attacked. It is, I Iraq tribes were3rd. ^ j / fi/3 I think, therefore not surprising that their patrols and scouts were not always too polite to camelmen whom they found wandering about in the area in front of their camps, especially as most of these men spoke the dialect either of Mutair or Ajman, of which two tribes Araibdar chiefly consist As you are aware, in three cases car patrols disarmed such men. The object in these cases was not robbery but when they found a suspicious sata character, they took all his valueables. The object was to discourage these gentlemen from taking the air in observation points in front of our camps. If they were really harmless persons ( and probably equal if they were not) they could always complain to Ibn Subah and get their stuff back. As you will see from my letter No *10^(0 of HjH , enclosed, there was some reason for regarding Araibdar camelmen with suspicion. In all three cases where cars took property from such persons, the incident was reported to me and and the property handed in, except in the case of Nasir ibn Kubaih, who, however, readily admitted the fact and handed in the articles taken when asked about it by me. er When in your No.2313 of 27/3/29 , the petition states that he was robbed by some people in two cars, he was at least concealing part of the truth. iiHis rifle was taken by the police, who handed it in to me. The police were in uniform, so he cannot have failed to recognise them. Now it seems to me that, in producing these charges of robbery by Iraqis, Ibn Subah' is probably suffer ing from a guilty conscience vis-a-vis His Majesty's Govt. Anticipating a rap across the temehles, he thinks it well to get in first. Ibn Saud always acts on this principle. When he knows the Akhwan are going to raid, he always first slips in a vigourous protest against something we are alleged to have done. If he cannot find a suitable subject for a protest, he intents one. Then when the Akhwan raid, he turns round and says “Its all your fault. You began it. See my protest No. So and So.' I can only guess that Ibn Subah is tryingtrying the same game. Fearing that he may be asked why the Kuwait tribes are hostile to us, he wants to be in a position to say ' Please refer to my letters Nos. So and So, So and so and So and So. The Iraq tribes have been playing old Harry with Araihdar. I suspect that the alleged 'boat robberies are in the same category. It does not seem to me good enough to say that somebody was robbed, and presumably the offenders were Iraqis. Why did not the victims come along to us, if they really were robbed ? If they had a good case, I should have compensated them, even without finding the alleged offenders, as I have done twice within the last year to Kuwaitis who had plausible stories and swore to them. With the exception of the Dhafir, Iraq tribesmen are entirely different to Kuwaitis speak a different language, and wear different clothes. An infant in arms could tell them apart. There is no need to presume. The men must have been obviously Iraqis, if they were so at all. Regarding the camel case mentioned in ray No. 876 of 24th March, the affair is different. The police have been doing the investigations, and I must admit have been very 5 slow over it, owing to my being away almost ever since. I think they are waiting for one more statement. I hope to be^ ... able to send you a copy of the case, when I next visit Safwan in a few days. Reference your No. 290-S of 15th April, 1929, the bearer of the letter left it with armoured esrst and apparently returned to Kuwait without waiting to see me. I could not therefore assist him. I am sorry this letter has become so lengthy. Lt Col.

As reported the Administrative Inspector on 7 / 3 / 29 , met the scouts of Ibn Hit^lain’s raid a few miles south of Jal al Liyah. The Administrative Inspector stopped some distance from the unknown camelmen, whereupon the latter oegan to wave. One of their number advanced on foot. The Administrative Inspector thereupon sent forward a man on foot, to meet and cross-question the party. The man in question was of Bani Eussain section of the Dhafir, who owing to his intimate knowledge of Araibdar and the Kuwait area, had been taken by the Administrative Inspector as a guide• This interviewed the man who had come forward on loot from the party of camelmen. He proved to oe one Ammash Walad Jartham, of the Tawatha section of Araibdar. He iniormed the Administrative Inspector’s guide that the camelmen, wno nad halted a little way off were also Araibdar As the guide, when he returned, informed me that he knew Ammash personally and that he did belong to Araiodar. I drove on without paying any further attention to the party. Several repoite have since been received from agents and travellers to the effect that the scouts, when they rejoined Ibn Hithlain, reported that they had reconnoitre the camp of No. u A.C.C. at night, and that, on retiring south next day, they had first been overtaken by aircraft, which, however, disregarded them, and had then met the Administrative Inspector. My servant, also, who proceeded to Kuwait a little latter to do some shopping, was accorted in a coffee shop by some Kuwaitis, who told him that the party which we met were Ibn Hithlain’s scouts.qOHrifrlMTlAL.

Dhald^tn protested and said that the AJm.Cn would never tolerate his arrest and would certainly attack Fahd if he did not release him j 9 aMi&gt; but Fahd replied that if they did he would have him executed at once. Naif al-Hithlain Abul Kllab who was with Fahd sent word to the tribe of what had happened to Dhaidan and the 'AJman attacked Fahd's camp that night. Fahd kept his word and had Dhaidan killed but was killed himself almost immediately afterwards. The Hasa force was completely routed and over 1000 are said to have been killed.

How, however, we have obtained new and important particulars about this great battlei which we give briefly below. fhe number of the rebels who took part in the battle is estiaatea at one thousand eight hundred men of the ^taibah and Mutair. Ibn Hithlain and hip tribe had separated themselves from them before the battle. This was oeoause H.M.King ^odul ^ziz had sent envoys before ^commencement of the struggle advising people to desist from their iniquity ana wickedness, and to submit to the Judgement of Religious Law ; and many of them followed his advioe ana separated from tneir bretnren. The original number was estimated at five thousand ; so the number of those who seoeded before the battle was more than three thousand. A air Sa*ud was in command,and his brothers, uncles and other members of the Royal pa mi ly took part in the battle and fought hand to hand, for when the battle Joined both sides fought bravely and the struggle lasted for some hours, and ended with the defeat and flight of the rebels, whose casualties are estimated at one thousand two hundred killed. H.m. the King was in camp at a place not far from the battle field where he was kept constantly informed of the progress of event?, and issued dis instructions and orders. After tne battle he returned to Riyadh. Ibn Rubai*an, on© of the great Shaikhs of the ‘Utaibah, and in tne oattle and fought with the King's his followers, took parttroops who were fighting with Suitan tin flijaa (ion Hunaih); as also did several Shai.ths ana trioesnen of Mutair. Faisal ad-Dawisn's eon, Banner, was Killed and his eldest son 'Abdul 'Aziz, surrendered in tne end. it was he whom H.M. the King appointed as paramount ShaiKh of the totair this year in place of nis father, and who attended the Conference at Biyadn, but afterwards joined his father in his rebellion. He is now at Riyadh. Uteisal ad—Dawish himself was dangerously wounded and ^is now toeing treated at Artawiyan. H.M. t-he King would not allow the defeated retoelP to toe pursued after the end of the toattle, out ae ippued orderp tnat they were to be allowed to go wnere they liKed. Ion Bijad with soji© of hip followers is now encamped to the souj^h of Artawiyah, tout most of them nave submitted to the Government now that they have seen its power and strength. ‘Ihe townsmen of jtfajd fougnt witn great ora very in this battle and inflicted a heavy slaughter on tne rebellious I*hwan from whose conceit, vanity and oostin&amp;oy tney have sufferred so muoh; and they avenged themselves on tnose who have despised them and looked on them as inferior beings^ and have sometimes even dubbed them infidels. Tney seized this opportunity when it presented itself, and took vengeance on and punish those who had injured them. Those who Know Najd say that security will oe restored and the result of the battle of Sibilan will oe hailed with joy throughout all Hajd, as it will heal the gaping wound which has been distressing it. H.a. the King did all in his power to win over these rebels and to bring them bao* to the right path, but they thought his forbearance was due to weakness and fear tn.y persisted more and more in their vanity.

No. 309 of The donkeys, abah, and water skin were taken as stated. The offender was our old friend Dukhs^il al Rubais. (Your D.O. No. l«o-S of of 20th March, 1929). Who- taking the animals, he told the owner to give his respect to Ibn Subah, and say that he, Dukhil al Rubais, had take the stuff in lieu of his camel. From what various people have since told I gather that Ibn Subah, in this method of seizing raided or lost property, and giving it back to the owners without compensation to the persons in whose possession it is found^j is invoking the sharaj, tribal law. (See your No. l«o-S of 20th March, 1929). If this be the case, he is doubtless right — the shara* probably does prescribe the course which he adopts. The penal code would do the same, and probably also run in the man in whose possession the animals were fonad^, as a harbourer of stolen goods. Bedouin tribal custom, however, is quite different. All laws and customs, after all, are the automatic product of the needs of the society in which they are»in force. Bedouins have raided one another for count less centuries, and as a result camels change hands with lightening rapidity and frequency up and down the length a breadth of Arabia. At the same time, all camel tribes live by selling camels. If any man who recognised a camel as having once belonged to him, had the right to seize it by force although the man in whose possession he found it had bought it in good faith, all trade in camels would cease.

One find this at once when one begins buying Shamraar, th,„ r ,.„ 14 « a b , f „„ lha oy government from Jin.tz.h and no. bad in the Dh.fir are, with the police. The gist of all this is that the right to seize recognised' animals is not in accordance with tribal law, if the animal in question has been bought by the man in whose posoession it is found* This law is the becessary result of the bedouin mode of life* Outside persons or Governments may attempt to enforce civil or religious codes of law upon them, but it never works* Hence in Iraq all such cases are referred to tribal arbitrators and settled by their own customs* Bedouins are peculiarly tenacious of their customs, and, if they think themselves unjustly treated, they will not drop the matter. Even if they have to wait ten or twenty years, theynwill ultimately steal a camel back in lieu * of the one taken from them* The strongest of governments cannot always prevent this, and innumerable cases and disputes result. We have seen innumerable attempts made in Iraq to apply penal law to bedouins, and chaos was always the result* If the Shaikh therefore persists in trying to apply religious law or a law of his ov/n, to Iraq tribesmen, I foresee an innumerable crop of *wesqa M cases, similar to that of Dukhil al Bukais* I doubt, however, if the Shaikh will agree to settle these disputes by tribal customs* Should he do so, the parties could easily be sent to a neighbouring and neutral Shaikh. If not, could he not possibly arrange a compromise, such as was apparently done in the case referred to in your D#0. }fo• 197-S of 21st March, 1929. Even if he takes camels * '■ l OA-WaSMU eU'/fa/r. t/r . - * &lt; ^camels away by force in this manner, could he not arrange for the man in whose possession the animal is found, to receive some compensation, if he has bought the animal bona fide, as was apparently done in the case referred to above. I am less concerned in Dukhil's camel, than in the constantly K&amp;ceivxng outbreaks of wesqa which are likely to ensue. The man who brought your letter, Tarrad ibn Faraj, has received back his abah and water skin. The donkeys are out in the tribe but will be kept safe pending a final settlement. Col. More, D.S.O.
