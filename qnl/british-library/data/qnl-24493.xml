P art I.—GENERAL SUMMARY. 1.—OMAN-MASKAT COAST. The Report forming Part II of this compilation has been prepared by Captain F. G. Whyte. Its interest centres in the serious rebellion against the Sultan's power, accompanied by a treacherous attempt on his life, which occurred towards the close of the year, and of which an account is given in the report. The previous ten months of the year were not marked by any events of importance; and tranquillity, greater perhaps than is the normal lot of Oman, but tempered nevertheless by some of the usual inter-tribal feuds and aggressions, crenerally prevailed. Serious rioting took place at Mattrah in June between the Seedees employed by the Khojah traders and Baluchis. There was a sharp conflict also between the Beni-Riyam and Beni-Hina at Nezwah, in which manv were killed and wounded. In June a sad incident occurred in the death by suicide of Seyyid Eahad, younger brother of tbe Sultan. The motive for this unhappy act was ascribed to domestic and personal troubles. Uneasiness was caused during the last half of the year by Sheikh Saleh's movements and the rumours regarding his intentions; this influential Sheikh apparently acting quite independently of the Sultan's authority in arbitrating in inter-tribal quarrels and meeting out punishment. It was under his influence, as is supposed, that the tribes holding the passes into Oman proper closed them against all caravans about the beginning of November. The passes were shortly O re-opened; but there were, about this time, disquieting rumours of Sheikh Saleh's designs against Maskat. These were abundantly justified by the event • for there can be little doubt that he had long contemplated ^ the formid able attack which followed in February 1895. In this connection may be noted as significant, the return in May of Sheikhs Abdullah-bm-Saleh, Mohsin- bin-Amir, and Amir-bin-Salim, from Zanzibar, m the S. S. Avoca belonging to the Sultan of that place, with valuable gifts and marks of honour from His Highness. These three were actual leaders in the hostilities against Maskat, the first named being the son of Sheikh Saleh.6 administration report on the persian gulf political The year was marked by the establishment of a Vice.ConTuiateT~~fr French Republic at Maskat; Monsieur Paul Ottavi arriving on the 8th yj* I to assume the office. 0 vemoer Early m the year a high rise in the exchange value of Indian cooner own in relation to the dollar, leading to its extensive export, and the oonsem™ scarcity and general inconvenience thereby caused, induced His Hi^hn™ t n import machinery and set up a mint.

The enquiries are still proceeding. 3.—BAHREIN. Sheikh Esa, tbe Chief, suffered from a severe attack of small-pox, and was at one time dangerously ill. His recovery in June was hailed with marks of general rejoicing. Humours of a projected attack on Bahrein by Nasir-bin-Mubarik, the restless and intriguing menace to its peace, were revived in October. Such an attack could only be possible with the assent and support of Jasim-bin- Muhammad Thani, to whom a warning was accordingly addressed. Two years ago an acute panic was reported as having been caused by the rumoured threatening move of these two Sheikhs. In March an unfortunate quarrel arose between the Chief and the Al- bin-Ali, one of the tribes subordinate to him, owing to a somewhat violent act of the Chief's brother and an affray which took place afterwards. The tribe conceiving themselves aggrieved, removed in a body to the Katr coast opposite, where their leader. Sheikh Sultan-bin-Salamah, promptly entered into relations with Sheikh Jasim. The latter ostensibly made efforts to effect a reconciliation, and these failing—possibly their success never being really intended—the seceding tribe, with the countenance and support of Jasim resolved on a settlement at Zobara, a place claimed as a heieditaiy possession by Sheikh Esa, but which, as a matter of policy, and in order to obviate the claim of collisions on the mainland, he had been required to leave unoccupied. An alien settlement at Zobara would be a standing danger to Bahrein, leading to a constant repetition of the fears of attack such as those above referred to, and it was well known that it would on no account be permitted. It was evident, however, at the end of the year that there would be difficulty in arranging the matter. British Indian traders of Bahrein exporting dates from Katif to India have been subjected to great extortion during the last three years. Com- plaints were made in 1893 that R5,615 had been exacted over the treaty rate of 1 per cent, and, after a very long delay, the explanation was given by the Turkish authorities at Baghdad, that their customs system required the deposit of 7 per cent, over the treaty rate—such excess to be refunded on the production of certificates by the Turkish Consul in India, of the due arrival of consignments there. Meantime shipments for 1893 had been made on an excess payment of R9,719, and certificates in both these cases could not be produced, owing to the delay in intimating the necessity for such certificates. Excess duty to the extent of E4,174 was again exacted in 1894, and the certificates insisted upon being in this case produced, a fresh excuse for maintaining the extortion was found in a demand for the receipts xor the amounts originally paid. As receipts had been consistently refused, a tac of course perfectly known to the Customs authorities, the device has up to the present enabled them to resist refund of exaction, which, added to those for the two previous years, bring the total to over 1119,500. 4.—NEJD. In March Muhammad-ibn-Rashid having attacked and plundered the Aiman tribe near Sooloo, the headmen appealed to the Turkish Governor at El-Hasa, claiming protection as they paid taxes. The Governor ordered an expedition against Muhammad-ibn-Eashid; but tbe Commandant of the8 administration repollt on the persian gulf political forces refused to move without superior orders, and the Governor then to Muhammad-ibn-Rashid; the latter replied that his action had been inH interests of law and order as the Ajman were robbers. An interview, which Sheikh Jasim had requested, was declined 1 Muhammad-ibn -Rashid for fear of giving offence to .the Turkish Government 5,—'EL-HASA AND OJAIR. In April Saeed Pasha, the Mutaserrif of El-Hasa resigned, and Ibrahi Pasha, formerly of Ilodeida, was appointed in his place. 6.—EL-KATIF, A struggle was maintained almost throughout the year between the peo- pie and the authorities, in regard to the enhanced assessment of the date produce for export, caused by the fall in silver values, the injustice of the mode of assessment, and the exactions of the customs master. Two or three deputations proceeded to Basreh to appeal to the Wali in the matter, but though a commission was appointed to arrange the matter, the srievLnw remained unredressed. An appeal to the Supreme Government proving also unavailing, the mer- chants and others began to seek refuge at Bahrein, and in January 1895 the number of these refugees amounted to about 130, and a further exodus was reported in February. A demand for arrears of the duty for the two previous years, added to the general discontent, which was still further aggra vated by the high-handed exaction by the Turkish soldiery, of krans aUhe exchange rate of 5J for the dollar. Finally, in March 1895, the Governor of El-Hasa, while still refusing the concessions asked for, having, upon instructions from Basreh, promised a better arrangement for the ensuing year, and having also dismissed the tax collector, who had made himself obnoxious to the people at Katif, those who had taken refuge at Bahrein were induced to return. 7.—EL-KATE. In April 1894 the Assistant Kaim-Makam of El-Bidaa and his wife were murdered by two Turkish soldiers, at the instigation, as was afterwards alleged, of the Commandant. The murderers escaped to Wakrah but were afterwards arrested, and the Commander of the«Mujdo Ressan ' when off that coast, made an enquiry into the case and recorded the depositions of the soldiers tor transmission to Government. Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani resigned the Kaim-Makamship of Bl-Bidaa in August and proposed to appoint his brother Ahmed to the post. Jasim appeared to be somewhat disturbed at the delay in removing the relieved Turkish garrison of El-Bidaa after the new reliefs of 200 men had been landed m December. A quarrel between the Al-Ajman and Beni-Hajir tribes in October led T ? J 8 . 1 J , 0 a ' ;ei on some of the northern villages of the peninsula. Both tribes being dependents of Jasim, he exerted himself to effect a reoon- cihation. &lt; '' 0Se . 0 '' ' ,e y ear a prospect of troubles appeared on the west coast or Katr, owing to the emigration there, in a body, of the Albin-Ali tribe, who held themselves aggrieved by the Chief of Bahrein.

His Eoyal Highness the Hissam-es-SuUaneh was re-appointed to the Governor-Generalship before the close of the year 1893-94, and held it through out the past year. In March 1895, the Nizam-es-Sultaneh was nominated for the ensuing year. Luristan was in a very unsettled state, much disorder prevailed, and the road from Dizful to Koremahad was unsafe for caravans. Operations were carried on against the Direkwend Lurs by His Royal Highness Hishmet-ud- Howlah, who, in May, captured a large number of the tribe and deported them to Pusht -i-Kuh ; the Bakhtiaris assisted in these operations. The road, however, still remained unsafe, and caravans had to avoid it. The Bakhtiaris also were at feud with each other for a time, and robberies were committed on the road between Shuster and Dizful. The Chaab Arab tribes, who last year insisted on Sheikh Jafir Khan as their Governor, appear to have turned against him, and Sheikh Abdullah, who had been rejected by them, was re-appointed Governor, as the result of a movement in his favour. Difficulties, however, arose about the arrears of reve nue, and though a compromise was apparently effected, a combination was made against Sheikh Abdullah, and before the close of the year, his rival was re -appointed to the Governorship. There was trouble also at Howeizah, where the inhabitants rose in resent ment against the Military Commander. Again, in December, two sections of the Beni -Truf tribe were in hostile array, the one against the other, and the Prince Governor was obliged to proceed there, the matter not being settled till the fort held by one of the parties had been destroyed, with the help of the Government troops. Mutual aggressions were committed by the Arab tribes on the opposite side of the Perso -Turkish frontier near Howeizeh. The Arabs from the Persian side raided the districts over the border, in retaliation for alleged previous agressions, and it is said that complaint having been made to the Turkish authorities by their subjects, they advised their subjects again to retaliate. At any rate a raid was afterwards made from the Turkish side on the village of Buwarim. Complaints were made to Tehran by the Turks in connection with these matters and an official was deputed by the Governor-General to enquire into them. Sheikh Mizal, however, declared that the offenders on the Persian side were Turkish tribes residing over the border. A want of firm control exhibited itself at Bunder Nassery (Ahwaz), and relations between the Persian soldiery and Arab inhabitants were strained. On one occasion when the Muin-et-Tujjar's Agent endeavoured to enforce the landin 0, fees against certain boats with the help of the soldiers, a violent demon stration against him was made by the Arabs. The postal arrangements between Mohammerah and Shuster collapsed, owin^ to want of funds for payment of the service, and early in November the post office at Mohammerah was closed, communication with the interior being closed. Trade has been satisfactory, the export of wheat from the Karun,^ owing to a good harvest and low prices, increased. In imports, notwithstanding the diversion of a part of the transhipment trade for Koweit, and increased vigi lance against smuggling into Turkish territory, there has been a small increase. Messrs. Lynch maintained their service on the lower Karun and ran a steamer fortnightly between Mohammerah and Bunder Nassery (Ahwaz); at times a barge was also towed, when cargo sufficed. On the upper nver,^ the10 administration ilepoet ON the persian gulf political S.S. Shmhan managed by Messrs. Lynch on behalf of the Persian Government carried goods for Shuster. The buildings for the Company, which had so loJ been the subject of negotiation, bare been completed and occupied. 9.—FARS AND PERSIAN COAST. His Royal Highness Rukn-nd-Dowlab, brother of His Majesty the Shall who bad been appointed Governor-General of Fars in March 1894 held this hi.Hi' office throughout the year. The Kawam-ul-Mulk had at the same time been given the subordinate but still very important Governorship of Bushire and the Gulf ports. His Excellency did not, however, arrive at Bushire, the head quarters of bis charge, till the middle of July, the duties in the interval bein» carried on by Haji Mirza Abdullah Khan. ' Hie beginning of the year saw a revival of the vexatious and useless embargo on the export of wheat. The action taken was sudden ; it was unex- pec e .i so m view of the tact that the previously existing embargo had onlv been removed three months before ; indeed, everything connected with this mis- chievous measure was irregular, capricious, and uncertain. Difficulties at once arose in regard to stocks for export already purchased or contracted for and were not arranged without much trouble. British merchants protested and the newly appointed Governor, immediately on his arrival, sought our support in representations at Tehran against the measure on the ground of its use- lessness as regards its ostensible object-the relief of scarcity at Shiraz - winch the miserable state of the road and the cost of transport practically arrod, and the injury to the producers in view of the abundaQt harvest m the coast districts.

Scarcity and high prices generally prevailed, and distress was due not on y to the cost of food, but was at times acutely felt owing to the great difficulty in procurino- fuel, an evil which was increased by the high-handed interference of the soldiery, in securing the supplies entering the town, in the interests o certain dealers. j p Locusts appeared in April, committing great ravages and caused a further rise in the price of grain, though the injury done by them finally proved somewhat less serious than had at first been feared. At the close of the year, the reported discovery in several of the districts of large quantities of the eggs of these ravagers again raised the price of food-grains. , In the beginning of the winter, there was heavy rain, which did much harm to crops in the milder parts of the province. Abadeh, wlu ? h last J e ^ was reported to have suffered so severely, and which had been rebuilt, was so unfortunate as to be again much damaged by heavy rain. A heavy snowfall in January is said to have destroyed many houses in Shiraz, and added much to the distress by raising the prices of food and tue . A severe epidemic disease broke out in the summer among the cattle, horses, and mules Tn the districts abont Shiraz, and caused serious mortality. This combTned with the scarcity of fodder, high price of barley, and probaby n+hpr causes led to an unprecedented rise in the rate for tianspoit heU Shiraz and the coast. This of course added to the already effectual obstacles preventing any appreciable relief of scarcity inland by importing supplies fiom tbe 'obtervadiots for the telegraphic determination of longitudes, with the help of the cables and land lines of the Indo -European Telegraph, were con- ducted at liushire and Jask in connection with Karachi. 10.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND MEKRAN.

The year under report will be chiefly memorable for the rebellion which broke out in Maskat in February 1895, and which first declared itself in a treacher ous attack on the Sultan's palace, followed by an attempt to assassinate him. The rebellion, its causes, and its probable effect on the politics of Oman, have already formed the subject of an exhaustive report to the Government of India ; but its chief incidents are briefly related in the body of the narrative below. The poli tical history of Oman during the ten months preceding the rebellion, does not present many features of interest; nor are there many events of importance to record. recuru. A serious outbreak o£ hostilities iu the Semail valley, which, had it occur red would have prohahly entailed a general inter-tribal war, was threatened earlv in the year, the Ghafiri tribes having intimated to the Ahl-Boshar that thev would attack them after the Bed on April 8th. A sharp skirnnsh actually took place between the Hinawis who were supporting the Ahl-Boshar and the Ghafiris while small parties of the Ahl-Boshar were on several occasions attacked bv the Nidahiyeen, a section of the Ghafiri tribe. Further fighting was, how ever averted by the personal intervention of the Sultan, who succeeded in effecting a settlement of the differences between the tribes, and in inducing them to agree to a formal peace. In May, Sheikh Abdullah, son of Sheikh Saleh-biu-Ali, the Tamimeh of the Harth, Sheikh Mohsm-hin-Aamir Al-Harithi and Sheikh Amir-bin-Salim, one o the Sheikhs of the Beni-Boo Hassan, arrived at Muscat in the Sultan ot Zanzi bar's S S Avoca. It was stated that they had been on a visit to Zanzibar and had heen received with great honour by the Sultan, who besides other valuable gifts, had presented them with three field-pieces and a consLderable supply of gunpowder. Early in June there was serious rioting at Mattrah between some of the Seedee servants of the Khojah residents of that place aud a party of Ba uc is. The opposing factions twice met in conflict on the bc , aC .' Maskat rMfflpultv restored On the 20th of the same month the inhabitants ot . WOTe^reatfy shockedto learn that Seyyid Fahad, the younger brother of he Sultan had on the previous night committed suicide.

Towards the end of June wa reported that Sheikh HamoodAl-Jahafl. who has been for «any years a fruitful source of trouble to the ruling power in Oman, was endeavouring to excite dis. affection in the interior, and that it was his intention to head a rising against the Sultan. The report did not appear to gam much credence. ^ July was an uneventful month ; hut in August the Sultan received news of the murder of Sheikh Hilal -bin-Zahir of the Bem-Hina ^e by Seif-bm Hamad, the eldest son of the late Seyyid Hamad -bm -Seif -bin-Amir of the Boo-Said. who was Wali of Nezwah during the reign of Seyyid looikee.RESIDENCY AND MASKA.T POLITICAL AGENCY EOR THE TEAR 1894-95. 43 P ART IV.—TRADE EEPOB-T OE MASKAT. The statistics of Maskat trade for tlie official year 1894-95 are given in the accompanying returns. They have, as in previous years, been furnished by the customs farmer and their accuracy cannot be relied on. The total trade of the year is estimated to value $37,08,180 as against $37,75,326 for 1893-94, or a decrease of $67,146. This decrease is, however, entirely due to the reduced exportation and importation of specie, and it will be seen that after eliminating the figures for specie, the exports and imports exceed in value those of the preceding year by $62,854. The exports of the year, exclusive of specie, are valued at $11,28,580 showin- an increase of $8,260. Dates, limes, fruit, and small fish for manure are the' chief articles in which trade has been brisk and of which there has been a heavier exportation than in 1893-94. The value of imports exclusive of specie is returned at $18,54,600, the increase in this case amounting to $54,594. To this increase, the Persian Gulf and India are the chief contributors, the former with an augmented importa tion of wheat, salt, and ghee; while from the latter, rice, twist, and cummin seed have been brought into the country in largely increased quantities. There has, however, been a decrease in the value of the pearls arriving from the Persian Gulf, and a marked diminution of the import trade from Southern Arabia and Africa is noticeable ; pearls, mother-o'-pearl, and fire-arms being the articles in which business has been slack. The imports from the United States and Singapore have been heavier than in 1893-94. The customs were farmed by Seth Eiattansee Parshotam foi $1,15,000. J. E. WHYTE, E, B.

Owing to decrease in herds from the epidemic in the preceding year, there has only been enough ghee produced for local consumption. Imports. General. —Owing to an increase in dues charged, a large proportion of the goods formerly landed here for re-shipment to Koweit in Turkish Arabia, is said to be now landed at Bahrein; and increased vigilance on the part of the Turkish preventive service has stopped the smuggling of expensive articles, such as silk, into Turkish territory, which were formerly landed here. The increase in imports is therefore larger than is shown by the figures. This also accounts for it not having reached the total of 1892. Piece-goods. —The principal import is piece-goods in which there is a marked increase. A small amount of better quality chintz has this year been imported from Manchester. The cheaper qualities of Manchester goods can be bought and landed here from Bombay cheaper than direct from England, and as the freight direct is about the same as that from England to Bombay plus Bombay to Mohammerah, it appears that the large importers in Bombay must get a higher rate of discount from the manufacturers than is given on small consignments.

The statistics of Maskat trade for the official year 1894-95 are given in the accompanying returns. They have, as in previous years, been furnished by the customs farmer and their accuracy cannot be relied on. The total trade of the year is estimated to value $37,08,180 as against $37,75,326 for 1893-94, or a decrease of $67,146. This decrease is, however, entirely due to the reduced exportation and importation of specie, and it will be seen that after eliminatiug the figures for specie, the exports and imports exceed in value those of the preceding year by $62,854. The exports of the year, exclusive of specie, are valued at $11,28,580 showin 0, an increase of $8,260. Dates, limes, fruit, and small fish for manure are the chief articles in which trade has been brisk and of which there has been a heavier exportation than in 1893-94. The value of imports exclusive of specie is returned at $18,54,600, the increase in this case amounting to $54,594. To this increase, the Persian Gulf and India are the chief contributors, the former with an augmented importa tion of wheat, salt, and ghee; while from the latter, rice, twist, and cummin seed have been brought into the country in largely increased quantities. There has, however, been a decrease in the value of the pearls arriving from the Persian Gulf, and a marked diminution of the import trade from Southern Arabia and Africa is noticeable ; pearls, mother-o'-pearl, and fire-arms being the articles in which business has been slack. The imports from the United States and Singapore have been heavier than in 1893-94. The customs were farmed by Seth Rattansee Parshotam for $1,15,000. J. E. WHYTE, H, B.

Qeneral.'—Dw.rmg tlie year there has been a general increase in trade, due to increase in population and a good harvest. Wheat. —There has been an increase in the export of wheat and oil-seeds, and, in addition to the amount given in the appended tables, about 7,600 tons of wheat went to Basreh in river boats. There is still a large quantity to be shipped from the Karun district. j) a tes. —In addition to the dates shipped to India in British boats, a quan tity was shipped by foreign coasting vessels. Natural Froducis. —The decrease in natural products is due to the high freights and want of space in steamers to India owing to the large quantity of grain for shipment here and at Basreh, and natural products, such as bugloss and reeds, are being kept by shippers till the rates go down.

The increase in imports is therefore larger than is shown by the figures. This also accounts for it not having reached the total of 1892.

Metals. —In iron and copper there has been a decrease owing to overstock ing last year. No iron rods were imported. Sugar, —French loaf-sugar is being used largely and is taking the place of Mauritius sugar. Shipping. Shipping—sea. —During 1894 twelve steamers called with cargo from Europe against nine in lo93, and fifteen for cargo for Europe against four in the former year. Freight— London—'Yv&amp;ghi to London varied from 20 to 27 shillings and 6 pence per ton. The British India Steam Navigation Company called,weekly, and the Bom bay and Persia Steam Navigation Company about once in three weeks for and from Bombay and the Gulf ports. Freight—Bombay.—Yicwght from Bombay was about 10 shilings a ton and to Bombay varied from 2 to 14 shillings a ton. Mohammerah being between the large port of Basreh and the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, cargo is frequently shut out owing to lowness of the water on the bar. Only returns of vessels under the British flag are obtainable, and of steamers ; but the number of coasting vessels which called during the date season has been obtained. Karun Biver.—The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's Karun extension ran a steamer fortnightly to Bunder Nassery on the Xarun. She made some extra trips and at times towed a barge when more cargo offer ed. A steamer runs in connection with her weekly from Bucder Nasserv to Sheielia, 8 miles from Shushter, and the Nassery Company (Persian) also run a steamer between Bunder Nassery and Sheielia when cargo offers. Freight Shushter. —Freight Mohammerah to Nassery 10 shillings 5 pence per ton, and to Shuster 19 shillings 2^ pence per ton. Ispahan, Caravan rate Shushter to Ispahan about 15 shillings ner load of 350 pounds. 0 Agriculture. Wheat. The wheat harvest was good, and prices cheap—from 1 shilling 7 pence to 2 shillings 5 pence per cwt. Prospects for next harvest are also good, there having been unusually heavy rains, provided that rain occurs later in the season ; a larger amount of grain lias also been sown than last year. Dotes. The date crop was about the same as last year both in quantity and quality ; but there being little demand for the Bombay market, prices were cheap, being about 2 shillings per 160ib. Population. a . i T f! P T la I 10 ' 0 ! m p hammera h is now about 5,000 owing to migration of Ara )s rom urkish territory. The population of the neighbourhood is in- creasing from the same cause.

Tostal Service. —The Persian post offices at Mohammerah and Bunder Nassery having been closed, there is now no service to Shushter, and letters for that place must be sent to an agent in Mohammerah through the Indian post office here. B under N assery. At Bunder Nassery where a bazar was built by the Nassery Company, since the opening of the Karun, there are now about forty retail shops supply ing the neighbourhood for at least 30 miles round. Some twenty-two houses have been built by the traders who belong to Baghdad, Shushter, and Bushire, and are increasing in number. This is the centre of the wheat trade on the Karun ; but previously to the opening of the Karun there was only the Arab village of Ahwaz near this spot. Note. —Exchange is calculated at 50 kvans to the £1.iii APPENDIX B TO PART V. Conditions of Date Cultivation in Persian Arabia. Tenure, —The date gardens are held on payment of half the crop to the owner of the soil. When the dates are nearly ripe, an estimate of the crop is made by the employes of the Mnez-es-Sultaneh, who claims all land in the Mohammerah district, and the headman of the village, or of each group of gardens, is invited to guarantee half this estimate, which is always excessive. Some outsider generally offers to take the gardens on this estimate, and unless the headman for himself and the other date owners agree to this estimate, they are turned out of the gardens and of their houses until the crop is gathered, the man who has accepted, with his men, being put in in their place. To avoid this, the garden-owners generally guarantee an excessive crop, and it often happens that they have actually to buy dates to make up the land- lord^s estimated half crop. Consequently the fellahin take little care of the trees, and land is going out of cultivation. On the Turkish side of the river, though the tenure is on the same terms, it is differently carried out, There the crop is valued twice, once by the Government for the tax, and once by the landlord. The landlord arranges with each occupier separately; in the event of disputes, the occupier gets half of his valuation and the landlord the balance, and in no case is a stranger put in. This works well. Ownership of the land. —The Sheikh of Mohammerah claims and is in possession of the whole of the land in his district; but the Persian Government claim that the landlord belongs to the State. The Arab claim appears to be that the district is under Persian protection for which they pay tribute, and is not an integral part of Persia. The Chaab, according to their own histories, have only been in these parts since A.D. 1690. They have paid tribute regular ly to Persia since about A.D. 1763. The Sheikhs of the Muhesen tribe have been appointed Governors of Mohammerah district by the Persian Government for some forty years. Previ ously this district was under the hereditary Sheikh of the Chaab at Dorak-el-Fellahieh. Reclamation, —The reclamation of waste or new ground is as follows. The fellahin receive the land rent-free for a period of ten to fifteen years on the condition that they make the necessary dams and inigation canals and plant date trees to be in bearing at the expiration of the period. They plant corn, beans, roses, apples, melons, and flax, and make a fair profit; at the end of the period they can continue to occupy on condition of handing half the crop to the landlord. This reclamation is principally going on at Gusba of the Nessar tribe near the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. Opposite there,'at .Pao, on the Turkish side, the land has all been reclaimed on these terms, and most of the occupiers there were originally poor fellahin. Their sons to avoid the Turkish conscription are now taking up the waste ground at Gusba, and much land is now being reclaimed there. Conclusion. —The present crops could be at least doubled, and perhaps quadrupled, by the bringing of new or waste ground into cultivation, and the paying of more attention to the present trees. If planting were encouraged a crop could be obtained, on part of the ground reclaimed, after seven years of occupancy. Date trees do not make much progress while other crops are grown round them, as the roots require space; therefore it must be made to the interest of the planter to encourage the growth of the trees.
