No.C/S-Sl. URGENT . POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 8 th June, 1949. To V Jf Mr. All Bustani, Clerk-in-Charge, British Agency , Sharjah. Memorandum . I am sending herewith letters to all Trucial Shaikhs except Kalba. You should open one of them and read the contents most carefully. 2. You are familiar with the question of the pos sibility of drilling for oil in the land beneath the sea outside territorial waters. You know that at the moment, the sea beyond the 3 mile limit has never been claimed by anyone. The attached proclamations are intended to be a formal claim by the various Shaikhs to the sea-bed lying off their shores, yet outside the 3 mile limit. 3. Each Shaikh should take the following action. He should publish the attached proclamation in exactly the form in which it is given. He should also sign it. He may publish it either by reading it in open Majlis, or by displaying it in a public place. If this is done, His Majesty^ Government will recognise the sea-bed lying off his shores as being his by right. 4. The Shaikhs must issue their proclamations as follows: (a) Abu Dhabi : As soon as possible. You should hire any necessary transport to get down there within two days. You should inform the Medical Officer, Trucial Coast, that you will require the Ford Saloon on my instructions. Please go personally and promptly and ensure that Shaikh Shakhbut issues his proclamation immediately whilst you are still in Abu Dhabi. (h) Dubai : About 3 days after Abu Dhabi has issued their proclamation. (c) Shar.iah : 1 day after Dubai. (d) Umm ai Quwain, Has al Khaimah. Ajman : At your convenience during the next week. 5. Please report by telegram to me after each Shaikh has issued his proclamation. Ask them for a letter confirming this has been done. 6 . As these instructions are important, please ack nowledge receipt of this letter by sending me an immediate telegram as follows: To Political Bahrain ”Instructions received” Britagent. Political gent, Bahrain.POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 11th June, 1949 S.O.No.C/R-^O- Dear Sir Rupert, Sir Hugh Weightnan arrived this afternoon accompanied by Mr, Allen and Sa]eh al Mani* of Qatar. He informed that he had obtained the attached conditional concession from the Ruler of Qatar. His efforts in Abu Dhabi have sc far been unsuccessful. 2 . I have read through the concession and cannot find anything to which we might have exception. My comments are as follows: (a) Article 2 contains a declaration that the Shaikh regards the sea-bed beyond the three-mile limit as lying outside his existing concession. It also pro vides for arbitration under the P.C.L. concession if necessary. (b) Article 3 makes clear that the new concession does not include territorial waters. (c) Article 10. Sir Hugh Weightman informs me that in his view the only way in which his Company* s activities could be harmful to P.C.L. (see paragraph 3 of Foreign Office telegram No.297 of 21st May) would be if their installations on the shore interfered with P.C.L*s welfare. He does not consider that there could be any possibility of his own Company*s installations interfering with navigation and in any case he considers that such interference would be objectionable to His Majesty's Government also. He has therefore restricted himself to the provisions of Article 10. You may see him to rephras this slightly to give the guarantee of non-interference somewhat wider scope. (d) His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, &gt; ■: ,1 f Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.6 ^7 - 2 - (d) Article 20. You will notice that, in effect, the Shaikh requires a monopoly over all labour as I under stand is already the case with the labour employed by P.C.L. (e) Article 31. Sir Hugh tells me that in point of fact the Arabic text will prevail as he has been so requested by Shaikh Abdullah since the agreement was drafted. 3. The conditions laid down in Foreign Office telegram No.297 of 21st May appear to me satisfied and if you approve the agreement^Sir Hugh would like me to visit Qatar on Wednesday the 15th on which date he wishes to sign. 4. This copy is the only one in existence and he is anxious to receive it back and have it copied with any amendments which you may suggest as soon as possible.

We are sending a copy of the agreement to Your Excellency with our representative, Salih Al-Mani', who is accompanied by the above mentioned two gentlemen, so that they may show it to you and obtain your approval before it is finally signed.

Lermitte tells me that the Trucial Coast Rulers are so intimidated by the instructions they have re ceived that they are afraid to say what areas fall within existing concessions. 3. He would like me to tell the rulers that there is no objection to their saying if they wish that they consider the sea-bed areas covered by existing conces sions so that his company may receive such an assurance concerning their concessions. 4. Any such assurance would presumably, according to the last paragraph of Felly’s letter under reference, have to be submitted for approval before it was issued and in these circumstances I see no objection in v/riting as Lerraitte suggests.

In connexion with the sea-bed concessions I wrote to all the Shaikhdoms on July 10 last saying that if they considered that the existing oil con cession covered the submarine area they should inform me in writing. I enclose a copy of Arabic and English text of this note. 2. The replies received were varied and I enclose for your information copies in Arabic and English of those received from Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Umm al Quwain, Dubai and Ras al Khaimah and of two replies received from Sharjah. 3. As you will see the Abu Dhabi and Ras al Khaimah replies are quite satisfactory and although Dubai goes off the rails in the first sentence of the second para- . graph the error is corrected in the last paragraph. The Sharjah reply is inconclusive; Ajman and Umm al Quwain do not seem to have understood the point at issue. Would you therefore take an early opportunity of explaining the matter to these three Shaikhs and get a proper reply out of them? You will of course appreciate that we do not wish to influence them one way or the other. For your information I add that the point of the enquiry is so that we can tell P.C.L. exactly where they stand. Naturally any proposed fresh concessions would have to be referred to us for approval.

We received replies from Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Ras al Khaimah claiming that the sea-bed areas were not covered by existing concessions but no clear reply from Sharjah, Ajman or Umm al Quwain. 3. In the absence of a Political Officer on the Trucial Coast we did not pursue the matter with these three last Shaikhdoms.

If the Company have a claim to make then we shall have ours and we shall place the Company’s concession before the judging body for scrutiny, ''he Comnany is free to choose her way but the question of arbitration which you3p referred to should wait until such time as we deem appropriate to take up. usual Ending.* 1f ^ ' into/- British Agency, Confide ntial. Sharjah, Dated,2nd November,1949. D.O.No.982-0630 y Will you please refer to Jakins letter No.C/S 130 about the proposed arbitration over the Abu Dhabi sea-bed. 2. On 30th October, I spoke to Shaikh Shakhbut on the lines suggested by Jakins and handed him the revised translation. The Shaikh said that he replied to Jakins letter on 28th September 1949 and that he casually handed in his reply at one of the P.C.L,camps. There is, therefpre, every reason to suppose that this letter must have gone V altkiL *mJUL astray. He gave me, however, a copy -ef which a translation^ la-attached. 3. You will notice that his reply completely evades the issue. I asked the Shaikh what his real reason was for adopting this evasive attitude. He replied that he was trying to delay arbitration until such time as his finances allow him to face any sort of legal costs without fear. At present, he said, he could not guarantee to pay the fees of a King's Counsel as the Political Agent suggested. I gather that the Rs.400,000 loan made by P.C.L. in June of this year has largely been expended already on consolidating his position in Buraimi. I think also he is hoping that Superior Oil Company will eventually engage and pay his King's Counsel for him. He then said that he wished, at s the same time, to put to arbitration a number of other point in the concession. I asked him what points he had in mind, but he was unable to specify them. He said, however, that the concession was 'full of injustices'. T^is attitude on his part dates from the first visit of Sir Hugh in March /v 1949 and at that time, both Pelly and I had good reason to believe that Sir Hugh had deliberately, and with the authority of a former Government Servant, convincingly, putinto Shakhbut's mind the idea that the P.C.L. concession was a piece of trickery from beginning to end. 4* Lermitte has probably told you of the difficulties which the Abu Dhabi Shaikhs have been creating for the Company in their recent operations. Shakhbut has appointed a number of guard commanders to the camps in his territory, and at Ghanadha and Has Sadr, these men, (who try to affect the title of Emir after the model of the Saudi guard commander/in ARAMCO Camps), deliberately try to create trouble among the Abu Dhabi labourers. There have been numerous petty strikes over trivial issues. Apart from this, visits to the camps by the Ruler’s relatives often result in similar ill-feeling. Protests by the Company have only resulted in increased friction. 5. I have visited the three camps of the Company with Mr.Henderson, the Dubai Dubai Representative of P.C.L. and it is my impression that, whilst the strikes, on the whole, are the result of deliberate interference by the Shaikh’s guards, the standard of administration in the camps might well be improved. For example, the water distilling plants at Ras Sadr are unreliable and I think that the complaints about lack of water may have some foundation. Well water could easily be delivered in dhows if necessary. I learned that sufficient cooking utensils are only just arriving in camps which have been established for two months. I suggested to Mr. Henderson that he would strengthen the Company's position by looking to such points as food, water and living conditions. He replied that he had been asking for a Camp Administrative Officer to be sent to take charge, but that his company had not found him one as yet. 6. Hitherto, P.D.(T.C.) have been accustomed to dealing direct with the Trucial Coast Shaikhs on all matters except those requiring H.M.G’s intervention or sanction on some specific point. This practice was acceptable to all parties3 as long as the Company’s activities were limited to survey work, but Henderson agrees that the only hope*©f-l®P£Qy®d r'elatl'oris at present lies labour insisting tjn&amp;t akL^cpjo^iLaints of a major nature by either the Ruler or the Company, be made through the Political Officer, Trtucial Coast. T^is is a nuisance, in that the Agency is some 80 miles from the camps and some 100 miles from Abu Dhabi town, but in the interests of stopping trivial complaints and petty interference on the one hand, and of providing some sort of disinterested check on living conditions on the other, it is a procedure which I am bound to recommend. 7 . i propose, subject to your approval, to inform the Ruler firstly that the P.C.L.concession was made with H.M.G’s approval, and that H.M.G. is interested in ensuring that its terms are carried out by both sides. (The Shaikh has been trying tp propagate the story that because the Agreement bears no signature by H.M.G’s representative, it is purely a private document as between himself and P.C.L.). Secondly, I propose to tell him that all complaints or requests concerning the Company of anything but a routine nature should be made through the P.O.T.C. and that under no circumstances should his guards or relatives interfere with the operations in the various camps. I should be grateful for your instructions. J.A.F.Gethin, Esquire, H.B.M’s Political Agent, BAHRAIN.Translation of letter dated the 5th Bhul Hajjah 1368 (28-9-1949) from Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan# Ruler of Abu Hiabi# to the Political Agent# Bahrain. After Compliments. I acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 7th September 1949 equivalent to the 14th Dhul ^a f adah 1368 in which you stated that the Company wishes to go to arbitration and claims certain rights to the sea-bed. I write to inform you that there is no mention what soever of any type of sea-bed in the Agreement. A&amp; regards the Company^ statement that I sent no reply to the letters which they had sent to me on this subject until the expiry of the time allowed for the appointment of an arbitrator# this is against truth and facts. The Company and myself have the letters exchanged between us. I received from them a letter dated the 20th June 1949 corresponding to the 23rd Sha’aban 1368 and before the expiry of the limited time I sent them a reply and asked them to appoint an arbitrator for me in order to rank with them but my letter met no success until the 18th July 1949 corresponding to the 23rd Ramadhan 1368. This is the cause for the expiry of the period. If the Company compels me to enter into litigation with them it is certain that the place at which arbitration is to take place will be London. I will appoint as an arbitrator one of the advocates of the Courts of Justice and will be in direct contact with the proceedings and details of my case. Instead of the Company's claim to what I have (right to) I will claim from them my rights and will subject their Concession to examination and criticism without prejudice to both sides. The Company has rights and obligations and has to choose either this or that. The question of arbitration to which I refer is to be postponed until such time as I find appro- oriate for carrying out what is necessary.

J Dear Stobart, Your letter No.917-1325 of 17th October, 1949, regarding pearling off the Persian Coast. 2. Lorimer states at page 2241 of Volume I, part II: n All the banks of the Persian side, with the ex ception of the banks in the Lingah district which are public are subject to territorial jurisdiction; that is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that they are all near the coast, and in few, if any, cases .. V more than three miles distant from land.” ; . * 3. . Rogers of the Pastern Department goes on to say that 'the pearling banks referred to in Dredge's letter (which was a copy of yours first referred to) are s?id to be west of Lingah and it is not clear whether these are the banks referred to by Lorimer as 'public'. In view of Lorimer's statement, I feel we should ask you whether subjects of the Arab States claim to pearl on any of the banks on the Persian side as of right, without the consent of the local authorities, or whether they accept the position that they can only pearl there with the licence of the local authoriti 4 1 i know that on the Trucial Coast to get a clear reply to any question is practically impossible, but should be grateful if you could do your best to give me the material to reply to Rogers' query.

If asked, should I inform the Shaikhs that Smith represents Superior alone, or does he represent the 'International something or other 1 ' which has been formed in Ottowa out of Superior and Central Mining ?

I rather feel that too much interest in what is going on at this stage is both unnecessary and undignified and I am anxious to avoid the alarums and excursions of last spring which, as far as I can see, did nobody much good in the final analysis. 3.

(1325/2/2) British Agency, Sharjah, Please refer to your CAC-21 of 4th February regarding pearling rights off the Persian Coast. 2. The position appears to be as follows. The Persian Government does not agree to the Arabs pearling within their territorial waters, but the Trucial Coast pearlers use these banks after payment of unofficial dues to the local Shaikhs resident there. They do not, in any case, regard it as their right to pearl in Persian waters without payment, but they consider the local Persian Shaikhs rather than the Persian Government as the authority granting permission. Such payments are therefore in the form of a bribe rather than of a Government tax.
