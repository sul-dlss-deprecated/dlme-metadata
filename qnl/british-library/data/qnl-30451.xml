T# The Hon’ble the Political Hesldent in the Persian Uulf, Bushlre. Subjecti- Visit of French sloop 'Bougainville** to Muscat. Sir, With reference to my telegram No.43 of 6th February on the above subject, I have the honour to state as follows 2. On the 6th instant Saiyid Shahab, His Highness's f Representative, wrote a private chit to the Agency Dragoman ^ asking him to come and see him. The request was made for the purpose of translating the telegram, of which a copy is appended herewith, and of dictating a reply. 3. No suggestion was made by Saiyid Shahab of intimating the Political Agent of its contents. The Dragoman, on reflection, asked if there was any objection to a copy of the telegram being taken. He was permitted to do so in spite of the protest of Saiyid ^ilal, the Representative^ Secretary, that **no necessity arose** to inform the Political Agent. From the context of the telegram the fact that a French sloop intended visiting Muscat must have been known to the local authorities on 22nd January unless the letter, posted, in Bombay by the French Consul, was delivered by the Postal authorities direct to the Sultan in Bombay. In either case no intimation was conveyed to the Political Agent.- 2 - v 5* Admiral Rivet, commanding the French Naval Forces at Beyrout, regretted that he could not intimate the time of his arrival as he was unaware that W/T existed at Tnuscat* He made no allusion to preparatory arrangements ( for his visit, other than briefly stating that it ha^l been fixed up by the French Consul in Bombay* I gathered that he had not met the Buitan previous to his arrival in Muscat 6* Although a time was arranged mutually for the Admiral's call on the Sultan, no arrangement for his landing (in torrential rain) was maae by the State. The Agency whaler was fortunately handy and transhipped the Admiral and his staff to the Customs. Admiral Rivet commented on the State's lack of courtesy and expressed his warm thanks to the Political Agent when subsequently returning the latter's call. 7. No hospitality was extended by the Sultan or the State to the w Bougainville' but the Political Agent entertained the Admiral and his staff to dinner and preferred other hospitality to the ship's officers. Admital Rivet gave a lunch party on board to which the Political Agent, Medical Officer and American missionaries were invited, 8. The subsequent itinerary of the 'Bougainville' from Muscat was telegraphed to you and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian U ulf. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, /T.
