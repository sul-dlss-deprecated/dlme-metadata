Introductory Remarks. In last year's Report the different countries and districts with which the Resident in the Persian Gulf is brought into political connection were classed, and the various Offices and Agencies under his control, and also the names of the independent Arab Chieftains with the extent of their territories were noted. No changes have taken place in these respects except such as will be noticed under other headings in this Report.2 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The year may be said to have passed tranquilly, and with the exeeption of the re-occupation of Lahsa by the Turks and events preceding 1 it that took place in the vicinit}^ of Bahrein, but little of importance has occur red in the Gulf itself. Duty required the Resident's presence on the Oman Coast during 1 a great portion of the hot weather, and in the autumn an official tour was made to Bahrein, Bassidore, Lingah, and the ports of the Arab Coast by the Resident, accompanied by the 2nd Assistant Resident. The Civil Surgeon's Annual Report is submitted separately. Official Changes. Major Grant, the 1st Assistant Resident, left for England on the 8th May. Mr. Edwards has been acting as 1st Assistant Resident. Lieutenant E. A. Eraser as 2nd Assistant Resident since the 2nd September 1874. Royal Nary Vessels. The following Royal Navy Vessels served on the Gulf station and elsewhere for various periods. Circumstances necessitated the detention of the Magpie and Nimble for a long time on duty :— Her Majesty's corvette Briton. „ „ gun-boat Philomel. &gt;» &gt;9 „ Rifleman. » » „ Magpie, n „ Nimble. Disturbances on Tand. The mania for fighting that seems to possess the Arab mind in general appears to have lost none of its intensity among the warlike Chieftains of the tract of country on the western shores of the Gulf, and formerly known as the pirate coast, during the year under review. The limits of this Report however do not permit, nor indeed would the interest of the matter warrant, an account in detail of all the petty skirmishes and engagements, the night attacks, and plundering raids, that form the events of their guerilla-like system of warfare. It may be well to lemark here that the dissensions which occur owe their origin in most instances to pecuniary difficulties, whether arising out of claims for the price of blood of murdered kinsmen or dependents, for the resti tution of bankrupt refugees, for indemnification on account of miscel laneous losses, or other causes; and that when money is forthcoming no appeal to arms is made, always provided the cause of quarrel is such as to be capable of adjustment by pecuniary payment. During the year the Chiefs of Shargah, Ejman, and Ras -el-Khymah maintained alliance against a coalition consisting of the Rulers of Deb aye, Aboothabee, and Umm-el-K.eiwein, but though numerous expe ditions were undertaken by the leaders of the contending forces the bloodshed was trifling (as it is in all Arab battles compared with the numbers engaged) and the results unsatisfactory, for no side was everAND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1874-75. 3 al)lc to lay claim to victory; and if in one foray booty was acquired, the advantage was pretty sure to be counterbalanced by loss in the next. But the injury done to the commercial prosperity and general welfare ot the countries engaged in these incessant wars is deplorable. Just at present there is a cessation of hostilities, but the hitherto existing inimical attitude is maintained by all the belligerents, with the exception oi the Chieltains of Shargah and Umm-el-Keiwein, who are stated to have negotiated a truce. A temporary peace might be arranged among all the Chiefs if the Shargah Ruler would pay certain sums of money claimed by the Debaye Chief, for between these two exists a greater amount of ill-feeling than others. It is to be regretted that the friendly offices of the utish Agent and the Residency to procure an amicable adjustment of f icse differences have hitherto been unproductive of successful results. The Maritime Trnice. \\ ith reference to their relations with the British Government, the Chiefs have acted up to their trucial engagements, and no difficulty has been experienced in settling matters connected with the rights and pros perity of British subjects residing in their dominions. In the month of November the Resident visited the Arab Coast and had interviews with several of the Chieftains. A few minor cases of irregularities com mitted at sea have been satisfactorily disposed of, and it is clearly to be inferred from the general conduct and demeanour of the Arab Chiefs that they have no desire to deviate from the general policy laid down by Government. Such occasional irregularities as have occurred have not been of a nature to throw any doubt on this opinion. Past experience too has taught the Chiefs that the British Government, whilst avoiding unneces sary interference with their affairs, is able and ready, when the necessity occurs, to enforce Treaty obligations and suppress disorder and lawless aggressions in these waters. Weather and Winds. It is during the winter months that violent winds prevail in the Gulf. In summer the weather is usually fine with but very little or no rain, and the sea calm. At this season the pearl-fishery is carried on. But very few native craft have been wrecked during the year which has been remarkably free from strong gales and tempestuous weather. Bahrein. The state of affairs at Bahrein has of late occasioned a great deal of anxiety, and the continuous presence of a vessel of war in its waters has been deemed advisable. A resume of the events that occurred may not be out of place. The trade and wealth of Bahrein are centred in its two principal towns, Manameh and Mubarrak, and these places being desti tute of walls or fortifications, and the Chief, Shtykh Esau, having neither armed men in his service (beyond a small body-guard) nor mu nitions of war, they appear an easy and tempting prey to any wander ing horde of Bedouin robbers who may be able to obtain craft of light4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY draug-lit suitable to the shallow waters that surround the island, and then, landing- unobserved, to indulge in indiscriminate pillage. Hopes of thus easily enriching- themselves induced some of the lawless tribe of the Beni-Hajar to plan an attack on Bahrein during the past autumn when no English vessel of war lay in the harbour. Foiled in their first attempt when they embarked from the eastern coast of Guttur and put to sea, by the appearance of a vessel of the Bombay Marine which put a stop to the course of piracy they had commenced, as a sort of diver tissement on the way, they turned their attention towards an expedi tion by land from Zobarah and trusted, if successful in obtaining pos session of that fortress, to be able to elude the vigilance of English cruisers and take the unfortunate Bahreinees unawares. Zobarah how ever was occupied by tribes in alliance with the Chief of Bahrein, and the brave little garrison gallantly defended themselves against their assailants who were ultimately repulsed and completely routed. It is of course not absolutely certain whether these marauders, if they had ob tained possession of the position they coveted, would have ventured to attack territory under British protection so long as a vessel of war lay off the island, but it is undoubted that their presence there would have been a standing menace to the security of Bahrein and would have caused great inconvenience. This threatened invasion was a source of great disquietude and alarm to the Chief and his people, but when the attempt proved abortive and an English vessel of war appeared on the scene, they began to breathe more freely. Affairs have now assumed a more favourable aspect, but so long as bodies of lawless Bedouins remain on the adjacent mainland ever ready to avail themselves of an opportunity to cross over to the island, there can be no permanent security for Bah rein nor freedom from anxiety in the mind of its Ruler. It is a matter of regret that the resources of the country are not developed as fully as they could and would be under a firmer Ruler and more enlightened administration. • Coast from Kutr (Gultur) to the Shatt -el-A ^ab. No alteration has taken place in the status of these provinces which still remain under Turkish control and are occupied at points by Turkish troops. Persian Coast. A general description of this part of the country with partfculars regarding the form of Government existing, the names of the various Chiefs, and information concerning the extent of their territories, will be found in last year's Report. The serious notice taken of former irre gularities at sea has produced a marked beneficial effect. Hajee Jaber Khan, the Chief of Mahommerah, though according to report past 90 years of age, governs his district with all the vigour of youth, and his earnest endeavours to promote the welfare of his subjects afford a pleasing contrast to the stolid indifferance to all advancement which is characteristic of so many oriental rulers. The deepening of the Karoon River for the purpose of extending steam communication to Shuster, most desirable project as it undoubtedly is for expediting the transit of Central Persian produce which is now carried by the tediousAND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1874-75. and difficult route via Shiraz to Bushire, seems to be as far off inception as ever. A small river steam-boat plies for some distance up the river, but does not pay very well as the traffic is purely local. In Behbehan, Deshtestan, Congoon, Charek, Maghoo, and Bunder Abbass nothing- worthy of note has occurred. Lingah has a new Gov ernor in the young Ali bin Khaleefa, son of the late Chief Sheikh Kha- leefa, who died last October. Too young to take much on himself, he is necessarily guided by the advice of his father's councillors. Every thing has gone on satisfactorily at the British statipn of Bassidore on the Island of Kishm where Assistant Surgeon Abdool Raheem still resides. The health of the infantry detachment quartered there has been good. A coal depot is maintained, and Government vessels occasionally call to replenish stock. Town and district of Bushire. The town and district still remain under the charge of Prince Assad- Oollah Mirza, who is subordinate to the Governor-General of Fars. To wards the close of 1874 serious apprehensions were entertained owing to the unusual drought thnt famine would again make its appearance, and the Persian authorities at once imposed an interdict on the exportation of grain. Fortunately, however, rain came at last and all fears of scarcity have been allayed. During the summer the Governor repaired to the cooler climate of Shiraz, and the duties of his office were conducted during his absence by his son. In January Prince Assad-Oollah Mirza proceeded into the district on his annual tour to collect revenue. The relations of the Residency with the Prince both officially and socially have been most satisfactory, and his co-operation and support when necessary can always be relied on. At Bushire, as well as at other large towns, a ' Box of Justice' for the reception of petitions from all classes of the people has been established. The petitions deposited in it being transmitted direct to the Shah. It remains to be seen whether the results of this well meant measure will be eventually satisfactory. A still more popular measure adopted by the Shah's command at Bushire was the 1 1 ''' ' ' Bushire. abolition of octroi duty on fruit and vegetables at Postal. Postal arrangements are generally satisfactory, but the establish ment of a Post Office at Bahrein seems advisable. The mail steamers calling there only once a month has been found inconvenient. A weekly mail service has now been working for some time at most of the Gulf ports, and the increased facilities thereby afforded for correspond ence are duly appreciated. Slave-trade. There is no reason to doubt that the humane exertions of Govern ment towards the suppression of slave traffic have been attended with satisfactory results. Towards the close of 1874 a vessel carrying eight or ten slaves destined for one of the Persian Gulf ports was reported to ■6 administration report of the persian gulp political residency have secretly left Muscat. As yet no information lias been received regarding her, notwithstanding all the efforts that have been made to obtain information. Several copies of the anti-slavery proclamation have been furnished to the various British Agents; these have been posted m conspicuous places, and the widest publicity has been given to the orders of Government on this subject and the penalties attaching to their infringement. 0 R eport on trade op the P ersian G ulf for 1874. The report on trade for the year 1873 being intended as the first of a series was prefaced by some general remarks on the subject, which, so far as the circumstances arc unaltered^ need no repetition, x)uring the year 1S74 a weekly line of mail steamers commenced running between India and the Persian Gulf and Busrah; and although the direct line of steamers between London and Busrah was temporarily discontinued, this service is about to be re-established on an improved system by the British India Steam Navigation Company. The statistical information collected for the year 1874 will be found in a set of tabular statements of similar form to those submitted with Nos. i to 22. tlie last Annual Report with the addition of the ^contrasted Statenients w exhibiting the increase and decrease of imports and exports at the ports of 'Bushire and Bahrein as compared with those of the previous year. The memorandum on the subject of the opium trade of Persia No. 23. drawn up by Mr. G. Lucas, Uncovenanted Assistant Resident, which accompanies this Report, will be seen to contain interesting information on that subject. rht'ie has been a very marked falling* off in trade as regards the Persian Coast during the year under report. At the port of Bushire the decrease is shown in both imports and exports, and amounts to an aggregate of over eighteen lakhs of rupees. This decrease would have been still greater, but for the removal of the prohibition on the export of grain and increased exportation of opium. The Persian market is supposed to be still overstocked, and a further depression of trade may be expected. The harvests in the south have been but scanty, and though the return probably covers the outlay, it will scarcely do more. The same impediments to trade as were alluded to in the previous Report still exist in Southern Persia, except perhaps it may be allowed that the efforts of His Royal Highness the Governor-General of Ears have rendered the caravan roads in his province more secure than thev were. J The hopes that had been formed of reforms and innovations tending to develop the resources and improve the communication seem as regards the south of Persia, far from realization.

Opium is cultivated principally in \ ezd and Ispahan, and partly in the districts of Khorasan, Kerman, Fars and Shushter. The opium grown in Yezd is considered to be better than that in Ispahan and elsewhere, owing to the climate and soil of that place being better adapted for the growth of the drug. But the district of Yezd, notwithstanding the existence of a large cultivable area, is not capable of any considerable extension of the cultivation of opium, owing to the insufficiency of the means, both natural and artificial, of irrigation.AND MUSCAT TOLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1874-75. 27 •Ispahan, however, differs from Yezd in this latter respect, as it abounds in streams and rivers, and is capable of greater extension of the cultivation of the drug. But the cultivation of cotton and cereals takes up a large part of those resources and tends in no small degree to reduce the culture of opium. A few years ago the profits of the opium trade having attracted the attention of the Persians, almost all available or suitable ground in Yezd, Ispahan and elsewhere was utilized for the cultivation of opium to the exclusion of all cereals and other produce. It was then supposed by some that the opium cultivation would be indefinitely extended in Persia. But circumstances eventually showed that such could not be the case. The attempt of the natives to enrich themselves by cultivation and growth of a profitable article of trade and their neglect to provide for the necessaries of life, combined with drought and other circum stances, resulted in the famine of 1871-72. The costly experience then gained has made the Persians more care ful and provident, and they are now using a limited space for the cultivation of opium. The largest produce they had in Persia, a few years ago, did not exceed 2,600 cases. It has since been reduced to some 2,000 cases as shown in the accompanying table marked A. The quantity exported during last year, viz., between 1st January and 31st December 1874 was 2,002 cases as per annexed table marked B. Of this 583 cases were the produce of the crop of 1873-74 and 1,419 that of 1874-75. The probable export for the year 1874-75 is estimated at 2,030 cases as per Appendix marked C. The crop comes to hand in May and June, ^nd the great part of the opium finds its way at the shipping ports between September and January. The shipping ports are Bushire and Bunder Abbass. The whole produce of Ispahan and Fars is brought to Bushire. The produce of Khorasan and Kerman is taken to the Yezd market, and this together with that of Yezd itself are sent partly to Bushire aed partly to Bunder Abbass. The opium has hitherto been carried by English steamers running monthly between England and the Persian Gulf, The portion which is intended for China is transhipped at Suez on board the Peninsular and Oriental Company^s steamers. This route is selected in view to avoid the duty levied at British Indian ports. rr j t t.i « The exportation of opium from Persia dur- Vide Tabic B. . 1 -. oha i' n ing the year 1874 was as tollows:— To Hongkong, cases 1,339 and Singapore 80= ... ••• 1,419 To London ... ... ... Total 2.00228 administration ileport of the persian gulf political residency The Persian opium, it is said, is not much liked in China owing- to its having' a peculiar flavour caused by the mixture of a large quantity of oil during process of preparation, and owing also to its being some times found adulterated. It however finds a somewhat better market in London, inasmuch as it contains, on an average, a large quantity of morphia. The greater part of the Persian opium taken to London is thence sent to the Continent and to America. Prior to the opening of steam communication in the Persian Gulf some opium used to % be sent from Persia by land to Constantinople, vv hence it found its way to the Continent. But that route has since been altogether given up. About 100 cases of opium (in cakes) are brought annually to Persia from Herat. This is taken to the Yezd market. From Yezd also a quantity of opium prepared in the shape of small sticks or cylinders is sent for consumption in Herat. A small quantity of stick opium is consumed in Persia itself. No opium whatever is known to be imported into Persia from other places. (Sd.) G. Lucas, B ritish R esidency , B ushire, ''i Uncovenanted Assistant Resident Ike loth January 1875.
