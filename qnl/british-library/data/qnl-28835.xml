The Political Agent and H.B.M.Consul Muscat. G Sin, I beg to report to you as follows: The Norv/egian S.S.' , Dahpu' , ovmed by the Norwegian Govern ment, London, and commanded by the undersigned,arrived and anchored at Mus cat Cove at about 2,30 am.June the 28th. Authorities boarded at 6,00 am.and granted practique. Agent and Stevedores arrived shortly after and preparation for loading in No.2 and 3 hatches were made. At 8,05 am.the vessel shook severly and it was found that she was likely hit by a torpedo or other high explosive medium. The crew and coolies were* taken off at once both by ships own boats and crafts from shore,which,headed by your good self,came along side very shortly after the explosion. It was found that the vessel was apparently cut in two by the blast just aft of the Bridge Deck,having blown in the starboard ^ side in the way of No 3 and 4 hatches,tj)wn up the deck and mast and dei|Lcks in this way and scattering debris all over the vessel,harbour and on the houses and streets ashore. The after deck was soon completly submerged.Engine and Boiler rooms flooded overflowing into No. 2 hold. What there could be salved immediatly of ships equipment were effected by ships men and men from shore and landed. By 6,00 pm. the same day No 2 hold was flooded and ower- flowing into No.I hold.Ship was also broken,plates on bothe sides in the way of the funnel having cracked,amidship.The undersigned left the ship for the shore at 6,30 pm. the 28th.as no more could be done,ship going down rapidly also by the bow. At 9,20 it could be heard from the shore that the fore hold had been fcoded and ship had settled down. At 6,00 am.today I observed from the shore that the S.S. 'Dahpu n .was now completly submerged v/ith only pafcfc of the forecastle head, -^art of the houses amidship v/ith boat deck,foremast with derricks and fun nel shov/ing above water. I mentioned above'Hit by a torpedo M as the most likely cause on account of the terrific damage caused.In this respect I may also mention that a 'u' boat have been officialy reported south of Jask and. one might have sunk us by fireing from the Fisherman Rock or through the Gap. None of my crew have seen the torpedo or its wash,but one boatman claims to have seen it or the splash of it through the Gap. Thanking you for the immediate and valuable assistance rendered us and for attending the wounded I shall request you kindly to arrange with the Authorities concerned to guard the wreck,salve what can be salved in the interest of owners and underwriters. I I shall further ask you to inform the Ministry of war Transport of the dis|aster and through them my owners in London and Bombay. Regretting the heavy casualities I enclose herewith a list of missing,wounded and survivors and must also ask you to convey to the Sheik,my condolence to the bereaved families of the missing workmen, who number^ 35,1 am told.

Since sinking DdJIPU most likely form for aggression to take seems to be bombardment of Muscat by submarine in wnich case in addition to reassurance to Sultan safety Cable and V/irelees installation and lives and property British Indian arid British subjects have to be considered. Woulu therefore urge S.N.O.P.G. be asked to station man-of-war here capable % of competing with submarine.

The particulars asked for are as follows:- 1. Home Address.. C/o IAYASHA.NKER KACHRA Jam Khambatia, Khatiawar. 2 . Next of kin... I. Mrs. Kamla Pandya (wife) ^address as above.) 2 .

Members of the beareaved family... Wife and one child (girl) IJ, yrs old residing at Khatiawar Sister at Muscat. 3. When the previous compounder S.N.Gupta left the post and returned to India, I applied to the Civil Surgeon, Karachi for another man. This was in July 1942. Months passed and it looked as if no compounder was available at the salary offered, -^n the meanwhile Dr. Taqui had met Mr. P.D. Pandya and asked him if he would care to be trained as a compounder as the latter had no regular employment except the tallying work for the Landing Contractors. Mr. Pandya agreecibut as the pay offered was small he asked to be allowed to retain his previous job. As ships few and far between these days, I agreed. - When,however, Dollar Compensation was sanctioned I warned Mr. Pandya that he would have to give-up his tallying as the salary -i was sufficient with the new allowance. He agreed to do so but as he intended going on leave in August he asked that he should be permitted to carry-on till such time. As he had worked well and was a pain- -staking and intelligent lad I gave way to his request. Hence he was on board when the accident took place. ^ /Medical /Medical Officer Muscathhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhihhhhhhihi 0 TO FROM TO 1 ~ GRAY, MACKENZIE &amp; CO. LTD. Agents: B. 1. S. N. Co., Ltd.

Khan Sahib says according local customs it has always been fixed and paid in dollars. At today's rate of exchange dollars 400 amounts to rupees 948 and therefore our original recommendations do not appear excessive. II. Compensation to wounded. Medical officer has person ally examined them at their houses and reports:- (a) Husain Mahrook- complained of pain in right shoulder and left foot. No serious injuries were noticed. He is able to carry on normal duties. i (b) Ishaq Mohd (this man was not reported previpusly as he was noticed later) has a contusion of left ankle left wrist and back. None are serious. He is an elderly man and the injury to ankle will incapacitate him for about a month. Degree of disability twenty oer cent. Pashok Murad Ali is up and about and in spite of several efforts xf coolie contractor has failed report to medical officer.

It seems to 4 be an ideal little launch for purposes of service between ship and shore and if we ask the Norwegian Company, perhaps they may be able to sell it to us on a nominal price. Its maintenance should not cost us much as it appear s to be very strongly built and the engine seems quite good. Our own' launch driver could work on this also if we succeed in buying this. /L V?/&lt;j / 4. / .4 ^ LC4 r /t ^ ^ 4. /d-usY'</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000e2_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/451</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000e2</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/451</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 16/19 I The sinking of SS
