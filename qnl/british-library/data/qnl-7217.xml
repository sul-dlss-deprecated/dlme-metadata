As an introduction to this Prdcis it would be well to read the following reports which are printed as appendix to the Selections from State Papers re- ga^rding the East India Company's connection with the Persian Gulf, {1600- iSoo) :— (i) Report on the commerce of Arabia and Persia by Samuel Manesty and Harford Jones, 1790; {2) Report of Mr. Maister, Customs Master Bombay, and Mr. Fawcett, Accountant-General, Bombay, on the state of trade between India and Persia, 1 799; (3) Report of Captain Malcolm on the state of trade between India and Persia, 1800. For the history of the trade of the Persian Gulf from 1801 to 1872, we have no periodical, but only occasional, accounts in our records, the most exhaustive of which is contained in Lieutenant-Colonel Felly's Report on the Tribes, Trade etc., around the shores of the Persian Gulf, 1863, printed by the Foreign Department Press, Calcutta, in 1874. From 1873 the annual Administration Reports of the Persian Gulf Residency and Maskat Agency, furnish ample materials for a continuous and clear history of the Gulf trade. As regards Basrah and Baghdad we could secure the Consular reports of their trade only since 1895, These materials have been utilized in making out general statements and a review of the trade of the Gulf from 1873 t0 I 9 0 5* For want of regular returns for Baghdad on a scale of those of other ports, we have excluded the trade of that place from the review of the Gulf trade. A few notes on the Pearl Fisheries trade will be found in my Trucial Chiefs Pricis {1854-1905.) In regard to communications, the only chapter in this Precis is that dealing with the Telegraph line. An exhaustive history of the postal communications will be found in the Memorandum on the British Indian Post Offices in the Per- sian Gulf and Turkish Arabia, prepared by the Postal Department. Our recent political difficulties in connection with these post offices are treated in the Turkish Arabia Precis (1801-1905) and Persian Gulf Precis (1854-1905).

Regulations and Duties.PART I—CHAPTER I. CHAPTER I. Line of conduct to be pursued by the Resident at Basrah with regard to the American vessels trading to the Gulf of Persia—1803. The following opinion was recorded by Robert Percy Smith, Advocate General, Calcutta, in his letter dated 28th Secret and Political Department Diary No. 158 November 1803, On the above point: of 1804, page 2147. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter requiring by the direc tions of His Excellency the Most Noble the Governor-General in Council my opinion as to the line of conduct to be pursued by the Resident at Bussorah with regard to American vessels trading to the Gulf of Persia. It does not appear by the extract from the despatch of the Resident at Bussorah what is the nature of the trade in which he supposes that the American vessels visiting the Gulf may be engaged. The mere act of trading to the Gulf of Persia by a Foreigner is no infringement of the rights of the British Government in India. The ports of that Gulf are not part of the British Territories, the Resident at Bus sorah is no more than the Agent of the Company in the Dominions of the Foreign and altogether an independent State. The privileges of the Company beyond the limits of their own Territory are exclusive of the Trade of British subjects only, not of the trade of Foreigners. The American Treaty 1794 does not seem to me to apply to the question put thus p-enerally, by that Treaty the privilege of Trading directly to and from the Biitish Terri tories in India was conferred under certain restrictions upon the Americans^ but their right of Trading to and from those Ports of the East which do not fall under the description of British Territories is independent of that treaty and not at all affected by it. It is not improbable however that the Trade of which the Resident speaks may be an export trade carried on from the British Territories in India to the Gulf. Before the Treaty of 1794 an American conveying on such a '1 rade would have com mitted an offence against the Navigation Laws of England. His ships and goods engaged in the Trade might have been confiscated in any British Port or seized at sea by any ships bearing the King's Commission. All trade of this sort is expressly excepted from the indulgences granted to Ameri cans by that Treaty and that exception is noticed in the act of Parliament which was passed to sanction the Treaty. Reading the act and Treaty as a Lawyer I think they leave the trade in question subiect as it was to the penalties of the Navigation acts: and that the future regulations to be adopted by the contracting powers were intended not as substitutes for those penalties but as additional preventives of the trade. I cannot however say that it is impossible to understand them otherwise : how far where there is the least room for dispute. His Excellency in Council mav think fit to pro mote the strict execution of the Law against the Americans is matter of the political dis cretion. But supposing the right of confiscation still to exist, it is clear that seizures can only be made at sea bylhe King's ships and that they cannot be made at all in foreign ports without violating the territory of the sovereign to whom those Ports belong. I cannot therefore imarine any case in which the Resident at Bussorah would be called upon in the discharge of his ordinary duties to take any steps with regard to American vessels trading to the Gulf of Persia. Bv the act of 37 G. 3, the Court of Directors are empowered to regulate the trade of nations in amity with great Britain to and from the British territories in India. I have never understood that the Court has made any regulations under the authority of that act ; it any such exist they may possibly bear on this question and as I may frequently have occasion in the discharge of my official duties to consider questions cfthenature, I be^ leave respectfully to solicit His Excellency in Council that he will be pleased to duect that a copy of such Regulations (if any have been framed) may be communicated to me, I request, Sir, that you will do me the honour to report my opinion as above to His Excellency in Council. Copies of the above despatch were on the 25th instant ordered to be forward ed to the Resident at Basrah and also to the Resident at Bushire for their respect ive information and guidance. C163FDPART I—CHAPTER II. 3 CHAPTER II. Regulations for country ships visiting Bushire, 1813. When Mr. Bruce was in Bombay in 1813, he complained of the incon- Political Department Diary No, ^oo-i&lt;S/3. p.p. \6nienC0 CailS0cI by the Conduct of the 2732'2736. Bombay Castle, 8th September 1813. masters of COUOtry VCSSels that visited that Port arising from the want of some regulations for their guidance; and having been requested to submit what he conceived to be necessary to remedy the evil complained of, he formed the following draft Regulations to be observed by the commanders of ships and others visiting Bushire :— The Commanders of all ships and vessels with British passes or navigated by British subjects are immediately on their arrival to wait on the Resident with the manifest of the cargo and Port clearance from the last English Port; with a list containing the names and stations of his crew and also the names and descriptions of passengers if he should have any on board. а. No ship or vesssel is to leave the Port until the Commander shall have received a Certificate from the Resident that he has paid all the customary port charges, pilotage, etc., and conduct himself with propriety towards the natives and that neither the Govern ment or inhabitants have any legal claims against him. 3. Timely notice is also to be given to the Resident of the period fixed for the de parture of any ship or vessel in order that he may be enabled to have his dispatches ready for transmission by the time of her sailing and every Commander is to wait on the Resident for the purpose of receiving them with his port certificate, 4. All Commanders of ships or vessels are expected to convey, as is done from other ports in India, the Cape, St. Helena, and at England the Public Packets to and from the Gulfs of Persia and Arabia free of charge, provided they are not required to wait for them, in which case an allowance at a reasonable rate per diem, to be agreed upon by the Resident and the Commanders, according to the class of ship or vessel, will be allowed for the number of days the ship or vessel may be so detained, but it is at the same time to be understood that no such detention shall be enforced without the consent of the Commanders. 5. No Commander or any other Officer shall on any account abuse or ill-treat the Natives; and incase there should be any cause of complaint against them, the Commander is to be exhibited the charges against the offenders to the Resident, who will institute an enquiry into the case and see justice done to the parties. б. As no vessels are to be furnished with pilots from Carrack without receiving permission of the Resident, application is to be made to him for that purpose that he may procure the regular from the Governor of Bushire; but previous to receiving such order the amount of pilotage to and from Bussora, with one month's detention money must be lodged with the Resident, who will pass his receipt for the same, and on the return of the vessel from Bussora, the Resident will settle with the pilot, receiving from the Commander such amount as may be requisite or refunding such overplus as may remain. 7. The pilots are not to be ill-treated nor abused ; but should the Commanders have any cause of complaint against them they are to make the same known to the Resident, in order that he may represent the case to the Governor of Bushire ; that, if on enquiry the pilots should be found deserving of punishment, they may suffer such punishment as may be ordered to be inflicted. If any pilot sent on board should not appear to be sufficiently acquainted with thd navigation of the River or Hanks ; and be likely from ignorance, to expose the ship or vessel to risk, the Commander suspend him from his duty, but in doing this he is not as has too often been the case, to ill-treat or abuse him allow him to remain on board till his arrival at Bussora when he is to be sent on shore; on such occasions the pilot will only receive a portion of pilotage: viz. If suspended after entering the river one-half; and if previously thereto one third. 8. Commanders of ships and vessels are positively prohibited from receiving any Native Passenger without the written permission of the Governor of Bushire countersigned by the Resident, nor is he to take on board any British subject or Native of India as a passen ger or otherwise without the sanction of the Resident.PART I—CHAPTER II. 4 The following are the rates of pilotage at the port of Bushire Pilotage to and from Bussora ... ••• ••• 200 t iasters Kyn.

The preceding draft Regulations were approved by the Bombay Govern ment and were communicated to the Resident at Bushire, as regulations framed by Government and were also transmitted to the Governments of Bengal and Madras for the information and guidance of the Commanders of vessels visiting the Gulf of Persia from those Presidencies and made generally known also to this Presidency.(—Order dated 3rd September 1813.)PART I-CHAPTER III. 5 CHAPTER III. Rules for the guidance of British vessels visiting the Persian Gulf, 1831. By a notification dated 8th July 183T the Bombay Government issued rules for the guidance of vessels visiting the volume 118 of 1830 31. Persian Gulf,—which are printed below :— Political Department^ Government Advertisement, The Right Honourable the Governor in Council is pleased to publish for general information the folio-wing rules instituted for the guidance of British Vessels visiting the Persian Gulf and to announce that if the Commander of any such Vessel shall fail to conform to these rules he mil forfeit all claims to the interference or good offices of the British Political Officers in the Persian Gulf in his behalf. Rules for the guidance of vessels carrying a British Pass and Flag proceeding to the Persian Gulf. 1. On the arrival of a British Vessel in Bushire Roads an immediate report is to be made to the Resident in writing of the same together with the date of sailing from her original port, and any other she may have touched at on her Voyage. All packets and letters addressed to the Residency are to be forwarded along with the above report. 3. Three days previously to the date fixed for the departure of any British Vessel from Bushire a report in writing of the same is to be made to the Resident^ In the event of its not being the intention of the Commander to remain three days, this report is to be made on the day of arrival. 3. Previously to any British Vessels leaving Bushire a copy of the Manifest of the Cargo imported and one of the Cargo exported is to be furnished to the Resident. 4. In the event of a dispute arising between the Commander of any British Vessel and any of the Native Merchants of Bushire and both parties consenting to refer the matter to the Resident, the decision of that officer as to the most advisable method of arranging the disagreement is to be obligatory upon the Commander making the reference. 5. In the event of any complaints being made against the Commander or any of the crew of a British Vessel by any of the inhabitants of Bushire the Commander is to be guided by the opinion of the Resident as to the measures to be adopted in consequence. 6. In the event of any British Vessel purposing to touch at any of the ports on the Arabian Coast between Baska and the mouth of the River Euphrates an intimation of the same in writing is to be previously made to the Resident, and the Commander of the vessel is to be guided entirely by the Resident's opinion. 7. All British Vessels entering the Inner Roads of Bushire, to pay the established pilotage according to the rates sanctioned by the Government. 8. The Commanders of British Vessels to be guided by the Customs of the Port in respect to the receipt and delivery of Cargo. 9. The conveyance of the public packets from the Residency and giving a receipt for the same to be obligatory upon the Commanders of all British vessels visiting Bushire. By order of the Right Hon^ble the Governor in Council, Bombay Castle; 9th July 1831- J Chief Secretary, In 1842, the Resident enquired whether under the Commercial Treaty recently concluded between Great Britain Volume 56-1384 of 184a, page 205. an( j Persia, any alterations or additions should be made to the above rules. Mr. Sheil informed him that pending a reference to the Earl of Aberdeen, they should remain in force. What the result of this reference was our records do not show. The subsequent proceedings in compilation 151 of 1853 contain only an acknowledgment of receipt of copy of the correspondence from Bombay. C163FDPART I—CHAPTER IV. 7 CHAPTER IV. Duty on horses and mules : Export and Import Duties in Persia, 1822.23—1835-42. In a letter dated 2nd December 1822, addressed to the Governor of Bombay, Sheikh Abdul Rassul of Bushire stated that Volume 103 of 1823, page 120. ^ ^ een empowered by the Persian Gov ernment to levy a tax on all horses and mules exported from Bushire to India, but that he had not exercised this privilege in case of horses shipped by officers of the East India Company, at the cost of his own purse, inasmuch as the Persian Government took into account to his credit these duties as actually levied. The Sheikh, however, pretended to be Ignorant as to whether this exemption was authorized by the Government of Bombay and desired to know their wishes in the matter. The Resident at Bushire reported in March 1823, that the Sheikh of Bushirc had actually begun to levy a duty ibtd, page 24. o £ g rU p ees on export of horses, a duty which was quite new. The Resident protested against the exaction of the duty until instructions were received from the Bombay Government or Major Willock, the British representative at the Court of Tehran, to whom he had written. On the representations of the British Minister, the Shah issued a farman* • A tchison 's Treaties (1892), Volume X, page in July——August 1823, to the GoVemor- 38. General of Pars directing that ' with regard to horses and other property and goods belonging to British subjects, ^ no duties shall in future be levied except such as long established usages authorize.' , In 1842, Colonel Robertson asked Mr. I. A. Malcolm, an Armenian Mer chant of Bushire, to furnish him with statements of the then existing export duties on Persian horses and mtiles contrasted with those six years previously, as also of any increase of duty imposed on articles of Import and export since 1836, The memorandum submitted by Mr. Malcolm, dated 10th October 1842, is printed below:— I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 8th October, desiring me to furnish you with a statement of the present export duties on Persian horses and mules contrasted with those of six years ago ; as also of any increase of duty imposed ^ on Articles of import and export since 1836 either by the order of the Sheikh of Bushire with out the knowledge of higher authorities; or, by special sanction of the latter. In reply, I beg to state that, in 1836, the export duty on Persian horses and mules was usually charged at 13 Mahomed Shah Rupees each, which custom regularly continued up to 1839, when after the Resident's removal to Karrack, an enhanced duty of 50 Mahom ed Shah Rupees, by public sanction of the Government, imposed and charged at Shiraz on each Persian horse that was brought down here, over Fars, to be exported to India, but this was spared for those horses brought for exportation from the surrounding districts; and nothing beyond the established duty of 13 Mahomed Shah Rupees, was charged upon them, before last year when, in its latter end, few horses that were brought from the Districts and exported for India, the same enhanced duty imposed at Shiraz of 5° Mahomed Shah Rupees, was besides the 13 Mahomed Shah Rupees charged here upon each ; but whether by public sanction or approbation of High Authorities, or otherwise I cannot aver. No change has as yet taken place in this enhanced export duty on horses— with only this exception that, in the latter end of last September when some horses were brought from the Bushire Districts, and exported to India, in lieu of charging in cash the enhanced duty of 50 Mahomed Shah Rupees, only a security was taken from the Pro prietors to meet afterwards, the demand if it would be the order of the Governor of Fars that they ought to have paid the enhanced duty. The case was consequently submitted I believe to the notice of that Authority, but no reply has, as yet, been received here to that effect. With regard to mules exported for India no enhanced duty was ever charged, or intended to impose upon, until the latter end of December 1841 when I purchased mules for Captain Goodson of the Bark ' Ganges,' of the Isle of the Mauritius, and Noor Alia Khan, the Surhang attempted, although without success, to impose the above enhanced duty of the horse upon each mule too, the particulars of which, I have had the honour of bringing to your notice by my letters of the 4th and 26th February and of 7th March. I beg to add that when I purchased and exported mules on account of Captain Ginrin of 'La Navarin' in November 1839, I paid only the established export duty of 13 Mahomed Shah RupeesPART I—CHAPTER IV. 8 each. I beg also to observe that although if camels were exported occasionally from this Port before no export duty was ever paid for them ; yet last year when a couple of camels was exported for Batavia in the Dutch Ship ' Tonga Ton' the same export duty as on horses or mules {i .e., 13 Mahomed Shah Rupees) was charged upon each by the order of Sheikh Naser. I have further the honour to state, for your information, that since 4 or 5 years back when any ship or Buglow arrives in this Port from Bombay with Cargoes for Bussorah, but changing her intention of going hence to that Port herself, tranships her Cargo on board some other vessel, sailing direct to Bussorah, half duty is charged here by the Gov ernment on the same goods; which was not customary before the period above alluded to, neither the public sanction or approbation of the Authorities of Fars has appeared at Bushire to that effect. Since 1838 when the British Troops arrived at Karrack, this Government has been in the habit, without public sanction of High authorities, to charge duty on live stock—such as bullocks, sheep and goats that are occasionally supplied to the English ships—with only few exceptions that passed them through the influence of some Persian friends without paying any duty—or such vessels as have been under the command of an European (for instance the Dutch Ship 'Tonge Ton ' Captain Taunge, last year) which was not the case before the period mentioned above. No duty, however, was charged on any live stock supplied to the French 4&lt; Corvette ' that was here in January last under the command of Captain Page, With regard to import duties, only this change has occurred, that no import duty was ever charged for Firewoods landed here, about 5 or 6 years ago, but ever since a duty of 5 Mahomed Shah Rupees per 1 kara (or 10 Hmee maunds), is imposed upon not by any public sanction of the Firman Firma, so far as I understand. In conclusion, I would beg to request, that no Persian Authority may become to know such informations have been given out by me, for I should, from the situation I hold in this Government as a Merchant, apprehend consequences injurious to myself or my affairs. A question was raised by Mr. Malcolm whether when he purchased Horses or Mules for an English subject residing in India, or the Mauritius; or as an Agent for an English Captain present with his ship at this Port, he was to pay duty at the Custom House on the value of the animal according to the Commercial Treaty concluded between Great Britain and Persia, or, must he pay any arbitrary amount that the local Governors may think proper to impose. The Resident replied in his letter dated 24th September 184a as follows In reply to your letter of yesterday's date, I have the honour to inform you, that the Horses and Mules you may purchase for Subjects of the British Government, not in Persia, or for an English Captain of a Ship, present at Bushire, who embarks the horses and Mules on board his own, or another vessel (which 1 suppose is what you wish to know) are liable, by the terms of the late Commercial Treaty between Britain and Persia, to only the lowest rate of duty exacted by Persia from the Subjects of any other nation than Great Britain or, if the subjects of any other nation are permitted to export horses from your port, duty free, then a similar exemption from taxation can be claimed by you under the Treaty for your British Constituents, it being incumbent on you to prove, if required to do so, that the horses or Mules so exported by you, as a factor, are bond fide the property of British subjects.PART I— CHAPTER V. 9 CHAPTER V.

Resolution. —The Right Hon'ble the Governor General of India in Council having had before him the representations of Aga Kurbali Mahomed and also the Translation of two Petitions from the Captains of Arab Ships frequenting this Port ; representing the hardships and inconvenience they experience under the operation of the provision of Act No. XIV of this year whereby Arab Ships which were before admitted to entry at the Cus toms Houses of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal on the same footing, and subject to the same duties as vessels sailing under the British Flag, have been declared to be Foreign vessels subject to double duties like Foreign European vessels, remarks and resolves as follows. The principle adopted in the Act referred to, was to equalize the rates of taxation upon the trade of Europe, and upon that which was heretofore called the Country trade, that is, the trade with places within the Company's limits, and to pro vide by an increase of the duties upon the former, a compensation for some part of the loss suffered through the abandonment of Transit and Town Duties. In the application of this principle to the trade of Calcutta 3| per cent, was fixed as the general duty upon Imports and 3 per cent, as the duty upon Exports in British Bottoms, these rates being double upon Foreign trade, 2\ and 5 per cent, were the rates heretofore levied on the trade with Europe, British and Foreign, but the Country trade whether carried on in British vessels or in those of any Native State were subjected to the rates of the transit duty lariff, the lowest of which was 5 per cent, and many articles were taxed 7^ and 10 per cent. If the trade carried on in Arab vessels had been left on the same footing with that in British vessels, the Arab Merchants would have gained 'upon most articles, both of Import and Export, a reduction of duty in the difference between 5 per cent, the lowest former rate, and 3I or 3. As their trade in common with other Commerce had been relieved from all the vexations attending the levy of transit and town duties in the interior it was consi dered that the additional levy that would attend the placing of them upon the footing of European foreign nations would be more than compensated by this great advantage, but after the general scheme had been determined upon, several articles of the Country trade, including Coffee were placed in the Tariff assessed with the former rates of duty, that on coffee being fixed at 7^ per cent, and the principle upon which it had been deemed rot inequitable to treat Arab traders as foreigners, would evidently not warrant a duplica tion of this duty upon them so as to subject importations of Mocha Coffee to the high duty of 15 per cent, when brought in Arab Ships. His Lordship in Council accordingly resolves that Coffee imported from Arabia in Arab vessels shall be assessed at the same duty as heretofore, viz, 7^ per cent, the discriminative double duty being remitted in respect to this article. The Right Hon'ble the Governor of Bengal is authorized to give effect to this remis sion, His Lordship in Council cannot comply with the application of the Arab Merchants soliciting a general exemption from the discriminating duty on foreigners. It is true that in consequence of the difference of duty ships sailing under Arab colours will be subject ed to disadvantages relatively to those ownea by Native Subjects of the States sailing under British P,.sses and employed in the same trade and the latter will therefore obtain nearly all the freight unless a correspond ng difference should be established in the ports of India. C163FDPART I—CHAPTER V. 10 The measure may thus operate as an inducement to the Governments of Arabia to establish similar discriminating duties or it may lead to the transfer of Arab Ships to the ownership, nominal or real, of parties native or resident in the British Possessions and entitled therefore by existing rules to sail their vessels under British Passes. His Lordship in Council is not prepared to decide that the advantage that will thus be obtained by the subjects of the State over Arab Foreigners is unreasonable or impolitic; the question, how ever, deserves full consideration with reference to the facilities afforded by existing rules to the change of the flags under which vessels engaged in this trade have heretofore sailed. Preparatory to the further consideration of this question His Lordship in Council directs that a reference be made to the Government of Bombay with a view to obtain a communi cation of the sentiments of the Governor in Council upon the subject and in order that similar rules may be at once adopted on both sides of India. His Lordship in Council further desires to learn whether the trade with Arabia and the footing on which zesse/s and merchandize should reciprocally be treated, has ever been made matter of negotiation between the Government of Bombay and any States or Chiefs of Arabia. Ordered that a copy of the above resolution be transferred to the Political Department lor communication to the Bombay Government from that Department, and that the Politi cal considerations connected may be brought forward in that Department. (True Extract), H. T. PRINSEP, Secretary to Government. The Bombay Government having been asked to report on the point raised in the orders of the Government of India, they replied inviting attention to article X of the Treaty of 1820 signed by the Trucial Chiefs. That article is silent as to the rates of duties to be paid by vessels availing themselves of the liberty of trade granted thereby, but the Governor in Council was of opinion that any increase of duties beyond the amounts levied durino- the past 16 years would be deemed a grievance. It was also pointed out that the obiect of the treaty with the Arabs under date the 8th January 1820, was chiefly to pu^ an end to piracy and plunder and that its conditions were common to all the tribes and persons who would adhere to them, equally with those who ori^inallv subscribed to it. 4:1 ■' The Resident in the Gulf, Major Hennell, was at the same asked to state is'prmtedbeW^ 0 '' 1 m queStl0n ' His repI &gt;' ^ 44. dated i 5 th May 1637, I have had the honor to receive your ' e 'er No. 567 in this Department under date Residhncv Persian Gulf . ^ a [ c ^ transmittinor copy of Upon the subject of the rates of duties exacted , e I tt&lt; :. r0m t* 16 Secretary to the Government from Arab Vessels frequenting the Port of Calcutta, ol India with its enclosure, relative to the rates ing the Port of Calcutta, and directing me 0 to &lt;1 suT,Lrnw l cniniou 1 UDo' b the ?h ' PS frequent ' teraplated by the Government of India, with particular reference to S^r w r^k- 0 ™' Treaty with the friendly Arabs dated the 8th lanuarv t S- o j f u !

Notwithstanding a general belief that informer times a very extensive and flourish ing trade was carried on by the inhabitants Owing to the poverty of their countries tVie com- 0 £ ^]. ie Arabian Coast, yet it is unquestionable, mereial pursuits ot the Arabs of the Persian uult ., . . , ,J \ , 1 confined principally to the carrying trade. that since they have come more immediately under our notice, they have always appeared a poor people as far as their own immediate resources were concerned. Their country produced no articles of export, excepting the Pearls collected on the banks, and these are almost invariably disposed of to Banian, and other native merchants connected with houses in India, who reside in the principal Arabian seaports. With the produce of the Pearl Fishery they purchase dates, rice, grain, and similar necessaries of life, for which they are almost altogether dependent upon other lands, the productions of their own being quite insufficient for their consumption. It is evident therefore that almost all their commercial pursuits must necessarily be confined to the carrying for others, and it is in this occupation that the large vessels of Ras-el-Khymah, Shargah, Bahrein, and Koweit, are mostly employed. By a fortunate coincidence, the season of the Pearl Fishery, ^2'^., from May to October, is the period when, on The Pearl Fishery occupying them during the account of the monsoon, all native intercourse months of non-intercoutse with India. -i.! r j* • j j i •, , , , with India is suspended, and it may be remarked, that so deeply are the interests of the different tribes involved in the successful pro secution of this Fishery, that their usually turbulent and predatory spirit is much moderated and a very general desire for peace with each other is exhibited, during that period. On , , the termination of their employment upon the The trade find# employment for them during the 1 T)^„i r „ .1 ^ r^„ * „ j rett of the year. rearl Banks, the season tor renewed communi cation with India commences, and several hundreds of restless Arabs are engaged in the prosecution of voyages to and from that country, which, were it not for the occupation thus afforded by commercial pursuits, would ■ be driven by poverty, not less than by inclination, to a recurrence to their former habits of piracy and rapine. I would observe that exactly in proportion as the different Arabian Ports are engaged in commerce, in the same ratio is the exhibition of a predatory spirit diminished, as in the instances of Koweit, Bahrein and Ras-el-Khymah. 6. Having thus remarked that not alone the future welfare and civilization of the The welfare of the Arabs and our policy for the Maritime Arabs are deeply involved in their suppression of piracy would be seriously affected being able to find employment for their vessels were this Trade cut off. and men in the carrying Trade between India and the Gulf, but that the success of the policy we have so long and at so heavy an expense pursued for the suppression of piracy would also be materially affected, were this important branch of their occupation cut off, it is hardly necessary to point out, that the almost inevitable result of the proposed change in the duties will be eventually to transfer the commerce of this Gulf to vessels under British colors and passes, as indeed, is admitted by the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council in the enclosure accom panying Mr, Secretary McNaghten's letter. It is granted, that as long as the imports and exports remain confined to their own individual ports, that the establishment by the Governments of Arabia of equivalent discriminating duties, would in a great measure counterbalance the advantages gained by the British Vessels in being subjected to a lower rate of taxation in India, but this protection could not avail those employed in the carrying trade between Ports other than their own. On the whole therefore, with reference to the tribes inhabiting the shores of the Persian Gulf it would appear to rest for the consideration of the Right Honourable the Governor General of India, whether the advantages attending the establishment of an uniform rate of taxation upon all foreign bottoms without exception, together with an immediate, although comparatively speaking small increase either in the employment of tonnage belonging to the subjects of the estate, or in the amount of the duties realized, be sufficient to counterbalance the prospective evils which may arise to our political views for the permanent suppression of piracy, should the change proposed to be made in the rates of duties formerly levied upon Arab Vessels, be attended with the effects anticipated, of depriving the inhabitants of the Arabian Coast of so important a source of liveUhood and employment as the carrying trade. In respect to the second point adverted to by the Right Honourable the Governor . i n Council, viz., the long standing connexion anl c\Sn Ma'coi P ! nt0 y ^• Any - bet ween the Imam of Muscat and the British and Captain Malcolm give no exclusive privileges ^ T , , , to the Imam's subjects. uovernment, I beg to state, that I do not conceive His Highness can have any ground &gt;PART I—CHAPTER V. % 12 of complaint founded upon Treaty on account of Muscat vessels not being placed exactly upon the same footing, in respect to the duties levied upon them, as those belonging to our own subjects. In the coulnamah, or written assurance given by the late Imam of Muscat which was negotiated in 1798 by Mehdy Ally Khan, and subsequently confirmed by Captain Malcolm in 1800, no stipulation is made touching the footing upon which vessels and merchandize should reciprocally be treated, the only part of it referring to the subject of duties, is, in the seventh article, which among other concessions states, that the rates of duties to be levied at Bunderabass (Gombroon) on goods in buying and selling shall be on the same footing as at Bussorah and Bushire. 8.

On the 9th January 1839, the following notification was published by the Government of India:— &lt;s No. 88, Separate Department, Fort William, the 9th January 1839. 'Under the authority conveyed to the Governor General of India in Council 11 by Act No. XIV of 1837, it is hereby directed, that goods imported into the several Ports of the Presidency of Bombay, in the vessels of any of the ' States and Territories herein undermentioned, in which British Vessels are ' received and treated on terms as favorable as Native Vessels, and likewise ' goods exported from the Ports of Bombay in the Vessels of such States and ' territories, shall be treated and dealt with in all respects as goods imported and ' exported in British bottoms.

Ports in the Red sea belonging to the Ruler of Egypt, and ' 3, The dominions of the King of Ava. 11 By order of the Hon'ble the President in Council, (Sd.) H. T. PRINSEP, Secy, to the Govt, of India' This notification was re-published by the Bombay Government on the 2 1st February 1839, and on the 2Sth March 1846 it was also made applicable to the Government of Madras. In a letter dated the 28th August 1846 Captain Hamerton, Her Majesty's Consul at Zanzibar and the Hon'ble Company's Agent in the Dominions of the Imam of Muscat, reported that in order to prevent Boats trading with Ports in India, and other places, from unauthorisedly using His Highness' Flag, His Highness had determined that henceforth, Vessels of every description, belonging either to himself, or to his subjects, and sailing under his flag, should be pro vided with a Register or Pass signed by Captain Hamerton. In a letter dated 8th January 1847 from the Government of Madras, the Bombay Government were requested to inform that Government in what mode the notification alluded to in paragraph 1 was understood and acted upon under the Bombay Presidency. This reference Volume r ^ x of 1847. was made in consequence of Mr. Blane, the Collector of Kanara, having with reference to the recent resolution of His Highness the Imam of Maskat, requiring all vessels sailing under his flag to carry a pass signed by Captain Hamerton, expressed a doubt whether it was not intended that the provisions of the notification issued by the Government of India in January 1839, should apply only to Vessels belonging to Ports within the Dominions of His Highness. The Revenue Board at Madras however intimated to that Government that they considered the above notification admitted • 'to the privilege of British Bottoms, the Vessels of all the Ports of Arabia and tl of the Persian Gulf.' A reference having on the 13th February 1847, been made to Mr. Spooner, then Acting Collector of Customs, he stated that under the provisions of the notification alluded to, 'allgoods imported in Vessels from the Ports of Arabia 'and Persian Gulf were treated and dealt with in all respects as goods imported 'in British Bottoms' until the receipt of Captain Hamerton's letter above mentioned, ' since which time an examination of the passes and certificates 14 brought by the Vessels arriving from the said Ports has taken place, and only ' those Vessels producing registers according to the form (resolved upon by the ' Imam) have been treated as British Bottoms.'PART I—CHAPTER V. 16 The Collector of Customs evidently misunderstood the object of the recent alteration which by the wish of the Imam had been lately introduced, in regard to Vessels sailing under His Highness' Flag, which could in no way affect the notification of the Government of India, which declared that goods imported or exported in all vessels belonging to any of the Ports of Arabia and of the Persian Gulf should in all respects be treated as goods imported and exported in British Bottoms. Vessels therefore belonging to the Maritime Chiefs of Arabia, and the Persian Gulf, or their subjects, who were independent of the Imam oj Muscat, were entitled to the continuance to its full extent of the privilege con ferred upon them by the notification above mentioned—since their rights could not be affected by any order His Highness sees fit to issue as regards Vessels sailing under his own flag. This opinion was communicated to the Government of Madras in reply to their Secretary's letter of the 8th January, and also to the Collector of Customs, Bombay, for his guidance, any extra duties already levied being returned. It was also decided that in order to prevent fraud the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be asked to forward to Government a list of the Maritime Chiefs of Arabia, and in the Persian Gulf, who would come within the terms of the proclamation of 1839, and who either themselves, or their subjects, were in the habit of trading with the British Ports in India. The Governor in Council also thought it advisable that after a certain date, to be fixed by Major Hennell, Vessels belonging to all Ports under his Political control should be required to produce a Pass or Register signed by him, in the same way as Vessels sailing under the Imam's flag, are required to produce a pass from Captain Hamerton. These passes were to be declared to have effect for such period as Major Hennell might consider expedient, with reference to the distance from Bushire of the Chief, or his subject, in whose favor the pass ^as granted. t List of the Maritime Chiefs of Arabia and in the Persian Gulf trading with Bonthav who 'mil come within the notification issued by the Government of India under date the gth January 1S39.

Mode and extent of taxation in operation at Bushire and sur rounding districts, 1847. Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran having called for Information on the ' above subject, Lieutenant Kemball drew up the Memorandum which is printed below:— The Public Revenues of the Province of Pars, in all its Branches, would appear to be collected by the system of Ijareh or Farm. The Office of Farmer is usually given to the highest bidder, but where (as more particularly in the dis tricts bordering on the sea, occupied by distinct Tribes of remote Arab extraction) hereditary claims to the Appointment are considered, is continued in the family of the Chief, at a rate corresponding with the extent and supposed fertility of the soil. To this recognized Rent payable in Quarterly Instalments, must be added an Annual Donation termed Peshkesh, constituted by immemorial custom a regular charge payable at the New Year, the amount of which in the case of the hereditary Farmers, is, as a general rule, proportionate with that of the Rent; but, in every other, varies according to circumstances arising out of the number of candidates for the Office, or the amount of the highest offer. The Farmers of the district have it at their option in like manner to rent the villages under their control, of course upon their own responsibility; or to recover the taxes by the Ummul Kurd or Direct Levy. The former is the practice without exception in the districts of Bushire, the Sea Customs of the Port alone being collected by the Ummul Kurd ; and rather predominates too over the latter, in the extent of its adoption, in those of Sungistoon, Borazgoon, Dashtee, etc. Under this system of Ijareh the Districts of the Gurmiseer can hardly be considered rack rented, on the contrary were good faith preserved in the majority of cases, after liquidating the expense of collection (seasons of scarcity and the failure of crops from drought and other causes, for which no allowance is made, not considered) would confessedly yield a very fair Profit to the Renters. To their rates accordingly, as originally fixed, no objection has been made by the Chiefs, whose complaints and late undisguised opposition were levelled at the arbitrary exactions of additional Peshkesh, the systematic evasions and objections to bring disbursements to account, and, not least, at the mode now much in vogue of realizing the revenue, by issuing berats or orders upon the Farmers too often before the Instalments have fallen due, which, in its operation, proves grievous and oppressive—not only ontailing upon them the expense of the support and remuneration in the shape of fees (which however are believed to constitute their sole salary and emolument) of the Mubashirs, Muhussils and other function aries charged with them, or deputed on any special business; but by subjecting them, when the sum required is not immediately forthcoming, to their insolent and overbearing conduct, and even violence, for which, except in very flagrant instances, they can seldom obtain redress, and to mitigate or escape which, therefore, they are fain to have recourse to a series of douceurs, or rather to submit to illegal and extortionate demands significantly expressed by the term Kuk'oos Sukoot. The Sadir-o-Ariz affords the means of relief only to a certain extent, and in certain well defined cases; but these contingent charges and extortions not being included in the Revenue or admitted in the Accounts, the funds to meet them cannot be supplied by any increased taxation of the Ryots and Petty Land-holders—and indeed such a measure, if resorted to (with reluctance as it must be at all times, self-enrichment not being the motive, and the alienation and disaffection of retainers the natural result) when the farmer is supported by an adequate Police or other Force for the purpose, would probably inflict an ultimate loss by causing „ „ x . , irnr/ fnr tvi#* the desertion of villages* and the emiora- ♦ A small mud fort serving as a dwelling for the • u t.'? ^ i. • ii • Reuter or Chief and a place of refuge to the villagers tlOU 01 the inhabitants to neighbouring in case of need with the huts of the latter con- Districts, and if attempted when he is rot structed ot very portable materials congregated -1111 1 •! around it constitute for the most part a village of backed by such rorce, necessarily prove the Gurmisaer. a f a il ure an d have the effect of urging him to revolt and resistance, as in the case under consideration, by operating to enlist the sympathy and assistance of his retainers in his cause.

The oldest report on the trade of the Persian Gulf, we can trace in our records, was received in 1834 by the Bom- Volume AV &lt;&gt;* 1834, page 320. b a y Government, from Mr. Blane, Resident in the Persian Gulf (letter No. 24, dated 17th June 1834) ' The sacrifices past and present incurred for the protection of the trade with the Gulf of Persia must attach additional interest to periodical reports of the increase or diminution of the commerce carried on through this channel and it is therefore a source of great regret to me that, even for this Port, I am unable to obtain more accurate information than the very imperfect details • Printed as Appendix a. contained in the inclosed Statement.* 2nd.~~The value of statistical information is as yet little understood by those in possession of the Ports of this Gulf and the Custom-house Officers find it to their interest neither to keep or communicate any very accurate details. I have called upon the Government Agents at ' Bahrein, Sharga, Lmgar and Muscat for such particulars as they are able to furnish ; but do not expect any very accurate returns and as these sources of information are only partial the requisite materials for forming an estimate of the trade would still be deficient. would indeed appear that the Custom-house records in India afford the means of a nearer approximation to the truth than any information which can be collected through local inquiries in this Gulf. A limited trade is carried on with Scinde and the African Coast, of which the details would require to be added, but either as regards the interest which the British possess in it or in its amount is it of any great importance. With this Port the trade has doubtless greatly decreased and parti cularly that carried on in British Vessels. The falling off is said to be chiefly occasioned by the reduced demand for Massulipatam and British Chintzes owing to the supply of piece goods now introduced into Persia through the Port of Tribezond ' and to an increased consumption of those of Russian manufacture. The unsettled state of affairs of late and a want of confidence originating in the apprehended disturbances on the death of_ His Majesty the Shah have also tended to a reduction of mercantile speculations in general: while the great marts of Bussora and Baghdad have been nearly annihilated by the frightful ravages of the Plague. $th.~~On the other hand, there is no Port at which any very ostensible improvement would appear to have taken place. The details in my possession are totally insufficient to enable me to form even the roughest estimate of the whole amount of trade from which a comparison of its increase or decrease might be drawn, but taking a general view of the state of the countries with which the trade is carried on the marks of decline are I fear too legible to be altogether fallacious.' The report with the statements was submitted to the Government of India, whose observations were requested on Volume 683 of 1835, page 497. themt They re plied as follows (No. 6, dated 23rd January 1835):— ' Having had the above statements carefully compared with our records, I have now to state for the information of the Right Hon'ble the Governor in Council, that our exports to the Persian Gulf in 1832-33 were to the amount of 2?,35,720, whereas the Resident shows the imports from all places, in the sum of Rs. 42,51,524, exhibiting a difference of Rs. 15J5fi 0 4' Tta exports from Bushire for the same year, amount to Rs. 20,27,544, to this Port and Bengal, of which our imports from the same Gulf consist of Rs. 15,61,088, showing a difference of Rs. 4,66,456 only. These differences may be placed to the credit of Bengal, but it is evident, that this Port most largely participated in the trade in question. The truth of this remark Is most apparent in the year 1833-34, in which the exports from Bushire to Bombay, with a single exception, amounted to C163PDPART II—CHAPTER VIII. 22 Rs, 7,/o,tf/7, whereas our exports to that Gulf amounted to Rs. j/,rp,//o, the imports at Bushire alpne, amounted to Rs, 14,46^38, of which Rs. 7,&lt;£2,775 were from Bengal from which a large quantity of Indigo was exported, while the imports from this place amounted to Rs. 3,42,112. Our imports from that Gulf, however, were to the extent of Rs. 33,47,797, in the same year. From a minute examination of the two statements which are now returned, although various discrepancies are discoverable, arising doubtless from the in correct records of the Bushire Custom House, I think that the balance generally is in favour of our records, many of these differences having likewise arisen from the confusion attendant on the Quarantine Regulations during the prevalence of the plague.PART II—CHAPTER IX. 33 CHAPTER IX.

The Post Master General replied ' that the traffic at present between Karachi and Bushire is not of such a nature as to ensure a constant communication between jthose places by means of native craft,' and in support of this state ment forwarded a memorandum of arrivals and departures of country craft from and to the Persian Gulf during the years 1854, 1855, 1856, 1857 and 10 months of the year 1858, prepared by the Deputy Collector of Customs, Karachi Years.

During my recent voyage from Bombay to Bushire I have endeavoured by oral and local enquiries to inform myself more in detail as to the condition and prospects of this trade, and I will now summarize as briefly as possible some of the results at which I arrived, for the information of His Excellency in Council. 3. The present great impetus to trade in the Persian Gulf depends prin cipally, whether for, import or export, upon the great demand, at enhanced prices, for cotton and wool at Bombay. In some little degree also it depends upon an incipient opium trade with China; and in sugar with Batavia. 4. It depends principally on the Bombay cotton trade, because cotton can now be exported from nearly all parts of Persia at highly remunerative • Nos. (a), (3) and (4) are Colonel Pelly's remarks on the tribes, etc., round the Persian Gulf, his journey to Shiraz on the Port of Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Kishm etc., printed in the Journal of the Bombay Geographical Society, Volume XVII, as articles V, VI and XV, respectively. No. (2) is a separately printed publiCBtioo of the Foreign Departm«nt Press, Calcutta (1874).PART 11—CHAPTER XI. 28 rates, even when subjected to the heavy freight of steam vessels, and because the wealth thus created in Persia gives rise to a greatly increased demand for the import of piece-goods and copper into that country. 5. The trade in opium and sugar may be capable of indefinite development In opium because it is plain that in a country where this article is not a monopoly* and where it is unsubjected to heavy export duty, it could cceteris paribus profit ably compete with our restricted Anglo-Indian opium trade. In sugar, because Persia consumes a vast quantity of this commodity, and because Batavia and Mauritius, whence she can most profitably import unrefined sugar, stand always in need of cereals and dates which Persia can most readily supply, 6 Whether the present great development of trade in the Persian Gulf would ong outlast the close of the American war, may be a debatable question • probably every year that war lasts tends to increase and to render permanent those habits of industry and desire for comfort which the trade itself has awakened. But at the same time it is probable that the close of the war will be o owed by a considerable fall in prices, and that it might be doubtful whether ;^plf ra ^ e u e n c 2' tinue t0 1 su PP ort steam freight, even although the trade itself should not fall off in actual bulk.

I am credibly Informed that beyond the above causes Muscat is further undermined by her own impolitic levy of high duties, and that the so-called piratical port of Soor to the southward of Muscat is often preferred by traders on account of its greater freedom of trade. 12. As regards Bunder Abbas, there is no doubt its geographical position is very favourable ; but there is as little doubt that steamers now touching there are subjected to incredible inconvenience; the roadstead is quite open, the anchorage distant, and the beach frequently lashed by a heavy surf- The steamer I was aboard of three days ago had nearly one thousand packages for Bunder Abbas ; only two boats of about eight tons each were to be found : these would not land goods on account of the surf. Had it not been for the accidental anchoring of a bugla the steamer would have had to carry on her freight to Bushire, or else to have touched at some nearer port at the risk of her insurance : it is obvious that some convenient point at the south of the gulf is very desirable as an entrepot. The island of Ormuz and Enjam, Tomb and Surdy, the inlets of Bassidore and Kossab, all possess certain advantages. Bassidore we hold under our own flag, and i hope shall continue to hold at all events until we can see our way to some thing better ; but I am of opinion that the selection of the point of entrepot should not in the first instance come from the Political Department. It is the shippers and steam companies who suffer the most immediate inconvenience; let them seek and point out the remedy. Let us then see whether we cannot com bine the convenience of the Telegraph Department with that of trade; but that if the trade continue to increase something must and will be done in the shape of forming an entrepot I feel pretty certain: at present the freight brought to Bunder Abbas by steamers is, I believe, about one-half that brought to Bushire, the freight taken from thence to India might be one-seventh that taken from Bushire. 13. In what I have written concerning the possibility of a direct steam line with the gulf and concerning an entrepot, I have written purely for the in formation of Government. Any proposition for the change should,! think, arise from those most interested in it, the traders and the steam company. 14. I cannot conclude this report without allusion to the highly favourable effects of telegraphic communication upon the trade of this port. The Persian merchants thoroughly appreciate the telegraph, and are eager to avail themselves of it. If the submarine line be, as I fully think it will, permanently successful, it will have the best effects upon th? trade of the gulf. The interest evinced by the Persian traders may in the end prove useful to us ; for it may in the end facilitate the construction of an alternative land line from Gaudel to Cape Jask, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and Fao ; and I venture to think that if the line for the Persian Gulf is to become the principal channel of telegraphic communication between England and India, an alternative line, such as I suggest, might be found of great importance; at the same time much jealousy would have to be met, and we could not, I think, be too careful in avoiding all questions of empire and territory. Extract, paragraphs / to 5, from a letter from the Political Resident } Persian Gulf, No. 5, dated the 12th May iS6b, 1. It is agreeable to me to submit that all is as quiet in the Gulf as usual and trade seems thriving. 2. Nevertheless, at the hazard of being held disproportionately to intrude my local charge on the imperial care of Government, I would venture most respectfully to submit that these regions cannot with safety be any longer regard ed as they were in years gone past. When your interests here were first repre sented, your frontier was behind Sinde and the Punjab; the influences of European Government had scarcely shown themselves in Central Asia; steam was unknown; and our trade was by native craft on our coasts, or between these and England by our own square-rigged vessels. Your interests here were C163FDPART II—CHAPTER XL 30 considered from this point of view, nor did any radical change in this view have place, unless for the suppression of piracy, by the detachment of a squadron of the Indian Navy. 3. When I arrived in the Gulf in November 1863, the Government sum marized its estimate of its interests on the following paragraph, thus evincing a desire to curtail and withdraw, rather than to extend, in this direction ; and this apparently on economic grounds:—' It appears to His Excellency the Governor in Council that British interests on the Persian shores of the Gulf will be amply represented by the appointment of a Political Resident at Bushire with Consular powers in lieu of a Resident and Assistant Resident. The reduction of the Indian Naval Establishments in the gulf will relieve the Political Officer stationed at Bushire of most part of his duties as a disbursing officer, and the pose of Treasurer to the Residency (Rs. 120 per mensem) can be abolished the Accountant being entrusted with the reduced duties in addition to his own.' 4. Yet events have shown that precisely from thaJ; period our interests in n.c Gulf line have taken an unexpected and unprecedented start.

But I fear that with States, as with individuals, it requires almost superhuman wisdom and strength of will to stand permanently isolated and alone. An individual, indeed, may, perhaps, succeed, having the requisite staff within himself; but the life of a State involves a succession of Rulers, and if he who succeed lack those qualities upon which was based the policy of his predecessor, there is risk that the State will have to regain by force or convulsion the status to which it would otherwise have naturally grown.

I hope it may be agreeable to the Right Hon'ble the Governor in Council to Ficte my Report No. 111, dated 25th September learn th&lt;it the settlement made last autumn, «868. under instructions from His Excellency, of the affairs of Bahrein, continues to work well, and peacefully to consolidate the rule of the present Chief, Sheik Alee bin Khalifa. 2. Letters received from Bahrein and Gutter show that the tribes of both these my Report No. 75, dated 12th April 1869. heretofore hostile tracts are in friendly vide extract from the leM-r of the Chief of relations, and trust to prosecuting their Bahrein to my address, appended. 1 • t r 1 • ■ ■ lucrative pearl fisheries in a quiet and undisturbed manner. 3. Government are aware that when steamers were first started in the Gulf a move was made towards embracing Bahrein within the sphere of their civilizing operation. But the ex-Chief, Mahomed bin Khalifa, stood obstinately aloof. It is pleasant, therefore, to report that two steam companies have now been invited by the present Chief to trade with Bahrein. One of these companies has just landed there considerable cargo out of the Steamer Koina, and the courteous invitation to the other (the Mail) Company is now appended in translated purport. 4. In like manner my recent two visits to the Arab Coast give me reason to believe that the Chiefs of Rasoolkhymeh, Ejman, Ommelgavain, and Shargah understand that they cannot with impunity act by sea, and that they will remain at peace and develop their divings and fisheries, if only we maintain that mari* time surveillance, which they themselves admit, and even profess, to be necessary in order to prevent one Chief stealing an advantage over his neighbour. 5. Sensible of the vast difference between the trade returns of the Gulf regions and those of the populous provinces under the free Government of British India, 1 hesitate to submit any formal report on the former. But at the same time I gladly avail myself of an opportunity for incidentally recalling that, whereas when i was appointed to this Residency, seven years ago, no mercantile streamers traversed these waters, we have now passed through the grades of a six-weekly steamer, a monthly steamer, a fortnightly steamer, and now of a regular fort nightly steamer, with an opposition Company playing irregularly, but with rp. f 4 .. . . . . increasing rapidity I I doubt not myself There are at this moment two steamers in port &gt;1 , n f j* r i roM^ to Bombay, each of about 1 ,000 tons gross that small teecling steamers trom the gen- tonnage, and both are going away with full car- eral littoral to the main ports would pay, and will soon be introduced. The impetus given to this useful and progressive trade is, I think, due to the states manlike foresight of Sir Bartle Frere. 6. During a cruise I made last month in the Gulf, I did not receive one single complaint of the state of trade On the contrary, every merchant I spoke with admitted that trade was thriving : this was particularly the case at the principal ports of Bander Abbas, Lingah, and Bushire. 7. I doubt not myself that we are now only at the commencement of develop ment; and that if trade be not unreasonably interfered with by the Native Govern ments it must largely increase. The areas of Persia, Arabia, and Mekran, etc., to be drained, are vast, and, though triflingly poor per square mile, might, if but half exploited, concentrate a good sea-borne trade in one basin like the Gulf.PART ii— CHAPTER XI. 3 2 8. Muscat must, for the present, be excepted from the category of flourish ing ports. Her impoverishment is due in part to frequent revolution and inter, tribal feud; in part to the fact that her position was formerly of more^ importance when it was the point where cargoes were exchanged between the native craft of the littorals and square-rigged vessels; and in part also to the circumstance of the separation of the combined state of Zanzibar and Muscat into two distinct S ta t es _ a circumstance which naturally tended to reduce the sea-borne traffic and communication between these two outlying portions of one Sultanat. But even in regard to Muscat, it should be borne in mind that, while the total of her trade is sadly reduced by the unsettled political condition, this falling off has been felt more by the Native merchants than by our British Indian traders residing at Muscat. There are, I believe, only two or three Native Arab merchants still doing business, or even residing in Muscat; the rest of such trade as there is, is in the hands of Hindoos and Khojahs. 9. While on this topic, it may not he irrelevant to observe that Muscat is not in the Persian Gulf, but in that of Oman, and that the public Press are mis-. taken in criticizing the Muscat affairs as forming a portion of those of the Persian Gulf: little less so, indeed, than was a gentleman who once considered the Ara bian Gulf or Red Sea to be that for which the Government had undertaken the responsibilities resting on it in relation to the Persian Gulf. 10. The British India Steam Navigation Company are, I believe, desirous of running a line of steamers connecting the Gulf line with Aden, touching en routs at Muscat, Mukalla, and other ports on the Arabian Coast. My opinion is that Muscat should be visited by this line, and that the main Gulf line from Kurrachee to Bussorah should be direct, touching at the telegraph stations of Gwadur, Charbar, and Jask, along the coast to the entrance of the Mussendom Straits' and subsequently at Bunder Abbas, Angaum, Bushire, and Bussorah. The main coal station should be at Angaum, and so save the expense of ^carrving coal up the Gulf to Bussorah. The Aden line should join the Gulf line at Bunder Abbas or Angaum. If at Angaum, the Gulf line should ignore Bunder Abbas, and feed it by a supply steamer from Angaum, Lingah, and the other ports on the Arab littoial, diz .) Rasoolkhymeh, Ejman, Ommelgavain, Shargah, Debay, Aboothabee, Bahrein, and Koweit, should be looked to by supply steamer, both because their average several cargoes would be small in bulk (although in the case of pearls costly) ; and secondly, because the sea line of these ports is shallow, and therefore adapted to vessels of light draught. 11. Government are probably informed of the asserted intention on the part u n 6 a ^ ne f ro m Suez to Bussorah so soon as the Lesseps canal shall admit. A rrench Agent who recently toured from Muscat to the Shut-ool Arab reported, understand, very favourably on the productive powers and facilities for trade of the regions at the head of the Gulf. 12. There is in prospect, also, the opening of some line, whether of rail entire, or of rail combined with river and canal communication, between the head of the Gulf and the Mediterranean and I have recently had an interesting conversation Bagdad r of Public Works in P^shalik of 13.

His Excellency in Council will perceive that this commerce has developed rapidly and largely. It appears, for instance, that in 1844-45 the trade with Bombay showed a gross total of Rs. 79,24,609, that in 1860-61 it amounted to Rs. 1 ,31,42,602, while in 1865-66 it amounted to Rs. 3,44,37,408. In other words, that between the years 1845 and i86 5 the trade quintupled itself, while it nearly tnbled itself during the five years between 186 1 and 1865. 5. From the Statement of Trade with the Port of Bombay concluding with the year 1869 it will t* 6 seen that the trade, as compared with 1865-66, being the highest year of the American war, had apparently fallen off ; but this is accounted for by the fact that the cotton trade was abnormally large down to the conclusion of the American struggle ; while, on the other hand, successive disturbances on the Arab coast between 1866 and 1869 have, of course, been injurious to trade, so that it may fairly be assumed that, under ordinary circumstances, the general trade would have continued to show a steady increase. 6. As regards Calcutta, it will be observed that the increase, as between the years 1864-65 and 1868-69, was as follows—Rs. 27,32,681. I am unable to include the year 1844-45 in my comparison of this trade since at that period it was not shown separately from the trade between Cal cutta and the Red Sea. 7. As regards Kurrachee, the increase, as between 1847 an ^ l ^7t has been as follows—Rs. 8,33,731. 8. The appended Statement (E.) shows the most favourable total of trade with the abovenamed three ports for any one year has been as follows—Rs. 4.05.55,796. _ 9- 1 have not enquired into the trade with Madras, because, although I believe that trade to be considerable, I understand that a large portion of it is indirect through Bombay, and this, were the Madras trade shown, it might appear twice. It has seemed to me preferable to be rather under the mark than run the risk of exaggerating in statistical statements. 10. But the trade with these principal British ports by no means repre sents the total of trade with the Gulf, although I am unaware that there are any ^ reliable statistics in regard to trade with other ports. But from the testi monies of numerous native merchants, I think I am safe in submitting that the * The returns and statements referred to in these reports are printed in Appendix D.PART II—CHAPTER XII. 36 subjoined items do not over-estimate the export and import trade with mis- cellaneous ports:— Rs.

Thus the gross total of the export and import trade passing up and down the Gulfs of Persia and Oman appear to have totalled Rs. 5,83,55,796, or nearly 6,000,000 sterling, exclusive of the trade carried on in small coasting craft. 12. As affording a more detailed insight into the character of trade, I beg to append some very carefully-prepared Statements (F) with which I have been favoured by the firm of Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co., the Agents for the B. I. S. N. Company at Bushire. In forwarding these statements^ to me Mr. George McKenzie of the same firm has favoured me with the following remarks:— ^ ' I now send the papers showing in condensed form annual and monthly shipments which is, I hope, what you want. I am sorry press of work here prevents my making up like statements of imports, which, however, are not so important. rhese statements I send you to Bombay, that they may beat hand should vou at any time require same for reference. ^ ' I regret exceedingly I cannot give you more serviceable statements showing the actual trade carried on at our ports in all kinds of craft.

Of course, the trade referred to in Mr. McKenzIe's letter is only steam borne, and, as evidencing the development of this particular trade, 1 would recall that eight years ago no mercartile steamer ran in the Gulf; that since that period trading steamers have continued to increase both in number and in tonnage; that during last year the B. I.S.N. Company's steamer of large tonnage ran fortnightly, while other steamers visited the Gulf during the summer and autumn so frequently as to give an average of a steamer per week. 14. I understand it to be in contemplation to run a line of steamers between England and the head of the Persian Gulf, via the Gulf of Suez, and that a similar line is to be opened by the Turkish authorities between Con stantinople and Busreh, while for the passage of goods up river I understand there are already some eight river steamers. 15. Referring to the opium trade, I beg to append an abstract (G) com paring that for the year 1869 with 1868. 16. I append also a statement (H) showing in detail the manner in which the opium has been exported last year. It is probable that some chests have been exported, of which I have not cognizance; and I understand from good authority that the export for the coming year is estimated at least 3 ,500 chests of about 136 lbs. per chest. This total is, of course, small as compared with the trade in India; but when we recollect that some fifteen years ago the export of opium from Persia was limited to some dozen chests or so, sent via Constantinople, it must be admitted that the trade has rapidly developed, and that if the quality of the opium be improved, the direct export of opium from the Persian Gulf littoral to the eastward of Singapore may, at some future dates, in some degree affect our Indian opium revenue. 17. As regards the statistical statements obtained from the Custom Houses in India, it has not been found practicable to obtain them all for the same years and in uniform details ; but I deem it, nevertheless, advisable to submit them in appendices, together with the remarks with which the several Commissioners have favoured me since they form as complete a basis as is obtainable for estimating the past trade with the Gulf. 18. The statistics of trade shown in this report do not (as before men tioned) include the miscellaneous trade carried by the small coasting craft. But the trade so carried on is very considerable, although the means of even roughly estimating it are wanting. 19. There seems to be a tendency in the trade of the world to resume its ancient channels under improved means of communication, and it is possible that what is commonly known as the Euphrates or Persian Gulf route may here after resume its position as a main line of commerce between the East and the West.' This was followed by a supplementary re- port (No. 265-81, dated 10th July 1870):— ' In supplement of my recent Report on the trade of the Persian Gulf, I _ , have now the honour to submit a few facts ate 231 pn i 70. indicative of the development of the steam- borne portion of that trade :— /s/.—A few weeks ago the first steamer arrived direct from England via the Suez Canal. 2ndly. —The first of an intended line of steamers between Constantinople and the Gulf arrived. On this subject the Political Agent, Muscat, writes as follows:—^The Turkish merchant steamer Babylon arrived here from Aden on the evening of the 27th (May) ultimo, and left for the Persian Gulf the next morning. This vessel is, I understand, the first of a line of steamers to run regularly between Constantinople and Bussorah, and call at the intermediate ports of Jeddah, Aden, Muscat, Bunder Abbas, and Bushire.'

The first of a British line of steamers to run between London and the Gulf via the Suez Canal is expected at Bushire about three months hence. jthly. A steam trade in dates, corn, and dried-hsh \\ith Mauritius and Batavia is spoken of. 2. As yet all the steamers appear to have found full cargoes at rates which, although lower than those which obtained in former years, still pay. *3 It is remarkable that the native merchants, inclusu e of those now largely interested in steamers, have from the commencement steam^ commu nication eight years ago consistently urged the inconvenience and injury that would result to the Gulf trade from the substitution of steamers for Native craft. 4. The fact seems to be that the Gulf trade is capable of indefinite develop- ment, provided freights be sufficiently low to admit of produce competing with that of other countries in foreign markets ; in other words, the Gulf being the only ocean basin for a vast range of territories, the resources of those territories will increasingly seek the ports of the Gulf, provided they can be exported at a profit.' Extract from the Administration Report of the Persian Gulf Residency for 1870-71. Gentlemen largely interested in the trade of these regions have on more than one occasion expressed to me their satisfaction with the degree in which it has already developed, and their confidence in its continuing to do so. The Gulf trade indeed seems capable of indefinite development provided freights be suffi ciently low to admit of produce competing with that of other countries in foreign markets; in other words, the Gulf being the only ocean-basin for a wide range of territories, the resources of those territories will increasingly seek the ports of the Gulf, provided they can be exported at a profit. An interesting account of the rise and progress of the port of Lingah was prepared by Major Sidney-Smith, Assistant Political Resident, during a recent residence at that port. I have since submitted this report to Government. It would appear that the average annual transactions in pearls of sundry merchants of note in Lingah aggregated 50 lakhs of rupees, and the average transactions in piece-goods, and general merchandize about 75 lakhs of rupees, or a gross total of 125 lakhs of rupees per annum. A question has recently been raised by a firm trading in the Gulf, concern ing draw-back. At present no rebate of duty is made on goods re-exported. It was desired that a draw-back should be allowed and submitted the question, and His Excellency the \ iceroy and Governor-General of India in Council has invited the good offices of Her Majesty's Ministers in Persia in the hope of his being able to induce the Shah's Government to grant an adquate measure of relief. The drought in Persia during the past year has tended much to check the increase of trade. Great mortality has had place among the mules, donkeys, etc., thus at once diminishing the supply, and heightening the rate of carriage. 1 he coming season promises more favourably. The traae of Bunder Abbas continues to develop solidly ; and a memorial 01 P™ cl P al merchants at that port and at Bushire was recently nrnt^nn i me ' praylng • h f •' a British A g ent mi g ht b e appointed for the S .IT 'TTfu mterests at Yez ' d . that inland town of Persia being principal point on which the exports and imports of Bunder Abbas depend.PART II—CHAPTER XIII. 39 Chapter XIII.

Review of the Persian Gulf Trade Reports, from 1873 to 1905. C163FDPART 111—CHAPTER XIV. 42 CHAPTER XIV. Trade of the Gulf of Oman and Persia, 1873—1905. Captain Malcolm in his report* on the trade between Persia and India, 1800, , gives the following particulars and estimate * hop:ndi\\ ft, io iht Selections, 1600-1800. r .1 1 r .1? • . 1 of the value of the imports and exports to and from the Persian Gulf:— 30. A probable estimate of the property annually employed in Imports and Exports to and from the Persian Gulf, makes it amount to the gross sum of one crore and sixty lakho of rupees. I shall endeavour to show as concisely and as correctly as I can the nature of this commerce and the channels through which it flows. The annual imports to Persia from India amount to above twenty lacks of rupees. They consist of chintzes from the coast of Coromandel, muslins, piece-goods f sugar, and a variety of articles from Bengal, chinaware,sugarcandy, camphor, and Ca(^) from Bombay; blackpepper, ginger, turmeric, cardamoms and wood for building vessels from the coast of Malabar and piece-goods, kamkhabs, etc., etc., from Surat, Cambay, and Guzarat. From the Red Sea the only import to Persia is coffee, and of that, not above twenty thousand rupees is consumed during the year. Persia answers this trade by an export of about twelve lakhs in the native productions of the country, silk, Carmenia wool, carpets, tobacco, dried fruit, asafoetida, rose-water, etc., etc., and the balance is sent in specie and bullion. 31. The trade with India is chiefly confined to Abu Shehr. The duties collected on imports and exports at this Port are regulated by a standard established many years ago by Shaikh Nasser, father of the present Governor. On Exports they are very trifling, and on goods imported, though nominally more, do not average above 4 per cent, on the prime Cost, and I have learned from good authority, that the Duties on Imports produced last year seventy-thousand rupees, or one lack of Piastres, which gives an import of goods to the amount of seventeen lacks and a half of rupees at this Port alone, independent of the Hon ble Company s sales, in all of which, the Shaikh receives four per cent, from the pur chaser. This estimate, if correct, which I have reason to believe it is, proves that the present trade between India and Persia is rather under, than over, rated. ^ 32« The only Indian goods that are shipped direct for a Persian Port are those from Bengal and Masulipatam and the remainder which amount to more than half of the total sum, go fust to Muscat, from whence they are re-shipped for the Gulph ; within these last two years however, the Abu Sheher and Merchants have sent their Agents to Bombay with a view of procuring consignments direct. Chapters VIII—XII of this Precis and Colonel Pelly's published reports of 1863, give some idea of the commerce of the gulf in 1834, and 1856, and 1857, 1863 1864, 1866, 1869 and 1870-71. The following statement shows the growth of its commerce during the last 30 years :—PART III—CHAPTER XIV. 44 So the commerce of the Gulfs of Oman and Persia estimated in 1800 at 1 crore and 60 lakhs of rupees has grown to over 40 crores, or about 20 times as much as that in 1900. This enormous development is, it need not be mentioned, mainly due to the sacrifices incurred by the British Government for the protection of the commerce of the Gulf. For more particulars the reader's attention it drawn to the following appendices :— Appendix F. —Comparative statements of the Persian Gulf trade with the Principal countries, 1873-1905. Appendix G. —Comparative statements of the Principal Export and Imports of the ports in the Persian Gulf. Appendix H, —Return of the shipping of the ports of Bushire, Maskat and Basrah. Trade of Bushire. The modern Bushire is a Britsh creation : once an insignificant port, it is only since 1763, when the East India Company established a factory there, that it began to attract commerce of the Gulf to itself and to grow into an important commercial centre. It is now the most important port of Persia, and its sea trade is still mainly in British hands. The extract from Captain Malcolm's report printed above shows the approximate extent of its trade in 1800, and Chapters VIII, XII, XIII, of this Precis in subsequent years up to 1871. The following statement based on Appendices F (1)—shows the value of its trade with the principal countries during the last 30 years :—f « I PART III—CHAPTER XIV. 46 One striking peculiarity of the trade returns of Bushlre of the last 30 years, is the £*reat increase of the imports from the United Kingdom, so that what was less than half of the imports from India in 1873, was more than double of the Indian imports during the decade ending the year 1903.

This rapid growth of the commerce of Lingah has been due more to its importance as a port of transit for the trade with the Arab Coast and the Island of Bahrein, than as an convenient centre for distribution of imports into the interior of Persia or attracting the internal trade of the country. By far the largest quantity of Lingahs' trade, after India, is with the Arab coast and Bahrein put together, and a great quantity of this is absorbed by the import and export of pearls received mainly from the Arab Coast and Bahrein. The averaae annual imports to Lingah of pearls for the five years 1898—1902 were estimated at Rs. 27,46,650, which in 1903 increased to Rs. 49,05,000 and in 1904 decreased to Rs. 5,88,300, while the exports of pearls in those years were estimated at Rs. 2 ,15 ,000 ; Rs. 49^5,000 and Rs. 6,23,800, respectively.

Some 75 years after this Colonel Pelly in his report of 1803 speaks of Bandar Abbas as the principal port of entry for piece-goods into Persia, its imports consisting of coffee, tea, sugar, spices and miscellaneous goods ; and exports of wool and fruits. He observes ' I have noticed that Bandar Abbas has been somewhat decried as a port, but I am of opinion that it is the point where trade coming to and from a vast area of southern Central Asia meets the sea.' In 1871 Colonel Pelly reported that the trade of Bandar Abbas continued to develope solidly (see Chapter XII, ante). • Taken from 8 ppendi« s F (i3)-(i8). ^ he lowing statement* illustrates its trade with the principal countries for the last 30 years ;— 0163FDPART III—CHAPTER XIV. 5i The principal exports and imports of Bandar Abbas are shown in appendices G (5) and (6).

The British Consul in his trade report for 1904 writes ' In view of the general prosperity of the country, it is difficult to explain the cause of the great decrease, especially in imports. Local opinion does not hold that it is due so much to the rise on the customs duties, brought about by the tariff of February 1903, as to the many formalities required by the customs authorities, and to the strict manner in which these formalities are enforced.'

Writing in 1800, *Captain Malcolm (afterwards Sir John Malcolm) estimated the value of the exports of Bahrein and the southern shore of the Persian Gulf at about 10 lakhs of rupees.f In 1823 Captain McLeod, reporting on the Joasmi tribe (being then at Ras-ul-Khaima and Shargah) described them as possessing no articles of export, since their pearls are generally purchased by mer chants on the spot and the produce of their country is not sufficient even for their maintenance. Their only employment is fishing, diving for pearls and importing dates, grain and other necessaries of life, which they purchase with the price of these pearls' Major Hennell in his report, dated 15th May 1837, quoted in chapter V, ante writes in much the same strain of the condition of the trade of the Arab Coast. Colonel Pelly's well known report of 1863 estimates their gross yieldings from pearl diving at 4,000,000 of dollars as compared with 3,500,000 dollars of Bahrein. They were then mainly dependent for subsistence on the proceeds of their pearl diving. They imported from Malabar, especially Mangalore, a large quantity of rice and some teakwood. They traded also with Zanzibar, bringing from the Africa masts for their boats, cloves and rice, and also slaves. The maritime resources of the Arab tribe on the coast in Bahrein in ^ / \ t 1863 are shown in Colonel Pelly's report tTaken from Appendices F. ( 2 .)-(3*). of ^ ^ The gross trade of Bahrein amounted in 1863 to about 28 lakhs of rupees, dependent principally on pearls. The imports of Bahrein were mainly from India. The following two statements showj the state of trade with the principal countries since 1873 :— 'Captain Malcolm's report on the trade between Persia and India, paragraph 33 seg printed as Appendix H to the Selections (1600 —1800). fExtract quoted in paragraph m of Colonel Pelly's published report on the Persian Gujf tribes, etc., 1863.

Unlike the Pirate coast, Bahrein has always maintained a large direct commercial intercourse with India; in fact about two-thirds of its trade has always been Indian, while in the trade of the Arab Coast, India has at any rate from 1873 to 1902 taken a place second to that of the Persian ports in direct traffic and it is only since 1903, that India holds the first place in this respect. The causes of these facts have been discussed above under the heading of Lingah.

The Trade from India to Arabia is still more considerable ; it amounts to the annual Sum of at least forty lacks of rupees, thirty of which goes to Bussorah, and the remainder to Bahrien and the Southern Shore of the Gulph ; it consists of nearly the same Articles which I have already enumerated as Imports to Persia. Upwards of twenty-five lacks of rupees of this branch of Trade, comes through Muscat, and the whole of the annual Import of Coffee from the Red Sea to Bussorah and the Arabian Shore which is estimated at twenty lacks is brought by that Port as its natural Emporium. These great imports are answered by Exports from Bussorah of Dates, the Native produce of the soil, by Pearls (received from Bahrein, and other Parts on the Arabian Shore in exchange for Grain) and Gold and Silver Lace brought from Europe by the Aleppo Caravans and Copper from the mines of Diarbeker. Most of these Exports pass through Muscat in their way to India. 35. The balance of Trade of Bussorah which generally exceeds ten lacks of rupees is sent in specie and bullion, 36. The value of ten lacks of Indian Goods are annually imported at Bahrein and the adjacent parts of the Arabian Shore, these are balanced by an export of Pearls to an equal amount. The Imports and Exports of Basrah from and to Bombay for 6 months from 1st November 1^56 to 30th April • Appendix b. ante, 1857 were valued* at Rs. 10,60,453 and Rs. 17,89,208, respectively.

D., Maskat grew into the most important trading centre in the Gulfs of Omen and Persia. We have the following description •Appendix F. to the s .Uctic*,tcoo-iSoo. o{ commerce in the Report* on the com merce of Arabia and Persia by Samuel Manesty and Harford Jones in 1790:— ' The commercial intercourse, carried on between Muscat, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulph, is effected, by means of Dows, Dingies and square rigged vessels, belonging to the Arabs: and the commercial intercourse, carried on between Muscat and India, is effected in part by means of the ahovementioned vessels, and in part, by means of vessels belong ing to different European Nations and to Indian Moslem merchants. The first mentioned vessels navigated, by the Arabs of Muscat who are active and enterprizing, though not very skilful seamen, perform voyages to the Guadel and Scindy Coasts, to Surat, Bombay, the Coast of Malabar and even latterly to Calcutta, They annually convey to those places, considerable quantities of pearls, rock salt, brimstone, copper, arsenic, galls, saffron, raw silk, dates, dried fruits, assafoetida, opium, a variety of other drugs, many less important mercantile articles, and large sums of money in German crowns, Venetians, and other gold and silver coins, and they annually import from those places, at Muscat, considerable quantities of Surat piece-goods of various kinds, Malabar cloth, cotton yarn, Gujerat piece-goods, chintz and cuttanees Cambay chauderss. Broach and Scindy cotton, shauls, bamboos, chinaware, sandal wood, pepper, ginger, cardamums, nutmegs, cina« mon, cassia flowers, musk, camphire, turmeric, indigo, iron, lead, steel, tin, totheoa- que, red lead, oil, ghee, rice, teak timber, and many less important mercantile articles. The vessels belonging to Indian Moslem merchants, which occasionally visit Muscat, convey to and from India, commercial articles similar to those imported at, and exported from Muscat by the vessels belonging to the port. The vessels belonging to European nations, which annually import at Muscat, convey to that place, considerable quantities of piece-goods, the manufactures of Bengal and of the Coromandel coast, sugar, spices, rice, turmeric, indigo, iron, steel, tin, tothenaque, red lead, small cannon, balls and some coarse firearms. The three last menlioned articles are principally imported by the French, The vessels belonging to European nations, which annually import at Muscat, convey from thence to the English settlements in India, to Battavia, and to the Mauritius, large sums in specie, gold and silver coins, pearl and considerable quantities of brimstone, rock, salt, copper, arsenic, balls and many less important mercantile articles. The vessels belonging to the Arabs of Mascat, which are annually despatched to the Ports of Hodeeda and Mocha in the Red sea; convey to those places considerable quantities of dates, the produce of the vicinity of Bussora, pearl, various kinds of piece-goods, the manufactures of Bengal, of the coasts of Coromandel and Malabar, and of Surat, cotton shauls, chinaware, sugar, sugar candy, pepper, sandal wood, ginger, cardamums, cloves, nutmegs, cinamon, cassia flowers, musk, camphire, opium, termeric, indigo, tobacco, rose- water and many less important mercantile articles, and bring in return to Muscat, very valuable cargoes of Yemen coffee, a variety of drugs, and considerable sums of money in Venetians and German crowns. The vessels belonging to the Arabs, which navigate the Persian Gulph, convey to the different ports thereof the principal part of the Yemen coffee, and of the different Indian and European mercantile articles which are annually imported as beforementioned at Muscat; and being in return to that place, principally, however, from Bussora, consider able quantities of dates, copper, arsenic, galls, saffron, raw silk, Bagdad and Aleppo cuttanees, needles, hardware, tobacco, rosewater, dried fruits, opium, assafotida, a variety of other drugs, many less important mercantile articles and large sums of money, in various gold coins. The remaining incosiderable part of the Yemen coffee, and of the other different mercantile articles, which are annually imported at Mascat, is destined for the consumption of that place, and of the other parts of the Province of Oman. It is circulated through that Province by land conveyance, by the means of camels, at a moderate expense, and without any consequential risk. The duties collected by the Government of Mascat, are 6^ per cent, on all importations even provisions not excepted. From the foregoing information, relative to the commerce of Muscat, it evidently appears to be of a very important and extensive nature, and on a consideration of the advantages arising to Muscat from local situation, it may be fairly concluded that its com merce must ever flourish.' Tbere were, however, signs even in 1790 of some rival influences in operanam, which gathered force later on, against the rosperity of Maskat; for the samePART III—CHAPTER XIV. 59 report mentions that since the Arabs had obtained possession of the island of Bahrein, they had furnished themselves with vessels that could carry on direct traffic with India and that they had commenced to import direct a large number of Indian and European goods from India to Jabarrah and Katif without landing them at Maskat.

( ? 0, 'V? 31 . tra( l e of the Persian Gulf vrith India or Africa or the Red Sea still passed through Maskat. The commerce of Maskat was considerably interfered with since about 1803 to 1821 by the Joasmi and other Arab pirates. After the suppression of piracies in the Gulf, the piratical Arabs seem to have turned into active traders and from the reports which are quoted in Chapters VII and VIII (ante) it appears that the Arabs of the southern shore of the Persian Gulf as well as of Maskat carried on a large portion of the traffic between India and the Persian Gulf. In 1863 Colonel Pelly reported that the trade of Maskat State was in a partially transition condition owing to the division of the Imamship into two separate Sultanates of Zanzibar and Maskat under the arbitrament of Earl Canning. tQnoted in Chapter Xlt o! this Prlcii. r- l' h j dated '9^ June 1869 Colonel Pelly writes :— 8. Muscat must, for the present, be excepted from the category of flourishing ports. Her impoverishment is due in part to frequent revolution and intertribal feud; in part to the fact that her position was formerly of more importance when it was the point where cargoes were exchanged between the native craft of the littorals and square-rigged vessels ; and in part also to the circumstance of the separation of the combined state of Zanzibar and Muscat into two distinct States—a circumstance which naturally tended to reduce the sea borne traffic and communication between these two outlving portions of one Sultanat. But even in regard to Muscat, it should be borne in mind that, while the total of her trade is sadly reduced by the unsettled political condition, this falling off has been felt more by the Native merchants than by our British Indian traders residing at Muscat. There are, 1 believe, only two or three Native Arab merchants still doing business, or even residing in Muscat; the rest of such trade as there is, is in the hands of Hindoos and Khojahs.

C163FD6 3 Chapter XV.—Exports of opium from Persia via the Persian Gulf. One of the most interesting features of the commerce of Persia in recent years has been the wide expansion of the cultivation of opium and its increasing export by way of the Persian Gulf, especially to China. The earliest account on the opium trade in Persia we find in our records is the following memorandum by Ronald Thomson, dated 6th May 1869:—• Of late years the manufacture of opium in Persia has increased considerably, and the quantity now exported from the country may be reckoned at double what it was in i860, The merchants have lately discovered that instead of sending it through Central Asia at great risk and cost, they can forward this drug at a comparatively small expense to China by sea, without touching at any British port, and that consequently large profits may be realized in the trade. The result has been that the poppy is now cultivated in most ot the provinces of Persia, where the climate appears generally to be extremely favourable to its growth. Near Tehran, for instance, and in many other districts where it was formerly almost unknown, large fields are at present under cultivation with this plant; and there is every reason to believe that a steady increase in the production of opium throughout the Kingdom will now annually take place. 2. During the year 1868-69 the quantity produced in Persia and imported from Herat was I5»5oo Shah vians, each man weighing 13^ lbs. It will be seen from the following statement that Yezd and Ispahan are the districts where the largest quantity is obtained, though the quantity is inferior to that manufactured in the other provinces ;— Opium produced in Persia in j868'6g. Shah maus. 150 250 1,400 ... ... 200 5 ,000 ... 1,000 Total ... 15,500 3. Of the above 15,500 mans ) about 600 or 700 mans were last year consumed in Persia, and the rest was reported from Bunder Abbas and the other ports in the Persian Gulfs mostly to Batavia for re-shipment to China. A small quantity found its way to the Toorkoman desert ; having been purchased by Agents from these tribes in various parts of Khorassan. 4. The quality of this opium varies in the different provinces where it is produced. In the north near the Caspian sea, where the climate is exceedingly damp, it is dark in colour and very inferior in quality. Natives explain its relative quality thus :—The strength of the manufactures in Kerman and Cashan is given at 20°, that from Khorassan at 10°, from Teheran at 8° and from Yezd and Ispahan 7 0 . About 1,000 Shah mans are also im ported annually from Herat, but it is said to be of very inferior quality and is of less value than that produced at Ispahan. Kerman and Cashan are the two districts where the best opium is obtained in Persia. Agents have on two occasions been sent from France to analyse and report on the value of this drug, and they found that, when unadulterated it contained a large proportion of morphine and was altogether superior to that produced in Turkey and better also than the average quality prepared in India. Of lale, however, some difficulty has been experienced in the j)rovinces raw in procuring opium in a pure state, as the Persians frequently while preparing and manipulating the drug, mix, sugar and other substances with it. 5. The price of unprepared opium at the beginning of last season was 18 Tomans the Shah man, but the rates advanced somewhat later to 24 Tomans. Manufactured and in a pure state, it fetched not less than 30 Tomans for the same quantity in the Persian market. As already stated, many of the native dealers are in the habit of adulterating the opium intended for exportation, and several chests were returned from Batavia last year in consequenee. 6. About 15 years ago, opium of the best and purest quality was now in the bazars here at from 10 to 12 Tomans a Shahman. The entire amount exported from Persia was sent from Herat to Bokhara, whence it was forwarded through Tartary to the Chinese frontier. This route was, hewever, so unsafe, and the expense of transport was so heavy, that it was abandoned 12 years ago, and most of the produce was then sent in a half pre pared state to Constantinople. That route has now been almost entirely discontinued, the Persian traders having found that it was cheaper and more expeditious to charter a vessel for the purpose of conveying these consignments from the Gulf direct to Batavia. Dated the 6th May i86g. (Sd.)

Lucas's interesting McviOfciuduwi on the optuwi of Persia in the Gulf Residency Administration Report for 1878-79, (p a g e 30* In that report reviewing the trade statistics for 1878, the Political Resident wrote:— ' When the Persian opium trade was in its infancy, the drug was sent in sailing vessels to Java and thence re-shipped in steamers for Singapore and Hongkong. The Dutch Government, however, having imposed certain restrictions a.t Java, Aden was subsequently selected as a port of transhipment, and later Suez, at which port no duty is levied for transhipment. The Persian Steam Navigation Company now send occasional steamers trom the Gulf to Galle for conveyance of opium, when a sufficient quantity is collected to remunerate by freight. Poppy having risen in price in Europe, considerable quantity was in 1878, shipped hence to England for the first time.'

Telegraphic communication between Europe and India was first established when the first Red Sea cable was laid in 1859-60 by the ' Telegraph to India Company ' under guarantee from the British Government of 4^ per cent. This cable after leaving Aden landed at the Kuria Muria Islands, Masqat and Cape Monze (near Karachi), but on completion in i860 it failed at once due to its being; too light and weak, to its having been too tightly laid, to insufficient surveys of the bottom of the sea where laid, to the want of protection of the outer wires from the action of sea-water, and to the want of any experience in similar work for guidance. When this cable failed it was found impossible to form another company for the enterprise, as the confidence of the public in the practicability of any scheme brought forward was shaken. But as telegraphic communication was an abso- lute necessity, the British Government took the ' matter up, and after extensive enquiries and surveys the Persian Gulf route was decided upon as the best. The Turkish lines, at this time, ran in connection with the European system of telegraphs as far as Baghdad. It only required, therefore, an extension of this line to Fao and a cable from there to Karachi, for the East to be brought into direct telegraphic communication with the West. Under instructions from Government, the Reverend Mr. Badger, in Decern- - Letter to Government, dated the 17th Decern- ber i860 * Submitted a Scheme for CStab- ber i860. lishing a line of telegraph overland from Bas'-ah to Karachi, via Bandar Abbas and the Mekran Coast. Mr. Badger pointed out that the Home Government had signified their readiness, on the completion of the line to Basrah, of continuing it from that point to Karachi by cable through the Persian Gulf. This project, he observed, contemplated a long sea line, but the signal failure of all such lines hardly warranted the expectation of its success. He then proceeded to state his reasons for considering why a land line was less impracticable than was generally supposed, and suggested, as a preliminary to more formal and authoritative measures, that the Commissioner in Sind, and the Political Agents at Khelat, Maskat and Bushire, should be invited to report on the practicability of the scheme proposed by him. This suggestion was adopted by Government, and the officers namedf tCircuiar letter No. 72, dated the 7th January 1861. by Mr. Badger were requested to favour Government, after due enquiry, with their opinions on the important subject dis cussed by him. A copy of Mr. Badger's letter was, at the same time, forwarded to Her Majesty's Secretary of State,]: and the t Despatch No.4of 1861. prospect of the speedy completion of the telegraphic line to Basrah was dwelt on as an additional reason for establishing regular steam communication with the Persian Gulf, a subject which had been repeatedly submitted to the attention of Her Majesty's Government. On the 25th January the Commissioner in Sind§ replied to the reference 5 Letter to Government, No. 16, dated the 25th made to him, expressing h 'lS full COIlCUr- January 1861. rence in the practicability of the proposed line from Basrah to Karachi. The Political Agent at Khelat, with whom Mr. Inverarity had communicated, considered the line was not only practicable, but the best and the most certain plan of obtaining connected telegraphic communica tion with England. Major Green promised a further report on the subject after he had collected full information regarding the ports and tribes on the Mekran Ccast. • Paragraphs 1, 2, 3 are taken from a note of Mr. Whitby Smith, dated a2nd September 1904, and paragraphs 4-27 from a Summary, drawn up by the Bombay Political Department in 1862, copy of which was sent to us in November 1904. C163FDPART IV—CHAPTER XVI. 68 The A^ent at Maskat (Mr. H. Rassam) reported* that, after careful enquiry, * Letter to Government.

He submitted at the same time, a list of villages on the coast between Bandar Abbas and Karachi most of which were shown to be either held in farm by the Imam of Maskat from Persia, or to be tributary to the latter power. This report, coupled with that received from the Commissioner in Sind, was t Letter to Mr. Allison, No. 1371. dated the Fth considered so far satisfactory as to justify April 1861. • Government in moving Her Majesty sf Minister at Teheran to negotiate with the Persian Government for permission to carry the electric telegraph along the Persian Coast in the direction of Karachi so far as Persian dominion unquestionably extended. In the meantime Major Green's further report} was received. He pointed out a difficulty in connection with the J^KLn^rs&amp;.K'^dTio' establishment of the proposed telegraph March 1B61. line, arising out of a claim advanced by the Khan of Khelat to the port of Gwadur in possession of the Sultan of Maskat and suggested, as a means of overcoming the difficulty, the purchase of Gwadur by the British Governvient, and its transference, under certain conditions to the Khan of Khelat, It was admitted by Major Green that the Imam of Maskat? was in possession of the country west of Gwadur as far as Cape Jask in the middle of last century, at which time the Khan of Khelat conquered the country lying between Gwadur and Karachi. It was also admitted by him that the Imams have been in undisturbed possession of Gwadur itself for about the same period, that is, for fully a century. Under these circumstances, it appeared to Government that the title of the Sultan of Maskat, whether valid or otherwise originally, derived &amp; prescriptive sanction from mere lapse of time. As the question thus raised by Major Green was an important one, the § Resolution of Gorernment, dated the 20th Reverend Mr. Badger, when proceeding Apnl l861, to Maskat in May 1861, as temporary head of the Maskat-Zanzibar Commission, was requested to enquire§ and report fully on the whole subject. While this question was under consideration, a despatch dated the 17th |lDe. P atchNo. 3 of ,861. J'' 3 )'!! 1861 was received from Her Majesty's Secretary of State, enclosing copy of a memorandum submitted by him to the Persian Ambassador in London, containing the terms of a proposed agreement between the Persian and Indian Governments for the construction of a line of telegraph from the Turkish Frontier through Persia to Bandar Abbas, which should form a com ponent part of a line of telegraph from England to India. The Secretary of State, at the same time, stated that, with the view of commencing operations on some section of the line between the Turkish Frontier and Karachi next working season, he had taken measures to obtain stores, which, pending the result of the negotiations with the Persian Government, might be applied to the line along the Mekran Coast. He accordingly suggested that this Government should obtain the permission of the Imam of Maskat, and of the other Chiefs who hold territory on the Coast through which the line would pass, carry it through their possessions. Before, however, obtaining the formal consent of the Chiefs in authority along the Mekran Coast, Government considered it advisable that a careful survey of the^ Coast should be made and the positions of the telegraph stations determined. The Commissioner in Sind was accordingly requested to make arrange- ULetter No. 169 dated the 15th June 1861, ments for the deputation of an officer . . , 1 competent to undertake the necessary survey as early as practicable. The British Agent at Maskat was, at the same time, requested** to move •• No. 166of 1861. Highness the Sultan, who had recently ,1 ■ 1 « ». . expressed his willingness toco-operate in the proposed undertaking, to depute an accredited Agent to Gwadur at thePART IV—CHAPTER XVI. 69 proper time to aid in the prosecution of the survey. It was intended that this Agent should meet the officer sent from Sind at Gwadur. On the 3rd June 1861 Mr, Badger submitted a report, detailing the result T . m « t qa , his enquiries at Maskat regarding the Letter to Government No. 3 of 1861. ^ ~ Loast between Bunder Abbas, Gwadur, and Sonmeani. He also discussed in this report the question as to the extent to which the Sultan of Maskat and the Beluchi Chiefs on Coast would be entitled to enter into engagements with the British Government, consistently with their obligations to the Persian Government; and again how far it would be fair in the British Government to seek concessions from the Shah in a territory which the Beluchis regard as their own. On these points the Governor in Council was of opinion that it would be necessary for Her Majesty's Government to recognize the status which Persia actually possessed, and that the only sound course to pursue would be to deal directly with the Chiefs with the permission of the Sovereign Power. A copy of Mr. Badger's report was forwarded to the Government of India .N0.030f .8S1. on the 12th July* with an expression of these views, which it was hoped would induce the Government of India to procure from the Court of Persia, through Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran, the necessary permission for opening nego tiations directly with the Chiefs. Copy of a report from Major Henry Green, dated the 23rd June, was for warded to the Government of India at the same time, narrating the result of a brief survey of the Mekran Coast made by him in the Hugh Lindsay, on his way from Khelat to the Presidency in progress to England. On the 1 st July the Commissioner in Sind recommendedf the nomination ♦ r . q A . i8 , r of his assistant, Major Goldsmid, for the + Letter to Government, No. 298-A. of isor. , &lt;■ i *, i X proposed survey of the Mekran Coast, in connection with the establishment of the telegraph. He also proposed to place the services of Mr. Ryland, surveyor, at the disposal of Major Goldsmid, and to provide him with an escort of 50 sabres of the Sind Horse. These arrangements were duly sanctioned by Government, I but final : No. 1.4, dated the .4ih August .86.. instructions for Major Goldsmid's guidance were delayed, pending the issue of a cor respondence with the Government of India regarding the extent to which negotiations should be carried out with the Chiefs on the Mekran Coast. The , Colonel Duraud's l.tt., No. .34. dated the 2 8.h Government of India^ eventually signified November 1861. that they had no objection to Major Goldsmid's Mission, provided he did no more than seek information, without either entering into any negotiation with the Chiefs, or committing the Government one w^ay or another as to any recognition of the pretensions of Persia. Under these instructions, Major Goldsmid's Mission, attended by a small escort, set out from Karachi on the 12th Decem- 1 Commissioner's letters Nos.

As the Government were not aware of any preparations having been made for Major Goldsmid's reception by any Persian authorities, and as intelligence recently received from Mr. Allison showed that the Shah's Government might take umbrage at any unauthorised examination of those Coasts, Major Goldsmid desired not to extend his journey beyond Gwadur. He according returned by sea to Karachi on the 5th February 1842, after an absence of eight weeks, and submitted on the 22nd of the same month a report ^ embodying the IT No. 19 of 1862. results of his enquiries and proceedings, of which he had kept Government duly informed during his progress on the Coast, in this report he estimated thePART IV—CHAPTER XVI. 70 cost of maintaining the telegraph line to be about Rs. 18,000 a year, as follows:— „ Rs. For 240 miles under the Jam of Beyla ... ... 10,000 For 120 miles under the Naib of Kedgi ... ... 5) 000 For 50 miles of the Gwadur territory under the Maskat ... 2,000 For the short distance belonging to the Khan of Khelat 1 ,000 beyond Gvvadur. Total ... 18,000 For this subsidy he stated the Khan of Khelat would undertake to afford protection to the employes of the Telegraph Department, to give the necessary land for offices, residences, etc., and to provide a suitable patrol for the line. Mr. Walton, of the Indian Telegraphic Department, had been deputed to Bombay in October 1861 in connection with the proposed telegraph. As there was little to occupy him in Bombay, Government instructed* him to proceed with the Major Green to Maskat in Jrfnuary'Ts^eHt letter No. 266, dated the ^th j anuary&gt; and assist those officers in enquiries which they proposed to make as regards an alternative line of telegraph along the south-western shores of the Persian Gulf to a point opposite to Gwadur. In issuing these instructions, the Bombay Government anticipated the %T views of the Government of India.f who + Colonel Durand's Despatch No. 230, dated the 1 i • r j.t .• f nth March 1862. had, in consequence or the unsatisfactory state of negotiations with Persia, arising out of her pretensions to sovereignty on the Mekran Coast, arranged to depute Major Patrick Stewart, of the Telegraphic Department, to examine the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf, and, after communication with Mr. Allison at Teheran to report on the feasibility of an alternative line, which would render the British Government independent of Persia. On the 18th MarchJ 1862 Major Malcolm Green reported on the feasibility T *-• . m . C oa suc h an alternative line, and in forward- t Letter to Government, No. 5 of 1862. . r 1 • • • . ing a copy ot his communication on the subject to the Government of India, the Bombay Government expressed its opinion in favour of the conclusion arrived at by Major Green, of the facility of completing telegraphic communication between England and India, without encroaching on Persian soil. The Commissioner in Sind reported, on the 26th February § 1862, the arrival of the Jane Btyth at Karachi Mb ^ . store ? for Mekran telegraph, March 1 £62. and, in reply to an intimation made to the Government of India on the subject, sane- Hon II was conveyed for the commencement of the line from Karachi to Gwadur, In pursuance of these instructions, Mr. Walton was directed to proceed to nuuet to the Commissioner, No. .573, dated the Karachi and place himself under the orders 7th March 1S62. ot the Commissioner in Sind,^f the details of the undertaking being left to that officer. These arrangements and others necessary for entering upon the construction of the line were reported to the Government 'coioVet' Duranda dated the , 4 th of India,*' and in replytt that anthority in 1862. approving them, intimated that Mr. Walton's services would be held as at the disposal of the Govemmemt of India in the Foreign Department, under the same authority which controlled the operations of Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart, and that ' until the question of the best line to be adopted beyond Gwadur is settled, and Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart is set free from the preliminary enquiry in which he is at present engaged, all arrangements must be regarded as temporary and open to future revision. 'PART IV—CHAPTER XVI. 7i Agreements were concluded with the Jam of Beyla, the Khan of Khelat and the ChTef of Kedgi for providing facilities for the construction of a land line from Karachi to Gwadur and for its V otection and maintenance (vide Aitchinson 's Treaties (1892), Volume IX, pages 394-39 6 ancl 4 0l -4 0 4)* The line from Karachi to Gwadur was completed on 30th April 1863 (see paragraph 13 of Mr. Mansfield's report dated 4th June Political A., August 1863, Nos. 63-67. ^ 863) The steps taken to overcome the political difficulties in continuing the land line from Gwadur onwards, are treated in the Mekran Precis, There were then under consideration several points in regard to the pro posed connection with Bashire and Basrah, viz*'.— (a) Whether a cable should be laid across the sea to Maskat and then have a land line by way of the Batineh Coast, or whether it should be laid right across to the Mussandom Peninsula. The latter course was adopted as more feasible. (b) Whether we should lease Gwadur from the Sultan of Maskat, Mr. Mansfield, Commissioner in Sind, after a tour round the Gulf, expressed an opinion in favour of the proposed lease. But the Bombay Government and the Government of India decided against it, and thought that what was required was lease only of the area required for the telegraph Political A„ August 1863, Nos. 63-67. station (Government of India letter No. 484, dated 8th August 1863). Vide for further details Mekran Precis&gt; Chapter II. What arrangements should be made for constructing the line across the Isthmus of Maklab. id) What should be the steps taken for continuing the line from Baghdad. The Turkish Government insisted on constructing the line themselves and making their own arrangements with the Arab tribes from Baghdad to Fao. As the line would pass through districts inhabited by Arabs hostile to the Turkish Government, an alternative line from Baghdad to Tehran via Khannikin was sug gested. (5) The British Government were anxious to construct an alternative line from Bushire to Bandar Abbas and onwards to Gwadur. The Persian Government were, however, suspicious of ^ this enter prise and the Shah declined to entertain the question of land line of telegraph eastwad from Bushire (see Political A., Ju.y 1866, Nos. 3-4). The negotiations resulted only in permitting the British Government to continue the line from Gwadur to Bandar Abbas under Convention dated 2nd T Apnl ^ 1868 (Aitchison s Treaties^ Volume X, page 80)—see Mekran Precis^ Chapter ii.

His Majesty tbe Sultan authorises the establishment on Ottoman territory, at the mouth of the Shatt -el -Arab, of a British telegraph office, with a staff, which shall not exceed in number 50 persons placed under the exclusive orders of a British station master, and which, as well as the apparatus and all the instruments requisite for working the submarine line, shall be at the expense of the British Government. Article 4. The aforesaid British office shall be located in the same building occupied by the Ottoman station at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, with a view to facilitate the combined operations of the common service. The apparatus of the Ottoman service and that of the British service at the joint station shall be placed in separate compartments, but in close proximity to each other, and shal] not be connected. Ttie exchange of messages shall take place immediately on their receipt, the officers handing them to each other through a window, and the service of the British and Ottoman offices shall be permanent. The rent and cost of maintenance of the mixed telegraphic station shall be shared in equal proportions by the British and Ottoman Admmistiations. A wooden structure of 8 rooms obtained from India was set up for the use of the telegraph employes at Fao. But when St the telegraphic operations began to be in Political a., May 186s, No. 75. full swing, and the lurkish establishment Political a., June 1865, Nos. 43-44. was increased, it was found necessary that a second house should be built. Until this was done, the British office was set up on the flat Hyderabad. Good deal of obstruction was offered by Namik Pasha to the building of the second house and references had to be made to Constanti nople with the result that a wooden structure similar to the first was obtained from 'india at the cost of the Baghdad Government, and set up near the old house. The second house was set up, under the orders of the Porte, 30 .yards apart from the first, and in the centre between the two houses w^as built an office, common to both divided by a partition wall with half door for exchange of messages. The new building was made over to the British authorities, without, however, right of ownership either in the structure or the site. In 1876 repairs were ordered to be executed to the telegraph station at Fao at a cost of about Rs. 2,500. But the General a., April 1876, Nos. 22-25. Telegraph Department did not propose to recover any portion of it from the Turkish Government, as it would be expended on the British half of the station only. If the whole station had been repaired, one-half of the cost would be debitable ^to the Turkish Government under the terms of the Convention of 1864. In 1888 the Telegraph Department proceeded to make the following repairs to the station, which they considered abso- External A., July 1888, Nos. 364-386-A. necessar y _ (i) to strengthen the compound wall with stone and mud, in order to prevent the buildings from being flooded.

In 1885 and 1887 the mud buildings had been destroyed by floods. Stones were brought by boats from Bushire to Fao for these purposes, but objections were raised by the local Turkish authorities to their lan ing. The matter had to be referred to Constantinople, and after correspondency extending over three years, the dimcuU.'^s Exterrai, February 1891, Nos. 10-23. were sett | e d amicably and the Wali of Basrah gave the required permission on all the points put forward by the Tele- graph Department, namely:— (i) To repair the existing mud buildings with stone.

In 1901 a proposal was made by the Resident, at the instance of Captain Hare, that the Residency Surgeon at Bushire should be granted an allowance of Rs. 100 a month for medical charge of the Telegraph Staff at Reshire and that he should be entrusted with the control of the medical and sanitary arrange ments at Jask and Fao. As, however, the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department was of opinion that the arrangements hitherto in force had worked satisfactorily, the Government of India decided not to make any alterations (Foreign Department letter No. 379-E.A., dated 17th February 1902).PART V—CHAPTER XX. 81 CHAPTER XX.

The Government of India agree with General Loch that, as the Chiefs, where indeed any recognised Chiefs are to be found, possess very little real control over their tribesmen, it is not advisable to enter into agreements with them for the protection of wrecks, which, in all probability, they would be unable to carry out. Owing, too, to the great dissimilarity, in the circumstances of different wrecks, and in the amount of protection and assistance required, it also seems undesirable to lay down any hard-and-fast system of shares on account of salvage, such as that described by Lieutenant-Colonel Miles in the concluding paragraph of his memorandum. 3. Under these circumstances, it appears to the Government of India that the only feasible system of enlisting the good-will and interest of the tribes in the business of saving life and property from wrecks is that described in paragraphs 13 and 14 of General Loch's letter, viz., that the Government should give suitable and liberal presents in each case according to its merits. The Political Agent should, as far as possible, keep up a constant and friendly communication with the tribes along the coast, who should be distinctly made to understand that in every case of a British vessel being wrecked, if kindness is shown to the crew, and wreck and cargo are protected, th^ British Govern ment will remunerate them, otherwise they will, if possible, be punished. General Loch is also of opinion that it would have a very good effect if, on every occasion of a wreck taking place, a man-of-war were despatched to the spot. 4. It is not, however, intended that this system of rewards should be of universal application. The Political Agent will, of course, use his influence on every occasion to ensure the good behaviour of the tribes; but the Government of India are not prepared to remunerate the Chiefs out of Indian revenues for other than wrecks of British vessels. So, too, even with regard to British wrecks, reward should be paid with discrimination and only in important cases. Owners and masters of vessels should, as far as possible, be encouraged to pay their own salvage by allowing the salvors a share of the property saved, as is done in the neighbourhood of Aden. But the amount of this share cannot be fixed beforehand, and each case must be decided on its merits. It is believed that if once the relations between the Political Agent and the Chiefs are placed on a thoroughly friend ly footing, and if the Chiefs are taught by experience the danger of indiscriminate plunder ing, there will probably be no difficulty in inducing both them and the owners and masters of vessels to agree to terras that will be fair and equitable to both parties. c163fdPART V—CHAPTER XXI. 83 CHAPTER XXI. New system of registration of native-owned vessels in the Gulfs of Persia and Oman, 1883-84. In 1881 Colonel Ross represented to the Government of India that the vessels engaged in the pearl fishery and in A Political e., August 1883, Nos. 181-199 (and t rac i e generally on the Persian Gulf litto- counter mar s. ra l ) when owned by British Indian subjects or by the subjects of Native States in India, although entitled to British protec tion, were unable, owing to the difficulty of visiting regular ports of registry, to obtain certificates under the Merchant Shipping Acts, and that their right to fly the British flag was therefore open to challenge. On the first consideration of this question, the Government of India were „ - disposed to think that it would be desir- A Political E.. August 1883, Nos. 181-199. ui 4. * 4.-4. i. ^ r • &lt;. • able to institute a port of registry in the Persian Gulf, at which arrangements could be made for the registration of vessels under the Merchant Shipping Acts, and that legislation might be necessary for this purpose. But before recommending this course they consulted the Maritime Governments in India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in their Resolution No. 4369, of the 16th October 1882. The replies received led the Government of India to doubt the necessity of recommending to Her Majesty's Government the course of legislation which they had at first contemplated. Moreover, the reply of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf drew their atten tion to a form of certificate which the Consuls on the west coast of Africa, and the Consul-General at Constantinople, bad been authorised by the Board of Trade to grant to vessels trading locally, the owners of which laboured under disadvantages similar to those experienced in the Persian Gulf. The Government of India were of opinion that the difficulty to which their attention was drawn by Colonel Ross might be conveniently met by the delegation to the Political Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, and to the Political Agent and Consul at Maskat, of authority to grant certificates somewhat similar to those authorised by the Board of Trade on the west coast of Africa and at Constantinople. They believed that the authority for the grant of such certificates could be given by them as an act of executive administration, without any necessity for legislation ; but, before giving such authority, they desired to be assured that the certificates would be duly recognised by the Naval and Consular Officers of Her Majesty's Government concerned (Despatch to the Secretary of State, No, 93 Political, dated 3rd August 1883). The Secretary of State being stated that there was no objection to the issue of certificates as proposed, the A Political e ^, June 1884, Nos. 125-138. following notification was issued by the E''- 1 A - ■ 884 ' N&lt;&gt;s - s - 5&amp; Government of India No. 2394-E., dated 23rd August 1884. Notification by the Government of India, Foreign Department. The Governor-General in Council has been pleased to approve of the following regu* lations under which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Maskat are authorised to grant certificates on certain conditions to owners of unregistered vessels belonging to the Indian subjects of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress or to the subjects of Native Chiefs of India in subordinate alliance with the Government of India trading within the limits of the Gulfs of Persia and Oman from the vicinity of Mohammerah on the Karun to Gwadar on the Mekran Coast on the one side and from the vicinity of Basrah on the Shat-ul-Arab to Ras Sajir or Sair on the Arabian Coast on the other. These certificates will be recognized as passes by Her Majesty's Consular and Naval officers, and by all British authorities to whom they may be exhibited. A.-—The certificate or pass is to be granted only to such vessels as, by reason of their owners residing outside Indian territory or of their never visiting a port of registry, cannot obtain a proper certificate of registration.PART V—CHAPTER XXI. 84 B.—Before issuing any such certificate or pass the Consul is to satisfy himself, by such evidence as he may be able to procure, that the vessel is owned in the manner des cribed in the preamble, and is lawfully employed. This evidence should be taken down in writing and signed by the person or persons giving it. C.—A copy of the certificate or pass, with the written evidence annexed, should in each case be sent to the Foreign Department of the Government of India for transmission to Her Majesty's Board of Trade to be recorded. D.—The certificate is to be given in the following form Form of certificate. Certificate for unregistered vessels plying or trading within the limits of the Gulfs of Persia and Oman from the vicinity of Mohammerah on the Karun to Gwadar on the Mek- ran Coast on the one side and from the vicinity of Basrah on the Shat-uI-Arab to Ras Sajir or Sair on the Arabian Coast on the other Name of vessels of tons.
