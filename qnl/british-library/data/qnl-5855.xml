The Regulations have been proposed by His Excellency the Shaikh, amended in consultation with me on your instructions and finally approved by him in writing.

His Excellency wishes to keep the system as simple as possible in order that there may be less chance of it breaking down.

I shall meet Yusuf again on July 16th before he leaves for Riadh when I propose to refer point again. May I inform him that smuggling over Saudi Iraq frontier is no concern of Kuwait Government.

Letter then refers to points raised orally with me by Yusuf Yasin regarding possiblities of evasion by persons tak ing O oeds ostensibly for Iraq but actually smuggled to Saudi Arabia. Although only solution would be for Kuwait to inform Saudi Arabia of all goods leaving nuwait vdietner for Saudi Arabia or elsewhere, nevertheless in order not to indispose Government of Kuwait by making such a request letter suggests modification of Article I„ The following, slightly condensed, is text proposed to modify article one. begins.

No Bedouin shall be allowed to carry goods from Koweit except by special written permission by Saudi frontier official showing kind of goods to be purchased. Such .bedouins should leave Koweit in caravans and should carry manif e st s. Ends. 3. SciUdi Government consider it necessary that there should be agreement as to 'manner' of punishment of srmgj.ers when Kuwaiti subjects and when Saudi subjects. 4. Regarding, goods leaving Kuwait by sea, boat owners on return to Kuwait snould be in possession of certificate to prove tnat goods carried to Saudi Arabian ports actually reached their destination. — —a*of Notes and witn vviioni Notes would be excnanged on behalf of Kuwait. It enquires whether Lis Majesty’s Governriont agree to follow up agreement with a confidential letter embodying their guarantee. 6.

It is note! that a letter follows by bag but ore sum in g that there is no point uncovered by the telegram L suggest that trie following amendment of the Saudi Arab Amendment of article 1 of the Regulations should be proposed to the Shaikh when seeking his reactions to the present Saudi Arab prooosals. As they stand they will certainly not be acceptable to him for the reasons stated below. His Excellency is sometimes a little at a loss in drafting regulations and it is best to give him something to meet the case to which he can agree in in a few words or with very slight amendments The para 2 of telegram antepenultimate sentence before the ertence. After ' any person 51 insert 'with the caravan' meant) (If this, as I think is what is Para 2 of telegram antenenu l tlmate sentence . This is nearly a return to the unacceptable condition made by the Saudi Arab delegates last summer, making the rules in effect applicable to even individuals. It is mainfestly on a 'ay open frontier impossible for the Shaikh to prevent 'every BeduinJ carrying goods without manifest The only way to e^iect thAt would be to issue manifests for every single individual shopping in Kuwait including those living immediately outside Kuwait walls which is ridiculous and literally impossible. Imagine the traffic blocks. I would suggest that the sentence suggested to the Shaikh as a possible alternative should be as follows 'The Shaikh of Kuwait recogniges that it is the aim of these regulations that every Bedouin purchaser of goods in Kuwait territory leaving Kuwait territory for Saudi Arabia shall carry a manifest, travel by the recognised routes, and in a caravan at such times as may 7 /Vbe specified . The shaikh of Kuwait however cannot guarantee to prevent for example single and very poor Bedouins perhaps camped on the frontier £x® rax aura ding or in the process of moving one way or the other across it, from , evading the regulations from time to tine ; /&gt;■ such instances increasing to a point where the soirit in which these regulations are framed i L -« j violated he ^ou-ld take action under the regulations to reduce the ■oractice.” With regard to para 3 of the telegram, I suggest that 1 discuss this with the Shaikh and endeavour to elecit some idea of the scale or manner of punishment. Para 4 seems to present nothing inaccertable. Para p No comment by me would seem to be required. Para 7 Speaking generally, as apart from the matters of princiole the concern of H.B.M* s Government such an arrangement would apnear to toe advantageous and probably acceptable to the Shaikh; if somewhat of a luxury for his diminitive domain.No. R 2 SIND CLUB, KARACHI.

'iiie 17th October 19S6 lMo.C-298. From Captain G.S.de Gaury, M.C., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon 1 hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire. KUWAIT - BIDCKADIS. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter i^o.C-195 of the 2nd October 1936 and to say that I have ascertained His -hccellency the Shaiich*s reactions to the first four paragraphs of the Saudi Sot© and that he has in this connecticc written to me a letter a copy of which is attached, 2. On handing His liixoellenoy the copy of the first four paragraphs of the Saudi Rote I pointed to what I said was an obvious slip in drafting in the penultimate sentence of para 2 of the note, f *1^ The sentence beginning bedouin” as it stood would mean if accepted, that no Bedouin even a Kuwaiti camped within two miles of the walls, could leave Kuwait without a pass from a Saudi Arab official. His Axcellenoy on reading it said immediately T, Not a slip but intent!onal^ , His j&amp;acoellency in conversation later informed me that he feared that Ibn Baud instead of being content with the quite adequate regulations devised was, by an amendment, trying to achieve not simply the end of the blockade but increased influence and control over Kuwait. 3 . His demand for an official to accompany the caravans was he thought dictated by this reason. Host caravans would start from Wejd, and Saudi Arab caravancaravan ofxicials would, thus predominate over the Kuwait ones in Kuwait, and soon he feared be unnecessarily officious in the exercise of their duties. Agreement to such a condition would also probably encourage the Iraq Government to press anew for their Customs Officer to be established in Kuwait. 4. Pare. 6 of His Excellency’s reply attached seems reasonable. It would be inhuman to turn such poor creatures away. Ibn oaud, His Excellency thinks, here again sees a means of forcing the Ghaikh of Kuwait into carrying out, as if he were subordinate to Ibn Saud, what is his, Ibn Baud’s, own affair; the control of those from within his frontiers, who may wish to cross it either for legal or illegal purposes. His majesty as is well known already s- does so most effectively when he wishes. 5. Para 7 of His Excellency’s letter seems reasonable. An additional reason for having more frequent caravans is that camels often find only poor grazing near the walls here and caravans should therefore be free to leave as early as possible after being ready . Perhaps caravans twice a week would be suitable, if there must be fixed times. 6. With regard to the matter of punishment His Excellency informs that on acceptance oi the Eegulations he is willing to agree to anything reasonable which His Majesty would apply to his own subjects. 7 # i n short His Excellency’s reaction to the note is this. He maintains that in return for a reasonable proposal, which would end the blockade and safeguard both parties the Hote batrays an anxiety to achieve more and gain what the blockade itself was perhaps largely designed to gain, i.a.l.a. a degree of iiaudi control over Kuwait. 8. His Excellency thought from what he had heard that it was however only an attempt and that Ibn Saud was in reality prepared to agree to the original draft, if necessary, and particularly at the present time, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait. ¥ ; i 81■ ! ' 'Xfe ! i’ranslation of a confidential letter No. li- 5 / 251 , dated the 22nd Hajab 1355, corresponding to the 8th October 1936, from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After Compliments, I have tlie honour to reply to your letter Ho.C-286 dated the 17th Bajab lo55 (5.10.56), enbociying contents of the communication received from His Majesty King Abdul Aziz as- Saud uh rough His Majesty* a Government, in connection with the Regulations for the Opening of Trade between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which I have well understood. 1 would like to inform you that I appreciate the spirit of sympathy and amity shown during the discussions. At the same time I highly appreciate the great efforts that are being made by His Majesty’s Government to get *h© to success the question of ’’Musabala” between Saudi Arabia I and Kuwait. ^ 3. I assure to your Excellency that the proposals contained in the regulations forwarded under cover of my letter Ho.R-5/67, dated the 23rd Safer 1355 (14.5.36), will &gt;] suffice to meet the case for safeguarding the interests of both sides. X again assure to your Excellency that I shall not fail to do the best in my power to protect the rights of all by all possible and effective means. 4 # As for the supposition that there might be some people who would export goods in the name of ’Iraq, but who would smuggle them into Saudi Arabia or elsewhere, this very unlikely. Moreover, both ours as well as Saudi Arab officials will be able to keep strict observation over such attempts. Nevertheless, X consider that it is very unlikely that such a matter will arise, because it would be impracticable 5./5. As for the mention in the above communication that every caravan should be accompanied by a special offi cial to the first province, and that such official should hold a list containing the number of camels of the caravan and the names of the Persons thereof; should there be among them some person or persons whose names are not included in the list, and who carry goods with them, we would naturally consider them as smugglers, and that they should receive deterrent punishments* But I see no necessity for sending a special official in company with the caravan. The best way would be that the Head of the caravan should be made directly responsible for his caravan. At the same time there should be a strict observation by the officials of both sides. Above all the triplicate manifest will exactly include ^ ( all the goods, large and small, carried by the caravan, V This will be a sufficient substitute for the company of any special official and any bill beside the abovementioned manifests, 6. In connection with the 'Musabala' (Shopping or restocking) of the bedouins, I have no objection to their carrying papers from the Saudi Arab Posts or Stations. #'c But in case of the arrival in Kuwait of individuals or parties of bedouins who could not conveniently call at the abovementioned Stations, for the purpose of taking their provisions from Kuwait, it 'would not be of any good for either side to prevent such poor bedouins from taking their provisions. 7 . x should also like to draw your attention to the fact that limiting the number of journeys for caravans and notifying the Government of their departure would be a hindrance to the circulation of business dealings, ana would affeot the state of supply and demand in undue proportion particularly to small traders who are the great majority. I trust that you will sympathize with me in the idea ofidea of avoiding anything which would tend to generate commercial distress of the public. 8* As to the suggestion that there should be an agreement about the manner in which smugglers should be punished when they are Kuwait subjects, and the manner in which smugglers should be punished when they are Saudi subjects, such an agreement will be quite possible in the end. 9. as to what would be exported from Kuwait by sea to the Saudi Arab ports, owners of the boats shall be bound to bring the necessary certificates to prove that the goods they carried arrived at their destination.

The Resident asked what were your views if the Saudi Government meant that caravans should he accompa nied hy Kuwaiti officials. Your Excellency said that you did not see any useful object in this proposal, as the caravan leaders would he provided with manifests from which the goods with the caravan could easily he checked, However, if the Saudi Government laid store hy this you were prepared to agree, at any rate for the trial period of six months which is mentioned helow. B. With regard to the Saudi proposal to limit the numoer of caravans per month. Your Excellency stated in paragraph 7 of your letter quoted above that the limitation of caravans would hinder trade. The Resident is of the opinion that some limitation of caravans is necessary for the working of the system, hut that their number is a detail which can he settled according to requirements of trade when the Agreement came into force. C. That no Bedouin should be allowed to carry goods from Kuwait unless they hold a special written permission from the Saudi frontier official con eerned^ alsp_that such Bedouin should leav e Kuwait in carav ans,.

However Your Excellency was prepared to give a pledge that on this point, as on all others, you were prepared to do in your utmost to see that smuggling did not occur. In this connection Your Excellency pointed out that you and you^ officials knew what the needs of the Bedouin were, and could check any excessive purchases which might he made with intent to smuggle. D. The Saudi suggestion that there should he an agreement about the manner in which smugglers should he pu nished^ when they are Kuwaiti subjects ani the manner in which smugglers should he punished v/hen they are Saudi subjects • Your Excellency's reply to this was that naturally the extent or the penalty would depend on the magni- tute of the offence, and that you would use your discretion In inflicting suitable punishments.

INDIA ODPICEj V/HITEHALD^ S c ViTo 1 2nd June^ 1937. Dear Brena^ I enclose herewith two copies of the revised Saudi howe 1 1 Anti-Smuggling Regulations as they emerged after our meeting with de Gaury last Saturday. We agree that the next step might be to show the revised version tentatively to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, making it clear that His Majesty’s Government are in no Y;ay committed to it as it has not yet been communicated to the Sheikh of Eoweit so that we do not yet know v/hether he will accept it though we think that there is a greater chance of his doing so in the modified form. If Sheikh Yusuf Yasin raises no objection to the modifications the way will then be clear (subject to any observations which Powle may have to offer) for an approach to the Sheikh of Koweit. The method of approach to the latter will of course require careful consideration, particularly in view of the Saudi insistence that there should bo also a Treaty of Extradition and a Treaty of Rnendship and Bon yoismage, but this can be left for consideration until we know whether the revised version is acceptable to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. We presume that in the draft Article 1 ”caravan' includes motor car, as transport by motor car is conoempla g cd in Article 3. Perhaps this should 'be mentioned to iusuj. Yasin.

Persons entering Kuwait Territory from Saudi Arabia and taking out goods bought for their personal consumption, whether they arc nomad or settled, must travel m parties anc. conform to the conditions laid down for commercial cara/ans* Goods which leave Kuwait Territory for oaudi Arabia by sea must be taken to the Saudi Arab port specified in the manifest, and the person holding the manifest must report uo the proper authorities at that port* T,ae provioiono aooul smuggling contained in the present regulations snail be applicable to goods transported oy sea and to tno peioOno transporting them.

This manifest must accompany the goods, and a copy of it shall be given tne Saudi Trade/ft 2c Trade Agent in Kuwait by the Kuwait Customs Office before the caravan (or party) leaves Kuwait Territory and a third copy of the manifest shall be kept in the Manifest Office. It is forbidden to take a quantity greater or less than that shown in the manifest or to go to any destination other than that mentioned in the manifest or by any route other than the ordinary one.

In both cases he shall be liable to a line. Article 5 . Heads of caravans and holders of manifests must report to the nearest post any evasion or infraction of theoe regulations which cane to their knowledge, otherwise they themselves shall be held responsible if the evasion comes to light. Article 6 .

His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Indi a,London, Governiaent of India, Simla, (?Bushire) , Kuwait, Jedda, 1758. 28th June 1937. Please refer to Jeddah despa tch 77 dated April 25th 1937, and connected correspondence enclosed with India Office weekly Air Mail letter No.24 of June 16th 1937, regarding the Saudi Kuwait Blockade. The revised draft regulations proposed by Saudi Arabia Government have been examined in collaboration with Political, Kuwait. His Majesty’s Government’s provisional view (?is that) Saudi Draft goes a long way towards meeting Shaikh of Kuwait’s point of view and may well prove acceptable to him particularly if presented in form of suggested draft which forms an enclosure to India Office letter F.0.No.P.2.3458/37, dated the 2nd June 193 7. It will be understood that no attempt ba s been made to make Regulations word perfect. Subject therefore to any observations which you and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may have to offer we should now take action on the following* lines. The Political Agent, Kuwait diould be instructed to take an early opportunity of the revised version to ohaikh explaining that though it differ slightly of form, but not in substance from version put forward by the oaudi Arabia Governnent. “is Majesty’s Government see no reason to anticipate that will raise any objectio to its ?- 2 - If as is hoped Shaikh is willing to accept the revised version next stepwill be to ascertain his reaction to proposal of Saudi Arab Government that in addi tion to Trade Agreement there should also be agreement relating to Extradition and Bon Voisinage* The Saudi Arabia with regard to __ .. have made it percectly plain that they regard it as indispensable that three agreements should ?come into force and His Majesty’s Government see no _____ but even of ending present contracted blockade unless discreet acceptance, Prima facie their attitude is not unreasonable and in view o 3 securing early resumption normal relations between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Mis Majesty’s Government t consider that every effort should be made to induce Shaikh to accept Saudi Government proposal. It is understood Saudi Arab Government contemplate that additional agreements should be on the lines of (?those) between Saudi Arabia and Iraq (see ender enclosures to to India Office and Resident ufide^/despatch of i.xay 6th, 1931,/copy forwarded to Government of India with India Office weekly letter Z 23 of June4th 1931 (copy was sent direct to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and copy is now being sent by air mail to Political Agent, Kuwait, His Majesty’s Government see no reason (?objectioii to the adoption of Extradition Agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq as a basis for discussion of a similar agreement between Saudi Apobia and Kuwait, The treaty of Bon Voisinage between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait appears to contain significance that would be objectionable to His Majesty’s Government frcm the point of view of its inclusion in agreement between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in particular ? ? attention ? Article 2, . si 1co ns ular - 3 - its Article 2 , which deals with diplomatic and consular relations* v*/hile therefore it is possible that the Shaikh is already aware of the geneous terms between his two neighbouring powers, His majesty’s Governnent do not consider that he should be shown treaties in Questi on or be given any hint that Saudi Arab Government are of the opinion of putting the suggestion that these treaties should be adopted as a basis for discussion. For the present purpose it will perhaps be sufficient if treaties are explained to Shaikh in general terms and if he agrees in principle to the actual terms thereof can be takai with Saudi Arab Government. if you and Political Resident agree with this view Political Agent, xiuwait might be instructed to approach Shaikh accordingly* As regards form which agreement eventually reached should take please see Foreign Office telegram 73 dated July 8th 1936, addressed to Jedda (repeated Bushire, 13) copy enclosed with India Off i ce* • U ^ weekly letter by air mail No*32, dated August 5th 1936and telegram 571, August 4th 1936 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf might however be still of the opinion that agreement should be recorded as an Anglo-Saudi exchange of notes and they consider some procedure should be adopted in the case proposed agreements relating to extradition ana Bon Voisinage. it is of course impossible to predict what reactions Shaikh’s are likely to be to this suggestion that His Majesty’s Government are inclined to think of now. Contemplated agreements embodied in Angxo- Saudi exchange of notes. If you agree, His Majesty's Govern, ment are content to (?leave) the time and method of approach to the local political (?authori ties) in principle.?? !Telegram S.(Pre: in Q).

Before he left Bagdad Nuri Pasha discussed with me in detail the ^ ,&lt;ter ' ' ’ n - AT ^ ^ i-1 , • — ±y\ji ui ±±&amp; ±^j- u ^ —~ # — —~ ^^uan me questions that he proposed to raise with the Hejaz-Nejd Government. These H,! were— (i) The “ Bon-Voisinage ” Treaty and Arbitration Protocol, (ii) Extradition. (xii) Ibn Mashhur. (iv) The payment by the Hejaz-Nejd Government of the balance of £23,(T outstanding on account of Iraq tribal claims. ^ a: reP 0 , froni ,, 118 , Nuri Pasha told me that he had no intention of discussing the project of a - ( i pan-Arab alliance, except in so far as measures for the removal of customs and I^v passport barriers, which he intended to propose, could be said to further this . 1 ^ proj ect. Tie also informed me of his intention to send Taha-al-Hashimi, the chief of — — — - J '-'AXAVyJ. VJ 1 the General Staff, on a mission to the Imam of Yemen, and undertook, on my suggestion, to acquaint King Ibn Baud with his intention first, and to ensure that His Majesty had no objection. Finally, in view of Sir John Shuckburgh’s demi-official letter, dated the 12 th November, 1930, I asked Nuri Pasha to ascertain whether King Ibn Sand still harboured any resentment in regard to the appointment of Dr. Abdullah Damluji as Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. 4. As regards the instruments signed by Nuri Pasha at Mecca, your Lordship will observe that the texts of the “ Bon-Voisinage ” Treaty and Arbitration Protocol correspond closely to the texts initialled in Bagdad a year ago. Such amendments as have been made conform generally to advice tendered by this High Commission. The exceptions are the incorporation in the preamble ^ of a somewhat obscure paragraph referring to “ the desire of their Majesties to exert every possible effort to compose the affairs of the Arab nation and unite her word,' and the insertion in article 13 of the words or nationals of the two :A r v contracting parties.' The former amendment, which seems innocuous, maybe i 4 iM attributable to a desire on the part of Nuri Pasha to justify the declaration made jiffiej before his departure of his intention to promote the cause of Arab unity. The woft second amendment, which extends to Iraq and Nejd nationals the restrictionsliof til which in the original draft were applicable only to foreigners, appears, at first sight, to conflict with article 6 , which provides for complete freedom of movement igreg&lt;j of tribes for grazing purposes. I am advised, however, that the specific obliga- tepresen tion involved in article 6 would be considered as overriding the general 'giofF prohibition contained in article 13. 5. The Extradition Treaty provides in article 3 that the surrender of political offenders shall not be permissible. At the same time, as your Lordship will observe from the notes exchanged between Nuri Pasha and the Minister for foreign Affairs of the Hejaz-Nejd Government, the former has given an assurance that offences normally committed by Bedouin tribesmen fall within the category of extraditable offences and cannot be described as political. I see no objection to the nature of the assurance given by Nuri Pasha, and I consider that he is to be congratulated on having settled this vexed question, which has disturbed relations between Iraq and Nejd for many years. - ^Isiest o' .^ S re S arc ^ s the Ibn Mashhur affair, Nuri Pasha informs me that King r Ibn baud is now cpiite satisfied, and that with the surrender of his family and property the affair will be considered closed. This is confirmed by His Majesty’s letter to myself. J J J aajes 7. In regard to the balance of £23,000 outstanding in respect of the compensation to be paid by the Hejaz-Nejd Government for the Iraq tribes, Nuri %% Pasha informed me that King Ibn Sand did n(S aftempT to deny the 'obligation ^ to pay the amount in full. His Majesty explained, however, that owing to a temporary lack of ready money it would be necessary for him to borrow the Pasha leplied that, in the circumstances, he would not press for immediate pay ment, and asked that the balance due might be remitted to Bagdad in the course of the next two months.■ l * / 127 n r \bdullah Damluji, His Majesty was quite reconciled to the appointment of his former Minister to the Iraq Foreign Office, and did not desire to raise any obiection on that scoie. 9 . So far as I am able to judge at present, Nuri Pasha’s visit to the Hejaz seems to have been an unqualified success, and augurs well for the Iraqi Govern- rngnt’s ability to control their relations with neighbouring States. I lost no ' J, ' T ie on the return of Nuri Pasha to Bagdad in conveying to him the message of congratulation from Flis Majesty's Government contained in your Lordship’s telegram No. 148, dated the 19th April, 1931, a message which, as I have already leporte’ id tof r i io. alof I Chill -Livy. » • O &gt; ^ reported to your Lordship, he greatly appreciated.

KUVAIT BLQCKJiDE, Sir, / A / '7'/ n I have the honour to forward copies of letters which have passed between His Highness and myself on the subject of the Trade Regulations an$ the proposed agreements between Saudi Arabia ahd Kuwait, consequent upon receipt of your telegram No*746 of the 16th July 1927 2 0 You will see that His Highness accepts the principle of Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements being linked with the Trade Agreement and embodied in an Anglo-r gaudi exchange of notes* ^' 3 # In the case of the Trade Agreement he has a proviso to make, because he i s somewhat doubtful as to the definition of caravan, (see India Office letter No. P*Z*2438/27 of the 2nd June, 1937 in which Mr.bymon expresses doubt also)* 4 , His Highness in discussing thi s with me said that all traders would be despatched together, in caravan. It might, however, and almost certainly vould, occur, that whan there has been no large caravan to Central Arabia for some little time with certain commodities, and the demand and price was increasing- 2 - inoreasing in consequence, smil traders would want to take the opportunity to hurry off with what was available. They might muster only a few camels or say two cars* Would this be a caravan? 5* He believed that with goodwill ann in practice, once the scheme was working there would be no difficulty, but he also felt bound to mention this, and make the proviso given in his letter, para 1, so that junior officials might not, in their zeal, fasten on to what was probably an unavoidable indefiniteness and turn back a small caravan. / 6* In a separate despatch numbered C-194 and dated 5th August 1937, I have submitted drafts which may serve as a basis for the Bon Voisinage and liixtradition Agreements.

The so-called “residence visas'* appear to be permits issued by the Baudi authorities to Caudi subjects - and not to Kuwaitis or subjects of any foreign state - allowing them to reside in Kuwait. They are therefore not of the nature of visas at all, a visa being an endorsement on a foreigners travel papers allowing him to enter or leave the country of the visa-issuing authority. They are presumably required by Ibn Saud to enaole him to keep a check on the identity and number oi his subjects resident in Kuwait, and we nave no locus standi for questioning them.

After consultation with Fowie, we are inclined to think that the next step should be to let the Saudi Government know that the Sheikh of Howe it accepts the principle of Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements being linked with the Trade Agreement, and at the same time to ascertain whether they are prepared, at the appropriate moment, to sign a Tra.de Agreement in the form accepted by the Sheikh. If the Saudi Government accept the Revised Draft Trade agreement the question of the other Agreements can be taken up. Fowie thinks, and we agree, that it would be better to try and obtain complete agreement about the Trade Regulations before going too deeply into the question of the Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreemenuo. 3./ l • V. Brenan, Esq., 0 .B.E. Foreign Office, 3.7. 1 . 93 .

Treaty of Friendship between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. as Re Captain de Gaury T s draft: Article 1 is the same mutatis mutandis Article 1 of the Iraq Saudi Arabia Treaty. No comments. (Article 2 of the Iraq Saudi Arabia Treaty is not applicable to Kuwait.) Articles 2 and 3 are the same as Articles 3 and 4 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. No comments. Article 4 is the same as Article 5 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. For comments see below. Article 5 is the same as Article 6 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty,except naturally for the opening sentence down to 'Bahra Agreement”. See comments below. Articles 6 and 7 are the same as Articles 7 and 8 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. See comments below. Article 8 is the same as Article 9 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. Sefi-comments below. Article 9 is the same as Article 10 of the Iraq S^udi Treaty down to ^’respective governments for decision”. Thereafter the exception noted in the Iraq Saudi clause under the Bahra agreement is naturally left out. No comments. (Article 11 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty is not applicable to Kuwait)• Article 10 is the same as article 12 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. No commeI Article 11. Down to 'without obtaining previous permission' this article is the same as Article 13 of the Iraq S P udi Treaty. A further reference to the Bahra Agreement in article 13 is naturally left out of Article 11 which goes on 'subject to the provisions ' down to 'by its permission'. In Article 11 I think that after 'previous permission' might be added 'from the Authorities referred to in Article 7'. T^e sentence in Article 11 'subject to the provisions by its permission' might be left out. So far as I know there are no other agreements concluded between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. (Article 14 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty is not applicable to Kuwait)• Article IS is the same as Article 15 of the Iraq S s udi Treaty down to 'concluded between them'. Thereafter H.M»G. are made the arbitrators. The provisions of Article 16 of the Iro.q S&amp;udi Treaty are not provided for by Captainde Gaury. Some such final article would have to be added to the Kuwait Saudi Treaty and would, I suppose, record the fact that the treaty was being made by H.M.G. on behalf of Kuwait. s. in addition to the above remarks my general feeling about Captain de Gaury's draft is that we do not come at all into the picture. (1) Article 4. As you are aware we attach lonsiderable importance to preventing the Shaikh from laving direct correspondence with Il?n S a ud but Article l gives the right to both parties to notify (i.e. correspond with) each other on certain matters.

There would seem to be two ways in which we can come into the picture in regard to this article:- (a) by inserting in the clause a proviso that correspondence between the Shaikh and the Saudi Government should pass through he Political Agent in Kuwait or (b) by arranging writh the Shaikh that all such correspondence should be shown to the Political Agent. (g) Article 5. 'Musabila' is one of the obstacles from the Saudi point of view, to the Trade Agreement. However there is no objection to mention of Musabil^a for the present in the draft. ^ 2 ^ Article 7. I think we ought to associate the Political Agent somehow' or other with the TT competent authorities”. As a precedent for this you will remember that the Political Agent, Kuwait, was recently assocxatea with an official of the Iraq Government in the investigation of certain Kuwait Iraq frontier incidents. In order to s cure this assocxtion a proviso to that effect woiM have to be inserted in this claus e. (4) Article 8. Similarly we ought to associate the Political Agent with the Frontxer Commission especially in view of the wide scope of this Commission4. Conunission as laid down in Article 9. In insisting with the Shaikh and the Saudi Gov ernment that we should be associated in some form or other with the activities on which the success of the Treaty would largely depend we are, I think, on strong ground* in the first place the Treaty will be made on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait by H*M.G* who are responsible for the foreign relations of Kuwait, in the second place in case of serious differences over the implementing of the T r eaty arising between the Shaikh and the Saudi Government the latter wil undoubtedly apply to us for assistance, and we would be in a much better position to smooth matters over is we had been kept informed by the Political Agent of the rights and w-rongs of the matter in dispute from the beginning. Further the political Agent by being associated with the Frontier authorities will often be able to influence both sides to settle questions amicable on the spot. 4. We might discuss the whole treaty question some time. Sd. T.C. Fowle. 11 . 10 . \«-• I am keeping a copy of this for Bushire file. Sd. T * C. Fowle, Mr. Symon. In continuation of my previous note of the 11th October on the subject of the Kuwait Saudi Treaty of Friend on ip herev.ith my comments on Captain de Gdury^s draft of the Kuwait Saudi Extradition Treaty. Articles 1 to 3 are mntatis mutandis the same as the corresponding articles of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. Article 3 seems to cover offences, i.e. brigandage theft, etc.,which are so far as I know not generally considered as 'political' offences (see first sentence /Xe” of tliis article). I Thlftk/Offdnces covered by this article might be restricted (see my comments in para.2 below). Article 4. The demand for extradition by either Government has to be made through EUM.G T s. representatives. This is quite correct and short circuits direct correspondence between Ihn Saud and the Shaikh. (Since both Governments in so far as demands for extradition are concerned are covered by Article 4 there is no need for an article In the Kuwait Saudi Treaty corresponding to Article 5 of the Iraq Saudi Tp ea -ty.) Articles 5 and 6 are the same as Articles 6 and 7 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. Article 3 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. There is no corresponding article in Captain de Gaury’s draft. This article contains the important proviso that the treaty shall remain in force for a period of three years, after which it can be abrogated by either side. In the Iraq Saudi Treaty of Friendship no time limit is laid down. 2# X ^st confess I do not feel very happy over there being an Extradition Treaty at all between Kuwait and Saudi;1 L ,i f V ? 2. Saudi Arabia. As you are aware political refugees from the Saudi Government take refuge in Kuwait not necessarily lLi in he town but amongst^Bedouin in Kuwait territory, in order to get these individuals extradited the S&amp;udi Government will probably trump up offences of brigandage etc. against the refugees. The Shaikh may refuse to deliver 4p the persons concerned and we shall inevitably be drawn into the squabble. I think, therefore, in order to minimise this risk that the definition of political offences in Article 3 (see my comments above) might be considerably narrowed. Sd. T.C.

The Jedda customs authorities state, in reply to oral enquiries, that the regulation is only meant to apply to goods entering Saudi territory by a land frontier and not to merchandise arriving by sea. It is true that the wording is general, out the importers of .goods from overseas, both foreign and Saudi, are taking no notice of the regulation, and I am satisfied that it can be ignored except in so far as goods imported by land are concerned. 3 .

You will have seen from the^.. olitical Resident 1 a telegram Jo. 54, dated the 11th (. January (copy sent to the Foreign Office on 1' th January, India Office number P.j. 236/36) that he still presses the suggestion as one that should be carried out in fairness to the Sheikh. I am asked to say that we agree with the resident's views. Even though the communication may have no practical effect on the blockade proposala we think that the Iraqis should be /tven to see that the ohei&lt;h s attitude is not entirely unaccommodating. T t Is rather difficult to understand the Embassy’s objection to to Improve the atmosphere. e hope therefore that It could not do any harm and might, one would suppose, help Eheikh’s attitude. H.L.

About a month ago 5*uad Bey told me that our latest suggestions seemed pretty satisfactory from the point of view of the and that the papers were now in the hands of the Ministry of Finance. That was bound to involve delay, as the Ministry of Finance is the bottle-neck through which all matters relating notv only to Finance but also to Defence and the Pilgrimage have to pass.

IEDIA OFFICE, v/rix 'T ii/EAijL 2 L01nD 0:\ ? S.W.l. 23rd July, 1938 Saudi Arabia - Koweit relations 5 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to invite a reference to the Express Letter addressed to him by the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 1 . 9 th September, 1937, and numbered C/232 of 1937, with which were enclosed drafts of TT bon voisinage” and extradition agreements between Saudi Arabia and Koweit for use in the negotiations for the termination of the blockade instituted by Saudi Arabia against trade ii om Kov.'Sit. 2. The drafts forwarded by Mr. Caroe have been considered in detail in consultation with the Foreign Office and with Sir Trenchard Fowls during the latter ! e period of deputation in London and I am now to forward, for the consideration of the Government of India, a copy of the drafts in the form m which, subject to their views and to any further views which the Political Resident may wish to express, His Majesty's Government consider that they should he submitted for the concurrence of the Sheikh of Koweit or for any observations which he may have to make on their deuuiled piovisiouo. 3. Of these drafts the draft 'bon voisinage' agreement, excluding the schedule, is, with one inconsiderable + • i-n +ho form in ’which Sir Trenchard Fowle concurred exception, m tne loim m while in London' in April. r £he ’’general rules forming bhe schedule to the draft were prepared subsequently by the Foreign Office on the basis of the schedule attached to the 'bon voisinage' Agreement of 1933 between Saudi Arabia and 4 . qpen by the Poj-itisul Transjordan. They have not / Secretary to the Government of India, accident,/ External Affairs Department, S iml a.2 April Resident, c ~nd if the local Political Authorities consider that any important modifications are required I am to ask that the matter may be referred to the Secretary of State. 4. the draft extradition agreement in its present form has also not yet been seen by the Political Resident, and I am to enclose lor consideration a copy of the demi-official 2973/38) letter with which it was received from the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State is content to leave it to the Government of Inaia to decide, in consultation with the Political resident, whether it is desirable to amend jy^ticle 4 in the direction indicated by the Foreign OfficeJ®and of the alternative forms of Article 7 should be adoptedj* I am to ask, however, that (as in the case of the Schedule to the n bon voisinage” agreement) reference may be made to him if in other respects any substantial modification of the draft is thought necessary. 5. It will be observed that the drafts of both agreements have been cast in the form of an agreement raade by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, ’’acting in their own name and on behalf of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit”. Explicit expression is thus given to the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of responsibility for the fulfilment of the obligations described in the agreements. This responsibility derives from the control exercised by His Majesty’s Government over the foreign affairs of Koweit by virtue of which - and in evidence of which - the present agreements are being mediated by them with the Saudi Arabian Government. I am to enquire whether in the circumstances the Government of India and the Political Resident see any objection to the proposal that His Majesty's Government, by concluding agreements with the Saudi Arabian Government in this form, should explicitly undertake responsioiiity for the /3 the fulfilment by the Sheikh of the obligations which he would assume. It would of course be most desirable that in order to ensure the discharge of H.M.G. *s responsibility for the observance of the agreements by the Sheikh ? his formal approval of the draft texts should be obtained before signature together with his undertaking to observe their provisions. It is also advisable that H.M.G. should have ^2ssss^^msmmmt '* —— - —— ^t^ *****^**™******^*^^ his request (as distinct from his authorisation) to negotiate, 11 - - ■ - ■ — ' ' ■■ ' ^ — and subsequently to conclude, the agreements on his behalf. 6. I am accordingly to request that, when the terms of the enclosed drafts have been settled as indicated in paras. 3 and 4 above, the Government of India may instruct the Political Resident to communicate the drafts to the Sheikh of Koweit, to consult him on the substance of their provisions and to seek his concurrence in H.M.G. l s proposal to negotiate with the Saudi Arabian Government on these lines. Subsequently, and before the agreements were concluded, it would be necessary, if the Government of India and the Political Resident agree to the procedure proposed in this letter, to obtain from the Sheikh a formal communioat ion, in the form of an exchange of notes with the Sheikh which would be drafted in consultation with the Foreign Office, conveying his approval of the terms, his request to H.M.G. to conclude the agreements, and his promise to carry out their provisions. It is considered desirable that at the same time he should be asked to undertake to nominate the Political Agent, Koweit, as one of the Koweit members of the Permanent Frontier Commission referred to in Article 13 of the 'bon voisinage' agreement. 7.

Arabia end Koweit, I now send you a revised draft, which we have prepared here, of the proposed Extradition agreement. We shall be happy at any time if necessary to discuss with you the texts of both these proposed agreements. 2. There Is one point which our Treaty Department have raised in connexion with Article 4 of the Extradition agreement. As the text stands In our suffice for either of the two Governments concerned to send in an authentic requisition for the surrender of a f i 1 tive offender without supporting the requisition with any legal evidence that the crime, for which extradition is oought, lias in fact been committed. There is so far as we are ©ware, no objection to this per se since we understand it is r fact that a number of countries, unhampered by legal requi j emonts such as Habeas Corous , are prepared to surrender fugitives from justice on the strength of a mere requisition. nfc may nou be practicable or desirable from the point of view of local conditions to tighten up this provision but the omission seems to invite precisely that kind of spurious requisition which Fov/le anticipates on page 4 of his note, a copy of which was attached to your letter to me of 22nd January.

Mr. Gibson, I agree tnat we can decide now to adopt draft E subject to tne following comments. 2. It will be necessary to nave tne Snaiioi’s approval in writing before tne draft is s nown to tne Saudi Government. I do not tninie tnat new ill raise objections to n.M.G. concluding tne agreement on nis benalf and it will t nen be necessary, as suggested by you, to get tne Shaikh to authorise H.M.G. to conclude it on his behalf. As I understand it, n.M.G. do not make themselves responsible that tne terms of tne agree- -ment will be kept by Kuwait. I entirely concur in this thoi^h naturally our g ood offices will be available for adjusting difficulties in an amicable manner. 3 . With regard to article 3, the appointment of Special Officials and para, 3 of Mr Symon’s note. I concur that it would be difficult to associate tne Political Agent, Kuwait, with tne day to day work of these officials and likewise tnat it would be equally difficult to withhold t he r ignt of t nese officials to correspond with each other. Inis correspondence would normally be on unimportant local matters. 4# in regard to article 13, tne Permanent Frontier Commission. My original objections to the possibility of direct correspondence between tne snaikn of Kuwait and tne Saudi Government are met by tne pnrase in s.(3) 'shall endeavour to settle tne matter by dis- - cuss ions through the .British Legation at Jedda,**. I regard/regard it as important tnat tne Political Agent should be one of tne Kuwaiti members or at any rate associated with tne Commission in some way* I daresay that as suggested by tne K*0* it may be more suitable to arrange for this association as a domestic question witntne Shaikh. between tne two Governments or Saudi Arabia and Kuwait pass 'through the British Legation at Jedda'. I presume there is no need to specifically mention the Political Resident, since tne normal channel of communication between the Shaikh of Kuwait and tne Saudi government is via tne Resident and the British Legation. I# this article is more restrictive t nan t he original one, but I do not think that we need, or indeed can, object. All Governments nave tne right to restrict tne movements of individuals across their frontiers. I have misunderstood it, seems redundant, since article y already gives the respective Governments tne rignt 01 restr i ct i on. merely of one section beginning witntne present s.2 'It shall not be lawful' down to 'of tnis agreement' t0 permit nationals of tne otner Government t o be empioy- -ed in its armed forces tnen surely it follows tnat neitner Government can compel such nationals to enlist. fne b I note that throughout tne draft communications 6 Article 9.

I thought it best in the first instance to give the Bon Yo is inage and Extradition Agreements unofficially to the Shaikh in order to test his reactions. He consulted the Council unofficially. In this connection it must be remembered that while the question of these treaties is one of external affairs, and therefore outside the scope of the council, we cannot of course prevent the Shaikh consult ing his Council concerning such questions. This in fact would be the normal procedure of Eulers in the other Arab States of the Persian Oulf, where Councils already exist, though hitherto not of the official complexion which prevails at Kuwait. 3. 4 couple of days later the Shaikh informed me unofficially that both he as d the Council were in favour of all the clauses of both treaties except the preamble in each, which the Council wished to alter as follows. Bon Voisinage / H.T.Peel gsquire, :JUC., The India Office, London.Bon Voia inage » The aov'ernment of Kuwait and the Oovemiaerit of Saudi Arabia being desirous of prorataing and maintaining friendly relations and good neighbourliness between the Government of Kuwait and the Government of Saudi Arabia have agreed as follows «- and they have for this purpose appointed authorised representatives on their behalf* ^or His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait, H*H., His Britannic Haj eaty^s Minister at Jedda, bearing the title of 3»or His Maj esty the King of Baud! Arabia -extradition . The Government of Kuwait and the Government of ^iaudi Arabia as they are desirous for completing an agreement about the extradition of offenders and fugutivea etc*etc, 4 # The Shaikh did not express his own opinion as to this suggestion of the Gouncil, &amp;nd at this stage -• did not think it advisable to ask him for it, or to express n&amp; opinion as to the Council’s emendation, 1 contented myself therefore with saying t&amp;it it was satisfactory (which of course it is) that both he aa d the Council were in favour of the terras of the treaties. With regard to the Council’s proposed amendment neither/ 5-3- naither da Qaury nor I thinic m should accept it as it obviously and publicly (the treati eu nien inade will be published) ignores the control of Us Majesty’s Government over the foreign relations of Kuwait# If His Majesty’s the matter again unofficially with tae Shai&amp;h and get the latter to endeavour to persuade the Council to withdraw their amendment# de Gaury could point out that this amendment ignores the special position of His Majesty’s Government under which the latter control the foreign relations of Kuwait, de Gaury could add that the Saudi Government themselves had recognised this position by conducting tae negotiations for the Trade Agent with His Majesty’s Govern- ment and by asking the latter to arrange for the Bon Voisinage and extradition treaties. It is quite possible that the Shaikh may be able to persuade the Council without difficulty since de Saury is of opinion that the Council’s move is probably a *try on”. If the Ghaikh succeeds in this then the way is clear for sending him an official letter as indicated below. I do not think that in tnis matter we should have any direct relations with the Council though this would not preclude a friendly talk over a cup of coffee professes to be unable to do so, then de Gaury should send him the drafts of the treaties under a brief official forwarding letter, making no mention of course of the Government concur I suggest that de Gaury should take up between de Gaury and Abdulla al G&amp;iira, the President oi the Oouncil. 6 If the Shaikh cannot persuade the Council, or unoff ic ial /unofficial conversations *Mch have tahen place. 7. 7he prospect of the lifting of the blockade and of the revival of trade with Saudi Arabia is of course extreiftdy popular in the to#n f and there is little likeli hood of the Council getting any popular support should they attempt to delay a aettlesaent over what would appear to the majority of Kuwaitis as a mere fom of words. # I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and giving one to de &lt;?aury.
