If they had been anything else but Indians this sentence would hafcs been carried out. The Indian Government has however as regards its own subjects (doubtless dating back to the time When this place was under the India Office) reserved its right through the Hist Court at Bombay to review any judgment given by this Court against Indians, The High c^rt upheld all the convictions for murder and did not in any way differentiate between the degrees of guilt of the various prisoners, however considered presumably from motives of humanity that alife for a life was sufficient and sent \ j iThis ssntence is therefore the sentence of the Bonbay \ High Court and it seems only fair as the prisoners were Indians, the Court sentencing them Indian, and the place of confinement the property of the Government of India, that the Government of India should pay the cost of the prisoner maintenance for this very long period. It is to he remembered that anything earned by these men during their incarceratic*] will presumably go to the funds of the Indian not the Zanzibar Gove rument* I would further point out that the reason suggested by Hr* Horley for the confinement Of British Indian prisoner $ in Indian prisons, viz economy, no longer exists and was not at any tine the sole reason for Indian prisoners being sent there* At that time the British to pay the Zanzibar Government so much a day for every prisoner sent to their gaol by H* B.

Sir E. Grey regrets that, notwithstanding the ar guments adduced in your letter, he is unable to concur in the view of the Secretary of State for India that the expenses incurred in this connection should be de frayed by the Zanzibar Government. He is compelled to adhere to the opinion expressed in previous correspondence that the cases of His Brit annic Majesty's Courts for Zanzibar and Siam are ana- As Mr. Secretary Morley is aware the object of the establishment of both Courts is to ensure the proper treatment of British Subjects in the countries tary of State, lnin question and this Involves not only the actual ad i i O 5 ministration of justice but also the responsibility for the treatment of prisoners after sentence, I am to point out that as imprisonment in Zanzi- 0 bar would be an undue hardship, it is in the interests O of British Indian prisoners that they should be im prisoned in India, and it would therefore appear prop er that the expense of their maintenance there should be borne by the Government of India. Sir E.

Sir:- I am directed by Secretary sir E. Grey to acknow- [ 0 n ) ledge the receipt of your letter of the llth. 1 not ant, stating that Mr. Sscrstary Morlsy sqss no rsason why the cost of the maintenance at Bombay of three British Indians condemned in Zanzibar to Penal Servitude for life should not be borne by the Protectorate, that view being based upon the contention that the cases of the Consular Court at Bangkok and the Zanzibar Court are not analogous. Sir E. Grey regrets that he is unable to share this view. I am to point out that the Court at Zanzibar was created for the purpose of insuring British subjects better justice than that obtainable in the local Courts, as in the case of the Consular Courts in Siam. The cost of the Zanzibar court is moreover borne by His Majesty’s Government, and Sir E. Grey would suggest that Under Secretary of State, India Office. ithat it is only just that when British Indian Subjects are tried in that court the Government of India should pay for the privilege. I am uo enquire, therefore, whether in the circum stances, Mr. Morley would be willing again to approach the Indian Government with a view to a reconsideration of the decision contained in your letter under reply.

The request is based on the fact that there is no prison in this Protectorate suitable to rigorous imprisonment and no work on which British Indians condemned thereto can be suitably employed. I would venture for the same reason to ask whether there would he any objection, on the part of your Government, to British Indian convicts who have been sentenced in Zanzibar to more than six months’ rigorous imprisonment being sent, at the discretion of His Majesty’s Judge, to serve their sentences in the Bombay Presidency.

Sir, We have the honour to forward herewith copies of the correspondence cited m the enclosed list, regarding the maintenance charges of two prisoners convicted by His Britannic Majesty’s Court, Siam, who were transferred with our consent, for imprisonment in a jail in this country owing to the lack of sentences^ atl0n ^ ^ ConSular *^ ail at BaD S kok for prisoners undergoing long 2. His Majesty’s Minister at Bangkok is of opinion that the charge should be borne by the Government of India, and he bases his contention on the following quotation from a despatch No. 6 of 26th July 1904, from the ± oreign Office to the Acting Judge, His Majesty’s Court for Siam . “ Bord Lansdowne concurs in your view that the cost of the convict’s maintenance, while undergoing sentence at Singapore, should be defrayed from the Colonial Funds, provided he is a native or resident of that colony ” In view of this expression of opinion by His Majesty’s Government, he requests our recognition of the general principle that the maintenance of na tives or re sidents of India returned thither from Siam, as convicts, should be chargeable to Indian Funds. 3. We are unable to agree with Mr. Paget that the ruling which he quotes should be considered to have any general application, as, in the first place, the case to which it refers, namely, that of a prisoner undergoing sentence at Singapore, must have presented special features owing to the fact that, under the terms of the Siam Order in Council, the Court for Siam is subordinate in some respects to the Supreme Court at Singapore. In the second place, we feel confident that, if His Majesty’s Government had contemplated the possibility of their ruling being held to be applicable to the case of convicts transferred to India from Siam, we should have been afforded an opportunity of representing to you the views which we hold on the question. 4. We are strongly of opinion that the charges in such cases as the present, for the maintenance of prisoners who may be natives of India, should be defrayed from funds at the disposal of the convicting Court, and not from Indian revenues; and, in the event of our views not being accepted, we should be reluctant, in future, to accord the permission, which is required under section 56(1) of the Siam Order in Council, for their transfer to Indian jails.List of Enclosures in Despatch No. Ill (External), dated the 15th June 1905 from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.

It appears to me that this case resembles the case of the British Indian subject sentenced by the Consular Court at Tangier in 1897, in * See Political Secretary’s Letter, No. 53, which I decided* that the expense dated 19th November 1897. might properly be borne by Indian revenues. 3. The principle on which I decided that case was that, the Consular Courts being established for the purpose of securing to British subjects more certain justice than they could obtain in the local Courts, it was right that India should bear the actual expenses involved in securing that benefit for British Indian subjects. 4.

I am directed by His Lordship to explain in reply that Mr. Scott applied to the Government of India in this case in accordance with Clause 12 of the Instructions to Her Majesty’s Consul-General, in giving effect to the Siam Order in Council, 1889, wdiich states that “ It is the desire of Her Majesty’s Government that expenses incurred “ under this Order, on account of persons born or domiciled in British “ Colonies or Possessions abroad should, when not paid by the persons “ themselves, be, so far as is practicable, defrayed by the Governments “ of the Colonies or Possessions to which the persons belong. Officers “ administering the Order should bear this desire in mind in determining “ not merely the place of deportation, but that of the trial and punish ment of the persons in question.” A copy of the Instructions is enclosed for convenience of reference. 24470, A 2 \4 The question of the incidence of expenses attending the conviction and punishment of Colonial and British Indian offenders, their de portation, &amp;c., was discussed by an Inter-departmental Committee in 1889-90, in connection with the preparation of the various Orders in Council then in contemplation, including those for Persia and Siam. The general result of those discussions was embodied in a letter addressed to your Department on the 17th of May 1889, and the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India jn the course proposed by the Treasury, viz., that such expenses should be borne by the dependency concerned, was intimated in a letter from your Department of the 26th of June following, such concurrence being subject to a similar concurrence on the part of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, which was obtained. At the instance of the Treasury, a general clause with regard to such cases was accordingly inserted in the Instructions to Consular Officers under the various Orders in Council, and copies of these Instructions were in several instances submitted for the concurrence of the Secretary of State, who, in one instance at least, returned them stating that he had no observations to offer 28th June 1890 ) Under these circumstances, when the account for the expenses of these Burmese prisoners was sent home by Mr. Scott, an inquiry was, at the instance of the Audit Office, addressed to him, asking whether they should not he recovered from the Government of India, to which he accordingly applied.
