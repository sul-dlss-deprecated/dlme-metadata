Meshed to the decretaiy to tiie Sovernment of the External Allaire Department, !New Delhi# General for Khorasan India in I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence resting with Express letter No.j!r*«27(14)-E/45, dated the 15th May 1945 from the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department on the subject oi the Sumptuary allowance of the Indian Assistant and Assistant Surgeon, Birjand. 2 * &lt; It is not clear whether the intention is that the Indian Assistant should draw sumptuary allowance at the existing rate, fe.10/* per month, or no Sumptuary allowance at all during the six months in the year when he is not entitled to the allowance at &amp;*25/-. 3# I recommend that the six months' limit be removed and that Sumptuary allowance at the present rate be drawn even when the Vice Consul is m residence for the i oil owing reasons :• (1) The Indian Assistant is faced with the entertainment of (a) travellers (b) local Persians all the year round and it is only when the Vice Consul is actually in residence that he gets any relief at all; (2) Even when the Vice Consul is m residence the fact that the Cpnsulate •Kelateh' where he stays is four miles out of Birjand means that a certain amount of independent entertain ing falls on the Indian Assistant. The Indian Assistant should, I think, be allowed to draw Sumptuary allowance at 25/- for any month during which the Vice Consul has not halted at Birjand more than three consecutive days, and at fts*10 for the remaining months. 4. I would further bring to the notice of the Government of India that the conveyance allowance drawn by the Indian Assistant and Assistant Surgeon, fis,10/- is entirely inadequate under present conditions. He has to keep a car for the following purposes (a) visting important patients in their country houses some of which are as much as 25 miles away from Birjand. (b) occasional journeys to the Kelateh during the Vice Consul’s absence in the discharge oi his responsibilities for its supervision, and almost daily ones when the Vice Consul is in residence. The journeys under (a) are valuable from the Political and those at (b) from the administrative point of view. 5* The 10/- Conveyance allowance at present sanctioned is insufficeint for the upkeep of a bicycle at present rates, much less a.car, even when eked out by occasional small Travelling Allowance bills at second class rates. I recommend that the Conveyance allowance bills at second class rates. I recommend that the Conveyance allowance attached to this post be increased to &amp;#30/- all the year round.Copy of letter No.465-3/20 dated the^JDth September 1945 from jjis Majesty 1 a Consul General for Khorasan to the Secretary tc[ the j-oveminent of India* internal Affairs Department, New Delhi* • i C C ) j Subject;-Reduction of Temporary posts and e^endit^re •occasicsaed Ipy war* I have the honour to refer to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Secret Express letter No*F#80-l/45, June 1945 and my telegram No*o59 dated the 13th September 194&amp;? -Ine t temporary posts and expre in the Khorasan Consulate General (includinR the Zahidan Consulate), which were made necessary by conditions casued b^ the war, are dealt with below.

It is not possible for the Indian Assistant Birjand to avoid entertaining local Persians and giving food and shelter to travellers from time to time. On account of the extremely higji cost of all things in Iran the sum of fls.25/-p«m* does not begin to cover his actual expenses m this connection, and I very strongly recoomend that it should be sanctioned permanently. It should not Be lost sight of that in these days Iran is, perhaps with one exception, the most expensive country in the world to live in.

Draft letter to Foreign Office supporting pro posals. 5 APR 1938 &amp; LJMinute Paper. POLITICAL Department. Pz^cj^w (V.3. The question of a rearrangement of the consular posts in East Iran has lately been ^iscusse^ between the Government of India, H.M. Consul-General at Meshed and. the Tehran Legation. There are at present in East Iran besides the Consul-General at Meshed, Vice-Consuls at Meshed, Zahidan, Zabul and. Birjand. (The Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas also performs the duties of Consul at Kerman and in Persian Baluchistan). It is felt that * some reduction in the number o± posts is desirable owing to the small amount of work attache' 3 to certain of them and their doubtful importance from other aspects. The objection of the Iranian Government to the performance of consular duties by Medical Officers means jwnj that the latter are prevented from acting as Vice-Consuls at such minor posts as Birjand. j't was agreed that insufficient work originated ^ at Birjand and Zabul to justify the continuance of Vice-Consulates at both of these places. H.M. Minister ^ at Tehran, however, in view of the potential importance to us of Zabul, was in favour of retaining the latter as a separate consular post for the present at any rate (Flag A). Birjand, on the other hand, is less important, (the total British Colony consisting of 60 Indians) and it seems doubtful whether an independent consular post will be required there again. A S a result of these discussions the Government of India have now submitted the following proposals:- (1) the post of Vice-Consul, Birjand, should be abolished and Birjand should be included in the consular district of the Vice-Consul, Zabul, who would divide his time equally between these two posts; k -fe ( 5474 b Wt 22530 /P 144 10,000 9.37 IOP (2)/; (2) a consulate office only should he retained at Birjand, and a clerk of the Lower Division of the combined Persian Gulf and Khorasan cadre should be placed in charge of this office. 4. An annual saving of Rs.2,592 per annum in salaries is anticipated as a result of the replacement of the Vice-Consul at Birjand by a clerk in charge of the Consulate there (see enclosure to the Government of Indian express letter below at Flag B). 5 # These proposals seem to be well justified and it is submitted that if the Foreign Office agree they should be sanctioned.

J - - — J - - o ] A T Consular arrangements in East Iran&gt; In connection with the proposal which has been put forward to abolish Birjand as a separate Consular post and to include it in the Consular district of the Vice-Consul, Zabul, I have the honour to suggest the following detailed arrangements. 2. The present establishment consists of a Vice- M*\ 0 Consul, who is a Sub-Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Medical Department and of an Iranian Mirsa, a peon and a sweeper. To maintain a small Consular Office a clerk who should be paid at the same rates as a clerk in the Lower Division of the Combined Persian Gulf and Khorasan Establishment will be required with a peon and a sweeper as before. 3. The Vice-Consul, Zabul, would divide his time equally between Birjand and Zabul spending six months at each place. There is already a suitable Consulate house (Kalate) at Birjand which w the Vice-Consul can occupy. For His journeys to and from Birjand he should draw travell ing allowance at tour rates and he should also be entitled to the usual ten day's halting allowance at Birjand. in the enclosed proposition statement I have not included any extra provision on this account as the Vice-Consul would probably in any case be called to Meshed to discuss matters with the Consul-General once during the hot weather and the cost of such journeys forms a normal part of the Consulate- General expenditure under Travelling Allowance which of necessity fluctuates considerably. 4. The proposition statement is for the most part self explanatory.explanatory but the following notes appear necessaryx- (a) Sumptuary Allowance. I have suggested the retention of this allowance a^jt the previous figure of Rs.lO per mensem. One of the duties of the Consular Clerk will he to give such assistance as he can to travellers in the same way as has been done in the past by the Vice-Consul. (b) Office Allowance. The Vice-Consul is at present in receipt of a monthly sum of Rs* IOC from which he defrays affxc the cost of his lAirza and menial establishment and office contingencies. Such expenditure should in future more properly be incurred as part of the 'Consulate-General Office Allowance which already bears the cost of the rent of the Vice-Consulate building as well as of all medical expenditure* The total amount has there fore been shown as a saving in the proposition statement. In point of fact an additional cost of Rs.300 per annum will be thrown on my Office Allowance grant calculated as follow Saving due to the closing of the Birjand dispensary. Rs. J l20 p.a. Additional cost of Birjand menial establishment and Office contin gencies @ Rs. 50 per mensem. Rs*720 p.a* Net increase. Rs.300 p.a. But this small sum I can find from savings in other directions. (c) I have provided a conveyance allowance of Rw. 10 per mensem as the clerk will have to pay regular visits to the Consulate Kalata situated some four miles from the town. The Vice-Consul previously drew a conveyance allowance of Rs.30 per mensem which was surrendered by him when the general retrenchments were made in 1931, vide % my office letger No. 1438, dated the 22nd October 1931. 5. The saving to Government as a result of these proposals amounts to Rs. 2,414 per annum.M OCT 1937 i 7 | EXPRESS LETTER . i S83/ F: -ii- COFVr From 1 &gt;j w' / Britconsul, Meshed.

The elerk thus deputed would have to be considered as on transfer to Birjand and the vacancy in my office filled by local arrangements as I cannot sl carry on short handed for so long a period. I do not know if this will necessitatethe formal creation of a new post to take the place of tne of post^Vice-Consul which will be vacant but m a any case I presume that this would create no difficulty in view of the fact that the arrangement will result in a saving to G-ovemment of approximately Rs*160 per mensem and will be much more economical than any arrangement involving the de putation of a temporary Vice-Consul. 5. No serious administrative inconvenience is anti cipated and I trust therefore that the (lovernraent of India will be pleased to accord their sanction to my proposal at a very early date. The Khan Sahib will be granted leave by me as a non-gazetted officer appointed to hold additional charge of the G-azetted appointment of Vice-Consul Birjand, and the Director-G-eneral, Indian Medical Service informed accordingly.

Dept. Temo ho. F.725 - ^36 of 29th December 1936 on the subject of the Vice Consulate at Birjand. There is no Bank Manager or other suitable person at Birja^d vho could be appointed part time Vice Consul and unless other arrangements for carrying on the Consular du ties can be made, the question therefore resolves itself into one of carrying on as at present, or closing the 7ice Con- sulate altogether. 2. / At present I find it difficult to recommend complete closure as the existing isolation of Consular officers in East Iran from all local contacts makes it almost impossible for me to estimate either what the value of the various Consular posts has been in the past or tfiat importance they are likely to acquire in the future. The fact that the appoint* ment of Vice Consul Meshed, Vice Consul Zabul and Medical Officer were all vacant when.I arrived has been an additional handicap. Further It is / itself without reference to Zabul, which is in almost exactly the same position, and to East /Iran as a whole. i 3. As far as I have been able to gather, the Consular appointments in East Iran have been maintained cheifly:- (a) for the performance of Consular duties proper. (b) for the collection of information. (c) as an insurance against the future (vide especially your confidential d.o. No,D,2514-N/32 of the 2nd July 1932 to Daly.) C As regards (a) there is not enough purely Consular work in either Birjand or Zabul to justify the retention of G&amp;vo&gt;uJUtv (fyKcjtA*. ICuZ 9 A«L-&lt;a&gt; CUatx'fjcJ. *\ /either of these teo places acquiring any considerable icpor- tgnce in the near future. I have in fact been able to discover why the appointcent of Vice Consul Zabul was recently created ' 1 J in face of Daly's telegram No;400 of November 8 tii 1935 andhis despatch No.424 of 21st November in which he gave it as his opinion that the cost of a separate Vice Consul at Zabul was not justified. I do not knew how much importance the Government of India attach to (b) but the information which we can collect under present circumstances is scanty and unreliable. There remains (c) and this is an aspect of the case the importance of which I an unable at present to estimate. 4. It does however s em to me that it might be possible to effect considerable economies either by leaving the appoint-? rnents temporarily vacant, with a clerk in charge as proposed in Daly’s telegram No.400 referred to above, or by doubling them up as I believed has been done in the case of Kerman and Bendar Abbas. I do not know the exact arrangements that have been made there&gt; but of the two alternatives I prefer the second. Assumir^ that O’Connor arrives as M.O. and is given a licence to practise privatdy in East Iran (so Hi at the question of hia becoming Vice Consul as before does not arise) I think that the simplest solution would be for the Vice Consul Zahidan to hold additional charge of Zabul and for the Vice Consul Meshed to do the same at Birjand. I do not knew whether they could be properly accredited at those two places; if not they could be in temporary charge of Consular duties. 5. If this idea meets with approval I would work out details and submit proposals officially. There need be no great difficulty as regafds personnel. Fry could be t transferred to Meshed in the spring (I recommend that this should be done in any case) and take charge oi . eshed and Birjand, and Campbell at Zahidan could look after Zabul. Incidentally Campbell tells me that/wants to ; - o on lour months leave in the middle of October and would like to fcetum to Zahidan in February or March. I hope that this will be per missible as his experience there is most valuable, and we have yet to find any other officer who is both useful and con tented there. Fry also propose^ to apply for leave in the sprirg of 1938. If therefore Fry could be replaced at Meshed in the autumn and take over at Zahidan until Can^bell returns, no great difficulty or expense would be involved. 6. One otiier point I should like to raise is that of ihe presentpresent Vice Consul Birjand’s future. Jamadar Fazal Haq, I.M.D. was pasted to Birjand in 1930, but ms given to understand at the time that he could no longer remain on the Baluchistan Qtetdre and that he would have to revert to Military employment in the termination of his appointment, (vide fbreign’s tel^ram No.844-3 of 17th April 1930) Fazal Haq has done extremely gasdxsKxr well in the appointment in circumstances which have by no means always been easy and Daly tdshed particularly to recommend him for similar employment elsewhere if arxi when it should be decided to close down Birjand. I hope that it will be possible to do something for him when he leaves his present post and has had some leave. 7. I am afraid that I have mixed up a number of separate que stions in this letter, but it may perhaps be of use to you to have my present views on the general situation for what they are worth. I am sending a copy to the Minister at Teheran.D.G. tio.F.725-N/3^. External AfJ'aijs Department, The September 19 3 7 I am desired to refer to Seymour’s despatch Mo. 110(134/0/37), dated the 1st June 1937, regarding clmn^es in Consular arrangements in East Iran, a copy of ^hich lias been sent to you direct. There have been so many changes in the last few years in Consular arrangements in ^ast Iran that it is considered here that the fe^wer lurther changes .uid© the better. A Vice-Consul at 2abul may not be essential at present, bat one may be required later, and if the post is abolished, it will probably be difficult to obtain the consent of the Inmian authorities to its restoration. The Government of India are therefore inclined to agree with deymour’s suggestion in paragraph 2 of his despatch - to abolish Birjand aa a separate post. It might then be included in the Consular district of the Vice-Consul, Sabul, who might arrange to spend some months of each year there to avoid the wor&amp;e of the Zabul hot veather• In this case all that would be required permanently in Birjand would be a Consulate Office. /i.s reg&amp;ras Vice-Consul, Meshed, which post is not on the cadre of the/flto 1- *'—— — the Political Service, it is probable that, as cadre difficulties lessen, the arrangefnent, whereby a junior Political Officer is appointed at Meshed for a year f s instruction before bein^r transferred to Zahidan or Z&amp;bul as v r ic©-Consul, could be revived, Such an arran^eisent will not always be possible, but it will be kept in view when making postii^a. I mn to request that detailed proposals for a reorganisation of consular arrangements should be submitted on the above lines. It is considered that proposals should also be submitted for the reorganisation of the medical arran eraents in East Iran. In this connection, I am to explain that the Government of India consiner that no political advantage is likely to be obtained by pressing further the question of outside practice by the consulate medical officer* They are therefore prepared to close down the consulate hospitals at Birjand and Zabul, provided that facilities are maintained 1 or the treatment of the consulate staffs and B-iuisn objects, should the Iranian Covemment raise no objection to the treatment of the latter.

It would, however, appear from the correspondence reaching myself, the Gosraeroi&amp;l secretary ami His Majesty*s consul, that very little worh originates in either Birjand or :a'bul* It was accordingly my first idea t at it might be possible to abolish Blrjanci as a separate post and to arrange that Hie i&amp;jesty*© Vice-Consul at Sabul should spend, say, four months tiiere In the su^raer when the climate of abul is very trying. It seemed to me that this would be amply sufficient, especially as His Majesty*© Consul-General always has an op,.ortunity of stopping there In the autumn and spring on iii© journeys to and from Salmi, and that all that need be maintained there permanently would be a Consulate Office in th© care of a single reliable cleric.

I would therefore be in favour of retaining it© existence as a separate consular * post far the time being at any rats, even though for the greater part osf the year it will be left without a consular officer* I do not think that there would be any difficulty in getting the Iranian Government to recognise His I ajeety’e /ice—Gansu1 at Zahidan a© Acting British Viee-ooZieul at Babul as well, if it was explained that this wae an experimental and temporary measure, but X am not cure that they would agree to reogaiee such a position pcx*majiQntly* Their line mlgnt be tiiat, wiiile they would recognloe His Hajeaty f s Vioe-Cc^sul in a second act- ing capacity 3 Uj the absence of a Vice—Consul at Ghoul, this could not be treated a© a permanent arrangement and that we must eventually either appoint a substantive Vise-Consul or /elm- 4 - else convert Sabul from &amp; Conculate Into a uonaulate office# I think, however, that it would be possible to maintain such an arrangement long enough for ue to make up our minds a© to what was the most desirable permanent arrangement# should Mr# squire find that having only two Yice-oonssuls leaves him In practice rather short-handed, there* would be no difficulty in re—appointing a substantive Vice-Consul to iabul and in that event he, and not His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Meshed, would be called upon to spend some of the summer months at Birjand# B# I have written the above on the supposition that the medical officer etinched to the staff jtiwiI- deneral will A be allowed some facilities for outside practice# As you are aware, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed me orally early in the year that he would be granted a licence to practise at Meshed but that elsewhere he could only treat members of the consular staffs? but in April they went back on this and stated that ills practice would have to be confined everywhere to Consulate staffs# I have since obtained jhc views on tills of Mr# squire, who has also uiseusoed the matter with captain 0 # Connor, the new medical officer, and I am now making further represen tat Ions to tlie } ini® try of Foreign Affairs# gMouldt the Iranian Government finally infuse, however, to offcopd the medical officer any facilities for outside practice, there would no longer seem to be any objection to his holding consular rank# In that case he might once more be given Oi© position of Vice-Consul and a third career consular officer would then prob ably become quite unnecessary# 9# I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's on- sul-oeneral for horaosan Ho# H9, and with a copy of his letter Ho# b# &gt;. 16 of 27th January last to ? lr Aubrey Metcalfe, to me \ majesty's principal decratary of btate for Foreign Affairs, J41# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your txcellency’s, most obedient servant, (Signed) H#J# SeymourConfidential D.O. No* 16 (5/1QQ) / . r { pfi^s^Iajesty*s Consulate General ^ for PChorasan, Zabul, O •«' ^ v_y .1 j }?th January v 1937, (Dear Sir Aubrey), ¥ill you please refer to the F* and P. Dept. Mem No. F 725 - N/36 of the 29th December, 1936, on the subject of the Vice-Consulate at Birjand. There is no Bank Manager or other suitable person at Birjand who could be appointed part time Vice-Consul and unless other arrangements for carrying on the Consular duties can be made, the question therefore resolves itself into one of carrying on as at present, or closing the Vice-Consulate altogether. 2. At present I find it difficult to recommend complete closure as the existing isolation of Consular officers in East Iran from all local contacts make%*’ I l^ s lmpo8sible for me to estimate either what the value of the various Consular posts has been in the past or what importance they are likely to acquire in the future. The fact that the appointments of Vice-Consul Meshed, Vice-Consul Zabul, and Medical Officer were all vacant when I arrived has been an additional handi cap. Further it is difficult to consider the Birjand appoint ment by as a whole. 3© As far as I have been able to gather, the Consular appointments in East Iran have been maintained chiefly : (a) for the performance of Consular duties proper. (b) for the collection of information. (c) as an insurance against the future (vide especially your confidential D.O. No. D.2514 - N/32 of the 2nd July, 1932, to Daly.) As regards (a) there is not enough purely Consular work in either Birjand or zabul to justify the retention of Consular officers there, and I see no li^iih 00 ^ o: ^ either of tli£se two places acquiring any considerable importance in the near future. I have in fact been unable to discover why the appointment of Vice-Consul Zabul was recently created in face of Daly’s telegram No. 400 of the Bth November, 1935 and his despatch No. 424 of /the- 2 - the 21st November, 1935 in which he gave it as his opinion that the cost of a separate Vice-Consul at Zabul was not justified I do not know how much importance the Government of India attach to (b) but the formation which we can collect under |&gt;fcesent circumstances is scanty and unreliable* There remains (c) and this is an aspect of the case the importance of which I am unable at present to estimate* 4* It does, however, seem to me that it might be possible to effect considerable economies either by leaving the appointments temporarily vacant, with a clerk in charge as proposed in Daly’s telegram No. 400 referred to above, or by doubling them up as 1 believe has been done in the case of Kerman and Bandar Abbas* I do not know the exact arrangements that have been made there, but of the two alternatives I prefer the second. Assuming that O’Connor arrives as M.O* and is given a licence to practise privately in East Iran (so that the question of his becoming Vice-Consul as before does not arise) I think that the simplest solution would be for the Vice-Consul Zahidan to hold additional charge of Zabul and for the Vice-Consul Meshed to do the same at Blrjand. I do not know whether they could be properly accredited at those two places; if not they could be in temporary charge of Consular duties. 5. If this idea meets with approval I would work out details and submit proposals officially* There need be no great diffi culty as regards personnel. Fry could be transferred to Meshed in the spring (I recommend that this should be done in any case) and take charge of Meshed and Birjand, and Campbell at »5 SSl could look after Sabul. Incidentally Campbell tells me that he wants to go on four months leave in the middle of October and would like to return to Zahidan in February or March. I hope that this will be permissible as his experience there is most valuable, and we have yet to find any other officer who is both useful and con tented there. Fry also proposes to apply for leave in the spring of 1938. If therefore Fry could be replaced at Meshed in the autumn and take over at Zahidan until Campbell returns, no /great5 great difficulty or expense would 'be involved. 6* One other point I should like to raise is that of the present Vice-Consul Birjand’s future. Jenadar Fazl was posted to Birjand in 1930, but was given to understand at the time that he could no longer remain on the Baluchistan Cadre and that he would have to revert to Military employment on the termination of his appointment (vide Foreign*s telegram No. 844- E of 17th April, 1930). Fasl Haq has done extremely well always in the appointment in circumstances which have 'by no meaner been easy and Daly wished particularly to recommend him for similar employment elsewhere if and when it should be decided to close down Birjand. I hope that it will be possible to do something for him when he leaves his present post and has had some leave. 7. I am afraid that I have mixed up a number o:' separate questions in this letter, but it may perhaps be use to you to have my present views on the general situation for what they are worth. I am sending a copy to the Minister at Teheran. Yours sincerely (Signed) G.F. Squire Sir ri • A • F • Me teal f e, K. •C.-l.E*, C • S«1., M.

Furniture for the Birjand Consulate Kelata and Sistan Vice-Consulate. Sir, I am directed to refer to telegram dated the 1st May 1914 from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India in which sanction was accorded to the purchase of land and the construction of the Consulate at Birjand at a total cost of Rs. 6,366. His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain has reported that no provision was made at the time for furniture for the Consulate. The house was partially furnished with camp chairs and tables, to which were added from time to time odd pieces bought from office allowance savings or inherited from East Persia Cordon Field Force messes. Most of the existing furniture hardly suits a Consular residence, and certain articles, such as chests of drawers, side boards, dining table, floor-cloth, etc., are altogether lacking. It is accordingly proposed that the house should now be furnished at a cost not exceeding Rs. 1,700/- (rupees one thousand and seven hundred). 2. The Consul has also reported that no furniture has been provided by Government for the Vice-Consul and Medical Officer, Sistan, who is occupying the bungalow built by the Imperial Bank of Persia for their Accountant. A sufficient quantity of good second hand furniture is reported to be available/2 available in the town and the Consul proposes to purchase certain essential articles for Rs. 1,200/- (rupees one thousand and two hundred) for the Vice-Consul^ residence. 3. The Consul, Sistan and Kain, has intimated that he and the Vice-Consul, Birjand, are willing to pay rent at 15 per cent., the rate fixed by the Government of India for such cases, on the capital cost of the furniture, excluding that in the two reception rooms, which, under the rules in force, are furnished free at Government expense in the Consulates in Persia and the Persian Gulf. The Government of India accordingly recommend the proposal for favourable consideration by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India in Council. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sgd.)
