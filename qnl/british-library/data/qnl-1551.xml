I have the honour to enclose herev/ith the state- -ment of one Issaq bin Ibrahim al-Hajri of Kuwait, claim- -ing a balance of account from the estate of Saad bin Abdullah, a Bahraini, said to be lately deceased. .Statement of Issaq bin Ibrahim el Hajri of Kuwait. Issaq bin Ibrahim el Hajri after solemn affirmation, STATES I sent by boat by Nakhoda Ghanem bin Suleman, 3 bundles containing 406 Bhists (Abbas) to Saad bin Abdulla el Musabehi of Bahrain to sell on my account and promised to pay him the customary commission on the sale proceeds but the rate was not settled. Saad sold the goods and towards the proceeds remitted me a currency note of Es.1,000/- through Abdulla bin Hamed Nafisi and promised to send the balance later by the next ship. Meanwhile Saad bin Abdulla died at Bahrain (some 4 months ago) without livi^y any grown up heir. The charge of the deceased's estate was therefore taken by the Political Agent in Bahrain and notice was issued that persons having claims on the estate should lodge them at the Office of the Political Agent, Bahrain. Saleh bin Majid and Hamed bin Isa, neighbours of the de- -ceased, were present the death-bed of Saad bin Abdulla and the deceased, before his death, confessed to them that he had with him in cash £T.57/- for remittance to Issa§fc bin Ibrahim el Hajri (the claimant) and that something more would be due to him on the same account. I have in my possession 4 letters received from the de- -ceased, written before his death and these letters are now in Bahrain in custody of Hamed bin Salman Ghegisi. The 3 bundles of Abbas were bought in Baghdad for £T.159/~ and 6-g- Karush. After the death of Saad bin Abdulla I visited Bahrain and called at the Political Agency there to lodge my claim but was told that I could do so later on by bringing^letter from the Political Agent, Kuwait, or from Shaikh Mubarak. I then left for Baghdad and have now returned and come to the Agency to prefer this my claim, against the deceased Saad bin Abdulla's estate. In the deceased's letters to me will be apparent what he0 ¥ ^ le jf’ 01 ' G ^stoms import duty into Bahrain and probably in his books or papers what profit he made for me. All I know is what the Abbas cost me in Baghdad viz £1.159, 6-g- Karush. I do not know what profit he made, but there should be at least another £T.30/- to cover my ori- -ginal cost beyond the £T.57/- which he said was mine on his death-bed. I intend going by this mail to Bahrain. Read Over and Admitted Correct, Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait Kuwait, ) 28th September 1911Stateaent of Issaq bin Ibrahia el i:ojri of Kuwait.

In reply I have the honour to Inform you that the administra tion of estates of this nature are dealt with here by the MaJlls-el-'Urfl*• Issaq’s claim on the estate of Sad bln Abdullah Musabhl was duly entered along with many others, but It was never proved. On several oooaslons the creditors were their claims, but very few took the trouble to ooae. Apparent ly neither Issaq nor his agent appeared before Majlis to prove his claim. Finally as the case had dragged on for years the Majlis de cided, after falling several times to get creditors to prove their claims, that a dividend should be declared amongst those who had proved their claims, and the others who did not ap pear should be struck off. This was done and a dividend Is sued ealy In this year. While he was here Issaq proved his claim before the Kazi, and as there are some outstanding of the estate still un collected, I am endeavouring to get them collected, and If I succeed I hope to be able to pay a dividend to Issaq. I have decided to do this as Issaq 9 s agent seems rather a stupid fellow. I think there Is no doubt that he came to the Agenoy several times after hearing the criers, but as he simply smt th«T*Athere and went away after a short time without asking to see the Politioal Arent or the Majlis* in the press of business he was overlooked* For this reason I thought it bsst to take Issaq's name on the list of oreditors again* but it did not seem feasible to get baok any of the money already divided or and give him a dividend# I have the honour to be* Sir* Tour most obedient servant* Major* Politioal Agent* Bahrein*t L r\ POLITICAL AGENCY# Bahrein,the 16th October 1913# I thank you for your letter of today and the Re.312/10/- , and am much obliged to you for your efforta to collect the outstandings of the estate# I hone some more will be recovered, so I have ft paid Saad bin Muhammad Rs#20/- or l/5 of his claim on account as he wants to go to hi 3 home in Kaoa# / A Mr Yusuf bin Aimed ^anoo.
