The de jure position in the Persian Gnlt' is that of u sea open to the flag oi all nations, the northern shores of which, with their territorial waters, are included in the dominions of Persia, while its western and southern coasts are in the occupation oi Arab tribes, who have entered into treaty relationships oi' varying character, constituting a sort of Protectorate, with Great Britain. These, the so-called Trucial Chiefs, are six in muuber, residing severally in Rasel Kheimah, Umm-al-Kawain, Ajman, Shargah, Debai, and Abu Dthabi. The essence of their treaties (which date from the early part of the l^th century) is that the Chiefs undertake to maintain a perpetual truce at sea; to submit their inter-tribal quarrels to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf; not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power but the British Government; not to consent to the residence in their territories of the agents ol any other Power ; not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of their territory save to the British Government; and to prohibit the trade in arms. In return the British Government maintains their independence and in effect guarantees their protection, North of K1 Katr, and between that State and Koweit, El Hasa and Ilofuf were in Turkish occupation from 1872 to PJ13, when Bin Sand, the Amir of Nejd, ejected the Turkish garrisons and took possession of those districts. His independent sovereignty over them has been formally recognised by J lis Majesty's Government, who have promised to protect him against aggression by any foreign Power. But his borders have not been delimited and his position as a Gulf Chief has not yet been regulated by treaty. El Katr was added to the number ol Irucial Chiefs in 1910. At the head of the Gulf, on the Persian side, is the semi-autonomous Persian province ol' Arabistan. The ruler of this province, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, is a Persian subject, but he holds his province as hereditary Governor under a firman from the Shah, which recognises his special lights. The position of Mohammerah is one of such importance that His Majesty's Government have found it necessary to enter into intimate relations with him. Assurances have been given to him and to his successors in the male line, and hold so long as he and they do not fail to observe their obligations towards the Persian Government, and maintain an attitude satisfactory to His Majesty's Govern ment. The nomination of successors is to be subject to confidential consultation with and approval by His Majesty's Government (21st November 1914). It may be noted that the Persian Government were informed in 1910 that His Majesty's Government had special relations with the Sheikh, and would support him in the event of any encroachment on his rights, but that he is not a British-protected person. The islands in the Gulf are owned either by Persia or by Arab Chiefs ; 1 ut upon one of the Persian Islands, viz., Kishvi, Great Britain possesses a piece of land by virtue of an original grant from the Imam of Muscat, to whom the island once belonged ; and also a coaling station on Tlcnjam. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included in the same political system, are, on the northern shore of the Arabian Sea, the coasts of Persian Baluchistan, along which the overland wires of the Indo-European Telegraph Company run as far as Jask, where a reserve of territory exists under an Agreement concluded in 1887 between the British and Persian GJovernments, and where a detachment of Indian troops, who had previously been stationed there between the years 1879 and 1887, was re-established in January 1898 in consequence of the murder of a British telegraph oflicial and the disturbed state of Persian Baluchistan. To the south of the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but within the sphere of its political influence, the Arab State of Muscat, the independence of which was guaranteed by Great Britain and France under the joint Declaration of 18G2, has for years been predominantly controlled by British influence; its trade is similarly in Anglo-Indian hands ; and its Ruler in 1891 entered into an Agreement with the British Government not to alienate any portion of his dominions to any other Power. The de facto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects an even more positive British predominance than the preceding paragraphs might indicate. In the early years of the nineteenth century the slave trade was 10 OT 20 160 12/182 lampanl in 111o (nilt, tind tliG vcriscls of tlic Indiun iMjiriiiG wor© gii ^ u ^ g (1 m &lt;i lon^' cincl arduous struggle with tliG Arab pirates who infGSted its soiitliGrn coasts. This conflict, Avhicb was coiiductGd entirely by J^i'itisli agency and means, without any help from the \ eisian GroverninGnt, rGsuItcd. m the Gstablislimcnt of treaty relations with the gieat majority ot tlie Arab Chiefs, under which they bound themselves to observe perpetual peace and to refer all disputes to the British Resident at Bushire. The pax Jiritannica, which lias ever since, with rai'e exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrangements and is the exclusive work of this country. Of similar oiigin ueie the soundings ol the channels, the surveys of the shores of the Persian Ciulf, and . the lighting and buoying of its waters, which the navigators of all nations owe to the labours ol a long line ol naval officers of the Indian service. DuiJiig the nineteenth century Hritish trade acquired almost a monopoly of the foieign commerce of the Gull ports. Indian merchants from Shikarpur and other pa its ol feci nd have settled in considerable numbers at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and. Bahiein. He lore the advent of the Belgian Customs officials at the former ports, and until quite recently at Bahrein, they have farmed the Customs. Foreign imports and expoi ts foi the most part are conveyed to and from the Gulf in British ships, more than one Anglo-Indian Company (the ' British India, ' the ' Bombay and Persia ' and the Anglo-Arabian and Persian Gulf ') having maintained for years a merchant steamer sei vice between Karachi and Bussorah, touching at the Gulf ports on the way, whilst the ii\,il ventuies that have occasionally been attempted by foreign nations have unifoimh failed and been withdrawn, with the recent exceptions of the heavilv- subsidized vessels of the Hamburg-American line, and of the Russian Steamship Company, w hich maintains quarterly sailings from Odessa. Before the institution of the Gei man seivice the statistics show that 93 per cent, of the numbers and tonnage of the steamers engaged was under the British flag. The protection of the pearl fisheries, which are carried cn by the Arab tribes under the time-honoured conditions, is also an important feature of liritish policy. During the last 40 years the maintenance of the submarine cables of the Indo-European Telegraph Company from Fao to Jask, and of the laud lines from that place to Karachi, has also devolved upon the Indian Government, and has tended to increase an already preponderant influence over both the waters and the shores of the Gulf. Lattei h a deliberate but necessary consolidation of British influence in certain quarters where trouble threatened has been forced upon IJis Majesty's Government. At the north-west extremity ol the Gull the Government of India, under instructions from His Majesty's Government, entered into engagements, dated 1899 and 1907, with the Shetkh oj Koweit, by which he bound himself and his successors not to alienate any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power, while, on the othei hand, he granted to llis Majesty's Government certain prior rights in regard to the leasing of any portion of the foreshore of his territory. The first of these Agreements was dictated by the increasing encroachment of Turkish authority ; the latter was due to a determination on the part of llis Majesty's Government to secure the only good harbour by which the Baghdad Railway could debouch upon the Gulf. In return for these engagements the Sheikh was assured of ' the good offices ol the British Government to himself, his heirs, and successors, and finally, in November 1914, that Koweit should be ' recognised as an independent principalitv under British protection,' At Bahrein a step has been taken in the direction of protecting British interests and those ol the local Sheikh by the appointment of a regular Political Agent, and just before the war, the Sheikh ceded his jurisdiction over foreigners to Great Britain: but a formal protectorate has not been declared. Such, briefly summarised, is the position that has been won by Great Britain, not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the Persian Gulf. In its vindication this country has more than once been called upon to enter into military occupation of ports or islands in the Gulf. The Island of Kharak was occupied by Indian forces from 1838-42, and again in 1856-7 Bushire was held during the latter years, as also were Muhammerah and Ahwaz upon the Karun. ft is unnecessary to dwell upon the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf which necessitates the maintenance of the position thus acquired. A glance at the map shows that, whether a threat to India came across Mesopotamia or across Persia it could only be effectively countered by British naval supremacy on the waters of the3 Ciuli. iciice F.orcl Lansdowne stated urbl ct orbl in the House of Lords in 1903 that u 7° f, ! )u re ^(l the establishment of a naval base, or a fortified port, in the Persian t&lt; 1,1111 . oth ? r l^ower as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at-our disposal.' This declaration, which has never been challenged, was formally re-afrirmed by Sir E. Grey in connection with the Anglo-Uussian Convention of 1907, with the addition that 44 His Majesty's Govern- u IV^VVr cont j nue t ? ^i^ect all their efforts to the preservation of the siatLis quo in &lt;t 110 ' ' :lll( , th^ maintenance ol British trade ; in doing so, they have no desire to exclude the legitimate trade of any other Power.' Hut though tho declaration has never been formally challenged, the status quo at the head of the Gulf was seriously threatened by the Turkish Government, at German instigation, in the five years immediately preceding Uie war. In order to meet this threat and to regularise the de facto position described above. His Majesty s Government embarked on far-reaching negotiations with the Turkish and German Governments in 1912-14. These negotiations resulted in a series of Aoree- menrsregarding the stains and limits of Koweit, the navigation and conservation of the bhatt-ei-Arab and other kindred matters, which had been partly signed and partly initialled, but not ratified, when war broke out. 1 Thus the position of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf may well be described as unique; for although, with the slight exceptions referred to,' she has at no time enjoyed, or even asked for, territorial acquisitions in those regions she has for generations borne burdens there which no other nation has ever undertaken anywhere, except in the capacity of sovereign ; she has had duty thrust upon her without dominion ; she has kept the peace amongst people who are not her subjects • has patrolled, during upwards of two centuries, waters over which she has enjoyed uo foimal loidship; has kept, in strange ports, an open door through which the traders of every nation might have as free access to distant markets as her own. If Great Britain has become, in any sense, the arbiter and guardian of the Gulf, it has not been through a restless ambition urging her on to the control of the waste places of the earth, but in obedience to the calls that have been made upon her in the past to enforce peace between warring tribes, to give a free course to trade, to hold back the arm of the marauder and the oppressor, to stand between the slave- dealer and his victim. Indeed, the history of the Gulf during the last century and a half is a striking- example of what the ' I'reedom of the seas ' means, as conceived by Great Britain. Here, as in other parts ol the world, British influence was first built up by a private trading company under the protection of the British Flag, and here, as elsewhere that influence has come, in the fulness of time, to be used by the British Government under the same protection, in the general interest. ' tn^ntally the Turkish Government renounced all claims to sovereignty over Arabia east and south of a line drawn from a point opposite Bahrein across the desert to the north-west frontier of the Aden Protectorate.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002e5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B305</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002e5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B305</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'The British Position in the Persian Gulf'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1919/1919</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-23T09:41:37</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>2 folios</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation sequence is circled in pencil, in the top right corner of the recto of both folios.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>A summary of the British Position in the Persian Gulf detailing the rulership and ownership of the coastal territories and the agreements made between their rulers and Great Britain.The territories and areas described in the summary include:The Trucial Chiefs: Rasel Kheimah [Ras al-Khaimah], Umm al-Kawain [Umm al Qaywayn], Ajman, Shargah [Sharjah], Debai [Dubai], and Abu Dthabi [Abu Dhabi]; includes details of their treaties and agreements with Britain, and the inclusion of El Katr [Qatar] as a Trucial Chief from 1916 onwards.The Persian province of Arabistan, including details of the assurances given to him by both the Persian and British Governments.The Islands of the Gulf, in particular Kishm [Qeshm] and Henjam [Hengām].The coast of Persian Baluchistan, giving details of the overland wires of the Indo-European Telegraph Company that run through the area, and the agreements made for detachments of Indian troops to be stationed at Jask on that coastline.The Arab state of Muscat, detailing the recognition of its independence in 1862 and the British influence over the state.Koweit [Kuwait] including the agreements made with the Shaikh in 1899 and 1907, and the recognition of Kuwait as an independent principality under British protection in November 1914.Bahrein [Bahrain], including the steps taken there to protect British interests.The summary goes on to describe the British position and responsibilities with regards to the waters of the Gulf, including the Indian Marine's commitment against slavery in the nineteenth century; its struggles to prevent Piracy, which led to the establishment of treaty relations with the Arab Chiefs; the surveys of the waters and shorelines undertaken by Naval Officers of the Indian service; the development of British trade and foreign commerce; the protection of pear fisheries; and the maintenance of the submarine cables of the Indo-European Telegraph Company.The summary concludes with a brief description of the strategic importance of the Gulf, particularly in relation to threats to India; the threat to the British position by the Turkish Government in the years leading up to World War One, and the actions taken by the British Government to nullify it; and Great Britain's role as an arbiter and guardian of the Persian Gulf.There are two copies of the summary, the author of which is unknown.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Telegraphs</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign affairs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002e5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
