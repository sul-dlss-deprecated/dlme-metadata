It seems clear in fact that Germany will henceforth demand to take her share on pretty much the same plane as ourselves in any commercial developments which may ensue. Germany’s successful politico-commercial competition has only been made possible by closely concerted action between the representatives of her com merce and politics and unless we can devise means of meeting it by a similar combination of forces I fear we shall not only fail to make headway but shall continue to lose ground as we have done for several years past. , , Her ^ ^ j he Gu ! f we have always sought to maintain the view that a good deal could be done to impede German progress and we have continued to make specific suggestions to this end. But so far they have not been deemed possible of adoption and in the last Board of Trade Memorandum on the subject the discouraging conclusion is arrived at that “ until order is secured in Southern Persia, none of the proposals that have been put forward could be of any very appreciable utility. Conversely it would seem that in the view of the Board of de andthe Government of India the restoration of order in Southern Persia will in itself put British firms in a position to offer successful resistance to German competition. British traders may use and appear to have used this argument in order to induce Government to take up more actively the question of security for trade on the caravan routes in Southern Persia, but apart from that aspect of m .i Ca J inot J 16 ? thinkl ^g ^at the theory is to a great extent a fallacious one. No doubt trade in general to inland Persia will show an improvement in propor tion to the increase of security achieved, but all trade will share this advantage ;it will not affect the ability of the German element to compete with us success- fnllv in the Gulf as they are doing now, nor will it affect the position existing at Mohammerah, Basrah or the Arab Ports of the Gulf For example an improve ment in the situation in Pars will not make Mr. Stnck any more inclined than he ' nresent to provide regular sailings to and from Bahrain nor will it reduce Messrs. Wonckhaus’s exports of grain ftom the Shatt-al-A.rab. The detailed su^crestions made in the present Report in development of those previously submitted aim at regaining for direct British shipping from the United Kingdom to the Gulf the independent position which they formerly held, and the recovery for them of the cargoes now carried in German bottoms ; and m this connection I would direct attention to the fresh suggestion now put forward by Mr Chick with that end in view, namely, that the entry of a powerful line like the British India Steam Navigation Company into the carrying trade between Europe and the Persian Gulf would be a great advantage and should, if possible, be encouraged. Cannot the Right Honourable Lord Inchcape become our Herr Ballin and take the problem in hand in consultation with Government with a view to introducing cohesion and combination of action among the British Companies in the struggle with German competition. There is one other point to which I venture to draw attention and will then leave Mr. Chick’s industrious Report to plead its own righteous cause. I allude to his observations on the subject of wheat cultivation as opposed to that of barley. It is a question which seems of the highest importance to us now that we are in sight of expensive irrigation schemes in Mesopotamia and in Arabistan. Clearly if it is barley that Germany wants and we cannot use, we should endeavour to encourage the cultivation of wheat which we can find a market for, in connection with any irrigation schemes vtfith which we may be directly or indirectly identified. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Sd.) P. Z.

Report on German Trade and shipping in the Persian Gulf. For the period October iqii-i2. The period O.ctober 191 i-12 corresponded with the sixth year of sailings of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie to the Persian Gulf. The five annual reports pre viously. written on the same subject have been issued under the following numbers:— No. 7 Commercial, 27th November 1907 (Foreign Department India 2473). No. 2 &gt;» 12th May I 9 C 9 ( „ &gt;• „ 1230).

Tranship ment trade via India is on a smaller scale altogether, and tends to become less valuable each year, as the natural result of frequent direct communication with Europe, of the proportionally higher rates of freight prevailing between India and4 r Imports. by Hamburg-Amerika vessels in : ■ — 1908 - 09 . 1909 - 10 . 1910 -j 1 .

Imports to Persian and Arab ports were thus larger in the aggregate than ever before, the upward tendency being particularly noticeable at Muhammerah and Bus hire; whilst imports to Turkish ports on the Tigris, though 26000 pack ages less than m *9 'o-i i (when there were 13 vessels instead of 12/ not onlv t le rem . ; ' rkab,e increase of the previous year,, but were supplemented by 7 287 tons of railway material for Baghdad. There can be little doubt that e German ships come out with fairly full cargoes and that this successful result 0 Slx &gt;' ears regular sailings will encourage them to extend their Gulf services to more than one vessel per mensem. services to In any consideration of the means by which the German Government and German financial interests are seeking to create an established interest iL “is region, and in the arraignment of the British shipping lines for the very ineffective resistance offered by them to German progress, there is one all-important point which perhaps has been too little emphasised in the past. If cargoes and P pnris o supment are properly analysed, it will be seen that these German vessels are using Belgian, Dutch and Austrian products and manufactures (Swedish to a minor degree) on which to build their shippingf trade to the Gulf • anrl th Hamburg-Amerika Linie has practically claimed Belgium as its own preserve. 0ut of , ,2 4 .’,? 64packa g e P m P? rt ed to the Persian and Arab ports in the sixth year of sailings, ports of origin were as follows : P Hamburg. 2,526 1,285 297 2,753 5)543 5,123 Maskat Bandar Abbas Lingah Bahrain Bushire Muhammerah Antwerp. 7,473 17,718 3,955 5 343 39,020 * 7,*35 1 7&gt;527 90,669 Has,7 Tonnage of 1 mport cargoes.

The averacyp nf all cargo to the Gulf for each of the 12 vessels should therefore be about *2 800 tons. Amounts of Port Sudan and Jibouti cargo have not been available ’this Imports at Bahrain. 1. Mcij or Trevor, Gd^E., draws attention to the following points with regard to the cargo landed at Bahrain:-*^ s “ Only one steamer (belonging to Messrs. Strick) direct from Europe called during the year as against the 11 German steamers. F At present a large proportion of the sugar and matches imported bv the German steamers is to the order of Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. If they are to compete successfully with Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., it is difficult to see how import by German steamers is to be avoided, unless Messrs. Strick or some other British line, which calls at Continental sugar exporting torts ran hr induced to call at Bahrain. * ^ ^ ? 1 ' can be With the exception of crystal sugar, Hamburg shows a rise in the number of packages, as well as in the value thereof, sent to Bahrain during the current year over those of the last one. Following are the chief items : ^ 1910-11. 1911-12. Packages No. Value. Packages No Value. 1 1 *'Cotton piece goods 3 60 95 1,900 Gold thread 35 1,866 57 3 &gt; 0 4 ° Matches ... 170 453 54 i , »443 Sewing machines ... 16 53 3 ^ 120 Woollen goods 8 213 34 866“ Import of coffee was less by 46 bags only during the year than in the past. Lanterns to the extent of £53 came from Hamburg for the first time. Shipment of perfumery was also more than last year. “ Antwerp shows an increase over last year in goods shipped by about 500 packages in number and ;£ 12,300 in value. Difference is due mainly to 2,542 bags coffee, value ^12,710, having been shipped from Antwerp this year against nil in 1910-11. Crockery and gold thread were shipped during the year in greater quantities than previously. Blankets came for the first time from Antwerp during the year. No matches came from Antwerp this year against 70 cases last year. “ To sum up. therefore, the present year’s figures show that there was a decrease over last year in the number of packages brought by the Hamburg. Amerika Linie steamers in 1911-12 of 1,434 packages, but the value showed an increase of about .£18,233. Articles of merchandise such as coffee, gold thread, cotton and woollen goods, sewing machines, chinaware and matches, show marked increases. The following articles appear for the first time in the returns this year: blankets, broadcloth, cotton shawls, enamelware, gramophones, lanterns and woollen flannels and shawls.” Cargo for British firms.

What would have happened, one is tempted to ask if Herr R^ir had taken umbrage at the Bucknall line’s action ? P ’ HeiT Balhn We are confronted with a position in which Belgium is a larae source nf supply to the Persian Gulf, while the shipping lines working between the North Sea and the Gulf are British and German only. The firms which draw on Belgium for the bulk, nearly the whole of their exports to the Gulf are British houses with a definite and permanent connec- tion with the Persian Gulf and nol German. ^ nec „ ., therefore, from the point of view of Persian Gulf commercial policy the Bntish shipping lines have more claim to Belgian cargo, and to call at Antwerp for that cargo, than a German line. ^ That standpoint can only be controverted if shipping interests in London consider that Belgium s trade with the Gulf belongs to German shipping and if His Majesty s Government are prepared to acquiesce in that view. . ^ th* 3 ls n °t case, then it follows that British shipping companies interested are holding back from maintaining their right, either because they have been placated, or out of fear, or because of their being in a weaker position qua shipping companies, and their lack of financial backing and Government support. In either of these cases the situation can only be regarded with dismay. We are entering on a period of acute German competition in the Gulf, when the German Government is sparing no effort to create interests and place us in a position of inferiority in regard to shipping from Europe. The trade of the Gulf with the Continent through Antwerp is sure to grow faster than trade with the United ^Kingdom direct, while the exports of the United Kingdom are rela tively restricted in range. For these reasons it seems urgently necessary that the British shipping companies should call regularly for cargo at Antwerp, as they did up to 1908.B Position of the British shipping companies trading direct between Europe and the G«//.—There can be no gainsaying that the posmon of the British companies is not what it was in the Gulf before 1908, and that the chief cause of this is the encroachment of the Hamburg-Amenka company. Prior to the date mentioned the Anglo-Algerian (Stock), Bucknall and West Hartlepool lines constituted a combine, holding all the trade of the Gulf with Europe ; at Bushire alone 15,000 packages and more were commonly landed by each steamer. Owin 0- partly to German manoeuvres, it would seem, the combine was dis solved • the West Hartlepool line have dropped out and not been replaced, i he Bucknall line have been through company difficulties, and their management in London has been changed. The whole of the Antwerp (and Hamburg) trade has been surrendered into the hands of the Hamburg-Amerika line, by arrange ment it would appear, with the Anglo-Algenan and Bucknall lines ; and taking Bushire for instance, 3,500—4poo packages is the average number of packages now landed by each vessel, while the German company s share in the proportion of all packages 1 landed is 2-5ths to 3-5ths by the British lines. * As to the Anglo-Algerian Company and Mr. Strick, the latter s connection with Sir T. Ellerman has not so far enabled him to take a strong line in opposing German competition, eg., by regular calls at Antwerp or by regular sailings to Bahrain, Bandar Abbas and Lingah, where the German vessels call^ monthly; it may be remarked that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company employ special vessels to carry away their produce. Thus, however sound Mr. Stack’s position may be for the private interests of his own line, there is no evidence that the interests of general^ British import and export trade with the Gulf are being well-looked after, ms-a-vis German competition. The Board of Trade have, in addition to what has been written from the Gulf, had evidence first hand of the indisposition of Mr. Strick to meet require ments ” and of various reasons for dissatisfaction with his management of the export trade and with his vessels which are “ not well found.” Mr. Stack’s policy in many respects, seems as little mindful of our national interests as that of Mr. Lynch on the Tigris and the Karun, and on the Bakhtiari road. Some time in 1912 it would appear that he made sales, at a large profit of seven or eight vessels and was left with only six or eight of the “-stan ” line, several of which were under charter for the Indian trade, or elsewhere. In 1908 or 1909 he sold two vessels to the Hamburg-Amerika line, specially from the Gulf trade ; in 1912 two or three of the vessels Sold by him were to the same German company, which wanted larger vessels for the Gulf. We now see regularly vessels lately belonging to Mr. Strick calling at these ports, but under German names and flying the German flag. Seeing the communication to the Hamburg-Amerika line regarding a berth at Antwerp, hesitation of the British lines to compete at Antwerp, and these frequent sales to the German line, it is evident that the Anglo-Algerian (and Bucknall) lines are not in that position of independence which is warranted by the preponderance of British interests in the Gult. Mr. Strick has told the Board of Trade that he is prepared to fight the Hamburg-Amerika line “ should it encroach in any way on the sphere of operations of the British lines.” It has already encroached so much as to take away the Antwerp trade from the British lines, and a small portion of the Manchester cotton goods export, and produce is being constantly shipped from Gulf ports to London and Red Sea ports by the German line (only last week 120 tons from Bushire). The Strick line has acted on the defensive all along, beating a retreat each time the German company attacked. There can be no question as to the relative strength of the Hamburg-Amerika, the richest German company, with Herr Baffin and German Government support behind it, and the Strick line (even with Sir ]. Ellerman’s co-operation).*3 After carefully weighing the comparative position of the German and British shipping lines for Europe, present and prospectively, I have come to the conclu- * sion that the British shipping interests will shortly require strengthening and consolidating, with some more comprehensive direction of policy than the present dnft. So far, as has been mentioned above, the shipping competition has been in the direct trade with Europe, but the time is getting near when we shall see German vessels carrying cargo between Basrah and India; already German vessels, in a poor grain season in the Gulf, proceed to India to load. Once they start working between the Shatt-al-Arab and the Indian coast they will come into direct competition with the British India Steam Navigation Company one of the most powerful of all our British lines, and a fitting opponent for the Hamburg-Amenka line. * rr Would it not be possible in anticipation of that time, for the British India Steam Navigation Company to take a share in the direct trade between the United Kingdom and Antwerp, and the Gulf, and so strengthen the hands of companies like Strick ? For this same reason the report that Messrs. Marcus Samuel &amp; Co. are building a fleet of motor propelled vessels for the Gulf trade is to be welcomed, if a combination with the existing British lines is effect ed, and a policy of opposition to any encroachment by the Hamburgh-Amerika line maintained. &amp; C. Manchester exports to the Gutf.~\t is evident from the Board of Trade's statement regarding the expiry of Messrs. Strick’s contracts in 1914 that there is ample reason for His Majesty’s representatives in the Gulf to be uneasy as to the position. The situation of British shipping in the Gulf would be well nigh intolerable if a German company were to capture the carrying trade from England itself of the most important article of British trade to the Gulf or even part of it. Very grave results on the political situation in the Gulf would follow. It appears to us therefore of great importance that the Board of Trade should be acquainted with the negotiations leading to the conclusion of these new con tracts, and intervene with the British cotton goods exporters, should it appear that the Hamburg-Amerika line is trying to cut the rates offered by Messrs Strick &amp; Co. So opposed to our national interests would be any transfer by a Manchester firm of its goods for the Gulf from a British to a German shipping line, that I would unhesitatingly recommend that any such movement should be stifled before actually taking shape, and, if persisted in by British firms, that protection in Persia for those goods would be withdrawn by our Consular representatives. Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. could presumably supply the Board of Trade with a list of firms, with which shipping contracts have to be renewed, and the inten tions of these firms might be informally ascertained. Or if the Board of Trade do not see their way to act, perhaps there would be no objection to this Consu late General giving informal hints to the exporting firms in Manchester, with a large number of which this Consulate General has some personal acquaintance and not infrequently, correspondence. I instance :— Messrs. David Sassoon &amp; Co., Ltd. E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co. Ziegler &amp; Co. * Dixon &amp; Co. Livingstone Zeytoon &amp; Co., Ltd. Haji Ali Akbar &amp; Sons, Ltd. Times Dharwar &amp; Co. I. Y. Isaacs &amp; Co. D. E. Somech &amp; Co. Shamash Bros. C 78 FDH W. W. Churchill &amp; Co., Ltd. Lyon Lord &amp; Co. Holdsworth Hougie &amp; Co. A. Elias &amp; Sons. It is submitted that we have got to meet political support of the premier German shipping line by political support of the British shipping lines, and we cannot stand by unconcerned and see contracts in Great Britain go to our political and commercial opponents in the Gulf. In this connection, slight comment may be made on the remark that “ Messrs. Strick &amp; Co ’s contracts cover practically the whole of Manchester exports.” If reference be made to the report for the year October 1910-fi and the heading “ Shipments of Manchester cottons via Hamburg ” it was there stated that, f ' In about six months 500—600 bales have already been sent to Bushire (from Manchester) by this route {i.e , Manchester, Hamburg and Hamburg- Amerika line to the Gulf), others for Kuwait, ana others probably for Baghdad.” The figures for October [911-12 show that the number of bales carried by the German steamers to Persian and Arab ports was 7,7^5 as against 424 and 263 in the two previous years ; and 3,085 bales of cottons, woollens, etc , to Basrah as against 1,301 in the previous year—-an unsatisfactory increase from the British point of view. At Bushire alone 1,117 bales of Manchester cotton goods were landed from the German steamers (and 79 bales for Kuwait) of which :— Bales. Holdsvvorth Hougie &amp; Co. ... ... ... 577 Abdulla Elias &amp; Sons ... ... ... ... 1^2 W. W. Churchill &amp; Co , Ltd ... ... ... 217 Ziegler &amp; Co. ... ... ... ... 2»o Total ... 1,156 For purposes of comparison it may be noted that Messrs. Strick &amp; Go 's and the Bucknall steamers landed at Bushire 29,654 bales respectively during the Persian year March 21st, 1912-13 Though the number of Manchester bales now imported by German steamers forms a very small proportion in comparison, it is sufficiently large to make it worth while for Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. to take this cargo away from the German vessels. When the question of insurance is settled, this should not be very difficult. Mr. S. Hougie, a partner in one of the firms mentioned and who also first reported to this Consulate General German intrigues in Manchester, wrote on 29th July 1912 from Baghdad “ We have practically shipped nothing for 3—4 months to Bushire. I have personally written to my partner to ship with the British lines, and l hope that he has already done this. I have again reminded him to do this.” In connection with this piece-goods trade it will readily be understood that one of the dangers of the Manchester trade getting into the hands of the German shipping company, is the probability of these goods, once German carried, being gradually displaced by German made goods ; and it will be of interest to^ note that many Baghdadis are now starting to do business in Hamburg and Germany, or working with merchants in Germany, e g.

The first 9 vessels have landed 2 7 ’. 1 ? 4 P acka ges from Hamburg and 66,702 from Antwerp at Bushire alone of which no less than 26,276 and 63,224 were respectively crystal and ’loaf (AugL h M9T)-- eC0meSf,0m BaSrahwhere 3 P rominent British firm writes “ The Germans have been getting enormous freights for this sugar trade owing to merchants preferring the Belgian (principally) loaf sugar. I heard from K. yesterday that his next two steamers are bringing forward no less than 20,000 packages. In the circumstances, if the supply of loaf sugar is to remain with Belgium the suggestion is again put forward that British firms buying sugar for the Gulf’ and sugar brokers, like Messrs. Czarnikqw, should be asked to insist on the refiners m Belgium shipping only in British vessels, either by transhipment via London, when the cost might be slightly increased, or else in British ships direct from Antwerp (especially if Sir J. Ellerman now holds a berth for the Bucknall line at that port). Insistence to this end by British buyers in London with the refinery would have this much in its favour that the Hamburg-Amerika line would not be able to blame Messrs. Strick for any loss of cargo. That need of some action by His Majesty’s Government to neturalise the position which the German line are gaining through their monopoly of the transport of sugar to the Gulf is widely recognised may be seen from the follow ing extract from the remarks of Major Hawmrth at Muhammerah. P CfQi6 “ It appears to me that it is hardly to be expected that private firms will be got to adopt, at their own expense, a system of protection for the benefit of their Government which refuses the entire principle of that system. “ It is evidently political and not commercial encroachment which is to be feared, though essayed under the veil of commerce. “ It would seem that it is .a matter with which Government should deal rather than the firms concerned. “ I would suggest that ic it is to be considered that the time has come— and there is little doubt that the time has arrived— when it is necessary to take some active measures to meet German enterprise, these measures should take the form either of shipping subsidies or customs rebates. “ Were the principle of the necessity of Government assistance recognised, we should be in a position to suggest to British firms that they could without much extra cost insist on their brokers arranging for all Belgian sugar to be transhipped via London to the Gulf/’ E. TJib 'Persian' export trade in There seems to have been some confusion of the point at issue in the minds of both the Board of Trade and Mr. Strick, whose view is given. The case of rates of freight has been argued from the Basrah point of view, not from that of Persian grain. Mr. Strick has an agency at Basrah, where his firm are themselves exporters; but not in Bushire, where the complaints as to German overbidding in 1911 - 12 ^ were even stronger than in Basrah. He has no personal interest in Bushire grain, and his views as to “ speculators, ” however much they may apply to Basrah, and in a smaller degree to Muhammerah, have no bearing on the Bushire situation. At Bushire, grain is sold in the open market as each native boat arrives and there are never any Persian holders of large quantities, while in the case of grain purchased, as the bulk of it is, at small coast ports, the wheat brought in each day is strictly divided among the number of buyers or firms’ agents. Secondly, though the German grain exports have been mainly barley, and the complaints of British firms at Basrah are based on the purchase and ship ment of barley by Messrs. Wonckhaus, equally loud complaints from British firms at Bushire have been connected with the overbidding by the Germans in the purchase of wheat. This is quite a different matter. London is a better market for wheat than Hamburg, and in the case of the S. S. “ Ivydene ” and S. S. “ Ellaline ” in the year under report, the German firm sent cargoes of this wheat to London to be marketed. They were thus on level terms with British exporting merchants as regards market prices in London, and in^ order to balance the higher prices of purchase in Bushire and their overbidding, it is clear that they must have obtained a low rate of freight, or otherwise been compen sated by their firm, or the Hamburg-Amerika line. The explanations given by Mr. Strick to the Board of Trade, and the deduc tions drawn by the Board of Trade as regards British firms not being able to get quotations by the Hamburg-Amerika line furnish therefore no answer to the question of overbidding in regarding wheat —a more valuable and important export than barley—nor to the difficulty at Bushire. Further when the Board of Trade aver that there is no evidence regarding low freights on the Hamburg- Amerika line vessels, it is respectfully submitted that in the letter of the Manager of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., Basrah, quoted on page 13 of the printed report of last year, the phrase, “ As we ship in bulk, have cheaper freights^ etc. ” is ample evidence. During the year under report and the year October 1912 - 13 , which will follow, the questions of unequal competition beween British and German firms in the purchase of grain, of overbidding and cheaper freights by the Germans, have not been prominent at Bushire owing to the poor harvest of 1912 and the total failure in parts of the harvest of 1913 . Neither German nor British firms have been able to buy since March 1912 , and little for a month or two pre viously. The question will however re-appear, and probably more acutely, when the next good grain season comes.British policy towards Ge&gt;tncifi shipping and trade m the Persian ^ Gulf. The Board of Trade memorandum, in its concluding sentence, negatived the various suggestions and proposals made in former reports from this office as of little use until order was restored in Southern Persia. + Though the vital importance of security to British firms engaged in trade with Southern Persia is fully recognised and endorsed by _ His Majesty’s repre sentatives in the Gulf, the argument that the measures hitherto advocated for checking German commercial and political progress in the Persian Gulf as a whole are affected by the position of certain British firms and of British trade m Southern Persia, is not clearly relevant. The position up the Shatt-al-Arab, at Basrah, Baghdad and Muhammerah, for instance, is in no way concerned with the British firms trading in Southern Persia Similarly, at Bahrain, loaf sugar, the greatest import by German ships, is «ent out to the Gulf by British firms and brokers; but even when consigned to South Persian ports, it is for delivery to Persian consignees, and when the Board of Trade learns from firms in England that, given security in Southern Persia, they can meet German competition, these firms must have forgotten all about the Belgian su^ar and other articles shipped by themselves in German ships, or these are '’not considered by them as adjuncts to German competition. The statement too that the export trade of Southern Persia 'is impeded by disorder ' is also very incorrect, even generally speaking, as regards gum, carpets, etc.; and as to the export of grain, which is confined to Arabistan and the littoral south of the hills (transport will not pay above them), these districts have been tranquil through all the years of disorder in the interior. The conclusions and criticisms arrived at by the Board of Trade were purely negative. There was no determination of the methods that might be pursued to check the increase of German trade and shipping, of w'hich we had been awaiting a sign. As regards Persian ports, increased security, a revival of trade, would mean increased business of the British firms with Southern Persia, but it is very doubtful whether it would not mean increased German shipments and shipping as well; at any rate it could hardly produce the opposi tion to German progress, which is the essential to-day. During six years the German shipping line has made very great strides up the Persian Gulf, but always in a sense antagonistic to British interests. It is clear that with its numerous business connections it has the power to inflict greater damage still. Reports have been constantly sent in to His Majesty’s Government, pointing out the progress made by German interests, and the dangers ahead, if checks are not applied. Yet none of the suggestions have been tried, even experimentally. German interests are being created rapidly, yet His Majesty’s Government, though apprehensive, have so far offered no opposition, through British Commercial interests in London, or by adopting the suggestions of their representatives in the Persian Gulf. The advance of German commercial and political interests in the Gulf will not be met by a policy of drift, and “ do nothing active,” which has been the line up till now. There can be no doubt of the danger threatening the British position in the Gulf, for, as in the case of the Russian advance in Central Persia and descent to the neutral zone, it can he said that in proportion as German shipping interests and trade interests in the Gulf grow, the greater will become the claim of Germany to a share in the political position too. There are German subjects and interests :— At Baghdad :— The Railway Company. Messrs. Berk Puttmann &amp; Co. Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co.19 At Basrah : — Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. The Railway Company. At Mu hammer ah :—- Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. At Bus hire :— Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. A Consul. At Shiraz :— Herr Roever (an exporter of gum) with assistant. Herr Appelt (an Austrian interested in carpets). Dr. Pugin (a commercial agent who has made 2 stays in Shiraz). 1 The German Consul at Bushire (in the summer). Two German military attaches have recently been there. At Lingah :— Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. At Bahrain :— Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. At Kerman - Herr Bruggmann (a carpet exporter working for a German or an Austrian firm). On this frame work of German interests, the Germans have advanced claims of great importance:— recently (1) A share in the Anglo-Turkish commission for the navigation of the bhatt-al-Arab. (2) A German cable to a point in the Persian Gulf. (3) A share in any constructional works in Persia. (4) To participate in the navigation of the Karun from Muhammerah to Ahwaz (in competition with Messrs. Lynch Bros.). These matters are outside the province of the present report, but they are mentioned as instances of continual efforts by Germany to increase her interests, in antithesis to the absence of efforts by Great Britain to decrease existing' German interests. A fifth demand (by Herr Baffin)— “ —no through rates to be quoted by the British India Steam Navigation Company or any other company from Europe to Baghdad by water, or if such rates are quoted, the Hamburg-Amerika line to have the right of quoting on terms as favourable as any other company—” appears even more dangerous in tendency, if accepted by British interests. For the first alternative seems to aim at hampering the British India Steam Navigation Company and as to the20 second, it may be read (and distrusted) in the light of Mr. George Uoyd, M.P/s remarks in his report of 1907 on British Trade in Mesopotamia, Communi cations (lit) Ocean Transport:— “ And here it is necessary to point out that any minimum rate agreement with a German line is likely to be detrimental to the trade of the British lines. The system that obtains in Germany for through rates from an inland town in Germany on German State Railways to a port or inland town abroad would make it absolutely impossible to ascertain how far a German shipping company is faithful in maintaining the minimum rate.” The remainder of Mr. G. Lloyd’s remarks on this subject are of great importance. In this connection the notes in the Board of Trade Journal of 26th June 1913 on “Freight rates from German inland towns ” are also of interest and warning:— There are no through tariff quotations from German inland towns to foreign countries, excepting those to the Levant and German East Africa. The present would seem a good time for a visit by a representative of the Board of Trade 0/ the Foreign Office to the Gulf, in order to ascertain on the spot in what directions Government interference might be exercised, the posi tion of British shipping companies improved, or the policy of British firms influenced. This course would be the most welcome to His Majesty’s represen tatives in the Gulf. Failing this, it is respectfully submitted that the suggestion made in this and previous reports might be experimentally sanctioned, and assisted in execu tion by Government, faute demieux. No harm could be done ; and it would be seen by the results whether they produced a diminution of German borne trade to and from the Gulf. The chief desiderata and points of policy are: — (1) Sugar. —To prevent German steamers obtaining control of the carriage of loaf sugar to the Gulf and to diminish the amounts shipped by them at present. This would be effected :— (a) By arranging with the Bucknall Steamship line for a regular monthly call at Antwerp. (b) By inviting firms in England, now shippers of Belgian loaf sugar to the Persian Gulf, and the London sugar brokers, to insist on the refinery or refinery’s agents shipping their consignments in British vessels from Antwerp. Alternatively, if the.refinery and refinery’s agents refused, shipment by British steamer to Bombay (for transhipment by British India Steam Navigation Company), or delivery at London (for transhipment to the Gulf). (2) Steps similar to those in (la) and (\b) to be taken with Hindu mer chants at Bandar Abbas, and British firms in England, as regards other Belgian cargo, i.e. t candles, iron bars, etc. (3) To strengthen the position of the home lines vis-a-vis the Hamburg line, and give them similar strength of backing, either :— (a) By inviting the British India Steam Navigation Company to institute sailings between the United Kingdom, Antwerp and the Gulf in close co-operation, and under an understanding with Mr. F. C. Strick and Sir J. Ellerman ; or {b) By getting other lines, e.g., Marcus Samuel &amp; Co., Andrew Weir &amp; Co., and others to support the Bucknall and Strick lines in oppo sition to the Hamburg-Amerika. (4) Regular calls at all ports. —To arrange with Mr. Strick, Sir J Ellerman and the British India Company or other line for regular monthly sailings, or oftener, from the United Kingdom and Antwerp to the Gulf—to be by scheduled time as approximately as possible—and these calls to include Bahrain and Lingah regularly.(In the year under review only one such streamer called at Bahrain against u German ; and 4 as against 12 German at Lingah.) (5) Cotton goods. 10 secure with the knowledge of His Majesty’s Govern ment, the renewal of the contracts for Manchester cotton goods with the Strick line or other British lines, to advise firms in Manchester accordingly; to take action in Manchester to prevent intrigues there by the Hamburg-Amerika line. (6) ^ Any firms in Manchester at present not under contract, or who have been shipping cottons via Hamburg to the Gulf, to be invited by the British shipping lines to ship by them. (7) Wood .—To get British firms at Basrah importing wood for date-boxes, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Muhammerah to use Indian (Mysore) wood in place of the Swedish and others now carried in German vessels. The Government of India to lend its assistance to the Mysore State to facilitate this, and obtain cheap freights with the British India Steam Navigation Company. (8) Grain .—In seasons of export of grain, particularly wheat, from Persian ports (not Basrah) the Strick, Bucknall and other direct lines to be asked to provide regular sailings to the United Kingdom and reserve a sufficient amount of space for Muhammerah and Bushire cargo ; and, whenever the German firm is underbidding British firms buying wheat and seeds, to reduce freight suffi ciently to allow British shippers of wheat to compete. (9) British lighterage company at Bushire and Bandar Abbas. (10) Formation of Persian Gulf Sections of the London and Manchester Chambers of Commerce. (11) Government to sanction the purchase by His Majesty’s represent atives at the various ports of samples of goods imported by German steamers, which seem capable of being produced likewise in Great Britain. (This was last done in 1908.) (12) Importers in Persian and Arab ports of manufactures such as woollen goods, velvets, candles, by German steamers and from Humburg and Antwerp to be approached through His Majesty’s Consulates and Political Agencies for details of prices, samples, etc. These to be sent to the Board of Trade, and the importers to be put in touch with manufacturers and sellers of similar goods in England. Exporters at the various ports in any way connected with British interests, to be urged to ship to the United Kingdom in British vessels only. A great decrease of cargo in the German vessels and a decline in the posi tion of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie would at once result, if the above measures were approved, and undertaken in England and the Gulf.

IN continuation of previous annual reports, I have the honour to submit for your information Mr. Chick’s Report on German Trade and Shipping for 1911-12. His last report was forwarded on the 21st November, 1912, since which date the Board of Trade and the Government of India have given very full consideration to the difficult problem confronting them in the progress of German competition with us in the Gulf and the urgent need for constructive measures for meeting it. Broadly speaking, both authorities recognise the position to have become serious. The former hold that the competition is organised on political and not commercial principles, and that the remedy must run on similar lines ; while the Government of India concur in this view, but consider that it is not easy to determine the direction in which action is possible in order to safeguard British interests. Meanwhile, in the past few months, during the course of the negotiations now nearing completion on the subject of the Bagdad Railway and kindred problems, the German Government have demonstrated unmistakably their determination to maintain and improve their commercial position in this sphere by all means in their power. They have, in fact, put forward certain definite pretensions designed to secure the establishment and recognition of their shipping interests and their claim to participate in future enterprises. It seems clear, in fact, that Germany will henceforth demand to take her share on pretty much the same plane as ourselves in any commercial developments which may ensue. Germany’s successful politico-commercial competition has only been made possible by closely concerted action between the representatives of her commerce and politics, and unless we can devise means of meeting it by a similar combination of forces, I fear we shall not only fail to make headway, but shall continue to lose ground, as we have done for several years past. Here in the Gulf we have always sought to maintain the view that a good deal could be done to impede German progress, and we have continued to make specific suggestions to this end. But, so far, they have not been deemed possible of adoption, and in the last Board of Trade memorandum on the subject the discouraging conclusion is arrived at that “ until order is secured in Southern Persia, none of the proposals that have been put forward could be of any very appreciable utility.” Conversely, it would seem that in the view of the Board of Trade and the Government of India the restoration of order in Southern Persia will in itself put British firms in a position to offer successful resistance to German competition. British traders may use, and appear to have used, this argument in order to induce the Government to take up more actively the question of security for trade on the caravan routes in Southern Persia; but, apart from that aspect of it, I cannot help thinking that the theory is to a great extent a fallacious one. No doubt trade in general to inland Persia will show an / improvement in proportion to the increase of security achieved, but all trade will share this advantage ; if will not affect the ability of the German element to compete with us successfully in the Gulf, as they are doing now, nor will it affect the position existing at Mohammerah, Basra, or the Arab ports of the Gulf. For example, an improvement in the situation in Ears will not make Mr. Strick any more inclined than he is at present to provide regular sailings to and from Bahrein, nor will it reduce Messrs. Wonckhaus’s exports of grain from the Shatt-el-Arab. The detailed suggestions made in the present report, in development of those previously submitted, aim at regaining for direct British shipping from the United Kingdom to the Gulf the independent position which they formerly held and the recovery for them of the cargoes now carried in German bottoms; and in this con nection I would direct attention to the fresh suggestion now put forward by Mr. Chick with that end in view, namely, that the entry of a powerful line like the British India [1898 /—l] • B Copy to F T7U1 ; ’ 0 .. ...JL *, Steam Navigation Company into can-ying Ca'nnotX!

Clearly, Ti is bfrlev ihat Germany wants and we cannot use, we should endeavour to enclrab [he cultivation of wheat (which we can find a market for; in connection with any irrigation schemes with which we may be directly or indirectly identifie . J llclVG i&amp;G R Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty s Consul-General for Pars, &amp;c. Enclosure in No. 1. Report on German Trade and Shipping in the Persian Gulf for the period October 1911-12. THE period October 1911-12 corresponded with the sixth year of sailings of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie to the Persian Gulf. The five annual reports previously written on the same subject have been issued under the following numbers . No. 7, Commercial, November 27, 1907 (Foreign Department, India 2473). No. 2, „ May 12 , 1909 ( „ &gt;&gt; ” , r , f |' No. 4 „ June 8,1910 „ „ » 1546) No. 7, „ July 23,1911 „ „ » • No. 12, ,, November 21, 1912 ( „ » ” With reference to the remarks by the Board of Trade m their letter of the 1st March, 1913, to the Foreign Office, it should be borne m mind that the competition called into action by this premier German shipping line m its Persian Gull service is that of Continental Europe against Great Britain, and that this is by lar the most important and valuable section of trade in all the Gulf ports. Transhipment trade via India is on a smaller scale altogether, and tends to become less valuable each year, as the natural result of frequent direct communication with Europe, of the proportionally higher rates of freight prevailing between India and the Gulf, and other contingent reasons. The shipping trade between India and the Gulf in East Indian producs an produce can have no bearing on the present competition between the Hamburg- Amerika Linie and the British lines in the home trade, though it is quite conceivable that the German lines trading with India may, in the near future, arrange loi ^ erman ships to take in cargo at Bombay for the Persian Gulf. The following steamship lines regularly visited the Gulf in 1912 :— British India Steam Navigation Company (Limited). Bombay-Persia Steam Navigation Company (Limited). Arab Steamers (Limited). Russian Steamship Company. Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. (Limited). Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company (Limited). Bucknall Steamship Lines. West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company (Limited). Hamburg-Amerika Linie. The first three companies, for the very good reason just stated, cannot legitimately be included, either in their sailings or in the quantity of cargo landed at each Gull port, in any tables showing the competition of German with British shipping to the Gulf. (!&amp;Tlic Riiosian StoaiTisinp OoinpaDy, tlionyli lirnigmy far iiior© oar^'o to RGrsian ports tlian hoietofoie, deals only with special lines of business, does not trade with, the Aral) ports of Muscat and Bahrein, and can hardly be considered a factor in the German position versus British shipping and trade. Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. 'vThave b een &gt; by agreement with the other shipping lines from home, it is understood, debarred from bringing cargo to the Gulf, and their vessels only load grain and produce from Basra and Bushire lor the United Kingdom. When, as in 1913, the grain season is bad in the Gulf generally, Messrs. Weir’s vessels do not come to the Gulf at all. Thus, comparison of the sailings of the Hamburg—Amerika Linie during their sixth and previous years of sailings can only properly be made as follows :—• — October 1906-7. October 1907-8.

Up to 1907 the trade between Antwerp and the Persian Gulf was entirely in the hands of the British shipping companies. Analysis of Import Cargoes. Sugar, loaf and crystal, still formed the most important article by German vessels, and the line maintained the controlling position acquired by it in 1910-11, when its imports of sugar showed so remarkable an increase. 1908-9. 1909-10. 1910-11. - 1911-12.

Strick or some other British line, which calls at continental sugar-exporting ports, can be induced to call at Bahrein. “ With the exception of crystal sugar Hamburg shows a rise m the number of packages, as well as in the value thereof sent to Bahrein during the current year, over the last one.

Lanterns to the extent of 53L came from Hamburg for the first time. Shipment of perfumery was also more than last year. _ , “Antwerp shows an increase over last year m goods shipped by about oUu packages in number, and 12,300L in value. Difference is due mainly to 2,542 bags coffee, &amp; value 12,7101., having been shipped from Antwerp this year against nil m 1910-11. Crockery and gold thread were shipped during the year in greater quantities than previously. Blankets came for the first time from Antwerp during the year. No matches came from Antwerp this year against 70 cases last year. “ To sum up, therefore, the present year’s figures show that there was a decrease over last year in the number of packages brought by the Hamburg-Amerika Linie steamers in 1911-12 of 1,434 packages, but the value showed an increase of about 18,233Z. Articles of merchandise such as coffee, gold thread, cotton and woollen goods, sewing machines, chinaware, and matches, show marked increases. The following articles appear for the first time in the returns this year :—Blankets, broadcloth, cotton shawls, enamel ware, gramophones, lanterns, and woollen flannels and shawls.” Cargo for British Firms. The indications afforded by the Hamburg-Amerika manifests are not always sufficient to show the consignees at the various Gulf ports. But the following firms appear to have shipped goods by the German line during the year in question, in addition to the cotton goods alluded to elsewhere :— Bushire— E. D. Sassoon and Co.

Wonckhaus and Co. took away 6,140 tons of wheat from Buslnre for London, 800 tons of wheat from Mohammerah, and 740 tons barley from Mohammerah. Thus the German shipping company and Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. were together responsible for the export of about 58,183 tons of gram in 1911 1- from the Shatt-el-Arab and Bushire. Export Cargo from India and Burma. Three of the first four vessels in the year’s review proceeded from the Gulf to Bombay, the Malabar Coast and Colombo, and to Rangoon. From official information supplied from India it would appear that they loaded for Hamburg and other continental ports:— Tons. Cotton - ■ ‘ * 806 Manganese ore Gram Seeds Myrobalams Hemp ..

Package cargo from the Persian Gulf ports (figures given above) is calculated to have measured about 1,044 tons on the shipping scale; that from Basra about 9,000 tons. Adding this to the 50,503 tons grain carried from the Gulf, and 10,135 tons from India and Burmah, a total export cargo of some 70,682 tons is found, or an average of 5,890 tons for twelve vessels. In chartered vessels (exclusive of Basra cargo, which does not appear) 7,680 tons were carried. General Remarks. The Board of Trade memorandum of the 28th April has summarised the position very concisely in regard to the salient features of the composition of German and British shipping in the Gulf; in the main, the views expressed coincided with those held by His Majesty’s representatives here, by whom this expression of opinion by the Board of Trade has been much appreciated. This circumstance makes it possible to take that memorandum as a basis for discussion and suggestion in dealing with German competition. The following comments are respectfully submitted on various points treated in that memorandum:— (A.) Belgian Trade and Exports to the Mokj-ian Gulf. It is welcome news that the Bucknall line has secured a berth at Antwerp witli a view to maintaining the “ right ” of British vessels in the Gulf trade to do so ; though it would not appear that any vessels of that line have used that berth so far. But that the British line should need to inform the Plamburg-Amerika line of the change betokens a very inconvenient state of affairs, and would almost point to this being done iu fear, and by the previous consent of the Hamburg-Amerika line. Whatwould have happened one is tempted to ask, if Herr Ballin had taken umbrage at the Bucknali line s action ? ” ■\\e are confronted with a position m which Belgium is a large source of supply A 0 t 1 } 6 Per |P n V ,ulf ’A Me tlle s “PP^S l^es working between the North Sea and the ' irult are Jbntisii and (ierman only. The firnis which draw on Belgium for the bulk—nearly the whole—of their exports to the Gulf are British houses with a definite and permanent connection with the rersian Gull, and not German. . Therefore from the point of view of Persian Gulf commercial policy, the British shipping lines have more claim to Belgian cargo, and to call at Antwerp for that cargo, than a German line. That standpoint can only be controverted if shipping interests in London consider that Belgium s trade with the Gulf belongs to German shipping, and if His Maiesty s Government are prepared to acquiesce in that view. If this is not the case, then it follows that British shipping companies interested are holding back from maintaining their right, either because they have been placated, or out of leai, or because of their being m a weaker position quo, shipping companies, and their lack of financial backing and Government support. In either of these cases the situation can only be regarded with dismay. We are entering on a period of acute German competition in the Gulf, when the German Government is sparing no effort to create interests and place us in a position of inferiority in regard to shipping from Europe. The trade of the Gulf with the continent through Antwerp is sure to grow faster than trade with the United Kingdom direct, while the exports of the United Kingdom are relatively restricted in range. For these reasons it seems urgently necessary that the British shipping companies should call regularly for cargo at Antwerp, as they did up to 1908. (B.) Position of the British Shipping Companies Trading direct between Europe and the Gulf. There can be no gainsaying that the position of the British companies is not what it was in the Gulf before 1908, and that the chief cause of this is the encroachment of the Hamburg—Amerika company. Prior to the date mentioned, the Anglo-Algerian (Strick\ Bucknali, and West Hartlepool lines constituted a combine, holding all the trade of the Gulf with Europe; at Bushire alone 15,000 packages and more were commonly landed by each steamer. Owing partly to German manoeuvres, it would seem, the company was dissolved ; the West Hartlepool line have dropped out and not been replaced. The Bucknall line have been through company difficulties, and their management in London has been changed. The whole of the Antwerp (and Hamburg) trade has been surrendered into the hands of the Hamburg-Amerika line, by arrangement, it would appear, with the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall lines; and taking Bushire, for instance, 3,500 to 4,000 is the average number of packages now landed by each vessel, while the German company’s share in the proportion of all packages landed is two-fifths to three-fifths by the British lines. As to the Anglo-Algerian Company and Mr. Strick, the latter’s connection with Sir J. Ellerman has not so far enabled him to take a strong line in opposing German competition, e.g., by regular calls at Antwerp or by regular sailings to Bahrein, Bunder Abbas, and Lingeh, where the German vessels call monthly ; it may be remarked that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company employ special vessels to carry away their produce. Thus, however sound Mr. Strick’s position may be for the private interests of his own line, there is no evidence that the interests of general British import and export trade with the Gulf are being well looked after vis-d-vis German competition. The Board of Trade have, in addition to what has been written from the Gulf, had evidence first-hand of “ the indisposition of Mr. Strick to meet requirements,” and of various reas'ons for dissatisfaction with his management of the export trade and with his vessels, which are “ not well found.” Mr. Strick’s policy in many respects seems as little mindful of our national interests as that of Mr. Lynch on the Tigris and the Karun, and on the Bakhtiari road. Some time in 1912 it would appear that he made sales, at a large profit, of seven or eight vessels, and was left with only six or eight of the “ stan ” line, several of which were under charter for the Indian trade, or elsewhere. In 1908 or 1909 he sold two vessels to the Hamburg-Amerika line [1898 l—l] D10 specially for the Gulf trade ; in 1912 two or three of the vessels sold by him were to the same German company, which wanted larger vessels for the Gulf. e now see regXly vessels lately belonging to Mr. Strick eallmg at these ports, but under German names and flying the German flag. , i- ,, m i a kprit „ r Seeing the communication to the Hamburg-Amenka line regarding a pertn a Antwero hesitation of the British lines to compete at Antwerp and these frequent “X GeXn line, it is evident that the Anglo-A^ermn and Bu^ are not in that position of independence which is warranted by the preponderance ot British interests in the Gulf. Mr. Strick has told the Board of Irade that he is prepared to fight the Hamburg-Amerika line “ should it encroach in any way on the sphere of opfrations of the British lines.” It has already encroached so much as to take away the Antwerp trade from the British hues, and a small portion of the Sanchester cotton goods export, and produce is being constantly shipped from Gulf ports to London and Red Sea ports by the German line (only last week 120 tons from BUSh Ti^'Strict line has acted on the defensive all along, beating a retreat each time the German company attacked. There can be no question as to the relative strength of the Hamburg-Amerika, the richest German company with Herr Ballm and German Government support behind it, and the Strick line (even with Sir J. Ellermans ^After carefully weighing the comparative position of the German and British shipping lines for Europe, present and prospectively, I have come to the conclusion that the British shipping interests will shortly require strengthening an con- solidating with some more comprehensive direction of policy than the present n t. So far, as has been mentioned above, the shipping competition has been m the direct trade with Enrope, bnt the time is getting near when we shall see German vessels carrying cargo between Basra and India; already German vessels, m a poor grain season in the Gulf, proceed to India to load. Once they start working between the Shatt-el-Arab and the Indian coast they will come into direct competition with t e British India Steam Navigation Company, one of the most powerful ot all our British lines and a fitting opponent for the Hamburg-Amerika line. Would it not be possible, in anticipation of that time, for the British India Steam Navigation Company to take a share in the direct trade between the United Kingdom and Antwerp and the Gulf, and so strengthen the hands of companies like Strick f For this same reason the report that Messrs. Marcus Samuel and Co. are building a feet of motor-propelled vessels for the Gulf trade is to he welcomed if a combination with the existing British lines is effected, and a policy of opposition to any encroach ment by the Hamburg-Amerika line maintained. (C .)—Manchester Exports to the Gulf. It is evident from the Board of Trade’s statement regarding the expiry of Messrs. Strick’s contracts in 1914 that there is ample reason for His Majesty s representatives in the Gulf to he uneasy as to the position. The situafion of British shipping in the Gulf would he well-nigh intolerable if a German company were to capture the carrying trade from England itself of the most important article of British trade to the Gulf—or even part of it. Very grave results on the political situation m the Gulf would follow. m j u la It appears to ns, therefore, of great importance that the Board of Trade shonicl he acquainted with the negotiations leading to the conclusion of these new contracts, and intervene with the British cotton goods exporters, should it appear that the Hamburg-Amerika line is trying to cut the rates offered by Messrs. Strick and Co. So opposed to onr national interests would be any transfer by a Manchester ffrm of its goods for the Gulf from a British to a German shipping line, that I would unhesitatingly recommend that any such movement should be stifled, before actually taking shape, and, if persisted in by British firms, that protection in Persia for those goods would he withdrawn by onr consular representatives. Messrs. Strick and Co. could presumably supply the Board of Trade with a list of firms with which shipping contracts have to he renewed, and the intentions of these firms might he informally ascertained. Or if the Board of Trade do not see their way to act, perhaps there would be no objection to this consulate-general giving informal hints to the exporting firms in Manchester, with a large number of which thisconsulate-general has some personal acquaintance, and not infrequently correspondence. 1 instance — Messrs. David Sassoon and Co. (Limited). „ E. D. Sassoon and Co. ,, Ziegder and Co. ,, Dixon and Co. ,, Livingstone, Zeytoon, and Co. (Limited.) ,, Haji Ali Akbar and Sons (Limited). ,, Times, Dharwar, and Co. ,, I. Y. Isaacs and Co. ,, D. E. Somech and Co. ,, Sliamasli Brothers. „ AY. W. Churchill and Co. (Limited). „ Lyon, Lord, and Co. „ Holds worth, Hougie, and Co. „ A. Elias and Sons. It is submitted that we have got to meet political support of the premier German shipping line by political support of the British shipping lines, and we cannot stand by unconcerned and see contracts in Great Britain go to our political and commercial opponents in the Gulf. _ In this connection, slight comment may be made on the remark that “ Messrs. Strick snd Co.’s contracts cover practically the whole of Manchester exports.” If reference be made to the report for the year October 1910-11 and the heading “ Shipments of Manchester cottons via Hamburg,” it was there stated that, “ In about six months 500 —600 bales have already been sent to Bushire (from Manchester) by this route (i.e., Manchester, Hamburg, and Hamburg-Amerika line to the Gulf), others for Koweit, and others probably for Bagdad.” The figures for October 1911-12 show that the number of bales carried by the German steamers to Persian and Arab ports was 1,745, as against 424 and 263 in the two previous years ; and 3,085 bales of cottons, woollens, &amp;c,, to Basra, as against 1,304 in the previous year—an unsatisfactory increase from the British point of view. At Bushire alone 1,117 bales of Manchester cotton goods were landed from the German steamers (and 79 bales for Koweit), of wdiich:— Bales. Holdsworth, Ilougie, and Co. 577 Abdullah Elias and Sons 152 W. W. Churchill and Co. (Limited) .. 217 Ziegler and Co. .. 210 1,156 Eor purposes of comparison it may be noted that Messrs. Strick and Co.’s and the Bucknall steamers landed at Bushire 29,654 bales respectively during the Persian year 21st March, 1912—13. Though the number of Manchester bales now r imported by German steamers forms a very small proportion in comparison, it is sufficiently large to make it worth while for Messrs. Strick and Co. to take this cargo away from the German vessels. When this question of insurance is settled, this should not be very difficult. Mr. S. Hougie, a partner in one of the firms mentioned, and who also first reported to this consulate-general German intrigues in Manchester, wrote on the 29th July, 1912, from Bagdad : “ We have practically shipped nothing for three to four months to Bushire. I have personally written to my partner to ship with the British lines, and I hope that he has already done this. I have again reminded him to do this.” In connection with this piece-goods trade, it will readily be understood that one of the dangers of the Manchester trade getting into the hands of the German shipping company, is the probability of these goods, once German^ carried, being gradually being displaced by German-made goods ; and it will be of interest to note that many Bagdadis are now starting to do business in Hamburg and Germany, or working with merchants in Germany, e.g. :— Ezra Dangoor and Sons, Hamburg. Ruben Meneshi Shoheit, Hamburg. Ezra Kedouri Ezra Shamash. Ezra Silman Zilkha, Bagdad. W. Schweiger, Hamburg.(D.)— Sugar. It is satisfactory to learn that Mr. Strick’s contracts with the French refineries have still four years to run. But as regards the Belgi.-ui sugar, even if Mr. aneksfs view as to the possibility of a shipping war with the Hamburg-Amenka be correct tt Is questionable whether it is not now, or will be soon, a more urgent consideration for British shipping to get a share of the carrying trade of Belgian sugar to the Gulf, in view of the growing and imposing dimensions which this is rapidly lutaimng. Is Mr. Strick’s hesitation, for personal motives, to be the final surrender by is i ajesty s Government of a very important item of trade to the Germans, as a German interest. “ Which is quite unnecessary.” The fact that this seems so to Mr. Stnc sown interest does not obviate the need, for purposes of British political and commercial policy in the Gulf, of checking the Hamburg-Amenka line from holding the monopoly of transport of loaf sugar to the Gulf. . i ^ c , f Messrs. Tate and Sons’ objection to providing a new plant for the manufacture of loaf sugar in cones is no doubt reasonable, but it may be pointed out that crystal sugar will not replace loaf sugar in the requirements of this region, and is a much less important article of trade. , , , i-jt a Messrs. Tate and Sons’ crystals could undoubtedly be popularised by poiitica and consular officers in the Gulf, if special efforts were made, but Major Haworth remarks:— “ For this year (at Mohammerah) the average price of late s sugar has been od. to Is. 3d. per cwt. higher than that of the Germans, or Gd. to 2s. 6d. more per bag.. A small merchant importing, say, 100 bags per month, will purchase his German sugar at 21 15s. cheaper for that period than if he were buying the English article ; this is equivalent to 35Z. in the year, or for 1,000 bags per month 3oOL for the year. Unless Messrs. Tate see their way to selling their sugar at the same rate as ? the Germans are in a position to do, there will not be a great demand for their goods. No specific action in regard to loaf sugar has been proposed by the Board of 'P rac [ e In the seventh year of sailings (the year subsequent to this report) it will be found that German-borne cargo to Bushire has more than doubled, and that an enormous increase in loaf sugar has occurred. The first nine vessels have landed 2 * ,1/4 packages from Hamburg and 66,702 from Antwerp at Bushire alone, of which no less than 26,276 and 63,224 were respectively crystal and loaf sugar. The same tale comes from Basra, where a prominent British firm writes (August 1913) “ The Germans have been getting enormous freights for this sugar trade owing to merchants preferring the Belgian (principally) loaf sugar. I heard from K. yesterday that his next two steamers are bringing forward no less than 20,000 packages.” In the circumstances, if the supply of loaf sugar is to remain with Belgium, the suggestion is again put forward that British firms buying sugar for the Gulf and sugar brokers, like Messrs. Czarnikow, should be asked to insist on the refiners in Belgium shipping only in British vessels, either by transhipment via London, when the cost might be slightly increased, or else in British ships direct from Antwerp (especially if Sir J. Ellerman now holds a berth for the Bucknall line at that port). Insistence to this end by British buyers in London with the refinery would have this much in its favour that the Hamburg-Amerika line would not be able to blame Messrs. Strick for any loss of cargo. The need of some action by His Majesty’s Government to neutralise the position which the German line are gaining through their monopoly of the transport of sugar to the Gulf is widely recognised may be seen from the following extract from the remarks of Major Haworth at Mohammerah :— “ It appears to me that it is hardly to be expected that private firms will be got to adopt, at their own expense, a system of protection for the benefit of their Government which refuses the entire principle of that system. “ It is evidently political and not commercial encroachment which is to be feared, though essayed under the veil of commerce. “It would seem that it is a matter with which Government should deal rather than the firms concerned.Series '•^ii ^ioiifor 1 Gull, | H I Majesty’s ttteiest? | 'iek’soffn unniercial Monopoly factuie 0 [ f it ciystal 5 a miicl liticalail Haiofi been e per kg, s Gen li article; iteyffi rteasi oods,' Board oi , . befoul enoniioB • pachfs lesstki sjAfsi rar toif I teari less tta rim, to Ud ifoeis ii on,^ 1 Antwerp port). aid ^ to blame positi® afs# rom to will to of tto ir fearedi ratlier 13 “.I l w01 | lld i suggest that if it is to be considered that the time has come—and there is little doubt that the time has arrived—when it is necessary to take some active measures to meet German enterprise, these measures should take the form either of * shipping subsidies or customs rebates. ^ ^be principle of the necessity of Government assistance recognised we should be m a position to suggest to British firms that they could without much extra cost insist on theii biokers arranging for all Belgium sugar to be transhipped via London to the Gulf.” r (E .)—The “ Persian ” Export Trade in Grain. There seems to have been some confusion of • the point at issue in the minds of both the Board of Trade and Mr. Strick, whose view is given. The case of rates of freight has been argued from the Basra point of view, not from that of Persian gram. Air. Stuck has an agency at Basra, where his firm are themselves exporters g but not in Bushire, where the complaints as to German overbidding in 1911-12 were even stronger than in Basra. He has no personal interest in Bushire grain, and his views as to “ speculators,” however much they may apply to Basra, and in a smaller degree to Alohammerah, have no bearing on the Bushire situation. At Bushire grain is sold in the open market as each native boat arrives and there are never any Persian holders of large quantities, while in the case of grain purchased, as the bulk of it is, at small coast ports, the wheat brought in each day is strictly divided among the number of buyers or firms’ agents. Secondly, though the German grain exports have been mainly barley and the complaints of British firms at Basra are based on the purchase and shipment of barley by Alessrs. Wonckhaus, equally loud complaints from British firms at Bushire have been connected with the overbidding by the Germans in the purchase of wheat. This is quite a different matter. London is a better market for wheat than Hamburg, and in the case of the steamship “ Ivydene ” and steamship “ Ellaline ” in the year under report the German firm sent cargoes of this wheat to London to be marketed. They were thus on level terms with British exporting merchants as regards market prices in London, and, in order to balance the higher prices of purchase in Bushire and their overbidding, it is clear that they must have obtained a low rate of freight, or otherwise been compensated by their firm, or the Hamburg-Amerika line. The explanations given by Air. Strick to the Board of Trade, and the deductions drawn by the Board of Trade as regards British firms not being able to get quotations by the Hamburg-Amerika line, furnish, therefore, no answer to the question of over bidding in regarding wheat—a more valuable and important export than barley—nor to the difficulty at Bushire. Further, when the Board of Trade aver that there is no evidence regarding low freights on the blamburg-Amerika line vessels, it is respect fully submitted that in the letter of the manager of Alessrs. Wonckhaus and Co., Basra, quoted on page 13 of the printed report of last year the phrase, “ As we ship in hulk, have cheaper freights, &amp;c,” is ample evidence. During the year under report, and the year October 1912-13 which will follow, the questions of unequal competition between British and German firms in the purchase of grain, of overbidding, and cheaper freights by the Germans have not been prominent at Bushire owing to the poor harvest of 191.2 and the total failure in parts of the harvest of 1913. Neither German nor British firms have been able to buy since Alarch 1912, and little for a month or two previously. The question will, however, reappear, and probably more acutely, when the next good grain season comes. It will be seen from the Basra Trade Report for 1912 that the export of wheat there stands in the proportion of less than one-fifth to four-fifths barley, whereas at Bushire the export of wheat in 1911—12 was twice that of barley (and even then the barley export was principally by the German firm). It would thus seem as if a problem will arise over the construction of the -Mohammerah—Khorremabad Railway, a line advocated as a British safeguard against the expansion of German trade and enterprise, in connection with the great^ expansion in the export of grain at Alohammerah which is expected to follow this and the irrigation schemes. If barley is to be the principal export, and not wheat, then the line will obviously increase German trade between Arabistan and Hamburg and benefit British trade little or not at all. On the other hand, if wheat is the principal export, for which London has the better market, then how. are we to prevent the Germans securing, by a continuance of the cheaper freights, and consequent ability to oveibid, [1898 l — 1 ] E14 the bulk of the wheat brought down the coast when they are buying their barley (wheat and barley being generally brought in for sale mixed in the proportion of 3:1)? Presumably, such an advantageous position for the G ei mans could only be met by rebates bv the railway company for direct exports to Great Britain and India, or by rebates, or lowering of freight, of British shipping companies, or by His Majesty^ Government granting a subsidy to equalise British and Geiman lates of fi eight. In this connection the recent negotiations regarding rates of freight by the Bagdad-Basra railway and the new Anglo-Turkish navigation combine are of interest. (F.)— The question of a Subsidy. The Board of Trade are no doubt correct in saying that from a purely commercial point of view the exports of Persia are not important enough to justify a grant, and that a subsidy could only be defended for reasons predominantly political. But presumably, if the political reasons were sufficiently strong, then a subsidy would be defensible. This is exactly our contention. Such damage is done to British interests in the Gulf grain trade by the German methods, and so unduly enhanced is German prestige and influence by their power to buy more freely than British merchants, that it has become politically advisable to prevent the Germans encroaching further on the British position. The risk of a subsidy to British steamer services being made public would, in any case, be preferable to allowing the former British position in the export trade of the Gulf to be completely usurped by the Germans, and the British public remain in ignorance of this development. Moreover, is there any reason why British subvention of the export trade from the Gulf would be any more public than the present subsidy and financial support which Messrs. Wonckhaus enjoy ? All that would be needed would be to fix the current rate of freight for grain homewards for the season or year at 205. per ton, or as the case may be, and then a reduction up to 5s. be allowed by Messrs. Strick’s agents on all shipments of grain to England. In this manner extent of the subvention would be narrowed, for exports of barley to Hamburg by British firms would not benefit. Without going as far as a subsidy, it might, however, be possible for Government to impress on Messrs. Strick and Co. and other shipowners the political necessity for cheaper rates of freight when the time comes round. (G.)— Lighterage. The Board of Trade state that, according to Mr. Strick, the matter of a lighterage service in Bushire has been under the consideration of Lord Inchcape, and that Mr. Strick would communicate with the latter. Would it not be possible for the Board of Trade to ask both Lord Inchcape and Mr. Strick for the result of their discussions in regard to this matter, and thus advance matters a step ? The extension of such a project to Bunder Abbas has been advocated by the British India Steam Navigation Company in the past. For that reason, and for the better financial prospects that would offer themselves if several ports were covered by the lighterage comyany, Bunder Abbas has been included in the scheme recommended previously. It may be noted also that there is a movement by the shipping companies at Mohammerah and Bahrein to manage the lightering of their own cargo. British Policy towards German Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf. The Board of Trade memorandum, in its concluding sentence, negatived the various suggestions and proposals made in former reports from this office as of little use until order was restored in Southern Persia. Though the vital importance of security to British firms engaged in trade with Southern Persia is fully recognised and endorsed by His Majesty’s representatives in the Gulf, the argument, that the measures hitherto advocated for checking German commercial and political progress in the Persian Gulf as a wffiole are affected by the position of certain British firms and of British trade in Southern Persia, is not clearly relevant. The position up the Shatt-el-Arab, at Basra, Bagdad, and Mohammerah, for instance, is in no way concerned with the British firms trading in Southern Persia. Similarly, at Bahrein, loaf-sugar, the greatest import by German ships, is sent out to the Gulf by British firms and brokers; but even when consigned to South Persianports, it IS for delivery to Persian consignees, and when the Board of Trade learns from Wfo iU tt 80 't r, i P “&gt; ^ can meet competition, tnebc rirms must have torgotten all about the UeWn suuar and nth or articles shipped by themselves in German ships, or these are not considered by them 1^1° disorder ” f atementtoo tha ‘ -port tmde of Sohhem , 1 { disoidei is also very incorrect, even generally sneakine- as regards gum carpets &amp;e„ and as to the export of grain which is confined fo Arabistan and the littoral south of the hills (transport wilfnot W above them) these districts have been tranquil through all the years of disorder iu the interior ’ The conclusions and criticisms arrived at by the Board of Trade were purely negative. There was no determination of tl.e methods that might be puhS to check the increase of German trade and shipping, of which we had been awahing a sUn business of theXitHi^T^bT q eC '!' lty&gt; 8 fV™! of trade, would mean increased business ot tiie lintisli firms with Southern Persia, but it is very doubtful whether !t would not mean increased German shipments and shipping as well; at any rate h C ° U Durin/fiV th ? 0p P 0Sltl0n to German progress, which is the essential to-day. During six years the German shipping line has made very great strides up the Persian Gulf, and always m a sense antagonistic to British interests. It is cleaihhat with its numerous business connections it has the power to inflict greater damage stfll Reports have been constantly sent in to His Majesty’s Government, pointhig out pplhPTei” by German mtere f s ’ dangers ahead, if checks are not applied 1 et none of the suggestions have been Tried, even experimentally. German interests are being created rapidly, yet His Majesty’s Government, though apprehensive have so far offered no opposition, through British commercial interests in London or by adopting tiie suggestions of their representatives in the Persian Gulf. The advance of German commercial and political interests in the Gulf will not be met by a policy of drift, and “ do nothing active,” which has been the line up till now. 1 here can be no doubt of the danger threatening the British position in the Gulf tor, as m the case of the Russian advance in Central Persia and descent to the neutral ^ lt ^ ai 1 \ 3e sai( ^ Y la t in proportion as German shipping interests and trade interests m the Gull grow, the greater will become the claim of Germany to a share in the political position too. There are German subjects and interests :— At Bagdad— The railway company. Messrs. Berk Puttmann and Co. Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Co. A small school. A consul. At Basra— Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. The railway company. At Mohammerah— Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. At Bn shire— Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. A consul. At Shiraz— Herr Roever (an exporter of gum) with assistant. Herr Appelt (an Austrian interested in carpets). Dr. Pugin (a commercial agent who has made two stays in Shiraz). The German consul at Bushire (in the summer). Two German military attaches have recently been there. At Lingah— Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. At Bahrein— Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. At Kirman— Herr Bruggmann (a carpet exporter working for a German or an Austrian firm).16 On this framework of German interests, the Germans have recently advanced claims of great importance : 1 ^ share in the Anglo-Turkish Commission for the navigation of the Shatt- 2. A German cable to a point in the Persian Gulf. 3. A share in any constructional works in Persia. , , ., r 4. To participate in the navigation of the Xarun from Mohammerah to Ahwaz (m competition with Messrs. Lynch Bros.). r These matters are outside the province of the present report, but they are mentioned as instances of continual efforts by Germany to increase her interests, m antithesis to the absence of efforts by Great Britain to decrease existing German interests. A fifth demand (bv Herr Ballin)— “No through rates to be quoted by the British India Steam Navigation Company or any other company from Europe to Bagdad by water, or if such rates aie quoted, the Hamburg-Amerika line to have the right of quoting on terms as favourable as any other company ” appears even more dangerous m tendency, if accepted by British interests. ' For the first alternative seems to aim at hampering the British India steam Navigation Company, and as to the second, it may be read (and distrusted) m the light of Mr. George Lloyd, M.P.’s remarks in his report of 1907 on British trade m Mesopotamia, Communications (iii) Ocean Transport: “ And here it is necessary to point out that any minimum rate agreement with a German line is likely to be detrimental to the trade_ of the British lines. The system that obtains in Germany for through rates from an inland town in Germany on German State railways to a port or inland town abroad would make it absolutely impossible to ascertain how far a German shipping company is faithful in maintaining the minimum rate.” The remainder of Mr. G. Lloyd^ remarks on this subject are of great importance. In this connection the notes in the “ Board of Trade Journal” of the 26th June, 1913, on “ Freight rates from German inland towns are also of interest and warning :— There are no through tariff quotations from German inland towns to foreign countries, excepting those to the Levant and German East Africa. The present would seem a good time for a visit by a representive of the Board of Trade or the Foreign Office to the Gulf, in order to ascertain on the spot in what directions Government interference might be exercised, the position ^ of British shipping companies improved, or the policy of British firms influenced. This course would be the most welcome to His Majesty’s representatives in the Gulf. Failing this, it is respectfully submitted that the suggestion made in this and previous reports might be experimentally sanctioned, and assisted in execution by Government, faute de mieux. No harm could be done ; and it would be seen by the results whether they produced a diminution of German-borne trade to and from the Gulf. The chief desiderata and points of policy are :— 1. Sugar .—To prevent German steamers obtaining control of the carriage of loaf sugar to the Gulf, and to diminish the amounts shipped by them at present. This would be effected :— (a.) By arranging with the Bucknall Steamship line for a regular monthly call at Antwerp. (6.) By inviting firms in England, now shippers of Belgian loaf sugar to the Persian Gulf, and the London sugar brokers, to insist on the refinery or refinery s agents shipping their consignments in British vessels from Antwerp. Alternatively, if the refinery and refinery’s agents refused, shipment by British steamer to Bombay (for transhipment by British India Steam Navigation Company) or delivery at London (for transhipment to the Gulf). 2. Steps similar the those infl (a)) and (1 (6)) to be taken with Hindu merchants at Bunder Abbas, and British firms in England, as regards other Belgian cargo,. i.e., candles, iron bars, &amp;c.3. To strengthen the position of the home lines vxs-a-vxs the Hamburg line, cmd give them similar strength of backing, either— (a.) By inviting the British India Steam Navigation Company to institute sailings ^vtween the United Kingdom, Antwerp, and the Gulf in close co-operation, and under an understanding with Mr. F. C. Strick and Sir J. Ellerman; or (6.) By getting other lines, Marcus Samuel and Co., Andrew Whir and Co and others to support the Buclmall and Strick lines in opposition to the Hamburg- Amenka. Regular Calls at all Ports. 4. To arrange with Mr. Strick, Sir J. Ellerman, and the British India Company or other line for regular monthly sailings, or oftener, from the United Kingdom and Antwerp to the Gulf—to he by scheduled time as approximately as possible—and these calls to include Bahrein and Lingah regularly. (In the year under review only 1 such steamer called at Bahrein against 11 German, and 4 as against 12 German at Lingah.) Cotton Goods. 5. To secure, with the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government, the renewal of the contracts for Manchester cotton goods with the Strick line or other British lines, to advise firms in Manchester accordingly ; to take action in Manchester to prevent intrigues there by the Hamburg-Amerika Linie. 6. Any firms in Manchester at present not under contract, or who have been shipping cottons via Hamburg to the Gulf, to be invited by the British shipping lines to ship by them. Wood. 7. To get British firms at Basra importing wood for date boxes and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company at Mohammerah to use Indian (Mysore) wood in place of the Swedish and others now carried in German vessels. The Government of India to lend its assistance to the Mysore State to facilitate this, and obtain cheap freights with the British India Steam Navigation Company. Grain. 8. In seasons of export of grain, particularly wheat, from Persian ports (not Basra), the Strick, Bucknall, and other direct lines to be asked to provide regular sailings to the United Kingdom, and reserve a sufficient amount of space for Mohammerah and Bushire cargo ; and, whenever the German firm is underbidding British firms buying wheat and seeds, to reduce freight sufficiently to allow British shippers of wheat to compete. 9. British lighterage company at Bushire and Bunder Abbas. 10. Formation of Persian Gulf sections of the London and Manchester Chambers of Commerce. 11. Government to sanction the purchase by His Majesty’s representatives at the various ports of samples of goods imported by German steamers which seem capable of being produced likewise in Great Britain. (This was last done in 1908.) 12. Importers in Persian and Arab ports of manufactures such as woollen goods, velvets, candles, by German steamers, and from Hamburg and Antwerp, to be approached through His Majesty’s consulates and political agencies for details of prices, samples, &amp;c. These to be sent to the Board of Trade, and the importers to be put in touch with manufacturers and sellers of similar goods in England^ Exporters at the various ports in any way connected with British interests to be urged to ship to the United Kingdom in British vessels only. A great decrease of cargo in the German vessels and a decline in the position of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie would at once result, if the above measures were approved und undertaken in England and the Gulf.

McMahon, G.C V.O., K C.I E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. With reference to the Government of India telegram No. 52-S., of April 10th, my letter No. 1572 of May 18th in reply thereto, and subsequent telegram No. 938 of May 26th, I have the honour to address the Government of India on the subject of the supply to the Gulf of wood for date-boxes, an important article of commence in which India is in direct competition with continental wood and German shipping. I feel sure that the Government of India must be genuinely disturbed at the rapid development of German competition in the Gulf, and more particularly at the determination of the Hamburg-Amerika Line, backed up by the German Government, to extend their operations and German interests still further (as reported by Sir William Ward and communicated to the India Office under Foreign Office letter No. 19826-13 of May 1st). Indeed, the wffiole question of Continental trade competition, however little Indian Trade and the British shipping from India have so far been affected, surely assumes vital importance for the Government of India when the Board of Trade them selves (in their important Memorandum of April 28th) now sum up the position as follows:— “ Wiih the import trade crippled by disorder and the export trade strug gling with the uncommercial competition (whether subsidised or net) of Messrs, Wonckhaus and also impeded by disorder, it will soon be impossible for them to go on (z.e,, traders) with the result that the predominance of British commercial interests in the Gulf will become a thing of the past.” 2. If reference be made to my letter No. 15060! June 11th 1911 to the Foreign Department of the Government of India, and the reply from the Department of Commerce and Industry No. 6071-74 of August 16th 1911, it will be seen that I then asked Government to move the British India Steam Navigation Company to accord for date-box wood the lowest possible freights between the Malabar Coast and Basrah, and that the Government of India in the Department of Commerce at that time considered that any intervention on the part of Government would be impolitic. In consideration, however, of the fact that the export of Indian timber to the Persian Gult is in itself deserving of encouragement and that it might now he made an incidental means of opposition to the progress of German Shipping interests up the Tigris, I venture to hope that Government will reconsider its decision of that date. 3 The import by German vessels in 1912 was 173 122 boxes as against 150,820 in 1911 , and we may expect them to make further attacks on the carrying trade. The value of the wood imported to Basrah was valued in 1911 at ;£ 120,589 for Basrah alone.

(4) Cheaper transport to port of shipment on the Malabar Coast. e I trust that the Government of India will consider that the political interests^latent in the matter will justify their stimulating the manufacturers and shioment of these boxes to the Gulf, and I think this could best be done at pre sent by their impressing on the authorities in Mysore, suggestions Nos. 1 and 3 above and by d.eir enquiring into and taking up the questions of rates of trans port Nos. 2 and 4, with the Shipping and Transport Companies involved, the British India Steam Navigation Company in particular.

From—H. F. Strickland, Esq., To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I fear that I am giving trouble at a very inconvenient time when matters of much larger importance must be fully occupying your attention. Having proceeded however so far in this matter of the cases for the Persian Date Trade I should be very disappointed if it now fell through. I feel that there is not much hope of success without your assistance. Do you think that matters would be forwarded by my coming over to Bushire. Dated the 25th February From—H. F. Strickland Esq., To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. You will I think be interested to know that at last some progress has been made with reference to the supply of cases for the Persian Date Trade. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co., have asked me to send over the 1,000 cases as as a trial lot, and this I am doing.The matter must now stand upon its own merits, and I am very grateful to you for all the trouble which you have taken in this matter; and I hope that Western India will be able to secure the whole of the business. I hope I may continue to look to you for any assistance and support which may be necessary in this connection. Are there any other outlets which you think would be of use for these woods? No. C. 448, dated 22nd December 1912. From—The Commercial Adviser to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— H. F. Strickland, Esq. Since your letter of February 25th, 1912 this Residency and Consulate General has been without news of the experiment in sending 1,000 dates-boxes of Mysore wood to Basrah, which you then notified. I should esteem it a favour if you would inform me of the result of your experiment. So far as can be gathered, three causes at present hinder the supply of a large and valuable amount of wood in the form of date-boxes to the Gulf from Southern India, vis :— {a) Selection of the cheapest and at the same time most suitable wood, and the turning out of boxes as well made as those from Fiume, Galatz and Gothenburg. (i) Exhorbitant steamer rates between Shimogah and Basrah by the British India Steam Navigation Company. (f) The fact that you cannot supply the accessories with the boxes, as is the case with the Norwegian and European shipments. If these difficulties can be lessened, Indian wood should be able to absorb the whole of this special trade. I have recently had the advantage of a conversation with the British ship owner interested in the Gulf, who informs me that accessories can now be made in Great Britain and early supplied separately. Something may perhaps be possi ble as regards much cheaper direct freights. But as regards difficulty {a) it remains with your department to see how they can cater for the market. If the boxes you proposed sending as an experiment failed to please consignees it is probably because you do not know the style of things needed, and the knowledge is only likely to be acquired by a personal visit to Basrah merchants. Dated the 28th December 1912. From— Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co., Basrah, To—The Commercial Adviser, Basrah. Yours of 22nd of December regarding Mysore wood. Although the box-boards for 1,000 cases were ordered from Mr. Strickland at the beginning of this year and we were promised that shipment would be made in April, they have reached us only the other day, which was too late to be of any use this season; in fact the wood is still in the Customs House and so far I have not seen it. I will however take an opportunity of inspecting it shortly and advise you as to its suitability or otherwise. The price however is very high and unless the Government of Mysore can see their way to sell at lower prices I am sure there is not much chance of this wood superseding that which now comes from Norway and Fiume.V. 4 Dated 3rd January 1913. From—H. F. Strickland, Esq., To—The Commercial Adviser, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 0 .- 44 ^°^ 2 8th ultimo and I thank you for all the interest which you now and have always shown in this venture to supply the date boxes from South-West India. I have all along fully realized the great importance of securing for this Government, (or if that be impossible or impracticable from considerations of carriage, etc.), then for some other districts of South-West India a business worth some ^63,000 annually, and which finds an outlet for some 700,000 c.ft. of timber which is worthless for other purposes. I have spent much time and work on it so far and although the first venture will, I am afraid, turn out a loss I propose to press on with the matter. In a country like India the initiation of any new business is attended with many difficulties, not the least of which seems to be the native disregard for punctuality. A sample case which I sent over to Messrs. Gray Mackenzie was well reported on as regards the suitability of the wood and eventually the firm placed an order for 1,000 cases at ^27-10-0 C. I. F. Basrah. As you suppose, the question of carriage by land and sea governs the whole matter, and the only concession which I could obtain was a reduction in steamer freight of Rs. 5 per ton, making the cost of sea freight 8 annas per c. ft. from Mormugao to Basrah, and this was only on the first trial lot of 1,000 cases. As Indian sea freight goes I do not think any further reduction is likely. The railway authorities would make no con cession at all. Consequently I had to face an expenditure of about Rs. 273, (*.£., ^18-4-0 per 1,000 cases from depots in Mysore to Basrah. This added to the cost of bringing the timber into depot made the business impossible for this Gov ernment to take up, and I continued the experiment from Savantvadi State where conditions were more favourable. Planks only were required with no paper or bindings, so that the business was favourable in this respect; but due to one delay and another (all of which should however be avoidable in future) the planks which should have been ship ped in March last were not ready before the South-West Monsoon broke, and con sequently could not be shipped before September. They have been shipped but Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co. will be unable to take them up before next June. The failure of this first venture upon this score of delay in delivery is of no great moment, as the difficulties which led to the delay are surmountable. The expense of hand-sawing is also an important item, and I propose to see if actual expenses can be covered by hand-sawing before going to the expense of putting up a steam plant; as matters were, my arrangements on this point were not satisfactory and hence a further trial is necessary. Taking actual working figures these 700 cases cost me Rs. 358 10-6 C. I. F. Basrah as against a market price of Rs. 288-12-0. I will acquaint you with the result of the further experiment. No. C.-112, dated 14th March 1913. From—The Commercial Adviser, Bushire, To— H. F. Strickland, Esq. I have the honour to acknowledge and to thank you for your letter dated 3rd January, which was of great interest. Your difficulties in securing a lower rate of freight and your inability to secure delivery in time for the autumn season of 1912 are fully understood by this office, and your initial shipment of 700 cases is, under the circumstances, highly satisfactory. The Resident hopes that you will not be discouraged, and will continue to improve methods of delivery andprice of freight. 1 have lately had the advantage of a conversation with one of the partners of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co. here on a visit from Basrah and another partner has sent me copy of their letter to you dated March 8th. I now beg to offer the following comments :— Quality of Wood .—The former gentleman told me that the wood would not stand the summer heat: the sides of the cases, which he had inspected were cracked already. The wood was dirty looking as compared with the clean Norwegian wood, and rough (unplaned, I gathered). The appearance of the packing is of course important to date packers. Perhaps you have other woods of more showy appearance, or less likely to split. Sea Freight. —Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co. are the agents of the British India Steam Navigation Co. Limited, and they tell me that small ship ments (transhipped at Bombay) by the ordinary British India Steam Navigation cargo steamers will never pay. The only method to make wood pay its freight is to charter a special vessel, which of course means a very large quantity of wood.^ I have already spoken to a London shipowner, whose vessels are some times in the Gulf and in the Malabar Coast, about shipments of wood for date boxes from Mysore. He was very interested and I am not without hope that he will ultimately get into touch with you on the subject. Packing. —Messrs. Gray Mackenzie remark that the packing of your con signment was very inferior, and loosely done with cord. They spoke of sending you a sample of the packing of the bundles of Norwegian wood. I believe this is done in bundles of so many tops and bottoms of cases, and so many sides, all tied firmly with wire. I will remind them about a sample. Extent of Consignments. —Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co. have told me verbally, and you in their letter, that when the quantity required of Basrah is over 1} million cases, a consignment of 3,000-4,000 cases, such as you mentioned in your last letters, would be useless for their purpose. Smallness of the con signment also prevents you making a special charter of freight from India. I would therefore ask you whether you do not think it would be worth while, supposing you have the necessary steam plant—possibly two plants would be necessary—to make it your object to go on turning out cases until you had collected between 200,000-300,000 before shipping them. That in Messrs. Gray Mackenzie’s opinion is the lowest quantity likely to prove sufficiently useful to them. You alluded once before in this correspondence to your desire to visit Basrah and see for yourself what the requirements are. I am inclined to think that a few days’ visit to Basrah and Mohammerah at the beginning of the date season would be more useful to you than any correspondence. Should you desire to come up the Gulf this year, we should be pleased to see you here on the way down, though there is no market for date boxes here. Dated 18th March 1913. From—H. F. Strickland, Esq., To--The Commercial Adviser, Bushire. I understand that Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. have informed you that they regard it as useless for me to make any further endeavours to compete against the Norwegian wood for the date boxes, as they state that these Indian woods are unsuitable. Their discouragement is very greatly to be regretted. It was not reason able to believe that success would be attained at the immediate outset, and from the first venture. So far the matter has resulted in a loss on this side, still it is much too early to give so important a business up. As you are aware the starting of any new business in India is attended with exceptional difficulties, but in this case I am still inclined to believe that experience will overcome these. There are, I think, three controlling factors, cheap sawing, cheap transport to Port of Shipment, and the use of ‘ mixed timbers.’•***:*:.. ..... 1 : --* f.v , , ! i, A ! -?':v The first two are within sight, as I can see my way to start sawing by water power with river carriage to the coast. I have also arranged for sufficient funds to put up a considerable sawing plant, provided that our trial ventures indicate success in the future. The third point is more difficult, but it ought not to be insuperable, and it is one which Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. may themselves get over, I mean the use of different wood to what the trade has hitherto been accustomed. South India has no pine wood, and large supplies of any particular variety of white timber are not obtainable. But there is really no good reason why any timber (which is not materially heavier than pine) should not be used. It is purely a matter of custom ; and whilst fully admitting the power of “ custom ” it may not be impossible to get over this point. Very large quantities of different varieties of woods well suited to the purpose are obtainable ; but India is a bad source of supply of large quantities of any particular varieties. Our jungles as you know are mixed. If this difficulty about the variety of wood can be overcome then I think I can see my way to put these cases into your market at a price which would be satisfactory to the importers. But I cannot deal with this point, but I think it would repay the time and energy of any importers of position,^such as Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. It would be a pity to let this matter drop at this stage and it would be a disappointment to me after what I have already done, and on this ground I would ask you to kindly do what you can to get Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. to tackle this point of mixed woods. Taking up another matter I am informed that there is a great demand for bamboos in all the Gulf Ports. I would be much obliged if you would kindly inform me whether this is so, and if so, whom to address at the different ports, as we have large supplies. Dated 8th March 1913. From— Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; co„ To — H. F. Strickland, Esq. We are in receipt of your letter of 4th February, regarding the trial ship ment of wood sent to us some short time back, and referring to our enquiry as to what number of cases you could guarantee for shipment before June and also the price. This enquiry was made previous to the arrival of the wood shipped per S. S. “ Courland, ” Since we have received same we are, however, inclined to think that no business can be done in the quality of wood sent as buyers require white wood similar to Norwegian which is now imported. It is therefore, in our opinion, useless your sending further trial shipments unless you can supply the quality of wood required and also at a price to compete with the same. The shipments of date boxes, for which this wood is required last year exceeded if million cases, and your advice that you would probably deliver 3/4,000 cases is nothing as compared with the requirements of the trade. Mr. Chick of Bushire has been in communication with us and we are now advising him of our views.

I am forwarding a copy informally to the Bombay Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company. — NOTICE. To all to whom these presents may come. After the sale of the Bombay Persia Company’s steamers the work of transporting of merchandise was confined to the English, who having seen no obstacles in their way, began to exercise every sort of highhandedness on the merchants and passengers, increased the passage by 30 per cent, will doubtless increase it hereafter, and, having felt confident that there is no steamer to rival them, they will use every form of highhandedness and pressure, raise a thousand objections, delay merchandise, give no answer for shortages, annoy travellers and forcibly charge freight on the travellers’ baggage, which has never been custom- ary. It is obvious that this matter involves loss and detriment to all the Mussa mans, especially my Persian brethren, and more particularly to the respected merchants. Therefore, I have resolved, at the persistent request of my friends, to form a Shipping Company under the patronage of the exalted British Government and have fixed its capital at 10 lakhs rupees viz., 4,000 shares of Rs. 250 each. As the principal object in forming this Company is to remove foreign highhandedness and conduce ease to my compatriots, I beg to request ad my respected brethren that they may, with a view to furthering the cause of philanthropy and checking foreign aggression favourably consider the expediency of participating in and helping this Company, and may intimate to me to enter their honourable names in the book of the shareholders and contributors of this Islamic Company and that they may also write the amounts of their contributions, and state^ as to how many shares of the Company they wish to buy, so that they may be informed in due course and pay one half of the contribution to the Bank at present, and the other half when the work is commenced. When the shares and the rules of the Company have been printed, the shares will be formally forwarded to every share-holder. They should rest assured that the benefits of this Company are far better and more than all other sorts of trades of to-day and will undoubtedly cause our nation and country to progress. If we reflect with care, it will be seen that the multiplied wealth and the high progress of the Franks have been and are due to the blessings of forming Companies, and we hope that we, the Persians, will also realise the benefits of Company-promoting and attain to high degrees by the providence of God and the enthusiasm of our zealous compatriots through the formation of such Islamic Companies, which are the cause of real union ; we shall thus rise to high degrees and be saved the disgrace of humiliation by foreigners.

I don't Know who wrote it, but I am thankful for the opportunity of getting his views. Needless to say our livelihood depends on our being on friendly terms with our constituents, and this applies from myself as the head of the Company, down to the Agents, and the Captains and officers. The Agents are paid by commission on the Company's earnings and anything they may do to alienate shippers or consignees naturally directly cuts into their incomes. While I am extremely grateful to you for sending me the report, which will enable me without quoting it in any way to send my people abroad a homily, the results of our working in the Persian Gylf do not indicate that we are making leeway, as the following figures will show:- Cross earnings January 1st 1912 to 22 June 1912 Bs. 12,55,666/- * » » 1913 21 ' 1913 17,63,101/- We lately put on four large nevj fast steamers on the Bombay Gulf line, and m have other five building.

Ifhen our present intentions as regards the Bombay Persian Gulf H44 service are completed, as they will he in 12 months time, m shall have spent in three years on new and up to date tonnage for this line, something like £720,000. We are therefore staking a not inconsiderable amount in this trade and if we are to earn a reasonable return on our outlay we shall have to keep on decent terms with our constituents.

EOEEIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. The Most Hon’ble the MARQUESS op CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 3 rd July 1913 , My Lord Marquess, In accordance with the instructions contained in Your Lordship’s telegram of the 7th April 1913, we have the honour to communicate the following observations as to the effect of German competition on Indian trade and shipping and as to the political aspect of the situation described in Mr. Chick’s report on the operations of the Hamburg-America line of steamers in the Persian Gulf for the year ending October 1911. 2. In the first instance, we would remark that, from the purely com mercial standpoint, we can find little indication in Mr. Chick’s report that the trade competition to which he draws attention has, up to the present, had any adverse effect on British Indian trade and shipping. As examples of the directions in which German competition is being felt most acutely, Mr. Chick illustrates the sugar import and grain export trade but in neither of these is India directly concerned although, indirectly, her shipping may suffer to some degree if such competition results in a diminution of consignments of British goods to Indian ports for transhipment to the Gulf. We have subjected the statistics of the import and export trade from India to the Gulf to the most careful examination and, though it is true that there has been some decline in the value of exports of Indian merchandise to the Gulf in the past five years, the decrease can in most instances definitely he ascribed to the general insecurity of the trade routes or to other well ascer tained reasons quite distinct from the sailings of the steamers of the Hamburg- America line, and it would be unsafe to assert on the statistics before us that these sailings have so far had any seriously prejudicial effect. 3. But, though from a purely commercial point of view Indian interests do not appear to be gravely threatened by German competition, in its political aspect the position described by Mr. Chick appears to us to merit serious attention. It is evident that the attempts of German traders to undermine the ascendancy of trade and interests which the British Empire has maintained for so many years in the Persian Gulf have met with no small measure of success. If it were purely commercial enterprise which prompted these manifestations of German activity, there would be no ground for anxiety, but we agree with the views expressed by the Board of Trade that German policy will not bear this interpretation and that it is directed not so much to com mercial profit or loss as to the marking out of political claims. To this policy the prospect of the completion of the Baghdad Railway has no doubt given a fresh impetus. It is not easy to determine the direction in which action can best be taken to safeguard British interests against these political features in German enterprise. A 21 V) V ... ’ - ‘‘V// Certain suggestions on this subject are made in a letter,* which we have recently received from Sir P. Cox, a conv * No. 1572 , dated the 18 th May 1913 . 0 f W hicll W6 enclose for Your Lordship’s information. As regards Nos. (1) and (2) of these suggestions, it appears from their memorandum, dated the 28th April 1913, that the Board of Trade have already taken such action as is possible. The objects at which proposals Nos. (4) and (5) aim will be sufficiently achieved with the conclusion o£ the agreements which are now under consideration between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Porte regarding the Euphrates-Tigris Navigation and the Shatt- el-Arab Biverain Commission. As regards (3), we accept the opinion of the Board of Trade that the grant of subsidies is undesirable and likely to stimulate German traders to fresh activity. In the circumstances we are not prepared to advocate any form of State intervention. 4. Assuming then that no considerable improvement in the situation is likely to be effected by any measures which it is feasible to take on commercial lines, it remains to consider whether any remedy is to be found in political action. We observe that the firms interested in the Gulf trade are confident that the position of British commerce can be maintained if the safety of the trade routes can be secured. This is an object which has long engaged the attention of His Majesty’s Government. It is clear that, so far as the Bushire-Shiraz route is concerned, nothing further can be done until experience has shown whether the gendarmerie force now employed under Swedish officers is or is not capable of re-establishing order. As regards the Bandar Abbas* Kerman route, we trust that the proposal to raise a force of gendarmerie under British officers, which we have supported in our telegram of the 7th June 1913, may be pressed upon the Persian Government. At the same time we desire to record the opinion that the surest guarantee for the permanent restoration of order in Southern Persia and our most efficacious safeguard against German competition in the Gulf and the attempts of Bussia to capture the trade of Central Persia lie in the construction of railways from the Gulf ports into the interior. Some time must necessarily elapse before these projects materialise, but we would express a hope that His Majesty’s Government will endeavour, by all means in their power, to promote at any rate the early construction of the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line. We have the honour to be, My Loed Maequess, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants,No. 1&amp;72, dated Bushire, the 18th (received 26th) May 1 ^Co nfident ial). 1'rom— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to Foreign Department telegram No. 52 S., dated 10th April 1913, in which I was desired to submit any further observa tions which might suggest themselves to me in regard to the effect * Pro. No. 31 in Secret e., March 1913 , Nos. si- which the German competition, dis- s 5 - cussed in my letter* No. 3041, dated 21st November 1912, and enodosures, had had, particularly on Indian trade, and as to the political effect of it generally. I regret that there has been some delay in the submission of my views, hut when the Foreign Department communication was received, I was much burdened with local work, and my Commercial Adviser, whom I was anxious to consult, was absent on tour. 2. I note that my previous communication and enclosures above men tioned did not separately comment upon the effect which German competition was having upon Indian trade and shipping with the Gulf. The fact is that though India is affected both commercially and politically by the competition, it is affected in the first connection rather in its role as a medium for trade in European goods, and in the second connection mainly as a component part of the Imperial whole. Thus, Indian trade with the Persian Gulf consists principally of goods of European origin resold in India or transhipped via Eombay, and this trade is yearly being more and more displaced by direct Gulf shipments from Europe. Figures for all Gulf ports are not immediately available, hut taking Bushire as an example,—it is still the second port of importance in the G- U lf— } imports during March 1912-13 by the three British companies trading between India and the Gulf amounted to 109,826 packages. Of this only the following can be said to be of purely Indian origin:— Rice ... ... 20,269 packages. Tea ... ... ... ••• ... 6,819 „ Spices ... 4,869 „ Other raw foodstuffs ... ... 3,873 Cotton yarns and thread 454 „ Gunnies and twist 803 „ 36,887 3 balance was chiefly composed of— Sugar ... ... 27,071 Continental origin. Piece-goods ... ... 4,454 largely of English weavings. Candles... ... 4,032 partly Continental. Miscellaneous ... ... 35,607 greater part provi sions, haberdashery, hardware, European. Shipments of sugar via India in British bottoms have greatly decreased of late years and, as has been observed in the previous report, there seems every likelihood of German shipping eventually wresting from us the whole of the import of sugar from Europe. Of Indian products proper, indigo has been almost entirely driven out of the market by the competition of the German synthetic dye ; but there is no doubt that where Indian borne trade has been mostly affected has been in the increased extent to which goods are now ordered direct from Europe. For example, in Bandar Abbas, the Hindu and Persian merchants now obtain their loaf sugar, matches, candles and steel beams direct from Germany or Belgium in German vessels. Again, a variety of articles of haberdashery and hardware, seen in most Gulf bazaars, come now direct from the Continent, whereas they used to be imported to the Gulf from India; u e. 9 earthenware, glassware,nails, needles, sewing machines and cloths. Woollens and velvets also are increasingly imported from Germany to the Persian Gulf ; and German cottons and yarns to a lesser degree. 3. But the danger in the present outlook lies not so much in this increase of imports from the Continent as in the powerful position into which the German Shipping Line is working itself at the expense of our shipping, not only that from England, but also that from India. Since the advent of the Hamburg-America Line in 1906 , the whole position of British shipping, both Anglo-Gulf and Indo-Gulf, has undergone a change for the w T orse. At the juncture in question, whilst the Anglo- Algerian, Bucknall and West Hartlepool Lines, in the former category, were forming a combine, and exports from Belgium, especially Belgian sugar, were under their control; in the latter the Bombay-Persia Steam Navigation Company then had a regular service from India as well as the British India Steam Navigation Company. But the German steamship company, as has heen fully set forth in previous reports, at once laid itself out to break up the combine in 1908 , by a policy of intimidation, and, in due course, succeeded in depriving them of the trade with Belgium, and in detaching the West Hartlepool Company from the other British lines. In the past year the last-mentioned line did not land as much as 300 packages at Bushire, while the Bucknall Lines have long since been absorbed by Messrs. Ellerman and the management of such of their vessels as still voyage to the Gulf has been confided by the latter to Messrs. Strick (as the Anglo-Algerian Company). Meanwhile, on the Indian side, the Bombay-Persia Steam Navigation Company having, as the result of native management, allowed their steamers to go to ruin, and lost the confidence of the public, have become a negligible factor in the shipping returns of the Gulf, and their steamers are now seldom seen. The Arab Steamers Limited— a new creation without any substantial backing, which made somewhat of a splash at first—now only dabbles with the trade as far as the Persian ports are concerned. There remains the British India Steam Navigation Company and even with them the position is by no means satisfactory, powerful though the company undoubtedly is; for the German line has succeeded in obtaining a considerable slice of their operations in sugar, and, on the other hand, not only Arab and Persian but also British firms are most dissatisfied with the treatment received from the company and its agents. Native merchants are, of course, obliged to use the line at present, because to-day it provides the sole, regular and reliable means of shipping to and from India ; but were any other strong shipping organisation to run steamers in opposition to the British India Steam Navigation Company, between India and the Gulf, the British India Steam Navigation Company would be forsaken by all except ! those under unexpired contracts to ship by their vessels. Meanwhile, the Hamburg-America Line has succeeded in achieving a very strong position, and now that the Baghdad Railway is within measurable distance ot completion, we must not be surprised at any time to see a German Steamship Company, or a combine, embarking on a German service between Indian ports and the Gulf. They are already seen to be exerting themselves to obtain control of the carrying trade up the Tigris. 4 . Turning now to the political aspect of the competition, this Residency has been more or less the vox clamantis on the subject for the past four years, and it is diihcult to say much now that has not already been said before. It seems to me that, so lar, each element concerned has continued to deal with the problem on the watertigl\t compartment principle; each has recognised that the position is unsatisfactory, but dismissed the subject with the comforting thought that there is nothing particular which it can itself do to ameliorate it; that the remedy is up to somebody else.I submit that we knew all along that the Germans had come to the Gulf to create commercial interests of their own for political motives, and that their trading, shipping and political elements were working in cohesion to that end. So far we have made no attempt to offer any solid opposition or organise any constructive policy to counteract it, and by neglecting to do so we have continued to make leeway. It is for us to consider whether the position is worth fighting for or not; in any case there are surely no points in letting it go by default. 5 . The present juncture is a most critical one. We see the preliminary understanding for the construction of the Baghdad-Basrah section assuming definite shape and the German element in the meanwhile doing its utmost to get a predominant position in the control of the river traffic and lightering of cargo. Then we have the Mohammerah-Khoremabad route in prospect, and here, unless special measures are devised, we seem likely to create a wheat export for the benefit of Messrs. Wonckhaus. I can only suggest, as I have done before, that His Majesty’s Government should call an expert committee among those officially and commercially interested and endeavour to arrive at some definite decision as to what is needed and a constructive programme for carrying it out. 6 . I venture to make the following suggestions as to the direction in which action seems necessary and possible at the present juncture :— (i) That a definite understanding should be sought amongst all British lines with a view to combating German competition. (ii) That an organised attempt should be made to prevent the sugar trade from falling irrevocably into German hands and that the British lines should be encouraged to call at Antwerp. (in) That some form of State help should be devised calculated to counteract rebates, on exports, held to be enjoyed by the German firm when shipping by German vessels. (i v ) That a British lighterage company to undertake the loading of ships at Basrah, Mohammerah and at the Bar, should be formed. (g?) That a means should be sought of converting Messrs. Lynch’s con cession on the Tigris into a British Company in which Gulf firms should be encouraged to participate.1913 . SIMLA. FOEEIGMsT DEEA.RTMEKTT. SECRET. External.

Sir, Foreign Office, Jidy 4, 1913. 1 AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to refer to correspondence relating to landing rights for cables in British and French possessions in the East, ending with the letter from this Office of the 18th February last. The Marquess of Crewe is aware that so long ago as 1908 a report reached Sir E. Grey that a scheme was in contemplation for the construction, with German capital, of a telegraph cable connecting Pulo Wey, in the north of Sumatra, with Basra, by way of Goa. This cable, it was stated, was to be joined by means of a line passing along Sumatra and Java, and thence by sea to Menado, in the north of Celebes, with the already existing German cable which connects the last-named place with Chefu by way of Jap Island, Shanghai, and Tsingtau. It was thought probable that the scheme would include the construction of a branch line to Bahrein, the centre of the pearl shell industry, which has now passed almost entirely into German hands, and it appeared clear that the landing of such a cable at Basra, after passing through the Persian Gulf, would give to the German Government a claim to make their voice heard in the settlement of questions affecting that region. ' Sir E. Grey at once ascertained from the Portuguese and Turkish Governments that they had not granted and had no intention to grant to the German Government any concessions for the landing of cables at any points within their territory. He then proceeded to ask the Portuguese and French Governments to grant to His Majesty’s Government exclusive rights to land cables and to set up wireless telegraph installations in their respective Indian possessions. The reply of the Portuguese Government, of which official note was taken at the time, was satisfactory, while the French Government, after a long delay and several reminders through His Majesty’s Embassy at Paris, finally consented to consider the matter as part of a negotiation in progress at the time for the settlement of a number of questions at issue between the two Powers, demanding, in exchange for the rights asked for by His Majesty’s Government, the transfer to themselves from the Eastern Telegraph Company the right to land at Perim a cable to Obokh which they had taken over by arrangement with that company. These negotiations came to an end in 1909 without any agreement having been reached, and the question was allowed to rest till, in the course of last year, the French Government once more applied for the right to land their cable at Perim. His Majesty’s Government declined to accede to this application unless the French Government in return were prepared to renew the offer which they had made in 1909 to grant His Majesty’s Government exclusive rights to land cables and to erect radio telegraphic apparatus in the French possessions in India. ' After considerable delay, the French Government, in January last, agreed to this demand in so far as it concerned landing rights, but as regards wireless telegraph refused to go further than to pledge themselves to grant to no other foreign Power permission to erect such apparatus in French India. This offer appeared to Sir E. Grey to be adequate, and the Postmaster-General shared this view, but the Marquess of Crewe proposed that, before ceding to France the landing rights at Perim, His Majesty’s Government should obtain from them the right to exercise a censorship on cables and wireless stations in 1 rench India in time of war. Sir E. Grey was disposed to think that such a demand was inadvisable for several reasons, and notably because it would be a breach of neutrality on the part of Trance to allow Great Britain to establish such a censorship in a war in which France was not engaged. [2985 d — 8 ]2 The Marquess of Crewe has suggested a reference of this point to the Law Officers of the Crown, and the question whether this step should be taken is still under discussion. Such being the present position, the German Ambassador has handed to Sir E. Grey a memorandum, copy of which is enclosed,* expressing thefwish of hie Government to establish direct telegraphic communication between Germany, German East Africa, and China, by means of a land line across Turkey and a cable which should be linked to it at some point on the shores of the Persian Gulf. The Germed Government ask for a declaration from His Majesty’s Government that they will not oppose in principle the landing of a cable at such a point, and for a confidential intimation whether they would prefer that the cable should be landed in Turkish or in Persian territory. Sir E. Grey is adffised that Germany has no great commercial need for a cable such as that described, and he is accordingly led to the conclusion that the object of their request is political. Sir E. Grey is consulting the Departments concerned, and he presumes that the objections entertained in 1909 to this scheme still hold good, but he would be glad to have the considered views of Lord Crewe, and in the event of his thinking it desirable in British interests to oppose the project, he would be glad of any suggestions which his Lordship could make as to the reply that should be returned to the German Ambassador. Sir E. Grey has in the meanwhile addressed a despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople, instructing him to ascertain, if possible, whether the German Government have obtained a concession for the landing of a cable in the Persian Gulf since the date of Sir G. Lowther’s report, in September 1908, that they had not then done so. I am to add that a similar letter has been addressed to the Admiralty, Director of Military Operations, Committee of Imperial Defence, and Post Office. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.

Memorandum. IN a despatch dated the 21 st November, 1912, Sir P. Cox, His Majesty’s Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, reverts to the problem of German competition with British trade and shipping there, and asks for “ lively consideration ” of the suggestions for action put forward by Mr. H. G. Chick in his report on the activities of the Hamburg— America Line during the period October 191 0 -September 1911. In further despatches of the 24th December, 1912, and the 12 th February, 1913, the attention of His Majesty’s Government is invited to the questions of ( 1 ) a lighterage service at Gulf ports and ( 2 ) the sugar trade. In consequence of these despatches the Board of Trade have consulted a number of firms interested in the Gulf trade, and the present memorandum summarises the information obtained :— 1 . Shipping .—The various Gulf ports are served by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Anglo-Algerian Line, and Bucknall Line—which are jointly managed by Mr. F. C. Strick—the West Hartlepool Line, the Bombay and Persia Line, the Arab Steamship Line, the Ham burg-America Line. Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. run a number of boats in the Gulf, but this seems to be mainly for their own purposes, and the same is true of boats run recently by Messrs. Marcus Samuel and Co. at Basra. As far as regards direct trade from and to Europe, it is carried between the Gulf and the United Kingdom mainly by the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall Lines, and between the Gulf and the continent of Europe by the Hamburg-America Line, 'the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall Lines go to Marseilles, but not to Antwerp or Hamburg; the Hamburg-America Line boats do not come to Englancf The West Hartlepool Line service has been relatively unimportant; the boats have gone to Antwerp, but the Board are now informed by Mr. Strick that the West Hartlepool Line has withdrawn from the Gulf trade, and that its berth, &amp;c. , at Antwerp has been acquired by Sir dohn Ellermanfor the Bucknall Line, which proposes to send a boat there occasionally (partly with a view to maintaining the right of British boats in the Gulf trade to do so). The [2884 fff —3] B2 i ■(! '.f f' r l*. if Hamburg-America Line have been informed of the change, and a friendly acknowledg ment has been received from Herr Ballin. As regards outward service from the United Kingdom, Mr. Strick has mack^ contracts which do not terminate until next year, and which cover practicailv the whof of the Manchester exports, the most important branch of the United Kingdom export trade to Persia. From enquiries made at Manchester it appears that the Hamburo-- America Line did try to get in some time ago, but failed owing to the fact jiTst mentioned; they will probably try again when the question of the renewal of the contracts comes up for consideration, but it is not thought that they will be successful though there is some little dissatisfaction among British shippers owing to— (1.) Irregularity of sailings of the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall boats; and (2.) Recent increase of insurance rates, because of some of the ports called at (Red Sea ports) and the fact that some of the boats (especially Anglo-Algerian boats) are said to be “not well found.” Mr. Strick has informed the Board of Trade that the Manchester shippers are claiming that the Anglo-Algerian Line should hear part of the increased insurance charges, and that he is prepared to do so if the period of the contracts be extended. He is about to open negotiations to that end. Sugar exported from the continent to the Gulf is carried from Antwerp by the Hamburg-America Line boats, and from Marseilles bv the Anglo-Algerian boats. The former exports are from Belgian refineries, the latter from French refineries. Mr. Strick has for the latter a contract wdiich lasts for another four years. Much of the continental sugar is shipped to the Gulf on account of British firms, and it is suggested (Sir P Cox’s despatch of the 12th February, 1913) that these firms should be asked to insist that this sugar should be shipped only in British vessels, and (a necessary corollary) that British lines should be induced to go to Antwerp for this purpose, and that Mr. btnck should make every effort to keep the Marseilles contract. As regards Antwerp, Mr. Strick’s view is that any attempt (even should it be practicable) to get e Belgian sugar contracts away from the Hamburg-America Line would mean a shipping war, which is quite unnecessary. As regards Marseilles, his contracts, which he states are not very remunerative, are secure for four years, and he doubts greatly it in any event the Hamburg-America Line would want to go to that port, since the tiade is insufficient to make it worth their while. Sugar from the United Kingdom is, and will continue to be, carried by British lines. The homeward service from the Gulf involves a number of problems, which can be more conveniently dealt with m connection with the grain trade, i u* Sugar Trade. •Some of the facts in connection with the sugar trade have t0Uched u P on above The suggestions there discussed are directed towards securing the carrying trade for British vessels and depriving the Hamburg-America ^ . im P ortant part of its outward freight; the other suggestion, made by Sir P.

Wonckhaus secure all space on the Hamburg-American Line boats, »3 ■ WIII...UPM and ( 2 ) the British lines will not go to Hamburg. If this be the case, then, ® ven ^ freights by the Hamburg—America Line to Hamburg were the same as those by Butis lines to the United Kingdom, it would still be possible for Messrs. Wonckhaus to overbid British firms in the Gulf. It is, however, asserted by British mms that t us explanation is inadequate, and that Messrs. Wonckhaus are assisted oy ( 1 ) low freights on the Hamburg-America Line boats, and/or ( 2 ) a customs rebate in Germany. On neither of these points is there any evidence ; as regards (1), British firms say that L I ie y cannot get quotations from the Hamburg-America Line, since all the space is reserved, and generally taken up by Messrs. Wbnckhaus; and, as regards ( 2 ), it is in the natme of things improvable. The Board are informed that Messrs. Wonckhaus s business is conducted in a manner which suggests that it is not regulated by commercial principles; that they have held large stocks, and declined to sell even when prices were abnormally high; and that some years ago, in one instance at least, they were overbidding British firms in Persia and underselling in Europe. Whatever the precise nature of the grain operations of Messrs. Wonckhaus may be, the trade has become very difficult for British firms. The Basra Trading Company, who ha ve been established for many years at Basra, have recently had to cease operations there owing to their inability to cope with Messrs. Wonkhaus s competition ; and a Manchester firm was disposed recently to abandon their operations at Bushire for the same reason, though they finally decided to endeavour to continue for awhile. It should be noted that Mr. Strick does not subscribe to the view that curient difficulties are due to over-bidding. He holds that the high prices demanded by grain speculators in the Gulf are the real trouble, and states that not only he himself has suspended buying for the present, but that Messrs. W onckhaus have done the same, as they have been badly hit. The prices demanded have made profitable operations impossible. It may of course be that Messrs. Wbnckhaus have been in receipt of such terms in respect of freight by Hamburg—America Line boats as have enabled them to go further than British firms towards paying the high prices demanded by native speculators. The only suggestion put forward in any quarter as to ways of meeting the competi tion which some British firms allege is that made by Mr. Chick, viz., that steps should be taken to obtain substantial reductions of homeward freights on British vessels (&lt;&gt;f the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall Lines). Some difficulty is doubtless caused to British exporters from the Gulf by the fact that Mr. Strick, who controls the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall Lines, is himself an exporter of grain and other Gulf products, and that he retains, therefore, first claim on the space on his boats, and is in other ways not always disposed to have sufficient regard for the needs of other firms ; ana there is some evidence of* dissatisfaction in this connection. The Board have, in fact, been told that, owing to the freights charged and the indisposition of Mr. Strick to meet requirements, and also owing to the reservation of space of the Hamburg-America Line boats, it is becoming almost impossible for British firms to continue in the trade unless they are also ship-owners and can call up their own boats as required, or are in close relations with shipping lines,as only way to obtain substantial reductions of freight on the Briti^Hbo^^^^Nil^|^M|p». to be the grant of a subsidy ; but it would have to be a considerable bn^^lMSpjppH&amp;mburg^^merica Line may be prepared to cut rates (for Messrs. Wonkhaus) t«* &lt;ihy- J -extent, especially as, if the shipments of railway material to Basra necessitate—fis they probably will—more frequent outward sailings by Hamburg—America Line boats, they will be even more anxious than at present to secure homeward cargo. 4 . Lighterage .—Sir P. Cox’s despatch of the 24th December renews the suggestion that an efficient lighterage service should be established at Bushire by a British company, and proposes that the service should be extended at least to Basra and Bunder Abbas. As far as Basra is concerned, it would appear from Mr. Consul Crow’s despatch No. 2 , Commercial, of the 22 nd February, that there is no special need—if, indeed, there is any at all—for such a scheme there, and that the dredging of the bar would be more useful. The operations of the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Navigation Commission, if established, would presumably modify the situation at Basra considerably. In the case of Bunder Abbas the Board have no evidence that suggests that the lack of such a service as is suggested is keenly felt. As regards Bushire itself, the obstacles of existing vested interests, and the probability that native merchants would support their countrymen, though probably not insuperable, would present considerable difficulties; and from the opinions expressed bv British mercantile firms it is apparent that they regard it as a matter for the ship-owners, are indisposed themselves to come into a company for the purpose, and are very doubtful if, on the whole, it would be [2884/—3] B 2 &gt;| remunerative. Whilst admitting that it would be a convenience, they do not seem inclined to regard the present lighterage conditions as particularly adverse. Mr. Striek however, states that he is perfectly willing to co-operate with the British India for a service at Bushire ; he understands that the matter has been under the consideration of Lord Inch cape, and will communicate with him. 5. Position of Mr. Strick. —It is urged by Sir Strick should be approached again by His Majesty’s Government, and it is assumed that he is not fully aware of the position. It is, however, clear that this is not the case. Mr. Strick is fully aware of the possibility of Hamburg-America Line competition for the Manchester contracts, but, as already stated, there are good reasons for believing that that competition would not be successful. As regards Marseilles, again, he anticipates no danger. Mr. Strick has informed the Board that, whilst he thinks it inadvisable to enter into a conflict with the Hamburg-America Line by endeavouring to secure the Belgian sugar contracts, he is prepared to fight that line should it encroach ), in any way on the sphere of operations of the British lines. It is evident that Mr. Strick regards his position as a strong one, owing (it would seem) in part to his contracts, in part to his connection with Sir J. Ellerman, and in part to his close business relations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 6 . The Possibility of a Subsidy. —There are, moreover, very considerable difficulties in the way of a subsidy. The grant of subsidies for purely commercial purposes forms no part of the policy of His Majesty’s Government. Further, when the question of subvention for postal services (which would have been helpful to the British lines trading directly between Europe and Gulf ports in resisting the pressure of the Hamburg- America Line for a rates agreement) was considered a few years ago, it was decided that no case could be made out for a grant of more than a very limited amount, which would have been of no practical use. It has also to be remembered that ship-owners trading with the Gulf are presumably conducting profitable undertakings, and do not need Government help to enable them to keep up their operations ; while, so far as the import trade is concerned, assistance of this kind is not required by British firms trading with Persia. On the other hand, and taking the purely commercial point of view, the exports from Persia are not of sufficient importance to justify the consideration of a grant, and even if they were, any such grant would inaugurate a new form of assistance to trade which it would be difficult to refuse to extend in other directions. A subsidy could not be defended at the present time on purely commercial grounds ; it could be defended only as a means of maintaining, for reasons predominantly political, British films engaged in a particular trade. Such a subsidy, and the reasons for it, could not be kept secret, and the fact of its existence would make public to the world our apprehensions as to German progress in the Gulf, call forth from Germany denials of anything uncommercial in the action of Messrs. Wonckaus and the Ham burg-Am erica Line, stimulate the latter to fresh activity, and give further impetus to German political effort. vA P. Cox and Mr. Chick that Mr. F. Q 7. General Trade Conditions.—The British firms who have been consulted by the Board of Irade were unanimous m believing that the competition of Messrs. Wonckaus is not of a commercial character, and that its primary object is political rather than commercial. It m mainly competition in the export trade from Persia, and its adverse influence has been felt most severely by firms which, like the Basra Trading Company, are, or have been, engaged principally in the barley export trade, though it is under produce 6 th6 Same meth ° ds have been ado P ted in respect of some other lines of The difficulties of firms exporting these other products, and of firms importing goo s in o ^ ersia, arise c lefly from the lack of security in Persia generally, and on the * ( ] U ,i ers ^ an ia e ro utes especially.

All the firms concerned are agreed that if they are assured of a reasonable amount of security they can maintain their trade and meet Russian and German competition—as regards the latter, at least in the import trade ; but unless His Majesty s Government take strong action to secure order in South Persia without delay, traders are convinced that, with the import trade crippled by disorder and the export trade struggling with the uncommercial competition (whether subsidised or not) of Messrs. Wonckhaus, and also impeded by disorder, it will soon be impossible for them to go on, with the result that the predominance of British commercial interests in the Gulf will become a thing of the past. Unless and until order is secured in Southern Persia none of the proposals that have been put forward could be of any very appreciable utility. jV Minute Paper. put away with % Secret Department.

Sir William Ward thought, to having an established position in the Gulf when, as a probable result of the Balkan War, Germany and Great Britain will have to come to some sort of a final understanding with regard to the Persian Gulf, Bagdad Railway, Tigris Navigation and kindred questions.

Information supplied therein fully corroborates forecast made in my letter No. 14 of 24th December, and justifies the apprehension that, if no specific measures be taken in time to prevent it, river lighterage and transport from bar to Bagdad—in fact, conveyance of all British goods to Western Persia—will be before long in German hands! . 1 venture, therefore, to press urgently promotion of British combine for ultimately taking over transport on the upper river at the end, and also formation of British lighterage company for Basra and the Gulf ports. It is clear that we cannot ignore probability of German element ultimately acquiring Messrs. Lynch s interests. In order to defeat this I venture to urge that we should endeavour to create a British combine based on or substituted for British interest in present company, in order to maintain and extend transport on river under British control. Our long-standing and existing concessionary rights give us a much stronger claim than their temporary concession gives the Germans. As regards lighterage company, I can only again urge expediency of getting companies to meet and devise some effective scheme.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 8 .) (No. 177.) Sir, Constantinople, March 2, 1913. WITH reference to my telegram No. 119 of to-day’s date, I have the honour to furnish you with the following further details on the subject of the Bagdad Railway Company’s suggestion for the formation of a permanent river transport company in which Messrs. Lynch, the Ottoman Nahrie Company, and the Bagdad Railway would participate on equal terms. It appears that the company formed in Belgium (see Mr. Marling’s despatch No. 675 of the 8 th August last) by agreement between Messrs. Lynch and the railway company has proved inadequate for the work of carrying up the machinery and materiel during the period of construction of the railway, which is consequently threatened with serious delay. The German company, however, is unwilling to provide the capital for the purchase of additional steamers which would be left idle on their hands at the end of three years or must be sold at a serious loss to the Turkish company. Messrs. Lynch cannot take them, as their fleet on the river is limited to three working vessels. To remedy this state of affairs, and also in order to obtain a permanent interest in the river-borne trade, which is of importance to them as a feeder to the railway, the German company have approached the Turkish Minister of Finance with an outline of the scheme, and have also submitted it to Messrs. Lynch, who, Sir R. Crawford understands, have given it a not unfavourable reception. The Turkish Ministry of Finance has made no definite rejdy, and will certainly, before doing so, consult Sir R. Crawford. I am not aware of the precise nature of the proposal made by Herr Gunther to Messrs. Lynch, but presumably as a commercial proposition they offer substantial attractions. Still, I venture to suggest that it might be to their advantage to refrain from any binding engagements until some settlement of the Bagdad Railway and Persian Gulf questions has been reached, which might place them in a position to increase the number of their vessels on the Tigris, and would thus enable them to obtain better terms in negotiating the formation of the new company. It does not appear that Messrs. Lynch’s interests would suffer by a certain delay, as the life of the company formed in Belgium has still some three years to run. Herr Gunther’s proposal of course involves the disappearance from the river of the flag and of a distinctive British concern, a result which may be expected to recommend the scheme to the Ottoman Government. I think also that we must be prepared for the possibility, and indeed the probability, that the German company will eventually acquire Messrs. Lynch’s interests in the projected company.

Report on the Trade of Basra for the Year 1911 By Me. Consul Crow. I General remarks .—Many adverse circumstances attended the commercial year under review, the most remarkable of which were the severe outbreak of cholera, several financial failures due to the closeness of the money market and restricted credit resulting there from, tribal disturbances on the Euphrates and the war between Italy and Turkey. Nevertheless the trade of Basra has been con stantly in the ascendant and shows large and important developments. Any restrictions due to the unfortunate events which occurred were largely neutralised, if not altogether outweighed, by the beneficent effects of an abundant harvest, leading to important transactions in grain by which all who approached this article profited to a large extent. The rainfall of 1910-11 was abundant and lasted throughout the winter season, resulting in excellent crops. Floods occurred before and after the harvest and caused considerable loss in some districts, but the crops generally were very satisfactory, and those of barley and paddy surpassed all records. From May onwards large quantities of barley were shipped and grain arrived freely. Owing to a short paddy crop in Burmah there was great demand for Mesopotamian paddy in Europe, and large quantities were shipped during the last few months of the year. Dari and millet proved disappointing in consequence of the rapid fall of the river. A good crop of dari seed was anticipated but the quantity fell short and shipments were on a small scale. Owing to a scarcity of food-stuffs in Europe, prices ruled high throughout the year, and farmers must have reaped large profits. The first arrivals of grain from up-river were clean but, as the year advanced, the margin of profit expected disappeared owing to the unusually large admixture of dirt and consequent loss in weight on cleaning and winnowing. The only effective remedy for this abuse would seem to be the exercise of close supervision by the Government at the places of shipment up-river, where dirt is wilfully mixed with the grain. If a systematic official control were established both up-river and on arrival at Basra, and raftiehs or passes refused for grain containing an abnormal percentage of dirt, or penalties imposed, some improvement might be (638)BASKA. possible The question is a delicate one for buyers to deal with unaLd as, with freight engagements and sales to fulfil, they are not to a position to decline delivery of gram, however dirty, when tendered in fulfilment of contracts made locally. , , The best markets for barley, paddy and millet are found ^ the Continent and large shipments were made to Antwerp and Hamourg dmin- the latter part of the year. Tribal disturbances continued to occur on the Euphrates, but their adverse effect on the gram markef was largely neutralised by the abundant harvest. The date crop was generally less than that of the previous year. Hallawees and Khadrawees fell short, but Sayers showed a fair increase. The fruit was very late in ripening. Prices opened higher than m 1910 but were less stable. Owing to the presence of cholera through- out the summer, great difficulties were experienced in finding packers. The departure of London steamers was even postponed in order to enable shippers to fulfil their engagements. Packers from up-country, on whom the industry mainly depends, refused to attend the packing sheds until the epidemic was virtually over A severe and prolonged epidemic of cholera visited Basra m the summer of 1911 and claimed many victims, both native and European. No reliable statistics are available, but there is little doubt that in the town of Basra and outlying districts several thousands of persons succumbed. _ ^ Harvest prospects .— The outlook for 1912 is doubtful, ihe crops appeared promising at the end of the year and the area under culti vation is larger than before, but, by the middle of March, 1912, owing to a prolonged absence of rain, the fields were severely parched and crops beginning to turn yellow. Timely rains fell, hou ever, towards the end of March and, if not too late, much of the damage anticipated may have been averted. The rainfall in Basra during the year ended December 31, 1911, was 11’Ol inches compared with 11-58 inches in 1910, and that for the six months ended March 31, 1912, was 9'26 inches compared with 9-21 inches during the same period in the preceding year. Exports .—The value of exports increased 857,223?. or over 51 per cent, as compared with the previous year. This increase w-as chiefly due to the large quantities of grain exported consequent on the good harvest. Dates, galls, ghee and gum also increased considerably. The export of other articles such as carpets, mohair, skins, horses, liquorice, opium and wool slightly declined. Cereals .—The total quantity of grain exported was 148,796 tons, valued at 1,198,119?., as compared with 64,317 tons, valued at 457,477?. in 1910, showing an increase in quantity of 84,479 tons and in value of 740,642?., or nearly 162 per cent.

It is therefore difficult to vouch for or test the accuracy of the statistics furnished, and information from various sources leads me to believe that the quantities given, especially in the grain trade, are rather under than over the mark. The Imperial Ottoman Bank estimates the grain trade during the financial year 1911-12 ended in March last at 300,000 tons, divided up as follows :— Exports to— Tons. Europe, to December 31, 1911 ... ... 200,000 Jeddah, to December 31, 1911 ... ... 20,000 Stocks on hand, December 31, 1911 ... 30,000 Grain en route, December 31, 1911 ... 50,000 Total 300,000 The bank publishes the following explanatory table and observa tions :— Crop.

The price paid by exporters for the purchase of this grain is estimated by the Imperial Ottoman Bank to be 1,200,000L.T., of which 30 per cent, or 350,000L.T. accrued to the Turkish Government as representing the sum collected in tithes. The cost of transport,BASRA. storing, manipulation and shipment abroad is estimated at 150,000L.T., thus benefiting to this extent the labour market, river shipping lines and wharf owners. Importers’ profits are estimated approximately at 50,000L.T. The net profit accruing to the agriculturists is there fore 650,000L.T., a comparatively large sum in view of their re£ ir e - ments. The cost of freight of the grain abroad pocketed by the shipping companies is represented by the same authority as 300,00OL.T., and the profits accruing to export houses are estimated at 120,000L.T.|f 2)^.—The export of dates was 66,169 tons, valued at 457,7952., as compared with 61,780 tons, valued at 423,233/., in 1910, showing an increase of 4,389 tons in quantity and of 34,562/. in value or about 8 per cent. The average market price of dates exported at Basra was 6/. 18s. id. per ton. Prices were higher for H alia wees and Khadrawees and somewhat lower for Sayers than in 1910, being fixed at the annual meeting of merchants and growers in September at 390 shamis (22/. 15s.), 290 ,shamis (16/. 18s. Ad.) and 190 shamis (11/. Is. M.) for Hallawees, Khadrawees and Sayers respectively per kara of dates of 40 maunds. The shami is equivalent to Is. 2&lt;Z. and the kara of dates to 54| cwts. The purchase price of Hallawees, Khadrawees and Sayers was therefore at the outset 8s. Ad., 6s. 2d. and 4s. Id. respectively per cwt. But none of these prices were maintained throughout the season. Khadrawees in particular were difficult to procure in large quantities at the price mentioned owdng to the demand for early shipment to Australia. Prices, how r ever, fell both for Hallawees and Khadrawees after the departure of the Australian and American steamers. The crop is estimated as considerably less than that of the previous year. A few’ shipments to London via Bombay prior to the departure of the direct steamers, which arrived in time for the Christmas trade, gave good results, but direct sBipments and forward sales of dates in particular must have resulted in heavy losses. A few parcels of dates held over in London till the New Year were sold at good prices. Freight for dates by the direct London lines was fixed at 1/. 12s. M. per ton as compared with 1/. 7s. §d. in the previous year. Two steamers, one German and one British, were loaded direct for Australia, and the usual three steamers left for the United States of America. Shipments to the Levant and Mediterranean ports showed a consider able increase as compared with those of the previous year. This is due to the favourable prices offered in those markets compared with London prices during the season. Imports .—The estimated value of imports to Basra in 1911, in cluding goods in transit to Bagdad and Persia, was 2,855,677/. compared with 2,634,596/. in the previous year, showing an increase of 8| per cent. Candles .—These increased by 1,193 cases. China and glass .—These articles show an increase of 2,549 cases and in value 6,372/. Piece-goods .—There was an increase of 676 packages of cottons and in value 23,660/., chiefly Manchester goods. Silks increased by 83 cases and by 4,150/. in value, and woollens bv 734 cases and 29,360/. in value.BASRA. 9 Coffee. This article increased by 740 bags and 17,777/. in value There was a steady rise in price from 3/. 3s. per cwt. c.i.f. in January to U. in October. The price declined to 3/. 15s. in December. Petroleum. The quantity imported was 58,330 cases less'in 1911 she ing a decrease in value of 13,331/. The demand for American oil steadily increased. Two steamers arrived from America during the year. No Austro-Hungarian oil was imported and only 30 000 cases of Russian oil. Iron and steel and machinery .—The number of pieces imported shows an increase of 34,442 and in value 14,754/.; 2,323 cases more machinery were imported in 1911, showing an increase in value of 11,836/. Sugar. Crushed sugar shows a decrease of 34,173 bags and in value of 54,670/., and loaf sugar an increase of 79,894 bags and cases and in value 139,814/. Belgian loaves continue in favour in preference to St. Louis. Prices rose steadily from 18s. per cwt. c.i.f. in Januarv to 19s. in April, followed by a decline; to 17s. The price rose later in September to 1/. 4s. Qd. and remained at that figure till the end of the year, when a drop of 2s. occurred. For St. Louis sugar prices varied from 46 fr. 25 c. in January to 52 fr. in August, and remained at that figure till September. For both Britannia and E.H.P. crystals prices fluctuated during the year from 13s. 6&lt;Z. in January to 1/. 4s. in October. At the end of the year prices declined to 1/. 0s. 3&lt;Z. Date-hox wood—The number of boxes imported remained about the same, 267,975 boxes as against 274,964 boxes in the previous year. Boxes are imported in pieces and put together, nailed and iron bound locally. Inside measurements are 17 by 10 by 8f inches ; thickness, tops and bottoms, ^ inch ; sides, ^ inch ; ends, ^ inch. The present price is 32/. per 1,000 c.i.f. Basra. The cost of nailing boxes in Basra is 11s. 8d. per 1,000. United States trade .—The value of exports to the United States of America was 134,338/. as compared with 161,593/. in 1910. The table below shows the relative value of exports to the United States during the past three years. There were no direct imports from the United States :— Articles. 1909. 1910. 1911. £ £ £ Alfalfa seeds 565 596 316 Carpets 23 Dates ... 75,596 110,507 106,610 Dog manure ... 1,308 570 Liquorice root 30,978 43,676 25,132 Millet seed 2,995 6,220 2,330 Sundries ... 24 ...

The quantity of grain exported was 24,048 tons larg R«!sS»'trade—The number of Russian steamers of the Odessa Steam Navigation Company was five in 1911, with an aggregate tonnage The estimated value of goods imported in these steamers was 60,199;. as compared with 61,584;. in the previous year The goods imported consisted chiefly of 3,624 cubic metres of wood from Odessa 30 000 cases petroleum as against 73,000 cases in 1910, 1,932 bags of Russian sugai, 219 cases of military clothing and 185 cases of ammum- tion for the Turkish Government from Constantinople. Other imports of Enssian origin were glass, porcelain and cement. The estimated value of exports m the same vessels was 113,368/. as compared with 78,920/. in the previous year, an increase of 43 per cent. The exports consisted chiefly of 6,236 tons of dates, 13, &lt; 97 cases of clarified butter, 599 tons of rice, 1,557 bales of skins and hides and New steamship lines.—In the beginning of the year certain influential Arabs trading in Bombay and the Persian Gulf formed the Arab Steamship Company, under the British flag, with a capital of 66,666/. Up to date there are no signs that the new company will materially aflect the old-established trading lines between Bombay and the Gulf. So far they have purchased four steamers. _ . Freights. Rates to the United Kingdom by direct steamers—Ur am rates to the United Kingdom ruled from 17s. in January to 1/. in September. In November rates were again increased to 1/. 2s. lor o-eneral cargo to London rates remained at 1/. 2s. from January till November, when they rose to 1/. 4s. 6d. Bates to Bombay varied from 5 to 10 rs. until the latter part of the year, when cargo was plentiful. Bates were then advanced to 15 and 13 rs. for shipment by fast and slow mail steamers respectively. —About 2,000 horses were exported. A large number of these were shipped from Mohammerah owing to an embargo imposed by the Turkish Government on the export of horses at the beginning of the season. River navigation. —The number of river steamers now plying on the Tigris between Basra and Bagdad is 11. Of these 5 belong to Idare Nehrieh, or Turkish Government Biver Administration, 3 to Messrs. Lynch Brothers (who have also a fourth steamer in reserve) and 3 to the Arab Steamship Company.BASRA. 11 The Euphrates service, established in 1910 by a native merchant, has been maintained, but under great difficulties. A steamer proceeds regularly to Kufa, and a launch is occasionally sent to Hindieh. Both tow-sbarges. The insecurity on the Euphrates offers great obstacles to navigation, and vessels are frequently blackmailed and otherwise interfered with by the Montific Arabs on the river banks. Messrs. ^ Lynch Brothers have also sent up light vessels on several occasions with material for the irrigation works, now being carried out at Hindieh and elsewhere by the Turkish Government, but the sailings are irregular and the journeys are undertaken at great risk to life and property. Custom-house .—The custom-house has now been roofed with corrugated iron. The contract was undertaken by a British firm and has been carried out satisfactorily. Tenders have been invited from resident foreign firms for doors and windows, and it is understood they will be completed shortly. The new building is now in use and greater protection is thus afforded than hitherto for cargo lying at Basra awaiting shipment to Bagdad.44 $ (638) 1*11 44 15 § JUJ To— India Aden BASRA.

Tre seated that he has had some 33 years experience of the Persian Gulf Trade, tooth in Turkey and Persia, but of recent v ears he has been Managing director of the iueroh Trading Co., which has been engaged solely i n the export trade (mainly in barley) from Busreh (with a little from Moharamerah)* The firm have, however, now given up trading, and dismissed their staff, because they find it impossible to o muete wi*h 'essrs. Wonckhaus in grain buying. Wonckhaus Bi^32 r M 0&gt;; tb;,ds. Wonckhaus h*is no resources of hie own - though he can obtain appa ently unlimited credit - and he has been on the dulf only a very few years, but the busreh Trading •, lit. 1 long expe ience in the trade and a competent staff on to Gulf, cannot meet his competition. It is believed that Wonokhaus gets from the H.A.L. very low freights for Gulf produce tc Hamburg, but there is no dsfinite evidence of this. Brit is ; and other shippers from the Gulf cannot normally get space on H.A.h. boats, for W nckhaus has a claim to all cargo space thereon, and usually exercises his rig ts. It ia admitted that a higher p. ice fex duty) is obtainable for the barley at Hamburg than in England, and that possibly Wonckhaus gets a lower freight on H.A.C. boats +han other shippers have tc pay on the lines which are available for them, but .nr Tweedy is convinced tha these facts do not explain fully Wonckhaus* ability to outbid them, a u; believes that Wcnckhaus recei ves a drawback of the German customB du^-y on barley (in whole or in part). He believes this b' cause Wonckhaus adopts the same policy of outbidding in reerect of other conmoditles (e.g. gum) in regard U w- icn frei this ace relatively less i uortant.SP 1 As evidence of * e unoo.meroial ohwaotor of Wonokhaue* operations, ir Tweedy mentioned that he knew of a period when Wonokhaus was holding ten thouo.nd tone of grain and refusing to sell when the price whs, at the highest- point ever reaohed in recent years; a„u that generally he seemed to be indifferent to the Movement of the market. :&gt;:r Tweedy aaid al ®o that he had acted fro , time to Ume in co “°P e ration with the mercantile department of ar “ complaint fhfc -K.Jk. or v.. lines - apparently in tun opinion lower freights homeward toy those lines would not reallv help British finar; md he seemed to think that no action by s .Government would le of* real use. It &amp; « !i*t Mr Strick has the contract for conveyance of ill the plant, ©to, required by the Anglo- Paraian Oil lo*, and ir uIbo to carry t:u in je-'oduct. tr Tweedy said that the only people who can carry on in the trade at Busreh (other than an English and an American firm, specialising in liquorice root and dates respectively) are those who, like Grey Paul &amp; Co. and Lynch, combine mercantile and shipping interest. Mr Tweedy stated also that Messrs Marcus Samuel have .recen 4 Ip appeared in the Gulf, as exporters of produce: i ' ie believed, however, that they have other motives, connected with oil trade developments in Mesopotamia. The decisive reason for the cessation of operations by the usreh Trading Co, appears to have been the convic tion tha sailings of the H.A.L. to the Gulf would shortly increase largely, owing to shipment® of railway material; that to fill them for the return voyage more grain wii; be required; and that the competition of ^onokhaus will therefore become still more intense.

Thus from one German vessel 14,095 bags of sugar with an estimated weight of ’over r.aoo tons have been landed at Bushtre. The prev.ous vessel had landed 4,100 bags. This shows a very rapid advance on the figures recently given in my Memo- random on the S th year of sailings by the Line, forwarded under Str Percy Cox s despatch No. .a, Commercial, of November at, whtch I re-quote for facility of reference, vis :— 1907- 08 1908- 09 6,47° bags. 8,560 „ 1909-10 ... ••• *’* IO, 7 2 4 i» , 9 ,o-u ... ... ... ... 37,034 „ ('3 vessels). It will be seen that an amount equivalent to half the last mentioned quantity has now been brought in 2 vessels alone. It would appear from the manifest that over 6,000 of the bags by the S.S. ‘Ekbatana’ were consigned by Messrs. E. D. Sassoon and Company to their agents in Bushire, and most of the shipment was made on orders by British firms in England through the large sugar brokers. This large increase in the handling of the sugar trade to Southern Persia emphasises the need which I have submitted in the Memorandum alluded to above, and previous reports, of early steps being taken to counteract the growing interest of Germany in the sugar trade of the Persian Gulf. Several alterna tives or joint courses for effecting this present themselves :— (a) By suggestions being made to British firms, such as Messrs. E- D- Sassoon and Company, Messrs. Ziegler and Company, shipping to the Gulf that they should stipulate in orders which they pass to their sugar brokers that shipments must be effected in British vessels. (b) By the large sugar brokers C. Czarnikow and Company being simi larly approached by the Board of Trade. (c) By British shipping Lines, such as Messrs, F. C. Strick and Com pany being urged to arrange a shipping contract with the Belgian refiners, on the termination, if impossible before termination, of the present contract with the Hamburg-Amerika Line. (d) By Messrs. Henry Tate and Sons, Limited, who have lately become interested in the export of their British refined crystal sugar ^ to the Persian Gulf, being urged to consider the question of setting up in their refinery the special moulding plant needed for the cones of loaf sugar, which are the sole type of export to Persia and the Gulf market, in view of the annually increasing demand for this shape of loaf sugar.

There is much more water than before . Ocean Steamers, which formerly loaded down to lb feet draft at Basra, can no* safety load down to 2 U feet and pass over the bar with little difficulty. High spring tides at the bar show auout 1^.6” depth of water. The British India Company's subsidiary i.aix steamers, which are lar^e vessels, usually now load down to 19 feet, so as to be on the safe side? they cross the bar at this craft and need no lighterage. Lighterage is not much required by incoming vessels but, testy's ln Incipal Secretary of State lor Foreign Affairs Sec cin certain cases, according to the nature rf the car o car- ' il3U ’ ° Ut&lt;J0lng v « Mls etm ll;',tered. This is especial -iy the case in the date Season owing to the nature of their car^o. “ 0 i .,8 Ships - for it defends very much on their build no lighterage at all and can take a full cargo at h asra; this is often the case with grain cargoes.

The barges however have not yet been built, and the idea seems to have bsen dropped, at all events provisionally. The 'Pionier' has been chartered by the Compagnie des transports fluviaux en Orient and is now employed in conveying material for the Ger- -man railway to Bagdad. It seems doubtful whether the lightering of steamers at the bar by means of barges and a tug would be practicable or safe. Local opinion is opposed to the idea but ; perhaps r the reason of this is that it has never been tried before. The sea Is sotiietlaie- rough at the bar, especially during the southerly galesgalea, anu It is often as much as the present steam lighters can do to put cargo safely on board the Ocean steamers In bad weather. Ihe strain on the lighters is very severe and the wear and tear excessive. Companies here are averse to employing good vessels for the purpose.

Andrew Weir and Company., and of the British India team Navi gation Company, or to other services between India and the Gulf, though these must necessarily be taken into account in estimating the relative Importance of British and foreign shipping interests in that region, 'urther, whilst it is unavoidable that the imports carried by the various lines should be stated in packages, this method renders comparison of the values of their cargoes impossible; but taking the statistics as they stand. the oard observe that, on a comparison of 1910-11 with 1909-10, imports by the Hamburg-America Line to Persian and Arabian ports showed no increase in respect of sugar and kerosene taken together and a heavy decline in general cargo. As regards imports at Pussorah and Bagdad, the very great increase in the number of pack ages carried by the same line appears to have been mainly in wood for date-boxes. As regards the question of the sugar trade, the Board have at present nothing to add to their previous observations on the subject; and as regards the Bxport trade from outnern Persia they see no reason to modify theirN I ' their opinion that it would he unreasonable to advise British traders to adopt methods which are admittedly unsound from the commercial point of view. jn this connexion I am to point out that ^ir P. ox and his Commercial Mvlser appear to think that r. trick, of the /-nglo-Algerian c 'teamship Company) is not well-informed as to the general situation in the •ulf, is consequently not acting In the manner best likely to serve his own interests; and is likely to be influenced by representations on the part of I is ajesty s Government. Che Hoard are, however, disposed to think from previous personal experience of that gentleman that the contrary is the case; and that hr Ptrick is fully satisfied with his own position. It is observed that average shipments to Bushire by vessels of the Anglo-Algerlan l ine (in which r. 'trick is mainly interested) showed a very large increase in 1910-11 over 1909-10. t lv ith regard to lighterage, which is dealt with in v - j_ r Cox’s despatch of the 24th. December, it would appear that is lajesty’s Consul-General is not fully informed as to the arrangements connected with the 'Societe'-ocieta dep tranpportB fluviaux H . ' ir E. Grey will I r ' recall that the interepts in the Company are divided equally between the Deutpche Bank and the Bagdad ail- way Company) and the Fuphratep and Tigrip ~team aviga- tion Company; that should an Anglo-German-Turkish Company Hi he subsequently formed, the Phares are to be divided equally between the Deutsche Bank for its representative), the Euphrates and Tigris Company, and the Ottoman Govern ment, and that should the last-named not subscribe the necessary capital, its share! is to be divided equally between the two other parties; that the operations of the Company are to be confined to the transport of railway material, or of downward cargo at rates not lower than those charged by the steamship companies operating on esopotamian rivers; and that the new fleet will be removed from Turkish internal waters so soon as the railway is completed, unless some arrangement for its further employment is made with the urkish Government. he oard would suggest that °ir P. Cox should tie informed of these facts, and also that. Inasmuch as the agdad ailway Company are entitled under their . concession to carry building and other material in their own boats, is aiestys Government raised no objection toto the preeant Bcheme when communicated to them in ad vance, since it secured a substantial British interest in this particular portion of the carrying trade, and in the construction of the necessary vessels. -lit although the judgment formed by c 'ir P. Cox and hie Commercial Adviser as to trade and shipping condi tions in the '-ulf appears to require modification in some respects, the Board have no reason to doubt its substantial accuracy, or to modify the opinion which they have previously expressed as to the general nature and purpose of Berman competition there. he entries and clearances of Berman vessels at ulf ports are increasing, even if their outward freight from urope in the year under review consisted largely of sugar and woodj they will probably henceforward carry to Bussorah large quantities of railway material, and the amburg-Z'merica ine are endeavouring to secure part of the freight hitherto carried in British vessels; and essrs. onckhaus by their uncommercial methods of business appear also to have made it difficult if not impossible, for British firms to engage in the grain export trade. On the other hand the Foard have some reasonreason reason to believe that the relations between the various British shipping companies and traders operating in the ilf are not altogether such as to facilitate co ) The Board are , however, in communication with a ascertaining their opinions on the present situation and as to a x^ossible course of act!onj and a furthei communication on the subject will be addressed to you shortly, 'hey cannot, however, conceal from themselves the fact that the competition which British traders are called upon to encounter is one which is not likely to be met effectively by action upon purely commercial lines. If, as the Board believe, Berman trade in the Bulf is deliberately conducted without regard to com mercial profit or loss, and with the object of marking out political claims, then British traders cannot reasonably be expected to take any competitive action which would involve them probably in fnancial loss and would not be likely to inflict a serious check upon operation Bermanl) Gernan trade aggression in that region. The chief factors in the prohlem are in the opinion of the Board cf .rade political rather than commercial, and unless FI* ajesty's Government are prepared to incur heavy financial liabilities in order to support private Pritish traders in this region it appears to the Hoard of 'rade that nothing but political action could effectively improve the situation.

Cox's telegram 115, 19th January, to London Foreign Office. While agreeing that present opportunity should be used to obtain certain definite concessions from Persian Government, we submit following remarks on desiderata enumerated by Cox:— yl-) Recognition of our prescriptive right to buoying, lighting, and policing of Gulf is most desirable and should be pressed, but no reaffirmation regarding quarantine seems necessary. ( 2 .) This might stand over as not urgent. (3.) Such undertaking would be impossible without previous agreement of Russian Government, which it is doubtless inconvenient to seek at present juncture, as this would probably involve counter demands from Russia. (4.) Navigation rights on Karun are not pressing, but might be mentioned. (5.) Our de facto position at Bahrein and on Trucial coast is assured vis-a-vis Persia, but we might demand recognition of British Consular protection in Persia for Bahrein and Trucial subjects. ( 6 ) and (7) might stand over and be dealt with when occasion arises. As regards last paragraph of Cox’s telegram, we think that if general subject of British interests in Persia is to be broached, we should certainly press for an undertaking from Persia not to lease or alienate any island, or part of island, in Gulf to other Powers without our concurrence—and further undertake to lease to us, should occasion arise, such portions of Kishm, Henjam, Hormuz, Larak, and Sheikh-Shuaib Island as may be required in connection with lighting, buoying, and policing of Gulf, and for convenience of His Majesty’s ships so employed.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. J 4 ) 5 ^ and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. - V ' 7 \ ' The Undersecretary of State for Foreign A fairs presents hts compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for and, by direction of the Secretary of % State, transmits herewith cop'&amp;o 0 f the under-mentioned paper.

Willi reference to the correspondence ending with my despatch No. 6 Commercial dated the 11th September, 1910, I have the honour to forward a copy of a memorandum by Mr. H G. Chick, my commercial adviser, on the question of lighterage m the Persian Gulf. 2 . This matter is one intimately connected with our commercial and shipping interests m this region, and recent developments in connection with the progress of the Bagdad Railway, which are outlined in Mr. Chick’s memorandum, emphasise the necessity for action m the matter without delay. Mr. Chick’s memorandum does not purport to be exhaustive, but should be read in conjunction with previous corre spondence on the subject, in which the matter was discussed in some detail, so far as the Persian ports of the Gulf were concerned. The question of lighterage on the Shatt-el-Arab Bar has not, however, been raised before, but its inclusion in the project seems likely to be favourable rather than otherwise to the chances of the success of the project, for the following reasons :— ( 1 .) The direct piofits, both of the shipping companies and the lighterage syndicate, seem calculated to be greater from this branch of the scheme than from operations in the Persian ports, at which lighterage operations are not likely to be very remunerative, and may even show a small deficit. (2.) All shipping companies have a large direct influence in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arab, and would stand to gain very considerably by the introduction of improved arrangements. 3. On the other hand, the proposed lighterage syndicate would probably find it necessary to conduct its operations m Purkey by means of a separate company registered in Turkey, in accordance with Turkish law, and might even find it expedient to run its boats under the Turkish flag; but these and other cognate points, such as the position of the lighterage company vis-d-vis the proposed Riverain Commission, cannot as yet be profitably discussed. 4. In view of the admittedly unsatisfactory state of the question at present, both in its commercial and political aspects, I earnestly hope that His Majesty’s Foreign Office will feel able to move the Board of Trade with a view to the question being dealt with by the conference of shippers and ship-owners suggested in my despatch No. 12, Commercial, dated the 21st November. 5. I may mention incidentally that Mr. W. Weir, a partner in Messrs. Andrew Weir and Company, has just concluded a lengthy visit to Bagdad, Bussorah, and Bushire. In discussing shipping matters, including lighterage, he laid great stress on the difficult j relations which prevailed between the British shipping lines; for this he blamed Mr. Strick’s unsatisfactory methods of treating gulf business and those concerned in it. It was easier, he mentioned, to deal with Sir John Ellerman. It would, no doubt, be impossible for Messrs. Weir and Company to take an active and leading part in sounding other lines regarding either lighterage or shipping agree ments, but on Mr. Weir’s return to London, I venture to think, the company at any rate would be likely to respond to any overtures by the Foreign Office. 6 . Since Mr. Chick’s memorandum was placed before me, I have received copies of the correspondence originating with Sir H. Babington Smith’s letter to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, dated the 21st October, on behalf of the National Bank of Turkey, in which a combination of foreign interests connected with navigation and transport on the Tigris and Euphrates is mooted. This correspondence, still unfinished, demonstrates unmistakably the lively interest which elements unconnected with British shipping and commercial interests are taking in the subject, and accentuates the urgency which exists for the several British lines or firms to adopt, before matters develop further, [2763 s—1] 4 FEB 1913a constructive and cohesive policy in regard to lighterage and cognate questions Failing that it is difficult to see how they can hope to maintain such a predomman position on these rivers, as shall be independent of foreign combinations, m all... ^famLnXgTopies oflht despatet with enclosure, to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Minister. I have &amp;c. ’ P Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in 'the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty’s Consul- General for Pars, &amp;c. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum on Lighterage by a British Company in the Persian Gulf. HIS Majesty’s Government have recently had under consideration the important question of lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf, especially those on the Shatt-el-Arab bar. The interests of Great Britain with regard to the Shatt-el-Arab are recognised as so far predominant that the proposed river commission is to be under joint Anglo- Turkish direction, while as regards the shores of the Gulf proper, Government has approved of a scheme of lighthouses and gas buoys, which is m lively progress ol execution. By these means it is hoped to reassert and maintain the British position in these respects in the Gulf, and to avert the possibility of future interference by o t lie r Powers. Now that these two questions are on a fair road to settlement, a thiid, that of lighterage, is beginning to obtrude, and presents dangers to British trade of the near future, for’ which it is submitted an early remedy must be sought. In a memorandum dealing with the first year s sailings of the German company to the Persian Gulf, forwarded under Sir P. Z. Cox s despatch No. 7, Commercial, of the 25th November, 1907, the undersigned pointed out the advantages which were to be expected from the institution of a regular lighterage service from the roadstead to the shore at the port of Bushire. A detailed supplementary report was drawn up and forwarded by Sir P. Z. Cox, dated the 19th March, 1908, to Mr. Marling, who sent it on to the Foreign Office. It would appear from Sir Louis Mallet’s letter of the 10th February, 1908, to the Board of Trade, that the question was considered an urgent one by both those departments, and Mr. Marling urged that the Board of Trade should impress upon the British shipping companies concerned a full sense of their responsibility. The Foreign Office called for a further report on Bushire lighterage by their No. 24096/10 of the 14th July, 1910. This was submitted under No. 6 , Commercial, of the 11th September, 1910, from Bushire. It is futile to occupy time in regretting that the British companies took no combined steps then ; we have to provide for the situation with which we are now confronted, and which has been aggravated by disregard paid previously. The fact is that through lack of cohesion the British shipping companies in question are not on working terms with each other. The British India Steam Navigation Company did, it is true, in February, 1909, suddenly order its agents at Bushire and one or two other ports to purchase native craft as lighters, and to lighter all their own cargoes. As regards Bushire, various local difficulties and lack of support by the other lines have prevented the British India Company’s agents from employing more than three lighters up to the present date, and the position is still very unsatisfactory, as there are frequent claims for demurrage, while the Persian boatmen are becoming more and more truculent in their dealings with local steam-ship agents. Opinion of the latter is unanimous as to the urgent necessity of a lighterage company with steam tugs. Messrs. F. C. Strick and Company, in 1910, during my visit to London, seemed willing to concert with the British India Company, but nothing apparently came of it. Lighterage arrangements at Bunder Abbas are, similarly, proving a thorny problem. As regards lighterage in the Shatt-el-Arab, the system at present in vogue by which vessels of ordinarily deep draft only load half cargoes at Bussorah and then have to drop down to the Shatt-el-Arab bar to finish, while smaller steamers bring theI on the Bussorah bar is therefore a costlv^frvm LU 1 lIieir ( ? wners ’ an( i ten days j Bussorah itself by the British companies and werp thp 16 .^ arges are use d in 1 from the operations of Ihe^oS 1 Et “thlhXpany to it wfn rriztr^: Sr: “ a i^z med ? “ institution is Anglo-Turco-German in compositiot, and it is toZVpresumed thaUhe German elemen m it is the strongest, for the Bagdad Railway and Deutsche Bank groups are deeply interested, while the British element is represented only bv Messrs Lynch Brothers (Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company). ? 7 Bussorah tZf ttartiZ worW C 1 ? mbma ] tlon . ^ sported by His“ Majesty’s consul at are leased to the t ^ good ground to suspect that Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company will now have a grea? deal to do with the work between Bussorah and the Shatt-el-Arab bar. As a matter of fact, Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company are continuing to forward the railway material to Bagdad up to the 1 st February, 1913. One tug for the Anglo-Turco-German Company has already reached Bussorah, three more are to arrive before May, 1913 and a fth later. Two barges arrived m October, four more are due now, and three are to arrive on the first of each month up to April, 1913. by May ^ meanS that an entire fleet of ei g hteen barges and four tugs will be working p n Ia addlt i°n, Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company have within the past few weeks brought up a launch, the Pioneer, ’ to tow barges from the bar to Bussorah, a motor boat, a large twin screw tug, and a single screw launch. It is, therefore, clear that lighterage, launch and tug craft under foreign flags in the course of 1913 will exceed the number of similar craft owned by British steam-ship compames. Apart from barges, I believe these to number about eight, most of them old vessels, spall steamers rather than lighter craft. This eclipsing of the numerical and practical superiority of British interests in the tower river may have far-reaching results ; it can only lead to a greater encouragement o g oreigner in a* locality wIigi 6 h .6 is not wanted, at present. It will be remembered, too, that the Germans are taking the most elaborate pains to capture the bulk of the export trade. An extension of German or other foreign lighterage arrangements between Bussorah and the Shatt-el-Arab bar would, however, be even more menacing to British interests than their control of transport between Bussorah and Bagdad; and it does not seem at all conceivable that, with Turkish claims to a greater share than other nations in the lighting, buoying, dredging, and other forthcoming improvements of the channel between the bar and Bussorah, Turkish and German influence will be at work to claim the future lighterage system. To forestall any steps in the future, which would be likely to tie the hands of the British steamer agencies and react against the expansion of exports to Great Britain, while encouraging foreign interests, it is very necessary that the British shipping companies already concerned should lay the foundation of a lighterage service at once. Established now, the position of such a company would be secure from any future objections. Both, therefore, as regards Bushire, Bunder Abbas, etc., and as regards Bussorah and the Shatt-el-Arab, the British shipping companies would be wise to take early action. In my opinion it is essential that lighterage at the Gulf ports and at the bar should be put on a consolidated British basis by all the following companies, participating in the formation of a lighterage company :— British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited. Anglo-Algerian Line, Limited (Messrs. F. C. Strick and Company). Bucknall Steam-ship Lines (Sir John Ellerman). Andrew Weir and Company.Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited. Arab Steam-ship Lines, Limited. Bombay-Persia Steam Navigation Company. West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company, Limited. (N.B.—The first six named are the most influential to-day.) On account of past differences of opinion there is, however, no likelihood the lighterage question being seriously taken up, unless the Foreign Office an oar of Trade make the necessary proposals to each company, and bring the various directors together. It is through this aloofness and indifference to national interests by the British lines that the solidarity of German enterprises m the Gulf is making such stndjSj iave alrea q y explained in my report on German shipping and trade for 1910-11 the urgent need for Government to take the opening steps for bringing together British shipping interests, and this very important matter of lighterage, m itself requiring joint British action, furnishes a suitable opportunity for doing so.

C. Chick, on German Trade and Shipping for the fifth year of the Hamburg-Amenca Company’s sailings to the Gulf. His Majesty’s Government will understand that for the reasons explained in my No. 7-Commercial dated 23 rd July 19 ^, it is not possible for this periodical report to be completed for submission for'a considerable time after the period to which the statistics relate, but as far as German Trade in Persia (apart from hipping) is concerned, the position discussed is that which presented itself at the end of last month. 2. The figures for the period dealt with show a general increase in the number of sailings, and in the quantity of cargo brought from Europe, a slight decrease in the figures for the Persian and Arab ports being more than compen sated by an increase of _ over 100 per cent in the imports for Baghdad and . usreh : as anticipated in the previous year’s Report, the German line is rapidly increasing its controlling interest in sugar in the Persian Gulf region, the imports of sugar for the period under Report being about 30 per cent in advance of the previous year s figures, and about 35 per cent of all the sugar imported up the Persian Gulf (about 40,000 tons) is now coming in German vessels ; imports of British sugar (Messrs. Tate’s) decreased considerably. 1 3. Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. took advantage of a good grain season to make large purchases, regardless of prices ruling at home : and by the end of the wheat season they had succeeded in shipping nearly twice as much barley as, and more wheat than, all the British firms in Bushire combined : very similar results attended their operations at Mohammerah and Busreh and it is not too f much to say that during the past season they practically controlled the export trade in grain. 4. Having regard to the view of the Government of India and of the Board of Trade that no case for intervention at present has been made out, either on political or commercial grounds, I hesitate to do more now than to invite the lively consideration of His Majesty’s Government to the suggestions for action put forward in the concluding paragraph of Mr. Chick’s Report, and to revert to the recommendation made in paragraph 3 of my above quoted despatch, that the Board of Trade be asked to convene a small conference of shippers and ship owners to discuss both questions and advise as to the most effective means of regaining the ground lost during the past two years.2 &lt; As regards the necessity for action by His Majesty s Government to assist British shippers, speaking generally, I see no reason to modify the conclu- aS , , . , M „ v sions reached in my despatch No. 2-Com- to F0relgn ’ NO ’ ,23 °’ 3 mercial, dated Ma/. 2th, .909, and I beg anain to urge on His Majesty’s Government the expediency and vital importance to us taking active steps, whether by means of subsidies or otherwise, to support our commercial interests in this region, which are now being threatened by effective Russian competition in the North, thanks to the comparative security of the roads of Northern Persia, whilst simultaneously, in the south, our carrying trade in the Gulf and commercial predominance in Southern Persia is being undermined by the State-aided competition of the Hamburg-Amenca Line.Imports to Persian and Arab ports were therefore slightly less on the aggre gate than in iqoo-io, and 1907-08 : while imports to Turkish ports on the Tigris more than douUed any previous year, reaching the high figure of 326,814 packages.

As to general cargo, there has been a large decrease in coffee, iron bars, vermicelli imported by the German line to Persian and Arab ports \ and in coffee, matches, colours, and piece-goods to Basreh : while ironware, candles, liquors, glassware, paper had increased import to Basreh. It is satisfactory to note that the decrease in iron bars is due to the courtesy of Messrs. Forbes, Forbes, Campbell and Co. in consenting to refrain from shipping by the German line to Bandar Abbas.

I have now quoted more extensive statistics to show that the position is more serious than is apparently recognized, and that great progress has been made by the German line during the period under report. The Board of Trade’s Confidential Memorandum of November 14th, 1911, on this subject summed up the situation as follows. They noted that all ship ments from the St. Louis refinery in Marseilles were for the present pledged to the British lines : they hoped that Messrs. Henry Tate and Sons had now inter ested themselves in the Gulf Trade: and though Messrs. Tate were unable to manufacture loaf-sugar in cones, the only shape acceptable in the Persian market, the firm hope to push a sale in their cube-sugar: lastly the Board of Trade thought it quite possible that the West Hartlepool S. N. Co. were working on an understanding with the Hamburg-America line and they hinted that the “ Raffinerie Tirlemontoise ” might have made long period contracts with the Hamburg-America line. They were unable to suggest any measure for the improvement of the situation. These conclusions on the part of the Board of Trade, depending as they did in a great measure on hypothetical premises, afforded cold comfort to those on the spot, impressed with the increasing seriousness of the danger ahead. I beg respectfully to offer some comment on their observations. Firstly. —It is understood that the contracts between the lines controlled by Messrs. Strick and Co. and the St. Louis refineries at Marseilles terminate in 1913 or 1914. What assurance is there that Messrs. Strick and Co. will obtain a renewal ? and what would be the position if the Hamburg-America Line secure the carriage of all the loaf-sugar, now carried by the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall lines ? At the present time the shipments by these Companies to the Gulf amount to anything up to 10,000 tons. We know that the Hamburg-America, and their Gulf agents, are hankering after the Marseilles contracts : we know the importance that German officials and the German line give to their grasp of the sugar-trade : the Hamburg- America line admittedly care very little at what rate they effect shipments from and to the Gulf, as long as they can obtain a control of the trade : they can afford to underbid Messrs. Strick and Co. (as they already do whenever they can) and there is every reason to foresee this. Were the British lines to lose these contracts, the entire sugar-trade with the Gulf would pass to German shipping except for some crystal sugar via London, and the trade by the British India Steam Navigation Company from Bombay. Secondly&gt; —It is well not to be deceived as to the extent of Messrs. Tate and Sons’ position as exporters of British-rgfined sugar to the Gulf. In my Reports on German Trade and Shipping for 1906-07 and 1907-08 it was advocated that Messrs. Tate should be asked to interest themselves in the Gulf market. The Board of 1 rade took up the matter, and favourable terms of shipment were arranged in 1910. According to information, furnished to me by Messrs. Tate and Sons, they have shipped to the Gulf in the period :— Tons, ... ... 2,065 crystal sugar. ••• ••• 7*5 » v 55 ° v » October 1910—July 1911 March 1911—March 1912 March 1912—July 1912 • f •C71FD 9 Tate's tolf sSgar Tr, clef k 9 ’ 'd Sa BUSh ? ° r f MeSSrs ' agents : but Messrs.

Fourthly.-—It seems very probable that the Raffinerie Tirlemontoise has made long period contracts with the German line : but it is very necessary that the date ot expiry of such contracts should be known. Could not enquiries be 1 instituted by the Board of Trade through His Majesty’s Consul-General at Antwerp as to the approximate date ? Should there be no contracts, or should clearer 16 ° f ^ ^ P ° Siti0n ° E British LineS WOuld becorae much / The Board of Trade memorandum alludes to Mr. Strick’s reticence and general attitude. This is certainly unsatisfactory, but I see no reason why he should not be pressed, with good results. It is stated in the memorandum that it appeared mipossibJe to get at the actual facts without a direct enquiry of Mr. btnck, and it was doubted if he would be willing to give any definite inform- atmru It is difficult to understand this. On the contrary, Mr. Strick is not a little indebted to Government in connection with Hormuz red-oxide, transport ot Government coal and for assistance in his general shipping business in the Persian Gulf and in his schemes for mineral concessions in Persia. Government has every right to his confidence on the subject both of sugar and of shipping understandings in the Gulf. rr &amp; Mr. Strick s position is perhaps not quite realized. A prosperous ship owner, he has many irons in the fire, of which the Persian Gulf trade is only one. But he is very much inclined to leave his import and export trade here to look after itself, without troubling to meet local requirements: he is very deaf to suggestions by hG local agents and others : and he certainly has not the same statistical information as to the trend of trade up the Gulf as Government officials can furnish to him. If his lines lost the Marseilles sugar contracts, we should probably see him quite content to obtain a corresponding 5,000—10,000 tons of freight elsewhere in Europe for India. At the same time it is doubtful if he knows that the Germans have already captured such a proportion of the sugar-trade, as is shown above in great detail, or if he realizes that the Gulf sugar trade is likely to expand with pending developments. That he is slow to promote British enterprise is amply shown by his indiff erence to recommendations of the utility of a British Lighterage Company, to request demi-officially and from his agents that his steamers should make Bahrein a direct port of call, and by his ignoring our protests against the increase of homeward freights in 1911 on grain shipments by British firms at Bushire. The Board of Trade, in the last sentence of Section I of their memo randum, commenting on Mr. Strick’s assertion that such an increase could not possibly have any harmful effect, did not feel themselves able to controvert this statement : this surely indicates that neither Mr. Strick nor the Board of Trade have appreciated the immediate effect of such an increase in freight rates on exports from Southern Persia to Great Britain; an effect which is fully demon strated in my remarks under the heading of “ Wonckhaus and Company’s cap ture of grain business ”. If this estimate of Mr. Strick’s general attitude be at all correct, it is likely ’ that, unless Government—the party most concerned—are able to use pressure /on stimulate or support Mr. Strick to secure for himself continuance of the Marseilles contracts at all costs, the Germans will make a further inroad into our shipping position. In any case, it surely is possible for Government to make known its wishes to Mr. Strick on the subject. Goods imported by, or consigned to, Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company were considerably less than corresponding Messrs. R.

E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co. had 14,022 packages, and Messrs. Ziegler 3,155 packages for Bushire : Messrs. Lynch 1,320 packages for Mohammerah : Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. 1,850 packages for Lingah. Messrs. Forbes Forbes, Campbell &amp; Co.’s public-spirited action in refrain ing from shipping by these German vessels ought to be followed by the above-named British firms. Particularly in the case of Belgian sugar, the purchase of which from the Refinery is negotiated through Messrs. Czarnikow or the Societe de l 5 Exportation des Sucres, it is thought that British con signers could, if they exerted themselves and were brought to realize the increasing danger of allowing transport to the Gulf to fall to a German Shipping Company, so notoriously representative of German forward policy as the Hamburg-America, without much extra cost insist on their brokers arranging for all Belgian sugar to be transhipped vid London to the Gulf. Though they have not occurred during the fifth year of sailings under e ,. u report, it is necessary here, in order to emphasize the current trend or events, to allude to the overtures made by the Hamburg-America line in Manchester to several firms, who have recently begun considerable trade in cottons to the Gulf, and who are not under contract to ship by Messrs, Strick’s lines. The firms in question are : Holdsworth Hougie &amp; Co., Abdullah Elias &amp; Sons, W. W. Churchill &amp; Co., Ltd. Mr. Hougie, a partner in the first-named firm, asked for explanations, made the important statement that, whereas there had been for two years or so an understanding between the British shipping lines and the Hamburg-America Line, late in 1911 or early in 1912 German representatives had been round to British shippers in Manchester, trying to take away business from the British lines. ^ ^ W hereas contract rates between the British cotton exporters and Messrs, otrick &amp; Co. are 30 shillings per ton, and the rate to firms not under contract 35 shillings, Mr. Hougie’s firm was getting from the Hamburg-America a through rate considerably less than 30 shillings per ton, by sending cottons from Manchester to Hamburg by sea, and thence to Bushire. In about six months, 5 °° .6°° places have already been sent to Bushire by this route, others for Koweit, and others probably for Baghdad. . I submit that this is a most unsatisfactory development for British trade interests. Here we have the most powerful German line, with Herr Ballin and overnment backing behind it, not content with effectively assailing the position of British firms in regard to the export trade at Bushire, Mohammerah and usre , by means of a substantial shipping rebate, but even trying to undermine the position of the British shipping Companies in Manchester itself. On the top of this came information from Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. on March 2 t that a ^ ter a silence of two years the Hamburg-America Line approac e th^m in March last with a view to raising outward freights.

Outgomg traffic still leaves room for improvement.-' Putting these facts together, it is clear that the German Line controls General remarks—imports. foe situation, and dictates terms to the Mr George Lloyd, M P in February 'and T C ? m P anie fi s ’ ? ve ' as reported by West Hartlenonl Stppm 'iM • ?• an ^ I9 ° 8 ‘ ^ has separated the /u„ artl pP°ol ^team Navigation Company from the Strick and Bucknall (Lllerman) interests : it has stopped these two lines from going to Antwerp for ugar and other cargo : by allowing a large rebate to shipments by the German firm it is enabling them to ship to London more cheaply than British firms and at the SXVl U d nderSe1 !, ^ rms ' n fhe Gull and so prevertthem'^ ikying? r reights for London and elsewhere are being constantly cut by the Hambur?- Amenca Line. Finally the Hamburg America Line has laid itself out to increate its outgoing traffic, in part by attracting Manchester non contract cargo to Hamburg with rates far below those of the British lines. At the same tinfe the Hamburg-America Line lead Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. to increase their rates on non contract cargo by a further 2s. 6d. allround: the net result of which is to give the Hamburg-America Line a further advantage in Manchester, and also as against sugar shipped from London. T u 6 dlsa S reeabIe impression conveyed by this concatenation of events is ? that the Hamburg-America Line is pursuing a definite policy towards controlling s ipping between Europe and the Gulf, possibly in order to subserve its railway I interests in Mesopotamia, and certainly in order to spread German Trade at the head of the Persian Gulf : while on the other hand the British Shipping Lines, Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co (and for the Bucknall-Elerman interest), the West Hartlepool Company and Andrew Weir &amp; Co. and the British India Company, are ^working in a haphazard manner, without any concord of interests and policy. Either Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. are being left in ignorance of the trend of trade, or they not paying detailed attention to the needs of shippers and consignees at each port in the Gulf, nor trying to strengthen their position. I Their answer to the Commercial Intelligence Branch as regards the action of Manchester firms in shipping via Hamburg is a case in point. ( They were satisfied that they held the bulk of the Manchester shipments under contract ) and were not concerned about the outside firms : as these outside firms had refused to come in with them originally, Messrs. Strick w T ere not going to admit such firms—at the latter’s pleasure—later.’ The Commercial Intelligence Branch considered this natural: but they surely overlooked the need for Messrs. Strick to have an eye to political exigencies as well. Messrs, Strick &amp; Co. do not realize that during the past five years trade in Manchester cottons to the Persian Gulf has been rapidly falling into the hands of Jewish firms, generally of the Manchester-Baghdad connection, who are under selling the older-established English firms and quietly pushing them off the j market. These Jewish firms have methods, wTich the other firms are loath to !12 - follow : they do business at a far lower profit in markets where cheapness counts for everything. The Hamburg* America Line is now allowing them to land their cottons from 5s. tc ios. per ton cheaper than the British lines, thus enabling them to undersell other competitors in similar cotton goods. ^ In the cases cited above Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. might, it seems, make an exception as a matter of policy, and pocket their pride. Lest it should be presumed that Messrs. Strick are^ in the best position to obtain information on which to gauge their own interests in the Gulf, it might be noted that His Majesty’s representatives at the ports watch every package landed by German steamers, and being more numerous than Messrs. Strick s few agents, are probably in a better position to gauge the flow of trade. We can fully appreciate the conclusions in the Board of Trade Memorandum of November 6th, 1911, that German enterprise will not be driven from the Gulf by any losses incurred: that British firms will not adopt unsound German methods : and that on commercial grounds British ship-owners will not enter into a conflict with the Hamburg-America line But I venture to think that when we see that the commercial position of British shipping and trade in the Gulf is undoubtedly being more menaced and a worse state of disorganization dis closed each succeeding year, it is urgently necessary that the Board of trade should make specific recommendations to His Majesty s Government and ask their help in the provision of a remedy. In one direction at any rate the Board of Trade could effect a great improve ment. The strength of the German position lies in the intimate co-operation prevailing between the Government, the principal German banks, the Hamburg- America fine and Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. I submit that the weakness of the British position lies in the utter disregard of mutual and collective interests. Would it not be possible for the Board of Trade to get into closer touch with Messrs. Strick &amp; Co , and the other shipping companies interested,^ and put before them the desirability of an understanding between all the British com panies with the object of strengthening the general position of British shipping in the Gulf ? It should not be difficult to explain to Mr. Strick in particular the uneasiness that is felt locally in the Gulf, and the resentment by British firms of the better opportunities afforded to the Germans. Mr. Stnck might be warned of the great interest taken by His Majesty’s Government in the increase of trade at all Persian ports, and asked if he cannot arrange for local needs at each port to be better met, and greater consideration to be shown to shippers in freight rates. Mr. Strick has often of necessity to be in touch with Government departments, and we are entitled to look to him for assistance. lonnage of cargoes. —With the limited details at our disposal it is only possible to make an estimate that shippped to the Persian Gulf ports approximated 8,000 tons: sugar to Basreh and Baghdad 11,000 tons: and that the balance of general cargo to Persian ports was about 4,500 tons : to Basreh and Baghdad 8,500 tons. Average weight of outward cargo carried by each of the 13 steamers would therefore be some 2,500 shipping tons. To this has to be added :— Port Sudan and Djibouti cargo. —According to Customs figures from the former port the 13 vessels under report imported 37 714 packages as against 39,200 for the previous year of sailings. The 37,714 packages were shipped from— Hamburg ... ... ... ••• ••• 4 ^ 3 ^ Antwerp ... ... ... ••• ••• 18,320 Port Said ... ..» ... ••• ••• I 4 j 5 b^ Port Said cargo consisted of :—Salt 7,500 packages ; Petroleum and oil 5,269 packages. Of the Antwerp cargo, Iron Bars, and rails, 8,380 bundles : Sugar 1,330 packages. Cargo for Port Sudan, roughly reckoned according to shipping scale, should have been little more than a total 2,000 shipping tons, or less than 200 tons per vessel. As to the Djibouti cargo, no details are available. On the whole, accord ing to the tonnage scale, the German vessels for the year under report carried rather heavier outward cargoes than in previous years.In addition to the 45,875 tons grain (more than 50,000 tons on the shipping scale) package cargo from Basreh is calculated to have measured about 6,400 tons (shipping scale), and cargo from other ports about 1,130 tons. Total exports from the Persian Gulf in German vessels therefore reached about 60,000 tons, or an average of 4,600 tons for 13 vessels. Moreover, the Hamburg-America line at the beginning of 1911 determined by arrangement with the Hansa Line to Export cargo from Malabar Coast of India. send their vessels to the Malabar Coast of India as cargo in the Persian Gulf was then insufficient to fill their ships. Six vessels in this way proceeded from the Gulf to the ports of Mangalore, Tellicherry, Calicut and Cochin. Altogether 8,337 tons of cargo were shipped for Hamburg, Antwerp, Havre, Higa, etc,, an average of 1,389 tons per vessel. The principal goods taken were— Coffee ••• ... • • • • •• Tons. 2,957 Pepper ... ... ... ... • • t L9I5 Coir yarn ... ... ...

Adding the Malabar cargo to the Persian Gulf cargo, a grand total of about 68,33/ tons is obtained, or an average Total export tonnage by line. of ^ per According to a letter from Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co.’s Chief Manager in the Gulf to a British merchant in Bushire they (as shipping agents) had to fill large steamers of about 5,000—6000 tons each month. Outward cargo has been calculated in this report to have been about 2,700 tons, and homeward cargo 5,200 tons on an average per vessel. These figures confirm the statement in the Hamburg'America Company’s report on their Gulf service for 1911: “The amount of homeward cargo offering has increased, outgoing traffic still leaves room for improvement”. German activity in the grain trade of the Gulf dates from the months of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co.’s capture of grain January and February 1911, when it business. became clear that a good harvest was to be expected in the whole Gulf region, and the peasantry started disposing of reserve. As noted in my last report, credits were open in January 1911 for Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., to the extent of ^70,000 by the Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Orient Bank and Ferdinand Jacobson of Berlin and Hamburg, and Martin’s Bank of London in drafts of 4 months’ usance payable in London, also ^40,000 in February 1911 by German Banks. They were thus enjoying strong financial support in Germany. They at once began a policy of buying all visible stocks at Basreh, Muham- merah and Bushire, outbidding British firms and forcing prices up above London limits : this policy was continued throughout the year, and was much resented 7** by British firms. Thus in January 1911 the Germans paid for Basreh barley, described as rubbish by British firms, 5J—5 liras while the limit for British firms was 4! liras. For dariseed the Germans were paying in Basreh 15s. -6^., when London prices were only 14s. f. 0. b. With the Hamburg market only slightly in advance of London for barley, the Germans were paying is. a quarter more : and British firms were unable to secure purchases. In Bushire consistently throughout 1911 the German agents used to pass down the grain wharf, buying at whatever prices were asked by sellers, and iti 5 .vas sufficient that a British aeent made an nfW fnr largely owing to official British influence with the district Khans ^ com Pe‘e, Shipments from Bushire for the official year—March lot 1-13— according tr, customs documents, were by-— J y 12 according to Wheat.

There is a mass of evidence as to the manner in which British competition was stifled {a) The advances to tribesmen alluded to in my letter of October 1st, 1911, and commented on in Section 4 {a) of the Board of Trade Memorandum were not, as the Board supposed, advances against growing crops,^ but advances in the German Office at Bushire against grain just brought into the wharf by tribesmen sellers, who flocked to the German Office knowing that they would give any prices that were asked. (b) In the summer of 1911, when reserve coin (with which all purchases outside Bushire have to be made) in the Imperial Bank of Persia had sunk very low, and the Bank was refusing to buy drafts of British firms, the German credits became exhausted; but they forced the hands of the Bank by getting fresh credits opened in the London Branch of Imperial Bank, with the result that the Bank’s reserves were opened to the German firm, and still more firmly closed to British firms. In June 1911, the Germans were selling drafts on London at a rate of ij krans (about 7^.) less per £\ sterling than the Bank’s rates. They shipped krans to Bushire from Karachi, Bombay and Busreh. (c) While on the one hand the grain purchase was often far below the quality that British firms would buy and a great deal was weevilled and had to be re-cleaned, the German dealings with Persians were on a scale of liberality impossible for British firms. They engaged additional premises at any price asked, and at the end of December 1911 paid several hundred pounds as a bonus to all their German and Persian employes in Bushire, an unprecedented proceeding. (d) Reports from Basreh showed that they were “contracting out pur chases to influential persons on liberal terms ”.( e \ Yet despite the manner in which money was flung about, it was V J reported at the end of 1911 that the firm estimated their profits at ^ 3 0 » 000 * The solution of this capacity for buying at prices outside the range of British firms of Wonckhaus’ large profits, apparently ^reckless dealing, and in parti cular’ of their aggressive attitude towards British buyers, is to be found in the shipping rebate, or low rate of freight, by which the ^ Hambug-Amenca Line is promoting German interests in the Gulf. There is clear evidence of this in a remarkable letter by Mr. Thos. Brown, Messrs. Wonckhaus chief business man in Basreh. to British merchants in Bushire. In April 1911 , the German firm attempted to form a combine with British firms in Bushire, for the nominal purpose of keeping dou^ prices, but their terms were that they, Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co , should be entitled to 0/ all the wheat bought in Bushire, and all the bavley. Several British firms, feel- [nv themselves already in an inferior position owing to the higher prices that Wonckhaus &amp; Co. were offering and threatened with worse conditions by the British shipping lines, who were raising ireights to 2$s. } were inclined to surrender to the German demands. Fortunately Messrs. Dixon &amp; Co. boldly stood out, relying on official support in their operations along the coast, and thus prevented an understanding. The head of Wonckaus &amp; Co. in the letter mentioned above, used the following language :— “ I am anxious to come to an arrangement regarding grain purchases in Bushire and districts: if we have failed up to now to arrange to combine it is, in my humble opinion, due to the fact that Dixon &amp; Co. do not regard my position in the proper light. All I ask \s \\\2X I shall be the only barley pur chaser, and that you and Dixon further agree to give us the barley out of your wheat at market rate We have to fill large steamers, say about 5,000 to 6,000 tons each month So you see, I want bulk and lots of it. If Dixon cannot or will not understand my position, of course, we shall all be the losers thereby, he will lose more than I As we ship in bulk, have cheaper freights, and are in the swim of the market through our Basreh and Mohammerah transactions, we shall always do better than he”. Cheaper freight for the German firm in Hamburg-America steamers, about 155. per ton, meant that when the limit of price for British firms in Bushire shipping at 205. to 225. 6^. was 14-15 krans for about 1 cwt. of wheat, the German firm could afford to pay 16 to ib-J krans, on an average ij krans per cwt. or 5 krans per quarter higher than British. Native Persian sellers natur ally wanted to get the highest prices, and in the result the British firms were kept out of the local market for the greater part of the year. It w r as for this reason that this Consulate-General protested so strongly against a rise in freights by the British lines. When Messrs. Strick replied to the Board of Trade on October 3rd, 1911, that they understood “ that space by the Hamburg-America Company’s steamers is fully booked up to the end of the year, and consequently any alteration that we might make in the rates of freight would have no effect on the quantities carried or the freights charged by the Hamburg-America during that period ”. They failed to grasp that the large margin between their increased rates and the German Line’s rate was simply enabling the German frm to buy all visible stocks at their own prices, and preventing the british firms at Bushire from buying grain at all. 1 his reacted on British shipping companies by providing them with half the amount of grain cargo from Bushire which they otherwise might have had if British firms had been able to go on competing with German prices. Conclusions and Suggestions. The position, details of which are given above, is decidedly unsatisfactory. The harvest of 1912 was poor, and was not available for export at Persian ports. But all firms are anticipating renewed activity early in 1913 and if the GermanC71FD 17 firm ,s again enabled to check export by British firms, the only hope for the latter w.ll he in Government taking up the matter of freights with the British shipping companies. The German firm have lately begun, by the use of their sh pp nf rebate, to offer higher p„ ce s for gum, poppy seed and linseed, than British ~ can pay, with the result that a variety of Persian exports are now goinl to Hamburg. It is assumed that Government does not wish to see the bulk of Kingdom 'and India P ° rtS g ° inS t0 Geman y inStead of t0 the The Germans already have an influence at Baghdad and up the Tioris which cannot be eradicated, but it is expedient to prevent them acquiring a definite interest on the Persian Coast, or at any rate, prevent them from encroaching further on the British trade position which their present methods rapidly threaten to do. r J It will be seen that in 1910 to 1911, German shipping constituted a quarter of that sent by regular lines from Europe. Now that the work of the Baghdad Railway is beginning from the Baghdad Terminus and an Anglo-Turko-German combine has been formed for lighterage, on the Shatt-al-Arab and Tigris, it is to be expected that there will be an increased number of German vessels from Ger* many with railway material passing up the Gulf. This will afford an opportunity for the Germans to increase their shipments from the Gulf at the expense of British firms. In any case we can anticipate that German prestige in the Gulf Ports which made great strides during 1911 to 1912 as a result of Wonckhaus ’ lavish dealings, will begin to be a serious obstacle to British firms. As this report demonstrates, the four principal points in which Germans are giving us cause for uneasiness are :—imports of sugar ; intrusion into the Manchester market ; understandings with British lines ; and rebates in freight permitting their agents to control prices in exports such as grain. In 1911 the Board of Trade expressed the opinion in a Memorandum dated November 6th, 1911, that from the commercial standpoint there was no case shown for intervention by His Majesty’s Government; The Government, of India have also in their letter No. 62, dated 23rd May 1911, intimated that they were not prepared, for the present, to recommend State intervention in the Gulf Trade from the political standpoint. In view of the additional evidence and fuller explanation of the difficulty of the position as given in the present Report, it is to be hoped that both the Gov ernment of India and the Board of Trade will be pleased to reconsider the various issues involved. They will note that the import of sugar into Persia exceeds that via Basreh and Baghdad, and our chief preoccupation is to prevent powerful interests from securing a definite hold in the Persian ports of the neutral zone by acquiring a monopoly of such important trade items as sugar and produce exported. The construction without British control or participation of the Basreh Baghdad railway which the India Office mentioned as a possibility which might necessitate a further examination of the question, would appear to have no direct bearing upon the present question which needs special treatment. . As far as possible, British representatives in the Gulf have endeavoured to settle problems of German competition locally without troubling Government. Sir H. Llewellyn Smith informed Mr. Geo. Lloyd in 1908 that Government would be very sorry to see any agreement between British and German shipping lines in the Gulf. But in view of the development of German interests since I9 0 8, 1 submit that our present policy should be British trade in the Gulf to be borne in British ships. Even if firms in Great Britain are thereby put to some inconvenience they yet should refrain from consigning sugar and cotton goods in German bottoms. The “ following useful forms of intervention on commercial lines ” are also suggested to the Board of Trade with the object of consolidating British interests. Mr. F. C. Strick to be asked— (i) To inform Government more precisely as to the contracts with the SU aar refineries-in Marseilles and Belgium (with the German line), when they terminate, and whether it would be possible for him to secure contracts for the Belgian refineries, as well as the French.fin To keep the Board of Trade informed of any pending developments ( in regard to these and any other negotiations between the Ham- burg-America line and his own shipping interests. riin To find a way to conclude an arrangement with those shippers of cotton goods from Manchester, now shipping by the Hamburg. America line, so that Manchester goods will cease to be imported from Hamburg in German vessels. (iv) Representatives of all British shipping lines in the Gulf, including the West Hartlepool and Andrew Weir and Company to be invited to meet at the Board of Trade and to be told what is the impression produced on British officials m the Gulf by the increase of German Trade. It might be suggested that in the face of Ger- man efforts it seems very desirable that there should be a mutual defensive understanding amongst British lines instead of the pre sent independent working. They might also be asked their views as to the methods by which the German shipping rebates on grain and exports could be met, so as to enable British buyers to com- pete on fairly equal terms with Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company ; and also requested to assist British firms exporting from Persia as for o&lt;; nnssihle. (v) British trade interests in Bushire showed their feeling of the utility of consolidation locally by forming a little committee called the Bushire-British Committee of Commerce, some three years ago: a similar step has recently been taken by British firms at Moham- merah, but many British interests in the Guh are only represented by Native agents. The formation of a Persian Gulf section of the Manchester and London Chambers of Commerce would go a great way towards strengthening British commercial foreign competi tion. (vi) In the event of 1913 proving another exceptional year for the export of grain from the Persian Gulf and British Shipping Companies being unwilling to keep their freights low, it will be imperative to consider some indirect form of State aid to British firms exporting so as to enable them to compete with Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company. (Signed) H. G.
