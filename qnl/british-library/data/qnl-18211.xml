                           Futh ool Kheyr, which recently imported slaves into Bushire. Hennell's explains that the attempt failed because the
                           Futh ool Kheyr, which belongs to the Dashtee Chief, Hajee [Haji] Khan, left Bushire long before Mahomed Koolee Sultan's arrival. Hennell's letter includes the following enclosures:Translated extract of a letter, dated 25 January 1850, from His Royal Highness Bahram Mirza, Prince of Fars, to Samuel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, in which the Prince enjoins Hennell to detain the bugla and compel the payment of the fine.Translation of a rukum, dated January 1850, from the Prince of Shiraz [Bahram Mirza], to Sheik Nasir Khan [Governor of Bushire], in which the Prince urges Sheik Nasir Khan to lay an embargo on the bugla.Translation of a note, dated 1 February 1850 from Hennell to Sheik Nasir [Khan], Governor of Bushire, in which Hennell forwards the previous enclosure to Sheik Nasir Khan and suggests that if the Sheik does carry out the Prince's request, he will not come short in the matter.Translation of a note, dated 5 February 1850, from Sheik Nasir [Khan], Governor of Bushire, to Samuel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, in which Sheik Nasir Khan states that he will follow the Prince's orders.Translation of a letter, dated 6 February 1850, from Samuel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, to His Royal Highness Bahram Mirza, Prince Governor of Fars, in which Hennell encloses a copy of Sheik Nasir Khan's reply to Hennell's note (see the previous enclosure) and states that in the event of the bugla returning to Bushire, he [Hennell] will ensure that the ship is detained until the fine has been paid. However, Hennell adds that the ship is unlikely to revisit Bushire, as the Dashtee Chief, Hajee Khan, has heard of the Prince's order. Hennell suggests that the Prince order the Dashtee Chief to compel the nakhoda of the
                              Futh ool Kheyrto pay the fine.In his initial letter to Sheil, Hennell writes that he has doubts as to whether Sheik Nasir Khan will obey the Prince's orders, as Hajee Khan is the most powerful chief in the low country and the only real support that Sheik Nasir Khan has in his feud with Bakir Khan, the Chief of Tongistoon [TangestƒÅn].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x00000a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
